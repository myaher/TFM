I fall in love with characters who fall in love with their people. I\u2019m actually fairly certain that if Caleb and Nott had not started out the campaign as friends that I would not like Caleb nearly so much. He cares for people, and is soft with Nott and Jester especially, and is protective of his people (in spite of his \u201ccowardice\u201d). And even when he has a hard time admitting he cares about other people, he still finds ways to express his affection in other ways. But he\u2019s grown increasingly more vocal about his affection and care, and has always been pretty quick to (awkwardly) compliment the things he likes about his friends. Caleb Widogast is incapable of not loving his friends and is the best thing about him. If only he realized that.

Pretty much every time Caleb is pushed into admitting he cares about his friends is Quality Content and it kills me every time. I think that him admitting\u00a0\u201cI need you to be my friend.\u201d and his sad, quiet\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been like this for so long,\u201d from episode 57 may be new favorites.</p><p><b>If you could have one power/attribute/etc. of this character, what would it be?</b></p><p>As <a>@night-filled-mountain</a>\u200b the ability to summon a cat at will is pretty much all I could ever ask for</p><p><b>Have you ever pictured this character naked?</b></p><p>Only because he has canonically been naked.</p><p><b>When did you fall in love/hate with this character?

I loved him from the very beginning, and nothing sticks out as specific moment. His first wisdom save after killing someone with fire is probably when I got truly invested in his story.</p><p><b>Who\u2019s your OTP for this character?</b></p><p>Caleb/Recovery. I semi-ship Widofjord (mostly because Travis and Liam are Menaces), and I find Clayleb to be Soft and Cute, but I\u2019m not actually invested in them as actual romantic relationships. I\u2019d be perfectly happy if Caleb ended this campaign with no romantic attachments. I\u2019m most invested in him getting to the point where he can admit that he loves with friends without reservation and without (verbal) caveats. I want him to reach a point where he feels like he can accept (platonic) affection from people aside from Nott. And, again, I want more Team Human cuddles, dammit!!</p><p><b>Vax:</b></p><p><b>Do you love/hate/don\u2019t feel strongly about this character?</b><br/></p><p>I LOVE VAX\u2019ILDAN VESSAR SO MUCH. He is probably my favorite C1 character, though that spot cycles between a few different characters at any given time.</p><p><b>What\u2019s your favorite trait of this character?</b></p><p>I love how intensely he feels, across the board. He\u2019s as capable of great deals of joy and delight as he is of sorrow. He\u2019s so full of love and life, even in his darkest moments.</p><p><b>What\u2019s your favorite moment/event involving this character?</b></p><p>It\u2019s a smaller one, in the midst of a great deal of great moments, but I think the conversation he has with Vex right before the Chroma Conclave arc begins about feeling directionless is one of the more important character moments to me in general. Part of the reason I love Vax so much is that his depression looks pretty similar to my own&ndash;more so than is true for pretty much any other depressed character I\u2019ve seen before. That quiet feeling of just not knowing what you\u2019re doing&ndash;of not knowing the <i>point</i>&ndash;that\u2019s something that I feel pretty consistently, even when it\u2019s not attached to suicidal ideation. A lot of my favorite Vax moments echo this&ndash;like his conversation with Scanlan about how he manages to be so happy, in spite of everything&ndash;and I love each and every one. But while that conversation with Vex wasn\u2019t the moment I fell in love with him, it\u2019s the moment that stands out as when he became specifically and emotionally important to me.</p><p>Also every single scene of him doing one of the girls\u2019/Trinket\u2019s hair. Modern AU Vax is a high femme stylist and you can\u2019t convince me otherwise.</p><p><b>If you could have one power/attribute/etc. of this character, what would it be?</b></p><p>Like Vex, I too envy his ability to fly at ridiculous speeds per second. Though I also wish I could just stealth nope out of emotionally difficult conversations.\u00a0</p><p><b>Have you ever pictured this character naked?</b></p><p>Liam O\u2019Brien gave me canonical wingfic sex and my brain filled in the blanks. (Shockingly I think I\u2019ve only found like one fic of that moment though).</p><p><b>When did you fall in love/hate with this character? If you don\u2019t have any strong feelings toward them, why not?</b></p><p>In general I have a hard time knowing when specifically I fell in love with any C1 characters, because I watched in a very short span of time, and also because it took me a while to really fall in love with C1 as a whole. But the earliest Vax moment that stands out for me is his near death at the very beginning of the Briarwood arc when he pictures Vex\u2019ahlia and Keyleth. That was the moment I knew that, even if I hadn\u2019t fully fallen in love with the campaign yet, once I did I was in for emotional ruination. (I was right.)</p><p><b>Who\u2019s your OTP for this character?</b></p><p>GIVE ME THAT VAXLETHILMORE OT3 LIAM O\u2019BRIEN. VAX HAD TWO HANDS, LIAM.\u00a0</p><p>*ahem* That being said&ndash;Vaxleth is probably the CR romantic ship I feel most strongly about. Two people with depression and anxiety and lots of big feelings about mortality figuring out how to love each other? I can strongly relate.

I\u2019m actually fairly certain that if Caleb and Nott had not started out the campaign as friends that I would not like Caleb nearly so much. He cares for people, and is soft with Nott and Jester especially, and is protective of his people (in spite of his \u201ccowardice\u201d). And even when he has a hard time admitting he cares about other people, he still finds ways to express his affection in other ways. But he\u2019s grown increasingly more vocal about his affection and care, and has always been pretty quick to (awkwardly) compliment the things he likes about his friends.

I\u2019d be perfectly happy if Caleb ended this campaign with no romantic attachments. I\u2019m most invested in him getting to the point where he can admit that he loves with friends without reservation and without (verbal) caveats.

Part of the reason I love Vax so much is that his depression looks pretty similar to my own\u2013more so than is true for pretty much any other depressed character I\u2019ve seen before. That quiet feeling of just not knowing what you\u2019re doing\u2013of not knowing the <i>point</i>\u2013that\u2019s something that I feel pretty consistently, even when it\u2019s not attached to suicidal ideation. A lot of my favorite Vax moments echo this\u2013like his conversation with Scanlan about how he manages to be so happy, in spite of everything\u2013and I love each and every one.
