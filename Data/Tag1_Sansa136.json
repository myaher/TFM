There in the gardens where the winter roses still yet bloomed, clearly still cared for by someone in Winterfell. And now that she found him there, just how obvious it was. Of course Jon was there, surrounded by the beautiful blooms. They were his mother&rsquo;s favorite flower, Sansa recalled her father saying Lyanna had always been enchanted by their lovely smell. Of course Jon would be there, if only to feel close to her.</p><p>He was alone on the bench with the lightest dusting of snow layered over his shoulders. Just how long had he been there? Sansa approached him quietly, noticing how his shoulders shook, telling her just how badly he was hurting. Not that she could blame him. How was one supposed to feel when you lived your whole life thinking you were someone, only to be told you were someone else? Sansa knew how badly Jon had always wanted to be called a Stark, to be a true born son of their father&rsquo;s&hellip; And now he wasn&rsquo;t even a bastard. In truth, he was far more than any single one of them. He was a prince, he was royalty. No&hellip; He was a King. But, Sansa couldn&rsquo;t help but to still think of him as just Jon. He had always been a Stark to her, after all. This reveal of his parentage didn&rsquo;t have to change anything if he didn&rsquo;t want it to. </p><p>Reaching out, she placed her hand upon his shoulder and at once he turned to face her, his face somber and pale. He stared up at her for several long moments before his face crumpled, his own hand sliding into place over hers. She came around then, sinking onto the bench beside him, taking him into her arms as he began to cry. There were no words needed as he held fast to her, as if she were the only thing keeping him anchored to this world. Her body, warm and soft, revived his own cold, aching frame, reminding him that things were not yet all lost. For a long time they sat there together, arms around each other, until finally Jon&rsquo;s tears began to fade and he sat up, though close to her side did he remain. Sansa slipped an arm around his shoulder, drawing him closer, and she felt Jon tip his head to rest against her own. </p><p>It was only then that she spoke. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing has to change you know?&rdquo; Jon did not reply, but she felt him shift, his hand reaching out to take hold of hers where it sat on his knee. &ldquo;No matter who anyone else says you are&hellip; No matter what kingdom you&rsquo;re born to rule or not rule&hellip; You&rsquo;re always going to be Jon Snow to me.&rdquo; She turned her head then, catching the faintest of smiles on his lips before he sat up straight, though their shoulders still brushed. </p><p>A moment later, Jon rose up to his feet and Sansa watched as he reached for a winter rose, plucking it from its place in its bush. &ldquo;For you.&rdquo; He said as he offered it out for her to take, his lips curving with the first true smile she&rsquo;d seen since his return to Winterfell. &ldquo;Thank you, Sansa&hellip;&rdquo; He spoke softly this time, his eyes holding so much more meaning than his words could ever say. She smiled as she took the rose from him, their gloved fingers brushing as she accepted the bloom. &nbsp;</p><p>And then Jon turned, walking away from her there on the bench, leaving her with a racing heart and blushing cheeks. <br /></p>",
