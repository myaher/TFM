She exhaled heavily as she sat on the street. The eighteen-year-old girl put her hands through her hair as she tried to think about how she managed to get here. She was literally sitting in the middle of nowhere. Only the moon illuminated the street, as there wasn\u2019t any light. Y/N figured she must\u2019ve been somewhere on the outskirts of New York.</p><p>The girl groaned as she searched for her phone in her jacket. She smiled to herself triumphantly as she pulled it out of her left pocket. Y/N tried to dial her father\u2019s number, but sadly, there was no signal.</p><p>\u201cGreat, just great\u201d she muttered a few curses under her breath as she put her phone back into her jacket and tried to stand up.</p><p>The alcohol that she had drunk a few hours before was still present in her blood, thus she had major problems with being on her feet. She took a deep breath and started slowly walking ahead. Y/N had no idea where she was going but she knew she had to keep moving.</p><p>\u201cJeez, why am I always so stupid?\u201d she cursed herself for her inability to drink like a normal person.</p><p>Yesterday, she turned eighteen years old. Obviously, she had partied like crazy, but if she knew it would end like that, maybe she would have rather stayed at home. The girl tried very hard to remember what had happened last night but all she had in her head was a big, blank space.</p><p>How did she end up here? She couldn\u2019t just walk there by herself. Someone must\u2019ve had given her a ride. But then, why would that someone leave a drunk girl alone in the middle of nowhere? She had so many questions.</p><p>\u201cUgh, dad is gonna kill me\u201d she put her head on her forehead and closed her eyes. \u201cCome on, Y/N, you have to remember something\u201d</p><p>As she was so concentrated, she got startled when she heard the sound of a car. She turned around, as it seemed someone was going towards her. The girl smiled. Maybe someone was going to give her a ride back home, hopefully.</p><p>After a few seconds, she saw a black car driving towards where she was standing. She walked out on the road, trying to get it to stop.</p><p>The car came to an abrupt stop a few meters before her. Y/N smiled to herself, as she walked shakily towards the driver&rsquo;s side. The window started opening slowly.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m sorry, but I think I got lost. Are you going to New York? Could you give me a ride?\u201d she smiled as sweetly as she could when she saw the face of the driver. It was a man in his forties. He was dressed in black, his blonde hair slicked back. He wasn\u2019t very handsome, having a quite scare jaw and a big nose. His narrow lips curled in a terrifying smirk as his brown eyes glowed in the moonlight.</p><p>She suddenly regretted that she found herself in this situation. She didn\u2019t want anything to do with this shady man at all. But, he was her only way of getting home.</p><p>\u201cSure, sugar. Hop on in\u201d he had a devious grin on his face, as he gestured to the empty seat on his right.</p><p>Y/N smiled at him again, as she walked in front of the car and opened the door to the passenger seat. She cursed herself in her head again, as she got in and closed the door.</p><p>The man started driving ahead. For a moment, they were both silent. Y/N was questioning all of her life choices in this very moment, as the man still wore an awful smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sugar?\u201d he looked at her, showing his teeth. Oh, how she hated this nickname. She looked at him and cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d she smirked at him, trying to hide her true emotions. The girl started inspecting his car, trying to find any suspicious things, but everything seemed to be perfectly okay.</p><p>\u201cThe name\u2019s Damien.\u201d the blonde man took her hand in his and kissed it, looking her in the eyes. She stared at him with wide eyes and smiled falsely. This man was starting to get more and more creepy with each passing second.</p><p>\u201cUhm, you have a really nice car\u201d she stuttered, trying to compliment him in some way, in case he wanted to kill her later. It was her second day being an adult and she really didn\u2019t want to get killed. That would be slightly irresponsible, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d he smiled tightly, as muscles in his jaw twitched. \u201cWhat is such a beautiful girl doing here alone at this hour?\u201d he looked at her with fake curiosity.</p><p>Y/N thought for a moment. \u201cTo be honest, I myself have no idea\u201d she laughed a little.</p><p>The man hummed to himself as if he had known what her answer would be.</p><p>\u201cOh god, look what\u2019s outside the window!\u201d he shouted as he looked in her way. Her eyes widened, her head going to the right, looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cWait, what? There is noth-\u201c the man, Damien, hit her head with the back of his gun that he pulled out of his jacket. Y/N fell down on the seat, unconscious.</p><p>The blonde man exhaled deeply, grinning once again. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and dialed a number.</p><p>\u201cEverything went down right with the plan. I\u2019m going back to the base.\u201d his smile faltered, as he barked into the phone.</p><p>The black car took a sharp turn and speeded off in the opposite direction.</p><p><b>TAGS</b>:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEOOCvvzf-zM3f2LDbnnpTg\">@chook007</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjP3T6U4zVVqiEQkOcgJ1qw\">@thatfishontheleft</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msDR_UltX5nodCYz83th_GA\">@prxttybirdz</a></p>",

She exhaled heavily as she sat on the street. The eighteen-year-old girl put her hands through her hair as she tried to think about how she managed to get here. She was literally sitting in the middle of nowhere. Only the moon illuminated the street, as there wasn\u2019t any light. Y/N figured she must\u2019ve been somewhere on the outskirts of New York.</p><p>The girl groaned as she searched for her phone in her jacket. She smiled to herself triumphantly as she pulled it out of her left pocket. Y/N tried to dial her father\u2019s number, but sadly, there was no signal.</p><p>\u201cGreat, just great\u201d she muttered a few curses under her breath as she put her phone back into her jacket and tried to stand up.</p><p>The alcohol that she had drunk a few hours before was still present in her blood, thus she had major problems with being on her feet. She took a deep breath and started slowly walking ahead. Y/N had no idea where she was going but she knew she had to keep moving.</p><p>\u201cJeez, why am I always so stupid?\u201d she cursed herself for her inability to drink like a normal person.</p><p>Yesterday, she turned eighteen years old. Obviously, she had partied like crazy, but if she knew it would end like that, maybe she would have rather stayed at home. The girl tried very hard to remember what had happened last night but all she had in her head was a big, blank space.</p><p>How did she end up here? She couldn\u2019t just walk there by herself. Someone must\u2019ve had given her a ride. But then, why would that someone leave a drunk girl alone in the middle of nowhere? She had so many questions.</p><p>\u201cUgh, dad is gonna kill me\u201d she put her head on her forehead and closed her eyes. \u201cCome on, Y/N, you have to remember something\u201d</p><p>As she was so concentrated, she got startled when she heard the sound of a car. She turned around, as it seemed someone was going towards her. The girl smiled. Maybe someone was going to give her a ride back home, hopefully.</p><p>After a few seconds, she saw a black car driving towards where she was standing. She walked out on the road, trying to get it to stop.</p><p>The car came to an abrupt stop a few meters before her. Y/N smiled to herself, as she walked shakily towards the driver\u2019s side. The window started opening slowly.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m sorry, but I think I got lost. Are you going to New York? Could you give me a ride?\u201d she smiled as sweetly as she could when she saw the face of the driver. It was a man in his forties. He was dressed in black, his blonde hair slicked back. He wasn\u2019t very handsome, having a quite scare jaw and a big nose. His narrow lips curled in a terrifying smirk as his brown eyes glowed in the moonlight.</p><p>She suddenly regretted that she found herself in this situation. She didn\u2019t want anything to do with this shady man at all. But, he was her only way of getting home.</p><p>\u201cSure, sugar. Hop on in\u201d he had a devious grin on his face, as he gestured to the empty seat on his right.</p><p>Y/N smiled at him again, as she walked in front of the car and opened the door to the passenger seat. She cursed herself in her head again, as she got in and closed the door.</p><p>The man started driving ahead. For a moment, they were both silent. Y/N was questioning all of her life choices in this very moment, as the man still wore an awful smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sugar?\u201d he looked at her, showing his teeth. Oh, how she hated this nickname. She looked at him and cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d she smirked at him, trying to hide her true emotions. The girl started inspecting his car, trying to find any suspicious things, but everything seemed to be perfectly okay.</p><p>\u201cThe name\u2019s Damien.\u201d the blonde man took her hand in his and kissed it, looking her in the eyes. She stared at him with wide eyes and smiled falsely. This man was starting to get more and more creepy with each passing second.</p><p>\u201cUhm, you have a really nice car\u201d she stuttered, trying to compliment him in some way, in case he wanted to kill her later. It was her second day being an adult and she really didn\u2019t want to get killed. That would be slightly irresponsible, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d he smiled tightly, as muscles in his jaw twitched. \u201cWhat is such a beautiful girl doing here alone at this hour?\u201d he looked at her with fake curiosity.</p><p>Y/N thought for a moment. \u201cTo be honest, I myself have no idea\u201d she laughed a little.</p><p>The man hummed to himself as if he had known what her answer would be.</p><p>\u201cOh god, look what\u2019s outside the window!\u201d he shouted as he looked in her way. Her eyes widened, her head going to the right, looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cWait, what? There is noth-\u201c the man, Damien, hit her head with the back of his gun that he pulled out of his jacket. Y/N fell down on the seat, unconscious.</p><p>The blonde man exhaled deeply, grinning once again. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and dialed a number.</p><p>\u201cEverything went down right with the plan. I\u2019m going back to the base.\u201d his smile faltered, as he barked into the phone.</p><p>The black car took a sharp turn and speeded off in the opposite direction.</p><p><b>TAGS</b>:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEOOCvvzf-zM3f2LDbnnpTg\">@chook007</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjP3T6U4zVVqiEQkOcgJ1qw\">@thatfishontheleft</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msDR_UltX5nodCYz83th_GA\">@prxttybirdz</a></p></p>",
