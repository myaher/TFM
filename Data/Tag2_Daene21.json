            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",

Instead they went for spectacle like what we would get from an action movie. \u00a0So, for example, if Dany being killed by Jon is the spectacle planned for episode 6, they did the bare minimum by keeping Jon reduced to kind of a placeholder who was mouthing the same old lines about\u00a0\u201chis queen\u201d until they could get him to the point where he suddenly goes off the rails by killing Dany.\u00a0</p><p>There was very little intrigue about Jon\u2019s Targaryen Bloodline simply because his character was a now mostly a cardboard cut-out instead of a well-rounded person. \u00a0Even during season seven, most of his talk consisted very one-dimensional statements about the threat of the Night King which turned him into an almost annoying\u00a0\u201cprophet of doom\u201d type caricature of himself. \u00a0Not that the advance of the Night King was not what Jon should have been focusing on, but his character lost much of what had made it so great. \u00a0His dialogues were almost exclusively about the Night King and came off as wooden because he was not given very much nuance. \u00a0His supposed romance with Dany is a great case in point, and still comes across as very ambiguous.\u00a0</p><p>The earlier seasons were very much about Jon Snow\u2019s backstory, which is rich with pathos and intrigue even in the show. \u00a0Jon\u2019s parents, although we only see them briefly, are major figures because Robert\u2019s Rebellion and Robert Baratheon\u2019s ascension are major drivers of the entire story. \u00a0Rhaegar\u2019s motives, which we never got to hear any more about, are left shrouded in mystery by the show, even though the saga and details from the Tower of Joy are major revelations from the earlier seasons - which are shown as being intimately connected to Jon\u2019s Kingship. \u00a0Benioff and Weiss did a good job handling these essential plot points in season six, but then just dropped it all so that they could finish the series with abbreviated seasons for seven and eight. \u00a0Many viewers were willing to overlook the huge problems with season seven because they believed that season eight was going to bring everything together, including the deeper mysteries of Jon\u2019s birth and resurrection.</p><p>Instead they likely designed episodes five and six as \u201cshowcases\u201d\u00a0for Dany\u2019s descent into genocide and then the necessity of Jon killing her. \u00a0The essential tragedy of this for Jon is pretty much skipped over in favor of giving us \u00a0a Dany-centric arc in the final season. \u00a0The first episode is about her triumphant arrival at Winterfell. \u00a0She shares her dragons with Jon, only to find out right before the big battle that her love interest is her nephew and more importantly the rightful heir. \u00a0Dany gets a cold reception in the North and is somewhat usurped by Sansa and also eclipsed by Jon\u2019s popularity. \u00a0It\u2019s all about her rather than Jon; but it could have been about both if the writers had taken the time and effort to do justice to the full story.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1913\" data-orig-height=\"1067\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e09520b0878416dc6f0a7ba24f0fc6d7/tumblr_inline_psr1bkEeSf1wx65bx_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1913\" data-orig-height=\"1067\"/></figure><p>Jon Snow in\u00a0\u201cThe Bells\u201d. \u00a0 His identity/moral crisis should have been a centerpiece of season eight.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Starks do triumph in the end in that the remaining characters all live and have new beginnings, but the ending feels unsatisfying because the plotting makes them appear as footnotes to Dany\u2019s story. \u00a0This is a big reason why the ending feels muddled. \u00a0 We can see the\u00a0\u201cbones\u201d of Martin\u2019s story, and how the Starks are going to be the next chapter of his saga (if ever told), yet their characters have been given short shrift because the focus was on Dany\u2019s arc. \u00a0The story lost so much of the richness and complexity of the Stark family, including their mystical roots with the North and the Direwolves. \u00a0In particular, Jon\u2019s story was central to the\u00a0\u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d, but the show lost the fascinating threads of what he was really all about.</p><p>How much better could <i>Game of Thrones</i> have been had Jon\u2019s personal qualities vs. those of Dany been made a centerpiece of the story! \u00a0Even Varys\u2019s short-lived\u00a0\u201cplot\u201d was inexplicably presented as a minor sideshow when it should have been a major development for Jon and the Starks.</p>",
