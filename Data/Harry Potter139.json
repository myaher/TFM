So instead he was left abandoned in a muggle orphanage and left to his own morals (This really annoys me) </p><p>What I really like about Tom is his ability to make people trust him, and to sway them. He acted as the perfect Mr Innocent while at the same time he had murdered his blood relatives, killed another student with the Basilisk and created Horcruxes. But all the time he was still just a child you know?

When they return, will they be able to handle the truth that comes up and are they willing to face their beloved Sirius Black? (This is my first imagine so go easy on me but if you have some tips, i\u2019m all ears)</b></p><p>Harry was now 16. The Order is living at Grimmauld place. Everyone but you. After the death of James and Lily; your best friends, it was hard to get back to your normal. It got harder when your boyfriend was convicted for their murder and sent to Azkaban. You tried talking to Remus about it but all he told you was to leave and enjoy your free life. Of course you didn&rsquo;t. At first. Then your requests to visit Sirius was denied, he wouldn&rsquo;t even reply to your letters. Everyone cut off contact with you either because of your association with the \u2018murderer\u2019 of the Potter\u2019s or because they needed to heal after the war.</p><p>No body wanted you around. No body needed you. Not even your boyfriend and your supposed best friend Remus who also cut off contact with you.You even begged Dumbledore to let Harry be in your care, so you could have someone and look after him but the old wizard said that he needed to care of family. So you left, you went to France to be a professor at Beauxbatons. It was hard, tears left your eyes every time you would see a group of teenage boys stroll around on campus as it reminded you of your best friends, you didn&rsquo;t let it take over.</p><p>16 years have passed now. Dumbledore has asked you to return. That letter was the first you have gotten from England in all those years. You heard only that Voldemort has made some appearances and that Harry needs your guidance. You didn&rsquo;t know whether to respond, why would he need you? Why now? He needed you when he was a baby. And Dumbledore was the one to reject you. In the end, Harry comes first and if he needs you, you&rsquo;ll be there.</p><p>Last time you were at Grimmauld place was when Sirius ran away and he forgot something in his room. He made both of you travel there and retrieve it together, he said it was because he wanted to show you something but you knew it was because he was scared. Walking into the house feels like a step back in time except you weren&rsquo;t with your friends anymore. You felt like a stranger walking into someone else\u2019s memories. You dropped your bags and asked if anyone was there.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Come in from the rain and sit down. How are you?\u201d Molly ran towards you, her warm smile and motherly nature hasn&rsquo;t changed considering the years that have passed. \u201cHow was being a professor? Always new you would be a great teacher when we were at school.\u201d</p><p>Molly unloaded questions onto you and you smiled. You missed this. although you and Molly were extremely close friends, you did defend each other during a duel and saved each others lives. </p><p>\u201cEverything was amazing Molly. The students were sometimes a nightmare to watch out for but they are brilliant.\u201d You laughed, recalling the times the students almost killed themselves and came to you for guidance.</p><p>As Molly was about to reply, Remus walked through the front door of the house. You knew cause of the smell that wafted through the air and the look on Molly\u2019s face. You turned around and made eye contact with the, now, frail and tried man. You jumped up and ran to him, hugging your body to his as tightly as you could.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you&rsquo;re crushing my bones.\u201d Remus let out is a gasp before you slowly let him go. \u201cHow are you?\u201d He asked as if you just came back from the shops down the road. You suddenly remembered everything that happened, everyone cutting you off from their lives and practically pushing you out the country. You needed to know why, not stand around and act as if nothing happened.</p><p>You pushed Remus away from you and walked away from him to the other side of the room. You were gonna treat this like a professor and demand answers but all that came out was the weakest sound you&rsquo;ve ever made, \u201cwhy?\u201d</p><p>Molly and Remus looked at each other, shocked and surprised. Remus spoke up and questioned you, \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy two best friends die, my boyfriend get sent to Azkaban and the last person in my life that I could turn to convinces me to leave the country!\u201d Your voice came back as you ranted, your anger finding its way into your speech. \u201cEveryone avoided me like the plague and I lived like I wasn&rsquo;t wanted, even Dumbledore thought I wasn&rsquo;t worthy. So I left, I thought \u2018maybe someone would send an explanation as to why everyone suddenly hated me\u2019 but I got nothing!\u201d</p><p>Your chest heaved. Your throat constricted as a reminder to how hurt you actually were but you couldn&rsquo;t show it. </p><p>\u201cEven my boyfriend didn&rsquo;t want to see me. Sirius! The man who said that he would be there for me whenever I needed him but when push came to shove, he cut me off!\u201d Tears started spilling from your eyes as you relived every horrible memory. \u201cNow I need you two to tell me why. No dancing around the subject. Just tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Remus and Molly looked at each other, they both exchanged a look and Remus spoke up.</p><p>\u201cWe were told to leave you. We were told not to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>You were more confused as ever. \u201cWhat? By who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSirius.\u201d They both said in unison.</p><p>Sirius made everyone push you away? Why? What would he do this to you?</p><p>Molly stood up and took your hands in hers. \u201cWhen Sirius was taken away to Azkaban, he had a trail. He asked the judge to not let you come, he didn&rsquo;t want you to see him in a cage. Dumbledore vouched for him, so, everyone came but you. Everybody was told not to tell you about the trail and just say that he was sent straight to Azkaban. We all knew Sirius wasn&rsquo;t going to win, no matter who fought for him. His last request was for everyone to cut off contact with you.\u201d Molly took a breath as she looked at Remus for reassurance before she continued. \u201cHis reasoning is something you need to hear yourself.\u201d</p><p>You laughed. It was venomous. A bitter laugh. \u201cHow can he explain it to me when he\u2019s still in prison? He won&rsquo;t even let me see him.\u201d</p><p>Shock. That is what took over the features of Molly and Remus. You waited for them to speak but they were speechless. Remus stepped forward and lifted a newspaper from the coffee table next to you three. He presented the cover to you and waited for your reaction.</p><p>It was Sirius. He was holding up is prisoner number, screaming at the reader. The title of the page read \u2018Have You Seen This Wizard?\u2019. He escaped. The paper was old through. He must&rsquo;ve been out for a while now. And he never contacted you? This caused your anger to boil even higher.</p><p>~</p><p>Harry sat in his bedroom. You knew this because you were outside his bedroom door next to Tonks, trying to unlock it. When the door swung open, a very surprised Harry stood before your small group that came to rescue him. He greeted everyone until his eyes landed on you. </p><p>\u201cHello Harry.\u201d You smiled, tears coming to your eyes as you took in his messy hair and green eyes.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d You didn&rsquo;t blame him for being confused.</p><p>\u201cI was your mother and father\u2019s best friend. We went to school with one another and got into some trouble. I am also your godmother.\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened as he realised who you were. You knew that Molly told Harry of you, both you and Sirius. He tried to ask you something but you shook your head, you needed to leave.</p><p>The bricks of Grimmauld place moved to show a door magically appear on the newly created wall. Once the building stopped transforming, everyone on the \u2018rescue Harry\u2019 party walked in one by one. You went to walk in but backs were blocking your view, they didn&rsquo;t move as if the were turned to stone. Slowly, heads started to turn to you. Everyone looked scared as the looked at what was inside and back to you. </p><p>Getting tired of what was happening, you pushed past everyone whilst muttering about the strangeness of their faces until you realised what they were looking at. </p><p>Sirius stood in front of you. He looked older and more tired, at least grew out the beard he&rsquo;s been wanting to have since 4th year. You stared. After Molly and Remus told you that Sirius has been out of Azkaban for a while and he&rsquo;s been living in Grimmauld place the whole time, you became furious and left. The only time you came back was to go on this mission to save Harry. It seemed that Sirius didn&rsquo;t even know you back in the country.</p><p>Everyone looked between you two, waiting for someone to speak. Molly even tried to say something but Harry quieted her and watched what was about to unfold.</p><p>\u201cI know what you&rsquo;re thinking, Y/N.\u201d Sirius started, running his hands through his hair.</p><p>That stupid, beautiful hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that to you? How could I make everyone push you away?\u201d He started becoming scared under your hard gaze. \u201cI needed to Y/N. I couldn&rsquo;t let you live your life waiting for me to get out of Azkaban. You needed to live your life! You always wanted to be a professor and I couldn&rsquo;t hold you back. So yes. I cut you off and made everyone do it too but-\u201d</p><p>Sirius has never seen you so quiet. He mistook the silence as anger but you were just admiring how much you loved him, even after all these years and what he has done.</p><p>\u201cPlease Y/N. Please say something. Tell me I&rsquo;m an idiot or that I had no business in doing what I did. Say that you want me gone and what I did was the worst decision I&rsquo;ve ever made. Shout at me and say you hate me. Say you don&rsquo;t love me anymore.Just&hellip;.say something. Anything&hellip;&hellip; I\u2019m begging here\u201d</p><p>You walked towards him. Every head in the room tracked your motions and anticipated a fight. Remus quickly glanced at Molly as their eyes were both filled with anxiety.</p><p>You lifted your hand up to his cheek and whispered, \u201cI love you as much as you still love me.\u201d The words left your mouth and Sirius slammed his lips onto yours, grabbing hold of your waist and lifting you up, Everyone cheered and even Harry had the widest smile on his face.</p>",

Not even your boyfriend and your supposed best friend Remus who also cut off contact with you.You even begged Dumbledore to let Harry be in your care, so you could have someone and look after him but the old wizard said that he needed to care of family. So you left, you went to France to be a professor at Beauxbatons. It was hard, tears left your eyes every time you would see a group of teenage boys stroll around on campus as it reminded you of your best friends, you didn\u2019t let it take over.</p><p>16 years have passed now. Dumbledore has asked you to return. That letter was the first you have gotten from England in all those years. You heard only that Voldemort has made some appearances and that Harry needs your guidance. You didn\u2019t know whether to respond, why would he need you? Why now? He needed you when he was a baby. And Dumbledore was the one to reject you. In the end, Harry comes first and if he needs you, you\u2019ll be there.</p><p>Last time you were at Grimmauld place was when Sirius ran away and he forgot something in his room. He made both of you travel there and retrieve it together, he said it was because he wanted to show you something but you knew it was because he was scared. Walking into the house feels like a step back in time except you weren\u2019t with your friends anymore. You felt like a stranger walking into someone else\u2019s memories. You dropped your bags and asked if anyone was there.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Come in from the rain and sit down. How are you?\u201d Molly ran towards you, her warm smile and motherly nature hasn\u2019t changed considering the years that have passed. \u201cHow was being a professor? Always new you would be a great teacher when we were at school.\u201d</p><p>Molly unloaded questions onto you and you smiled. You missed this. although you and Molly were extremely close friends, you did defend each other during a duel and saved each others lives. </p><p>\u201cEverything was amazing Molly. The students were sometimes a nightmare to watch out for but they are brilliant.\u201d You laughed, recalling the times the students almost killed themselves and came to you for guidance.</p><p>As Molly was about to reply, Remus walked through the front door of the house. You knew cause of the smell that wafted through the air and the look on Molly\u2019s face. You turned around and made eye contact with the, now, frail and tried man. You jumped up and ran to him, hugging your body to his as tightly as you could.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you\u2019re crushing my bones.\u201d Remus let out is a gasp before you slowly let him go. \u201cHow are you?\u201d He asked as if you just came back from the shops down the road. You suddenly remembered everything that happened, everyone cutting you off from their lives and practically pushing you out the country. You needed to know why, not stand around and act as if nothing happened.</p><p>You pushed Remus away from you and walked away from him to the other side of the room. You were gonna treat this like a professor and demand answers but all that came out was the weakest sound you\u2019ve ever made, \u201cwhy?\u201d</p><p>Molly and Remus looked at each other, shocked and surprised. Remus spoke up and questioned you, \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy two best friends die, my boyfriend get sent to Azkaban and the last person in my life that I could turn to convinces me to leave the country!\u201d Your voice came back as you ranted, your anger finding its way into your speech. \u201cEveryone avoided me like the plague and I lived like I wasn\u2019t wanted, even Dumbledore thought I wasn\u2019t worthy. So I left, I thought \u2018maybe someone would send an explanation as to why everyone suddenly hated me\u2019 but I got nothing!\u201d</p><p>Your chest heaved. Your throat constricted as a reminder to how hurt you actually were but you couldn\u2019t show it. </p><p>\u201cEven my boyfriend didn\u2019t want to see me. Sirius! The man who said that he would be there for me whenever I needed him but when push came to shove, he cut me off!\u201d Tears started spilling from your eyes as you relived every horrible memory. \u201cNow I need you two to tell me why. No dancing around the subject. Just tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Remus and Molly looked at each other, they both exchanged a look and Remus spoke up.</p><p>\u201cWe were told to leave you. We were told not to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>You were more confused as ever. \u201cWhat? By who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSirius.\u201d They both said in unison.</p><p>Sirius made everyone push you away? Why? What would he do this to you?</p><p>Molly stood up and took your hands in hers. \u201cWhen Sirius was taken away to Azkaban, he had a trail. He asked the judge to not let you come, he didn\u2019t want you to see him in a cage. Dumbledore vouched for him, so, everyone came but you. Everybody was told not to tell you about the trail and just say that he was sent straight to Azkaban. We all knew Sirius wasn\u2019t going to win, no matter who fought for him. His last request was for everyone to cut off contact with you.\u201d Molly took a breath as she looked at Remus for reassurance before she continued. \u201cHis reasoning is something you need to hear yourself.\u201d</p><p>You laughed. It was venomous. A bitter laugh. \u201cHow can he explain it to me when he\u2019s still in prison? He won\u2019t even let me see him.\u201d</p><p>Shock. That is what took over the features of Molly and Remus. You waited for them to speak but they were speechless. Remus stepped forward and lifted a newspaper from the coffee table next to you three. He presented the cover to you and waited for your reaction.</p><p>It was Sirius. He was holding up is prisoner number, screaming at the reader. The title of the page read \u2018Have You Seen This Wizard?\u2019. He escaped. The paper was old through. He must\u2019ve been out for a while now. And he never contacted you? This caused your anger to boil even higher.</p><p>~</p><p>Harry sat in his bedroom. You knew this because you were outside his bedroom door next to Tonks, trying to unlock it. When the door swung open, a very surprised Harry stood before your small group that came to rescue him. He greeted everyone until his eyes landed on you. </p><p>\u201cHello Harry.\u201d You smiled, tears coming to your eyes as you took in his messy hair and green eyes.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d You didn\u2019t blame him for being confused.</p><p>\u201cI was your mother and father\u2019s best friend. We went to school with one another and got into some trouble. I am also your godmother.\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened as he realised who you were. You knew that Molly told Harry of you, both you and Sirius. He tried to ask you something but you shook your head, you needed to leave.</p><p>The bricks of Grimmauld place moved to show a door magically appear on the newly created wall. Once the building stopped transforming, everyone on the \u2018rescue Harry\u2019 party walked in one by one. You went to walk in but backs were blocking your view, they didn\u2019t move as if the were turned to stone. Slowly, heads started to turn to you. Everyone looked scared as the looked at what was inside and back to you. </p><p>Getting tired of what was happening, you pushed past everyone whilst muttering about the strangeness of their faces until you realised what they were looking at. </p><p>Sirius stood in front of you. He looked older and more tired, at least grew out the beard he\u2019s been wanting to have since 4th year. You stared. After Molly and Remus told you that Sirius has been out of Azkaban for a while and he\u2019s been living in Grimmauld place the whole time, you became furious and left. The only time you came back was to go on this mission to save Harry. It seemed that Sirius didn\u2019t even know you back in the country.</p><p>Everyone looked between you two, waiting for someone to speak. Molly even tried to say something but Harry quieted her and watched what was about to unfold.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Y/N.\u201d Sirius started, running his hands through his hair.</p><p>That stupid, beautiful hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that to you? How could I make everyone push you away?\u201d He started becoming scared under your hard gaze. \u201cI needed to Y/N. I couldn\u2019t let you live your life waiting for me to get out of Azkaban. You needed to live your life! You always wanted to be a professor and I couldn\u2019t hold you back. So yes. I cut you off and made everyone do it too but-\u201d</p><p>Sirius has never seen you so quiet. He mistook the silence as anger but you were just admiring how much you loved him, even after all these years and what he has done.</p><p>\u201cPlease Y/N. Please say something. Tell me I\u2019m an idiot or that I had no business in doing what I did. Say that you want me gone and what I did was the worst decision I\u2019ve ever made. Shout at me and say you hate me. Say you don\u2019t love me anymore.Just\u2026.say something. Anything\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m begging here\u201d</p><p>You walked towards him. Every head in the room tracked your motions and anticipated a fight. Remus quickly glanced at Molly as their eyes were both filled with anxiety.</p><p>You lifted your hand up to his cheek and whispered, \u201cI love you as much as you still love me.\u201d The words left your mouth and Sirius slammed his lips onto yours, grabbing hold of your waist and lifting you up, Everyone cheered and even Harry had the widest smile on his face.</p></p>",

You needed to know why, not stand around and act as if nothing happened.</p><p>You pushed Remus away from you and walked away from him to the other side of the room. You were gonna treat this like a professor and demand answers but all that came out was the weakest sound you&rsquo;ve ever made, &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p><p>Molly and Remus looked at each other, shocked and surprised. Remus spoke up and questioned you, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My two best friends die, my boyfriend get sent to Azkaban and the last person in my life that I could turn to convinces me to leave the country!&rdquo; Your voice came back as you ranted, your anger finding its way into your speech. &ldquo;Everyone avoided me like the plague and I lived like I wasn&rsquo;t wanted, even Dumbledore thought I wasn&rsquo;t worthy. So I left, I thought &lsquo;maybe someone would send an explanation as to why everyone suddenly hated me&rsquo; but I got nothing!&rdquo;</p><p>Your chest heaved. Your throat constricted as a reminder to how hurt you actually were but you couldn&rsquo;t show it. </p><p>&ldquo;Even my boyfriend didn&rsquo;t want to see me. Sirius! The man who said that he would be there for me whenever I needed him but when push came to shove, he cut me off!&rdquo; Tears started spilling from your eyes as you relived every horrible memory. &ldquo;Now I need you two to tell me why. No dancing around the subject. Just tell me why.&rdquo;</p><p>Remus and Molly looked at each other, they both exchanged a look and Remus spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;We were told to leave you. We were told not to talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>You were more confused as ever. &ldquo;What? By who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sirius.&rdquo; They both said in unison.</p><p>Sirius made everyone push you away? Why? What would he do this to you?</p><p>Molly stood up and took your hands in hers. &ldquo;When Sirius was taken away to Azkaban, he had a trail. He asked the judge to not let you come, he didn&rsquo;t want you to see him in a cage. Dumbledore vouched for him, so, everyone came but you. Everybody was told not to tell you about the trail and just say that he was sent straight to Azkaban. We all knew Sirius wasn&rsquo;t going to win, no matter who fought for him. His last request was for everyone to cut off contact with you.&rdquo; Molly took a breath as she looked at Remus for reassurance before she continued. &ldquo;His reasoning is something you need to hear yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed. It was venomous. A bitter laugh. &ldquo;How can he explain it to me when he&rsquo;s still in prison? He won&rsquo;t even let me see him.&rdquo;</p><p>Shock. That is what took over the features of Molly and Remus. You waited for them to speak but they were speechless. Remus stepped forward and lifted a newspaper from the coffee table next to you three. He presented the cover to you and waited for your reaction.</p><p>It was Sirius. He was holding up is prisoner number, screaming at the reader. The title of the page read &lsquo;Have You Seen This Wizard?&rsquo;. He escaped. The paper was old through. He must&rsquo;ve been out for a while now. And he never contacted you? This caused your anger to boil even higher.</p><p>~</p><p>Harry sat in his bedroom. You knew this because you were outside his bedroom door next to Tonks, trying to unlock it. When the door swung open, a very surprised Harry stood before your small group that came to rescue him. He greeted everyone until his eyes landed on you. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello Harry.&rdquo; You smiled, tears coming to your eyes as you took in his messy hair and green eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t blame him for being confused.</p><p>&ldquo;I was your mother and father&rsquo;s best friend. We went to school with one another and got into some trouble. I am also your godmother.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes widened as he realised who you were. You knew that Molly told Harry of you, both you and Sirius. He tried to ask you something but you shook your head, you needed to leave.</p><p>The bricks of Grimmauld place moved to show a door magically appear on the newly created wall. Once the building stopped transforming, everyone on the &lsquo;rescue Harry&rsquo; party walked in one by one. You went to walk in but backs were blocking your view, they didn&rsquo;t move as if the were turned to stone. Slowly, heads started to turn to you. Everyone looked scared as the looked at what was inside and back to you. </p><p>Getting tired of what was happening, you pushed past everyone whilst muttering about the strangeness of their faces until you realised what they were looking at. </p><p>Sirius stood in front of you. He looked older and more tired, at least grew out the beard he&rsquo;s been wanting to have since 4th year. You stared. After Molly and Remus told you that Sirius has been out of Azkaban for a while and he&rsquo;s been living in Grimmauld place the whole time, you became furious and left. The only time you came back was to go on this mission to save Harry. It seemed that Sirius didn&rsquo;t even know you back in the country.</p><p>Everyone looked between you two, waiting for someone to speak. Molly even tried to say something but Harry quieted her and watched what was about to unfold.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, Y/N.&rdquo; Sirius started, running his hands through his hair.</p><p>That stupid, beautiful hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would I do that to you? How could I make everyone push you away?&rdquo; He started becoming scared under your hard gaze. &ldquo;I needed to Y/N. I couldn&rsquo;t let you live your life waiting for me to get out of Azkaban. You needed to live your life! You always wanted to be a professor and I couldn&rsquo;t hold you back. So yes. I cut you off and made everyone do it too but-&rdquo;</p><p>Sirius has never seen you so quiet. He mistook the silence as anger but you were just admiring how much you loved him, even after all these years and what he has done.</p><p>&ldquo;Please Y/N. Please say something. Tell me I&rsquo;m an idiot or that I had no business in doing what I did. Say that you want me gone and what I did was the worst decision I&rsquo;ve ever made. Shout at me and say you hate me. Say you don&rsquo;t love me anymore.Just&hellip;.say something. Anything&hellip;&hellip; I&rsquo;m begging here&rdquo;</p><p>You walked towards him. Every head in the room tracked your motions and anticipated a fight. Remus quickly glanced at Molly as their eyes were both filled with anxiety.</p><p>You lifted your hand up to his cheek and whispered, &ldquo;I love you as much as you still love me.&rdquo; The words left your mouth and Sirius slammed his lips onto yours, grabbing hold of your waist and lifting you up, Everyone cheered and even Harry had the widest smile on his face.</p></p>",
