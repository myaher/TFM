Prior to even bracing the entrance of the apartment, buzzed in by Seokjin, Jiwoo\u2019s body spirals around the corner from the living room \u2013 belting towards you like a hurricane.</p><p>As soon as his eyes spot yours, his arms reach upward, a shriek of laughter falling from him. Like an adorable catapult, he hurtles himself towards you with every intention of a hug. Without thinking, you accept him \u2013 pulling him quickly into the deepest one you can muster. It\u2019s an odd sensation that hollows the pit of your stomach \u2013 a familiarity laced with an overwhelming happiness at his excitement to see you.</p><p>\u2018____ !,\u2019 He calls your name, burying his head deeply into your neck as his little fists grip on to you. \u2018I missed you. Daddy said you had been busy, and that you couldn\u2019t come and play. But I knew you\u2019d come back!\u2019</p><!-- more --><p>\u2018Hey Buddy, Remember what we talked about?,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s steps fall hollow against the dark wood of his apartment, his tall frame appearing in the entrance just as you let Jiwoo go. \u2018You can\u2019t stay, Uncle Yoongi is coming to pick you up because he wants to take you to get some ice cream.\u2019</p><p>Seokjin\u2019s frame is as tall as you remember it being \u2013 accentuated more by the thick, long grey hoodie falling to the tops of his thighs. It\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve seen him out of a suit \u2013 the tears in his jeans indicating the price tag of fashionably distressed more than actually worn, but still marking that he\u2019d been home long enough to ditch the work attire. A small, creamy patch of skin peeks through just underneath his pocket, drawing your eye in instantly.</p><p>Even in the more casual attire he still radiates a ridiculous amount of attractiveness, and a swell of memories surges through you from the night you\u2019d first met \u2013 his thick, broad shoulders accentuated by the fall of the sweater not helping you in trying to forget how good it had felt to clutch hard against them as he made you come. </p><p>\u2018But Dad\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get ice cream with Uncle Yoongi!\u2019 Jiwoo\u2019s bottom lip protrudes, sticking out as a short huff of air leaves him in protest. Seokjin doesn\u2019t falter \u2013 doesn\u2019t cave to the whim of the four year old, standing resolute in his insistence.</p><p>\u2018But you love ice cream, and you love going places with Uncle Yoongi.,\u2019 He counters smoothly. \u2018Besides, he just text me to say he was parking his car. He even finished work early just to hang out with his little buddy.\u2019</p><p>Jiwoo\u2019s pout doesn\u2019t shift, but his body does \u2013 arms reaching out to cling dramatically to your leg, grip tight and unrelenting.</p><p>\u2018Can\u2019t you come, too?,\u2019 He looks up at you, begging round eyes a spitting image of his fathers. \u2018Uncle Yoongi is cool\u2026 we can go for ice cream and you can talk to him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2026,\u2019 Your glance shifts towards Seokjin for guidance, unsure of how to answer the question without letting the completely endearing Jiwoo down. It\u2019s a strange sight that greets you \u2013 curiosity peeked in Seokjin as he watches, seemingly a judgement of how you\u2019re going to react. Without missing another beat, you kneel down to come face to face with Jiwoo, peeling his hands off your calf and holding them in your own. \u2018I know you really want me to come, Jiwoo. And I really want to come, too. But I have to talk to your Dad about something important. I promise we can get ice cream later.\u2019</p><p>Jiwoo doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to answer, and Seokjin doesn\u2019t have the time to judge, because a sharp knock on the open door draws everyone\u2019s attention to the black t-shirt clad frame that could only be\u2026</p><p>\u2018Uncle Yoongi!,\u2019 Jiwoo\u2019s up \u2013 loyalty to you totally blown to pieces at the appearance of the man who\u2019s name you\u2019d heard fall from his lips so many times. He barrels towards him in exactly the same manner he greeted you, Yoongi\u2019s arms stretching down in preparation to launch the child high in the air with the momentum of his jump, catching him with perfect timing. Jiwoo erupts into giggles, squealing in joy at the motion. \u2018Again!\u2019 He begs.</p><p>\u2018Uncle Yoongi is tired, buddy,\u2019 The man pouts, flipping the white blonde strands of his hair out of his eyes. \u2018I\u2019ve spent all day at work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How was work?\u2019 Seokjin quips as Yoongi balances Jiwoo against his hip, not even batting an eyelid as the child begins picking at the leather strapped necklace gracing his neck.</p><p>\u2018Same old same old\u2026 Mixing stupid songs for stupid artists that can\u2019t fucking sing.,\u2019 He shrugs indifferently, the cuss word coming from his mouth earning him a glare from Seokjin. Jiwoo remains unphased, his tiny hands far too interested in the shiny object attached to the rope. \u2018Joon text. He said he\u2019s keen for a beer after the shit day he\u2019s had. Won\u2019t be until later, though. He\u2019s still working. You wanna join?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why did Uncle Joon have a shit day?\u2019 Jiwoo pipes up, innocent eyes staring questioningly at Yoongi. A chuckle rumbles from the man, bouncing the child\u2019s frame against his hip in amusement.</p><p>\u2018Because, he works at a shit job.\u2019 The answer falls from him without remourse. </p><p>\u2018I hope I don\u2019t have a shit job when I grow up. I want to be like you, Uncle Yoongi\u2026 A pro\u2026 A pro\u2026 prodructer.\u2019 He struggles to spit the difficult world out from his tongue. </p><p>\u2018Jiwoo, don\u2019t say shit\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s quick to scold him, and that pouty lip protrudes once again from Jiwoo \u2013 directed straight towards his father. </p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, Ji-man. As soon as we get into Uncle Yoongi\u2019s car, you can say shit all you want \u2013 okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018And can I get two scoops of ice cream like last time? Dad only lets me get one\u2026\u2019 Jiwoo pushes, fluttering his eyes upwards.</p><p>\u2018Bud, Uncle Yoong will get you three.,\u2019 He accepts the tight hug his promise grants him, kissing the top of Jiwoo\u2019s dark strands before dropping him to the ground. \u2018Put your shoes on so we can get going, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018One.\u2019 It\u2019s hard to miss the word mouthed by Seokjin towards Yoongi as Jiwoo is distracted, running quickly to grab his shoes from their spot near the door.</p><p>\u2018So, you down for a drink tonight?\u2019 Yoongi asks again as Jiwoo prepares himself, struggling to slip his feet into the pair small adidas sneakers. Distracted, you swing yourself around to aid him. </p><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019ll have to play it by ear.,\u2019 Seokjin flicks a quick glimpse in your direction he thinks you won\u2019t notice - a silent mention to Yoongi, who nods back knowingly. \u2018I\u2019ll probably have work tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018All good\u2026 Just let me know, yeah?,\u2019 He refocuses his attention on the little boy, whos shoes are now fastened securely to his feet thanks to you. \u2018Hey, Ji-man, remember what Uncle Yoongi taught you last time?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Square up!\u2019 Jiwoo shouts, hands automatically balling into small fits to over his face, a cheap imitation of a boxing stance. </p><p>\u2018That\u2019s right! Go square up to your Dad and tell him you\u2019re gonna eat three scoops of ice cream, then let\u2019s get going.\u2019 At Yoongi\u2019s suggestion, Jiwoo bounces forward - hands flailing in any direction before making light contact with the denim of Seokjin\u2019s pants - scuffing the material playfully. </p><p>\u2018Sqaure up, Dad!,\u2019 Jiwoo squwaks happily. \u2018I\u2019m gonna eat three scoops of ice cream!\u2019 Seokjin bundles the boy into his arms, broad shoulders stretching down to pin the child\u2019s wild arms to his side in a bear hug. </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m not coming with you\u2026 or you\u2019d get none!,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s next action draws a strong shriek from Jiwoo as his lips raining kisses against his chubby, thick cheeks. Jiwoo\u2019s body struggles, squirming in his father\u2019s grip to fight against the affection. \u2018I love you buddy, I\u2019ll come pick you up from Uncle Yoongi\u2019s later, alright?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I love you too, Daddy.,\u2019 Relenting, Jiwoo sinks into the embrace - tiny arms wrapping around Seokjin\u2019s neck to nuzzle tightly against him. \u2018I\u2019ll miss you.\u2019 It\u2019s a short sentence - a small, immeasurable utterance of three words murmurder just below Seokjin\u2019s ear - but it\u2019s too hard not to notice the swell of Seokjin\u2019s chest puffing out happily. </p><p>\u2018Right Ji-man\u2026 Let\u2019s go. Uncle Yoongi\u2019s double parked.\u2019 Yoongi presses, watching as Seokjin gives him a final squeeze before </p><p>\u2018Wait\u2026,\u2019 Jiwoo wiggles from underneath Seokjin\u2019s palms, skipping his way towards you. \u2018Bye, ____ . I love you.\u2019 He flings his arms around your neck, and it\u2019s only then that you realise you\u2019ve been crouched on the floor down by the shoes far to long for it not to be awkward. Giving him a swift pat on the back, endeared by his remembrance of you, you watch as he waves his final goodbyes before he disappears out the door, hand in hand with the man that had promised him three scoops of ice cream. </p><p>\u2018Three scoops, huh?,\u2019 Hands dusting lightly over your jeans to smooth out the wrinkles in the denim, you straighten your body, stepping out of your shoes and up onto the small ledge that distinguishes between the entrance and the hardwood floor of Seokjin\u2019s luxurious apartment. \u2018That\u2019s a lot of ice cream for such a little guy.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Eh, Tell me about it\u2026 Yoongi\u2019s not the one that has to put a four year old with that much sugar in his system to bed. Sometimes I wonder if he does it to torture me\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin steps towards you, arms opening up to draw you into a half hug. The strong, wafting scent of his cologne sinks into you - filtering through to a foggy bank of memories you have from that night. \u2018How have you been, anyway?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been alright. Mmm\u2026 You smell good.,\u2019 Throwing the compliment to ease the awkward tension growing between the both of you, you take the opportunity as you step back to view him once more - taking in the soft warmth of the more casual style he had adopted for today. It seems to work, and the heaviness of the conversation you\u2019re about to undertake slips slightly in the form of a smile from him. \u00a0\u2018This is the first time I haven\u2019t seen you in a suit, you know?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Do you approve?\u2019 A light chuckle falls from his lips, cheeks perking as his mouth creases upwards. Although you\u2019re sure it wasn\u2019t his intent, a crackle of energy sparks inside you, causing a tinge of heat to threaten your cheeks.</p><p>\u2018Most definitely.\u2019 You hold his gaze as you speak, shoulders staunch in their resolve not to let him know the effect he was having on you. God, it was just too easy to fall back into flirting with him. </p><p>\u2018Come in\u2026 come in\u2026,\u2019 He steps back, freeing space for you to pace next to him. \u2018I appreciate you coming here. I know it was a big ask, especially considering last time\u2026 but Jiwoo was really excited to see you, right?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yeah. If only briefly. He\u2019s a really cute kid, Seokjin.,\u2019 Trailing ever so slightly behind him, you make your way through the apartment, instantly spying two wine glasses set out on the table, one half filled that had evidently been consumed by Seokjin. \u2018I like him a lot.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I think the feeling is pretty mutual\u2026 He hasn\u2019t stopped talking about you since you looked after him. He\u2019s grown quite fond of </p><p>friend ____ . Keeps asking when you\u2019re coming around again.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Liquid courage?\u2019 It\u2019s you that chuckles this time, a lazy hand motioning to the spread of glasses on the table. </p><p>\u2018Something like that\u2026\u2019 He flattens his puffy lips, a rough burst of air causing them to vibrate heavily as he lets out a sigh. \u2018I\u2019m not drunk\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t do that, not while I\u2019m looking after Jiwoo. I was gonna wait until you got here, but I just thought fuck it and had half a glass.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What is so bad that you have to drink to tell me?\u2019 The heaviness of the room expands, and you sense that Seokjin\u2019s usually happy and jovial personality had been sinking quickly since the departure of his son. The fact that he\u2019d consumed half a glass of wine before you\u2019d even arrived, though\u2026 that was news. </p><p>\u2018Take a seat, I\u2019ll pour you a glass and we can get started.\u2019 Like a true gentleman, he pulls the chair our, hand sweeping over it in a grand gesture. Even nervous, he oozes the well bred mannerisms that had drawn you to him that night in the club. As you sit, he allows his hand to dust over your shoulder lightly - a gentle, airy touch that without your history you would have thought unintentional. But, it lingers just a little too long for you not to feel that deep pull of attraction again. </p><p>Sitting, you watch as he grabs the bottle - wrist twisting upwards to pour the red liquid. It sloshes freely into the cup, dark amber and clear. No doubt an expensive vintage. </p><p>\u2018Cheers.,\u2019 After he sits, you raise your glass towards him, saluting it high in the air. \u2018To liquid courage and friendship.\u2019 Your line makes Seokjin laugh, and he quickly mimicks you by raising his glass to clink against yours. </p><p>A brief, awkward silence falls between the both of you. </p><p>\u2018God\u2026 where do I even start\u2026\u2019 He sighs deeply after he drinks in a large sip. He\u2019d need more help than you thought\u2026 perhaps a direct line of questioning would be the ice breaker needed?</p><p>\u2018Well, what about Jiwoo\u2019s Mum?,\u2019 The wine is deeply rich, the fruity tang of the tannins bursting over your tongue as you hold it to savour the taste. \u2018How did you meet her? That should be pretty straight forward, right?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018In a club\u2026 Our stories were pretty similar, actually\u2026 I was drunk, she was drunk\u2026 I was hot, she was hot\u2026 Drunk and hot seems to be kinda my thing.,\u2019 His head dips as he shakes the shaggy strands from his eyes, playful smirk peeking out from behind his dark locks. \u2018I used to\u2026 uhhh\u2026 go out a little bit more back then. I ran into her a few more times, through mutual friends and stuff\u2026 one thing lead to another, and we were dating.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Well, that all seems pretty typical? What\u2019s so bad about that?\u2019 You swallow again, drawing the juice slowly into your mouth as you peer at Seokjin from over the rim of the crystal. </p><p>\u2018I guess my parents never really liked her\u2026,\u2019 A dismissive shrug. Another sip of wine, his fat, full lips turning slightly reddish from the liquid. The shine of the wetness made them look even more inviting. \u2018My father always told me she was really bad. That she only saw dollar signs in me\u2026 god, he couldn\u2019t have been more right. But\u2026 you know, when you think you\u2019re in love.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018So you weren\u2019t really in love?\u2019 It\u2019s easy to prompt him now that he\u2019s started. Seokjin was a natural talker, and the words were spilling freely from his mouth. </p><p>\u2018Maybe I was.,\u2019 Absently, he shrugs. \u2018She wasn\u2019t, though. It became pretty clear what she wanted when Jiwoo happened\u2026\u2019 His eyes dart away, the mention of his son\u2019s name triggering something deeper to stir inside him. </p><p>\u2018Jin, you don\u2019t have to tell me, if you don\u2019t want to\u2026,\u2019 A single hand comes up to rest against his forearm, the warmth of your touch causing his gaze to refocus, staring straight into you. \u2018I mean\u2026 I know what Jiwoo means to you. You don\u2019t have to tell me this, if it\u2019s going to hurt you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018____.,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s hand shifts up to rest over your fingers, cupping his knuckles over yours. \u2018Is it weird that you\u2019re the first girl I\u2019ve felt comfortable talking about this with? I mean, I was scared\u2026 but seeing how Jiwoo is with you - it really makes me feel like I can trust you. Plus, you deserve to know. Especially when I was such a dick to you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m listening\u2019 A warm hearted smile dusts your lips, Seokjin\u2019s sentiment sinking through the caress of his palm into you. Despite the conversation, it felt oddly intimate to be so close to him. </p><p>\u2018So Jiwoo\u2026 He\u2019s the best thing that happened to me, don\u2019t get me wrong. I would not live my life any other way. But, his conception was\u2026 a surprise, to put it nicely. I guess younger me thought I was infallible - like most men in their early 20s who put pleasure before logic - and with some alcohol it wasn\u2019t difficult to convince me not to use a condom. I did what I thought was right, bought a ring on the credit card my father let me have.,\u2019 Another sip from the glass. \u2018He is a CEO. Well, was a CEO at the time. I\u2019m not talking little league stuff, either. This is really dragging on, though\u2026 basically, he thought she got pregnant on purpose and refused to let me marry her. I wanted to marry her anyway, and as a result he cut me off. No money, no support\u2026 he hasn\u2019t ever seen his only Grandson, actually.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What?,\u2019 Your jaw slacks, and it\u2019s Seokjin\u2019s hand that squeezes yours in comfort this time. \u2018But Jiwoo is\u2026 Jiwoo. He\u2019s adorable.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to tell me that twice.,\u2019 A smile cracks across his lips\u2026 one that sinks it\u2019s way upwards and just brushes his eyes in the form of slightly crinkled crows feet. \u2018But, just to flatter my genetics, you can\u2026\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Jin, I\u2019ve never met a kid like Jiwoo. He\u2019s so cute. I can\u2019t believe your father wouldn\u2019t want to meet him.\u2019 Still happy, the smile perks across Seokjin\u2019s face more, his free hand coming to rub ever so slightly across your chin affectionately. It\u2019s meant playfully, but the gesture is highly intimate and you can feel the way your own body betrays you by nuzzling into it.</p><p>\u2018The way I see it, it\u2019s my Dad\u2019s loss. People who appreciate Jiwoo deserve him in their life. People who make the effort to ensure his happiness, are worthy of him. He\u2019s got a great bunch of people who shower him with affection. He knows he is loved. He doesn\u2019t need my Dad around. Actually, my Dad would be lucky to have </p><p>around.,\u2019 His fingers splay lightly against your fingers, tracing slow circles as his free one leaves your face and picks up the wine to suck another sip. \u2018Take Yoongi, for example. You probably picked up that he\u2019s unique. Not everyone appreciates that I let him spend so much time around my kid. But, he always has Jiwoo in his heart - and Jiwoo loves him more than anything. Yoongi makes time for him, always has and always will. Yoongi makes him feel loved and appreciated. Always has, and always will. When I had nothing, Yoongi was one of the first to step in and offer me a place to stay with Jiwoo. Between him and Joon, in some weird and fucked up kinda way, we built a little family. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019 </p><p>Your mind flashes back to the man shrouded in the doorway, his initial dark and brooding form softening as soon as Jiwoo had sprinted towards him. He\u2019d barely said a word to you, barely acknowledged your existence - but there was no mistaking the love he\u2019d shown that kid. Despite the swearing and the promise of too much ice cream, it was obvious he had a deep connection with the child. </p><p>\u2018So, after your father cut you off, what happened?,\u2019 You drag another deep sip from your glass, eager to hear the rest of his story. </p><p>\u2018Well, this is the part that hurts the most\u2026 so excuse me, I\u2019m just gonna top up my vessle.\u2019 Before he can reach for the bottle, you\u2019ve clutched it - quickly pouring the contents to refil his almost empty wine. </p><p>\u2018Here, let me.\u2019 It\u2019s an excuse to free yourself from his hand. It was feeling far too good, having the comfort of his fingers lacing against your skin to soothe you. Feeling far too familiar as he warmed the flesh on the back of your hand, soaking his attention through to your bones. You needed an escape, because tonight you didn\u2019t want to end up in his bed. </p><p>Once you\u2019re done, your hands slip under the table - falling squarely on your knees as a form of security. Seokjin bobs his head in appreciation before taking another sip. </p><p>\u2018Okay, so\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin breathes deeply. \u2018I married Jiwoo\u2019s mother, against my father\u2019s wishes. It was a paper only wedding, because I had no support for an actually celebration. It was a pretty rude awakening, going from CEO\u2019s son to dirt poor literally overnight&hellip; We skipped around cheap apartments for a bit - I had a bit of savings that covered us while she was pregnant, but not much. No one tells you how expensive babies are, even before they are born. We had to get scans and prenatals and go to doctors appointments. By the time Jiwoo was out, I had about a dollar to my name. I\u2019m just lucky that Yoongi let us live with them, and Joon helped out when he could afford to spare some extra cash. They were both just starting out, but\u2026\u2019 He sighs, dipping his head deeply as he looks down towards his lap - attempting to hide the shame dancing across his cheeks. </p><p>It\u2019s you that reaches out your hand, breaking your own rule to rest it across his ando stroke over the low bend in his knuckles. It was almost instinctive, as you watched the emotion swell in his shoulders, hunching them protectively to shield his face. It takes him a while to collect himself, to breathe deeply enough to soothe the troubled emotions threatening to spill from his eyes. </p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 You probe, fingers twisting around his wrist to squeeze it reassuringly. It\u2019s a few moments before he speaks, his head not lifting to greet yours. </p><p>\u2018Jiwoo completely changed my life. He motivated me to start my company, get my life together\u2026 I know I work hard, and sometimes I\u2019m trying to balance too much by looking after him and working in such a high pressure job. We just keep growing and become more and more successful - I\u2019ve got enough money in my bank now to provide for him, and some spare for enjoying a fine wine with beautiful woman every now and again. But it\u2019s taken a lot of sweat and tears to get here. I\u2019d do it all over in a heartbeat for him.,\u2019 Still glancing down, the deep sniff rattling through his chest notifies you something is dangerously off. \u2018It really hurts when I think about his Mum\u2026 how she can\u2019t see it like I do. My Dad, I can let that go\u2026 I never really expected him to have a relationship with Jiwoo. But his Mum? She couldn\u2019t care less about him, aside from the child support. My Dad was dead right. All she saw in me was dollar signs, and now all she sees in her son is more dollar signs.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Jin, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a pathetic, empty sentence that you know offers little comfort to him - but what else could you say? </p><p>\u2018If I had my way, she wouldn\u2019t get to take him at all. It\u2019s exhausting. The irregular schedules she keeps - dropping him off half way through a mandated custody arrangement because she\u2019s sick of looking after him. The way I have to think of suck quick lies to stop him from understanding that his own Mum doesn\u2019t even care enough to look after him\u2026,\u2019 His shoulders shudder, and when he stretches up - his eyes are much clearer than you\u2019d anticipated, only slightly redder and wider than usual. \u2018You know, I thought I could talk about this without getting emotional\u2026 But it just hurts, thinking about it all. There is still a lot more to Jiwoo\u2019s story\u2026 I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to drink enough wine to get through it all tonight.\u2019 </p><p>As he sits there, red eyes glistening with tears he\u2019d faught so hard to keep from falling, a stitch of regret works it\u2019s way through the pit of your stomach. It had always been obvious to you that Seokjin cared for Jiwoo, and would do anything to help him. But the ferocity with which he had defended his actions last time you met made so much more sense, now that you knew the backstory behind it all\u2026 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m usually not that into conspiracy theories, but is this your way of trying to see me again?,\u2019 The jest is meant to lighten the air - to ease the tension that was hunched deeply in Seokjin\u2019s broad and wide shoulders. It works, because as your hand soothes over his and a light laugh dances from his lips, they slack slightly as he relaxes. \u2018I might not have a fancy vintage wine from my personal cellar, but I do have two thirds of a bottle of cheap vodka I\u2019m more than willing to share.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018God, I can see why Jiwoo likes you so much\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s gaze settles on you - the smile remaining on his lips as he leans slightly closer to close the gap between your bodies over the corner of the table you were seated at. He studies you - eyes scanning yours, searching for a short hint of something you were unsure of. \u2018He\u2019s always been a good judge of character.\u2019 </p><p>What happens next is so surreal, it almost feels like a scene from a movie. </p><p>As Seokjin moves in, you find yourself mirroring his stance, your own torso angling itself towards the musky wood notes of his perfume coming towards you as he invades your space. The approach is slow and mutual, both of you edging closer to each other at equal speeds. It shouldn\u2019t surprise you when your lips meet - not when both of you had been so generously touchy with each other so far - but somehow it does. </p><p>It\u2019s a soft bump at first - a subtle, testing peck that doesn\u2019t take much effort from either of you. But god, you\u2019d be lying if the plump curve of Seokjin\u2019s juiced lips didn\u2019t feel too good for you to want more. Slick and wet from the wine, they\u2019re even softer than you remember them being - the perfect amount of moistness. </p><p>He must taste something he likes, too, because soon you are together again - mouths parted slightly, cushioning sweetly as you kiss. It\u2019s not long before his tongue probes, parting your lips to slip past your teeth, caressing against your own. The bold flavours of the cab sav are muted slightly by his saliva, but the roll of the muscle against your own has a flood of need hurtling straight towards your core - the taste so similar to when you\u2019d first met, that you can hardly control the squeeze of your thighs closer together. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t do this. No matter how much you wanted it, it wasn\u2019t fair to Seokjin - not when he\u2019d made such an effort to attempt to explain his situation, putting himself in such a vulnerable position in the process. </p><p>\u2018Jin\u2026 Wait\u2026\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Shit, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026 That was not meant to happen.,\u2019 Seokjin pulls back, tugging at the neck of his hoodie to fan himself. A deep crimson shade has begun to creep over his neck, stretching ruthlessly upwards as he attempts to unfluster his motions. \u2018I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. I liked it a lot. I just don\u2019t want to think I asked you to come so we would\u2026 well, you know.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yeah, Jin\u2026 It\u2019s fine. I liked it too.,\u2019 Smiling gently, you shake your head slightly - giggling at the red that continues to creep higher, hitting his throat. \u2018It was nice. But I don\u2019t want to jump into anything after a conversation that heavy, you know?\u2019 He nods in understanding. </p><p>\u2018You know, I promised Jiwoo that I\u2019d take him zoo. I haven\u2019t gotten around to it, but I have a day off on Sunday\u2026 I just wanted to say that Jiwoo really, really likes you. Whatever you did when you looked after him made a big impression on the kid. I know I snapped the other day, but things with his Mum haven\u2019t been easy lately. They\u2019re getting a lot harder, too. It\u2019s not an excuse, but it\u2019s been difficult trying to be rational about that kind of stuff. I just want the best for him, and I really took my stress out on you. I\u2019m really, really sorry\u2026,\u2019 The soft furrow of his brow shows his sincerity as he speaks. \u2018I really think you\u2019re good for Jiwoo. He\u2019s got a knack for attracting good people. I hope I didn\u2019t put you off\u2026 and if I did, again I\u2019m really sorry. But, if you\u2019re available, you\u2019re free to join us?\u2019 </p><p>Seeing Seokjin open up had told you so much about him - so much about what you needed to know to continue any kind of friendship with both him and his son. It was crystal clear to you now that he wasn\u2019t an irrationally angry man. He was just fiercly protective of his son, and the life he\u2019d created for them. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for you to consider your answer. </p><p>\u2018Do they have penguins at the zoo? If so, I\u2019m in. They\u2019re my favourite.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018That\u2019s funny\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s smile broadens as he chuckles. \u2018They\u2019re Jiwoo\u2019s favourite, too.\u2019 </p>",

Prior to even bracing the entrance of the apartment, buzzed in by Seokjin, Jiwoo\u2019s body spirals around the corner from the living room \u2013 belting towards you like a hurricane.</p><p>As soon as his eyes spot yours, his arms reach upward, a shriek of laughter falling from him. Like an adorable catapult, he hurtles himself towards you with every intention of a hug. Without thinking, you accept him \u2013 pulling him quickly into the deepest one you can muster. It\u2019s an odd sensation that hollows the pit of your stomach \u2013 a familiarity laced with an overwhelming happiness at his excitement to see you.</p><p>\u2018____ !,\u2019 He calls your name, burying his head deeply into your neck as his little fists grip on to you. \u2018I missed you. Daddy said you had been busy, and that you couldn\u2019t come and play. But I knew you\u2019d come back!\u2019</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2018Hey Buddy, Remember what we talked about?,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s steps fall hollow against the dark wood of his apartment, his tall frame appearing in the entrance just as you let Jiwoo go. \u2018You can\u2019t stay, Uncle Yoongi is coming to pick you up because he wants to take you to get some ice cream.\u2019</p><p>Seokjin\u2019s frame is as tall as you remember it being \u2013 accentuated more by the thick, long grey hoodie falling to the tops of his thighs. It\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve seen him out of a suit \u2013 the tears in his jeans indicating the price tag of fashionably distressed more than actually worn, but still marking that he\u2019d been home long enough to ditch the work attire. A small, creamy patch of skin peeks through just underneath his pocket, drawing your eye in instantly.</p><p>Even in the more casual attire he still radiates a ridiculous amount of attractiveness, and a swell of memories surges through you from the night you\u2019d first met \u2013 his thick, broad shoulders accentuated by the fall of the sweater not helping you in trying to forget how good it had felt to clutch hard against them as he made you come. </p><p>\u2018But Dad\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get ice cream with Uncle Yoongi!\u2019 Jiwoo\u2019s bottom lip protrudes, sticking out as a short huff of air leaves him in protest. Seokjin doesn\u2019t falter \u2013 doesn\u2019t cave to the whim of the four year old, standing resolute in his insistence.</p><p>\u2018But you love ice cream, and you love going places with Uncle Yoongi.,\u2019 He counters smoothly. \u2018Besides, he just text me to say he was parking his car. He even finished work early just to hang out with his little buddy.\u2019</p><p>Jiwoo\u2019s pout doesn\u2019t shift, but his body does \u2013 arms reaching out to cling dramatically to your leg, grip tight and unrelenting.</p><p>\u2018Can\u2019t you come, too?,\u2019 He looks up at you, begging round eyes a spitting image of his fathers. \u2018Uncle Yoongi is cool\u2026 we can go for ice cream and you can talk to him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2026,\u2019 Your glance shifts towards Seokjin for guidance, unsure of how to answer the question without letting the completely endearing Jiwoo down. It\u2019s a strange sight that greets you \u2013 curiosity peeked in Seokjin as he watches, seemingly a judgement of how you\u2019re going to react. Without missing another beat, you kneel down to come face to face with Jiwoo, peeling his hands off your calf and holding them in your own. \u2018I know you really want me to come, Jiwoo. And I really want to come, too. But I have to talk to your Dad about something important. I promise we can get ice cream later.\u2019</p><p>Jiwoo doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to answer, and Seokjin doesn\u2019t have the time to judge, because a sharp knock on the open door draws everyone\u2019s attention to the black t-shirt clad frame that could only be\u2026</p><p>\u2018Uncle Yoongi!,\u2019 Jiwoo\u2019s up \u2013 loyalty to you totally blown to pieces at the appearance of the man who\u2019s name you\u2019d heard fall from his lips so many times. He barrels towards him in exactly the same manner he greeted you, Yoongi\u2019s arms stretching down in preparation to launch the child high in the air with the momentum of his jump, catching him with perfect timing. Jiwoo erupts into giggles, squealing in joy at the motion. \u2018Again!\u2019 He begs.</p><p>\u2018Uncle Yoongi is tired, buddy,\u2019 The man pouts, flipping the white blonde strands of his hair out of his eyes. \u2018I\u2019ve spent all day at work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How was work?\u2019 Seokjin quips as Yoongi balances Jiwoo against his hip, not even batting an eyelid as the child begins picking at the leather strapped necklace gracing his neck.</p><p>\u2018Same old same old\u2026 Mixing stupid songs for stupid artists that can\u2019t fucking sing.,\u2019 He shrugs indifferently, the cuss word coming from his mouth earning him a glare from Seokjin. Jiwoo remains unphased, his tiny hands far too interested in the shiny object attached to the rope. \u2018Joon text. He said he\u2019s keen for a beer after the shit day he\u2019s had. Won\u2019t be until later, though. He\u2019s still working. You wanna join?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why did Uncle Joon have a shit day?\u2019 Jiwoo pipes up, innocent eyes staring questioningly at Yoongi. A chuckle rumbles from the man, bouncing the child\u2019s frame against his hip in amusement.</p><p>\u2018Because, he works at a shit job.\u2019 The answer falls from him without remourse. </p><p>\u2018I hope I don\u2019t have a shit job when I grow up. I want to be like you, Uncle Yoongi\u2026 A pro\u2026 A pro\u2026 prodructer.\u2019 He struggles to spit the difficult world out from his tongue. </p><p>\u2018Jiwoo, don\u2019t say shit\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s quick to scold him, and that pouty lip protrudes once again from Jiwoo \u2013 directed straight towards his father. </p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, Ji-man. As soon as we get into Uncle Yoongi\u2019s car, you can say shit all you want \u2013 okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018And can I get two scoops of ice cream like last time? Dad only lets me get one\u2026\u2019 Jiwoo pushes, fluttering his eyes upwards.</p><p>\u2018Bud, Uncle Yoong will get you three.,\u2019 He accepts the tight hug his promise grants him, kissing the top of Jiwoo\u2019s dark strands before dropping him to the ground. \u2018Put your shoes on so we can get going, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018One.\u2019 It\u2019s hard to miss the word mouthed by Seokjin towards Yoongi as Jiwoo is distracted, running quickly to grab his shoes from their spot near the door.</p><p>\u2018So, you down for a drink tonight?\u2019 Yoongi asks again as Jiwoo prepares himself, struggling to slip his feet into the pair small adidas sneakers. Distracted, you swing yourself around to aid him. </p><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019ll have to play it by ear.,\u2019 Seokjin flicks a quick glimpse in your direction he thinks you won\u2019t notice - a silent mention to Yoongi, who nods back knowingly. \u2018I\u2019ll probably have work tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018All good\u2026 Just let me know, yeah?,\u2019 He refocuses his attention on the little boy, whos shoes are now fastened securely to his feet thanks to you. \u2018Hey, Ji-man, remember what Uncle Yoongi taught you last time?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Square up!\u2019 Jiwoo shouts, hands automatically balling into small fits to over his face, a cheap imitation of a boxing stance. </p><p>\u2018That\u2019s right! Go square up to your Dad and tell him you\u2019re gonna eat three scoops of ice cream, then let\u2019s get going.\u2019 At Yoongi\u2019s suggestion, Jiwoo bounces forward - hands flailing in any direction before making light contact with the denim of Seokjin\u2019s pants - scuffing the material playfully. </p><p>\u2018Sqaure up, Dad!,\u2019 Jiwoo squwaks happily. \u2018I\u2019m gonna eat three scoops of ice cream!\u2019 Seokjin bundles the boy into his arms, broad shoulders stretching down to pin the child\u2019s wild arms to his side in a bear hug. </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m not coming with you\u2026 or you\u2019d get none!,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s next action draws a strong shriek from Jiwoo as his lips raining kisses against his chubby, thick cheeks. Jiwoo\u2019s body struggles, squirming in his father\u2019s grip to fight against the affection. \u2018I love you buddy, I\u2019ll come pick you up from Uncle Yoongi\u2019s later, alright?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I love you too, Daddy.,\u2019 Relenting, Jiwoo sinks into the embrace - tiny arms wrapping around Seokjin\u2019s neck to nuzzle tightly against him. \u2018I\u2019ll miss you.\u2019 It\u2019s a short sentence - a small, immeasurable utterance of three words murmurder just below Seokjin\u2019s ear - but it\u2019s too hard not to notice the swell of Seokjin\u2019s chest puffing out happily. </p><p>\u2018Right Ji-man\u2026 Let\u2019s go. Uncle Yoongi\u2019s double parked.\u2019 Yoongi presses, watching as Seokjin gives him a final squeeze before </p><p>\u2018Wait\u2026,\u2019 Jiwoo wiggles from underneath Seokjin\u2019s palms, skipping his way towards you. \u2018Bye, ____ . I love you.\u2019 He flings his arms around your neck, and it\u2019s only then that you realise you\u2019ve been crouched on the floor down by the shoes far to long for it not to be awkward. Giving him a swift pat on the back, endeared by his remembrance of you, you watch as he waves his final goodbyes before he disappears out the door, hand in hand with the man that had promised him three scoops of ice cream. </p><p>\u2018Three scoops, huh?,\u2019 Hands dusting lightly over your jeans to smooth out the wrinkles in the denim, you straighten your body, stepping out of your shoes and up onto the small ledge that distinguishes between the entrance and the hardwood floor of Seokjin\u2019s luxurious apartment. \u2018That\u2019s a lot of ice cream for such a little guy.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Eh, Tell me about it\u2026 Yoongi\u2019s not the one that has to put a four year old with that much sugar in his system to bed. Sometimes I wonder if he does it to torture me\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin steps towards you, arms opening up to draw you into a half hug. The strong, wafting scent of his cologne sinks into you - filtering through to a foggy bank of memories you have from that night. \u2018How have you been, anyway?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been alright. Mmm\u2026 You smell good.,\u2019 Throwing the compliment to ease the awkward tension growing between the both of you, you take the opportunity as you step back to view him once more - taking in the soft warmth of the more casual style he had adopted for today. It seems to work, and the heaviness of the conversation you\u2019re about to undertake slips slightly in the form of a smile from him. \u00a0\u2018This is the first time I haven\u2019t seen you in a suit, you know?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Do you approve?\u2019 A light chuckle falls from his lips, cheeks perking as his mouth creases upwards. Although you\u2019re sure it wasn\u2019t his intent, a crackle of energy sparks inside you, causing a tinge of heat to threaten your cheeks.</p><p>\u2018Most definitely.\u2019 You hold his gaze as you speak, shoulders staunch in their resolve not to let him know the effect he was having on you. God, it was just too easy to fall back into flirting with him. </p><p>\u2018Come in\u2026 come in\u2026,\u2019 He steps back, freeing space for you to pace next to him. \u2018I appreciate you coming here. I know it was a big ask, especially considering last time\u2026 but Jiwoo was really excited to see you, right?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yeah. If only briefly. He\u2019s a really cute kid, Seokjin.,\u2019 Trailing ever so slightly behind him, you make your way through the apartment, instantly spying two wine glasses set out on the table, one half filled that had evidently been consumed by Seokjin. \u2018I like him a lot.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I think the feeling is pretty mutual\u2026 He hasn\u2019t stopped talking about you since you looked after him. He\u2019s grown quite fond of </p><p>friend ____ . Keeps asking when you\u2019re coming around again.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Liquid courage?\u2019 It\u2019s you that chuckles this time, a lazy hand motioning to the spread of glasses on the table. </p><p>\u2018Something like that\u2026\u2019 He flattens his puffy lips, a rough burst of air causing them to vibrate heavily as he lets out a sigh. \u2018I\u2019m not drunk\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t do that, not while I\u2019m looking after Jiwoo. I was gonna wait until you got here, but I just thought fuck it and had half a glass.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What is so bad that you have to drink to tell me?\u2019 The heaviness of the room expands, and you sense that Seokjin\u2019s usually happy and jovial personality had been sinking quickly since the departure of his son. The fact that he\u2019d consumed half a glass of wine before you\u2019d even arrived, though\u2026 that was news. </p><p>\u2018Take a seat, I\u2019ll pour you a glass and we can get started.\u2019 Like a true gentleman, he pulls the chair our, hand sweeping over it in a grand gesture. Even nervous, he oozes the well bred mannerisms that had drawn you to him that night in the club. As you sit, he allows his hand to dust over your shoulder lightly - a gentle, airy touch that without your history you would have thought unintentional. But, it lingers just a little too long for you not to feel that deep pull of attraction again. </p><p>Sitting, you watch as he grabs the bottle - wrist twisting upwards to pour the red liquid. It sloshes freely into the cup, dark amber and clear. No doubt an expensive vintage. </p><p>\u2018Cheers.,\u2019 After he sits, you raise your glass towards him, saluting it high in the air. \u2018To liquid courage and friendship.\u2019 Your line makes Seokjin laugh, and he quickly mimicks you by raising his glass to clink against yours. </p><p>A brief, awkward silence falls between the both of you. </p><p>\u2018God\u2026 where do I even start\u2026\u2019 He sighs deeply after he drinks in a large sip. He\u2019d need more help than you thought\u2026 perhaps a direct line of questioning would be the ice breaker needed?</p><p>\u2018Well, what about Jiwoo\u2019s Mum?,\u2019 The wine is deeply rich, the fruity tang of the tannins bursting over your tongue as you hold it to savour the taste. \u2018How did you meet her? That should be pretty straight forward, right?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018In a club\u2026 Our stories were pretty similar, actually\u2026 I was drunk, she was drunk\u2026 I was hot, she was hot\u2026 Drunk and hot seems to be kinda my thing.,\u2019 His head dips as he shakes the shaggy strands from his eyes, playful smirk peeking out from behind his dark locks. \u2018I used to\u2026 uhhh\u2026 go out a little bit more back then. I ran into her a few more times, through mutual friends and stuff\u2026 one thing lead to another, and we were dating.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Well, that all seems pretty typical? What\u2019s so bad about that?\u2019 You swallow again, drawing the juice slowly into your mouth as you peer at Seokjin from over the rim of the crystal. </p><p>\u2018I guess my parents never really liked her\u2026,\u2019 A dismissive shrug. Another sip of wine, his fat, full lips turning slightly reddish from the liquid. The shine of the wetness made them look even more inviting. \u2018My father always told me she was really bad. That she only saw dollar signs in me\u2026 god, he couldn\u2019t have been more right. But\u2026 you know, when you think you\u2019re in love.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018So you weren\u2019t really in love?\u2019 It\u2019s easy to prompt him now that he\u2019s started. Seokjin was a natural talker, and the words were spilling freely from his mouth. </p><p>\u2018Maybe I was.,\u2019 Absently, he shrugs. \u2018She wasn\u2019t, though. It became pretty clear what she wanted when Jiwoo happened\u2026\u2019 His eyes dart away, the mention of his son\u2019s name triggering something deeper to stir inside him. </p><p>\u2018Jin, you don\u2019t have to tell me, if you don\u2019t want to\u2026,\u2019 A single hand comes up to rest against his forearm, the warmth of your touch causing his gaze to refocus, staring straight into you. \u2018I mean\u2026 I know what Jiwoo means to you. You don\u2019t have to tell me this, if it\u2019s going to hurt you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018____.,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s hand shifts up to rest over your fingers, cupping his knuckles over yours. \u2018Is it weird that you\u2019re the first girl I\u2019ve felt comfortable talking about this with? I mean, I was scared\u2026 but seeing how Jiwoo is with you - it really makes me feel like I can trust you. Plus, you deserve to know. Especially when I was such a dick to you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m listening\u2019 A warm hearted smile dusts your lips, Seokjin\u2019s sentiment sinking through the caress of his palm into you. Despite the conversation, it felt oddly intimate to be so close to him. </p><p>\u2018So Jiwoo\u2026 He\u2019s the best thing that happened to me, don\u2019t get me wrong. I would not live my life any other way. But, his conception was\u2026 a surprise, to put it nicely. I guess younger me thought I was infallible - like most men in their early 20s who put pleasure before logic - and with some alcohol it wasn\u2019t difficult to convince me not to use a condom. I did what I thought was right, bought a ring on the credit card my father let me have.,\u2019 Another sip from the glass. \u2018He is a CEO. Well, was a CEO at the time. I\u2019m not talking little league stuff, either. This is really dragging on, though\u2026 basically, he thought she got pregnant on purpose and refused to let me marry her. I wanted to marry her anyway, and as a result he cut me off. No money, no support\u2026 he hasn\u2019t ever seen his only Grandson, actually.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What?,\u2019 Your jaw slacks, and it\u2019s Seokjin\u2019s hand that squeezes yours in comfort this time. \u2018But Jiwoo is\u2026 Jiwoo. He\u2019s adorable.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to tell me that twice.,\u2019 A smile cracks across his lips\u2026 one that sinks it\u2019s way upwards and just brushes his eyes in the form of slightly crinkled crows feet. \u2018But, just to flatter my genetics, you can\u2026\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Jin, I\u2019ve never met a kid like Jiwoo. He\u2019s so cute. I can\u2019t believe your father wouldn\u2019t want to meet him.\u2019 Still happy, the smile perks across Seokjin\u2019s face more, his free hand coming to rub ever so slightly across your chin affectionately. It\u2019s meant playfully, but the gesture is highly intimate and you can feel the way your own body betrays you by nuzzling into it.</p><p>\u2018The way I see it, it\u2019s my Dad\u2019s loss. People who appreciate Jiwoo deserve him in their life. People who make the effort to ensure his happiness, are worthy of him. He\u2019s got a great bunch of people who shower him with affection. He knows he is loved. He doesn\u2019t need my Dad around. Actually, my Dad would be lucky to have </p><p>around.,\u2019 His fingers splay lightly against your fingers, tracing slow circles as his free one leaves your face and picks up the wine to suck another sip. \u2018Take Yoongi, for example. You probably picked up that he\u2019s unique. Not everyone appreciates that I let him spend so much time around my kid. But, he always has Jiwoo in his heart - and Jiwoo loves him more than anything. Yoongi makes time for him, always has and always will. Yoongi makes him feel loved and appreciated. Always has, and always will. When I had nothing, Yoongi was one of the first to step in and offer me a place to stay with Jiwoo. Between him and Joon, in some weird and fucked up kinda way, we built a little family. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019 </p><p>Your mind flashes back to the man shrouded in the doorway, his initial dark and brooding form softening as soon as Jiwoo had sprinted towards him. He\u2019d barely said a word to you, barely acknowledged your existence - but there was no mistaking the love he\u2019d shown that kid. Despite the swearing and the promise of too much ice cream, it was obvious he had a deep connection with the child. </p><p>\u2018So, after your father cut you off, what happened?,\u2019 You drag another deep sip from your glass, eager to hear the rest of his story. </p><p>\u2018Well, this is the part that hurts the most\u2026 so excuse me, I\u2019m just gonna top up my vessle.\u2019 Before he can reach for the bottle, you\u2019ve clutched it - quickly pouring the contents to refil his almost empty wine. </p><p>\u2018Here, let me.\u2019 It\u2019s an excuse to free yourself from his hand. It was feeling far too good, having the comfort of his fingers lacing against your skin to soothe you. Feeling far too familiar as he warmed the flesh on the back of your hand, soaking his attention through to your bones. You needed an escape, because tonight you didn\u2019t want to end up in his bed. </p><p>Once you\u2019re done, your hands slip under the table - falling squarely on your knees as a form of security. Seokjin bobs his head in appreciation before taking another sip. </p><p>\u2018Okay, so\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin breathes deeply. \u2018I married Jiwoo\u2019s mother, against my father\u2019s wishes. It was a paper only wedding, because I had no support for an actually celebration. It was a pretty rude awakening, going from CEO\u2019s son to dirt poor literally overnight\u2026 We skipped around cheap apartments for a bit - I had a bit of savings that covered us while she was pregnant, but not much. No one tells you how expensive babies are, even before they are born. We had to get scans and prenatals and go to doctors appointments. By the time Jiwoo was out, I had about a dollar to my name. I\u2019m just lucky that Yoongi let us live with them, and Joon helped out when he could afford to spare some extra cash. They were both just starting out, but\u2026\u2019 He sighs, dipping his head deeply as he looks down towards his lap - attempting to hide the shame dancing across his cheeks. </p><p>It\u2019s you that reaches out your hand, breaking your own rule to rest it across his ando stroke over the low bend in his knuckles. It was almost instinctive, as you watched the emotion swell in his shoulders, hunching them protectively to shield his face. It takes him a while to collect himself, to breathe deeply enough to soothe the troubled emotions threatening to spill from his eyes. </p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 You probe, fingers twisting around his wrist to squeeze it reassuringly. It\u2019s a few moments before he speaks, his head not lifting to greet yours. </p><p>\u2018Jiwoo completely changed my life. He motivated me to start my company, get my life together\u2026 I know I work hard, and sometimes I\u2019m trying to balance too much by looking after him and working in such a high pressure job. We just keep growing and become more and more successful - I\u2019ve got enough money in my bank now to provide for him, and some spare for enjoying a fine wine with beautiful woman every now and again. But it\u2019s taken a lot of sweat and tears to get here. I\u2019d do it all over in a heartbeat for him.,\u2019 Still glancing down, the deep sniff rattling through his chest notifies you something is dangerously off. \u2018It really hurts when I think about his Mum\u2026 how she can\u2019t see it like I do. My Dad, I can let that go\u2026 I never really expected him to have a relationship with Jiwoo. But his Mum? She couldn\u2019t care less about him, aside from the child support. My Dad was dead right. All she saw in me was dollar signs, and now all she sees in her son is more dollar signs.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Jin, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a pathetic, empty sentence that you know offers little comfort to him - but what else could you say? </p><p>\u2018If I had my way, she wouldn\u2019t get to take him at all. It\u2019s exhausting. The irregular schedules she keeps - dropping him off half way through a mandated custody arrangement because she\u2019s sick of looking after him. The way I have to think of suck quick lies to stop him from understanding that his own Mum doesn\u2019t even care enough to look after him\u2026,\u2019 His shoulders shudder, and when he stretches up - his eyes are much clearer than you\u2019d anticipated, only slightly redder and wider than usual. \u2018You know, I thought I could talk about this without getting emotional\u2026 But it just hurts, thinking about it all. There is still a lot more to Jiwoo\u2019s story\u2026 I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to drink enough wine to get through it all tonight.\u2019 </p><p>As he sits there, red eyes glistening with tears he\u2019d faught so hard to keep from falling, a stitch of regret works it\u2019s way through the pit of your stomach. It had always been obvious to you that Seokjin cared for Jiwoo, and would do anything to help him. But the ferocity with which he had defended his actions last time you met made so much more sense, now that you knew the backstory behind it all\u2026 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m usually not that into conspiracy theories, but is this your way of trying to see me again?,\u2019 The jest is meant to lighten the air - to ease the tension that was hunched deeply in Seokjin\u2019s broad and wide shoulders. It works, because as your hand soothes over his and a light laugh dances from his lips, they slack slightly as he relaxes. \u2018I might not have a fancy vintage wine from my personal cellar, but I do have two thirds of a bottle of cheap vodka I\u2019m more than willing to share.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018God, I can see why Jiwoo likes you so much\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s gaze settles on you - the smile remaining on his lips as he leans slightly closer to close the gap between your bodies over the corner of the table you were seated at. He studies you - eyes scanning yours, searching for a short hint of something you were unsure of. \u2018He\u2019s always been a good judge of character.\u2019 </p><p>What happens next is so surreal, it almost feels like a scene from a movie. </p><p>As Seokjin moves in, you find yourself mirroring his stance, your own torso angling itself towards the musky wood notes of his perfume coming towards you as he invades your space. The approach is slow and mutual, both of you edging closer to each other at equal speeds. It shouldn\u2019t surprise you when your lips meet - not when both of you had been so generously touchy with each other so far - but somehow it does. </p><p>It\u2019s a soft bump at first - a subtle, testing peck that doesn\u2019t take much effort from either of you. But god, you\u2019d be lying if the plump curve of Seokjin\u2019s juiced lips didn\u2019t feel too good for you to want more. Slick and wet from the wine, they\u2019re even softer than you remember them being - the perfect amount of moistness. </p><p>He must taste something he likes, too, because soon you are together again - mouths parted slightly, cushioning sweetly as you kiss. It\u2019s not long before his tongue probes, parting your lips to slip past your teeth, caressing against your own. The bold flavours of the cab sav are muted slightly by his saliva, but the roll of the muscle against your own has a flood of need hurtling straight towards your core - the taste so similar to when you\u2019d first met, that you can hardly control the squeeze of your thighs closer together. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t do this. No matter how much you wanted it, it wasn\u2019t fair to Seokjin - not when he\u2019d made such an effort to attempt to explain his situation, putting himself in such a vulnerable position in the process. </p><p>\u2018Jin\u2026 Wait\u2026\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Shit, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026 That was not meant to happen.,\u2019 Seokjin pulls back, tugging at the neck of his hoodie to fan himself. A deep crimson shade has begun to creep over his neck, stretching ruthlessly upwards as he attempts to unfluster his motions. \u2018I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. I liked it a lot. I just don\u2019t want to think I asked you to come so we would\u2026 well, you know.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yeah, Jin\u2026 It\u2019s fine. I liked it too.,\u2019 Smiling gently, you shake your head slightly - giggling at the red that continues to creep higher, hitting his throat. \u2018It was nice. But I don\u2019t want to jump into anything after a conversation that heavy, you know?\u2019 He nods in understanding. </p><p>\u2018You know, I promised Jiwoo that I\u2019d take him zoo. I haven\u2019t gotten around to it, but I have a day off on Sunday\u2026 I just wanted to say that Jiwoo really, really likes you. Whatever you did when you looked after him made a big impression on the kid. I know I snapped the other day, but things with his Mum haven\u2019t been easy lately. They\u2019re getting a lot harder, too. It\u2019s not an excuse, but it\u2019s been difficult trying to be rational about that kind of stuff. I just want the best for him, and I really took my stress out on you. I\u2019m really, really sorry\u2026,\u2019 The soft furrow of his brow shows his sincerity as he speaks. \u2018I really think you\u2019re good for Jiwoo. He\u2019s got a knack for attracting good people. I hope I didn\u2019t put you off\u2026 and if I did, again I\u2019m really sorry. But, if you\u2019re available, you\u2019re free to join us?\u2019 </p><p>Seeing Seokjin open up had told you so much about him - so much about what you needed to know to continue any kind of friendship with both him and his son. It was crystal clear to you now that he wasn\u2019t an irrationally angry man. He was just fiercly protective of his son, and the life he\u2019d created for them. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for you to consider your answer. </p><p>\u2018Do they have penguins at the zoo? If so, I\u2019m in. They\u2019re my favourite.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018That\u2019s funny\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s smile broadens as he chuckles. \u2018They\u2019re Jiwoo\u2019s favourite, too.\u2019 </p></p>",

Prior to even bracing the entrance of the apartment, buzzed in by Seokjin, Jiwoo\u2019s body spirals around the corner from the living room \u2013 belting towards you like a hurricane.</p><p>As soon as his eyes spot yours, his arms reach upward, a shriek of laughter falling from him. Like an adorable catapult, he hurtles himself towards you with every intention of a hug. Without thinking, you accept him \u2013 pulling him quickly into the deepest one you can muster. It\u2019s an odd sensation that hollows the pit of your stomach \u2013 a familiarity laced with an overwhelming happiness at his excitement to see you.</p><p>\u2018____ !,\u2019 He calls your name, burying his head deeply into your neck as his little fists grip on to you. \u2018I missed you. Daddy said you had been busy, and that you couldn\u2019t come and play. But I knew you\u2019d come back!\u2019</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2018Hey Buddy, Remember what we talked about?,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s steps fall hollow against the dark wood of his apartment, his tall frame appearing in the entrance just as you let Jiwoo go. \u2018You can\u2019t stay, Uncle Yoongi is coming to pick you up because he wants to take you to get some ice cream.\u2019</p><p>Seokjin\u2019s frame is as tall as you remember it being \u2013 accentuated more by the thick, long grey hoodie falling to the tops of his thighs. It\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve seen him out of a suit \u2013 the tears in his jeans indicating the price tag of fashionably distressed more than actually worn, but still marking that he\u2019d been home long enough to ditch the work attire. A small, creamy patch of skin peeks through just underneath his pocket, drawing your eye in instantly.</p><p>Even in the more casual attire he still radiates a ridiculous amount of attractiveness, and a swell of memories surges through you from the night you\u2019d first met \u2013 his thick, broad shoulders accentuated by the fall of the sweater not helping you in trying to forget how good it had felt to clutch hard against them as he made you come. </p><p>\u2018But Dad\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get ice cream with Uncle Yoongi!\u2019 Jiwoo\u2019s bottom lip protrudes, sticking out as a short huff of air leaves him in protest. Seokjin doesn\u2019t falter \u2013 doesn\u2019t cave to the whim of the four year old, standing resolute in his insistence.</p><p>\u2018But you love ice cream, and you love going places with Uncle Yoongi.,\u2019 He counters smoothly. \u2018Besides, he just text me to say he was parking his car. He even finished work early just to hang out with his little buddy.\u2019</p><p>Jiwoo\u2019s pout doesn\u2019t shift, but his body does \u2013 arms reaching out to cling dramatically to your leg, grip tight and unrelenting.</p><p>\u2018Can\u2019t you come, too?,\u2019 He looks up at you, begging round eyes a spitting image of his fathers. \u2018Uncle Yoongi is cool\u2026 we can go for ice cream and you can talk to him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2026,\u2019 Your glance shifts towards Seokjin for guidance, unsure of how to answer the question without letting the completely endearing Jiwoo down. It\u2019s a strange sight that greets you \u2013 curiosity peeked in Seokjin as he watches, seemingly a judgement of how you\u2019re going to react. Without missing another beat, you kneel down to come face to face with Jiwoo, peeling his hands off your calf and holding them in your own. \u2018I know you really want me to come, Jiwoo. And I really want to come, too. But I have to talk to your Dad about something important. I promise we can get ice cream later.\u2019</p><p>Jiwoo doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to answer, and Seokjin doesn\u2019t have the time to judge, because a sharp knock on the open door draws everyone\u2019s attention to the black t-shirt clad frame that could only be\u2026</p><p>\u2018Uncle Yoongi!,\u2019 Jiwoo\u2019s up \u2013 loyalty to you totally blown to pieces at the appearance of the man who\u2019s name you\u2019d heard fall from his lips so many times. He barrels towards him in exactly the same manner he greeted you, Yoongi\u2019s arms stretching down in preparation to launch the child high in the air with the momentum of his jump, catching him with perfect timing. Jiwoo erupts into giggles, squealing in joy at the motion. \u2018Again!\u2019 He begs.</p><p>\u2018Uncle Yoongi is tired, buddy,\u2019 The man pouts, flipping the white blonde strands of his hair out of his eyes. \u2018I\u2019ve spent all day at work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How was work?\u2019 Seokjin quips as Yoongi balances Jiwoo against his hip, not even batting an eyelid as the child begins picking at the leather strapped necklace gracing his neck.</p><p>\u2018Same old same old\u2026 Mixing stupid songs for stupid artists that can\u2019t fucking sing.,\u2019 He shrugs indifferently, the cuss word coming from his mouth earning him a glare from Seokjin. Jiwoo remains unphased, his tiny hands far too interested in the shiny object attached to the rope. \u2018Joon text. He said he\u2019s keen for a beer after the shit day he\u2019s had. Won\u2019t be until later, though. He\u2019s still working. You wanna join?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why did Uncle Joon have a shit day?\u2019 Jiwoo pipes up, innocent eyes staring questioningly at Yoongi. A chuckle rumbles from the man, bouncing the child\u2019s frame against his hip in amusement.</p><p>\u2018Because, he works at a shit job.\u2019 The answer falls from him without remourse. </p><p>\u2018I hope I don\u2019t have a shit job when I grow up. I want to be like you, Uncle Yoongi\u2026 A pro\u2026 A pro\u2026 prodructer.\u2019 He struggles to spit the difficult world out from his tongue. </p><p>\u2018Jiwoo, don\u2019t say shit\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s quick to scold him, and that pouty lip protrudes once again from Jiwoo \u2013 directed straight towards his father. </p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, Ji-man. As soon as we get into Uncle Yoongi\u2019s car, you can say shit all you want \u2013 okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018And can I get two scoops of ice cream like last time? Dad only lets me get one\u2026\u2019 Jiwoo pushes, fluttering his eyes upwards.</p><p>\u2018Bud, Uncle Yoong will get you three.,\u2019 He accepts the tight hug his promise grants him, kissing the top of Jiwoo\u2019s dark strands before dropping him to the ground. \u2018Put your shoes on so we can get going, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018One.\u2019 It\u2019s hard to miss the word mouthed by Seokjin towards Yoongi as Jiwoo is distracted, running quickly to grab his shoes from their spot near the door.</p><p>\u2018So, you down for a drink tonight?\u2019 Yoongi asks again as Jiwoo prepares himself, struggling to slip his feet into the pair small adidas sneakers. Distracted, you swing yourself around to aid him. </p><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019ll have to play it by ear.,\u2019 Seokjin flicks a quick glimpse in your direction he thinks you won\u2019t notice - a silent mention to Yoongi, who nods back knowingly. \u2018I\u2019ll probably have work tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018All good\u2026 Just let me know, yeah?,\u2019 He refocuses his attention on the little boy, whos shoes are now fastened securely to his feet thanks to you. \u2018Hey, Ji-man, remember what Uncle Yoongi taught you last time?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Square up!\u2019 Jiwoo shouts, hands automatically balling into small fits to over his face, a cheap imitation of a boxing stance. </p><p>\u2018That\u2019s right! Go square up to your Dad and tell him you\u2019re gonna eat three scoops of ice cream, then let\u2019s get going.\u2019 At Yoongi\u2019s suggestion, Jiwoo bounces forward - hands flailing in any direction before making light contact with the denim of Seokjin\u2019s pants - scuffing the material playfully. </p><p>\u2018Sqaure up, Dad!,\u2019 Jiwoo squwaks happily. \u2018I\u2019m gonna eat three scoops of ice cream!\u2019 Seokjin bundles the boy into his arms, broad shoulders stretching down to pin the child\u2019s wild arms to his side in a bear hug. </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m not coming with you\u2026 or you\u2019d get none!,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s next action draws a strong shriek from Jiwoo as his lips raining kisses against his chubby, thick cheeks. Jiwoo\u2019s body struggles, squirming in his father\u2019s grip to fight against the affection. \u2018I love you buddy, I\u2019ll come pick you up from Uncle Yoongi\u2019s later, alright?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I love you too, Daddy.,\u2019 Relenting, Jiwoo sinks into the embrace - tiny arms wrapping around Seokjin\u2019s neck to nuzzle tightly against him. \u2018I\u2019ll miss you.\u2019 It\u2019s a short sentence - a small, immeasurable utterance of three words murmurder just below Seokjin\u2019s ear - but it\u2019s too hard not to notice the swell of Seokjin\u2019s chest puffing out happily. </p><p>\u2018Right Ji-man\u2026 Let\u2019s go. Uncle Yoongi\u2019s double parked.\u2019 Yoongi presses, watching as Seokjin gives him a final squeeze before </p><p>\u2018Wait\u2026,\u2019 Jiwoo wiggles from underneath Seokjin\u2019s palms, skipping his way towards you. \u2018Bye, ____ . I love you.\u2019 He flings his arms around your neck, and it\u2019s only then that you realise you\u2019ve been crouched on the floor down by the shoes far to long for it not to be awkward. Giving him a swift pat on the back, endeared by his remembrance of you, you watch as he waves his final goodbyes before he disappears out the door, hand in hand with the man that had promised him three scoops of ice cream. </p><p>\u2018Three scoops, huh?,\u2019 Hands dusting lightly over your jeans to smooth out the wrinkles in the denim, you straighten your body, stepping out of your shoes and up onto the small ledge that distinguishes between the entrance and the hardwood floor of Seokjin\u2019s luxurious apartment. \u2018That\u2019s a lot of ice cream for such a little guy.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Eh, Tell me about it\u2026 Yoongi\u2019s not the one that has to put a four year old with that much sugar in his system to bed. Sometimes I wonder if he does it to torture me\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin steps towards you, arms opening up to draw you into a half hug. The strong, wafting scent of his cologne sinks into you - filtering through to a foggy bank of memories you have from that night. \u2018How have you been, anyway?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been alright. Mmm\u2026 You smell good.,\u2019 Throwing the compliment to ease the awkward tension growing between the both of you, you take the opportunity as you step back to view him once more - taking in the soft warmth of the more casual style he had adopted for today. It seems to work, and the heaviness of the conversation you\u2019re about to undertake slips slightly in the form of a smile from him. \u00a0\u2018This is the first time I haven\u2019t seen you in a suit, you know?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Do you approve?\u2019 A light chuckle falls from his lips, cheeks perking as his mouth creases upwards. Although you\u2019re sure it wasn\u2019t his intent, a crackle of energy sparks inside you, causing a tinge of heat to threaten your cheeks.</p><p>\u2018Most definitely.\u2019 You hold his gaze as you speak, shoulders staunch in their resolve not to let him know the effect he was having on you. God, it was just too easy to fall back into flirting with him. </p><p>\u2018Come in\u2026 come in\u2026,\u2019 He steps back, freeing space for you to pace next to him. \u2018I appreciate you coming here. I know it was a big ask, especially considering last time\u2026 but Jiwoo was really excited to see you, right?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yeah. If only briefly. He\u2019s a really cute kid, Seokjin.,\u2019 Trailing ever so slightly behind him, you make your way through the apartment, instantly spying two wine glasses set out on the table, one half filled that had evidently been consumed by Seokjin. \u2018I like him a lot.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I think the feeling is pretty mutual\u2026 He hasn\u2019t stopped talking about you since you looked after him. He\u2019s grown quite fond of </p><p>friend ____ . Keeps asking when you\u2019re coming around again.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Liquid courage?\u2019 It\u2019s you that chuckles this time, a lazy hand motioning to the spread of glasses on the table. </p><p>\u2018Something like that\u2026\u2019 He flattens his puffy lips, a rough burst of air causing them to vibrate heavily as he lets out a sigh. \u2018I\u2019m not drunk\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t do that, not while I\u2019m looking after Jiwoo. I was gonna wait until you got here, but I just thought fuck it and had half a glass.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What is so bad that you have to drink to tell me?\u2019 The heaviness of the room expands, and you sense that Seokjin\u2019s usually happy and jovial personality had been sinking quickly since the departure of his son. The fact that he\u2019d consumed half a glass of wine before you\u2019d even arrived, though\u2026 that was news. </p><p>\u2018Take a seat, I\u2019ll pour you a glass and we can get started.\u2019 Like a true gentleman, he pulls the chair our, hand sweeping over it in a grand gesture. Even nervous, he oozes the well bred mannerisms that had drawn you to him that night in the club. As you sit, he allows his hand to dust over your shoulder lightly - a gentle, airy touch that without your history you would have thought unintentional. But, it lingers just a little too long for you not to feel that deep pull of attraction again. </p><p>Sitting, you watch as he grabs the bottle - wrist twisting upwards to pour the red liquid. It sloshes freely into the cup, dark amber and clear. No doubt an expensive vintage. </p><p>\u2018Cheers.,\u2019 After he sits, you raise your glass towards him, saluting it high in the air. \u2018To liquid courage and friendship.\u2019 Your line makes Seokjin laugh, and he quickly mimicks you by raising his glass to clink against yours. </p><p>A brief, awkward silence falls between the both of you. </p><p>\u2018God\u2026 where do I even start\u2026\u2019 He sighs deeply after he drinks in a large sip. He\u2019d need more help than you thought\u2026 perhaps a direct line of questioning would be the ice breaker needed?</p><p>\u2018Well, what about Jiwoo\u2019s Mum?,\u2019 The wine is deeply rich, the fruity tang of the tannins bursting over your tongue as you hold it to savour the taste. \u2018How did you meet her? That should be pretty straight forward, right?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018In a club\u2026 Our stories were pretty similar, actually\u2026 I was drunk, she was drunk\u2026 I was hot, she was hot\u2026 Drunk and hot seems to be kinda my thing.,\u2019 His head dips as he shakes the shaggy strands from his eyes, playful smirk peeking out from behind his dark locks. \u2018I used to\u2026 uhhh\u2026 go out a little bit more back then. I ran into her a few more times, through mutual friends and stuff\u2026 one thing lead to another, and we were dating.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Well, that all seems pretty typical? What\u2019s so bad about that?\u2019 You swallow again, drawing the juice slowly into your mouth as you peer at Seokjin from over the rim of the crystal. </p><p>\u2018I guess my parents never really liked her\u2026,\u2019 A dismissive shrug. Another sip of wine, his fat, full lips turning slightly reddish from the liquid. The shine of the wetness made them look even more inviting. \u2018My father always told me she was really bad. That she only saw dollar signs in me\u2026 god, he couldn\u2019t have been more right. But\u2026 you know, when you think you\u2019re in love.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018So you weren\u2019t really in love?\u2019 It\u2019s easy to prompt him now that he\u2019s started. Seokjin was a natural talker, and the words were spilling freely from his mouth. </p><p>\u2018Maybe I was.,\u2019 Absently, he shrugs. \u2018She wasn\u2019t, though. It became pretty clear what she wanted when Jiwoo happened\u2026\u2019 His eyes dart away, the mention of his son\u2019s name triggering something deeper to stir inside him. </p><p>\u2018Jin, you don\u2019t have to tell me, if you don\u2019t want to\u2026,\u2019 A single hand comes up to rest against his forearm, the warmth of your touch causing his gaze to refocus, staring straight into you. \u2018I mean\u2026 I know what Jiwoo means to you. You don\u2019t have to tell me this, if it\u2019s going to hurt you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018____.,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s hand shifts up to rest over your fingers, cupping his knuckles over yours. \u2018Is it weird that you\u2019re the first girl I\u2019ve felt comfortable talking about this with? I mean, I was scared\u2026 but seeing how Jiwoo is with you - it really makes me feel like I can trust you. Plus, you deserve to know. Especially when I was such a dick to you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m listening\u2019 A warm hearted smile dusts your lips, Seokjin\u2019s sentiment sinking through the caress of his palm into you. Despite the conversation, it felt oddly intimate to be so close to him. </p><p>\u2018So Jiwoo\u2026 He\u2019s the best thing that happened to me, don\u2019t get me wrong. I would not live my life any other way. But, his conception was\u2026 a surprise, to put it nicely. I guess younger me thought I was infallible - like most men in their early 20s who put pleasure before logic - and with some alcohol it wasn\u2019t difficult to convince me not to use a condom. I did what I thought was right, bought a ring on the credit card my father let me have.,\u2019 Another sip from the glass. \u2018He is a CEO. Well, was a CEO at the time. I\u2019m not talking little league stuff, either. This is really dragging on, though\u2026 basically, he thought she got pregnant on purpose and refused to let me marry her. I wanted to marry her anyway, and as a result he cut me off. No money, no support\u2026 he hasn\u2019t ever seen his only Grandson, actually.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What?,\u2019 Your jaw slacks, and it\u2019s Seokjin\u2019s hand that squeezes yours in comfort this time. \u2018But Jiwoo is\u2026 Jiwoo. He\u2019s adorable.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to tell me that twice.,\u2019 A smile cracks across his lips\u2026 one that sinks it\u2019s way upwards and just brushes his eyes in the form of slightly crinkled crows feet. \u2018But, just to flatter my genetics, you can\u2026\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Jin, I\u2019ve never met a kid like Jiwoo. He\u2019s so cute. I can\u2019t believe your father wouldn\u2019t want to meet him.\u2019 Still happy, the smile perks across Seokjin\u2019s face more, his free hand coming to rub ever so slightly across your chin affectionately. It\u2019s meant playfully, but the gesture is highly intimate and you can feel the way your own body betrays you by nuzzling into it.</p><p>\u2018The way I see it, it\u2019s my Dad\u2019s loss. People who appreciate Jiwoo deserve him in their life. People who make the effort to ensure his happiness, are worthy of him. He\u2019s got a great bunch of people who shower him with affection. He knows he is loved. He doesn\u2019t need my Dad around. Actually, my Dad would be lucky to have </p><p>around.,\u2019 His fingers splay lightly against your fingers, tracing slow circles as his free one leaves your face and picks up the wine to suck another sip. \u2018Take Yoongi, for example. You probably picked up that he\u2019s unique. Not everyone appreciates that I let him spend so much time around my kid. But, he always has Jiwoo in his heart - and Jiwoo loves him more than anything. Yoongi makes time for him, always has and always will. Yoongi makes him feel loved and appreciated. Always has, and always will. When I had nothing, Yoongi was one of the first to step in and offer me a place to stay with Jiwoo. Between him and Joon, in some weird and fucked up kinda way, we built a little family. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019 </p><p>Your mind flashes back to the man shrouded in the doorway, his initial dark and brooding form softening as soon as Jiwoo had sprinted towards him. He\u2019d barely said a word to you, barely acknowledged your existence - but there was no mistaking the love he\u2019d shown that kid. Despite the swearing and the promise of too much ice cream, it was obvious he had a deep connection with the child. </p><p>\u2018So, after your father cut you off, what happened?,\u2019 You drag another deep sip from your glass, eager to hear the rest of his story. </p><p>\u2018Well, this is the part that hurts the most\u2026 so excuse me, I\u2019m just gonna top up my vessle.\u2019 Before he can reach for the bottle, you\u2019ve clutched it - quickly pouring the contents to refil his almost empty wine. </p><p>\u2018Here, let me.\u2019 It\u2019s an excuse to free yourself from his hand. It was feeling far too good, having the comfort of his fingers lacing against your skin to soothe you. Feeling far too familiar as he warmed the flesh on the back of your hand, soaking his attention through to your bones. You needed an escape, because tonight you didn\u2019t want to end up in his bed. </p><p>Once you\u2019re done, your hands slip under the table - falling squarely on your knees as a form of security. Seokjin bobs his head in appreciation before taking another sip. </p><p>\u2018Okay, so\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin breathes deeply. \u2018I married Jiwoo\u2019s mother, against my father\u2019s wishes. It was a paper only wedding, because I had no support for an actually celebration. It was a pretty rude awakening, going from CEO\u2019s son to dirt poor literally overnight\u2026 We skipped around cheap apartments for a bit - I had a bit of savings that covered us while she was pregnant, but not much. No one tells you how expensive babies are, even before they are born. We had to get scans and prenatals and go to doctors appointments. By the time Jiwoo was out, I had about a dollar to my name. I\u2019m just lucky that Yoongi let us live with them, and Joon helped out when he could afford to spare some extra cash. They were both just starting out, but\u2026\u2019 He sighs, dipping his head deeply as he looks down towards his lap - attempting to hide the shame dancing across his cheeks. </p><p>It\u2019s you that reaches out your hand, breaking your own rule to rest it across his ando stroke over the low bend in his knuckles. It was almost instinctive, as you watched the emotion swell in his shoulders, hunching them protectively to shield his face. It takes him a while to collect himself, to breathe deeply enough to soothe the troubled emotions threatening to spill from his eyes. </p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 You probe, fingers twisting around his wrist to squeeze it reassuringly. It\u2019s a few moments before he speaks, his head not lifting to greet yours. </p><p>\u2018Jiwoo completely changed my life. He motivated me to start my company, get my life together\u2026 I know I work hard, and sometimes I\u2019m trying to balance too much by looking after him and working in such a high pressure job. We just keep growing and become more and more successful - I\u2019ve got enough money in my bank now to provide for him, and some spare for enjoying a fine wine with beautiful woman every now and again. But it\u2019s taken a lot of sweat and tears to get here. I\u2019d do it all over in a heartbeat for him.,\u2019 Still glancing down, the deep sniff rattling through his chest notifies you something is dangerously off. \u2018It really hurts when I think about his Mum\u2026 how she can\u2019t see it like I do. My Dad, I can let that go\u2026 I never really expected him to have a relationship with Jiwoo. But his Mum? She couldn\u2019t care less about him, aside from the child support. My Dad was dead right. All she saw in me was dollar signs, and now all she sees in her son is more dollar signs.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Jin, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a pathetic, empty sentence that you know offers little comfort to him - but what else could you say? </p><p>\u2018If I had my way, she wouldn\u2019t get to take him at all. It\u2019s exhausting. The irregular schedules she keeps - dropping him off half way through a mandated custody arrangement because she\u2019s sick of looking after him. The way I have to think of suck quick lies to stop him from understanding that his own Mum doesn\u2019t even care enough to look after him\u2026,\u2019 His shoulders shudder, and when he stretches up - his eyes are much clearer than you\u2019d anticipated, only slightly redder and wider than usual. \u2018You know, I thought I could talk about this without getting emotional\u2026 But it just hurts, thinking about it all. There is still a lot more to Jiwoo\u2019s story\u2026 I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to drink enough wine to get through it all tonight.\u2019 </p><p>As he sits there, red eyes glistening with tears he\u2019d faught so hard to keep from falling, a stitch of regret works it\u2019s way through the pit of your stomach. It had always been obvious to you that Seokjin cared for Jiwoo, and would do anything to help him. But the ferocity with which he had defended his actions last time you met made so much more sense, now that you knew the backstory behind it all\u2026 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m usually not that into conspiracy theories, but is this your way of trying to see me again?,\u2019 The jest is meant to lighten the air - to ease the tension that was hunched deeply in Seokjin\u2019s broad and wide shoulders. It works, because as your hand soothes over his and a light laugh dances from his lips, they slack slightly as he relaxes. \u2018I might not have a fancy vintage wine from my personal cellar, but I do have two thirds of a bottle of cheap vodka I\u2019m more than willing to share.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018God, I can see why Jiwoo likes you so much\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s gaze settles on you - the smile remaining on his lips as he leans slightly closer to close the gap between your bodies over the corner of the table you were seated at. He studies you - eyes scanning yours, searching for a short hint of something you were unsure of. \u2018He\u2019s always been a good judge of character.\u2019 </p><p>What happens next is so surreal, it almost feels like a scene from a movie. </p><p>As Seokjin moves in, you find yourself mirroring his stance, your own torso angling itself towards the musky wood notes of his perfume coming towards you as he invades your space. The approach is slow and mutual, both of you edging closer to each other at equal speeds. It shouldn\u2019t surprise you when your lips meet - not when both of you had been so generously touchy with each other so far - but somehow it does. </p><p>It\u2019s a soft bump at first - a subtle, testing peck that doesn\u2019t take much effort from either of you. But god, you\u2019d be lying if the plump curve of Seokjin\u2019s juiced lips didn\u2019t feel too good for you to want more. Slick and wet from the wine, they\u2019re even softer than you remember them being - the perfect amount of moistness. </p><p>He must taste something he likes, too, because soon you are together again - mouths parted slightly, cushioning sweetly as you kiss. It\u2019s not long before his tongue probes, parting your lips to slip past your teeth, caressing against your own. The bold flavours of the cab sav are muted slightly by his saliva, but the roll of the muscle against your own has a flood of need hurtling straight towards your core - the taste so similar to when you\u2019d first met, that you can hardly control the squeeze of your thighs closer together. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t do this. No matter how much you wanted it, it wasn\u2019t fair to Seokjin - not when he\u2019d made such an effort to attempt to explain his situation, putting himself in such a vulnerable position in the process. </p><p>\u2018Jin\u2026 Wait\u2026\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Shit, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026 That was not meant to happen.,\u2019 Seokjin pulls back, tugging at the neck of his hoodie to fan himself. A deep crimson shade has begun to creep over his neck, stretching ruthlessly upwards as he attempts to unfluster his motions. \u2018I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. I liked it a lot. I just don\u2019t want to think I asked you to come so we would\u2026 well, you know.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yeah, Jin\u2026 It\u2019s fine. I liked it too.,\u2019 Smiling gently, you shake your head slightly - giggling at the red that continues to creep higher, hitting his throat. \u2018It was nice. But I don\u2019t want to jump into anything after a conversation that heavy, you know?\u2019 He nods in understanding. </p><p>\u2018You know, I promised Jiwoo that I\u2019d take him zoo. I haven\u2019t gotten around to it, but I have a day off on Sunday\u2026 I just wanted to say that Jiwoo really, really likes you. Whatever you did when you looked after him made a big impression on the kid. I know I snapped the other day, but things with his Mum haven\u2019t been easy lately. They\u2019re getting a lot harder, too. It\u2019s not an excuse, but it\u2019s been difficult trying to be rational about that kind of stuff. I just want the best for him, and I really took my stress out on you. I\u2019m really, really sorry\u2026,\u2019 The soft furrow of his brow shows his sincerity as he speaks. \u2018I really think you\u2019re good for Jiwoo. He\u2019s got a knack for attracting good people. I hope I didn\u2019t put you off\u2026 and if I did, again I\u2019m really sorry. But, if you\u2019re available, you\u2019re free to join us?\u2019 </p><p>Seeing Seokjin open up had told you so much about him - so much about what you needed to know to continue any kind of friendship with both him and his son. It was crystal clear to you now that he wasn\u2019t an irrationally angry man. He was just fiercly protective of his son, and the life he\u2019d created for them. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for you to consider your answer. </p><p>\u2018Do they have penguins at the zoo? If so, I\u2019m in. They\u2019re my favourite.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018That\u2019s funny\u2026,\u2019 Seokjin\u2019s smile broadens as he chuckles. \u2018They\u2019re Jiwoo\u2019s favourite, too.\u2019 </p></p>",

Prior to even bracing the entrance of the apartment, buzzed in by Seokjin, Jiwoo&rsquo;s body spirals around the corner from the living room &ndash; belting towards you like a hurricane.</p><p>As soon as his eyes spot yours, his arms reach upward, a shriek of laughter falling from him. Like an adorable catapult, he hurtles himself towards you with every intention of a hug. Without thinking, you accept him &ndash; pulling him quickly into the deepest one you can muster. It&rsquo;s an odd sensation that hollows the pit of your stomach &ndash; a familiarity laced with an overwhelming happiness at his excitement to see you.</p><p>&lsquo;____ !,&rsquo; He calls your name, burying his head deeply into your neck as his little fists grip on to you. &lsquo;I missed you. Daddy said you had been busy, and that you couldn&rsquo;t come and play. But I knew you&rsquo;d come back!&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Hey Buddy, Remember what we talked about?,&rsquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s steps fall hollow against the dark wood of his apartment, his tall frame appearing in the entrance just as you let Jiwoo go. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t stay, Uncle Yoongi is coming to pick you up because he wants to take you to get some ice cream.&rsquo;</p><p>Seokjin&rsquo;s frame is as tall as you remember it being &ndash; accentuated more by the thick, long grey hoodie falling to the tops of his thighs. It&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;ve seen him out of a suit &ndash; the tears in his jeans indicating the price tag of fashionably distressed more than actually worn, but still marking that he&rsquo;d been home long enough to ditch the work attire. A small, creamy patch of skin peeks through just underneath his pocket, drawing your eye in instantly.</p><p>Even in the more casual attire he still radiates a ridiculous amount of attractiveness, and a swell of memories surges through you from the night you&rsquo;d first met &ndash; his thick, broad shoulders accentuated by the fall of the sweater not helping you in trying to forget how good it had felt to clutch hard against them as he made you come. </p><p>&lsquo;But Dad&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to get ice cream with Uncle Yoongi!&rsquo; Jiwoo&rsquo;s bottom lip protrudes, sticking out as a short huff of air leaves him in protest. Seokjin doesn&rsquo;t falter &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t cave to the whim of the four year old, standing resolute in his insistence.</p><p>&lsquo;But you love ice cream, and you love going places with Uncle Yoongi.,&rsquo; He counters smoothly. &lsquo;Besides, he just text me to say he was parking his car. He even finished work early just to hang out with his little buddy.&rsquo;</p><p>Jiwoo&rsquo;s pout doesn&rsquo;t shift, but his body does &ndash; arms reaching out to cling dramatically to your leg, grip tight and unrelenting.</p><p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you come, too?,&rsquo; He looks up at you, begging round eyes a spitting image of his fathers. &lsquo;Uncle Yoongi is cool&hellip; we can go for ice cream and you can talk to him.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I&hellip;,&rsquo; Your glance shifts towards Seokjin for guidance, unsure of how to answer the question without letting the completely endearing Jiwoo down. It&rsquo;s a strange sight that greets you &ndash; curiosity peeked in Seokjin as he watches, seemingly a judgement of how you&rsquo;re going to react. Without missing another beat, you kneel down to come face to face with Jiwoo, peeling his hands off your calf and holding them in your own. &lsquo;I know you really want me to come, Jiwoo. And I really want to come, too. But I have to talk to your Dad about something important. I promise we can get ice cream later.&rsquo;</p><p>Jiwoo doesn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to answer, and Seokjin doesn&rsquo;t have the time to judge, because a sharp knock on the open door draws everyone&rsquo;s attention to the black t-shirt clad frame that could only be&hellip;</p><p>&lsquo;Uncle Yoongi!,&rsquo; Jiwoo&rsquo;s up &ndash; loyalty to you totally blown to pieces at the appearance of the man who&rsquo;s name you&rsquo;d heard fall from his lips so many times. He barrels towards him in exactly the same manner he greeted you, Yoongi&rsquo;s arms stretching down in preparation to launch the child high in the air with the momentum of his jump, catching him with perfect timing. Jiwoo erupts into giggles, squealing in joy at the motion. &lsquo;Again!&rsquo; He begs.</p><p>&lsquo;Uncle Yoongi is tired, buddy,&rsquo; The man pouts, flipping the white blonde strands of his hair out of his eyes. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve spent all day at work.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;How was work?&rsquo; Seokjin quips as Yoongi balances Jiwoo against his hip, not even batting an eyelid as the child begins picking at the leather strapped necklace gracing his neck.</p><p>&lsquo;Same old same old&hellip; Mixing stupid songs for stupid artists that can&rsquo;t fucking sing.,&rsquo; He shrugs indifferently, the cuss word coming from his mouth earning him a glare from Seokjin. Jiwoo remains unphased, his tiny hands far too interested in the shiny object attached to the rope. &lsquo;Joon text. He said he&rsquo;s keen for a beer after the shit day he&rsquo;s had. Won&rsquo;t be until later, though. He&rsquo;s still working. You wanna join?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Why did Uncle Joon have a shit day?&rsquo; Jiwoo pipes up, innocent eyes staring questioningly at Yoongi. A chuckle rumbles from the man, bouncing the child&rsquo;s frame against his hip in amusement.</p><p>&lsquo;Because, he works at a shit job.&rsquo; The answer falls from him without remourse. </p><p>&lsquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t have a shit job when I grow up. I want to be like you, Uncle Yoongi&hellip; A pro&hellip; A pro&hellip; prodructer.&rsquo; He struggles to spit the difficult world out from his tongue. </p><p>&lsquo;Jiwoo, don&rsquo;t say shit&hellip;,&rsquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s quick to scold him, and that pouty lip protrudes once again from Jiwoo &ndash; directed straight towards his father. </p><p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Ji-man. As soon as we get into Uncle Yoongi&rsquo;s car, you can say shit all you want &ndash; okay?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;And can I get two scoops of ice cream like last time? Dad only lets me get one&hellip;&rsquo; Jiwoo pushes, fluttering his eyes upwards.</p><p>&lsquo;Bud, Uncle Yoong will get you three.,&rsquo; He accepts the tight hug his promise grants him, kissing the top of Jiwoo&rsquo;s dark strands before dropping him to the ground. &lsquo;Put your shoes on so we can get going, okay?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;One.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s hard to miss the word mouthed by Seokjin towards Yoongi as Jiwoo is distracted, running quickly to grab his shoes from their spot near the door.</p><p>&lsquo;So, you down for a drink tonight?&rsquo; Yoongi asks again as Jiwoo prepares himself, struggling to slip his feet into the pair small adidas sneakers. Distracted, you swing yourself around to aid him. </p><p>&lsquo;I&hellip; I&rsquo;ll have to play it by ear.,&rsquo; Seokjin flicks a quick glimpse in your direction he thinks you won&rsquo;t notice - a silent mention to Yoongi, who nods back knowingly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll probably have work tomorrow.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;All good&hellip; Just let me know, yeah?,&rsquo; He refocuses his attention on the little boy, whos shoes are now fastened securely to his feet thanks to you. &lsquo;Hey, Ji-man, remember what Uncle Yoongi taught you last time?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Square up!&rsquo; Jiwoo shouts, hands automatically balling into small fits to over his face, a cheap imitation of a boxing stance. </p><p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right! Go square up to your Dad and tell him you&rsquo;re gonna eat three scoops of ice cream, then let&rsquo;s get going.&rsquo; At Yoongi&rsquo;s suggestion, Jiwoo bounces forward - hands flailing in any direction before making light contact with the denim of Seokjin&rsquo;s pants - scuffing the material playfully. </p><p>&lsquo;Sqaure up, Dad!,&rsquo; Jiwoo squwaks happily. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna eat three scoops of ice cream!&rsquo; Seokjin bundles the boy into his arms, broad shoulders stretching down to pin the child&rsquo;s wild arms to his side in a bear hug. </p><p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I&rsquo;m not coming with you&hellip; or you&rsquo;d get none!,&rsquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s next action draws a strong shriek from Jiwoo as his lips raining kisses against his chubby, thick cheeks. Jiwoo&rsquo;s body struggles, squirming in his father&rsquo;s grip to fight against the affection. &lsquo;I love you buddy, I&rsquo;ll come pick you up from Uncle Yoongi&rsquo;s later, alright?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;I love you too, Daddy.,&rsquo; Relenting, Jiwoo sinks into the embrace - tiny arms wrapping around Seokjin&rsquo;s neck to nuzzle tightly against him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a short sentence - a small, immeasurable utterance of three words murmurder just below Seokjin&rsquo;s ear - but it&rsquo;s too hard not to notice the swell of Seokjin&rsquo;s chest puffing out happily. </p><p>&lsquo;Right Ji-man&hellip; Let&rsquo;s go. Uncle Yoongi&rsquo;s double parked.&rsquo; Yoongi presses, watching as Seokjin gives him a final squeeze before </p><p>&lsquo;Wait&hellip;,&rsquo; Jiwoo wiggles from underneath Seokjin&rsquo;s palms, skipping his way towards you. &lsquo;Bye, ____ . I love you.&rsquo; He flings his arms around your neck, and it&rsquo;s only then that you realise you&rsquo;ve been crouched on the floor down by the shoes far to long for it not to be awkward. Giving him a swift pat on the back, endeared by his remembrance of you, you watch as he waves his final goodbyes before he disappears out the door, hand in hand with the man that had promised him three scoops of ice cream. </p><p>&lsquo;Three scoops, huh?,&rsquo; Hands dusting lightly over your jeans to smooth out the wrinkles in the denim, you straighten your body, stepping out of your shoes and up onto the small ledge that distinguishes between the entrance and the hardwood floor of Seokjin&rsquo;s luxurious apartment. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of ice cream for such a little guy.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Eh, Tell me about it&hellip; Yoongi&rsquo;s not the one that has to put a four year old with that much sugar in his system to bed. Sometimes I wonder if he does it to torture me&hellip;,&rsquo; Seokjin steps towards you, arms opening up to draw you into a half hug. The strong, wafting scent of his cologne sinks into you - filtering through to a foggy bank of memories you have from that night. &lsquo;How have you been, anyway?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been alright. Mmm&hellip; You smell good.,&rsquo; Throwing the compliment to ease the awkward tension growing between the both of you, you take the opportunity as you step back to view him once more - taking in the soft warmth of the more casual style he had adopted for today. It seems to work, and the heaviness of the conversation you&rsquo;re about to undertake slips slightly in the form of a smile from him. &nbsp;&lsquo;This is the first time I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a suit, you know?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Do you approve?&rsquo; A light chuckle falls from his lips, cheeks perking as his mouth creases upwards. Although you&rsquo;re sure it wasn&rsquo;t his intent, a crackle of energy sparks inside you, causing a tinge of heat to threaten your cheeks.</p><p>&lsquo;Most definitely.&rsquo; You hold his gaze as you speak, shoulders staunch in their resolve not to let him know the effect he was having on you. God, it was just too easy to fall back into flirting with him. </p><p>&lsquo;Come in&hellip; come in&hellip;,&rsquo; He steps back, freeing space for you to pace next to him. &lsquo;I appreciate you coming here. I know it was a big ask, especially considering last time&hellip; but Jiwoo was really excited to see you, right?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Yeah. If only briefly. He&rsquo;s a really cute kid, Seokjin.,&rsquo; Trailing ever so slightly behind him, you make your way through the apartment, instantly spying two wine glasses set out on the table, one half filled that had evidently been consumed by Seokjin. &lsquo;I like him a lot.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;I think the feeling is pretty mutual&hellip; He hasn&rsquo;t stopped talking about you since you looked after him. He&rsquo;s grown quite fond of </p><p>friend ____ . Keeps asking when you&rsquo;re coming around again.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Liquid courage?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s you that chuckles this time, a lazy hand motioning to the spread of glasses on the table. </p><p>&lsquo;Something like that&hellip;&rsquo; He flattens his puffy lips, a rough burst of air causing them to vibrate heavily as he lets out a sigh. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not drunk&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t do that, not while I&rsquo;m looking after Jiwoo. I was gonna wait until you got here, but I just thought fuck it and had half a glass.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;What is so bad that you have to drink to tell me?&rsquo; The heaviness of the room expands, and you sense that Seokjin&rsquo;s usually happy and jovial personality had been sinking quickly since the departure of his son. The fact that he&rsquo;d consumed half a glass of wine before you&rsquo;d even arrived, though&hellip; that was news. </p><p>&lsquo;Take a seat, I&rsquo;ll pour you a glass and we can get started.&rsquo; Like a true gentleman, he pulls the chair our, hand sweeping over it in a grand gesture. Even nervous, he oozes the well bred mannerisms that had drawn you to him that night in the club. As you sit, he allows his hand to dust over your shoulder lightly - a gentle, airy touch that without your history you would have thought unintentional. But, it lingers just a little too long for you not to feel that deep pull of attraction again. </p><p>Sitting, you watch as he grabs the bottle - wrist twisting upwards to pour the red liquid. It sloshes freely into the cup, dark amber and clear. No doubt an expensive vintage. </p><p>&lsquo;Cheers.,&rsquo; After he sits, you raise your glass towards him, saluting it high in the air. &lsquo;To liquid courage and friendship.&rsquo; Your line makes Seokjin laugh, and he quickly mimicks you by raising his glass to clink against yours. </p><p>A brief, awkward silence falls between the both of you. </p><p>&lsquo;God&hellip; where do I even start&hellip;&rsquo; He sighs deeply after he drinks in a large sip. He&rsquo;d need more help than you thought&hellip; perhaps a direct line of questioning would be the ice breaker needed?</p><p>&lsquo;Well, what about Jiwoo&rsquo;s Mum?,&rsquo; The wine is deeply rich, the fruity tang of the tannins bursting over your tongue as you hold it to savour the taste. &lsquo;How did you meet her? That should be pretty straight forward, right?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;In a club&hellip; Our stories were pretty similar, actually&hellip; I was drunk, she was drunk&hellip; I was hot, she was hot&hellip; Drunk and hot seems to be kinda my thing.,&rsquo; His head dips as he shakes the shaggy strands from his eyes, playful smirk peeking out from behind his dark locks. &lsquo;I used to&hellip; uhhh&hellip; go out a little bit more back then. I ran into her a few more times, through mutual friends and stuff&hellip; one thing lead to another, and we were dating.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Well, that all seems pretty typical? What&rsquo;s so bad about that?&rsquo; You swallow again, drawing the juice slowly into your mouth as you peer at Seokjin from over the rim of the crystal. </p><p>&lsquo;I guess my parents never really liked her&hellip;,&rsquo; A dismissive shrug. Another sip of wine, his fat, full lips turning slightly reddish from the liquid. The shine of the wetness made them look even more inviting. &lsquo;My father always told me she was really bad. That she only saw dollar signs in me&hellip; god, he couldn&rsquo;t have been more right. But&hellip; you know, when you think you&rsquo;re in love.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;So you weren&rsquo;t really in love?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s easy to prompt him now that he&rsquo;s started. Seokjin was a natural talker, and the words were spilling freely from his mouth. </p><p>&lsquo;Maybe I was.,&rsquo; Absently, he shrugs. &lsquo;She wasn&rsquo;t, though. It became pretty clear what she wanted when Jiwoo happened&hellip;&rsquo; His eyes dart away, the mention of his son&rsquo;s name triggering something deeper to stir inside him. </p><p>&lsquo;Jin, you don&rsquo;t have to tell me, if you don&rsquo;t want to&hellip;,&rsquo; A single hand comes up to rest against his forearm, the warmth of your touch causing his gaze to refocus, staring straight into you. &lsquo;I mean&hellip; I know what Jiwoo means to you. You don&rsquo;t have to tell me this, if it&rsquo;s going to hurt you.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;____.,&rsquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s hand shifts up to rest over your fingers, cupping his knuckles over yours. &lsquo;Is it weird that you&rsquo;re the first girl I&rsquo;ve felt comfortable talking about this with? I mean, I was scared&hellip; but seeing how Jiwoo is with you - it really makes me feel like I can trust you. Plus, you deserve to know. Especially when I was such a dick to you.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m listening&rsquo; A warm hearted smile dusts your lips, Seokjin&rsquo;s sentiment sinking through the caress of his palm into you. Despite the conversation, it felt oddly intimate to be so close to him. </p><p>&lsquo;So Jiwoo&hellip; He&rsquo;s the best thing that happened to me, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I would not live my life any other way. But, his conception was&hellip; a surprise, to put it nicely. I guess younger me thought I was infallible - like most men in their early 20s who put pleasure before logic - and with some alcohol it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to convince me not to use a condom. I did what I thought was right, bought a ring on the credit card my father let me have.,&rsquo; Another sip from the glass. &lsquo;He is a CEO. Well, was a CEO at the time. I&rsquo;m not talking little league stuff, either. This is really dragging on, though&hellip; basically, he thought she got pregnant on purpose and refused to let me marry her. I wanted to marry her anyway, and as a result he cut me off. No money, no support&hellip; he hasn&rsquo;t ever seen his only Grandson, actually.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;What?,&rsquo; Your jaw slacks, and it&rsquo;s Seokjin&rsquo;s hand that squeezes yours in comfort this time. &lsquo;But Jiwoo is&hellip; Jiwoo. He&rsquo;s adorable.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t need to tell me that twice.,&rsquo; A smile cracks across his lips&hellip; one that sinks it&rsquo;s way upwards and just brushes his eyes in the form of slightly crinkled crows feet. &lsquo;But, just to flatter my genetics, you can&hellip;&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Jin, I&rsquo;ve never met a kid like Jiwoo. He&rsquo;s so cute. I can&rsquo;t believe your father wouldn&rsquo;t want to meet him.&rsquo; Still happy, the smile perks across Seokjin&rsquo;s face more, his free hand coming to rub ever so slightly across your chin affectionately. It&rsquo;s meant playfully, but the gesture is highly intimate and you can feel the way your own body betrays you by nuzzling into it.</p><p>&lsquo;The way I see it, it&rsquo;s my Dad&rsquo;s loss. People who appreciate Jiwoo deserve him in their life. People who make the effort to ensure his happiness, are worthy of him. He&rsquo;s got a great bunch of people who shower him with affection. He knows he is loved. He doesn&rsquo;t need my Dad around. Actually, my Dad would be lucky to have </p><p>around.,&rsquo; His fingers splay lightly against your fingers, tracing slow circles as his free one leaves your face and picks up the wine to suck another sip. &lsquo;Take Yoongi, for example. You probably picked up that he&rsquo;s unique. Not everyone appreciates that I let him spend so much time around my kid. But, he always has Jiwoo in his heart - and Jiwoo loves him more than anything. Yoongi makes time for him, always has and always will. Yoongi makes him feel loved and appreciated. Always has, and always will. When I had nothing, Yoongi was one of the first to step in and offer me a place to stay with Jiwoo. Between him and Joon, in some weird and fucked up kinda way, we built a little family. That&rsquo;s what matters.&rsquo; </p><p>Your mind flashes back to the man shrouded in the doorway, his initial dark and brooding form softening as soon as Jiwoo had sprinted towards him. He&rsquo;d barely said a word to you, barely acknowledged your existence - but there was no mistaking the love he&rsquo;d shown that kid. Despite the swearing and the promise of too much ice cream, it was obvious he had a deep connection with the child. </p><p>&lsquo;So, after your father cut you off, what happened?,&rsquo; You drag another deep sip from your glass, eager to hear the rest of his story. </p><p>&lsquo;Well, this is the part that hurts the most&hellip; so excuse me, I&rsquo;m just gonna top up my vessle.&rsquo; Before he can reach for the bottle, you&rsquo;ve clutched it - quickly pouring the contents to refil his almost empty wine. </p><p>&lsquo;Here, let me.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s an excuse to free yourself from his hand. It was feeling far too good, having the comfort of his fingers lacing against your skin to soothe you. Feeling far too familiar as he warmed the flesh on the back of your hand, soaking his attention through to your bones. You needed an escape, because tonight you didn&rsquo;t want to end up in his bed. </p><p>Once you&rsquo;re done, your hands slip under the table - falling squarely on your knees as a form of security. Seokjin bobs his head in appreciation before taking another sip. </p><p>&lsquo;Okay, so&hellip;,&rsquo; Seokjin breathes deeply. &lsquo;I married Jiwoo&rsquo;s mother, against my father&rsquo;s wishes. It was a paper only wedding, because I had no support for an actually celebration. It was a pretty rude awakening, going from CEO&rsquo;s son to dirt poor literally overnight&hellip; We skipped around cheap apartments for a bit - I had a bit of savings that covered us while she was pregnant, but not much. No one tells you how expensive babies are, even before they are born. We had to get scans and prenatals and go to doctors appointments. By the time Jiwoo was out, I had about a dollar to my name. I&rsquo;m just lucky that Yoongi let us live with them, and Joon helped out when he could afford to spare some extra cash. They were both just starting out, but&hellip;&rsquo; He sighs, dipping his head deeply as he looks down towards his lap - attempting to hide the shame dancing across his cheeks. </p><p>It&rsquo;s you that reaches out your hand, breaking your own rule to rest it across his ando stroke over the low bend in his knuckles. It was almost instinctive, as you watched the emotion swell in his shoulders, hunching them protectively to shield his face. It takes him a while to collect himself, to breathe deeply enough to soothe the troubled emotions threatening to spill from his eyes. </p><p>&lsquo;You okay?&rsquo; You probe, fingers twisting around his wrist to squeeze it reassuringly. It&rsquo;s a few moments before he speaks, his head not lifting to greet yours. </p><p>&lsquo;Jiwoo completely changed my life. He motivated me to start my company, get my life together&hellip; I know I work hard, and sometimes I&rsquo;m trying to balance too much by looking after him and working in such a high pressure job. We just keep growing and become more and more successful - I&rsquo;ve got enough money in my bank now to provide for him, and some spare for enjoying a fine wine with beautiful woman every now and again. But it&rsquo;s taken a lot of sweat and tears to get here. I&rsquo;d do it all over in a heartbeat for him.,&rsquo; Still glancing down, the deep sniff rattling through his chest notifies you something is dangerously off. &lsquo;It really hurts when I think about his Mum&hellip; how she can&rsquo;t see it like I do. My Dad, I can let that go&hellip; I never really expected him to have a relationship with Jiwoo. But his Mum? She couldn&rsquo;t care less about him, aside from the child support. My Dad was dead right. All she saw in me was dollar signs, and now all she sees in her son is more dollar signs.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Jin, I&rsquo;m so sorry&hellip;&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a pathetic, empty sentence that you know offers little comfort to him - but what else could you say? </p><p>&lsquo;If I had my way, she wouldn&rsquo;t get to take him at all. It&rsquo;s exhausting. The irregular schedules she keeps - dropping him off half way through a mandated custody arrangement because she&rsquo;s sick of looking after him. The way I have to think of suck quick lies to stop him from understanding that his own Mum doesn&rsquo;t even care enough to look after him&hellip;,&rsquo; His shoulders shudder, and when he stretches up - his eyes are much clearer than you&rsquo;d anticipated, only slightly redder and wider than usual. &lsquo;You know, I thought I could talk about this without getting emotional&hellip; But it just hurts, thinking about it all. There is still a lot more to Jiwoo&rsquo;s story&hellip; I just don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to drink enough wine to get through it all tonight.&rsquo; </p><p>As he sits there, red eyes glistening with tears he&rsquo;d faught so hard to keep from falling, a stitch of regret works it&rsquo;s way through the pit of your stomach. It had always been obvious to you that Seokjin cared for Jiwoo, and would do anything to help him. But the ferocity with which he had defended his actions last time you met made so much more sense, now that you knew the backstory behind it all&hellip; </p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m usually not that into conspiracy theories, but is this your way of trying to see me again?,&rsquo; The jest is meant to lighten the air - to ease the tension that was hunched deeply in Seokjin&rsquo;s broad and wide shoulders. It works, because as your hand soothes over his and a light laugh dances from his lips, they slack slightly as he relaxes. &lsquo;I might not have a fancy vintage wine from my personal cellar, but I do have two thirds of a bottle of cheap vodka I&rsquo;m more than willing to share.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;God, I can see why Jiwoo likes you so much&hellip;,&rsquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s gaze settles on you - the smile remaining on his lips as he leans slightly closer to close the gap between your bodies over the corner of the table you were seated at. He studies you - eyes scanning yours, searching for a short hint of something you were unsure of. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s always been a good judge of character.&rsquo; </p><p>What happens next is so surreal, it almost feels like a scene from a movie. </p><p>As Seokjin moves in, you find yourself mirroring his stance, your own torso angling itself towards the musky wood notes of his perfume coming towards you as he invades your space. The approach is slow and mutual, both of you edging closer to each other at equal speeds. It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise you when your lips meet - not when both of you had been so generously touchy with each other so far - but somehow it does. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a soft bump at first - a subtle, testing peck that doesn&rsquo;t take much effort from either of you. But god, you&rsquo;d be lying if the plump curve of Seokjin&rsquo;s juiced lips didn&rsquo;t feel too good for you to want more. Slick and wet from the wine, they&rsquo;re even softer than you remember them being - the perfect amount of moistness. </p><p>He must taste something he likes, too, because soon you are together again - mouths parted slightly, cushioning sweetly as you kiss. It&rsquo;s not long before his tongue probes, parting your lips to slip past your teeth, caressing against your own. The bold flavours of the cab sav are muted slightly by his saliva, but the roll of the muscle against your own has a flood of need hurtling straight towards your core - the taste so similar to when you&rsquo;d first met, that you can hardly control the squeeze of your thighs closer together. </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t do this. No matter how much you wanted it, it wasn&rsquo;t fair to Seokjin - not when he&rsquo;d made such an effort to attempt to explain his situation, putting himself in such a vulnerable position in the process. </p><p>&lsquo;Jin&hellip; Wait&hellip;&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Shit, I&rsquo;m so sorry&hellip; That was not meant to happen.,&rsquo; Seokjin pulls back, tugging at the neck of his hoodie to fan himself. A deep crimson shade has begun to creep over his neck, stretching ruthlessly upwards as he attempts to unfluster his motions. &lsquo;I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I liked it a lot. I just don&rsquo;t want to think I asked you to come so we would&hellip; well, you know.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Yeah, Jin&hellip; It&rsquo;s fine. I liked it too.,&rsquo; Smiling gently, you shake your head slightly - giggling at the red that continues to creep higher, hitting his throat. &lsquo;It was nice. But I don&rsquo;t want to jump into anything after a conversation that heavy, you know?&rsquo; He nods in understanding. </p><p>&lsquo;You know, I promised Jiwoo that I&rsquo;d take him zoo. I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to it, but I have a day off on Sunday&hellip; I just wanted to say that Jiwoo really, really likes you. Whatever you did when you looked after him made a big impression on the kid. I know I snapped the other day, but things with his Mum haven&rsquo;t been easy lately. They&rsquo;re getting a lot harder, too. It&rsquo;s not an excuse, but it&rsquo;s been difficult trying to be rational about that kind of stuff. I just want the best for him, and I really took my stress out on you. I&rsquo;m really, really sorry&hellip;,&rsquo; The soft furrow of his brow shows his sincerity as he speaks. &lsquo;I really think you&rsquo;re good for Jiwoo. He&rsquo;s got a knack for attracting good people. I hope I didn&rsquo;t put you off&hellip; and if I did, again I&rsquo;m really sorry. But, if you&rsquo;re available, you&rsquo;re free to join us?&rsquo; </p><p>Seeing Seokjin open up had told you so much about him - so much about what you needed to know to continue any kind of friendship with both him and his son. It was crystal clear to you now that he wasn&rsquo;t an irrationally angry man. He was just fiercly protective of his son, and the life he&rsquo;d created for them. </p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take long for you to consider your answer. </p><p>&lsquo;Do they have penguins at the zoo? If so, I&rsquo;m in. They&rsquo;re my favourite.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s funny&hellip;,&rsquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s smile broadens as he chuckles. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re Jiwoo&rsquo;s favourite, too.&rsquo; </p></p>",
