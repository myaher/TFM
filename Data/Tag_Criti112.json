Maybe once pike is starting to acknowledge her feelings for scanlan are more than she wanted them to be, he was a) rescinding his proposal and saying they just need to be friends and then b) leaving the group due to his own personal crisis based off a few false assumptions about his place in their group. And when she started missing him and then wondering if maybe he wasn\u2019t coming back, she started regretting not realizing the depth of her affection earlier. Scanlan may have gone about it wrong and not shown his real self like he ought to have, but he was up front about his feelings for her. She wasn\u2019t. Maybe that\u2019s her interpretation here.</p><p>Also the \u201cyou\u2019ll let me break you down\u201d and \u201cshow me how\u201d really speaks for these particular people, who are both superficially open but hide their real feelings about themselves to almost everyone.

But i think when scanlan left pike realized a) how much space he actually took up in her thoughts, even when she was the one going away and b) that he felt as alone as she did, as separate from the group as she did. And when he came back her anger softened very quickly but it softened the most when scanlan said he\u2019d been praying to sarenrae\u2014bc it was proof that he took part of her with him too. </p><p>I think that\u2019s what going on with this song choice, and her word choice in the final episode and the campaign wrap up when she said \u201cit was always scanlan\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather spend the rest of my days with.\u201d </p><p>She wants to be definitive and decisive with those words finally and say always and the rest of her life to say neither of them are capable of leaving without a piece of the other. </p><p>And I really love that\u2019s her song for scanlan, who was defined for so long by his pining, that she\u2019s always been thinking about him. </p>",
