With it came a rush of panic that turned into actual anxiety that turned into somewhat severe heart palpitations.</p><p>It was Kaminari who called him. He wasn\u2019t even going to answer because that fucker was always calling to tell him about a cat he saw or something he ate earlier. But he did answer this time, after the 3rd ring. Because it was clear he wasn\u2019t going to stop.</p><p>And Kaminari didn\u2019t laugh or call him some endearing name that the squad decided was the new nickname of the month. He just called him by his actual name. Which immediately set him on edge and had him panicky. </p><p>\u201cKirishima\u2019s been hurt\u2026\u201d</p><p>The trail off is what got him. He didn\u2019t add to it, didn\u2019t say anything afterwards, just waited for a reaction.</p><p>A reaction that Bakugou didn\u2019t have, because he was too busy dropping his glass of water and freezing up in their kitchen. The kitchen that he and Kirishima shared.</p><p>\u201cBakugou?\u201d</p><p>He never cried. Kiri made him watch movies that had beloved characters dying or dogs getting hurt or things that would make normal people cry. But he never cried, because he didn\u2019t know those people or those dogs, and he was a tough motherfucker who just didn\u2019t cry. But he knows Kirishima. He knows how he likes his eggs in the morning, that he likes the house temp just so, and that he wears socks to bed only to stick his legs out from the blanket without monsters grabbing him.</p><p>And every image of having to cook breakfast alone, being too hot or too cold in his own house, or not having scratchy feet kick at him in the night, just came flooding in. And the tears came flooding out. </p><p>But he was still frozen. Unable to move until Kaminari took it back, or expanded at least.</p><p>\u201cHe had to be airlifted to the hospital\u2026 but\u2026\u201d</p><p>And Bakugou didn\u2019t hear the end of the sentence. Just needed to know that one detail to break him from his trance to get him moving.</p><p>He made record speed, was at the hospital in less than 20 minutes and screaming at the closest person to find him his boyfriend or he would kill them. Anger management wasn\u2019t really at the forefront of his mind.</p><p>And that\u2019s how he got to the ICU. Sitting at the side of a clearly battered Kirishima.</p><p>There were wires and tubes and things that just ended up giving Bakugou more heart palpitations. He had bandages covering his right arm and stitches in his forehead. And he was probably unconscious. </p><p>\u201cYou idiot. You fuckin idiot, I swear to god Ei.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now,\u201d Kirishima opened his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to talk to someone who\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p><p>And with those few simple words, every bit of relief Bakugou has ever experienced came flooding in. And those same tears from earlier came flooding out.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou laid his head next to Kirishima, too scared to touch him.</p><p>\u201cFuck, don\u2019t you ever do that to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d and Kirishima\u2019s voice was so soft, like he thought Bakugou would break any minute. \u201cWanna stay in tonight?
