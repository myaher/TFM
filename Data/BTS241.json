It\u2019s an incredible honor to be invited to an occasion with such significance for today\u2019s generation. Last November BTS launched the Love Myself campaign with UNICEF. Building on our belief that true love first begins with loving myself. We have been partnering with UNICEF\u2019s end violence program to protect children and young people all over the world from violence. And our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their actions and with their enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world. </p><p>I&rsquo;d like to begin by talking about myself, I was born in Ilsan a city near Seoul, SK. It is a really beautiful place with a lake, hills and even an annual flower festival. I spent a very happy childhood there and I was just an ordinary boy. I used to look up at the night sky in wonder and I used to dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a superhero who could save the world. </p><p>In an intro to one of our early albums, there\u2019s a line that says my heart stopped maybe when I was 9 or 10. Looking back I think that\u2019s when I began to think about what other people thought of me and started seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the night skies, the stars, I stopped daydreaming. Instead I just tried to jam myself into the molds that other people made. Soon I began to shut out my own voice and started to listen to the voices of others. No one called out my name and neither did I. </p><p>My heart stopped and my eyes closed shut. So like this I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts. But I had one century and that was music. There was a small voice inside of me that said \u201cwake up man, listen to yourself.\u201d But it took me quite a long time to hear music call my real name. Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were a lot of hurdles, some people might not believe, but most people thought we were hopeless and sometimes I just wanted to quit. But I think I was very lucky that I didn\u2019t give it all up and I\u2019m sure that I, and we, will keep stumbling and falling like this. </p><p>BTS has become artists performing in those huge stadiums and selling millions of albums right now but I am still an ordinary 24-year-old guy. If there\u2019s anything that I\u2019ve achieved it was only possible because I have my other BTS members right by my side and because of the love and the support that our Army fans all over the world made for us. And maybe I made a mistake yesterday but yesterday\u2019s me is still me. Today I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser and that\u2019d be me too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I am for who I was and for who I hope to become. </p><p>I&rsquo;d like to say the one last thing, after releasing our love yourself albums and launching the love myself campaign, we started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world, how our message helped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves. Those stories constantly remind us of our responsibility. </p><p>So let\u2019s take all one more step, we have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to speak yourself. I&rsquo;d like to ask all of you, what is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat, tell me your story. I wanna hear your voice I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you\u2019re from, your skin color, your gender identity just speak yourself. Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself. </p><p>I\u2019m Kim Namjoon and also RM of BTS. I\u2019m an idol and an artist from a small town in Korea. Like most people I\u2019ve made many and plenty of mistakes in my life. I have many faults and I have many more fears but I\u2019m gonna embrace myself as hard as I can and I\u2019m starting to love myself gradually just little by little. What is your name? Speak yourself. Thank you very much.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s an incredible honor to be invited to an occasion with such significance for today\u2019s generation. Last November BTS launched the Love Myself campaign with UNICEF. Building on our belief that true love first begins with loving myself. We have been partnering with UNICEF\u2019s end violence program to protect children and young people all over the world from violence. And our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their actions and with their enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world. </p><p>I\u2019d like to begin by talking about myself, I was born in Ilsan a city near Seoul, SK. It is a really beautiful place with a lake, hills and even an annual flower festival. I spent a very happy childhood there and I was just an ordinary boy. I used to look up at the night sky in wonder and I used to dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a superhero who could save the world. </p><p>In an intro to one of our early albums, there\u2019s a line that says my heart stopped maybe when I was 9 or 10. Looking back I think that\u2019s when I began to think about what other people thought of me and started seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the night skies, the stars, I stopped daydreaming. Instead I just tried to jam myself into the molds that other people made. Soon I began to shut out my own voice and started to listen to the voices of others. No one called out my name and neither did I. </p><p>My heart stopped and my eyes closed shut. So like this I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts. But I had one century and that was music. There was a small voice inside of me that said \u201cwake up man, listen to yourself.\u201d But it took me quite a long time to hear music call my real name. Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were a lot of hurdles, some people might not believe, but most people thought we were hopeless and sometimes I just wanted to quit. But I think I was very lucky that I didn\u2019t give it all up and I\u2019m sure that I, and we, will keep stumbling and falling like this. </p><p>BTS has become artists performing in those huge stadiums and selling millions of albums right now but I am still an ordinary 24-year-old guy. If there\u2019s anything that I\u2019ve achieved it was only possible because I have my other BTS members right by my side and because of the love and the support that our Army fans all over the world made for us. And maybe I made a mistake yesterday but yesterday\u2019s me is still me. Today I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser and that\u2019d be me too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I am for who I was and for who I hope to become. </p><p>I\u2019d like to say the one last thing, after releasing our love yourself albums and launching the love myself campaign, we started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world, how our message helped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves. Those stories constantly remind us of our responsibility. </p><p>So let\u2019s take all one more step, we have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to speak yourself. I\u2019d like to ask all of you, what is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat, tell me your story. I wanna hear your voice I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you\u2019re from, your skin color, your gender identity just speak yourself. Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself. </p><p>I\u2019m Kim Namjoon and also RM of BTS. I\u2019m an idol and an artist from a small town in Korea. Like most people I\u2019ve made many and plenty of mistakes in my life. I have many faults and I have many more fears but I\u2019m gonna embrace myself as hard as I can and I\u2019m starting to love myself gradually just little by little. What is your name? Speak yourself. Thank you very much.\u201d</p>",
