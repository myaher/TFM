Lyanna frown, sensing there was something he wasn&rsquo;t saying.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry if I\u2026 embarrassed you,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI did not mean to overstep.\u201d \u00a0It had not occurred to her in the heat of the moment that she had not put into question the manhood of those unsavory squires but Lord Reed\u2019s as well. \u00a0\u201cThat was not at all my intention.\u201d</p><p>The Northerner</p><p>\u00a0looked over at the she wolf curiously. \u201cYou did not embarrass me Lady Stark-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Lyanna,\u201d she interjected.</p><p>\u201cLyanna,\u201d he continued with a smile as they rounded the corner that led to another row of large tents. \u00a0\u201cEmbarrassed is hardly the word I would have used. \u00a0It was actually rather impressive for a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean for a lady,\u201d she replied seemingly irked.</p><p>\u201cI-I, uh,\u201d Howland stumbled on his words, \u201cI mean no offense mi\u2019lady. \u00a0I just meant-\u201d \u00a0Lyanna stopped abruptly in front of a tent and faced Howland. \u00a0She stared blankly at him for a moment in silence.</p><p>\u201cI am only joking Lord Reed,\u201d she assured him with a smile. \u00a0\u201cI know what you meant.\u201d \u00a0Howland relaxed as Lyanna walked past him entering the tent. \u00a0\u201cNed,\u201d she called out as he followed in behind her. \u00a0He looked around the tent for a moment before they fell onto a man seated across the room sharpening his blade. \u00a0Ned didn\u2019t look much older than Howland himself though his build was far more athletic. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is Lord Howland Reed of Graywater Watch, one of our father\u2019s bannermen,\u201d she said introducing the pair. \u00a0\u201cHowland, this is my older brother Eddard Stark. \u00a0But we call him Ned.\u201d \u00a0The young wolf rose from his seat, setting the sword off to the side. \u00a0\u201cPleasure to meet you Lord Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you Lord Stark,\u201d Howland replied. \u00a0It was obvious the man was exactly full of confidence. \u00a0But he was polite with kind eyes which made him comfortable to be around. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNed, please,\u201d the young wolf replied with a welcoming smile. \u00a0\u201cWhat happened there,\u201d he asked motioning to Reed\u2019s wounded elbow.</p><p>\u201cThat is actually why we are here,\u201d Lyanna spoke up as the offered the injured Howland a chair. \u00a0\u201cHe got hurt while training so I told him I would fix him up before the feast, \u201cshe smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe feast,\u201d Lord Reed questioned as he sat down.</p><p>\u201cYes, the opening feast of the tournament,\u201d Lyanna answered as she took a seat across from him. \u00a0She laid out a damn cloth along with some dry ones. \u00a0She began to gently wipe away the dirt and small bit of blood from his wound. \u00a0Howland jumped when the warm cloth first made contact with his skin but quickly relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI honestly, had no plans of attending, mi\u2019lady,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNonsense! \u00a0You have just as much a right to be there as anyone else,\u201d she continued as she cleaned his wound. \u00a0The injury didn\u2019t seem to be as bad as it had first appeared. \u00a0A minor scrap from a rock she assumed. \u00a0Thankfully no stitches were needed. \u00a0\u201cYou can be my escort if it please you,\u201d she added with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t bring anything to wear to a feast,\u201d he replied softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my brothers and I can assist you with that,\u201d Ned chimed in. \u00a0\u201cMy sister won\u2019t take no for an answer so you best admit defeat now.\u201d \u00a0Ned gave a small laugh as he rested a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>***</p><p>The tourney\u2019s opening feast was in full swing in the Hall of the Hundred Hearths. \u00a0The great hall was beautifully decorated with each of its 35 hearths lit. \u00a0The tables each had their own set of golden candelabras that were surrounded by beautiful orange, yellow and white flowers of all kinds wrapped around its base. \u00a0Every lord and lady of the Seven Kingdoms were dressed in their finest. \u00a0Ned and Benjen had helped Lord Reed dress for the feast and Lyanna asked him to be her escort despite the protest for her betrothed Storm Lord. </p><p>Robert Baratheon was not at all pleased with the idea of another man escorting his future wife but Lyanna assured him there was nothing to worry about. \u00a0Though he was to be her lord husband, the she wolf was not thrilled to be marrying him. \u00a0Ned tried to convince his only sister that his best friend was in fact in love with her but Lyanna knew it would never be enough to keep him in her bed only. \u00a0And adultery was not something Lady Lyanna was willing to tolerate in her marriage. His excessive drinking was the other issue.</p><p>They were barely half way through the feast and Robert had already begun a drinking game with several of the other lords. \u00a0The eldest Stark, Brandon was off with some of his friends while Ned and Howland watched Robert engage in his drinking game, leaving Lyanna at the table with only her father and youngest brother Benjen for company. \u00a0A few loud taps against a pewter goblet was heard from the head table where King Aerys and his royal family were seated causing the crowd to quickly fall silent. \u00a0The elderly king sat directly in the middle with his wife, Queen Rhaella to his left holding a young Prince Viserys. \u00a0To his right was his eldest son and heir, Prince Rhaegar and his wife Princess Elia Martell of Dorne. \u00a0In her arms was their young daughter Princess Rhaenys. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is a pleasure to see the many Lords and Ladies of the realm here for the tourney,\u201d the Targaryen King began with a raspy voice. \u00a0\u201cTo celebrate the opening feast, my son Prince Rhaegar wishes to play a song for you\u201d \u00a0The king along with the crowd turned their attention to the silver haired prince who was already seated with his beautiful silver harp on a stage to the left of the head table.</p><p>As he began to play, a soft and sad melody rang through the hall. It was no secret that the prince was a talented harpist, but the rumors had not done him justice. \u00a0The room was silent as he played with only the song of Ice and Fire heard throughout the hall. \u00a0Lyanna had never heard anyone play as beautifully as the prince did. His son was so beautiful that is brought tears to the she wolf\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cLy, are you crying,\u201d Benjen asked with a giggle. \u00a0Irritated that she had been noticed and giggled at for her reaction, Lyanna shoved her younger brother aside as she rose from the table hurrying past him and exiting the hall.</p><p>She wiped her tears away as she followed the small stream that lead to the godswood in search of some peace and quiet to gather herself. \u00a0As a place of worship for the Old Gods, the weirwood trees always brought Lyanna a sense of comfort and relaxation no matter what was happening. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t long before the stream lead her to the weirwood heart tree. \u00a0Its face was not at all like the one in Winterfell. \u00a0This one had a terribly twisted mouth with flaring eyes and several deep marks carved into its bark making it seem as if it was bleeding. \u00a0But it was only the dark red sap from inside the tree.</p><p>Sitting quietly at the tree, Lyanna toyed with the lace at the end of his gown thinking of the sound the prince had played. \u00a0It was a beautiful melody that she couldn\u2019t help to be moved by. She wondered if Robert would ever play such a beautiful tune but she knew better. \u00a0Unfortunately the man was more skilled with a battle axe and not instruments. \u00a0She sighed at the thought of her marriage arrangement. \u00a0Despite her brother\u2019s belief that Robert truly loved her, she didn\u2019t felt that could ever be true. \u00a0He barely knew her but claimed his undying love to be true. \u00a0And based on what she knew of him over the years, she knew should could never truly love him. \u00a0Her marriage was to come soon but the she wolf couldn\u2019t help contemplating a way out as unrealistic as the idea was.</p><p>A snap of a twig brought Lyanna back to reality. \u00a0She looked over her shoulder in the direction of the castle to see a tall and long haired figure approaching her. \u00a0She tried not to be alarmed, knowing she wasn\u2019t so far from the feast that a guard couldn\u2019t hear her scream. \u00a0But her hand to hand combat training with her brothers over the years made her confident that she could defend herself in the meantime if necessary.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there,\u201d she called out to the figure as she rose from the rock she was seated on. \u00a0She looked down at her long silver dress noting it wasn\u2019t the bed thing to be wearing if she needed to defend herself but she knew she could make due if needed.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, are you alright,\u201d she heard the male figure all back to her. \u00a0His voice was not familiar to her but it didn\u2019t seem threatening either. As he slowly approached, the fully lit moon allowed her to better make out the gentleman\u2019s face. \u00a0To her surprise, it was none other than the Prince of Dragonstone himself, Rhaegar Targaryen.</p><p>\u201cI am fine Your Grace,\u201d she answered as she dusted off her silver gown before curtseying before the prince who was now standing a few feet in front of her now.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that my Lady-\u201d he paused waiting for her reply. \u00a0He had learned her name earlier that day but preferred she make her own introduction.</p><p>\u201cLyanna. \u00a0Lyanna Stark,\u201d she responded with a smile.</p><p>\u201cLyanna Stark,\u201d he repeated returning the smile. \u00a0\u201cMay I ask what you are doing out here all alone Lady Lyanna?\u201d</p><p>The Stark looked around for a moment for looking up at the bright full moon shining through the trees. \u00a0\u201cI was just visiting the heart tree Your Grace. \u00a0It\u2019s quite peaceful out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the tree of the Old Gods, yes,\u201d he asked knowingly as he took a step forward, now standing to the left of her. \u00a0He examined the harsh faced tree noting the different slashes in the bark. \u00a0\u201cYou know these marks date back to 130 AC during the Dance of the Dragon,\u201d he commented as he reached out to touch the mangled bark. \u00a0\u201cThe battle between Daemon and Aemon Targaryen if my memory serves me right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not know that actually,\u201d she responded surprised. \u00a0She hadn\u2019t considered what the crown prince would be like but she didn\u2019t expected him to be as casual as he was. \u00a0She watched him carefully as he examined the tree before them, his indigo eyes seeming to shimmer in the moonlight. \u00a0Worrying that the prince may feel her eyes on him, she turned her head back towards the tree hoping he didn\u2019t notice. \u00a0\u201cI enjoy being in the godswood. \u00a0I find them soothing,\u201d she continued, \u201cThough I haven\u2019t seen many outside of Winterfell other than the one in Riverrun. \u00a0They always remind me of home and yes, the Old Gods.\u201d</p><p>The prince looked over at the northern lady and smiled. \u00a0\u201cI can respect that. \u00a0I like-\u201d \u00a0he paused to think for a moment, \u201ca home away from home.</p><p>\u201cYes exactly,\u201d she replied with a hint of a smile. \u00a0Lyanna had never laid eyes on the prince before today but it was easy to see why the many ladies of Westeros seemed to swoon over the silver haired prince. She could easily find herself lost in his violet Valyrian eyes.</p><p>\u201cMay I walk you back to your tent Lady Stark? \u00a0I\u2019m sure a woman of the North can handle her own but I would never forgive myself if something were to happen.\u201d \u00a0Rhaegar held out his arm, offering it to her. \u00a0She looked down before looking back up at him linking her own through his.</p><p>\u201cYou may call me Lyanna, Your Grace. \u00a0If it please you.\u201d \u00a0The pair walked arm and arm, exiting the godwood and heading toward the castle. \u00a0She couldn\u2019t help but feel butterflies in her stomach the moment her arm touched his but she simply wrote it off as nervousness from being in the presence of the prince of the realm.</p><p>\u201cThe please, call me Rhaegar.\u201d \u00a0The casualness of his voice seemed to calm her flutters as they walked.</p><p>\u201cYou play beautifully by the way,\u201d she finally said as they approached the gates. Tents and bonfires surrounded the area. \u00a0Laughs and music could be heard in the distance as the people of the realm enjoyed the end of the first day of the tourney. \u00a0\u201cI was such a beautiful song. \u00a0But it sounded so full of sorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. \u00a0I call it the song of Ice and Fire. \u00a0It\u2019s the first time I have performed it for anyone other than myself,\u201d he replied with a small grin.</p><p>\u201cWell Rhaegar,\u201d his name sounding like music to his ears coming from her lips, \u201cIt was simply beautiful. \u00a0As much as I hate to admit it, it moved me to tears. \u00a0Truly.\u201d</p><p>Rhaegar\u2019s free hand patted her looped arm softly, \u201cthank you Lyanna. \u00a0That means more than you may know. \u00a0He looked down at her once more, his indigo eyes meeting her smoky ones. \u00a0For a moment it felt like the world around Lyanna had stopped. \u00a0The feeling was unlike anything she had ever experienced causing her cheeks to flush. \u00a0But the moment was over as soon as it had begun. \u00a0Before either of them realized, they were standing before the entrance of her tent.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is me,\u201d she declared as she broke away from him. \u00a0\u201cThank you for the escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure was all mine Lyanna. \u00a0Mayhaps we shall stumble upon each other again,\u201d he suggested as he took her hand, placing a small kiss on it.</p><p>\u201cMayhaps we will.\u201d And with that, Lyanna retreated to her tent, leaving the prince alone outside.</p><p><a href=\"https://queen-hayley-mikaelson.tumblr.com/post/164992069155/a-union-of-ice-and-fire-chapter-one\" target=\"_blank\">Previous</a> || Next</p>",

Lyanna frown, sensing there was something he wasn\u2019t saying.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry if I\u2026 embarrassed you,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI did not mean to overstep.\u201d \u00a0It had not occurred to her in the heat of the moment that she had not put into question the manhood of those unsavory squires but Lord Reed\u2019s as well. \u00a0\u201cThat was not at all my intention.\u201d</p><p>The Northerner</p><p>\u00a0looked over at the she wolf curiously. \u201cYou did not embarrass me Lady Stark-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Lyanna,\u201d she interjected.</p><p>\u201cLyanna,\u201d he continued with a smile as they rounded the corner that led to another row of large tents. \u00a0\u201cEmbarrassed is hardly the word I would have used. \u00a0It was actually rather impressive for a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean for a lady,\u201d she replied seemingly irked.</p><p>\u201cI-I, uh,\u201d Howland stumbled on his words, \u201cI mean no offense mi\u2019lady. \u00a0I just meant-\u201d \u00a0Lyanna stopped abruptly in front of a tent and faced Howland. \u00a0She stared blankly at him for a moment in silence.</p><p>\u201cI am only joking Lord Reed,\u201d she assured him with a smile. \u00a0\u201cI know what you meant.\u201d \u00a0Howland relaxed as Lyanna walked past him entering the tent. \u00a0\u201cNed,\u201d she called out as he followed in behind her. \u00a0He looked around the tent for a moment before they fell onto a man seated across the room sharpening his blade. \u00a0Ned didn\u2019t look much older than Howland himself though his build was far more athletic. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is Lord Howland Reed of Graywater Watch, one of our father\u2019s bannermen,\u201d she said introducing the pair. \u00a0\u201cHowland, this is my older brother Eddard Stark. \u00a0But we call him Ned.\u201d \u00a0The young wolf rose from his seat, setting the sword off to the side. \u00a0\u201cPleasure to meet you Lord Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you Lord Stark,\u201d Howland replied. \u00a0It was obvious the man was exactly full of confidence. \u00a0But he was polite with kind eyes which made him comfortable to be around. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNed, please,\u201d the young wolf replied with a welcoming smile. \u00a0\u201cWhat happened there,\u201d he asked motioning to Reed\u2019s wounded elbow.</p><p>\u201cThat is actually why we are here,\u201d Lyanna spoke up as the offered the injured Howland a chair. \u00a0\u201cHe got hurt while training so I told him I would fix him up before the feast, \u201cshe smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe feast,\u201d Lord Reed questioned as he sat down.</p><p>\u201cYes, the opening feast of the tournament,\u201d Lyanna answered as she took a seat across from him. \u00a0She laid out a damn cloth along with some dry ones. \u00a0She began to gently wipe away the dirt and small bit of blood from his wound. \u00a0Howland jumped when the warm cloth first made contact with his skin but quickly relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI honestly, had no plans of attending, mi\u2019lady,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNonsense! \u00a0You have just as much a right to be there as anyone else,\u201d she continued as she cleaned his wound. \u00a0The injury didn\u2019t seem to be as bad as it had first appeared. \u00a0A minor scrap from a rock she assumed. \u00a0Thankfully no stitches were needed. \u00a0\u201cYou can be my escort if it please you,\u201d she added with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t bring anything to wear to a feast,\u201d he replied softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my brothers and I can assist you with that,\u201d Ned chimed in. \u00a0\u201cMy sister won\u2019t take no for an answer so you best admit defeat now.\u201d \u00a0Ned gave a small laugh as he rested a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>***</p><p>The tourney\u2019s opening feast was in full swing in the Hall of the Hundred Hearths. \u00a0The great hall was beautifully decorated with each of its 35 hearths lit. \u00a0The tables each had their own set of golden candelabras that were surrounded by beautiful orange, yellow and white flowers of all kinds wrapped around its base. \u00a0Every lord and lady of the Seven Kingdoms were dressed in their finest. \u00a0Ned and Benjen had helped Lord Reed dress for the feast and Lyanna asked him to be her escort despite the protest for her betrothed Storm Lord. </p><p>Robert Baratheon was not at all pleased with the idea of another man escorting his future wife but Lyanna assured him there was nothing to worry about. \u00a0Though he was to be her lord husband, the she wolf was not thrilled to be marrying him. \u00a0Ned tried to convince his only sister that his best friend was in fact in love with her but Lyanna knew it would never be enough to keep him in her bed only. \u00a0And adultery was not something Lady Lyanna was willing to tolerate in her marriage. His excessive drinking was the other issue.</p><p>They were barely half way through the feast and Robert had already begun a drinking game with several of the other lords. \u00a0The eldest Stark, Brandon was off with some of his friends while Ned and Howland watched Robert engage in his drinking game, leaving Lyanna at the table with only her father and youngest brother Benjen for company. \u00a0A few loud taps against a pewter goblet was heard from the head table where King Aerys and his royal family were seated causing the crowd to quickly fall silent. \u00a0The elderly king sat directly in the middle with his wife, Queen Rhaella to his left holding a young Prince Viserys. \u00a0To his right was his eldest son and heir, Prince Rhaegar and his wife Princess Elia Martell of Dorne. \u00a0In her arms was their young daughter Princess Rhaenys. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is a pleasure to see the many Lords and Ladies of the realm here for the tourney,\u201d the Targaryen King began with a raspy voice. \u00a0\u201cTo celebrate the opening feast, my son Prince Rhaegar wishes to play a song for you\u201d \u00a0The king along with the crowd turned their attention to the silver haired prince who was already seated with his beautiful silver harp on a stage to the left of the head table.</p><p>As he began to play, a soft and sad melody rang through the hall. It was no secret that the prince was a talented harpist, but the rumors had not done him justice. \u00a0The room was silent as he played with only the song of Ice and Fire heard throughout the hall. \u00a0Lyanna had never heard anyone play as beautifully as the prince did. His son was so beautiful that is brought tears to the she wolf\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cLy, are you crying,\u201d Benjen asked with a giggle. \u00a0Irritated that she had been noticed and giggled at for her reaction, Lyanna shoved her younger brother aside as she rose from the table hurrying past him and exiting the hall.</p><p>She wiped her tears away as she followed the small stream that lead to the godswood in search of some peace and quiet to gather herself. \u00a0As a place of worship for the Old Gods, the weirwood trees always brought Lyanna a sense of comfort and relaxation no matter what was happening. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t long before the stream lead her to the weirwood heart tree. \u00a0Its face was not at all like the one in Winterfell. \u00a0This one had a terribly twisted mouth with flaring eyes and several deep marks carved into its bark making it seem as if it was bleeding. \u00a0But it was only the dark red sap from inside the tree.</p><p>Sitting quietly at the tree, Lyanna toyed with the lace at the end of his gown thinking of the sound the prince had played. \u00a0It was a beautiful melody that she couldn\u2019t help to be moved by. She wondered if Robert would ever play such a beautiful tune but she knew better. \u00a0Unfortunately the man was more skilled with a battle axe and not instruments. \u00a0She sighed at the thought of her marriage arrangement. \u00a0Despite her brother\u2019s belief that Robert truly loved her, she didn\u2019t felt that could ever be true. \u00a0He barely knew her but claimed his undying love to be true. \u00a0And based on what she knew of him over the years, she knew should could never truly love him. \u00a0Her marriage was to come soon but the she wolf couldn\u2019t help contemplating a way out as unrealistic as the idea was.</p><p>A snap of a twig brought Lyanna back to reality. \u00a0She looked over her shoulder in the direction of the castle to see a tall and long haired figure approaching her. \u00a0She tried not to be alarmed, knowing she wasn\u2019t so far from the feast that a guard couldn\u2019t hear her scream. \u00a0But her hand to hand combat training with her brothers over the years made her confident that she could defend herself in the meantime if necessary.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there,\u201d she called out to the figure as she rose from the rock she was seated on. \u00a0She looked down at her long silver dress noting it wasn\u2019t the bed thing to be wearing if she needed to defend herself but she knew she could make due if needed.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, are you alright,\u201d she heard the male figure all back to her. \u00a0His voice was not familiar to her but it didn\u2019t seem threatening either. As he slowly approached, the fully lit moon allowed her to better make out the gentleman\u2019s face. \u00a0To her surprise, it was none other than the Prince of Dragonstone himself, Rhaegar Targaryen.</p><p>\u201cI am fine Your Grace,\u201d she answered as she dusted off her silver gown before curtseying before the prince who was now standing a few feet in front of her now.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that my Lady-\u201d he paused waiting for her reply. \u00a0He had learned her name earlier that day but preferred she make her own introduction.</p><p>\u201cLyanna. \u00a0Lyanna Stark,\u201d she responded with a smile.</p><p>\u201cLyanna Stark,\u201d he repeated returning the smile. \u00a0\u201cMay I ask what you are doing out here all alone Lady Lyanna?\u201d</p><p>The Stark looked around for a moment for looking up at the bright full moon shining through the trees. \u00a0\u201cI was just visiting the heart tree Your Grace. \u00a0It\u2019s quite peaceful out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the tree of the Old Gods, yes,\u201d he asked knowingly as he took a step forward, now standing to the left of her. \u00a0He examined the harsh faced tree noting the different slashes in the bark. \u00a0\u201cYou know these marks date back to 130 AC during the Dance of the Dragon,\u201d he commented as he reached out to touch the mangled bark. \u00a0\u201cThe battle between Daemon and Aemon Targaryen if my memory serves me right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not know that actually,\u201d she responded surprised. \u00a0She hadn\u2019t considered what the crown prince would be like but she didn\u2019t expected him to be as casual as he was. \u00a0She watched him carefully as he examined the tree before them, his indigo eyes seeming to shimmer in the moonlight. \u00a0Worrying that the prince may feel her eyes on him, she turned her head back towards the tree hoping he didn\u2019t notice. \u00a0\u201cI enjoy being in the godswood. \u00a0I find them soothing,\u201d she continued, \u201cThough I haven\u2019t seen many outside of Winterfell other than the one in Riverrun. \u00a0They always remind me of home and yes, the Old Gods.\u201d</p><p>The prince looked over at the northern lady and smiled. \u00a0\u201cI can respect that. \u00a0I like-\u201d \u00a0he paused to think for a moment, \u201ca home away from home.</p><p>\u201cYes exactly,\u201d she replied with a hint of a smile. \u00a0Lyanna had never laid eyes on the prince before today but it was easy to see why the many ladies of Westeros seemed to swoon over the silver haired prince. She could easily find herself lost in his violet Valyrian eyes.</p><p>\u201cMay I walk you back to your tent Lady Stark? \u00a0I\u2019m sure a woman of the North can handle her own but I would never forgive myself if something were to happen.\u201d \u00a0Rhaegar held out his arm, offering it to her. \u00a0She looked down before looking back up at him linking her own through his.</p><p>\u201cYou may call me Lyanna, Your Grace. \u00a0If it please you.\u201d \u00a0The pair walked arm and arm, exiting the godwood and heading toward the castle. \u00a0She couldn\u2019t help but feel butterflies in her stomach the moment her arm touched his but she simply wrote it off as nervousness from being in the presence of the prince of the realm.</p><p>\u201cThe please, call me Rhaegar.\u201d \u00a0The casualness of his voice seemed to calm her flutters as they walked.</p><p>\u201cYou play beautifully by the way,\u201d she finally said as they approached the gates. Tents and bonfires surrounded the area. \u00a0Laughs and music could be heard in the distance as the people of the realm enjoyed the end of the first day of the tourney. \u00a0\u201cI was such a beautiful song. \u00a0But it sounded so full of sorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. \u00a0I call it the song of Ice and Fire. \u00a0It\u2019s the first time I have performed it for anyone other than myself,\u201d he replied with a small grin.</p><p>\u201cWell Rhaegar,\u201d his name sounding like music to his ears coming from her lips, \u201cIt was simply beautiful. \u00a0As much as I hate to admit it, it moved me to tears. \u00a0Truly.\u201d</p><p>Rhaegar\u2019s free hand patted her looped arm softly, \u201cthank you Lyanna. \u00a0That means more than you may know. \u00a0He looked down at her once more, his indigo eyes meeting her smoky ones. \u00a0For a moment it felt like the world around Lyanna had stopped. \u00a0The feeling was unlike anything she had ever experienced causing her cheeks to flush. \u00a0But the moment was over as soon as it had begun. \u00a0Before either of them realized, they were standing before the entrance of her tent.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is me,\u201d she declared as she broke away from him. \u00a0\u201cThank you for the escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure was all mine Lyanna. \u00a0Mayhaps we shall stumble upon each other again,\u201d he suggested as he took her hand, placing a small kiss on it.</p><p>\u201cMayhaps we will.\u201d And with that, Lyanna retreated to her tent, leaving the prince alone outside.</p><p><a href=\"https://queen-hayley-mikaelson.tumblr.com/post/164992069155/a-union-of-ice-and-fire-chapter-one\" target=\"_blank\">Previous</a> || Next</p></p>",

Lyanna frown, sensing there was something he wasn\u2019t saying.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry if I\u2026 embarrassed you,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI did not mean to overstep.\u201d \u00a0It had not occurred to her in the heat of the moment that she had not put into question the manhood of those unsavory squires but Lord Reed\u2019s as well. \u00a0\u201cThat was not at all my intention.\u201d</p><p>The Northerner</p><p>\u00a0looked over at the she wolf curiously. \u201cYou did not embarrass me Lady Stark-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Lyanna,\u201d she interjected.</p><p>\u201cLyanna,\u201d he continued with a smile as they rounded the corner that led to another row of large tents. \u00a0\u201cEmbarrassed is hardly the word I would have used. \u00a0It was actually rather impressive for a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean for a lady,\u201d she replied seemingly irked.</p><p>\u201cI-I, uh,\u201d Howland stumbled on his words, \u201cI mean no offense mi\u2019lady. \u00a0I just meant-\u201d \u00a0Lyanna stopped abruptly in front of a tent and faced Howland. \u00a0She stared blankly at him for a moment in silence.</p><p>\u201cI am only joking Lord Reed,\u201d she assured him with a smile. \u00a0\u201cI know what you meant.\u201d \u00a0Howland relaxed as Lyanna walked past him entering the tent. \u00a0\u201cNed,\u201d she called out as he followed in behind her. \u00a0He looked around the tent for a moment before they fell onto a man seated across the room sharpening his blade. \u00a0Ned didn\u2019t look much older than Howland himself though his build was far more athletic. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is Lord Howland Reed of Graywater Watch, one of our father\u2019s bannermen,\u201d she said introducing the pair. \u00a0\u201cHowland, this is my older brother Eddard Stark. \u00a0But we call him Ned.\u201d \u00a0The young wolf rose from his seat, setting the sword off to the side. \u00a0\u201cPleasure to meet you Lord Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you Lord Stark,\u201d Howland replied. \u00a0It was obvious the man was exactly full of confidence. \u00a0But he was polite with kind eyes which made him comfortable to be around. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNed, please,\u201d the young wolf replied with a welcoming smile. \u00a0\u201cWhat happened there,\u201d he asked motioning to Reed\u2019s wounded elbow.</p><p>\u201cThat is actually why we are here,\u201d Lyanna spoke up as the offered the injured Howland a chair. \u00a0\u201cHe got hurt while training so I told him I would fix him up before the feast, \u201cshe smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe feast,\u201d Lord Reed questioned as he sat down.</p><p>\u201cYes, the opening feast of the tournament,\u201d Lyanna answered as she took a seat across from him. \u00a0She laid out a damn cloth along with some dry ones. \u00a0She began to gently wipe away the dirt and small bit of blood from his wound. \u00a0Howland jumped when the warm cloth first made contact with his skin but quickly relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI honestly, had no plans of attending, mi\u2019lady,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNonsense! \u00a0You have just as much a right to be there as anyone else,\u201d she continued as she cleaned his wound. \u00a0The injury didn\u2019t seem to be as bad as it had first appeared. \u00a0A minor scrap from a rock she assumed. \u00a0Thankfully no stitches were needed. \u00a0\u201cYou can be my escort if it please you,\u201d she added with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t bring anything to wear to a feast,\u201d he replied softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my brothers and I can assist you with that,\u201d Ned chimed in. \u00a0\u201cMy sister won\u2019t take no for an answer so you best admit defeat now.\u201d \u00a0Ned gave a small laugh as he rested a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>***</p><p>The tourney\u2019s opening feast was in full swing in the Hall of the Hundred Hearths. \u00a0The great hall was beautifully decorated with each of its 35 hearths lit. \u00a0The tables each had their own set of golden candelabras that were surrounded by beautiful orange, yellow and white flowers of all kinds wrapped around its base. \u00a0Every lord and lady of the Seven Kingdoms were dressed in their finest. \u00a0Ned and Benjen had helped Lord Reed dress for the feast and Lyanna asked him to be her escort despite the protest for her betrothed Storm Lord. </p><p>Robert Baratheon was not at all pleased with the idea of another man escorting his future wife but Lyanna assured him there was nothing to worry about. \u00a0Though he was to be her lord husband, the she wolf was not thrilled to be marrying him. \u00a0Ned tried to convince his only sister that his best friend was in fact in love with her but Lyanna knew it would never be enough to keep him in her bed only. \u00a0And adultery was not something Lady Lyanna was willing to tolerate in her marriage. His excessive drinking was the other issue.</p><p>They were barely half way through the feast and Robert had already begun a drinking game with several of the other lords. \u00a0The eldest Stark, Brandon was off with some of his friends while Ned and Howland watched Robert engage in his drinking game, leaving Lyanna at the table with only her father and youngest brother Benjen for company. \u00a0A few loud taps against a pewter goblet was heard from the head table where King Aerys and his royal family were seated causing the crowd to quickly fall silent. \u00a0The elderly king sat directly in the middle with his wife, Queen Rhaella to his left holding a young Prince Viserys. \u00a0To his right was his eldest son and heir, Prince Rhaegar and his wife Princess Elia Martell of Dorne. \u00a0In her arms was their young daughter Princess Rhaenys. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is a pleasure to see the many Lords and Ladies of the realm here for the tourney,\u201d the Targaryen King began with a raspy voice. \u00a0\u201cTo celebrate the opening feast, my son Prince Rhaegar wishes to play a song for you\u201d \u00a0The king along with the crowd turned their attention to the silver haired prince who was already seated with his beautiful silver harp on a stage to the left of the head table.</p><p>As he began to play, a soft and sad melody rang through the hall. It was no secret that the prince was a talented harpist, but the rumors had not done him justice. \u00a0The room was silent as he played with only the song of Ice and Fire heard throughout the hall. \u00a0Lyanna had never heard anyone play as beautifully as the prince did. His son was so beautiful that is brought tears to the she wolf\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cLy, are you crying,\u201d Benjen asked with a giggle. \u00a0Irritated that she had been noticed and giggled at for her reaction, Lyanna shoved her younger brother aside as she rose from the table hurrying past him and exiting the hall.</p><p>She wiped her tears away as she followed the small stream that lead to the godswood in search of some peace and quiet to gather herself. \u00a0As a place of worship for the Old Gods, the weirwood trees always brought Lyanna a sense of comfort and relaxation no matter what was happening. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t long before the stream lead her to the weirwood heart tree. \u00a0Its face was not at all like the one in Winterfell. \u00a0This one had a terribly twisted mouth with flaring eyes and several deep marks carved into its bark making it seem as if it was bleeding. \u00a0But it was only the dark red sap from inside the tree.</p><p>Sitting quietly at the tree, Lyanna toyed with the lace at the end of his gown thinking of the sound the prince had played. \u00a0It was a beautiful melody that she couldn\u2019t help to be moved by. She wondered if Robert would ever play such a beautiful tune but she knew better. \u00a0Unfortunately the man was more skilled with a battle axe and not instruments. \u00a0She sighed at the thought of her marriage arrangement. \u00a0Despite her brother\u2019s belief that Robert truly loved her, she didn\u2019t felt that could ever be true. \u00a0He barely knew her but claimed his undying love to be true. \u00a0And based on what she knew of him over the years, she knew should could never truly love him. \u00a0Her marriage was to come soon but the she wolf couldn\u2019t help contemplating a way out as unrealistic as the idea was.</p><p>A snap of a twig brought Lyanna back to reality. \u00a0She looked over her shoulder in the direction of the castle to see a tall and long haired figure approaching her. \u00a0She tried not to be alarmed, knowing she wasn\u2019t so far from the feast that a guard couldn\u2019t hear her scream. \u00a0But her hand to hand combat training with her brothers over the years made her confident that she could defend herself in the meantime if necessary.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there,\u201d she called out to the figure as she rose from the rock she was seated on. \u00a0She looked down at her long silver dress noting it wasn\u2019t the bed thing to be wearing if she needed to defend herself but she knew she could make due if needed.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, are you alright,\u201d she heard the male figure all back to her. \u00a0His voice was not familiar to her but it didn\u2019t seem threatening either. As he slowly approached, the fully lit moon allowed her to better make out the gentleman\u2019s face. \u00a0To her surprise, it was none other than the Prince of Dragonstone himself, Rhaegar Targaryen.</p><p>\u201cI am fine Your Grace,\u201d she answered as she dusted off her silver gown before curtseying before the prince who was now standing a few feet in front of her now.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that my Lady-\u201d he paused waiting for her reply. \u00a0He had learned her name earlier that day but preferred she make her own introduction.</p><p>\u201cLyanna. \u00a0Lyanna Stark,\u201d she responded with a smile.</p><p>\u201cLyanna Stark,\u201d he repeated returning the smile. \u00a0\u201cMay I ask what you are doing out here all alone Lady Lyanna?\u201d</p><p>The Stark looked around for a moment for looking up at the bright full moon shining through the trees. \u00a0\u201cI was just visiting the heart tree Your Grace. \u00a0It\u2019s quite peaceful out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the tree of the Old Gods, yes,\u201d he asked knowingly as he took a step forward, now standing to the left of her. \u00a0He examined the harsh faced tree noting the different slashes in the bark. \u00a0\u201cYou know these marks date back to 130 AC during the Dance of the Dragon,\u201d he commented as he reached out to touch the mangled bark. \u00a0\u201cThe battle between Daemon and Aemon Targaryen if my memory serves me right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not know that actually,\u201d she responded surprised. \u00a0She hadn\u2019t considered what the crown prince would be like but she didn\u2019t expected him to be as casual as he was. \u00a0She watched him carefully as he examined the tree before them, his indigo eyes seeming to shimmer in the moonlight. \u00a0Worrying that the prince may feel her eyes on him, she turned her head back towards the tree hoping he didn\u2019t notice. \u00a0\u201cI enjoy being in the godswood. \u00a0I find them soothing,\u201d she continued, \u201cThough I haven\u2019t seen many outside of Winterfell other than the one in Riverrun. \u00a0They always remind me of home and yes, the Old Gods.\u201d</p><p>The prince looked over at the northern lady and smiled. \u00a0\u201cI can respect that. \u00a0I like-\u201d \u00a0he paused to think for a moment, \u201ca home away from home.</p><p>\u201cYes exactly,\u201d she replied with a hint of a smile. \u00a0Lyanna had never laid eyes on the prince before today but it was easy to see why the many ladies of Westeros seemed to swoon over the silver haired prince. She could easily find herself lost in his violet Valyrian eyes.</p><p>\u201cMay I walk you back to your tent Lady Stark? \u00a0I\u2019m sure a woman of the North can handle her own but I would never forgive myself if something were to happen.\u201d \u00a0Rhaegar held out his arm, offering it to her. \u00a0She looked down before looking back up at him linking her own through his.</p><p>\u201cYou may call me Lyanna, Your Grace. \u00a0If it please you.\u201d \u00a0The pair walked arm and arm, exiting the godwood and heading toward the castle. \u00a0She couldn\u2019t help but feel butterflies in her stomach the moment her arm touched his but she simply wrote it off as nervousness from being in the presence of the prince of the realm.</p><p>\u201cThe please, call me Rhaegar.\u201d \u00a0The casualness of his voice seemed to calm her flutters as they walked.</p><p>\u201cYou play beautifully by the way,\u201d she finally said as they approached the gates. Tents and bonfires surrounded the area. \u00a0Laughs and music could be heard in the distance as the people of the realm enjoyed the end of the first day of the tourney. \u00a0\u201cI was such a beautiful song. \u00a0But it sounded so full of sorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. \u00a0I call it the song of Ice and Fire. \u00a0It\u2019s the first time I have performed it for anyone other than myself,\u201d he replied with a small grin.</p><p>\u201cWell Rhaegar,\u201d his name sounding like music to his ears coming from her lips, \u201cIt was simply beautiful. \u00a0As much as I hate to admit it, it moved me to tears. \u00a0Truly.\u201d</p><p>Rhaegar\u2019s free hand patted her looped arm softly, \u201cthank you Lyanna. \u00a0That means more than you may know. \u00a0He looked down at her once more, his indigo eyes meeting her smoky ones. \u00a0For a moment it felt like the world around Lyanna had stopped. \u00a0The feeling was unlike anything she had ever experienced causing her cheeks to flush. \u00a0But the moment was over as soon as it had begun. \u00a0Before either of them realized, they were standing before the entrance of her tent.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is me,\u201d she declared as she broke away from him. \u00a0\u201cThank you for the escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure was all mine Lyanna. \u00a0Mayhaps we shall stumble upon each other again,\u201d he suggested as he took her hand, placing a small kiss on it.</p><p>\u201cMayhaps we will.\u201d And with that, Lyanna retreated to her tent, leaving the prince alone outside.</p><p><a href=\"https://queen-hayley-mikaelson.tumblr.com/post/164992069155/a-union-of-ice-and-fire-chapter-one\" target=\"_blank\">Previous</a> || Next</p></p>",

His son was so beautiful that is brought tears to the she wolf&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Ly, are you crying,&rdquo; Benjen asked with a giggle. &nbsp;Irritated that she had been noticed and giggled at for her reaction, Lyanna shoved her younger brother aside as she rose from the table hurrying past him and exiting the hall.</p><p>She wiped her tears away as she followed the small stream that lead to the godswood in search of some peace and quiet to gather herself. &nbsp;As a place of worship for the Old Gods, the weirwood trees always brought Lyanna a sense of comfort and relaxation no matter what was happening. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t long before the stream lead her to the weirwood heart tree. &nbsp;Its face was not at all like the one in Winterfell. &nbsp;This one had a terribly twisted mouth with flaring eyes and several deep marks carved into its bark making it seem as if it was bleeding. &nbsp;But it was only the dark red sap from inside the tree.</p><p>Sitting quietly at the tree, Lyanna toyed with the lace at the end of his gown thinking of the sound the prince had played. &nbsp;It was a beautiful melody that she couldn&rsquo;t help to be moved by. She wondered if Robert would ever play such a beautiful tune but she knew better. &nbsp;Unfortunately the man was more skilled with a battle axe and not instruments. &nbsp;She sighed at the thought of her marriage arrangement. &nbsp;Despite her brother&rsquo;s belief that Robert truly loved her, she didn&rsquo;t felt that could ever be true. &nbsp;He barely knew her but claimed his undying love to be true. &nbsp;And based on what she knew of him over the years, she knew should could never truly love him. &nbsp;Her marriage was to come soon but the she wolf couldn&rsquo;t help contemplating a way out as unrealistic as the idea was.</p><p>A snap of a twig brought Lyanna back to reality. &nbsp;She looked over her shoulder in the direction of the castle to see a tall and long haired figure approaching her. &nbsp;She tried not to be alarmed, knowing she wasn&rsquo;t so far from the feast that a guard couldn&rsquo;t hear her scream. &nbsp;But her hand to hand combat training with her brothers over the years made her confident that she could defend herself in the meantime if necessary.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; she called out to the figure as she rose from the rock she was seated on. &nbsp;She looked down at her long silver dress noting it wasn&rsquo;t the bed thing to be wearing if she needed to defend herself but she knew she could make due if needed.</p><p>&ldquo;My lady, are you alright,&rdquo; she heard the male figure all back to her. &nbsp;His voice was not familiar to her but it didn&rsquo;t seem threatening either. As he slowly approached, the fully lit moon allowed her to better make out the gentleman&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;To her surprise, it was none other than the Prince of Dragonstone himself, Rhaegar Targaryen.</p><p>&ldquo;I am fine Your Grace,&rdquo; she answered as she dusted off her silver gown before curtseying before the prince who was now standing a few feet in front of her now.</p><p>&ldquo;No need for that my Lady-&rdquo; he paused waiting for her reply. &nbsp;He had learned her name earlier that day but preferred she make her own introduction.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyanna. &nbsp;Lyanna Stark,&rdquo; she responded with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyanna Stark,&rdquo; he repeated returning the smile. &nbsp;&ldquo;May I ask what you are doing out here all alone Lady Lyanna?&rdquo;</p><p>The Stark looked around for a moment for looking up at the bright full moon shining through the trees. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was just visiting the heart tree Your Grace. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s quite peaceful out here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, the tree of the Old Gods, yes,&rdquo; he asked knowingly as he took a step forward, now standing to the left of her. &nbsp;He examined the harsh faced tree noting the different slashes in the bark. &nbsp;&ldquo;You know these marks date back to 130 AC during the Dance of the Dragon,&rdquo; he commented as he reached out to touch the mangled bark. &nbsp;&ldquo;The battle between Daemon and Aemon Targaryen if my memory serves me right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I did not know that actually,&rdquo; she responded surprised. &nbsp;She hadn&rsquo;t considered what the crown prince would be like but she didn&rsquo;t expected him to be as casual as he was. &nbsp;She watched him carefully as he examined the tree before them, his indigo eyes seeming to shimmer in the moonlight. &nbsp;Worrying that the prince may feel her eyes on him, she turned her head back towards the tree hoping he didn&rsquo;t notice. &nbsp;&ldquo;I enjoy being in the godswood. &nbsp;I find them soothing,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;Though I haven&rsquo;t seen many outside of Winterfell other than the one in Riverrun. &nbsp;They always remind me of home and yes, the Old Gods.&rdquo;</p><p>The prince looked over at the northern lady and smiled. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can respect that. &nbsp;I like-&rdquo; &nbsp;he paused to think for a moment, &ldquo;a home away from home.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes exactly,&rdquo; she replied with a hint of a smile. &nbsp;Lyanna had never laid eyes on the prince before today but it was easy to see why the many ladies of Westeros seemed to swoon over the silver haired prince. She could easily find herself lost in his violet Valyrian eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;May I walk you back to your tent Lady Stark? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure a woman of the North can handle her own but I would never forgive myself if something were to happen.&rdquo; &nbsp;Rhaegar held out his arm, offering it to her. &nbsp;She looked down before looking back up at him linking her own through his.</p><p>&ldquo;You may call me Lyanna, Your Grace. &nbsp;If it please you.&rdquo; &nbsp;The pair walked arm and arm, exiting the godwood and heading toward the castle. &nbsp;She couldn&rsquo;t help but feel butterflies in her stomach the moment her arm touched his but she simply wrote it off as nervousness from being in the presence of the prince of the realm.</p><p>&ldquo;The please, call me Rhaegar.&rdquo; &nbsp;The casualness of his voice seemed to calm her flutters as they walked.</p><p>&ldquo;You play beautifully by the way,&rdquo; she finally said as they approached the gates. Tents and bonfires surrounded the area. &nbsp;Laughs and music could be heard in the distance as the people of the realm enjoyed the end of the first day of the tourney. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was such a beautiful song. &nbsp;But it sounded so full of sorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. &nbsp;I call it the song of Ice and Fire. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the first time I have performed it for anyone other than myself,&rdquo; he replied with a small grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Well Rhaegar,&rdquo; his name sounding like music to his ears coming from her lips, &ldquo;It was simply beautiful. &nbsp;As much as I hate to admit it, it moved me to tears. &nbsp;Truly.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhaegar&rsquo;s free hand patted her looped arm softly, &ldquo;thank you Lyanna. &nbsp;That means more than you may know. &nbsp;He looked down at her once more, his indigo eyes meeting her smoky ones. &nbsp;For a moment it felt like the world around Lyanna had stopped. &nbsp;The feeling was unlike anything she had ever experienced causing her cheeks to flush. &nbsp;But the moment was over as soon as it had begun. &nbsp;Before either of them realized, they were standing before the entrance of her tent.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, this is me,&rdquo; she declared as she broke away from him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you for the escort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The pleasure was all mine Lyanna. &nbsp;Mayhaps we shall stumble upon each other again,&rdquo; he suggested as he took her hand, placing a small kiss on it.</p><p>&ldquo;Mayhaps we will.&rdquo; And with that, Lyanna retreated to her tent, leaving the prince alone outside.</p><p><a href=\"https://queen-hayley-mikaelson.tumblr.com/post/164992069155/a-union-of-ice-and-fire-chapter-one\" target=\"_blank\">Previous</a> || Next</p></p>",
