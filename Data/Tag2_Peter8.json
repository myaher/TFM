The ones holding the key to finding your perfect match.</p><p>You can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s a part of this that isn\u2019t entirely true. How can someone have a perfect match? How can your perfect match be someone you\u2019ve never met?</p><p>\u201c-that your tattoo isn\u2019t the first thing your soulmate says to you,\u201d Liz is shaking her head and your eyes snap to hers, trying to focus your mind on the subject at hand but she isn\u2019t looking at you. You push around your milk carton, eyes finding a white spot on your perfectly blue lunch tray. \u201cShe said it\u2019s the first thing your soulmate says when you\u2019re ready to find them.\u201d</p><p>Her voice holds an excitement on the subject you couldn\u2019t fake if you tried, but your eyebrows pinch at the words. The topic of soulmates isn\u2019t exactly rare in your group of friends, but this theory is one that you\u2019ve never heard and you can\u2019t help it when you intervene. </p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be right.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>Suddenly every pair of eyes at your table lands on you, and you find yourself wishing you\u2019d said nothing at all. <br/></p><p>Your gaze finds Nora\u2019s, who\u2019s sitting in front of you with a curious smile. She tucks a lock of blonde hair behind her ear before crossing her arms over the table. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a tiny red line marking the inside skin of her elbow, the only proof that she had a tattoo to begin with. It\u2019s rare for a teenager to find their soulmate, but she was over the moon once she got over the initial pain and shock of finding them so soon.</p><p>You were happy for her, <i>of course</i>, but something about soulmates made your skin crawl. The sheer powerlessness of it all. </p><p>\u201cIt just seems weird,\u201d you shake your head. \u201cHow can you <i>be ready</i>? How do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask way too many questions,\u201d Liam buds in from beside Nora. There\u2019s a crooked smile resting against his lips, suggesting the words a mere joke but you can feel the irritation beginning to course through your veins. </p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t ask enough,\u201d you say. He shrugs and takes a long swig of his coke. </p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d he laughs around the can of sticky sugar. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an automatic thing,\u201d Nora explains, something happy dancing in her green eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all predetermined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPredetermined by <i>who</i>?\u201d you ask, swiping your plastic fork from your plate and nibbling on the ends of it. The plastic bends easily beneath your teeth. \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird that you\u2019re just supposed meet some random person who says the words you\u2019ve been assigned and <i>bam</i>, you\u2019re practically married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you know that\u2019s not how it works,\u201d Nora says, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s an exaggeration,\u201d you admit, throwing down your plastic tupperware again. \u201cBut now, <i>apparently,</i> I might already know them? Am I the only one who thinks that\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Liam shakes his head, a crooked smile on his face, and shoves a burnt french fry in his mouth. His expression twists into one of disgust a second later, but he swallows it down nonetheless. \u201cYeah, you are.\u201d</p><p>Liz leans closer to you and nudges your arm softly. \u201cWhy is this so important to you?\u201d she asks. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you say honestly. Nora furrows her brows and though it seems as if Liam is preoccupied with the manufactured food on his tray, you know his ears are trained on your words. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be able to <i>choose</i> who you fall in love with?\u201d</p><p>You watch their faces with a sudden desperation you didn\u2019t know you possessed. Desperation to be heard, desperation to be <i>understood</i>. The crease between Nora\u2019s brows deepens as she takes in your inquiry, Liam shakes his head and Liz just stares at you, as if you started spewing sentences in Dothraki. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she finally says. Her head tilts to the side, causing her midnight curls to fall over her shoulders in an ocean of black. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>You suck on your teeth and push your greens around your tray with a plastic fork. \u201cJust forget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see it\u2019s better this way,\u201d Nora says, her voice soft as if she\u2019s trying not to spook you. \u201cWhen you meet your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>You know she\u2019s only trying to reassure you of your doubts, but her words stir something strange in your chest. You feel like you\u2019re being brainwashed. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you breathe out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s exciting,\u201d Liz exclaims, clasping her hands together atop the table. \u201cWhat if your soulmate is here <i>right now</i>?\u2019</p><p>Her eyes shimmer with something hopeful, you can\u2019t help but store away your own reservations, at least for the time being. </p><p>\u201cKnowing you, you have at least thirty options as to who it could be,\u201d Liam says with a smirk, once again an active participant of the conversation. </p><p>\u201cMaybe Alex Smith?\u201d she wonders, resting her chin on her palm. You snort, turning away when she shoots you a questioning glance. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing,\u201d you shake your head, worrying your bottom lip between your teeth. </p><p>\u201cAlex Smith wears the same shirt, like, four out of five school days,\u201d Liam reaches over Nora\u2019s arms to snatch up her untouched bowl of fruit. She barely puts up a fight, knowing full well she\u2019ll only pick at it until the bell rings, but doesn\u2019t hesitate to clip him over his ear. </p><p>\u201cYou know you could <i>ask</i>,\u201d she jokes, while Liz starts to sputter with protests. </p><p>\u201cThat is <i>so</i> not true,\u201d she says, eyes already searching the crowded cafeteria to fact check her friend\u2019s accusation. Her face falls when she does but she quickly recovers, flashing Liam a sarcastic smile and flicking a lock of hair behind her shoulder. \u201cOkay well what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you or for me?\u201d he cards a hand through his dark hair, quirking an eyebrow when she shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met yours yet,\u201d he supplies.</p><p>Liz\u2019s face morphs into an adorable pout before switching to a smirk just as easily.\u00a0\u201cWhat if one of your exes is your soulmate?\u201d</p><p>He scoffs, eyes rolling upward and you share a knowing glance with Nora.\u00a0</p><p>Although most seem to wait for their soulmate to start dating, it\u2019s not uncommon for romantic relationships to develop outside of the chosen, and Liam is no stranger to that way of living.\u00a0</p><p>It seems he has a new significant other every week, and you can\u2019t help but feel sorry for the poor hearts he often breaks. Then again, he can\u2019t be bothered to change and the boys and girls who are victim to his fleeting love seem to come out okay on the other side.</p><p>He shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s never gonna happen,\u201d he says, and then \u201cI hope<i> mine </i>is Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>Your spine snaps into a rigid straight line and you reel back at the words like you\u2019ve been slapped. Nora and Liz begin to laugh. </p><p>\u201c<i>Peter Parker</i>?\u201d you question. \u201cWhy on<i> earth-</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d Liam laughs. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got a six pack you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that totally makes up for being an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got one of those too,\u201d He shrugs with a smile when you screw up your face, then shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m messing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank go-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s yours.\u201d </p><p>Nora laughs vehemently, throwing her head back and slapping the table with an open palm. Liz has the decency to try and hide her laughter between her fingers, but her giggles still slip through her skin and seep into your own. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d you deadpan, unable to supress the curse from your lips and suddenly Liam is joining in on the snickers. You think you might explode. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be something,\u201d Nora licks her lips, trying to regain her composure. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019d jump off of a cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be so dramatic,\u201d Liz pokes your cheek, just two short jabs, but your skin stings at her touch. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m known for,\u201d you say, rising from the rickety bench you\u2019ve been uncomfortably perched on for twenty minutes. Liam and Nora watch you stand languidly, but Liz pushes herself up from the seat a moment later. </p><p>\u201cBathroom?\u201d she asks and you nod, slinging your bag over your shoulder. </p><p>It\u2019s a stringy grey thing given to you by your dad when you started middle school and despite the pleas of your friends to invest in a new one, and the fact that one Peter Parker teases you about it any chance he gets, you find comfort in the packet. Especially when your dad is away on work trips, which you find that he<i> is </i>more often than not. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you step away from the stained lunch table, offering Nora and Liam a two fingered salute before Liz grabs your hand and pulls you from the cafeteria, but not before dragging you past Peter\u2019s lunch table. </p><p>You stumble behind your friend, senselessly letting your eyes skitter over his figure- slouched over, smiling brightly at something his friends are saying- but his gaze meets your when you don\u2019t turn away quick enough, and the fragile piece of Peter Parker that you\u2019ve never known shatters before your eyes. </p><p>He glares at you, blankly somehow and the indifference harborded in your gut burns into a raging fury. </p><p>When you finally fall through the cafeteria doors, leading to a near empty hallway, you whirl around to face a simpering Liz.</p><p>\u201cWe could have used the other doors,\u201d you say, arching a brow. \u201cYou know, the ones that were closer to our table and <i>not</i> in the direction of Parker\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She bats her eyelashes to feign innocence, but her shit-eating grin and the glimmer in her eyes betray her too quickly. \u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d</p><p>You groan, setting course for the bathroom again. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like watching the sexual tension between the two of you,\u201d she shrugs and you stick out your tongue in disgust. \u201cOh my god, imagine if the two of you were, like, <i>actually</i> soulmates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not supposed to despise your soulmate, Lizzy,\u201d you roll your eyes, watching a few of your peers mull around the halls. A few of them smile as you pass, and you return the gesture before focusing on the girl next to you again. She tucks a dark lock of hair behind her ear, the straightened piece losing its heat and starting to frizz again on the end. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says, cocking her head. \u201cThe odds are like, one-in-a-zillion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a real number, how\u2019d you get into this school again?\u201d </p><p><br/>She twists her face, her nose wrinkling at the words as she pushes open the grey bathroom door. It squeaks on its hinges, the sound echoing across tiled walls. </p><p>Liz walks in a straight line towards the dirty mirrors, running her delicate fingers through her hair while you walk into one of the empty, and <i>horribly</i> smelly, stalls. </p><p>When you step out again, Liz is still admiring her reflection, this time reapplying her lip balm and you can\u2019t help the smile that eases onto your face. Even in the dingy bathroom mirrors she\u2019s gorgeous, and she holds herself with a confidence you can only hope to one day possess. </p><p>She grins when she catches sight of you in the mirror, a pearly white smile lined with full lips. </p><p>You step forward, running your hands underneath the faucet and shaking your skin dry before nodding your head to the door again. Liz taps the back of your bag. </p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d she asks. </p><p>You nod, sliding forwards on the damp tiled floor- no doubt from students opting to shake the drops of water from their hands rather than dry them on the less than sanitary towels, like you- and shove open the door again. </p><p>The hall is still halfway empty, and a quick glance at the clock on a far wall tells you that there are twenty minutes left until your lunch break ends.</p><p>You make a beeline for the cafeteria, and Liz trails behind you for a moment before her long legs are catching up to yours in easy strides. </p><p>Neither of you speaks for a moment, and you let your hand travel to your mark as you walk. It doesn\u2019t take Liz long to catch on to the movement and she swipes up your hand as you let it fall, one of her perfectly manicured eyebrows arched. </p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve been messing with your tattoo <i>all</i> day. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>She tries to turn you away from her, no doubt to inspect it, but you step out of her reach and pull away from her touch. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please,\u201d she rolls her eyes and takes a step forward just as easily as you took one back. Her dark eyes glimmer with curiosity, and you decide that she\u2019ll never stop pressing if you don\u2019t just tell her now. \u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head, clenching your fist to keep yourself from reaching upwards again. \u201cIt just itches a little, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she\u2019s staring at you like she doesn\u2019t believe you, and you can\u2019t exactly say that you blame her between your wincing and the redness of the skin around your mark. But she doesn\u2019t need to know the extent of it, telling her the problem and<i> detailing </i>it are two very different things. \u201cProbably just a mosquito bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like one,\u201d she sing-songs, but starts her trek through the school halls again.</p><p><i>That was close,</i> you think to yourself. </p><p>You\u2019re not sure why you\u2019re lying to her. Maybe it\u2019s your own concern taking the wheel, or the fact that you know she\u2019ll make a bigger deal of it than it should be, but it\u2019s too late to turn back now. </p><p>She\u2019s a few steps ahead of you when a new thought pops into your head, this one more urgent. </p><p>\u201cOh wait,\u201d your steps halt suddenly, and Liz shoots farther ahead before she turns her head and stops. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks, wearing a quizzical expression. </p><p>\u201cI need to grab some books out of my locker,\u201d you nod in the opposite direction, back down the way you came. \u201cI\u2019ll meet up with you in a second.\u201d</p><p>She dips her head, a nod yes, before pushing through the cafeteria doors and leaving you to yourself. You start your trek towards your locker, nothing on your mind but seemingly useless things- the weather, your friends, your soulmark. </p><p>Your hand travels to the bumpy tattoo on your neck once more, as if called there and in the privacy of the empty halls you let your fingers roam the irritated skin. You know what it says, you\u2019ve known since it appeared, but what it<i> means</i>\u2026 what elicits it is what confuses you, intrigues you and<i> pisses</i> you off. </p><p>You turn the corner, still lost in thought, but when you finally notice Peter Parker leaning against your locker, a smile pressed on his lips, your arm falls in surprise. </p><p>He isn\u2019t looking at you; he probably doesn\u2019t even know that yours is the locker he\u2019s decided to block, but it <i>is</i>, leaving you in an uncomfortable situation that will surely end in a verbal brawl.</p><p>Ned is standing in front of him, animatedly telling a story that you know you\u2019ll never hear\u2014 <i>not</i> that you\u2019d want to\u2014 and you steel yourself at the sight of them before marching over to the pair, your shoulders set back in determination. </p><p>As if sensing your presence, Peter\u2019s eyes dart from Ned\u2019s face to yours. Just like every time he sees you, the smile that he was wearing vanishes from his lips. You think that in another world, it would hurt that you\u2019re able to bring such displeasure to someone just by being in their line of sight, but with him it twists something like satisfaction in your gut.</p><p>Ned picks up on his sudden change of demeanor, but unlike Peter, when his eyes meet yours his face splits into an even bigger grin. </p><p>You\u2019ve always liked Ned. He was always kind to you, even when Peter was cruel.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he calls, and a smile pulls at your lips. </p><p>\u201cHey, Ned.\u201d</p><p>Peter crosses his arms as you approach, head tilting upwards. You wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the motion is only so that he can say that he\u2019s <i>literally </i>looking down on you. You try not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just who I was looking for,\u201d Ned says, pulling your attention to him once more. You slow your pace, cocking your head in confusion. </p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d you question, trying to block Peter in your peripheral, trying to block the stupid smirk that\u2019s now replaced his frown. </p><p>\u201cLiam said you needed the notes that we got in History?\u201d your eyes flit to the notebook that Ned\u2019s grasping in a hand, and to the letters adorning it. The words he\u2019s written in a playful scrawl are highlighted with a spectrum of colors.</p><p>\u201c<i>Right,</i>\u201d you tuck a lock of hair behind your ear and roll your eyes. \u201cOf course he couldn\u2019t be bothered to do it himself. Sorry, Ned.\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a scoff at that, small and easy to miss, but you turn to him anyways. </p><p>\u201cIf you have something to say,\u201d you press the heels of your hands into your hips. \u201cThen say it.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, eyeing you up and down. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>Your stomach twists with irritation and you try not to fume as Ned takes a step forward, his smile pinched. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, Y/N,\u201d he says, tearing the papers from his book and handing them to you gently. </p><p>You turn away from Peter, letting the anger ease from your face when your eyes focus on Ned once more. \u201cI owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re square,\u201d he steps back again, cocking his head. \u201cLast year, Physics?\u201d</p><p>Your mind shoots back to the year prior, when both Ned and Peter were out sick and you took notes for the former unbeknownst that they would be passed on to the ladder afterwards. But you\u2019re square. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you nod. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>You take a new step forward, almost directly in front of Peter but all he does is stare at you, a single eyebrow arched. You tense your jaw. </p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d to anybody who doesn\u2019t know him, his voice would sound sincere and concerned, but you\u2019ve learned to uncover the underlying sarcasm and bite of irritation that accompany the words. </p><p>You cross your arms, letting your eyes dart across his face. \u201cYou\u2019re leaning against my locker.\u201d </p><p>He grins, sarcastic and so obviously an attempt to rile you up that you can\u2019t give him the satisfaction of knowing that it really <i>does.</i> \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, sounding anything but sincere. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d He doesn\u2019t make any attempt to move, and you can see Ned fidgeting nervously next to you at his friends defiance. \u201cI\u2019d,\u201d you breathe, clenching your teeth so hard you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll shatter. \u201c<i>Appreciate</i> it if you would get out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Still, he doesn\u2019t budge, but a new condescending smile pulls at his lips and he hums. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>The expression he wears takes you back to when you were young and in elementary school. He used to stand behind you when you walked in straight lines around the school and he\u2019d always pull at the end of your ponytail. Any time you\u2019d turn to glare at him, to yell at him to stop he\u2019d wear this same expression. Even years later it makes you want to break his jaw. </p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d your voice is set in a deadpan when the words leave your lips and your face is wiped of any emotion, but you\u2019re quite sure you\u2019ve never spoken a heavier truth. </p><p>He laughs at that, a silly and boyish thing but there\u2019s an underlying harshness that tangles into the sound. \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>Ned steps forward as Peter talks, and grabs his arm tightly. \u201cCome on, man,\u201d he pleads. </p><p>Peter glances at Ned and the cocky expression laid out on his face flickers for a moment, then he turns to you again, his face wiped completely. You cross your arms and wait.</p><p>It takes him a few seconds to heed Ned\u2019s request, but when he does you don\u2019t hesitate to occupy the spot where he stood and shove open your locker door. </p><p>Your fingers grapple for your textbooks, but when you turn around after cramming them into your bag, Peter is still standing behind you, something mischievous in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anyone else to piss off?\u201d you ask, slinging your backpack over your shoulder again and closing your locker door. Peter cocks his head. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m literally just standing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour presence is more than enough,\u201d you shift in place and suck on your teeth. A soft pressure begins to set on the back of your neck, but you write it off as nothing. It has to be. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, and a dark lock of hair falls away from its peers and curls over his forehead. If you didn\u2019t hate him so much you\u2019d think it might be beautiful. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a new bag?\u201d he asks. There\u2019s honest curiosity in his voice, and he looks like a child asking why the sky is blue, but the question stirs something deep inside of you. </p><p>Maybe you\u2019re too protective over it, maybe the anger boiling in your gut is irrational and reckless but you can\u2019t help it when the feeling transforms into words spilling over your lips. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a new personality?\u201d</p><p>He purses his lips and releases the air lodged in his lungs, but his eyes hold his humor. It does nothing but anger you more. </p><p>Your skin itches and the hair on the back of your neck rises, and the pressure is on your tattoo, you realize. </p><p>\u201cYou thought hard on that one didn\u2019t you?\u201d he says, shoving his hands in his pockets. His tone has changed from curious to halfway cruel. </p><p>Ned takes a step back now, his eyebrows still bumped together. For a moment you forgot he was even there to begin with, and though it does nothing to change the situation, you feel almost disappointed with his choice to stay out of the argument. </p><p>\u201cCan you just leave me alone?\u201d you bark, turning your gaze back to Peter. \u201cJust <i>once</i>, mind your own buisness and fuck off?\u201d</p><p>With every passing second the pressure on your soulmark grows more and more until you\u2019re afraid it might burst, but you blame it on your anger rather than anything else. You blame it on the adrenaline coursing through your veins. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk!\u201d he yells, brandishing his hands in anger. You balk at his sudden change of tone. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOh, you wanna bet?\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Your body goes rigid the second the words leave his lips, and suddenly you feel as if you\u2019ve been dipped in liquid fire and thrown into an icy bath all at once. You\u2019re left blubbering in confusion and for a second you think you\u2019re going through early menopause-<i> very early</i> menopause- that it\u2019s merely a coincidence that his question is the same one that\u2019s printed on your skin; but then a searing pain shoots up your spine.</p><p>\u201c<i>Wait</i>,\u201d you gasp, right before your legs give out underneath you.</p><p>Peter\u2019s arms are outstretched and he darts forwards to keep you from hitting the ground, but you yank your arm away before he can touch it, and your knees hit the tiled ground a moment later. </p><p>There\u2019s no doubt in your mind that they\u2019ll be colored with bruises in time, but that\u2019s almost the least of your concerns. </p><p>You cup the back of your neck, as if you can shield it from the pain, but it only burns hotter. Tears gather in the corners of your eyes and Peter\u2019s face begins to blur into an unrecognizable blob. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t touch you, like he\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll crumble at the first brush of his fingers, but he does inch closer, hands hovering halfway through the air. </p><p>And then, as suddenly as it happened to you, he gasps and his face drains of color.</p><p>Maybe the same thing is happening to him, but what on earth <i>is it</i>?</p><p>He grapples for his ribs, keeling forward and bracing his hand on the tile next to yours. There\u2019s sweat collecting on his brow and he\u2019s close enough that you can make out every detail of his face as you blink away your tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks, panic lacing his gaze. You almost find it in yourself to roll your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>know,</i>\u201d you snap, squeezing your eyes shut to try and brave the sting, but it\u2019s fading just as fast as it arrived.</p><p>The sound of Ned\u2019s shuffling feet fills your ears, next to his mumbling and that of someone else. When you look up again, peeling your eyes open, you see Michelle Jones with a rare startled look on her face mirroring Ned\u2019s surprise.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you hear her mumble, and then Peter\u2019s sitting up and blocking her from view. </p><p>His face has regained its color, now a bright red and his brows are bumped together in a mix of confusion and concern. You stand up at the same time, but when you stumble and he doesn\u2019t, he grabs your forearms to steady you. </p><p>His skin presses against yours, hard and soft and suddenly you find that you\u2019re feeling better, you feel like nothing ever happened at all, so you pull away from him and throw up a shield. </p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d his voice is low and timid. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p><i>Like you care</i>, you want to say. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you say instead, trying to ignore the way your stomach drops at the complete lack of <i>him</i>. Of his skin against yours, because you\u2019re not supposed to feel that at all. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he scratches the back of his neck, but his eyes are foggy and it almost seems like he\u2019s looking<i> through</i> you rather than at you. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>A cough sounds behind him, and when you glance over your shoulder you see his friends, \u00a0fidgeting nervously. Ned\u2019s face is twisted into pity and concern, but MJ is smirking devilishly. </p><p>\u201cUh, guys,\u201d Ned stutters weakly, scratching the back of his neck. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Peter asks, his hand drifting to his ribs again, you wonder if that\u2019s where his tattoo hides. And then you find yourself wondering why he would be reaching for it at all. </p><p>MJ huffs out a laugh, then smothers it with her palm and shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna like it,\u201d she says. </p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d you press. Your hand begins to drift upwards automatically, searching for the bumpy mark on your neck, but when your fingers brush over the surface you find nothing but smooth skin. Your blood runs cold. </p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Ned swallows, visibly hesitant and MJ nudges his shoulder, prompting him to continue. \u201cI think you guys are soulmates.\u201d he finally says.

How can your perfect match be someone you\u2019ve never met?</p><p>\u201c-that your tattoo isn\u2019t the first thing your soulmate says to you,\u201d Liz is shaking her head and your eyes snap to hers, trying to focus your mind on the subject at hand but she isn\u2019t looking at you. You push around your milk carton, eyes finding a white spot on your perfectly blue lunch tray. \u201cShe said it\u2019s the first thing your soulmate says when you\u2019re ready to find them.\u201d</p><p>Her voice holds an excitement on the subject you couldn\u2019t fake if you tried, but your eyebrows pinch at the words. The topic of soulmates isn\u2019t exactly rare in your group of friends, but this theory is one that you\u2019ve never heard and you can\u2019t help it when you intervene. </p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be right.\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>Suddenly every pair of eyes at your table lands on you, and you find yourself wishing you\u2019d said nothing at all. <br></p><p>Your gaze finds Nora\u2019s, who\u2019s sitting in front of you with a curious smile. She tucks a lock of blonde hair behind her ear before crossing her arms over the table. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a tiny red line marking the inside skin of her elbow, the only proof that she had a tattoo to begin with. It\u2019s rare for a teenager to find their soulmate, but she was over the moon once she got over the initial pain and shock of finding them so soon.</p><p>You were happy for her, <i>of course</i>, but something about soulmates made your skin crawl. The sheer powerlessness of it all. </p><p>\u201cIt just seems weird,\u201d you shake your head. \u201cHow can you <i>be ready</i>? How do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask way too many questions,\u201d Liam buds in from beside Nora. There\u2019s a crooked smile resting against his lips, suggesting the words a mere joke but you can feel the irritation beginning to course through your veins. </p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t ask enough,\u201d you say. He shrugs and takes a long swig of his coke. </p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d he laughs around the can of sticky sugar. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an automatic thing,\u201d Nora explains, something happy dancing in her green eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all predetermined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPredetermined by <i>who</i>?\u201d you ask, swiping your plastic fork from your plate and nibbling on the ends of it. The plastic bends easily beneath your teeth. \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird that you\u2019re just supposed meet some random person who says the words you\u2019ve been assigned and <i>bam</i>, you\u2019re practically married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you know that\u2019s not how it works,\u201d Nora says, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s an exaggeration,\u201d you admit, throwing down your plastic tupperware again. \u201cBut now, <i>apparently,</i> I might already know them? Am I the only one who thinks that\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Liam shakes his head, a crooked smile on his face, and shoves a burnt french fry in his mouth. His expression twists into one of disgust a second later, but he swallows it down nonetheless. \u201cYeah, you are.\u201d</p><p>Liz leans closer to you and nudges your arm softly. \u201cWhy is this so important to you?\u201d she asks. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you say honestly. Nora furrows her brows and though it seems as if Liam is preoccupied with the manufactured food on his tray, you know his ears are trained on your words. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be able to <i>choose</i> who you fall in love with?\u201d</p><p>You watch their faces with a sudden desperation you didn\u2019t know you possessed. Desperation to be heard, desperation to be <i>understood</i>. The crease between Nora\u2019s brows deepens as she takes in your inquiry, Liam shakes his head and Liz just stares at you, as if you started spewing sentences in Dothraki. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she finally says. Her head tilts to the side, causing her midnight curls to fall over her shoulders in an ocean of black. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>You suck on your teeth and push your greens around your tray with a plastic fork. \u201cJust forget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see it\u2019s better this way,\u201d Nora says, her voice soft as if she\u2019s trying not to spook you. \u201cWhen you meet your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>You know she\u2019s only trying to reassure you of your doubts, but her words stir something strange in your chest. You feel like you\u2019re being brainwashed. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you breathe out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s exciting,\u201d Liz exclaims, clasping her hands together atop the table. \u201cWhat if your soulmate is here <i>right now</i>?\u2019</p><p>Her eyes shimmer with something hopeful, you can\u2019t help but store away your own reservations, at least for the time being. </p><p>\u201cKnowing you, you have at least thirty options as to who it could be,\u201d Liam says with a smirk, once again an active participant of the conversation. </p><p>\u201cMaybe Alex Smith?\u201d she wonders, resting her chin on her palm. You snort, turning away when she shoots you a questioning glance. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing,\u201d you shake your head, worrying your bottom lip between your teeth. </p><p>\u201cAlex Smith wears the same shirt, like, four out of five school days,\u201d Liam reaches over Nora\u2019s arms to snatch up her untouched bowl of fruit. She barely puts up a fight, knowing full well she\u2019ll only pick at it until the bell rings, but doesn\u2019t hesitate to clip him over his ear. </p><p>\u201cYou know you could <i>ask</i>,\u201d she jokes, while Liz starts to sputter with protests. </p><p>\u201cThat is <i>so</i> not true,\u201d she says, eyes already searching the crowded cafeteria to fact check her friend\u2019s accusation. Her face falls when she does but she quickly recovers, flashing Liam a sarcastic smile and flicking a lock of hair behind her shoulder. \u201cOkay well what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you or for me?\u201d he cards a hand through his dark hair, quirking an eyebrow when she shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met yours yet,\u201d he supplies.</p><p>Liz\u2019s face morphs into an adorable pout before switching to a smirk just as easily.\u00a0\u201cWhat if one of your exes is your soulmate?\u201d</p><p>He scoffs, eyes rolling upward and you share a knowing glance with Nora.\u00a0</p><p>Although most seem to wait for their soulmate to start dating, it\u2019s not uncommon for romantic relationships to develop outside of the chosen, and Liam is no stranger to that way of living.\u00a0</p><p>It seems he has a new significant other every week, and you can\u2019t help but feel sorry for the poor hearts he often breaks. Then again, he can\u2019t be bothered to change and the boys and girls who are victim to his fleeting love seem to come out okay on the other side.</p><p>He shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s never gonna happen,\u201d he says, and then \u201cI hope<i> mine </i>is Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>Your spine snaps into a rigid straight line and you reel back at the words like you\u2019ve been slapped. Nora and Liz begin to laugh. </p><p>\u201c<i>Peter Parker</i>?\u201d you question. \u201cWhy on<i> earth-</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d Liam laughs. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got a six pack you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that totally makes up for being an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got one of those too,\u201d He shrugs with a smile when you screw up your face, then shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m messing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank go-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s yours.\u201d </p><p>Nora laughs vehemently, throwing her head back and slapping the table with an open palm. Liz has the decency to try and hide her laughter between her fingers, but her giggles still slip through her skin and seep into your own. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d you deadpan, unable to supress the curse from your lips and suddenly Liam is joining in on the snickers. You think you might explode. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be something,\u201d Nora licks her lips, trying to regain her composure. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019d jump off of a cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be so dramatic,\u201d Liz pokes your cheek, just two short jabs, but your skin stings at her touch. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m known for,\u201d you say, rising from the rickety bench you\u2019ve been uncomfortably perched on for twenty minutes. Liam and Nora watch you stand languidly, but Liz pushes herself up from the seat a moment later. </p><p>\u201cBathroom?\u201d she asks and you nod, slinging your bag over your shoulder. </p><p>It\u2019s a stringy grey thing given to you by your dad when you started middle school and despite the pleas of your friends to invest in a new one, and the fact that one Peter Parker teases you about it any chance he gets, you find comfort in the packet. Especially when your dad is away on work trips, which you find that he<i> is </i>more often than not. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you step away from the stained lunch table, offering Nora and Liam a two fingered salute before Liz grabs your hand and pulls you from the cafeteria, but not before dragging you past Peter\u2019s lunch table. </p><p>You stumble behind your friend, senselessly letting your eyes skitter over his figure- slouched over, smiling brightly at something his friends are saying- but his gaze meets your when you don\u2019t turn away quick enough, and the fragile piece of Peter Parker that you\u2019ve never known shatters before your eyes. </p><p>He glares at you, blankly somehow and the indifference harborded in your gut burns into a raging fury. </p><p>When you finally fall through the cafeteria doors, leading to a near empty hallway, you whirl around to face a simpering Liz.</p><p>\u201cWe could have used the other doors,\u201d you say, arching a brow. \u201cYou know, the ones that were closer to our table and <i>not</i> in the direction of Parker\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She bats her eyelashes to feign innocence, but her shit-eating grin and the glimmer in her eyes betray her too quickly. \u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d</p><p>You groan, setting course for the bathroom again. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like watching the sexual tension between the two of you,\u201d she shrugs and you stick out your tongue in disgust. \u201cOh my god, imagine if the two of you were, like, <i>actually</i> soulmates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not supposed to despise your soulmate, Lizzy,\u201d you roll your eyes, watching a few of your peers mull around the halls. A few of them smile as you pass, and you return the gesture before focusing on the girl next to you again. She tucks a dark lock of hair behind her ear, the straightened piece losing its heat and starting to frizz again on the end. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says, cocking her head. \u201cThe odds are like, one-in-a-zillion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a real number, how\u2019d you get into this school again?\u201d </p><p><br>She twists her face, her nose wrinkling at the words as she pushes open the grey bathroom door. It squeaks on its hinges, the sound echoing across tiled walls. </p><p>Liz walks in a straight line towards the dirty mirrors, running her delicate fingers through her hair while you walk into one of the empty, and <i>horribly</i> smelly, stalls. </p><p>When you step out again, Liz is still admiring her reflection, this time reapplying her lip balm and you can\u2019t help the smile that eases onto your face. Even in the dingy bathroom mirrors she\u2019s gorgeous, and she holds herself with a confidence you can only hope to one day possess. </p><p>She grins when she catches sight of you in the mirror, a pearly white smile lined with full lips. </p><p>You step forward, running your hands underneath the faucet and shaking your skin dry before nodding your head to the door again. Liz taps the back of your bag. </p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d she asks. </p><p>You nod, sliding forwards on the damp tiled floor- no doubt from students opting to shake the drops of water from their hands rather than dry them on the less than sanitary towels, like you- and shove open the door again. </p><p>The hall is still halfway empty, and a quick glance at the clock on a far wall tells you that there are twenty minutes left until your lunch break ends.</p><p>You make a beeline for the cafeteria, and Liz trails behind you for a moment before her long legs are catching up to yours in easy strides. </p><p>Neither of you speaks for a moment, and you let your hand travel to your mark as you walk. It doesn\u2019t take Liz long to catch on to the movement and she swipes up your hand as you let it fall, one of her perfectly manicured eyebrows arched. </p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve been messing with your tattoo <i>all</i> day. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>She tries to turn you away from her, no doubt to inspect it, but you step out of her reach and pull away from her touch. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please,\u201d she rolls her eyes and takes a step forward just as easily as you took one back. Her dark eyes glimmer with curiosity, and you decide that she\u2019ll never stop pressing if you don\u2019t just tell her now. \u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head, clenching your fist to keep yourself from reaching upwards again. \u201cIt just itches a little, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she\u2019s staring at you like she doesn\u2019t believe you, and you can\u2019t exactly say that you blame her between your wincing and the redness of the skin around your mark. But she doesn\u2019t need to know the extent of it, telling her the problem and<i> detailing </i>it are two very different things. \u201cProbably just a mosquito bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like one,\u201d she sing-songs, but starts her trek through the school halls again.</p><p><i>That was close,</i> you think to yourself. </p><p>You\u2019re not sure why you\u2019re lying to her. Maybe it\u2019s your own concern taking the wheel, or the fact that you know she\u2019ll make a bigger deal of it than it should be, but it\u2019s too late to turn back now. </p><p>She\u2019s a few steps ahead of you when a new thought pops into your head, this one more urgent. </p><p>\u201cOh wait,\u201d your steps halt suddenly, and Liz shoots farther ahead before she turns her head and stops. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks, wearing a quizzical expression. </p><p>\u201cI need to grab some books out of my locker,\u201d you nod in the opposite direction, back down the way you came. \u201cI\u2019ll meet up with you in a second.\u201d</p><p>She dips her head, a nod yes, before pushing through the cafeteria doors and leaving you to yourself. You start your trek towards your locker, nothing on your mind but seemingly useless things- the weather, your friends, your soulmark. </p><p>Your hand travels to the bumpy tattoo on your neck once more, as if called there and in the privacy of the empty halls you let your fingers roam the irritated skin. You know what it says, you\u2019ve known since it appeared, but what it<i> means</i>\u2026 what elicits it is what confuses you, intrigues you and<i> pisses</i> you off. </p><p>You turn the corner, still lost in thought, but when you finally notice Peter Parker leaning against your locker, a smile pressed on his lips, your arm falls in surprise. </p><p>He isn\u2019t looking at you; he probably doesn\u2019t even know that yours is the locker he\u2019s decided to block, but it <i>is</i>, leaving you in an uncomfortable situation that will surely end in a verbal brawl.</p><p>Ned is standing in front of him, animatedly telling a story that you know you\u2019ll never hear\u2014 <i>not</i> that you\u2019d want to\u2014 and you steel yourself at the sight of them before marching over to the pair, your shoulders set back in determination. </p><p>As if sensing your presence, Peter\u2019s eyes dart from Ned\u2019s face to yours. Just like every time he sees you, the smile that he was wearing vanishes from his lips. You think that in another world, it would hurt that you\u2019re able to bring such displeasure to someone just by being in their line of sight, but with him it twists something like satisfaction in your gut.</p><p>Ned picks up on his sudden change of demeanor, but unlike Peter, when his eyes meet yours his face splits into an even bigger grin. </p><p>You\u2019ve always liked Ned. He was always kind to you, even when Peter was cruel.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he calls, and a smile pulls at your lips. </p><p>\u201cHey, Ned.\u201d</p><p>Peter crosses his arms as you approach, head tilting upwards. You wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the motion is only so that he can say that he\u2019s <i>literally </i>looking down on you. You try not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just who I was looking for,\u201d Ned says, pulling your attention to him once more. You slow your pace, cocking your head in confusion. </p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d you question, trying to block Peter in your peripheral, trying to block the stupid smirk that\u2019s now replaced his frown. </p><p>\u201cLiam said you needed the notes that we got in History?\u201d your eyes flit to the notebook that Ned\u2019s grasping in a hand, and to the letters adorning it. The words he\u2019s written in a playful scrawl are highlighted with a spectrum of colors.</p><p>\u201c<i>Right,</i>\u201d you tuck a lock of hair behind your ear and roll your eyes. \u201cOf course he couldn\u2019t be bothered to do it himself. Sorry, Ned.\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a scoff at that, small and easy to miss, but you turn to him anyways. </p><p>\u201cIf you have something to say,\u201d you press the heels of your hands into your hips. \u201cThen say it.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, eyeing you up and down. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>Your stomach twists with irritation and you try not to fume as Ned takes a step forward, his smile pinched. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, Y/N,\u201d he says, tearing the papers from his book and handing them to you gently. </p><p>You turn away from Peter, letting the anger ease from your face when your eyes focus on Ned once more. \u201cI owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re square,\u201d he steps back again, cocking his head. \u201cLast year, Physics?\u201d</p><p>Your mind shoots back to the year prior, when both Ned and Peter were out sick and you took notes for the former unbeknownst that they would be passed on to the ladder afterwards. But you\u2019re square. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you nod. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>You take a new step forward, almost directly in front of Peter but all he does is stare at you, a single eyebrow arched. You tense your jaw. </p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d to anybody who doesn\u2019t know him, his voice would sound sincere and concerned, but you\u2019ve learned to uncover the underlying sarcasm and bite of irritation that accompany the words. </p><p>You cross your arms, letting your eyes dart across his face. \u201cYou\u2019re leaning against my locker.\u201d </p><p>He grins, sarcastic and so obviously an attempt to rile you up that you can\u2019t give him the satisfaction of knowing that it really <i>does.</i> \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, sounding anything but sincere. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d He doesn\u2019t make any attempt to move, and you can see Ned fidgeting nervously next to you at his friends defiance. \u201cI\u2019d,\u201d you breathe, clenching your teeth so hard you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll shatter. \u201c<i>Appreciate</i> it if you would get out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Still, he doesn\u2019t budge, but a new condescending smile pulls at his lips and he hums. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>The expression he wears takes you back to when you were young and in elementary school. He used to stand behind you when you walked in straight lines around the school and he\u2019d always pull at the end of your ponytail. Any time you\u2019d turn to glare at him, to yell at him to stop he\u2019d wear this same expression. Even years later it makes you want to break his jaw. </p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d your voice is set in a deadpan when the words leave your lips and your face is wiped of any emotion, but you\u2019re quite sure you\u2019ve never spoken a heavier truth. </p><p>He laughs at that, a silly and boyish thing but there\u2019s an underlying harshness that tangles into the sound. \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>Ned steps forward as Peter talks, and grabs his arm tightly. \u201cCome on, man,\u201d he pleads. </p><p>Peter glances at Ned and the cocky expression laid out on his face flickers for a moment, then he turns to you again, his face wiped completely. You cross your arms and wait.</p><p>It takes him a few seconds to heed Ned\u2019s request, but when he does you don\u2019t hesitate to occupy the spot where he stood and shove open your locker door. </p><p>Your fingers grapple for your textbooks, but when you turn around after cramming them into your bag, Peter is still standing behind you, something mischievous in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anyone else to piss off?\u201d you ask, slinging your backpack over your shoulder again and closing your locker door. Peter cocks his head. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m literally just standing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour presence is more than enough,\u201d you shift in place and suck on your teeth. A soft pressure begins to set on the back of your neck, but you write it off as nothing. It has to be. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, and a dark lock of hair falls away from its peers and curls over his forehead. If you didn\u2019t hate him so much you\u2019d think it might be beautiful. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a new bag?\u201d he asks. There\u2019s honest curiosity in his voice, and he looks like a child asking why the sky is blue, but the question stirs something deep inside of you. </p><p>Maybe you\u2019re too protective over it, maybe the anger boiling in your gut is irrational and reckless but you can\u2019t help it when the feeling transforms into words spilling over your lips. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a new personality?\u201d</p><p>He purses his lips and releases the air lodged in his lungs, but his eyes hold his humor. It does nothing but anger you more. </p><p>Your skin itches and the hair on the back of your neck rises, and the pressure is on your tattoo, you realize. </p><p>\u201cYou thought hard on that one didn\u2019t you?\u201d he says, shoving his hands in his pockets. His tone has changed from curious to halfway cruel. </p><p>Ned takes a step back now, his eyebrows still bumped together. For a moment you forgot he was even there to begin with, and though it does nothing to change the situation, you feel almost disappointed with his choice to stay out of the argument. </p><p>\u201cCan you just leave me alone?\u201d you bark, turning your gaze back to Peter. \u201cJust <i>once</i>, mind your own buisness and fuck off?\u201d</p><p>With every passing second the pressure on your soulmark grows more and more until you\u2019re afraid it might burst, but you blame it on your anger rather than anything else. You blame it on the adrenaline coursing through your veins. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk!\u201d he yells, brandishing his hands in anger. You balk at his sudden change of tone. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOh, you wanna bet?\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Your body goes rigid the second the words leave his lips, and suddenly you feel as if you\u2019ve been dipped in liquid fire and thrown into an icy bath all at once. You\u2019re left blubbering in confusion and for a second you think you\u2019re going through early menopause-<i> very early</i> menopause- that it\u2019s merely a coincidence that his question is the same one that\u2019s printed on your skin; but then a searing pain shoots up your spine.</p><p>\u201c<i>Wait</i>,\u201d you gasp, right before your legs give out underneath you.</p><p>Peter\u2019s arms are outstretched and he darts forwards to keep you from hitting the ground, but you yank your arm away before he can touch it, and your knees hit the tiled ground a moment later. </p><p>There\u2019s no doubt in your mind that they\u2019ll be colored with bruises in time, but that\u2019s almost the least of your concerns. </p><p>You cup the back of your neck, as if you can shield it from the pain, but it only burns hotter. Tears gather in the corners of your eyes and Peter\u2019s face begins to blur into an unrecognizable blob. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t touch you, like he\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll crumble at the first brush of his fingers, but he does inch closer, hands hovering halfway through the air. </p><p>And then, as suddenly as it happened to you, he gasps and his face drains of color.</p><p>Maybe the same thing is happening to him, but what on earth <i>is it</i>?</p><p>He grapples for his ribs, keeling forward and bracing his hand on the tile next to yours. There\u2019s sweat collecting on his brow and he\u2019s close enough that you can make out every detail of his face as you blink away your tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks, panic lacing his gaze. You almost find it in yourself to roll your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>know,</i>\u201d you snap, squeezing your eyes shut to try and brave the sting, but it\u2019s fading just as fast as it arrived.</p><p>The sound of Ned\u2019s shuffling feet fills your ears, next to his mumbling and that of someone else. When you look up again, peeling your eyes open, you see Michelle Jones with a rare startled look on her face mirroring Ned\u2019s surprise.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you hear her mumble, and then Peter\u2019s sitting up and blocking her from view. </p><p>His face has regained its color, now a bright red and his brows are bumped together in a mix of confusion and concern. You stand up at the same time, but when you stumble and he doesn\u2019t, he grabs your forearms to steady you. </p><p>His skin presses against yours, hard and soft and suddenly you find that you\u2019re feeling better, you feel like nothing ever happened at all, so you pull away from him and throw up a shield. </p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d his voice is low and timid. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p><i>Like you care</i>, you want to say. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you say instead, trying to ignore the way your stomach drops at the complete lack of <i>him</i>. Of his skin against yours, because you\u2019re not supposed to feel that at all. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he scratches the back of his neck, but his eyes are foggy and it almost seems like he\u2019s looking<i> through</i> you rather than at you. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>A cough sounds behind him, and when you glance over your shoulder you see his friends, \u00a0fidgeting nervously. Ned\u2019s face is twisted into pity and concern, but MJ is smirking devilishly. </p><p>\u201cUh, guys,\u201d Ned stutters weakly, scratching the back of his neck. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Peter asks, his hand drifting to his ribs again, you wonder if that\u2019s where his tattoo hides. And then you find yourself wondering why he would be reaching for it at all. </p><p>MJ huffs out a laugh, then smothers it with her palm and shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna like it,\u201d she says. </p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d you press. Your hand begins to drift upwards automatically, searching for the bumpy mark on your neck, but when your fingers brush over the surface you find nothing but smooth skin. Your blood runs cold. </p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Ned swallows, visibly hesitant and MJ nudges his shoulder, prompting him to continue. \u201cI think you guys are soulmates.\u201d he finally says. It sounds forced and meek and he winces after the words clear the air. You think you might faint. </p><p>You <i>don\u2019t.</i></p><p>You want to scream and yell and curse at the sky, but when you open your mouth no words aid you. So Peter yells instead. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i><b>Permanent Taglist:</b></i></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbIwCgwZCsLKX-9g8RncILA\">@signed-potato</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maWg3Y2rRoN4fJwBIHsAHpQ\">@awkwardnesshabitat</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXDwScBzojYIj4wWL9bs-lQ\">@spideyboipete</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjbIIN1EFUDHC-CU2k_g3sw\">@thelivvylovegood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@laureharrier</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ3r0EnrsVP4wrUmbjmBPEw\">@anxieteandbiscuits</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHzeUidPwl8Iq_VMWOIC4QA\">@ukulele-tea-and-ocean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh-yD4HHGZ0AYt4LzP_ZObg\">@lovely-</a>parker<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW_Ib2Bce52Migr7csRwWCg\">@veryspectacularspiderling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\">@sunshineandparker</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdr9j8nAQCXZH6kqXFVjyoQ\">@minnie-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF9vAkjL9o-1ksPHeivoD4A\">@imnotbitter-anna</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKuQ-_5GfUqjZej8sgK1wSQ\">@magic-marvel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moE_3Ph0oXCxZzl1_Y1Ct1g\">@quxntumvandyne</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mql_a-LCJHBFAYRe-UTCQmA\">@lokiisragnarok</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU7AxU4LDHKQ63LVRL9RITA\">@highlady-ofthe-summercourt</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKwwd_5Dai95XE8150lF9xQ\">@secondsineternity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhdoiYECfwG9DcHLUSVbEBA\">@sadicallyrad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzUOhteLtgguhE--eKKQsg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzUOhteLtgguhE--eKKQsg\">@hedwigthelegend</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://h0tshotstark.tumblr.com/\">h0tshotstark</a></p><p><b><i>Incomplete Taglist:</i></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href=\"http://pastlives-purplesouls.tumblr.com/\">@pastlives-purplesouls</a> <a href=\"https://legendarydazekitten.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMZ-UcXbEUMdnnMPh6_8nxA\">@legendarydazekitten</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOcGv3OI79sACfWcjvghG9Q\">@appreciating-chase-brody</a>\u00a0<strike>@eternal-l-appel-du-vide</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdYRrgT_TdrsecFYBevj3fA\">@tony-iron-man-stark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpwC4yJ3H6rexB0htawL84A\">@livinlifelikeishould</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj_68GA6gttpJvn9cpy5-tQ\">@spidreling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miZmvK4aoXseNcG7ZVul7Ag\">@hollandhearts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jjhUSEjAE34RgHiiTj0dw\">@parrkerspeters</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mONGTzXpAeJ4nxV7taAwnCw\">@starlightfound</a> @<a href=\"https://msmith043003.tumblr.com/\">msmith043003</a> @<a href=\"http://holyhellthatbook.tumblr.com/\">holyhellthatbook</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUS0QH7Ym_s7_SzdM0M1ScA\">@someonekeepstakingmyusernames</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mONGTzXpAeJ4nxV7taAwnCw\">@starlightfound</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGkBTEErFhZU6AkxfsXu_GQ\">@random-writer06</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\">@a\u20131\u20131\u20133</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9PSwuP6wPdDJX6kR3btVKg\">@janglebell</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/modul5WLFykhJb21jTy9ryA\">@spider-mendes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml_cwiWEa6mou846wpZhH5Q\">@peterparker-glee-other</a></p><p><b><i><strike>strikethrough</strike> means i couldn\u2019t tag you &lt;3\u00a0</i></b></p>",

The ones holding the key to finding your perfect match.</p><p>You can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s a part of this that isn\u2019t entirely true. How can someone have a perfect match? How can your perfect match be someone you\u2019ve never met?</p><p>\u201c-that your tattoo isn\u2019t the first thing your soulmate says to you,\u201d Liz is shaking her head and your eyes snap to hers, trying to focus your mind on the subject at hand but she isn\u2019t looking at you. You push around your milk carton, eyes finding a white spot on your perfectly blue lunch tray. \u201cShe said it\u2019s the first thing your soulmate says when you\u2019re ready to find them.\u201d</p><p>Her voice holds an excitement on the subject you couldn\u2019t fake if you tried, but your eyebrows pinch at the words. The topic of soulmates isn\u2019t exactly rare in your group of friends, but this theory is one that you\u2019ve never heard and you can\u2019t help it when you intervene. </p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be right.\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>Suddenly every pair of eyes at your table lands on you, and you find yourself wishing you\u2019d said nothing at all. <br></p><p>Your gaze finds Nora\u2019s, who\u2019s sitting in front of you with a curious smile. She tucks a lock of blonde hair behind her ear before crossing her arms over the table. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a tiny red line marking the inside skin of her elbow, the only proof that she had a tattoo to begin with. It\u2019s rare for a teenager to find their soulmate, but she was over the moon once she got over the initial pain and shock of finding them so soon.</p><p>You were happy for her, <i>of course</i>, but something about soulmates made your skin crawl. The sheer powerlessness of it all. </p><p>\u201cIt just seems weird,\u201d you shake your head. \u201cHow can you <i>be ready</i>? How do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask way too many questions,\u201d Liam buds in from beside Nora. There\u2019s a crooked smile resting against his lips, suggesting the words a mere joke but you can feel the irritation beginning to course through your veins. </p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t ask enough,\u201d you say. He shrugs and takes a long swig of his coke. </p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d he laughs around the can of sticky sugar. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an automatic thing,\u201d Nora explains, something happy dancing in her green eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all predetermined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPredetermined by <i>who</i>?\u201d you ask, swiping your plastic fork from your plate and nibbling on the ends of it. The plastic bends easily beneath your teeth. \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird that you\u2019re just supposed meet some random person who says the words you\u2019ve been assigned and <i>bam</i>, you\u2019re practically married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you know that\u2019s not how it works,\u201d Nora says, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s an exaggeration,\u201d you admit, throwing down your plastic tupperware again. \u201cBut now, <i>apparently,</i> I might already know them? Am I the only one who thinks that\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Liam shakes his head, a crooked smile on his face, and shoves a burnt french fry in his mouth. His expression twists into one of disgust a second later, but he swallows it down nonetheless. \u201cYeah, you are.\u201d</p><p>Liz leans closer to you and nudges your arm softly. \u201cWhy is this so important to you?\u201d she asks. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you say honestly. Nora furrows her brows and though it seems as if Liam is preoccupied with the manufactured food on his tray, you know his ears are trained on your words. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be able to <i>choose</i> who you fall in love with?\u201d</p><p>You watch their faces with a sudden desperation you didn\u2019t know you possessed. Desperation to be heard, desperation to be <i>understood</i>. The crease between Nora\u2019s brows deepens as she takes in your inquiry, Liam shakes his head and Liz just stares at you, as if you started spewing sentences in Dothraki. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she finally says. Her head tilts to the side, causing her midnight curls to fall over her shoulders in an ocean of black. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>You suck on your teeth and push your greens around your tray with a plastic fork. \u201cJust forget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see it\u2019s better this way,\u201d Nora says, her voice soft as if she\u2019s trying not to spook you. \u201cWhen you meet your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>You know she\u2019s only trying to reassure you of your doubts, but her words stir something strange in your chest. You feel like you\u2019re being brainwashed. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you breathe out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s exciting,\u201d Liz exclaims, clasping her hands together atop the table. \u201cWhat if your soulmate is here <i>right now</i>?\u2019</p><p>Her eyes shimmer with something hopeful, you can\u2019t help but store away your own reservations, at least for the time being. </p><p>\u201cKnowing you, you have at least thirty options as to who it could be,\u201d Liam says with a smirk, once again an active participant of the conversation. </p><p>\u201cMaybe Alex Smith?\u201d she wonders, resting her chin on her palm. You snort, turning away when she shoots you a questioning glance. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing,\u201d you shake your head, worrying your bottom lip between your teeth. </p><p>\u201cAlex Smith wears the same shirt, like, four out of five school days,\u201d Liam reaches over Nora\u2019s arms to snatch up her untouched bowl of fruit. She barely puts up a fight, knowing full well she\u2019ll only pick at it until the bell rings, but doesn\u2019t hesitate to clip him over his ear. </p><p>\u201cYou know you could <i>ask</i>,\u201d she jokes, while Liz starts to sputter with protests. </p><p>\u201cThat is <i>so</i> not true,\u201d she says, eyes already searching the crowded cafeteria to fact check her friend\u2019s accusation. Her face falls when she does but she quickly recovers, flashing Liam a sarcastic smile and flicking a lock of hair behind her shoulder. \u201cOkay well what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you or for me?\u201d he cards a hand through his dark hair, quirking an eyebrow when she shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met yours yet,\u201d he supplies.</p><p>Liz\u2019s face morphs into an adorable pout before switching to a smirk just as easily.\u00a0\u201cWhat if one of your exes is your soulmate?\u201d</p><p>He scoffs, eyes rolling upward and you share a knowing glance with Nora.\u00a0</p><p>Although most seem to wait for their soulmate to start dating, it\u2019s not uncommon for romantic relationships to develop outside of the chosen, and Liam is no stranger to that way of living.\u00a0</p><p>It seems he has a new significant other every week, and you can\u2019t help but feel sorry for the poor hearts he often breaks. Then again, he can\u2019t be bothered to change and the boys and girls who are victim to his fleeting love seem to come out okay on the other side.</p><p>He shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s never gonna happen,\u201d he says, and then \u201cI hope<i> mine </i>is Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>Your spine snaps into a rigid straight line and you reel back at the words like you\u2019ve been slapped. Nora and Liz begin to laugh. </p><p>\u201c<i>Peter Parker</i>?\u201d you question. \u201cWhy on<i> earth-</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d Liam laughs. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got a six pack you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that totally makes up for being an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got one of those too,\u201d He shrugs with a smile when you screw up your face, then shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m messing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank go-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s yours.\u201d </p><p>Nora laughs vehemently, throwing her head back and slapping the table with an open palm. Liz has the decency to try and hide her laughter between her fingers, but her giggles still slip through her skin and seep into your own. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d you deadpan, unable to supress the curse from your lips and suddenly Liam is joining in on the snickers. You think you might explode. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be something,\u201d Nora licks her lips, trying to regain her composure. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019d jump off of a cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be so dramatic,\u201d Liz pokes your cheek, just two short jabs, but your skin stings at her touch. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m known for,\u201d you say, rising from the rickety bench you\u2019ve been uncomfortably perched on for twenty minutes. Liam and Nora watch you stand languidly, but Liz pushes herself up from the seat a moment later. </p><p>\u201cBathroom?\u201d she asks and you nod, slinging your bag over your shoulder. </p><p>It\u2019s a stringy grey thing given to you by your dad when you started middle school and despite the pleas of your friends to invest in a new one, and the fact that one Peter Parker teases you about it any chance he gets, you find comfort in the packet. Especially when your dad is away on work trips, which you find that he<i> is </i>more often than not. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you step away from the stained lunch table, offering Nora and Liam a two fingered salute before Liz grabs your hand and pulls you from the cafeteria, but not before dragging you past Peter\u2019s lunch table. </p><p>You stumble behind your friend, senselessly letting your eyes skitter over his figure- slouched over, smiling brightly at something his friends are saying- but his gaze meets your when you don\u2019t turn away quick enough, and the fragile piece of Peter Parker that you\u2019ve never known shatters before your eyes. </p><p>He glares at you, blankly somehow and the indifference harborded in your gut burns into a raging fury. </p><p>When you finally fall through the cafeteria doors, leading to a near empty hallway, you whirl around to face a simpering Liz.</p><p>\u201cWe could have used the other doors,\u201d you say, arching a brow. \u201cYou know, the ones that were closer to our table and <i>not</i> in the direction of Parker\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She bats her eyelashes to feign innocence, but her shit-eating grin and the glimmer in her eyes betray her too quickly. \u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d</p><p>You groan, setting course for the bathroom again. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like watching the sexual tension between the two of you,\u201d she shrugs and you stick out your tongue in disgust. \u201cOh my god, imagine if the two of you were, like, <i>actually</i> soulmates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not supposed to despise your soulmate, Lizzy,\u201d you roll your eyes, watching a few of your peers mull around the halls. A few of them smile as you pass, and you return the gesture before focusing on the girl next to you again. She tucks a dark lock of hair behind her ear, the straightened piece losing its heat and starting to frizz again on the end. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says, cocking her head. \u201cThe odds are like, one-in-a-zillion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a real number, how\u2019d you get into this school again?\u201d </p><p><br>She twists her face, her nose wrinkling at the words as she pushes open the grey bathroom door. It squeaks on its hinges, the sound echoing across tiled walls. </p><p>Liz walks in a straight line towards the dirty mirrors, running her delicate fingers through her hair while you walk into one of the empty, and <i>horribly</i> smelly, stalls. </p><p>When you step out again, Liz is still admiring her reflection, this time reapplying her lip balm and you can\u2019t help the smile that eases onto your face. Even in the dingy bathroom mirrors she\u2019s gorgeous, and she holds herself with a confidence you can only hope to one day possess. </p><p>She grins when she catches sight of you in the mirror, a pearly white smile lined with full lips. </p><p>You step forward, running your hands underneath the faucet and shaking your skin dry before nodding your head to the door again. Liz taps the back of your bag. </p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d she asks. </p><p>You nod, sliding forwards on the damp tiled floor- no doubt from students opting to shake the drops of water from their hands rather than dry them on the less than sanitary towels, like you- and shove open the door again. </p><p>The hall is still halfway empty, and a quick glance at the clock on a far wall tells you that there are twenty minutes left until your lunch break ends.</p><p>You make a beeline for the cafeteria, and Liz trails behind you for a moment before her long legs are catching up to yours in easy strides. </p><p>Neither of you speaks for a moment, and you let your hand travel to your mark as you walk. It doesn\u2019t take Liz long to catch on to the movement and she swipes up your hand as you let it fall, one of her perfectly manicured eyebrows arched. </p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve been messing with your tattoo <i>all</i> day. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>She tries to turn you away from her, no doubt to inspect it, but you step out of her reach and pull away from her touch. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please,\u201d she rolls her eyes and takes a step forward just as easily as you took one back. Her dark eyes glimmer with curiosity, and you decide that she\u2019ll never stop pressing if you don\u2019t just tell her now. \u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head, clenching your fist to keep yourself from reaching upwards again. \u201cIt just itches a little, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she\u2019s staring at you like she doesn\u2019t believe you, and you can\u2019t exactly say that you blame her between your wincing and the redness of the skin around your mark. But she doesn\u2019t need to know the extent of it, telling her the problem and<i> detailing </i>it are two very different things. \u201cProbably just a mosquito bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like one,\u201d she sing-songs, but starts her trek through the school halls again.</p><p><i>That was close,</i> you think to yourself. </p><p>You\u2019re not sure why you\u2019re lying to her. Maybe it\u2019s your own concern taking the wheel, or the fact that you know she\u2019ll make a bigger deal of it than it should be, but it\u2019s too late to turn back now. </p><p>She\u2019s a few steps ahead of you when a new thought pops into your head, this one more urgent. </p><p>\u201cOh wait,\u201d your steps halt suddenly, and Liz shoots farther ahead before she turns her head and stops. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks, wearing a quizzical expression. </p><p>\u201cI need to grab some books out of my locker,\u201d you nod in the opposite direction, back down the way you came. \u201cI\u2019ll meet up with you in a second.\u201d</p><p>She dips her head, a nod yes, before pushing through the cafeteria doors and leaving you to yourself. You start your trek towards your locker, nothing on your mind but seemingly useless things- the weather, your friends, your soulmark. </p><p>Your hand travels to the bumpy tattoo on your neck once more, as if called there and in the privacy of the empty halls you let your fingers roam the irritated skin. You know what it says, you\u2019ve known since it appeared, but what it<i> means</i>\u2026 what elicits it is what confuses you, intrigues you and<i> pisses</i> you off. </p><p>You turn the corner, still lost in thought, but when you finally notice Peter Parker leaning against your locker, a smile pressed on his lips, your arm falls in surprise. </p><p>He isn\u2019t looking at you; he probably doesn\u2019t even know that yours is the locker he\u2019s decided to block, but it <i>is</i>, leaving you in an uncomfortable situation that will surely end in a verbal brawl.</p><p>Ned is standing in front of him, animatedly telling a story that you know you\u2019ll never hear\u2014 <i>not</i> that you\u2019d want to\u2014 and you steel yourself at the sight of them before marching over to the pair, your shoulders set back in determination. </p><p>As if sensing your presence, Peter\u2019s eyes dart from Ned\u2019s face to yours. Just like every time he sees you, the smile that he was wearing vanishes from his lips. You think that in another world, it would hurt that you\u2019re able to bring such displeasure to someone just by being in their line of sight, but with him it twists something like satisfaction in your gut.</p><p>Ned picks up on his sudden change of demeanor, but unlike Peter, when his eyes meet yours his face splits into an even bigger grin. </p><p>You\u2019ve always liked Ned. He was always kind to you, even when Peter was cruel.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he calls, and a smile pulls at your lips. </p><p>\u201cHey, Ned.\u201d</p><p>Peter crosses his arms as you approach, head tilting upwards. You wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the motion is only so that he can say that he\u2019s <i>literally </i>looking down on you. You try not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just who I was looking for,\u201d Ned says, pulling your attention to him once more. You slow your pace, cocking your head in confusion. </p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d you question, trying to block Peter in your peripheral, trying to block the stupid smirk that\u2019s now replaced his frown. </p><p>\u201cLiam said you needed the notes that we got in History?\u201d your eyes flit to the notebook that Ned\u2019s grasping in a hand, and to the letters adorning it. The words he\u2019s written in a playful scrawl are highlighted with a spectrum of colors.</p><p>\u201c<i>Right,</i>\u201d you tuck a lock of hair behind your ear and roll your eyes. \u201cOf course he couldn\u2019t be bothered to do it himself. Sorry, Ned.\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a scoff at that, small and easy to miss, but you turn to him anyways. </p><p>\u201cIf you have something to say,\u201d you press the heels of your hands into your hips. \u201cThen say it.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, eyeing you up and down. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>Your stomach twists with irritation and you try not to fume as Ned takes a step forward, his smile pinched. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, Y/N,\u201d he says, tearing the papers from his book and handing them to you gently. </p><p>You turn away from Peter, letting the anger ease from your face when your eyes focus on Ned once more. \u201cI owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re square,\u201d he steps back again, cocking his head. \u201cLast year, Physics?\u201d</p><p>Your mind shoots back to the year prior, when both Ned and Peter were out sick and you took notes for the former unbeknownst that they would be passed on to the ladder afterwards. But you\u2019re square. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you nod. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>You take a new step forward, almost directly in front of Peter but all he does is stare at you, a single eyebrow arched. You tense your jaw. </p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d to anybody who doesn\u2019t know him, his voice would sound sincere and concerned, but you\u2019ve learned to uncover the underlying sarcasm and bite of irritation that accompany the words. </p><p>You cross your arms, letting your eyes dart across his face. \u201cYou\u2019re leaning against my locker.\u201d </p><p>He grins, sarcastic and so obviously an attempt to rile you up that you can\u2019t give him the satisfaction of knowing that it really <i>does.</i> \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, sounding anything but sincere. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d He doesn\u2019t make any attempt to move, and you can see Ned fidgeting nervously next to you at his friends defiance. \u201cI\u2019d,\u201d you breathe, clenching your teeth so hard you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll shatter. \u201c<i>Appreciate</i> it if you would get out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Still, he doesn\u2019t budge, but a new condescending smile pulls at his lips and he hums. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>The expression he wears takes you back to when you were young and in elementary school. He used to stand behind you when you walked in straight lines around the school and he\u2019d always pull at the end of your ponytail. Any time you\u2019d turn to glare at him, to yell at him to stop he\u2019d wear this same expression. Even years later it makes you want to break his jaw. </p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d your voice is set in a deadpan when the words leave your lips and your face is wiped of any emotion, but you\u2019re quite sure you\u2019ve never spoken a heavier truth. </p><p>He laughs at that, a silly and boyish thing but there\u2019s an underlying harshness that tangles into the sound. \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>Ned steps forward as Peter talks, and grabs his arm tightly. \u201cCome on, man,\u201d he pleads. </p><p>Peter glances at Ned and the cocky expression laid out on his face flickers for a moment, then he turns to you again, his face wiped completely. You cross your arms and wait.</p><p>It takes him a few seconds to heed Ned\u2019s request, but when he does you don\u2019t hesitate to occupy the spot where he stood and shove open your locker door. </p><p>Your fingers grapple for your textbooks, but when you turn around after cramming them into your bag, Peter is still standing behind you, something mischievous in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anyone else to piss off?\u201d you ask, slinging your backpack over your shoulder again and closing your locker door. Peter cocks his head. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m literally just standing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour presence is more than enough,\u201d you shift in place and suck on your teeth. A soft pressure begins to set on the back of your neck, but you write it off as nothing. It has to be. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, and a dark lock of hair falls away from its peers and curls over his forehead. If you didn\u2019t hate him so much you\u2019d think it might be beautiful. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a new bag?\u201d he asks. There\u2019s honest curiosity in his voice, and he looks like a child asking why the sky is blue, but the question stirs something deep inside of you. </p><p>Maybe you\u2019re too protective over it, maybe the anger boiling in your gut is irrational and reckless but you can\u2019t help it when the feeling transforms into words spilling over your lips. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a new personality?\u201d</p><p>He purses his lips and releases the air lodged in his lungs, but his eyes hold his humor. It does nothing but anger you more. </p><p>Your skin itches and the hair on the back of your neck rises, and the pressure is on your tattoo, you realize. </p><p>\u201cYou thought hard on that one didn\u2019t you?\u201d he says, shoving his hands in his pockets. His tone has changed from curious to halfway cruel. </p><p>Ned takes a step back now, his eyebrows still bumped together. For a moment you forgot he was even there to begin with, and though it does nothing to change the situation, you feel almost disappointed with his choice to stay out of the argument. </p><p>\u201cCan you just leave me alone?\u201d you bark, turning your gaze back to Peter. \u201cJust <i>once</i>, mind your own buisness and fuck off?\u201d</p><p>With every passing second the pressure on your soulmark grows more and more until you\u2019re afraid it might burst, but you blame it on your anger rather than anything else. You blame it on the adrenaline coursing through your veins. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk!\u201d he yells, brandishing his hands in anger. You balk at his sudden change of tone. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOh, you wanna bet?\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Your body goes rigid the second the words leave his lips, and suddenly you feel as if you\u2019ve been dipped in liquid fire and thrown into an icy bath all at once. You\u2019re left blubbering in confusion and for a second you think you\u2019re going through early menopause-<i> very early</i> menopause- that it\u2019s merely a coincidence that his question is the same one that\u2019s printed on your skin; but then a searing pain shoots up your spine.</p><p>\u201c<i>Wait</i>,\u201d you gasp, right before your legs give out underneath you.</p><p>Peter\u2019s arms are outstretched and he darts forwards to keep you from hitting the ground, but you yank your arm away before he can touch it, and your knees hit the tiled ground a moment later. </p><p>There\u2019s no doubt in your mind that they\u2019ll be colored with bruises in time, but that\u2019s almost the least of your concerns. </p><p>You cup the back of your neck, as if you can shield it from the pain, but it only burns hotter. Tears gather in the corners of your eyes and Peter\u2019s face begins to blur into an unrecognizable blob. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t touch you, like he\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll crumble at the first brush of his fingers, but he does inch closer, hands hovering halfway through the air. </p><p>And then, as suddenly as it happened to you, he gasps and his face drains of color.</p><p>Maybe the same thing is happening to him, but what on earth <i>is it</i>?</p><p>He grapples for his ribs, keeling forward and bracing his hand on the tile next to yours. There\u2019s sweat collecting on his brow and he\u2019s close enough that you can make out every detail of his face as you blink away your tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks, panic lacing his gaze. You almost find it in yourself to roll your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>know,</i>\u201d you snap, squeezing your eyes shut to try and brave the sting, but it\u2019s fading just as fast as it arrived.</p><p>The sound of Ned\u2019s shuffling feet fills your ears, next to his mumbling and that of someone else. When you look up again, peeling your eyes open, you see Michelle Jones with a rare startled look on her face mirroring Ned\u2019s surprise.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you hear her mumble, and then Peter\u2019s sitting up and blocking her from view. </p><p>His face has regained its color, now a bright red and his brows are bumped together in a mix of confusion and concern. You stand up at the same time, but when you stumble and he doesn\u2019t, he grabs your forearms to steady you. </p><p>His skin presses against yours, hard and soft and suddenly you find that you\u2019re feeling better, you feel like nothing ever happened at all, so you pull away from him and throw up a shield. </p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d his voice is low and timid. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p><i>Like you care</i>, you want to say. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you say instead, trying to ignore the way your stomach drops at the complete lack of <i>him</i>. Of his skin against yours, because you\u2019re not supposed to feel that at all. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he scratches the back of his neck, but his eyes are foggy and it almost seems like he\u2019s looking<i> through</i> you rather than at you. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>A cough sounds behind him, and when you glance over your shoulder you see his friends, \u00a0fidgeting nervously. Ned\u2019s face is twisted into pity and concern, but MJ is smirking devilishly. </p><p>\u201cUh, guys,\u201d Ned stutters weakly, scratching the back of his neck. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Peter asks, his hand drifting to his ribs again, you wonder if that\u2019s where his tattoo hides. And then you find yourself wondering why he would be reaching for it at all. </p><p>MJ huffs out a laugh, then smothers it with her palm and shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna like it,\u201d she says. </p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d you press. Your hand begins to drift upwards automatically, searching for the bumpy mark on your neck, but when your fingers brush over the surface you find nothing but smooth skin. Your blood runs cold. </p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Ned swallows, visibly hesitant and MJ nudges his shoulder, prompting him to continue. \u201cI think you guys are soulmates.\u201d he finally says. It sounds forced and meek and he winces after the words clear the air. You think you might faint. </p><p>You <i>don\u2019t.</i></p><p>You want to scream and yell and curse at the sky, but when you open your mouth no words aid you. So Peter yells instead. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i><b>Permanent Taglist:</b></i></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbIwCgwZCsLKX-9g8RncILA\">@signed-potato</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maWg3Y2rRoN4fJwBIHsAHpQ\">@awkwardnesshabitat</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXDwScBzojYIj4wWL9bs-lQ\">@spideyboipete</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjbIIN1EFUDHC-CU2k_g3sw\">@thelivvylovegood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@laureharrier</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ3r0EnrsVP4wrUmbjmBPEw\">@anxieteandbiscuits</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHzeUidPwl8Iq_VMWOIC4QA\">@ukulele-tea-and-ocean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh-yD4HHGZ0AYt4LzP_ZObg\">@lovely-</a>parker<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW_Ib2Bce52Migr7csRwWCg\">@veryspectacularspiderling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\">@sunshineandparker</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdr9j8nAQCXZH6kqXFVjyoQ\">@minnie-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF9vAkjL9o-1ksPHeivoD4A\">@imnotbitter-anna</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKuQ-_5GfUqjZej8sgK1wSQ\">@magic-marvel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moE_3Ph0oXCxZzl1_Y1Ct1g\">@quxntumvandyne</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mql_a-LCJHBFAYRe-UTCQmA\">@lokiisragnarok</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU7AxU4LDHKQ63LVRL9RITA\">@highlady-ofthe-summercourt</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKwwd_5Dai95XE8150lF9xQ\">@secondsineternity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhdoiYECfwG9DcHLUSVbEBA\">@sadicallyrad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzUOhteLtgguhE--eKKQsg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzUOhteLtgguhE--eKKQsg\">@hedwigthelegend</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://h0tshotstark.tumblr.com/\">h0tshotstark</a></p><p><b><i>Incomplete Taglist:</i></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href=\"http://pastlives-purplesouls.tumblr.com/\">@pastlives-purplesouls</a> <a href=\"https://legendarydazekitten.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMZ-UcXbEUMdnnMPh6_8nxA\">@legendarydazekitten</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOcGv3OI79sACfWcjvghG9Q\">@appreciating-chase-brody</a>\u00a0<strike>@eternal-l-appel-du-vide</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdYRrgT_TdrsecFYBevj3fA\">@tony-iron-man-stark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpwC4yJ3H6rexB0htawL84A\">@livinlifelikeishould</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj_68GA6gttpJvn9cpy5-tQ\">@spidreling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miZmvK4aoXseNcG7ZVul7Ag\">@hollandhearts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jjhUSEjAE34RgHiiTj0dw\">@parrkerspeters</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mONGTzXpAeJ4nxV7taAwnCw\">@starlightfound</a> @<a href=\"https://msmith043003.tumblr.com/\">msmith043003</a> @<a href=\"http://holyhellthatbook.tumblr.com/\">holyhellthatbook</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUS0QH7Ym_s7_SzdM0M1ScA\">@someonekeepstakingmyusernames</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mONGTzXpAeJ4nxV7taAwnCw\">@starlightfound</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGkBTEErFhZU6AkxfsXu_GQ\">@random-writer06</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\">@a\u20131\u20131\u20133</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9PSwuP6wPdDJX6kR3btVKg\">@janglebell</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/modul5WLFykhJb21jTy9ryA\">@spider-mendes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml_cwiWEa6mou846wpZhH5Q\">@peterparker-glee-other</a></p><p><b><i><strike>strikethrough</strike> means i couldn\u2019t tag you &lt;3\u00a0</i></b></p>",

The ones holding the key to finding your perfect match.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t help but wonder if there&rsquo;s a part of this that isn&rsquo;t entirely true. How can someone have a perfect match? How can your perfect match be someone you&rsquo;ve never met?</p><p>&ldquo;-that your tattoo isn&rsquo;t the first thing your soulmate says to you,&rdquo; Liz is shaking her head and your eyes snap to hers, trying to focus your mind on the subject at hand but she isn&rsquo;t looking at you. You push around your milk carton, eyes finding a white spot on your perfectly blue lunch tray. &ldquo;She said it&rsquo;s the first thing your soulmate says when you&rsquo;re ready to find them.&rdquo;</p><p>Her voice holds an excitement on the subject you couldn&rsquo;t fake if you tried, but your eyebrows pinch at the words. The topic of soulmates isn&rsquo;t exactly rare in your group of friends, but this theory is one that you&rsquo;ve never heard and you can&rsquo;t help it when you intervene. </p><p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be right.&rdquo; </p><p>Suddenly every pair of eyes at your table lands on you, and you find yourself wishing you&rsquo;d said nothing at all. <br /></p><p>Your gaze finds Nora&rsquo;s, who&rsquo;s sitting in front of you with a curious smile. She tucks a lock of blonde hair behind her ear before crossing her arms over the table. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </p><p>There&rsquo;s a tiny red line marking the inside skin of her elbow, the only proof that she had a tattoo to begin with. It&rsquo;s rare for a teenager to find their soulmate, but she was over the moon once she got over the initial pain and shock of finding them so soon.</p><p>You were happy for her, <i>of course</i>, but something about soulmates made your skin crawl. The sheer powerlessness of it all. </p><p>&ldquo;It just seems weird,&rdquo; you shake your head. &ldquo;How can you <i>be ready</i>? How do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You ask way too many questions,&rdquo; Liam buds in from beside Nora. There&rsquo;s a crooked smile resting against his lips, suggesting the words a mere joke but you can feel the irritation beginning to course through your veins. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you don&rsquo;t ask enough,&rdquo; you say. He shrugs and takes a long swig of his coke. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you say,&rdquo; he laughs around the can of sticky sugar. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an automatic thing,&rdquo; Nora explains, something happy dancing in her green eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all predetermined.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Predetermined by <i>who</i>?&rdquo; you ask, swiping your plastic fork from your plate and nibbling on the ends of it. The plastic bends easily beneath your teeth. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it weird that you&rsquo;re just supposed meet some random person who says the words you&rsquo;ve been assigned and <i>bam</i>, you&rsquo;re practically married?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, you know that&rsquo;s not how it works,&rdquo; Nora says, shaking her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s an exaggeration,&rdquo; you admit, throwing down your plastic tupperware again. &ldquo;But now, <i>apparently,</i> I might already know them? Am I the only one who thinks that&rsquo;s weird?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; Liam shakes his head, a crooked smile on his face, and shoves a burnt french fry in his mouth. His expression twists into one of disgust a second later, but he swallows it down nonetheless. &ldquo;Yeah, you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Liz leans closer to you and nudges your arm softly. &ldquo;Why is this so important to you?&rdquo; she asks. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you say honestly. Nora furrows her brows and though it seems as if Liam is preoccupied with the manufactured food on his tray, you know his ears are trained on your words. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to be able to <i>choose</i> who you fall in love with?&rdquo;</p><p>You watch their faces with a sudden desperation you didn&rsquo;t know you possessed. Desperation to be heard, desperation to be <i>understood</i>. The crease between Nora&rsquo;s brows deepens as she takes in your inquiry, Liam shakes his head and Liz just stares at you, as if you started spewing sentences in Dothraki. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she finally says. Her head tilts to the side, causing her midnight curls to fall over her shoulders in an ocean of black. &ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p><p>You suck on your teeth and push your greens around your tray with a plastic fork. &ldquo;Just forget I said anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s better this way,&rdquo; Nora says, her voice soft as if she&rsquo;s trying not to spook you. &ldquo;When you meet your soulmate.&rdquo;</p><p>You know she&rsquo;s only trying to reassure you of your doubts, but her words stir something strange in your chest. You feel like you&rsquo;re being brainwashed. </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; you breathe out a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s exciting,&rdquo; Liz exclaims, clasping her hands together atop the table. &ldquo;What if your soulmate is here <i>right now</i>?&rsquo;</p><p>Her eyes shimmer with something hopeful, you can&rsquo;t help but store away your own reservations, at least for the time being. </p><p>&ldquo;Knowing you, you have at least thirty options as to who it could be,&rdquo; Liam says with a smirk, once again an active participant of the conversation. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe Alex Smith?&rdquo; she wonders, resting her chin on her palm. You snort, turning away when she shoots you a questioning glance. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, nothing,&rdquo; you shake your head, worrying your bottom lip between your teeth. </p><p>&ldquo;Alex Smith wears the same shirt, like, four out of five school days,&rdquo; Liam reaches over Nora&rsquo;s arms to snatch up her untouched bowl of fruit. She barely puts up a fight, knowing full well she&rsquo;ll only pick at it until the bell rings, but doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to clip him over his ear. </p><p>&ldquo;You know you could <i>ask</i>,&rdquo; she jokes, while Liz starts to sputter with protests. </p><p>&ldquo;That is <i>so</i> not true,&rdquo; she says, eyes already searching the crowded cafeteria to fact check her friend&rsquo;s accusation. Her face falls when she does but she quickly recovers, flashing Liam a sarcastic smile and flicking a lock of hair behind her shoulder. &ldquo;Okay well what do you think?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For you or for me?&rdquo; he cards a hand through his dark hair, quirking an eyebrow when she shrugs. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve met yours yet,&rdquo; he supplies.</p><p>Liz&rsquo;s face morphs into an adorable pout before switching to a smirk just as easily.&nbsp;&ldquo;What if one of your exes is your soulmate?&rdquo;</p><p>He scoffs, eyes rolling upward and you share a knowing glance with Nora.&nbsp;</p><p>Although most seem to wait for their soulmate to start dating, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for romantic relationships to develop outside of the chosen, and Liam is no stranger to that way of living.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems he has a new significant other every week, and you can&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for the poor hearts he often breaks. Then again, he can&rsquo;t be bothered to change and the boys and girls who are victim to his fleeting love seem to come out okay on the other side.</p><p>He shakes his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s never gonna happen,&rdquo; he says, and then &ldquo;I hope<i> mine </i>is Peter Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>Your spine snaps into a rigid straight line and you reel back at the words like you&rsquo;ve been slapped. Nora and Liz begin to laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Peter Parker</i>?&rdquo; you question. &ldquo;Why on<i> earth-</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s cute,&rdquo; Liam laughs. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s got a six pack you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because that totally makes up for being an ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got one of those too,&rdquo; He shrugs with a smile when you screw up your face, then shakes his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m messing with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank go-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo; </p><p>Nora laughs vehemently, throwing her head back and slapping the table with an open palm. Liz has the decency to try and hide her laughter between her fingers, but her giggles still slip through her skin and seep into your own. </p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck,&rdquo; you deadpan, unable to supress the curse from your lips and suddenly Liam is joining in on the snickers. You think you might explode. </p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be something,&rdquo; Nora licks her lips, trying to regain her composure. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think I&rsquo;d jump off of a cliff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so dramatic,&rdquo; Liz pokes your cheek, just two short jabs, but your skin stings at her touch. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m known for,&rdquo; you say, rising from the rickety bench you&rsquo;ve been uncomfortably perched on for twenty minutes. Liam and Nora watch you stand languidly, but Liz pushes herself up from the seat a moment later. </p><p>&ldquo;Bathroom?&rdquo; she asks and you nod, slinging your bag over your shoulder. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a stringy grey thing given to you by your dad when you started middle school and despite the pleas of your friends to invest in a new one, and the fact that one Peter Parker teases you about it any chance he gets, you find comfort in the packet. Especially when your dad is away on work trips, which you find that he<i> is </i>more often than not. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you step away from the stained lunch table, offering Nora and Liam a two fingered salute before Liz grabs your hand and pulls you from the cafeteria, but not before dragging you past Peter&rsquo;s lunch table. </p><p>You stumble behind your friend, senselessly letting your eyes skitter over his figure- slouched over, smiling brightly at something his friends are saying- but his gaze meets your when you don&rsquo;t turn away quick enough, and the fragile piece of Peter Parker that you&rsquo;ve never known shatters before your eyes. </p><p>He glares at you, blankly somehow and the indifference harborded in your gut burns into a raging fury. </p><p>When you finally fall through the cafeteria doors, leading to a near empty hallway, you whirl around to face a simpering Liz.</p><p>&ldquo;We could have used the other doors,&rdquo; you say, arching a brow. &ldquo;You know, the ones that were closer to our table and <i>not</i> in the direction of Parker&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>She bats her eyelashes to feign innocence, but her shit-eating grin and the glimmer in her eyes betray her too quickly. &ldquo;Whatever do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>You groan, setting course for the bathroom again. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like watching the sexual tension between the two of you,&rdquo; she shrugs and you stick out your tongue in disgust. &ldquo;Oh my god, imagine if the two of you were, like, <i>actually</i> soulmates.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;re not supposed to despise your soulmate, Lizzy,&rdquo; you roll your eyes, watching a few of your peers mull around the halls. A few of them smile as you pass, and you return the gesture before focusing on the girl next to you again. She tucks a dark lock of hair behind her ear, the straightened piece losing its heat and starting to frizz again on the end. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she says, cocking her head. &ldquo;The odds are like, one-in-a-zillion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a real number, how&rsquo;d you get into this school again?&rdquo; </p><p><br />She twists her face, her nose wrinkling at the words as she pushes open the grey bathroom door. It squeaks on its hinges, the sound echoing across tiled walls. </p><p>Liz walks in a straight line towards the dirty mirrors, running her delicate fingers through her hair while you walk into one of the empty, and <i>horribly</i> smelly, stalls. </p><p>When you step out again, Liz is still admiring her reflection, this time reapplying her lip balm and you can&rsquo;t help the smile that eases onto your face. Even in the dingy bathroom mirrors she&rsquo;s gorgeous, and she holds herself with a confidence you can only hope to one day possess. </p><p>She grins when she catches sight of you in the mirror, a pearly white smile lined with full lips. </p><p>You step forward, running your hands underneath the faucet and shaking your skin dry before nodding your head to the door again. Liz taps the back of your bag. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; she asks. </p><p>You nod, sliding forwards on the damp tiled floor- no doubt from students opting to shake the drops of water from their hands rather than dry them on the less than sanitary towels, like you- and shove open the door again. </p><p>The hall is still halfway empty, and a quick glance at the clock on a far wall tells you that there are twenty minutes left until your lunch break ends.</p><p>You make a beeline for the cafeteria, and Liz trails behind you for a moment before her long legs are catching up to yours in easy strides. </p><p>Neither of you speaks for a moment, and you let your hand travel to your mark as you walk. It doesn&rsquo;t take Liz long to catch on to the movement and she swipes up your hand as you let it fall, one of her perfectly manicured eyebrows arched. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;ve been messing with your tattoo <i>all</i> day. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>She tries to turn you away from her, no doubt to inspect it, but you step out of her reach and pull away from her touch. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please,&rdquo; she rolls her eyes and takes a step forward just as easily as you took one back. Her dark eyes glimmer with curiosity, and you decide that she&rsquo;ll never stop pressing if you don&rsquo;t just tell her now. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;</p><p>You shake your head, clenching your fist to keep yourself from reaching upwards again. &ldquo;It just itches a little, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; she&rsquo;s staring at you like she doesn&rsquo;t believe you, and you can&rsquo;t exactly say that you blame her between your wincing and the redness of the skin around your mark. But she doesn&rsquo;t need to know the extent of it, telling her the problem and<i> detailing </i>it are two very different things. &ldquo;Probably just a mosquito bite.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like one,&rdquo; she sing-songs, but starts her trek through the school halls again.</p><p><i>That was close,</i> you think to yourself. </p><p>You&rsquo;re not sure why you&rsquo;re lying to her. Maybe it&rsquo;s your own concern taking the wheel, or the fact that you know she&rsquo;ll make a bigger deal of it than it should be, but it&rsquo;s too late to turn back now. </p><p>She&rsquo;s a few steps ahead of you when a new thought pops into your head, this one more urgent. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh wait,&rdquo; your steps halt suddenly, and Liz shoots farther ahead before she turns her head and stops. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asks, wearing a quizzical expression. </p><p>&ldquo;I need to grab some books out of my locker,&rdquo; you nod in the opposite direction, back down the way you came. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet up with you in a second.&rdquo;</p><p>She dips her head, a nod yes, before pushing through the cafeteria doors and leaving you to yourself. You start your trek towards your locker, nothing on your mind but seemingly useless things- the weather, your friends, your soulmark. </p><p>Your hand travels to the bumpy tattoo on your neck once more, as if called there and in the privacy of the empty halls you let your fingers roam the irritated skin. You know what it says, you&rsquo;ve known since it appeared, but what it<i> means</i>&hellip; what elicits it is what confuses you, intrigues you and<i> pisses</i> you off. </p><p>You turn the corner, still lost in thought, but when you finally notice Peter Parker leaning against your locker, a smile pressed on his lips, your arm falls in surprise. </p><p>He isn&rsquo;t looking at you; he probably doesn&rsquo;t even know that yours is the locker he&rsquo;s decided to block, but it <i>is</i>, leaving you in an uncomfortable situation that will surely end in a verbal brawl.</p><p>Ned is standing in front of him, animatedly telling a story that you know you&rsquo;ll never hear&mdash; <i>not</i> that you&rsquo;d want to&mdash; and you steel yourself at the sight of them before marching over to the pair, your shoulders set back in determination. </p><p>As if sensing your presence, Peter&rsquo;s eyes dart from Ned&rsquo;s face to yours. Just like every time he sees you, the smile that he was wearing vanishes from his lips. You think that in another world, it would hurt that you&rsquo;re able to bring such displeasure to someone just by being in their line of sight, but with him it twists something like satisfaction in your gut.</p><p>Ned picks up on his sudden change of demeanor, but unlike Peter, when his eyes meet yours his face splits into an even bigger grin. </p><p>You&rsquo;ve always liked Ned. He was always kind to you, even when Peter was cruel.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; he calls, and a smile pulls at your lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Ned.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter crosses his arms as you approach, head tilting upwards. You wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the motion is only so that he can say that he&rsquo;s <i>literally </i>looking down on you. You try not to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just who I was looking for,&rdquo; Ned says, pulling your attention to him once more. You slow your pace, cocking your head in confusion. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; you question, trying to block Peter in your peripheral, trying to block the stupid smirk that&rsquo;s now replaced his frown. </p><p>&ldquo;Liam said you needed the notes that we got in History?&rdquo; your eyes flit to the notebook that Ned&rsquo;s grasping in a hand, and to the letters adorning it. The words he&rsquo;s written in a playful scrawl are highlighted with a spectrum of colors.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Right,</i>&rdquo; you tuck a lock of hair behind your ear and roll your eyes. &ldquo;Of course he couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to do it himself. Sorry, Ned.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter lets out a scoff at that, small and easy to miss, but you turn to him anyways. </p><p>&ldquo;If you have something to say,&rdquo; you press the heels of your hands into your hips. &ldquo;Then say it.&rdquo;</p><p>He shakes his head, eyeing you up and down. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo;</p><p>Your stomach twists with irritation and you try not to fume as Ned takes a step forward, his smile pinched. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big deal, Y/N,&rdquo; he says, tearing the papers from his book and handing them to you gently. </p><p>You turn away from Peter, letting the anger ease from your face when your eyes focus on Ned once more. &ldquo;I owe you one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re square,&rdquo; he steps back again, cocking his head. &ldquo;Last year, Physics?&rdquo;</p><p>Your mind shoots back to the year prior, when both Ned and Peter were out sick and you took notes for the former unbeknownst that they would be passed on to the ladder afterwards. But you&rsquo;re square. </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; you nod. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>You take a new step forward, almost directly in front of Peter but all he does is stare at you, a single eyebrow arched. You tense your jaw. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; to anybody who doesn&rsquo;t know him, his voice would sound sincere and concerned, but you&rsquo;ve learned to uncover the underlying sarcasm and bite of irritation that accompany the words. </p><p>You cross your arms, letting your eyes dart across his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaning against my locker.&rdquo; </p><p>He grins, sarcastic and so obviously an attempt to rile you up that you can&rsquo;t give him the satisfaction of knowing that it really <i>does.</i> &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he says, sounding anything but sincere. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t make any attempt to move, and you can see Ned fidgeting nervously next to you at his friends defiance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d,&rdquo; you breathe, clenching your teeth so hard you&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;ll shatter. &ldquo;<i>Appreciate</i> it if you would get out of the way.&rdquo;</p><p>Still, he doesn&rsquo;t budge, but a new condescending smile pulls at his lips and he hums. &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo;</p><p>The expression he wears takes you back to when you were young and in elementary school. He used to stand behind you when you walked in straight lines around the school and he&rsquo;d always pull at the end of your ponytail. Any time you&rsquo;d turn to glare at him, to yell at him to stop he&rsquo;d wear this same expression. Even years later it makes you want to break his jaw. </p><p>&ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; your voice is set in a deadpan when the words leave your lips and your face is wiped of any emotion, but you&rsquo;re quite sure you&rsquo;ve never spoken a heavier truth. </p><p>He laughs at that, a silly and boyish thing but there&rsquo;s an underlying harshness that tangles into the sound. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned steps forward as Peter talks, and grabs his arm tightly. &ldquo;Come on, man,&rdquo; he pleads. </p><p>Peter glances at Ned and the cocky expression laid out on his face flickers for a moment, then he turns to you again, his face wiped completely. You cross your arms and wait.</p><p>It takes him a few seconds to heed Ned&rsquo;s request, but when he does you don&rsquo;t hesitate to occupy the spot where he stood and shove open your locker door. </p><p>Your fingers grapple for your textbooks, but when you turn around after cramming them into your bag, Peter is still standing behind you, something mischievous in his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have anyone else to piss off?&rdquo; you ask, slinging your backpack over your shoulder again and closing your locker door. Peter cocks his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m literally just standing here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your presence is more than enough,&rdquo; you shift in place and suck on your teeth. A soft pressure begins to set on the back of your neck, but you write it off as nothing. It has to be. &ldquo;Did you need something?&rdquo;</p><p>He shakes his head, and a dark lock of hair falls away from its peers and curls over his forehead. If you didn&rsquo;t hate him so much you&rsquo;d think it might be beautiful. </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get a new bag?&rdquo; he asks. There&rsquo;s honest curiosity in his voice, and he looks like a child asking why the sky is blue, but the question stirs something deep inside of you. </p><p>Maybe you&rsquo;re too protective over it, maybe the anger boiling in your gut is irrational and reckless but you can&rsquo;t help it when the feeling transforms into words spilling over your lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get a new personality?&rdquo;</p><p>He purses his lips and releases the air lodged in his lungs, but his eyes hold his humor. It does nothing but anger you more. </p><p>Your skin itches and the hair on the back of your neck rises, and the pressure is on your tattoo, you realize. </p><p>&ldquo;You thought hard on that one didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he says, shoving his hands in his pockets. His tone has changed from curious to halfway cruel. </p><p>Ned takes a step back now, his eyebrows still bumped together. For a moment you forgot he was even there to begin with, and though it does nothing to change the situation, you feel almost disappointed with his choice to stay out of the argument. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you just leave me alone?&rdquo; you bark, turning your gaze back to Peter. &ldquo;Just <i>once</i>, mind your own buisness and fuck off?&rdquo;</p><p>With every passing second the pressure on your soulmark grows more and more until you&rsquo;re afraid it might burst, but you blame it on your anger rather than anything else. You blame it on the adrenaline coursing through your veins. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one to talk!&rdquo; he yells, brandishing his hands in anger. You balk at his sudden change of tone. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything about me!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, you wanna bet?&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Your body goes rigid the second the words leave his lips, and suddenly you feel as if you&rsquo;ve been dipped in liquid fire and thrown into an icy bath all at once. You&rsquo;re left blubbering in confusion and for a second you think you&rsquo;re going through early menopause-<i> very early</i> menopause- that it&rsquo;s merely a coincidence that his question is the same one that&rsquo;s printed on your skin; but then a searing pain shoots up your spine.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Wait</i>,&rdquo; you gasp, right before your legs give out underneath you.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s arms are outstretched and he darts forwards to keep you from hitting the ground, but you yank your arm away before he can touch it, and your knees hit the tiled ground a moment later. </p><p>There&rsquo;s no doubt in your mind that they&rsquo;ll be colored with bruises in time, but that&rsquo;s almost the least of your concerns. </p><p>You cup the back of your neck, as if you can shield it from the pain, but it only burns hotter. Tears gather in the corners of your eyes and Peter&rsquo;s face begins to blur into an unrecognizable blob. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t touch you, like he&rsquo;s afraid you&rsquo;ll crumble at the first brush of his fingers, but he does inch closer, hands hovering halfway through the air. </p><p>And then, as suddenly as it happened to you, he gasps and his face drains of color.</p><p>Maybe the same thing is happening to him, but what on earth <i>is it</i>?</p><p>He grapples for his ribs, keeling forward and bracing his hand on the tile next to yours. There&rsquo;s sweat collecting on his brow and he&rsquo;s close enough that you can make out every detail of his face as you blink away your tears.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he asks, panic lacing his gaze. You almost find it in yourself to roll your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>know,</i>&rdquo; you snap, squeezing your eyes shut to try and brave the sting, but it&rsquo;s fading just as fast as it arrived.</p><p>The sound of Ned&rsquo;s shuffling feet fills your ears, next to his mumbling and that of someone else. When you look up again, peeling your eyes open, you see Michelle Jones with a rare startled look on her face mirroring Ned&rsquo;s surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; you hear her mumble, and then Peter&rsquo;s sitting up and blocking her from view. </p><p>His face has regained its color, now a bright red and his brows are bumped together in a mix of confusion and concern. You stand up at the same time, but when you stumble and he doesn&rsquo;t, he grabs your forearms to steady you. </p><p>His skin presses against yours, hard and soft and suddenly you find that you&rsquo;re feeling better, you feel like nothing ever happened at all, so you pull away from him and throw up a shield. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; his voice is low and timid. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Like you care</i>, you want to say. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you say instead, trying to ignore the way your stomach drops at the complete lack of <i>him</i>. Of his skin against yours, because you&rsquo;re not supposed to feel that at all. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah,&rdquo; he scratches the back of his neck, but his eyes are foggy and it almost seems like he&rsquo;s looking<i> through</i> you rather than at you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</p><p>A cough sounds behind him, and when you glance over your shoulder you see his friends, &nbsp;fidgeting nervously. Ned&rsquo;s face is twisted into pity and concern, but MJ is smirking devilishly. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, guys,&rdquo; Ned stutters weakly, scratching the back of his neck. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; Peter asks, his hand drifting to his ribs again, you wonder if that&rsquo;s where his tattoo hides. And then you find yourself wondering why he would be reaching for it at all. </p><p>MJ huffs out a laugh, then smothers it with her palm and shakes her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not gonna like it,&rdquo; she says. </p><p>&ldquo;Just say it,&rdquo; you press. Your hand begins to drift upwards automatically, searching for the bumpy mark on your neck, but when your fingers brush over the surface you find nothing but smooth skin. Your blood runs cold. </p><p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Ned swallows, visibly hesitant and MJ nudges his shoulder, prompting him to continue. &ldquo;I think you guys are soulmates.&rdquo; he finally says. It sounds forced and meek and he winces after the words clear the air. You think you might faint. </p><p>You <i>don&rsquo;t.</i></p><p>You want to scream and yell and curse at the sky, but when you open your mouth no words aid you. So Peter yells instead. &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i><b>Permanent Taglist:</b></i></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbIwCgwZCsLKX-9g8RncILA\">@signed-potato</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maWg3Y2rRoN4fJwBIHsAHpQ\">@awkwardnesshabitat</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXDwScBzojYIj4wWL9bs-lQ\">@spideyboipete</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjbIIN1EFUDHC-CU2k_g3sw\">@thelivvylovegood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@laureharrier</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ3r0EnrsVP4wrUmbjmBPEw\">@anxieteandbiscuits</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHzeUidPwl8Iq_VMWOIC4QA\">@ukulele-tea-and-ocean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh-yD4HHGZ0AYt4LzP_ZObg\">@lovely-</a>parker<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW_Ib2Bce52Migr7csRwWCg\">@veryspectacularspiderling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\">@sunshineandparker</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdr9j8nAQCXZH6kqXFVjyoQ\">@minnie-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF9vAkjL9o-1ksPHeivoD4A\">@imnotbitter-anna</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKuQ-_5GfUqjZej8sgK1wSQ\">@magic-marvel</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moE_3Ph0oXCxZzl1_Y1Ct1g\">@quxntumvandyne</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mql_a-LCJHBFAYRe-UTCQmA\">@lokiisragnarok</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU7AxU4LDHKQ63LVRL9RITA\">@highlady-ofthe-summercourt</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKwwd_5Dai95XE8150lF9xQ\">@secondsineternity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhdoiYECfwG9DcHLUSVbEBA\">@sadicallyrad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzUOhteLtgguhE--eKKQsg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzUOhteLtgguhE--eKKQsg\">@hedwigthelegend</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://h0tshotstark.tumblr.com/\">h0tshotstark</a></p><p><b><i>Incomplete Taglist:</i></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href=\"http://pastlives-purplesouls.tumblr.com/\">@pastlives-purplesouls</a> <a href=\"https://legendarydazekitten.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMZ-UcXbEUMdnnMPh6_8nxA\">@legendarydazekitten</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOcGv3OI79sACfWcjvghG9Q\">@appreciating-chase-brody</a>&nbsp;<strike>@eternal-l-appel-du-vide</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdYRrgT_TdrsecFYBevj3fA\">@tony-iron-man-stark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpwC4yJ3H6rexB0htawL84A\">@livinlifelikeishould</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj_68GA6gttpJvn9cpy5-tQ\">@spidreling</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miZmvK4aoXseNcG7ZVul7Ag\">@hollandhearts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jjhUSEjAE34RgHiiTj0dw\">@parrkerspeters</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mONGTzXpAeJ4nxV7taAwnCw\">@starlightfound</a> @<a href=\"https://msmith043003.tumblr.com/\">msmith043003</a> @<a href=\"http://holyhellthatbook.tumblr.com/\">holyhellthatbook</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUS0QH7Ym_s7_SzdM0M1ScA\">@someonekeepstakingmyusernames</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mONGTzXpAeJ4nxV7taAwnCw\">@starlightfound</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGkBTEErFhZU6AkxfsXu_GQ\">@random-writer06</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\">@a&ndash;1&ndash;1&ndash;3</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9PSwuP6wPdDJX6kR3btVKg\">@janglebell</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/modul5WLFykhJb21jTy9ryA\">@spider-mendes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml_cwiWEa6mou846wpZhH5Q\">@peterparker-glee-other</a></p><p><b><i><strike>strikethrough</strike> means i couldn&rsquo;t tag you &lt;3&nbsp;</i></b></p>",
