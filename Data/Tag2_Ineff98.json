It was awful hair,\nCrowley had always thought. It suited Aziraphale, that much was true, but it always\nhad a sickly air to it \u2013 curly in a limp sort of way, like pondweed hung up to\ndry. It <i>felt </i>nice, though. It was\nsoft, and pleasant, and he loved the way it fell over his fingers and his\npalms. \u201cAziraphale, I\u2019m <i>aching</i> for\nyou,\u201d Crowley purred, grinding his hips against Aziraphale\u2019s belly, letting his\ntongue flicker over the shell of his ear. \u201cI want you to <i>make love</i> to me, Aziraphale.

He grabbed Crowley by the back of his neck,\ndragging him hard to the side and out of his way of his book, and Crowley let\nout a surprised noise, his brow furrowing.</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>,\u201d\nhe said plaintively.</p><p>It was a big book, but Aziraphale didn\u2019t\nseem to have a problem with that: his plump hands were stronger than they\nlooked, and he turned the page easily with one thumb, letting it lean back\nagainst his fingers, the other hand resting against Crowley\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cAziraphale, <i>please</i>,\u201d Crowley said, and he started leaning to the side again,\nbut Aziraphale\u2019s hand slammed down <i>hard</i>\nagainst his arse, making a loud smack that <i>rang\nout</i> in the room, echoing off the bookshelves. Crowley whimpered, burying\nhis face in Aziraphale\u2019s neck and grabbing at his shoulders, and Aziraphale\u2019s\nhand grasped at the curve of Crowley\u2019s arse, squeezing tightly. Crowley\u2019s arse\nwasn\u2019t nearly so good as Aziraphale\u2019s, not by half: even if he <i>tried</i> to make his body a little softer,\nit favoured the natural muscle and thickness of a serpentine body.

It was black, and <i>tight</i>,\nand he had picked it up in town before driving back, had delighted the whole\ndrive in the idea of coming home and getting Aziraphale to take him to bed.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t accounted for Aziraphale being in\none of his <i>moods</i>, where he focused so\nentirely on a book the world could explode around him, and didn&rsquo;t take in\nanything else at all. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice, dear,&rdquo; the angel muttered tonelessly,\nobviously not hearing him. He turned a page.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel, make love to me,&rdquo; Crowley said,\nslowly walking forward, his bare feet padding soundlessly on the wooden boards until\nthey met the rug in Aziraphale&rsquo;s reading nook, and Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t look at\nhim, didn&rsquo;t even blink as his gaze flickering over the page. &ldquo;Angel, won&rsquo;t you <i>take</i> me? Won&rsquo;t you <i>know</i> me? Won&rsquo;t you&mdash; Oh, for Go&mdash; for <i>someone&rsquo;s</i> sake, Aziraphale, would you listen to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; Aziraphale said blandly. He\nturned another page.</p><p>Crowley gritted his teeth, and he leaned\nforward, sliding his hands onto Aziraphale&rsquo;s knees and leaning forward, his\nfingers drawing over Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs, his fingers pressing down on the fat,\npillowy flesh beneath the cream-coloured fabric of his trousers, his heart\nleaping at how <i>warm</i> he was, how soft&mdash;</p><p>Aziraphale leaned back slightly in his\nseat, and Crowley&rsquo;s heart jumped in his chest, but he was just slightly\nadjusting his position.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Aziraphale</i>,&rdquo;\nCrowley said plaintively. </p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Crowley clambered into the angel&rsquo;s lap,\nslinking forward with an inhumanly flexible spine and putting his head underneath\nAziraphale&rsquo;s arms where they came around to grasp at the book, sliding his\nnaked body up against the soft, yellow wool of Aziraphale&rsquo;s knitted vest,\nfeeling Aziraphale&rsquo;s <i>belly</i>, his\nchest, his thighs underneath Crowley&rsquo;s own.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Aziraphale</i>,&rdquo;\nCrowley whispered, putting his hands up against Aziraphale&rsquo;s cheeks and winding\nthem through the soft, downy white-blond of his hair. It was awful hair,\nCrowley had always thought. It suited Aziraphale, that much was true, but it always\nhad a sickly air to it &ndash; curly in a limp sort of way, like pondweed hung up to\ndry. It <i>felt </i>nice, though. It was\nsoft, and pleasant, and he loved the way it fell over his fingers and his\npalms. &ldquo;Aziraphale, I&rsquo;m <i>aching</i> for\nyou,&rdquo; Crowley purred, grinding his hips against Aziraphale&rsquo;s belly, letting his\ntongue flicker over the shell of his ear. &ldquo;I want you to <i>make love</i> to me, Aziraphale. I want you to <i>have</i> me, to <i>know</i> me: I\nwant for us to bind ourselves as one soul, to intermingle our essences\nirrevocably, to become one being altogether, drowned in love. Let my soul\nalongside yours, marry us together in our own little ceremony, angel, let me\nlove you, won&rsquo;t you love me?&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s elbow shifted against Crowley&rsquo;s\nback as he altered his hold, just slightly, on the book. </p><p>Crowley changed tact.</p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale,&rdquo; he said, dragging his teeth\nover the angel&rsquo;s pulse point, grasping at his hair, gripping it tight in his hand.\n&ldquo;Aziraphale, I need you to <i>fuck</i> me. I&rsquo;ll\ndie without you <i>inside</i> me, angel: I\nwant you to fuck me so hard I can&rsquo;t walk at the end of it, I want to feel your\ncock in me, fuck me fit to bursting, angel. I want to feel your come dripping\ndown my thighs and your mouth on my neck, want you to <i>ruin</i> me, rip me to shreds and leave me a mess once you&rsquo;re done with\nme.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale turned a page.</p><p>Crowley leaned his head to the side,\nblocking Aziraphale&rsquo;s view of his book, and Aziraphale&rsquo;s left hand moved so\nfast it made Crowley&rsquo;s head spin. He grabbed Crowley by the back of his neck,\ndragging him hard to the side and out of his way of his book, and Crowley let\nout a surprised noise, his brow furrowing.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Angel</i>,&rdquo;\nhe said plaintively.</p><p>It was a big book, but Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t\nseem to have a problem with that: his plump hands were stronger than they\nlooked, and he turned the page easily with one thumb, letting it lean back\nagainst his fingers, the other hand resting against Crowley&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale, <i>please</i>,&rdquo; Crowley said, and he started leaning to the side again,\nbut Aziraphale&rsquo;s hand slammed down <i>hard</i>\nagainst his arse, making a loud smack that <i>rang\nout</i> in the room, echoing off the bookshelves. Crowley whimpered, burying\nhis face in Aziraphale&rsquo;s neck and grabbing at his shoulders, and Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nhand grasped at the curve of Crowley&rsquo;s arse, squeezing tightly. Crowley&rsquo;s arse\nwasn&rsquo;t nearly so good as Aziraphale&rsquo;s, not by half: even if he <i>tried</i> to make his body a little softer,\nit favoured the natural muscle and thickness of a serpentine body. Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nbody was <i>good</i>. It was wonderful,\nthick, you could <i>sink</i> in it, and Crowley\nloved to fuck him, loved to grab handfuls of him&mdash;</p><p>Aziraphale <i>did</i> like Crowley&rsquo;s arse, Crowley knew that, but still, but <i>still. </i></p><p>With all the arse in the world, of course,\nthere was no distracting Aziraphale when he was reading. Even as he massaged\nCrowley&rsquo;s arse, his fingers dragging hard over the light padding over thick\nmuscle, his chin was settled on Crowley&rsquo;s shoulder, and Crowley could see his\neyes moving as he took in line after line of font-7 text.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s middle finger slid beneath the\nthin string at the back of the thong, and <i>tugged</i>,\nmaking it drag tight against him, and Crowley choked out a noise against the\nside of Aziraphale&rsquo;s neck. He was wet, he was open: he&rsquo;d made himself <i>ready</i>, had anticipated Aziraphale reading\nsome slim volume of verse that he&rsquo;d happily set aside, not&mdash;</p><p>Not <i>this</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t blink, didn&rsquo;t look away\nfrom his book, but he hooked his finger past the rim of Crowley&rsquo;s arsehole,\npressed hard on the muscle there and made Crowley&rsquo;s arousal twist in his belly.\nIt was&mdash; It was <i>sexy</i>, actually. He\nliked it, when Aziraphale was condescending and pretended he didn&rsquo;t care, when\nhe talked down to Crowley and put on his &ldquo;I know best, my dear,&rdquo; tone, acted\nlike Crowley was some pretty little idiot he could do whatever he liked to, but\nthis, this was&mdash;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t even paying <i>attention</i> to him, was sliding his finger into Crowley&rsquo;s arse and\nnot even looking up from his book, like he didn&rsquo;t even <i>care</i>, and Crowley&rsquo;s cock was hard in the lace fabric of the stupid\nlittle thong, pressed right up against the swell of Aziraphale&rsquo;s belly. </p><p>Aziraphale put another finger forward, pressing\ndown <i>hard</i> against Crowley&rsquo;s prostate,\nand Crowley yelped, his hips jumping: his cock thrust against the soft curve of\nAziraphale&rsquo;s gut, the lace a tantalising play against his prick, his cockhead,\nand he was <i>wet</i>, he <i>wanted</i>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck me,&rdquo; Crowley begged, his hips shifting\nforward, grinding against Aziraphale as Aziraphale scissored his fingers,\nstretching him wider, and Crowley hissed, his thighs spreading right apart. &ldquo;Aziraphale,\nangel, please, let me just get your cock out, let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale pressed down harder, too hard, <i>too hard</i>, and Crowley heaved in a\ndesperate gasp, his head tipping back as <i>fireworks</i>\nburst behind his eyes, and his fingers were tipped with claws as he grabbed at\nAziraphale&rsquo;s shoulders, his hips lurching. It was too intense, dragging right\ninto the core of him, and Aziraphale just wouldn&rsquo;t stopped, rubbed his fingers\nin a slow and deliberate circle as lightning crackled through him, and he choked,\nkeened&mdash;</p><p>Came.</p><p>His cock was pulsing, <i>ruining</i> the skimpy little thong, his bollocks drawn up tight, and Aziraphale\ndidn&rsquo;t stop, working away on autopilot: he was fucking Crowley with his fingers,\nletting Crowley ride his way through it, and then <i>past</i> it.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; Crowley mumbled, as Aziraphale\nshifted his wrist, twisting his fingers, and he heard the turn of a page. &ldquo;Aziraphale,\nyou can stop, you can stop&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p>And Crowley could have <i>stopped</i> him, could have climbed down, but&mdash;</p><p>But it was <i>sexy</i>.</p><p><b>&#9812; </b><b>&#9769; </b><b>&#9812; </b><b>&#9769; </b><b>&#9812; </b><b>&#9769; </b><b>&#9812;</b></p><p>Crowley stirred, later on, as Aziraphale\ntook him up in his arms, carrying him gently, bundled up against his chest. He&rsquo;d\ntaken off the thong, and washed Crowley off with a cloth: the sticky slickness\nwas gone from his cock and his arse, although his thighs ached, his stomach\nached, his arse <i>ached</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;You fell asleep,&rdquo; Aziraphale murmured,\npursing his lips together and looking forward instead of down at Crowley. He\nwas smug.</p><p>&ldquo;I fainted, you mean,&rdquo; Crowley complained,\nwithout real rancour. &ldquo;From exhaustion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dissolute and wanton thing,&rdquo; Aziraphale\nscolded. Crowley shivered: his cock gave the ghost of a twitch of interest.\nAziraphale laid him down on the bed, and he settled down on the bed beside him,\nhis clothes disappearing with a little <i>swish</i>\nof power, and Crowley was on top of him immediately, nuzzling the soft hair on\nAziraphale&rsquo;s chest, grasping eagerly at his belly.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t any less tired.</p><p>He meant to grumble and complain, meant to\nsay it was nasty and unfair, meant to say that he would very much like for\nAziraphale to do that again, possibly forever.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t do that.</p><p>He fell asleep. </p></p>",
