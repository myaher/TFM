Or that they were just assholes.\n</p><p>\n Probably they were assholes.\n</p><p>\n The day had started shitty, with the ambush by bugbears. None of\n them even had any idea why bugbears were around in this area, there \nwere no tribes that any one knew about. Of course, it probably didn&rsquo;t \nmatter any more, because the bugbears were very thoroughly murdered by \nthe time they got done with everything.\n</p><p>\n But it had been <i>very</i> ugly. Fjord and Molly had gotten chewed on a <i>lot</i> and had been knocked out briefly, Beau had the ever living shit\n beaten out of her, Yasha&rsquo;d nearly lost an arm, Caleb had been dropped a\n nerve wracking <i>three times</i>. Jester had pushed herself to the limit and had barely had time\n to smack things with her giant floating lollipop in between trying to \nkeep them all alive while Nott alternated covering her and pouring \nhealing potions into others when it looked like Jester wouldn&rsquo;t be able \nto get to two people at once. They&rsquo;d used up all but one.\n</p><p>\n But they&rsquo;d finally put the last one down, and everyone was more \nor less able to walk, and they&rsquo;d managed to get to a village with a \npassable inn. Caleb and Beau had immediately gone to go pass out while \nFjord and Molly stayed in the tavern downstairs. Yasha wasn&rsquo;t in \nevidence but as it was a clear day, she&rsquo;d probably be back by nightfall.\n Nott would have stayed to watch over Caleb, but the Itch was hitting \nher particularly bad all the sudden, and since it was the middle of the \nday and Fjord and Molly were there, Nott went with Jester when she said \nshe was going shopping.\n</p><p>\n Unfortunately, while Jester was able to find enough basic \nsupplies to restock their provisions, there weren&rsquo;t any health potions \nto be found. Which just figured, didn&rsquo;t it. One of these days, Nott \nreally needed to learn how to make those, if she could&hellip; But at least \nshe&rsquo;d managed to get a handful of shinies from grumpy people, enough to \nmake the Itch go away. Jester had even managed to find a bakery with \nsome pastries left.\n</p><p>\n So of course, of COURSE everything would go straight to shit.\n</p><p>\n Jester had been chattering about the drawings she was going to \nmake to the Traveler that night and wondering if the rooms were big \nenough for them to have a proper girls&rsquo; night and retelling her favorite\n chapter of Tusk Love, and Nott had been mostly listening, taking the \noccasional sip from her flask because it had really been a shitty day.\n</p><p>\n Neither of them had been paying attention, not even Nott who was\n usually super paranoid, because why would they expect trouble in a \nsmall village they&rsquo;d only been in for a couple of hours in the middle of\n the day?\n</p><p>\n The gods were <i>assholes</i>.\n</p><p>\n He&rsquo;d grabbed for Jester, getting a hand over her mouth before \nshe realized what was going on and pulling her into an alley. \u00a0He was a \ndirty half-elf in tattered clothes, and it could be assumed that he&rsquo;d \nseen her jewelry and her nice clothes and had figured she&rsquo;d have gold on\n her. He had a knife and had started to snarl something in her ear, but \nhe&rsquo;d neglected two things. One of them was that Jester was the hell of a\n lot stronger than she looked, and she&rsquo;d damn near wrenched his arm out \nof the socket and definitely <i>had</i> broken two of his ribs when she&rsquo;d torn free of his grip. The \nother thing he&rsquo;d neglected was Nott&rsquo;s presence, and as soon as the \nmomentary shock wore off, she&rsquo;d hissed something that sounded vaguely \nlike one of Caleb&rsquo;s spells and latched onto the man&rsquo;s leg. He&rsquo;d yelped \nin a very satisfying way at the Shocking Grasp, and then made the only \nsmart decision he had in some considerable time.\n</p><p>\n He booked it.\n</p><p>\n Jester laughed, and bent down to hug Nott. &ldquo;That was so \nawesome~! You were really fierce~! And he totally deserved to be zapped \nbecause he&rsquo;s a stinkydoodie~&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Then she went to straighten up and instead swayed and almost lost her balance. &ldquo;Jester! Are you okay?!&rdquo; Nott demanded shrilly.\n</p><p>\n Jester blinked for a moment, still swaying. &ldquo;I am aweso-&rdquo; She blinked again. &ldquo;Ah, Nott, you&rsquo;re bleeding, what happened?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Nott blinked too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bleeding, I haven&rsquo;t gotten hit at all\n today&hellip;&rdquo; In confusion, she looked down, and saw a bloody smear on her \ncloak near her shoulder. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not-&rdquo; Then it pinged, and she looked at\n Jester in alarm. There was a large patch of wet blood on Jester&rsquo;s \ndress, about level with her waist, and even as Nott watched, it grew, a \nspreading line of red soaking through the fabric of her bodice and into \nher skirt. &ldquo;Jester&hellip;&rdquo; Nott said, sounding slightly strangled.\n</p><p>\n Jester looked down. &ldquo;Ooh&hellip; that is a <i>lot</i> of blood.&rdquo; She braced one hand on the wall next to her. &ldquo;And \nnow that I think about it, it really, really hurts&hellip;&rdquo; She put one hand \nto her side to try to staunch the blood, and hissed involuntarily.\n</p><p>\n Nott realized that at some point in the mugger&rsquo;s flailings, he \nmust&rsquo;ve stabbed Jester. And the adrenaline rush meant she hadn&rsquo;t felt it\n at the time.&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; she demanded.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;Ooh, yeah, totally, I am so fine-&rdquo; Jester tried to stand up \nstraight, but her balance was all wrong and she ended up lurching into \nthe wall instead. &ldquo;Um&hellip; Maybe I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; She slid down the wall, ending \nup sitting on the ground a little more suddenly than she would have \nliked, if the Infernal hiss was any indication. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all wavy.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Nott grabbed her free hand in both of hers. Jester tended to run\n cold, but her hand was colder than normal, and a little clammy. &ldquo;Can \nyou heal it?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Jester shook her head briefly, then decided that was not a good idea. &ldquo;I used up all my spells <i>and</i> my pearl with the bugbears that were being total dicks earlier&hellip;&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n And their last potion was in one of Caleb&rsquo;s coat pockets back at the inn.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;Can you walk?&rdquo; Nott was way too small to even drag Jester, and her heart sank when the blue tiefling shook her head slightly.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;I mean, I probably technically should not technically.&rdquo; There \nwas a thickness in her voice that hadn&rsquo;t been there before. &ldquo;I think \nthat would only make me bleed faster.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d kept her hand pressed \nagainst the wound in her side, but Nott could see blood starting to slip\n around her fingers.\n</p><p>\n Nott wrung her hands together for a moment. She didn&rsquo;t want to \nleave Jester, especially since right now she was in no shape to defend \nherself if the mugger or anyone else who wanted to hurt her came along, \nbut without that healing potion-\n</p><p>\n She jerked the copper wire out of her pocket. &ldquo;Caleb! Jester&rsquo;s \nhurt, and we need the health potion! You can reply to this message!&rdquo; \nNott waited, but there was no response to the Message. He must&rsquo;ve still \nbeen asleep, Nott thought, so she tried again. &ldquo;Fjord! Jester&rsquo;s hurt, we\n need help, you can reply to this message!&rdquo; Nothing. She tried Molly and\n Beau with the same results, and cursed. The inn was too far away, they \nwere out of range.\n</p><p><i>The gods were assholes</i>.\n</p><p>\n Nott tried very hard not to panic, and checked on Jester again. \nHer breathing was a lot faster and shallower, and the blue of her skin \nseemed washed out. And it had happened so fast&hellip; &ldquo;Jester?&rdquo; She looked \nup at the goblin with difficulty. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to sleep, okay?&rdquo; Jester \nconsidered that for a moment, then hummed in an amicable way that \nsuggested she might not have quite processed it.\n</p><p>\n There was one more thing she could try before she&rsquo;d have to risk\n leaving Jester to run back to the inn. &ldquo;Yasha, can you hear me? \nJester&rsquo;s hurt and we really need some help. You can reply to this \nmessage.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n A moment passed and nothing happened. Then two.\n</p><p>\n Nott had almost given up and was already edging towards the \nmouth of the alley, looking to see if the coast was clear for her to \ndash out, when the response came.\n</p><p><i>&ldquo;I hear you. Where are you?&rdquo;</i>\n \u00a0\n</p><p>\n Nott almost cried with relief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in an alley near the \nmarketplace, there&rsquo;s, um, some sort of teahouse? Across the street? You \ncan reply to this message.&rdquo;\n</p><p><i>\u201cI&rsquo;m coming.&ldquo;\n </i>\u00a0\n</p><p>\n Nott nodded frantically, then darted back to Jester. She was \nstill technically conscious, at least, her eyes were open and she seemed\n to track Nott&rsquo;s movements, but her hand had gone slack against the \nwound in her side, so Nott used both hands to apply pressure to the \nwound. There was just so much blood, blood that should still be in \nJester&hellip;\n</p><p>\n It couldn&rsquo;t have been a minute later that a large shadow fell \nover both of them, and Nott jerked and looked up, baring her teeth and \nhissing reflexively. But it wasn&rsquo;t a threat at all, and Nott had never \nbeen happier to see someone so terrifyingly enormous.\n</p><p>\n Yasha knelt down next to Jester carefully, and gently placed a \nglowing hand against Jester&rsquo;s side. It wasn&rsquo;t the most impressive \nhealing that Nott had seen even that day, but right now, it was enough. \nJester sighed a little, eyes fluttering shut, and once she was sure that\n the bleeding had stopped, Yasha carefully picked her up.\n</p><p>\n &quot;Caleb has one more healing potion, if we need it&hellip;&rdquo; Nott said, anxiously chewing on one of her ragged claws.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see how she is when we get back,&rdquo; Yasha said, nodding. \nNott had to scramble to keep up with Yasha&rsquo;s stride, but she didn&rsquo;t \nmind; it was all to the better if they could get her to a proper bed \nwhere she could rest soon. And since Yasha was carrying Jester, the trip\n back wasn&rsquo;t nearly as long as it had been on the way out.\n</p><p>\n Predictably, as soon as they saw Jester in Yasha&rsquo;s arms, with \nNott trailing behind like a nervous little shadow, Fjord and Molly \nerupted, demanding to know what happened. Nott explained it briefly as \nYasha carried Jester upstairs to the girls&rsquo; shared room, that they had \nbeen mugged, and that the mugger had stabbed Jester in the ensuing fray.\n The two men exchanged a look, and Fjord started to ask what the mugger \nhad looked like. Given their expressions, Nott was pretty sure that they\n were about thirty seconds from tearing out after the man to explain, in\n fine detail, why attacking one of their own, particularly Jester, had \nbeen a <i>bad idea</i>. The fine details being swords and aggressively blasty magic.\n</p><p>\n But before they could, there was a startled yelp and a demand \nfor information upstairs, which suggested that Beau had woken up and \nseen the state Jester was in. That was immediately followed by something\n incoherent in Zemnian, indicating Caleb was awake too now. So the rest \nof them went up to the rooms to explain what had happened and check on \nJester.\n</p><p>\n Her color was better now, and her breathing was closer to \nnormal. Caleb and Beau were standing back from the bed a little as Yasha\n took a moment to brush the tiefling&rsquo;s hair out of her face. Beau looked\n angry, no surprise there, but Caleb just looked concerned and \nthoughtful. &ldquo;You healed her before, <i>ja?</i>&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Yasha nodded. &ldquo;A bit. Enough that she stopped bleeding.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Caleb nodded. &ldquo;I think she will be better in the morning, after \nsome sleep. She will have her spells back then, and can heal herself \nmore.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Yasha stood up. &ldquo;I can do&hellip; healing hands&hellip; again in the morning, if I need to.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;So she&rsquo;s gonna be alright, yeah?&rdquo; Beau demanded, raising an eyebrow.\n</p><p>\n Caleb nodded. &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Nott climbed up into the chair next to the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad&hellip;.\n we were too far away from the inn and I couldn&rsquo;t Message anyone. I was \nworried- I don&rsquo;t know how long it would have taken to get back to the \ninn&hellip; I&rsquo;m glad you were in range, Yasha.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Yasha blinked a little, and flushed the slightest bit. &ldquo;I&hellip; \nalmost wasn&rsquo;t. I was on the other side of the marketplace. I think that \nwould have been too far away too.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Molly patted her shoulder. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a good thing you decided to wander over~&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. Decide, I mean.&rdquo; Yasha shook her head. &ldquo;A man bumped \ninto me and lifted my pouch. I was trying to catch him. I lost him right\n before I got Nott&rsquo;s Message.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Nott blinked. &ldquo;But your pouch is on your belt, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Unless\n she had another pouch that Nott didn&rsquo;t know about, but she tended to \nnotice what people had on them.\n</p><p>\n Now it was Yasha&rsquo;s turn to blink, and she looked down, where sure enough, her pouch was exactly where it had been. &ldquo;Um.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n There was a long pause as everyone considered this. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d this man look like, Yasha?&rdquo; Fjord asked after a moment.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I never saw his face. Just a man in a green cloak.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n \u00a0Okay. Maybe <i>one</i> god&rsquo;s not an asshole.\n</p>",

Or that they were just assholes.\n</p><p>\n Probably they were assholes.\n</p><p>\n The day had started shitty, with the ambush by bugbears. None of\n them even had any idea why bugbears were around in this area, there \nwere no tribes that any one knew about. Of course, it probably didn\u2019t \nmatter any more, because the bugbears were very thoroughly murdered by \nthe time they got done with everything.\n</p><p>\n But it had been <i>very</i> ugly. Fjord and Molly had gotten chewed on a <i>lot</i> and had been knocked out briefly, Beau had the ever living shit\n beaten out of her, Yasha\u2019d nearly lost an arm, Caleb had been dropped a\n nerve wracking <i>three times</i>. Jester had pushed herself to the limit and had barely had time\n to smack things with her giant floating lollipop in between trying to \nkeep them all alive while Nott alternated covering her and pouring \nhealing potions into others when it looked like Jester wouldn\u2019t be able \nto get to two people at once. They\u2019d used up all but one.\n</p><p>\n But they\u2019d finally put the last one down, and everyone was more \nor less able to walk, and they\u2019d managed to get to a village with a \npassable inn. Caleb and Beau had immediately gone to go pass out while \nFjord and Molly stayed in the tavern downstairs. Yasha wasn\u2019t in \nevidence but as it was a clear day, she\u2019d probably be back by nightfall.\n Nott would have stayed to watch over Caleb, but the Itch was hitting \nher particularly bad all the sudden, and since it was the middle of the \nday and Fjord and Molly were there, Nott went with Jester when she said \nshe was going shopping.\n</p><p>\n Unfortunately, while Jester was able to find enough basic \nsupplies to restock their provisions, there weren\u2019t any health potions \nto be found. Which just figured, didn\u2019t it. One of these days, Nott \nreally needed to learn how to make those, if she could\u2026 But at least \nshe\u2019d managed to get a handful of shinies from grumpy people, enough to \nmake the Itch go away. Jester had even managed to find a bakery with \nsome pastries left.\n</p><p>\n So of course, of COURSE everything would go straight to shit.\n</p><p>\n Jester had been chattering about the drawings she was going to \nmake to the Traveler that night and wondering if the rooms were big \nenough for them to have a proper girls\u2019 night and retelling her favorite\n chapter of Tusk Love, and Nott had been mostly listening, taking the \noccasional sip from her flask because it had really been a shitty day.\n</p><p>\n Neither of them had been paying attention, not even Nott who was\n usually super paranoid, because why would they expect trouble in a \nsmall village they\u2019d only been in for a couple of hours in the middle of\n the day?\n</p><p>\n The gods were <i>assholes</i>.\n</p><p>\n He\u2019d grabbed for Jester, getting a hand over her mouth before \nshe realized what was going on and pulling her into an alley. \u00a0He was a \ndirty half-elf in tattered clothes, and it could be assumed that he\u2019d \nseen her jewelry and her nice clothes and had figured she\u2019d have gold on\n her. He had a knife and had started to snarl something in her ear, but \nhe\u2019d neglected two things. One of them was that Jester was the hell of a\n lot stronger than she looked, and she\u2019d damn near wrenched his arm out \nof the socket and definitely <i>had</i> broken two of his ribs when she\u2019d torn free of his grip. The \nother thing he\u2019d neglected was Nott\u2019s presence, and as soon as the \nmomentary shock wore off, she\u2019d hissed something that sounded vaguely \nlike one of Caleb\u2019s spells and latched onto the man\u2019s leg. He\u2019d yelped \nin a very satisfying way at the Shocking Grasp, and then made the only \nsmart decision he had in some considerable time.\n</p><p>\n He booked it.\n</p><p>\n Jester laughed, and bent down to hug Nott. \u201cThat was so \nawesome~! You were really fierce~! And he totally deserved to be zapped \nbecause he\u2019s a stinkydoodie~\u201d\n</p><p>\n Then she went to straighten up and instead swayed and almost lost her balance. \u201cJester! Are you okay?!\u201d Nott demanded shrilly.\n</p><p>\n Jester blinked for a moment, still swaying. \u201cI am aweso-\u201d She blinked again. \u201cAh, Nott, you\u2019re bleeding, what happened?\u201d\n</p><p>\n Nott blinked too. \u201cI\u2019m not bleeding, I haven\u2019t gotten hit at all\n today\u2026\u201d In confusion, she looked down, and saw a bloody smear on her \ncloak near her shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s not-\u201d Then it pinged, and she looked at\n Jester in alarm. There was a large patch of wet blood on Jester\u2019s \ndress, about level with her waist, and even as Nott watched, it grew, a \nspreading line of red soaking through the fabric of her bodice and into \nher skirt. \u201cJester\u2026\u201d Nott said, sounding slightly strangled.\n</p><p>\n Jester looked down. \u201cOoh\u2026 that is a <i>lot</i> of blood.\u201d She braced one hand on the wall next to her. \u201cAnd \nnow that I think about it, it really, really hurts\u2026\u201d She put one hand \nto her side to try to staunch the blood, and hissed involuntarily.\n</p><p>\n Nott realized that at some point in the mugger\u2019s flailings, he \nmust\u2019ve stabbed Jester. And the adrenaline rush meant she hadn\u2019t felt it\n at the time.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she demanded.\n</p><p>\n \u201cOoh, yeah, totally, I am so fine-\u201d Jester tried to stand up \nstraight, but her balance was all wrong and she ended up lurching into \nthe wall instead. \u201cUm\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m not.\u201d She slid down the wall, ending \nup sitting on the ground a little more suddenly than she would have \nliked, if the Infernal hiss was any indication. \u201cEverything\u2019s all wavy.\u201d\n</p><p>\n Nott grabbed her free hand in both of hers. Jester tended to run\n cold, but her hand was colder than normal, and a little clammy. \u201cCan \nyou heal it?\u201d\n</p><p>\n Jester shook her head briefly, then decided that was not a good idea. \u201cI used up all my spells <i>and</i> my pearl with the bugbears that were being total dicks earlier\u2026\u201d\n</p><p>\n And their last potion was in one of Caleb\u2019s coat pockets back at the inn.\n</p><p>\n \u201cCan you walk?\u201d Nott was way too small to even drag Jester, and her heart sank when the blue tiefling shook her head slightly.\n</p><p>\n \u201cI mean, I probably technically should not technically.\u201d There \nwas a thickness in her voice that hadn\u2019t been there before. \u201cI think \nthat would only make me bleed faster.\u201d She\u2019d kept her hand pressed \nagainst the wound in her side, but Nott could see blood starting to slip\n around her fingers.\n</p><p>\n Nott wrung her hands together for a moment. She didn\u2019t want to \nleave Jester, especially since right now she was in no shape to defend \nherself if the mugger or anyone else who wanted to hurt her came along, \nbut without that healing potion-\n</p><p>\n She jerked the copper wire out of her pocket. \u201cCaleb! Jester\u2019s \nhurt, and we need the health potion! You can reply to this message!\u201d \nNott waited, but there was no response to the Message. He must\u2019ve still \nbeen asleep, Nott thought, so she tried again. \u201cFjord! Jester\u2019s hurt, we\n need help, you can reply to this message!\u201d Nothing. She tried Molly and\n Beau with the same results, and cursed. The inn was too far away, they \nwere out of range.\n</p><p><i>The gods were assholes</i>.\n</p><p>\n Nott tried very hard not to panic, and checked on Jester again. \nHer breathing was a lot faster and shallower, and the blue of her skin \nseemed washed out. And it had happened so fast\u2026 \u201cJester?\u201d She looked \nup at the goblin with difficulty. \u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep, okay?\u201d Jester \nconsidered that for a moment, then hummed in an amicable way that \nsuggested she might not have quite processed it.\n</p><p>\n There was one more thing she could try before she\u2019d have to risk\n leaving Jester to run back to the inn. \u201cYasha, can you hear me? \nJester\u2019s hurt and we really need some help. You can reply to this \nmessage.\u201d\n</p><p>\n A moment passed and nothing happened.

Or that they were just assholes.\n</p><p>\n Probably they were assholes.\n</p><p>\n The day had started shitty, with the ambush by bugbears. None of\n them even had any idea why bugbears were around in this area, there \nwere no tribes that any one knew about. Of course, it probably didn&rsquo;t \nmatter any more, because the bugbears were very thoroughly murdered by \nthe time they got done with everything.\n</p><p>\n But it had been <i>very</i> ugly. Fjord and Molly had gotten chewed on a <i>lot</i> and had been knocked out briefly, Beau had the ever living shit\n beaten out of her, Yasha&rsquo;d nearly lost an arm, Caleb had been dropped a\n nerve wracking <i>three times</i>. Jester had pushed herself to the limit and had barely had time\n to smack things with her giant floating lollipop in between trying to \nkeep them all alive while Nott alternated covering her and pouring \nhealing potions into others when it looked like Jester wouldn&rsquo;t be able \nto get to two people at once. They&rsquo;d used up all but one.\n</p><p>\n But they&rsquo;d finally put the last one down, and everyone was more \nor less able to walk, and they&rsquo;d managed to get to a village with a \npassable inn. Caleb and Beau had immediately gone to go pass out while \nFjord and Molly stayed in the tavern downstairs. Yasha wasn&rsquo;t in \nevidence but as it was a clear day, she&rsquo;d probably be back by nightfall.\n Nott would have stayed to watch over Caleb, but the Itch was hitting \nher particularly bad all the sudden, and since it was the middle of the \nday and Fjord and Molly were there, Nott went with Jester when she said \nshe was going shopping.\n</p><p>\n Unfortunately, while Jester was able to find enough basic \nsupplies to restock their provisions, there weren&rsquo;t any health potions \nto be found. Which just figured, didn&rsquo;t it. One of these days, Nott \nreally needed to learn how to make those, if she could&hellip; But at least \nshe&rsquo;d managed to get a handful of shinies from grumpy people, enough to \nmake the Itch go away. Jester had even managed to find a bakery with \nsome pastries left.\n</p><p>\n So of course, of COURSE everything would go straight to shit.\n</p><p>\n Jester had been chattering about the drawings she was going to \nmake to the Traveler that night and wondering if the rooms were big \nenough for them to have a proper girls&rsquo; night and retelling her favorite\n chapter of Tusk Love, and Nott had been mostly listening, taking the \noccasional sip from her flask because it had really been a shitty day.\n</p><p>\n Neither of them had been paying attention, not even Nott who was\n usually super paranoid, because why would they expect trouble in a \nsmall village they&rsquo;d only been in for a couple of hours in the middle of\n the day?\n</p><p>\n The gods were <i>assholes</i>.\n</p><p>\n He&rsquo;d grabbed for Jester, getting a hand over her mouth before \nshe realized what was going on and pulling her into an alley. &nbsp;He was a \ndirty half-elf in tattered clothes, and it could be assumed that he&rsquo;d \nseen her jewelry and her nice clothes and had figured she&rsquo;d have gold on\n her. He had a knife and had started to snarl something in her ear, but \nhe&rsquo;d neglected two things. One of them was that Jester was the hell of a\n lot stronger than she looked, and she&rsquo;d damn near wrenched his arm out \nof the socket and definitely <i>had</i> broken two of his ribs when she&rsquo;d torn free of his grip. The \nother thing he&rsquo;d neglected was Nott&rsquo;s presence, and as soon as the \nmomentary shock wore off, she&rsquo;d hissed something that sounded vaguely \nlike one of Caleb&rsquo;s spells and latched onto the man&rsquo;s leg. He&rsquo;d yelped \nin a very satisfying way at the Shocking Grasp, and then made the only \nsmart decision he had in some considerable time.\n</p><p>\n He booked it.\n</p><p>\n Jester laughed, and bent down to hug Nott. &ldquo;That was so \nawesome~! You were really fierce~! And he totally deserved to be zapped \nbecause he&rsquo;s a stinkydoodie~&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Then she went to straighten up and instead swayed and almost lost her balance. &ldquo;Jester! Are you okay?!&rdquo; Nott demanded shrilly.\n</p><p>\n Jester blinked for a moment, still swaying. &ldquo;I am aweso-&rdquo; She blinked again. &ldquo;Ah, Nott, you&rsquo;re bleeding, what happened?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Nott blinked too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bleeding, I haven&rsquo;t gotten hit at all\n today&hellip;&rdquo; In confusion, she looked down, and saw a bloody smear on her \ncloak near her shoulder. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not-&rdquo; Then it pinged, and she looked at\n Jester in alarm. There was a large patch of wet blood on Jester&rsquo;s \ndress, about level with her waist, and even as Nott watched, it grew, a \nspreading line of red soaking through the fabric of her bodice and into \nher skirt. &ldquo;Jester&hellip;&rdquo; Nott said, sounding slightly strangled.\n</p><p>\n Jester looked down. &ldquo;Ooh&hellip; that is a <i>lot</i> of blood.&rdquo; She braced one hand on the wall next to her. &ldquo;And \nnow that I think about it, it really, really hurts&hellip;&rdquo; She put one hand \nto her side to try to staunch the blood, and hissed involuntarily.\n</p><p>\n Nott realized that at some point in the mugger&rsquo;s flailings, he \nmust&rsquo;ve stabbed Jester. And the adrenaline rush meant she hadn&rsquo;t felt it\n at the time.&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; she demanded.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;Ooh, yeah, totally, I am so fine-&rdquo; Jester tried to stand up \nstraight, but her balance was all wrong and she ended up lurching into \nthe wall instead. &ldquo;Um&hellip; Maybe I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; She slid down the wall, ending \nup sitting on the ground a little more suddenly than she would have \nliked, if the Infernal hiss was any indication. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all wavy.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Nott grabbed her free hand in both of hers. Jester tended to run\n cold, but her hand was colder than normal, and a little clammy. &ldquo;Can \nyou heal it?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Jester shook her head briefly, then decided that was not a good idea. &ldquo;I used up all my spells <i>and</i> my pearl with the bugbears that were being total dicks earlier&hellip;&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n And their last potion was in one of Caleb&rsquo;s coat pockets back at the inn.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;Can you walk?&rdquo; Nott was way too small to even drag Jester, and her heart sank when the blue tiefling shook her head slightly.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;I mean, I probably technically should not technically.&rdquo; There \nwas a thickness in her voice that hadn&rsquo;t been there before. &ldquo;I think \nthat would only make me bleed faster.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d kept her hand pressed \nagainst the wound in her side, but Nott could see blood starting to slip\n around her fingers.\n</p><p>\n Nott wrung her hands together for a moment. She didn&rsquo;t want to \nleave Jester, especially since right now she was in no shape to defend \nherself if the mugger or anyone else who wanted to hurt her came along, \nbut without that healing potion-\n</p><p>\n She jerked the copper wire out of her pocket. &ldquo;Caleb! Jester&rsquo;s \nhurt, and we need the health potion! You can reply to this message!&rdquo; \nNott waited, but there was no response to the Message. He must&rsquo;ve still \nbeen asleep, Nott thought, so she tried again. &ldquo;Fjord! Jester&rsquo;s hurt, we\n need help, you can reply to this message!&rdquo; Nothing. She tried Molly and\n Beau with the same results, and cursed. The inn was too far away, they \nwere out of range.\n</p><p><i>The gods were assholes</i>.\n</p><p>\n Nott tried very hard not to panic, and checked on Jester again. \nHer breathing was a lot faster and shallower, and the blue of her skin \nseemed washed out. And it had happened so fast&hellip; &ldquo;Jester?&rdquo; She looked \nup at the goblin with difficulty. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to sleep, okay?&rdquo; Jester \nconsidered that for a moment, then hummed in an amicable way that \nsuggested she might not have quite processed it.\n</p><p>\n There was one more thing she could try before she&rsquo;d have to risk\n leaving Jester to run back to the inn. &ldquo;Yasha, can you hear me? \nJester&rsquo;s hurt and we really need some help. You can reply to this \nmessage.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n A moment passed and nothing happened. Then two.\n</p><p>\n Nott had almost given up and was already edging towards the \nmouth of the alley, looking to see if the coast was clear for her to \ndash out, when the response came.\n</p><p><i>&ldquo;I hear you. Where are you?&rdquo;</i>\n &nbsp;\n</p><p>\n Nott almost cried with relief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in an alley near the \nmarketplace, there&rsquo;s, um, some sort of teahouse? Across the street? You \ncan reply to this message.&rdquo;\n</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming.&ldquo;\n </i>&nbsp;\n</p><p>\n Nott nodded frantically, then darted back to Jester. She was \nstill technically conscious, at least, her eyes were open and she seemed\n to track Nott&rsquo;s movements, but her hand had gone slack against the \nwound in her side, so Nott used both hands to apply pressure to the \nwound. There was just so much blood, blood that should still be in \nJester&hellip;\n</p><p>\n It couldn&rsquo;t have been a minute later that a large shadow fell \nover both of them, and Nott jerked and looked up, baring her teeth and \nhissing reflexively. But it wasn&rsquo;t a threat at all, and Nott had never \nbeen happier to see someone so terrifyingly enormous.\n</p><p>\n Yasha knelt down next to Jester carefully, and gently placed a \nglowing hand against Jester&rsquo;s side. It wasn&rsquo;t the most impressive \nhealing that Nott had seen even that day, but right now, it was enough. \nJester sighed a little, eyes fluttering shut, and once she was sure that\n the bleeding had stopped, Yasha carefully picked her up.\n</p><p>\n \"Caleb has one more healing potion, if we need it&hellip;&rdquo; Nott said, anxiously chewing on one of her ragged claws.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see how she is when we get back,&rdquo; Yasha said, nodding. \nNott had to scramble to keep up with Yasha&rsquo;s stride, but she didn&rsquo;t \nmind; it was all to the better if they could get her to a proper bed \nwhere she could rest soon. And since Yasha was carrying Jester, the trip\n back wasn&rsquo;t nearly as long as it had been on the way out.\n</p><p>\n Predictably, as soon as they saw Jester in Yasha&rsquo;s arms, with \nNott trailing behind like a nervous little shadow, Fjord and Molly \nerupted, demanding to know what happened. Nott explained it briefly as \nYasha carried Jester upstairs to the girls&rsquo; shared room, that they had \nbeen mugged, and that the mugger had stabbed Jester in the ensuing fray.\n The two men exchanged a look, and Fjord started to ask what the mugger \nhad looked like. Given their expressions, Nott was pretty sure that they\n were about thirty seconds from tearing out after the man to explain, in\n fine detail, why attacking one of their own, particularly Jester, had \nbeen a <i>bad idea</i>. The fine details being swords and aggressively blasty magic.\n</p><p>\n But before they could, there was a startled yelp and a demand \nfor information upstairs, which suggested that Beau had woken up and \nseen the state Jester was in. That was immediately followed by something\n incoherent in Zemnian, indicating Caleb was awake too now. So the rest \nof them went up to the rooms to explain what had happened and check on \nJester.\n</p><p>\n Her color was better now, and her breathing was closer to \nnormal. Caleb and Beau were standing back from the bed a little as Yasha\n took a moment to brush the tiefling&rsquo;s hair out of her face. Beau looked\n angry, no surprise there, but Caleb just looked concerned and \nthoughtful. &ldquo;You healed her before, <i>ja?</i>&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Yasha nodded. &ldquo;A bit. Enough that she stopped bleeding.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Caleb nodded. &ldquo;I think she will be better in the morning, after \nsome sleep. She will have her spells back then, and can heal herself \nmore.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Yasha stood up. &ldquo;I can do&hellip; healing hands&hellip; again in the morning, if I need to.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;So she&rsquo;s gonna be alright, yeah?&rdquo; Beau demanded, raising an eyebrow.\n</p><p>\n Caleb nodded. &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Nott climbed up into the chair next to the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad&hellip;.\n we were too far away from the inn and I couldn&rsquo;t Message anyone. I was \nworried- I don&rsquo;t know how long it would have taken to get back to the \ninn&hellip; I&rsquo;m glad you were in range, Yasha.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Yasha blinked a little, and flushed the slightest bit. &ldquo;I&hellip; \nalmost wasn&rsquo;t. I was on the other side of the marketplace. I think that \nwould have been too far away too.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Molly patted her shoulder. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a good thing you decided to wander over~&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. Decide, I mean.&rdquo; Yasha shook her head. &ldquo;A man bumped \ninto me and lifted my pouch. I was trying to catch him. I lost him right\n before I got Nott&rsquo;s Message.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n Nott blinked. &ldquo;But your pouch is on your belt, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Unless\n she had another pouch that Nott didn&rsquo;t know about, but she tended to \nnotice what people had on them.\n</p><p>\n Now it was Yasha&rsquo;s turn to blink, and she looked down, where sure enough, her pouch was exactly where it had been. &ldquo;Um.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n There was a long pause as everyone considered this. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d this man look like, Yasha?&rdquo; Fjord asked after a moment.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I never saw his face. Just a man in a green cloak.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n &nbsp;Okay. Maybe <i>one</i> god&rsquo;s not an asshole.\n</p>",
