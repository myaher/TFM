He opened his eyes and saw Lucas sleeping on him with his hair going into every direction. He looked so beautiful like this, just so peaceful like he didn\u2019t have any worries. Eliott almost gave into the instinct to get up and draw him. But then he would have to move away from him. And that he just physically couldn\u2019t do. </p><p>He let out a sigh and moved his eyes over Lucas\u2019 face again. To his slightly parted lips. They made Eliott think of last night. These lips touched his own. The memories came back and he started smiling like an idiot. He still couldn\u2019t believe Lucas, the most wonderful boy he\u2019s ever known, left Chlo\u00e9 without a thought and actually let Eliott kiss him. He wonders where he got the courage from. </p><p>But now thinking about it. Lucas was like a magnet. Trying to pull him close with such a force. He tried to resist it first, but when he looked into Lucas\u2019 eyes yesterday. There was something. The way he looked at him like he really knew him. At that moment Eliott knew it was hopeless to resist any longer. He had already fallen hard for this boy.</p><p>Eliott\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by Lucas slowly moving away. He looked down and saw those beautiful blue eyes, he had just been thinking about, looking right at him. \u201cBonjour\u201d Lucas said with a sleepy voice that was more than enough to make Eliott pull him back into him. Lucas started giggling at that but moved his arm around him to hold the older boy.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get breakfast?\u201d Eliott asked. Lucas answered with a simple \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d They were lying there in comfortable silence for a while until Lucas moved his chin up not being able to resist any longer and kissed him. Eliott melted into the kiss. Never could he get enough of kissing Lucas, kissing his soft lips. Felling his small body against his own. Lucas\u2019 hands in his hair. It was magic. And now what he was dreaming about since he first bumped into him was actually happening. He couldn\u2019t believe his luck.</p><p>Lucas pulled away slowly and asked him with a soft voice \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d \u201cBetter than ever\u201d Eliott replied \u201cBut I have to say it was a little <i>chelou</i> having someone drooling on my chest\u201d he added teasingly. Lucas hit him his arm playfully \u201cHeyyyy I did not do that.\u201d But he was smiling.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. But it doesn\u2019t matter because you looked beautiful while doing it.\u201d</p><p>Lucas started blushing after that and Eliott couldn\u2019t help but feel proud of how much he affected him with a single compliment. </p><p>\u201cOh, did I now?\u201d Lucas responded after he pulled himself together a little.</p><p>Eliott smiled at that, even though Lucas was blushing like an idiot he still managed to be his sassy self. \u201cSo beautiful I wanted to draw you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas perked up and looked at him surprised \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want to wake you up\u201d he answered and gave Lucas a small peck on the lips. \u201cYou can do it now if you want, you owe me a drawing anyway.\u201d Eliott remembered. Of course, he did, he remembered everything with Lucas. \u201cShould I draw you as an animal then or what?\u201d</p><p>He said with a fond on his face. Lucas started giggling at that and oh god it was like an angel singing to Eliott. He would never get tired of this sound.</p><p>\u201cI have something in mind\u201d Lucas responded still smiling but trying to look flirty. \u201dGo get your stuff!\u201d he added excitedly. Eliott didn\u2019t have to be told twice. He got up and went to get his sketch book and some pens on his desk. When he came back, he saw Lucas lying on the bed shirtless, and his mouth fell open. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen anyone more beautiful than the boy in front of him.</p><p>\u201cDraw me like one of your French girls\u201d Lucas said but not without letting out a giggle. Eliott shook is hand with a smile on his face. He couldn\u2019t believe this boy. But even more he couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d chosen him to share his time with. And his kisses. They were very important too.</p>",

Eliott melted into the kiss. Never could he get enough of kissing Lucas, kissing his soft lips. Felling his small body against his own. Lucas\u2019 hands in his hair. It was magic.

Of course, he did, he remembered everything with Lucas. \u201cShould I draw you as an animal then or what?\u201d</p><p>He said with a fond on his face.

Eliott didn\u2019t have to be told twice. He got up and went to get his sketch book and some pens on his desk. When he came back, he saw Lucas lying on the bed shirtless, and his mouth fell open. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen anyone more beautiful than the boy in front of him.</p><p>\u201cDraw me like one of your French girls\u201d Lucas said but not without letting out a giggle. Eliott shook is hand with a smile on his face. He couldn\u2019t believe this boy. But even more he couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d chosen him to share his time with. And his kisses.

He bumped against him and didn\u2019t even flinched, just continued excitedly chatting with his friends. Eliott really wanted to know what they were talking about. After that he occasionally saw Lucas in school, on the hallways or when changing classrooms, nothing worth mentioning though.</p><p>The second time Eliott sees him, he wasn\u2019t expecting it at all. When he heard a group of second year\u2019s were going to fix the common room he got excited, it was a good opportunity to make new friends. But when he saw, sitting on one of the front chairs, the boy he got curious about, he was surprised. Then he noticed Lucas looking at him and he smiled. They saw each other again a few hours later at the bus stop. Smoked, talked, <i>weird</i>, <i>weird</i>, <i>weird</i>. He liked Lucas. He thinks Lucas also liked him. Chlo\u00e8 came, they didn\u2019t talk anymore.</p><p>The third time it\u2019s a week later, again at the bus stop. This time Eliott invites him to his house. Lucas asks him what animal Eliott would draw him as. Eliott lies,\u00a0\u201c<i>I don\u2019t know</i>\u201d, he says. He does, he has been drawing him since he saw him for the first time, but of course he doesn\u2019t say it, it\u2019d be weird. They spend all afternoon chatting. Eliott is happy, he puts some dubstep and dances away. He feels free. But as always, Lucas is full of surprises.
