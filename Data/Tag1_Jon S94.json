Also: Yes, I know Jon Snow is Lyanna\u2019s son and Ned Stark died faithful to Catelyn but it is important to remember that Catelyn does not know that as no one told her.*</b></p><p>I always see hate towards Catelyn for being less than welcoming towards Jon. It should be remembered that she was told he was Ned Stark bastards, meaning he cheated on her. Imagine if your significant other cheated on you; would you not be angry? Now imagine that your s.o. is well renowned\u00a0for being the most honorable and rule-following person as they cheated on you. Would that not make you feel so insignificant? That this man who you got on with well enough in the little time you have been married to, would not let others undress you during the wedding because he already\u00a0liked you/looking out for your well being, criticized King Robert for condoning war crimes, broke the promise of marriage to be with someone else. That alone would hurt. Now, what if you are married to your s.o. and they brought home a baby from another woman that you did not know? Would you welcome that child with open arms like your own as he is the reminder that this honorable man, your husband, was with another woman? Catelyn could not even send Jon away, which means that Ned Stark, her husband, favored Jon (and, henceforth, his mother) over her, his wife and mother of his legitimate\u00a0child and heir as he denied her wishes. This can also be dangerous since Jon is so close in age to Rob that he could try to be the heir, much like the whole Blackfyre rebellion.</p><p>Catelyn not being motherly towards Jon was hurtful towards him growing up, I will admit that. Knowing someone constantly did not want you around hurts. Remember, though, other women react worse than Catelyn in response to bastards. Cersei insinuated to Robert that Mya Stone would die if she came to Kings Landing to be raised and kills the baby Barra along with her mother. So Catelyn\u2019s silent treatment seems far better than murder since Jon Snow survived his childhood. Catelyn did maintain humanity towards Jon as she prayed that he would not die of pox, even making a prayer wheel for him. It can be argued that earlier she prayed for his death, but Catelyn does recognize that Jon was no more than an innocent child that was on the receiving\u00a0end of her jealousy of his mother. Even when she returns to ignoring Jon after the pox she knows she is being cruel to an already unfortunate boy, \u201ca motherless child\u201d.</p><p><b>In short: If someone cheated on you, you would dump them immediately. Catelyn is unable to do that, so yes, there is tension. She is undoubtedly unhappy that Jon is being raised along with her sons and chooses to ignore him, yet is still sympathetic towards him as she prays for his recovery of the pox and knows that her anger towards him is unjust.</b></p>",
