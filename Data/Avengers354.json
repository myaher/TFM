It didn&rsquo;t feel real.</p><p>They had a big, well-stocked Kitchen, multiple bathrooms, a games room, a giant Home Theatre. A Gym, a swimming pool, enormous state of the art training centre, the bedrooms, and a bunch of other rooms Wanda hadn&rsquo;t looked at yet. Anything else they wanted or needed, they only had to ask.</p><p>Sam Wilson would stay a few days at a time, and Natasha would often crash there after a mission. Captain Rogers and Col. Rhodes were busy men, flitting in and out of the place as they were needed. Stark would drop by for security checks now and then, and Ms. Potts would pop in to ask if they needed anything, but Wanda and the Vision were, at this stage, the only full-time residents of the compound.</p><p>The android had kept to himself so far, supposedly to allow Wanda to settle in, only stepping in when she had forgotten her way to the nearest bathroom.</p><p>Yet with her powers, Wanda could always feel The Vision&rsquo;s presence. The constant, steady hum of his artificial mind. Sparks of interest, curiosity, a desire to learn. Something that might have been happiness.</p><p>It was nice, she supposed. Knowing she wasn&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>There were a great many horrors in Wanda Maximoff&rsquo;s past.</p><p>The loss of her parents.</p><p>The orphanages and foster homes she and Pietro had been endlessly bounced between for the remainder of their childhood.</p><p>Strucker&rsquo;s experiments. Being torn apart and put back together so many times she lost count.</p><p>Pietro&rsquo;s death.</p><p>When Wanda was awake, she could usually keep her feelings about these things in check, her powers under control.</p><p>But if they came to her when she was asleep..</p><p>Wanda woke with a blood curdling scream. Red energy flooded the room, lashing at the walls untamed.</p><p>Before she could try to pull it back, The Vision was phasing through her wall, cape fluttering behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Maximoff? What&rsquo;s..&rdquo; The android was cut off, dodging a tendril of red energy.</p><p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; Wanda cried, more panicked than angry.</p><p>&ldquo;But..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Out!&rdquo;</p><p>The Vision, looking concerned, nevertheless did as she asked.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Wanda took a few minutes to calm herself, waiting for the red energy to recede back within her, then slipped an a robe and padded downstairs.</p><p>The Vision was in the kitchen, waiting for a kettle to boil.</p><p>&ldquo;Tea, Miss Maximoff?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Uh.. yes please.</p><p>&quot;How do you take it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Milk and two sugars.&rdquo; Once the water had boiled, Vision prepared the tea and handed it to her.

It just sounded like you were in distress..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, Vision&rdquo; Wanda sighed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t always control my powers when I have a nightmare like that. I could have hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>The corners of the android&rsquo;s mouth tugged upwards in a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not easily breakable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still.. what I can do.. it&rsquo;s dangerous. Pietro would always knock on my door. It snapped me back to the real world, gave me a chance to reign everything in. Then he&rsquo;d run in and comfort me when it was safe. So if that happens again, knock first, okay?&rdquo; Then, realising Vision was still learning, well, everything about being human, she added &ldquo;In fact, that&rsquo;s a general rule. Always knock before you enter someone else&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for the advice, Miss Maximoff. I will be sure to remember it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can call me Wanda, you know. If living together doesn&rsquo;t put us on a first name basis, what will?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.. Wanda.&rdquo; Vision returned to the chair where he had earlier been reading, cracking open his book once again.</p><p>Wanda took another seat nearby. Sipping her tea.

Wanda?</p><p>&quot;You were at my brother&rsquo;s funeral.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo; Vision confirmed.</p><p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t stand with the other Avengers..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He closed his book, as Wanda drained the last of her tea. &ldquo;After Ultron.. the media has shown quite a lot of interest in me.

Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to thank me for that. It was the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I do.&rdquo; She stood, and moved to press a kiss to the android&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;Thank you. And thank you for the tea.&rdquo; Wanda yawned. &ldquo;I might head back to bed. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Wanda.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>After she had left, Vision tried to return to his book.

Knowing she wasn&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>There were a great many horrors in Wanda Maximoff&rsquo;s past.</p><p>The loss of her parents.</p><p>The orphanages and foster homes she and Pietro had been endlessly bounced between for the remainder of their childhood.</p><p>Strucker&rsquo;s experiments. Being torn apart and put back together so many times she lost count.</p><p>Pietro&rsquo;s death.</p><p>When Wanda was awake, she could usually keep her feelings about these things in check, her powers under control.</p><p>But if they came to her when she was asleep..</p><p>Wanda woke with a blood curdling scream. Red energy flooded the room, lashing at the walls untamed.</p><p>Before she could try to pull it back, The Vision was phasing through her wall, cape fluttering behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Maximoff? What&rsquo;s..&rdquo; The android was cut off, dodging a tendril of red energy.</p><p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; Wanda cried, more panicked than angry.</p><p>&ldquo;But..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Out!&rdquo;</p><p>The Vision, looking concerned, nevertheless did as she asked.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Wanda took a few minutes to calm herself, waiting for the red energy to recede back within her, then slipped an a robe and padded downstairs.</p><p>The Vision was in the kitchen, waiting for a kettle to boil.</p><p>&ldquo;Tea, Miss Maximoff?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Uh.. yes please.</p><p>\"How do you take it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Milk and two sugars.&rdquo; Once the water had boiled, Vision prepared the tea and handed it to her. Wanda took a sip, relaxing some more. &ldquo;Thank you. About before.. up there..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry if I did something wrong, Miss Maximoff. It just sounded like you were in distress..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, Vision&rdquo; Wanda sighed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t always control my powers when I have a nightmare like that. I could have hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>The corners of the android&rsquo;s mouth tugged upwards in a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not easily breakable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still.. what I can do.. it&rsquo;s dangerous. Pietro would always knock on my door. It snapped me back to the real world, gave me a chance to reign everything in. Then he&rsquo;d run in and comfort me when it was safe. So if that happens again, knock first, okay?&rdquo; Then, realising Vision was still learning, well, everything about being human, she added &ldquo;In fact, that&rsquo;s a general rule. Always knock before you enter someone else&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for the advice, Miss Maximoff. I will be sure to remember it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can call me Wanda, you know. If living together doesn&rsquo;t put us on a first name basis, what will?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.. Wanda.&rdquo; Vision returned to the chair where he had earlier been reading, cracking open his book once again.</p><p>Wanda took another seat nearby. Sipping her tea. Watching him, though she was not entirely sure why.</p><p>The Vision found it rather.. distracting.</p><p>&ldquo;Was there something else you wanted to say, Miss.. Wanda?</p><p>\"You were at my brother&rsquo;s funeral.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo; Vision confirmed.</p><p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t stand with the other Avengers..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He closed his book, as Wanda drained the last of her tea. &ldquo;After Ultron.. the media has shown quite a lot of interest in me. What I am, how I work. I wanted to pay my respects, but I didn&rsquo;t wish to distract from what the day was supposed to be about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to thank me for that. It was the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I do.&rdquo; She stood, and moved to press a kiss to the android&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;Thank you. And thank you for the tea.&rdquo; Wanda yawned. &ldquo;I might head back to bed. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Wanda.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>After she had left, Vision tried to return to his book. Unfortunately, he was distracted by a strange tingling sensation where Wanda had kissed him.</p><p>Probably just a misfiring circuit. He&rsquo;d ask Tony to have a look next time he dropped by.</p>",
