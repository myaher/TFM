Because hell is right to say something is wrong with heaven, and Crowley knows it, but that Satan fellow seems like a right bonehead, and does he really want to get himself involved in this mess? So he never truly takes a stance with hell, neither quite faces the ugliness of either option, but when the lines are drawn he just sort of finds himself a bit more on the side of hell, without ever having admitted to himself that he\u2019d made up his mind.</p><p>Similarly, when he meets Aziraphale he sort of knows right away that he likes this angel and wants to spend time with him, but for all he knows this is heaven playing a trick on him, or just a bit of lingering nostalgia for his old life, and anyhow Aziraphale made it clear that he is on the side of Good and believes that Crowley can only be Bad, so that\u2019s that. But they keep spending time with one another regardless, and Crowley is sort of aware that he\u2019s doing it on purpose, that he likes doing it, but whenever he comes close to really admitting the significance of that he spirals into a million excuses and alternatives. Then one day it hits him that they\u2019re proper friends, have been for ages, and that he <i>cares</i>\u00a0for Aziraphale. And that\u2019s terrifying on any number of levels, he\u2019d never have made up his mind to put himself in such a position, but then he went and did it anyway while he was distracting himself with excuses.</p><p>Basically, whereas Aziraphale has one foolproof explanation (ineffability) that keeps him from facing uncomfortable truths, Crowley does\u00a0see the uncomfortable truth and\u00a0<i>buries it beneath\u00a0every alternate explanation\u00a0under and over the sun.\u00a0</i></p><p>And then eventually the truth becomes too glaring to ignore so he just throws hands and goes the fuck to sleep.</p>",
