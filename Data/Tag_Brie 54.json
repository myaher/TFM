She looked lovely tonight and I appreciated her dressing up especially for this meal with my mum and Isaac. She had an easygoing smile on her lips, as if nothing could ruin tonight. I envied her optimism. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What if she asks us something that throws us off?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I <i>did</i> ask if you wanted to practice running through some questions beforehand,&ldquo; Brie pointed out, a hint of amusement in her voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I scoffed. &quot;Practice? We&rsquo;re best friends, Brie. I know everything about you and vice versa. We&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie laughed. &ldquo;Then relax. We&rsquo;re here now anyway, so take a deep breath and c- <i>woah</i>.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I followed her gaze and saw she was taken aback by the size of my mum&rsquo;s house. I sighed quietly, knowing it was huge. It wasn&rsquo;t the house I had grown up in - that was a little smaller, but still mansion-like - but this was a new one of my mum&rsquo;s. One of her three mansions in America. The other two were &lsquo;holiday homes&rsquo;, as if one house wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Remind me again why you never told me you were filthy rich?&ldquo; Brie asked, as she admired the mansion she was now parking in front of. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Because my mum sees me as a failure since I refused to follow in her footsteps as a lawyer?&rdquo; I reminded her, a hint of annoyance in my voice. I wasn&rsquo;t annoyed with Brie, just being back at my mum&rsquo;s house.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie parked up and took a deep breath. I raised an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thought you weren&rsquo;t nervous?&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She gave me a small smile. &quot;That was before I saw the size of the house.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I rested a hand on her shoulder and squeezed it gently, offering a smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been telling me this whole car ride that we&rsquo;ll be fine, so we will be. Let&rsquo;s just go in and get this over and done with, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded, breathing out slowly. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I grinned, letting go of her shoulder. &ldquo;Awesome! Now pretend you love me and let&rsquo;s go make my mum not hate me anymore!&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie and I went to the door with our gifts - flowers and chocolates - and knocked. Brie nudged me in the shoulder gently and I looked to her, only to feel at ease when she smiled at me. Almost three years into our friendship and she always knew how to make me feel better.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The door opened and some sort of butler opened it, his eyes boring into us both. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Hi, er, I&rsquo;m Y/N Y/L/N, here to see my mum and Isaac?&ldquo; I spoke, stupidly unsure of myself because of his detached expression. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He blinked, looking between us both, before motioning for us to follow him. Brie and I stepped inside as he shut the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;They have a butler,&rdquo; Brie mumbled in my ear, with disbelief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Yup.&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We both followed the butler down the vast entrance, Brie taking it all in from beside me. I would have smiled at how cute she looked, looking around like a kid in a candy store, but I was too busy fretting about how this evening would go down. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Miss, Y/L/N, your daughter and her girlfriend are here,&rdquo; the butler finally spoke as we entered the living-area. My mum and Isaac were sat beside one another, chatting. When they saw us, they both stood up, smiles on their faces. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Girls, lovely to see you both again,&ldquo; my mum said, glancing at her watch. &quot;And not a minute late. Wonderful.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I gave a small smile. &ldquo;You, too, mum. We got you some chocolates and flowers. I thought I&rsquo;d give you your wedding gift next week, and we didn&rsquo;t want to show up empty-handed now, so yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I held out the gifts, but my mum merely glanced at the butler, who took them from my hands and left the room. I cocked my head to Brie, giving her a 'help me&rsquo; look, to which she cleared her throat and looked to my mum with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thank you for inviting us, Y/M/N,&ldquo; she said, stepping forward to put out her hand. &quot;And you must be Isaac! It&rsquo;s a pleasure, sir.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0They both shook Brie&rsquo;s hand before she stepped back beside me, nudging me a little. I moved forward and shook their hands, too. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Come here, Y/N,&ldquo; Isaac said with a grin, pulling me into a hug. &quot;You don&rsquo;t come round nearly as much as I&rsquo;d like. How are you?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled genuinely. I liked Isaac. He always made an effort and I could see he cared about my mum and I. Though, I never understood how he and my mum didn&rsquo;t clash. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m good,&ldquo; I said, taking a seat opposite him and my mum. Brie sat beside me as I continued. &quot;And you? I must congratulate you both, again. I&rsquo;m really happy for you.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Another butler, different from the last, walked in, setting two cups of tea in front of us on the coffee table. Sugar, milk and biscuits were all there and I immediately helped myself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac looked to my mum with lovesick eyes before wrapping an arm around her waist. &ldquo;Thank you, Y/N. Enough about us though. Ever since your mother told me about you having a girlfriend yesterday, I couldn&rsquo;t wait for tonight!&rdquo; His eyes went to Brie. &ldquo;Such a pleasure to meet you, Brie.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I watched both Isaac and my mum as they seemed genuinely excited for me. Isaac always was to be fair, but my mum rarely cared enough about my life, so to see her glancing at me with pride in her eyes made me feel, well, noticed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;&hellip;I&rsquo;m an actress,&ldquo; I tuned back in to see Brie explaining to them both. &quot;I&rsquo;m currently training for this new film called Captain Marvel.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;An actress? Wow!&ldquo; my mum said, an impressed smile on her face. She glanced at me before saying, &quot;I didn&rsquo;t think Y/N would ever end up with someone that successful!&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed my eyes, internalising my annoyance. Of course. I opened my eyes again when I felt Brie&rsquo;s hand in mine, squeezing it gently. I glanced at her, but she was forcing a small smile in my mum&rsquo;s direction. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N is just as successful, Y/M/N,&ldquo; she said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum didn&rsquo;t even recognise the hint of sass in Brie&rsquo;s voice nor the fake smile on her lips, instead laughing as she looked at me, then to Brie again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;So, what films might I have seen you in, Brie, dear? Anything big?&rdquo; she asked, completely dismissing Brie&rsquo;s previous comment. Isaac looked uncomfortable beside my mum, but said nothing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie clenched her jaw and I knew words were going to spill from her mouth in defence of me, but I couldn&rsquo;t let her do that and ruin this, so I interrupted instead.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Nothing you&rsquo;ve heard of mum,&ldquo; I said, earning my mum&rsquo;s attention. &quot;Not your taste of films.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum nodded, sipping her tea. &ldquo;Very well. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have a look at one of your films, Brie. What&rsquo;s your full name, dear?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie glanced at me, before saying, &ldquo;Brie Larson in the credits. But my name is actually Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum nodded, sipping the last of her tea, before standing up. &ldquo;Amazing. I&rsquo;ll look you up&hellip; So, is everyone finished? Dinner should be ready now.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Well actually I-&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Come on, Y/N, hurry,&rdquo; my mum cut me off, before grabbing Isaac&rsquo;s hand and dragging him to the dining room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I pursed my lips and put my half full cup of tea on the coffee table. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N, are you sure you want to do this?&ldquo; Brie asked, turning to face my way with a concerned expression on her face. &quot;I hate to say this, but your mum is-&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Rude, big-headed and judgemental?&ldquo; I filled in for her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Well, yeah,&rdquo; Brie agreed, her voice low. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like how she speaks to you. Why would you want to pretend to have me as a girlfriend to impress someone who treats you horribly?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I stood up, shrugging. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my mum, Brie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Who is proud of you for something that isn&rsquo;t true,&ldquo; she pointed out, standing up beside me. &quot;You know I&rsquo;ll help you out with this, Y/N, but as your friend, I think you should just stand up to your mum and tell her the truth. If she doesn&rsquo;t love you for what you&rsquo;ve got, what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed, meeting Brie&rsquo;s eyes. They were a warm brown colour, with flecks of gold shining through and reminding me who I was. I wasn&rsquo;t a liar. Even for my mum&rsquo;s approval. She was right. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Okay, come on,&ldquo; I said, grabbing her hand and leading her to the dining room. I saw Isaac and my mum taking a seat beside each other and had no choice but to sit opposite them with Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;We&rsquo;re having salmon,&rdquo; my mum said as the waiters brought out the food. &ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;It&rsquo;s fine, thank you,&ldquo; Brie said with a smile, before looking to me with a 'tell her&rsquo; look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I swallowed the lump in my throat before looking to my mum. &quot;Mum, I need to tell you something. About Brie and I.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum nodded, though I could see she wasn&rsquo;t really listening as she watched the waiters put food on her plate. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I thought, well&hellip; you assumed Brie and I were together because of the photo at our flat,&ldquo; I began, and my mum glanced at me, &quot;but you didn&rsquo;t listen to me. I was trying to tell you that\u2013&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Where is this going, Y/N?&ldquo; my mum asked, raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Let her speak, dear,&rdquo; Isaac said, giving her a knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I am, but she&rsquo;s taking her time getting her words out,&ldquo; my mum replied, before staring at me. \u00a0&quot;What is it? Are you breaking up? Are you cheating on her? Are you even together?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I widened my eyes, a little hurt that she&rsquo;d think I would do that, specifically the cheating thing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, I mean, she&rsquo;s an actress,&ldquo; my mum continued, as if each word wasn&rsquo;t a punch to the gut. &quot;It&rsquo;s a little far fetched that you&rsquo;d be with someone like Brie.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/M/N, you should stop there,&ldquo; Isaac said sternly, before glancing at me apologetically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You really think I&rsquo;m that much of a failure that I couldn&rsquo;t be with someone like Brie?&rdquo; I asked with disbelief. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how little you think of me, mum?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N\u2013&quot;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Why is it so hard to believe I could have a girlfriend like her?&ldquo; I questioned her, growing angry. &quot;Because she&rsquo;s beautiful? Talented? Successful? Everything I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N, you&rsquo;re making a scene,&ldquo; my mum said, glaring at me. &quot;This shouldn&rsquo;t be a discussion.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;But it is,&ldquo; I said, the words flying from my mouth. &quot;I&rsquo;m here, telling you I have a girlfriend, and you&rsquo;re still doubting me! Well, guess what, mum, she <i>is </i>my girlfriend whether you believe it or not.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I could feel Brie&rsquo;s eyes on me and I wasn&rsquo;t really sure why I&rsquo;d said that. Anger? Annoyance? I was fed up, that was for sure. With my mum thinking so little of me. I was going to prove to her that I <i>could</i> have someone like Brie, even if it wasn&rsquo;t real, technically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Then what did you want to tell me, Y/N?&ldquo; my mum asked, raising her eyebrows. &quot;I know you&rsquo;re with Brie. You&rsquo;ve obviously proven me wrong. So, what else is there to say?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I clenched my jaw. &ldquo;Nothing. Let&rsquo;s just eat&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded and dug into her food. Isaac looked out of place as he did the same. I glanced at Brie, who&rsquo;s expression I couldn&rsquo;t exactly read. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;So, erm, is the food okay, girls?&ldquo; Isaac asked, trying to make conversation. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I picked at my plate. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Delicious, thank you,&rdquo; Brie spoke up, sensing I wouldn&rsquo;t. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You know, you never told me how you both met,&ldquo; Isaac continued, and I glanced up at him to see an apologetic smile on his lips, as if he were trying to make up for what my mum had said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I appreciated his gesture and couldn&rsquo;t help but give him a small smile in return. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;We met just over two years ago,&rdquo; I said, glancing at Brie, who smiled encouragingly my way. &ldquo;Brie was looking for a flat and I was looking for a flatmate.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I came over to check out the flat and I met Y/N then,&ldquo; Brie added, a genuine smile on her lips. &quot;She was lovely. She showed me the flat, making jokes about everything. Gosh, I&rsquo;d never laughed so hard at a flat viewing.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I chuckled, looking at her. &ldquo;You thought I was funny?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded, meeting my eyes. &ldquo;Why did you think I had to step outside for a moment? I was crying with laughter.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I thought I&rsquo;d freaked you out,&ldquo; I said honestly, a grin on my lips and any annoyance towards my mum momentarily forgotten. &quot;It worked out though.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I ended up moving in with her, obviously,&ldquo; Brie finished, looking to Isaac, and my mum who was studying us both curiously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;And then you asked her out?&rdquo; Isaac guessed with an amused smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I forgot about that bit, so nodded, going along with it. &ldquo;Yeah, sure. Brie asked me out and I said yeah.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I glanced at Brie and saw her smiling to herself. When her eyes met mine, I saw a sparkle of disappointment in her eyes. I wondered what was up, but Isaac spoke again, so I couldn&rsquo;t give it much thought. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;So, you&rsquo;ve been dating for almost three years then?&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I hesitated. &quot;Er, yeah, that&rsquo;s what I said, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac chuckled, though looked at me with a questioning glance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Three years in a relationship and you never once mentioned it to me,&ldquo; my mum spoke, not looking away from her plate. &quot;Lovely, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You only ever talk about yourself when you call me,&ldquo; I retorted, my grip tightening on my fork. &quot;Maybe I never got the chance to mention it.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum finally looked up, her eyes narrowing in my direction. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;What Y/N means to say is that she never found the right moment,&ldquo; Brie said, resting a hand on mine and squeezing it gently. She gave me a pointed look before looking to my mum with an easygoing smile. &quot;She&rsquo;s a private one, as you obviously know. I never pushed her to talk about us to you, but now you know and she&rsquo;s relieved that you do.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Even though you think I&rsquo;m incapable&hellip;&ldquo; I mumbled, earning a glare off Brie. I sighed and looked to my mum. &quot;Yeah, what Brie said.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum sighed. &ldquo;Well, it seems you&rsquo;re both in a committed relationship which is all a mother can ask for.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Exactly,&ldquo; Isaac agreed, sensing the tension that was still present in the air. &quot;Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure your cousins are excited to see you again, and meet Brie, Y/N!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I groaned loudly. &ldquo;Oh, god&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N, be nice,&ldquo; my mum warned. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Cousins?&rdquo; Brie asked, looking to me with a raised eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;My mum&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s kids,&ldquo; I explained. &quot;Also lawyers and very annoying.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N!&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;What? It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; I said to my mum, before looking back to Brie. &ldquo;They debate <i>everything</i>.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;So do you, Y/N,&ldquo; my mum argued, an amused smile on her lips. &quot;You would&rsquo;ve made a fine lawyer if you&rsquo;d gone down that route.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Oh, great, here we go&hellip;&ldquo; I mumbled, paying attention to my food because I knew she&rsquo;d started up on another never-ending rant about my career choice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N would have excelled as a lawyer,&rdquo; my mum spoke regretfully. You&rsquo;d think I was a drug dealer with the way she was talking about me. &ldquo;She has the brain and I have the money and connections. It was all set up for her, to go to law school, but of course she chose differently.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Doing something she loves, though, Y/M/N,&ldquo; Isaac inputted, which I appreciated. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thanks,&rdquo; I said, nodding his way. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;She would have loved law, too,&ldquo; my mum kept on going. &quot;She could still help people and do something for society, like she wants to.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie bit her lip and looked at me, unsure what to say. I shook my head, hoping she knew I wasn&rsquo;t expecting her to say anything. This was way too much to throw out there on a first parent-partner meeting, fake or not. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;&hellip;like you, Brie. Did you always know you wanted to be an actress?&ldquo; my mum asked her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie finished sipping her water, biding her time probably, before saying, &quot;Yes, actually. My parents were really supportive of it, thankfully.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;That must be nice,&ldquo; I commented with an urge to laugh, making Brie stifle a smile. My mum merely rolled her eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;It worked out though, despite the tough times,&rdquo; Brie continued, trying not to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;And this Captain Marvel film, you said you were preparing for it,&ldquo; my mum said, &quot;what does that consist of?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a superhero film, so I&rsquo;m training at the gym. I&rsquo;ve got a personal trainer.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;If only Y/N would go to the gym once in a while,&ldquo; my mum said, making me roll my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thanks, mum,&rdquo; I said, before looking to Brie. &ldquo;You were saying?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pursed her lips, suppressing a smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it really. We start filming at the end of the year, so I&rsquo;m just focusing on my workout at the moment. It&rsquo;s strenuous, but it&rsquo;s paying off.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re definitely in great shape,&ldquo; my mum complimented her, making Brie do that scrunchy shy smile she had. My mum glanced at me, adding, &quot;Unlike some people.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0That&rsquo;s pretty much how the rest of the evening went \u2013 my mum loving Brie, making fun of me and Isaac trying to be a peacemaker. I was glad when it was over. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I can&rsquo;t wait to see you girls next week,&ldquo; Isaac said at the doorway, a smile on his lips. &quot;It was lovely meeting you, Brie. Thank you for making our Y/N happy.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie smiled, glancing at me, which gave me goosebumps oddly enough. She had a really pretty smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Anytime, Isaac,&ldquo; she said to him. &quot;Congratulations to both of you again.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Bye!&ldquo; Isaac said, waving with my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie and I headed to her car and I was glad when she set off. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;That was&hellip; <i>interesting</i>,&rdquo; Brie spoke first, smiling with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry,&ldquo; I said, sighing. &quot;I know I was supposed to tell the truth, but god, my mum gets on my nerves so much. I felt like I had to prove her wrong and before I knew it, I was\u2013&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Proving her wrong, I saw,&ldquo; Brie finished, now laughing. &quot;It&rsquo;s fine, I get it. No offence, but what your mum said&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t nice. I don&rsquo;t blame you for proving her wrong. You could <i>easily </i>get a, well, a girl like me, I guess.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thanks, Brie,&ldquo; I said sincerely, smiling her way. &quot;That means a lot.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Hey, I&rsquo;m not finished,&ldquo; she said, glancing at me before looking back to the road. &quot;You were mean, too. To yourself. All that shit you said about me being successful and beautiful and talented? You&rsquo;re all of those things and I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Brie, I\u2013&quot;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;No,&ldquo; she cut me off, frowning. &quot;Just because your mum puts you down doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to, too. I&rsquo;m not faking this if you&rsquo;re going to keep doing that. Okay?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded. &ldquo;Okay. Sorry.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Don&rsquo;t apologise to me,&ldquo; she said, her voice softer now. &quot;Just be nicer to yourself.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I kept quiet, studying Brie. She was concentrating on driving, her lips pursed and her eyes staring out ahead. A whole evening spent with my mum and she still looked as good as new. Beautiful and anyone would agree. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re a better fake girlfriend than some of the real girlfriends I&rsquo;ve had,&ldquo; I admitted, chuckling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie shook her head, smiling a little. &quot;Someone&rsquo;s gotta make sure you don&rsquo;t go insane.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Well I&rsquo;m lucky it&rsquo;s you,&ldquo; I said gratefully, moving forward and giving her a kiss on the cheek. &quot;Thanks.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She didn&rsquo;t reply, so I got comfortable and looked out the window, wondering what next week would bring. </p>",

We\u2019re here now anyway, so take a deep breath and c- <i>woah</i>.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I followed her gaze and saw she was taken aback by the size of my mum\u2019s house. I sighed quietly, knowing it was huge. It wasn\u2019t the house I had grown up in - that was a little smaller, but still mansion-like - but this was a new one of my mum\u2019s. One of her three mansions in America. The other two were \u2018holiday homes\u2019, as if one house wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Remind me again why you never told me you were filthy rich?\u201c Brie asked, as she admired the mansion she was now parking in front of. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Because my mum sees me as a failure since I refused to follow in her footsteps as a lawyer?\u201d I reminded her, a hint of annoyance in my voice. I wasn\u2019t annoyed with Brie, just being back at my mum\u2019s house.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie parked up and took a deep breath. I raised an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thought you weren\u2019t nervous?\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She gave me a small smile. \"That was before I saw the size of the house.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I rested a hand on her shoulder and squeezed it gently, offering a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve been telling me this whole car ride that we\u2019ll be fine, so we will be. Let\u2019s just go in and get this over and done with, yeah?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded, breathing out slowly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I grinned, letting go of her shoulder. \u201cAwesome! Now pretend you love me and let\u2019s go make my mum not hate me anymore!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie and I went to the door with our gifts - flowers and chocolates - and knocked. Brie nudged me in the shoulder gently and I looked to her, only to feel at ease when she smiled at me. Almost three years into our friendship and she always knew how to make me feel better.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The door opened and some sort of butler opened it, his eyes boring into us both. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Hi, er, I\u2019m Y/N Y/L/N, here to see my mum and Isaac?\u201c I spoke, stupidly unsure of myself because of his detached expression. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He blinked, looking between us both, before motioning for us to follow him. Brie and I stepped inside as he shut the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"They have a butler,\u201d Brie mumbled in my ear, with disbelief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Yup.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We both followed the butler down the vast entrance, Brie taking it all in from beside me. I would have smiled at how cute she looked, looking around like a kid in a candy store, but I was too busy fretting about how this evening would go down. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Miss, Y/L/N, your daughter and her girlfriend are here,\u201d the butler finally spoke as we entered the living-area. My mum and Isaac were sat beside one another, chatting. When they saw us, they both stood up, smiles on their faces. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Girls, lovely to see you both again,\u201c my mum said, glancing at her watch. \"And not a minute late. Wonderful.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I gave a small smile. \u201cYou, too, mum. We got you some chocolates and flowers. I thought I\u2019d give you your wedding gift next week, and we didn\u2019t want to show up empty-handed now, so yeah.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I held out the gifts, but my mum merely glanced at the butler, who took them from my hands and left the room. I cocked my head to Brie, giving her a 'help me\u2019 look, to which she cleared her throat and looked to my mum with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you for inviting us, Y/M/N,\u201c she said, stepping forward to put out her hand. \"And you must be Isaac! It\u2019s a pleasure, sir.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0They both shook Brie\u2019s hand before she stepped back beside me, nudging me a little. I moved forward and shook their hands, too. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Come here, Y/N,\u201c Isaac said with a grin, pulling me into a hug. \"You don\u2019t come round nearly as much as I\u2019d like. How are you?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled genuinely. I liked Isaac. He always made an effort and I could see he cared about my mum and I. Though, I never understood how he and my mum didn\u2019t clash. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m good,\u201c I said, taking a seat opposite him and my mum. Brie sat beside me as I continued. \"And you? I must congratulate you both, again. I\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Another butler, different from the last, walked in, setting two cups of tea in front of us on the coffee table. Sugar, milk and biscuits were all there and I immediately helped myself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac looked to my mum with lovesick eyes before wrapping an arm around her waist. \u201cThank you, Y/N. Enough about us though. Ever since your mother told me about you having a girlfriend yesterday, I couldn\u2019t wait for tonight!\u201d His eyes went to Brie. \u201cSuch a pleasure to meet you, Brie.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I watched both Isaac and my mum as they seemed genuinely excited for me. Isaac always was to be fair, but my mum rarely cared enough about my life, so to see her glancing at me with pride in her eyes made me feel, well, noticed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2026I\u2019m an actress,\u201c I tuned back in to see Brie explaining to them both. \"I\u2019m currently training for this new film called Captain Marvel.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"An actress? Wow!\u201c my mum said, an impressed smile on her face. She glanced at me before saying, \"I didn\u2019t think Y/N would ever end up with someone that successful!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed my eyes, internalising my annoyance. Of course. I opened my eyes again when I felt Brie\u2019s hand in mine, squeezing it gently. I glanced at her, but she was forcing a small smile in my mum\u2019s direction. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N is just as successful, Y/M/N,\u201c she said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum didn\u2019t even recognise the hint of sass in Brie\u2019s voice nor the fake smile on her lips, instead laughing as she looked at me, then to Brie again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So, what films might I have seen you in, Brie, dear? Anything big?\u201d she asked, completely dismissing Brie\u2019s previous comment. Isaac looked uncomfortable beside my mum, but said nothing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie clenched her jaw and I knew words were going to spill from her mouth in defence of me, but I couldn\u2019t let her do that and ruin this, so I interrupted instead.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Nothing you\u2019ve heard of mum,\u201c I said, earning my mum\u2019s attention. \"Not your taste of films.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum nodded, sipping her tea. \u201cVery well. Maybe I\u2019ll have a look at one of your films, Brie. What\u2019s your full name, dear?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie glanced at me, before saying, \u201cBrie Larson in the credits. But my name is actually Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum nodded, sipping the last of her tea, before standing up. \u201cAmazing. I\u2019ll look you up\u2026 So, is everyone finished? Dinner should be ready now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well actually I-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Come on, Y/N, hurry,\u201d my mum cut me off, before grabbing Isaac\u2019s hand and dragging him to the dining room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I pursed my lips and put my half full cup of tea on the coffee table. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, are you sure you want to do this?\u201c Brie asked, turning to face my way with a concerned expression on her face. \"I hate to say this, but your mum is-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Rude, big-headed and judgemental?\u201c I filled in for her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, yeah,\u201d Brie agreed, her voice low. \u201cI don\u2019t like how she speaks to you. Why would you want to pretend to have me as a girlfriend to impress someone who treats you horribly?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I stood up, shrugging. \u201cShe\u2019s my mum, Brie\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Who is proud of you for something that isn\u2019t true,\u201c she pointed out, standing up beside me. \"You know I\u2019ll help you out with this, Y/N, but as your friend, I think you should just stand up to your mum and tell her the truth. If she doesn\u2019t love you for what you\u2019ve got, what\u2019s the point?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed, meeting Brie\u2019s eyes. They were a warm brown colour, with flecks of gold shining through and reminding me who I was. I wasn\u2019t a liar. Even for my mum\u2019s approval. She was right. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Okay, come on,\u201c I said, grabbing her hand and leading her to the dining room. I saw Isaac and my mum taking a seat beside each other and had no choice but to sit opposite them with Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We\u2019re having salmon,\u201d my mum said as the waiters brought out the food. \u201cI hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It\u2019s fine, thank you,\u201c Brie said with a smile, before looking to me with a 'tell her\u2019 look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I swallowed the lump in my throat before looking to my mum. \"Mum, I need to tell you something. About Brie and I.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum nodded, though I could see she wasn\u2019t really listening as she watched the waiters put food on her plate. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I thought, well\u2026 you assumed Brie and I were together because of the photo at our flat,\u201c I began, and my mum glanced at me, \"but you didn\u2019t listen to me. I was trying to tell you that\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Where is this going, Y/N?\u201c my mum asked, raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Let her speak, dear,\u201d Isaac said, giving her a knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I am, but she\u2019s taking her time getting her words out,\u201c my mum replied, before staring at me. \u00a0\"What is it? Are you breaking up? Are you cheating on her? Are you even together?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I widened my eyes, a little hurt that she\u2019d think I would do that, specifically the cheating thing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, I mean, she\u2019s an actress,\u201c my mum continued, as if each word wasn\u2019t a punch to the gut. \"It\u2019s a little far fetched that you\u2019d be with someone like Brie.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/M/N, you should stop there,\u201c Isaac said sternly, before glancing at me apologetically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You really think I\u2019m that much of a failure that I couldn\u2019t be with someone like Brie?\u201d I asked with disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s how little you think of me, mum?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Why is it so hard to believe I could have a girlfriend like her?\u201c I questioned her, growing angry. \"Because she\u2019s beautiful? Talented? Successful? Everything I\u2019m not?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, you\u2019re making a scene,\u201c my mum said, glaring at me. \"This shouldn\u2019t be a discussion.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"But it is,\u201c I said, the words flying from my mouth. \"I\u2019m here, telling you I have a girlfriend, and you\u2019re still doubting me! Well, guess what, mum, she <i>is </i>my girlfriend whether you believe it or not.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I could feel Brie\u2019s eyes on me and I wasn\u2019t really sure why I\u2019d said that. Anger? Annoyance? I was fed up, that was for sure. With my mum thinking so little of me. I was going to prove to her that I <i>could</i> have someone like Brie, even if it wasn\u2019t real, technically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Then what did you want to tell me, Y/N?\u201c my mum asked, raising her eyebrows. \"I know you\u2019re with Brie. You\u2019ve obviously proven me wrong. So, what else is there to say?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I clenched my jaw. \u201cNothing. Let\u2019s just eat\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded and dug into her food. Isaac looked out of place as he did the same. I glanced at Brie, who\u2019s expression I couldn\u2019t exactly read. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So, erm, is the food okay, girls?\u201c Isaac asked, trying to make conversation. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I picked at my plate. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Delicious, thank you,\u201d Brie spoke up, sensing I wouldn\u2019t. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You know, you never told me how you both met,\u201c Isaac continued, and I glanced up at him to see an apologetic smile on his lips, as if he were trying to make up for what my mum had said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I appreciated his gesture and couldn\u2019t help but give him a small smile in return. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We met just over two years ago,\u201d I said, glancing at Brie, who smiled encouragingly my way. \u201cBrie was looking for a flat and I was looking for a flatmate.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I came over to check out the flat and I met Y/N then,\u201c Brie added, a genuine smile on her lips. \"She was lovely. She showed me the flat, making jokes about everything. Gosh, I\u2019d never laughed so hard at a flat viewing.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I chuckled, looking at her. \u201cYou thought I was funny?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded, meeting my eyes. \u201cWhy did you think I had to step outside for a moment? I was crying with laughter.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I thought I\u2019d freaked you out,\u201c I said honestly, a grin on my lips and any annoyance towards my mum momentarily forgotten. \"It worked out though.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I ended up moving in with her, obviously,\u201c Brie finished, looking to Isaac, and my mum who was studying us both curiously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"And then you asked her out?\u201d Isaac guessed with an amused smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I forgot about that bit, so nodded, going along with it. \u201cYeah, sure. Brie asked me out and I said yeah.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I glanced at Brie and saw her smiling to herself. When her eyes met mine, I saw a sparkle of disappointment in her eyes. I wondered what was up, but Isaac spoke again, so I couldn\u2019t give it much thought. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So, you\u2019ve been dating for almost three years then?\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I hesitated. \"Er, yeah, that\u2019s what I said, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac chuckled, though looked at me with a questioning glance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Three years in a relationship and you never once mentioned it to me,\u201c my mum spoke, not looking away from her plate. \"Lovely, Y/N.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You only ever talk about yourself when you call me,\u201c I retorted, my grip tightening on my fork. \"Maybe I never got the chance to mention it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum finally looked up, her eyes narrowing in my direction. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"What Y/N means to say is that she never found the right moment,\u201c Brie said, resting a hand on mine and squeezing it gently. She gave me a pointed look before looking to my mum with an easygoing smile. \"She\u2019s a private one, as you obviously know. I never pushed her to talk about us to you, but now you know and she\u2019s relieved that you do.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Even though you think I\u2019m incapable\u2026\u201c I mumbled, earning a glare off Brie. I sighed and looked to my mum. \"Yeah, what Brie said.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum sighed. \u201cWell, it seems you\u2019re both in a committed relationship which is all a mother can ask for.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Exactly,\u201c Isaac agreed, sensing the tension that was still present in the air. \"Anyway, I\u2019m sure your cousins are excited to see you again, and meet Brie, Y/N!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I groaned loudly. \u201cOh, god\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, be nice,\u201c my mum warned. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Cousins?\u201d Brie asked, looking to me with a raised eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"My mum\u2019s sister\u2019s kids,\u201c I explained. \"Also lawyers and very annoying.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"What? It\u2019s true!\u201d I said to my mum, before looking back to Brie. \u201cThey debate <i>everything</i>.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So do you, Y/N,\u201c my mum argued, an amused smile on her lips. \"You would\u2019ve made a fine lawyer if you\u2019d gone down that route.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, great, here we go\u2026\u201c I mumbled, paying attention to my food because I knew she\u2019d started up on another never-ending rant about my career choice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N would have excelled as a lawyer,\u201d my mum spoke regretfully. You\u2019d think I was a drug dealer with the way she was talking about me. \u201cShe has the brain and I have the money and connections. It was all set up for her, to go to law school, but of course she chose differently.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Doing something she loves, though, Y/M/N,\u201c Isaac inputted, which I appreciated. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks,\u201d I said, nodding his way. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"She would have loved law, too,\u201c my mum kept on going. \"She could still help people and do something for society, like she wants to.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie bit her lip and looked at me, unsure what to say. I shook my head, hoping she knew I wasn\u2019t expecting her to say anything. This was way too much to throw out there on a first parent-partner meeting, fake or not. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2026like you, Brie. Did you always know you wanted to be an actress?\u201c my mum asked her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie finished sipping her water, biding her time probably, before saying, \"Yes, actually. My parents were really supportive of it, thankfully.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"That must be nice,\u201c I commented with an urge to laugh, making Brie stifle a smile. My mum merely rolled her eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It worked out though, despite the tough times,\u201d Brie continued, trying not to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"And this Captain Marvel film, you said you were preparing for it,\u201c my mum said, \"what does that consist of?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie nodded. \u201cYeah, so it\u2019s a superhero film, so I\u2019m training at the gym. I\u2019ve got a personal trainer.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"If only Y/N would go to the gym once in a while,\u201c my mum said, making me roll my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks, mum,\u201d I said, before looking to Brie. \u201cYou were saying?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pursed her lips, suppressing a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s it really. We start filming at the end of the year, so I\u2019m just focusing on my workout at the moment. It\u2019s strenuous, but it\u2019s paying off.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re definitely in great shape,\u201c my mum complimented her, making Brie do that scrunchy shy smile she had. My mum glanced at me, adding, \"Unlike some people.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s pretty much how the rest of the evening went \u2013 my mum loving Brie, making fun of me and Isaac trying to be a peacemaker. I was glad when it was over. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I can\u2019t wait to see you girls next week,\u201c Isaac said at the doorway, a smile on his lips. \"It was lovely meeting you, Brie. Thank you for making our Y/N happy.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie smiled, glancing at me, which gave me goosebumps oddly enough. She had a really pretty smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Anytime, Isaac,\u201c she said to him. \"Congratulations to both of you again.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Bye!\u201c Isaac said, waving with my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie and I headed to her car and I was glad when she set off. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"That was\u2026 <i>interesting</i>,\u201d Brie spoke first, smiling with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry,\u201c I said, sighing. \"I know I was supposed to tell the truth, but god, my mum gets on my nerves so much. I felt like I had to prove her wrong and before I knew it, I was\u2013\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Proving her wrong, I saw,\u201c Brie finished, now laughing. \"It\u2019s fine, I get it. No offence, but what your mum said\u2026 it wasn\u2019t nice. I don\u2019t blame you for proving her wrong. You could <i>easily </i>get a, well, a girl like me, I guess.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks, Brie,\u201c I said sincerely, smiling her way. \"That means a lot.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, I\u2019m not finished,\u201c she said, glancing at me before looking back to the road. \"You were mean, too. To yourself. All that shit you said about me being successful and beautiful and talented? You\u2019re all of those things and I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t think so.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Brie, I\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"No,\u201c she cut me off, frowning. \"Just because your mum puts you down doesn\u2019t mean you have to, too. I\u2019m not faking this if you\u2019re going to keep doing that. Okay?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded. \u201cOkay. Sorry.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Don\u2019t apologise to me,\u201c she said, her voice softer now. \"Just be nicer to yourself.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I kept quiet, studying Brie. She was concentrating on driving, her lips pursed and her eyes staring out ahead. A whole evening spent with my mum and she still looked as good as new. Beautiful and anyone would agree. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re a better fake girlfriend than some of the real girlfriends I\u2019ve had,\u201c I admitted, chuckling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie shook her head, smiling a little. \"Someone\u2019s gotta make sure you don\u2019t go insane.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well I\u2019m lucky it\u2019s you,\u201c I said gratefully, moving forward and giving her a kiss on the cheek. \"Thanks.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She didn\u2019t reply, so I got comfortable and looked out the window, wondering what next week would bring. </p>",

We\u2019re best friends, Brie. I know everything about you and vice versa. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie laughed. \u201cThen relax. We\u2019re here now anyway, so take a deep breath and c- <i>woah</i>.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I followed her gaze and saw she was taken aback by the size of my mum\u2019s house. I sighed quietly, knowing it was huge. It wasn\u2019t the house I had grown up in - that was a little smaller, but still mansion-like - but this was a new one of my mum\u2019s. One of her three mansions in America. The other two were \u2018holiday homes\u2019, as if one house wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Remind me again why you never told me you were filthy rich?\u201c Brie asked, as she admired the mansion she was now parking in front of. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Because my mum sees me as a failure since I refused to follow in her footsteps as a lawyer?\u201d I reminded her, a hint of annoyance in my voice. I wasn\u2019t annoyed with Brie, just being back at my mum\u2019s house.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie parked up and took a deep breath. I raised an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thought you weren\u2019t nervous?\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She gave me a small smile. \"That was before I saw the size of the house.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I rested a hand on her shoulder and squeezed it gently, offering a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve been telling me this whole car ride that we\u2019ll be fine, so we will be. Let\u2019s just go in and get this over and done with, yeah?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded, breathing out slowly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I grinned, letting go of her shoulder. \u201cAwesome! Now pretend you love me and let\u2019s go make my mum not hate me anymore!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie and I went to the door with our gifts - flowers and chocolates - and knocked. Brie nudged me in the shoulder gently and I looked to her, only to feel at ease when she smiled at me. Almost three years into our friendship and she always knew how to make me feel better.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The door opened and some sort of butler opened it, his eyes boring into us both. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Hi, er, I\u2019m Y/N Y/L/N, here to see my mum and Isaac?\u201c I spoke, stupidly unsure of myself because of his detached expression. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He blinked, looking between us both, before motioning for us to follow him. Brie and I stepped inside as he shut the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"They have a butler,\u201d Brie mumbled in my ear, with disbelief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Yup.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We both followed the butler down the vast entrance, Brie taking it all in from beside me. I would have smiled at how cute she looked, looking around like a kid in a candy store, but I was too busy fretting about how this evening would go down. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Miss, Y/L/N, your daughter and her girlfriend are here,\u201d the butler finally spoke as we entered the living-area. My mum and Isaac were sat beside one another, chatting. When they saw us, they both stood up, smiles on their faces. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Girls, lovely to see you both again,\u201c my mum said, glancing at her watch. \"And not a minute late. Wonderful.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I gave a small smile. \u201cYou, too, mum. We got you some chocolates and flowers. I thought I\u2019d give you your wedding gift next week, and we didn\u2019t want to show up empty-handed now, so yeah.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I held out the gifts, but my mum merely glanced at the butler, who took them from my hands and left the room. I cocked my head to Brie, giving her a 'help me\u2019 look, to which she cleared her throat and looked to my mum with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you for inviting us, Y/M/N,\u201c she said, stepping forward to put out her hand. \"And you must be Isaac! It\u2019s a pleasure, sir.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0They both shook Brie\u2019s hand before she stepped back beside me, nudging me a little. I moved forward and shook their hands, too. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Come here, Y/N,\u201c Isaac said with a grin, pulling me into a hug. \"You don\u2019t come round nearly as much as I\u2019d like. How are you?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled genuinely. I liked Isaac. He always made an effort and I could see he cared about my mum and I. Though, I never understood how he and my mum didn\u2019t clash. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m good,\u201c I said, taking a seat opposite him and my mum. Brie sat beside me as I continued. \"And you? I must congratulate you both, again. I\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Another butler, different from the last, walked in, setting two cups of tea in front of us on the coffee table. Sugar, milk and biscuits were all there and I immediately helped myself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac looked to my mum with lovesick eyes before wrapping an arm around her waist. \u201cThank you, Y/N. Enough about us though. Ever since your mother told me about you having a girlfriend yesterday, I couldn\u2019t wait for tonight!\u201d His eyes went to Brie. \u201cSuch a pleasure to meet you, Brie.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I watched both Isaac and my mum as they seemed genuinely excited for me. Isaac always was to be fair, but my mum rarely cared enough about my life, so to see her glancing at me with pride in her eyes made me feel, well, noticed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2026I\u2019m an actress,\u201c I tuned back in to see Brie explaining to them both. \"I\u2019m currently training for this new film called Captain Marvel.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"An actress? Wow!\u201c my mum said, an impressed smile on her face. She glanced at me before saying, \"I didn\u2019t think Y/N would ever end up with someone that successful!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed my eyes, internalising my annoyance. Of course. I opened my eyes again when I felt Brie\u2019s hand in mine, squeezing it gently. I glanced at her, but she was forcing a small smile in my mum\u2019s direction. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N is just as successful, Y/M/N,\u201c she said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum didn\u2019t even recognise the hint of sass in Brie\u2019s voice nor the fake smile on her lips, instead laughing as she looked at me, then to Brie again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So, what films might I have seen you in, Brie, dear? Anything big?\u201d she asked, completely dismissing Brie\u2019s previous comment. Isaac looked uncomfortable beside my mum, but said nothing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie clenched her jaw and I knew words were going to spill from her mouth in defence of me, but I couldn\u2019t let her do that and ruin this, so I interrupted instead.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Nothing you\u2019ve heard of mum,\u201c I said, earning my mum\u2019s attention. \"Not your taste of films.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum nodded, sipping her tea. \u201cVery well. Maybe I\u2019ll have a look at one of your films, Brie. What\u2019s your full name, dear?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie glanced at me, before saying, \u201cBrie Larson in the credits. But my name is actually Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum nodded, sipping the last of her tea, before standing up. \u201cAmazing. I\u2019ll look you up\u2026 So, is everyone finished? Dinner should be ready now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well actually I-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Come on, Y/N, hurry,\u201d my mum cut me off, before grabbing Isaac\u2019s hand and dragging him to the dining room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I pursed my lips and put my half full cup of tea on the coffee table. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, are you sure you want to do this?\u201c Brie asked, turning to face my way with a concerned expression on her face. \"I hate to say this, but your mum is-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Rude, big-headed and judgemental?\u201c I filled in for her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, yeah,\u201d Brie agreed, her voice low. \u201cI don\u2019t like how she speaks to you. Why would you want to pretend to have me as a girlfriend to impress someone who treats you horribly?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I stood up, shrugging. \u201cShe\u2019s my mum, Brie\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Who is proud of you for something that isn\u2019t true,\u201c she pointed out, standing up beside me. \"You know I\u2019ll help you out with this, Y/N, but as your friend, I think you should just stand up to your mum and tell her the truth. If she doesn\u2019t love you for what you\u2019ve got, what\u2019s the point?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed, meeting Brie\u2019s eyes. They were a warm brown colour, with flecks of gold shining through and reminding me who I was. I wasn\u2019t a liar. Even for my mum\u2019s approval. She was right. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Okay, come on,\u201c I said, grabbing her hand and leading her to the dining room. I saw Isaac and my mum taking a seat beside each other and had no choice but to sit opposite them with Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We\u2019re having salmon,\u201d my mum said as the waiters brought out the food. \u201cI hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It\u2019s fine, thank you,\u201c Brie said with a smile, before looking to me with a 'tell her\u2019 look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I swallowed the lump in my throat before looking to my mum. \"Mum, I need to tell you something. About Brie and I.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum nodded, though I could see she wasn\u2019t really listening as she watched the waiters put food on her plate. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I thought, well\u2026 you assumed Brie and I were together because of the photo at our flat,\u201c I began, and my mum glanced at me, \"but you didn\u2019t listen to me. I was trying to tell you that\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Where is this going, Y/N?\u201c my mum asked, raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Let her speak, dear,\u201d Isaac said, giving her a knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I am, but she\u2019s taking her time getting her words out,\u201c my mum replied, before staring at me. \u00a0\"What is it? Are you breaking up? Are you cheating on her? Are you even together?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I widened my eyes, a little hurt that she\u2019d think I would do that, specifically the cheating thing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, I mean, she\u2019s an actress,\u201c my mum continued, as if each word wasn\u2019t a punch to the gut. \"It\u2019s a little far fetched that you\u2019d be with someone like Brie.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/M/N, you should stop there,\u201c Isaac said sternly, before glancing at me apologetically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You really think I\u2019m that much of a failure that I couldn\u2019t be with someone like Brie?\u201d I asked with disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s how little you think of me, mum?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Why is it so hard to believe I could have a girlfriend like her?\u201c I questioned her, growing angry. \"Because she\u2019s beautiful? Talented? Successful? Everything I\u2019m not?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, you\u2019re making a scene,\u201c my mum said, glaring at me. \"This shouldn\u2019t be a discussion.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"But it is,\u201c I said, the words flying from my mouth. \"I\u2019m here, telling you I have a girlfriend, and you\u2019re still doubting me! Well, guess what, mum, she <i>is </i>my girlfriend whether you believe it or not.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I could feel Brie\u2019s eyes on me and I wasn\u2019t really sure why I\u2019d said that. Anger? Annoyance? I was fed up, that was for sure. With my mum thinking so little of me. I was going to prove to her that I <i>could</i> have someone like Brie, even if it wasn\u2019t real, technically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Then what did you want to tell me, Y/N?\u201c my mum asked, raising her eyebrows. \"I know you\u2019re with Brie. You\u2019ve obviously proven me wrong. So, what else is there to say?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I clenched my jaw. \u201cNothing. Let\u2019s just eat\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded and dug into her food. Isaac looked out of place as he did the same. I glanced at Brie, who\u2019s expression I couldn\u2019t exactly read. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So, erm, is the food okay, girls?\u201c Isaac asked, trying to make conversation. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I picked at my plate. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Delicious, thank you,\u201d Brie spoke up, sensing I wouldn\u2019t. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You know, you never told me how you both met,\u201c Isaac continued, and I glanced up at him to see an apologetic smile on his lips, as if he were trying to make up for what my mum had said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I appreciated his gesture and couldn\u2019t help but give him a small smile in return. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We met just over two years ago,\u201d I said, glancing at Brie, who smiled encouragingly my way. \u201cBrie was looking for a flat and I was looking for a flatmate.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I came over to check out the flat and I met Y/N then,\u201c Brie added, a genuine smile on her lips. \"She was lovely. She showed me the flat, making jokes about everything. Gosh, I\u2019d never laughed so hard at a flat viewing.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I chuckled, looking at her. \u201cYou thought I was funny?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She nodded, meeting my eyes. \u201cWhy did you think I had to step outside for a moment? I was crying with laughter.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I thought I\u2019d freaked you out,\u201c I said honestly, a grin on my lips and any annoyance towards my mum momentarily forgotten. \"It worked out though.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I ended up moving in with her, obviously,\u201c Brie finished, looking to Isaac, and my mum who was studying us both curiously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"And then you asked her out?\u201d Isaac guessed with an amused smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I forgot about that bit, so nodded, going along with it. \u201cYeah, sure. Brie asked me out and I said yeah.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I glanced at Brie and saw her smiling to herself. When her eyes met mine, I saw a sparkle of disappointment in her eyes. I wondered what was up, but Isaac spoke again, so I couldn\u2019t give it much thought. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So, you\u2019ve been dating for almost three years then?\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I hesitated. \"Er, yeah, that\u2019s what I said, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Isaac chuckled, though looked at me with a questioning glance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Three years in a relationship and you never once mentioned it to me,\u201c my mum spoke, not looking away from her plate. \"Lovely, Y/N.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You only ever talk about yourself when you call me,\u201c I retorted, my grip tightening on my fork. \"Maybe I never got the chance to mention it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum finally looked up, her eyes narrowing in my direction. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"What Y/N means to say is that she never found the right moment,\u201c Brie said, resting a hand on mine and squeezing it gently. She gave me a pointed look before looking to my mum with an easygoing smile. \"She\u2019s a private one, as you obviously know. I never pushed her to talk about us to you, but now you know and she\u2019s relieved that you do.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Even though you think I\u2019m incapable\u2026\u201c I mumbled, earning a glare off Brie. I sighed and looked to my mum. \"Yeah, what Brie said.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum sighed. \u201cWell, it seems you\u2019re both in a committed relationship which is all a mother can ask for.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Exactly,\u201c Isaac agreed, sensing the tension that was still present in the air. \"Anyway, I\u2019m sure your cousins are excited to see you again, and meet Brie, Y/N!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I groaned loudly. \u201cOh, god\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, be nice,\u201c my mum warned. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Cousins?\u201d Brie asked, looking to me with a raised eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"My mum\u2019s sister\u2019s kids,\u201c I explained. \"Also lawyers and very annoying.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"What? It\u2019s true!\u201d I said to my mum, before looking back to Brie. \u201cThey debate <i>everything</i>.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"So do you, Y/N,\u201c my mum argued, an amused smile on her lips. \"You would\u2019ve made a fine lawyer if you\u2019d gone down that route.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, great, here we go\u2026\u201c I mumbled, paying attention to my food because I knew she\u2019d started up on another never-ending rant about my career choice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N would have excelled as a lawyer,\u201d my mum spoke regretfully. You\u2019d think I was a drug dealer with the way she was talking about me. \u201cShe has the brain and I have the money and connections. It was all set up for her, to go to law school, but of course she chose differently.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Doing something she loves, though, Y/M/N,\u201c Isaac inputted, which I appreciated. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks,\u201d I said, nodding his way. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"She would have loved law, too,\u201c my mum kept on going. \"She could still help people and do something for society, like she wants to.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie bit her lip and looked at me, unsure what to say. I shook my head, hoping she knew I wasn\u2019t expecting her to say anything. This was way too much to throw out there on a first parent-partner meeting, fake or not. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2026like you, Brie. Did you always know you wanted to be an actress?\u201c my mum asked her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie finished sipping her water, biding her time probably, before saying, \"Yes, actually. My parents were really supportive of it, thankfully.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"That must be nice,\u201c I commented with an urge to laugh, making Brie stifle a smile. My mum merely rolled her eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It worked out though, despite the tough times,\u201d Brie continued, trying not to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"And this Captain Marvel film, you said you were preparing for it,\u201c my mum said, \"what does that consist of?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie nodded. \u201cYeah, so it\u2019s a superhero film, so I\u2019m training at the gym. I\u2019ve got a personal trainer.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"If only Y/N would go to the gym once in a while,\u201c my mum said, making me roll my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks, mum,\u201d I said, before looking to Brie. \u201cYou were saying?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pursed her lips, suppressing a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s it really. We start filming at the end of the year, so I\u2019m just focusing on my workout at the moment. It\u2019s strenuous, but it\u2019s paying off.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re definitely in great shape,\u201c my mum complimented her, making Brie do that scrunchy shy smile she had. My mum glanced at me, adding, \"Unlike some people.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s pretty much how the rest of the evening went \u2013 my mum loving Brie, making fun of me and Isaac trying to be a peacemaker. I was glad when it was over. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I can\u2019t wait to see you girls next week,\u201c Isaac said at the doorway, a smile on his lips. \"It was lovely meeting you, Brie. Thank you for making our Y/N happy.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie smiled, glancing at me, which gave me goosebumps oddly enough. She had a really pretty smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Anytime, Isaac,\u201c she said to him. \"Congratulations to both of you again.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Bye!\u201c Isaac said, waving with my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie and I headed to her car and I was glad when she set off. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"That was\u2026 <i>interesting</i>,\u201d Brie spoke first, smiling with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry,\u201c I said, sighing. \"I know I was supposed to tell the truth, but god, my mum gets on my nerves so much. I felt like I had to prove her wrong and before I knew it, I was\u2013\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Proving her wrong, I saw,\u201c Brie finished, now laughing. \"It\u2019s fine, I get it. No offence, but what your mum said\u2026 it wasn\u2019t nice. I don\u2019t blame you for proving her wrong. You could <i>easily </i>get a, well, a girl like me, I guess.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks, Brie,\u201c I said sincerely, smiling her way. \"That means a lot.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, I\u2019m not finished,\u201c she said, glancing at me before looking back to the road. \"You were mean, too. To yourself. All that shit you said about me being successful and beautiful and talented? You\u2019re all of those things and I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t think so.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Brie, I\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"No,\u201c she cut me off, frowning. \"Just because your mum puts you down doesn\u2019t mean you have to, too. I\u2019m not faking this if you\u2019re going to keep doing that. Okay?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded. \u201cOkay. Sorry.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Don\u2019t apologise to me,\u201c she said, her voice softer now. \"Just be nicer to yourself.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I kept quiet, studying Brie. She was concentrating on driving, her lips pursed and her eyes staring out ahead. A whole evening spent with my mum and she still looked as good as new. Beautiful and anyone would agree. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re a better fake girlfriend than some of the real girlfriends I\u2019ve had,\u201c I admitted, chuckling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie shook her head, smiling a little. \"Someone\u2019s gotta make sure you don\u2019t go insane.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well I\u2019m lucky it\u2019s you,\u201c I said gratefully, moving forward and giving her a kiss on the cheek. \"Thanks.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She didn\u2019t reply, so I got comfortable and looked out the window, wondering what next week would bring. </p>",

She looked lovely tonight and I appreciated her dressing up especially for this meal with my mum and Isaac. She had an easygoing smile on her lips, as if nothing could ruin tonight. I envied her optimism. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What if she asks us something that throws us off?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I <i>did</i> ask if you wanted to practice running through some questions beforehand,&ldquo; Brie pointed out, a hint of amusement in her voice. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I scoffed. \"Practice? We&rsquo;re best friends, Brie. I know everything about you and vice versa. We&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie laughed. &ldquo;Then relax. We&rsquo;re here now anyway, so take a deep breath and c- <i>woah</i>.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I followed her gaze and saw she was taken aback by the size of my mum&rsquo;s house. I sighed quietly, knowing it was huge. It wasn&rsquo;t the house I had grown up in - that was a little smaller, but still mansion-like - but this was a new one of my mum&rsquo;s. One of her three mansions in America. The other two were &lsquo;holiday homes&rsquo;, as if one house wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Remind me again why you never told me you were filthy rich?&ldquo; Brie asked, as she admired the mansion she was now parking in front of. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Because my mum sees me as a failure since I refused to follow in her footsteps as a lawyer?&rdquo; I reminded her, a hint of annoyance in my voice. I wasn&rsquo;t annoyed with Brie, just being back at my mum&rsquo;s house.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie parked up and took a deep breath. I raised an eyebrow. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thought you weren&rsquo;t nervous?&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She gave me a small smile. \"That was before I saw the size of the house.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I rested a hand on her shoulder and squeezed it gently, offering a smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been telling me this whole car ride that we&rsquo;ll be fine, so we will be. Let&rsquo;s just go in and get this over and done with, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded, breathing out slowly. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I grinned, letting go of her shoulder. &ldquo;Awesome! Now pretend you love me and let&rsquo;s go make my mum not hate me anymore!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie and I went to the door with our gifts - flowers and chocolates - and knocked. Brie nudged me in the shoulder gently and I looked to her, only to feel at ease when she smiled at me. Almost three years into our friendship and she always knew how to make me feel better.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened and some sort of butler opened it, his eyes boring into us both. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Hi, er, I&rsquo;m Y/N Y/L/N, here to see my mum and Isaac?&ldquo; I spoke, stupidly unsure of myself because of his detached expression. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked, looking between us both, before motioning for us to follow him. Brie and I stepped inside as he shut the door. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"They have a butler,&rdquo; Brie mumbled in my ear, with disbelief. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Yup.&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We both followed the butler down the vast entrance, Brie taking it all in from beside me. I would have smiled at how cute she looked, looking around like a kid in a candy store, but I was too busy fretting about how this evening would go down. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Miss, Y/L/N, your daughter and her girlfriend are here,&rdquo; the butler finally spoke as we entered the living-area. My mum and Isaac were sat beside one another, chatting. When they saw us, they both stood up, smiles on their faces. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Girls, lovely to see you both again,&ldquo; my mum said, glancing at her watch. \"And not a minute late. Wonderful.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a small smile. &ldquo;You, too, mum. We got you some chocolates and flowers. I thought I&rsquo;d give you your wedding gift next week, and we didn&rsquo;t want to show up empty-handed now, so yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I held out the gifts, but my mum merely glanced at the butler, who took them from my hands and left the room. I cocked my head to Brie, giving her a 'help me&rsquo; look, to which she cleared her throat and looked to my mum with a smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thank you for inviting us, Y/M/N,&ldquo; she said, stepping forward to put out her hand. \"And you must be Isaac! It&rsquo;s a pleasure, sir.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They both shook Brie&rsquo;s hand before she stepped back beside me, nudging me a little. I moved forward and shook their hands, too. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Come here, Y/N,&ldquo; Isaac said with a grin, pulling me into a hug. \"You don&rsquo;t come round nearly as much as I&rsquo;d like. How are you?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled genuinely. I liked Isaac. He always made an effort and I could see he cared about my mum and I. Though, I never understood how he and my mum didn&rsquo;t clash. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m good,&ldquo; I said, taking a seat opposite him and my mum. Brie sat beside me as I continued. \"And you? I must congratulate you both, again. I&rsquo;m really happy for you.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Another butler, different from the last, walked in, setting two cups of tea in front of us on the coffee table. Sugar, milk and biscuits were all there and I immediately helped myself. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac looked to my mum with lovesick eyes before wrapping an arm around her waist. &ldquo;Thank you, Y/N. Enough about us though. Ever since your mother told me about you having a girlfriend yesterday, I couldn&rsquo;t wait for tonight!&rdquo; His eyes went to Brie. &ldquo;Such a pleasure to meet you, Brie.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I watched both Isaac and my mum as they seemed genuinely excited for me. Isaac always was to be fair, but my mum rarely cared enough about my life, so to see her glancing at me with pride in her eyes made me feel, well, noticed.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"&hellip;I&rsquo;m an actress,&ldquo; I tuned back in to see Brie explaining to them both. \"I&rsquo;m currently training for this new film called Captain Marvel.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"An actress? Wow!&ldquo; my mum said, an impressed smile on her face. She glanced at me before saying, \"I didn&rsquo;t think Y/N would ever end up with someone that successful!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I closed my eyes, internalising my annoyance. Of course. I opened my eyes again when I felt Brie&rsquo;s hand in mine, squeezing it gently. I glanced at her, but she was forcing a small smile in my mum&rsquo;s direction. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N is just as successful, Y/M/N,&ldquo; she said. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum didn&rsquo;t even recognise the hint of sass in Brie&rsquo;s voice nor the fake smile on her lips, instead laughing as she looked at me, then to Brie again. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"So, what films might I have seen you in, Brie, dear? Anything big?&rdquo; she asked, completely dismissing Brie&rsquo;s previous comment. Isaac looked uncomfortable beside my mum, but said nothing. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie clenched her jaw and I knew words were going to spill from her mouth in defence of me, but I couldn&rsquo;t let her do that and ruin this, so I interrupted instead.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nothing you&rsquo;ve heard of mum,&ldquo; I said, earning my mum&rsquo;s attention. \"Not your taste of films.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum nodded, sipping her tea. &ldquo;Very well. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have a look at one of your films, Brie. What&rsquo;s your full name, dear?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie glanced at me, before saying, &ldquo;Brie Larson in the credits. But my name is actually Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum nodded, sipping the last of her tea, before standing up. &ldquo;Amazing. I&rsquo;ll look you up&hellip; So, is everyone finished? Dinner should be ready now.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well actually I-&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Come on, Y/N, hurry,&rdquo; my mum cut me off, before grabbing Isaac&rsquo;s hand and dragging him to the dining room. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I pursed my lips and put my half full cup of tea on the coffee table. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N, are you sure you want to do this?&ldquo; Brie asked, turning to face my way with a concerned expression on her face. \"I hate to say this, but your mum is-&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Rude, big-headed and judgemental?&ldquo; I filled in for her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well, yeah,&rdquo; Brie agreed, her voice low. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like how she speaks to you. Why would you want to pretend to have me as a girlfriend to impress someone who treats you horribly?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I stood up, shrugging. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my mum, Brie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Who is proud of you for something that isn&rsquo;t true,&ldquo; she pointed out, standing up beside me. \"You know I&rsquo;ll help you out with this, Y/N, but as your friend, I think you should just stand up to your mum and tell her the truth. If she doesn&rsquo;t love you for what you&rsquo;ve got, what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I sighed, meeting Brie&rsquo;s eyes. They were a warm brown colour, with flecks of gold shining through and reminding me who I was. I wasn&rsquo;t a liar. Even for my mum&rsquo;s approval. She was right. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Okay, come on,&ldquo; I said, grabbing her hand and leading her to the dining room. I saw Isaac and my mum taking a seat beside each other and had no choice but to sit opposite them with Brie. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"We&rsquo;re having salmon,&rdquo; my mum said as the waiters brought out the food. &ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"It&rsquo;s fine, thank you,&ldquo; Brie said with a smile, before looking to me with a 'tell her&rsquo; look. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I swallowed the lump in my throat before looking to my mum. \"Mum, I need to tell you something. About Brie and I.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum nodded, though I could see she wasn&rsquo;t really listening as she watched the waiters put food on her plate. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I thought, well&hellip; you assumed Brie and I were together because of the photo at our flat,&ldquo; I began, and my mum glanced at me, \"but you didn&rsquo;t listen to me. I was trying to tell you that&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where is this going, Y/N?&ldquo; my mum asked, raising an eyebrow. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Let her speak, dear,&rdquo; Isaac said, giving her a knowing look. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am, but she&rsquo;s taking her time getting her words out,&ldquo; my mum replied, before staring at me. &nbsp;\"What is it? Are you breaking up? Are you cheating on her? Are you even together?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I widened my eyes, a little hurt that she&rsquo;d think I would do that, specifically the cheating thing. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, I mean, she&rsquo;s an actress,&ldquo; my mum continued, as if each word wasn&rsquo;t a punch to the gut. \"It&rsquo;s a little far fetched that you&rsquo;d be with someone like Brie.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/M/N, you should stop there,&ldquo; Isaac said sternly, before glancing at me apologetically. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You really think I&rsquo;m that much of a failure that I couldn&rsquo;t be with someone like Brie?&rdquo; I asked with disbelief. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how little you think of me, mum?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N&ndash;\"</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Why is it so hard to believe I could have a girlfriend like her?&ldquo; I questioned her, growing angry. \"Because she&rsquo;s beautiful? Talented? Successful? Everything I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N, you&rsquo;re making a scene,&ldquo; my mum said, glaring at me. \"This shouldn&rsquo;t be a discussion.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"But it is,&ldquo; I said, the words flying from my mouth. \"I&rsquo;m here, telling you I have a girlfriend, and you&rsquo;re still doubting me! Well, guess what, mum, she <i>is </i>my girlfriend whether you believe it or not.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I could feel Brie&rsquo;s eyes on me and I wasn&rsquo;t really sure why I&rsquo;d said that. Anger? Annoyance? I was fed up, that was for sure. With my mum thinking so little of me. I was going to prove to her that I <i>could</i> have someone like Brie, even if it wasn&rsquo;t real, technically. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Then what did you want to tell me, Y/N?&ldquo; my mum asked, raising her eyebrows. \"I know you&rsquo;re with Brie. You&rsquo;ve obviously proven me wrong. So, what else is there to say?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I clenched my jaw. &ldquo;Nothing. Let&rsquo;s just eat&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded and dug into her food. Isaac looked out of place as he did the same. I glanced at Brie, who&rsquo;s expression I couldn&rsquo;t exactly read. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"So, erm, is the food okay, girls?&ldquo; Isaac asked, trying to make conversation. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I picked at my plate. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Delicious, thank you,&rdquo; Brie spoke up, sensing I wouldn&rsquo;t. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You know, you never told me how you both met,&ldquo; Isaac continued, and I glanced up at him to see an apologetic smile on his lips, as if he were trying to make up for what my mum had said. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciated his gesture and couldn&rsquo;t help but give him a small smile in return. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"We met just over two years ago,&rdquo; I said, glancing at Brie, who smiled encouragingly my way. &ldquo;Brie was looking for a flat and I was looking for a flatmate.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I came over to check out the flat and I met Y/N then,&ldquo; Brie added, a genuine smile on her lips. \"She was lovely. She showed me the flat, making jokes about everything. Gosh, I&rsquo;d never laughed so hard at a flat viewing.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I chuckled, looking at her. &ldquo;You thought I was funny?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded, meeting my eyes. &ldquo;Why did you think I had to step outside for a moment? I was crying with laughter.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I thought I&rsquo;d freaked you out,&ldquo; I said honestly, a grin on my lips and any annoyance towards my mum momentarily forgotten. \"It worked out though.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I ended up moving in with her, obviously,&ldquo; Brie finished, looking to Isaac, and my mum who was studying us both curiously. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"And then you asked her out?&rdquo; Isaac guessed with an amused smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot about that bit, so nodded, going along with it. &ldquo;Yeah, sure. Brie asked me out and I said yeah.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I glanced at Brie and saw her smiling to herself. When her eyes met mine, I saw a sparkle of disappointment in her eyes. I wondered what was up, but Isaac spoke again, so I couldn&rsquo;t give it much thought. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"So, you&rsquo;ve been dating for almost three years then?&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I hesitated. \"Er, yeah, that&rsquo;s what I said, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac chuckled, though looked at me with a questioning glance. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Three years in a relationship and you never once mentioned it to me,&ldquo; my mum spoke, not looking away from her plate. \"Lovely, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You only ever talk about yourself when you call me,&ldquo; I retorted, my grip tightening on my fork. \"Maybe I never got the chance to mention it.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum finally looked up, her eyes narrowing in my direction. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"What Y/N means to say is that she never found the right moment,&ldquo; Brie said, resting a hand on mine and squeezing it gently. She gave me a pointed look before looking to my mum with an easygoing smile. \"She&rsquo;s a private one, as you obviously know. I never pushed her to talk about us to you, but now you know and she&rsquo;s relieved that you do.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Even though you think I&rsquo;m incapable&hellip;&ldquo; I mumbled, earning a glare off Brie. I sighed and looked to my mum. \"Yeah, what Brie said.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum sighed. &ldquo;Well, it seems you&rsquo;re both in a committed relationship which is all a mother can ask for.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Exactly,&ldquo; Isaac agreed, sensing the tension that was still present in the air. \"Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure your cousins are excited to see you again, and meet Brie, Y/N!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I groaned loudly. &ldquo;Oh, god&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N, be nice,&ldquo; my mum warned. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Cousins?&rdquo; Brie asked, looking to me with a raised eyebrow. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"My mum&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s kids,&ldquo; I explained. \"Also lawyers and very annoying.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N!&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"What? It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; I said to my mum, before looking back to Brie. &ldquo;They debate <i>everything</i>.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"So do you, Y/N,&ldquo; my mum argued, an amused smile on her lips. \"You would&rsquo;ve made a fine lawyer if you&rsquo;d gone down that route.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Oh, great, here we go&hellip;&ldquo; I mumbled, paying attention to my food because I knew she&rsquo;d started up on another never-ending rant about my career choice. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N would have excelled as a lawyer,&rdquo; my mum spoke regretfully. You&rsquo;d think I was a drug dealer with the way she was talking about me. &ldquo;She has the brain and I have the money and connections. It was all set up for her, to go to law school, but of course she chose differently.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Doing something she loves, though, Y/M/N,&ldquo; Isaac inputted, which I appreciated. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thanks,&rdquo; I said, nodding his way. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"She would have loved law, too,&ldquo; my mum kept on going. \"She could still help people and do something for society, like she wants to.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie bit her lip and looked at me, unsure what to say. I shook my head, hoping she knew I wasn&rsquo;t expecting her to say anything. This was way too much to throw out there on a first parent-partner meeting, fake or not. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"&hellip;like you, Brie. Did you always know you wanted to be an actress?&ldquo; my mum asked her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie finished sipping her water, biding her time probably, before saying, \"Yes, actually. My parents were really supportive of it, thankfully.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"That must be nice,&ldquo; I commented with an urge to laugh, making Brie stifle a smile. My mum merely rolled her eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"It worked out though, despite the tough times,&rdquo; Brie continued, trying not to laugh. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"And this Captain Marvel film, you said you were preparing for it,&ldquo; my mum said, \"what does that consist of?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a superhero film, so I&rsquo;m training at the gym. I&rsquo;ve got a personal trainer.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"If only Y/N would go to the gym once in a while,&ldquo; my mum said, making me roll my eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thanks, mum,&rdquo; I said, before looking to Brie. &ldquo;You were saying?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She pursed her lips, suppressing a smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it really. We start filming at the end of the year, so I&rsquo;m just focusing on my workout at the moment. It&rsquo;s strenuous, but it&rsquo;s paying off.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re definitely in great shape,&ldquo; my mum complimented her, making Brie do that scrunchy shy smile she had. My mum glanced at me, adding, \"Unlike some people.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s pretty much how the rest of the evening went &ndash; my mum loving Brie, making fun of me and Isaac trying to be a peacemaker. I was glad when it was over. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I can&rsquo;t wait to see you girls next week,&ldquo; Isaac said at the doorway, a smile on his lips. \"It was lovely meeting you, Brie. Thank you for making our Y/N happy.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie smiled, glancing at me, which gave me goosebumps oddly enough. She had a really pretty smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Anytime, Isaac,&ldquo; she said to him. \"Congratulations to both of you again.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Bye!&ldquo; Isaac said, waving with my mum. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie and I headed to her car and I was glad when she set off. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"That was&hellip; <i>interesting</i>,&rdquo; Brie spoke first, smiling with amusement. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m sorry,&ldquo; I said, sighing. \"I know I was supposed to tell the truth, but god, my mum gets on my nerves so much. I felt like I had to prove her wrong and before I knew it, I was&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Proving her wrong, I saw,&ldquo; Brie finished, now laughing. \"It&rsquo;s fine, I get it. No offence, but what your mum said&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t nice. I don&rsquo;t blame you for proving her wrong. You could <i>easily </i>get a, well, a girl like me, I guess.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thanks, Brie,&ldquo; I said sincerely, smiling her way. \"That means a lot.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Hey, I&rsquo;m not finished,&ldquo; she said, glancing at me before looking back to the road. \"You were mean, too. To yourself. All that shit you said about me being successful and beautiful and talented? You&rsquo;re all of those things and I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Brie, I&ndash;\"</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"No,&ldquo; she cut me off, frowning. \"Just because your mum puts you down doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to, too. I&rsquo;m not faking this if you&rsquo;re going to keep doing that. Okay?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded. &ldquo;Okay. Sorry.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Don&rsquo;t apologise to me,&ldquo; she said, her voice softer now. \"Just be nicer to yourself.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I kept quiet, studying Brie. She was concentrating on driving, her lips pursed and her eyes staring out ahead. A whole evening spent with my mum and she still looked as good as new. Beautiful and anyone would agree. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re a better fake girlfriend than some of the real girlfriends I&rsquo;ve had,&ldquo; I admitted, chuckling. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie shook her head, smiling a little. \"Someone&rsquo;s gotta make sure you don&rsquo;t go insane.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well I&rsquo;m lucky it&rsquo;s you,&ldquo; I said gratefully, moving forward and giving her a kiss on the cheek. \"Thanks.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t reply, so I got comfortable and looked out the window, wondering what next week would bring. </p>",
