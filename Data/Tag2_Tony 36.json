T\u2019challa appeared along with Okyere, Shuri and the tribes. Other portals started opening up, Tony scanned every single one, he slowly started to panic when he didn\u2019t see Y/N. He did sigh in relief when he saw Peter come out of the portals. Tony looked back at T\u2019challa. T\u2019challa smiled at the man and moved to the side. There she was, staring at Peter and Peter staring back at her. Y/N looked around and was met with her father\u2019s brown eyes filled with tears, her eyes filled with tears and she smiled at him. Tony smiled back at his daughter. Y/N wanted to make her way towards him but was stopped by T\u2019challa, Y/N looked at him and he handed her a shield along with a sword. Steve stood in front of the group.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cIs that everyone?\u201d Dr. Strange asked</p><p>\u201cWhat you wanted more?\u201d Wong asked annoyed</p><p>Scott appeared from the rubble dropping Rhodey, Rocket, and Bruce. Y/N smiled at her uncles. Pepper appeared in her suit, she turned back to look for Y/N and she smiled a let out a sob. Y/N months</p><p>\u2018'I\u2019m ok.\u201d Pepper nodded turning her attention back to Thano\u2019s army.</p><p>\u201cAVENGERS.\u201d</p><p>Everyone took a ready stance.</p><p>\u201cASSEMBLE.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>They were off. \u00a0Y/N could feel her legs burn as she ran through Thano\u2019s men. Nat taught her how to find, she always told her you may never know when it might come in handy. Tony and Pepper fought alongside each other, he landed on the floor blasting the aliens when he got hit and smashed into the rocks. Tony tried to fire at him when a web caught onto the creature and pulled him away, Scott finished it off by stepping on him. Peter looked around for Y/N when he found her, he shot his web at her and pulled her towards him. Peter swung them to Tony, he lifted him up and Tony\u2019s masked come off</p><p>\u201cHey, holy cow. You\u2019re not going to believe what\u2019s been going on. Do you remember when we were in space?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes filled with tears</p><p>\u201cAnd I got all dusty? And I must of past out cause I woke up and you were gone, but Dr. Strange was there and he was like it\u2019s been 5 years come on they need us and then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time.\u201d Peter started doing the hand motions. Tony stumbled his way </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Peter asked. Tony wrapped his arms around the boy and Peter did the same. Tony could feel the tears running down his face</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026oh\u2026 This is nice.\u201d Tony hugged Peter harder. Tony pulled away from Peter and looked at his daughter</p><p>\u201cHi, dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBug.\u201d Y/N cried as she ran into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d</p><p>The two pulled away from each other and Tony caressed her face. Y/N let out a small laugh</p><p>\u201cDad, you look older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I look great.\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Y/N turned to Peter checking his face and sighed in relief that he wasn\u2019t hurt. She turned back to her father and look at the cut on his head</p><p>\u201cYou gotta be careful old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N I need help.\u201d Y/N turned back and looked at Shuri</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d Her dad said, Y/N nodded and ran towards Shuri</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you like my daughter. Take care of her. Treat her right.\u201d Peter blushed</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my blessing to date. Just take care of each other. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s get this son of a bitch.\u201d </p><p>Clint ran through the battle</p><p>\u201cHey, Cap? What do you want me to do with this damn thing?\u201d Clint motioned to the gauntlet.</p><p>\u201cGet those stones far away as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Bruce yelled</p><p>\u201cWe need to get them back where they came from.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.\u201d Tony replied</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Scott shrunk down</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t our only time machine.\u201d The car alarm went off. Steve looked around</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone see an ugly brown van?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2019re not going to like where it\u2019s parked,\u201d Valkyrie replied.</p><p>\u201cScott how long till it works?\u201d Tony asked</p><p>\u201cUmm, maybe 10 minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet it started, we\u2019ll get the stones to you,\u201d Steve replied.</p><p>Tony landed in front of Dr. Strange and asked</p><p>\u201cHey, you said out of 14 million we win 1. Is this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you it won\u2019t happen.\u201d Tony nodded.</p><p>Y/N could feel her body giving out, but she had to continue, she couldn\u2019t stop. She had to keep fighting for her family. </p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d Thaos turned towards Clint, he made his way over and Tony made his way to stop him. </p><p>\u201cClint, give it to me.\u201d Clint passed the stones to T'challa and he ran. Thanos knocked T'challa over and Wanda appeared in front of Thanos. Y/N looked at Wanda</p><p>\u201cOh shit, she\u2019s pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Pepper replied</p><p>T'challa made his way back to the stones and Peter took it out of his hands.</p><p>\u201cActivate instant kill.\u201d </p><p>Peter kept giving himself a pep talk</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter?\u201d Y/N asked</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you got this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo yeah, totally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes</p><p>\u201cMen\u2026\u201d She mumbled</p><p>She made her way to help Peter, she killed every single alien that headed her way.</p><p>Thanos yelled out for his minion to rain fire, next thing Y/N feels is being knocked to the ground</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d Peter made his way and dragged her out of the firing zone and hid by a rock, Peter covered her with his body as the lasers kept shooting. Then it stopped, the shots turn to the sky</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y what are they shooting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething just entered the upper atmosphere.\u201d</p><p>Then the ship went down, Carol made her entrance and everyone smiled. Y/N groaned and coughed, Peter looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey\u2026 You okay?\u201d Y/N opened her eyes to meet with Peter\u2019s brown ones, now that she got a closer look they were the color of the earth, but just as rain hits, they were warm and inviting, they made her feel like home. Peter could feel Y/N\u2019s breathing getting heavier, he looked at her with worry.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you ok?\u201d She blinked</p><p>\u201cYeah..I\u2019m fine.\u201d They continued to just stare at each other until they heard a cough. The two teens turned their attention to the person. Carol stood in front of the teens.</p><p>\u201cHi\u2026 I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N Stark. Umm Pete, you can get off of me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right.\u201d Peter quickly stood up</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Y/N shook her head and stood</p><p>\u201cHi, Peter Parker, Miss Stark. You got something for me?\u201d Peter grabbed the gauntlet and looked towards the army coming after them</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how you\u2019re going to get it through that.\u201d</p><p>Wanda, Valkyrie, Pepper, Okoye, Mantis, Shuri, Hope, Gamora and Nebula appeared</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry she\u2019s got help.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked at Peter</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cIs that because of me?\u201d Peter shook his head</p><p>\u201cNo, got it earlier.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to patch you up.\u201d Peter smiled at her</p><p>\u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They watched as the group of women warriors made their way through the field, then the van exploded. Thanos destroyed the van. The gauntlet landed in front of Tony and Thanos and they fought. Thanos grabbed the gauntlet and Carol stopped him, he tried and tried to get rid of her but he couldn\u2019t then he grabbed the power stone and moved it to his other hand, punching Carol knocking her out. Tony stared at Thanos and looked at Dr. Strange. Strange held up 1 finger. Tony gulped and nodded. Tony stood and grabbed the gauntlet, Thanos kicked Tony away. Thanos smirked</p><p>\u201c I am inevitable.\u201d He snapped his fingers and everyone winced but nothing happened. Tony kneeled and held up his arm, the stones fitting perfectly on his iron suit. Y/N looked at her father</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d she screamed and ran towards him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2026.Am\u2026.Iron\u2026Man.\u201d he snapped his fingers. White, white was all Tony could see, his body felt like it was on fire; he wanted to scream out but he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Y/N screamed and fell to her knees a couple feet away from her father. She watched as Thano\u2019s army turned to dust. Thanos looked around with a defeated look on his face. Y/N laughed through her tears</p><p>\u201cYou. Lost.\u201d Thanos stared at her, he slowly made his way over to sit on the ruble and turned to dust. Y/N stood and made her way to her father, Rhodey and Peter appeared next to her. Rhodey caressed Tony\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark. Hey,\u201d Peter said in a shaky voice</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, can you hear me? It\u2019s Peter.\u201d Tony said nothing and stared at the boy. Peter\u2019s voice became strained and tears slowly ran down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWe won, Mr. Stark. We won Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir, you did it. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Don't\u2026\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t even finish his sentence, Y/N placed a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder and he moved over.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2026 Hey dad.\u201d Tony looked at his daughter, Y/N could see a flash of sadness in his eyes</p><p>\u201cBug..\u201d He barely managed to say</p><p>\u201cI love you..\u201d Y/N said as she caressed his cheek</p><p>\u201cI\u2026.love\u2026you\u2026forever\u2026.and\u2026.always.\u201d Y/N let out a choked sob and smiled</p><p>\u201cForever and always.\u201d she kissed her dad\u2019s cheek one last time. Pepper placed her hand on Y/N shoulder and she moved to sit next to Peter. Peter wrapped his arms around her and they both silently cried while holding each other.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tony turned and looked at Pepper</p><p>\u201cPep..\u201d She placed her hand over his</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife functions critical.\u201d Tony smiled at her and looked at his daughter, tears filled his eyes and he gave her a reassuring smile, Y/N gave him one back.</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Tony looked away</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He turned his gaze back to Pepper</p><p>\u201cHmm..\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d Pepper smiled and Tony looked away. All he could think about was them, Pepper, Peter, Y/N, and Morgan. He kept them safe, he kept everyone safe, he felt at peace. Tony smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou can rest now,\u201d Pepper said while running her fingers through his hair and Tony breathed in one final breath and then the light went off. Pepper cried and kissed his cheek, everyone around them started to cry. Y/N felt her heart shatter into a million pieces. Peter just sat there and held onto the broken girl. Steve made his way towards Pepper and hugged her. Y/N unwrapped herself from Peter, stood while holding his hand and made their way to Steve and Pepper, they hugged. They all stood in silence, all you could hear were the sounds of whimpers. Steve made his way and lifted Tony up, he carried him away from the battle and carried him home.

Is this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you it won\u2019t happen.\u201d Tony nodded.</p><p>Y/N could feel her body giving out, but she had to continue, she couldn\u2019t stop. She had to keep fighting for her family. </p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d Thaos turned towards Clint, he made his way over and Tony made his way to stop him. </p><p>\u201cClint, give it to me.\u201d Clint passed the stones to T'challa and he ran. Thanos knocked T'challa over and Wanda appeared in front of Thanos. Y/N looked at Wanda</p><p>\u201cOh shit, she\u2019s pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Pepper replied</p><p>T'challa made his way back to the stones and Peter took it out of his hands.</p><p>\u201cActivate instant kill.\u201d </p><p>Peter kept giving himself a pep talk</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter?\u201d Y/N asked</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you got this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo yeah, totally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes</p><p>\u201cMen\u2026\u201d She mumbled</p><p>She made her way to help Peter, she killed every single alien that headed her way.</p><p>Thanos yelled out for his minion to rain fire, next thing Y/N feels is being knocked to the ground</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d Peter made his way and dragged her out of the firing zone and hid by a rock, Peter covered her with his body as the lasers kept shooting. Then it stopped, the shots turn to the sky</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y what are they shooting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething just entered the upper atmosphere.\u201d</p><p>Then the ship went down, Carol made her entrance and everyone smiled. Y/N groaned and coughed, Peter looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey\u2026 You okay?\u201d Y/N opened her eyes to meet with Peter\u2019s brown ones, now that she got a closer look they were the color of the earth, but just as rain hits, they were warm and inviting, they made her feel like home. Peter could feel Y/N\u2019s breathing getting heavier, he looked at her with worry.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you ok?\u201d She blinked</p><p>\u201cYeah..I\u2019m fine.\u201d They continued to just stare at each other until they heard a cough. The two teens turned their attention to the person. Carol stood in front of the teens.</p><p>\u201cHi\u2026 I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N Stark. Umm Pete, you can get off of me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right.\u201d Peter quickly stood up</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Y/N shook her head and stood</p><p>\u201cHi, Peter Parker, Miss Stark. You got something for me?\u201d Peter grabbed the gauntlet and looked towards the army coming after them</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how you\u2019re going to get it through that.\u201d</p><p>Wanda, Valkyrie, Pepper, Okoye, Mantis, Shuri, Hope, Gamora and Nebula appeared</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry she\u2019s got help.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked at Peter</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cIs that because of me?\u201d Peter shook his head</p><p>\u201cNo, got it earlier.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to patch you up.\u201d Peter smiled at her</p><p>\u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They watched as the group of women warriors made their way through the field, then the van exploded. Thanos destroyed the van. The gauntlet landed in front of Tony and Thanos and they fought. Thanos grabbed the gauntlet and Carol stopped him, he tried and tried to get rid of her but he couldn\u2019t then he grabbed the power stone and moved it to his other hand, punching Carol knocking her out. Tony stared at Thanos and looked at Dr. Strange. Strange held up 1 finger. Tony gulped and nodded. Tony stood and grabbed the gauntlet, Thanos kicked Tony away. Thanos smirked</p><p>\u201c I am inevitable.\u201d He snapped his fingers and everyone winced but nothing happened. Tony kneeled and held up his arm, the stones fitting perfectly on his iron suit. Y/N looked at her father</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d she screamed and ran towards him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2026.Am\u2026.Iron\u2026Man.\u201d he snapped his fingers. White, white was all Tony could see, his body felt like it was on fire; he wanted to scream out but he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Y/N screamed and fell to her knees a couple feet away from her father. She watched as Thano\u2019s army turned to dust. Thanos looked around with a defeated look on his face. Y/N laughed through her tears</p><p>\u201cYou. Lost.\u201d Thanos stared at her, he slowly made his way over to sit on the ruble and turned to dust. Y/N stood and made her way to her father, Rhodey and Peter appeared next to her. Rhodey caressed Tony\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark. Hey,\u201d Peter said in a shaky voice</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, can you hear me? It\u2019s Peter.\u201d Tony said nothing and stared at the boy. Peter\u2019s voice became strained and tears slowly ran down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWe won, Mr. Stark. We won Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir, you did it. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Don't\u2026\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t even finish his sentence, Y/N placed a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder and he moved over.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2026 Hey dad.\u201d Tony looked at his daughter, Y/N could see a flash of sadness in his eyes</p><p>\u201cBug..\u201d He barely managed to say</p><p>\u201cI love you..\u201d Y/N said as she caressed his cheek</p><p>\u201cI\u2026.love\u2026you\u2026forever\u2026.and\u2026.always.\u201d Y/N let out a choked sob and smiled</p><p>\u201cForever and always.\u201d she kissed her dad\u2019s cheek one last time. Pepper placed her hand on Y/N shoulder and she moved to sit next to Peter. Peter wrapped his arms around her and they both silently cried while holding each other.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tony turned and looked at Pepper</p><p>\u201cPep..\u201d She placed her hand over his</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife functions critical.\u201d Tony smiled at her and looked at his daughter, tears filled his eyes and he gave her a reassuring smile, Y/N gave him one back.</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Tony looked away</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He turned his gaze back to Pepper</p><p>\u201cHmm..\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d Pepper smiled and Tony looked away. All he could think about was them, Pepper, Peter, Y/N, and Morgan. He kept them safe, he kept everyone safe, he felt at peace. Tony smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou can rest now,\u201d Pepper said while running her fingers through his hair and Tony breathed in one final breath and then the light went off. Pepper cried and kissed his cheek, everyone around them started to cry. Y/N felt her heart shatter into a million pieces. Peter just sat there and held onto the broken girl. Steve made his way towards Pepper and hugged her. Y/N unwrapped herself from Peter, stood while holding his hand and made their way to Steve and Pepper, they hugged. They all stood in silence, all you could hear were the sounds of whimpers. Steve made his way and lifted Tony up, he carried him away from the battle and carried him home. Everyone quietly followed the Captain.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Tags:</b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mic7Wka-xzCrLKU1pBbb0PQ\">@ziggyspurplehaze</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpNDHuGb1om0DiJAPoJWECA\">@ghost-brocolli</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBYZXaBmOngftAlUtwDspg\">@a-sweet-little-fangirl</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIh3QlH_jDwMU00n6iB2U9Q\">@imafreakingtaco</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM2SqDZ_e-Qwi-xn76tnhmQ\">@karlitabi-rrito</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOB4PFGXood-A82FZM314fg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOB4PFGXood-A82FZM314fg\">@rexorangecouny</a></b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9HZpJnCKVuzrTEDDbeIJ2w\">@outsider-underwater</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\">@alisoncdariel</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQsBbKFE4RTQxuIRv2X79XA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQsBbKFE4RTQxuIRv2X79XA\">@too-involved</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-mEsGpzinOJ73JoDtl-0mA\">@laurxn-robinson</a></p>",

All he could think about was them, Pepper, Peter, Y/N, and Morgan. He kept them safe, he kept everyone safe, he felt at peace. Tony smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou can rest now,\u201d Pepper said while running her fingers through his hair and Tony breathed in one final breath and then the light went off. Pepper cried and kissed his cheek, everyone around them started to cry. Y/N felt her heart shatter into a million pieces. Peter just sat there and held onto the broken girl. Steve made his way towards Pepper and hugged her. Y/N unwrapped herself from Peter, stood while holding his hand and made their way to Steve and Pepper, they hugged. They all stood in silence, all you could hear were the sounds of whimpers. Steve made his way and lifted Tony up, he carried him away from the battle and carried him home.

Tony and Pepper fought alongside each other, he landed on the floor blasting the aliens when he got hit and smashed into the rocks. Tony tried to fire at him when a web caught onto the creature and pulled him away, Scott finished it off by stepping on him.
