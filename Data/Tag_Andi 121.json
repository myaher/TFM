        "answer": "<p>Oooo! Good one!! </p><p>*********************</p><p>Summary: Cyrus asked Tj to hangout after school. Cyrus thought Tj would say no, but he didn\u2019t. So Cyrus is now in full panic mode. But once things started to get settled in, a huge snow storm rolls around and Tj is now stuck at Cyrus\u2019s house. </p><p>Lets begin!!</p><p>**********************</p><p>\u201cYou got the muffins? Right?? You didn\u2019t forget the muffins mom, did you?!\u201d Cyrus was nervously walking around in his kitchen. </p><p>Earlier that day, he asked Tj if he wanted to come to his house after school to hangout, but Cyrus thought he would say no and come up with some excuse. But little did Cyrus know, Tj said \u201cyes!! I\u2019m more than happy too!\u201d After he said yes, Cyrus was in full panic mode the whole day. Yes, Tj has hungout with him before, but that was with friends. It\u2019s never just been him and Tj. </p><p>\u201cYes hunny. I got them. Don\u2019t worry!!\u201d Cyrus\u2019s mom said trying to calm him down. \u201cYour so worried about these muffins, and Tj coming over. Your acting like your girlfriend is coming. Chill out bud!\u201d His mom said back.</p><p>Cyrus blushed. He totally forgot his mom doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s gay, and the fact that he did have a crush on Tj, wasn\u2019t helping. He needed to make tonight count. He wanted to make Tj happy. Though he didn\u2019t know what Tjs sexuality was, he still needed to make his best impression. Just Incase.</p><p>***************************</p><p>\u201cChocolate muffins!! All to ourselves?! Sweet!!\u201d Tj said as he walked into Cyrus\u2019s kitchen. \u201cNow I don\u2019t need to scare any kids off for you!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus has a huge smile and was trying so hard to not squeal with excitement. </p><p>\u201cSix chocolate muffins, three for each of us. We\u2019re the real VIP.\u201d Cyrus said back. </p><p>Tj laughed. </p><p>Both boys sat on the counter and ate a muffin while they discussed their days. But during that, the tv went off with a special weather advisory. </p><p>\u201cWinter storm advisory. Huge winter storm coming in tonight around 7pm. also high winds. Don\u2019t go outside. Stay inside if possible.\u201d The news guy reported. </p><p>Both Cyrus and Tj looked at each other, then the time. It was already 6:30pm.</p><p>\u201cWow. It\u2019s really coming.\u201d Cyrus\u2019s mom said walking into the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cShould I go home now?\u201d Tj asked. \u201cI can ask my mom to pick me up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNO!!\u201d Cyrus yelled. </p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to yell. But he didn\u2019t want Tj to leave, he was having too much fun. </p><p>Both Tj and his mom looked at him confused. Cyrus\u2019s hands started to sweat. </p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, if it\u2019s okay with you mom, can he spend the night?\u201d He asked. </p><p>This was the perfect and right time to ask. He always wanted Tj to stay the night. </p><p>\u201cOoo that would actually be pretty cool!\u201d Tj said. \u201cThere\u2019s this scary movie I wanted to watch&hellip; the classic, but new one, IT!! I haven\u2019t watched it yet, But I\u2019ve been wanting too! And your the perfect guy to watch it with.\u201d </p><p>Even though Cyrus hated scary movies, he loved that Tj got so excited. </p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with your mom, our house is your house!\u201d Cyrus\u2019s mom replied. \u201cBut Cyrus hunny, I thought you didn\u2019t like scary movi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhhhhaaaattt?! Mom!! I was 10!! I\u2019m over that!! I love them!!\u201d Cyrus said to his mom. </p><p>\u201cUh, didn\u2019t you just say last week you didn\u2019t want to go see the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTj! You should call your mom now. Just to make sure just Incase you can\u2019t!\u201d Cyrus said interrupting his mom.</p><p>\u201cHaha okay! Will do! Brb!\u201d</p><p>(Sorry for moving so fast, I\u2019m trying to keep this story short since I have a limit:) )</p><p>****************************</p><p>Later on that night, both boys were in Cyrus\u2019s basement getting ready to watch it.</p><p>\u201cPopcorn?\u201d Cyrus asked.</p><p>\u201cCheck.\u201d Tj replied. \u201cDrinks?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked around. \u201cCheck!!\u201d He said back. \u201cBlankets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck!!\u201d Tj replied. \u201cAnd last but not least&hellip; chocolate muffin number three?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHa! Check!\u201d Cyrus said back cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cAlright!! Ready to watch the movie?\u201d Cyrus said as he held up the remote. </p><p>Cyrus wasn\u2019t. He was scared for his life, but he wanted to make Tj happy. So he took a huge breath and shook his head. </p><p>Tj pressed the play button on the remote. The movie begun. Cyrus so far was okay, \u2018maybe this isn\u2019t so scary after all.\u2019 He said to himself. But then when the character Gorgie went to the sewer to find pennywise, Cyrus\u2019s hands started to sweat. He couldn\u2019t scream. He couldn\u2019t embarrass himself.</p><p>He looked over at Tj and had the smallest hope that he was also scared and they could just tune it off, but Tj was so in to it and not scared one bit. Cyrus looked back to the tv.</p><p>Pennywise started to open his mouth to take the kids arm, that\u2019s when Cyrus couldn\u2019t take it. He started to shake, and hid his face. Tj saw him.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He said as he paused the tv. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah!! Everything\u2019s fine!!\u201d Cyrus said trying to cover up his lie. \u201cI\u2019m- my nose!! It\u2019s cold!!\u201d But he knew that didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Tj said.</p><p>Cyrus looked down with shame. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I am. I totally ruined this night. I\u2019m so sor-\u201d</p><p>Tj stoped Cyrus. \u201cHey! Don\u2019t be! I should be though.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Cyrus asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause, I should\u2019ve asked if you liked scary movies. I totally understand if you don\u2019t want to watch this.\u201d He said back.</p><p>But Cyrus knew he wasn\u2019t just fine. He could hear the disappointment in tjs voice. He knew he wasn\u2019t mad at Cyrus, he was just really excited to watch this movie. Cyrus couldn\u2019t see him like this. \u201cNo. You know what, my friend Andi was scared when she first watched her scary movie, but now she likes them! If she can do it, I can!\u201d Cyrus said with excitement. </p><p>Tj looked at him with a smile. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cYes! I just might accidentally hug you.\u201d Cyrus said with a giggle.</p><p>Tj laughed. \u201cHey! That\u2019s alright. You know&hellip; I\u2019m fine if you want to come closer&hellip; it is kinda cold.\u201d Tj said while blushing.</p><p>Cyrus knew what he meant which made him smile and blush, and now his question was answered. </p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Cyrus said softly. \u201cWhy not!\u201d</p><p>He scooted towards Tj and Tj pressed play. For the rest of the movie, both boys had their scared moments, but laughed them out. </p><p>This was the best sleepover ever.</p>",

So Cyrus is now in full panic mode. But once things started to get settled in, a huge snow storm rolls around and Tj is now stuck at Cyrus\u2019s house. </p><p>Lets begin!!</p><p>**********************</p><p>\u201cYou got the muffins? Right?? You didn\u2019t forget the muffins mom, did you?!\u201d Cyrus was nervously walking around in his kitchen. </p><p>Earlier that day, he asked Tj if he wanted to come to his house after school to hangout, but Cyrus thought he would say no and come up with some excuse. But little did Cyrus know, Tj said \u201cyes!! I\u2019m more than happy too!\u201d After he said yes, Cyrus was in full panic mode the whole day. Yes, Tj has hungout with him before, but that was with friends. It\u2019s never just been him and Tj. </p><p>\u201cYes hunny. I got them. Don\u2019t worry!!\u201d Cyrus\u2019s mom said trying to calm him down. \u201cYour so worried about these muffins, and Tj coming over. Your acting like your girlfriend is coming. Chill out bud!\u201d His mom said back.</p><p>Cyrus blushed. He totally forgot his mom doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s gay, and the fact that he did have a crush on Tj, wasn\u2019t helping. He needed to make tonight count. He wanted to make Tj happy. Though he didn\u2019t know what Tjs sexuality was, he still needed to make his best impression. Just Incase.</p><p>***************************</p><p>\u201cChocolate muffins!! All to ourselves?! Sweet!!\u201d Tj said as he walked into Cyrus\u2019s kitchen. \u201cNow I don\u2019t need to scare any kids off for you!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus has a huge smile and was trying so hard to not squeal with excitement. </p><p>\u201cSix chocolate muffins, three for each of us. We\u2019re the real VIP.\u201d Cyrus said back. </p><p>Tj laughed. </p><p>Both boys sat on the counter and ate a muffin while they discussed their days. But during that, the tv went off with a special weather advisory. </p><p>\u201cWinter storm advisory. Huge winter storm coming in tonight around 7pm. also high winds. Don\u2019t go outside. Stay inside if possible.\u201d The news guy reported. </p><p>Both Cyrus and Tj looked at each other, then the time. It was already 6:30pm.</p><p>\u201cWow. It\u2019s really coming.\u201d Cyrus\u2019s mom said walking into the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cShould I go home now?\u201d Tj asked. \u201cI can ask my mom to pick me up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNO!!\u201d Cyrus yelled. </p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to yell. But he didn\u2019t want Tj to leave, he was having too much fun. </p><p>Both Tj and his mom looked at him confused. Cyrus\u2019s hands started to sweat. </p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, if it\u2019s okay with you mom, can he spend the night?\u201d He asked. </p><p>This was the perfect and right time to ask. He always wanted Tj to stay the night. </p><p>\u201cOoo that would actually be pretty cool!\u201d Tj said. \u201cThere\u2019s this scary movie I wanted to watch\u2026 the classic, but new one, IT!! I haven\u2019t watched it yet, But I\u2019ve been wanting too! And your the perfect guy to watch it with.\u201d </p><p>Even though Cyrus hated scary movies, he loved that Tj got so excited. </p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with your mom, our house is your house!\u201d Cyrus\u2019s mom replied. \u201cBut Cyrus hunny, I thought you didn\u2019t like scary movi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhhhhaaaattt?! Mom!! I was 10!! I\u2019m over that!! I love them!!\u201d Cyrus said to his mom. </p><p>\u201cUh, didn\u2019t you just say last week you didn\u2019t want to go see the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTj! You should call your mom now. Just to make sure just Incase you can\u2019t!\u201d Cyrus said interrupting his mom.</p><p>\u201cHaha okay! Will do! Brb!\u201d</p><p>(Sorry for moving so fast, I\u2019m trying to keep this story short since I have a limit:) )</p><p>****************************</p><p>Later on that night, both boys were in Cyrus\u2019s basement getting ready to watch it.</p><p>\u201cPopcorn?\u201d Cyrus asked.</p><p>\u201cCheck.\u201d Tj replied. \u201cDrinks?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked around. \u201cCheck!!\u201d He said back. \u201cBlankets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck!!\u201d Tj replied. \u201cAnd last but not least\u2026 chocolate muffin number three?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHa! Check!\u201d Cyrus said back cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cAlright!! Ready to watch the movie?\u201d Cyrus said as he held up the remote. </p><p>Cyrus wasn\u2019t. He was scared for his life, but he wanted to make Tj happy. So he took a huge breath and shook his head. </p><p>Tj pressed the play button on the remote. The movie begun. Cyrus so far was okay, \u2018maybe this isn\u2019t so scary after all.\u2019 He said to himself. But then when the character Gorgie went to the sewer to find pennywise, Cyrus\u2019s hands started to sweat. He couldn\u2019t scream. He couldn\u2019t embarrass himself.</p><p>He looked over at Tj and had the smallest hope that he was also scared and they could just tune it off, but Tj was so in to it and not scared one bit. Cyrus looked back to the tv.</p><p>Pennywise started to open his mouth to take the kids arm, that\u2019s when Cyrus couldn\u2019t take it. He started to shake, and hid his face. Tj saw him.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He said as he paused the tv. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah!! Everything\u2019s fine!!\u201d Cyrus said trying to cover up his lie. \u201cI\u2019m- my nose!! It\u2019s cold!!\u201d But he knew that didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Tj said.</p><p>Cyrus looked down with shame. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I am. I totally ruined this night. I\u2019m so sor-\u201d</p><p>Tj stoped Cyrus. \u201cHey! Don\u2019t be! I should be though.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Cyrus asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause, I should\u2019ve asked if you liked scary movies. I totally understand if you don\u2019t want to watch this.\u201d He said back.</p><p>But Cyrus knew he wasn\u2019t just fine. He could hear the disappointment in tjs voice. He knew he wasn\u2019t mad at Cyrus, he was just really excited to watch this movie. Cyrus couldn\u2019t see him like this. \u201cNo. You know what, my friend Andi was scared when she first watched her scary movie, but now she likes them! If she can do it, I can!\u201d Cyrus said with excitement. </p><p>Tj looked at him with a smile. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cYes! I just might accidentally hug you.\u201d Cyrus said with a giggle.</p><p>Tj laughed. \u201cHey! That\u2019s alright. You know\u2026 I\u2019m fine if you want to come closer\u2026 it is kinda cold.\u201d Tj said while blushing.</p><p>Cyrus knew what he meant which made him smile and blush, and now his question was answered. </p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Cyrus said softly. \u201cWhy not!\u201d</p><p>He scooted towards Tj and Tj pressed play. For the rest of the movie, both boys had their scared moments, but laughed them out. </p><p>This was the best sleepover ever.</p>",
