I\u2019m just as confused as you are.\u201d stopping in the middle of the hall with their attention.\u00a0\u201cI knew I still had feelings for Peter when I broke up with him, but I didn\u2019t think I would be having any dreams about him. I guess that\u2019s what happens when my heart doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s over.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThen why did you break up with Peter?\u201d Betty asked curiously.<br/></p><p>\u201cI just needed time to myself to work out some personal things. Peter agreed, so we went our different ways.\u201d you almost started to cry thinking about everything that happened all those weeks ago.<br/></p><p>\u201cBut there is no chance you will get back together?\u201d Betty asked another question out of curiosity.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know? Only time will be able to tell that,\u201d you gave a small smile and walked away to your next class hoping to continue your dream.<br/></p><p>Sitting in the back of the class again you put your head down on the desk preparing for all the trouble.</p><p><i>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Peter asked when you got back on the roof of the school.</i><br/></p><p><i>\u201cOh it was nothing,\u201d you brushed off his question,\u00a0\u201cWhere were we?\u201d you stepped closer to him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI believe, we were stargazing,\u201d Peter took your hand in his continuing the romantic ritual.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you looked down at your feet,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we were doing something else.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cOh, you mean this,\u201d he took hold of your body in a tight hug. Leaning his head down to reach your lips. You moved your hands to his hair ready to tug at his perfect curls. Eventually Peter laid a wet needy kiss on your lips. It was like he missed you too. But how could he know what you were dreaming about?<br/></i></p><p>\u201cDoes she know she drools?\u201d some asshole said.<br/></p><p>\u201cEveryone drools dumbass,\u201d MJ hit him over the head.<br/></p><p><i>Peter moved his lips down your neck leaving little love bites along the way. As things heated up between the two of you; you wanted nothing more than to get deeper under his skin. In no hurry you took off his jacket making the moment last as long as possible.</i></p><p><i>Going for his tie Peter stopped you,\u00a0\u201cNot the tie.\u201d he left your skin,\u00a0\u201cworked to hard to properly put this thing on.\u201d he blushed at the touch of your hands.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAlright,\u201d you gave his nose a peck.</i></p><p><i>Unbuttoning his shirt your hands start to shake. What were you doing? You were totally not ready for this!</i></p><p><i>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry Peter,\u201d you blushed buttoning his shirt back up.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just not ready.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry. I understand,\u201d he held your shaking hands to his heart,\u00a0\u201cbesides I wouldn\u2019t want my first time to be outside in the cold.\u201d he gave you a little wink.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>You\u2019re such a dream to me</b>,\u201d you brought him down to you kissing him once more.<br/></i></p><p>Abruptly waking up, you wiped the drool from your mouth making a few heads turn. But all you could think was\u00a0\u2018shit.\u2019</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><b>a/n: </b>i wanted to post this yesterday but my internet was down. next of Sweetener Series will hopefully be posted at the end of the week depending on how my internet behaves &lt;3</p>",

I&rsquo;m just as confused as you are.&rdquo; stopping in the middle of the hall with their attention.&nbsp;&ldquo;I knew I still had feelings for Peter when I broke up with him, but I didn&rsquo;t think I would be having any dreams about him. I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when my heart doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then why did you break up with Peter?&rdquo; Betty asked curiously.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I just needed time to myself to work out some personal things. Peter agreed, so we went our different ways.&rdquo; you almost started to cry thinking about everything that happened all those weeks ago.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But there is no chance you will get back together?&rdquo; Betty asked another question out of curiosity.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know? Only time will be able to tell that,&rdquo; you gave a small smile and walked away to your next class hoping to continue your dream.<br /></p><p>Sitting in the back of the class again you put your head down on the desk preparing for all the trouble.</p><p><i>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Peter asked when you got back on the roof of the school.</i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh it was nothing,&rdquo; you brushed off his question,&nbsp;&ldquo;Where were we?&rdquo; you stepped closer to him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I believe, we were stargazing,&rdquo; Peter took your hand in his continuing the romantic ritual.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you looked down at your feet,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure we were doing something else.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, you mean this,&rdquo; he took hold of your body in a tight hug. Leaning his head down to reach your lips. You moved your hands to his hair ready to tug at his perfect curls. Eventually Peter laid a wet needy kiss on your lips. It was like he missed you too. But how could he know what you were dreaming about?<br /></i></p><p>&ldquo;Does she know she drools?&rdquo; some asshole said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Everyone drools dumbass,&rdquo; MJ hit him over the head.<br /></p><p><i>Peter moved his lips down your neck leaving little love bites along the way. As things heated up between the two of you; you wanted nothing more than to get deeper under his skin. In no hurry you took off his jacket making the moment last as long as possible.</i></p><p><i>Going for his tie Peter stopped you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Not the tie.&rdquo; he left your skin,&nbsp;&ldquo;worked to hard to properly put this thing on.&rdquo; he blushed at the touch of your hands.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; you gave his nose a peck.</i></p><p><i>Unbuttoning his shirt your hands start to shake. What were you doing? You were totally not ready for this!</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry Peter,&rdquo; you blushed buttoning his shirt back up.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not ready.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be sorry. I understand,&rdquo; he held your shaking hands to his heart,&nbsp;&ldquo;besides I wouldn&rsquo;t want my first time to be outside in the cold.&rdquo; he gave you a little wink.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>You&rsquo;re such a dream to me</b>,&rdquo; you brought him down to you kissing him once more.<br /></i></p><p>Abruptly waking up, you wiped the drool from your mouth making a few heads turn.

If it does though, please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>You brought your hands up to either side of his head and closed your eyes but before anything could happen, you felt Peter\u2019s hand caressing your cheek.</p><p>You open your eyes and Peter said, \u201cYou are absolutely stunning, do you have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>You smiled and said, \u201cYes I do.\u201d</p><p>He removed his hand from your cheek,\u00a0bowed his head and said, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>You giggled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re my boyfriend Pete.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and said, \u201cReally?

You can just feel it. </p><p>Extreme pain like you never felt before was now coursing through your body. </p><p>Just a few more seconds and everything would be fine.</p><p>You pushed the thought of your own pain in the back of your head and thought about Peter.</p><p>Just as your body started shaking, it was over. </p><p>You opened your eyes, Peter lets go of your wrists, and your arms fell to your side.</p><p>Then, you see Peter falling back onto his back.</p><p>You look at him and ask, \u201cPete, are you alright?\u201d</p><p>The only answer you got from him was a thumbs up.</p><p>You slowly crawled towards him and took off his mask so he can breathe better.</p><p>You see his eyes were closed and his breathing was evening out. So, you figured he fell asleep.</p><p>You moved piece of his hair that fell on his face to the side, and kissed him on the forehead.</p><p>You were exhausted, so you laid down next to him, pulled the blanket over you two, and fell asleep.</p><p>*the next day*</p><p>Your eyes fluttered open feeling a pair of arms wrapped around you and your back pressed up against a firm chest.</p><p>You slightly turn your head to see Peter sleeping.</p><p>You smiled and turned away.</p><p>You carefully unwrapped his arms from your body and got up. Though, once you got up, you felt so weak. </p><p>You have never felt so weak in your entire life.</p><p>You thought that maybe since you\u2019re healing someone else, the pain has to go somewhere, so it goes to you so it isn\u2019t as painful as it is to them.</p><p>You sat with your back resting on your headboard and rested your eyes for a little longer.</p><p>Then, you heard a groan from Peter.</p><p>You opened your eyes and looked over at Peter waking up.</p><p>\u201cGood morning sleepyhead.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cHmm what happened?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you had a concussion last night and I healed you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cReally? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s something I haven\u2019t told you and that is that I have superpowers. More specifically, healing powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s so cool, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would think I was a freak.\u201d</p><p>He got up and looked into your eyes and said, \u201cI would never think that. Your powers doesn\u2019t make you any less you. What you have is something that\u2019s amazing and spectacular.\u201d</p><p>You blushed and said, \u201cThank you\u2026 Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>You see his eyes widen and said, \u201cWh-what? Spider-Man? Pffst, where did you get that idea?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUmm because of that.\u201d You said while pointing down to his suit.</p><p>He looks down seeing that he was in his Spider-Man suit and said, \u201cI-I-I can explain this.\u201d</p><p>He looks back at you and you gesture for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 th-this isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cMmhmm, sure Pete sure.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and said, \u201cFine, you promise you won\u2019t tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross my heart, and hope to die.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you for healing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, I\u2019d do anything for you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his face closer to yours indicating that he was going to kiss you.</p><p>You met him halfway, the two of you closed your eyes and kissed.</p><p>A few seconds later, you two broke apart and you asked, \u201cYou promise you won\u2019t tell anyone about my powers?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and said, \u201cCross my heart, and hope to die.\u201d</p><p>Permanent Taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myEUKMM5zuRZIa9gH2IvfvQ\">@m4df4n</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRxOV1HZZiJw1Ecc5XMEUFQ\">@jellybean-gg</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZimOsJLiw1SU8LJs07MT2g\">@tom-hollands-hoe</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbxKTqI7Sd3LkwpvegwGiyg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbxKTqI7Sd3LkwpvegwGiyg\">@dark-night-sky-99</a></p><p>If you would like to be permanently tagged, just send me through asks or message me and I\u2019ll add you to the list<br/></p>",

Though, you chose to stay in Queens.</p><p>You were now 16 years old and going to Midtown High. </p><p>School just ended and you were at your locker putting away the books you didn&rsquo;t need when all of a sudden, a pair of arms wrap around your waist.</p><p>Automatically you knew it was your boyfriend, Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Petey.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hello my love.&rdquo; He said while burying his face into your neck.</p><p>&ldquo;You sound tired, did you get enough sleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm no.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh Peter, that&rsquo;s terrible. Sleep is very important especially if you want to function through the day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know but I had&hellip; things to do.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Like?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhh&hellip; homework and uhh&hellip; studying.&rdquo;</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t buying his excuse but you didn&rsquo;t want to push it. He will tell when he&rsquo;s ready.</p><p>You only nodded and closed your locker.</p><p>You turned around and he lifted his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Please try to get more sleep this time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t kno&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Before he could finish, you interrupted by saying, &ldquo;Please Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and said, &ldquo;Good&hellip; you know I&rsquo;m just trying to look out for you. I love you and I don&rsquo;t want you to ruin your health.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know and thank you for that, I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>You grab his face and gave him a chaste kiss.</p><p>*hours later* </p><p>It was 10 at night and you were sitting at your desk finishing your homework when you hear a tapping at your window.</p><p>You look over and was shocked to see Spider-Man.</p><p>He signaled for you to let him in.</p><p>You got up and opened your window so he can come him.</p><p>As he was coming in, you were internally freaking out because you&rsquo;re a huge fan.</p><p>After he was in, you closed the window.</p><p>You turn to look at him and said, &ldquo;So Spider-Man, what brings you here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh uhh&hellip;&rdquo; then he looks around, &ldquo;oh wait this isn&rsquo;t Ned&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ned as in Ned Leeds?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he helps me with my wounds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, Ned knows who you are?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s my best friend, and he accidentally saw me in my suit without the mask.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Then you gasped, &ldquo;Peter?!&rdquo; You whisper yell.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously&hellip;&rdquo; Then he looks down, &ldquo;oh wait I&rsquo;m still in my suit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about the Spider-Man thing later but are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, I feel dizzy and nauseous.&rdquo;</p><p>You grabbed his hand and led him to your bed. </p><p>&ldquo;You should sit.&rdquo; You said and he did as he was told.</p><p>You grabbed your laptop, sat down next to Peter, and looked up what he could have.</p><p>A few minutes later, you find out that Peter could possibly have a concussion.</p><p>You closed your laptop, look over at Peter and asked, &ldquo;Peter, turn your body towards me.&rdquo;</p><p>He did has he was told and crossed his legs.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if this will hurt because I never done this to another person but I really hope it doesn&rsquo;t. If it does though, please forgive me.&rdquo;</p><p>You brought your hands up to either side of his head and closed your eyes but before anything could happen, you felt Peter&rsquo;s hand caressing your cheek.</p><p>You open your eyes and Peter said, &ldquo;You are absolutely stunning, do you have a boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and said, &ldquo;Yes I do.&rdquo;</p><p>He removed his hand from your cheek,&nbsp;bowed his head and said, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>You giggled and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my boyfriend Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>He lifted his head and said, &ldquo;Really? Damn I&rsquo;m lucky!&rdquo;</p><p>You giggled again and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more the lucky one but right now, I have to concentrate.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and whispered to himself, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m the lucky one.&rdquo; </p><p>You heard him and smiled.</p><p>Then, you closed your eyes and concentrated.</p><p>A few seconds later, you hear Peter grunting in pain. </p><p>You were about to take your hands away and stop but he instantly held your hands in position.</p><p>You only were hesitant but continued.</p><p>A few seconds later, you were starting to feel a bit weak but you couldn&rsquo;t stop, not when you were so close. You can just feel it. </p><p>Extreme pain like you never felt before was now coursing through your body. </p><p>Just a few more seconds and everything would be fine.</p><p>You pushed the thought of your own pain in the back of your head and thought about Peter.</p><p>Just as your body started shaking, it was over. </p><p>You opened your eyes, Peter lets go of your wrists, and your arms fell to your side.</p><p>Then, you see Peter falling back onto his back.</p><p>You look at him and ask, &ldquo;Pete, are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>The only answer you got from him was a thumbs up.</p><p>You slowly crawled towards him and took off his mask so he can breathe better.</p><p>You see his eyes were closed and his breathing was evening out. So, you figured he fell asleep.</p><p>You moved piece of his hair that fell on his face to the side, and kissed him on the forehead.</p><p>You were exhausted, so you laid down next to him, pulled the blanket over you two, and fell asleep.</p><p>*the next day*</p><p>Your eyes fluttered open feeling a pair of arms wrapped around you and your back pressed up against a firm chest.</p><p>You slightly turn your head to see Peter sleeping.</p><p>You smiled and turned away.</p><p>You carefully unwrapped his arms from your body and got up. Though, once you got up, you felt so weak. </p><p>You have never felt so weak in your entire life.</p><p>You thought that maybe since you&rsquo;re healing someone else, the pain has to go somewhere, so it goes to you so it isn&rsquo;t as painful as it is to them.</p><p>You sat with your back resting on your headboard and rested your eyes for a little longer.</p><p>Then, you heard a groan from Peter.</p><p>You opened your eyes and looked over at Peter waking up.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning sleepyhead.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm what happened?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, you had a concussion last night and I healed you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Really? How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s something I haven&rsquo;t told you and that is that I have superpowers. More specifically, healing powers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s so cool, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you would think I was a freak.&rdquo;</p><p>He got up and looked into your eyes and said, &ldquo;I would never think that. Your powers doesn&rsquo;t make you any less you. What you have is something that&rsquo;s amazing and spectacular.&rdquo;</p><p>You blushed and said, &ldquo;Thank you&hellip; Spider-Man.&rdquo;</p><p>You see his eyes widen and said, &ldquo;Wh-what? Spider-Man? Pffst, where did you get that idea?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Umm because of that.&rdquo; You said while pointing down to his suit.</p><p>He looks down seeing that he was in his Spider-Man suit and said, &ldquo;I-I-I can explain this.&rdquo;</p><p>He looks back at you and you gesture for him to continue.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; th-this isn&rsquo;t what it looks like.&rdquo; He said.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmhmm, sure Pete sure.&rdquo;</p><p>He groaned and said, &ldquo;Fine, you promise you won&rsquo;t tell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cross my heart, and hope to die.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for healing me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem, I&rsquo;d do anything for you. I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned his face closer to yours indicating that he was going to kiss you.</p><p>You met him halfway, the two of you closed your eyes and kissed.</p><p>A few seconds later, you two broke apart and you asked, &ldquo;You promise you won&rsquo;t tell anyone about my powers?&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled and said, &ldquo;Cross my heart, and hope to die.&rdquo;</p><p>Permanent Taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myEUKMM5zuRZIa9gH2IvfvQ\">@m4df4n</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRxOV1HZZiJw1Ecc5XMEUFQ\">@jellybean-gg</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZimOsJLiw1SU8LJs07MT2g\">@tom-hollands-hoe</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbxKTqI7Sd3LkwpvegwGiyg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbxKTqI7Sd3LkwpvegwGiyg\">@dark-night-sky-99</a></p><p>If you would like to be permanently tagged, just send me through asks or message me and I&rsquo;ll add you to the list<br /></p>",
