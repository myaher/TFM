He was\nso broken. You were so broken\u2026 everything was so, so broken, in total shatters\nand here you were trying to pick up the pieces as best you could, and so far it\nwas all failing. </p><!-- more --><p>He refused to look at you. The last time he looked at you in\nthe eye was yesterday, and then he immediately look away and looked in so much\npain. You knew why, and that hurt even more. </p><p>You knew he loved you. He loved you to hell and back, and\nyou felt the exact same. However, weeks ago a series of events broke up the\nAvengers, Bucky was found, and accused of the murder of a king\u2026 it was all\nmessy. </p><p>You were Tony\u2019s sister by a good ten years, a definite late\narrival to the family- you barely remembered your parents. That\u2019s probably what\nsoftened the blow when Tony told you that Bucky had been the one to kill them.\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t the only factor that made you side more with him. Due to\nyour young age and Tony not being exactly stable to raise you, you were put\nunder care and in a twisted turn of events, HYDRA got their grubby hands on\nyou, and made sure your carers were agents of HYDRA. They exposed you to a lot\nof awful things while also keeping your brother away from you so he wouldn\u2019t\nknow. Some of those things you still hadn\u2019t told Tony about to this day. He\nbarely scratched the surface. But Bucky? Bucky knew everything. </p><p>You had met Bucky a young teenager, when your \u2018foster\nfather\u2019 had brought him to the house. You had stumbled into the room, seeing\nthe winter soldier sat at the table, metal arm out as your foster parent worked\non it. Your eyes immediately met, but nothing was said. Years later you found\nout that he had gone on a mission, injured his metal arm and had been told to\ngo to your house to have his arm fixed. He never forgot you. This came in handy\nfor your second meeting. </p><p>Your second meeting was when you were 16. Your \u2018parents\u2019\nwere forcing you into the HYDRA lifestyle, and during your first day, as a\npunishment for refusing work, they put you in the room with him, purely to\nfrighten you. However, as soon as he saw you, his cold eyes became slightly\nwarmer, and the fear you felt slowly subsided as you realised he wasn\u2019t\nplanning on actually harming you. \u201c\u2026Hello.\u201d You called quietly. He didn\u2019t\nrespond, and instead sat back down. Soon you were let out the room, and you\ndidn\u2019t see him till you were in your late 20\u2019s, as you ran away from HYDRA not\nlong after turning 18. He was also on the run from Hydra, and he ended up\nkilling an agent who had found you. After that, you didn\u2019t leave each other\u2019s\nside, forming not only a friendship but also a relationship. </p><p>You were only reunited with your brother when Bucky was\nframed for murder. You knew immediately he was innocent, and as a desperate\nattempt to clear his name, you rushed back to America and stormed into Stark\ntower. The whole reason you hadn\u2019t come back to your brother before was because\nyou barely remembered him due to you being so young, but Tony knew as soon as\nhe saw you, who you were. You were his baby sister, and here you were, fine,\ndefending Barnes. He wasn\u2019t convinced, and instead kept you under security\nprotection \u2018till everything is cleared up\u2019. You found out about what had\nhappened a few days later, though your distraught, angry brother. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You asked, seeing the cuts and bruises on\nhis face. He had hatred in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cBucky killed our parent\u2019s, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>For a good week you were silent, not searching for what had\nhappened to Bucky, trying to deal with the fact that the man you loved had been\nthe reason you had gone through all that trauma as a child, why your brother\nand you were separated\u2026 why you met in the first place. It wasn\u2019t until news\nreached you that Steve had helped his team out of imprisonment did the thought\nof maybe\u2026 you were missing something in the story. It took a bit of trying, but\neventually with enough asking of Happy and Pepper, as well as Bucky trying in\nWakanda to find out what happened to you, were you able to meet Natasha in\nprivate, who told you the whole story. That Bucky was under brainwash when it\nhappened. It was the Winter Soldier, not him. Part of you always knew that it\ncouldn\u2019t have been him to do that. You knew Bucky was the victim in all of\nthis. When you got the truth, you made the decision to go with Natasha to\nWakanda to be with Bucky. You knew he needed you. But you also knew you had to say\ngoodbye. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d You asked. He barely turned from his desk. The\nbruises had gone yellow, and the cuts were turning into scabs, and his eyes\nwere still a lot darker then how you remembered them when you were a child.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m going to Wakanda for a while.\u201d You admitted. </p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to him? To the man who killed our\nparents?\u201d He asked, raising himself from his seat, clear distaste- hatred in\nhis voice. </p><p>\u201cTony-\u201c </p><p>\u201cY/N, how can you still love him? Knowing he\u2019s the cause of\nour suffering?\u201d He insisted. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him! It was HYDRA! It was always HYDRA! HYDRA\ncontrolled him, they controlled me! Tony, please listen to me. I\u2019ve known Bucky\nfor years, I\u2019ve seen him in his worse and his best. I\u2019ve seen him as both the\nsoldier and as James. They\u2019re not the same\u2026 Tony. Please. I\u2019ll come back- but I\nneed to see him.\u201d You begged. </p><p>He didn\u2019t tell you to your face that he agreed, instead he\ngot Natasha to come pick you up while he was busy with other work, so he\nwouldn\u2019t have to say goodbye and question his decision. </p><p>When Bucky realised you were in Wakanda, it was when you\nwere approaching him. His first reaction was just pure happiness. It was the\nhappiest anyone around him had seen him in the recent weeks, seeing him calling\nyour name, holding you tightly and just kissing you. It wasn\u2019t until a good\nminute that he actually looked at you, and then he froze. He realised, he\nremembered, and guilt tore away all that happiness as he let go of you, leading\nyou to where you were now. </p><p>\u201cBucky, please.\u201d You begged, but he only seemed to curl up\nmore in front of you. Did it discourage you? No. You didn\u2019t come here to fail\nhim. You knew he needed you, and you weren\u2019t going to turn your back on him.\nYou reached out, gently taking his hand that he had clutched against his\nstomach. He didn\u2019t flinch, and he let you open his palm, and hold his hand, and\nhe just stared at your hands. \u201cI love you more than anything, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He spoke up quietly. \u201cI ruined your life. I\ndestroyed your chances of a good life when I killed your parents.\u201d </p><p>\n\n\n\n\u201cJames Buchanan Barnes.\u201d\nYou spoke sternly. \u201cThat is your name, not the Soldier who did it. You are not\nthe Winter Soldier, there for you didn\u2019t do it, you hear me?\u201d You spoke\nstrongly. Bucky finally looked up at you with those still hurt eyes. \u201cI love\nyou, James. This doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d You assured. You finally felt him\nhold your hand in return, a soft smile covering your lips, before you carefully\nstood up, lent forward and kissing him. Finally, progress.\n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

The last time he looked at you in\nthe eye was yesterday, and then he immediately look away and looked in so much\npain. You knew why, and that hurt even more. </p><p>You knew he loved you. He loved you to hell and back, and\nyou felt the exact same. However, weeks ago a series of events broke up the\nAvengers, Bucky was found, and accused of the murder of a king\u2026 it was all\nmessy. </p><p>You were Tony\u2019s sister by a good ten years, a definite late\narrival to the family- you barely remembered your parents. That\u2019s probably what\nsoftened the blow when Tony told you that Bucky had been the one to kill them.\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t the only factor that made you side more with him. Due to\nyour young age and Tony not being exactly stable to raise you, you were put\nunder care and in a twisted turn of events, HYDRA got their grubby hands on\nyou, and made sure your carers were agents of HYDRA. They exposed you to a lot\nof awful things while also keeping your brother away from you so he wouldn\u2019t\nknow. Some of those things you still hadn\u2019t told Tony about to this day. He\nbarely scratched the surface. But Bucky? Bucky knew everything. </p><p>You had met Bucky a young teenager, when your \u2018foster\nfather\u2019 had brought him to the house. You had stumbled into the room, seeing\nthe winter soldier sat at the table, metal arm out as your foster parent worked\non it. Your eyes immediately met, but nothing was said. Years later you found\nout that he had gone on a mission, injured his metal arm and had been told to\ngo to your house to have his arm fixed. He never forgot you. This came in handy\nfor your second meeting. </p><p>Your second meeting was when you were 16. Your \u2018parents\u2019\nwere forcing you into the HYDRA lifestyle, and during your first day, as a\npunishment for refusing work, they put you in the room with him, purely to\nfrighten you. However, as soon as he saw you, his cold eyes became slightly\nwarmer, and the fear you felt slowly subsided as you realised he wasn\u2019t\nplanning on actually harming you. \u201c\u2026Hello.\u201d You called quietly. He didn\u2019t\nrespond, and instead sat back down. Soon you were let out the room, and you\ndidn\u2019t see him till you were in your late 20\u2019s, as you ran away from HYDRA not\nlong after turning 18. He was also on the run from Hydra, and he ended up\nkilling an agent who had found you. After that, you didn\u2019t leave each other\u2019s\nside, forming not only a friendship but also a relationship. </p><p>You were only reunited with your brother when Bucky was\nframed for murder. You knew immediately he was innocent, and as a desperate\nattempt to clear his name, you rushed back to America and stormed into Stark\ntower. The whole reason you hadn\u2019t come back to your brother before was because\nyou barely remembered him due to you being so young, but Tony knew as soon as\nhe saw you, who you were. You were his baby sister, and here you were, fine,\ndefending Barnes. He wasn\u2019t convinced, and instead kept you under security\nprotection \u2018till everything is cleared up\u2019. You found out about what had\nhappened a few days later, though your distraught, angry brother. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You asked, seeing the cuts and bruises on\nhis face. He had hatred in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cBucky killed our parent\u2019s, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>For a good week you were silent, not searching for what had\nhappened to Bucky, trying to deal with the fact that the man you loved had been\nthe reason you had gone through all that trauma as a child, why your brother\nand you were separated\u2026 why you met in the first place. It wasn\u2019t until news\nreached you that Steve had helped his team out of imprisonment did the thought\nof maybe\u2026 you were missing something in the story. It took a bit of trying, but\neventually with enough asking of Happy and Pepper, as well as Bucky trying in\nWakanda to find out what happened to you, were you able to meet Natasha in\nprivate, who told you the whole story. That Bucky was under brainwash when it\nhappened. It was the Winter Soldier, not him. Part of you always knew that it\ncouldn\u2019t have been him to do that. You knew Bucky was the victim in all of\nthis. When you got the truth, you made the decision to go with Natasha to\nWakanda to be with Bucky. You knew he needed you. But you also knew you had to say\ngoodbye. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d You asked. He barely turned from his desk. The\nbruises had gone yellow, and the cuts were turning into scabs, and his eyes\nwere still a lot darker then how you remembered them when you were a child.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m going to Wakanda for a while.\u201d You admitted. </p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to him? To the man who killed our\nparents?\u201d He asked, raising himself from his seat, clear distaste- hatred in\nhis voice. </p><p>\u201cTony-\u201c </p><p>\u201cY/N, how can you still love him? Knowing he\u2019s the cause of\nour suffering?\u201d He insisted. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him! It was HYDRA! It was always HYDRA! HYDRA\ncontrolled him, they controlled me! Tony, please listen to me. I\u2019ve known Bucky\nfor years, I\u2019ve seen him in his worse and his best. I\u2019ve seen him as both the\nsoldier and as James. They\u2019re not the same\u2026 Tony. Please. I\u2019ll come back- but I\nneed to see him.\u201d You begged. </p><p>He didn\u2019t tell you to your face that he agreed, instead he\ngot Natasha to come pick you up while he was busy with other work, so he\nwouldn\u2019t have to say goodbye and question his decision. </p><p>When Bucky realised you were in Wakanda, it was when you\nwere approaching him. His first reaction was just pure happiness. It was the\nhappiest anyone around him had seen him in the recent weeks, seeing him calling\nyour name, holding you tightly and just kissing you. It wasn\u2019t until a good\nminute that he actually looked at you, and then he froze. He realised, he\nremembered, and guilt tore away all that happiness as he let go of you, leading\nyou to where you were now. </p><p>\u201cBucky, please.\u201d You begged, but he only seemed to curl up\nmore in front of you. Did it discourage you? No. You didn\u2019t come here to fail\nhim. You knew he needed you, and you weren\u2019t going to turn your back on him.\nYou reached out, gently taking his hand that he had clutched against his\nstomach. He didn\u2019t flinch, and he let you open his palm, and hold his hand, and\nhe just stared at your hands. \u201cI love you more than anything, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He spoke up quietly. \u201cI ruined your life. I\ndestroyed your chances of a good life when I killed your parents.\u201d </p><p>\n\n\n\n\u201cJames Buchanan Barnes.\u201d\nYou spoke sternly. \u201cThat is your name, not the Soldier who did it. You are not\nthe Winter Soldier, there for you didn\u2019t do it, you hear me?\u201d You spoke\nstrongly. Bucky finally looked up at you with those still hurt eyes. \u201cI love\nyou, James. This doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d You assured. You finally felt him\nhold your hand in return, a soft smile covering your lips, before you carefully\nstood up, lent forward and kissing him.

I\ndestroyed your chances of a good life when I killed your parents.&rdquo; </p><p>\n\n\n\n&ldquo;James Buchanan Barnes.&rdquo;\nYou spoke sternly. &ldquo;That is your name, not the Soldier who did it. You are not\nthe Winter Soldier, there for you didn&rsquo;t do it, you hear me?&rdquo; You spoke\nstrongly. Bucky finally looked up at you with those still hurt eyes. &ldquo;I love\nyou, James. This doesn&rsquo;t change anything.&rdquo; You assured. You finally felt him\nhold your hand in return, a soft smile covering your lips, before you carefully\nstood up, lent forward and kissing him. Finally, progress.\n\n\n\n</p><hr /><p>Hope you like it!
