Comments like these don\u2019t only disregard Carol\u2019s character, but also the plot of the infinity stones. The stones are thought to have \u2018unlimited energy\u2019 or \u2018unlimited power\u2019, but it\u2019s never been considered that something or <i>someone </i>could equate to that energy until <i>Infinity War</i>. Wanda and Thor are the closest characters to that sort of power, being thought to be the ones who are thought might destroy the stones during <i>Infinity War</i>. Wanda even succeeds in destroying the mind stone, as her power originated from that stone in the first place, which is returned to in Vison\u2019s statement: \u2018I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something very similar to its own signature, perhaps&hellip;its molecular integrity will fail.\u2019 The definition of \u2018integrity\u2019 echoes a lot of what is explained about the infinity stones and Captain Marvel\u2019s personality in her trailer:</p><p><i>Integrity</i></p><p><i>1 The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.</i></p><p><i>2 The state of being whole and undivided</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The condition of being unified or sound in construction.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Internal consistency or lack of corruption in electronic data.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Choosing over love and a moral compass is a motif throughout <i>Infinity War</i>, and as far as we have been told, the infinity stones choose a moral compass over love, which is why Thanos supposedly gets the soul stone. This would suggest that whoever created the system of the stones doesn\u2019t care how twisted your moral compass is, as long as your ability to carry out your moral compass\u2019 will is strong. If the stones value the will of a moral compass over the contruct of the moral compass itself, as the idea of \u2018will\u2019 is also a key theme in <i>Infinity War </i>either way<i>, </i>that breaks down the amount of power Thanos has over the stones, even if he can use them at his will<i>. </i>Thanos believes that his way is the one way, without actually exploring any other options. He assumes that he is right, however obvious it is to everyone around him and to the audience that he is not. But Thanos is also sadist in the way that he kills people; sometimes killing out of no reason other than malice and cruelty. So, the question is, does the system of the stones care if you choose a <i>person</i>you love over a moral compass, because it clear that Thanos loves murder. Thanos\u2019 goal is to give more resources to other half of universe that doesn\u2019t die, and his will to forefill that idea is what the system of the stones will be focusing on. Wouldn\u2019t the fact that Thanos has already killed millions offset the universe from his goal of \u2018balance\u2019? So, if the stones found someone whose will doesn\u2019t only surpass Thanos, but has love as part of their moral compass (Wanda and Thor are clear examples), wouldn\u2019 the system of the stones choose that person or group of people over Thanos, as he has actually breached the goal of his moral compass multiple times for love? </p><p>Enter Carol Danvers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since the stones were created in the beginning of the universe, and they are large entities that represent different aspects of the universe like time, destroying them could potentially have just as bad an impact as Thanos destroying half of the living universe. Doctor Strange and Wong were sworn to protect the time stone, even before they knew Thanos was part of equation. The stones must keep some kind of balance with the universe, or why would Thanos need them to make them suit his idea of balance? So, if the avengers/guardians can\u2019t destroy the infinity stones, then what should they do with them if they take them from Thanos? All the stones have been assigned a power, so someone who can absorb and reabsorb pure energy might overwhelm them, breaking their \u2018sound construction\u2019. What if the stones need be overpowered instead of destroyed? Carol can reabsorb energy, so she might be able to reabsorb the power of the infinity stones, and redistribute it to somewhere else. Wouldn\u2019t it be ironic, and the most suitable punishment for Thanos, if the avengers/guardians used the stones as a resource by retributing it,<b><i></i></b>showing Thanos just one in million things he could have done instead of committing <b><i>mass genocide</i></b>? They could do very quickly what he has been trying to do for decades. Instead of looking for daughters to torture for years, he could have looked for someone like Wanda, Thor, or Carol, who could manipulate that the energy of the stones to give more resources, without anyone dying. Bringing up Gamora and Nebula is something he thinks he did out \u2018love\u2019, but something like raising children takes so much time and energy, taking away time from the goal of his moral compass. Again, Thanos chose \u2018love\u2019 over the will of his moral compass. One of the most terrible things is that Thanos may be aware of other choices he could have made, but the joy he gets out of killing may have blinds him.

Thor goes to save his people in <i>Thor Ragnarok </i>and builds Stormbreaker in <i>Infinity War,\u00a0</i>despite several characters telling him it was impossible. Wanda\u2019s line \u2018I can\u2019t control their fear, only my own\u2019 shows the same resistance when Vison told her that if she left with Clint, people would only fear her. All three characters have the same self-strength inside them to manage the amount of physical energy they actually have. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The flashbacks also bring attention to Carol\u2019s identity with the military. Fury and Coulson were not picked out of hat to be in the film. Carol says to Fury when asked where she came from: \u2018it\u2019s hard to explain. I see flashes. I think I had a life here.\u2019 The scene with Carol\u2019s training shown during her explanation, reminding us the reason she is so honest in telling Fury about her backstory. Being both trained in the military, there is a mutual understanding between them. Many of the Avengers have military training (Cap, Sam, Rhodey, Bucky etc), so it also makes her good uniting force in <i>Avengers </i>4. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fury also calls Carol a \u2018renegade soldier\u2019, and since Carol is shown as a prisoner, he seems to be right. She\u2019s a captive (assumedly by the Kree), which makes sense if she was going to warn Earth about the Kree\u2019s planned invasion. It is also worth noting that Carol is specifically is held by electrical current at <i>her head</i>. There is a chance that they\u2019re wiping her memories of Earth, so she doesn\u2019t feel the need to save it. \u00a0She is, after all, shown to have a life with the Kree in the trailer, and she may have seen something she wasn\u2019t meant to, or did something against the Kree\u2019s will.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"581\" data-orig-height=\"350\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d777cd6a952977fb40d7fab0fceaa57/tumblr_inline_picge5aojT1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"581\" data-orig-height=\"350\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"806\" data-orig-height=\"357\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ddc728d41fd23e0beba49c859908ed14/tumblr_inline_picgerw36Z1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"806\" data-orig-height=\"357\"/></figure><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Will and determination link to Carol\u2019s power of energy. Assuming the Kree took away her memories, Carol still had the will to remember them. She <i>wanted\u00a0</i>her memories back, regardless of what the Kree wanted. She <i>wanted</i>to come to Earth, regardless of defying the Kree. It looks as though she ticks the box of having a sound moral compass that is shaped out of love, and so she breaking the system of stones. Thanos never he does what he is doing out of love: it\u2019s not a part of his moral compass. According to him, he wants a better future for the universe, but that doesn\u2019t equate to love. If it did, he wouldn\u2019t have considered the idea of genocide. He enjoys torturing and murdering the people in universe he thinks he cares about so much. He even says \u2018fun is something considered when balancing the universe, but this does put a smile on my face.\u2019 \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The will of Carol\u2019s moral compass is projected through her energy is ultimately what\u2019s going to defeat Thanos, because it is made out of love. Again, Thor and Wanda definitely both have that quaility, which is what why they will also likely have important role in defeating of Thanos (time travel might mean Wanda is resected). But because Carol has pure energy, her power will have the most similar \u2018signature\u2019 of energy to all infinity stones, instead of just one like Wanda. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol may be the closest being to not only equal to the power of an infinity stone, but to overpower them to extent where she may have will power over what they do, even without the gauntlet. \u2018High<b>er</b>. Furth<b>er</b>. Fast<b>er.\u2019</b>weren\u2019t chosen likely. She excels beyond what the infinity stones can do, because the infinity stones do not have free will. The system that they were built around dictates what they do. They can be personified as shown in <i>Age of Ultron</i>, but only with the help of another being. Unlike Thor, Wanda, and Carol, the infinity stones do not have their own purpose or will. They constantly need to be willed by someone else. Thor and Wanda\u2019s power and will were shown in <i>Infinity War</i>, but they never combined their powers together. Doctor Strange, who has seen the one future where they defeat the infinity stones, told Thanos \u2018I think you\u2019ll find our will <i>equates </i>to yours.\u2019 Those may have been more carefully selected words than first appears. At this point in the MCU, the heroes will <i>equates</i>to Thanos\u2019. They need Carol to make their will excel past his, and do that, she need to create unity that was broken in <i>Civil War</i>, as well as use her power with Thor and Wanda to win against him, to the point where they overpower the unity that the gauntlet gives the stones, breaking their integrity (<i>\u2018the state of being whole or undivided).</i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The infinity stones can\u2019t be destroyed, but maybe they can be controlled with the will Carol\u2019s energy. She might be able to make contact with the stones and take the resistance within them, and Wanda and Thor together will finish them. Wanda, Thor, and Carol may very well be the Holy Trinity that saves the universe from Thanos\u2019 will. \u00a0Tony, Vison, and Thor had a similar combination of powers to defeat Ultron, and with theme of time travel, the idea of history repeating fits in well. Vison and Tony\u2019s will was also a big focus in <i>Infinity War</i>and in previous films, suggesting that kind of will is very likely one reasons that avengers/guardians succeed. Tony\u2019s will to protect others has been one of key features of the MCU. In <i>Age of Ultron</i>, Vison\u2019s will meant that he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to become \u2018Ultron\u2019s child\u2019, and by doing so, turns the Battle of Sokovia in the Avengers favour. The message may echo in the fourth Avengers film. Thanos may see the sun rise over a \u2018grateful universe\u2019, but it might not be the sun he had in mind.</p>",

Comments like these don\u2019t only disregard Carol\u2019s character, but also the plot of the infinity stones. The stones are thought to have \u2018unlimited energy\u2019 or \u2018unlimited power\u2019, but it\u2019s never been considered that something or <i>someone </i>could equate to that energy until <i>Infinity War</i>. Wanda and Thor are the closest characters to that sort of power, being thought to be the ones who are thought might destroy the stones during <i>Infinity War</i>. Wanda even succeeds in destroying the mind stone, as her power originated from that stone in the first place, which is returned to in Vison\u2019s statement: \u2018I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something very similar to its own signature, perhaps\u2026its molecular integrity will fail.\u2019 The definition of \u2018integrity\u2019 echoes a lot of what is explained about the infinity stones and Captain Marvel\u2019s personality in her trailer:</p><p><i>Integrity</i></p><p><i>1 The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.</i></p><p><i>2 The state of being whole and undivided</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The condition of being unified or sound in construction.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Internal consistency or lack of corruption in electronic data.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Choosing over love and a moral compass is a motif throughout <i>Infinity War</i>, and as far as we have been told, the infinity stones choose a moral compass over love, which is why Thanos supposedly gets the soul stone. This would suggest that whoever created the system of the stones doesn\u2019t care how twisted your moral compass is, as long as your ability to carry out your moral compass\u2019 will is strong. If the stones value the will of a moral compass over the contruct of the moral compass itself, as the idea of \u2018will\u2019 is also a key theme in <i>Infinity War </i>either way<i>, </i>that breaks down the amount of power Thanos has over the stones, even if he can use them at his will<i>. </i>Thanos believes that his way is the one way, without actually exploring any other options. He assumes that he is right, however obvious it is to everyone around him and to the audience that he is not. But Thanos is also sadist in the way that he kills people; sometimes killing out of no reason other than malice and cruelty. So, the question is, does the system of the stones care if you choose a <i>person</i>you love over a moral compass, because it clear that Thanos loves murder. Thanos\u2019 goal is to give more resources to other half of universe that doesn\u2019t die, and his will to forefill that idea is what the system of the stones will be focusing on. Wouldn\u2019t the fact that Thanos has already killed millions offset the universe from his goal of \u2018balance\u2019? So, if the stones found someone whose will doesn\u2019t only surpass Thanos, but has love as part of their moral compass (Wanda and Thor are clear examples), wouldn\u2019 the system of the stones choose that person or group of people over Thanos, as he has actually breached the goal of his moral compass multiple times for love? </p><p>Enter Carol Danvers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since the stones were created in the beginning of the universe, and they are large entities that represent different aspects of the universe like time, destroying them could potentially have just as bad an impact as Thanos destroying half of the living universe. Doctor Strange and Wong were sworn to protect the time stone, even before they knew Thanos was part of equation. The stones must keep some kind of balance with the universe, or why would Thanos need them to make them suit his idea of balance? So, if the avengers/guardians can\u2019t destroy the infinity stones, then what should they do with them if they take them from Thanos? All the stones have been assigned a power, so someone who can absorb and reabsorb pure energy might overwhelm them, breaking their \u2018sound construction\u2019. What if the stones need be overpowered instead of destroyed? Carol can reabsorb energy, so she might be able to reabsorb the power of the infinity stones, and redistribute it to somewhere else. Wouldn\u2019t it be ironic, and the most suitable punishment for Thanos, if the avengers/guardians used the stones as a resource by retributing it,<b><i></i></b>showing Thanos just one in million things he could have done instead of committing <b><i>mass genocide</i></b>? They could do very quickly what he has been trying to do for decades. Instead of looking for daughters to torture for years, he could have looked for someone like Wanda, Thor, or Carol, who could manipulate that the energy of the stones to give more resources, without anyone dying. Bringing up Gamora and Nebula is something he thinks he did out \u2018love\u2019, but something like raising children takes so much time and energy, taking away time from the goal of his moral compass. Again, Thanos chose \u2018love\u2019 over the will of his moral compass. One of the most terrible things is that Thanos may be aware of other choices he could have made, but the joy he gets out of killing may have blinds him. If this is true, then not only does Thanos chose a terrible version of love over his moral compass, but he ignores much more humane, and in many ways practical (which what the system will care about) methods of completing his goal.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the system disregards Thanos, what does Carol have that a universe of people doesn\u2019t?

She fights back, in spite of vulnerability and the chance she might fall again.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"702\" data-orig-height=\"344\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1f3b725bbbd52ad2cd7a4265bbe0012/tumblr_inline_picgbrgkl01v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"702\" data-orig-height=\"344\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"618\" data-orig-height=\"336\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3770ead4e5fdb4d533d8cca1eeb5c71/tumblr_inline_picgboZ0kC1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"618\" data-orig-height=\"336\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"728\" data-orig-height=\"350\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3c75d9bb659ca4625a214c5c60c34e1/tumblr_inline_picgbkjjEh1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"728\" data-orig-height=\"350\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"636\" data-orig-height=\"328\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfb97fbc11ea9eaba7d4f216658651cd/tumblr_inline_picgbmML891v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"636\" data-orig-height=\"328\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"481\" data-orig-height=\"269\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c852e056b96cccf6ffdc0c7787e5bc1f/tumblr_inline_picgbbxpfp1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"481\" data-orig-height=\"269\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"307\" data-orig-height=\"322\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/83fb948b39adf71c3975f822599f1808/tumblr_inline_picgbd14yJ1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"307\" data-orig-height=\"322\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"342\" data-orig-height=\"332\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d62a3285b71edc0dbe427ed00f142574/tumblr_inline_picgbez0Zf1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"342\" data-orig-height=\"332\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"435\" data-orig-height=\"301\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b615bbe3e171af00b2bb562cc8ac262/tumblr_inline_picgbhr6ZY1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"435\" data-orig-height=\"301\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"484\" data-orig-height=\"350\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7a2ef12d4c80f217a802b74abe0e6998/tumblr_inline_picgbtf8N21v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"484\" data-orig-height=\"350\"></figure><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thor and Wanda have the same mindset throughout previous films. Thor goes to save his people in <i>Thor Ragnarok </i>and builds Stormbreaker in <i>Infinity War,\u00a0</i>despite several characters telling him it was impossible. Wanda\u2019s line \u2018I can\u2019t control their fear, only my own\u2019 shows the same resistance when Vison told her that if she left with Clint, people would only fear her. All three characters have the same self-strength inside them to manage the amount of physical energy they actually have. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The flashbacks also bring attention to Carol\u2019s identity with the military. Fury and Coulson were not picked out of hat to be in the film. Carol says to Fury when asked where she came from: \u2018it\u2019s hard to explain. I see flashes. I think I had a life here.\u2019 The scene with Carol\u2019s training shown during her explanation, reminding us the reason she is so honest in telling Fury about her backstory. Being both trained in the military, there is a mutual understanding between them. Many of the Avengers have military training (Cap, Sam, Rhodey, Bucky etc), so it also makes her good uniting force in <i>Avengers </i>4. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fury also calls Carol a \u2018renegade soldier\u2019, and since Carol is shown as a prisoner, he seems to be right. She\u2019s a captive (assumedly by the Kree), which makes sense if she was going to warn Earth about the Kree\u2019s planned invasion. It is also worth noting that Carol is specifically is held by electrical current at <i>her head</i>. There is a chance that they\u2019re wiping her memories of Earth, so she doesn\u2019t feel the need to save it. \u00a0She is, after all, shown to have a life with the Kree in the trailer, and she may have seen something she wasn\u2019t meant to, or did something against the Kree\u2019s will.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"581\" data-orig-height=\"350\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d777cd6a952977fb40d7fab0fceaa57/tumblr_inline_picge5aojT1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"581\" data-orig-height=\"350\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"806\" data-orig-height=\"357\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ddc728d41fd23e0beba49c859908ed14/tumblr_inline_picgerw36Z1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"806\" data-orig-height=\"357\"></figure><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Will and determination link to Carol\u2019s power of energy. Assuming the Kree took away her memories, Carol still had the will to remember them. She <i>wanted\u00a0</i>her memories back, regardless of what the Kree wanted. She <i>wanted</i>to come to Earth, regardless of defying the Kree. It looks as though she ticks the box of having a sound moral compass that is shaped out of love, and so she breaking the system of stones. Thanos never he does what he is doing out of love: it\u2019s not a part of his moral compass. According to him, he wants a better future for the universe, but that doesn\u2019t equate to love. If it did, he wouldn\u2019t have considered the idea of genocide. He enjoys torturing and murdering the people in universe he thinks he cares about so much. He even says \u2018fun is something considered when balancing the universe, but this does put a smile on my face.\u2019 \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The will of Carol\u2019s moral compass is projected through her energy is ultimately what\u2019s going to defeat Thanos, because it is made out of love. Again, Thor and Wanda definitely both have that quaility, which is what why they will also likely have important role in defeating of Thanos (time travel might mean Wanda is resected). But because Carol has pure energy, her power will have the most similar \u2018signature\u2019 of energy to all infinity stones, instead of just one like Wanda. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol may be the closest being to not only equal to the power of an infinity stone, but to overpower them to extent where she may have will power over what they do, even without the gauntlet. \u2018High<b>er</b>. Furth<b>er</b>. Fast<b>er.\u2019</b>weren\u2019t chosen likely. She excels beyond what the infinity stones can do, because the infinity stones do not have free will. The system that they were built around dictates what they do. They can be personified as shown in <i>Age of Ultron</i>, but only with the help of another being. Unlike Thor, Wanda, and Carol, the infinity stones do not have their own purpose or will. They constantly need to be willed by someone else. Thor and Wanda\u2019s power and will were shown in <i>Infinity War</i>, but they never combined their powers together. Doctor Strange, who has seen the one future where they defeat the infinity stones, told Thanos \u2018I think you\u2019ll find our will <i>equates </i>to yours.\u2019 Those may have been more carefully selected words than first appears. At this point in the MCU, the heroes will <i>equates</i>to Thanos\u2019. They need Carol to make their will excel past his, and do that, she need to create unity that was broken in <i>Civil War</i>, as well as use her power with Thor and Wanda to win against him, to the point where they overpower the unity that the gauntlet gives the stones, breaking their integrity (<i>\u2018the state of being whole or undivided).</i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The infinity stones can\u2019t be destroyed, but maybe they can be controlled with the will Carol\u2019s energy. She might be able to make contact with the stones and take the resistance within them, and Wanda and Thor together will finish them. Wanda, Thor, and Carol may very well be the Holy Trinity that saves the universe from Thanos\u2019 will. \u00a0Tony, Vison, and Thor had a similar combination of powers to defeat Ultron, and with theme of time travel, the idea of history repeating fits in well. Vison and Tony\u2019s will was also a big focus in <i>Infinity War</i>and in previous films, suggesting that kind of will is very likely one reasons that avengers/guardians succeed. Tony\u2019s will to protect others has been one of key features of the MCU. In <i>Age of Ultron</i>, Vison\u2019s will meant that he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to become \u2018Ultron\u2019s child\u2019, and by doing so, turns the Battle of Sokovia in the Avengers favour. The message may echo in the fourth Avengers film. Thanos may see the sun rise over a \u2018grateful universe\u2019, but it might not be the sun he had in mind.</p></p>",

Comments like these don\u2019t only disregard Carol\u2019s character, but also the plot of the infinity stones. The stones are thought to have \u2018unlimited energy\u2019 or \u2018unlimited power\u2019, but it\u2019s never been considered that something or <i>someone </i>could equate to that energy until <i>Infinity War</i>. Wanda and Thor are the closest characters to that sort of power, being thought to be the ones who are thought might destroy the stones during <i>Infinity War</i>. Wanda even succeeds in destroying the mind stone, as her power originated from that stone in the first place, which is returned to in Vison\u2019s statement: \u2018I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something very similar to its own signature, perhaps\u2026its molecular integrity will fail.\u2019 The definition of \u2018integrity\u2019 echoes a lot of what is explained about the infinity stones and Captain Marvel\u2019s personality in her trailer:</p><p><i>Integrity</i></p><p><i>1 The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.</i></p><p><i>2 The state of being whole and undivided</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The condition of being unified or sound in construction.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Internal consistency or lack of corruption in electronic data.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Choosing over love and a moral compass is a motif throughout <i>Infinity War</i>, and as far as we have been told, the infinity stones choose a moral compass over love, which is why Thanos supposedly gets the soul stone. This would suggest that whoever created the system of the stones doesn\u2019t care how twisted your moral compass is, as long as your ability to carry out your moral compass\u2019 will is strong. If the stones value the will of a moral compass over the contruct of the moral compass itself, as the idea of \u2018will\u2019 is also a key theme in <i>Infinity War </i>either way<i>, </i>that breaks down the amount of power Thanos has over the stones, even if he can use them at his will<i>. </i>Thanos believes that his way is the one way, without actually exploring any other options. He assumes that he is right, however obvious it is to everyone around him and to the audience that he is not. But Thanos is also sadist in the way that he kills people; sometimes killing out of no reason other than malice and cruelty. So, the question is, does the system of the stones care if you choose a <i>person</i>you love over a moral compass, because it clear that Thanos loves murder. Thanos\u2019 goal is to give more resources to other half of universe that doesn\u2019t die, and his will to forefill that idea is what the system of the stones will be focusing on. Wouldn\u2019t the fact that Thanos has already killed millions offset the universe from his goal of \u2018balance\u2019? So, if the stones found someone whose will doesn\u2019t only surpass Thanos, but has love as part of their moral compass (Wanda and Thor are clear examples), wouldn\u2019 the system of the stones choose that person or group of people over Thanos, as he has actually breached the goal of his moral compass multiple times for love? </p><p>Enter Carol Danvers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since the stones were created in the beginning of the universe, and they are large entities that represent different aspects of the universe like time, destroying them could potentially have just as bad an impact as Thanos destroying half of the living universe. Doctor Strange and Wong were sworn to protect the time stone, even before they knew Thanos was part of equation. The stones must keep some kind of balance with the universe, or why would Thanos need them to make them suit his idea of balance? So, if the avengers/guardians can\u2019t destroy the infinity stones, then what should they do with them if they take them from Thanos? All the stones have been assigned a power, so someone who can absorb and reabsorb pure energy might overwhelm them, breaking their \u2018sound construction\u2019. What if the stones need be overpowered instead of destroyed? Carol can reabsorb energy, so she might be able to reabsorb the power of the infinity stones, and redistribute it to somewhere else. Wouldn\u2019t it be ironic, and the most suitable punishment for Thanos, if the avengers/guardians used the stones as a resource by retributing it,<b><i></i></b>showing Thanos just one in million things he could have done instead of committing <b><i>mass genocide</i></b>? They could do very quickly what he has been trying to do for decades. Instead of looking for daughters to torture for years, he could have looked for someone like Wanda, Thor, or Carol, who could manipulate that the energy of the stones to give more resources, without anyone dying. Bringing up Gamora and Nebula is something he thinks he did out \u2018love\u2019, but something like raising children takes so much time and energy, taking away time from the goal of his moral compass. Again, Thanos chose \u2018love\u2019 over the will of his moral compass. One of the most terrible things is that Thanos may be aware of other choices he could have made, but the joy he gets out of killing may have blinds him. If this is true, then not only does Thanos chose a terrible version of love over his moral compass, but he ignores much more humane, and in many ways practical (which what the system will care about) methods of completing his goal.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the system disregards Thanos, what does Carol have that a universe of people doesn\u2019t? What kind person could be associated with \u2018energy\u2019, particularly with the <i>Captain Marvel </i>trailer in mind? Since Marvel tend to connect their characters\u2019 powers with their personalities, already cutting Carol out of the \u2018overpowered\u2019 idea. If Carol is fleshed out as character, she won\u2019t therefore be overpowered, as the <i>Captain Marvel </i>trailer shows, with echoes other films. </p><p><i> </i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In <i>The Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, there is a constant motif of people grabbing the power stone. Cabrina <i>grabs </i>the power stone to commit suicide. Ronan <i>grabs</i>the stone to put into his hammer. Peter Quill <i>grabs</i>the stone in mid-air in the final battle against Ronan. Wouldn\u2019t you want to handle one of the most powerful energies in the universe delicately? Cabrina wanted to die, Ronan wasn\u2019t intelligent enough to think of the consequences, and in Peter\u2019s situation there was no choice but to reach out and grab the power stone, but that doesn\u2019t stop the motif being in the film, linking it to other Marvel movies. </p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Guardians of the Galaxy </i>explains the infinity stones to the audience, while <i>Captain Marvel </i>plans to explain the character who is meant to challenge the stones. One of the main segments of the\u00a0<i>Captain Marvel </i>trailer is that there are constant cuts in the <i>Captain Marvel </i>trailer to Carol making a fist. Thanos also had to close his fist with the gauntlet to activate the power of a stone in <i>Infinity War</i>; a film which shows each stone\u2019s power being used. Doesn\u2019t it seem appropriate to have the same motif in the films that explains the creation of the infinity stones, what effect they can potentially have, and how to overpower them? </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A fist can symbolise strength, which links the idea of the infinity stones having \u2018unlimited power\u2019. But are power and strength the same? A fist\u2019s symbolism of defiance/resistance, which also fits in well in what the audience have been shown of Carol\u2019s characterisation, and so the idea there is a parallel between her personality and her power works. Since <i>Captain Marvel </i>is going to be an origin story, her personality can be explored and fleshed out in full detail.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The sun hides part of the images of Carol\u2019s flashbacks to her training in the air force and later when she flying the spaceship, bringing back the idea of energy. The main mentions of the sun in <i>Infinity War\u00a0</i>are Loki\u2019s line \u2018the sun will rise on us again\u2019\u00a0<i></i>and Thanos\u2019 line \u2018I\u2019ll watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.\u2019 Both lines could easily be foreshadowing Carol\u2019s return. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"822\" data-orig-height=\"347\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3881a671d7970c0cf9fc0164eb3cce99/tumblr_inline_picg7jRHJ01v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"822\" data-orig-height=\"347\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"702\" data-orig-height=\"346\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c701a0c52680e0c03d0176e9d2e6886/tumblr_inline_picg7srE751v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"702\" data-orig-height=\"346\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"761\" data-orig-height=\"345\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3bc2962ff52e11a31b587b449eeee8d1/tumblr_inline_picg6vhcQK1v2l7r6_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"761\" data-orig-height=\"345\"></figure><p>With the air force flashbacks in mind, there is the idea that to have energy, you also need resistance.

Unlike Thor, Wanda, and Carol, the infinity stones do not have their own purpose or will. They constantly need to be willed by someone else. Thor and Wanda\u2019s power and will were shown in <i>Infinity War</i>, but they never combined their powers together. Doctor Strange, who has seen the one future where they defeat the infinity stones, told Thanos \u2018I think you\u2019ll find our will <i>equates </i>to yours.\u2019 Those may have been more carefully selected words than first appears. At this point in the MCU, the heroes will <i>equates</i>to Thanos\u2019. They need Carol to make their will excel past his, and do that, she need to create unity that was broken in <i>Civil War</i>, as well as use her power with Thor and Wanda to win against him, to the point where they overpower the unity that the gauntlet gives the stones, breaking their integrity (<i>\u2018the state of being whole or undivided).</i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The infinity stones can\u2019t be destroyed, but maybe they can be controlled with the will Carol\u2019s energy.

Wanda, Thor, and Carol may very well be the Holy Trinity that saves the universe from Thanos\u2019 will. \u00a0Tony, Vison, and Thor had a similar combination of powers to defeat Ultron, and with theme of time travel, the idea of history repeating fits in well. Vison and Tony\u2019s will was also a big focus in <i>Infinity War</i>and in previous films, suggesting that kind of will is very likely one reasons that avengers/guardians succeed. Tony\u2019s will to protect others has been one of key features of the MCU. In <i>Age of Ultron</i>, Vison\u2019s will meant that he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to become \u2018Ultron\u2019s child\u2019, and by doing so, turns the Battle of Sokovia in the Avengers favour. The message may echo in the fourth Avengers film. Thanos may see the sun rise over a \u2018grateful universe\u2019, but it might not be the sun he had in mind.</p></p>",

Comments like these don&rsquo;t only disregard Carol&rsquo;s character, but also the plot of the infinity stones. The stones are thought to have &lsquo;unlimited energy&rsquo; or &lsquo;unlimited power&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s never been considered that something or <i>someone </i>could equate to that energy until <i>Infinity War</i>. Wanda and Thor are the closest characters to that sort of power, being thought to be the ones who are thought might destroy the stones during <i>Infinity War</i>. Wanda even succeeds in destroying the mind stone, as her power originated from that stone in the first place, which is returned to in Vison&rsquo;s statement: &lsquo;I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something very similar to its own signature, perhaps&hellip;its molecular integrity will fail.&rsquo; The definition of &lsquo;integrity&rsquo; echoes a lot of what is explained about the infinity stones and Captain Marvel&rsquo;s personality in her trailer:</p><p><i>Integrity</i></p><p><i>1 The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.</i></p><p><i>2 The state of being whole and undivided</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The condition of being unified or sound in construction.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Internal consistency or lack of corruption in electronic data.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing over love and a moral compass is a motif throughout <i>Infinity War</i>, and as far as we have been told, the infinity stones choose a moral compass over love, which is why Thanos supposedly gets the soul stone. This would suggest that whoever created the system of the stones doesn&rsquo;t care how twisted your moral compass is, as long as your ability to carry out your moral compass&rsquo; will is strong. If the stones value the will of a moral compass over the contruct of the moral compass itself, as the idea of &lsquo;will&rsquo; is also a key theme in <i>Infinity War </i>either way<i>, </i>that breaks down the amount of power Thanos has over the stones, even if he can use them at his will<i>. </i>Thanos believes that his way is the one way, without actually exploring any other options. He assumes that he is right, however obvious it is to everyone around him and to the audience that he is not. But Thanos is also sadist in the way that he kills people; sometimes killing out of no reason other than malice and cruelty. So, the question is, does the system of the stones care if you choose a <i>person</i>you love over a moral compass, because it clear that Thanos loves murder. Thanos&rsquo; goal is to give more resources to other half of universe that doesn&rsquo;t die, and his will to forefill that idea is what the system of the stones will be focusing on. Wouldn&rsquo;t the fact that Thanos has already killed millions offset the universe from his goal of &lsquo;balance&rsquo;? So, if the stones found someone whose will doesn&rsquo;t only surpass Thanos, but has love as part of their moral compass (Wanda and Thor are clear examples), wouldn&rsquo; the system of the stones choose that person or group of people over Thanos, as he has actually breached the goal of his moral compass multiple times for love? </p><p>Enter Carol Danvers.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the stones were created in the beginning of the universe, and they are large entities that represent different aspects of the universe like time, destroying them could potentially have just as bad an impact as Thanos destroying half of the living universe. Doctor Strange and Wong were sworn to protect the time stone, even before they knew Thanos was part of equation. The stones must keep some kind of balance with the universe, or why would Thanos need them to make them suit his idea of balance? So, if the avengers/guardians can&rsquo;t destroy the infinity stones, then what should they do with them if they take them from Thanos? All the stones have been assigned a power, so someone who can absorb and reabsorb pure energy might overwhelm them, breaking their &lsquo;sound construction&rsquo;. What if the stones need be overpowered instead of destroyed? Carol can reabsorb energy, so she might be able to reabsorb the power of the infinity stones, and redistribute it to somewhere else. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be ironic, and the most suitable punishment for Thanos, if the avengers/guardians used the stones as a resource by retributing it,<b><i></i></b>showing Thanos just one in million things he could have done instead of committing <b><i>mass genocide</i></b>? They could do very quickly what he has been trying to do for decades. Instead of looking for daughters to torture for years, he could have looked for someone like Wanda, Thor, or Carol, who could manipulate that the energy of the stones to give more resources, without anyone dying. Bringing up Gamora and Nebula is something he thinks he did out &lsquo;love&rsquo;, but something like raising children takes so much time and energy, taking away time from the goal of his moral compass. Again, Thanos chose &lsquo;love&rsquo; over the will of his moral compass. One of the most terrible things is that Thanos may be aware of other choices he could have made, but the joy he gets out of killing may have blinds him. If this is true, then not only does Thanos chose a terrible version of love over his moral compass, but he ignores much more humane, and in many ways practical (which what the system will care about) methods of completing his goal.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the system disregards Thanos, what does Carol have that a universe of people doesn&rsquo;t? What kind person could be associated with &lsquo;energy&rsquo;, particularly with the <i>Captain Marvel </i>trailer in mind? Since Marvel tend to connect their characters&rsquo; powers with their personalities, already cutting Carol out of the &lsquo;overpowered&rsquo; idea. If Carol is fleshed out as character, she won&rsquo;t therefore be overpowered, as the <i>Captain Marvel </i>trailer shows, with echoes other films. </p><p><i> </i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In <i>The Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, there is a constant motif of people grabbing the power stone. Cabrina <i>grabs </i>the power stone to commit suicide. Ronan <i>grabs</i>the stone to put into his hammer. Peter Quill <i>grabs</i>the stone in mid-air in the final battle against Ronan. Wouldn&rsquo;t you want to handle one of the most powerful energies in the universe delicately? Cabrina wanted to die, Ronan wasn&rsquo;t intelligent enough to think of the consequences, and in Peter&rsquo;s situation there was no choice but to reach out and grab the power stone, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop the motif being in the film, linking it to other Marvel movies. </p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Guardians of the Galaxy </i>explains the infinity stones to the audience, while <i>Captain Marvel </i>plans to explain the character who is meant to challenge the stones. One of the main segments of the&nbsp;<i>Captain Marvel </i>trailer is that there are constant cuts in the <i>Captain Marvel </i>trailer to Carol making a fist. Thanos also had to close his fist with the gauntlet to activate the power of a stone in <i>Infinity War</i>; a film which shows each stone&rsquo;s power being used. Doesn&rsquo;t it seem appropriate to have the same motif in the films that explains the creation of the infinity stones, what effect they can potentially have, and how to overpower them? </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A fist can symbolise strength, which links the idea of the infinity stones having &lsquo;unlimited power&rsquo;. But are power and strength the same? A fist&rsquo;s symbolism of defiance/resistance, which also fits in well in what the audience have been shown of Carol&rsquo;s characterisation, and so the idea there is a parallel between her personality and her power works. Since <i>Captain Marvel </i>is going to be an origin story, her personality can be explored and fleshed out in full detail.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sun hides part of the images of Carol&rsquo;s flashbacks to her training in the air force and later when she flying the spaceship, bringing back the idea of energy. The main mentions of the sun in <i>Infinity War&nbsp;</i>are Loki&rsquo;s line &lsquo;the sun will rise on us again&rsquo;&nbsp;<i></i>and Thanos&rsquo; line &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.&rsquo; Both lines could easily be foreshadowing Carol&rsquo;s return. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3881a671d7970c0cf9fc0164eb3cce99/tumblr_inline_picg7jRHJ01v2l7r6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c701a0c52680e0c03d0176e9d2e6886/tumblr_inline_picg7srE751v2l7r6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3bc2962ff52e11a31b587b449eeee8d1/tumblr_inline_picg6vhcQK1v2l7r6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>With the air force flashbacks in mind, there is the idea that to have energy, you also need resistance.

They need Carol to make their will excel past his, and do that, she need to create unity that was broken in <i>Civil War</i>, as well as use her power with Thor and Wanda to win against him, to the point where they overpower the unity that the gauntlet gives the stones, breaking their integrity (<i>&lsquo;the state of being whole or undivided).</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The infinity stones can&rsquo;t be destroyed, but maybe they can be controlled with the will Carol&rsquo;s energy. She might be able to make contact with the stones and take the resistance within them, and Wanda and Thor together will finish them. Wanda, Thor, and Carol may very well be the Holy Trinity that saves the universe from Thanos&rsquo; will. &nbsp;Tony, Vison, and Thor had a similar combination of powers to defeat Ultron, and with theme of time travel, the idea of history repeating fits in well. Vison and Tony&rsquo;s will was also a big focus in <i>Infinity War</i>and in previous films, suggesting that kind of will is very likely one reasons that avengers/guardians succeed. Tony&rsquo;s will to protect others has been one of key features of the MCU. In <i>Age of Ultron</i>, Vison&rsquo;s will meant that he wouldn&rsquo;t allow himself to become &lsquo;Ultron&rsquo;s child&rsquo;, and by doing so, turns the Battle of Sokovia in the Avengers favour. The message may echo in the fourth Avengers film. Thanos may see the sun rise over a &lsquo;grateful universe&rsquo;, but it might not be the sun he had in mind.</p></p>",
