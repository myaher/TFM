        "answer": "<p>Shouto loved his boyfriend, he loved him more than\nanything in the world and would do anything and everything to make sure that he\nis always safe and that he never loses his smile.</p><p>He had no problem with Izuku becoming a Pro-Hero, hell he\nalways had a firm belief that Izuku would be the greatest hero of all time,\nthat he would be the one to surpassed not only All Might but him and Bakugou as\nwell, and he was right.</p><p>Over the course of years Izuku has become a symbol of his\nown; originally he was shooting to become the next symbol of Peace but then realized\nthat he was his own person and in his own words it was his own quirk no one\nelse\u2019s.</p><p>So over the years, he became a symbol of Hope, one that\nshowed everyone that anyone can be a hero, even if they were born quirkless-it\nstill shocks him to his core that Izuku was once quirkless and his power literally\ncame from All Might-or if they started off on the wrong path that it is never\nto late to turn your life around.</p><p>Yes, his boyfriend became an amazing hero and a symbol on\nhis own, the only problem Shouto had with Izuku was him being reckless, it\nwould seem that even as a 25 year old man Izuku still had the nasty habit of\nrunning head first and putting himself on the front of the line to protect the\nones who needed his protection.</p><p>Shouto didn\u2019t blame him, he was a hero; it was a hero\u2019s job\nto save everyone from danger, but it was also a hero\u2019s job to stop and think of\nthe situation before he jumped first and asked questions later.</p><p>A perfect example would be fighting a new villain known\nas Drainer, she had a quirk that could suck the life of anyone she touched, the\nmore lives she drained the stronger she got, and that was her greatest\nweakness. </p><p>The more lives she drained the stronger she became, the\nproblem was that her body could not handle all the power it consumed and the\nmore she had the weaker her muscles were holding it all in before they literally\nexploded.</p><p>She already drained a few heroes that tried to stop her from\nkilling the hostages that she held captive and now he, Izuku, Bakugou, and Kirishima\nwere at the scene of the crime waiting for Sero, Iida, and Uraraka. The three of\nthem had quirks that worked best for a situation like this, especially Sero.</p><p>While Shouto could use his ice to trap her he learned\nthat with all the power she had she was able to rip herself away from his ice.</p><p>\u201cWe have to do something,\u201d Izuku asked, Shouto could see\nhis muscles twitching, he knew that Deku wanted to go and save the victims, but\nhe was fighting his instincts, stopping himself from doing something so wreck\nless.</p><p>\u201cUravity, Cellophan, and Ingenium would be here any\nminute now we have to be patient,\u201d Kirishima said looking at the victims,\nDrainer had a little boy by the shirt taunting the heroes to fight her or she\u2019ll\nkill him next.</p><p>\u201cWere the fuck, are they? We send a distress call three\nminutes ago and I know damn well that Sero isn\u2019t to far from where we are,\u201d surprisingly\nthe comment didn\u2019t came from Bakugou-who has mellowed out since he started\ndating Kirishima-it came from Shouto.</p><p>\u201cCalm down Half-and-Half, they are on their way, let\u2019s not\nforget that Drainer has her goons out there fighting them so it might be a\nwhile,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a while, if we don\u2019t do something now they\nwill hurt the kid and his family,\u201d</p><p>The four heroes stayed silent as they realized how right\nthe duel quirk user was and knew they had to act now or else they would lose not\nonly the victims but also the villain and that is something they did not want\nto happen, they already lost her once and it took them forever to find her they\nweren\u2019t going to lose this opportunity again.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d Kirishima asked, Izuku looked at\nShouto as well.

                "content": "<p>Shouto loved his boyfriend, he loved him more than\nanything in the world and would do anything and everything to make sure that he\nis always safe and that he never loses his smile.</p><p>He had no problem with Izuku becoming a Pro-Hero, hell he\nalways had a firm belief that Izuku would be the greatest hero of all time,\nthat he would be the one to surpassed not only All Might but him and Bakugou as\nwell, and he was right.</p><p>Over the course of years Izuku has become a symbol of his\nown; originally he was shooting to become the next symbol of Peace but then realized\nthat he was his own person and in his own words it was his own quirk no one\nelse&rsquo;s.</p><p>So over the years, he became a symbol of Hope, one that\nshowed everyone that anyone can be a hero, even if they were born quirkless-it\nstill shocks him to his core that Izuku was once quirkless and his power literally\ncame from All Might-or if they started off on the wrong path that it is never\nto late to turn your life around.</p><p>Yes, his boyfriend became an amazing hero and a symbol on\nhis own, the only problem Shouto had with Izuku was him being reckless, it\nwould seem that even as a 25 year old man Izuku still had the nasty habit of\nrunning head first and putting himself on the front of the line to protect the\nones who needed his protection.</p><p>Shouto didn&rsquo;t blame him, he was a hero; it was a hero&rsquo;s job\nto save everyone from danger, but it was also a hero&rsquo;s job to stop and think of\nthe situation before he jumped first and asked questions later.</p><p>A perfect example would be fighting a new villain known\nas Drainer, she had a quirk that could suck the life of anyone she touched, the\nmore lives she drained the stronger she got, and that was her greatest\nweakness. </p><p>The more lives she drained the stronger she became, the\nproblem was that her body could not handle all the power it consumed and the\nmore she had the weaker her muscles were holding it all in before they literally\nexploded.</p><p>She already drained a few heroes that tried to stop her from\nkilling the hostages that she held captive and now he, Izuku, Bakugou, and Kirishima\nwere at the scene of the crime waiting for Sero, Iida, and Uraraka. The three of\nthem had quirks that worked best for a situation like this, especially Sero.</p><p>While Shouto could use his ice to trap her he learned\nthat with all the power she had she was able to rip herself away from his ice.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to do something,&rdquo; Izuku asked, Shouto could see\nhis muscles twitching, he knew that Deku wanted to go and save the victims, but\nhe was fighting his instincts, stopping himself from doing something so wreck\nless.</p><p>&ldquo;Uravity, Cellophan, and Ingenium would be here any\nminute now we have to be patient,&rdquo; Kirishima said looking at the victims,\nDrainer had a little boy by the shirt taunting the heroes to fight her or she&rsquo;ll\nkill him next.</p><p>&ldquo;Were the fuck, are they? We send a distress call three\nminutes ago and I know damn well that Sero isn&rsquo;t to far from where we are,&rdquo; surprisingly\nthe comment didn&rsquo;t came from Bakugou-who has mellowed out since he started\ndating Kirishima-it came from Shouto.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down Half-and-Half, they are on their way, let&rsquo;s not\nforget that Drainer has her goons out there fighting them so it might be a\nwhile,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a while, if we don&rsquo;t do something now they\nwill hurt the kid and his family,&rdquo;</p><p>The four heroes stayed silent as they realized how right\nthe duel quirk user was and knew they had to act now or else they would lose not\nonly the victims but also the villain and that is something they did not want\nto happen, they already lost her once and it took them forever to find her they\nweren&rsquo;t going to lose this opportunity again.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what do we do?&rdquo; Kirishima asked, Izuku looked at\nShouto as well. He had a plan but he doubt that Shouto would even want to do\nit.</p><p>&ldquo;I, I have an-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; Shouto said looking at them in the eyes,\nletting them know he was being serious and that he was serious about having a\nplan, one that might work. In the past he always followed orders, always listen\nto everyone&rsquo;s command when it came to plans especially after his epic fail with\nMomo and their practical exams when they were first years in U.A. but now he\nknew better and knew that his plan could work.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, what is it?&rdquo; Izuku asked looking at him, one thing\nShouto loved about Izuku is he always gave Shouto his unquestionable trust,\nknew his boyfriend was smart to come up with a plan that would save all of\nthem.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay here it is,&rdquo; Shouto began to tell the others his\nplan, they all listen carefully to the fire and ice user as he explained every\nlittle detail of his plan and asked them if they had any questions or concerns\nof his plan.</p><p>Izuku did, while yes Shouto&rsquo;s plan was full proof and if\ndone correctly guaranteed to work the problem he had with this plan was that\nShouto would be the target, the one to lure out Drainer since she made it\nperfectly clear that she wanted Shouto and only Shouto.</p><p>He shouldn&rsquo;t do something like that, shouldn&rsquo;t be so\nwreck less and risk his life like that.
