Sam was always there, hidden, right in front of you.</p><p>This is my first fic for Sam Wilson. He is one of my favorites, but I never knew what to write for him. Hopefully you guys like this, and I did him justice!</p><p>Word Count: 3,081</p><p>Pairings: Sam x reader</p><p>Warnings: None</p><p>Breakfast. That\u2019s what brought you and your best friend, Sam WIlson, together. Your utter love of all things made before eleven a.m. connected you for life. \u00a0The smell of fresh brewed coffee, muffins, cinnamon flavored pancakes, pastries, and for the love of all that is yummy, bacon. This is what made you bond with him from day one, and has kept your friendship strong. This is also the reason that \u201cBreakfast Bonanza\u201d was started. Friday morning was dedicated to Sam only. You would pick a new breakfast place in the city each week, and then enjoy what they had to offer each Friday morning. Everyone knew that it was your time together, and once breakfast started, you were not to be bothered.</p><p>Today you had arrived separately, as you had been out running errands. Smiling as you approach the table of one of your favorite spots, you see that Sam is already engaged in a conversation with someone on the phone. He waves you towards him, but you hesitate, not wanting to interrupt. Rolling his eyes, imitating a mouth with his hands, he mouths to you that it\u2019s Steve on the phone, making you chuckle. You mouth that it\u2019s fine, pointing to the cafe, letting him know you\u2019ll grab his drink for him. You two had made this a regular coffee date, so you knew each other\u2019s orders by heart.</p><p>The smell of the fresh croissants and coffee made your stomach growl. They had the best selection of breakfast items, and you couldn\u2019t wait to get inside to order. That is, until you saw him. The guy behind the counter always made it a point to somewhat free himself up for your orders. He was sweet, but a bit to aggressive for your liking, so you always tried to avoid him, acting as if you were busy when he was free, then rushing for your items when he was preoccupied with another customer. As soon as the bell rings, he catches your eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Mumbling into your purse, you panic, pretending that you had lost something, and start to frantically search for your \u201cmissing item.\u201d Out of the corner of your eye, you see him walk out from the counter, ready to spring, forcing you to book it out the front door, walking hastily towards Sam. </p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d He holds his hand over the phone, asking Steve to hold on. </p><p>\u201cWill you pretend to be my boyfriend for like twenty minutes, give or take?\u201d You grit your teeth, and shrug a little, knowing the request was completely weird.</p><p>\u201cSteve, I\u2019m gonna need to call you back. What\u2019s going on Y/N/N?\u201d Sam leans forward in his chair, puffing his chest out, like he sensed danger. </p><p>\u201cNothing. Well, no, that\u2019s not\u2026 there\u2019s this guy that works behind the counter&hellip;he\u2019s nice, but like too nice, ya know? Like he\u2019s a little socially clingy when I\u2019m here, and he already spotted me, and he\u2019s on the move. I ran out when he left the counter, and I don\u2019t want to go back in by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in. You can just stay here and hold our table.\u201d He goes to stand but you stop him. </p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not&hellip; If you go in, he\u2019s just going to come out here. I kind of want to stop this all together, if at all possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooo, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend, so he\u2019s thinks you&rsquo;re unavailable, so that he leaves you alone&hellip;is that it?\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but grit your teeth again, as a big cocky smile took over his face. </p><p>\u201cYes? I know, I\u2019m horrible!\u201d You felt awful about it, but he really was starting to make you uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201cYes, you are\u2026but I\u2019ll do it if it makes you feel safer.\u201d</p><p>Sam begins to stand, shaking his head at the ridiculousness of the charade you were getting ready to play. \u201cThe things I do for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll owe you one, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one freebie. Next time though\u2026\u201d He stands next to you and lightly puts his arm behind your back. \u201cAlright. How much of a boyfriend do you want? Am I like the casual, \u2018I\u2019m just here because you want to be here\u2019 type guy, or the full experience?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOoh, the full experience guy. Let\u2019s make this one count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s do this. After you beautiful.\u201d His smile makes you gleam as he holds the door open for you, and waves you in. Your face heats up a little, and you almost start to giggle when you feel his hands around your hips, almost guiding you through the patrons, and into the line. As you come to a stop, he takes the opportunity to scope out his surroundings. He slides your hair off of your neck slowly, leaning in to you as he whispers quietly into your ear. \u201cIs that him, two o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>Turning back to look over your shoulder at him, you smile sweetly, as if he told you something amusing. You nod your head yes. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s checking you out, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Now, you and Sam have always been great friends. Would you be a great couple? Probably\u2026 well at least, that\u2019s what everyone always told you. Have you two joked about dating in the past? Sure, who doesn\u2019t on occasion have a \u201cwhat if\u201d conversation with their best friend. You had both agreed during the last conversation that you would indeed make a great couple, but for the sake of the friendship, you would remain just that&hellip;friends. Would Sam ask you out in a heartbeat if you ever gave him an inkling that you may want to become more than friends? Of course he would. He&rsquo;s not crazy, he knows a good thing when he sees it. The question is&hellip;do you?</p><p>While standing in line, you notice a older couple three or four people ahead of you. Every few feet, the wife would stop to watch you and Sam, just chit chatting about your day, and whatever was happening in your lifes that week. You would catch her eyes on occasion, smile at her, and she would grin back. </p><p>\u201cBaby, I think that older lady thinks you\u2019re cute.\u201d You turn to whisper in Sam\u2019s ear, keeping up the facade.</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Sam looks deep into your eyes, almost wishing you were. \u201cYou know my heart only belongs to you.\u201d </p><p>Rolling your eyes, you laugh at the corniness of his sappy line. \u201cPlease, get over yourself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmm, I rather get over you.\u201d He winks at you, making your heart skip a beat. </p><p>\u201cSam Wilson!\u201d Your mouth drops as you smack him in his chest. \u201cI cannot believe you just said that to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe half the stuff I would say to you if you let me.\u201d He tries to keep a straight face, but ends up laughing when your eyes shoot open and you cover your ears, and turn your back to him.</p><p>\u201cLalalala, I\u2019m not hearing this.\u201d Which makes you both giggle more.</p><p>He reaches for your hands, pulling them off your head, slipping his fingers between yours. Lowering both your hands, he wraps his thick arms around yours, hugging your waist from behind, never letting go of your fingers. Without even thinking, your head falls back onto his shoulder and rolls into his neck. It shocked you for a moment, how easy it was for you to just fall into him, like it was so natural. </p><p>He tilts his head just enough to place a small kiss on your temple. Why were you so comfortable here, in his arms? Why did this feel so right, like you had been this way for years. The elderly women watches you as Sam starts to sway you gently back and forth. </p><p>\u201cWhat are getting today, love?\u201d He looks over your shoulder at the menu, waiting for you to pick before you reached the counter. </p><p>\u201cEgg and cheddar croissant&hellip;ooo, with bacon.\u201d His chest shakes as he begins to laugh again. You loved your bacon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to turn into Bacon.\u201d He squeezes your waist, getting a few fingers in under your ribs, and you buckle from laughter.</p><p>As you approach the counter, and the stage five clinger slides over, trying not to watch you as his coworker takes your order. </p><p>Sam orders for you first, then him, and offers to pay. It was his turn anyway, but it was still sweet of him to do. </p><p>Moving down the way, you wait in the pick up area for your breakfast items. The smell of the bakery made your stomach growl, and you were starting to bounce up and down, doing a small happy dance. Sam just observes you as shake your hips a little, getting ready for you for your order. He loved watching you when you were like this. Your silliness brought out something in him, and it was by far his favorite time to be around you. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d You both look to to the left, and lay eyes upon the elderly woman who had once again been spying on you. \u201cI just wanted to say, you two are just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen. It so obvious how you feel about each other. The way he looks at you&hellip;so much love in those beautiful eyes of his.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe does have beautiful eyes, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Sam looks to the floor embarrassed by the attention. </p><p>\u201cLadies please, two beautiful women flirting with me\u2026 I can\u2019t. It\u2019s to early for this!\u201d Sam ever the jokester and flirt, of course, sent the women into a fit of giggles. </p><p>\u201cOh sweetie, I haven\u2019t flirted with a man in sixty years! Not since this one over here swept me off my feet. He looked at me the same way you look at her. I fell in love with him as soon as he smiled at me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so beautiful. How long have you been together?\u201d You didn&rsquo;t mean to pry, but she was so friendly and welcoming, making you excited to hear more. </p><p>\u201cFifty-seven years, dear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, that can\u2019t be true, because you don\u2019t look a day over thirty.\u201d Ever the flirt, he was.</p><p>She chuckles with delight, making Sam laugh along with her.</p><p>\u201cThat one is a charmer, huh?\u201d She points to Sam who now has his hand around your waist again. </p><p>\u201cThat he is, that he is.\u201d Smiling over to him, he smirks at the game you two continue to play.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for the soul, sweetie, he\u2019ll keep you young at heart, just like mine does.\u201d She points to the approaching man, holding her coffee. \u00a0A handsome gentleman nods at you and Sam, smiling. \u201cDear, this is\u2026I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t even ask your names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N, and this is Sam.\u201d You say waving hi. He reaches out to shake your hand, then reaches for Sam\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cAn Air Force man, huh? I see I left you in good company.\u201d Sam looks down at his shirt, then up to see the man\u2019s hat adorning the USAF logo just above the brim.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Sam\u2019s whole demeanor changes as he stands a bit taller, and stiffens. \u201cFifty-eighth Pararescue, although&hellip;I work for a new unit now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmhmm, I thought you looked familiar. First Sergeant Alexander, retired about thirty years now, so you can just call me John. Nice to meet you, Sam and Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just telling them how much they reminded me of us when we were young and in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still young and in love, sweetie.\u201d \u00a0He says as he kisses her cheek, and she taps his face with her free hand. </p><p>You smile and laugh. \u201cWell, now I can see why you fell in love with him so quickly. He\u2019s quite the charmer himself, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you two been together?\u201d She questions as she looks to you both in wonder.</p><p>Oh, I guess we should have come up with a backstory\u2026Sam steps in with no hesitation.</p><p>\u201cTwo years this month.\u201d To this you turn to him, when you realize the reason he had picked this specific time. It has been two years exactly this month when you two had first met. How did he remember that? \u00a0\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t think I would remember the day I fell in love. You need to give me a little more credit, woman.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just&hellip;I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever told me that before.\u201d Your eyes drop a little to his chest, and it starts to feel a little bit warm in the room.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart, you can see it all over his face. I bet you feel in love the minute you met her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d The couple watches as you look up into his eyes, wondering if that was really how it all went down.</p><p>\u201cThe minute she told me her name and smiled.\u201d Sam looks deep into your soul, and you get get goosebumps all over your arms, because in that moment, you realized that he wasn\u2019t lying. You knew him well enough to know when he was serious about something, and the look in his eyes told you he was being fully honest about his feelings for you.</p><p>\u201cOh honey, he has it bad. Don\u2019t ever let this one go, or someone is going to snatch him right up!\u201d She rests her hand on your arm, but you barely even noticed. You were so deeply invested in Sam at that moment, that it felt like everything around you had stilled.</p><p>\u201cOrder thirty seven!\u201d The sound of your order being called pulls you out of your trance for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us, baby.\u201d Sam steps up to grab your drinks and food, but you stop him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we could have these to go?\u201d You ask the clinger behind the counter. Sam looks at you confused for a second before you grin back. \u201cI was thinking maybe we could go for a walk.\u201d You take a deep breath and suddenly become very shy, not able to keep your eyes on him. How did you not see this before? The man hands you a bag full of your food, and placed lids on your drinks. \u201cThank you so much, I appreciate it.\u201d Turning back to your new friends, \u00a0you grin before starting to bid them goodbye.</p><p>\u201cThis is us. It was really nice to meet you. I hope that we see you again here. We\u2019re here all the time, so maybe next time we can grab breakfast together and make a morning of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, dear. We\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d You don\u2019t know why, but you felt the sudden need to hug her. Maybe it was because she was so sweet, or because it was like you felt like you had known her all of your life. Maybe it was because you loved the thought of being like them one day, happily married, enjoying each other. Once she smiled back at you though, you realized it was none of those things. It was simply the fact that she had told you, so clearly what everyone else had been trying to tell you all along. You and Sam would be good together. Amazing even, and he already knew it. He was just waiting for you to see it on your own.</p><p>\u201cJohn, it was a pleasure.\u201d Sam reaches out and shakes his hand again. \u201cDon\u2019t ever get rid of this one, she\u2019s a treasure, and you\u2019re a lucky man.\u201d He laughs a bit while looking at his wife, who you had learned was named Millie. </p><p>\u201cNo plans on it, Sam.\u201d He beams, placing his arm around her once again.</p><p>\u201cMillie, until next time. Thank you for the company, it was nice&hellip;and listen, if he ever decides to give you up, and you want a serious downgrade, you give me a call.\u201d \u00a0This sets everyone off, and Millie begins to giggle like a schoolgirl.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to this one.\u201d She gives you a quick wink, but her expression turns rather serious as she squints her eyes and points at you. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the good ones, he\u2019s a keeper&hellip;you hear me? Don\u2019t let him go.\u201d</p><p>You gaze upon Sam once again as he tries to gauge your feelings. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>You grab Sam\u2019s hand and pull him outside of the small cafe. The sun is shining, the air is perfect, and you couldn\u2019t be more thankful to Millie and John for coming into your lives that day. You take a few steps before glancing down at your hand, still intertwined with Sam\u2019s. He matches your stare, as you both wait to see who will be the one to let go first, only you don\u2019t. Instead, pulling him into a small alleyway next the cafe. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Watching as you put your drinks and bag of food on a store windowsill, he becomes confused as you stand back up and twist your lips to the side.</p><p>Placing your hand on the back of his neck, you pull him down into a kiss. At first he is stunned and doesn\u2019t react, but quickly recovers catching up to you. His hands wrap around your waist, and he pulls you in closer. Your heart races, the goosebumps return, and he breaks into a smile at your loss of breath.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Is all you can manage to say. You liked it. A lot. You liked the way he held you, kissed you, made you feel safe. He starts to shake his head, almost thankful that you had finally seen it after all these years.</p><p>\u201cIt took you long enou\u2026\u201d He smiles though the kiss when you stop him short, placing both of your arms over his shoulders, enamoured by the feeling of him.</p><p>\u201cYou should have said something.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how.\u201d He brushes his thumb over your cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t have a \u2018Millie\u2019 at the compound to help me.\u201d To this, you both laugh, and as if on cue, Millie and John stroll past the alleyway. Sam watches as they pass, and they grin, pleased to find you in each other\u2019s embrace. You stare at Millie, as if saying a saying a thousand words. </p><p>She wraps her arm tightly around her husband and nods.</p><p>\u201cTreat her well, son, and she\u2019ll be the best damn thing that has ever happened to you.\u201d John speaks firmly to Sam.</p><p>Sam looks into your eyes, before placing a gentle kiss on your forehead. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe already is.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a> @schilj79</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <a href=\"http://awkward-sydney.tumblr.com\">@awkward-sydney</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> @lordemjay</p><p>@lovemarvelousfics \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> @alycu1</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a> @fuckmeupsebastian @samstuffworld @10robins\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a></p>",

Sam was always there, hidden, right in front of you.</p><p>This is my first fic for Sam Wilson. He is one of my favorites, but I never knew what to write for him. Hopefully you guys like this, and I did him justice!</p><p>Word Count: 3,081</p><p>Pairings: Sam x reader</p><p>Warnings: None</p><p>Breakfast. That\u2019s what brought you and your best friend, Sam WIlson, together. Your utter love of all things made before eleven a.m. connected you for life. \u00a0The smell of fresh brewed coffee, muffins, cinnamon flavored pancakes, pastries, and for the love of all that is yummy, bacon. This is what made you bond with him from day one, and has kept your friendship strong. This is also the reason that \u201cBreakfast Bonanza\u201d was started. Friday morning was dedicated to Sam only. You would pick a new breakfast place in the city each week, and then enjoy what they had to offer each Friday morning. Everyone knew that it was your time together, and once breakfast started, you were not to be bothered.</p><p>Today you had arrived separately, as you had been out running errands. Smiling as you approach the table of one of your favorite spots, you see that Sam is already engaged in a conversation with someone on the phone. He waves you towards him, but you hesitate, not wanting to interrupt. Rolling his eyes, imitating a mouth with his hands, he mouths to you that it\u2019s Steve on the phone, making you chuckle. You mouth that it\u2019s fine, pointing to the cafe, letting him know you\u2019ll grab his drink for him. You two had made this a regular coffee date, so you knew each other\u2019s orders by heart.</p><p>The smell of the fresh croissants and coffee made your stomach growl. They had the best selection of breakfast items, and you couldn\u2019t wait to get inside to order. That is, until you saw him. The guy behind the counter always made it a point to somewhat free himself up for your orders. He was sweet, but a bit to aggressive for your liking, so you always tried to avoid him, acting as if you were busy when he was free, then rushing for your items when he was preoccupied with another customer. As soon as the bell rings, he catches your eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Mumbling into your purse, you panic, pretending that you had lost something, and start to frantically search for your \u201cmissing item.\u201d Out of the corner of your eye, you see him walk out from the counter, ready to spring, forcing you to book it out the front door, walking hastily towards Sam. </p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d He holds his hand over the phone, asking Steve to hold on. </p><p>\u201cWill you pretend to be my boyfriend for like twenty minutes, give or take?\u201d You grit your teeth, and shrug a little, knowing the request was completely weird.</p><p>\u201cSteve, I\u2019m gonna need to call you back. What\u2019s going on Y/N/N?\u201d Sam leans forward in his chair, puffing his chest out, like he sensed danger. </p><p>\u201cNothing. Well, no, that\u2019s not\u2026 there\u2019s this guy that works behind the counter\u2026he\u2019s nice, but like too nice, ya know? Like he\u2019s a little socially clingy when I\u2019m here, and he already spotted me, and he\u2019s on the move. I ran out when he left the counter, and I don\u2019t want to go back in by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in. You can just stay here and hold our table.\u201d He goes to stand but you stop him. </p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2026 If you go in, he\u2019s just going to come out here. I kind of want to stop this all together, if at all possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooo, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend, so he\u2019s thinks you\u2019re unavailable, so that he leaves you alone\u2026is that it?\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but grit your teeth again, as a big cocky smile took over his face. </p><p>\u201cYes? I know, I\u2019m horrible!\u201d You felt awful about it, but he really was starting to make you uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201cYes, you are\u2026but I\u2019ll do it if it makes you feel safer.\u201d</p><p>Sam begins to stand, shaking his head at the ridiculousness of the charade you were getting ready to play. \u201cThe things I do for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll owe you one, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one freebie. Next time though\u2026\u201d He stands next to you and lightly puts his arm behind your back. \u201cAlright. How much of a boyfriend do you want? Am I like the casual, \u2018I\u2019m just here because you want to be here\u2019 type guy, or the full experience?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOoh, the full experience guy. Let\u2019s make this one count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s do this. After you beautiful.\u201d His smile makes you gleam as he holds the door open for you, and waves you in. Your face heats up a little, and you almost start to giggle when you feel his hands around your hips, almost guiding you through the patrons, and into the line. As you come to a stop, he takes the opportunity to scope out his surroundings. He slides your hair off of your neck slowly, leaning in to you as he whispers quietly into your ear. \u201cIs that him, two o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>Turning back to look over your shoulder at him, you smile sweetly, as if he told you something amusing. You nod your head yes. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s checking you out, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Now, you and Sam have always been great friends. Would you be a great couple? Probably\u2026 well at least, that\u2019s what everyone always told you. Have you two joked about dating in the past? Sure, who doesn\u2019t on occasion have a \u201cwhat if\u201d conversation with their best friend. You had both agreed during the last conversation that you would indeed make a great couple, but for the sake of the friendship, you would remain just that\u2026friends. Would Sam ask you out in a heartbeat if you ever gave him an inkling that you may want to become more than friends? Of course he would. He\u2019s not crazy, he knows a good thing when he sees it. The question is\u2026do you?</p><p>While standing in line, you notice a older couple three or four people ahead of you. Every few feet, the wife would stop to watch you and Sam, just chit chatting about your day, and whatever was happening in your lifes that week. You would catch her eyes on occasion, smile at her, and she would grin back. </p><p>\u201cBaby, I think that older lady thinks you\u2019re cute.\u201d You turn to whisper in Sam\u2019s ear, keeping up the facade.</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Sam looks deep into your eyes, almost wishing you were. \u201cYou know my heart only belongs to you.\u201d </p><p>Rolling your eyes, you laugh at the corniness of his sappy line. \u201cPlease, get over yourself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmm, I rather get over you.\u201d He winks at you, making your heart skip a beat. </p><p>\u201cSam Wilson!\u201d Your mouth drops as you smack him in his chest. \u201cI cannot believe you just said that to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe half the stuff I would say to you if you let me.\u201d He tries to keep a straight face, but ends up laughing when your eyes shoot open and you cover your ears, and turn your back to him.</p><p>\u201cLalalala, I\u2019m not hearing this.\u201d Which makes you both giggle more.</p><p>He reaches for your hands, pulling them off your head, slipping his fingers between yours. Lowering both your hands, he wraps his thick arms around yours, hugging your waist from behind, never letting go of your fingers. Without even thinking, your head falls back onto his shoulder and rolls into his neck. It shocked you for a moment, how easy it was for you to just fall into him, like it was so natural. </p><p>He tilts his head just enough to place a small kiss on your temple. Why were you so comfortable here, in his arms? Why did this feel so right, like you had been this way for years. The elderly women watches you as Sam starts to sway you gently back and forth. </p><p>\u201cWhat are getting today, love?\u201d He looks over your shoulder at the menu, waiting for you to pick before you reached the counter. </p><p>\u201cEgg and cheddar croissant\u2026ooo, with bacon.\u201d His chest shakes as he begins to laugh again. You loved your bacon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to turn into Bacon.\u201d He squeezes your waist, getting a few fingers in under your ribs, and you buckle from laughter.</p><p>As you approach the counter, and the stage five clinger slides over, trying not to watch you as his coworker takes your order. </p><p>Sam orders for you first, then him, and offers to pay. It was his turn anyway, but it was still sweet of him to do. </p><p>Moving down the way, you wait in the pick up area for your breakfast items. The smell of the bakery made your stomach growl, and you were starting to bounce up and down, doing a small happy dance. Sam just observes you as shake your hips a little, getting ready for you for your order. He loved watching you when you were like this. Your silliness brought out something in him, and it was by far his favorite time to be around you. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d You both look to to the left, and lay eyes upon the elderly woman who had once again been spying on you. \u201cI just wanted to say, you two are just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen. It so obvious how you feel about each other. The way he looks at you\u2026so much love in those beautiful eyes of his.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe does have beautiful eyes, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Sam looks to the floor embarrassed by the attention. </p><p>\u201cLadies please, two beautiful women flirting with me\u2026 I can\u2019t. It\u2019s to early for this!\u201d Sam ever the jokester and flirt, of course, sent the women into a fit of giggles. </p><p>\u201cOh sweetie, I haven\u2019t flirted with a man in sixty years! Not since this one over here swept me off my feet. He looked at me the same way you look at her. I fell in love with him as soon as he smiled at me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so beautiful. How long have you been together?\u201d You didn\u2019t mean to pry, but she was so friendly and welcoming, making you excited to hear more. </p><p>\u201cFifty-seven years, dear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, that can\u2019t be true, because you don\u2019t look a day over thirty.\u201d Ever the flirt, he was.</p><p>She chuckles with delight, making Sam laugh along with her.</p><p>\u201cThat one is a charmer, huh?\u201d She points to Sam who now has his hand around your waist again. </p><p>\u201cThat he is, that he is.\u201d Smiling over to him, he smirks at the game you two continue to play.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for the soul, sweetie, he\u2019ll keep you young at heart, just like mine does.\u201d She points to the approaching man, holding her coffee. \u00a0A handsome gentleman nods at you and Sam, smiling. \u201cDear, this is\u2026I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t even ask your names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N, and this is Sam.\u201d You say waving hi. He reaches out to shake your hand, then reaches for Sam\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cAn Air Force man, huh? I see I left you in good company.\u201d Sam looks down at his shirt, then up to see the man\u2019s hat adorning the USAF logo just above the brim.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Sam\u2019s whole demeanor changes as he stands a bit taller, and stiffens. \u201cFifty-eighth Pararescue, although\u2026I work for a new unit now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmhmm, I thought you looked familiar. First Sergeant Alexander, retired about thirty years now, so you can just call me John. Nice to meet you, Sam and Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just telling them how much they reminded me of us when we were young and in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still young and in love, sweetie.\u201d \u00a0He says as he kisses her cheek, and she taps his face with her free hand. </p><p>You smile and laugh. \u201cWell, now I can see why you fell in love with him so quickly. He\u2019s quite the charmer himself, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you two been together?\u201d She questions as she looks to you both in wonder.</p><p>Oh, I guess we should have come up with a backstory\u2026Sam steps in with no hesitation.</p><p>\u201cTwo years this month.\u201d To this you turn to him, when you realize the reason he had picked this specific time. It has been two years exactly this month when you two had first met. How did he remember that? \u00a0\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t think I would remember the day I fell in love. You need to give me a little more credit, woman.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just\u2026I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever told me that before.\u201d Your eyes drop a little to his chest, and it starts to feel a little bit warm in the room.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart, you can see it all over his face. I bet you feel in love the minute you met her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d The couple watches as you look up into his eyes, wondering if that was really how it all went down.</p><p>\u201cThe minute she told me her name and smiled.\u201d Sam looks deep into your soul, and you get get goosebumps all over your arms, because in that moment, you realized that he wasn\u2019t lying. You knew him well enough to know when he was serious about something, and the look in his eyes told you he was being fully honest about his feelings for you.</p><p>\u201cOh honey, he has it bad. Don\u2019t ever let this one go, or someone is going to snatch him right up!\u201d She rests her hand on your arm, but you barely even noticed. You were so deeply invested in Sam at that moment, that it felt like everything around you had stilled.</p><p>\u201cOrder thirty seven!\u201d The sound of your order being called pulls you out of your trance for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us, baby.\u201d Sam steps up to grab your drinks and food, but you stop him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we could have these to go?\u201d You ask the clinger behind the counter. Sam looks at you confused for a second before you grin back. \u201cI was thinking maybe we could go for a walk.\u201d You take a deep breath and suddenly become very shy, not able to keep your eyes on him. How did you not see this before? The man hands you a bag full of your food, and placed lids on your drinks. \u201cThank you so much, I appreciate it.\u201d Turning back to your new friends, \u00a0you grin before starting to bid them goodbye.</p><p>\u201cThis is us. It was really nice to meet you. I hope that we see you again here. We\u2019re here all the time, so maybe next time we can grab breakfast together and make a morning of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, dear. We\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d You don\u2019t know why, but you felt the sudden need to hug her. Maybe it was because she was so sweet, or because it was like you felt like you had known her all of your life. Maybe it was because you loved the thought of being like them one day, happily married, enjoying each other. Once she smiled back at you though, you realized it was none of those things. It was simply the fact that she had told you, so clearly what everyone else had been trying to tell you all along. You and Sam would be good together. Amazing even, and he already knew it. He was just waiting for you to see it on your own.</p><p>\u201cJohn, it was a pleasure.\u201d Sam reaches out and shakes his hand again. \u201cDon\u2019t ever get rid of this one, she\u2019s a treasure, and you\u2019re a lucky man.\u201d He laughs a bit while looking at his wife, who you had learned was named Millie. </p><p>\u201cNo plans on it, Sam.\u201d He beams, placing his arm around her once again.</p><p>\u201cMillie, until next time. Thank you for the company, it was nice\u2026and listen, if he ever decides to give you up, and you want a serious downgrade, you give me a call.\u201d \u00a0This sets everyone off, and Millie begins to giggle like a schoolgirl.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to this one.\u201d She gives you a quick wink, but her expression turns rather serious as she squints her eyes and points at you. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the good ones, he\u2019s a keeper\u2026you hear me? Don\u2019t let him go.\u201d</p><p>You gaze upon Sam once again as he tries to gauge your feelings. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>You grab Sam\u2019s hand and pull him outside of the small cafe. The sun is shining, the air is perfect, and you couldn\u2019t be more thankful to Millie and John for coming into your lives that day. You take a few steps before glancing down at your hand, still intertwined with Sam\u2019s. He matches your stare, as you both wait to see who will be the one to let go first, only you don\u2019t. Instead, pulling him into a small alleyway next the cafe. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Watching as you put your drinks and bag of food on a store windowsill, he becomes confused as you stand back up and twist your lips to the side.</p><p>Placing your hand on the back of his neck, you pull him down into a kiss. At first he is stunned and doesn\u2019t react, but quickly recovers catching up to you. His hands wrap around your waist, and he pulls you in closer. Your heart races, the goosebumps return, and he breaks into a smile at your loss of breath.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Is all you can manage to say. You liked it. A lot. You liked the way he held you, kissed you, made you feel safe. He starts to shake his head, almost thankful that you had finally seen it after all these years.</p><p>\u201cIt took you long enou\u2026\u201d He smiles though the kiss when you stop him short, placing both of your arms over his shoulders, enamoured by the feeling of him.</p><p>\u201cYou should have said something.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how.\u201d He brushes his thumb over your cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t have a \u2018Millie\u2019 at the compound to help me.\u201d To this, you both laugh, and as if on cue, Millie and John stroll past the alleyway. Sam watches as they pass, and they grin, pleased to find you in each other\u2019s embrace. You stare at Millie, as if saying a saying a thousand words. </p><p>She wraps her arm tightly around her husband and nods.</p><p>\u201cTreat her well, son, and she\u2019ll be the best damn thing that has ever happened to you.\u201d John speaks firmly to Sam.</p><p>Sam looks into your eyes, before placing a gentle kiss on your forehead. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe already is.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a> @schilj79</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <a href=\"http://awkward-sydney.tumblr.com\">@awkward-sydney</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> @lordemjay</p><p>@lovemarvelousfics \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> @alycu1</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a> @fuckmeupsebastian @samstuffworld @10robins\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a></p></p>",

Sam was always there, hidden, right in front of you.</p><p>This is my first fic for Sam Wilson. He is one of my favorites, but I never knew what to write for him. Hopefully you guys like this, and I did him justice!</p><p>Word Count: 3,081</p><p>Pairings: Sam x reader</p><p>Warnings: None</p><p>Breakfast. That\u2019s what brought you and your best friend, Sam WIlson, together. Your utter love of all things made before eleven a.m. connected you for life. \u00a0The smell of fresh brewed coffee, muffins, cinnamon flavored pancakes, pastries, and for the love of all that is yummy, bacon. This is what made you bond with him from day one, and has kept your friendship strong. This is also the reason that \u201cBreakfast Bonanza\u201d was started. Friday morning was dedicated to Sam only. You would pick a new breakfast place in the city each week, and then enjoy what they had to offer each Friday morning. Everyone knew that it was your time together, and once breakfast started, you were not to be bothered.</p><p>Today you had arrived separately, as you had been out running errands. Smiling as you approach the table of one of your favorite spots, you see that Sam is already engaged in a conversation with someone on the phone. He waves you towards him, but you hesitate, not wanting to interrupt. Rolling his eyes, imitating a mouth with his hands, he mouths to you that it\u2019s Steve on the phone, making you chuckle. You mouth that it\u2019s fine, pointing to the cafe, letting him know you\u2019ll grab his drink for him. You two had made this a regular coffee date, so you knew each other\u2019s orders by heart.</p><p>The smell of the fresh croissants and coffee made your stomach growl. They had the best selection of breakfast items, and you couldn\u2019t wait to get inside to order. That is, until you saw him. The guy behind the counter always made it a point to somewhat free himself up for your orders. He was sweet, but a bit to aggressive for your liking, so you always tried to avoid him, acting as if you were busy when he was free, then rushing for your items when he was preoccupied with another customer. As soon as the bell rings, he catches your eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Mumbling into your purse, you panic, pretending that you had lost something, and start to frantically search for your \u201cmissing item.\u201d Out of the corner of your eye, you see him walk out from the counter, ready to spring, forcing you to book it out the front door, walking hastily towards Sam. </p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d He holds his hand over the phone, asking Steve to hold on. </p><p>\u201cWill you pretend to be my boyfriend for like twenty minutes, give or take?\u201d You grit your teeth, and shrug a little, knowing the request was completely weird.</p><p>\u201cSteve, I\u2019m gonna need to call you back. What\u2019s going on Y/N/N?\u201d Sam leans forward in his chair, puffing his chest out, like he sensed danger. </p><p>\u201cNothing. Well, no, that\u2019s not\u2026 there\u2019s this guy that works behind the counter\u2026he\u2019s nice, but like too nice, ya know? Like he\u2019s a little socially clingy when I\u2019m here, and he already spotted me, and he\u2019s on the move. I ran out when he left the counter, and I don\u2019t want to go back in by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in. You can just stay here and hold our table.\u201d He goes to stand but you stop him. </p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2026 If you go in, he\u2019s just going to come out here. I kind of want to stop this all together, if at all possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooo, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend, so he\u2019s thinks you\u2019re unavailable, so that he leaves you alone\u2026is that it?\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but grit your teeth again, as a big cocky smile took over his face. </p><p>\u201cYes? I know, I\u2019m horrible!\u201d You felt awful about it, but he really was starting to make you uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201cYes, you are\u2026but I\u2019ll do it if it makes you feel safer.\u201d</p><p>Sam begins to stand, shaking his head at the ridiculousness of the charade you were getting ready to play. \u201cThe things I do for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll owe you one, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one freebie. Next time though\u2026\u201d He stands next to you and lightly puts his arm behind your back. \u201cAlright. How much of a boyfriend do you want? Am I like the casual, \u2018I\u2019m just here because you want to be here\u2019 type guy, or the full experience?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOoh, the full experience guy. Let\u2019s make this one count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s do this. After you beautiful.\u201d His smile makes you gleam as he holds the door open for you, and waves you in. Your face heats up a little, and you almost start to giggle when you feel his hands around your hips, almost guiding you through the patrons, and into the line. As you come to a stop, he takes the opportunity to scope out his surroundings. He slides your hair off of your neck slowly, leaning in to you as he whispers quietly into your ear. \u201cIs that him, two o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>Turning back to look over your shoulder at him, you smile sweetly, as if he told you something amusing. You nod your head yes. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s checking you out, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Now, you and Sam have always been great friends. Would you be a great couple? Probably\u2026 well at least, that\u2019s what everyone always told you. Have you two joked about dating in the past? Sure, who doesn\u2019t on occasion have a \u201cwhat if\u201d conversation with their best friend. You had both agreed during the last conversation that you would indeed make a great couple, but for the sake of the friendship, you would remain just that\u2026friends. Would Sam ask you out in a heartbeat if you ever gave him an inkling that you may want to become more than friends? Of course he would. He\u2019s not crazy, he knows a good thing when he sees it. The question is\u2026do you?</p><p>While standing in line, you notice a older couple three or four people ahead of you. Every few feet, the wife would stop to watch you and Sam, just chit chatting about your day, and whatever was happening in your lifes that week. You would catch her eyes on occasion, smile at her, and she would grin back. </p><p>\u201cBaby, I think that older lady thinks you\u2019re cute.\u201d You turn to whisper in Sam\u2019s ear, keeping up the facade.</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Sam looks deep into your eyes, almost wishing you were. \u201cYou know my heart only belongs to you.\u201d </p><p>Rolling your eyes, you laugh at the corniness of his sappy line. \u201cPlease, get over yourself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmm, I rather get over you.\u201d He winks at you, making your heart skip a beat. </p><p>\u201cSam Wilson!\u201d Your mouth drops as you smack him in his chest. \u201cI cannot believe you just said that to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe half the stuff I would say to you if you let me.\u201d He tries to keep a straight face, but ends up laughing when your eyes shoot open and you cover your ears, and turn your back to him.</p><p>\u201cLalalala, I\u2019m not hearing this.\u201d Which makes you both giggle more.</p><p>He reaches for your hands, pulling them off your head, slipping his fingers between yours. Lowering both your hands, he wraps his thick arms around yours, hugging your waist from behind, never letting go of your fingers. Without even thinking, your head falls back onto his shoulder and rolls into his neck. It shocked you for a moment, how easy it was for you to just fall into him, like it was so natural. </p><p>He tilts his head just enough to place a small kiss on your temple. Why were you so comfortable here, in his arms? Why did this feel so right, like you had been this way for years. The elderly women watches you as Sam starts to sway you gently back and forth. </p><p>\u201cWhat are getting today, love?\u201d He looks over your shoulder at the menu, waiting for you to pick before you reached the counter. </p><p>\u201cEgg and cheddar croissant\u2026ooo, with bacon.\u201d His chest shakes as he begins to laugh again. You loved your bacon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to turn into Bacon.\u201d He squeezes your waist, getting a few fingers in under your ribs, and you buckle from laughter.</p><p>As you approach the counter, and the stage five clinger slides over, trying not to watch you as his coworker takes your order. </p><p>Sam orders for you first, then him, and offers to pay. It was his turn anyway, but it was still sweet of him to do. </p><p>Moving down the way, you wait in the pick up area for your breakfast items. The smell of the bakery made your stomach growl, and you were starting to bounce up and down, doing a small happy dance. Sam just observes you as shake your hips a little, getting ready for you for your order. He loved watching you when you were like this. Your silliness brought out something in him, and it was by far his favorite time to be around you. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d You both look to to the left, and lay eyes upon the elderly woman who had once again been spying on you. \u201cI just wanted to say, you two are just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen. It so obvious how you feel about each other. The way he looks at you\u2026so much love in those beautiful eyes of his.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe does have beautiful eyes, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Sam looks to the floor embarrassed by the attention. </p><p>\u201cLadies please, two beautiful women flirting with me\u2026 I can\u2019t. It\u2019s to early for this!\u201d Sam ever the jokester and flirt, of course, sent the women into a fit of giggles. </p><p>\u201cOh sweetie, I haven\u2019t flirted with a man in sixty years! Not since this one over here swept me off my feet. He looked at me the same way you look at her. I fell in love with him as soon as he smiled at me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so beautiful. How long have you been together?\u201d You didn\u2019t mean to pry, but she was so friendly and welcoming, making you excited to hear more. </p><p>\u201cFifty-seven years, dear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, that can\u2019t be true, because you don\u2019t look a day over thirty.\u201d Ever the flirt, he was.</p><p>She chuckles with delight, making Sam laugh along with her.</p><p>\u201cThat one is a charmer, huh?\u201d She points to Sam who now has his hand around your waist again. </p><p>\u201cThat he is, that he is.\u201d Smiling over to him, he smirks at the game you two continue to play.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for the soul, sweetie, he\u2019ll keep you young at heart, just like mine does.\u201d She points to the approaching man, holding her coffee. \u00a0A handsome gentleman nods at you and Sam, smiling. \u201cDear, this is\u2026I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t even ask your names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N, and this is Sam.\u201d You say waving hi. He reaches out to shake your hand, then reaches for Sam\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cAn Air Force man, huh? I see I left you in good company.\u201d Sam looks down at his shirt, then up to see the man\u2019s hat adorning the USAF logo just above the brim.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Sam\u2019s whole demeanor changes as he stands a bit taller, and stiffens. \u201cFifty-eighth Pararescue, although\u2026I work for a new unit now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmhmm, I thought you looked familiar. First Sergeant Alexander, retired about thirty years now, so you can just call me John. Nice to meet you, Sam and Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just telling them how much they reminded me of us when we were young and in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still young and in love, sweetie.\u201d \u00a0He says as he kisses her cheek, and she taps his face with her free hand. </p><p>You smile and laugh. \u201cWell, now I can see why you fell in love with him so quickly. He\u2019s quite the charmer himself, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you two been together?\u201d She questions as she looks to you both in wonder.</p><p>Oh, I guess we should have come up with a backstory\u2026Sam steps in with no hesitation.</p><p>\u201cTwo years this month.\u201d To this you turn to him, when you realize the reason he had picked this specific time. It has been two years exactly this month when you two had first met. How did he remember that? \u00a0\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t think I would remember the day I fell in love. You need to give me a little more credit, woman.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just\u2026I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever told me that before.\u201d Your eyes drop a little to his chest, and it starts to feel a little bit warm in the room.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart, you can see it all over his face. I bet you feel in love the minute you met her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d The couple watches as you look up into his eyes, wondering if that was really how it all went down.</p><p>\u201cThe minute she told me her name and smiled.\u201d Sam looks deep into your soul, and you get get goosebumps all over your arms, because in that moment, you realized that he wasn\u2019t lying. You knew him well enough to know when he was serious about something, and the look in his eyes told you he was being fully honest about his feelings for you.</p><p>\u201cOh honey, he has it bad. Don\u2019t ever let this one go, or someone is going to snatch him right up!\u201d She rests her hand on your arm, but you barely even noticed. You were so deeply invested in Sam at that moment, that it felt like everything around you had stilled.</p><p>\u201cOrder thirty seven!\u201d The sound of your order being called pulls you out of your trance for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us, baby.\u201d Sam steps up to grab your drinks and food, but you stop him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we could have these to go?\u201d You ask the clinger behind the counter. Sam looks at you confused for a second before you grin back. \u201cI was thinking maybe we could go for a walk.\u201d You take a deep breath and suddenly become very shy, not able to keep your eyes on him. How did you not see this before? The man hands you a bag full of your food, and placed lids on your drinks. \u201cThank you so much, I appreciate it.\u201d Turning back to your new friends, \u00a0you grin before starting to bid them goodbye.</p><p>\u201cThis is us. It was really nice to meet you. I hope that we see you again here. We\u2019re here all the time, so maybe next time we can grab breakfast together and make a morning of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, dear. We\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d You don\u2019t know why, but you felt the sudden need to hug her. Maybe it was because she was so sweet, or because it was like you felt like you had known her all of your life. Maybe it was because you loved the thought of being like them one day, happily married, enjoying each other. Once she smiled back at you though, you realized it was none of those things. It was simply the fact that she had told you, so clearly what everyone else had been trying to tell you all along. You and Sam would be good together. Amazing even, and he already knew it. He was just waiting for you to see it on your own.</p><p>\u201cJohn, it was a pleasure.\u201d Sam reaches out and shakes his hand again. \u201cDon\u2019t ever get rid of this one, she\u2019s a treasure, and you\u2019re a lucky man.\u201d He laughs a bit while looking at his wife, who you had learned was named Millie. </p><p>\u201cNo plans on it, Sam.\u201d He beams, placing his arm around her once again.</p><p>\u201cMillie, until next time. Thank you for the company, it was nice\u2026and listen, if he ever decides to give you up, and you want a serious downgrade, you give me a call.\u201d \u00a0This sets everyone off, and Millie begins to giggle like a schoolgirl.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to this one.\u201d She gives you a quick wink, but her expression turns rather serious as she squints her eyes and points at you. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the good ones, he\u2019s a keeper\u2026you hear me? Don\u2019t let him go.\u201d</p><p>You gaze upon Sam once again as he tries to gauge your feelings. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>You grab Sam\u2019s hand and pull him outside of the small cafe. The sun is shining, the air is perfect, and you couldn\u2019t be more thankful to Millie and John for coming into your lives that day. You take a few steps before glancing down at your hand, still intertwined with Sam\u2019s. He matches your stare, as you both wait to see who will be the one to let go first, only you don\u2019t. Instead, pulling him into a small alleyway next the cafe. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Watching as you put your drinks and bag of food on a store windowsill, he becomes confused as you stand back up and twist your lips to the side.</p><p>Placing your hand on the back of his neck, you pull him down into a kiss. At first he is stunned and doesn\u2019t react, but quickly recovers catching up to you. His hands wrap around your waist, and he pulls you in closer. Your heart races, the goosebumps return, and he breaks into a smile at your loss of breath.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Is all you can manage to say. You liked it. A lot. You liked the way he held you, kissed you, made you feel safe. He starts to shake his head, almost thankful that you had finally seen it after all these years.</p><p>\u201cIt took you long enou\u2026\u201d He smiles though the kiss when you stop him short, placing both of your arms over his shoulders, enamoured by the feeling of him.</p><p>\u201cYou should have said something.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how.\u201d He brushes his thumb over your cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t have a \u2018Millie\u2019 at the compound to help me.\u201d To this, you both laugh, and as if on cue, Millie and John stroll past the alleyway. Sam watches as they pass, and they grin, pleased to find you in each other\u2019s embrace. You stare at Millie, as if saying a saying a thousand words. </p><p>She wraps her arm tightly around her husband and nods.</p><p>\u201cTreat her well, son, and she\u2019ll be the best damn thing that has ever happened to you.\u201d John speaks firmly to Sam.</p><p>Sam looks into your eyes, before placing a gentle kiss on your forehead. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe already is.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a> @schilj79</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <a href=\"http://awkward-sydney.tumblr.com\">@awkward-sydney</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> @lordemjay</p><p>@lovemarvelousfics \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> @alycu1</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a> @fuckmeupsebastian @samstuffworld @10robins\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a></p></p>",

Sam was always there, hidden, right in front of you.</p><p>This is my first fic for Sam Wilson. He is one of my favorites, but I never knew what to write for him. Hopefully you guys like this, and I did him justice!</p><p>Word Count: 3,081</p><p>Pairings: Sam x reader</p><p>Warnings: None</p><p>Breakfast. That&rsquo;s what brought you and your best friend, Sam WIlson, together. Your utter love of all things made before eleven a.m. connected you for life. &nbsp;The smell of fresh brewed coffee, muffins, cinnamon flavored pancakes, pastries, and for the love of all that is yummy, bacon. This is what made you bond with him from day one, and has kept your friendship strong. This is also the reason that &ldquo;Breakfast Bonanza&rdquo; was started. Friday morning was dedicated to Sam only. You would pick a new breakfast place in the city each week, and then enjoy what they had to offer each Friday morning. Everyone knew that it was your time together, and once breakfast started, you were not to be bothered.</p><p>Today you had arrived separately, as you had been out running errands. Smiling as you approach the table of one of your favorite spots, you see that Sam is already engaged in a conversation with someone on the phone. He waves you towards him, but you hesitate, not wanting to interrupt. Rolling his eyes, imitating a mouth with his hands, he mouths to you that it&rsquo;s Steve on the phone, making you chuckle. You mouth that it&rsquo;s fine, pointing to the cafe, letting him know you&rsquo;ll grab his drink for him. You two had made this a regular coffee date, so you knew each other&rsquo;s orders by heart.</p><p>The smell of the fresh croissants and coffee made your stomach growl. They had the best selection of breakfast items, and you couldn&rsquo;t wait to get inside to order. That is, until you saw him. The guy behind the counter always made it a point to somewhat free himself up for your orders. He was sweet, but a bit to aggressive for your liking, so you always tried to avoid him, acting as if you were busy when he was free, then rushing for your items when he was preoccupied with another customer. As soon as the bell rings, he catches your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo; Mumbling into your purse, you panic, pretending that you had lost something, and start to frantically search for your &ldquo;missing item.&rdquo; Out of the corner of your eye, you see him walk out from the counter, ready to spring, forcing you to book it out the front door, walking hastily towards Sam. </p><p>&ldquo;Everything okay?&rdquo; He holds his hand over the phone, asking Steve to hold on. </p><p>&ldquo;Will you pretend to be my boyfriend for like twenty minutes, give or take?&rdquo; You grit your teeth, and shrug a little, knowing the request was completely weird.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve, I&rsquo;m gonna need to call you back. What&rsquo;s going on Y/N/N?&rdquo; Sam leans forward in his chair, puffing his chest out, like he sensed danger. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing. Well, no, that&rsquo;s not&hellip; there&rsquo;s this guy that works behind the counter&hellip;he&rsquo;s nice, but like too nice, ya know? Like he&rsquo;s a little socially clingy when I&rsquo;m here, and he already spotted me, and he&rsquo;s on the move. I ran out when he left the counter, and I don&rsquo;t want to go back in by myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in. You can just stay here and hold our table.&rdquo; He goes to stand but you stop him. </p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not&hellip; If you go in, he&rsquo;s just going to come out here. I kind of want to stop this all together, if at all possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sooo, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend, so he&rsquo;s thinks you&rsquo;re unavailable, so that he leaves you alone&hellip;is that it?&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t help but grit your teeth again, as a big cocky smile took over his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes? I know, I&rsquo;m horrible!&rdquo; You felt awful about it, but he really was starting to make you uncomfortable. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you are&hellip;but I&rsquo;ll do it if it makes you feel safer.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam begins to stand, shaking his head at the ridiculousness of the charade you were getting ready to play. &ldquo;The things I do for you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll owe you one, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one freebie. Next time though&hellip;&rdquo; He stands next to you and lightly puts his arm behind your back. &ldquo;Alright. How much of a boyfriend do you want? Am I like the casual, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m just here because you want to be here&rsquo; type guy, or the full experience?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, the full experience guy. Let&rsquo;s make this one count.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright then, let&rsquo;s do this. After you beautiful.&rdquo; His smile makes you gleam as he holds the door open for you, and waves you in. Your face heats up a little, and you almost start to giggle when you feel his hands around your hips, almost guiding you through the patrons, and into the line. As you come to a stop, he takes the opportunity to scope out his surroundings. He slides your hair off of your neck slowly, leaning in to you as he whispers quietly into your ear. &ldquo;Is that him, two o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p><p>Turning back to look over your shoulder at him, you smile sweetly, as if he told you something amusing. You nod your head yes. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s checking you out, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Now, you and Sam have always been great friends. Would you be a great couple? Probably&hellip; well at least, that&rsquo;s what everyone always told you. Have you two joked about dating in the past? Sure, who doesn&rsquo;t on occasion have a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; conversation with their best friend. You had both agreed during the last conversation that you would indeed make a great couple, but for the sake of the friendship, you would remain just that&hellip;friends. Would Sam ask you out in a heartbeat if you ever gave him an inkling that you may want to become more than friends? Of course he would. He&rsquo;s not crazy, he knows a good thing when he sees it. The question is&hellip;do you?</p><p>While standing in line, you notice a older couple three or four people ahead of you. Every few feet, the wife would stop to watch you and Sam, just chit chatting about your day, and whatever was happening in your lifes that week. You would catch her eyes on occasion, smile at her, and she would grin back. </p><p>&ldquo;Baby, I think that older lady thinks you&rsquo;re cute.&rdquo; You turn to whisper in Sam&rsquo;s ear, keeping up the facade.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you jealous?&rdquo; Sam looks deep into your eyes, almost wishing you were. &ldquo;You know my heart only belongs to you.&rdquo; </p><p>Rolling your eyes, you laugh at the corniness of his sappy line. &ldquo;Please, get over yourself.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, I rather get over you.&rdquo; He winks at you, making your heart skip a beat. </p><p>&ldquo;Sam Wilson!&rdquo; Your mouth drops as you smack him in his chest. &ldquo;I cannot believe you just said that to me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe half the stuff I would say to you if you let me.&rdquo; He tries to keep a straight face, but ends up laughing when your eyes shoot open and you cover your ears, and turn your back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Lalalala, I&rsquo;m not hearing this.&rdquo; Which makes you both giggle more.</p><p>He reaches for your hands, pulling them off your head, slipping his fingers between yours. Lowering both your hands, he wraps his thick arms around yours, hugging your waist from behind, never letting go of your fingers. Without even thinking, your head falls back onto his shoulder and rolls into his neck. It shocked you for a moment, how easy it was for you to just fall into him, like it was so natural. </p><p>He tilts his head just enough to place a small kiss on your temple. Why were you so comfortable here, in his arms? Why did this feel so right, like you had been this way for years. The elderly women watches you as Sam starts to sway you gently back and forth. </p><p>&ldquo;What are getting today, love?&rdquo; He looks over your shoulder at the menu, waiting for you to pick before you reached the counter. </p><p>&ldquo;Egg and cheddar croissant&hellip;ooo, with bacon.&rdquo; His chest shakes as he begins to laugh again. You loved your bacon.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to turn into Bacon.&rdquo; He squeezes your waist, getting a few fingers in under your ribs, and you buckle from laughter.</p><p>As you approach the counter, and the stage five clinger slides over, trying not to watch you as his coworker takes your order. </p><p>Sam orders for you first, then him, and offers to pay. It was his turn anyway, but it was still sweet of him to do. </p><p>Moving down the way, you wait in the pick up area for your breakfast items. The smell of the bakery made your stomach growl, and you were starting to bounce up and down, doing a small happy dance. Sam just observes you as shake your hips a little, getting ready for you for your order. He loved watching you when you were like this. Your silliness brought out something in him, and it was by far his favorite time to be around you. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; You both look to to the left, and lay eyes upon the elderly woman who had once again been spying on you. &ldquo;I just wanted to say, you two are just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen. It so obvious how you feel about each other. The way he looks at you&hellip;so much love in those beautiful eyes of his.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He does have beautiful eyes, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Sam looks to the floor embarrassed by the attention. </p><p>&ldquo;Ladies please, two beautiful women flirting with me&hellip; I can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s to early for this!&rdquo; Sam ever the jokester and flirt, of course, sent the women into a fit of giggles. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh sweetie, I haven&rsquo;t flirted with a man in sixty years! Not since this one over here swept me off my feet. He looked at me the same way you look at her. I fell in love with him as soon as he smiled at me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so beautiful. How long have you been together?&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t mean to pry, but she was so friendly and welcoming, making you excited to hear more. </p><p>&ldquo;Fifty-seven years, dear.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, that can&rsquo;t be true, because you don&rsquo;t look a day over thirty.&rdquo; Ever the flirt, he was.</p><p>She chuckles with delight, making Sam laugh along with her.</p><p>&ldquo;That one is a charmer, huh?&rdquo; She points to Sam who now has his hand around your waist again. </p><p>&ldquo;That he is, that he is.&rdquo; Smiling over to him, he smirks at the game you two continue to play.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for the soul, sweetie, he&rsquo;ll keep you young at heart, just like mine does.&rdquo; She points to the approaching man, holding her coffee. &nbsp;A handsome gentleman nods at you and Sam, smiling. &ldquo;Dear, this is&hellip;I&rsquo;m so sorry, I didn&rsquo;t even ask your names.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Y/N, and this is Sam.&rdquo; You say waving hi. He reaches out to shake your hand, then reaches for Sam&rsquo;s. </p><p>&ldquo;An Air Force man, huh? I see I left you in good company.&rdquo; Sam looks down at his shirt, then up to see the man&rsquo;s hat adorning the USAF logo just above the brim.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;s whole demeanor changes as he stands a bit taller, and stiffens. &ldquo;Fifty-eighth Pararescue, although&hellip;I work for a new unit now.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mmhmm, I thought you looked familiar.

Instead, pulling him into a small alleyway next the cafe. </p><p>&ldquo;What are we doing?&rdquo; Watching as you put your drinks and bag of food on a store windowsill, he becomes confused as you stand back up and twist your lips to the side.</p><p>Placing your hand on the back of his neck, you pull him down into a kiss. At first he is stunned and doesn&rsquo;t react, but quickly recovers catching up to you. His hands wrap around your waist, and he pulls you in closer. Your heart races, the goosebumps return, and he breaks into a smile at your loss of breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Is all you can manage to say. You liked it. A lot. You liked the way he held you, kissed you, made you feel safe. He starts to shake his head, almost thankful that you had finally seen it after all these years.</p><p>&ldquo;It took you long enou&hellip;&rdquo; He smiles though the kiss when you stop him short, placing both of your arms over his shoulders, enamoured by the feeling of him.</p><p>&ldquo;You should have said something.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo; He brushes his thumb over your cheek. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a &lsquo;Millie&rsquo; at the compound to help me.&rdquo; To this, you both laugh, and as if on cue, Millie and John stroll past the alleyway. Sam watches as they pass, and they grin, pleased to find you in each other&rsquo;s embrace. You stare at Millie, as if saying a saying a thousand words. </p><p>She wraps her arm tightly around her husband and nods.</p><p>&ldquo;Treat her well, son, and she&rsquo;ll be the best damn thing that has ever happened to you.&rdquo; John speaks firmly to Sam.</p><p>Sam looks into your eyes, before placing a gentle kiss on your forehead. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She already is.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a> @schilj79</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <a href=\"http://awkward-sydney.tumblr.com\">@awkward-sydney</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> @lordemjay</p><p>@lovemarvelousfics &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> @alycu1</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a> @fuckmeupsebastian @samstuffworld @10robins&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a></p></p>",
