Forgive me for any of my wrong knowledge. I\u2019m setting it after the conclusion of the show. You can assign who the Queen is.</b></i></p><p>Althea Mersen, eldest daughter and Lady of the Reach felt like an uncontrolled teenager as she sat in her study. The sun was streaming in and it seemed to warm her even more than the pink that was flushing her cheeks. He had ruined her all over again. </p><p>Even with a continent between them he was still making her fall in love with him without knowing it. Althea stood by her sentiment that she had told Tyrion the first time he had come to visit her when she was first settling in the Reach. Every woman who meets Jon Snow in some way falls in love with him. Be it for his courage, his loyalty, his battle prowess, his beauty, or his quiet charm. </p><p>There are some women who experience all of these factors and those are always the women who fall the hardest. Althea had been so lucky, and she was still a puddle at his words. His first letter since the Queen\u2019s corrination. She leaned forward and picked up the letter again, just to imprint the words into her brain.</p><p><i>My dearest, Althea</i></p><p><i>I have returned to Winterfell mostly unscathed. My wounds are healing nicely and I must thank you and the Maesters for that. I will struggle to know what to do with myself with no war and no fight to be fought. Sansa will settle well into this life, I\u2019m unsure about Arya though. This peace shall ease the both of us and perhaps as you say \u201cstop my brooding lines.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I do miss you. And I wish duty will allow us to see each other again. Until then the ravens will get their feed. Do tell me how the Reach is, I\u2019ve never had the honor of visiting there. (Not that Catlyn would have allowed it). </i></p><p>-<i>Jon</i></p><p>Not one for fancy send offs, but that\u2019s not what had her scrapping and rewriting letters senselessly. No it was much more subtle than that.</p><p>One stroke of a quill had eaten every waking moment of her spare time.</p><p>\u201cMy dearest, Althea.\u201d</p><p>With the comma after dearest.</p><p>Knowing Jon, she was almost completely certain this meant nothing. But some small part of her that would always carry a torch for him until the day she was put into the Earth was captivated by that simple phrase. She leaned back over and set the letter back down. She picked up a quill and started writing a letter she very quickly she could never send.</p><p><i>My dearest Jon,</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m glad to here that you have returned to the North and that you have considered easing your brooding lines. The Reach is lovely if not a bit excessive for most of my tastes. I\u2019m making the most of it. I\u2019m also certain that with time, Arya will make the adjustment to living in peace.</i></p><p><i>In the last letter I received from you, I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase. It changed the meaning, did you intend this? It says \u201cMy dearest Althea\u201d with the comma after dearest. You\u2019ve written \u201cMy dearest, Althea.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I miss you as well Jon.
