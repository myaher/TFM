(There are spoilers in this chapters, but are they really spoilers if you don\u2019t know they\u2019re spoilers? ;) )</b></p><p><b>Warning: a bit of smut, a bit of angst, a bunch of fluff.</b></p><p>.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to keep these?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N holds up a box of old books she found in Harry\u2019s closet and\u00a0tries not to kick over the carton boxes, or step on random objects lying on the bedroom floor, as she brings it to him.\u00a0</p><p>He picks up one book, checks the front cover, and the back, then puts it back inside the box.</p><p>\u201cThey can go,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI know an old bookstore that may want to rebuy them,\u201d she tells him, setting the box down and dusting off her hands. \u201cDo you think we\u2019re keeping too many stuff?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re the one who wouldn\u2019t let me throw away most of them, including those Christmas decorations from last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas isn\u2019t a one time thing, H! We can reuse them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well just pack the whole flat with you to our new one.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolls her eyes and sits down on the floor, sighing as she does. Harry\u2019s right, she should probably get rid of what they haven\u2019t touched in over a year. It\u2019s impossible to bring everything to their new place, but she\u2019s trying to keep as many as possible. Throwing something in this flat away makes her heart sting, because everything here holds a memory of her and Harry and she\u2019s not ready to let go just yet, even though they\u2019re moving out <i>tomorrow</i>.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is really happening,\u201d Y/N mumbles when she pulls out a box from under Harry\u2019s bed and\u00a0opens it. Harry soon joins her on the floor and helps her unbox another one.</p><p>\u201cLove, you said the exact same thing last week at our graduation,\u201d he tells her, chuckling a little bit at her facial expression.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me! Everything is just moving too fast!\u201d She replies with a sigh.\u00a0</p><p>It feels as if they\u2019d only met yesterday, and their time in university had already passed in just a blink of an eye. Harry may not care a lot about leaving this place, in fact he seems like he\u2019s actually happy now that they\u2019re moving into a bigger flat. Y/N, on the other hand, struggles to let go of the past and begins anew.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N questions when she catches Harry smirking at her.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about our new life together, s\u2019all.\u201d His answer makes her smile, but then he furrows his eyebrows and pulls a very serious face which gets her confused for a second. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s still not too late for you to back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, you said the exact same thing when we first met!\u201d Her almost accurate imitation of his voice cracks him up.</p><p>\u201cThat impression was spot on,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>Y/N responses to Harry with a proud smile on her face, then she resumes checking what\u2019s inside the box between her legs. This one is full of her boyfriend\u2019s old clothes, most of these Harry hasn\u2019t touched in years. She goes through it real quick, then a piece of clothing really catches her eyes. She excitedly pulls out a red sweater with a huge Santa Claus head printed on the front and the words \u2018<i>Merry Christmas\u2019</i>\u00a0on the back. It\u2019s pretty extra, she must admit, but that was why she bought it in the first place.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI got you this on our first Christmas here!\u201d She shows it to him with a wide smile on her face whereas he groans and covers his with both hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh God, that sweater!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s cute! How come I\u2019ve never seen you wear it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s way too\u2026<i>much,</i> Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Y/N puckers up her forehead and shoves the sweater back inside the box, pouting as she tells him, \u201cfine! If you hate my Christmas gift so much I\u2019ll throw it away then!\u201d</p><p>Hearing her say that and seeing her facial expression amuses Harry, he thinks she looks cute when she\u2019s pretending to be mad. So before she can close the box, he pulls it away from her and takes out the sweater himself. Without saying a word, Harry puts it on, smiling as he does a ridiculous pose in the awfully uncomfortable sweater.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N cannot keep a straight face anymore. She tosses her head back and laughs, then finally agrees that he does look silly in it.</p><p>The two continues going through the rest of Harry\u2019s closet. They need to get the work in here done so as to move to Y/N\u2019s room, and take care of the mess over there.\u00a0</p><p>While Y/N is folding the old t-shirts that don\u2019t fit Harry anymore and putting them in another box, which she\u2019s labeled <i>\u201cgiveaway\u201d</i>, Harry cannot take his eyes off her. He likes to watch his girlfriend when she\u2019s not looking, to secretly admire how adorable she is every time she does something unintentionally. Like the way she purses her lips, the way she scrunches her nose, how she furrows her eyebrows, the smile on her face when she thinks he\u2019s not paying attention.\u00a0</p><p>He just loves watching her do things, that\u2019s all.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out tonight and celebrate us moving out!\u201d He suddenly breaks the comfortable silence between the two of them, causing Y/N to look up from the shirt in her hands.</p><p>\u201cUgh\u2026I wish I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got other plans for tonight?\u201d He asks, sounding a bit disappointed because he thought they\u2019d get to spend their last night in this flat together.</p><p>\u201cMy boss asked me to go see a client with him. I couldn\u2019t say no, I\u2019ve only been working there for a week now, gotta stay relevant, right?\u201d she tells him, giggling a little bit to lighten up the mood, but Harry only replies with a simple nod.\u00a0</p><p>He seems really let down and she can\u2019t blame him for that. So Y/N gets up on all fours then crawls to Harry\u2019s side, hugging him tightly and laying her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow night?\u201d She suggests, glancing up to watch his reaction. \u201cIf we cannot celebrate us moving out, we can celebrate us moving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally says and turns his head to face her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot mad at me anymore?\u201d she questions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re cute.\u201d He exhales a smile before leaning in and pecking her lips. How can he ever get mad at her to begin with?</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>Harry rises up from his bed, the naked brunette lying beside him begs him to stay, but he just gives her a quick kiss, and promises to make it up to her once he returns.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s around 2AM now, or so, he doesn\u2019t really pay attention when he glances at the clock on the kitchen wall. He only intends to get a glass of water and heads back for another round with that pretty girl. He doesn\u2019t expect his flatmate Y/N to still be awake at this hour, because why would she?</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The voice catches Harry by surprise. He looks up, a bit taken aback to see Y/N walk through the kitchen door. She stops in front of him with her hands laying flat on the kitchen table. He assumes the noises from his bedroom earlier woke her up, but she looks too happy for someone whose sleep was interrupted.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d She asks.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAn hour ago,\u201d he replies shortly. It takes her a moment, but somehow she figures it out on her own.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs there someone in your room?\u201d The question comes with a nervous laugh. Harry has no idea how she knows it, but he\u2019s not going to lie to her now.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah.\u201d He admits without hesitation, but then instantly regrets it once he sees her smile fade away.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019s never cared about what she thinks about his complicated \u201crelationships\u201d, why does he care now? Why does he feel guilty for telling her this? Why does she look so sad? Does she care who he\u2019s with? Those questions are spinning around Harry\u2019s head as he waits for her to say something else. However\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh\u2026,\u201d is her only reply.</i></p><p><i>Harry puts the glass of water down and stares at her with his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if we woke you up, promise we won\u2019t be too loud later.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He honestly doesn\u2019t know why he said that. Maybe he\u2019s just trying to prove that he doesn\u2019t care about how she feels (if she does feel anything about this), but the problem is, he <b>does</b> care about how she feels. He is worried and wants to know why she\u2019s up so late, and whether she\u2019s been waiting for him to come home or not. His pride doesn\u2019t allow him to ask her.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m going back to bed now,\u201d she tells him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d he says when she turns away, However, she doesn\u2019t respond, and Harry feels bad, really bad.</i></p><p><i>He walks back to his room and the naked brunette sits up as soon as she sees him. He feels her chest pressed against his back when he takes a seat on the edge of the bed. Her hot lips leave wet kisses from behind his ear down to his shoulder blade while she\u2019s moaning his name and telling him how much she wants him. He, however, does not, not even a little bit, not at all.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI heard you talking to your flatmate,\u201d says the girl as she runs her palms up and down his bare chest. \u201cDid she complain about us waking her up?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think she stayed up to wait for me to come home.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPoor girl. I think she\u2019s got a crush on you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry chuckles slightly, shaking his head. \u201cShe just worries a lot, which makes me feel guilty, because if it was her coming home late, I don\u2019t think I\u00a0would do the same.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, I still think she likes you.\u201d The girl puts a finger to Harry\u2019s cheek and turns his face to hers, then leans in to kiss him. \u201cCan\u2019t blame her, you\u2019re irresistible.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry furrows his eyebrows at the girl for two seconds. She tries to read his mind, he can tell, but before she can figure out what he actually wants, Harry removes her hand from his face. Without warning, he pushes her down on the bed so he can get on top, and starts kissing his way down from her lips.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>This seems to her that he wants her just as much as she does him, whereas to him, this is nothing more than just goodbye sex. This girl obviously has feelings for Harry, and the last thing he needs right now is to deal with collateral damage.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p>Y/N carefully opens the fridge so as to not make a sound and wake up her boyfriend, whom she assumes must be asleep. She only just got home after a long night out, so after this glass of water, she\u2019s heading straight to bed for sure. Tomorrow is their moving out day, which is really important. She won\u2019t be able to get anything done if she wakes up at noon!</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The voice catches Y/N by surprise. She looks up, a bit taken aback to see Harry standing at the kitchen door, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cA while ago. Did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head and walks over to hug her waist from behind. He loves holding her like this, and he knows she loves being held this way as well.\u00a0</p><p>Harry shuts his eyes and buries his face into the crook of her neck, inhaling her scent deeply, as if he hadn\u2019t seen her in a really long time though it\u2019s only been a couple hours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I missed you,\u201d he whispers against her skin, causing his girlfriend\u2019s head to fall back and her eyes shut tightly. She mumbles her apology for coming home late, and brings her right hand up behind her to stroke his hair.</p><p>\u201cNeed to\u00a0feel you\u2026\u201d He sounds almost desperate, running his hands from her stomach up to her breasts, kneading them, while breathing heavily into her bare shoulder. It\u2019d be a lie if Y/N said she wanted to turn him down and head to bed instead. Though they do have a lot of work to do tomorrow, she needs him just as much.</p><p>She arches her back and moaning his name. Harry\u2019s completely lost his mind. He grabs his girl by the hips then spins her around, and effortlessly lifts her up to sit on the edge of the table, so he\u2019s now standing between her spread legs. Harry thanks God that she\u2019s wearing a dress because he\u2019s got no patience left to take time removing her pants.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s breath gets stuck in her throat when she feels his fingers pushing through her hot entrance. She\u2019s already soaked and Harry loses self-control for the feeling of her squeezing around his digits. He attaches their lips, moaning into the kiss as he starts pumping his fingers, starting slow then gradually building up the pace. Y/N has her hands secured behind his neck while she\u2019s gasping for air, but never breaks eye-contact. Watching her watching<i> him</i> drives Harry insane.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry, I need\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know baby\u2026I know\u2026\u201d He breathes into her mouth and withdraws his fingers, causing Y/N to groan at the loss. In a split second, he somehow manages to push his pants down and suddenly enters her with a sharp thrust of his hips. The burn makes Y/N\u2019s eyes roll back whereas Harry nearly explodes for how tight she feels squeezing around him. So they stay still for a couple seconds to get themselves adjusted, meanwhile they can\u2019t keep their mouths away from each other.</p><p>\u201cWant me to go slow?\u201d He whispers against her lips, to which she answers by shaking her head quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026<i>fast</i>\u2026let me have you\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou already do&hellip;\u201d He chuckles and starts bucking his hips into hers, the words <i>\u201cI love you\u201d</i> start pouring out non-stop from his lips as if he hadn\u2019t told her enough already. But he still needs her to know. If he could, he would remind her every second of the day that he loves her. He loves her to the point it physically hurts thinking about her walking away from him. He would do anything for her.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take too long until both of them start chasing after their own orgasms together. Y/N is left seeing stars. She clings onto Harry as they ride through their the peak of their pleasure and it has to take her a moment to gain back her sight. Everything\u2019s been blurry from the moment she felt them both getting so close.\u00a0</p><p>When Y/N opens her eyes again, she almost freaks out seeing his tear-filled eyes staring back at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you alright?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Harry tells her between soft chuckles as he feels himself slipping out, already making a mess on her thighs and her dress. \u201cCan\u2019t believe I\u2019d be the one to cry after sex.\u201d</p><p>His comment makes Y/N laugh as she leans in to kiss his lips again, at the same time wiping the tears from the corners of his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d She murmurs and the sound of her voice calms him down again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just love you so much\u2026\u201d He admits. His eyes fall to the side. \u201cI had a nightmare before you got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were leaving me. You said we didn\u2019t spend enough time together and there was nothing I could do to fix us.\u201d Harry puckers up his forehead as he recalls the unpleasant feelings after waking up from that bad dream. \u201cI know I\u2019ve told you that I couldn\u2019t wait to start our new life&hellip;but in reality I\u2019m also very scared&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean&hellip;We\u2019re not students anymore\u2026You\u2019ve got your new job and I\u2019m already so busy with mine. We won\u2019t spend as much time with each other anymore\u2026What if everything changes when we move into our new place? I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH, look at me,\u201d Y/N speaks softly and Harry looks at her as he\u2019s told.\u00a0</p><p>She gives him a reassuring smile then starts stroking his cheeks with her thumbs. It turns out it\u2019s not just her, them moving out affects him as well.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much together. We were in different countries for three months and we\u2019re still here, aren\u2019t we? Do you really think we\u2019re going to break up because we\u2019re busy people now?\u201d</p><p>Though Harry says nothing, but he\u2019s beaming again. That\u2019s all she needs to see right now.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the last chapter. We\u2019re gonna be so happy when we move into our new flat. Nothing has to change.\u201d She rolls her eyes, laughing softly. \u201cYou\u2019re still the only man that I love, and we\u2019re still <i>us.</i>\u201d</p><p>Harry holds her hands on his cheeks then nods once. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love me no matter what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve loved you since you were an oblivious asshole. How hard can it be to love you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got a good point.\u201d<br/></p><p>She smiles at her boyfriend and pulls him into a hug, feeling his arms tightened around her waist.\u00a0Maybe now, she is finally ready to say her goodbye to this place to begin anew. This is her home, <i>yes</i>, but home is not a place, it\u2019s a person. So as long as she has him, she knows they\u2019re gonna be just fine.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N quickly walks in front of Harry and stands between him and the door to prevent him from carrying his boxes into this room behind her.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cBringing my stuff to <b>my</b> room?\u201d He barely looks at her, and she\u2019s had enough with his arrogant attitude. If they\u2019re going to spend the rest of their university years under the same roof, she\u2019s not going to let him act all superior and treat her terribly.</i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>Your</b> room?! We haven\u2019t discussed who\u2019s getting this room yet!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cLet me make this simpler for us and say this is my room.\u201d He smiles and takes a step to the left so as to get through her, yet she\u2019s quick to block his path with her arms opened wide.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThis is not your room!\u201d She asserts. \u201cI walked in there first!\u201d</i></p><p><i>She doesn\u2019t actually need this room, she can just take the other one and spare herself an argument. It\u2019s not about this one being bigger than the other, it\u2019s about winning, and she cannot stand him thinking he can just get everything that he wants.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on, the other one has its own bathroom inside!\u201d Harry fights back, not letting this go easily. \u201cYou\u2019ll get all the privacy you need, you can just live in there if you want to!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to! I want this room!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure? Because if you forget to bring your clothes to the shower, you\u2019re gonna have to walk out naked and I\u2019m gonna see more than I anticipate.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d She lifts her jaw and puts both hands on her hips. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to see anyway.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry raises an eyebrow and sends his flatmate a cheeky smirk as he replies, \u201cI\u2019m gonna need proof to believe that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re just sick!\u201d She rolls her eyes in reaction to his words then crosses her arms firmly. \u201cRock, paper, scissors?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSeriously, are you twelve?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, got any better suggestion? It\u2019s the only way we can solve this problem,\u201d she tells him with a straight face. Harry sighs, still he assumes she\u2019s got a point. As stubborn as she is, he\u2019s sure she won\u2019t let this go easily. He doesn\u2019t actually want the bigger room that much, he just doesn\u2019t want her to get it. And he has to make sure she won\u2019t.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine. \u2018Rock, paper, scissors\u2019 as you wish.\u201d He nods with confidence, like somehow he knows he\u2019s going to win.</i></p><p><i>And\u2026</i></p><p><i>He wins.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy scissors cut the shit out of your paper.\u201d He chuckles at the look on her face as she cannot believe she\u2019s been defeated. \u201cNow can you move so I can bring my stuff into <b>my</b> room?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine! Take the room!\u201d She says bitterly when he walks past her with a smug on his face. \u201cI hope you sleep well at night knowing you\u2019re an asshole that will probably end up alone for the rest of his life for being such an asshole.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry opens the door, stops and turns around to look at the girl in amusement. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking. I\u2019m sure by the time you receive my wedding invitation you\u2019re still living alone with a cat.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She snorts, eyes widened at him. \u201cWell, whoever ends up marrying you is an idiot.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay you know what? You just got yourself uninvited to my wedding\u2026if it ever happens.\u201d He gives her a shrug and closes the door between them when he enters his new room.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N clenches her fists and takes a deep breath. The little voice inside her head tells her to calm down. First day moving in and she already wants to leave, but from now until graduation, she\u2019s gonna have to see his stupid face every single day.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>Y/N lifts the weight off her feet and falls down on their newly made bed, sighing contently for how comfy it feels. She loves it. She loves their new bedroom, she loves their new flat.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be late for work everyday just to stay in this incredibly soft bed, but it\u2019ll all be worth it!\u201d Y/N laughs, closing her eyes as she feels herself sinking into the warm bed covers.\u00a0</p><p>Harry, who\u2019s been watching his girl with a grin this whole time, finally decides to get in with her. He falls down\u00a0by her side, on his back and reaches out to hold her hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made it,\u201d she whispers and lies on her side to run her fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs excited as I am to start our new life here,\u201d replies Harry. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to fuck you on our new bed.\u201d</p><p>Y/N giggles and opens her mouth to say something, but all of a sudden, she\u2019s interrupted by the female voice at their bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cYes please, we\u2019d love a free show.\u201d</p><p>The couple shoot their heads to the entrance and quickly sit up when they see Niall and Layla staring at them.</p><p>\u201cWhile you horny teenagers were shamelessly planning on having sex in here, my boyfriend and I were cleaning <i>your</i> kitchen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry, L. I\u2019m coming!\u201d Y/N laughs as she stands up from the bed and follows Layla out of the room, leaving Niall behind with Harry. Both of them exchange smiles now that the girls are gone.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Niall begins, and judging from the look on his face, Harry can already tell what he\u2019s going to ask next.\u00a0\u201cWhen are you gonna give<i> it</i> to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure yet,\u201d answers Harry as he rises from the bed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for the right moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not right after we\u2019ve just moved into our new place?\u201d Harry\u00a0laughs, and so does Niall. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until she\u2019s settled with her new job. If I\u2019m gonna do this, I need time to\u00a0do this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m very proud of you, H.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The two men almost scream when they hear Layla\u2019s voice. Niall quickly turn around and receive a death glare from his\u00a0angry girlfriend. Harry\u2019s heart stops for a second thinking she\u2019s heard more than she should have.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not what?\u201d Niall swallows nervously, causing Layla to roll her eyes upward.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not proud of either of you! You\u2019re gonna let Y/N and I clean the entire kitchen?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, no, god no!\u201d Harry cries out, however, he feels very relieved.\u00a0\u201cNiall, you go first, I need to\u00a0pee.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell pee fast!\u201d Layla tells him then storms away, Niall quickly follows so as not to make her angrier.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>When they\u2019re finally out of sight, Harry shoves his hand into his trousers pocket and pulls out a small box which he\u2019s been keeping a secret from Y/N for a week now. He puts it away in the bottom drawer in their closet, at the very back, underneath his newly folded clothes, where he\u2019s sure she will never find.\u00a0</p><p>He needs to\u00a0hide it from her, just for now, until they\u2019re both ready.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>It\u2019s one of those nights when Harry comes home really late (or early because it was nearly two in the morning). Y/N wakes up to the sound of him banging on the front door and calling out her name. By the tone of his voice, she knows he is very wasted, but to be honest, this is nothing. The worst time was when he refused to believe she was his flatmate and kept asking her to leave or else he\u2019d call the police. At least this time he still remembers her name.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you know what time it is?!\u201d She stands in front of the door and grumbles to him instead of letting him in like she did the last few times.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N, open the door\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i></i><i>\u201cWhere\u2019s your key?\u201d She inquires. Of course she wants to just open the door for him so she can head back to bed, yet if she keeps letting him get away with this, he won\u2019t ever learn.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI lost it,\u201d he admits. Drunk Harry is very honest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s your third key Harry!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Harry stresses out the final sound then takes a really long pause, probably struggling to put the words into a sentence. \u201c\u2026I think\u2026it fell out\u2026when I was with\u2026this girl\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>Of course. <i>She should\u2019ve known.</i></p><p><i>Y/N furrows her eyebrows then rests her forehead against the door, squeezing her eyes shut. There\u2019s always \u201cthis girl\u201d. Having known him for so long, she shouldn\u2019t still feel disappointed. The problem is not him, he\u2019s still the same him. It\u2019s her who\u2019s changed.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She likes him.</i></p><p><i>So if it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s hers, for liking him even though she knows too well she won\u2019t ever be \u201cthis girl\u201d in his stories. However, right now she feels like he\u2019s the one to blame.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou may want to call that girl of yours, because I\u2019m not letting you in tonight,\u201d Y/N finally speaks with a lump in her throat, because she doesn\u2019t mean a single word she just said to him. \u201cGo crash at her place or just sleep outside, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N, please\u2026\u201d He knocks on the door three times rapidly. \u201cMy tummy hurts, my head hurts.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou should\u2019ve thought about that before deciding to come back at two in the morning and ruin my sleep!\u201d Y/N firmly declares, though she knows this has nothing to do with him ruining her sleep. Had he not say he wouldn\u2019t come back tonight, she would\u2019ve stayed up waiting for him anyway. It\u2019s just her being mad at him for hurting her feelings, even if it\u2019s unintentionally.</i></p><p><i>She goes ahead and ignores Harry\u2019s constant apologies and pleading to return to her bedroom, too angry to feel sorry for him\u2026for now at least.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s not until she\u2019s climbed back into bed, buries herself under the warm covers, and drowns in the sound of utter silence, does she start to feel guilty for what she\u2019s done. </i><i>Y/N cannot fall back into sleep. </i><i>She begins to think about how it\u2019s cold outside and her flatmate is left in the hallway without these soft and comfy bed covers to keep him warm.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Harry has stopped knocking or calling her name. He did say his head and tummy were hurting, and he\u2019s also drunk. After spending the night outside he\u2019ll be sick for sure. </i><i>Y/N bites her lip as she puckers up her forehead. She doesn\u2019t want Harry to be sick! It\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s making him pay for the crime he doesn\u2019t even knows he committed\u2026</i></p><p><i>That final thought sends Y/N out of bed. She quickly heads out to open the door and she hopes he hasn\u2019t left yet.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019s still in the hallway. </i>Thank God! <i>Y/N thinks to herself as she releases a sigh of relief and warches towards her flatmate who\u2019s standing in front of the lift, just staring at the closed door.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry, what are you doing?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWaiting for the door to open,\u201d he grumbles in annoyance. His eyes are squinty and his brows are knitted together. She can\u2019t help but giggle at how funny he looks. \u201cWhy\u2019s it taking soooo long?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry you haven\u2019t pressed the button.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOhhhhhh, thanks,\u201d he replies then reaches out to press it but she takes his hand immediately.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside.\u201d She tries to lead him back to their flat but he stands still and refuses to come along.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not going! You told me to leave!\u201d He pouts and withdraws his hand from hers, crossing his arms in front of his chest like an angry little boy.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhose fault was that?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou! You were\u2026very mean, Y/N\u2026\u201d he says drunkenly. Right now, Y/N is trying her best not laugh her butt off. She can just make fun of him in the morning, now she needs to get him inside before one of their neighbors start complaining.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this right now. Come with me!\u201d She doesn\u2019t need his approval to grab his wrist and pulls him with her back to their flat. He starts talking nonsense again and she\u2019s too exhausted to ask him what he means. When they\u2019ve finally got into their flat, she locks the door and turns to see Harry still standing there staring at her.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d She asks, unable to interpret the look on his face.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N don\u2019t be mad at me,\u201d he says while fighting to keep his tired eyes open. \u201cI\u2026didn\u2019t\u2026didn\u2019t mean to lose the key\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re forgiven. Go to bed.\u201d She holds his elbow to spin him around, pushing him to his bedroom. He walks with her a few steps then quickly stops and turns to face her again.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI was sad when you locked me out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She swallows hard. The look on his face makes her heart stop for a second.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2026You also made me sad\u2026\u201d she blurts out before she can stop herself. It freaks her out a little bit, but all he does is furrow his eyebrows at her. Y/N quickly realizes he\u2019s probably too drunk to even remember this tomorrow morning. He doesn\u2019t bother to ask her to explain what she just told him, he wasn\u2019t sober enough to get it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026I\u2019m happy now that you\u2019re here!\u201d He gives her a silly smile and intends to pull her in for a hug but he trips and nearly fall onto the floor. Lucky for him, she\u2019s there to catch him just in time.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, bed now.\u201d She rolls her eyes, one arm around his waist while his around her shoulders. She walks him to his room as he starts singing really off-tune. Harry keeps forgetting the words, so he just goes la-la-la for the rest of the song.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N watches Harry fall onto his bed with a satisfied smile on his face, sighing to herself now that she\u2019s finally free to go.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan you stroke my hair?\u201d He asks, his eyes are still closed.</i></p><p><i>Y/N stands by the side of his bed and crosses her arms as she raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPleeeeeeease?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t let you sleep on the floor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFineeeeeeeeee!\u201d He whines then turns to the side, facing his back to her.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N doesn\u2019t leave just yet, she stays for a little while, just standing there watching him falling asleep.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf it was me who came home drunk, would you take care of me too?\u201d She quietly inquires, not him, but herself. Of course there\u2019s no answer, because she doesn\u2019t know if there\u2019s even a place for her in his heart.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>\u201cHarry! Your eyes are so greeeeeeeen! You\u2019re the most beautiful person in the whole wide world!\u201d</i> Y/N sings at the top of her lungs which makes Harry laugh though they receive a few judging stares from the people they pass by on the street.</p><p>\u201cDid you just make up a song for me baby?\u201d He asks, tightening his grip on her waist so as to keep her from tumbling down on her wobbling feet. She\u2019s a fun drunk he\u2019s gotta admit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you a song one day!\u201d Y/N declares to the world as she raises one finger in the air. \u201cI\u2019ll write you a song about how much I loveeeeee you! I love you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019m very flattered,\u201d he tells her and sighs in relief when they finally arrive at their building.\u00a0</p><p>When the young couple enter the lobby, their middle-aged doorman is in the middle of the conversation with an old lady, who\u2019s also living in this building apparently.</p><p>\u201cAlbert, I\u2019m serious! I saw Felicia bring home a new dog - the fifth one this month!\u201d Says the woman. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna get into so much trouble if her landlord finds out!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGive the poor woman a break, would you?\u201d Replies Albert. \u201cThe only reason she owns so many dogs is to fill up her loneliness when her husband left her for a young girl. I\u2019m telling you, Greta, everyone in this building has their own story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening!\u201d Y/N happily shouts, causing the doorman and the old woman to both stare at her and Harry. They seem quite confused, but amused at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYour wife drank a bit too much I see,\u201d says Greta to Harry, who slightly shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my apologies, I saw the ring so I thought you two were married.\u201d</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t make further comments about the promise ring on Y/N\u2019s finger or the possibility of there soon to be a new one. He simply smiles and says he\u2019s very sorry for how loud Y/N is.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Y/N finally speaks up with her eyes still closed. \u201cTake off my clothes. They\u2019re itchy.\u201d</p><p>Her request makes Albert and Greta laugh. Harry, on the other hand, has to grab her hand before she can unbutton her own shirt and flash the two strangers here.</p><p>\u201cNot here, baby. Keep your clothes on,\u201d he whispers, making her pout, but she listens to him and drops her hands back to her sides.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he softly says to her before turning\u00a0back to give the door man and the woman an apologetic smile. \u201cI should get her back to our flat now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Albert stops them before they can turn away. \u201cAre you two the couple in flat 102?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The man gives Harry two spare keys for the flat and Harry assumes it\u2019s a mistake, because they\u2019ve received their spare keys already. Before he gets a chance to speak, however, Albert quickly adds in,\u00a0\u201cyour girlfriend paid for two extras because she said you tend to lose your keys a lot.\u201d</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes as he looks at his girlfriend, who somehow has fallen asleep with her head on his shoulder, and probably won\u2019t have any memory of this conversation when she wakes up.</p><p>\u201cYou know me too well, don\u2019t you?\u201d He tells her before taking the keys and thanking the doorman one more time before leaving. \u201cHave a great evening, sir, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your girl too, young man!\u201d Greta shouts out and waves at the young couple as they walk away towards the lift. After that\u00a0she immediately turns to her old friend Albert.\u00a0\u201cI like those two kids.\u00a0What do you think their story is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell&hellip;\u201d Albert lets out a happy sigh as he watches Harry taking Y/N into the lift and kissing her hair \u201c&hellip;I hope we\u2019ll get to find out.\u201d</p>",

Throwing something in this flat away makes her heart sting, because everything here holds a memory of her and Harry and she\u2019s not ready to let go just yet, even though they\u2019re moving out <i>tomorrow</i>.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is really happening,\u201d Y/N mumbles when she pulls out a box from under Harry\u2019s bed and\u00a0opens it. Harry soon joins her on the floor and helps her unbox another one.</p><p>\u201cLove, you said the exact same thing last week at our graduation,\u201d he tells her, chuckling a little bit at her facial expression.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me! Everything is just moving too fast!\u201d She replies with a sigh.\u00a0</p><p>It feels as if they\u2019d only met yesterday, and their time in university had already passed in just a blink of an eye. Harry may not care a lot about leaving this place, in fact he seems like he\u2019s actually happy now that they\u2019re moving into a bigger flat. Y/N, on the other hand, struggles to let go of the past and begins anew.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N questions when she catches Harry smirking at her.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about our new life together, s\u2019all.\u201d His answer makes her smile, but then he furrows his eyebrows and pulls a very serious face which gets her confused for a second. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s still not too late for you to back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, you said the exact same thing when we first met!\u201d Her almost accurate imitation of his voice cracks him up.</p><p>\u201cThat impression was spot on,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>Y/N responses to Harry with a proud smile on her face, then she resumes checking what\u2019s inside the box between her legs. This one is full of her boyfriend\u2019s old clothes, most of these Harry hasn\u2019t touched in years. She goes through it real quick, then a piece of clothing really catches her eyes. She excitedly pulls out a red sweater with a huge Santa Claus head printed on the front and the words \u2018<i>Merry Christmas\u2019</i>\u00a0on the back. It\u2019s pretty extra, she must admit, but that was why she bought it in the first place.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI got you this on our first Christmas here!\u201d She shows it to him with a wide smile on her face whereas he groans and covers his with both hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh God, that sweater!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s cute! How come I\u2019ve never seen you wear it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s way too\u2026<i>much,</i> Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Y/N puckers up her forehead and shoves the sweater back inside the box, pouting as she tells him, \u201cfine! If you hate my Christmas gift so much I\u2019ll throw it away then!\u201d</p><p>Hearing her say that and seeing her facial expression amuses Harry, he thinks she looks cute when she\u2019s pretending to be mad. So before she can close the box, he pulls it away from her and takes out the sweater himself. Without saying a word, Harry puts it on, smiling as he does a ridiculous pose in the awfully uncomfortable sweater.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N cannot keep a straight face anymore. She tosses her head back and laughs, then finally agrees that he does look silly in it.</p><p>The two continues going through the rest of Harry\u2019s closet. They need to get the work in here done so as to move to Y/N\u2019s room, and take care of the mess over there.\u00a0</p><p>While Y/N is folding the old t-shirts that don\u2019t fit Harry anymore and putting them in another box, which she\u2019s labeled <i>\u201cgiveaway\u201d</i>, Harry cannot take his eyes off her. He likes to watch his girlfriend when she\u2019s not looking, to secretly admire how adorable she is every time she does something unintentionally. Like the way she purses her lips, the way she scrunches her nose, how she furrows her eyebrows, the smile on her face when she thinks he\u2019s not paying attention.\u00a0</p><p>He just loves watching her do things, that\u2019s all.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out tonight and celebrate us moving out!\u201d He suddenly breaks the comfortable silence between the two of them, causing Y/N to look up from the shirt in her hands.</p><p>\u201cUgh\u2026I wish I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got other plans for tonight?\u201d He asks, sounding a bit disappointed because he thought they\u2019d get to spend their last night in this flat together.</p><p>\u201cMy boss asked me to go see a client with him. I couldn\u2019t say no, I\u2019ve only been working there for a week now, gotta stay relevant, right?\u201d she tells him, giggling a little bit to lighten up the mood, but Harry only replies with a simple nod.\u00a0</p><p>He seems really let down and she can\u2019t blame him for that. So Y/N gets up on all fours then crawls to Harry\u2019s side, hugging him tightly and laying her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow night?\u201d She suggests, glancing up to watch his reaction. \u201cIf we cannot celebrate us moving out, we can celebrate us moving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally says and turns his head to face her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot mad at me anymore?\u201d she questions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re cute.\u201d He exhales a smile before leaning in and pecking her lips. How can he ever get mad at her to begin with?</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>Harry rises up from his bed, the naked brunette lying beside him begs him to stay, but he just gives her a quick kiss, and promises to make it up to her once he returns.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s around 2AM now, or so, he doesn\u2019t really pay attention when he glances at the clock on the kitchen wall. He only intends to get a glass of water and heads back for another round with that pretty girl. He doesn\u2019t expect his flatmate Y/N to still be awake at this hour, because why would she?</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The voice catches Harry by surprise. He looks up, a bit taken aback to see Y/N walk through the kitchen door. She stops in front of him with her hands laying flat on the kitchen table. He assumes the noises from his bedroom earlier woke her up, but she looks too happy for someone whose sleep was interrupted.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d She asks.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAn hour ago,\u201d he replies shortly. It takes her a moment, but somehow she figures it out on her own.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs there someone in your room?\u201d The question comes with a nervous laugh. Harry has no idea how she knows it, but he\u2019s not going to lie to her now.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah.\u201d He admits without hesitation, but then instantly regrets it once he sees her smile fade away.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019s never cared about what she thinks about his complicated \u201crelationships\u201d, why does he care now? Why does he feel guilty for telling her this? Why does she look so sad? Does she care who he\u2019s with? Those questions are spinning around Harry\u2019s head as he waits for her to say something else. However\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh\u2026,\u201d is her only reply.</i></p><p><i>Harry puts the glass of water down and stares at her with his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if we woke you up, promise we won\u2019t be too loud later.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He honestly doesn\u2019t know why he said that. Maybe he\u2019s just trying to prove that he doesn\u2019t care about how she feels (if she does feel anything about this), but the problem is, he <b>does</b> care about how she feels. He is worried and wants to know why she\u2019s up so late, and whether she\u2019s been waiting for him to come home or not. His pride doesn\u2019t allow him to ask her.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m going back to bed now,\u201d she tells him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d he says when she turns away, However, she doesn\u2019t respond, and Harry feels bad, really bad.</i></p><p><i>He walks back to his room and the naked brunette sits up as soon as she sees him. He feels her chest pressed against his back when he takes a seat on the edge of the bed. Her hot lips leave wet kisses from behind his ear down to his shoulder blade while she\u2019s moaning his name and telling him how much she wants him. He, however, does not, not even a little bit, not at all.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI heard you talking to your flatmate,\u201d says the girl as she runs her palms up and down his bare chest. \u201cDid she complain about us waking her up?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think she stayed up to wait for me to come home.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPoor girl. I think she\u2019s got a crush on you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry chuckles slightly, shaking his head. \u201cShe just worries a lot, which makes me feel guilty, because if it was her coming home late, I don\u2019t think I\u00a0would do the same.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, I still think she likes you.\u201d The girl puts a finger to Harry\u2019s cheek and turns his face to hers, then leans in to kiss him. \u201cCan\u2019t blame her, you\u2019re irresistible.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry furrows his eyebrows at the girl for two seconds. She tries to read his mind, he can tell, but before she can figure out what he actually wants, Harry removes her hand from his face. Without warning, he pushes her down on the bed so he can get on top, and starts kissing his way down from her lips.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>This seems to her that he wants her just as much as she does him, whereas to him, this is nothing more than just goodbye sex. This girl obviously has feelings for Harry, and the last thing he needs right now is to deal with collateral damage.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p>Y/N carefully opens the fridge so as to not make a sound and wake up her boyfriend, whom she assumes must be asleep. She only just got home after a long night out, so after this glass of water, she\u2019s heading straight to bed for sure. Tomorrow is their moving out day, which is really important. She won\u2019t be able to get anything done if she wakes up at noon!</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The voice catches Y/N by surprise. She looks up, a bit taken aback to see Harry standing at the kitchen door, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cA while ago. Did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head and walks over to hug her waist from behind. He loves holding her like this, and he knows she loves being held this way as well.\u00a0</p><p>Harry shuts his eyes and buries his face into the crook of her neck, inhaling her scent deeply, as if he hadn\u2019t seen her in a really long time though it\u2019s only been a couple hours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I missed you,\u201d he whispers against her skin, causing his girlfriend\u2019s head to fall back and her eyes shut tightly. She mumbles her apology for coming home late, and brings her right hand up behind her to stroke his hair.</p><p>\u201cNeed to\u00a0feel you\u2026\u201d He sounds almost desperate, running his hands from her stomach up to her breasts, kneading them, while breathing heavily into her bare shoulder. It\u2019d be a lie if Y/N said she wanted to turn him down and head to bed instead. Though they do have a lot of work to do tomorrow, she needs him just as much.</p><p>She arches her back and moaning his name. Harry\u2019s completely lost his mind. He grabs his girl by the hips then spins her around, and effortlessly lifts her up to sit on the edge of the table, so he\u2019s now standing between her spread legs. Harry thanks God that she\u2019s wearing a dress because he\u2019s got no patience left to take time removing her pants.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s breath gets stuck in her throat when she feels his fingers pushing through her hot entrance. She\u2019s already soaked and Harry loses self-control for the feeling of her squeezing around his digits. He attaches their lips, moaning into the kiss as he starts pumping his fingers, starting slow then gradually building up the pace. Y/N has her hands secured behind his neck while she\u2019s gasping for air, but never breaks eye-contact. Watching her watching<i> him</i> drives Harry insane.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry, I need\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know baby\u2026I know\u2026\u201d He breathes into her mouth and withdraws his fingers, causing Y/N to groan at the loss. In a split second, he somehow manages to push his pants down and suddenly enters her with a sharp thrust of his hips. The burn makes Y/N\u2019s eyes roll back whereas Harry nearly explodes for how tight she feels squeezing around him. So they stay still for a couple seconds to get themselves adjusted, meanwhile they can\u2019t keep their mouths away from each other.</p><p>\u201cWant me to go slow?\u201d He whispers against her lips, to which she answers by shaking her head quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026<i>fast</i>\u2026let me have you\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou already do\u2026\u201d He chuckles and starts bucking his hips into hers, the words <i>\u201cI love you\u201d</i> start pouring out non-stop from his lips as if he hadn\u2019t told her enough already. But he still needs her to know. If he could, he would remind her every second of the day that he loves her. He loves her to the point it physically hurts thinking about her walking away from him. He would do anything for her.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take too long until both of them start chasing after their own orgasms together. Y/N is left seeing stars. She clings onto Harry as they ride through their the peak of their pleasure and it has to take her a moment to gain back her sight. Everything\u2019s been blurry from the moment she felt them both getting so close.\u00a0</p><p>When Y/N opens her eyes again, she almost freaks out seeing his tear-filled eyes staring back at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you alright?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Harry tells her between soft chuckles as he feels himself slipping out, already making a mess on her thighs and her dress. \u201cCan\u2019t believe I\u2019d be the one to cry after sex.\u201d</p><p>His comment makes Y/N laugh as she leans in to kiss his lips again, at the same time wiping the tears from the corners of his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d She murmurs and the sound of her voice calms him down again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just love you so much\u2026\u201d He admits. His eyes fall to the side. \u201cI had a nightmare before you got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were leaving me. You said we didn\u2019t spend enough time together and there was nothing I could do to fix us.\u201d Harry puckers up his forehead as he recalls the unpleasant feelings after waking up from that bad dream. \u201cI know I\u2019ve told you that I couldn\u2019t wait to start our new life\u2026but in reality I\u2019m also very scared\u2026\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026We\u2019re not students anymore\u2026You\u2019ve got your new job and I\u2019m already so busy with mine. We won\u2019t spend as much time with each other anymore\u2026What if everything changes when we move into our new place? I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH, look at me,\u201d Y/N speaks softly and Harry looks at her as he\u2019s told.\u00a0</p><p>She gives him a reassuring smile then starts stroking his cheeks with her thumbs. It turns out it\u2019s not just her, them moving out affects him as well.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much together. We were in different countries for three months and we\u2019re still here, aren\u2019t we? Do you really think we\u2019re going to break up because we\u2019re busy people now?\u201d</p><p>Though Harry says nothing, but he\u2019s beaming again. That\u2019s all she needs to see right now.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the last chapter. We\u2019re gonna be so happy when we move into our new flat. Nothing has to change.\u201d She rolls her eyes, laughing softly. \u201cYou\u2019re still the only man that I love, and we\u2019re still <i>us.</i>\u201d</p><p>Harry holds her hands on his cheeks then nods once. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love me no matter what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve loved you since you were an oblivious asshole. How hard can it be to love you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got a good point.\u201d<br></p><p>She smiles at her boyfriend and pulls him into a hug, feeling his arms tightened around her waist.\u00a0Maybe now, she is finally ready to say her goodbye to this place to begin anew. This is her home, <i>yes</i>, but home is not a place, it\u2019s a person. So as long as she has him, she knows they\u2019re gonna be just fine.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N quickly walks in front of Harry and stands between him and the door to prevent him from carrying his boxes into this room behind her.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cBringing my stuff to <b>my</b> room?\u201d He barely looks at her, and she\u2019s had enough with his arrogant attitude. If they\u2019re going to spend the rest of their university years under the same roof, she\u2019s not going to let him act all superior and treat her terribly.</i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>Your</b> room?! We haven\u2019t discussed who\u2019s getting this room yet!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cLet me make this simpler for us and say this is my room.\u201d He smiles and takes a step to the left so as to get through her, yet she\u2019s quick to block his path with her arms opened wide.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThis is not your room!\u201d She asserts. \u201cI walked in there first!\u201d</i></p><p><i>She doesn\u2019t actually need this room, she can just take the other one and spare herself an argument. It\u2019s not about this one being bigger than the other, it\u2019s about winning, and she cannot stand him thinking he can just get everything that he wants.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on, the other one has its own bathroom inside!\u201d Harry fights back, not letting this go easily. \u201cYou\u2019ll get all the privacy you need, you can just live in there if you want to!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to! I want this room!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure? Because if you forget to bring your clothes to the shower, you\u2019re gonna have to walk out naked and I\u2019m gonna see more than I anticipate.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d She lifts her jaw and puts both hands on her hips. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to see anyway.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry raises an eyebrow and sends his flatmate a cheeky smirk as he replies, \u201cI\u2019m gonna need proof to believe that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re just sick!\u201d She rolls her eyes in reaction to his words then crosses her arms firmly. \u201cRock, paper, scissors?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSeriously, are you twelve?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, got any better suggestion? It\u2019s the only way we can solve this problem,\u201d she tells him with a straight face. Harry sighs, still he assumes she\u2019s got a point. As stubborn as she is, he\u2019s sure she won\u2019t let this go easily. He doesn\u2019t actually want the bigger room that much, he just doesn\u2019t want her to get it. And he has to make sure she won\u2019t.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine. \u2018Rock, paper, scissors\u2019 as you wish.\u201d He nods with confidence, like somehow he knows he\u2019s going to win.</i></p><p><i>And\u2026</i></p><p><i>He wins.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy scissors cut the shit out of your paper.\u201d He chuckles at the look on her face as she cannot believe she\u2019s been defeated. \u201cNow can you move so I can bring my stuff into <b>my</b> room?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine! Take the room!\u201d She says bitterly when he walks past her with a smug on his face. \u201cI hope you sleep well at night knowing you\u2019re an asshole that will probably end up alone for the rest of his life for being such an asshole.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry opens the door, stops and turns around to look at the girl in amusement. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking. I\u2019m sure by the time you receive my wedding invitation you\u2019re still living alone with a cat.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She snorts, eyes widened at him. \u201cWell, whoever ends up marrying you is an idiot.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay you know what? You just got yourself uninvited to my wedding\u2026if it ever happens.\u201d He gives her a shrug and closes the door between them when he enters his new room.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N clenches her fists and takes a deep breath. The little voice inside her head tells her to calm down. First day moving in and she already wants to leave, but from now until graduation, she\u2019s gonna have to see his stupid face every single day.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>Y/N lifts the weight off her feet and falls down on their newly made bed, sighing contently for how comfy it feels. She loves it. She loves their new bedroom, she loves their new flat.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be late for work everyday just to stay in this incredibly soft bed, but it\u2019ll all be worth it!\u201d Y/N laughs, closing her eyes as she feels herself sinking into the warm bed covers.\u00a0</p><p>Harry, who\u2019s been watching his girl with a grin this whole time, finally decides to get in with her. He falls down\u00a0by her side, on his back and reaches out to hold her hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made it,\u201d she whispers and lies on her side to run her fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs excited as I am to start our new life here,\u201d replies Harry. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to fuck you on our new bed.\u201d</p><p>Y/N giggles and opens her mouth to say something, but all of a sudden, she\u2019s interrupted by the female voice at their bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cYes please, we\u2019d love a free show.\u201d</p><p>The couple shoot their heads to the entrance and quickly sit up when they see Niall and Layla staring at them.</p><p>\u201cWhile you horny teenagers were shamelessly planning on having sex in here, my boyfriend and I were cleaning <i>your</i> kitchen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, L. I\u2019m coming!\u201d Y/N laughs as she stands up from the bed and follows Layla out of the room, leaving Niall behind with Harry. Both of them exchange smiles now that the girls are gone.<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Niall begins, and judging from the look on his face, Harry can already tell what he\u2019s going to ask next.\u00a0\u201cWhen are you gonna give<i> it</i> to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure yet,\u201d answers Harry as he rises from the bed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for the right moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not right after we\u2019ve just moved into our new place?\u201d Harry\u00a0laughs, and so does Niall. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until she\u2019s settled with her new job. If I\u2019m gonna do this, I need time to\u00a0do this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m very proud of you, H.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The two men almost scream when they hear Layla\u2019s voice. Niall quickly turn around and receive a death glare from his\u00a0angry girlfriend. Harry\u2019s heart stops for a second thinking she\u2019s heard more than she should have.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not what?\u201d Niall swallows nervously, causing Layla to roll her eyes upward.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not proud of either of you! You\u2019re gonna let Y/N and I clean the entire kitchen?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, no, god no!\u201d Harry cries out, however, he feels very relieved.\u00a0\u201cNiall, you go first, I need to\u00a0pee.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell pee fast!\u201d Layla tells him then storms away, Niall quickly follows so as not to make her angrier.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>When they\u2019re finally out of sight, Harry shoves his hand into his trousers pocket and pulls out a small box which he\u2019s been keeping a secret from Y/N for a week now. He puts it away in the bottom drawer in their closet, at the very back, underneath his newly folded clothes, where he\u2019s sure she will never find.\u00a0</p><p>He needs to\u00a0hide it from her, just for now, until they\u2019re both ready.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>It\u2019s one of those nights when Harry comes home really late (or early because it was nearly two in the morning). Y/N wakes up to the sound of him banging on the front door and calling out her name. By the tone of his voice, she knows he is very wasted, but to be honest, this is nothing. The worst time was when he refused to believe she was his flatmate and kept asking her to leave or else he\u2019d call the police. At least this time he still remembers her name.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you know what time it is?!\u201d She stands in front of the door and grumbles to him instead of letting him in like she did the last few times.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N, open the door\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i></i><i>\u201cWhere\u2019s your key?\u201d She inquires. Of course she wants to just open the door for him so she can head back to bed, yet if she keeps letting him get away with this, he won\u2019t ever learn.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI lost it,\u201d he admits. Drunk Harry is very honest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s your third key Harry!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Harry stresses out the final sound then takes a really long pause, probably struggling to put the words into a sentence. \u201c\u2026I think\u2026it fell out\u2026when I was with\u2026this girl\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>Of course. <i>She should\u2019ve known.</i></p><p><i>Y/N furrows her eyebrows then rests her forehead against the door, squeezing her eyes shut. There\u2019s always \u201cthis girl\u201d. Having known him for so long, she shouldn\u2019t still feel disappointed. The problem is not him, he\u2019s still the same him. It\u2019s her who\u2019s changed.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She likes him.</i></p><p><i>So if it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s hers, for liking him even though she knows too well she won\u2019t ever be \u201cthis girl\u201d in his stories. However, right now she feels like he\u2019s the one to blame.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou may want to call that girl of yours, because I\u2019m not letting you in tonight,\u201d Y/N finally speaks with a lump in her throat, because she doesn\u2019t mean a single word she just said to him. \u201cGo crash at her place or just sleep outside, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N, please\u2026\u201d He knocks on the door three times rapidly. \u201cMy tummy hurts, my head hurts.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou should\u2019ve thought about that before deciding to come back at two in the morning and ruin my sleep!\u201d Y/N firmly declares, though she knows this has nothing to do with him ruining her sleep. Had he not say he wouldn\u2019t come back tonight, she would\u2019ve stayed up waiting for him anyway. It\u2019s just her being mad at him for hurting her feelings, even if it\u2019s unintentionally.</i></p><p><i>She goes ahead and ignores Harry\u2019s constant apologies and pleading to return to her bedroom, too angry to feel sorry for him\u2026for now at least.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s not until she\u2019s climbed back into bed, buries herself under the warm covers, and drowns in the sound of utter silence, does she start to feel guilty for what she\u2019s done. </i><i>Y/N cannot fall back into sleep. </i><i>She begins to think about how it\u2019s cold outside and her flatmate is left in the hallway without these soft and comfy bed covers to keep him warm.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Harry has stopped knocking or calling her name. He did say his head and tummy were hurting, and he\u2019s also drunk. After spending the night outside he\u2019ll be sick for sure. </i><i>Y/N bites her lip as she puckers up her forehead. She doesn\u2019t want Harry to be sick! It\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s making him pay for the crime he doesn\u2019t even knows he committed\u2026</i></p><p><i>That final thought sends Y/N out of bed. She quickly heads out to open the door and she hopes he hasn\u2019t left yet.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019s still in the hallway. </i>Thank God! <i>Y/N thinks to herself as she releases a sigh of relief and warches towards her flatmate who\u2019s standing in front of the lift, just staring at the closed door.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry, what are you doing?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWaiting for the door to open,\u201d he grumbles in annoyance. His eyes are squinty and his brows are knitted together. She can\u2019t help but giggle at how funny he looks. \u201cWhy\u2019s it taking soooo long?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry you haven\u2019t pressed the button.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOhhhhhh, thanks,\u201d he replies then reaches out to press it but she takes his hand immediately.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside.\u201d She tries to lead him back to their flat but he stands still and refuses to come along.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not going! You told me to leave!\u201d He pouts and withdraws his hand from hers, crossing his arms in front of his chest like an angry little boy.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhose fault was that?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou! You were\u2026very mean, Y/N\u2026\u201d he says drunkenly. Right now, Y/N is trying her best not laugh her butt off. She can just make fun of him in the morning, now she needs to get him inside before one of their neighbors start complaining.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this right now. Come with me!\u201d She doesn\u2019t need his approval to grab his wrist and pulls him with her back to their flat. He starts talking nonsense again and she\u2019s too exhausted to ask him what he means. When they\u2019ve finally got into their flat, she locks the door and turns to see Harry still standing there staring at her.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d She asks, unable to interpret the look on his face.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N don\u2019t be mad at me,\u201d he says while fighting to keep his tired eyes open. \u201cI\u2026didn\u2019t\u2026didn\u2019t mean to lose the key\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re forgiven. Go to bed.\u201d She holds his elbow to spin him around, pushing him to his bedroom. He walks with her a few steps then quickly stops and turns to face her again.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI was sad when you locked me out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She swallows hard. The look on his face makes her heart stop for a second.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2026You also made me sad\u2026\u201d she blurts out before she can stop herself. It freaks her out a little bit, but all he does is furrow his eyebrows at her. Y/N quickly realizes he\u2019s probably too drunk to even remember this tomorrow morning. He doesn\u2019t bother to ask her to explain what she just told him, he wasn\u2019t sober enough to get it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026I\u2019m happy now that you\u2019re here!\u201d He gives her a silly smile and intends to pull her in for a hug but he trips and nearly fall onto the floor. Lucky for him, she\u2019s there to catch him just in time.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, bed now.\u201d She rolls her eyes, one arm around his waist while his around her shoulders. She walks him to his room as he starts singing really off-tune. Harry keeps forgetting the words, so he just goes la-la-la for the rest of the song.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N watches Harry fall onto his bed with a satisfied smile on his face, sighing to herself now that she\u2019s finally free to go.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan you stroke my hair?\u201d He asks, his eyes are still closed.</i></p><p><i>Y/N stands by the side of his bed and crosses her arms as she raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPleeeeeeease?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t let you sleep on the floor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFineeeeeeeeee!\u201d He whines then turns to the side, facing his back to her.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N doesn\u2019t leave just yet, she stays for a little while, just standing there watching him falling asleep.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf it was me who came home drunk, would you take care of me too?\u201d She quietly inquires, not him, but herself. Of course there\u2019s no answer, because she doesn\u2019t know if there\u2019s even a place for her in his heart.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>\u201cHarry! Your eyes are so greeeeeeeen! You\u2019re the most beautiful person in the whole wide world!\u201d</i> Y/N sings at the top of her lungs which makes Harry laugh though they receive a few judging stares from the people they pass by on the street.</p><p>\u201cDid you just make up a song for me baby?\u201d He asks, tightening his grip on her waist so as to keep her from tumbling down on her wobbling feet. She\u2019s a fun drunk he\u2019s gotta admit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you a song one day!\u201d Y/N declares to the world as she raises one finger in the air. \u201cI\u2019ll write you a song about how much I loveeeeee you! I love you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019m very flattered,\u201d he tells her and sighs in relief when they finally arrive at their building.\u00a0</p><p>When the young couple enter the lobby, their middle-aged doorman is in the middle of the conversation with an old lady, who\u2019s also living in this building apparently.</p><p>\u201cAlbert, I\u2019m serious! I saw Felicia bring home a new dog - the fifth one this month!\u201d Says the woman. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna get into so much trouble if her landlord finds out!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGive the poor woman a break, would you?\u201d Replies Albert. \u201cThe only reason she owns so many dogs is to fill up her loneliness when her husband left her for a young girl. I\u2019m telling you, Greta, everyone in this building has their own story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening!\u201d Y/N happily shouts, causing the doorman and the old woman to both stare at her and Harry. They seem quite confused, but amused at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYour wife drank a bit too much I see,\u201d says Greta to Harry, who slightly shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my apologies, I saw the ring so I thought you two were married.\u201d</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t make further comments about the promise ring on Y/N\u2019s finger or the possibility of there soon to be a new one. He simply smiles and says he\u2019s very sorry for how loud Y/N is.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Y/N finally speaks up with her eyes still closed. \u201cTake off my clothes. They\u2019re itchy.\u201d</p><p>Her request makes Albert and Greta laugh. Harry, on the other hand, has to grab her hand before she can unbutton her own shirt and flash the two strangers here.</p><p>\u201cNot here, baby. Keep your clothes on,\u201d he whispers, making her pout, but she listens to him and drops her hands back to her sides.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he softly says to her before turning\u00a0back to give the door man and the woman an apologetic smile. \u201cI should get her back to our flat now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Albert stops them before they can turn away. \u201cAre you two the couple in flat 102?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The man gives Harry two spare keys for the flat and Harry assumes it\u2019s a mistake, because they\u2019ve received their spare keys already. Before he gets a chance to speak, however, Albert quickly adds in,\u00a0\u201cyour girlfriend paid for two extras because she said you tend to lose your keys a lot.\u201d</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes as he looks at his girlfriend, who somehow has fallen asleep with her head on his shoulder, and probably won\u2019t have any memory of this conversation when she wakes up.</p><p>\u201cYou know me too well, don\u2019t you?\u201d He tells her before taking the keys and thanking the doorman one more time before leaving. \u201cHave a great evening, sir, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your girl too, young man!\u201d Greta shouts out and waves at the young couple as they walk away towards the lift. After that\u00a0she immediately turns to her old friend Albert.\u00a0\u201cI like those two kids.\u00a0What do you think their story is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Albert lets out a happy sigh as he watches Harry taking Y/N into the lift and kissing her hair \u201c\u2026I hope we\u2019ll get to find out.\u201d</p></p>",

(There are spoilers in this chapters, but are they really spoilers if you don\u2019t know they\u2019re spoilers? ;) )</b></p><p><b>Warning: a bit of smut, a bit of angst, a bunch of fluff.</b></p><p>.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to keep these?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N holds up a box of old books she found in Harry\u2019s closet and\u00a0tries not to kick over the carton boxes, or step on random objects lying on the bedroom floor, as she brings it to him.\u00a0</p><p>He picks up one book, checks the front cover, and the back, then puts it back inside the box.</p><p>\u201cThey can go,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI know an old bookstore that may want to rebuy them,\u201d she tells him, setting the box down and dusting off her hands. \u201cDo you think we\u2019re keeping too many stuff?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re the one who wouldn\u2019t let me throw away most of them, including those Christmas decorations from last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas isn\u2019t a one time thing, H! We can reuse them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well just pack the whole flat with you to our new one.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolls her eyes and sits down on the floor, sighing as she does. Harry\u2019s right, she should probably get rid of what they haven\u2019t touched in over a year. It\u2019s impossible to bring everything to their new place, but she\u2019s trying to keep as many as possible. Throwing something in this flat away makes her heart sting, because everything here holds a memory of her and Harry and she\u2019s not ready to let go just yet, even though they\u2019re moving out <i>tomorrow</i>.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is really happening,\u201d Y/N mumbles when she pulls out a box from under Harry\u2019s bed and\u00a0opens it. Harry soon joins her on the floor and helps her unbox another one.</p><p>\u201cLove, you said the exact same thing last week at our graduation,\u201d he tells her, chuckling a little bit at her facial expression.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me! Everything is just moving too fast!\u201d She replies with a sigh.\u00a0</p><p>It feels as if they\u2019d only met yesterday, and their time in university had already passed in just a blink of an eye. Harry may not care a lot about leaving this place, in fact he seems like he\u2019s actually happy now that they\u2019re moving into a bigger flat. Y/N, on the other hand, struggles to let go of the past and begins anew.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N questions when she catches Harry smirking at her.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about our new life together, s\u2019all.\u201d His answer makes her smile, but then he furrows his eyebrows and pulls a very serious face which gets her confused for a second. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s still not too late for you to back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, you said the exact same thing when we first met!\u201d Her almost accurate imitation of his voice cracks him up.</p><p>\u201cThat impression was spot on,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>Y/N responses to Harry with a proud smile on her face, then she resumes checking what\u2019s inside the box between her legs. This one is full of her boyfriend\u2019s old clothes, most of these Harry hasn\u2019t touched in years. She goes through it real quick, then a piece of clothing really catches her eyes. She excitedly pulls out a red sweater with a huge Santa Claus head printed on the front and the words \u2018<i>Merry Christmas\u2019</i>\u00a0on the back. It\u2019s pretty extra, she must admit, but that was why she bought it in the first place.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI got you this on our first Christmas here!\u201d She shows it to him with a wide smile on her face whereas he groans and covers his with both hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh God, that sweater!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s cute! How come I\u2019ve never seen you wear it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s way too\u2026<i>much,</i> Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Y/N puckers up her forehead and shoves the sweater back inside the box, pouting as she tells him, \u201cfine! If you hate my Christmas gift so much I\u2019ll throw it away then!\u201d</p><p>Hearing her say that and seeing her facial expression amuses Harry, he thinks she looks cute when she\u2019s pretending to be mad. So before she can close the box, he pulls it away from her and takes out the sweater himself. Without saying a word, Harry puts it on, smiling as he does a ridiculous pose in the awfully uncomfortable sweater.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N cannot keep a straight face anymore. She tosses her head back and laughs, then finally agrees that he does look silly in it.</p><p>The two continues going through the rest of Harry\u2019s closet. They need to get the work in here done so as to move to Y/N\u2019s room, and take care of the mess over there.\u00a0</p><p>While Y/N is folding the old t-shirts that don\u2019t fit Harry anymore and putting them in another box, which she\u2019s labeled <i>\u201cgiveaway\u201d</i>, Harry cannot take his eyes off her. He likes to watch his girlfriend when she\u2019s not looking, to secretly admire how adorable she is every time she does something unintentionally. Like the way she purses her lips, the way she scrunches her nose, how she furrows her eyebrows, the smile on her face when she thinks he\u2019s not paying attention.\u00a0</p><p>He just loves watching her do things, that\u2019s all.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out tonight and celebrate us moving out!\u201d He suddenly breaks the comfortable silence between the two of them, causing Y/N to look up from the shirt in her hands.</p><p>\u201cUgh\u2026I wish I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got other plans for tonight?\u201d He asks, sounding a bit disappointed because he thought they\u2019d get to spend their last night in this flat together.</p><p>\u201cMy boss asked me to go see a client with him. I couldn\u2019t say no, I\u2019ve only been working there for a week now, gotta stay relevant, right?\u201d she tells him, giggling a little bit to lighten up the mood, but Harry only replies with a simple nod.\u00a0</p><p>He seems really let down and she can\u2019t blame him for that. So Y/N gets up on all fours then crawls to Harry\u2019s side, hugging him tightly and laying her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow night?\u201d She suggests, glancing up to watch his reaction. \u201cIf we cannot celebrate us moving out, we can celebrate us moving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally says and turns his head to face her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot mad at me anymore?\u201d she questions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re cute.\u201d He exhales a smile before leaning in and pecking her lips. How can he ever get mad at her to begin with?</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>Harry rises up from his bed, the naked brunette lying beside him begs him to stay, but he just gives her a quick kiss, and promises to make it up to her once he returns.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s around 2AM now, or so, he doesn\u2019t really pay attention when he glances at the clock on the kitchen wall. He only intends to get a glass of water and heads back for another round with that pretty girl. He doesn\u2019t expect his flatmate Y/N to still be awake at this hour, because why would she?</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The voice catches Harry by surprise. He looks up, a bit taken aback to see Y/N walk through the kitchen door. She stops in front of him with her hands laying flat on the kitchen table. He assumes the noises from his bedroom earlier woke her up, but she looks too happy for someone whose sleep was interrupted.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d She asks.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAn hour ago,\u201d he replies shortly. It takes her a moment, but somehow she figures it out on her own.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs there someone in your room?\u201d The question comes with a nervous laugh. Harry has no idea how she knows it, but he\u2019s not going to lie to her now.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah.\u201d He admits without hesitation, but then instantly regrets it once he sees her smile fade away.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019s never cared about what she thinks about his complicated \u201crelationships\u201d, why does he care now? Why does he feel guilty for telling her this? Why does she look so sad? Does she care who he\u2019s with? Those questions are spinning around Harry\u2019s head as he waits for her to say something else. However\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh\u2026,\u201d is her only reply.</i></p><p><i>Harry puts the glass of water down and stares at her with his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if we woke you up, promise we won\u2019t be too loud later.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He honestly doesn\u2019t know why he said that. Maybe he\u2019s just trying to prove that he doesn\u2019t care about how she feels (if she does feel anything about this), but the problem is, he <b>does</b> care about how she feels. He is worried and wants to know why she\u2019s up so late, and whether she\u2019s been waiting for him to come home or not. His pride doesn\u2019t allow him to ask her.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m going back to bed now,\u201d she tells him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d he says when she turns away, However, she doesn\u2019t respond, and Harry feels bad, really bad.</i></p><p><i>He walks back to his room and the naked brunette sits up as soon as she sees him. He feels her chest pressed against his back when he takes a seat on the edge of the bed. Her hot lips leave wet kisses from behind his ear down to his shoulder blade while she\u2019s moaning his name and telling him how much she wants him. He, however, does not, not even a little bit, not at all.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI heard you talking to your flatmate,\u201d says the girl as she runs her palms up and down his bare chest. \u201cDid she complain about us waking her up?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think she stayed up to wait for me to come home.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPoor girl. I think she\u2019s got a crush on you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry chuckles slightly, shaking his head. \u201cShe just worries a lot, which makes me feel guilty, because if it was her coming home late, I don\u2019t think I\u00a0would do the same.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, I still think she likes you.\u201d The girl puts a finger to Harry\u2019s cheek and turns his face to hers, then leans in to kiss him. \u201cCan\u2019t blame her, you\u2019re irresistible.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry furrows his eyebrows at the girl for two seconds. She tries to read his mind, he can tell, but before she can figure out what he actually wants, Harry removes her hand from his face. Without warning, he pushes her down on the bed so he can get on top, and starts kissing his way down from her lips.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>This seems to her that he wants her just as much as she does him, whereas to him, this is nothing more than just goodbye sex. This girl obviously has feelings for Harry, and the last thing he needs right now is to deal with collateral damage.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p>Y/N carefully opens the fridge so as to not make a sound and wake up her boyfriend, whom she assumes must be asleep. She only just got home after a long night out, so after this glass of water, she\u2019s heading straight to bed for sure. Tomorrow is their moving out day, which is really important. She won\u2019t be able to get anything done if she wakes up at noon!</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The voice catches Y/N by surprise. She looks up, a bit taken aback to see Harry standing at the kitchen door, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cA while ago. Did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head and walks over to hug her waist from behind. He loves holding her like this, and he knows she loves being held this way as well.\u00a0</p><p>Harry shuts his eyes and buries his face into the crook of her neck, inhaling her scent deeply, as if he hadn\u2019t seen her in a really long time though it\u2019s only been a couple hours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I missed you,\u201d he whispers against her skin, causing his girlfriend\u2019s head to fall back and her eyes shut tightly. She mumbles her apology for coming home late, and brings her right hand up behind her to stroke his hair.</p><p>\u201cNeed to\u00a0feel you\u2026\u201d He sounds almost desperate, running his hands from her stomach up to her breasts, kneading them, while breathing heavily into her bare shoulder. It\u2019d be a lie if Y/N said she wanted to turn him down and head to bed instead. Though they do have a lot of work to do tomorrow, she needs him just as much.</p><p>She arches her back and moaning his name. Harry\u2019s completely lost his mind. He grabs his girl by the hips then spins her around, and effortlessly lifts her up to sit on the edge of the table, so he\u2019s now standing between her spread legs. Harry thanks God that she\u2019s wearing a dress because he\u2019s got no patience left to take time removing her pants.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s breath gets stuck in her throat when she feels his fingers pushing through her hot entrance. She\u2019s already soaked and Harry loses self-control for the feeling of her squeezing around his digits. He attaches their lips, moaning into the kiss as he starts pumping his fingers, starting slow then gradually building up the pace. Y/N has her hands secured behind his neck while she\u2019s gasping for air, but never breaks eye-contact. Watching her watching<i> him</i> drives Harry insane.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry, I need\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know baby\u2026I know\u2026\u201d He breathes into her mouth and withdraws his fingers, causing Y/N to groan at the loss. In a split second, he somehow manages to push his pants down and suddenly enters her with a sharp thrust of his hips. The burn makes Y/N\u2019s eyes roll back whereas Harry nearly explodes for how tight she feels squeezing around him. So they stay still for a couple seconds to get themselves adjusted, meanwhile they can\u2019t keep their mouths away from each other.</p><p>\u201cWant me to go slow?\u201d He whispers against her lips, to which she answers by shaking her head quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026<i>fast</i>\u2026let me have you\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou already do\u2026\u201d He chuckles and starts bucking his hips into hers, the words <i>\u201cI love you\u201d</i> start pouring out non-stop from his lips as if he hadn\u2019t told her enough already. But he still needs her to know. If he could, he would remind her every second of the day that he loves her. He loves her to the point it physically hurts thinking about her walking away from him. He would do anything for her.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take too long until both of them start chasing after their own orgasms together. Y/N is left seeing stars. She clings onto Harry as they ride through their the peak of their pleasure and it has to take her a moment to gain back her sight. Everything\u2019s been blurry from the moment she felt them both getting so close.\u00a0</p><p>When Y/N opens her eyes again, she almost freaks out seeing his tear-filled eyes staring back at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you alright?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Harry tells her between soft chuckles as he feels himself slipping out, already making a mess on her thighs and her dress. \u201cCan\u2019t believe I\u2019d be the one to cry after sex.\u201d</p><p>His comment makes Y/N laugh as she leans in to kiss his lips again, at the same time wiping the tears from the corners of his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d She murmurs and the sound of her voice calms him down again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just love you so much\u2026\u201d He admits. His eyes fall to the side. \u201cI had a nightmare before you got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were leaving me. You said we didn\u2019t spend enough time together and there was nothing I could do to fix us.\u201d Harry puckers up his forehead as he recalls the unpleasant feelings after waking up from that bad dream. \u201cI know I\u2019ve told you that I couldn\u2019t wait to start our new life\u2026but in reality I\u2019m also very scared\u2026\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026We\u2019re not students anymore\u2026You\u2019ve got your new job and I\u2019m already so busy with mine. We won\u2019t spend as much time with each other anymore\u2026What if everything changes when we move into our new place? I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH, look at me,\u201d Y/N speaks softly and Harry looks at her as he\u2019s told.\u00a0</p><p>She gives him a reassuring smile then starts stroking his cheeks with her thumbs. It turns out it\u2019s not just her, them moving out affects him as well.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much together. We were in different countries for three months and we\u2019re still here, aren\u2019t we? Do you really think we\u2019re going to break up because we\u2019re busy people now?\u201d</p><p>Though Harry says nothing, but he\u2019s beaming again. That\u2019s all she needs to see right now.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the last chapter. We\u2019re gonna be so happy when we move into our new flat. Nothing has to change.\u201d She rolls her eyes, laughing softly. \u201cYou\u2019re still the only man that I love, and we\u2019re still <i>us.</i>\u201d</p><p>Harry holds her hands on his cheeks then nods once. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love me no matter what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve loved you since you were an oblivious asshole. How hard can it be to love you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got a good point.\u201d<br></p><p>She smiles at her boyfriend and pulls him into a hug, feeling his arms tightened around her waist.\u00a0Maybe now, she is finally ready to say her goodbye to this place to begin anew. This is her home, <i>yes</i>, but home is not a place, it\u2019s a person. So as long as she has him, she knows they\u2019re gonna be just fine.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N quickly walks in front of Harry and stands between him and the door to prevent him from carrying his boxes into this room behind her.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cBringing my stuff to <b>my</b> room?\u201d He barely looks at her, and she\u2019s had enough with his arrogant attitude. If they\u2019re going to spend the rest of their university years under the same roof, she\u2019s not going to let him act all superior and treat her terribly.</i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>Your</b> room?! We haven\u2019t discussed who\u2019s getting this room yet!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cLet me make this simpler for us and say this is my room.\u201d He smiles and takes a step to the left so as to get through her, yet she\u2019s quick to block his path with her arms opened wide.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThis is not your room!\u201d She asserts. \u201cI walked in there first!\u201d</i></p><p><i>She doesn\u2019t actually need this room, she can just take the other one and spare herself an argument. It\u2019s not about this one being bigger than the other, it\u2019s about winning, and she cannot stand him thinking he can just get everything that he wants.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on, the other one has its own bathroom inside!\u201d Harry fights back, not letting this go easily. \u201cYou\u2019ll get all the privacy you need, you can just live in there if you want to!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to! I want this room!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure? Because if you forget to bring your clothes to the shower, you\u2019re gonna have to walk out naked and I\u2019m gonna see more than I anticipate.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d She lifts her jaw and puts both hands on her hips. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to see anyway.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry raises an eyebrow and sends his flatmate a cheeky smirk as he replies, \u201cI\u2019m gonna need proof to believe that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re just sick!\u201d She rolls her eyes in reaction to his words then crosses her arms firmly. \u201cRock, paper, scissors?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSeriously, are you twelve?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, got any better suggestion? It\u2019s the only way we can solve this problem,\u201d she tells him with a straight face. Harry sighs, still he assumes she\u2019s got a point. As stubborn as she is, he\u2019s sure she won\u2019t let this go easily. He doesn\u2019t actually want the bigger room that much, he just doesn\u2019t want her to get it. And he has to make sure she won\u2019t.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine. \u2018Rock, paper, scissors\u2019 as you wish.\u201d He nods with confidence, like somehow he knows he\u2019s going to win.</i></p><p><i>And\u2026</i></p><p><i>He wins.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy scissors cut the shit out of your paper.\u201d He chuckles at the look on her face as she cannot believe she\u2019s been defeated. \u201cNow can you move so I can bring my stuff into <b>my</b> room?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine! Take the room!\u201d She says bitterly when he walks past her with a smug on his face. \u201cI hope you sleep well at night knowing you\u2019re an asshole that will probably end up alone for the rest of his life for being such an asshole.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry opens the door, stops and turns around to look at the girl in amusement. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking. I\u2019m sure by the time you receive my wedding invitation you\u2019re still living alone with a cat.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She snorts, eyes widened at him. \u201cWell, whoever ends up marrying you is an idiot.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay you know what? You just got yourself uninvited to my wedding\u2026if it ever happens.\u201d He gives her a shrug and closes the door between them when he enters his new room.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N clenches her fists and takes a deep breath. The little voice inside her head tells her to calm down. First day moving in and she already wants to leave, but from now until graduation, she\u2019s gonna have to see his stupid face every single day.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p>Y/N lifts the weight off her feet and falls down on their newly made bed, sighing contently for how comfy it feels. She loves it. She loves their new bedroom, she loves their new flat.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be late for work everyday just to stay in this incredibly soft bed, but it\u2019ll all be worth it!\u201d Y/N laughs, closing her eyes as she feels herself sinking into the warm bed covers.\u00a0</p><p>Harry, who\u2019s been watching his girl with a grin this whole time, finally decides to get in with her. He falls down\u00a0by her side, on his back and reaches out to hold her hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made it,\u201d she whispers and lies on her side to run her fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs excited as I am to start our new life here,\u201d replies Harry. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to fuck you on our new bed.\u201d</p><p>Y/N giggles and opens her mouth to say something, but all of a sudden, she\u2019s interrupted by the female voice at their bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cYes please, we\u2019d love a free show.\u201d</p><p>The couple shoot their heads to the entrance and quickly sit up when they see Niall and Layla staring at them.</p><p>\u201cWhile you horny teenagers were shamelessly planning on having sex in here, my boyfriend and I were cleaning <i>your</i> kitchen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, L. I\u2019m coming!\u201d Y/N laughs as she stands up from the bed and follows Layla out of the room, leaving Niall behind with Harry. Both of them exchange smiles now that the girls are gone.<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Niall begins, and judging from the look on his face, Harry can already tell what he\u2019s going to ask next.\u00a0\u201cWhen are you gonna give<i> it</i> to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure yet,\u201d answers Harry as he rises from the bed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for the right moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not right after we\u2019ve just moved into our new place?\u201d Harry\u00a0laughs, and so does Niall. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until she\u2019s settled with her new job. If I\u2019m gonna do this, I need time to\u00a0do this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m very proud of you, H.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The two men almost scream when they hear Layla\u2019s voice. Niall quickly turn around and receive a death glare from his\u00a0angry girlfriend. Harry\u2019s heart stops for a second thinking she\u2019s heard more than she should have.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not what?\u201d Niall swallows nervously, causing Layla to roll her eyes upward.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not proud of either of you! You\u2019re gonna let Y/N and I clean the entire kitchen?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, no, god no!\u201d Harry cries out, however, he feels very relieved.\u00a0\u201cNiall, you go first, I need to\u00a0pee.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell pee fast!\u201d Layla tells him then storms away, Niall quickly follows so as not to make her angrier.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>When they\u2019re finally out of sight, Harry shoves his hand into his trousers pocket and pulls out a small box which he\u2019s been keeping a secret from Y/N for a week now. He puts it away in the bottom drawer in their closet, at the very back, underneath his newly folded clothes, where he\u2019s sure she will never find.\u00a0</p><p>He needs to\u00a0hide it from her, just for now, until they\u2019re both ready.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>It\u2019s one of those nights when Harry comes home really late (or early because it was nearly two in the morning). Y/N wakes up to the sound of him banging on the front door and calling out her name. By the tone of his voice, she knows he is very wasted, but to be honest, this is nothing. The worst time was when he refused to believe she was his flatmate and kept asking her to leave or else he\u2019d call the police. At least this time he still remembers her name.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you know what time it is?!\u201d She stands in front of the door and grumbles to him instead of letting him in like she did the last few times.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N, open the door\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i></i><i>\u201cWhere\u2019s your key?\u201d She inquires. Of course she wants to just open the door for him so she can head back to bed, yet if she keeps letting him get away with this, he won\u2019t ever learn.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI lost it,\u201d he admits. Drunk Harry is very honest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s your third key Harry!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Harry stresses out the final sound then takes a really long pause, probably struggling to put the words into a sentence. \u201c\u2026I think\u2026it fell out\u2026when I was with\u2026this girl\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>Of course. <i>She should\u2019ve known.</i></p><p><i>Y/N furrows her eyebrows then rests her forehead against the door, squeezing her eyes shut. There\u2019s always \u201cthis girl\u201d. Having known him for so long, she shouldn\u2019t still feel disappointed. The problem is not him, he\u2019s still the same him. It\u2019s her who\u2019s changed.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She likes him.</i></p><p><i>So if it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s hers, for liking him even though she knows too well she won\u2019t ever be \u201cthis girl\u201d in his stories. However, right now she feels like he\u2019s the one to blame.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou may want to call that girl of yours, because I\u2019m not letting you in tonight,\u201d Y/N finally speaks with a lump in her throat, because she doesn\u2019t mean a single word she just said to him. \u201cGo crash at her place or just sleep outside, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N, please\u2026\u201d He knocks on the door three times rapidly. \u201cMy tummy hurts, my head hurts.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou should\u2019ve thought about that before deciding to come back at two in the morning and ruin my sleep!\u201d Y/N firmly declares, though she knows this has nothing to do with him ruining her sleep. Had he not say he wouldn\u2019t come back tonight, she would\u2019ve stayed up waiting for him anyway. It\u2019s just her being mad at him for hurting her feelings, even if it\u2019s unintentionally.</i></p><p><i>She goes ahead and ignores Harry\u2019s constant apologies and pleading to return to her bedroom, too angry to feel sorry for him\u2026for now at least.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s not until she\u2019s climbed back into bed, buries herself under the warm covers, and drowns in the sound of utter silence, does she start to feel guilty for what she\u2019s done. </i><i>Y/N cannot fall back into sleep. </i><i>She begins to think about how it\u2019s cold outside and her flatmate is left in the hallway without these soft and comfy bed covers to keep him warm.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Harry has stopped knocking or calling her name. He did say his head and tummy were hurting, and he\u2019s also drunk. After spending the night outside he\u2019ll be sick for sure. </i><i>Y/N bites her lip as she puckers up her forehead. She doesn\u2019t want Harry to be sick! It\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s making him pay for the crime he doesn\u2019t even knows he committed\u2026</i></p><p><i>That final thought sends Y/N out of bed. She quickly heads out to open the door and she hopes he hasn\u2019t left yet.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019s still in the hallway. </i>Thank God! <i>Y/N thinks to herself as she releases a sigh of relief and warches towards her flatmate who\u2019s standing in front of the lift, just staring at the closed door.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry, what are you doing?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWaiting for the door to open,\u201d he grumbles in annoyance. His eyes are squinty and his brows are knitted together. She can\u2019t help but giggle at how funny he looks. \u201cWhy\u2019s it taking soooo long?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry you haven\u2019t pressed the button.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOhhhhhh, thanks,\u201d he replies then reaches out to press it but she takes his hand immediately.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside.\u201d She tries to lead him back to their flat but he stands still and refuses to come along.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not going! You told me to leave!\u201d He pouts and withdraws his hand from hers, crossing his arms in front of his chest like an angry little boy.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhose fault was that?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou! You were\u2026very mean, Y/N\u2026\u201d he says drunkenly. Right now, Y/N is trying her best not laugh her butt off. She can just make fun of him in the morning, now she needs to get him inside before one of their neighbors start complaining.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this right now. Come with me!\u201d She doesn\u2019t need his approval to grab his wrist and pulls him with her back to their flat. He starts talking nonsense again and she\u2019s too exhausted to ask him what he means. When they\u2019ve finally got into their flat, she locks the door and turns to see Harry still standing there staring at her.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d She asks, unable to interpret the look on his face.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N don\u2019t be mad at me,\u201d he says while fighting to keep his tired eyes open. \u201cI\u2026didn\u2019t\u2026didn\u2019t mean to lose the key\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re forgiven. Go to bed.\u201d She holds his elbow to spin him around, pushing him to his bedroom. He walks with her a few steps then quickly stops and turns to face her again.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI was sad when you locked me out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She swallows hard. The look on his face makes her heart stop for a second.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2026You also made me sad\u2026\u201d she blurts out before she can stop herself. It freaks her out a little bit, but all he does is furrow his eyebrows at her. Y/N quickly realizes he\u2019s probably too drunk to even remember this tomorrow morning. He doesn\u2019t bother to ask her to explain what she just told him, he wasn\u2019t sober enough to get it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026I\u2019m happy now that you\u2019re here!\u201d He gives her a silly smile and intends to pull her in for a hug but he trips and nearly fall onto the floor. Lucky for him, she\u2019s there to catch him just in time.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, bed now.\u201d She rolls her eyes, one arm around his waist while his around her shoulders. She walks him to his room as he starts singing really off-tune. Harry keeps forgetting the words, so he just goes la-la-la for the rest of the song.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N watches Harry fall onto his bed with a satisfied smile on his face, sighing to herself now that she\u2019s finally free to go.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan you stroke my hair?\u201d He asks, his eyes are still closed.</i></p><p><i>Y/N stands by the side of his bed and crosses her arms as she raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPleeeeeeease?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t let you sleep on the floor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFineeeeeeeeee!\u201d He whines then turns to the side, facing his back to her.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Y/N doesn\u2019t leave just yet, she stays for a little while, just standing there watching him falling asleep.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf it was me who came home drunk, would you take care of me too?\u201d She quietly inquires, not him, but herself. Of course there\u2019s no answer, because she doesn\u2019t know if there\u2019s even a place for her in his heart.</i></p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>\u201cHarry! Your eyes are so greeeeeeeen! You\u2019re the most beautiful person in the whole wide world!\u201d</i> Y/N sings at the top of her lungs which makes Harry laugh though they receive a few judging stares from the people they pass by on the street.</p><p>\u201cDid you just make up a song for me baby?\u201d He asks, tightening his grip on her waist so as to keep her from tumbling down on her wobbling feet. She\u2019s a fun drunk he\u2019s gotta admit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you a song one day!\u201d Y/N declares to the world as she raises one finger in the air. \u201cI\u2019ll write you a song about how much I loveeeeee you! I love you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019m very flattered,\u201d he tells her and sighs in relief when they finally arrive at their building.\u00a0</p><p>When the young couple enter the lobby, their middle-aged doorman is in the middle of the conversation with an old lady, who\u2019s also living in this building apparently.</p><p>\u201cAlbert, I\u2019m serious! I saw Felicia bring home a new dog - the fifth one this month!\u201d Says the woman. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna get into so much trouble if her landlord finds out!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGive the poor woman a break, would you?\u201d Replies Albert. \u201cThe only reason she owns so many dogs is to fill up her loneliness when her husband left her for a young girl. I\u2019m telling you, Greta, everyone in this building has their own story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening!\u201d Y/N happily shouts, causing the doorman and the old woman to both stare at her and Harry. They seem quite confused, but amused at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYour wife drank a bit too much I see,\u201d says Greta to Harry, who slightly shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my apologies, I saw the ring so I thought you two were married.\u201d</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t make further comments about the promise ring on Y/N\u2019s finger or the possibility of there soon to be a new one. He simply smiles and says he\u2019s very sorry for how loud Y/N is.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Y/N finally speaks up with her eyes still closed. \u201cTake off my clothes. They\u2019re itchy.\u201d</p><p>Her request makes Albert and Greta laugh. Harry, on the other hand, has to grab her hand before she can unbutton her own shirt and flash the two strangers here.</p><p>\u201cNot here, baby. Keep your clothes on,\u201d he whispers, making her pout, but she listens to him and drops her hands back to her sides.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he softly says to her before turning\u00a0back to give the door man and the woman an apologetic smile. \u201cI should get her back to our flat now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Albert stops them before they can turn away. \u201cAre you two the couple in flat 102?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The man gives Harry two spare keys for the flat and Harry assumes it\u2019s a mistake, because they\u2019ve received their spare keys already. Before he gets a chance to speak, however, Albert quickly adds in,\u00a0\u201cyour girlfriend paid for two extras because she said you tend to lose your keys a lot.\u201d</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes as he looks at his girlfriend, who somehow has fallen asleep with her head on his shoulder, and probably won\u2019t have any memory of this conversation when she wakes up.</p><p>\u201cYou know me too well, don\u2019t you?\u201d He tells her before taking the keys and thanking the doorman one more time before leaving. \u201cHave a great evening, sir, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your girl too, young man!\u201d Greta shouts out and waves at the young couple as they walk away towards the lift. After that\u00a0she immediately turns to her old friend Albert.\u00a0\u201cI like those two kids.\u00a0What do you think their story is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Albert lets out a happy sigh as he watches Harry taking Y/N into the lift and kissing her hair \u201c\u2026I hope we\u2019ll get to find out.\u201d</p></p>",

(There are spoilers in this chapters, but are they really spoilers if you don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re spoilers? ;) )</b></p><p><b>Warning: a bit of smut, a bit of angst, a bunch of fluff.</b></p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to keep these?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N holds up a box of old books she found in Harry&rsquo;s closet and&nbsp;tries not to kick over the carton boxes, or step on random objects lying on the bedroom floor, as she brings it to him.&nbsp;</p><p>He picks up one book, checks the front cover, and the back, then puts it back inside the box.</p><p>&ldquo;They can go,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;I know an old bookstore that may want to rebuy them,&rdquo; she tells him, setting the box down and dusting off her hands. &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re keeping too many stuff?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the one who wouldn&rsquo;t let me throw away most of them, including those Christmas decorations from last year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Christmas isn&rsquo;t a one time thing, H! We can reuse them!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You might as well just pack the whole flat with you to our new one.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N rolls her eyes and sits down on the floor, sighing as she does. Harry&rsquo;s right, she should probably get rid of what they haven&rsquo;t touched in over a year. It&rsquo;s impossible to bring everything to their new place, but she&rsquo;s trying to keep as many as possible. Throwing something in this flat away makes her heart sting, because everything here holds a memory of her and Harry and she&rsquo;s not ready to let go just yet, even though they&rsquo;re moving out <i>tomorrow</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this is really happening,&rdquo; Y/N mumbles when she pulls out a box from under Harry&rsquo;s bed and&nbsp;opens it. Harry soon joins her on the floor and helps her unbox another one.</p><p>&ldquo;Love, you said the exact same thing last week at our graduation,&rdquo; he tells her, chuckling a little bit at her facial expression.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me! Everything is just moving too fast!&rdquo; She replies with a sigh.&nbsp;</p><p>It feels as if they&rsquo;d only met yesterday, and their time in university had already passed in just a blink of an eye. Harry may not care a lot about leaving this place, in fact he seems like he&rsquo;s actually happy now that they&rsquo;re moving into a bigger flat. Y/N, on the other hand, struggles to let go of the past and begins anew.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Y/N questions when she catches Harry smirking at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Just thinking about our new life together, s&rsquo;all.&rdquo; His answer makes her smile, but then he furrows his eyebrows and pulls a very serious face which gets her confused for a second. &ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s still not too late for you to back out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love, you said the exact same thing when we first met!&rdquo; Her almost accurate imitation of his voice cracks him up.</p><p>&ldquo;That impression was spot on,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you that.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N responses to Harry with a proud smile on her face, then she resumes checking what&rsquo;s inside the box between her legs. This one is full of her boyfriend&rsquo;s old clothes, most of these Harry hasn&rsquo;t touched in years. She goes through it real quick, then a piece of clothing really catches her eyes. She excitedly pulls out a red sweater with a huge Santa Claus head printed on the front and the words &lsquo;<i>Merry Christmas&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;on the back. It&rsquo;s pretty extra, she must admit, but that was why she bought it in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I got you this on our first Christmas here!&rdquo; She shows it to him with a wide smile on her face whereas he groans and covers his with both hands.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh God, that sweater!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? It&rsquo;s cute! How come I&rsquo;ve never seen you wear it again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s way too&hellip;<i>much,</i> Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N puckers up her forehead and shoves the sweater back inside the box, pouting as she tells him, &ldquo;fine! If you hate my Christmas gift so much I&rsquo;ll throw it away then!&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing her say that and seeing her facial expression amuses Harry, he thinks she looks cute when she&rsquo;s pretending to be mad. So before she can close the box, he pulls it away from her and takes out the sweater himself. Without saying a word, Harry puts it on, smiling as he does a ridiculous pose in the awfully uncomfortable sweater.&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N cannot keep a straight face anymore. She tosses her head back and laughs, then finally agrees that he does look silly in it.</p><p>The two continues going through the rest of Harry&rsquo;s closet. They need to get the work in here done so as to move to Y/N&rsquo;s room, and take care of the mess over there.&nbsp;</p><p>While Y/N is folding the old t-shirts that don&rsquo;t fit Harry anymore and putting them in another box, which she&rsquo;s labeled <i>&ldquo;giveaway&rdquo;</i>, Harry cannot take his eyes off her. He likes to watch his girlfriend when she&rsquo;s not looking, to secretly admire how adorable she is every time she does something unintentionally. Like the way she purses her lips, the way she scrunches her nose, how she furrows her eyebrows, the smile on her face when she thinks he&rsquo;s not paying attention.&nbsp;</p><p>He just loves watching her do things, that&rsquo;s all.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out tonight and celebrate us moving out!&rdquo; He suddenly breaks the comfortable silence between the two of them, causing Y/N to look up from the shirt in her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;I wish I could.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got other plans for tonight?&rdquo; He asks, sounding a bit disappointed because he thought they&rsquo;d get to spend their last night in this flat together.</p><p>&ldquo;My boss asked me to go see a client with him. I couldn&rsquo;t say no, I&rsquo;ve only been working there for a week now, gotta stay relevant, right?&rdquo; she tells him, giggling a little bit to lighten up the mood, but Harry only replies with a simple nod.&nbsp;</p><p>He seems really let down and she can&rsquo;t blame him for that. So Y/N gets up on all fours then crawls to Harry&rsquo;s side, hugging him tightly and laying her head on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;How about tomorrow night?&rdquo; She suggests, glancing up to watch his reaction. &ldquo;If we cannot celebrate us moving out, we can celebrate us moving in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he finally says and turns his head to face her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not mad at me anymore?&rdquo; she questions.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;re cute.&rdquo; He exhales a smile before leaning in and pecking her lips. How can he ever get mad at her to begin with?</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>Harry rises up from his bed, the naked brunette lying beside him begs him to stay, but he just gives her a quick kiss, and promises to make it up to her once he returns.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s around 2AM now, or so, he doesn&rsquo;t really pay attention when he glances at the clock on the kitchen wall. He only intends to get a glass of water and heads back for another round with that pretty girl. He doesn&rsquo;t expect his flatmate Y/N to still be awake at this hour, because why would she?</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The voice catches Harry by surprise. He looks up, a bit taken aback to see Y/N walk through the kitchen door. She stops in front of him with her hands laying flat on the kitchen table. He assumes the noises from his bedroom earlier woke her up, but she looks too happy for someone whose sleep was interrupted.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;When did you get back?&rdquo; She asks.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;An hour ago,&rdquo; he replies shortly. It takes her a moment, but somehow she figures it out on her own.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is there someone in your room?&rdquo; The question comes with a nervous laugh. Harry has no idea how she knows it, but he&rsquo;s not going to lie to her now.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He admits without hesitation, but then instantly regrets it once he sees her smile fade away.</i></p><p><i>He&rsquo;s never cared about what she thinks about his complicated &ldquo;relationships&rdquo;, why does he care now? Why does he feel guilty for telling her this? Why does she look so sad? Does she care who he&rsquo;s with? Those questions are spinning around Harry&rsquo;s head as he waits for her to say something else. However&hellip;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;,&rdquo; is her only reply.</i></p><p><i>Harry puts the glass of water down and stares at her with his eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if we woke you up, promise we won&rsquo;t be too loud later.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He honestly doesn&rsquo;t know why he said that. Maybe he&rsquo;s just trying to prove that he doesn&rsquo;t care about how she feels (if she does feel anything about this), but the problem is, he <b>does</b> care about how she feels. He is worried and wants to know why she&rsquo;s up so late, and whether she&rsquo;s been waiting for him to come home or not. His pride doesn&rsquo;t allow him to ask her.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;m going back to bed now,&rdquo; she tells him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;See you in the morning,&rdquo; he says when she turns away, However, she doesn&rsquo;t respond, and Harry feels bad, really bad.</i></p><p><i>He walks back to his room and the naked brunette sits up as soon as she sees him. He feels her chest pressed against his back when he takes a seat on the edge of the bed. Her hot lips leave wet kisses from behind his ear down to his shoulder blade while she&rsquo;s moaning his name and telling him how much she wants him. He, however, does not, not even a little bit, not at all.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I heard you talking to your flatmate,&rdquo; says the girl as she runs her palms up and down his bare chest. &ldquo;Did she complain about us waking her up?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I think she stayed up to wait for me to come home.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Poor girl. I think she&rsquo;s got a crush on you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Harry chuckles slightly, shaking his head. &ldquo;She just worries a lot, which makes me feel guilty, because if it was her coming home late, I don&rsquo;t think I&nbsp;would do the same.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, I still think she likes you.&rdquo; The girl puts a finger to Harry&rsquo;s cheek and turns his face to hers, then leans in to kiss him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t blame her, you&rsquo;re irresistible.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Harry furrows his eyebrows at the girl for two seconds. She tries to read his mind, he can tell, but before she can figure out what he actually wants, Harry removes her hand from his face. Without warning, he pushes her down on the bed so he can get on top, and starts kissing his way down from her lips.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>This seems to her that he wants her just as much as she does him, whereas to him, this is nothing more than just goodbye sex. This girl obviously has feelings for Harry, and the last thing he needs right now is to deal with collateral damage.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&hellip;</i></p><p>Y/N carefully opens the fridge so as to not make a sound and wake up her boyfriend, whom she assumes must be asleep. She only just got home after a long night out, so after this glass of water, she&rsquo;s heading straight to bed for sure. Tomorrow is their moving out day, which is really important. She won&rsquo;t be able to get anything done if she wakes up at noon!</p><p>&ldquo;When did you get back?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The voice catches Y/N by surprise. She looks up, a bit taken aback to see Harry standing at the kitchen door, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;A while ago. Did I wake you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He shakes his head and walks over to hug her waist from behind. He loves holding her like this, and he knows she loves being held this way as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry shuts his eyes and buries his face into the crook of her neck, inhaling her scent deeply, as if he hadn&rsquo;t seen her in a really long time though it&rsquo;s only been a couple hours.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I missed you,&rdquo; he whispers against her skin, causing his girlfriend&rsquo;s head to fall back and her eyes shut tightly. She mumbles her apology for coming home late, and brings her right hand up behind her to stroke his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Need to&nbsp;feel you&hellip;&rdquo; He sounds almost desperate, running his hands from her stomach up to her breasts, kneading them, while breathing heavily into her bare shoulder. It&rsquo;d be a lie if Y/N said she wanted to turn him down and head to bed instead. Though they do have a lot of work to do tomorrow, she needs him just as much.</p><p>She arches her back and moaning his name. Harry&rsquo;s completely lost his mind. He grabs his girl by the hips then spins her around, and effortlessly lifts her up to sit on the edge of the table, so he&rsquo;s now standing between her spread legs. Harry thanks God that she&rsquo;s wearing a dress because he&rsquo;s got no patience left to take time removing her pants.</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s breath gets stuck in her throat when she feels his fingers pushing through her hot entrance. She&rsquo;s already soaked and Harry loses self-control for the feeling of her squeezing around his digits. He attaches their lips, moaning into the kiss as he starts pumping his fingers, starting slow then gradually building up the pace. Y/N has her hands secured behind his neck while she&rsquo;s gasping for air, but never breaks eye-contact. Watching her watching<i> him</i> drives Harry insane.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I need&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know baby&hellip;I know&hellip;&rdquo; He breathes into her mouth and withdraws his fingers, causing Y/N to groan at the loss. In a split second, he somehow manages to push his pants down and suddenly enters her with a sharp thrust of his hips. The burn makes Y/N&rsquo;s eyes roll back whereas Harry nearly explodes for how tight she feels squeezing around him. So they stay still for a couple seconds to get themselves adjusted, meanwhile they can&rsquo;t keep their mouths away from each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Want me to go slow?&rdquo; He whispers against her lips, to which she answers by shaking her head quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;<i>fast</i>&hellip;let me have you&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You already do&hellip;&rdquo; He chuckles and starts bucking his hips into hers, the words <i>&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;</i> start pouring out non-stop from his lips as if he hadn&rsquo;t told her enough already. But he still needs her to know. If he could, he would remind her every second of the day that he loves her. He loves her to the point it physically hurts thinking about her walking away from him. He would do anything for her.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take too long until both of them start chasing after their own orgasms together. Y/N is left seeing stars. She clings onto Harry as they ride through their the peak of their pleasure and it has to take her a moment to gain back her sight. Everything&rsquo;s been blurry from the moment she felt them both getting so close.&nbsp;</p><p>When Y/N opens her eyes again, she almost freaks out seeing his tear-filled eyes staring back at her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, are you alright?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; Harry tells her between soft chuckles as he feels himself slipping out, already making a mess on her thighs and her dress. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d be the one to cry after sex.&rdquo;</p><p>His comment makes Y/N laugh as she leans in to kiss his lips again, at the same time wiping the tears from the corners of his eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; She murmurs and the sound of her voice calms him down again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I just love you so much&hellip;&rdquo; He admits. His eyes fall to the side. &ldquo;I had a nightmare before you got home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? What was it about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were leaving me. You said we didn&rsquo;t spend enough time together and there was nothing I could do to fix us.&rdquo; Harry puckers up his forehead as he recalls the unpleasant feelings after waking up from that bad dream. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve told you that I couldn&rsquo;t wait to start our new life&hellip;but in reality I&rsquo;m also very scared&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean&hellip;We&rsquo;re not students anymore&hellip;You&rsquo;ve got your new job and I&rsquo;m already so busy with mine. We won&rsquo;t spend as much time with each other anymore&hellip;What if everything changes when we move into our new place? I don&rsquo;t want you to leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;H, look at me,&rdquo; Y/N speaks softly and Harry looks at her as he&rsquo;s told.&nbsp;</p><p>She gives him a reassuring smile then starts stroking his cheeks with her thumbs. It turns out it&rsquo;s not just her, them moving out affects him as well.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through so much together. We were in different countries for three months and we&rsquo;re still here, aren&rsquo;t we? Do you really think we&rsquo;re going to break up because we&rsquo;re busy people now?&rdquo;</p><p>Though Harry says nothing, but he&rsquo;s beaming again. That&rsquo;s all she needs to see right now.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not the last chapter. We&rsquo;re gonna be so happy when we move into our new flat. Nothing has to change.&rdquo; She rolls her eyes, laughing softly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still the only man that I love, and we&rsquo;re still <i>us.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Harry holds her hands on his cheeks then nods once. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna love me no matter what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve loved you since you were an oblivious asshole. How hard can it be to love you now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;ve got a good point.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She smiles at her boyfriend and pulls him into a hug, feeling his arms tightened around her waist.&nbsp;Maybe now, she is finally ready to say her goodbye to this place to begin anew. This is her home, <i>yes</i>, but home is not a place, it&rsquo;s a person. So as long as she has him, she knows they&rsquo;re gonna be just fine.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?!&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Y/N quickly walks in front of Harry and stands between him and the door to prevent him from carrying his boxes into this room behind her.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Bringing my stuff to <b>my</b> room?&rdquo; He barely looks at her, and she&rsquo;s had enough with his arrogant attitude. If they&rsquo;re going to spend the rest of their university years under the same roof, she&rsquo;s not going to let him act all superior and treat her terribly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Your</b> room?! We haven&rsquo;t discussed who&rsquo;s getting this room yet!&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Let me make this simpler for us and say this is my room.&rdquo; He smiles and takes a step to the left so as to get through her, yet she&rsquo;s quick to block his path with her arms opened wide.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;This is not your room!&rdquo; She asserts. &ldquo;I walked in there first!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She doesn&rsquo;t actually need this room, she can just take the other one and spare herself an argument. It&rsquo;s not about this one being bigger than the other, it&rsquo;s about winning, and she cannot stand him thinking he can just get everything that he wants.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Come on, the other one has its own bathroom inside!&rdquo; Harry fights back, not letting this go easily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get all the privacy you need, you can just live in there if you want to!&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to! I want this room!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you sure? Because if you forget to bring your clothes to the shower, you&rsquo;re gonna have to walk out naked and I&rsquo;m gonna see more than I anticipate.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Be my guest.&rdquo; She lifts her jaw and puts both hands on her hips. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much to see anyway.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Harry raises an eyebrow and sends his flatmate a cheeky smirk as he replies, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna need proof to believe that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just sick!&rdquo; She rolls her eyes in reaction to his words then crosses her arms firmly. &ldquo;Rock, paper, scissors?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Seriously, are you twelve?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, got any better suggestion? It&rsquo;s the only way we can solve this problem,&rdquo; she tells him with a straight face. Harry sighs, still he assumes she&rsquo;s got a point. As stubborn as she is, he&rsquo;s sure she won&rsquo;t let this go easily. He doesn&rsquo;t actually want the bigger room that much, he just doesn&rsquo;t want her to get it. And he has to make sure she won&rsquo;t.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fine. &lsquo;Rock, paper, scissors&rsquo; as you wish.&rdquo; He nods with confidence, like somehow he knows he&rsquo;s going to win.</i></p><p><i>And&hellip;</i></p><p><i>He wins.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My scissors cut the shit out of your paper.&rdquo; He chuckles at the look on her face as she cannot believe she&rsquo;s been defeated. &ldquo;Now can you move so I can bring my stuff into <b>my</b> room?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fine! Take the room!&rdquo; She says bitterly when he walks past her with a smug on his face. &ldquo;I hope you sleep well at night knowing you&rsquo;re an asshole that will probably end up alone for the rest of his life for being such an asshole.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Harry opens the door, stops and turns around to look at the girl in amusement. &ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s talking. I&rsquo;m sure by the time you receive my wedding invitation you&rsquo;re still living alone with a cat.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She snorts, eyes widened at him. &ldquo;Well, whoever ends up marrying you is an idiot.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay you know what? You just got yourself uninvited to my wedding&hellip;if it ever happens.&rdquo; He gives her a shrug and closes the door between them when he enters his new room.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Y/N clenches her fists and takes a deep breath. The little voice inside her head tells her to calm down. First day moving in and she already wants to leave, but from now until graduation, she&rsquo;s gonna have to see his stupid face every single day.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Y/N lifts the weight off her feet and falls down on their newly made bed, sighing contently for how comfy it feels. She loves it. She loves their new bedroom, she loves their new flat.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be late for work everyday just to stay in this incredibly soft bed, but it&rsquo;ll all be worth it!&rdquo; Y/N laughs, closing her eyes as she feels herself sinking into the warm bed covers.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry, who&rsquo;s been watching his girl with a grin this whole time, finally decides to get in with her. He falls down&nbsp;by her side, on his back and reaches out to hold her hand.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made it,&rdquo; she whispers and lies on her side to run her fingers through his hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As excited as I am to start our new life here,&rdquo; replies Harry. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to fuck you on our new bed.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N giggles and opens her mouth to say something, but all of a sudden, she&rsquo;s interrupted by the female voice at their bedroom door.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes please, we&rsquo;d love a free show.&rdquo;</p><p>The couple shoot their heads to the entrance and quickly sit up when they see Niall and Layla staring at them.</p><p>&ldquo;While you horny teenagers were shamelessly planning on having sex in here, my boyfriend and I were cleaning <i>your</i> kitchen.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, L. I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; Y/N laughs as she stands up from the bed and follows Layla out of the room, leaving Niall behind with Harry. Both of them exchange smiles now that the girls are gone.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Niall begins, and judging from the look on his face, Harry can already tell what he&rsquo;s going to ask next.&nbsp;&ldquo;When are you gonna give<i> it</i> to her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not sure yet,&rdquo; answers Harry as he rises from the bed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still waiting for the right moment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe not right after we&rsquo;ve just moved into our new place?&rdquo; Harry&nbsp;laughs, and so does Niall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait until she&rsquo;s settled with her new job. If I&rsquo;m gonna do this, I need time to&nbsp;do this right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very proud of you, H.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The two men almost scream when they hear Layla&rsquo;s voice. Niall quickly turn around and receive a death glare from his&nbsp;angry girlfriend. Harry&rsquo;s heart stops for a second thinking she&rsquo;s heard more than she should have.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not what?&rdquo; Niall swallows nervously, causing Layla to roll her eyes upward.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not proud of either of you! You&rsquo;re gonna let Y/N and I clean the entire kitchen?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, god no!&rdquo; Harry cries out, however, he feels very relieved.&nbsp;&ldquo;Niall, you go first, I need to&nbsp;pee.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well pee fast!&rdquo; Layla tells him then storms away, Niall quickly follows so as not to make her angrier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When they&rsquo;re finally out of sight, Harry shoves his hand into his trousers pocket and pulls out a small box which he&rsquo;s been keeping a secret from Y/N for a week now. He puts it away in the bottom drawer in their closet, at the very back, underneath his newly folded clothes, where he&rsquo;s sure she will never find.&nbsp;</p><p>He needs to&nbsp;hide it from her, just for now, until they&rsquo;re both ready.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>It&rsquo;s one of those nights when Harry comes home really late (or early because it was nearly two in the morning). Y/N wakes up to the sound of him banging on the front door and calling out her name. By the tone of his voice, she knows he is very wasted, but to be honest, this is nothing. The worst time was when he refused to believe she was his flatmate and kept asking her to leave or else he&rsquo;d call the police. At least this time he still remembers her name.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you know what time it is?!&rdquo; She stands in front of the door and grumbles to him instead of letting him in like she did the last few times.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, open the door&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i></i><i>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your key?&rdquo; She inquires. Of course she wants to just open the door for him so she can head back to bed, yet if she keeps letting him get away with this, he won&rsquo;t ever learn.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I lost it,&rdquo; he admits. Drunk Harry is very honest.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your third key Harry!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I think&hellip;&rdquo; Harry stresses out the final sound then takes a really long pause, probably struggling to put the words into a sentence. &ldquo;&hellip;I think&hellip;it fell out&hellip;when I was with&hellip;this girl&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>Of course. <i>She should&rsquo;ve known.</i></p><p><i>Y/N furrows her eyebrows then rests her forehead against the door, squeezing her eyes shut. There&rsquo;s always &ldquo;this girl&rdquo;. Having known him for so long, she shouldn&rsquo;t still feel disappointed. The problem is not him, he&rsquo;s still the same him. It&rsquo;s her who&rsquo;s changed.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>She likes him.</i></p><p><i>So if it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s fault, it&rsquo;s hers, for liking him even though she knows too well she won&rsquo;t ever be &ldquo;this girl&rdquo; in his stories. However, right now she feels like he&rsquo;s the one to blame.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You may want to call that girl of yours, because I&rsquo;m not letting you in tonight,&rdquo; Y/N finally speaks with a lump in her throat, because she doesn&rsquo;t mean a single word she just said to him. &ldquo;Go crash at her place or just sleep outside, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, please&hellip;&rdquo; He knocks on the door three times rapidly. &ldquo;My tummy hurts, my head hurts.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve thought about that before deciding to come back at two in the morning and ruin my sleep!&rdquo; Y/N firmly declares, though she knows this has nothing to do with him ruining her sleep. Had he not say he wouldn&rsquo;t come back tonight, she would&rsquo;ve stayed up waiting for him anyway. It&rsquo;s just her being mad at him for hurting her feelings, even if it&rsquo;s unintentionally.</i></p><p><i>She goes ahead and ignores Harry&rsquo;s constant apologies and pleading to return to her bedroom, too angry to feel sorry for him&hellip;for now at least.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s not until she&rsquo;s climbed back into bed, buries herself under the warm covers, and drowns in the sound of utter silence, does she start to feel guilty for what she&rsquo;s done. </i><i>Y/N cannot fall back into sleep. </i><i>She begins to think about how it&rsquo;s cold outside and her flatmate is left in the hallway without these soft and comfy bed covers to keep him warm.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Harry has stopped knocking or calling her name. He did say his head and tummy were hurting, and he&rsquo;s also drunk. After spending the night outside he&rsquo;ll be sick for sure. </i><i>Y/N bites her lip as she puckers up her forehead. She doesn&rsquo;t want Harry to be sick! It&rsquo;s not fair that she&rsquo;s making him pay for the crime he doesn&rsquo;t even knows he committed&hellip;</i></p><p><i>That final thought sends Y/N out of bed. She quickly heads out to open the door and she hopes he hasn&rsquo;t left yet.</i></p><p><i>He&rsquo;s still in the hallway. </i>Thank God! <i>Y/N thinks to herself as she releases a sigh of relief and warches towards her flatmate who&rsquo;s standing in front of the lift, just staring at the closed door.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Harry, what are you doing?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Waiting for the door to open,&rdquo; he grumbles in annoyance. His eyes are squinty and his brows are knitted together. She can&rsquo;t help but giggle at how funny he looks. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;s it taking soooo long?!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Harry you haven&rsquo;t pressed the button.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ohhhhhh, thanks,&rdquo; he replies then reaches out to press it but she takes his hand immediately.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go inside.&rdquo; She tries to lead him back to their flat but he stands still and refuses to come along.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going! You told me to leave!&rdquo; He pouts and withdraws his hand from hers, crossing his arms in front of his chest like an angry little boy.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Whose fault was that?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You! You were&hellip;very mean, Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; he says drunkenly. Right now, Y/N is trying her best not laugh her butt off. She can just make fun of him in the morning, now she needs to get him inside before one of their neighbors start complaining.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not doing this right now. Come with me!&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t need his approval to grab his wrist and pulls him with her back to their flat. He starts talking nonsense again and she&rsquo;s too exhausted to ask him what he means. When they&rsquo;ve finally got into their flat, she locks the door and turns to see Harry still standing there staring at her.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She asks, unable to interpret the look on his face.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N don&rsquo;t be mad at me,&rdquo; he says while fighting to keep his tired eyes open. &ldquo;I&hellip;didn&rsquo;t&hellip;didn&rsquo;t mean to lose the key&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;re forgiven. Go to bed.&rdquo; She holds his elbow to spin him around, pushing him to his bedroom. He walks with her a few steps then quickly stops and turns to face her again.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I was sad when you locked me out.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She swallows hard. The look on his face makes her heart stop for a second.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&hellip;You also made me sad&hellip;&rdquo; she blurts out before she can stop herself. It freaks her out a little bit, but all he does is furrow his eyebrows at her. Y/N quickly realizes he&rsquo;s probably too drunk to even remember this tomorrow morning. He doesn&rsquo;t bother to ask her to explain what she just told him, he wasn&rsquo;t sober enough to get it.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well&hellip;I&rsquo;m happy now that you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; He gives her a silly smile and intends to pull her in for a hug but he trips and nearly fall onto the floor. Lucky for him, she&rsquo;s there to catch him just in time.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay, bed now.&rdquo; She rolls her eyes, one arm around his waist while his around her shoulders. She walks him to his room as he starts singing really off-tune. Harry keeps forgetting the words, so he just goes la-la-la for the rest of the song.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Y/N watches Harry fall onto his bed with a satisfied smile on his face, sighing to herself now that she&rsquo;s finally free to go.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can you stroke my hair?&rdquo; He asks, his eyes are still closed.</i></p><p><i>Y/N stands by the side of his bed and crosses her arms as she raises an eyebrow at him. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Pleeeeeeease?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re lucky I didn&rsquo;t let you sleep on the floor.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fineeeeeeeeee!&rdquo; He whines then turns to the side, facing his back to her.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Y/N doesn&rsquo;t leave just yet, she stays for a little while, just standing there watching him falling asleep.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If it was me who came home drunk, would you take care of me too?&rdquo; She quietly inquires, not him, but herself. Of course there&rsquo;s no answer, because she doesn&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s even a place for her in his heart.</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Harry! Your eyes are so greeeeeeeen! You&rsquo;re the most beautiful person in the whole wide world!&rdquo;</i> Y/N sings at the top of her lungs which makes Harry laugh though they receive a few judging stares from the people they pass by on the street.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you just make up a song for me baby?&rdquo; He asks, tightening his grip on her waist so as to keep her from tumbling down on her wobbling feet. She&rsquo;s a fun drunk he&rsquo;s gotta admit.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write you a song one day!&rdquo; Y/N declares to the world as she raises one finger in the air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write you a song about how much I loveeeeee you! I love you so much!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, alright, I&rsquo;m very flattered,&rdquo; he tells her and sighs in relief when they finally arrive at their building.&nbsp;</p><p>When the young couple enter the lobby, their middle-aged doorman is in the middle of the conversation with an old lady, who&rsquo;s also living in this building apparently.</p><p>&ldquo;Albert, I&rsquo;m serious! I saw Felicia bring home a new dog - the fifth one this month!&rdquo; Says the woman. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna get into so much trouble if her landlord finds out!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Give the poor woman a break, would you?&rdquo; Replies Albert. &ldquo;The only reason she owns so many dogs is to fill up her loneliness when her husband left her for a young girl. I&rsquo;m telling you, Greta, everyone in this building has their own story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; Y/N happily shouts, causing the doorman and the old woman to both stare at her and Harry. They seem quite confused, but amused at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;Your wife drank a bit too much I see,&rdquo; says Greta to Harry, who slightly shakes his head.</p><p>&ldquo;My girlfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my apologies, I saw the ring so I thought you two were married.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry doesn&rsquo;t make further comments about the promise ring on Y/N&rsquo;s finger or the possibility of there soon to be a new one. He simply smiles and says he&rsquo;s very sorry for how loud Y/N is.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; Y/N finally speaks up with her eyes still closed. &ldquo;Take off my clothes. They&rsquo;re itchy.&rdquo;</p><p>Her request makes Albert and Greta laugh. Harry, on the other hand, has to grab her hand before she can unbutton her own shirt and flash the two strangers here.</p><p>&ldquo;Not here, baby. Keep your clothes on,&rdquo; he whispers, making her pout, but she listens to him and drops her hands back to her sides.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good girl,&rdquo; he softly says to her before turning&nbsp;back to give the door man and the woman an apologetic smile. &ldquo;I should get her back to our flat now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Albert stops them before they can turn away. &ldquo;Are you two the couple in flat 102?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;These are for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The man gives Harry two spare keys for the flat and Harry assumes it&rsquo;s a mistake, because they&rsquo;ve received their spare keys already. Before he gets a chance to speak, however, Albert quickly adds in,&nbsp;&ldquo;your girlfriend paid for two extras because she said you tend to lose your keys a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes as he looks at his girlfriend, who somehow has fallen asleep with her head on his shoulder, and probably won&rsquo;t have any memory of this conversation when she wakes up.</p><p>&ldquo;You know me too well, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He tells her before taking the keys and thanking the doorman one more time before leaving. &ldquo;Have a great evening, sir, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You and your girl too, young man!&rdquo; Greta shouts out and waves at the young couple as they walk away towards the lift. After that&nbsp;she immediately turns to her old friend Albert.&nbsp;&ldquo;I like those two kids.&nbsp;What do you think their story is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Albert lets out a happy sigh as he watches Harry taking Y/N into the lift and kissing her hair &ldquo;&hellip;I hope we&rsquo;ll get to find out.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Harry&rsquo;s right, she should probably get rid of what they haven&rsquo;t touched in over a year. It&rsquo;s impossible to bring everything to their new place, but she&rsquo;s trying to keep as many as possible. Throwing something in this flat away makes her heart sting, because everything here holds a memory of her and Harry and she&rsquo;s not ready to let go just yet, even though they&rsquo;re moving out <i>tomorrow</i>.</p>\n</p>",
