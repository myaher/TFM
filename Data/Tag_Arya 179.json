The time had come for her sister\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s Eve celebration. The party was grand and elegant and everything Arya hated. She would rather go to someone\u2019s backyard bonfire that go stand around in some pretentious evening gown while every person sipped champagne. She had to go though. Over the years her and Sansa have put aside their childlike bickering and replaced it with mutual respect. Their family had gone through too much in the past six years since their parents got into a car crash. All that was left of their family were the Stark children. Robb was seventeen and so was their cousin Jon. Since Robb was old enough to become their care dependant they were able to stick together. They never had to worry about money since their family came from old money. They were part of a group of families that descended from nobility. The other families in town called them all the noble families. A group of several families: the Starks, Targaryens, Tyrells, Tarlys, and the Baratheons. Arya loathed most of the children from the so called noble families. She fit in much better with the other people in town rather than the noble houses. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There were a few exceptions to the rule though. She enjoyed the company of Gendry Baratheon. Gendry was the half son of Robert Baratheon and acted nothing like his other siblings. Arya couldn\u2019t say they were all bad. Marcella was nice enough and Tommen was so young, but Joffrey was a royal pain in the ass. He strutted around like he was above everyone else and like they needed to cater to every single one of his evil whims. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gendry on the other hand always fought for what he wanted; he never left anything up to other people if he had the chance. He understood Arya and appreciated how she never fit the mold either. Together they were able to make it through it all. Well, that was until everyone started to gossip about them. The people in town were spreading nasty rumors about their relationship. They were only ever friends since they were four years apart, but that only added to the drama that the other families tried to create. Those vicious rumors were what lead to the downfall of their friendship. It fell apart slowly. It started with ignoring each other\u2019s text messages and phone calls. Then, they were hanging out less and less. It fell apart completely when Gendry met his ex girlfriend Melisandre. Arya hated her. She was older than Gendry and Arya thought she just wanted to take advantage of him, and that is just what that red-haired witch did. She used him and threw him away like he was nothing. Arya wanted nothing more to be there for him in those moments, but he had thrown her away when Melisandre told him of her dislike for Arya. Gendry apologized to Arya before he broke the news, but how did that make up for him destroying what little friendship they had left. They went for years without speaking to one another. That was until Arya attended the same university as he chose to go to. He was just starting Graduate school when Arya began her freshman year of college. They ran into one another and patched up their friendship as best they could with their past looming over their heads. It would never be the same though not when Arya felt what she did for him. There was constantly this voice in the back of her head questioning what would happen if she finally took that last leap of faith and pressed her lips to his. She wondered if he ever felt the same thing she did. Little did she know Gendry had felt that way for quite a long time. Still, every day it was walking on eggshells from both parties, both worried that one of them would spill their secret. Regardless of their situation they went on with their friendship and made plans to meet at Sansa\u2019s party. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arya had to compromise with her sister on her outfit for the party. Arya told her she wasn\u2019t going to wear a dress, and Sansa told her she couldn\u2019t wear her \u201cratty clothes\u201d. So compromise they did. Arya would not be showing up in a long flowing gown, she would be showing up in a romper that Sansa picked out herself. It was delivered this morning Arya hadn\u2019t even opened the box until right before the party. She was wearing mascara and her hair fell in natural waves around her face. When she opened the unreasonably large box she did smile. It wasn\u2019t one of those flowy rompers you saw at the mall. This romper was designer covered in champagne colored sparkles. Arya did not notice until she put it on just how low the v-neck was. Her cleavage was on full display and she felt so good about how she looked that the thought of being uncomfortable never crossed her mind, not until she walked down the stairs of their estate and into the party. Each and every head turned to look at her as she descended the staircase which made her uncomfortable. When she hit the floor she headed straight for the champagne and quickly put down two flutes. She grabbed a third before walking across the room to where she saw Jon last. Jon and Robb were standing together, Robb\u2019s girlfriend Talisa was leaning against him comfortably.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLook what the cat dragged in!\u201d Robb said drunkenly. The whisky in his glass already getting to him. Jon rolled his eyes while Talisa offered Arya a small smile. The small group of outsiders stood and chatted for a while without interruption until Jon looked over her shoulder happily.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGendry!\u201d The two shook hands as Gendry came to stand beside her. He greeted them all before taking a second glance at Arya in disbelief. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou look nice.\u201d Was what he came up with. Arya rolled her eyes at the half assed compliment and swallowed what remained in her glass before going to fetch another. She felt him follow her to the table. He grabbed a glass of bourbon and slammed it back, and then another, and another before settling on sipping one more lightly. Arya was now on her sixth glass of champagne and she could feel the booze pumping through her veins. In no time she would be completely and utterly drunk. Her and Gendry returned to their rag-tag group of misfits, both of them feeling the affects of the alcohol within minutes. They would both be lying if they said they knew what was happening around them. Drunk wasn\u2019t the right word for what they were feeling. Confident, bold, lucky those were all better terms for the way they were feeling and acting. No one around them was sober enough to notice what was going on, hells, neither of them were. After a few more drinks they reached unsafe territory where their bodies were acting before their brains. Even more drinks lead to even bolder decisions, both of them throwing caution to the wind. Before they knew it the ball had dropped and their mouths were on each others with a searing passion. Those years of kept secrets finally coming to the surface. The party continued on for hours and the drinks kept coming until both of them were blackout drunk. Only the morning would reveal the true damage of tonight\u2019s affairs.</p>",

The other families in town called them all the noble families. A group of several families: the Starks, Targaryens, Tyrells, Tarlys, and the Baratheons. Arya loathed most of the children from the so called noble families. She fit in much better with the other people in town rather than the noble houses. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few exceptions to the rule though. She enjoyed the company of Gendry Baratheon. Gendry was the half son of Robert Baratheon and acted nothing like his other siblings. Arya couldn&rsquo;t say they were all bad. Marcella was nice enough and Tommen was so young, but Joffrey was a royal pain in the ass. He strutted around like he was above everyone else and like they needed to cater to every single one of his evil whims. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gendry on the other hand always fought for what he wanted; he never left anything up to other people if he had the chance. He understood Arya and appreciated how she never fit the mold either. Together they were able to make it through it all. Well, that was until everyone started to gossip about them. The people in town were spreading nasty rumors about their relationship. They were only ever friends since they were four years apart, but that only added to the drama that the other families tried to create. Those vicious rumors were what lead to the downfall of their friendship. It fell apart slowly. It started with ignoring each other&rsquo;s text messages and phone calls. Then, they were hanging out less and less. It fell apart completely when Gendry met his ex girlfriend Melisandre. Arya hated her. She was older than Gendry and Arya thought she just wanted to take advantage of him, and that is just what that red-haired witch did. She used him and threw him away like he was nothing. Arya wanted nothing more to be there for him in those moments, but he had thrown her away when Melisandre told him of her dislike for Arya. Gendry apologized to Arya before he broke the news, but how did that make up for him destroying what little friendship they had left. They went for years without speaking to one another. That was until Arya attended the same university as he chose to go to. He was just starting Graduate school when Arya began her freshman year of college. They ran into one another and patched up their friendship as best they could with their past looming over their heads. It would never be the same though not when Arya felt what she did for him. There was constantly this voice in the back of her head questioning what would happen if she finally took that last leap of faith and pressed her lips to his. She wondered if he ever felt the same thing she did. Little did she know Gendry had felt that way for quite a long time. Still, every day it was walking on eggshells from both parties, both worried that one of them would spill their secret. Regardless of their situation they went on with their friendship and made plans to meet at Sansa&rsquo;s party. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arya had to compromise with her sister on her outfit for the party. Arya told her she wasn&rsquo;t going to wear a dress, and Sansa told her she couldn&rsquo;t wear her &ldquo;ratty clothes&rdquo;. So compromise they did. Arya would not be showing up in a long flowing gown, she would be showing up in a romper that Sansa picked out herself. It was delivered this morning Arya hadn&rsquo;t even opened the box until right before the party. She was wearing mascara and her hair fell in natural waves around her face. When she opened the unreasonably large box she did smile. It wasn&rsquo;t one of those flowy rompers you saw at the mall. This romper was designer covered in champagne colored sparkles. Arya did not notice until she put it on just how low the v-neck was. Her cleavage was on full display and she felt so good about how she looked that the thought of being uncomfortable never crossed her mind, not until she walked down the stairs of their estate and into the party. Each and every head turned to look at her as she descended the staircase which made her uncomfortable. When she hit the floor she headed straight for the champagne and quickly put down two flutes. She grabbed a third before walking across the room to where she saw Jon last. Jon and Robb were standing together, Robb&rsquo;s girlfriend Talisa was leaning against him comfortably.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look what the cat dragged in!&rdquo; Robb said drunkenly. The whisky in his glass already getting to him. Jon rolled his eyes while Talisa offered Arya a small smile. The small group of outsiders stood and chatted for a while without interruption until Jon looked over her shoulder happily.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gendry!&rdquo; The two shook hands as Gendry came to stand beside her. He greeted them all before taking a second glance at Arya in disbelief. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You look nice.&rdquo; Was what he came up with. Arya rolled her eyes at the half assed compliment and swallowed what remained in her glass before going to fetch another. She felt him follow her to the table. He grabbed a glass of bourbon and slammed it back, and then another, and another before settling on sipping one more lightly. Arya was now on her sixth glass of champagne and she could feel the booze pumping through her veins. In no time she would be completely and utterly drunk. Her and Gendry returned to their rag-tag group of misfits, both of them feeling the affects of the alcohol within minutes. They would both be lying if they said they knew what was happening around them. Drunk wasn&rsquo;t the right word for what they were feeling. Confident, bold, lucky those were all better terms for the way they were feeling and acting. No one around them was sober enough to notice what was going on, hells, neither of them were. After a few more drinks they reached unsafe territory where their bodies were acting before their brains. Even more drinks lead to even bolder decisions, both of them throwing caution to the wind. Before they knew it the ball had dropped and their mouths were on each others with a searing passion. Those years of kept secrets finally coming to the surface. The party continued on for hours and the drinks kept coming until both of them were blackout drunk. Only the morning would reveal the true damage of tonight&rsquo;s affairs.</p></p>",

He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. There were shadows all around them. One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.",

This description seems to hint at the mysterious Kingsguard Ser Robert Strong, who most likely is the zombified remains of Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain that Rides.</p><p>Sandor Clegane has already played a part in both Sansa\u2019s and Arya\u2019s stories. Jaime Lannister is indirectly playing a role in their stories as well since he tasks Brienne with finding Catelyn Stark\u2019s daughters to keep them safe.</p><p>The Mountain/Ser Gregor/Ser Robert has played a part in Arya\u2019s story when she was at Harrenhal but he has yet to play a part in Sansa\u2019s story.</p>",

The first part of the vision seems to relate to the events of the Trident that resulted in Lady\u2019s death.</p><p>The three shadows surrounding Sansa and Arya are very interesting to me.\u00a0</p><p>The first shadow with the\u00a0\u201cterrible face of a hound\u201d most likely refers to Sandor Clegane, called the Hound and whose burned face is indeed terrible to behold.</p><p>The second shadow,\u00a0\u201carmored like the sun, golden and beautiful\u201d could refer to Jaime Lannister who on occasion wears a golden suit of armor decorated with the heraldic lion of the Lannisters. However, there are no lions in this vision but rather a symbolic connection between the gold and the sun.</p><p>The third shadow is rather interesting:\u00a0\u201ca giant made of stone\u201d but with no face beneath his visor, only darkness and black blood. This description seems to hint at the mysterious Kingsguard Ser Robert Strong, who most likely is the zombified remains of Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain that Rides.</p><p>Sandor Clegane has already played a part in both Sansa\u2019s and Arya\u2019s stories. Jaime Lannister is indirectly playing a role in their stories as well since he tasks Brienne with finding Catelyn Stark\u2019s daughters to keep them safe.</p><p>The Mountain/Ser Gregor/Ser Robert has played a part in Arya\u2019s story when she was at Harrenhal but he has yet to play a part in Sansa\u2019s story.</p>",

He was beyond drunk, and when he was drunk he lost his wits, oftentimes losing complete control of his tongue. He had a tendency of not connecting his brain and his mouth. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGods boy would you stop you moping?\u201d He all but shouted across the table where Gendry sat uncomfortably. \u201cWhat is it? Do you think if you keep staring at her she\u2019ll give you the time of day? I believe you lost that chance once she sailed across seas to Braavos, if you hadn\u2019t gone with the Red Witch the outcome probably would\u2019ve been different.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat bullshit are you spilling now Clegane?\u201d Jon looked at him with that northern glare. The Hound ignored him completely, still talking directly at the sole Baratheon.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEvery. Fucking. Night. She would go on and on about you in her sleep. Sometimes crying out your name in sorrow, other times anger, hell pleasure too I\u2019d bet.\u201d He took another gulp of his ale. \u201cShe loved you once I\u2019d say, but you threw that all away when you decided to stay with the fucking Brotherhood.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Everyone sat there and stared at the Hound, disbelief covered their faces. Every face except Arya\u2019s that is. Her face was shining beet-red from embarrassment. She mustn\u2019t of known what she did in her sleep all those years ago. He had enough sense to feel slightly guilty, but he also felt smug for knowing something she didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat little wolf?\u201d He yelled unabashedly. \u201cCat got your tongue? Or should I say Hound?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arya lunged for him then, she must\u2019ve been thankful that she chose to wear trousers today, if she hadn\u2019t she wouldn\u2019t have been able to get at him so easily. That Valyrian steel blade was pressed to his throat so face that he didn\u2019t have time to move let alone breathe. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou better watch that mouth of yours Clegane before you say something you regret.\u201d Arya pressed the blade a little harsher against the skin of his neck. He snarled at her and was about to pounce when Gendry spoke up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLook, we all know I fucked up.\u201d He said frankly, \u201cNo one here need you to remind me how I ruined my own future. I made the wrong decision and now I am going to have to live with that for the rest of my days. Forgive me your Grace, I\u2019m going to retire early.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gendry walked out of the great hall and into the night, but he wasn\u2019t out of earshot before the Hound yelp; \u201cWhat? Was it something I said?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gendry turned sharply and glared back, fully prepared to speak his mind once more, but he was beat to it when a loud slap rang against the stone walls. Arya had stuck Sandor so hard that he had a cut above his left eye that was slowly dripping blood. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSpeak one more word against my friend and I\u2019ll make sure that you\u2019ll be bed ridden for a long period of time.\u201d She was seething now, she couldn\u2019t help it. Arya couldn&rsquo;t bear to watch someone talk down to Gendry about the mistakes he made in his past. She understood why he made them now. At the time he was a bastard boy and her mother and brother would never approve of their relationship, no matter what it was. She was highborn and he was not. She thought his actions were unforgivable, but the horrible things she has done over the years outweighed the choices he made. It mattered not what decisions the two of them made in the past, it was the present and the future was not promised. The God of Death promised nothing to anyone and she would be a fool to believe she had all the time in the world to hold petty grudges. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat Gendry did in the past was cruel, but how I treated him was just as awful. We are new people now. For all you know we could be in love. So tell me Clegane, what is it that you think you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know is that you two are both wasting this time you preach about not having enough of. That boy over there worships the ground you walk on, he treats you as some kind of goddess, but you\u2019re too blind to see it. You still hold a grudge over what he did in the past whether you want to admit it or not. Well little wolf, get over it. Pull up your trousers and act like the woman we all know you to be. Stop being scared of something you don\u2019t know the outcome of.\u201d The Hounds words chilled her, but she wouldn\u2019t let him win. She stalked right over to Gendry and grabbed his face, pulling it down to hers. Harshly she pressed her lips against his, at first full of spite and loathing for the Hound, but all thoughts of Sandor Clegane left her mind when she felt his arms snake around her waist. If she heard the cheers of approval she didn\u2019t acknowledge them. Her sole focus was him, and it would be foolish of her to waste more time. Gendry must\u2019ve been thinking the same thing when he let her go. He looked her in the eyes and with all the confidence in the world asked her the few words she never imagined herself saying yes to. \u201cBe mine, now and always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and always. From this day until my last day I will be yours Gendry Baratheon and you will be mine.\u201d From across the room Jon\u2019s eyes lowered to the floor and he couldn\u2019t help but think of his first love and those same words she uttered to him so many years ago. He\u2019d be a liar if he said she didn\u2019t haunt his dreams. Jon just hoped that for his sister\u2019s sake she would never suffer the loss of her love. Though he figured she had, but Arya being Arya she was never willing to let go of what she wanted or what she loved. Hell she still had needle. Jon supposed that now she had everything she ever wanted. She was a warrior, one of the best in the Seven Kingdoms, and Gendry would never force her to be a lady. Jon could picture Ned Stark looking at her now and just how proud he would be to see his youngest daughter\u2019s dreams coming true.</p>",

I believe you lost that chance once she sailed across seas to Braavos, if you hadn\u2019t gone with the Red Witch the outcome probably would\u2019ve been different.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat bullshit are you spilling now Clegane?\u201d Jon looked at him with that northern glare. The Hound ignored him completely, still talking directly at the sole Baratheon.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEvery. Fucking. Night. She would go on and on about you in her sleep. Sometimes crying out your name in sorrow, other times anger, hell pleasure too I\u2019d bet.\u201d He took another gulp of his ale. \u201cShe loved you once I\u2019d say, but you threw that all away when you decided to stay with the fucking Brotherhood.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Everyone sat there and stared at the Hound, disbelief covered their faces. Every face except Arya\u2019s that is. Her face was shining beet-red from embarrassment. She mustn\u2019t of known what she did in her sleep all those years ago. He had enough sense to feel slightly guilty, but he also felt smug for knowing something she didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat little wolf?\u201d He yelled unabashedly. \u201cCat got your tongue? Or should I say Hound?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arya lunged for him then, she must\u2019ve been thankful that she chose to wear trousers today, if she hadn\u2019t she wouldn\u2019t have been able to get at him so easily. That Valyrian steel blade was pressed to his throat so face that he didn\u2019t have time to move let alone breathe. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou better watch that mouth of yours Clegane before you say something you regret.\u201d Arya pressed the blade a little harsher against the skin of his neck. He snarled at her and was about to pounce when Gendry spoke up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLook, we all know I fucked up.\u201d He said frankly, \u201cNo one here need you to remind me how I ruined my own future. I made the wrong decision and now I am going to have to live with that for the rest of my days. Forgive me your Grace, I\u2019m going to retire early.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gendry walked out of the great hall and into the night, but he wasn\u2019t out of earshot before the Hound yelp; \u201cWhat? Was it something I said?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gendry turned sharply and glared back, fully prepared to speak his mind once more, but he was beat to it when a loud slap rang against the stone walls. Arya had stuck Sandor so hard that he had a cut above his left eye that was slowly dripping blood. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSpeak one more word against my friend and I\u2019ll make sure that you\u2019ll be bed ridden for a long period of time.\u201d She was seething now, she couldn\u2019t help it. Arya couldn\u2019t bear to watch someone talk down to Gendry about the mistakes he made in his past. She understood why he made them now. At the time he was a bastard boy and her mother and brother would never approve of their relationship, no matter what it was. She was highborn and he was not. She thought his actions were unforgivable, but the horrible things she has done over the years outweighed the choices he made. It mattered not what decisions the two of them made in the past, it was the present and the future was not promised. The God of Death promised nothing to anyone and she would be a fool to believe she had all the time in the world to hold petty grudges. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat Gendry did in the past was cruel, but how I treated him was just as awful. We are new people now. For all you know we could be in love. So tell me Clegane, what is it that you think you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know is that you two are both wasting this time you preach about not having enough of. That boy over there worships the ground you walk on, he treats you as some kind of goddess, but you\u2019re too blind to see it. You still hold a grudge over what he did in the past whether you want to admit it or not. Well little wolf, get over it. Pull up your trousers and act like the woman we all know you to be. Stop being scared of something you don\u2019t know the outcome of.\u201d The Hounds words chilled her, but she wouldn\u2019t let him win. She stalked right over to Gendry and grabbed his face, pulling it down to hers. Harshly she pressed her lips against his, at first full of spite and loathing for the Hound, but all thoughts of Sandor Clegane left her mind when she felt his arms snake around her waist. If she heard the cheers of approval she didn\u2019t acknowledge them. Her sole focus was him, and it would be foolish of her to waste more time. Gendry must\u2019ve been thinking the same thing when he let her go. He looked her in the eyes and with all the confidence in the world asked her the few words she never imagined herself saying yes to. \u201cBe mine, now and always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and always. From this day until my last day I will be yours Gendry Baratheon and you will be mine.\u201d From across the room Jon\u2019s eyes lowered to the floor and he couldn\u2019t help but think of his first love and those same words she uttered to him so many years ago. He\u2019d be a liar if he said she didn\u2019t haunt his dreams. Jon just hoped that for his sister\u2019s sake she would never suffer the loss of her love. Though he figured she had, but Arya being Arya she was never willing to let go of what she wanted or what she loved. Hell she still had needle. Jon supposed that now she had everything she ever wanted. She was a warrior, one of the best in the Seven Kingdoms, and Gendry would never force her to be a lady. Jon could picture Ned Stark looking at her now and just how proud he would be to see his youngest daughter\u2019s dreams coming true.</p></p>",
