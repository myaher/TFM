        "answer": "<p>Warnings: drugs and alcohol abuse, self harm, mentions of molesting, statutory rape. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Peter <i>Parker</i> has never fit into his family. </p><p>He was adopted after his parents got in a car accident with his aunt and uncle, all of them dying. His grandma was just too grief stricken after losing both her children to take any kind of proper care of him. </p><p>So Peter <i>Parker</i> got adopted by Tony Stark and Pepper Stark. </p><p>He never saw his grandma again. She\u2019s still alive, still working even. She\u2019s only seventy-something. She just wants nothing to do with him. Never reached out, never sent letters. Never sent pictures of him or his parents.</p><p>He grew up feeling unwanted by his grandma. By his parents, even though that isn\u2019t fair. And his adoptive parents&hellip; they kept his last name. They didn\u2019t change it. They always made it clear he was adopted, and that he wasn\u2019t their kid. </p><p>It\u2019s hard not to feel like they don\u2019t actually want him, when they make it clear so often that he isn\u2019t their kid. </p><p>So when they announce to him that they\u2019re pregnant\u2014it\u2019s a miracle!! A miracle, Peter, they said I would never get pregnant!!\u2014he falls deeper into a depression he\u2019s turned out to be very good at hiding. </p><p>This baby will be named Morgan <i>Stark</i>. Stark. Because they actually want this baby. They\u2019ll love this baby, be proud of this baby. </p><p>Peter started cutting the day they announced. </p><p>It\u2019s been three months since then, the baby being due in six. He cuts often. In the shower, before school. After he sees Tony kissing Pepper\u2019s stomach. After he sees them move all the baby things in. After he sees them go to doctors appointments. </p><p>He drinks every night, not that the Stark\u2019s notice. He goes to Skip\u2019s house, gets drunk off his ass, hopes Skip didn\u2019t touch him. Acknowledges that he probably does. Goes home still drunk, not that they notice. </p><p>At six months in, Skip gave him some pill. He didn\u2019t know what it was, and he didn\u2019t ask. He swallowed it, using whiskey to smooth the way. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what it is, but it makes him not care anymore. He stops cutting, because why would he? He\u2019s so happy now. He fucks Skip, because the fact that Skip is 22 and he\u2019s 14 doesn\u2019t send off any alarm bells. Or the fact that he hates Skip. He loves the man now! He keeps giving Peter the pills. He loves those pills! And sex is amazing, it feels so good. He loves sex. Skip is really good at it, he makes Peter cum like five times. It\u2019s so amazing, Peter doesn\u2019t know how he ever lived without it. </p><p>How sad is it, that they don\u2019t notice anything is wrong until he starts acting happier? </p><p>He walks around humming, dancing to no music. He gets better grades, because he studies when he isn\u2019t fucking or getting drunk and high. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t sleep anymore. Maybe an hour a night. He\u2019s never tired, he even stopped drinking coffee. </p><p>\u201cPeter? Can I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up from his homework, smiling. \u201cHey, dad. What\u2019s up?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cMe and your mom are worried about you&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Peter says happily. He looks back to his homework. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you\u2019re&hellip; you\u2019re acting so differently. We\u2019re glad to see you so happy, but we\u2014we\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>Peter hums and looks up again. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Promise.\u201d He says. \u201cI even stopped cutting, I\u2019m more than fine! I\u2019ve never been-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou were cutting yourself?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice breaks. </p><p>Peter frowns. \u201cOh, oops. I wansnt supposed to tell you that. I forgot. It\u2019s okay! I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Tony gets closer. \u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>Peter stands. \u201cI promise! I\u2019m okay. Skip takes really good-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSkip? I thought you hated Skip?\u201d</p><p>Peter giggles. \u201cWell yeah, but that was when he was touching me and I didn\u2019t like it. I like it now though, so it\u2019s okay!\u201d He beams. \u201cHe takes really good care of me-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s 22.\u201d Tony whispers in horror. </p><p>Peter hums. \u201cYeah, so he can get me all my drinks and stuff.\u201d Peter giggles. \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Pepper, she\u2019ll be soooo mad.\u201d</p><p>Tony leans back, rubbing his face. \u201cAre you drunk right now?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cNope! I\u2019m still high though, although I\u2019m gonna crash soon. I need to get to Skip before 9:00 or he\u2019ll lock me out and won\u2019t give me any until tomorrow.\u201d He looks down, frowning at his hands. \u201cThat sucked that one time, don\u2019t wanna do that again.\u201d He mumbles. </p><p>Tony shakes in horror. \u201cWhy did you- why did you do all this?\u201d He asks, voice broken. \u201cWhy did you cut, why did you go to someone who hurt you, why did you do drugs-\u201c</p><p>Peter tears up now. He needs his new pill, it\u2019s getting harder to stay happy. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me anymore. You have a new baby. A new baby with your last name, who\u2019s your baby and not an adopted one. A miracle baby.\u201d He looks at his hands again. \u201cI- I\u2019m just waiting for you to get rid of me like grandma did. Why would you want stupid old me when you have a brand new baby?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Tony feels his heart break. He did this to Peter. He kept Peter\u2019s last name, in hopes that Peter <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> feel unwanted in the future, after finding out he\u2019s adopted after years and years of thinking he wasn\u2019t. He wanted to tell Peter right off, so he would know he was adopted, and that he was loved and wanted and god, it backfired spectacularly. He did all this. He made Peter-\u201c he shakes his head, standing. \u201cI\u2019m- stay here. Im going to get Pepper.\u201d He whispers. </p><p>When they come back, Peter is gone. </p><p>~</p><p>Peter stumbles in at 1:00 AM, giggling happily. He smiles when he sees his parents. \u201cHey!\u201d He says. \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t usually awake-\u201c </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going on a trip.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeals and claps his hands together. \u201cYay!\u201d He says. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes up, he\u2019s in a hospital. His mom is next to his bed, running her hands over his scars. His dad is in the hallway, on the phone. \u201cwhat-\u201c</p><p>Pepper looks up and Peter winces, seeing her red-rimmed eyes. \u201cOh, Peter!\u201d She hugs him. </p><p>Peter blinks. \u201cMom?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Pepper pulls back and sobs. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry we did this to you. You have- don\u2019t worry. You have so many therapy sessions, and you\u2019re going to be in the hospital until all the drugs are out of your system.\u201d</p><p>Peter pales and sits up. \u201cOh my god-\u201c</p><p>Pepper shakes her head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in trouble.\u201d She says, New Years forming in her eyes. \u201cMe and your dad were talking and\u2014we missed all the signs. All the calls for help, all the signals, all the times you explicitly asked for help and we didn\u2019t even see&hellip;\u201d She sobs, kissing his hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Peter. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks. \u201cI\u2019m so confused.\u201d He whispers. </p><p>Pepper kisses his hand again. \u201cWhat are you confused about, baby?\u201d</p><p>Peter winces at the terms. \u201cYou know? And I\u2019m not in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s our fault. We should have seen. We should have seen you needed us.\u201d She wipes away her own tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry we didn\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks and leans back. He falls asleep, letting the medicine work it\u2019s way through him. </p><p>~</p><p>A month later shows Skip Prescott in jail for a life sentence. They did a rape kit on Peter, and being 14, charged him with that. They also charged him with forcing Peter to drink alcohol and forcing him to use drugs. </p><p>Because whatever it is he gave Peter mixed with alcohol can kill a person, they also charged him with attempted murder. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how Tony got this trial started and done with in under a month, but he did. </p><p>Morgan will be here in 2 months now, and Peter is in therapy two days a week after school. </p><p>They work on Peter feeling loved, being wanted. Pepper and Tony put in so much effort, that Peter doesn\u2019t know how he ever bought they didn\u2019t want him. </p><p>Well, he does know. But he feels guilty about it. </p><p>When Morgan is born, Peter holds her in his arms. He smiles, and feels such love for his <i>baby sister</i>. \u201cMorgan Parker.\u201d He whispers, kissing her cheek. </p><p>He thinks it\u2019s dumb they\u2019re giving her his own last name; but they said \u201cwe want both our kids to have the same name. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p><p>So Peter is sober. He has a baby sister. His parents love him. Skip is in jail. </p><p>Peter feels like maybe it isn\u2019t hopeless after all. </p>",

What\u2019s up?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cMe and your mom are worried about you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Peter says happily. He looks back to his homework. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re acting so differently. We\u2019re glad to see you so happy, but we\u2014we\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>Peter hums and looks up again. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Promise.\u201d He says. \u201cI even stopped cutting, I\u2019m more than fine! I\u2019ve never been-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou were cutting yourself?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice breaks. </p><p>Peter frowns. \u201cOh, oops. I wansnt supposed to tell you that. I forgot. It\u2019s okay! I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Tony gets closer. \u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>Peter stands. \u201cI promise! I\u2019m okay. Skip takes really good-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSkip? I thought you hated Skip?\u201d</p><p>Peter giggles. \u201cWell yeah, but that was when he was touching me and I didn\u2019t like it. I like it now though, so it\u2019s okay!\u201d He beams. \u201cHe takes really good care of me-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s 22.\u201d Tony whispers in horror. </p><p>Peter hums. \u201cYeah, so he can get me all my drinks and stuff.\u201d Peter giggles. \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Pepper, she\u2019ll be soooo mad.\u201d</p><p>Tony leans back, rubbing his face. \u201cAre you drunk right now?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cNope! I\u2019m still high though, although I\u2019m gonna crash soon. I need to get to Skip before 9:00 or he\u2019ll lock me out and won\u2019t give me any until tomorrow.\u201d He looks down, frowning at his hands. \u201cThat sucked that one time, don\u2019t wanna do that again.\u201d He mumbles. </p><p>Tony shakes in horror. \u201cWhy did you- why did you do all this?\u201d He asks, voice broken. \u201cWhy did you cut, why did you go to someone who hurt you, why did you do drugs-\u201c</p><p>Peter tears up now. He needs his new pill, it\u2019s getting harder to stay happy. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me anymore. You have a new baby. A new baby with your last name, who\u2019s your baby and not an adopted one. A miracle baby.\u201d He looks at his hands again. \u201cI- I\u2019m just waiting for you to get rid of me like grandma did. Why would you want stupid old me when you have a brand new baby?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Tony feels his heart break. He did this to Peter. He kept Peter\u2019s last name, in hopes that Peter <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> feel unwanted in the future, after finding out he\u2019s adopted after years and years of thinking he wasn\u2019t. He wanted to tell Peter right off, so he would know he was adopted, and that he was loved and wanted and god, it backfired spectacularly. He did all this. He made Peter-\u201c he shakes his head, standing. \u201cI\u2019m- stay here. Im going to get Pepper.\u201d He whispers. </p><p>When they come back, Peter is gone. </p><p>~</p><p>Peter stumbles in at 1:00 AM, giggling happily. He smiles when he sees his parents. \u201cHey!\u201d He says. \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t usually awake-\u201c </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going on a trip.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeals and claps his hands together. \u201cYay!\u201d He says. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes up, he\u2019s in a hospital. His mom is next to his bed, running her hands over his scars. His dad is in the hallway, on the phone. \u201cwhat-\u201c</p><p>Pepper looks up and Peter winces, seeing her red-rimmed eyes. \u201cOh, Peter!\u201d She hugs him. </p><p>Peter blinks. \u201cMom?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Pepper pulls back and sobs. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry we did this to you. You have- don\u2019t worry. You have so many therapy sessions, and you\u2019re going to be in the hospital until all the drugs are out of your system.\u201d</p><p>Peter pales and sits up. \u201cOh my god-\u201c</p><p>Pepper shakes her head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in trouble.\u201d She says, New Years forming in her eyes. \u201cMe and your dad were talking and\u2014we missed all the signs. All the calls for help, all the signals, all the times you explicitly asked for help and we didn\u2019t even see\u2026\u201d She sobs, kissing his hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Peter. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks. \u201cI\u2019m so confused.\u201d He whispers. </p><p>Pepper kisses his hand again. \u201cWhat are you confused about, baby?\u201d</p><p>Peter winces at the terms. \u201cYou know? And I\u2019m not in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s our fault. We should have seen. We should have seen you needed us.\u201d She wipes away her own tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry we didn\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks and leans back. He falls asleep, letting the medicine work it\u2019s way through him. </p><p>~</p><p>A month later shows Skip Prescott in jail for a life sentence. They did a rape kit on Peter, and being 14, charged him with that. They also charged him with forcing Peter to drink alcohol and forcing him to use drugs. </p><p>Because whatever it is he gave Peter mixed with alcohol can kill a person, they also charged him with attempted murder. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how Tony got this trial started and done with in under a month, but he did. </p><p>Morgan will be here in 2 months now, and Peter is in therapy two days a week after school. </p><p>They work on Peter feeling loved, being wanted. Pepper and Tony put in so much effort, that Peter doesn\u2019t know how he ever bought they didn\u2019t want him. </p><p>Well, he does know. But he feels guilty about it. </p><p>When Morgan is born, Peter holds her in his arms. He smiles, and feels such love for his <i>baby sister</i>. \u201cMorgan Parker.\u201d He whispers, kissing her cheek. </p><p>He thinks it\u2019s dumb they\u2019re giving her his own last name; but they said \u201cwe want both our kids to have the same name. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p><p>So Peter is sober. He has a baby sister. His parents love him. Skip is in jail. </p><p>Peter feels like maybe it isn\u2019t hopeless after all. </p>",

His grandma was just too grief stricken after losing both her children to take any kind of proper care of him. </p><p>So Peter <i>Parker</i> got adopted by Tony Stark and Pepper Stark. </p><p>He never saw his grandma again. She\u2019s still alive, still working even. She\u2019s only seventy-something. She just wants nothing to do with him. Never reached out, never sent letters. Never sent pictures of him or his parents.</p><p>He grew up feeling unwanted by his grandma. By his parents, even though that isn\u2019t fair. And his adoptive parents\u2026 they kept his last name. They didn\u2019t change it. They always made it clear he was adopted, and that he wasn\u2019t their kid. </p><p>It\u2019s hard not to feel like they don\u2019t actually want him, when they make it clear so often that he isn\u2019t their kid. </p><p>So when they announce to him that they\u2019re pregnant\u2014it\u2019s a miracle!! A miracle, Peter, they said I would never get pregnant!!\u2014he falls deeper into a depression he\u2019s turned out to be very good at hiding. </p><p>This baby will be named Morgan <i>Stark</i>. Stark. Because they actually want this baby. They\u2019ll love this baby, be proud of this baby. </p><p>Peter started cutting the day they announced. </p><p>It\u2019s been three months since then, the baby being due in six. He cuts often. In the shower, before school. After he sees Tony kissing Pepper\u2019s stomach. After he sees them move all the baby things in. After he sees them go to doctors appointments. </p><p>He drinks every night, not that the Stark\u2019s notice. He goes to Skip\u2019s house, gets drunk off his ass, hopes Skip didn\u2019t touch him. Acknowledges that he probably does. Goes home still drunk, not that they notice. </p><p>At six months in, Skip gave him some pill. He didn\u2019t know what it was, and he didn\u2019t ask. He swallowed it, using whiskey to smooth the way. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what it is, but it makes him not care anymore. He stops cutting, because why would he? He\u2019s so happy now. He fucks Skip, because the fact that Skip is 22 and he\u2019s 14 doesn\u2019t send off any alarm bells. Or the fact that he hates Skip. He loves the man now! He keeps giving Peter the pills. He loves those pills! And sex is amazing, it feels so good. He loves sex. Skip is really good at it, he makes Peter cum like five times. It\u2019s so amazing, Peter doesn\u2019t know how he ever lived without it. </p><p>How sad is it, that they don\u2019t notice anything is wrong until he starts acting happier? </p><p>He walks around humming, dancing to no music. He gets better grades, because he studies when he isn\u2019t fucking or getting drunk and high. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t sleep anymore. Maybe an hour a night. He\u2019s never tired, he even stopped drinking coffee. </p><p>\u201cPeter? Can I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up from his homework, smiling. \u201cHey, dad. What\u2019s up?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cMe and your mom are worried about you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Peter says happily. He looks back to his homework. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re acting so differently. We\u2019re glad to see you so happy, but we\u2014we\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>Peter hums and looks up again. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Promise.\u201d He says. \u201cI even stopped cutting, I\u2019m more than fine! I\u2019ve never been-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou were cutting yourself?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice breaks. </p><p>Peter frowns. \u201cOh, oops. I wansnt supposed to tell you that. I forgot. It\u2019s okay! I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Tony gets closer. \u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>Peter stands. \u201cI promise! I\u2019m okay. Skip takes really good-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSkip?

I&rsquo;ve never been-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were cutting yourself?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice breaks. </p><p>Peter frowns. &ldquo;Oh, oops. I wansnt supposed to tell you that. I forgot. It&rsquo;s okay! I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gets closer. &ldquo;Peter-&ldquo;</p><p>Peter stands. &ldquo;I promise! I&rsquo;m okay. Skip takes really good-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Skip? I thought you hated Skip?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter giggles. &ldquo;Well yeah, but that was when he was touching me and I didn&rsquo;t like it. I like it now though, so it&rsquo;s okay!&rdquo; He beams. &ldquo;He takes really good care of me-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s 22.&rdquo; Tony whispers in horror. </p><p>Peter hums. &ldquo;Yeah, so he can get me all my drinks and stuff.&rdquo; Peter giggles. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Tell Pepper, she&rsquo;ll be soooo mad.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony leans back, rubbing his face. &ldquo;Are you drunk right now?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shakes his head. &ldquo;Nope! I&rsquo;m still high though, although I&rsquo;m gonna crash soon. I need to get to Skip before 9:00 or he&rsquo;ll lock me out and won&rsquo;t give me any until tomorrow.&rdquo; He looks down, frowning at his hands. &ldquo;That sucked that one time, don&rsquo;t wanna do that again.&rdquo; He mumbles. </p><p>Tony shakes in horror. &ldquo;Why did you- why did you do all this?&rdquo; He asks, voice broken. &ldquo;Why did you cut, why did you go to someone who hurt you, why did you do drugs-&ldquo;</p><p>Peter tears up now. He needs his new pill, it&rsquo;s getting harder to stay happy. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me anymore. You have a new baby. A new baby with your last name, who&rsquo;s your baby and not an adopted one. A miracle baby.&rdquo; He looks at his hands again. &ldquo;I- I&rsquo;m just waiting for you to get rid of me like grandma did. Why would you want stupid old me when you have a brand new baby?&rdquo; He asks. </p><p>Tony feels his heart break. He did this to Peter. He kept Peter&rsquo;s last name, in hopes that Peter <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> feel unwanted in the future, after finding out he&rsquo;s adopted after years and years of thinking he wasn&rsquo;t. He wanted to tell Peter right off, so he would know he was adopted, and that he was loved and wanted and god, it backfired spectacularly. He did all this. He made Peter-&ldquo; he shakes his head, standing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m- stay here. Im going to get Pepper.&rdquo; He whispers. </p><p>When they come back, Peter is gone. </p><p>~</p><p>Peter stumbles in at 1:00 AM, giggling happily. He smiles when he sees his parents. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;You guys aren&rsquo;t usually awake-&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going on a trip.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter squeals and claps his hands together. &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; He says. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes up, he&rsquo;s in a hospital. His mom is next to his bed, running her hands over his scars. His dad is in the hallway, on the phone. &ldquo;what-&ldquo;</p><p>Pepper looks up and Peter winces, seeing her red-rimmed eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Peter!&rdquo; She hugs him. </p><p>Peter blinks. &ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; He asks. </p><p>Pepper pulls back and sobs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. I&rsquo;m so sorry we did this to you. You have- don&rsquo;t worry. You have so many therapy sessions, and you&rsquo;re going to be in the hospital until all the drugs are out of your system.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter pales and sits up. &ldquo;Oh my god-&ldquo;</p><p>Pepper shakes her head. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t in trouble.&rdquo; She says, New Years forming in her eyes. &ldquo;Me and your dad were talking and&mdash;we missed all the signs. All the calls for help, all the signals, all the times you explicitly asked for help and we didn&rsquo;t even see&hellip;&rdquo; She sobs, kissing his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Peter. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter blinks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so confused.&rdquo; He whispers. </p><p>Pepper kisses his hand again. &ldquo;What are you confused about, baby?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter winces at the terms. &ldquo;You know? And I&rsquo;m not in trouble?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, baby, it&rsquo;s our fault. We should have seen. We should have seen you needed us.&rdquo; She wipes away her own tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry we didn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter blinks and leans back. He falls asleep, letting the medicine work it&rsquo;s way through him. </p><p>~</p><p>A month later shows Skip Prescott in jail for a life sentence. They did a rape kit on Peter, and being 14, charged him with that. They also charged him with forcing Peter to drink alcohol and forcing him to use drugs. </p><p>Because whatever it is he gave Peter mixed with alcohol can kill a person, they also charged him with attempted murder. </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t know how Tony got this trial started and done with in under a month, but he did. </p><p>Morgan will be here in 2 months now, and Peter is in therapy two days a week after school. </p><p>They work on Peter feeling loved, being wanted. Pepper and Tony put in so much effort, that Peter doesn&rsquo;t know how he ever bought they didn&rsquo;t want him. </p><p>Well, he does know. But he feels guilty about it. </p><p>When Morgan is born, Peter holds her in his arms. He smiles, and feels such love for his <i>baby sister</i>. &ldquo;Morgan Parker.&rdquo; He whispers, kissing her cheek. </p><p>He thinks it&rsquo;s dumb they&rsquo;re giving her his own last name; but they said &ldquo;we want both our kids to have the same name. It&rsquo;s only fair.&rdquo;</p><p>So Peter is sober. He has a baby sister. His parents love him. Skip is in jail. </p><p>Peter feels like maybe it isn&rsquo;t hopeless after all. </p>",

Tony doesn\u2019t make duds.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>The elevator arrived at their destination, the doors opening to reveal Natasha sitting on the couch with a book in her lap. She watched the three men walk in. \u201cWelcome back, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Nat,\u201d Clint returned, joining her on the couch.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Tony is?\u201d Steve asked her as he realized his and Bucky\u2019s boyfriend wasn\u2019t there to greet them.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him all day,\u201d she told him. \u201cI thought he was out saving the day with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with us.\u201d Clint put his feet up on the coffee table. \u201cReally could have used him though.\u201d</p><p>Steve turned to Bucky, the other man\u2019s brows drawn together as he frowned. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s still in there?\u201d</p><p>With a deep sigh, Bucky nodded. \u201cProbably. He probably hasn\u2019t even eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe doesn\u2019t realize we were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it might be that bad?\u201d Bucky murmured, frown worsening.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know until we get there.\u201d</p><p>The two gave a quick farewell to their friends before going back to the elevator once more, riding it down to the lab. The last time they spoke to Tony was hours before the mission came in, and at the time he had informed them he would only be doing small upgrades. It was now nearing eighteen hours since.</p><p>The doors opened to Tony\u2019s lab. At first they thought he might not be in there after all, but then they heard his voice coming from behind a new armor they hadn\u2019t seen before. It looked slimmer than past models, more like a second skin for the genius than what it really was. A second new armor, even less finished, sat lifelessly nearby, darkened eyes seeming to watch the men as they approached.</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>The genius paused his progress, peeking around the armor. \u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitten, what are you doing?\u201d Bucky gently questioned. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a small upgrade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony agreed, giving him a confused look. \u201cThis is the design I told you guys about earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, honey, we weren\u2019t here,\u201d Steve informed him, coming closer. \u201cWe were on a mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tony turned his attention to his stained hands as his lovers stopped by him. \u201cThat explains a bit. Guess I dreamed it. That\u2019s actually a relief.\u201d</p><p>Bucky sat on the floor beside him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome stuff that\u2026 really left a lasting impression. I believed it after not seeing you two again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you believe?\u201d Steve asked this time.</p><p>\u201cThat I was too much. That you guys were done.\u201d Tony sighed and ran a hand over his face, dark smudges marking his skin. \u201cThat you were tired of my anxiety over aliens and safety and that I was being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, kitten,\u201d Bucky said as he placed a hand on Tony\u2019s knee. \u201cWe\u2019re never gonna tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you ever think it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I honestly think you\u2019re brave for wanting to face them after what you saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice implied disbelief at Bucky\u2019s words, but he did look at him, hope shining in his coffee colored eyes.</p><p>\u201cI really do. I think you\u2019re very, very brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when it does happen, if it does happen, you won\u2019t be alone,\u201d Steve spoke up, getting Tony\u2019s attention next. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right beside you, always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it?\u201d Tony murmured.</p><p>\u201cI do, honey, I do.\u201d</p><p>Tony bit his lip. The dream had upset him so much. He knew he was hard to live with, that sometimes his fears would consume him. When he heard dream Steve and dream Bucky say that they had enough, well\u2026 of course he believed it. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time.</p><p>But to hear them now, he found what they told him difficult to believe. He loved them, wanted to believe they loved him too, but the idea that they wanted to stay seemed\u2026 strange.</p><p>\u201cTony? Kitten, you with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he assured with a shaky voice. \u201cYeah, with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love you, you know,\u201d Steve told him. \u201cYou won\u2019t chase us away so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Bucky chimed in. \u201cWe\u2019re staying right here, with you, always.\u201d</p><p>Staring at them both with eyes that stung with unshed tears, Tony whispered, \u201cReally? You really mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways with you. To the end of the line includes you too now, remember?\u201d</p><p>Tony sniffled. \u201cI love you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love you, Tony.\u201d</p>",
