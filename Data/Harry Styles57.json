I groan and roll over and come face to face with my cheekily smiling daughter. I looked at her confusingly and scanned my view in front of me.</p><p>&ldquo;Attack!&rdquo; I heard Harry scream as I felt streaks of cold water hit my skin.</p><p>I shriek and got out of bed hiding beside the bed. The girls rushed over to my side and sprayed me with the water guns in their hands. I stood up and opened my arms.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay I like showers,&rdquo; I screamed.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a shower siwwy!&rdquo; Emma giggled.</p><p>Harry tossed me a water gun and I caught it and began spraying the girls. They screamed in excitement and ran out of the room and down the stairs with Harry and I right behind them We chased them around the kitchen and continued to spray them. I slipped and fell onto Harry as we fell to the ground. I looked into his green eyes and I felt myself get lost in them the longer I starred. I tore away my stare and cleared my throat as I got up blushing.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that,&rdquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo;No biggie lovie,&rdquo; Harry said standing up smiling, &ldquo;Umm I was wondering if you&rsquo;d be able to pick Darcy up again today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was actually going to ask you the same thing, I have appointments with some clients all of today,&rdquo; I spoke chuckling as I got out the griddle to begin cooking brunch.</p><p>&ldquo;No biggie I&rsquo;ll ask my mum to pick the girls up.&rdquo; Harry smiled taking out his phone and began texting who I assumed was his mom.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure your mom will be okay with it?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;I can ask my friend Casey to pick Ava up.&rdquo;</p><p>Casey was a good friend of mine who stayed with me throughout my pregnancy. We rarely got to hang out or talk because of her busy schedule as a model but when I needed her most she was always there. Harry smiled at me and gave me a thumbs up. I smiled and mouthed to him to thank his mom for me. I began to cook us our late brunch as Harry turned on the radio and the girls began to dance to the music. I cooked waffles and sausage patties for a simple brunch. I fixed all of us a plate of food and set the table. Harry turned the radio down as we all took a seat at the table to eat and listen to the girls&rsquo; bizarre dreams as I studied Harry&rsquo;s home.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Harry asked taking a sip of his tea.</p><p>&ldquo;Just studying your home,&rdquo; I stated, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your budget to design your home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is none,&rdquo; Harry said bluntly, &ldquo;Whatever you think is best I&rsquo;m willing to pay whatever to have my ideal home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well okay then,&rdquo; I chuckled, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be my first client for the day then yeah? Is there a theme you were envisioning?&rdquo; I questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;Rustic maybe?&rdquo; Harry said, &ldquo;I really like the look of worn out wood.&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded already envisioning what I wanted to do with his home.</p><p>&ldquo;I want a pwetty purple woom with lots of mermaids.&rdquo; Emma chirped in.</p><p>&ldquo;I will keep that in mind little miss,&rdquo; I said smiling.</p><p>As we finished eating, Ava and Emma helped me clean off the table and we hung out I the living room for a while. Harry agreed to drop the girls off to ballet since I had to meet my first client around 2 and Harry didn&rsquo;t have to be at the studio until 5. I peppered Ava with kisses and gave her a big hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Be good for Mr. Harry,&rdquo; I said in between kisses.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, mummy okay!&rdquo; Ava giggled.</p><p>I said goodbye to Harry and gave Emma a hug before I left. I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a connection between Harry and I and how much easier it was to have him around.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s POV</p><p>I was finally left with Emma and Ava alone now. I haven&rsquo;t been left with both of them by myself till now. Brooke always had them and I appreciated everything she had done for me in the past 2 days. It felt weird having someone around. Ever since Carol passed away 3 years ago, it&rsquo;s always just been Emma and I.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Harry can we go out for ice cweam?&rdquo; Ava asked me softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course! Let&rsquo;s go get ready yeah?&rdquo; I smiled.</p><p>Ava looked just like her mother. Straight light brown hair and large light brown almost golden eyes. Emma and Ava ran off to get ready as I walked up the stairs into my room to get dressed. I slipped on my light tan sweater and light washed jeans and fixed my hair in the mirror a little before I made I way downstairs. I saw two tiny frames dressed in Emma&rsquo;s pink and purple tooled dresses.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we look beautiful daddy?&rdquo; Emma smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;You both look so beautiful.&rdquo; I smiled and I helped both girls put on their shoes.</p><p>I opened the door and stepped outside. I loved the neighborhood we lived in, everything was so close to where we lived.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we take the wagon today?&rdquo; I asked looking at the girls as they cheered with yeses.</p><p>I lifted the girls and set them into the wagon one by one. I held onto the wagon handle and began walking towards the ice cream shop. I listened to the girls as they pointed out things along the way.</p><p>&ldquo;Auntie Casey!&rdquo; I heard Ava shout. I watched as a tall slender woman with blonde hair wave at Ava. I let Ava out of the wagon, as Casey approached us.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey pumpkin!&rdquo; She said lifting Ava up and kissing her cheek, &ldquo;Hello, I&rsquo;m Casey.&rdquo; She said smiling at me and holding a hand out.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry.&rdquo; I said taking her soft hand in mine.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like we&rsquo;ve met.&rdquo; She said knitting her eyebrows together before her face lit up, &ldquo;Oh my god, the Victoria Secret runway show!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; I smiled as I remembered how she walked by me while I performed.</p><p>&ldquo;We should hang out later.&rdquo; She smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I can give you a ring when I leave the studio.&rdquo; I said handing her my phone.</p><p>She set Ava down in the wagon and typed in her number before handing me my phone back. She waved us bye before walking into a building and we made our way to the ice cream parlor. The rest of the day we spet eating ice cream and going to the park before I dropped the girls off at ballet and making my way to the studio myself.</p><p>Brooke&rsquo;s POV</p><p>It was a little after 8:30 in the evening now when I arrived to Harry&rsquo;s house. I stopped by my house to let our puppy out and pick up the cookies I made before I left for my appointments. I knocked on the door and as the door opened I was greeted by a lovely woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello love!&rdquo; She chirped, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Anne, Harry&rsquo;s mum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, I&rsquo;m Brooke Ava&rsquo;s mom.&rdquo; I smiled holding a hand out.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh none of that, I give out hugs.&rdquo; She laughed before embracing me in her arms.</p><p>I giggled as I hugged her back. I heard little feet shuffle across the hardwood floors and saw Emma peek over behind the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Nana.&rdquo; Emma whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh right,&rdquo; Anne said clearing her throat and grabbed the tray of cookies out of my hands, &ldquo;your waitresses await your presence.&rdquo; Anne spoke winking at me.</p><p>I chuckled walking into the entrance of the kitchen and was greeted by two girls in white button up shirts and black dress pants. Ava giggled and held my hand leading me to a table that was well lit by three candles in the center and plates on either side of the table.</p><p>&ldquo;What is all of this baby?&rdquo; I chuckled looking down at Ava.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a surpwise.&rdquo; Ava smiled before walking off somewhere.</p><p>I sat in silence confused as to what was happening. My thoughts were interrupted as the first door opened and I heard fits of laughter enter the house. Wanting to know what it was I made my way over to the front door and was greeted by Harry who had his pink lips against a tall woman&rsquo;s neck. I knew who it was exactly.</p><p>&ldquo;Casey?&rdquo; I croaked out. Both of their heads turning in my direction. Ava and Emma appeared from the kitchen and their eyes widened.</p><p>&ldquo;Brooke!&rdquo; Casey smiled, &ldquo;this is Harry, we met at the Victoria Secret runway show and we bumped into one another in the streets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; I said sucking in a breath of air.</p><p>I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t breathe or move. It&rsquo;s not like Harry was mine, I have no control over who he&rsquo;s with. But it pained me to see him with someone who wasn&rsquo;t me. I cleared my throat before I gathered my things and took Ava by the hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we should get going.&rdquo; I mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Bro-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you at dance practice tomorrow Harry,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>I picked Ava up and quickly made my way out the house and over to my home. I loved Casey but no matter what, she always got the guy. She was tall and beautiful who wouldn&rsquo;t want her. I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel my heart break as Ava and I got ready for bed. Were the feels mutual or was I the only one who fell for him?</p>",

I cooked waffles and sausage patties for a simple brunch. I fixed all of us a plate of food and set the table. Harry turned the radio down as we all took a seat at the table to eat and listen to the girls\u2019 bizarre dreams as I studied Harry\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Harry asked taking a sip of his tea.</p><p>\u201cJust studying your home,\u201d I stated, \u201cWhat\u2019s your budget to design your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is none,\u201d Harry said bluntly, \u201cWhatever you think is best I\u2019m willing to pay whatever to have my ideal home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell okay then,\u201d I chuckled, \u201cYou\u2019ll be my first client for the day then yeah? Is there a theme you were envisioning?\u201d I questioned.</p><p>\u201cRustic maybe?\u201d Harry said, \u201cI really like the look of worn out wood.\u201d</p><p>I nodded already envisioning what I wanted to do with his home.</p><p>\u201cI want a pwetty purple woom with lots of mermaids.\u201d Emma chirped in.</p><p>\u201cI will keep that in mind little miss,\u201d I said smiling.</p><p>As we finished eating, Ava and Emma helped me clean off the table and we hung out I the living room for a while. Harry agreed to drop the girls off to ballet since I had to meet my first client around 2 and Harry didn\u2019t have to be at the studio until 5. I peppered Ava with kisses and gave her a big hug.</p><p>\u201cBe good for Mr. Harry,\u201d I said in between kisses.</p><p>\u201cOkay, mummy okay!\u201d Ava giggled.</p><p>I said goodbye to Harry and gave Emma a hug before I left. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a connection between Harry and I and how much easier it was to have him around.</p><p>Harry\u2019s POV</p><p>I was finally left with Emma and Ava alone now. I haven\u2019t been left with both of them by myself till now. Brooke always had them and I appreciated everything she had done for me in the past 2 days. It felt weird having someone around. Ever since Carol passed away 3 years ago, it\u2019s always just been Emma and I.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harry can we go out for ice cweam?\u201d Ava asked me softly.</p><p>\u201cOf course! Let\u2019s go get ready yeah?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Ava looked just like her mother. Straight light brown hair and large light brown almost golden eyes. Emma and Ava ran off to get ready as I walked up the stairs into my room to get dressed. I slipped on my light tan sweater and light washed jeans and fixed my hair in the mirror a little before I made I way downstairs. I saw two tiny frames dressed in Emma\u2019s pink and purple tooled dresses.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we look beautiful daddy?\u201d Emma smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou both look so beautiful.\u201d I smiled and I helped both girls put on their shoes.</p><p>I opened the door and stepped outside. I loved the neighborhood we lived in, everything was so close to where we lived.</p><p>\u201cShall we take the wagon today?\u201d I asked looking at the girls as they cheered with yeses.</p><p>I lifted the girls and set them into the wagon one by one. I held onto the wagon handle and began walking towards the ice cream shop. I listened to the girls as they pointed out things along the way.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Casey!\u201d I heard Ava shout. I watched as a tall slender woman with blonde hair wave at Ava. I let Ava out of the wagon, as Casey approached us.</p><p>\u201cHey pumpkin!\u201d She said lifting Ava up and kissing her cheek, \u201cHello, I\u2019m Casey.\u201d She said smiling at me and holding a hand out.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d I said taking her soft hand in mine.</p><p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve met.\u201d She said knitting her eyebrows together before her face lit up, \u201cOh my god, the Victoria Secret runway show!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I smiled as I remembered how she walked by me while I performed.</p><p>\u201cWe should hang out later.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah I can give you a ring when I leave the studio.\u201d I said handing her my phone.</p><p>She set Ava down in the wagon and typed in her number before handing me my phone back. She waved us bye before walking into a building and we made our way to the ice cream parlor. The rest of the day we spet eating ice cream and going to the park before I dropped the girls off at ballet and making my way to the studio myself.</p><p>Brooke\u2019s POV</p><p>It was a little after 8:30 in the evening now when I arrived to Harry\u2019s house. I stopped by my house to let our puppy out and pick up the cookies I made before I left for my appointments. I knocked on the door and as the door opened I was greeted by a lovely woman.</p><p>\u201cHello love!\u201d She chirped, \u201cI\u2019m Anne, Harry\u2019s mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Brooke Ava\u2019s mom.\u201d I smiled holding a hand out.</p><p>\u201cOh none of that, I give out hugs.\u201d She laughed before embracing me in her arms.</p><p>I giggled as I hugged her back. I heard little feet shuffle across the hardwood floors and saw Emma peek over behind the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNana.\u201d Emma whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d Anne said clearing her throat and grabbed the tray of cookies out of my hands, \u201cyour waitresses await your presence.\u201d Anne spoke winking at me.</p><p>I chuckled walking into the entrance of the kitchen and was greeted by two girls in white button up shirts and black dress pants. Ava giggled and held my hand leading me to a table that was well lit by three candles in the center and plates on either side of the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat is all of this baby?\u201d I chuckled looking down at Ava.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surpwise.\u201d Ava smiled before walking off somewhere.</p><p>I sat in silence confused as to what was happening. My thoughts were interrupted as the first door opened and I heard fits of laughter enter the house. Wanting to know what it was I made my way over to the front door and was greeted by Harry who had his pink lips against a tall woman\u2019s neck. I knew who it was exactly.</p><p>\u201cCasey?\u201d I croaked out. Both of their heads turning in my direction. Ava and Emma appeared from the kitchen and their eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cBrooke!\u201d Casey smiled, \u201cthis is Harry, we met at the Victoria Secret runway show and we bumped into one another in the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I said sucking in a breath of air.</p><p>I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe or move. It\u2019s not like Harry was mine, I have no control over who he\u2019s with. But it pained me to see him with someone who wasn\u2019t me. I cleared my throat before I gathered my things and took Ava by the hand.</p><p>\u201cI think we should get going.\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cBro-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at dance practice tomorrow Harry,\u201d I said, \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>I picked Ava up and quickly made my way out the house and over to my home. I loved Casey but no matter what, she always got the guy. She was tall and beautiful who wouldn\u2019t want her. I couldn\u2019t help but feel my heart break as Ava and I got ready for bed. Were the feels mutual or was I the only one who fell for him?</p></p>",

Is there a theme you were envisioning?&rdquo; I questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;Rustic maybe?&rdquo; Harry said, &ldquo;I really like the look of worn out wood.&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded already envisioning what I wanted to do with his home.</p><p>&ldquo;I want a pwetty purple woom with lots of mermaids.&rdquo; Emma chirped in.</p><p>&ldquo;I will keep that in mind little miss,&rdquo; I said smiling.</p><p>As we finished eating, Ava and Emma helped me clean off the table and we hung out I the living room for a while. Harry agreed to drop the girls off to ballet since I had to meet my first client around 2 and Harry didn&rsquo;t have to be at the studio until 5. I peppered Ava with kisses and gave her a big hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Be good for Mr. Harry,&rdquo; I said in between kisses.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, mummy okay!&rdquo; Ava giggled.</p><p>I said goodbye to Harry and gave Emma a hug before I left. I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a connection between Harry and I and how much easier it was to have him around.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s POV</p><p>I was finally left with Emma and Ava alone now. I haven&rsquo;t been left with both of them by myself till now. Brooke always had them and I appreciated everything she had done for me in the past 2 days. It felt weird having someone around. Ever since Carol passed away 3 years ago, it&rsquo;s always just been Emma and I.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Harry can we go out for ice cweam?&rdquo; Ava asked me softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course! Let&rsquo;s go get ready yeah?&rdquo; I smiled.</p><p>Ava looked just like her mother. Straight light brown hair and large light brown almost golden eyes. Emma and Ava ran off to get ready as I walked up the stairs into my room to get dressed. I slipped on my light tan sweater and light washed jeans and fixed my hair in the mirror a little before I made I way downstairs. I saw two tiny frames dressed in Emma&rsquo;s pink and purple tooled dresses.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we look beautiful daddy?&rdquo; Emma smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;You both look so beautiful.&rdquo; I smiled and I helped both girls put on their shoes.</p><p>I opened the door and stepped outside. I loved the neighborhood we lived in, everything was so close to where we lived.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we take the wagon today?&rdquo; I asked looking at the girls as they cheered with yeses.</p><p>I lifted the girls and set them into the wagon one by one. I held onto the wagon handle and began walking towards the ice cream shop. I listened to the girls as they pointed out things along the way.</p><p>&ldquo;Auntie Casey!&rdquo; I heard Ava shout. I watched as a tall slender woman with blonde hair wave at Ava. I let Ava out of the wagon, as Casey approached us.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey pumpkin!&rdquo; She said lifting Ava up and kissing her cheek, &ldquo;Hello, I&rsquo;m Casey.&rdquo; She said smiling at me and holding a hand out.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry.&rdquo; I said taking her soft hand in mine.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like we&rsquo;ve met.&rdquo; She said knitting her eyebrows together before her face lit up, &ldquo;Oh my god, the Victoria Secret runway show!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; I smiled as I remembered how she walked by me while I performed.</p><p>&ldquo;We should hang out later.&rdquo; She smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I can give you a ring when I leave the studio.&rdquo; I said handing her my phone.</p><p>She set Ava down in the wagon and typed in her number before handing me my phone back. She waved us bye before walking into a building and we made our way to the ice cream parlor. The rest of the day we spet eating ice cream and going to the park before I dropped the girls off at ballet and making my way to the studio myself.</p><p>Brooke&rsquo;s POV</p><p>It was a little after 8:30 in the evening now when I arrived to Harry&rsquo;s house. I stopped by my house to let our puppy out and pick up the cookies I made before I left for my appointments. I knocked on the door and as the door opened I was greeted by a lovely woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello love!&rdquo; She chirped, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Anne, Harry&rsquo;s mum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, I&rsquo;m Brooke Ava&rsquo;s mom.&rdquo; I smiled holding a hand out.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh none of that, I give out hugs.&rdquo; She laughed before embracing me in her arms.</p><p>I giggled as I hugged her back. I heard little feet shuffle across the hardwood floors and saw Emma peek over behind the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Nana.&rdquo; Emma whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh right,&rdquo; Anne said clearing her throat and grabbed the tray of cookies out of my hands, &ldquo;your waitresses await your presence.&rdquo; Anne spoke winking at me.</p><p>I chuckled walking into the entrance of the kitchen and was greeted by two girls in white button up shirts and black dress pants. Ava giggled and held my hand leading me to a table that was well lit by three candles in the center and plates on either side of the table.</p><p>&ldquo;What is all of this baby?&rdquo; I chuckled looking down at Ava.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a surpwise.&rdquo; Ava smiled before walking off somewhere.</p><p>I sat in silence confused as to what was happening. My thoughts were interrupted as the first door opened and I heard fits of laughter enter the house. Wanting to know what it was I made my way over to the front door and was greeted by Harry who had his pink lips against a tall woman&rsquo;s neck. I knew who it was exactly.</p><p>&ldquo;Casey?&rdquo; I croaked out. Both of their heads turning in my direction. Ava and Emma appeared from the kitchen and their eyes widened.</p><p>&ldquo;Brooke!&rdquo; Casey smiled, &ldquo;this is Harry, we met at the Victoria Secret runway show and we bumped into one another in the streets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; I said sucking in a breath of air.</p><p>I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t breathe or move. It&rsquo;s not like Harry was mine, I have no control over who he&rsquo;s with. But it pained me to see him with someone who wasn&rsquo;t me. I cleared my throat before I gathered my things and took Ava by the hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we should get going.&rdquo; I mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Bro-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you at dance practice tomorrow Harry,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>I picked Ava up and quickly made my way out the house and over to my home. I loved Casey but no matter what, she always got the guy. She was tall and beautiful who wouldn&rsquo;t want her. I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel my heart break as Ava and I got ready for bed. Were the feels mutual or was I the only one who fell for him?</p></p>",
