        "question": "That clip made me briefly entertain the idea that he doesn't mind/he WANTS his audience to treat him like some of us do, what do you think? was that just a slip up? was that just him being a bit of a hypocrite? what happened there?",
        "answer": "<p>I think he was being a bit of a hypocrite, but I also don\u2019t think he was thinking that deeply about what he was saying, just trying to be #relatable to his audience and saying something he knew would get attention. That\u2019s just who Dan is and has always been. I don\u2019t think we can or should read into anything here as far as how he wants to be treated by fans because he didn\u2019t say anything about himself directly and made it very clear he didn\u2019t relate to the 1D band members. </p>",

I nodded before giggling and searching for our bedroom door through the darkness. Feeling the slight engravings in the wood, I found my way to the doorknob before grabbing Dan and making my way inside.</p><p>Dan pushed me lightly onto the bed, climbing quietly on top of me. &ldquo;I love you so, so much,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;You really deserve the world.&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;And trust me, one day, I&rsquo;ll give it to you.&rdquo; </p><p>Me, being way too emotional, a tear rolled down my cheek. Dan leaned down and kissed it away before lightly moving to my lips. The calm, delicate kiss became hungered like a lion feasting on its prey within seconds. Dan&rsquo;s hands moved slowly from my cheeks and roamed my body before stationing at my hips, gripping them tightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Is this okay?&rdquo; Dan whispered onto my neck, &ldquo;Because, I mean, if it isn&rsquo;t we can totally stop. It&rsquo;s not like either of us need this and if you think you don&rsquo;t want it-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, it&rsquo;s okay, Daniel.&rdquo; I laughed a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p><p>His large hands moved to the first button of my blouse, unbuttoning it agonizingly slowly. I pushed his hands away and unbuttoned it for him, eager to get started.</p><p>After I had finished I reached down to the seam of his tee shirt, pulling it over his flawless shoulders. I stopped, admiring his toned chest and light abs, before letting my fingers drop to the hem of his grey sweatpants. I pulled them down so they lingered just below his knee as he did the same to me. I had never done anything like this before, but I loved Dan and I felt as if if it didn&rsquo;t happen now, it couldn&rsquo;t happen ever. I pulled my shorts the rest of the way off along with my panties, suddenly completely bare under Dan. </p><p>Feeling slightly insecure, I nudged him signaling him to finish removing his clothing as well. He did, swiftly, before leaning down and capturing me in a fierce kiss, our tongues only slightly bumping but with more meaning than imaginable. As we pulled apart to admire the other Dan flipped us over so I was on top. I sat lightly on his chest before instinctively checking behind me. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my God, Dan. You&rsquo;re still wearing your fucking shoes,&rdquo; I inhaled slowly. \u201cSeriously, what a turnoff! How could we not notice?&ldquo; I laughed, slightly embarrassed. </p><p>&quot;Are you serious, Y/N?&rdquo; Dan looked over my shoulder at his feet to see his white Vans were still tied neatly. He chuckled to himself before reaching around me and pulling them off. &ldquo;Imagine how stupid I just looked! Completely naked and I&rsquo;m still wearing trainers,&rdquo; he whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, pretty stupid. Better now though.&rdquo; I smiled, looking at Dan again. &ldquo;Shall we resume?&rdquo; I leaned down, grazing his lips delicately. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Dan said frantically, pushing me off of him before leaning over to his bedside drawer. He rummaged through it for a few seconds before turning to me, a look of aggravation displayed on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a condom?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a condom.&rdquo;</p><p>A moment of silence. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to go to CVS and get some? I totally can,&rdquo; Dan said before pausing, &ldquo;Not that we need to.&rdquo;</p><p>I breathed out a long sigh. &ldquo;No. At this point, I just want to sleep. Sorry Babe,&rdquo; I whispered tiredly before curling into Dan&rsquo;s chest underneath the blankets. Seriously, everything is trying to be a cockblock. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he said soothingly before wrapping his arms around me. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and Dan? You remember what you said about giving me the world?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Duh, Y/N, that was like twenty minutes ago.

For example, I watch Game of Thrones (although I\u2019m not involved in the fandom) and consider myself \u201canti\u201d JonSa (I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called), which is the ship for Jon Snow and Sansa Stark. GoT is a fictional work and Jon and Sansa are characters, so I have no problem saying I think that is an awful ship and if they end up together in the end, I will be annoyed. On the other hand, Dan and Phil are real people, who I like and wish well. If Dan posted a video today and said, \u201cPhil and I are involved in a romantic relationship and I\u2019m really happy,\u201d my reaction would be, \u201cWow, that\u2019s great, I\u2019m so happy for you!\u201d Unless he was dating someone I absolutely hated, I would have the same reaction to him saying he was happily in a relationship with any person.</p><p>The idea of Dan and Phil being involved romantically or sexually doesn\u2019t appeal to me in any emotional or sexual way like it does to some people, but it also doesn\u2019t repulse me or anger me. There was a time when I was curious about Dan\u2019s sexuality, when I first started interacting with the phandom, but otherwise it\u2019s just not something that I  spend time thinking about, worrying about, or trying to figure out. The one thing I can say for sure is that he\u2019s not sleeping with me, so whatever he does in his private life is just none of my business because it really doesn\u2019t have to have any effect on my life (it affects some people because they choose to let it and thats entirely on them). In fact, I actually enjoy watching his content a lot more without all of that noise because then I\u2019m just focusing on the video itself and not filled with anxiety, trying to pick apart everything he says of trying to predict how others will interpret it. I feel the same when it comes to joint content. </p><p>I\u2019m an \u201canti\u201d is because I think shipping in the phandom often crosses the line into tinhatting. We don\u2019t know Dan and Phil. We interact with their personas via content they put out on social media. Until Dan and Phil explicitly state their sexualities and relationship statuses, saying that they are gay/straight/bi/queer and/or in a relationship is perpetuating a conspiracy theory. Saying that Dan and Phil are dropping hints or trying to communicate with us covertly in any way is using one of the staple rationalizations that any conspiracy theorists use to try to back up their claims and justify the lengths they go to. Shipping doesn\u2019t need to involve conspiracy theories; many shippers in many fandoms just like the idea of a pairing and hope it is real or becomes real and leave it at that. It becomes tinhatting when you start believing something that hasn\u2019t been confirmed is real and trying to prove it to yourself and other people and it leads to entitlement, stalking, objectification, sexual harassment, accusations and aggression towards those who are shipped and the people around them, and a lot of other negative stuff, all of which I am firmly against. I also think there are some issues with how \u201cphan\u201d is portrayed, romanticizing codependency, and things like that, but the main reason I\u2019m an anti is the tinhatting. I think the most important thing any of can do to support Dan and Phil is to respect their privacy and their rights to define themselves how they want in and in their own words. </p><p>Hopefully this answers your questions somewhat clearly. Feel free to send me any follow-up questions. I have such a hard time cutting down all the things I want to say to an appropriate length for tumblr and was trying hard to here, so I didn\u2019t really get a chance to touch on it in the rest of my reply, but I definitely agree that there are more types of love than just romantic or sexual love and all should be celebrated equally! </p>",
