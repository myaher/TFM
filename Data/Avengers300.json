What happened to dad?\u201d He\nstands up, taking the flashlight off of his head, tossing it to the side of his\nlab table.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDad is overprotective, and unreasonable. Tony\nhas fun once in awhile, and is encouraging.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201c<i>You know why we stay up in this tower</i>?\u201d\nHe questions in an almost angry tone. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cUmm, Hydra?\u201d His eyes shoot towards you like\ndaggers. \u201cHydra this, Hydra that. It\u2019s always about Hydra.\u201d His jaw clenches,\nhis anger slowly seeping to the surface. Maybe that was too far. Even so, you\nroll your eyes, knowing what he wants to hear. \u201cIt\u2019s to keep me safe. <i>I know\nbut</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201c<i>That&rsquo;s right, to keep you safe and sound,\ndear.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me locked up in the penthouse\nforever.

That was the name he gave himself when the kids at school\nmade fun of you. I\u2019ll be your mom <i>and</i> your dad, he said. When you need\nadvice and protection, mom it is. When it\u2019s time to hit the books and learn,\nwell, that\u2019s where cool dad takes over.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDid she? I think when she left me here, she\nthought I would \u2018grow up\u2019 under the great \u2018Stark\u2019 name, and have a better shot\nat life.

What are his feelings, do I need to speak to\nhim?\u201d<i><br/></i></p><p>\u00a0That was the last thing you wanted. They had\njust started speaking again after the whole division of the teams. Although,\nthis may bring them closer, them fighting together for a common goal. You\ndefinitely didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>\u00a0<i>\u201c</i>Sure, why not<i>, you&rsquo;ll just upset me </i>in the end, too<i>.\u201d</i></p><p>_________</p><p>\u00a0<i>Mother&rsquo;s right here</i></p><p><i>\nMother will protect you<br/><br/></i><i>\u201cDarling, here&rsquo;s what I\nsuggest, Skip the drama. </i>Go out and have a\nmovie night, gossip about\u2026 boys and such.

Better yet, stay in with the girls, eat popcorn and\nsnacks, give each other pedicures, or whatever it is you girls do these days.\nJust be safe, here. We can even hang out in the lab if you want.\u201d<i><br/></i></p><p>\u00a0\u201cThe girls are on a mission, because that is\nwhat \u2018they do\u2019 these days, which is where I would be if you would let me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0<i>Stay with mama</i></p><p><i>\nMother knows best<br/><br/></i><i>\u201c</i>You know what, fine<i>.

I didn\u2019t ask for this life, it was thrust upon me.\nHow can I not want to grow up and do this? All my life, I just wanted to be\nlike my dad. Don\u2019t you get that?

Everything he says, every\nreason he gives you. He\u2019s right, and I have to agree with him. I don\u2019t want you\nout there with us. It\u2019s to dangerous.

There is always an accident.\nSomeone always comes back hurt, or worse, almost dead, on every damn mission!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt was a stray bullet from one of our own.

You grimace in pain.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou know what kiddo, you\u2019re right, life\u2019s not\nfair. It wasn\u2019t fair that I had a shit father growing up, it wasn\u2019t fair that\nyour mother dropped a kid at my doorstep, and it\u2019s not fair that I have to deal\nwith this shit with you right now! So, no, life\u2019s not fair, and the sooner you\nget that through your thick head, the sooner\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0The monitors around you begin to scream out, as\nyour pulse drops, pressures tank, and your thigh begins to pulsate, blood\nsoaking through you bandages.

Keep holding, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Tony watches the monitor, counting every beat of\nyour heart, analyzing numbers, checking each stat individually. He\u2019s so hyper\nfocused on your vitals that he doesn\u2019t notice you reaching for his hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTony.\u201d Steve calls to him and his voice seems\nlike it\u2019s a distant sound, barely recognizable in his head. \u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He breaks concentration for a second, and\nwatches Steve signal towards you. Your hand so fragile, reaching out for your\nfather, unable to see him, but his presence known.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>__________</p><p>\u00a0He sat by your bed for two days, refusing to\nsleep, eat, speak, until he knew you were safe.</p><p>\u00a0Your face pale, your body weak. You open your\neyes to a bright light above your head, an incessant beeping to the left of\nyou, and the feel of tape ripping skin off of your hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHi.\u201d Is all he says, his eyes filling with\ntears, as he lifts your tiny hand to his lips.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, daddy.\u201d Tears make their way down\nto your cheeks, as he rubs his free hand through your hair.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it. Any of it. I\nwas just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI know. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sorry I pushed you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI thought I was going to lose you. I heard the\nflatline, and all I could see\u2026\u201d He rubs his eyes, and looks up at the ceiling,\ntrying to collect his thoughts. \u201cI just saw you, my little girl, in her\nbassinet, just holding onto my pinky. So little, so fragile. My entire\nlife\u2026you\u2019re all I have. You\u2019re the only thing that I ever let in. I almost lost\nit all, and all I could think of, was that you were going to die, and the last\nthing I said to you, was that I didn\u2019t want you. I could have never lived with\nmyself if you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d You squeeze his\nhands, coughing a bit from your dry throat.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI know you didn\u2019t, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0You\nwatch, as another stream of tears fall from his eyes. \u201cBut hear me out, okay?<i>\nAll I have is one request.</i> My beautiful<i>, Rapunzel?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon&rsquo;t ever ask to leave this tower again.\u201d You both huff out a small sigh, the\nsimplest of smiles grace both your mouths. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, mother.\u201d </i>You nod at him.

It\u2019s always about Hydra.\u201d His jaw clenches,\nhis anger slowly seeping to the surface. Maybe that was too far.

So little, so fragile. My entire\nlife\u2026you\u2019re all I have. You\u2019re the only thing that I ever let in. I almost lost\nit all, and all I could think of, was that you were going to die, and the last\nthing I said to you, was that I didn\u2019t want you.

It was your favorite fairy tail,\nand you always pretended you were her during playtime. It was cute when you\nwere young, you loved it. Now, it\u2019s just a reminder that Tony will always treat\nyou like a child.</i></p><p>\u00a0<i>\u201cLook at you, as fragile as\na flower, still a little sapling, just a sprout.\u201d \u00a0</i>He taps your head with his palm, condescendingly before turning\nback to his work.</p><p>\u201cTony! Please, I\u2019m not fifteen anymore, I\u2019m an\nadult, and I\u2019ve been training for years. I can\u2019t stay in the tower on light\nduty anymore. I\u2019m going out of my mind.\u201d<i><br></i></p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh, so it\u2019s Tony now? What happened to dad?\u201d He\nstands up, taking the flashlight off of his head, tossing it to the side of his\nlab table.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDad is overprotective, and unreasonable. Tony\nhas fun once in awhile, and is encouraging.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201c<i>You know why we stay up in this tower</i>?\u201d\nHe questions in an almost angry tone. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cUmm, Hydra?\u201d His eyes shoot towards you like\ndaggers. \u201cHydra this, Hydra that. It\u2019s always about Hydra.\u201d His jaw clenches,\nhis anger slowly seeping to the surface. Maybe that was too far. Even so, you\nroll your eyes, knowing what he wants to hear. \u201cIt\u2019s to keep me safe. <i>I know\nbut</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201c<i>That\u2019s right, to keep you safe and sound,\ndear.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me locked up in the penthouse\nforever. It\u2019s not normal. Please, Tony\u2026 dad.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0<i>\u201cGuess, I always knew this\nday was coming. Knew that soon you\u2019d want to leave the nest.\u201d </i>He approaches you cautiously.</p><p>\u00a0He holds your arms, looking deep into your eyes.\nHe was once you, and he knows what it\u2019s like to feel the overwhelming need to\nprove your worth. To make a name for yourself, and to not <i>just</i> be the\n\u201cchild of a genius.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0<i>\u201cSoon, but not yet.\u201d </i>He can\u2019t do it.

That was the name he gave himself when the kids at school\nmade fun of you. I\u2019ll be your mom <i>and</i> your dad, he said. When you need\nadvice and protection, mom it is. When it\u2019s time to hit the books and learn,\nwell, that\u2019s where cool dad takes over.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDid she?

What are his feelings, do I need to speak to\nhim?\u201d<i><br></i></p><p>\u00a0That was the last thing you wanted. They had\njust started speaking again after the whole division of the teams. Although,\nthis may bring them closer, them fighting together for a common goal. You\ndefinitely didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>\u00a0<i>\u201c</i>Sure, why not<i>, you\u2019ll just upset me </i>in the end, too<i>.\u201d</i></p><p>_________</p><p>\u00a0<i>Mother\u2019s right here</i></p><p><i>\nMother will protect you<br><br></i><i>\u201cDarling, here\u2019s what I\nsuggest, Skip the drama. </i>Go out and have a\nmovie night, gossip about\u2026 boys and such.

So little, so fragile. My entire\nlife\u2026you\u2019re all I have. You\u2019re the only thing that I ever let in.

He&rsquo;s so hyper\nfocused on your vitals that he doesn&rsquo;t notice you reaching for his hand.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; Steve calls to him and his voice seems\nlike it&rsquo;s a distant sound, barely recognizable in his head. &ldquo;Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He breaks concentration for a second, and\nwatches Steve signal towards you. Your hand so fragile, reaching out for your\nfather, unable to see him, but his presence known.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my girl.&rdquo;</p><p>__________</p><p>&nbsp;He sat by your bed for two days, refusing to\nsleep, eat, speak, until he knew you were safe.</p><p>&nbsp;Your face pale, your body weak. You open your\neyes to a bright light above your head, an incessant beeping to the left of\nyou, and the feel of tape ripping skin off of your hand.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; Is all he says, his eyes filling with\ntears, as he lifts your tiny hand to his lips.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, daddy.&rdquo; Tears make their way down\nto your cheeks, as he rubs his free hand through your hair.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry.

You snicker as you get out from under the table and flour falls around because Sam has dropped his pile of flower in shock. You make your way behind Sam as he is still trying to get flour off his face and out of your hair. </p><p><br/></p><p>You throw your last pile of flour at the back of Sams head and he whips around to face you. \u201cOh you\u2019re gonna regret that.\u201d He threats, trying to sound intimidating but the smile forming on his face is a clear indicator that he doesn\u2019t totally mean it.</p><p><br/></p><p>You turn to run out of the kitchen but Sam lunges forward and wraps his arms around your stomach, picking you up and you let out a squeal of surprise as you feel your self being lift up into the air. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d You screech as you burst into a fit of giggles as he begins to tickle your stomach as he places your feet back of the floor.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cP-please stop! I\u2019m go-gonna die!\u201d You try to get out and he laughs at your expense. \u201cNot until you admit that chocolate cake is better!\u201d He sung. \u201cOk ok! Chocolate cake is better!\u201d You let out reluctantly.</p><p><br/></p><p>His fingers stop attacking your sides and he lets you slump down onto the kitchen floor as you wheeze trying to catch your breath. \u201cYou are the&hellip; worst&hellip;. person&hellip; ever.\u201d You manage to get out between taking big gulps of air. \u201cI know.\u201d Sam chuckles, moving away from you and standing next to Natasha who was watching the whole scene play out in front of her with an amused expression.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell while you two were having your little fight over there I finished the cake and put it in the oven.\u201d Natasha informs and your eyes drift over to the oven from your viewpoint on the floor and you could see that she did in fact have the cake in the oven. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOk well now that it\u2019s done I\u2019m gonna go.\u201d Sam begins to walk towards the kitchen door and Natasha calls him back. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t think so Bird Boy. You\u2019re going to stay here and clean up this mess while I prepare the icing.\u201d Natasha chimes and Sam begins to protest but stops the minute she shoots him a glare and instead he begins to mumbles profanities under his breath as he goes to get the vacuum.</p><p><br/></p><p>You let out a giggle as you pick yourself up from the floor and dust off your body to make sure there is no flour on you.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou need my help with anything Nat? Maybe with the 100 candles that you\u2019re going to have to put on that cake?\u201d You question and she shakes her head.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019ll be ok. Go find your man Bucky and help him put up all those decorations.\u201d Natasha winks and you let out a squeak, afraid that someone might of heard her.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my man.\u201d You protest weakly and she rolls her eyes.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe so but you know you want him to be.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You ignore her comment as you exit the room. Natasha was right. You did want bucky to be \u201cyour Man\u201d but it\u2019s not like you would ever admit that to him though. It had taken a while for you to gain Bucky\u2019s trust and for him to open up to you about his past and you didn\u2019t want to throw your friendship away all because you had a stupid crush. In saying that though, you still couldn\u2019t help it when butterflies erupt in your stomach at the sound of his voice and you somehow weren\u2019t able to stop your heartbeat from picking up when you catch him smiling at you.</p><p><br/></p><p>You make your way around the compound looking for Bucky since he was no longer in the living room, for some reason leaving it only half decorated. You find him in the hallway that leads away from the front door Avengers tower.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey there Soldier, you alright?\u201d You ask as you come up behind him and his shoulders tense when he hears your voice.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Bucky replies shortly and focuses his attention back onto decorating the walls with colourful streamers.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI noticed that you only decorated half of the living room. Did something happen?\u201d Your voice is laid with worry as you place a gentle hand on his bicep that is closer to you, which so happens to be his prosthetic one, and he moves his arm away, letting your hand drop back to your side.</p><p><br/></p><p>Your eyes are filled with worry but he doesn\u2019t look back at you to see the reaction his action had caused. </p><p><br/></p><p>You were always allowed to touch his metal arm. Never once had he objected or stated that he was uncomfortable, no matter how many times you asked him if he was sure.</p><p><br/></p><p>You cast your eyes downward, thinking that whatever\u2019s happening with Bucky is your fault and you ignore the aching in your chest as you reach down to grab a streamer to help him put them up. </p><p><br/></p><p>A tense silence fills the hall as you both work quietly to put up the decorations as soon as possible. </p><p><br/></p><p>Bucky internally sighs, knowing that it\u2019s his fault as to why there is no conversation flowing between you both. The Winter Soldier keeps sneaking glances at your figure that is standing further up the hall. \u00a0He takes in your slouched shoulders and the hair that is acting as a shield around your face. He realises that he hurt you but he begins to feel some regret before it\u2019s clouded over by anger and jealousy at the thought of you laughing and having fun with Sam.</p><p><br/></p><p>As you both make your way up the hall, Bucky occasionally barking order at you as to where to put the streamers. Tears begin to form in your eyes at the realisation that you might be losing Bucky but you quickly push that idea out of your head. You wouldn\u2019t let that happen. You couldn\u2019t lose Bucky when he was the only thing keeping you here.</p><p><br/></p><p>When Tony Stark had asked you to join the Avengers you were hesitant as your powers could be used for bad things but you reluctantly agreed once he had pointed out that they could also be used for good. The first few weeks at the compound were long and hard. You had training nearly everyday and you were trying to make friends with your team and you eventually got tired of trying to juggle all these things at once. But then Steve introduced Bucky and you had found a reason to stay. Not only do you have someone in the compound that you could relate to because of your past with HYDRA but you also had made a new friend almost immediately and Bucky made you feel safe and wanted, even on your worst days.</p><p><br/></p><p>By the time you had both made your way back to the living room, all the decorations were hung up besides a golden banner that read \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 with the number 100 underneath it added by Natasha in neat writing.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat needs to go high up on the wall!\u201d Wanda instructs as she quickly makes her way past with a bunch of balloons going in her hands as she heads outside the room.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to reach that high. You\u2019re going to need to go on my shoulders.\u201d Bucky says lowly and you mumble an \u201cok\u201d under your breath as you make your way over to him.</p><p><br/></p><p>He puts his arms out and you jump onto his back and begin to climb up onto his broad shoulders like you had done many times before when you guys were playing around. Your heart tugs painfully at the memory but you push it away like last time and continue to get the job done.</p><p><br/></p><p>He hands you the large banner and you hold it in your grasp as he makes his way to the left side of the wall. You let the other side fall from your hands as you hold the banner up to the wall with glue tact stuck to the corners of it. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs this high enough?\u201d You snapper and it came out harsher then you attended. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cPut it higher.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>You do as he asks and you bring your arms up further. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs this alright your majesty?\u201d You taunt and he growls out a yes as you stick it to the wall before pulling the right side into your hands as he makes his way over in that direction.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cStretch it out more so it\u2019s smooth.\u201d Bucky grumbles and you do as your told with a roll of your eyes.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tapping his head gently as a signal to put you down, Bucky lowers you to the floor but not as delicately as usual.</p><p><br/></p><p>Anger bubbles in your chest as you\u2019ve begin to get fed up with Bucky\u2019s attitude.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d You say, hurt evident in your voice. \u201cWhy are you so moody all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Guilt begins to wash over Bucky as he realises that he\u2019s hurting you but all that comes out of his mouth is, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMy fault?\u201d You exclaim, your voice raising a few octaves.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s your fault!\u201d Bucky barks even though he doesn\u2019t mean it. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, he is jealous.</p><p><br/></p><p>Suddenly all the lights in the compound switch off and Sam quickly makes his way over to you both. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s coming, get into position.\u201d He whispers and you nod in understanding quickly ducking behind the couch with Bucky \u00a0in the middle of you and Sam.</p><p><br/></p><p>Footsteps begin to get closer to the living room but you refuse to let go of your argument with Bucky. \u201cI didn\u2019t even do anything wrong.\u201d You quietly hiss in his direction and he practically hear him rolling his eyes as he clamps his metal hand over your mouth.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cKeep your mouth shut and we won\u2019t get caught.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cJust make her shut up.\u201d Sam interrupts and before you know what\u2019s happening, Bucky is being pushed towards you.</p><p><br/></p><p>Your lips collide with his and it\u2019s like gasoline and vodka have finally met a lit match, creating an explosion of emotions erupt in your stomach. You\u2019re both frozen for a second before he gently brings his metal hand up to cup your cheek. The cold metal brings your brain back to its senses and you begin to respond, slowly kissing Bucky back. The kiss in gentle and sweet and when you finally pull away from each other you\u2019re out breath and staring at him with wide eyes.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBut\u2014 you\u2014 I thought\u2014\u201c Your rambling was cut off when the lights were switched on and a bunch of bodies moved around you to jump up.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d Everyone screams to Steve and you can hear his laugh enter the room as you slowly get up, mumbling a weak \u201csurprise\u201d.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHappy birthday Steve!\u201d You giggle, momentarily forgetting what happened with Bucky, and give him a kiss on the cheek as he comes forward and wraps his arms around you in a bear hug.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThanks sweetheart.\u201d He kisses your forehead before moving on to other people as they congratulate him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d Bucky asks as he comes to stand beside you after sharing a hug with Steve and cracking a few jokes about his old age.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d You mumble, blushing as you remember the kiss you had shared with the soldier moments before.</p><p><br/></p><p>His hand gently incloses around your forearm as he brings you outside into the\u00a0hallway.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI know I was a dickhead.\u201d He begins and you snort, \u201cI hope you\u2019re not expecting me to deny that.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He replies as a smile begins to tug at his lips before he continues on. \u201cIt\u2019s just that when I saw you and Sam together I was really jealous because you might like him\u2014 which is ok if you like him you don\u2019t need to like me\u2014 but I just got upset and acted out and I\u2014\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>You fist Bucky shirt and for a moment he looks scared, thinking you\u2019re going to punch him, before you pull him towards you, capturing his lips in a kiss before ending it just as quickly at it began. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He mumbles and your cheeks turn pink.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI like you, you idiot.\u201d You admit quietly. Bucky\u2019s eyes light up and a grin spreads across his face, making butterflies erupt in your stomach once more.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI like you too, Doll.\u201d He admits,\u00a0\u201cI like you a whole dam lot.\u201d</p>",

But then Steve introduced Bucky and you had found a reason to stay. Not only do you have someone in the compound that you could relate to because of your past with HYDRA but you also had made a new friend almost immediately and Bucky made you feel safe and wanted, even on your worst days.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time you had both made your way back to the living room, all the decorations were hung up besides a golden banner that read \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 with the number 100 underneath it added by Natasha in neat writing.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat needs to go high up on the wall!\u201d Wanda instructs as she quickly makes her way past with a bunch of balloons going in her hands as she heads outside the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to reach that high. You\u2019re going to need to go on my shoulders.\u201d Bucky says lowly and you mumble an \u201cok\u201d under your breath as you make your way over to him.</p><p><br></p><p>He puts his arms out and you jump onto his back and begin to climb up onto his broad shoulders like you had done many times before when you guys were playing around. Your heart tugs painfully at the memory but you push it away like last time and continue to get the job done.</p><p><br></p><p>He hands you the large banner and you hold it in your grasp as he makes his way to the left side of the wall. You let the other side fall from your hands as you hold the banner up to the wall with glue tact stuck to the corners of it. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs this high enough?\u201d You snapper and it came out harsher then you attended. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPut it higher.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>You do as he asks and you bring your arms up further. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs this alright your majesty?\u201d You taunt and he growls out a yes as you stick it to the wall before pulling the right side into your hands as he makes his way over in that direction.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStretch it out more so it\u2019s smooth.\u201d Bucky grumbles and you do as your told with a roll of your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Tapping his head gently as a signal to put you down, Bucky lowers you to the floor but not as delicately as usual.</p><p><br></p><p>Anger bubbles in your chest as you\u2019ve begin to get fed up with Bucky\u2019s attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d You say, hurt evident in your voice. \u201cWhy are you so moody all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Guilt begins to wash over Bucky as he realises that he\u2019s hurting you but all that comes out of his mouth is, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy fault?\u201d You exclaim, your voice raising a few octaves.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s your fault!\u201d Bucky barks even though he doesn\u2019t mean it. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, he is jealous.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly all the lights in the compound switch off and Sam quickly makes his way over to you both. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s coming, get into position.\u201d He whispers and you nod in understanding quickly ducking behind the couch with Bucky \u00a0in the middle of you and Sam.</p><p><br></p><p>Footsteps begin to get closer to the living room but you refuse to let go of your argument with Bucky. \u201cI didn\u2019t even do anything wrong.\u201d You quietly hiss in his direction and he practically hear him rolling his eyes as he clamps his metal hand over your mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cKeep your mouth shut and we won\u2019t get caught.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cJust make her shut up.\u201d Sam interrupts and before you know what\u2019s happening, Bucky is being pushed towards you.</p><p><br></p><p>Your lips collide with his and it\u2019s like gasoline and vodka have finally met a lit match, creating an explosion of emotions erupt in your stomach. You\u2019re both frozen for a second before he gently brings his metal hand up to cup your cheek. The cold metal brings your brain back to its senses and you begin to respond, slowly kissing Bucky back. The kiss in gentle and sweet and when you finally pull away from each other you\u2019re out breath and staring at him with wide eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2014 you\u2014 I thought\u2014\u201c Your rambling was cut off when the lights were switched on and a bunch of bodies moved around you to jump up.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d Everyone screams to Steve and you can hear his laugh enter the room as you slowly get up, mumbling a weak \u201csurprise\u201d.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHappy birthday Steve!\u201d You giggle, momentarily forgetting what happened with Bucky, and give him a kiss on the cheek as he comes forward and wraps his arms around you in a bear hug.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThanks sweetheart.\u201d He kisses your forehead before moving on to other people as they congratulate him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d Bucky asks as he comes to stand beside you after sharing a hug with Steve and cracking a few jokes about his old age.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d You mumble, blushing as you remember the kiss you had shared with the soldier moments before.</p><p><br></p><p>His hand gently incloses around your forearm as he brings you outside into the\u00a0hallway.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI know I was a dickhead.\u201d He begins and you snort, \u201cI hope you\u2019re not expecting me to deny that.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He replies as a smile begins to tug at his lips before he continues on. \u201cIt\u2019s just that when I saw you and Sam together I was really jealous because you might like him\u2014 which is ok if you like him you don\u2019t need to like me\u2014 but I just got upset and acted out and I\u2014\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>You fist Bucky shirt and for a moment he looks scared, thinking you\u2019re going to punch him, before you pull him towards you, capturing his lips in a kiss before ending it just as quickly at it began. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He mumbles and your cheeks turn pink.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI like you, you idiot.\u201d You admit quietly. Bucky\u2019s eyes light up and a grin spreads across his face, making butterflies erupt in your stomach once more.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI like you too, Doll.\u201d He admits,\u00a0\u201cI like you a whole dam lot.\u201d</p>",

With a bit of a push from Sam, Bucky may just admit his feelings for Y/N on the night of Steve\u2019s surprise birthday party.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Warnings:</b></p><p>Some swearing, a bit of angst</p><p><br></p><p><b>Word count:</b></p><p>2,662</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>A/N:</b></p><p>hey guys this is the second part of @bucketbarneslove writing challenge! i\u2019m super sorry that this took so long to complete and finally get up but i\u2019ve been travelling overseas and haven\u2019t had a lot of time to write and for some reason my tumblr keeps stuffing up so its getting kind of frustrating to post this but i\u2019ve finally got everything done and so here\u2019s the second part to the story. hope you guys enjoy!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6040c78354ae93f49dd221b03068439b/tumblr_inline_pcf1jsHvzx1u8gaxq_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWe need to get a start on things.\u201d A gruff voice disturbs the silence of the room, waking Sam up and making you as well as the other Avengers turn their heads to Bucky who just entered the room. \u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d Tony speaks up, \u201cIf we don\u2019t start now then we won\u2019t have things ready in time for when Cap comes home.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Wanda and Vision pack up their board game while Tony gets FRIDAY to get the rest of the Avengers into the room. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI call dibs on making the cake!\u201d Natasha shouts from the hall before entering the room and coming to stand besides you as you get off the couch. Various people pipe up and chose what they\u2019re gonna do to help out before Sam quickly cuts in, \u201cY/A and I will help Tash bake.\u201d He pipes up and Natasha protests but Tony quickly cuts in, saying that it would be for the best and he doesn\u2019t want her burning the kitchen down before the party starts. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay but that implies that I can burn it down after the party.\u201d Natasha sass\u2019 back and Tony rolls his eyes and doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p><br></p><p>Wanda and Vision leave to go blow up balloons, Peter Parker follow Tony down to the garage so they can go buy some party foods as well as chocolate and lollies and before you know it the only people left in the room are Natasha, Sam, Bucky and yourself. </p><p><br></p><p>An awkward silence settles across the room for a brief moment as we stare at the enormous pile of decorations that Bucky needs to put up around the compound.</p><p><br></p><p>Sam puts an arm around your shoulder and passes Bucky, giving him a pat on the back. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGood luck mate.\u201d He says as he leads you to the kitchen and you quickly send Bucky a sympathetic smile which is returned with a forced one before he casts his eyes downwards.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLets get started on this cake.\u201d Natasha says and gathers all the ingredients and materials to make a vanilla cake.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cChocolate cake is better.\u201d Sam states, looking over my shoulder as I begin to put the cake mix in the bowl.</p><p><br></p><p>I gasp tip the rest of the mix into the bowl before turning around and hitting his chest. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOuch! What was that for?!\u201d He explains, taken aback by your sudden change of attitude. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cVanilla cake is the best flavour cake.\u201d You argue, crossing your arms across your chest to prove that he won\u2019t be able to persuade you.</p><p><br></p><p>Your bickering continues for a solid five minutes before Sam is chasing you around the kitchen with flour on his hands and you laugh as you dodge him and duck behind the table. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou may be faster then me but I\u2019m smaller.\u201d You mumble under your breath as you quietly crawl under the table using only your knees to move forward, while both your hands are holding piles of flour. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to get up from behind that table eventually Y/N.\u201d Sam says in a sing-song voice and you whistle to get his attention, making him look down with a puzzled look before you quickly throw one hand of flour up into his face. </p><p><br></p><p>He coughs as his stumbles back and makes a noise which sounds like a bird crossed between a seal. You snicker as you get out from under the table and flour falls around because Sam has dropped his pile of flower in shock. You make your way behind Sam as he is still trying to get flour off his face and out of your hair. </p><p><br></p><p>You throw your last pile of flour at the back of Sams head and he whips around to face you. \u201cOh you\u2019re gonna regret that.\u201d He threats, trying to sound intimidating but the smile forming on his face is a clear indicator that he doesn\u2019t totally mean it.</p><p><br></p><p>You turn to run out of the kitchen but Sam lunges forward and wraps his arms around your stomach, picking you up and you let out a squeal of surprise as you feel your self being lift up into the air. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d You screech as you burst into a fit of giggles as he begins to tickle your stomach as he places your feet back of the floor.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cP-please stop! I\u2019m go-gonna die!\u201d You try to get out and he laughs at your expense. \u201cNot until you admit that chocolate cake is better!\u201d He sung. \u201cOk ok! Chocolate cake is better!\u201d You let out reluctantly.</p><p><br></p><p>His fingers stop attacking your sides and he lets you slump down onto the kitchen floor as you wheeze trying to catch your breath. \u201cYou are the\u2026 worst\u2026. person\u2026 ever.\u201d You manage to get out between taking big gulps of air. \u201cI know.\u201d Sam chuckles, moving away from you and standing next to Natasha who was watching the whole scene play out in front of her with an amused expression.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell while you two were having your little fight over there I finished the cake and put it in the oven.\u201d Natasha informs and your eyes drift over to the oven from your viewpoint on the floor and you could see that she did in fact have the cake in the oven. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOk well now that it\u2019s done I\u2019m gonna go.\u201d Sam begins to walk towards the kitchen door and Natasha calls him back. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t think so Bird Boy. You\u2019re going to stay here and clean up this mess while I prepare the icing.\u201d Natasha chimes and Sam begins to protest but stops the minute she shoots him a glare and instead he begins to mumbles profanities under his breath as he goes to get the vacuum.</p><p><br></p><p>You let out a giggle as you pick yourself up from the floor and dust off your body to make sure there is no flour on you.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou need my help with anything Nat? Maybe with the 100 candles that you\u2019re going to have to put on that cake?\u201d You question and she shakes her head.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019ll be ok. Go find your man Bucky and help him put up all those decorations.\u201d Natasha winks and you let out a squeak, afraid that someone might of heard her.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my man.\u201d You protest weakly and she rolls her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMaybe so but you know you want him to be.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You ignore her comment as you exit the room. Natasha was right. You did want bucky to be \u201cyour Man\u201d but it\u2019s not like you would ever admit that to him though. It had taken a while for you to gain Bucky\u2019s trust and for him to open up to you about his past and you didn\u2019t want to throw your friendship away all because you had a stupid crush. In saying that though, you still couldn\u2019t help it when butterflies erupt in your stomach at the sound of his voice and you somehow weren\u2019t able to stop your heartbeat from picking up when you catch him smiling at you.</p><p><br></p><p>You make your way around the compound looking for Bucky since he was no longer in the living room, for some reason leaving it only half decorated. You find him in the hallway that leads away from the front door Avengers tower.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey there Soldier, you alright?\u201d You ask as you come up behind him and his shoulders tense when he hears your voice.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Bucky replies shortly and focuses his attention back onto decorating the walls with colourful streamers.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI noticed that you only decorated half of the living room. Did something happen?\u201d Your voice is laid with worry as you place a gentle hand on his bicep that is closer to you, which so happens to be his prosthetic one, and he moves his arm away, letting your hand drop back to your side.</p><p><br></p><p>Your eyes are filled with worry but he doesn\u2019t look back at you to see the reaction his action had caused. </p><p><br></p><p>You were always allowed to touch his metal arm. Never once had he objected or stated that he was uncomfortable, no matter how many times you asked him if he was sure.</p><p><br></p><p>You cast your eyes downward, thinking that whatever\u2019s happening with Bucky is your fault and you ignore the aching in your chest as you reach down to grab a streamer to help him put them up. </p><p><br></p><p>A tense silence fills the hall as you both work quietly to put up the decorations as soon as possible. </p><p><br></p><p>Bucky internally sighs, knowing that it\u2019s his fault as to why there is no conversation flowing between you both. The Winter Soldier keeps sneaking glances at your figure that is standing further up the hall. \u00a0He takes in your slouched shoulders and the hair that is acting as a shield around your face. He realises that he hurt you but he begins to feel some regret before it\u2019s clouded over by anger and jealousy at the thought of you laughing and having fun with Sam.</p><p><br></p><p>As you both make your way up the hall, Bucky occasionally barking order at you as to where to put the streamers. Tears begin to form in your eyes at the realisation that you might be losing Bucky but you quickly push that idea out of your head. You wouldn\u2019t let that happen. You couldn\u2019t lose Bucky when he was the only thing keeping you here.</p><p><br></p><p>When Tony Stark had asked you to join the Avengers you were hesitant as your powers could be used for bad things but you reluctantly agreed once he had pointed out that they could also be used for good. The first few weeks at the compound were long and hard. You had training nearly everyday and you were trying to make friends with your team and you eventually got tired of trying to juggle all these things at once. But then Steve introduced Bucky and you had found a reason to stay. Not only do you have someone in the compound that you could relate to because of your past with HYDRA but you also had made a new friend almost immediately and Bucky made you feel safe and wanted, even on your worst days.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time you had both made your way back to the living room, all the decorations were hung up besides a golden banner that read \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 with the number 100 underneath it added by Natasha in neat writing.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat needs to go high up on the wall!\u201d Wanda instructs as she quickly makes her way past with a bunch of balloons going in her hands as she heads outside the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to reach that high. You\u2019re going to need to go on my shoulders.\u201d Bucky says lowly and you mumble an \u201cok\u201d under your breath as you make your way over to him.</p><p><br></p><p>He puts his arms out and you jump onto his back and begin to climb up onto his broad shoulders like you had done many times before when you guys were playing around. Your heart tugs painfully at the memory but you push it away like last time and continue to get the job done.</p><p><br></p><p>He hands you the large banner and you hold it in your grasp as he makes his way to the left side of the wall. You let the other side fall from your hands as you hold the banner up to the wall with glue tact stuck to the corners of it. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs this high enough?\u201d You snapper and it came out harsher then you attended. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPut it higher.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>You do as he asks and you bring your arms up further. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs this alright your majesty?\u201d You taunt and he growls out a yes as you stick it to the wall before pulling the right side into your hands as he makes his way over in that direction.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStretch it out more so it\u2019s smooth.\u201d Bucky grumbles and you do as your told with a roll of your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Tapping his head gently as a signal to put you down, Bucky lowers you to the floor but not as delicately as usual.</p><p><br></p><p>Anger bubbles in your chest as you\u2019ve begin to get fed up with Bucky\u2019s attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d You say, hurt evident in your voice. \u201cWhy are you so moody all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Guilt begins to wash over Bucky as he realises that he\u2019s hurting you but all that comes out of his mouth is, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy fault?\u201d You exclaim, your voice raising a few octaves.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s your fault!\u201d Bucky barks even though he doesn\u2019t mean it. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, he is jealous.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly all the lights in the compound switch off and Sam quickly makes his way over to you both. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s coming, get into position.\u201d He whispers and you nod in understanding quickly ducking behind the couch with Bucky \u00a0in the middle of you and Sam.</p><p><br></p><p>Footsteps begin to get closer to the living room but you refuse to let go of your argument with Bucky. \u201cI didn\u2019t even do anything wrong.\u201d You quietly hiss in his direction and he practically hear him rolling his eyes as he clamps his metal hand over your mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cKeep your mouth shut and we won\u2019t get caught.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cJust make her shut up.\u201d Sam interrupts and before you know what\u2019s happening, Bucky is being pushed towards you.</p><p><br></p><p>Your lips collide with his and it\u2019s like gasoline and vodka have finally met a lit match, creating an explosion of emotions erupt in your stomach. You\u2019re both frozen for a second before he gently brings his metal hand up to cup your cheek. The cold metal brings your brain back to its senses and you begin to respond, slowly kissing Bucky back.

Various people pipe up and chose what they&rsquo;re gonna do to help out before Sam quickly cuts in, &ldquo;Y/A and I will help Tash bake.&rdquo; He pipes up and Natasha protests but Tony quickly cuts in, saying that it would be for the best and he doesn&rsquo;t want her burning the kitchen down before the party starts. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay but that implies that I can burn it down after the party.&rdquo; Natasha sass&rsquo; back and Tony rolls his eyes and doesn&rsquo;t respond.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wanda and Vision leave to go blow up balloons, Peter Parker follow Tony down to the garage so they can go buy some party foods as well as chocolate and lollies and before you know it the only people left in the room are Natasha, Sam, Bucky and yourself. </p><p><br /></p><p>An awkward silence settles across the room for a brief moment as we stare at the enormous pile of decorations that Bucky needs to put up around the compound.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sam puts an arm around your shoulder and passes Bucky, giving him a pat on the back. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good luck mate.&rdquo; He says as he leads you to the kitchen and you quickly send Bucky a sympathetic smile which is returned with a forced one before he casts his eyes downwards.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lets get started on this cake.&rdquo; Natasha says and gathers all the ingredients and materials to make a vanilla cake.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Chocolate cake is better.&rdquo; Sam states, looking over my shoulder as I begin to put the cake mix in the bowl.</p><p><br /></p><p>I gasp tip the rest of the mix into the bowl before turning around and hitting his chest. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ouch! What was that for?!&rdquo; He explains, taken aback by your sudden change of attitude. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Vanilla cake is the best flavour cake.&rdquo; You argue, crossing your arms across your chest to prove that he won&rsquo;t be able to persuade you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your bickering continues for a solid five minutes before Sam is chasing you around the kitchen with flour on his hands and you laugh as you dodge him and duck behind the table. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You may be faster then me but I&rsquo;m smaller.&rdquo; You mumble under your breath as you quietly crawl under the table using only your knees to move forward, while both your hands are holding piles of flour. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have to get up from behind that table eventually Y/N.&rdquo; Sam says in a sing-song voice and you whistle to get his attention, making him look down with a puzzled look before you quickly throw one hand of flour up into his face. </p><p><br /></p><p>He coughs as his stumbles back and makes a noise which sounds like a bird crossed between a seal. You snicker as you get out from under the table and flour falls around because Sam has dropped his pile of flower in shock. You make your way behind Sam as he is still trying to get flour off his face and out of your hair. </p><p><br /></p><p>You throw your last pile of flour at the back of Sams head and he whips around to face you. &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re gonna regret that.&rdquo; He threats, trying to sound intimidating but the smile forming on his face is a clear indicator that he doesn&rsquo;t totally mean it.</p><p><br /></p><p>You turn to run out of the kitchen but Sam lunges forward and wraps his arms around your stomach, picking you up and you let out a squeal of surprise as you feel your self being lift up into the air. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let me go.&rdquo; You screech as you burst into a fit of giggles as he begins to tickle your stomach as he places your feet back of the floor.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;P-please stop! I&rsquo;m go-gonna die!&rdquo; You try to get out and he laughs at your expense. &ldquo;Not until you admit that chocolate cake is better!&rdquo; He sung. &ldquo;Ok ok! Chocolate cake is better!&rdquo; You let out reluctantly.</p><p><br /></p><p>His fingers stop attacking your sides and he lets you slump down onto the kitchen floor as you wheeze trying to catch your breath. &ldquo;You are the&hellip; worst&hellip;. person&hellip; ever.&rdquo; You manage to get out between taking big gulps of air. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Sam chuckles, moving away from you and standing next to Natasha who was watching the whole scene play out in front of her with an amused expression.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well while you two were having your little fight over there I finished the cake and put it in the oven.&rdquo; Natasha informs and your eyes drift over to the oven from your viewpoint on the floor and you could see that she did in fact have the cake in the oven. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ok well now that it&rsquo;s done I&rsquo;m gonna go.&rdquo; Sam begins to walk towards the kitchen door and Natasha calls him back. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t think so Bird Boy. You&rsquo;re going to stay here and clean up this mess while I prepare the icing.&rdquo; Natasha chimes and Sam begins to protest but stops the minute she shoots him a glare and instead he begins to mumbles profanities under his breath as he goes to get the vacuum.</p><p><br /></p><p>You let out a giggle as you pick yourself up from the floor and dust off your body to make sure there is no flour on you.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You need my help with anything Nat? Maybe with the 100 candles that you&rsquo;re going to have to put on that cake?&rdquo; You question and she shakes her head.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;ll be ok. Go find your man Bucky and help him put up all those decorations.&rdquo; Natasha winks and you let out a squeak, afraid that someone might of heard her.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my man.&rdquo; You protest weakly and she rolls her eyes.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe so but you know you want him to be.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>You ignore her comment as you exit the room. Natasha was right. You did want bucky to be &ldquo;your Man&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not like you would ever admit that to him though. It had taken a while for you to gain Bucky&rsquo;s trust and for him to open up to you about his past and you didn&rsquo;t want to throw your friendship away all because you had a stupid crush. In saying that though, you still couldn&rsquo;t help it when butterflies erupt in your stomach at the sound of his voice and you somehow weren&rsquo;t able to stop your heartbeat from picking up when you catch him smiling at you.</p><p><br /></p><p>You make your way around the compound looking for Bucky since he was no longer in the living room, for some reason leaving it only half decorated. You find him in the hallway that leads away from the front door Avengers tower.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey there Soldier, you alright?&rdquo; You ask as you come up behind him and his shoulders tense when he hears your voice.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Bucky replies shortly and focuses his attention back onto decorating the walls with colourful streamers.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I noticed that you only decorated half of the living room. Did something happen?&rdquo; Your voice is laid with worry as you place a gentle hand on his bicep that is closer to you, which so happens to be his prosthetic one, and he moves his arm away, letting your hand drop back to your side.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your eyes are filled with worry but he doesn&rsquo;t look back at you to see the reaction his action had caused. </p><p><br /></p><p>You were always allowed to touch his metal arm. Never once had he objected or stated that he was uncomfortable, no matter how many times you asked him if he was sure.</p><p><br /></p><p>You cast your eyes downward, thinking that whatever&rsquo;s happening with Bucky is your fault and you ignore the aching in your chest as you reach down to grab a streamer to help him put them up. </p><p><br /></p><p>A tense silence fills the hall as you both work quietly to put up the decorations as soon as possible. </p><p><br /></p><p>Bucky internally sighs, knowing that it&rsquo;s his fault as to why there is no conversation flowing between you both. The Winter Soldier keeps sneaking glances at your figure that is standing further up the hall. &nbsp;He takes in your slouched shoulders and the hair that is acting as a shield around your face. He realises that he hurt you but he begins to feel some regret before it&rsquo;s clouded over by anger and jealousy at the thought of you laughing and having fun with Sam.</p><p><br /></p><p>As you both make your way up the hall, Bucky occasionally barking order at you as to where to put the streamers. Tears begin to form in your eyes at the realisation that you might be losing Bucky but you quickly push that idea out of your head. You wouldn&rsquo;t let that happen. You couldn&rsquo;t lose Bucky when he was the only thing keeping you here.</p><p><br /></p><p>When Tony Stark had asked you to join the Avengers you were hesitant as your powers could be used for bad things but you reluctantly agreed once he had pointed out that they could also be used for good. The first few weeks at the compound were long and hard. You had training nearly everyday and you were trying to make friends with your team and you eventually got tired of trying to juggle all these things at once. But then Steve introduced Bucky and you had found a reason to stay. Not only do you have someone in the compound that you could relate to because of your past with HYDRA but you also had made a new friend almost immediately and Bucky made you feel safe and wanted, even on your worst days.</p><p><br /></p><p>By the time you had both made your way back to the living room, all the decorations were hung up besides a golden banner that read &lsquo;Happy Birthday&rsquo; with the number 100 underneath it added by Natasha in neat writing.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;That needs to go high up on the wall!&rdquo; Wanda instructs as she quickly makes her way past with a bunch of balloons going in her hands as she heads outside the room.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be able to reach that high. You&rsquo;re going to need to go on my shoulders.&rdquo; Bucky says lowly and you mumble an &ldquo;ok&rdquo; under your breath as you make your way over to him.</p><p><br /></p><p>He puts his arms out and you jump onto his back and begin to climb up onto his broad shoulders like you had done many times before when you guys were playing around. Your heart tugs painfully at the memory but you push it away like last time and continue to get the job done.</p><p><br /></p><p>He hands you the large banner and you hold it in your grasp as he makes his way to the left side of the wall. You let the other side fall from your hands as you hold the banner up to the wall with glue tact stuck to the corners of it. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is this high enough?&rdquo; You snapper and it came out harsher then you attended. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Put it higher.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>You do as he asks and you bring your arms up further. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is this alright your majesty?&rdquo; You taunt and he growls out a yes as you stick it to the wall before pulling the right side into your hands as he makes his way over in that direction.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stretch it out more so it&rsquo;s smooth.&rdquo; Bucky grumbles and you do as your told with a roll of your eyes.</p><p><br /></p><p>Tapping his head gently as a signal to put you down, Bucky lowers you to the floor but not as delicately as usual.</p><p><br /></p><p>Anger bubbles in your chest as you&rsquo;ve begin to get fed up with Bucky&rsquo;s attitude.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; You say, hurt evident in your voice. &ldquo;Why are you so moody all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Guilt begins to wash over Bucky as he realises that he&rsquo;s hurting you but all that comes out of his mouth is, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;My fault?&rdquo; You exclaim, your voice raising a few octaves.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes! It&rsquo;s your fault!&rdquo; Bucky barks even though he doesn&rsquo;t mean it. You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, he is jealous.</p><p><br /></p><p>Suddenly all the lights in the compound switch off and Sam quickly makes his way over to you both. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s coming, get into position.&rdquo; He whispers and you nod in understanding quickly ducking behind the couch with Bucky &nbsp;in the middle of you and Sam.</p><p><br /></p><p>Footsteps begin to get closer to the living room but you refuse to let go of your argument with Bucky. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even do anything wrong.&rdquo; You quietly hiss in his direction and he practically hear him rolling his eyes as he clamps his metal hand over your mouth.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Keep your mouth shut and we won&rsquo;t get caught.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just make her shut up.&rdquo; Sam interrupts and before you know what&rsquo;s happening, Bucky is being pushed towards you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your lips collide with his and it&rsquo;s like gasoline and vodka have finally met a lit match, creating an explosion of emotions erupt in your stomach. You&rsquo;re both frozen for a second before he gently brings his metal hand up to cup your cheek. The cold metal brings your brain back to its senses and you begin to respond, slowly kissing Bucky back. The kiss in gentle and sweet and when you finally pull away from each other you&rsquo;re out breath and staring at him with wide eyes.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash; you&mdash; I thought&mdash;&ldquo; Your rambling was cut off when the lights were switched on and a bunch of bodies moved around you to jump up.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Surprise!&rdquo; Everyone screams to Steve and you can hear his laugh enter the room as you slowly get up, mumbling a weak &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Happy birthday Steve!&rdquo; You giggle, momentarily forgetting what happened with Bucky, and give him a kiss on the cheek as he comes forward and wraps his arms around you in a bear hug.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks sweetheart.&rdquo; He kisses your forehead before moving on to other people as they congratulate him.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can I talk to you for a second?&rdquo; Bucky asks as he comes to stand beside you after sharing a hug with Steve and cracking a few jokes about his old age.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; You mumble, blushing as you remember the kiss you had shared with the soldier moments before.</p><p><br /></p><p>His hand gently incloses around your forearm as he brings you outside into the&nbsp;hallway.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know I was a dickhead.&rdquo; He begins and you snort, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not expecting me to deny that.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; He replies as a smile begins to tug at his lips before he continues on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that when I saw you and Sam together I was really jealous because you might like him&mdash; which is ok if you like him you don&rsquo;t need to like me&mdash; but I just got upset and acted out and I&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>You fist Bucky shirt and for a moment he looks scared, thinking you&rsquo;re going to punch him, before you pull him towards you, capturing his lips in a kiss before ending it just as quickly at it began. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; He mumbles and your cheeks turn pink.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I like you, you idiot.&rdquo; You admit quietly. Bucky&rsquo;s eyes light up and a grin spreads across his face, making butterflies erupt in your stomach once more.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I like you too, Doll.&rdquo; He admits,&nbsp;&ldquo;I like you a whole dam lot.&rdquo;</p>",
