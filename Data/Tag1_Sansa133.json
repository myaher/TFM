Because the furniture wasn\u2019t just hers, it was also his.</p><!-- more --><p>They had accepted one donation from her parents though. It occupied half the living room and they had had to sacrifice the dinner table they would have liked to add, but it was the one thing Sansa couldn\u2019t live without.</p><p>With a smile on her face she sat down on the music stool behind the gleaming black piano. She placed her fingers on the keys and automatically they started dancing. </p><p>Debussy, Mozart. Bach. Berlioz. The Beatles. Nina Stallone. </p><p>The melodies flew just as easily as her own breath and while the music filled the room she allowed her mind to drift off and dream of the future. </p><p>The house was small and yet she could imagine their children making a mess of it, running around in their underwear, riding a cockhorse and playing hide and seek. She imagined Jon running after them, cursing them and loving them at the same time, holding them in his arms and refusing to let them go again. </p><p>And in the middle of that chaos she would still be playing her songs.</p><p>She would play them soothing songs to fall asleep. She would play them comforting tunes when they felt alone. And while she would play all the happy waltzes she had memorised, Jon would teach their children how to dance. </p><p>Their little girl would stand on his feet while he twirled her around. Their little boy would look up at him in awe while trying to copy all his movements and his grace.</p><p>And where other mothers would read their kids fairytales from storybooks, she would tell them the story of the Sleeping Beauty ballet and she would sing them the sad tale of the Erlk\u00f6nig. </p><p>And Jon would listen to each story just as mesmerized as his kids, even though he had heard her stories at least a trillion times before already, when Sansa had been rehearsing them and had tripped over the unknown and unfamiliar notes.</p><p>And when Jon would be the successful lawyer he was certainly going to be one day, they would take their kids to the theatre. They would teach them to appreciate opera, even though all their classmates would call it old fashioned. But they would also take them to musicals and plays and to concerts of the pop idols that would blast through their speakers when they had grown to be teens.</p><p>And in between all this, Jon would take them to the ice rink where he had learned how to skate, where he had played his first ice hockey matches, where he had learn how to win and how to lose. And they would fall countless of times, but Jon would help them up just as often. And maybe they would become ice hockey players too. Or they would fall in love with soccer, or lacrosse, or baseball.</p><p>Maybe one day their kids would tell them that they didn\u2019t want to go to the theatre anymore. That they grew tired of hearing the same songs over and over.</p><p>And whatever they choose and whoever they wanted to be. Jon and Sansa would still love them just the same.</p><p>Because one day they would find someone, like she had found Jon, and they would start their own life, in their own house or a small apartment. And just like Sansa they would feel like truly coming home. They would become the main characters in their own little love story.</p><p>And while all those thoughts and images clouded her mind, time passed. Minutes, hours and eventually it was the opening of the front door forcing her to return to reality. </p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Jon scratched the back of his neck when he entered the living room. He had a deep frown on his forehead and his dark curls were messy, blown by the strong autumn wind. \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna disturb you.\u201d</p><p>But Sansa smiled and she stood up from the stool to wrap her arms around his neck and kiss him. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d She leaned back and closed her eyes for a brief moment.</p><p>And long after their kids would have started their own lives and love stories. When the house wasn\u2019t filled with constant chaos anymore. Jon and Sansa would still love each other. Her heart would still skip a beat whenever he came home from work. And he would still stare at her with only admiration in his eyes whenever she was studying on a new masterpiece for her next concert. </p><p>And whether they would live in a bigger house or still in this small apartment. They would still be happy and satisfied. They would still be at home. They would still have everything they truly needed. </p><p>Music and Love.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Rewatching &lsquo;Baelor&rsquo; I get a better understanding of Arya&rsquo;s resentment towards Sansa in Season 7. Arya escaped the castle when the Lannisters slaughtered the Stark household but unlike Sansa, she had to live on the streets and thus never got a clear view of what happened. Sansa had the biased version of Cersei and the court while Arya probably got whatever twisted versions of the story the commoners told amongst themselves. I mean we all know how they blindly and stupidly absorb whatever tales they are told. </p><p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is that Sansa had a slightly clearer version of what happened that led to her father&rsquo;s imprisonment while Arya was left quite in the dark. And then Ned is dragged at the Sept of Baelor and Arya sees him for the first time and Sansa is here standing with the Lannisters. Arya cannot know what happened at court and she is unfortunately very young so it is easy to draw conclusions. And I know I was very harsh in Season 7 when it came to her accusations towards her sister but she actually didn&rsquo;t really see Sansa plead for Ned&rsquo;s life - she had already come down Baelor&rsquo;s statue and amongst the shouts of the crowd, it probably was easy to not hear Sansa&rsquo;s cries. </p><p>So yeah. Still not a fan of this S7 storyline but it was not THAT out of character as I thought it was  </p>",
