Basile is moping, half-lying on the floor, the third day in a row after Daphn\u00e9 had broken up with him. Idriss is in the middle of downing another one of his awful drinks. Lucas can hear Yann, Sofiane, and Arthur from all the way in the kitchen, arguing about something, and their voices are just on the side of loud that it\u2019s starting to get on Lucas\u2019s nerves. He takes another swing from the bottle, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and then lets his head fall back, stares at the cracks on the ceiling, fails to count them because he\u2019s very tipsy and very tired.</p><p>He can\u2019t remember the last time he wasn\u2019t stressed over something. The workload he has to deal with if he wants to pass his classes threatens his sanity on a daily basis. His dad hasn\u2019t transferred him money this month yet, and Lucas doesn\u2019t want to explicitly ask for it because theoretically, he has a job, but he doesn\u2019t make enough to cover all the expenses and then rent, too, so there\u2019s that. His mom has sent him about 20 messages today, all biblical and more cryptic than what he\u2019s used to, and when he tried calling her, she didn\u2019t pick up, which can only mean that she\u2019s been doing worse than usual. He hasn\u2019t been sleeping, really, and the bags under his eyes are starting to look more like bruises than anything else at this point. Mika keeps pestering him about it, which only makes it all worse.</p><p>Lucas is doing so great.</p><!-- more --><p>He shifts on the couch, the room around him swaying a little like he\u2019s underwater, and then he feels a weight of someone drop onto the couch next to him. Somehow, he\u2019s closed his eyes without realising. When he opens them, he\u2019s greeted with the sigh of Eliott.</p><p>\u201dHey,\u201d the boy says. He smells like cigarette smoke and clean fresh air of the night like he\u2019s been outside and has only now come back in. Maybe he has, anyway. Lucas wouldn\u2019t know. \u201dYou having fun?\u201d</p><p>Lucas says, \u201dA mental breakdown is what I\u2019m having.\u201d</p><p>It makes Eliott smirk, but it\u2019s a weak smile, barely there and gone. It\u2019s not what Lucas is used to, from Eliott. \u201dLike everyone here, tonight.\u201d</p><p>He has a point, Lucas thinks. Eliott\u2019s personal reason for hosting their pathetic little get-together is his recent breakup with Lucille. Which, honestly, has happened before, but Eliott claims that it\u2019s for good this time and, judging how out of it he seems to be, there might be some truth to the words. Lucas notices, with a small part of his mind, that the usual spark in Eliott\u2019s eyes is dulled and unfitting. He looks like he\u2019s wearing pyjamas; his apartment is even more of a mess than usual.</p><p>\u201dAre you feeling any better?\u201d Lucas asks.</p><p>Eliott almost winces this time, then turns straight ahead and stares at the TV at the other side of the room, across from them. It\u2019s turned off. \u201dNot really, no.\u201d</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i>, Lucas kind of wants to say, but stops himself. Eliott doesn\u2019t like pity, he knows. And anyway, it\u2019s more than possible for him and Lucille to get back together by the end of the week. It\u2019s happened before. They\u2019re that kind of couple, one where they argue a lot but always come back to each other in the end.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s not nice, what Lucas is thinking. He tries to backtrack, sluggishly sorts his thoughts into something else. What he comes up with is, \u201dDo you want to watch something?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a stupid suggestion and he only says it because Eliott keeps looking at the black screen of the TV like he\u2019s waiting for it to come to life on its own, and somehow Lucas decides that the idea fits, then. Eliott turns and looks at him. \u201dWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYou keep looking at the TV but it\u2019s not on,\u201d Lucas points out his thoughts, very intelligently. He trips over the words a little. \u201dMight as well watch something.\u201d</p><p>Eliott looks around the room where Idriss is mixing at least three different liquids in his cup and where Basile is in the middle of gulping down yet another drink while staring at his phone in the half-dark, and appears to come to a conclusion. \u201dYeah, I guess. What do you want to watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201dAnything but one of your pretentious boring films,\u201d Lucas says. Eliott shoots him a glare and he grins at him because they\u2019ve had this conversation before and Eliott\u2019s fun to tease. \u201dWhatever\u2019s on TV. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201dAlright,\u201d Eliott agrees, and turns the TV on, and there they go.</p><p>*</p><p>They end up watching reruns of some stupid talk show, and it\u2019s loud enough to lure Yann, Arthur, and Sofiane out of the kitchen and join them in the room, which quickly just turns into them running a commentary about everything and nothing. Yann confiscates Basile\u2019s phone for, he says, Basile\u2019s own good. Sofiane makes a mistake of agreeing to try Idriss\u2019s weird drink concoction and it makes him cough violently after taking only one sip. Lucas just laughs at it all; Eliott leans more heavily into his side as he does and reaches into his own pocket to light another cigarette.</p><p>The night stretches, then lingers into late hours, and then the guys go home, one after another, and somehow Lucas misses the moment when he becomes the only one left in Eliott\u2019s presence.</p><p>It\u2019s cool. He\u2019s a little wobbly on his feet but offers to help clean up, and they gather the empty glasses and bottles and go to the kitchen to wash them all. Well, Eliott washes them, anyway, even though he\u2019s almost as unsteady as Lucas at this point, from all the alcohol. Lucas hops onto the countertop next to the sink and watches him struggle through the cleaning process, giggling. The room around him is swaying. He keeps looking at Eliott\u2019s hands, his long fingers, strong wrists, watches as Eliott finishes up and dries his hands with a towel.</p><p>The night is warm and comfortable and pleasantly hazy.</p><p>\u201dAre you done?\u201d Lucas asks, despite it being clear that yes, Eliott\u2019s in fact finished, because being a little shit is funny. He swings his legs, kicks at the kitchen cupboards. Eliott raises an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201dWhat, did you get tired of watching me clean?\u201d he says, stepping away from the sink and closer to where Lucas\u2019s sitting, props a hand on his hip. \u201dThanks for the help, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI mean, you hosted the party so,\u201d Lucas shrugs, \u201dI don\u2019t know what you were expecting.\u201d</p><p>He thinks his words are slurring together, a little bit, but he\u2019s not sure. Or doesn\u2019t care, same thing. Eliott looks like he\u2019s fighting a smile, for some reason. It makes Lucas want to smile, too.</p><p>\u201dWow, what a good friend you are,\u201d he says, and Lucas shrugs in response.</p><p>\u201dI know, right,\u201d he tells Eliott. The smile breaks out on Eliott\u2019s face, at that. It\u2019s very pretty, Lucas thinks hazily. \u201dAnd anyway, you did a great job all by yourself. Not like you needed me.\u201d</p><p>He kicks at the cupboards again, just for the sake of it, which makes Eliott reach out and squeeze his knee in an attempt to stop him. Somehow, he\u2019s standing right in front of Lucas now. Lucas missed the moment he moved.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m that good, huh,\u201d Eliott says. His smile looks easy. More than tipsy. Lucas lets his head fall back until it hits the wall, then looks at Eliott like that. The room\u2019s spinning a little less.</p><p>\u201dYeah,\u201d he agrees, kicks the cupboard again. Eliott grips his other knee, too, steady, takes half a step closer. \u201dThe perfect guy, you.\u201d</p><p>And then Eliott\u2019s kissing him.</p><p>Lucas doesn\u2019t register what\u2019s happening at first. Eliott moves one hand to cup the side of his face, slides the other up his thigh, and he\u2019s warm and solid and he\u2019s kissing him. Lucas\u2019s head swims, and he tangles his fingers in Eliott\u2019s hair on autopilot, kisses him back and they\u2019re drunk and they\u2019re kissing and Lucas only really catches up on what\u2019s going on when Eliott abruptly moves away.</p><p>\u201dShit, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Eliott breathes out. Lucas\u2019s gaze drops to his mouth and stays there for a second too long before traveling up to his eyes. They\u2019re wide. Eliott\u2019s blinking fast. \u201dI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know why I did that, fuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dNo, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d Lucas starts, doesn\u2019t finish. His hands are still in Eliott\u2019s hair; he keeps them there. \u201dIt\u2019s fine. I mean, it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>Eliott moves his hand away from Lucas\u2019s thigh, but then his fingers freeze mid-motion. \u201dIt\u2019s cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah, I mean\u2014\u201d Lucas stutters and he can\u2019t stop his eyes from dropping to Eliott\u2019s mouth again. Everything feels blurry, like he\u2019s looking at the room through fogged up glass, except it translates into a feeling and not a sight. And then he says what he says because he\u2019s stressed and tired and fucking drunk. The thought just comes so he lets it out. \u201dDon\u2019t you, like, need a rebound, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Eliott\u2019s gaze flits all over Lucas\u2019s face like he\u2019s looking for something there. Lucas doesn\u2019t know if he finds it, whatever it is. \u201dWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201dDon\u2019t you need a rebound?\u201d he repeats. He wonders if what he\u2019s saying sounds stupid. He can\u2019t tell. \u201dThat\u2019s the best way to get over someone, right? And fuck Lucille, anyway. What was she thinking, breaking up with you like that, like why did you even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dLucas, what\u2014\u201d Eliott starts and then hiccups, suddenly. His hand lands back on Lucas\u2019s thigh. Lucas wonders, absentmindedly, how much has Eliott drunk tonight. \u201dWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>What <i>is</i> he saying, really? Jesus. He can\u2019t stop fucking looking at Eliott\u2019s lips. \u201dYou can say no if you don\u2019t want to, I\u2019m not gonna be mad, we\u2019re friends,\u201d he assures, rakes a hand through Eliott\u2019s hair, pushes it out of his eyes. Eliott doesn\u2019t stop him, just keeps looking at him. \u201dAnd it\u2019s not like I\u2019m offering just because, or whatever, I\u2019m just saying that I could use a distraction myself, I\u2019ve been fucking stressed, dude, and clearly there\u2019s something in this for the both of us, and since I don\u2019t think I completely disgust you because you\u2019ve just kissed me, right, so yeah\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas is faintly aware that he\u2019s babbling, but he doesn\u2019t really care. Is he making an idiot out of himself? Maybe. But Eliott moves his hand up to his thigh, looking like he\u2019s not even aware of it, and then he\u2019s saying, \u201dFuck, damn it,\u201d and then Lucas is being kissed again, Eliott muscling his way between Lucas\u2019s thighs, and they\u2019re full-on making out in Eliott\u2019s tiny kitchen. Time goes wobbly \u2014 Eliott licks into Lucas\u2019s mouth and swallows whatever faint sounds Lucas makes, and they keep kissing and kissing until Lucas snakes a hand under Eliott\u2019s t-shirt and Eliott tugs him off the kitchen counter then, mutters, \u201dWe\u2019re out of here,\u201d in between kisses and Lucas only breathes a \u201dYeah?\u201d, lets himself be pulled to Eliott\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He ends up face down Eliott\u2019s rumpled sheets, later, swallowing down a moan as Eliott pushes in and then biting his lips when Eliott starts to move and when muffling his whimpers in the bedding when they get gradually louder. Eliott holds his hips down, builds up a rhythm that has Lucas shaking within minutes, quick, shallow thrusts that make Lucas\u2019s skin crawl with need and drive him up near the edge embarrassingly quickly. It\u2019s that and the alcohol, he tells himself, a thought barely there in the haze of his mind, and then Eliott snaps his hips up, faster still, and Lucas barely has enough time to moan out a choked off \u201dI\u2019m gonna\u2014<i>oh</i>\u2014\u201d and barely catches the sound of Eliott\u2019s punched out groan before he comes into his own hand, trembling.</p><p>Eliott follows him closely after, grip tightening on Lucas\u2019s hips as he comes, and he lets himself slump onto Lucas for only a couple of seconds before he catches himself on the bed and carefully pulls out, then gets rid of the condom.</p><p>Lucas flops onto his back, shakily, breathing unsteady. He thinks, <i>oh God</i>, and then, for good measure, <i>Jesus</i>. He listens to his own breathing. Focuses on getting a grip on his erratic heartbeat. Eliott just kind of sits on the bed next to him for a while, sounds a little out of breath as well. Lucas\u2019s head swims.</p><p>\u201dYou can take a shower if you want,\u201d Eliott says after a while, a hitch from exertion still there in his breath, but not as prominent. Lucas turns to look at him, squinting slightly.</p><p>\u201dI should go home,\u201d he says.</p><p>Eliott rolls his eyes. Lucas faintly notes the colour high in his cheeks. \u201dDon\u2019t be ridiculous, it\u2019s 3 in the morning. There\u2019re no buses until at least 6.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI can walk back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m not letting you walk back home alone in the middle of the night,\u201d Eliott says, then reaches down and grabs his boxers off the floor, puts them on, stands up. Lucas just blinks at him. \u201dGo take a shower. You can sleep on the couch and walk back home in the morning, alright?\u201d</p><p>Lucas blinks again and his eyes stay closed for longer than a blink should last, he thinks. His heartbeat is almost back to normal now. Eliott\u2019s bed is soft. \u201dEliott, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m serious,\u201d Eliott says. He looks very tall. It\u2019s not fair. \u201dYou can go home as soon as the sun rises if you want to. Okay?\u201d And then, not really waiting for Lucas\u2019s answer, Eliott walks out of the room, saying, \u201dThe couch\u2019s pretty comfortable, you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>So yeah. Lucas goes to take a shower.</p><p>The stream of water sobers him up a bit, but his limbs feel heavy. He watches the bubbles of soap go down the drain, swirling, and as the shower door fogs up, his mind clears a little. He stands under the spray until he gets tired of it, then shuts the water off. Eliott has left him a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt by the sink. Lucas feels strangely grateful for the uncalled gesture, even if he has to roll the pants because they\u2019re too long.</p><p>He stumbles out of the bathroom to find Eliott padding out of the kitchen with a glass of water in hand.</p><p>\u201dFor you,\u201d he says, putting it on the low coffee table near the couch. \u201dWe\u2019re both going to be dying of hangover in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Lucas almost winces. \u201dYeah, God,\u201d he says, and it makes Eliott grin. \u201dSee you in the morning, then, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201dGoodnight,\u201d Eliott says, and goes to his room, and that\u2019s that. Lucas turns off the light, flashes his phone\u2019s flashlight to not walk into any piece of furniture as he stumbles back to the couch, then gets under the blanket. The springs in the couch squeak whenever he moves, but he melts into the cushions anyway. He\u2019s tired and heavy. Still slightly tipsy, probably. Sleep, surprisingly, comes easy, for once.</p><p>His last thought, before he drifts off, is, <i>I hope it doesn\u2019t get weird between us</i>.</p><p>*</p><p><br/>It does not, in fact, get weird between them.</p><p>Lucas wakes up feeling disoriented and a bit like he\u2019s dying, gulps down the glass of water standing on the coffee table, and only then realises where he is and why. His first thought is <i>fuck</i>. His second thought is <i>sweet motherfucking Jesus Christ, I slept with Eliott.</i></p><p>Which \u2014 it\u2019s mortifying. He closes his eyes as the memories flood him, and he can <i>feel</i> his face getting red, because what the <i>fuck</i> was he thinking? Why the fuck did he offer that? He will never be able to look Eliott in the face again, oh God. Their friendship is fucking ruined.</p><p>Or, so Lucas thinks. But when he drags himself, miraculously, up from the couch and out of the living room because he feels like he might die if he doesn\u2019t get himself another glass of water, he finds Eliott in the kitchen, cooking something on the stove. Eliott turns at the noise Lucas makes by the door and his first reaction is to smile.</p><p>Lucas looks at his face for one millisecond before turning his gaze away, thinking, <i>what have I done</i>.</p><p>\u201dI didn\u2019t realise you were up already,\u201d Eliott tells him, and he sounds like he always does. \u201dI made breakfast, if you want some?\u201d</p><p>Lucas stares at the ground, then at his \u2014 Eliott\u2019s \u2014 rolled up pyjama pants. He makes a non-committal, a neither-here-nor-there noise in response, and Eliott fucking <i>chuckles</i>.</p><p>\u201dHalf-dead to the world, I see,\u201d he says. \u201dThe breakfast\u2019s not much, but I hope it\u2019s not gonna kill you off completely.\u201d</p><p>Lucas doesn\u2019t\u2014 know what to think. Eliott turns back to the stove and Lucas lifts his eyes to him then, feeling so out of it it\u2019s ridiculous and silly and confused and\u2014</p><p>And Eliott sounds like they didn\u2019t fucking sleep together last night. He&rsquo;s acting like he didn\u2019t kiss Lucas right here in the kitchen, like they didn\u2019t stumble to the bedroom afterwards, like Lucas didn\u2019t offer to be his goddamn rebound after he\u2019d just broken up with his girlfriend. He\u2019s acting like Lucas stayed over because he missed his bus, or because they stayed up too late talking or some shit, not because they had <i>sex</i>. He\u2019s acting like he doesn\u2019t remember.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t he remember?</p><p>Lucas shuffles to the table on autopilot and sits down heavily and his mind is reeling at such high speed that he actually startles when Eliott puts a plate of scrambled eggs in front of him.</p><p>\u201dUm,\u201d he says, and his voice sounds like the Sahara desert would sound if it was audible. \u201dThanks.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sits across from him, and when Lucas dares to look at him, very, very quickly, he seems\u2014completely normal. A little disheveled, okay, and messy from just getting up, but other than that, completely fine. It\u2019s both unnerving and relieving to see when Lucas is about to have a breakdown himself.</p><p>\u201dDid you sleep well?\u201d Eliott asks.</p><p>Lucas wants to say, <i>I am about to burn alive from all the shame I\u2019m feeling</i>. He also wants to say, <i>do you remember what happened? Do you remember that we slept together? Do you remember when you kissed me, here in this room, and when we went to your room and fucked?</i></p><p>Instead, he says, \u201dYour couch sucks.\u201d</p><p>He watches as Eliott\u2019s face scrunches up in a laugh, and relief starts to ease his nerves at that, shyly. Surprisingly, too.</p><p>\u201dStill better than walking back home at 3 in the morning, if you ask me,\u201d Eliott tells him, and shit \u2014 so he <i>does</i> remember. He has to, if he remembers that he said it, after. He remembers but chooses not to mention it, then. Acts like it didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>It leaves a little bit of a weird feeling in the pit of his stomach, but Lucas\u2014 Lucas can roll with that.</p><p>\u201dI would\u2019ve been fine,\u201d he says, rolling his eyes. Eliott raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201dWell, fortunately, you didn\u2019t have to test that theory,\u201d is his reply. \u201dWhich, no, you don\u2019t have to thank me for, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lets himself smile a little. His nerves are boiling down to embers, now, even if the strange feeling is still there. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s gonna be fine. \u201dYeah, well, anyway,\u201d he says, \u201ddo you have coffee?\u201d</p><p>So. They don\u2019t talk about it.</p><p>Later, Lucas changes out of the makeshift pyjamas he\u2019s wearing and back into his own clothes and looks around the room for this phone while Eliott makes fun of his morning bedhead. Lucas brushes his teeth with a spare toothbrush he finds in Eliott\u2019s bathroom, stares at himself in the mirror for a second too long but chooses to ignore it, then puts his shoes and jacket on, pats his pockets down to make sure he still has his wallet, and goes. As he leaves, Eliott waves at him with a small smile on his lips, saying, \u201dSee you soon, yeah?\u201d</p><p>And as Lucas scrambles down the steps and then hurries to the bus stop, he thinks, <i>it\u2019s fine</i>. They didn\u2019t talk about it, but it\u2019s fine. Maybe it&rsquo;s for the better, actually.</p><p>Not like it\u2019s going to happen again, anyway.</p>",

Mika keeps pestering him about it, which only makes it all worse.</p><p>Lucas is doing so great.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He shifts on the couch, the room around him swaying a little like he\u2019s underwater, and then he feels a weight of someone drop onto the couch next to him. Somehow, he\u2019s closed his eyes without realising. When he opens them, he\u2019s greeted with the sigh of Eliott.</p><p>\u201dHey,\u201d the boy says. He smells like cigarette smoke and clean fresh air of the night like he\u2019s been outside and has only now come back in. Maybe he has, anyway. Lucas wouldn\u2019t know. \u201dYou having fun?\u201d</p><p>Lucas says, \u201dA mental breakdown is what I\u2019m having.\u201d</p><p>It makes Eliott smirk, but it\u2019s a weak smile, barely there and gone. It\u2019s not what Lucas is used to, from Eliott. \u201dLike everyone here, tonight.\u201d</p><p>He has a point, Lucas thinks. Eliott\u2019s personal reason for hosting their pathetic little get-together is his recent breakup with Lucille. Which, honestly, has happened before, but Eliott claims that it\u2019s for good this time and, judging how out of it he seems to be, there might be some truth to the words. Lucas notices, with a small part of his mind, that the usual spark in Eliott\u2019s eyes is dulled and unfitting. He looks like he\u2019s wearing pyjamas; his apartment is even more of a mess than usual.</p><p>\u201dAre you feeling any better?\u201d Lucas asks.</p><p>Eliott almost winces this time, then turns straight ahead and stares at the TV at the other side of the room, across from them. It\u2019s turned off. \u201dNot really, no.\u201d</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i>, Lucas kind of wants to say, but stops himself. Eliott doesn\u2019t like pity, he knows. And anyway, it\u2019s more than possible for him and Lucille to get back together by the end of the week. It\u2019s happened before. They\u2019re that kind of couple, one where they argue a lot but always come back to each other in the end.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s not nice, what Lucas is thinking. He tries to backtrack, sluggishly sorts his thoughts into something else. What he comes up with is, \u201dDo you want to watch something?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a stupid suggestion and he only says it because Eliott keeps looking at the black screen of the TV like he\u2019s waiting for it to come to life on its own, and somehow Lucas decides that the idea fits, then. Eliott turns and looks at him. \u201dWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYou keep looking at the TV but it\u2019s not on,\u201d Lucas points out his thoughts, very intelligently. He trips over the words a little. \u201dMight as well watch something.\u201d</p><p>Eliott looks around the room where Idriss is mixing at least three different liquids in his cup and where Basile is in the middle of gulping down yet another drink while staring at his phone in the half-dark, and appears to come to a conclusion. \u201dYeah, I guess. What do you want to watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201dAnything but one of your pretentious boring films,\u201d Lucas says. Eliott shoots him a glare and he grins at him because they\u2019ve had this conversation before and Eliott\u2019s fun to tease. \u201dWhatever\u2019s on TV. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201dAlright,\u201d Eliott agrees, and turns the TV on, and there they go.</p><p>*</p><p>They end up watching reruns of some stupid talk show, and it\u2019s loud enough to lure Yann, Arthur, and Sofiane out of the kitchen and join them in the room, which quickly just turns into them running a commentary about everything and nothing. Yann confiscates Basile\u2019s phone for, he says, Basile\u2019s own good. Sofiane makes a mistake of agreeing to try Idriss\u2019s weird drink concoction and it makes him cough violently after taking only one sip. Lucas just laughs at it all; Eliott leans more heavily into his side as he does and reaches into his own pocket to light another cigarette.</p><p>The night stretches, then lingers into late hours, and then the guys go home, one after another, and somehow Lucas misses the moment when he becomes the only one left in Eliott\u2019s presence.</p><p>It\u2019s cool. He\u2019s a little wobbly on his feet but offers to help clean up, and they gather the empty glasses and bottles and go to the kitchen to wash them all. Well, Eliott washes them, anyway, even though he\u2019s almost as unsteady as Lucas at this point, from all the alcohol. Lucas hops onto the countertop next to the sink and watches him struggle through the cleaning process, giggling. The room around him is swaying. He keeps looking at Eliott\u2019s hands, his long fingers, strong wrists, watches as Eliott finishes up and dries his hands with a towel.</p><p>The night is warm and comfortable and pleasantly hazy.</p><p>\u201dAre you done?\u201d Lucas asks, despite it being clear that yes, Eliott\u2019s in fact finished, because being a little shit is funny. He swings his legs, kicks at the kitchen cupboards. Eliott raises an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201dWhat, did you get tired of watching me clean?\u201d he says, stepping away from the sink and closer to where Lucas\u2019s sitting, props a hand on his hip. \u201dThanks for the help, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI mean, you hosted the party so,\u201d Lucas shrugs, \u201dI don\u2019t know what you were expecting.\u201d</p><p>He thinks his words are slurring together, a little bit, but he\u2019s not sure. Or doesn\u2019t care, same thing. Eliott looks like he\u2019s fighting a smile, for some reason. It makes Lucas want to smile, too.</p><p>\u201dWow, what a good friend you are,\u201d he says, and Lucas shrugs in response.</p><p>\u201dI know, right,\u201d he tells Eliott. The smile breaks out on Eliott\u2019s face, at that. It\u2019s very pretty, Lucas thinks hazily. \u201dAnd anyway, you did a great job all by yourself. Not like you needed me.\u201d</p><p>He kicks at the cupboards again, just for the sake of it, which makes Eliott reach out and squeeze his knee in an attempt to stop him. Somehow, he\u2019s standing right in front of Lucas now. Lucas missed the moment he moved.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m that good, huh,\u201d Eliott says. His smile looks easy. More than tipsy. Lucas lets his head fall back until it hits the wall, then looks at Eliott like that. The room\u2019s spinning a little less.</p><p>\u201dYeah,\u201d he agrees, kicks the cupboard again. Eliott grips his other knee, too, steady, takes half a step closer. \u201dThe perfect guy, you.\u201d</p><p>And then Eliott\u2019s kissing him.</p><p>Lucas doesn\u2019t register what\u2019s happening at first. Eliott moves one hand to cup the side of his face, slides the other up his thigh, and he\u2019s warm and solid and he\u2019s kissing him. Lucas\u2019s head swims, and he tangles his fingers in Eliott\u2019s hair on autopilot, kisses him back and they\u2019re drunk and they\u2019re kissing and Lucas only really catches up on what\u2019s going on when Eliott abruptly moves away.</p><p>\u201dShit, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Eliott breathes out. Lucas\u2019s gaze drops to his mouth and stays there for a second too long before traveling up to his eyes. They\u2019re wide. Eliott\u2019s blinking fast. \u201dI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know why I did that, fuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dNo, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d Lucas starts, doesn\u2019t finish. His hands are still in Eliott\u2019s hair; he keeps them there. \u201dIt\u2019s fine. I mean, it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>Eliott moves his hand away from Lucas\u2019s thigh, but then his fingers freeze mid-motion. \u201dIt\u2019s cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah, I mean\u2014\u201d Lucas stutters and he can\u2019t stop his eyes from dropping to Eliott\u2019s mouth again. Everything feels blurry, like he\u2019s looking at the room through fogged up glass, except it translates into a feeling and not a sight. And then he says what he says because he\u2019s stressed and tired and fucking drunk. The thought just comes so he lets it out. \u201dDon\u2019t you, like, need a rebound, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Eliott\u2019s gaze flits all over Lucas\u2019s face like he\u2019s looking for something there. Lucas doesn\u2019t know if he finds it, whatever it is. \u201dWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201dDon\u2019t you need a rebound?\u201d he repeats. He wonders if what he\u2019s saying sounds stupid. He can\u2019t tell. \u201dThat\u2019s the best way to get over someone, right? And fuck Lucille, anyway. What was she thinking, breaking up with you like that, like why did you even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dLucas, what\u2014\u201d Eliott starts and then hiccups, suddenly. His hand lands back on Lucas\u2019s thigh. Lucas wonders, absentmindedly, how much has Eliott drunk tonight. \u201dWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>What <i>is</i> he saying, really? Jesus. He can\u2019t stop fucking looking at Eliott\u2019s lips. \u201dYou can say no if you don\u2019t want to, I\u2019m not gonna be mad, we\u2019re friends,\u201d he assures, rakes a hand through Eliott\u2019s hair, pushes it out of his eyes. Eliott doesn\u2019t stop him, just keeps looking at him. \u201dAnd it\u2019s not like I\u2019m offering just because, or whatever, I\u2019m just saying that I could use a distraction myself, I\u2019ve been fucking stressed, dude, and clearly there\u2019s something in this for the both of us, and since I don\u2019t think I completely disgust you because you\u2019ve just kissed me, right, so yeah\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas is faintly aware that he\u2019s babbling, but he doesn\u2019t really care. Is he making an idiot out of himself? Maybe. But Eliott moves his hand up to his thigh, looking like he\u2019s not even aware of it, and then he\u2019s saying, \u201dFuck, damn it,\u201d and then Lucas is being kissed again, Eliott muscling his way between Lucas\u2019s thighs, and they\u2019re full-on making out in Eliott\u2019s tiny kitchen. Time goes wobbly \u2014 Eliott licks into Lucas\u2019s mouth and swallows whatever faint sounds Lucas makes, and they keep kissing and kissing until Lucas snakes a hand under Eliott\u2019s t-shirt and Eliott tugs him off the kitchen counter then, mutters, \u201dWe\u2019re out of here,\u201d in between kisses and Lucas only breathes a \u201dYeah?\u201d, lets himself be pulled to Eliott\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He ends up face down Eliott\u2019s rumpled sheets, later, swallowing down a moan as Eliott pushes in and then biting his lips when Eliott starts to move and when muffling his whimpers in the bedding when they get gradually louder. Eliott holds his hips down, builds up a rhythm that has Lucas shaking within minutes, quick, shallow thrusts that make Lucas\u2019s skin crawl with need and drive him up near the edge embarrassingly quickly. It\u2019s that and the alcohol, he tells himself, a thought barely there in the haze of his mind, and then Eliott snaps his hips up, faster still, and Lucas barely has enough time to moan out a choked off \u201dI\u2019m gonna\u2014<i>oh</i>\u2014\u201d and barely catches the sound of Eliott\u2019s punched out groan before he comes into his own hand, trembling.</p><p>Eliott follows him closely after, grip tightening on Lucas\u2019s hips as he comes, and he lets himself slump onto Lucas for only a couple of seconds before he catches himself on the bed and carefully pulls out, then gets rid of the condom.</p><p>Lucas flops onto his back, shakily, breathing unsteady. He thinks, <i>oh God</i>, and then, for good measure, <i>Jesus</i>. He listens to his own breathing. Focuses on getting a grip on his erratic heartbeat. Eliott just kind of sits on the bed next to him for a while, sounds a little out of breath as well. Lucas\u2019s head swims.</p><p>\u201dYou can take a shower if you want,\u201d Eliott says after a while, a hitch from exertion still there in his breath, but not as prominent. Lucas turns to look at him, squinting slightly.</p><p>\u201dI should go home,\u201d he says.</p><p>Eliott rolls his eyes. Lucas faintly notes the colour high in his cheeks. \u201dDon\u2019t be ridiculous, it\u2019s 3 in the morning. There\u2019re no buses until at least 6.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI can walk back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m not letting you walk back home alone in the middle of the night,\u201d Eliott says, then reaches down and grabs his boxers off the floor, puts them on, stands up. Lucas just blinks at him. \u201dGo take a shower. You can sleep on the couch and walk back home in the morning, alright?\u201d</p><p>Lucas blinks again and his eyes stay closed for longer than a blink should last, he thinks. His heartbeat is almost back to normal now. Eliott\u2019s bed is soft. \u201dEliott, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m serious,\u201d Eliott says. He looks very tall. It\u2019s not fair. \u201dYou can go home as soon as the sun rises if you want to. Okay?\u201d And then, not really waiting for Lucas\u2019s answer, Eliott walks out of the room, saying, \u201dThe couch\u2019s pretty comfortable, you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>So yeah. Lucas goes to take a shower.</p><p>The stream of water sobers him up a bit, but his limbs feel heavy. He watches the bubbles of soap go down the drain, swirling, and as the shower door fogs up, his mind clears a little. He stands under the spray until he gets tired of it, then shuts the water off. Eliott has left him a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt by the sink. Lucas feels strangely grateful for the uncalled gesture, even if he has to roll the pants because they\u2019re too long.</p><p>He stumbles out of the bathroom to find Eliott padding out of the kitchen with a glass of water in hand.</p><p>\u201dFor you,\u201d he says, putting it on the low coffee table near the couch. \u201dWe\u2019re both going to be dying of hangover in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Lucas almost winces. \u201dYeah, God,\u201d he says, and it makes Eliott grin. \u201dSee you in the morning, then, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201dGoodnight,\u201d Eliott says, and goes to his room, and that\u2019s that. Lucas turns off the light, flashes his phone\u2019s flashlight to not walk into any piece of furniture as he stumbles back to the couch, then gets under the blanket. The springs in the couch squeak whenever he moves, but he melts into the cushions anyway. He\u2019s tired and heavy. Still slightly tipsy, probably. Sleep, surprisingly, comes easy, for once.</p><p>His last thought, before he drifts off, is, <i>I hope it doesn\u2019t get weird between us</i>.</p><p>*</p><p><br>It does not, in fact, get weird between them.</p><p>Lucas wakes up feeling disoriented and a bit like he\u2019s dying, gulps down the glass of water standing on the coffee table, and only then realises where he is and why. His first thought is <i>fuck</i>. His second thought is <i>sweet motherfucking Jesus Christ, I slept with Eliott.</i></p><p>Which \u2014 it\u2019s mortifying. He closes his eyes as the memories flood him, and he can <i>feel</i> his face getting red, because what the <i>fuck</i> was he thinking? Why the fuck did he offer that? He will never be able to look Eliott in the face again, oh God. Their friendship is fucking ruined.</p><p>Or, so Lucas thinks. But when he drags himself, miraculously, up from the couch and out of the living room because he feels like he might die if he doesn\u2019t get himself another glass of water, he finds Eliott in the kitchen, cooking something on the stove. Eliott turns at the noise Lucas makes by the door and his first reaction is to smile.</p><p>Lucas looks at his face for one millisecond before turning his gaze away, thinking, <i>what have I done</i>.</p><p>\u201dI didn\u2019t realise you were up already,\u201d Eliott tells him, and he sounds like he always does. \u201dI made breakfast, if you want some?\u201d</p><p>Lucas stares at the ground, then at his \u2014 Eliott\u2019s \u2014 rolled up pyjama pants. He makes a non-committal, a neither-here-nor-there noise in response, and Eliott fucking <i>chuckles</i>.</p><p>\u201dHalf-dead to the world, I see,\u201d he says. \u201dThe breakfast\u2019s not much, but I hope it\u2019s not gonna kill you off completely.\u201d</p><p>Lucas doesn\u2019t\u2014 know what to think. Eliott turns back to the stove and Lucas lifts his eyes to him then, feeling so out of it it\u2019s ridiculous and silly and confused and\u2014</p><p>And Eliott sounds like they didn\u2019t fucking sleep together last night. He\u2019s acting like he didn\u2019t kiss Lucas right here in the kitchen, like they didn\u2019t stumble to the bedroom afterwards, like Lucas didn\u2019t offer to be his goddamn rebound after he\u2019d just broken up with his girlfriend. He\u2019s acting like Lucas stayed over because he missed his bus, or because they stayed up too late talking or some shit, not because they had <i>sex</i>. He\u2019s acting like he doesn\u2019t remember.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t he remember?</p><p>Lucas shuffles to the table on autopilot and sits down heavily and his mind is reeling at such high speed that he actually startles when Eliott puts a plate of scrambled eggs in front of him.</p><p>\u201dUm,\u201d he says, and his voice sounds like the Sahara desert would sound if it was audible. \u201dThanks.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sits across from him, and when Lucas dares to look at him, very, very quickly, he seems\u2014completely normal. A little disheveled, okay, and messy from just getting up, but other than that, completely fine. It\u2019s both unnerving and relieving to see when Lucas is about to have a breakdown himself.</p><p>\u201dDid you sleep well?\u201d Eliott asks.</p><p>Lucas wants to say, <i>I am about to burn alive from all the shame I\u2019m feeling</i>. He also wants to say, <i>do you remember what happened? Do you remember that we slept together? Do you remember when you kissed me, here in this room, and when we went to your room and fucked?</i></p><p>Instead, he says, \u201dYour couch sucks.\u201d</p><p>He watches as Eliott\u2019s face scrunches up in a laugh, and relief starts to ease his nerves at that, shyly. Surprisingly, too.</p><p>\u201dStill better than walking back home at 3 in the morning, if you ask me,\u201d Eliott tells him, and shit \u2014 so he <i>does</i> remember. He has to, if he remembers that he said it, after. He remembers but chooses not to mention it, then. Acts like it didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>It leaves a little bit of a weird feeling in the pit of his stomach, but Lucas\u2014 Lucas can roll with that.</p><p>\u201dI would\u2019ve been fine,\u201d he says, rolling his eyes. Eliott raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201dWell, fortunately, you didn\u2019t have to test that theory,\u201d is his reply. \u201dWhich, no, you don\u2019t have to thank me for, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lets himself smile a little. His nerves are boiling down to embers, now, even if the strange feeling is still there. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s gonna be fine. \u201dYeah, well, anyway,\u201d he says, \u201ddo you have coffee?\u201d</p><p>So. They don\u2019t talk about it.</p><p>Later, Lucas changes out of the makeshift pyjamas he\u2019s wearing and back into his own clothes and looks around the room for this phone while Eliott makes fun of his morning bedhead. Lucas brushes his teeth with a spare toothbrush he finds in Eliott\u2019s bathroom, stares at himself in the mirror for a second too long but chooses to ignore it, then puts his shoes and jacket on, pats his pockets down to make sure he still has his wallet, and goes. As he leaves, Eliott waves at him with a small smile on his lips, saying, \u201dSee you soon, yeah?\u201d</p><p>And as Lucas scrambles down the steps and then hurries to the bus stop, he thinks, <i>it\u2019s fine</i>. They didn\u2019t talk about it, but it\u2019s fine. Maybe it\u2019s for the better, actually.</p><p>Not like it\u2019s going to happen again, anyway.</p></p>",

Basile is moping, half-lying on the floor, the third day in a row after Daphn\u00e9 had broken up with him. Idriss is in the middle of downing another one of his awful drinks. Lucas can hear Yann, Sofiane, and Arthur from all the way in the kitchen, arguing about something, and their voices are just on the side of loud that it\u2019s starting to get on Lucas\u2019s nerves. He takes another swing from the bottle, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and then lets his head fall back, stares at the cracks on the ceiling, fails to count them because he\u2019s very tipsy and very tired.</p><p>He can\u2019t remember the last time he wasn\u2019t stressed over something. The workload he has to deal with if he wants to pass his classes threatens his sanity on a daily basis. His dad hasn\u2019t transferred him money this month yet, and Lucas doesn\u2019t want to explicitly ask for it because theoretically, he has a job, but he doesn\u2019t make enough to cover all the expenses and then rent, too, so there\u2019s that. His mom has sent him about 20 messages today, all biblical and more cryptic than what he\u2019s used to, and when he tried calling her, she didn\u2019t pick up, which can only mean that she\u2019s been doing worse than usual. He hasn\u2019t been sleeping, really, and the bags under his eyes are starting to look more like bruises than anything else at this point. Mika keeps pestering him about it, which only makes it all worse.</p><p>Lucas is doing so great.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He shifts on the couch, the room around him swaying a little like he\u2019s underwater, and then he feels a weight of someone drop onto the couch next to him. Somehow, he\u2019s closed his eyes without realising. When he opens them, he\u2019s greeted with the sigh of Eliott.</p><p>\u201dHey,\u201d the boy says. He smells like cigarette smoke and clean fresh air of the night like he\u2019s been outside and has only now come back in. Maybe he has, anyway. Lucas wouldn\u2019t know. \u201dYou having fun?\u201d</p><p>Lucas says, \u201dA mental breakdown is what I\u2019m having.\u201d</p><p>It makes Eliott smirk, but it\u2019s a weak smile, barely there and gone. It\u2019s not what Lucas is used to, from Eliott. \u201dLike everyone here, tonight.\u201d</p><p>He has a point, Lucas thinks. Eliott\u2019s personal reason for hosting their pathetic little get-together is his recent breakup with Lucille. Which, honestly, has happened before, but Eliott claims that it\u2019s for good this time and, judging how out of it he seems to be, there might be some truth to the words. Lucas notices, with a small part of his mind, that the usual spark in Eliott\u2019s eyes is dulled and unfitting. He looks like he\u2019s wearing pyjamas; his apartment is even more of a mess than usual.</p><p>\u201dAre you feeling any better?\u201d Lucas asks.</p><p>Eliott almost winces this time, then turns straight ahead and stares at the TV at the other side of the room, across from them. It\u2019s turned off. \u201dNot really, no.\u201d</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i>, Lucas kind of wants to say, but stops himself. Eliott doesn\u2019t like pity, he knows. And anyway, it\u2019s more than possible for him and Lucille to get back together by the end of the week. It\u2019s happened before. They\u2019re that kind of couple, one where they argue a lot but always come back to each other in the end.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s not nice, what Lucas is thinking. He tries to backtrack, sluggishly sorts his thoughts into something else. What he comes up with is, \u201dDo you want to watch something?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a stupid suggestion and he only says it because Eliott keeps looking at the black screen of the TV like he\u2019s waiting for it to come to life on its own, and somehow Lucas decides that the idea fits, then. Eliott turns and looks at him. \u201dWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYou keep looking at the TV but it\u2019s not on,\u201d Lucas points out his thoughts, very intelligently. He trips over the words a little. \u201dMight as well watch something.\u201d</p><p>Eliott looks around the room where Idriss is mixing at least three different liquids in his cup and where Basile is in the middle of gulping down yet another drink while staring at his phone in the half-dark, and appears to come to a conclusion. \u201dYeah, I guess. What do you want to watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201dAnything but one of your pretentious boring films,\u201d Lucas says. Eliott shoots him a glare and he grins at him because they\u2019ve had this conversation before and Eliott\u2019s fun to tease. \u201dWhatever\u2019s on TV. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201dAlright,\u201d Eliott agrees, and turns the TV on, and there they go.</p><p>*</p><p>They end up watching reruns of some stupid talk show, and it\u2019s loud enough to lure Yann, Arthur, and Sofiane out of the kitchen and join them in the room, which quickly just turns into them running a commentary about everything and nothing. Yann confiscates Basile\u2019s phone for, he says, Basile\u2019s own good. Sofiane makes a mistake of agreeing to try Idriss\u2019s weird drink concoction and it makes him cough violently after taking only one sip. Lucas just laughs at it all; Eliott leans more heavily into his side as he does and reaches into his own pocket to light another cigarette.</p><p>The night stretches, then lingers into late hours, and then the guys go home, one after another, and somehow Lucas misses the moment when he becomes the only one left in Eliott\u2019s presence.</p><p>It\u2019s cool. He\u2019s a little wobbly on his feet but offers to help clean up, and they gather the empty glasses and bottles and go to the kitchen to wash them all. Well, Eliott washes them, anyway, even though he\u2019s almost as unsteady as Lucas at this point, from all the alcohol. Lucas hops onto the countertop next to the sink and watches him struggle through the cleaning process, giggling. The room around him is swaying. He keeps looking at Eliott\u2019s hands, his long fingers, strong wrists, watches as Eliott finishes up and dries his hands with a towel.</p><p>The night is warm and comfortable and pleasantly hazy.</p><p>\u201dAre you done?\u201d Lucas asks, despite it being clear that yes, Eliott\u2019s in fact finished, because being a little shit is funny. He swings his legs, kicks at the kitchen cupboards. Eliott raises an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201dWhat, did you get tired of watching me clean?\u201d he says, stepping away from the sink and closer to where Lucas\u2019s sitting, props a hand on his hip. \u201dThanks for the help, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI mean, you hosted the party so,\u201d Lucas shrugs, \u201dI don\u2019t know what you were expecting.\u201d</p><p>He thinks his words are slurring together, a little bit, but he\u2019s not sure. Or doesn\u2019t care, same thing. Eliott looks like he\u2019s fighting a smile, for some reason. It makes Lucas want to smile, too.</p><p>\u201dWow, what a good friend you are,\u201d he says, and Lucas shrugs in response.</p><p>\u201dI know, right,\u201d he tells Eliott. The smile breaks out on Eliott\u2019s face, at that. It\u2019s very pretty, Lucas thinks hazily. \u201dAnd anyway, you did a great job all by yourself. Not like you needed me.\u201d</p><p>He kicks at the cupboards again, just for the sake of it, which makes Eliott reach out and squeeze his knee in an attempt to stop him. Somehow, he\u2019s standing right in front of Lucas now. Lucas missed the moment he moved.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m that good, huh,\u201d Eliott says. His smile looks easy. More than tipsy. Lucas lets his head fall back until it hits the wall, then looks at Eliott like that. The room\u2019s spinning a little less.</p><p>\u201dYeah,\u201d he agrees, kicks the cupboard again. Eliott grips his other knee, too, steady, takes half a step closer. \u201dThe perfect guy, you.\u201d</p><p>And then Eliott\u2019s kissing him.</p><p>Lucas doesn\u2019t register what\u2019s happening at first. Eliott moves one hand to cup the side of his face, slides the other up his thigh, and he\u2019s warm and solid and he\u2019s kissing him. Lucas\u2019s head swims, and he tangles his fingers in Eliott\u2019s hair on autopilot, kisses him back and they\u2019re drunk and they\u2019re kissing and Lucas only really catches up on what\u2019s going on when Eliott abruptly moves away.</p><p>\u201dShit, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Eliott breathes out. Lucas\u2019s gaze drops to his mouth and stays there for a second too long before traveling up to his eyes. They\u2019re wide. Eliott\u2019s blinking fast. \u201dI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know why I did that, fuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dNo, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d Lucas starts, doesn\u2019t finish. His hands are still in Eliott\u2019s hair; he keeps them there. \u201dIt\u2019s fine. I mean, it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>Eliott moves his hand away from Lucas\u2019s thigh, but then his fingers freeze mid-motion. \u201dIt\u2019s cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah, I mean\u2014\u201d Lucas stutters and he can\u2019t stop his eyes from dropping to Eliott\u2019s mouth again. Everything feels blurry, like he\u2019s looking at the room through fogged up glass, except it translates into a feeling and not a sight. And then he says what he says because he\u2019s stressed and tired and fucking drunk. The thought just comes so he lets it out. \u201dDon\u2019t you, like, need a rebound, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Eliott\u2019s gaze flits all over Lucas\u2019s face like he\u2019s looking for something there. Lucas doesn\u2019t know if he finds it, whatever it is. \u201dWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201dDon\u2019t you need a rebound?\u201d he repeats. He wonders if what he\u2019s saying sounds stupid. He can\u2019t tell. \u201dThat\u2019s the best way to get over someone, right? And fuck Lucille, anyway. What was she thinking, breaking up with you like that, like why did you even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dLucas, what\u2014\u201d Eliott starts and then hiccups, suddenly. His hand lands back on Lucas\u2019s thigh. Lucas wonders, absentmindedly, how much has Eliott drunk tonight. \u201dWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>What <i>is</i> he saying, really? Jesus. He can\u2019t stop fucking looking at Eliott\u2019s lips. \u201dYou can say no if you don\u2019t want to, I\u2019m not gonna be mad, we\u2019re friends,\u201d he assures, rakes a hand through Eliott\u2019s hair, pushes it out of his eyes. Eliott doesn\u2019t stop him, just keeps looking at him. \u201dAnd it\u2019s not like I\u2019m offering just because, or whatever, I\u2019m just saying that I could use a distraction myself, I\u2019ve been fucking stressed, dude, and clearly there\u2019s something in this for the both of us, and since I don\u2019t think I completely disgust you because you\u2019ve just kissed me, right, so yeah\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas is faintly aware that he\u2019s babbling, but he doesn\u2019t really care. Is he making an idiot out of himself? Maybe. But Eliott moves his hand up to his thigh, looking like he\u2019s not even aware of it, and then he\u2019s saying, \u201dFuck, damn it,\u201d and then Lucas is being kissed again, Eliott muscling his way between Lucas\u2019s thighs, and they\u2019re full-on making out in Eliott\u2019s tiny kitchen. Time goes wobbly \u2014 Eliott licks into Lucas\u2019s mouth and swallows whatever faint sounds Lucas makes, and they keep kissing and kissing until Lucas snakes a hand under Eliott\u2019s t-shirt and Eliott tugs him off the kitchen counter then, mutters, \u201dWe\u2019re out of here,\u201d in between kisses and Lucas only breathes a \u201dYeah?\u201d, lets himself be pulled to Eliott\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He ends up face down Eliott\u2019s rumpled sheets, later, swallowing down a moan as Eliott pushes in and then biting his lips when Eliott starts to move and when muffling his whimpers in the bedding when they get gradually louder. Eliott holds his hips down, builds up a rhythm that has Lucas shaking within minutes, quick, shallow thrusts that make Lucas\u2019s skin crawl with need and drive him up near the edge embarrassingly quickly. It\u2019s that and the alcohol, he tells himself, a thought barely there in the haze of his mind, and then Eliott snaps his hips up, faster still, and Lucas barely has enough time to moan out a choked off \u201dI\u2019m gonna\u2014<i>oh</i>\u2014\u201d and barely catches the sound of Eliott\u2019s punched out groan before he comes into his own hand, trembling.</p><p>Eliott follows him closely after, grip tightening on Lucas\u2019s hips as he comes, and he lets himself slump onto Lucas for only a couple of seconds before he catches himself on the bed and carefully pulls out, then gets rid of the condom.</p><p>Lucas flops onto his back, shakily, breathing unsteady. He thinks, <i>oh God</i>, and then, for good measure, <i>Jesus</i>. He listens to his own breathing. Focuses on getting a grip on his erratic heartbeat. Eliott just kind of sits on the bed next to him for a while, sounds a little out of breath as well. Lucas\u2019s head swims.</p><p>\u201dYou can take a shower if you want,\u201d Eliott says after a while, a hitch from exertion still there in his breath, but not as prominent. Lucas turns to look at him, squinting slightly.</p><p>\u201dI should go home,\u201d he says.</p><p>Eliott rolls his eyes. Lucas faintly notes the colour high in his cheeks. \u201dDon\u2019t be ridiculous, it\u2019s 3 in the morning. There\u2019re no buses until at least 6.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI can walk back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m not letting you walk back home alone in the middle of the night,\u201d Eliott says, then reaches down and grabs his boxers off the floor, puts them on, stands up. Lucas just blinks at him. \u201dGo take a shower. You can sleep on the couch and walk back home in the morning, alright?\u201d</p><p>Lucas blinks again and his eyes stay closed for longer than a blink should last, he thinks. His heartbeat is almost back to normal now. Eliott\u2019s bed is soft. \u201dEliott, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m serious,\u201d Eliott says. He looks very tall. It\u2019s not fair. \u201dYou can go home as soon as the sun rises if you want to. Okay?\u201d And then, not really waiting for Lucas\u2019s answer, Eliott walks out of the room, saying, \u201dThe couch\u2019s pretty comfortable, you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>So yeah. Lucas goes to take a shower.</p><p>The stream of water sobers him up a bit, but his limbs feel heavy. He watches the bubbles of soap go down the drain, swirling, and as the shower door fogs up, his mind clears a little. He stands under the spray until he gets tired of it, then shuts the water off. Eliott has left him a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt by the sink. Lucas feels strangely grateful for the uncalled gesture, even if he has to roll the pants because they\u2019re too long.</p><p>He stumbles out of the bathroom to find Eliott padding out of the kitchen with a glass of water in hand.</p><p>\u201dFor you,\u201d he says, putting it on the low coffee table near the couch. \u201dWe\u2019re both going to be dying of hangover in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Lucas almost winces. \u201dYeah, God,\u201d he says, and it makes Eliott grin. \u201dSee you in the morning, then, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201dGoodnight,\u201d Eliott says, and goes to his room, and that\u2019s that. Lucas turns off the light, flashes his phone\u2019s flashlight to not walk into any piece of furniture as he stumbles back to the couch, then gets under the blanket. The springs in the couch squeak whenever he moves, but he melts into the cushions anyway. He\u2019s tired and heavy. Still slightly tipsy, probably. Sleep, surprisingly, comes easy, for once.</p><p>His last thought, before he drifts off, is, <i>I hope it doesn\u2019t get weird between us</i>.</p><p>*</p><p><br>It does not, in fact, get weird between them.</p><p>Lucas wakes up feeling disoriented and a bit like he\u2019s dying, gulps down the glass of water standing on the coffee table, and only then realises where he is and why. His first thought is <i>fuck</i>. His second thought is <i>sweet motherfucking Jesus Christ, I slept with Eliott.</i></p><p>Which \u2014 it\u2019s mortifying. He closes his eyes as the memories flood him, and he can <i>feel</i> his face getting red, because what the <i>fuck</i> was he thinking? Why the fuck did he offer that? He will never be able to look Eliott in the face again, oh God. Their friendship is fucking ruined.</p><p>Or, so Lucas thinks. But when he drags himself, miraculously, up from the couch and out of the living room because he feels like he might die if he doesn\u2019t get himself another glass of water, he finds Eliott in the kitchen, cooking something on the stove. Eliott turns at the noise Lucas makes by the door and his first reaction is to smile.</p><p>Lucas looks at his face for one millisecond before turning his gaze away, thinking, <i>what have I done</i>.</p><p>\u201dI didn\u2019t realise you were up already,\u201d Eliott tells him, and he sounds like he always does. \u201dI made breakfast, if you want some?\u201d</p><p>Lucas stares at the ground, then at his \u2014 Eliott\u2019s \u2014 rolled up pyjama pants. He makes a non-committal, a neither-here-nor-there noise in response, and Eliott fucking <i>chuckles</i>.</p><p>\u201dHalf-dead to the world, I see,\u201d he says. \u201dThe breakfast\u2019s not much, but I hope it\u2019s not gonna kill you off completely.\u201d</p><p>Lucas doesn\u2019t\u2014 know what to think. Eliott turns back to the stove and Lucas lifts his eyes to him then, feeling so out of it it\u2019s ridiculous and silly and confused and\u2014</p><p>And Eliott sounds like they didn\u2019t fucking sleep together last night. He\u2019s acting like he didn\u2019t kiss Lucas right here in the kitchen, like they didn\u2019t stumble to the bedroom afterwards, like Lucas didn\u2019t offer to be his goddamn rebound after he\u2019d just broken up with his girlfriend. He\u2019s acting like Lucas stayed over because he missed his bus, or because they stayed up too late talking or some shit, not because they had <i>sex</i>. He\u2019s acting like he doesn\u2019t remember.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t he remember?</p><p>Lucas shuffles to the table on autopilot and sits down heavily and his mind is reeling at such high speed that he actually startles when Eliott puts a plate of scrambled eggs in front of him.</p><p>\u201dUm,\u201d he says, and his voice sounds like the Sahara desert would sound if it was audible. \u201dThanks.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sits across from him, and when Lucas dares to look at him, very, very quickly, he seems\u2014completely normal. A little disheveled, okay, and messy from just getting up, but other than that, completely fine. It\u2019s both unnerving and relieving to see when Lucas is about to have a breakdown himself.</p><p>\u201dDid you sleep well?\u201d Eliott asks.</p><p>Lucas wants to say, <i>I am about to burn alive from all the shame I\u2019m feeling</i>. He also wants to say, <i>do you remember what happened? Do you remember that we slept together? Do you remember when you kissed me, here in this room, and when we went to your room and fucked?</i></p><p>Instead, he says, \u201dYour couch sucks.\u201d</p><p>He watches as Eliott\u2019s face scrunches up in a laugh, and relief starts to ease his nerves at that, shyly. Surprisingly, too.</p><p>\u201dStill better than walking back home at 3 in the morning, if you ask me,\u201d Eliott tells him, and shit \u2014 so he <i>does</i> remember. He has to, if he remembers that he said it, after. He remembers but chooses not to mention it, then. Acts like it didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>It leaves a little bit of a weird feeling in the pit of his stomach, but Lucas\u2014 Lucas can roll with that.</p><p>\u201dI would\u2019ve been fine,\u201d he says, rolling his eyes. Eliott raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201dWell, fortunately, you didn\u2019t have to test that theory,\u201d is his reply. \u201dWhich, no, you don\u2019t have to thank me for, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lets himself smile a little. His nerves are boiling down to embers, now, even if the strange feeling is still there. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s gonna be fine. \u201dYeah, well, anyway,\u201d he says, \u201ddo you have coffee?\u201d</p><p>So. They don\u2019t talk about it.</p><p>Later, Lucas changes out of the makeshift pyjamas he\u2019s wearing and back into his own clothes and looks around the room for this phone while Eliott makes fun of his morning bedhead. Lucas brushes his teeth with a spare toothbrush he finds in Eliott\u2019s bathroom, stares at himself in the mirror for a second too long but chooses to ignore it, then puts his shoes and jacket on, pats his pockets down to make sure he still has his wallet, and goes. As he leaves, Eliott waves at him with a small smile on his lips, saying, \u201dSee you soon, yeah?\u201d</p><p>And as Lucas scrambles down the steps and then hurries to the bus stop, he thinks, <i>it\u2019s fine</i>. They didn\u2019t talk about it, but it\u2019s fine. Maybe it\u2019s for the better, actually.</p><p>Not like it\u2019s going to happen again, anyway.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2><i><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19321132/chapters/45958216\" target=\"_blank\">things i forgot to tell you (ch. 1 &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s no rush&rdquo;)</a></i></h2><p><br /></p><p>It starts like this &mdash; they&rsquo;re having a pity party, as Arthur calls it at one point, and Lucas is getting drunk.</p><p>He&rsquo;s curled up on the couch in Eliott&rsquo;s living room with his third bottle of beer this night, and honestly, the picture around him looks just as sad as he probably does himself. Basile is moping, half-lying on the floor, the third day in a row after Daphn&eacute; had broken up with him. Idriss is in the middle of downing another one of his awful drinks. Lucas can hear Yann, Sofiane, and Arthur from all the way in the kitchen, arguing about something, and their voices are just on the side of loud that it&rsquo;s starting to get on Lucas&rsquo;s nerves. He takes another swing from the bottle, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and then lets his head fall back, stares at the cracks on the ceiling, fails to count them because he&rsquo;s very tipsy and very tired.</p><p>He can&rsquo;t remember the last time he wasn&rsquo;t stressed over something. The workload he has to deal with if he wants to pass his classes threatens his sanity on a daily basis. His dad hasn&rsquo;t transferred him money this month yet, and Lucas doesn&rsquo;t want to explicitly ask for it because theoretically, he has a job, but he doesn&rsquo;t make enough to cover all the expenses and then rent, too, so there&rsquo;s that. His mom has sent him about 20 messages today, all biblical and more cryptic than what he&rsquo;s used to, and when he tried calling her, she didn&rsquo;t pick up, which can only mean that she&rsquo;s been doing worse than usual. He hasn&rsquo;t been sleeping, really, and the bags under his eyes are starting to look more like bruises than anything else at this point. Mika keeps pestering him about it, which only makes it all worse.</p><p>Lucas is doing so great.</p><p>He shifts on the couch, the room around him swaying a little like he&rsquo;s underwater, and then he feels a weight of someone drop onto the couch next to him. Somehow, he&rsquo;s closed his eyes without realising. When he opens them, he&rsquo;s greeted with the sigh of Eliott.</p><p>&rdquo;Hey,&rdquo; the boy says. He smells like cigarette smoke and clean fresh air of the night like he&rsquo;s been outside and has only now come back in. Maybe he has, anyway. Lucas wouldn&rsquo;t know. &rdquo;You having fun?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas says, &rdquo;A mental breakdown is what I&rsquo;m having.&rdquo;</p><p>It makes Eliott smirk, but it&rsquo;s a weak smile, barely there and gone. It&rsquo;s not what Lucas is used to, from Eliott. &rdquo;Like everyone here, tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>He has a point, Lucas thinks. Eliott&rsquo;s personal reason for hosting their pathetic little get-together is his recent breakup with Lucille. Which, honestly, has happened before, but Eliott claims that it&rsquo;s for good this time and, judging how out of it he seems to be, there might be some truth to the words. Lucas notices, with a small part of his mind, that the usual spark in Eliott&rsquo;s eyes is dulled and unfitting. He looks like he&rsquo;s wearing pyjamas; his apartment is even more of a mess than usual.</p><p>&rdquo;Are you feeling any better?&rdquo; Lucas asks.</p><p>Eliott almost winces this time, then turns straight ahead and stares at the TV at the other side of the room, across from them. It&rsquo;s turned off. &rdquo;Not really, no.&rdquo;</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry</i>, Lucas kind of wants to say, but stops himself. Eliott doesn&rsquo;t like pity, he knows. And anyway, it&rsquo;s more than possible for him and Lucille to get back together by the end of the week. It&rsquo;s happened before. They&rsquo;re that kind of couple, one where they argue a lot but always come back to each other in the end.</p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not nice, what Lucas is thinking. He tries to backtrack, sluggishly sorts his thoughts into something else. What he comes up with is, &rdquo;Do you want to watch something?&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s a stupid suggestion and he only says it because Eliott keeps looking at the black screen of the TV like he&rsquo;s waiting for it to come to life on its own, and somehow Lucas decides that the idea fits, then. Eliott turns and looks at him. &rdquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;You keep looking at the TV but it&rsquo;s not on,&rdquo; Lucas points out his thoughts, very intelligently. He trips over the words a little. &rdquo;Might as well watch something.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott looks around the room where Idriss is mixing at least three different liquids in his cup and where Basile is in the middle of gulping down yet another drink while staring at his phone in the half-dark, and appears to come to a conclusion. &rdquo;Yeah, I guess. What do you want to watch?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Anything but one of your pretentious boring films,&rdquo; Lucas says. Eliott shoots him a glare and he grins at him because they&rsquo;ve had this conversation before and Eliott&rsquo;s fun to tease. &rdquo;Whatever&rsquo;s on TV. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Alright,&rdquo; Eliott agrees, and turns the TV on, and there they go.</p><p>*</p><p>They end up watching reruns of some stupid talk show, and it&rsquo;s loud enough to lure Yann, Arthur, and Sofiane out of the kitchen and join them in the room, which quickly just turns into them running a commentary about everything and nothing. Yann confiscates Basile&rsquo;s phone for, he says, Basile&rsquo;s own good. Sofiane makes a mistake of agreeing to try Idriss&rsquo;s weird drink concoction and it makes him cough violently after taking only one sip. Lucas just laughs at it all; Eliott leans more heavily into his side as he does and reaches into his own pocket to light another cigarette.</p><p>The night stretches, then lingers into late hours, and then the guys go home, one after another, and somehow Lucas misses the moment when he becomes the only one left in Eliott&rsquo;s presence.</p><p>It&rsquo;s cool. He&rsquo;s a little wobbly on his feet but offers to help clean up, and they gather the empty glasses and bottles and go to the kitchen to wash them all. Well, Eliott washes them, anyway, even though he&rsquo;s almost as unsteady as Lucas at this point, from all the alcohol. Lucas hops onto the countertop next to the sink and watches him struggle through the cleaning process, giggling. The room around him is swaying. He keeps looking at Eliott&rsquo;s hands, his long fingers, strong wrists, watches as Eliott finishes up and dries his hands with a towel.</p><p>The night is warm and comfortable and pleasantly hazy.</p><p>&rdquo;Are you done?&rdquo; Lucas asks, despite it being clear that yes, Eliott&rsquo;s in fact finished, because being a little shit is funny. He swings his legs, kicks at the kitchen cupboards. Eliott raises an eyebrow at him.</p><p>&rdquo;What, did you get tired of watching me clean?&rdquo; he says, stepping away from the sink and closer to where Lucas&rsquo;s sitting, props a hand on his hip. &rdquo;Thanks for the help, anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;I mean, you hosted the party so,&rdquo; Lucas shrugs, &rdquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you were expecting.&rdquo;</p><p>He thinks his words are slurring together, a little bit, but he&rsquo;s not sure. Or doesn&rsquo;t care, same thing. Eliott looks like he&rsquo;s fighting a smile, for some reason. It makes Lucas want to smile, too.</p><p>&rdquo;Wow, what a good friend you are,&rdquo; he says, and Lucas shrugs in response.</p><p>&rdquo;I know, right,&rdquo; he tells Eliott. The smile breaks out on Eliott&rsquo;s face, at that. It&rsquo;s very pretty, Lucas thinks hazily. &rdquo;And anyway, you did a great job all by yourself. Not like you needed me.&rdquo;</p><p>He kicks at the cupboards again, just for the sake of it, which makes Eliott reach out and squeeze his knee in an attempt to stop him. Somehow, he&rsquo;s standing right in front of Lucas now. Lucas missed the moment he moved.</p><p>&rdquo;I&rsquo;m that good, huh,&rdquo; Eliott says. His smile looks easy. More than tipsy. Lucas lets his head fall back until it hits the wall, then looks at Eliott like that. The room&rsquo;s spinning a little less.</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he agrees, kicks the cupboard again. Eliott grips his other knee, too, steady, takes half a step closer. &rdquo;The perfect guy, you.&rdquo;</p><p>And then Eliott&rsquo;s kissing him.</p><p>Lucas doesn&rsquo;t register what&rsquo;s happening at first. Eliott moves one hand to cup the side of his face, slides the other up his thigh, and he&rsquo;s warm and solid and he&rsquo;s kissing him. Lucas&rsquo;s head swims, and he tangles his fingers in Eliott&rsquo;s hair on autopilot, kisses him back and they&rsquo;re drunk and they&rsquo;re kissing and Lucas only really catches up on what&rsquo;s going on when Eliott abruptly moves away.</p><p>&rdquo;Shit, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Eliott breathes out. Lucas&rsquo;s gaze drops to his mouth and stays there for a second too long before traveling up to his eyes. They&rsquo;re wide. Eliott&rsquo;s blinking fast. &rdquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t know why I did that, fuck&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;No, it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; Lucas starts, doesn&rsquo;t finish. His hands are still in Eliott&rsquo;s hair; he keeps them there. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I mean, it&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott moves his hand away from Lucas&rsquo;s thigh, but then his fingers freeze mid-motion. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s cool?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah, I mean&mdash;&rdquo; Lucas stutters and he can&rsquo;t stop his eyes from dropping to Eliott&rsquo;s mouth again. Everything feels blurry, like he&rsquo;s looking at the room through fogged up glass, except it translates into a feeling and not a sight. And then he says what he says because he&rsquo;s stressed and tired and fucking drunk. The thought just comes so he lets it out. &rdquo;Don&rsquo;t you, like, need a rebound, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott&rsquo;s gaze flits all over Lucas&rsquo;s face like he&rsquo;s looking for something there. Lucas doesn&rsquo;t know if he finds it, whatever it is. &rdquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t you need a rebound?&rdquo; he repeats. He wonders if what he&rsquo;s saying sounds stupid. He can&rsquo;t tell. &rdquo;That&rsquo;s the best way to get over someone, right? And fuck Lucille, anyway. What was she thinking, breaking up with you like that, like why did you even&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Lucas, what&mdash;&rdquo; Eliott starts and then hiccups, suddenly. His hand lands back on Lucas&rsquo;s thigh. Lucas wonders, absentmindedly, how much has Eliott drunk tonight. &rdquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;</p><p>What <i>is</i> he saying, really? Jesus. He can&rsquo;t stop fucking looking at Eliott&rsquo;s lips. &rdquo;You can say no if you don&rsquo;t want to, I&rsquo;m not gonna be mad, we&rsquo;re friends,&rdquo; he assures, rakes a hand through Eliott&rsquo;s hair, pushes it out of his eyes. Eliott doesn&rsquo;t stop him, just keeps looking at him. &rdquo;And it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m offering just because, or whatever, I&rsquo;m just saying that I could use a distraction myself, I&rsquo;ve been fucking stressed, dude, and clearly there&rsquo;s something in this for the both of us, and since I don&rsquo;t think I completely disgust you because you&rsquo;ve just kissed me, right, so yeah&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas is faintly aware that he&rsquo;s babbling, but he doesn&rsquo;t really care. Is he making an idiot out of himself? Maybe. But Eliott moves his hand up to his thigh, looking like he&rsquo;s not even aware of it, and then he&rsquo;s saying, &rdquo;Fuck, damn it,&rdquo; and then Lucas is being kissed again, Eliott muscling his way between Lucas&rsquo;s thighs, and they&rsquo;re full-on making out in Eliott&rsquo;s tiny kitchen. Time goes wobbly &mdash; Eliott licks into Lucas&rsquo;s mouth and swallows whatever faint sounds Lucas makes, and they keep kissing and kissing until Lucas snakes a hand under Eliott&rsquo;s t-shirt and Eliott tugs him off the kitchen counter then, mutters, &rdquo;We&rsquo;re out of here,&rdquo; in between kisses and Lucas only breathes a &rdquo;Yeah?&rdquo;, lets himself be pulled to Eliott&rsquo;s bedroom.</p><p>He ends up face down Eliott&rsquo;s rumpled sheets, later, swallowing down a moan as Eliott pushes in and then biting his lips when Eliott starts to move and when muffling his whimpers in the bedding when they get gradually louder. Eliott holds his hips down, builds up a rhythm that has Lucas shaking within minutes, quick, shallow thrusts that make Lucas&rsquo;s skin crawl with need and drive him up near the edge embarrassingly quickly. It&rsquo;s that and the alcohol, he tells himself, a thought barely there in the haze of his mind, and then Eliott snaps his hips up, faster still, and Lucas barely has enough time to moan out a choked off &rdquo;I&rsquo;m gonna&mdash;<i>oh</i>&mdash;&rdquo; and barely catches the sound of Eliott&rsquo;s punched out groan before he comes into his own hand, trembling.</p><p>Eliott follows him closely after, grip tightening on Lucas&rsquo;s hips as he comes, and he lets himself slump onto Lucas for only a couple of seconds before he catches himself on the bed and carefully pulls out, then gets rid of the condom.</p><p>Lucas flops onto his back, shakily, breathing unsteady. He thinks, <i>oh God</i>, and then, for good measure, <i>Jesus</i>. He listens to his own breathing. Focuses on getting a grip on his erratic heartbeat. Eliott just kind of sits on the bed next to him for a while, sounds a little out of breath as well. Lucas&rsquo;s head swims.</p><p>&rdquo;You can take a shower if you want,&rdquo; Eliott says after a while, a hitch from exertion still there in his breath, but not as prominent. Lucas turns to look at him, squinting slightly.</p><p>&rdquo;I should go home,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Eliott rolls his eyes. Lucas faintly notes the colour high in his cheeks. &rdquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, it&rsquo;s 3 in the morning. There&rsquo;re no buses until at least 6.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;I can walk back home.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;I&rsquo;m not letting you walk back home alone in the middle of the night,&rdquo; Eliott says, then reaches down and grabs his boxers off the floor, puts them on, stands up. Lucas just blinks at him. &rdquo;Go take a shower. You can sleep on the couch and walk back home in the morning, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas blinks again and his eyes stay closed for longer than a blink should last, he thinks. His heartbeat is almost back to normal now. Eliott&rsquo;s bed is soft. &rdquo;Eliott, it&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ll just go.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;I&rsquo;m serious,&rdquo; Eliott says. He looks very tall. It&rsquo;s not fair. &rdquo;You can go home as soon as the sun rises if you want to. Okay?&rdquo; And then, not really waiting for Lucas&rsquo;s answer, Eliott walks out of the room, saying, &rdquo;The couch&rsquo;s pretty comfortable, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p><p>So yeah. Lucas goes to take a shower.</p><p>The stream of water sobers him up a bit, but his limbs feel heavy. He watches the bubbles of soap go down the drain, swirling, and as the shower door fogs up, his mind clears a little. He stands under the spray until he gets tired of it, then shuts the water off. Eliott has left him a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt by the sink. Lucas feels strangely grateful for the uncalled gesture, even if he has to roll the pants because they&rsquo;re too long.</p><p>He stumbles out of the bathroom to find Eliott padding out of the kitchen with a glass of water in hand.</p><p>&rdquo;For you,&rdquo; he says, putting it on the low coffee table near the couch. &rdquo;We&rsquo;re both going to be dying of hangover in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas almost winces. &rdquo;Yeah, God,&rdquo; he says, and it makes Eliott grin. &rdquo;See you in the morning, then, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; Eliott says, and goes to his room, and that&rsquo;s that. Lucas turns off the light, flashes his phone&rsquo;s flashlight to not walk into any piece of furniture as he stumbles back to the couch, then gets under the blanket. The springs in the couch squeak whenever he moves, but he melts into the cushions anyway. He&rsquo;s tired and heavy. Still slightly tipsy, probably. Sleep, surprisingly, comes easy, for once.</p><p>His last thought, before he drifts off, is, <i>I hope it doesn&rsquo;t get weird between us</i>.</p><p>*</p><p><br />It does not, in fact, get weird between them.</p><p>Lucas wakes up feeling disoriented and a bit like he&rsquo;s dying, gulps down the glass of water standing on the coffee table, and only then realises where he is and why. His first thought is <i>fuck</i>. His second thought is <i>sweet motherfucking Jesus Christ, I slept with Eliott.</i></p><p>Which &mdash; it&rsquo;s mortifying. He closes his eyes as the memories flood him, and he can <i>feel</i> his face getting red, because what the <i>fuck</i> was he thinking? Why the fuck did he offer that? He will never be able to look Eliott in the face again, oh God. Their friendship is fucking ruined.</p><p>Or, so Lucas thinks. But when he drags himself, miraculously, up from the couch and out of the living room because he feels like he might die if he doesn&rsquo;t get himself another glass of water, he finds Eliott in the kitchen, cooking something on the stove. Eliott turns at the noise Lucas makes by the door and his first reaction is to smile.</p><p>Lucas looks at his face for one millisecond before turning his gaze away, thinking, <i>what have I done</i>.</p><p>&rdquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise you were up already,&rdquo; Eliott tells him, and he sounds like he always does. &rdquo;I made breakfast, if you want some?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas stares at the ground, then at his &mdash; Eliott&rsquo;s &mdash; rolled up pyjama pants. He makes a non-committal, a neither-here-nor-there noise in response, and Eliott fucking <i>chuckles</i>.</p><p>&rdquo;Half-dead to the world, I see,&rdquo; he says. &rdquo;The breakfast&rsquo;s not much, but I hope it&rsquo;s not gonna kill you off completely.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas doesn&rsquo;t&mdash; know what to think. Eliott turns back to the stove and Lucas lifts his eyes to him then, feeling so out of it it&rsquo;s ridiculous and silly and confused and&mdash;</p><p>And Eliott sounds like they didn&rsquo;t fucking sleep together last night. He&rsquo;s acting like he didn&rsquo;t kiss Lucas right here in the kitchen, like they didn&rsquo;t stumble to the bedroom afterwards, like Lucas didn&rsquo;t offer to be his goddamn rebound after he&rsquo;d just broken up with his girlfriend. He&rsquo;s acting like Lucas stayed over because he missed his bus, or because they stayed up too late talking or some shit, not because they had <i>sex</i>. He&rsquo;s acting like he doesn&rsquo;t remember.</p><p>Doesn&rsquo;t he remember?</p><p>Lucas shuffles to the table on autopilot and sits down heavily and his mind is reeling at such high speed that he actually startles when Eliott puts a plate of scrambled eggs in front of him.</p><p>&rdquo;Um,&rdquo; he says, and his voice sounds like the Sahara desert would sound if it was audible. &rdquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott sits across from him, and when Lucas dares to look at him, very, very quickly, he seems&mdash;completely normal. A little disheveled, okay, and messy from just getting up, but other than that, completely fine. It&rsquo;s both unnerving and relieving to see when Lucas is about to have a breakdown himself.</p><p>&rdquo;Did you sleep well?&rdquo; Eliott asks.</p><p>Lucas wants to say, <i>I am about to burn alive from all the shame I&rsquo;m feeling</i>. He also wants to say, <i>do you remember what happened? Do you remember that we slept together? Do you remember when you kissed me, here in this room, and when we went to your room and fucked?</i></p><p>Instead, he says, &rdquo;Your couch sucks.&rdquo;</p><p>He watches as Eliott&rsquo;s face scrunches up in a laugh, and relief starts to ease his nerves at that, shyly. Surprisingly, too.</p><p>&rdquo;Still better than walking back home at 3 in the morning, if you ask me,&rdquo; Eliott tells him, and shit &mdash; so he <i>does</i> remember. He has to, if he remembers that he said it, after. He remembers but chooses not to mention it, then. Acts like it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p><p>It leaves a little bit of a weird feeling in the pit of his stomach, but Lucas&mdash; Lucas can roll with that.</p><p>&rdquo;I would&rsquo;ve been fine,&rdquo; he says, rolling his eyes. Eliott raises an eyebrow.</p><p>&rdquo;Well, fortunately, you didn&rsquo;t have to test that theory,&rdquo; is his reply. &rdquo;Which, no, you don&rsquo;t have to thank me for, you&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas lets himself smile a little. His nerves are boiling down to embers, now, even if the strange feeling is still there. It&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s gonna be fine. &rdquo;Yeah, well, anyway,&rdquo; he says, &rdquo;do you have coffee?&rdquo;</p><p>So. They don&rsquo;t talk about it.</p><p>Later, Lucas changes out of the makeshift pyjamas he&rsquo;s wearing and back into his own clothes and looks around the room for this phone while Eliott makes fun of his morning bedhead. Lucas brushes his teeth with a spare toothbrush he finds in Eliott&rsquo;s bathroom, stares at himself in the mirror for a second too long but chooses to ignore it, then puts his shoes and jacket on, pats his pockets down to make sure he still has his wallet, and goes. As he leaves, Eliott waves at him with a small smile on his lips, saying, &rdquo;See you soon, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>And as Lucas scrambles down the steps and then hurries to the bus stop, he thinks, <i>it&rsquo;s fine</i>. They didn&rsquo;t talk about it, but it&rsquo;s fine. Maybe it&rsquo;s for the better, actually.</p><p>Not like it&rsquo;s going to happen again, anyway.</p></p>",

Basile is moping, half-lying on the floor, the third day in a row after Daphn&eacute; had broken up with him. Idriss is in the middle of downing another one of his awful drinks. Lucas can hear Yann, Sofiane, and Arthur from all the way in the kitchen, arguing about something, and their voices are just on the side of loud that it&rsquo;s starting to get on Lucas&rsquo;s nerves. He takes another swing from the bottle, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and then lets his head fall back, stares at the cracks on the ceiling, fails to count them because he&rsquo;s very tipsy and very tired.</p>\n<p>He can&rsquo;t remember the last time he wasn&rsquo;t stressed over something. The workload he has to deal with if he wants to pass his classes threatens his sanity on a daily basis. His dad hasn&rsquo;t transferred him money this month yet, and Lucas doesn&rsquo;t want to explicitly ask for it because theoretically, he has a job, but he doesn&rsquo;t make enough to cover all the expenses and then rent, too, so there&rsquo;s that. His mom has sent him about 20 messages today, all biblical and more cryptic than what he&rsquo;s used to, and when he tried calling her, she didn&rsquo;t pick up, which can only mean that she&rsquo;s been doing worse than usual. He hasn&rsquo;t been sleeping, really, and the bags under his eyes are starting to look more like bruises than anything else at this point. Mika keeps pestering him about it, which only makes it all worse.</p>\n<p>Lucas is doing so great.</p>\n</p>",

I\u2019ll bring your best friend back from the dead but you\u2019ve got to give up something in return.\u201d<br/>\u201cAnything,\u201d I repeat.<br/>The man smirks. \u201cEliott will be alive, except he won\u2019t know who you are. I\u2019m gonna rewrite your history, sweetheart. So make your choice. Your friendship for his life?\u201d<br/>And really, it\u2019s not like I have an option, is it?<br/>\u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lucas and Eliott have been best friend\u2019s ever since Eliott noticed the younger, deaf boy when he was 4 years old. But 13 years later a tragic accident destroys everything. Lucas is given a chance to bring Eliott back, but with a high price to pay. The deal isn\u2019t everything he thought it would be and soon he has to make a choice: live in this new reality or hold onto the past and memories that he treasures the most?</i></p><p><i>\u2014</i></p><h2>Chapter Five</h2><p><b>Eliott\u2019s Point of View</b></p><p>I turn the ignition once more and the car busts into life, roaring loudly. I let out a whoop and stick my head out the window, grinning at Idriss. He grins back and I hop out the car, slapping him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d I cheer.</p><p>The old car has been lying around the garage where Idriss and I work for months. The boss had wanted to scrap it but we managed to convince him to let us try to fix it up. He agreed, stating that if we got the old thing to actually work, he\u2019d pay us double for six months. Idriss smirks.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we won, hey Ellie boy,\u201d he teases.</p><p>I shake my head as I laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited yet. We have to see if we can drive it anywhere without it breaking down.\u201d</p><p>We both chuckle softly. Then Idriss walks over to the cooler and pulls out a couple bottles of water. He tosses one to me and I mutter a thanks as I unscrew the lid and gulp the cool liquid greedily. I close my eyes as I drink and the unbidden image of Lucas pops into my mind. The younger, deaf boy has touched me in a way that I didn\u2019t think possible. It\u2019s as if I have known him all my life. His moods and facial expressions are so familiar and sometimes, when he\u2019s teaching me a knew sign, it\u2019s as though I already know how. When I\u2019m with him, I get this indescribable feeling in my gut and sometimes, when he laughs, I forget how to breathe. It sounds so girly and stupid, that after mentioning this unexplainable connection to Idriss a few times and having him laugh at me, I dropped the topic of Lucas completely. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the gang doesn\u2019t enjoy teasing me endlessly. Right on cue, Idriss turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cSo how is your boyfriend, Ellie boy?\u201d</p><p>I scowl deeply. \u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend, Idriss. And be nice. You might not like him, but I do. He isn\u2019t going anywhere, so get used to him.\u201d</p><p>Idriss holds his hands up in mock defence. \u201cJeez, sorry. Didn\u2019t realise that you would get that defensive over him.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. I don\u2019t know what it is about Lucas that has me so twisted up. I glance at my watch and curse under my breadth. I\u2019m supposed to be meeting Lucas in ten minutes. I toss the empty water bottle in the recycling bin and wave goodbye to Idriss, dashing out the garage and jogging the few blocks to Lucas\u2019 house. I\u2019m sweating and tired, but I keep going. I know how Lucas gets about time. When I reach his house, I don\u2019t bother with the doorbell. His family isn\u2019t home and Lucas can\u2019t hear. I dig around in the plant pot and pull out the hidden key. I unlock the door and slip inside the house, making sure to lock up after myself. Then I run up the stairs to Lucas\u2019 bedroom. He is lying on his bed, tossing a basketball into the air and catching it, a frown on his face. Then he sees me and he grins. A warm feeling courses through my blood as he sits up on his bed. His cheeks are flushed and his hair is mused. He looks beautiful. I mentally scold myself. He is just a sweet, innocent kid and here I am, crushing on him. I don\u2019t want to admit it, but whatever I am feeling for the kid is more than friendship. But at the same time, I\u2019m not gay. I have never liked a boy before, but Lucas isn\u2019t just some boy. I smile at him and walk over to his bed, flopping down next to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lulu. How are you?\u201d I sign.</p><p>He nudges my shoulder lightly. \u201cGreat. Missed you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Monday and I haven\u2019t seen Lucas since Thursday due to the five-day long weekend.</p><p>\u201cMissed you too.\u201d</p><p>We fall into silence as Lucas passes me a Marvel comic. It\u2019s how we are together. Not talking much, just basking in each other\u2019s presence whilst reading or playing stupid computer games. It\u2019s so easy. This whole friendship is so easy. Sometimes, when I close my eyes at night, I see another me and another him. I can see us as children, playing in the park. I can see us as pre-teens, arguing over who gets which side of the bed. I can see us as we are now, happy and content. And then I open my eyes and the images fade and I can no longer grip onto them. Sometimes it\u2019s as though those dreams are more real than this life.</p><p>I skim through the comic, laughing at the correct moments. I notice Lucas watching me but I pretend not to. His calculating eyes burn into me and I try to pretend that it doesn\u2019t affect me. But it does. It sends chills through me. I like his attention. I like it a lot. When the intensity of his stare gets too much, I drop the comic and tilt my head to look at him. My breath hitches. The way he is looking at me is too intense, too familiar. I want him in ways that I never imagined I would want a guy. I push myself out of my lazy sprawl and lean in slightly. Lucas doesn\u2019t move, but his eyes widen considerably. I know I should stop, but the moment my eyes land on his lips, I know that I am done for. I groan, forcing myself to stand up and put a decent distance between us. I glance back and see Lucas\u2019 perplexed expression. Damn it, I curse myself. I feel a hand on my shoulder and close my eyes. Please, Lucas, don\u2019t. I can\u2019t control myself right now. As though he can read my thoughts, the warmth of his body fades. I breathe out a relieved sigh. I need to get out of here. I blurt out a lame excuse, ignoring the hurt look on Lucas\u2019 face and then dash out of his room and out of the house. Whatever is going on with me, I need it to stop. I am not going to start crushing on Lucas. I won\u2019t allow it. And I know exactly who to turn to in order to distract myself.</p><p><b>Lucas\u2019 Point of View</b></p><p>Yann angrily takes the plate of slush from the cafeteria lady and dumps it on his tray. Imane looks at me with raised eyebrows and I shrug, helpless. Yann has been in a bad mood all day and neither Imane nor I could get him to fess up what is wrong. \u00a0We take a seat at one of the tables. I poke around at my food, watching the mush flop about and I push the tray away, shaking my head. There is nothing on this earth that would convince me to attempt to eat that, whatever it is. Imane kicks my leg under the table and I glance up at her. She nods towards Yann. I look over at his angry frown. His sad eyes are glued to the table and his shoulders are slumped in defeat. I nudge him with my foot and he glances up at me, scowling.</p><p><i>What</i>, he mouths begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so depressed?\u201d I question, ignoring the bitterness etched onto his face.</p><p>He scowls and mutters something, his lips moving too quickly for me to read. Then he lifts his hands from where they were clenched on the table and signs, \u201cEliott has a new girlfriend. Lucille.\u201d</p><p>I blink. Eliott has a new girlfriend? Since when did Eliott like anyone? He hasn\u2019t paid the slightest interest in anyone since he broke up with Sonja. And Lucille? It couldn\u2019t possibly be the same Lucille from before. Could it? Then I frown. Why does Eliott having a girlfriend affect Yann? Then Imane is butting into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cAs in the Lucille that you like?\u201d</p><p>Yann glowers at her. \u201cHow many girls called Lucille do we know, idiot?\u201d</p><p>Imane shoves him and then glances over at me, her eyes silently sending me messages. <i>Is it the same Lucille?</i> I shrug helplessly. <i>I don\u2019t know, Imane. I simply don\u2019t know.</i></p><p>But our questions are answered almost immediately. Eliott strolls into the cafeteria, a smile etched onto his face, and beside him, clinging to his arm and laughing loudly, is Lucille. The same Lucille from before. They seem happy. Seem being the keyword. Lucille is content and her eyes are glowing with star struck awe as she gazes up at Eliott. But Eliott\u2019s smile is fake. His eyes don\u2019t have that sparkle in them and his lips don\u2019t tug up at their own accord. It\u2019s forced. All of it. But no one notices that, except me. Imane is nudging me, wanting answers and so I nod briefly, my eyes refusing to leave Eliott. Then he looks over and catches my eye and his fake happiness drops. A blank expression crosses his face, an expression that I have never seen and don\u2019t understand at all. But just as quickly as it appears, it is gone. The smile is back in place and he is turning away, chatting to Idriss and Alex as though nothing is wrong. I slump back in my chair and run a hand over my face. Then I push the seat back and stumble to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I sign, then turn and dash out of the cafeteria. Tears start to stream down my face and I wipe them angrily away. I don\u2019t know why I am so upset. Maybe because whilst I have lost my best friend, everyone else has got to keep him? Maybe because him turning away from me hurts more than I thought possible? Maybe because this entire situation is so bizarre and unfair and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on? Whatever the reason, the tears keep on coming. I sniff and push the doors open, stepping out into the blinding sunlight. The small quad is empty, not many people wanting to spend their free time in the old, abandoned garden. I flop down on the bench that stands next to the fish pond and close my eyes, my shoulders shaking with my sobs. One of the worst parts about being deaf is not knowing how loud you are being. I could be as loud as a fog horn or as soft as a mouse and I won\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard not to draw attention to yourself when you are unsure of the sounds you are making. Sometimes I hate myself for being deaf. Why can\u2019t I just be normal, I will ask the stars, and they\u2019ll glisten down upon me, silent and beautiful. When I was fourteen I told Eliott about their silent beauty and asked him why no one had answers for me. He had smiled over at me and replied with, \u2018that\u2019s why they remind me of you. Beautiful and silent, but with all the secrets of the world hidden within.\u2019 That was the day that everything changed. Eliott was no longer just my best friend, he became my everything.</p><p>A tap on my shoulder startles me and I jump, glancing upwards. Eliott is standing there, but when he sees my face, he sits down next to me, his one hand clasping mine. He gives it a squeeze before letting go to sign.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>I refuse to meet his gaze, my eyes focused on my hands fidgeting in my lap. He nudges me with his shoulder. I close my eyes, choking on the hollowness inside of me. Why can\u2019t I be normal? Eliott\u2019s arm slips around my shoulders and I lean into him, soaking in his familiarity. I miss this, I miss him. Even now, when we are getting closer and becoming friends, I miss the old us. The people that we used to be. I look up at Eliott and freeze. Our faces are so close and his breath is fanning my skin. Our eyes bore into each other and something inside of me changes. I glance down and my eyes briefly scan his lips before I meet his eyes again. Thoughts filter through my brain; thoughts that I have never entertained before. What would it be like to kiss him? What would it be like to be loved by Eliott? Elio mouths my name, the gentle caress of <i>Lucas </i>tracing my skin. I gulp and close my eyes. I can\u2019t look into his intense gaze. But even with my eyes closed I can feel it burning into me. Then cool lips press against mine, moving cautiously, almost unwillingly. The pressure is light and gentle, the taste of mint soaking into my skin. I slowly move my lips with his, opening my mouth slightly so that his tongue can slip inside. It feels good, better than any kiss I have ever experienced. I can\u2019t hear the sounds he is making, but hands can feel the vibrations as I press them against his chest. He buries a hand in my hair, the other cupping my face. We press against each other, heat pooling in the pit of my stomach. Then he pulls away and breaks all contact. I sit there, gasping and panting, sensations shooting through my body. Everything feels so new and intense. I\u2019m too scared to open my eyes out of the fear of what I will see in Eliott\u2019s eyes. But when I do open the a few moments later, I am greeted by an empty bench and the stillness of the abandoned garden. <i>Eliott is gone.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Imane flops onto my bed, the stack of papers in her hands. She laughs and drops them on the blanket beside her, tilting her head to look at me.</p><p>\u201cDid that seriously happen?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I shut my laptop and place it back on my desk, before spinning my chair back to face her. I shrug sheepishly. Over the past month, Eliott has ignored me. In an attempt to escape the hurt and confusion at what happened, I proceeded to write down stories about our old lives. I used to write a lot, wanting to become an international best-selling author. But I gave that dream up a few years ago. Now, for the first time in years, someone other than Eliott is reading the stories that I write. I nod.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that happened. We were mischievous kids.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI can tell.\u201d She sits up on the bed and smiles at me. \u201cThese are great. If you changed the names of the characters, no one would know that they were based off real events. Why not try enter a short story competition?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t what I want to do.\u201d<br/>She shrugs. \u201cOkay. So, on the subject of Eliott, wanna tell me why you haven\u2019t spoken to him in weeks?\u201d<br/>I roll my eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Imane stares at me disbelievingly. I don\u2019t blame her. The awkward glances Eliott and I have been shooting each other when we don\u2019t think the other is looking is enough to send half to the school into a pool of gossip. No wonder one of my closest friends is gnawing at the bit for more information on the situation. Caving, I\u2019m about to explain what happened, when Imane suddenly tenses.</p><p>\u201cThe doorbell rang,\u201d she states. <br/>I frown. Who the hell would be stopping by on a Sunday? My parents are out of state with work and my sister is at a friends and won\u2019t be home till late. I stand up and make my way out the room and down the stairs. I grab the keys off the hook and unlock the door. I\u2019m stunned to find Eliott on the other side. He is pale and sick looking, but a determined expression is on his face. <br/>\u201cEliott?\u201d</p><p>He steps into the house and shuts the door behind him, before turning to me.</p><p>\u201cIs your family home?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in confusion. \u201cNo, but-\u201c<br/>Before I can finish, Eliott pushes me against the wall, hard. His body presses tightly against my own and one hand rests on the wall next to my head whilst the other grips my hip.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Then he presses his lips against mine forcefully. I gasp in shock and he uses it to his advantage, slipping his tongue into my mouth. Unable to think clearly, I kiss him back just as brutally. He grinds his crotch against me and I tilt my head back, groaning. Eliott moves his lips onto my throat and sucks harshly, sending unexplainable sensations through my blood. I shiver and cup his face in my hands, dragging his mouth back to my own. He continues to grind against me and I feel myself growing hard. Then Eliott tenses and pulls back. I chase after him blindly, but then I pause when I see Imane standing behind us, her eyes wide and her mouth open. It\u2019s easier to read her lips when she yells, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Eliott says something, but his back is to me so I don\u2019t know what it is. Imane just shakes her head in disbelief, before hurriedly signing, \u201cLucas, explain. Now.\u201d Then she holds up her hands in defeat and shakes her head. \u201cActually, no. Don\u2019t. you two are busy. I\u2019m coming over before school tomorrow and you will explain everything to me. Have fun, boys.\u201d</p><p>Then she saunters out the house. Eliott turns and glares at me.</p><p>\u201cYou said no one was home!\u201d<br/>I shake my head. \u201cI said my family wasn\u2019t, and I was about to tell you, but you interrupted me.\u201d<br/>Eliott\u2019s glare melts away as he starts to laugh. \u201cOh gosh,\u201d he groans. \u201cSo embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>I laugh with him. Then it fades as we meet each other\u2019s gaze. Eliott steps closer to me, his hands slipping under my shirt as he looks up at me and speaks his words very slowly and clearly so that I can read his lips.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Lu. And we can talk later about our relationship later, but right now, I really want to take this upstairs. Is that okay with you?\u201d<br/>I stare at him for a moment. I know that we should discuss our relationship first, before we rush into anything, but the tingling in my lips and then bugle in my trousers makes it hard to think straight. Besides, this is Eliott. He wouldn\u2019t use me for sex and then leave. He just wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019s my best friend. So I nod and before I can change my mind, I grab his hand and tug him upstairs. We stumble into my bedroom and immediately lock our lips together once again. Eliott shrugs his jacket off and then reaches for the hem of my shirt. I allow him to pull it off me, but before he can kiss me again, I hold up my hand to stop him.</p><p><i>\u201cNo sex,\u201d </i>I state.</p><p>He nods.<i> \u201cNo sex,\u201d</i> he agrees.</p><p>Then I\u2019m yanking his t-shirt off and we are kissing once more.</p><p>*****</p><p>We didn\u2019t have sex. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we couldn\u2019t mess around a bit. After, we lay in my bed, silent, a smile playing on each of our lips. I fell asleep in his arms and when I woke up around 1am, I found a note on my beside table.</p><p><i>Sorry I had to leave you, but you looked so peaceful and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to wake you.

But 13 years later a tragic accident destroys everything. Lucas is given a chance to bring Eliott back, but with a high price to pay. The deal isn\u2019t everything he thought it would be and soon he has to make a choice: live in this new reality or hold onto the past and memories that he treasures the most?</i></p><p><i>\u2014</i></p><h2>Chapter Five</h2><p><b>Eliott\u2019s Point of View</b></p><p>I turn the ignition once more and the car busts into life, roaring loudly. I let out a whoop and stick my head out the window, grinning at Idriss. He grins back and I hop out the car, slapping him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d I cheer.</p><p>The old car has been lying around the garage where Idriss and I work for months. The boss had wanted to scrap it but we managed to convince him to let us try to fix it up. He agreed, stating that if we got the old thing to actually work, he\u2019d pay us double for six months. Idriss smirks.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we won, hey Ellie boy,\u201d he teases.</p><p>I shake my head as I laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited yet. We have to see if we can drive it anywhere without it breaking down.\u201d</p><p>We both chuckle softly. Then Idriss walks over to the cooler and pulls out a couple bottles of water. He tosses one to me and I mutter a thanks as I unscrew the lid and gulp the cool liquid greedily. I close my eyes as I drink and the unbidden image of Lucas pops into my mind. The younger, deaf boy has touched me in a way that I didn\u2019t think possible. It\u2019s as if I have known him all my life. His moods and facial expressions are so familiar and sometimes, when he\u2019s teaching me a knew sign, it\u2019s as though I already know how. When I\u2019m with him, I get this indescribable feeling in my gut and sometimes, when he laughs, I forget how to breathe. It sounds so girly and stupid, that after mentioning this unexplainable connection to Idriss a few times and having him laugh at me, I dropped the topic of Lucas completely. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the gang doesn\u2019t enjoy teasing me endlessly. Right on cue, Idriss turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cSo how is your boyfriend, Ellie boy?\u201d</p><p>I scowl deeply. \u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend, Idriss. And be nice. You might not like him, but I do. He isn\u2019t going anywhere, so get used to him.\u201d</p><p>Idriss holds his hands up in mock defence. \u201cJeez, sorry. Didn\u2019t realise that you would get that defensive over him.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. I don\u2019t know what it is about Lucas that has me so twisted up. I glance at my watch and curse under my breadth. I\u2019m supposed to be meeting Lucas in ten minutes. I toss the empty water bottle in the recycling bin and wave goodbye to Idriss, dashing out the garage and jogging the few blocks to Lucas\u2019 house. I\u2019m sweating and tired, but I keep going. I know how Lucas gets about time. When I reach his house, I don\u2019t bother with the doorbell. His family isn\u2019t home and Lucas can\u2019t hear. I dig around in the plant pot and pull out the hidden key. I unlock the door and slip inside the house, making sure to lock up after myself. Then I run up the stairs to Lucas\u2019 bedroom. He is lying on his bed, tossing a basketball into the air and catching it, a frown on his face. Then he sees me and he grins. A warm feeling courses through my blood as he sits up on his bed. His cheeks are flushed and his hair is mused. He looks beautiful. I mentally scold myself. He is just a sweet, innocent kid and here I am, crushing on him. I don\u2019t want to admit it, but whatever I am feeling for the kid is more than friendship. But at the same time, I\u2019m not gay. I have never liked a boy before, but Lucas isn\u2019t just some boy. I smile at him and walk over to his bed, flopping down next to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lulu. How are you?\u201d I sign.</p><p>He nudges my shoulder lightly. \u201cGreat. Missed you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Monday and I haven\u2019t seen Lucas since Thursday due to the five-day long weekend.</p><p>\u201cMissed you too.\u201d</p><p>We fall into silence as Lucas passes me a Marvel comic. It\u2019s how we are together. Not talking much, just basking in each other\u2019s presence whilst reading or playing stupid computer games. It\u2019s so easy. This whole friendship is so easy. Sometimes, when I close my eyes at night, I see another me and another him. I can see us as children, playing in the park. I can see us as pre-teens, arguing over who gets which side of the bed. I can see us as we are now, happy and content. And then I open my eyes and the images fade and I can no longer grip onto them. Sometimes it\u2019s as though those dreams are more real than this life.</p><p>I skim through the comic, laughing at the correct moments. I notice Lucas watching me but I pretend not to. His calculating eyes burn into me and I try to pretend that it doesn\u2019t affect me. But it does. It sends chills through me. I like his attention. I like it a lot. When the intensity of his stare gets too much, I drop the comic and tilt my head to look at him. My breath hitches. The way he is looking at me is too intense, too familiar. I want him in ways that I never imagined I would want a guy. I push myself out of my lazy sprawl and lean in slightly. Lucas doesn\u2019t move, but his eyes widen considerably. I know I should stop, but the moment my eyes land on his lips, I know that I am done for. I groan, forcing myself to stand up and put a decent distance between us. I glance back and see Lucas\u2019 perplexed expression. Damn it, I curse myself. I feel a hand on my shoulder and close my eyes. Please, Lucas, don\u2019t. I can\u2019t control myself right now. As though he can read my thoughts, the warmth of his body fades. I breathe out a relieved sigh. I need to get out of here. I blurt out a lame excuse, ignoring the hurt look on Lucas\u2019 face and then dash out of his room and out of the house. Whatever is going on with me, I need it to stop. I am not going to start crushing on Lucas. I won\u2019t allow it. And I know exactly who to turn to in order to distract myself.</p><p><b>Lucas\u2019 Point of View</b></p><p>Yann angrily takes the plate of slush from the cafeteria lady and dumps it on his tray. Imane looks at me with raised eyebrows and I shrug, helpless. Yann has been in a bad mood all day and neither Imane nor I could get him to fess up what is wrong. \u00a0We take a seat at one of the tables. I poke around at my food, watching the mush flop about and I push the tray away, shaking my head. There is nothing on this earth that would convince me to attempt to eat that, whatever it is. Imane kicks my leg under the table and I glance up at her. She nods towards Yann. I look over at his angry frown. His sad eyes are glued to the table and his shoulders are slumped in defeat. I nudge him with my foot and he glances up at me, scowling.</p><p><i>What</i>, he mouths begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so depressed?\u201d I question, ignoring the bitterness etched onto his face.</p><p>He scowls and mutters something, his lips moving too quickly for me to read. Then he lifts his hands from where they were clenched on the table and signs, \u201cEliott has a new girlfriend. Lucille.\u201d</p><p>I blink. Eliott has a new girlfriend? Since when did Eliott like anyone? He hasn\u2019t paid the slightest interest in anyone since he broke up with Sonja. And Lucille? It couldn\u2019t possibly be the same Lucille from before. Could it? Then I frown. Why does Eliott having a girlfriend affect Yann? Then Imane is butting into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cAs in the Lucille that you like?\u201d</p><p>Yann glowers at her. \u201cHow many girls called Lucille do we know, idiot?\u201d</p><p>Imane shoves him and then glances over at me, her eyes silently sending me messages. <i>Is it the same Lucille?</i> I shrug helplessly. <i>I don\u2019t know, Imane. I simply don\u2019t know.</i></p><p>But our questions are answered almost immediately. Eliott strolls into the cafeteria, a smile etched onto his face, and beside him, clinging to his arm and laughing loudly, is Lucille. The same Lucille from before. They seem happy. Seem being the keyword. Lucille is content and her eyes are glowing with star struck awe as she gazes up at Eliott. But Eliott\u2019s smile is fake. His eyes don\u2019t have that sparkle in them and his lips don\u2019t tug up at their own accord. It\u2019s forced. All of it. But no one notices that, except me. Imane is nudging me, wanting answers and so I nod briefly, my eyes refusing to leave Eliott. Then he looks over and catches my eye and his fake happiness drops. A blank expression crosses his face, an expression that I have never seen and don\u2019t understand at all. But just as quickly as it appears, it is gone. The smile is back in place and he is turning away, chatting to Idriss and Alex as though nothing is wrong. I slump back in my chair and run a hand over my face. Then I push the seat back and stumble to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I sign, then turn and dash out of the cafeteria. Tears start to stream down my face and I wipe them angrily away. I don\u2019t know why I am so upset. Maybe because whilst I have lost my best friend, everyone else has got to keep him? Maybe because him turning away from me hurts more than I thought possible? Maybe because this entire situation is so bizarre and unfair and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on? Whatever the reason, the tears keep on coming. I sniff and push the doors open, stepping out into the blinding sunlight. The small quad is empty, not many people wanting to spend their free time in the old, abandoned garden. I flop down on the bench that stands next to the fish pond and close my eyes, my shoulders shaking with my sobs. One of the worst parts about being deaf is not knowing how loud you are being. I could be as loud as a fog horn or as soft as a mouse and I won\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard not to draw attention to yourself when you are unsure of the sounds you are making. Sometimes I hate myself for being deaf. Why can\u2019t I just be normal, I will ask the stars, and they\u2019ll glisten down upon me, silent and beautiful. When I was fourteen I told Eliott about their silent beauty and asked him why no one had answers for me. He had smiled over at me and replied with, \u2018that\u2019s why they remind me of you. Beautiful and silent, but with all the secrets of the world hidden within.\u2019 That was the day that everything changed. Eliott was no longer just my best friend, he became my everything.</p><p>A tap on my shoulder startles me and I jump, glancing upwards. Eliott is standing there, but when he sees my face, he sits down next to me, his one hand clasping mine. He gives it a squeeze before letting go to sign.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>I refuse to meet his gaze, my eyes focused on my hands fidgeting in my lap. He nudges me with his shoulder. I close my eyes, choking on the hollowness inside of me. Why can\u2019t I be normal? Eliott\u2019s arm slips around my shoulders and I lean into him, soaking in his familiarity. I miss this, I miss him. Even now, when we are getting closer and becoming friends, I miss the old us. The people that we used to be. I look up at Eliott and freeze. Our faces are so close and his breath is fanning my skin. Our eyes bore into each other and something inside of me changes. I glance down and my eyes briefly scan his lips before I meet his eyes again. Thoughts filter through my brain; thoughts that I have never entertained before. What would it be like to kiss him? What would it be like to be loved by Eliott? Elio mouths my name, the gentle caress of <i>Lucas </i>tracing my skin. I gulp and close my eyes. I can\u2019t look into his intense gaze. But even with my eyes closed I can feel it burning into me. Then cool lips press against mine, moving cautiously, almost unwillingly. The pressure is light and gentle, the taste of mint soaking into my skin. I slowly move my lips with his, opening my mouth slightly so that his tongue can slip inside. It feels good, better than any kiss I have ever experienced. I can\u2019t hear the sounds he is making, but hands can feel the vibrations as I press them against his chest. He buries a hand in my hair, the other cupping my face. We press against each other, heat pooling in the pit of my stomach. Then he pulls away and breaks all contact. I sit there, gasping and panting, sensations shooting through my body. Everything feels so new and intense. I\u2019m too scared to open my eyes out of the fear of what I will see in Eliott\u2019s eyes. But when I do open the a few moments later, I am greeted by an empty bench and the stillness of the abandoned garden. <i>Eliott is gone.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Imane flops onto my bed, the stack of papers in her hands. She laughs and drops them on the blanket beside her, tilting her head to look at me.</p><p>\u201cDid that seriously happen?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I shut my laptop and place it back on my desk, before spinning my chair back to face her. I shrug sheepishly. Over the past month, Eliott has ignored me. In an attempt to escape the hurt and confusion at what happened, I proceeded to write down stories about our old lives. I used to write a lot, wanting to become an international best-selling author. But I gave that dream up a few years ago. Now, for the first time in years, someone other than Eliott is reading the stories that I write. I nod.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that happened. We were mischievous kids.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI can tell.\u201d She sits up on the bed and smiles at me. \u201cThese are great. If you changed the names of the characters, no one would know that they were based off real events. Why not try enter a short story competition?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t what I want to do.\u201d<br>She shrugs. \u201cOkay. So, on the subject of Eliott, wanna tell me why you haven\u2019t spoken to him in weeks?\u201d<br>I roll my eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Imane stares at me disbelievingly. I don\u2019t blame her. The awkward glances Eliott and I have been shooting each other when we don\u2019t think the other is looking is enough to send half to the school into a pool of gossip. No wonder one of my closest friends is gnawing at the bit for more information on the situation. Caving, I\u2019m about to explain what happened, when Imane suddenly tenses.</p><p>\u201cThe doorbell rang,\u201d she states. <br>I frown. Who the hell would be stopping by on a Sunday? My parents are out of state with work and my sister is at a friends and won\u2019t be home till late. I stand up and make my way out the room and down the stairs. I grab the keys off the hook and unlock the door. I\u2019m stunned to find Eliott on the other side. He is pale and sick looking, but a determined expression is on his face. <br>\u201cEliott?\u201d</p><p>He steps into the house and shuts the door behind him, before turning to me.</p><p>\u201cIs your family home?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in confusion. \u201cNo, but-\u201c<br>Before I can finish, Eliott pushes me against the wall, hard. His body presses tightly against my own and one hand rests on the wall next to my head whilst the other grips my hip.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Then he presses his lips against mine forcefully. I gasp in shock and he uses it to his advantage, slipping his tongue into my mouth. Unable to think clearly, I kiss him back just as brutally. He grinds his crotch against me and I tilt my head back, groaning. Eliott moves his lips onto my throat and sucks harshly, sending unexplainable sensations through my blood. I shiver and cup his face in my hands, dragging his mouth back to my own. He continues to grind against me and I feel myself growing hard. Then Eliott tenses and pulls back. I chase after him blindly, but then I pause when I see Imane standing behind us, her eyes wide and her mouth open. It\u2019s easier to read her lips when she yells, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Eliott says something, but his back is to me so I don\u2019t know what it is. Imane just shakes her head in disbelief, before hurriedly signing, \u201cLucas, explain. Now.\u201d Then she holds up her hands in defeat and shakes her head. \u201cActually, no. Don\u2019t. you two are busy. I\u2019m coming over before school tomorrow and you will explain everything to me. Have fun, boys.\u201d</p><p>Then she saunters out the house. Eliott turns and glares at me.</p><p>\u201cYou said no one was home!\u201d<br>I shake my head. \u201cI said my family wasn\u2019t, and I was about to tell you, but you interrupted me.\u201d<br>Eliott\u2019s glare melts away as he starts to laugh. \u201cOh gosh,\u201d he groans. \u201cSo embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>I laugh with him. Then it fades as we meet each other\u2019s gaze. Eliott steps closer to me, his hands slipping under my shirt as he looks up at me and speaks his words very slowly and clearly so that I can read his lips.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Lu. And we can talk later about our relationship later, but right now, I really want to take this upstairs. Is that okay with you?\u201d<br>I stare at him for a moment. I know that we should discuss our relationship first, before we rush into anything, but the tingling in my lips and then bugle in my trousers makes it hard to think straight. Besides, this is Eliott. He wouldn\u2019t use me for sex and then leave. He just wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019s my best friend. So I nod and before I can change my mind, I grab his hand and tug him upstairs. We stumble into my bedroom and immediately lock our lips together once again. Eliott shrugs his jacket off and then reaches for the hem of my shirt. I allow him to pull it off me, but before he can kiss me again, I hold up my hand to stop him.</p><p><i>\u201cNo sex,\u201d </i>I state.</p><p>He nods.<i> \u201cNo sex,\u201d</i> he agrees.</p><p>Then I\u2019m yanking his t-shirt off and we are kissing once more.</p><p>*****</p><p>We didn\u2019t have sex. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we couldn\u2019t mess around a bit. After, we lay in my bed, silent, a smile playing on each of our lips. I fell asleep in his arms and when I woke up around 1am, I found a note on my beside table.</p><p><i>Sorry I had to leave you, but you looked so peaceful and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to wake you.

I let out a whoop and stick my head out the window, grinning at Idriss. He grins back and I hop out the car, slapping him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d I cheer.</p><p>The old car has been lying around the garage where Idriss and I work for months. The boss had wanted to scrap it but we managed to convince him to let us try to fix it up. He agreed, stating that if we got the old thing to actually work, he\u2019d pay us double for six months. Idriss smirks.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we won, hey Ellie boy,\u201d he teases.</p><p>I shake my head as I laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited yet. We have to see if we can drive it anywhere without it breaking down.\u201d</p><p>We both chuckle softly. Then Idriss walks over to the cooler and pulls out a couple bottles of water. He tosses one to me and I mutter a thanks as I unscrew the lid and gulp the cool liquid greedily. I close my eyes as I drink and the unbidden image of Lucas pops into my mind. The younger, deaf boy has touched me in a way that I didn\u2019t think possible. It\u2019s as if I have known him all my life. His moods and facial expressions are so familiar and sometimes, when he\u2019s teaching me a knew sign, it\u2019s as though I already know how. When I\u2019m with him, I get this indescribable feeling in my gut and sometimes, when he laughs, I forget how to breathe. It sounds so girly and stupid, that after mentioning this unexplainable connection to Idriss a few times and having him laugh at me, I dropped the topic of Lucas completely. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the gang doesn\u2019t enjoy teasing me endlessly. Right on cue, Idriss turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cSo how is your boyfriend, Ellie boy?\u201d</p><p>I scowl deeply. \u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend, Idriss. And be nice. You might not like him, but I do. He isn\u2019t going anywhere, so get used to him.\u201d</p><p>Idriss holds his hands up in mock defence. \u201cJeez, sorry. Didn\u2019t realise that you would get that defensive over him.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. I don\u2019t know what it is about Lucas that has me so twisted up. I glance at my watch and curse under my breadth. I\u2019m supposed to be meeting Lucas in ten minutes. I toss the empty water bottle in the recycling bin and wave goodbye to Idriss, dashing out the garage and jogging the few blocks to Lucas\u2019 house. I\u2019m sweating and tired, but I keep going. I know how Lucas gets about time. When I reach his house, I don\u2019t bother with the doorbell. His family isn\u2019t home and Lucas can\u2019t hear. I dig around in the plant pot and pull out the hidden key. I unlock the door and slip inside the house, making sure to lock up after myself. Then I run up the stairs to Lucas\u2019 bedroom. He is lying on his bed, tossing a basketball into the air and catching it, a frown on his face. Then he sees me and he grins. A warm feeling courses through my blood as he sits up on his bed. His cheeks are flushed and his hair is mused. He looks beautiful. I mentally scold myself. He is just a sweet, innocent kid and here I am, crushing on him. I don\u2019t want to admit it, but whatever I am feeling for the kid is more than friendship. But at the same time, I\u2019m not gay. I have never liked a boy before, but Lucas isn\u2019t just some boy. I smile at him and walk over to his bed, flopping down next to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lulu. How are you?\u201d I sign.</p><p>He nudges my shoulder lightly. \u201cGreat. Missed you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Monday and I haven\u2019t seen Lucas since Thursday due to the five-day long weekend.</p><p>\u201cMissed you too.\u201d</p><p>We fall into silence as Lucas passes me a Marvel comic. It\u2019s how we are together. Not talking much, just basking in each other\u2019s presence whilst reading or playing stupid computer games. It\u2019s so easy. This whole friendship is so easy. Sometimes, when I close my eyes at night, I see another me and another him. I can see us as children, playing in the park. I can see us as pre-teens, arguing over who gets which side of the bed. I can see us as we are now, happy and content. And then I open my eyes and the images fade and I can no longer grip onto them. Sometimes it\u2019s as though those dreams are more real than this life.</p><p>I skim through the comic, laughing at the correct moments. I notice Lucas watching me but I pretend not to. His calculating eyes burn into me and I try to pretend that it doesn\u2019t affect me. But it does. It sends chills through me. I like his attention. I like it a lot. When the intensity of his stare gets too much, I drop the comic and tilt my head to look at him. My breath hitches. The way he is looking at me is too intense, too familiar. I want him in ways that I never imagined I would want a guy. I push myself out of my lazy sprawl and lean in slightly. Lucas doesn\u2019t move, but his eyes widen considerably. I know I should stop, but the moment my eyes land on his lips, I know that I am done for. I groan, forcing myself to stand up and put a decent distance between us. I glance back and see Lucas\u2019 perplexed expression. Damn it, I curse myself. I feel a hand on my shoulder and close my eyes. Please, Lucas, don\u2019t. I can\u2019t control myself right now. As though he can read my thoughts, the warmth of his body fades. I breathe out a relieved sigh. I need to get out of here. I blurt out a lame excuse, ignoring the hurt look on Lucas\u2019 face and then dash out of his room and out of the house. Whatever is going on with me, I need it to stop. I am not going to start crushing on Lucas. I won\u2019t allow it. And I know exactly who to turn to in order to distract myself.</p><p><b>Lucas\u2019 Point of View</b></p><p>Yann angrily takes the plate of slush from the cafeteria lady and dumps it on his tray. Imane looks at me with raised eyebrows and I shrug, helpless. Yann has been in a bad mood all day and neither Imane nor I could get him to fess up what is wrong. \u00a0We take a seat at one of the tables. I poke around at my food, watching the mush flop about and I push the tray away, shaking my head. There is nothing on this earth that would convince me to attempt to eat that, whatever it is. Imane kicks my leg under the table and I glance up at her. She nods towards Yann. I look over at his angry frown. His sad eyes are glued to the table and his shoulders are slumped in defeat. I nudge him with my foot and he glances up at me, scowling.</p><p><i>What</i>, he mouths begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so depressed?\u201d I question, ignoring the bitterness etched onto his face.</p><p>He scowls and mutters something, his lips moving too quickly for me to read. Then he lifts his hands from where they were clenched on the table and signs, \u201cEliott has a new girlfriend. Lucille.\u201d</p><p>I blink. Eliott has a new girlfriend? Since when did Eliott like anyone? He hasn\u2019t paid the slightest interest in anyone since he broke up with Sonja. And Lucille? It couldn\u2019t possibly be the same Lucille from before. Could it? Then I frown. Why does Eliott having a girlfriend affect Yann? Then Imane is butting into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cAs in the Lucille that you like?\u201d</p><p>Yann glowers at her. \u201cHow many girls called Lucille do we know, idiot?\u201d</p><p>Imane shoves him and then glances over at me, her eyes silently sending me messages. <i>Is it the same Lucille?</i> I shrug helplessly. <i>I don\u2019t know, Imane. I simply don\u2019t know.</i></p><p>But our questions are answered almost immediately. Eliott strolls into the cafeteria, a smile etched onto his face, and beside him, clinging to his arm and laughing loudly, is Lucille. The same Lucille from before. They seem happy. Seem being the keyword. Lucille is content and her eyes are glowing with star struck awe as she gazes up at Eliott. But Eliott\u2019s smile is fake. His eyes don\u2019t have that sparkle in them and his lips don\u2019t tug up at their own accord. It\u2019s forced. All of it. But no one notices that, except me. Imane is nudging me, wanting answers and so I nod briefly, my eyes refusing to leave Eliott. Then he looks over and catches my eye and his fake happiness drops. A blank expression crosses his face, an expression that I have never seen and don\u2019t understand at all. But just as quickly as it appears, it is gone. The smile is back in place and he is turning away, chatting to Idriss and Alex as though nothing is wrong. I slump back in my chair and run a hand over my face. Then I push the seat back and stumble to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I sign, then turn and dash out of the cafeteria. Tears start to stream down my face and I wipe them angrily away. I don\u2019t know why I am so upset. Maybe because whilst I have lost my best friend, everyone else has got to keep him? Maybe because him turning away from me hurts more than I thought possible? Maybe because this entire situation is so bizarre and unfair and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on? Whatever the reason, the tears keep on coming. I sniff and push the doors open, stepping out into the blinding sunlight. The small quad is empty, not many people wanting to spend their free time in the old, abandoned garden. I flop down on the bench that stands next to the fish pond and close my eyes, my shoulders shaking with my sobs. One of the worst parts about being deaf is not knowing how loud you are being. I could be as loud as a fog horn or as soft as a mouse and I won\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard not to draw attention to yourself when you are unsure of the sounds you are making. Sometimes I hate myself for being deaf. Why can\u2019t I just be normal, I will ask the stars, and they\u2019ll glisten down upon me, silent and beautiful. When I was fourteen I told Eliott about their silent beauty and asked him why no one had answers for me. He had smiled over at me and replied with, \u2018that\u2019s why they remind me of you. Beautiful and silent, but with all the secrets of the world hidden within.\u2019 That was the day that everything changed. Eliott was no longer just my best friend, he became my everything.</p><p>A tap on my shoulder startles me and I jump, glancing upwards. Eliott is standing there, but when he sees my face, he sits down next to me, his one hand clasping mine. He gives it a squeeze before letting go to sign.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>I refuse to meet his gaze, my eyes focused on my hands fidgeting in my lap. He nudges me with his shoulder. I close my eyes, choking on the hollowness inside of me. Why can\u2019t I be normal? Eliott\u2019s arm slips around my shoulders and I lean into him, soaking in his familiarity. I miss this, I miss him. Even now, when we are getting closer and becoming friends, I miss the old us. The people that we used to be. I look up at Eliott and freeze. Our faces are so close and his breath is fanning my skin. Our eyes bore into each other and something inside of me changes. I glance down and my eyes briefly scan his lips before I meet his eyes again. Thoughts filter through my brain; thoughts that I have never entertained before. What would it be like to kiss him? What would it be like to be loved by Eliott? Elio mouths my name, the gentle caress of <i>Lucas </i>tracing my skin. I gulp and close my eyes. I can\u2019t look into his intense gaze. But even with my eyes closed I can feel it burning into me. Then cool lips press against mine, moving cautiously, almost unwillingly. The pressure is light and gentle, the taste of mint soaking into my skin. I slowly move my lips with his, opening my mouth slightly so that his tongue can slip inside. It feels good, better than any kiss I have ever experienced. I can\u2019t hear the sounds he is making, but hands can feel the vibrations as I press them against his chest. He buries a hand in my hair, the other cupping my face. We press against each other, heat pooling in the pit of my stomach. Then he pulls away and breaks all contact. I sit there, gasping and panting, sensations shooting through my body. Everything feels so new and intense. I\u2019m too scared to open my eyes out of the fear of what I will see in Eliott\u2019s eyes. But when I do open the a few moments later, I am greeted by an empty bench and the stillness of the abandoned garden. <i>Eliott is gone.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Imane flops onto my bed, the stack of papers in her hands. She laughs and drops them on the blanket beside her, tilting her head to look at me.</p><p>\u201cDid that seriously happen?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I shut my laptop and place it back on my desk, before spinning my chair back to face her. I shrug sheepishly. Over the past month, Eliott has ignored me. In an attempt to escape the hurt and confusion at what happened, I proceeded to write down stories about our old lives. I used to write a lot, wanting to become an international best-selling author. But I gave that dream up a few years ago. Now, for the first time in years, someone other than Eliott is reading the stories that I write. I nod.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that happened. We were mischievous kids.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI can tell.\u201d She sits up on the bed and smiles at me. \u201cThese are great. If you changed the names of the characters, no one would know that they were based off real events. Why not try enter a short story competition?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t what I want to do.\u201d<br>She shrugs. \u201cOkay. So, on the subject of Eliott, wanna tell me why you haven\u2019t spoken to him in weeks?\u201d<br>I roll my eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Imane stares at me disbelievingly. I don\u2019t blame her. The awkward glances Eliott and I have been shooting each other when we don\u2019t think the other is looking is enough to send half to the school into a pool of gossip. No wonder one of my closest friends is gnawing at the bit for more information on the situation. Caving, I\u2019m about to explain what happened, when Imane suddenly tenses.</p><p>\u201cThe doorbell rang,\u201d she states. <br>I frown. Who the hell would be stopping by on a Sunday? My parents are out of state with work and my sister is at a friends and won\u2019t be home till late. I stand up and make my way out the room and down the stairs. I grab the keys off the hook and unlock the door. I\u2019m stunned to find Eliott on the other side. He is pale and sick looking, but a determined expression is on his face. <br>\u201cEliott?\u201d</p><p>He steps into the house and shuts the door behind him, before turning to me.</p><p>\u201cIs your family home?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in confusion. \u201cNo, but-\u201c<br>Before I can finish, Eliott pushes me against the wall, hard. His body presses tightly against my own and one hand rests on the wall next to my head whilst the other grips my hip.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Then he presses his lips against mine forcefully. I gasp in shock and he uses it to his advantage, slipping his tongue into my mouth. Unable to think clearly, I kiss him back just as brutally. He grinds his crotch against me and I tilt my head back, groaning. Eliott moves his lips onto my throat and sucks harshly, sending unexplainable sensations through my blood. I shiver and cup his face in my hands, dragging his mouth back to my own. He continues to grind against me and I feel myself growing hard. Then Eliott tenses and pulls back. I chase after him blindly, but then I pause when I see Imane standing behind us, her eyes wide and her mouth open. It\u2019s easier to read her lips when she yells, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Eliott says something, but his back is to me so I don\u2019t know what it is. Imane just shakes her head in disbelief, before hurriedly signing, \u201cLucas, explain. Now.\u201d Then she holds up her hands in defeat and shakes her head. \u201cActually, no. Don\u2019t. you two are busy. I\u2019m coming over before school tomorrow and you will explain everything to me. Have fun, boys.\u201d</p><p>Then she saunters out the house. Eliott turns and glares at me.</p><p>\u201cYou said no one was home!\u201d<br>I shake my head. \u201cI said my family wasn\u2019t, and I was about to tell you, but you interrupted me.\u201d<br>Eliott\u2019s glare melts away as he starts to laugh. \u201cOh gosh,\u201d he groans. \u201cSo embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>I laugh with him. Then it fades as we meet each other\u2019s gaze. Eliott steps closer to me, his hands slipping under my shirt as he looks up at me and speaks his words very slowly and clearly so that I can read his lips.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Lu. And we can talk later about our relationship later, but right now, I really want to take this upstairs. Is that okay with you?\u201d<br>I stare at him for a moment. I know that we should discuss our relationship first, before we rush into anything, but the tingling in my lips and then bugle in my trousers makes it hard to think straight. Besides, this is Eliott. He wouldn\u2019t use me for sex and then leave. He just wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019s my best friend. So I nod and before I can change my mind, I grab his hand and tug him upstairs. We stumble into my bedroom and immediately lock our lips together once again. Eliott shrugs his jacket off and then reaches for the hem of my shirt. I allow him to pull it off me, but before he can kiss me again, I hold up my hand to stop him.</p><p><i>\u201cNo sex,\u201d </i>I state.</p><p>He nods.<i> \u201cNo sex,\u201d</i> he agrees.</p><p>Then I\u2019m yanking his t-shirt off and we are kissing once more.</p><p>*****</p><p>We didn\u2019t have sex. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we couldn\u2019t mess around a bit. After, we lay in my bed, silent, a smile playing on each of our lips. I fell asleep in his arms and when I woke up around 1am, I found a note on my beside table.</p><p><i>Sorry I had to leave you, but you looked so peaceful and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to wake you. I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow. We will talk, I promise. This wasn\u2019t just a one-time thing, at least not to me.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Love,</i></p><p><i>Your raccoon, Eliott.\u00a0</i></p><p>Imane had shown up before school, as promised and I had explained the new development in mine and Eliott\u2019s relationship to her. She has been pleased for me, sure, but one thing she said really stuck to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you find it weird that he suddenly likes you, whilst in the other reality, you were never interest in each other that way?\u201d</p><p>Now, sitting in biology class, I can\u2019t help but wonder if she has a point. What if Eliott doesn\u2019t like me that way, but feels a connection to me because of our past and he\u2019s read into it wrong? Eliott isn\u2019t gay. He never once felt attracted to a guy and no, all of a sudden, he wants me. And what about me? I didn\u2019t like Eliott. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t. But kissing him felt so good and so right. And now all I can think about is doing it again. Maybe I should tell Eliott the truth. Maybe I should be honest with him. He\u2019d understand, right? Yeah, somehow I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be as understanding as Imane was. I lean forward and bang my head on my desk. <i>What am I supposed to do now?</i></p></p>",

His calculating eyes burn into me and I try to pretend that it doesn&rsquo;t affect me. But it does. It sends chills through me. I like his attention. I like it a lot. When the intensity of his stare gets too much, I drop the comic and tilt my head to look at him. My breath hitches. The way he is looking at me is too intense, too familiar. I want him in ways that I never imagined I would want a guy. I push myself out of my lazy sprawl and lean in slightly. Lucas doesn&rsquo;t move, but his eyes widen considerably. I know I should stop, but the moment my eyes land on his lips, I know that I am done for. I groan, forcing myself to stand up and put a decent distance between us. I glance back and see Lucas&rsquo; perplexed expression. Damn it, I curse myself. I feel a hand on my shoulder and close my eyes. Please, Lucas, don&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t control myself right now. As though he can read my thoughts, the warmth of his body fades. I breathe out a relieved sigh. I need to get out of here. I blurt out a lame excuse, ignoring the hurt look on Lucas&rsquo; face and then dash out of his room and out of the house. Whatever is going on with me, I need it to stop. I am not going to start crushing on Lucas. I won&rsquo;t allow it. And I know exactly who to turn to in order to distract myself.</p><p><b>Lucas&rsquo; Point of View</b></p><p>Yann angrily takes the plate of slush from the cafeteria lady and dumps it on his tray. Imane looks at me with raised eyebrows and I shrug, helpless. Yann has been in a bad mood all day and neither Imane nor I could get him to fess up what is wrong. &nbsp;We take a seat at one of the tables. I poke around at my food, watching the mush flop about and I push the tray away, shaking my head. There is nothing on this earth that would convince me to attempt to eat that, whatever it is. Imane kicks my leg under the table and I glance up at her. She nods towards Yann. I look over at his angry frown. His sad eyes are glued to the table and his shoulders are slumped in defeat. I nudge him with my foot and he glances up at me, scowling.</p><p><i>What</i>, he mouths begrudgingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so depressed?&rdquo; I question, ignoring the bitterness etched onto his face.</p><p>He scowls and mutters something, his lips moving too quickly for me to read. Then he lifts his hands from where they were clenched on the table and signs, &ldquo;Eliott has a new girlfriend. Lucille.&rdquo;</p><p>I blink. Eliott has a new girlfriend? Since when did Eliott like anyone? He hasn&rsquo;t paid the slightest interest in anyone since he broke up with Sonja. And Lucille? It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be the same Lucille from before. Could it? Then I frown. Why does Eliott having a girlfriend affect Yann? Then Imane is butting into the conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;As in the Lucille that you like?&rdquo;</p><p>Yann glowers at her. &ldquo;How many girls called Lucille do we know, idiot?&rdquo;</p><p>Imane shoves him and then glances over at me, her eyes silently sending me messages. <i>Is it the same Lucille?</i> I shrug helplessly. <i>I don&rsquo;t know, Imane. I simply don&rsquo;t know.</i></p><p>But our questions are answered almost immediately. Eliott strolls into the cafeteria, a smile etched onto his face, and beside him, clinging to his arm and laughing loudly, is Lucille. The same Lucille from before. They seem happy. Seem being the keyword. Lucille is content and her eyes are glowing with star struck awe as she gazes up at Eliott. But Eliott&rsquo;s smile is fake. His eyes don&rsquo;t have that sparkle in them and his lips don&rsquo;t tug up at their own accord. It&rsquo;s forced. All of it. But no one notices that, except me. Imane is nudging me, wanting answers and so I nod briefly, my eyes refusing to leave Eliott. Then he looks over and catches my eye and his fake happiness drops. A blank expression crosses his face, an expression that I have never seen and don&rsquo;t understand at all. But just as quickly as it appears, it is gone. The smile is back in place and he is turning away, chatting to Idriss and Alex as though nothing is wrong. I slump back in my chair and run a hand over my face. Then I push the seat back and stumble to my feet.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to go,&rdquo; I sign, then turn and dash out of the cafeteria. Tears start to stream down my face and I wipe them angrily away. I don&rsquo;t know why I am so upset. Maybe because whilst I have lost my best friend, everyone else has got to keep him? Maybe because him turning away from me hurts more than I thought possible? Maybe because this entire situation is so bizarre and unfair and I don&rsquo;t know how much longer I can hold on? Whatever the reason, the tears keep on coming. I sniff and push the doors open, stepping out into the blinding sunlight. The small quad is empty, not many people wanting to spend their free time in the old, abandoned garden. I flop down on the bench that stands next to the fish pond and close my eyes, my shoulders shaking with my sobs. One of the worst parts about being deaf is not knowing how loud you are being. I could be as loud as a fog horn or as soft as a mouse and I won&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s hard not to draw attention to yourself when you are unsure of the sounds you are making. Sometimes I hate myself for being deaf. Why can&rsquo;t I just be normal, I will ask the stars, and they&rsquo;ll glisten down upon me, silent and beautiful. When I was fourteen I told Eliott about their silent beauty and asked him why no one had answers for me. He had smiled over at me and replied with, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s why they remind me of you. Beautiful and silent, but with all the secrets of the world hidden within.&rsquo; That was the day that everything changed. Eliott was no longer just my best friend, he became my everything.</p><p>A tap on my shoulder startles me and I jump, glancing upwards. Eliott is standing there, but when he sees my face, he sits down next to me, his one hand clasping mine. He gives it a squeeze before letting go to sign.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Lucas?&rdquo;</p><p>I refuse to meet his gaze, my eyes focused on my hands fidgeting in my lap. He nudges me with his shoulder. I close my eyes, choking on the hollowness inside of me. Why can&rsquo;t I be normal? Eliott&rsquo;s arm slips around my shoulders and I lean into him, soaking in his familiarity. I miss this, I miss him. Even now, when we are getting closer and becoming friends, I miss the old us. The people that we used to be. I look up at Eliott and freeze. Our faces are so close and his breath is fanning my skin. Our eyes bore into each other and something inside of me changes. I glance down and my eyes briefly scan his lips before I meet his eyes again. Thoughts filter through my brain; thoughts that I have never entertained before. What would it be like to kiss him? What would it be like to be loved by Eliott? Elio mouths my name, the gentle caress of <i>Lucas </i>tracing my skin. I gulp and close my eyes. I can&rsquo;t look into his intense gaze. But even with my eyes closed I can feel it burning into me. Then cool lips press against mine, moving cautiously, almost unwillingly. The pressure is light and gentle, the taste of mint soaking into my skin. I slowly move my lips with his, opening my mouth slightly so that his tongue can slip inside. It feels good, better than any kiss I have ever experienced. I can&rsquo;t hear the sounds he is making, but hands can feel the vibrations as I press them against his chest. He buries a hand in my hair, the other cupping my face. We press against each other, heat pooling in the pit of my stomach. Then he pulls away and breaks all contact. I sit there, gasping and panting, sensations shooting through my body. Everything feels so new and intense. I&rsquo;m too scared to open my eyes out of the fear of what I will see in Eliott&rsquo;s eyes. But when I do open the a few moments later, I am greeted by an empty bench and the stillness of the abandoned garden. <i>Eliott is gone.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Imane flops onto my bed, the stack of papers in her hands. She laughs and drops them on the blanket beside her, tilting her head to look at me.</p><p>&ldquo;Did that seriously happen?&rdquo; she asks.</p><p>I shut my laptop and place it back on my desk, before spinning my chair back to face her. I shrug sheepishly. Over the past month, Eliott has ignored me. In an attempt to escape the hurt and confusion at what happened, I proceeded to write down stories about our old lives. I used to write a lot, wanting to become an international best-selling author. But I gave that dream up a few years ago. Now, for the first time in years, someone other than Eliott is reading the stories that I write. I nod.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that happened. We were mischievous kids.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughs. &ldquo;I can tell.&rdquo; She sits up on the bed and smiles at me. &ldquo;These are great. If you changed the names of the characters, no one would know that they were based off real events. Why not try enter a short story competition?&rdquo;</p><p>I shake my head. &ldquo;It just isn&rsquo;t what I want to do.&rdquo;<br />She shrugs. &ldquo;Okay. So, on the subject of Eliott, wanna tell me why you haven&rsquo;t spoken to him in weeks?&rdquo;<br />I roll my eyes. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p><p>Imane stares at me disbelievingly. I don&rsquo;t blame her. The awkward glances Eliott and I have been shooting each other when we don&rsquo;t think the other is looking is enough to send half to the school into a pool of gossip. No wonder one of my closest friends is gnawing at the bit for more information on the situation. Caving, I&rsquo;m about to explain what happened, when Imane suddenly tenses.</p><p>&ldquo;The doorbell rang,&rdquo; she states. <br />I frown. Who the hell would be stopping by on a Sunday? My parents are out of state with work and my sister is at a friends and won&rsquo;t be home till late. I stand up and make my way out the room and down the stairs. I grab the keys off the hook and unlock the door. I&rsquo;m stunned to find Eliott on the other side. He is pale and sick looking, but a determined expression is on his face. <br />&ldquo;Eliott?&rdquo;</p><p>He steps into the house and shuts the door behind him, before turning to me.</p><p>&ldquo;Is your family home?&rdquo;</p><p>I stare at him in confusion. &ldquo;No, but-&ldquo;<br />Before I can finish, Eliott pushes me against the wall, hard. His body presses tightly against my own and one hand rests on the wall next to my head whilst the other grips my hip.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he whispers.</p><p>Then he presses his lips against mine forcefully. I gasp in shock and he uses it to his advantage, slipping his tongue into my mouth. Unable to think clearly, I kiss him back just as brutally. He grinds his crotch against me and I tilt my head back, groaning. Eliott moves his lips onto my throat and sucks harshly, sending unexplainable sensations through my blood. I shiver and cup his face in my hands, dragging his mouth back to my own. He continues to grind against me and I feel myself growing hard. Then Eliott tenses and pulls back. I chase after him blindly, but then I pause when I see Imane standing behind us, her eyes wide and her mouth open. It&rsquo;s easier to read her lips when she yells, &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott says something, but his back is to me so I don&rsquo;t know what it is. Imane just shakes her head in disbelief, before hurriedly signing, &ldquo;Lucas, explain. Now.&rdquo; Then she holds up her hands in defeat and shakes her head. &ldquo;Actually, no. Don&rsquo;t. you two are busy. I&rsquo;m coming over before school tomorrow and you will explain everything to me. Have fun, boys.&rdquo;</p><p>Then she saunters out the house. Eliott turns and glares at me.</p><p>&ldquo;You said no one was home!&rdquo;<br />I shake my head. &ldquo;I said my family wasn&rsquo;t, and I was about to tell you, but you interrupted me.&rdquo;<br />Eliott&rsquo;s glare melts away as he starts to laugh. &ldquo;Oh gosh,&rdquo; he groans. &ldquo;So embarrassing.&rdquo;</p><p>I laugh with him. Then it fades as we meet each other&rsquo;s gaze. Eliott steps closer to me, his hands slipping under my shirt as he looks up at me and speaks his words very slowly and clearly so that I can read his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I like you, Lu. And we can talk later about our relationship later, but right now, I really want to take this upstairs. Is that okay with you?&rdquo;<br />I stare at him for a moment. I know that we should discuss our relationship first, before we rush into anything, but the tingling in my lips and then bugle in my trousers makes it hard to think straight. Besides, this is Eliott. He wouldn&rsquo;t use me for sex and then leave. He just wouldn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s my best friend. So I nod and before I can change my mind, I grab his hand and tug him upstairs. We stumble into my bedroom and immediately lock our lips together once again. Eliott shrugs his jacket off and then reaches for the hem of my shirt. I allow him to pull it off me, but before he can kiss me again, I hold up my hand to stop him.</p><p><i>&ldquo;No sex,&rdquo; </i>I state.</p><p>He nods.<i> &ldquo;No sex,&rdquo;</i> he agrees.</p><p>Then I&rsquo;m yanking his t-shirt off and we are kissing once more.</p><p>*****</p><p>We didn&rsquo;t have sex. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we couldn&rsquo;t mess around a bit. After, we lay in my bed, silent, a smile playing on each of our lips. I fell asleep in his arms and when I woke up around 1am, I found a note on my beside table.</p><p><i>Sorry I had to leave you, but you looked so peaceful and I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to wake you. I&rsquo;ll see you at school tomorrow. We will talk, I promise. This wasn&rsquo;t just a one-time thing, at least not to me.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Love,</i></p><p><i>Your raccoon, Eliott.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Imane had shown up before school, as promised and I had explained the new development in mine and Eliott&rsquo;s relationship to her. She has been pleased for me, sure, but one thing she said really stuck to me.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find it weird that he suddenly likes you, whilst in the other reality, you were never interest in each other that way?&rdquo;</p><p>Now, sitting in biology class, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if she has a point. What if Eliott doesn&rsquo;t like me that way, but feels a connection to me because of our past and he&rsquo;s read into it wrong? Eliott isn&rsquo;t gay. He never once felt attracted to a guy and no, all of a sudden, he wants me. And what about me? I didn&rsquo;t like Eliott. I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t. But kissing him felt so good and so right. And now all I can think about is doing it again. Maybe I should tell Eliott the truth. Maybe I should be honest with him. He&rsquo;d understand, right? Yeah, somehow I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d be as understanding as Imane was. I lean forward and bang my head on my desk. <i>What am I supposed to do now?</i></p></p>",
