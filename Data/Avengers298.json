        "answer": "<p>Never read\u00a0\u2018em. This did remind me, however, of a very different set of anniversary titles Marvel put out for their 75th I\u2019ve been thinking about recently: the <i>Marvel 100th Anniversary</i> books, imagining what their core titles might look like in 2061 (100 years after the debut of the Fantastic Four, rather than the company itself). While I\u2019d only call two out of the five one-shots necessarily \u2018good\u2019, it remains one of my favorite weird mini-events of this sort, since the central conceit isn\u2019t that it\u2019s decades in the future with characters telling their last stories, but what their \u2018normal\u2019 published adventures in those times look like. Without spoiling the contents for those who might want to check these out:\u00a0</p><p>* Jen Van Meter and Joanna Estep\u2019s <i>Fantastic Four</i> - which admittedly does make the time jump unlike the others, though I sort of appreciate that that means none of these are operating on the same page, going wholly with their own interpretation of the conceit - embraces its status as a family legacy book and shows a fundamentally altered team and dynamic, while still adhering to its core and bringing back all the stuff we\u2019ve theoretically missed for awhile in 2061 without compromising what\u2019s worked since. A sweet, satisfying offering.</p><p>* <i>Spider-Man</i> goes all-in on being a random issue off tomorrow\u2019s spinner rack, identifying itself in the recap page as the finale of an eight-part arc (writer Sean Ryan even mentioned having planned out the previous seven issues in an interview, including a major part for Silver Sable that\u2019s not mentioned at all in what we got) and acting as an all-action showdown since the emotional context theoretically would have been established by the lead-in. It\u2019s not great given that, well, we didn\u2019t get any of the build-up, and the dialogue can be pretty on the nose. But In-Hyuk Lee\u2019s art is gorgeously haunting, and Ryan knows how to play into it and more importantly when to shut up, the two working to give this a mood unlike any other Spider-Man story I\u2019ve ever read. If nothing else, as a statement on the future it\u2019s inspiring to think the main Spider-Man title would be permitted the sort of time between issues Lee\u2019s art would surely require, a victory of quality over quantity. Plus, as far as I know, the cover of this was the only comic of the last who-knows-how-long to use my favorite version of the Spider-Man title logo.</p><p>* Robin Furth and Jason Masters\u2019 <i>X-Men</i> is the one of these that really and truly pissed me off, an awkwardly written and weakly penciled ode to plowing over everything interesting that\u2019s been done with the X-Men since the turn of the century, and all the potential yet to come, in favor of returning everything to an eternal Claremontian wonderland, with a bit of \u201c<i>we need to take things slow to beat racism, rushing it\u2019s just gonna get people madder</i>\u201d spice to really hammer home how hard this drops the ball. Yet it feels an appropriate part of this set, an unintentional yet necessary cautionary tale that particularly contrasts well with <i>Fantastic Four\u2019s</i> embrace of past and present alike in search of a brighter future.</p><p>* James Stokoe\u2019s <i>Avengers</i> is the obvious standout, from the bananas recap page to the deluge of concepts and that good good gooooooood Stokoe art. At the same time, while it\u2019s primarily a straightforward adventure (indeed, while <i>Spider-Man</i> makes the biggest show of us joining in medias res with no context due to having this essentially plucked out of time, this is the issue that truly feels the most like a random future Marvel comic rather than a specially chosen anniversary issue), there\u2019s an underlying, relatively subtle meditation on the fundamentally inflexible natures of these characters even as their status quos and the world around them shift. One concluding with a change in their usual tactics that suggests that in spite of that, they can still adapt to the times and become better with time, as heroes in the story and as role models outside of it. This is the comic that not only most feels like it was delivered to us from the future, but the one I most want to believe really does give us a glimpse at what Marvel will one day become.</p><p>* Andy Lanning, Ron Marz, and Gustavo Duarte\u2019s <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> is a comic I factually know I read at some point, since I got it on Comixology years after the fact, but as I recall there\u2019s just nothing there. And perhaps in that regard it\u2019s the truest, most inevitable image of tomorrow of them all: whatever comics may become, the fact of the matter is that as with every other creative medium, there will always, even in 2061, be some stuff that\u2019s just whatever.</p>",

While I\u2019d only call two out of the five one-shots necessarily \u2018good\u2019, it remains one of my favorite weird mini-events of this sort, since the central conceit isn\u2019t that it\u2019s decades in the future with characters telling their last stories, but what their \u2018normal\u2019 published adventures in those times look like. Without spoiling the contents for those who might want to check these out:\u00a0</p><p>* Jen Van Meter and Joanna Estep\u2019s <i>Fantastic Four</i> - which admittedly does make the time jump unlike the others, though I sort of appreciate that that means none of these are operating on the same page, going wholly with their own interpretation of the conceit - embraces its status as a family legacy book and shows a fundamentally altered team and dynamic, while still adhering to its core and bringing back all the stuff we\u2019ve theoretically missed for awhile in 2061 without compromising what\u2019s worked since. A sweet, satisfying offering.</p><p>* <i>Spider-Man</i> goes all-in on being a random issue off tomorrow\u2019s spinner rack, identifying itself in the recap page as the finale of an eight-part arc (writer Sean Ryan even mentioned having planned out the previous seven issues in an interview, including a major part for Silver Sable that\u2019s not mentioned at all in what we got) and acting as an all-action showdown since the emotional context theoretically would have been established by the lead-in. It\u2019s not great given that, well, we didn\u2019t get any of the build-up, and the dialogue can be pretty on the nose. But In-Hyuk Lee\u2019s art is gorgeously haunting, and Ryan knows how to play into it and more importantly when to shut up, the two working to give this a mood unlike any other Spider-Man story I\u2019ve ever read. If nothing else, as a statement on the future it\u2019s inspiring to think the main Spider-Man title would be permitted the sort of time between issues Lee\u2019s art would surely require, a victory of quality over quantity. Plus, as far as I know, the cover of this was the only comic of the last who-knows-how-long to use my favorite version of the Spider-Man title logo.</p><p>* Robin Furth and Jason Masters\u2019 <i>X-Men</i> is the one of these that really and truly pissed me off, an awkwardly written and weakly penciled ode to plowing over everything interesting that\u2019s been done with the X-Men since the turn of the century, and all the potential yet to come, in favor of returning everything to an eternal Claremontian wonderland, with a bit of \u201c<i>we need to take things slow to beat racism, rushing it\u2019s just gonna get people madder</i>\u201d spice to really hammer home how hard this drops the ball. Yet it feels an appropriate part of this set, an unintentional yet necessary cautionary tale that particularly contrasts well with <i>Fantastic Four\u2019s</i> embrace of past and present alike in search of a brighter future.</p><p>* James Stokoe\u2019s <i>Avengers</i> is the obvious standout, from the bananas recap page to the deluge of concepts and that good good gooooooood Stokoe art. At the same time, while it\u2019s primarily a straightforward adventure (indeed, while <i>Spider-Man</i> makes the biggest show of us joining in medias res with no context due to having this essentially plucked out of time, this is the issue that truly feels the most like a random future Marvel comic rather than a specially chosen anniversary issue), there\u2019s an underlying, relatively subtle meditation on the fundamentally inflexible natures of these characters even as their status quos and the world around them shift. One concluding with a change in their usual tactics that suggests that in spite of that, they can still adapt to the times and become better with time, as heroes in the story and as role models outside of it. This is the comic that not only most feels like it was delivered to us from the future, but the one I most want to believe really does give us a glimpse at what Marvel will one day become.</p><p>* Andy Lanning, Ron Marz, and Gustavo Duarte\u2019s <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> is a comic I factually know I read at some point, since I got it on Comixology years after the fact, but as I recall there\u2019s just nothing there. And perhaps in that regard it\u2019s the truest, most inevitable image of tomorrow of them all: whatever comics may become, the fact of the matter is that as with every other creative medium, there will always, even in 2061, be some stuff that\u2019s just whatever.</p>",
