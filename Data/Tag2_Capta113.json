She can punch you to your death. She is charming. She is powerful beyond approach. Her main (and perhaps her only) point of reckoning in the story is to remember that she is indeed, powerful. Symbolically, that may mean something but in terms of narrative level, that\u2019s bland. It\u2019s wanting. We don\u2019t get to see the complexity of who she is, that she is more than just a powerful jock who can outpunch other superheroes. Her backstory, her growth, lacks emotional pull. Her growth is not internal. She is born badass, so there\u2019s no point in growing other than remembering that she is that. An essentialist take on \u201cfemalehood\u201d like what was shown in this movie is as harmful as any misogynist claim of what \u201cfemalehood\u201d or \u201cwomanhood\u201d is. In all this, where exactly is Carol Danvers? Or are we supposed to project ourselves to her yet again? </p><p>I\u2019m disappointed because I thought we are beyond this notion that female characters are strong mainly because they can kick some ass. In wanting to communicate symbolism, the storyline has to flatten a female character yet again. Brie Larson is a competent actress, and she did elevate the script by being herself. Yet, the story is too scattered and most of the inspiring aspects of the movie are simply two step away from being awesome. I want more than female leads in my superhero stories. What I want are competently written characters, no matter what role they take. </p><p>Before you accused me of not getting this movie at all,  I understand the message: We, women, are born strong. Sometimes we forget that part of ourselves because we are silenced by men, we make ourselves believe that we are weak. As Danvers finally remembers who she is, we also must remember that we are also born powerful. I get it. My main disappointment is that you can make this kind of symbolism without having to sacrifice the complexity of your female lead. </p><p>If only the presentation of the story is less lackadaisical, if it has tighter script, if the fighting scenes are more innovative, I would not be as disappointed as I am now.</p><p>Again, tell me, other than having a superhero whose sole personality is being so powerful, what else does Captain Marvel offer? </p>",

She can punch you to your death. She is charming. She is powerful beyond approach. Her main (and perhaps her only) point of reckoning in the story is to remember that she is indeed, powerful. Symbolically, that may mean something but in terms of narrative level, that\u2019s bland. It\u2019s wanting. We don\u2019t get to see the complexity of who she is, that she is more than just a powerful jock who can outpunch other superheroes. Her backstory, her growth, lacks emotional pull. Her growth is not internal. She is born badass, so there\u2019s no point in growing other than remembering that she is that. An essentialist take on \u201cfemalehood\u201d like what was shown in this movie is as harmful as any misogynist claim of what \u201cfemalehood\u201d or \u201cwomanhood\u201d is. In all this, where exactly is Carol Danvers? Or are we supposed to project ourselves to her yet again? </p><p>I\u2019m disappointed because I thought we are beyond this notion that female characters are strong mainly because they can kick some ass. In wanting to communicate symbolism, the storyline has to flatten a female character yet again. Brie Larson is a competent actress, and she did elevate the script by being herself. Yet, the story is too scattered and most of the inspiring aspects of the movie are simply two step away from being awesome. I want more than female leads in my superhero stories. What I want are competently written characters, no matter what role they take. </p><p>Before you accused me of not getting this movie at all,  I understand the message: We, women, are born strong. Sometimes we forget that part of ourselves because we are silenced by men, we make ourselves believe that we are weak. As Danvers finally remembers who she is, we also must remember that we are also born powerful. I get it. My main disappointment is that you can make this kind of symbolism without having to sacrifice the complexity of your female lead. </p><p>If only the presentation of the story is less lackadaisical, if it has tighter script, if the fighting scenes are more innovative, I would not be as disappointed as I am now.</p><p>Again, tell me, other than having a superhero whose sole personality is being so powerful, what else does Captain Marvel offer? </p>",
