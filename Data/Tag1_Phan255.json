Dan idles the car in a queue for about ten minutes waiting for one particularly obnoxious pink limo to do a seventy-point turn in an attempt to get out of the exit again. Amanda coos over the colour of the awful car, nose pressed almost to the glass, and Phil gently teases her for being a stereotype.<b><br/></b></p><p>She rolls her eyes and swats him in the shoulder. \u201cGirls are allowed to like pink.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs and pokes her in the side, making her smile. Dan watches the fond exchange in the rearview mirror, lips pressed together. Eventually, he finds a parking space, though it\u2019s a tight squeeze between the hundreds of cars that have shown up here tonight. He switches off the engine, blank eyes staring out of the windscreen at the building in front of him. They\u2019re about half an hour late, so the parking lot is pretty much deserted \u2013 everyone is already inside. The back door of the car opens, and Amanda begins climbing out, complaining and laughing at once about how difficult it is to elegantly clamber out of a car in a big dress and heels. Dan\u2019s fingertips tingle. He\u2019s already mentally projecting to the next available smoking opportunity.</p><p>Phil leans forwards then, his chin resting on the back of Dan\u2019s seat. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna come in, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan is silent for a moment. \u201cActually, I was thinking I might wait out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease come in,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Prom without my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Venom sears Dan\u2019s throat, he swallows it down but it stings. \u201cIs that what we are?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes meet in the mirror, and Phil looks desperate, as though he\u2019s begging Dan not to push it. Luckily for him, Amanda knocks on the glass of the back window, making a face that says \u2018what\u2019s the hold up?\u2019.</p><p>Phil gives him one last pleading look, and Dan\u2019s resolve breaks. Reluctantly, he sighs, and unplugs his seatbelt.</p><!-- more --><p>Prom is everything Dan expected, and worse. The hall is crammed with his peers, each of them decked out in a taffeta frock, or a cheap rented suit \u2013 with the exception of the Elites, of course, all of whom wear tight designer dresses, or tailored tuxedos.</p><p>The Elites have commandeered a table near the back, and are lounging around it holding plastic stem glasses of what appears to be punch, but Dan suspects is not. There\u2019s a stage in the hall, on which a marginally terrible band is playing a mashup of chart hits, the majority of which Dan only knows because Louise forces him to have Radio One playing in the caf\u00e9 at all hours.</p><p>There are paper chains, and a glitterball, and cr\u00eape-papered tables holding punch bowls and bowls of crisps. It\u2019s the kind of Prom that Dan has seen in a dozen American high school movies, which isn\u2019t that surprising, as the Prom-planning committee\u2019s inspiration was <i>Pretty In Pink</i>.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s attention is stolen by the entrance of Phil with Amanda Jones on his arm. Hardy, over at the Elite table, glares across the room at them, sour-faced. He\u2019s wearing a white tuxedo, as if he could get any more douchey, and seems to have brought a different Elite girl as his date, though he doesn\u2019t appear to be paying too much attention to her.</p><p>Dan can\u2019t imagine that Amanda would be welcomed if she tried to go over to her usual possy, but she doesn\u2019t so much as look their direction. Phil, looking slightly uncomfortable under the scrutiny of near everyone in the room, leads Amanda through the crowd towards the punch table. Dan follows solemnly behind them; distracted as they are by the scandalous date of the century, nobody pays him any attention at all.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cThis punch tastes like ass,\u201d Dan says, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they made me use Diet lemonade,\u201d Lee says. \u201cIt\u2019s gross.\u201d</p><p>If Dan asked Lee why he\u2019d chosen to volunteer at the Sixth Form Prom, doling out ladlefuls of disgusting punch to a load of teenagers that are sneaking vodka into it anyway, he\u2019d probably say that he had nothing better to do with his Friday night, or that he came to watch everyone be \u2018tragic\u2019. In reality, he is almost definitely here to hang around Dan. In another timeline, Dan might find this annoying, but tonight he\u2019s glad of the company.</p><p>The punch table is on the periphery of the dancefloor; in the centre, a few brave couples have already started vaguely swaying together to the cacophony of noise the band is making. One of those couples are Phil and Amanda.</p><p>Dan would have put good money on the fact that Phil cannot dance, and he\u2019d have won the bet. Phil is tall, and clumsy, with two left feet and a tendency to not know where to place his hands. Amanda seems to find this utter incompetence on his part incredibly endearing, and keeps laughing every time Phil steps on her pointed shoes.</p><p>The moment they began, she picked up Phil\u2019s hands and placed them straight on her hips, then slung hers around his neck, just as Dan said she would. They\u2019re awkward, and due to their height difference the movements are far from graceful, but they\u2019re having fun, apparently, if their laughter is anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cGot a cold?\u201d Lee asks, handing Dan a napkin.</p><p>Dan sniffs for the hundredth time, shrugging, and takes it from him. \u201cCan we get out of here? Go for a smoke or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got something even better,\u201d Lee says with a grin.</p><p>He reaches discreetly into the pocket of his sweatpants, and exposes the tip of a flask. He tucks it away quickly before any of the patrolling teachers notice.</p><p>\u201cYou make yourself useful, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Dan says, then inclines his head, and starts to make his way over to the hall doors.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGeez, that\u2019s a bit full on,\u201d Lee says, staring into Amanda\u2019s painted face. The canvas is bigger than Dan remembers it being. \u201cWhat\u2019s he planning on doing with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna gift it to her, apparently,\u201d Dan replies.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s already taken the flask from Lee, and is sipping it quietly, perched up on a desk. Phil\u2019s left a few paintbrushes and dried up palettes scattered about the place, but the usual vibrancy he brings to the art studio is missing. Now, the room seems bereft, dark.</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d Lee says, leaning close to peer into Amanda\u2019s vacant brown eyes.</p><p>Dan takes another sip of what tastes vaguely like whiskey, but is probably more likely to be a mixture of a few spirits Lee swiped from his parents\u2019 liquor cabinet in order to avoid being caught.</p><p>\u201cI want a cigarette. Let\u2019s sit behind here,\u201d Dan says, walking around to the back of a big stack of blank canvases, propped against a desk. In the tight space behind them, he and Lee will be impossible to see from the door if a teacher comes snooping. Lee follows him obediently, squatting down in the small nook. Dan offers him the flask while he digs around for his pack of cigarettes, but Lee refuses.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you need it more, mate.\u201d</p><p>Dan wants to call him out on this statement, argue and demand he explain himself, but he thinks better of it. So what if his misery is written all over his face? Lee is too up his ass to do anything with the information that Dan might be crushing on Phil, if he has indeed picked up on it. Dan puts the flask between his knees and pulls two cigarettes out of his rapidly depleting pack of Djarums.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Dan says, not giving Lee a chance to refuse. He hands one of the cigarettes over, and pulls out a lighter. The first drag is glorious. A thick rush of nicotine sluices through Dan from head to fingertips. Lee lights his up after a moment, too, then promptly splutters, grimacing.</p><p>He puts it straight out again. \u201cEugh, what the fuck\u2019s that? All perfumey.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts with laughter, about to explain that they\u2019re flavoured, but right then, voices permeate the quiet air, right outside the door. Dan looks forlornly at his cigarette, which he\u2019s only just begun. He takes another deep drag, then one more, breathing it out in a long rush just as the door opens. Then he stubs it out on the tiled floor.</p><p>\u201c\u2026you think you could do a better job of it?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart plummets straight through his ribcage, landing on the floor with a pathetic \u2018plop\u2019. He imagines he can see it pulsating weakly on the tile beside his the ashes of his cigarette. It\u2019s Amanda\u2019s voice. Which means\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey, maybe that\u2019s my calling,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI could be the next big thing in the cover band world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do agree that you couldn\u2019t be any worse than that lot,\u201d Amanda agrees. \u201cBut I guess we can\u2019t be too critical- what the\u2026 oh my God.\u201d</p><p>Her voice falls away, leaving only the stagnant silence of this room in its wake. A few seconds pass, and then there\u2019s the sound of her kitten heels tritting slowly across the floor. She\u2019s approaching the canvas, on the other side of where Dan and Lee hide. The door closes, and Dan hears Phil moving cautiously further into the studio. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to capture you,\u201d Phil says; Dan can <i>feel</i> the nerves in his best friend\u2019s voice. \u201cI wanted to do something big, but there\u2019s so much about you I didn\u2019t manage to get right-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Amanda interrupts. Her voice is choked. Dan swallows down a gulp of tobacco flavoured saliva. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this. You painted this? By hand?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says. \u201cFor you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Amanda says; yep, she\u2019s definitely choking back tears. Desperate to escape, Dan looks around himself for a possible exit, but without Amanda and Phil seeing him, there\u2019s no choice but to just sit here and listen. He brings his knuckles up to bite at them. \u201cWhy would you do this for me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Phil says, and <i>oh God</i>, Dan had almost forgotten. </p><p>Eyes smarting, Dan hears the rustle of Phil digging around in his suit pocket. Phil steps forward, closing the gap between he and the girl of his dreams. A moment passes, and then she gasps. </p><p>\u201cOh my God, Phil I can\u2019t\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me explain,\u201d Phil says. Amanda stays quiet. \u201cI know you spend every day wishing you were born differently, watching your friends glide through life with ease just because they have money. I know it makes you feel inferior to them. It shouldn\u2019t, because you\u2019re perfect. That\u2019s why I wanted to paint you, to show you that to me, at least, you\u2019re flawless.\u201d </p><p>Dan shifts quietly. The floor is hardening beneath him, making it impossible to stay still. He catches Lee watching him, fingers covering his mouth in an attempt to stay quiet. <i>It doesn\u2019t matter</i>, he wants to shout at Lee, <i>they\u2019d never notice us. Even if we screamed</i>. </p><p>Dan wants to put his fingers in his ears to block it out, but Lee might ask him why later, and Dan can\u2019t handle it. So he just grits his teeth and tells himself it won\u2019t last forever, and that later he can deal with the pain. He remembers, belatedly, the flask laying in his lap, so unscrews the cap and pours a great deal of whatever is inside into his mouth. It tastes disgusting, but then he has another swig, and it goes down a little easier. </p><p>\u201cI bought you these because you deserve them,\u201d Phil tells Amanda then, and Dan knows he must be handing her the earrings. Those beautiful black pearls on silver stems. \u201cI want you to feel like you ought to feel. I want you to feel as precious as I see you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d Amanda says, weakly. \u201cI can\u2019t accept them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease take them,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI want to show you what you\u2019re worth.\u201d </p><p>A quiet falls, and all Dan can hear is vague rustling. Lee is staring at him now, his eyes feel like they\u2019re boring into his skull. It might be something to do with the tear that\u2019s just fallen down Dan\u2019s cheek. </p><p>\u201cHow do they look?\u201d Amanda says after a while. </p><p>To Dan\u2019s surprise, Phil doesn\u2019t respond straight away. Dan kind of wants to peer his head over the canvases and see for himself. Maybe they really do look hideous on her; Dan had always thought they weren\u2019t really her usual style. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says then, though his voice is not at all convincing. \u201cReally nice.\u201d </p><p><i>Tip-tap </i>go\u00a0Amanda\u2019s shoes as she closes the distance between them. Dan can\u2019t help it, he shifts again, bum numbed by the horrible hard tile. As he moves, he realises there\u2019s a slit between two canvases, allowing him just enough space to see through if he leans awkwardly. In the tiny gap, he watches, heart tearing itself down the middle, as Amanda\u2019s hand rests on Phil\u2019s chin, and she tiptoes up to press a kiss to his lips. </p><p>At this point, the tears are too insistent to try and hold back. Lee can think what he wants. Dan sips more of the flask, and sinks back to his former position, hating himself for torturing his own heart this way. </p><p>\u201cCan you smell cherry?\u201d Amanda asks then, and Dan freezes. He turns to Lee, wide-eyed. </p><p>Like they\u2019re connected, Dan can feel it in his chest as the realisation floods over Phil. He hears the guilt in his silence, and aches from it. Phil will sweep his gaze over the room, will note the strange wall of canvases and know at once what they hide. He will know, <i>of course he will know</i>, and now he will pretend he doesn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d Phil says, just like Dan knew he would. There\u2019s a slit in his voice, like it\u2019s about to crack, to splinter into bits. \u201cI can\u2019t smell anything. Come on, let\u2019s go back to the dance.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Lee says for maybe the fifth time. \u201cDan, are you alright?\u201d </p><p>The jumble of art supplies in front of Dan seems to be moving. The supplies swirl about randomly, paint brushes blending into charcoals, oil pastels bleeding into one another, creating a brown sludge. </p><p>\u201c \u2018m fine,\u201d Dan gets out. He tries to drain the last of the flask, but finds that it\u2019s somehow already empty. He turns to Lee, eyes blurred from the film of moisture gathered in his ducts. \u201cHey,\u201d he slurs, pushing the empty flask at him. \u201cYou\u2019re sober, right?\u201d </p><p>Warily, Lee nods. </p><p>Dan digs in his trouser pocket for Ricky\u2019s car keys. \u201cI need a favour.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>The bright lights and jarring, staticky noise coming from the ancient speakers is a lot worse now that Dan\u2019s mind is thickened with alcohol. He pushes through seemingly hoards of people, some of whom grunt and shout things at him, indignant. These people, his classmates, seem alien to him, their faces unrecognisable, distorted and strange. </p><p>He\u2019s trying to find the exit, but ends up at the back of the room somehow, with all the tables. Amanda and Phil are sat at one, just the two of them, sharing a glass of punch, their cheeks rosy with happiness. Amanda\u2019s earlobes are glistening with two black pearls. </p><p>Just as a wash of bile crawls up Dan\u2019s throat, something happens. It shatters the warping, undulating bubble of Dan\u2019s drunken state, and everything clatters into clarity just as Hardy Jenns\u2019 fist slams down in front of Phil, shaking the table. Phil leaps to his feet, stricken, and Hardy starts to yell. </p><p>\u201c&hellip;showing up here with my girl on your arm! Who the fuck d\u2019you think you are, you little shitbox, I\u2019m gonna punch your lights out!\u201d</p><p>Dan watches in alarm, a tiny <i>\u2018no\u2019</i> slipping from his lips. He surges forwards, straight through a gaggle of girls on the periphery of the dance floor, and lunges. Hardy\u2019s fist draws back, his teeth bared into a snarl as he pulls his weight into the incoming punch. He swings, fast, but Dan is faster. Phil falls to the floor with how hard Dan barrels into him, but it doesn\u2019t matter, because Hardy\u2019s fist misses him by centimetres, and connects with the bone of Dan\u2019s right cheek instead. It makes a dull \u2018thwack\u2019, and Dan is thrown backwards by the force of it. </p><p>The alcohol numbs the pain, but it throbs unbearably even so. He straightens up, clutching his face and swearing loudly. Phil, on the floor still, has his mouth open in shock.</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake, not you again,\u201d Hardy growls. There\u2019s a slur to his voice too; Dan clearly isn\u2019t the only one imbibing this evening.\u00a0\u201cThought I told you to tell your boyfriend to leave my girl alone!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan jabs a finger at Hardy, breathing hard through the pain.\u00a0\u201cGet away from him, Hardy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The corner of Hardy\u2019s mouth curls into a nasty sneer.\u00a0\u201cOr what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>For a moment, Dan just glares at him. He notices Phil struggling to sit up in the periphery of his vision, and is momentarily distracted. He turns, noting the terror on Phil\u2019s face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan, just leave it,\u201d Phil garbles, urgently.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, okay?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, whore,\u201d Hardy says, drawing Dan\u2019s attention again. He\u2019s still got that smug, shit-eating smirk on his face. Dan\u2019s fist begins to curl. Oh, he\u2019s been aching for a release, and this is all too perfectly set up to resist.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave it? Go back to whatever back room you crawled out of, wait for the next John to pull down his fly for you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says, from somewhere seemingly far away.\u00a0\u201cDan, ignore him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Drunkenly, Dan turns to Phil for a split second. He shoots him a stupid grin, allowing the rush of white heat and anger to flood him, and then lunges forwards, his own fist connecting with Hardy\u2019s jaw.<br/></p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d Phil calls out. The concern in his voice is blissful. It slips into Dan\u2019s bloodstream, giving him the energy to land a second punch on Hardy\u2019s stupid forehead. This time, it knocks him backwards, and he crashes onto the table behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan, stop!\u201d Phil\u2019s voice is shrill.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck off me you little cunt,\u201d Hardy shouts, as Dan grabs him by the lapels\u00a0of his idiotic white suit, slamming him down against the table he\u2019s sprawled on, so the back of his skull thunks against it. Amanda is still sitting down, watching with wide-eyes; Dan doesn\u2019t spare her a glance. He\u2019s seething, livid, and Hardy\u2019s stupid, ignorant face suddenly represents every reason why.\u00a0</p><p>Dan knows he doesn\u2019t look like he could lift a fruitfly, but he\u2019s had to toughen up, living where he does. He\u2019s stronger than anyone he knows his age, which people don\u2019t expect. By the look on Hardy\u2019s face, he\u2019s no exception. Dan slaps Hardy sharp across the cheek, hard enough to leave a red mark come morning. They\u2019ve gathered a crowd now, so it won\u2019t be long until a teacher notices and comes over to break them up. So, Dan brings his face close to Hardy\u2019s, close enough that the dickhead should be able to smell the nicotine on his breath.</p><p>\u201cAmanda is not your girl,\u201d Dan hisses. \u201cShe can do whatever she wants. And mercifully, that\u2019s not you anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d There\u2019s something urgent and worried in Hardy\u2019s tone. Dan\u2019s half on top of him now, and it seems to be making Hardy even more furious. Dan\u2019s having to exert a lot of energy just pinning him here.\u00a0\u201cGet the fuck off me you fag fuck!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>And then, it all becomes painfully clear.\u00a0</p><p>The anger recedes a little as Dan\u2019s knee comes into contact with a rather obvious bulge. His eyebrows lift, and Hardy\u2019s terror is palpable. Dan sends him a little\u00a0\u2018gotcha\u2019 smile.\u00a0</p><p>He leans forwards, feeling Hardy go limp, sensing the defeat.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t think you and I will be having a problem anymore, do you?\u201d</p><p>Hardy doesn\u2019t respond at first, so Dan pushes his knee sharply into Hardy\u2019s crotch, and he shakes his head quickly.\u00a0\u201cPlease move,\u201d Hardy begs.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll back off, I swear. Just don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSwear to me you\u2019ll leave him alone,\u201d Dan says, knee still jammed up against Hardy\u2019s erection.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI swear, fuck.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd Amanda.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Hardy says hurriedly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you tell your Dad, and get me fired,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI will tell everyone about what I felt here tonight.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Hardy nods inn understanding, cheeks aflame.\u00a0Dan releases him then, and wipes his hands on his shirt in disgust. Hardy doesn\u2019t move for a minute. There\u2019s a wide, stunned look in his eyes, as though he\u2019s not sure of his next move. He casts a quick, frightened gaze around the room, meeting the eyes of every onlooker, and then jumps up, fleeing to the hall doors.</p><p>Bizarrely, just as Dan turns to go, it\u2019s Amanda\u2019s gaze that he catches. She\u2019s staring at him wonderingly, calmly, despite having seen him beat up and threaten her ex moments ago. In her right thumb and forefinger, she twiddles one of her earrings. Dan turns from her then, nauseated, eye and cheek throbbing, and pushes back into the crowd. He can see the glowing exit sign now, and the crowds seem all too happy to part as he moves towards it. He doesn\u2019t care about these people anymore, nor did he ever. So they\u2019ve finally seen just what happens when somebody pisses off the scary emo kid just a little too much. Let them be scared of him. Maybe it\u2019ll make them leave him alone. </p><p>He\u2019s almost at the door, almost free from this horrendous night, when something catches his arm. When Dan turns to see who is stopping him, he has to stop himself from throwing more punches. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Phil asks; his eyes are red. Dan tastes blood. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d </p><p>Dan licks the corner of his mouth. His lip ring is missing, and there\u2019s blood pooled there. It must have ripped out during the fight. He wipes the blood with the back of his hand, hardly caring. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 home,\u201d Dan says, dejected. The alcohol in his system has swooped back into play, and he feels drunk again, the adrenaline of the pain and violence gone. \u201cI\u2019ve given Lee th\u2019keys t\u2019Ricky\u2019s car. He agreed to drive you and Amanda back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Phil begs him. He seems desperate, and Dan cannot fathom why. \u201cPlease, just stay for a while, we can talk, I can get you some ice-\u201d</p><p>Dan pulls free of Phil\u2019s grip, annoyed. \u201cIf y\u2019wanted t\u2019talk t\u2019me, y\u2019could\u2019ve this morning. Now\u2019m tired, and drunk, and\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let Hardy punch you?\u201d Phil\u2019s blue eyes are deep and watery. Dan could throw anchors into them, made of longing, and hurt, and misery, but they\u2019d never reach the bottoms - they\u2019re too deep. \u201cWhy did you push me out of the way?\u201d </p><p>The question, to Dan, is absurd. \u201cB\u2019cause he was going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan whispers. He tastes blood again. \u201cI won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. You\u2019re the only thing that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou matter,\u201d Phil whispers back. \u201cYou matter to me.\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts in derision, not bothering to reply. Instead, he turns away, and pushes through the fire exit, out into the cold night beyond</p><p>*</p><p>The vodka in Dan\u2019s blood is making the dense, humid air shimmer. He\u2019s wrapped in someone\u2019s arms, grinding on someone\u2019s thigh. There\u2019s a sultry, pulsating beat all around him. He thinks maybe, before, there was a finger in his mouth, a small blue pill pressed onto his tongue. Dark grey eyes are locked on his, and as they move to the music, Dan can feel warmth, sweat, hands on his hips. </p><p>He wishes he were in bed, not here, with the covers pulled over him, and a pillow to softly soak up the tears. But going home would mean facing Ricky, and perhaps getting another punch thrown at him for kicks. Dan doesn\u2019t even have his brother\u2019s car anymore. Facing Ricky\u2019s wrath without it would be suicidal. The right side of his face throbs and aches. It\u2019s bruised badly, Dan saw it in Ozone\u2019s cracked bathroom mirror. His eye is swollen, making it hard to see. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna cost me to take you home?\u201d A rough, gravelly voice says into Dan\u2019s ear.</p><p>It\u2019s a little surprising Dan is able to pull anyone in the state he\u2019s in. Damaged goods are apparently not a dealbreaker for the dudes in here. A rush of something blissful and heady threads itself through Dan\u2019s body, making him wonder what exactly it was that he swallowed half an hour ago, compressed into that tiny pill. He welcomes the rush of pleasure even so, closing his aching eyes as he allows the drug to sweep away the pain. </p><p>He leans forwards, lips to the guy\u2019s ear, and says: \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d </p><p>(<b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/179356571622/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Nine</a>!)</b></p>",

He switches off the engine, blank eyes staring out of the windscreen at the building in front of him. They\u2019re about half an hour late, so the parking lot is pretty much deserted \u2013 everyone is already inside. The back door of the car opens, and Amanda begins climbing out, complaining and laughing at once about how difficult it is to elegantly clamber out of a car in a big dress and heels. Dan\u2019s fingertips tingle. He\u2019s already mentally projecting to the next available smoking opportunity.</p><p>Phil leans forwards then, his chin resting on the back of Dan\u2019s seat. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna come in, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan is silent for a moment. \u201cActually, I was thinking I might wait out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease come in,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Prom without my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Venom sears Dan\u2019s throat, he swallows it down but it stings. \u201cIs that what we are?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes meet in the mirror, and Phil looks desperate, as though he\u2019s begging Dan not to push it.

Reluctantly, he sighs, and unplugs his seatbelt.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Prom is everything Dan expected, and worse. The hall is crammed with his peers, each of them decked out in a taffeta frock, or a cheap rented suit \u2013 with the exception of the Elites, of course, all of whom wear tight designer dresses, or tailored tuxedos.</p><p>The Elites have commandeered a table near the back, and are lounging around it holding plastic stem glasses of what appears to be punch, but Dan suspects is not. There\u2019s a stage in the hall, on which a marginally terrible band is playing a mashup of chart hits, the majority of which Dan only knows because Louise forces him to have Radio One playing in the caf\u00e9 at all hours.</p><p>There are paper chains, and a glitterball, and cr\u00eape-papered tables holding punch bowls and bowls of crisps. It\u2019s the kind of Prom that Dan has seen in a dozen American high school movies, which isn\u2019t that surprising, as the Prom-planning committee\u2019s inspiration was <i>Pretty In Pink</i>.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s attention is stolen by the entrance of Phil with Amanda Jones on his arm. Hardy, over at the Elite table, glares across the room at them, sour-faced. He\u2019s wearing a white tuxedo, as if he could get any more douchey, and seems to have brought a different Elite girl as his date, though he doesn\u2019t appear to be paying too much attention to her.</p><p>Dan can\u2019t imagine that Amanda would be welcomed if she tried to go over to her usual possy, but she doesn\u2019t so much as look their direction. Phil, looking slightly uncomfortable under the scrutiny of near everyone in the room, leads Amanda through the crowd towards the punch table. Dan follows solemnly behind them; distracted as they are by the scandalous date of the century, nobody pays him any attention at all.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cThis punch tastes like ass,\u201d Dan says, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they made me use Diet lemonade,\u201d Lee says. \u201cIt\u2019s gross.\u201d</p><p>If Dan asked Lee why he\u2019d chosen to volunteer at the Sixth Form Prom, doling out ladlefuls of disgusting punch to a load of teenagers that are sneaking vodka into it anyway, he\u2019d probably say that he had nothing better to do with his Friday night, or that he came to watch everyone be \u2018tragic\u2019. In reality, he is almost definitely here to hang around Dan. In another timeline, Dan might find this annoying, but tonight he\u2019s glad of the company.</p><p>The punch table is on the periphery of the dancefloor; in the centre, a few brave couples have already started vaguely swaying together to the cacophony of noise the band is making. One of those couples are Phil and Amanda.</p><p>Dan would have put good money on the fact that Phil cannot dance, and he\u2019d have won the bet. Phil is tall, and clumsy, with two left feet and a tendency to not know where to place his hands. Amanda seems to find this utter incompetence on his part incredibly endearing, and keeps laughing every time Phil steps on her pointed shoes.</p><p>The moment they began, she picked up Phil\u2019s hands and placed them straight on her hips, then slung hers around his neck, just as Dan said she would. They\u2019re awkward, and due to their height difference the movements are far from graceful, but they\u2019re having fun, apparently, if their laughter is anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cGot a cold?\u201d Lee asks, handing Dan a napkin.</p><p>Dan sniffs for the hundredth time, shrugging, and takes it from him. \u201cCan we get out of here? Go for a smoke or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got something even better,\u201d Lee says with a grin.</p><p>He reaches discreetly into the pocket of his sweatpants, and exposes the tip of a flask. He tucks it away quickly before any of the patrolling teachers notice.</p><p>\u201cYou make yourself useful, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Dan says, then inclines his head, and starts to make his way over to the hall doors.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGeez, that\u2019s a bit full on,\u201d Lee says, staring into Amanda\u2019s painted face. The canvas is bigger than Dan remembers it being. \u201cWhat\u2019s he planning on doing with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna gift it to her, apparently,\u201d Dan replies.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s already taken the flask from Lee, and is sipping it quietly, perched up on a desk. Phil\u2019s left a few paintbrushes and dried up palettes scattered about the place, but the usual vibrancy he brings to the art studio is missing. Now, the room seems bereft, dark.</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d Lee says, leaning close to peer into Amanda\u2019s vacant brown eyes.</p><p>Dan takes another sip of what tastes vaguely like whiskey, but is probably more likely to be a mixture of a few spirits Lee swiped from his parents\u2019 liquor cabinet in order to avoid being caught.</p><p>\u201cI want a cigarette. Let\u2019s sit behind here,\u201d Dan says, walking around to the back of a big stack of blank canvases, propped against a desk. In the tight space behind them, he and Lee will be impossible to see from the door if a teacher comes snooping. Lee follows him obediently, squatting down in the small nook. Dan offers him the flask while he digs around for his pack of cigarettes, but Lee refuses.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you need it more, mate.\u201d</p><p>Dan wants to call him out on this statement, argue and demand he explain himself, but he thinks better of it. So what if his misery is written all over his face? Lee is too up his ass to do anything with the information that Dan might be crushing on Phil, if he has indeed picked up on it. Dan puts the flask between his knees and pulls two cigarettes out of his rapidly depleting pack of Djarums.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Dan says, not giving Lee a chance to refuse. He hands one of the cigarettes over, and pulls out a lighter. The first drag is glorious. A thick rush of nicotine sluices through Dan from head to fingertips. Lee lights his up after a moment, too, then promptly splutters, grimacing.</p><p>He puts it straight out again. \u201cEugh, what the fuck\u2019s that? All perfumey.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts with laughter, about to explain that they\u2019re flavoured, but right then, voices permeate the quiet air, right outside the door. Dan looks forlornly at his cigarette, which he\u2019s only just begun. He takes another deep drag, then one more, breathing it out in a long rush just as the door opens. Then he stubs it out on the tiled floor.</p><p>\u201c\u2026you think you could do a better job of it?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart plummets straight through his ribcage, landing on the floor with a pathetic \u2018plop\u2019. He imagines he can see it pulsating weakly on the tile beside his the ashes of his cigarette. It\u2019s Amanda\u2019s voice. Which means\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey, maybe that\u2019s my calling,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI could be the next big thing in the cover band world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do agree that you couldn\u2019t be any worse than that lot,\u201d Amanda agrees. \u201cBut I guess we can\u2019t be too critical- what the\u2026 oh my God.\u201d</p><p>Her voice falls away, leaving only the stagnant silence of this room in its wake. A few seconds pass, and then there\u2019s the sound of her kitten heels tritting slowly across the floor. She\u2019s approaching the canvas, on the other side of where Dan and Lee hide. The door closes, and Dan hears Phil moving cautiously further into the studio. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to capture you,\u201d Phil says; Dan can <i>feel</i> the nerves in his best friend\u2019s voice. \u201cI wanted to do something big, but there\u2019s so much about you I didn\u2019t manage to get right-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Amanda interrupts. Her voice is choked. Dan swallows down a gulp of tobacco flavoured saliva. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this. You painted this? By hand?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says. \u201cFor you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Amanda says; yep, she\u2019s definitely choking back tears. Desperate to escape, Dan looks around himself for a possible exit, but without Amanda and Phil seeing him, there\u2019s no choice but to just sit here and listen. He brings his knuckles up to bite at them. \u201cWhy would you do this for me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Phil says, and <i>oh God</i>, Dan had almost forgotten. </p><p>Eyes smarting, Dan hears the rustle of Phil digging around in his suit pocket. Phil steps forward, closing the gap between he and the girl of his dreams. A moment passes, and then she gasps. </p><p>\u201cOh my God, Phil I can\u2019t\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me explain,\u201d Phil says. Amanda stays quiet. \u201cI know you spend every day wishing you were born differently, watching your friends glide through life with ease just because they have money. I know it makes you feel inferior to them. It shouldn\u2019t, because you\u2019re perfect. That\u2019s why I wanted to paint you, to show you that to me, at least, you\u2019re flawless.\u201d </p><p>Dan shifts quietly. The floor is hardening beneath him, making it impossible to stay still. He catches Lee watching him, fingers covering his mouth in an attempt to stay quiet. <i>It doesn\u2019t matter</i>, he wants to shout at Lee, <i>they\u2019d never notice us. Even if we screamed</i>. </p><p>Dan wants to put his fingers in his ears to block it out, but Lee might ask him why later, and Dan can\u2019t handle it. So he just grits his teeth and tells himself it won\u2019t last forever, and that later he can deal with the pain. He remembers, belatedly, the flask laying in his lap, so unscrews the cap and pours a great deal of whatever is inside into his mouth. It tastes disgusting, but then he has another swig, and it goes down a little easier. </p><p>\u201cI bought you these because you deserve them,\u201d Phil tells Amanda then, and Dan knows he must be handing her the earrings. Those beautiful black pearls on silver stems. \u201cI want you to feel like you ought to feel. I want you to feel as precious as I see you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d Amanda says, weakly. \u201cI can\u2019t accept them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease take them,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI want to show you what you\u2019re worth.\u201d </p><p>A quiet falls, and all Dan can hear is vague rustling. Lee is staring at him now, his eyes feel like they\u2019re boring into his skull. It might be something to do with the tear that\u2019s just fallen down Dan\u2019s cheek. </p><p>\u201cHow do they look?\u201d Amanda says after a while. </p><p>To Dan\u2019s surprise, Phil doesn\u2019t respond straight away. Dan kind of wants to peer his head over the canvases and see for himself. Maybe they really do look hideous on her; Dan had always thought they weren\u2019t really her usual style. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says then, though his voice is not at all convincing. \u201cReally nice.\u201d </p><p><i>Tip-tap </i>go\u00a0Amanda\u2019s shoes as she closes the distance between them. Dan can\u2019t help it, he shifts again, bum numbed by the horrible hard tile. As he moves, he realises there\u2019s a slit between two canvases, allowing him just enough space to see through if he leans awkwardly. In the tiny gap, he watches, heart tearing itself down the middle, as Amanda\u2019s hand rests on Phil\u2019s chin, and she tiptoes up to press a kiss to his lips. </p><p>At this point, the tears are too insistent to try and hold back. Lee can think what he wants. Dan sips more of the flask, and sinks back to his former position, hating himself for torturing his own heart this way. </p><p>\u201cCan you smell cherry?\u201d Amanda asks then, and Dan freezes. He turns to Lee, wide-eyed. </p><p>Like they\u2019re connected, Dan can feel it in his chest as the realisation floods over Phil. He hears the guilt in his silence, and aches from it. Phil will sweep his gaze over the room, will note the strange wall of canvases and know at once what they hide. He will know, <i>of course he will know</i>, and now he will pretend he doesn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d Phil says, just like Dan knew he would. There\u2019s a slit in his voice, like it\u2019s about to crack, to splinter into bits. \u201cI can\u2019t smell anything. Come on, let\u2019s go back to the dance.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Lee says for maybe the fifth time. \u201cDan, are you alright?\u201d </p><p>The jumble of art supplies in front of Dan seems to be moving. The supplies swirl about randomly, paint brushes blending into charcoals, oil pastels bleeding into one another, creating a brown sludge. </p><p>\u201c \u2018m fine,\u201d Dan gets out. He tries to drain the last of the flask, but finds that it\u2019s somehow already empty. He turns to Lee, eyes blurred from the film of moisture gathered in his ducts. \u201cHey,\u201d he slurs, pushing the empty flask at him. \u201cYou\u2019re sober, right?\u201d </p><p>Warily, Lee nods. </p><p>Dan digs in his trouser pocket for Ricky\u2019s car keys. \u201cI need a favour.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>The bright lights and jarring, staticky noise coming from the ancient speakers is a lot worse now that Dan\u2019s mind is thickened with alcohol. He pushes through seemingly hoards of people, some of whom grunt and shout things at him, indignant. These people, his classmates, seem alien to him, their faces unrecognisable, distorted and strange. </p><p>He\u2019s trying to find the exit, but ends up at the back of the room somehow, with all the tables. Amanda and Phil are sat at one, just the two of them, sharing a glass of punch, their cheeks rosy with happiness. Amanda\u2019s earlobes are glistening with two black pearls. </p><p>Just as a wash of bile crawls up Dan\u2019s throat, something happens. It shatters the warping, undulating bubble of Dan\u2019s drunken state, and everything clatters into clarity just as Hardy Jenns\u2019 fist slams down in front of Phil, shaking the table. Phil leaps to his feet, stricken, and Hardy starts to yell. </p><p>\u201c\u2026showing up here with my girl on your arm! Who the fuck d\u2019you think you are, you little shitbox, I\u2019m gonna punch your lights out!\u201d</p><p>Dan watches in alarm, a tiny <i>\u2018no\u2019</i> slipping from his lips. He surges forwards, straight through a gaggle of girls on the periphery of the dance floor, and lunges. Hardy\u2019s fist draws back, his teeth bared into a snarl as he pulls his weight into the incoming punch. He swings, fast, but Dan is faster. Phil falls to the floor with how hard Dan barrels into him, but it doesn\u2019t matter, because Hardy\u2019s fist misses him by centimetres, and connects with the bone of Dan\u2019s right cheek instead. It makes a dull \u2018thwack\u2019, and Dan is thrown backwards by the force of it. </p><p>The alcohol numbs the pain, but it throbs unbearably even so. He straightens up, clutching his face and swearing loudly. Phil, on the floor still, has his mouth open in shock.</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake, not you again,\u201d Hardy growls. There\u2019s a slur to his voice too; Dan clearly isn\u2019t the only one imbibing this evening.\u00a0\u201cThought I told you to tell your boyfriend to leave my girl alone!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan jabs a finger at Hardy, breathing hard through the pain.\u00a0\u201cGet away from him, Hardy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The corner of Hardy\u2019s mouth curls into a nasty sneer.\u00a0\u201cOr what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>For a moment, Dan just glares at him. He notices Phil struggling to sit up in the periphery of his vision, and is momentarily distracted. He turns, noting the terror on Phil\u2019s face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan, just leave it,\u201d Phil garbles, urgently.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, okay?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, whore,\u201d Hardy says, drawing Dan\u2019s attention again. He\u2019s still got that smug, shit-eating smirk on his face. Dan\u2019s fist begins to curl. Oh, he\u2019s been aching for a release, and this is all too perfectly set up to resist.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave it? Go back to whatever back room you crawled out of, wait for the next John to pull down his fly for you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says, from somewhere seemingly far away.\u00a0\u201cDan, ignore him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Drunkenly, Dan turns to Phil for a split second. He shoots him a stupid grin, allowing the rush of white heat and anger to flood him, and then lunges forwards, his own fist connecting with Hardy\u2019s jaw.<br></p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d Phil calls out. The concern in his voice is blissful. It slips into Dan\u2019s bloodstream, giving him the energy to land a second punch on Hardy\u2019s stupid forehead. This time, it knocks him backwards, and he crashes onto the table behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan, stop!\u201d Phil\u2019s voice is shrill.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck off me you little cunt,\u201d Hardy shouts, as Dan grabs him by the lapels\u00a0of his idiotic white suit, slamming him down against the table he\u2019s sprawled on, so the back of his skull thunks against it. Amanda is still sitting down, watching with wide-eyes; Dan doesn\u2019t spare her a glance. He\u2019s seething, livid, and Hardy\u2019s stupid, ignorant face suddenly represents every reason why.\u00a0</p><p>Dan knows he doesn\u2019t look like he could lift a fruitfly, but he\u2019s had to toughen up, living where he does. He\u2019s stronger than anyone he knows his age, which people don\u2019t expect. By the look on Hardy\u2019s face, he\u2019s no exception. Dan slaps Hardy sharp across the cheek, hard enough to leave a red mark come morning. They\u2019ve gathered a crowd now, so it won\u2019t be long until a teacher notices and comes over to break them up. So, Dan brings his face close to Hardy\u2019s, close enough that the dickhead should be able to smell the nicotine on his breath.</p><p>\u201cAmanda is not your girl,\u201d Dan hisses. \u201cShe can do whatever she wants. And mercifully, that\u2019s not you anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d There\u2019s something urgent and worried in Hardy\u2019s tone. Dan\u2019s half on top of him now, and it seems to be making Hardy even more furious. Dan\u2019s having to exert a lot of energy just pinning him here.\u00a0\u201cGet the fuck off me you fag fuck!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>And then, it all becomes painfully clear.\u00a0</p><p>The anger recedes a little as Dan\u2019s knee comes into contact with a rather obvious bulge. His eyebrows lift, and Hardy\u2019s terror is palpable. Dan sends him a little\u00a0\u2018gotcha\u2019 smile.\u00a0</p><p>He leans forwards, feeling Hardy go limp, sensing the defeat.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t think you and I will be having a problem anymore, do you?\u201d</p><p>Hardy doesn\u2019t respond at first, so Dan pushes his knee sharply into Hardy\u2019s crotch, and he shakes his head quickly.\u00a0\u201cPlease move,\u201d Hardy begs.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll back off, I swear. Just don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSwear to me you\u2019ll leave him alone,\u201d Dan says, knee still jammed up against Hardy\u2019s erection.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI swear, fuck.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd Amanda.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Hardy says hurriedly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf you tell your Dad, and get me fired,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI will tell everyone about what I felt here tonight.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Hardy nods inn understanding, cheeks aflame.\u00a0Dan releases him then, and wipes his hands on his shirt in disgust. Hardy doesn\u2019t move for a minute. There\u2019s a wide, stunned look in his eyes, as though he\u2019s not sure of his next move. He casts a quick, frightened gaze around the room, meeting the eyes of every onlooker, and then jumps up, fleeing to the hall doors.</p><p>Bizarrely, just as Dan turns to go, it\u2019s Amanda\u2019s gaze that he catches. She\u2019s staring at him wonderingly, calmly, despite having seen him beat up and threaten her ex moments ago. In her right thumb and forefinger, she twiddles one of her earrings. Dan turns from her then, nauseated, eye and cheek throbbing, and pushes back into the crowd. He can see the glowing exit sign now, and the crowds seem all too happy to part as he moves towards it. He doesn\u2019t care about these people anymore, nor did he ever. So they\u2019ve finally seen just what happens when somebody pisses off the scary emo kid just a little too much. Let them be scared of him. Maybe it\u2019ll make them leave him alone. </p><p>He\u2019s almost at the door, almost free from this horrendous night, when something catches his arm. When Dan turns to see who is stopping him, he has to stop himself from throwing more punches. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Phil asks; his eyes are red. Dan tastes blood. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d </p><p>Dan licks the corner of his mouth. His lip ring is missing, and there\u2019s blood pooled there. It must have ripped out during the fight. He wipes the blood with the back of his hand, hardly caring. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 home,\u201d Dan says, dejected. The alcohol in his system has swooped back into play, and he feels drunk again, the adrenaline of the pain and violence gone. \u201cI\u2019ve given Lee th\u2019keys t\u2019Ricky\u2019s car. He agreed to drive you and Amanda back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Phil begs him. He seems desperate, and Dan cannot fathom why. \u201cPlease, just stay for a while, we can talk, I can get you some ice-\u201d</p><p>Dan pulls free of Phil\u2019s grip, annoyed. \u201cIf y\u2019wanted t\u2019talk t\u2019me, y\u2019could\u2019ve this morning. Now\u2019m tired, and drunk, and\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let Hardy punch you?\u201d Phil\u2019s blue eyes are deep and watery. Dan could throw anchors into them, made of longing, and hurt, and misery, but they\u2019d never reach the bottoms - they\u2019re too deep. \u201cWhy did you push me out of the way?\u201d </p><p>The question, to Dan, is absurd. \u201cB\u2019cause he was going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan whispers. He tastes blood again. \u201cI won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. You\u2019re the only thing that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou matter,\u201d Phil whispers back. \u201cYou matter to me.\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts in derision, not bothering to reply. Instead, he turns away, and pushes through the fire exit, out into the cold night beyond</p><p>*</p><p>The vodka in Dan\u2019s blood is making the dense, humid air shimmer. He\u2019s wrapped in someone\u2019s arms, grinding on someone\u2019s thigh. There\u2019s a sultry, pulsating beat all around him. He thinks maybe, before, there was a finger in his mouth, a small blue pill pressed onto his tongue. Dark grey eyes are locked on his, and as they move to the music, Dan can feel warmth, sweat, hands on his hips. </p><p>He wishes he were in bed, not here, with the covers pulled over him, and a pillow to softly soak up the tears. But going home would mean facing Ricky, and perhaps getting another punch thrown at him for kicks. Dan doesn\u2019t even have his brother\u2019s car anymore. Facing Ricky\u2019s wrath without it would be suicidal. The right side of his face throbs and aches. It\u2019s bruised badly, Dan saw it in Ozone\u2019s cracked bathroom mirror. His eye is swollen, making it hard to see. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna cost me to take you home?\u201d A rough, gravelly voice says into Dan\u2019s ear.</p><p>It\u2019s a little surprising Dan is able to pull anyone in the state he\u2019s in. Damaged goods are apparently not a dealbreaker for the dudes in here. A rush of something blissful and heady threads itself through Dan\u2019s body, making him wonder what exactly it was that he swallowed half an hour ago, compressed into that tiny pill. He welcomes the rush of pleasure even so, closing his aching eyes as he allows the drug to sweep away the pain. </p><p>He leans forwards, lips to the guy\u2019s ear, and says: \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d </p><p>(<b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/179356571622/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Nine</a>!)</b></p>",

Dan idles the car in a queue for about ten minutes waiting for one particularly obnoxious pink limo to do a seventy-point turn in an attempt to get out of the exit again. Amanda coos over the colour of the awful car, nose pressed almost to the glass, and Phil gently teases her for being a stereotype.<b><br></b></p><p>She rolls her eyes and swats him in the shoulder. \u201cGirls are allowed to like pink.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs and pokes her in the side, making her smile. Dan watches the fond exchange in the rearview mirror, lips pressed together. Eventually, he finds a parking space, though it\u2019s a tight squeeze between the hundreds of cars that have shown up here tonight. He switches off the engine, blank eyes staring out of the windscreen at the building in front of him. They\u2019re about half an hour late, so the parking lot is pretty much deserted \u2013 everyone is already inside. The back door of the car opens, and Amanda begins climbing out, complaining and laughing at once about how difficult it is to elegantly clamber out of a car in a big dress and heels. Dan\u2019s fingertips tingle. He\u2019s already mentally projecting to the next available smoking opportunity.</p><p>Phil leans forwards then, his chin resting on the back of Dan\u2019s seat. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna come in, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan is silent for a moment. \u201cActually, I was thinking I might wait out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease come in,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Prom without my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Venom sears Dan\u2019s throat, he swallows it down but it stings. \u201cIs that what we are?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes meet in the mirror, and Phil looks desperate, as though he\u2019s begging Dan not to push it. Luckily for him, Amanda knocks on the glass of the back window, making a face that says \u2018what\u2019s the hold up?\u2019.</p><p>Phil gives him one last pleading look, and Dan\u2019s resolve breaks. Reluctantly, he sighs, and unplugs his seatbelt.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Prom is everything Dan expected, and worse. The hall is crammed with his peers, each of them decked out in a taffeta frock, or a cheap rented suit \u2013 with the exception of the Elites, of course, all of whom wear tight designer dresses, or tailored tuxedos.</p><p>The Elites have commandeered a table near the back, and are lounging around it holding plastic stem glasses of what appears to be punch, but Dan suspects is not. There\u2019s a stage in the hall, on which a marginally terrible band is playing a mashup of chart hits, the majority of which Dan only knows because Louise forces him to have Radio One playing in the caf\u00e9 at all hours.</p><p>There are paper chains, and a glitterball, and cr\u00eape-papered tables holding punch bowls and bowls of crisps. It\u2019s the kind of Prom that Dan has seen in a dozen American high school movies, which isn\u2019t that surprising, as the Prom-planning committee\u2019s inspiration was <i>Pretty In Pink</i>.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s attention is stolen by the entrance of Phil with Amanda Jones on his arm. Hardy, over at the Elite table, glares across the room at them, sour-faced. He\u2019s wearing a white tuxedo, as if he could get any more douchey, and seems to have brought a different Elite girl as his date, though he doesn\u2019t appear to be paying too much attention to her.</p><p>Dan can\u2019t imagine that Amanda would be welcomed if she tried to go over to her usual possy, but she doesn\u2019t so much as look their direction. Phil, looking slightly uncomfortable under the scrutiny of near everyone in the room, leads Amanda through the crowd towards the punch table. Dan follows solemnly behind them; distracted as they are by the scandalous date of the century, nobody pays him any attention at all.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cThis punch tastes like ass,\u201d Dan says, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they made me use Diet lemonade,\u201d Lee says. \u201cIt\u2019s gross.\u201d</p><p>If Dan asked Lee why he\u2019d chosen to volunteer at the Sixth Form Prom, doling out ladlefuls of disgusting punch to a load of teenagers that are sneaking vodka into it anyway, he\u2019d probably say that he had nothing better to do with his Friday night, or that he came to watch everyone be \u2018tragic\u2019. In reality, he is almost definitely here to hang around Dan. In another timeline, Dan might find this annoying, but tonight he\u2019s glad of the company.</p><p>The punch table is on the periphery of the dancefloor; in the centre, a few brave couples have already started vaguely swaying together to the cacophony of noise the band is making. One of those couples are Phil and Amanda.</p><p>Dan would have put good money on the fact that Phil cannot dance, and he\u2019d have won the bet. Phil is tall, and clumsy, with two left feet and a tendency to not know where to place his hands. Amanda seems to find this utter incompetence on his part incredibly endearing, and keeps laughing every time Phil steps on her pointed shoes.</p><p>The moment they began, she picked up Phil\u2019s hands and placed them straight on her hips, then slung hers around his neck, just as Dan said she would. They\u2019re awkward, and due to their height difference the movements are far from graceful, but they\u2019re having fun, apparently, if their laughter is anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cGot a cold?\u201d Lee asks, handing Dan a napkin.</p><p>Dan sniffs for the hundredth time, shrugging, and takes it from him. \u201cCan we get out of here? Go for a smoke or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got something even better,\u201d Lee says with a grin.</p><p>He reaches discreetly into the pocket of his sweatpants, and exposes the tip of a flask. He tucks it away quickly before any of the patrolling teachers notice.</p><p>\u201cYou make yourself useful, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Dan says, then inclines his head, and starts to make his way over to the hall doors.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGeez, that\u2019s a bit full on,\u201d Lee says, staring into Amanda\u2019s painted face. The canvas is bigger than Dan remembers it being. \u201cWhat\u2019s he planning on doing with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna gift it to her, apparently,\u201d Dan replies.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s already taken the flask from Lee, and is sipping it quietly, perched up on a desk. Phil\u2019s left a few paintbrushes and dried up palettes scattered about the place, but the usual vibrancy he brings to the art studio is missing. Now, the room seems bereft, dark.</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d Lee says, leaning close to peer into Amanda\u2019s vacant brown eyes.</p><p>Dan takes another sip of what tastes vaguely like whiskey, but is probably more likely to be a mixture of a few spirits Lee swiped from his parents\u2019 liquor cabinet in order to avoid being caught.</p><p>\u201cI want a cigarette. Let\u2019s sit behind here,\u201d Dan says, walking around to the back of a big stack of blank canvases, propped against a desk. In the tight space behind them, he and Lee will be impossible to see from the door if a teacher comes snooping. Lee follows him obediently, squatting down in the small nook. Dan offers him the flask while he digs around for his pack of cigarettes, but Lee refuses.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you need it more, mate.\u201d</p><p>Dan wants to call him out on this statement, argue and demand he explain himself, but he thinks better of it. So what if his misery is written all over his face? Lee is too up his ass to do anything with the information that Dan might be crushing on Phil, if he has indeed picked up on it. Dan puts the flask between his knees and pulls two cigarettes out of his rapidly depleting pack of Djarums.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Dan says, not giving Lee a chance to refuse. He hands one of the cigarettes over, and pulls out a lighter. The first drag is glorious. A thick rush of nicotine sluices through Dan from head to fingertips. Lee lights his up after a moment, too, then promptly splutters, grimacing.</p><p>He puts it straight out again. \u201cEugh, what the fuck\u2019s that? All perfumey.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts with laughter, about to explain that they\u2019re flavoured, but right then, voices permeate the quiet air, right outside the door. Dan looks forlornly at his cigarette, which he\u2019s only just begun. He takes another deep drag, then one more, breathing it out in a long rush just as the door opens. Then he stubs it out on the tiled floor.</p><p>\u201c\u2026you think you could do a better job of it?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart plummets straight through his ribcage, landing on the floor with a pathetic \u2018plop\u2019. He imagines he can see it pulsating weakly on the tile beside his the ashes of his cigarette. It\u2019s Amanda\u2019s voice. Which means\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey, maybe that\u2019s my calling,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI could be the next big thing in the cover band world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do agree that you couldn\u2019t be any worse than that lot,\u201d Amanda agrees. \u201cBut I guess we can\u2019t be too critical- what the\u2026 oh my God.\u201d</p><p>Her voice falls away, leaving only the stagnant silence of this room in its wake. A few seconds pass, and then there\u2019s the sound of her kitten heels tritting slowly across the floor. She\u2019s approaching the canvas, on the other side of where Dan and Lee hide. The door closes, and Dan hears Phil moving cautiously further into the studio. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to capture you,\u201d Phil says; Dan can <i>feel</i> the nerves in his best friend\u2019s voice. \u201cI wanted to do something big, but there\u2019s so much about you I didn\u2019t manage to get right-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Amanda interrupts. Her voice is choked. Dan swallows down a gulp of tobacco flavoured saliva. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this. You painted this? By hand?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says. \u201cFor you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Amanda says; yep, she\u2019s definitely choking back tears. Desperate to escape, Dan looks around himself for a possible exit, but without Amanda and Phil seeing him, there\u2019s no choice but to just sit here and listen. He brings his knuckles up to bite at them. \u201cWhy would you do this for me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Phil says, and <i>oh God</i>, Dan had almost forgotten. </p><p>Eyes smarting, Dan hears the rustle of Phil digging around in his suit pocket. Phil steps forward, closing the gap between he and the girl of his dreams. A moment passes, and then she gasps. </p><p>\u201cOh my God, Phil I can\u2019t\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me explain,\u201d Phil says. Amanda stays quiet. \u201cI know you spend every day wishing you were born differently, watching your friends glide through life with ease just because they have money. I know it makes you feel inferior to them. It shouldn\u2019t, because you\u2019re perfect. That\u2019s why I wanted to paint you, to show you that to me, at least, you\u2019re flawless.\u201d </p><p>Dan shifts quietly. The floor is hardening beneath him, making it impossible to stay still. He catches Lee watching him, fingers covering his mouth in an attempt to stay quiet. <i>It doesn\u2019t matter</i>, he wants to shout at Lee, <i>they\u2019d never notice us. Even if we screamed</i>. </p><p>Dan wants to put his fingers in his ears to block it out, but Lee might ask him why later, and Dan can\u2019t handle it. So he just grits his teeth and tells himself it won\u2019t last forever, and that later he can deal with the pain. He remembers, belatedly, the flask laying in his lap, so unscrews the cap and pours a great deal of whatever is inside into his mouth. It tastes disgusting, but then he has another swig, and it goes down a little easier. </p><p>\u201cI bought you these because you deserve them,\u201d Phil tells Amanda then, and Dan knows he must be handing her the earrings. Those beautiful black pearls on silver stems. \u201cI want you to feel like you ought to feel. I want you to feel as precious as I see you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d Amanda says, weakly. \u201cI can\u2019t accept them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease take them,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI want to show you what you\u2019re worth.\u201d </p><p>A quiet falls, and all Dan can hear is vague rustling. Lee is staring at him now, his eyes feel like they\u2019re boring into his skull. It might be something to do with the tear that\u2019s just fallen down Dan\u2019s cheek. </p><p>\u201cHow do they look?\u201d Amanda says after a while. </p><p>To Dan\u2019s surprise, Phil doesn\u2019t respond straight away. Dan kind of wants to peer his head over the canvases and see for himself. Maybe they really do look hideous on her; Dan had always thought they weren\u2019t really her usual style. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says then, though his voice is not at all convincing. \u201cReally nice.\u201d </p><p><i>Tip-tap </i>go\u00a0Amanda\u2019s shoes as she closes the distance between them. Dan can\u2019t help it, he shifts again, bum numbed by the horrible hard tile. As he moves, he realises there\u2019s a slit between two canvases, allowing him just enough space to see through if he leans awkwardly. In the tiny gap, he watches, heart tearing itself down the middle, as Amanda\u2019s hand rests on Phil\u2019s chin, and she tiptoes up to press a kiss to his lips. </p><p>At this point, the tears are too insistent to try and hold back. Lee can think what he wants. Dan sips more of the flask, and sinks back to his former position, hating himself for torturing his own heart this way. </p><p>\u201cCan you smell cherry?\u201d Amanda asks then, and Dan freezes. He turns to Lee, wide-eyed. </p><p>Like they\u2019re connected, Dan can feel it in his chest as the realisation floods over Phil. He hears the guilt in his silence, and aches from it. Phil will sweep his gaze over the room, will note the strange wall of canvases and know at once what they hide. He will know, <i>of course he will know</i>, and now he will pretend he doesn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d Phil says, just like Dan knew he would. There\u2019s a slit in his voice, like it\u2019s about to crack, to splinter into bits. \u201cI can\u2019t smell anything. Come on, let\u2019s go back to the dance.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Lee says for maybe the fifth time. \u201cDan, are you alright?\u201d </p><p>The jumble of art supplies in front of Dan seems to be moving. The supplies swirl about randomly, paint brushes blending into charcoals, oil pastels bleeding into one another, creating a brown sludge. </p><p>\u201c \u2018m fine,\u201d Dan gets out. He tries to drain the last of the flask, but finds that it\u2019s somehow already empty. He turns to Lee, eyes blurred from the film of moisture gathered in his ducts. \u201cHey,\u201d he slurs, pushing the empty flask at him. \u201cYou\u2019re sober, right?\u201d </p><p>Warily, Lee nods. </p><p>Dan digs in his trouser pocket for Ricky\u2019s car keys. \u201cI need a favour.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>The bright lights and jarring, staticky noise coming from the ancient speakers is a lot worse now that Dan\u2019s mind is thickened with alcohol. He pushes through seemingly hoards of people, some of whom grunt and shout things at him, indignant. These people, his classmates, seem alien to him, their faces unrecognisable, distorted and strange. </p><p>He\u2019s trying to find the exit, but ends up at the back of the room somehow, with all the tables. Amanda and Phil are sat at one, just the two of them, sharing a glass of punch, their cheeks rosy with happiness. Amanda\u2019s earlobes are glistening with two black pearls. </p><p>Just as a wash of bile crawls up Dan\u2019s throat, something happens. It shatters the warping, undulating bubble of Dan\u2019s drunken state, and everything clatters into clarity just as Hardy Jenns\u2019 fist slams down in front of Phil, shaking the table. Phil leaps to his feet, stricken, and Hardy starts to yell. </p><p>\u201c\u2026showing up here with my girl on your arm! Who the fuck d\u2019you think you are, you little shitbox, I\u2019m gonna punch your lights out!\u201d</p><p>Dan watches in alarm, a tiny <i>\u2018no\u2019</i> slipping from his lips. He surges forwards, straight through a gaggle of girls on the periphery of the dance floor, and lunges. Hardy\u2019s fist draws back, his teeth bared into a snarl as he pulls his weight into the incoming punch. He swings, fast, but Dan is faster. Phil falls to the floor with how hard Dan barrels into him, but it doesn\u2019t matter, because Hardy\u2019s fist misses him by centimetres, and connects with the bone of Dan\u2019s right cheek instead. It makes a dull \u2018thwack\u2019, and Dan is thrown backwards by the force of it. </p><p>The alcohol numbs the pain, but it throbs unbearably even so. He straightens up, clutching his face and swearing loudly. Phil, on the floor still, has his mouth open in shock.</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake, not you again,\u201d Hardy growls. There\u2019s a slur to his voice too; Dan clearly isn\u2019t the only one imbibing this evening.\u00a0\u201cThought I told you to tell your boyfriend to leave my girl alone!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan jabs a finger at Hardy, breathing hard through the pain.\u00a0\u201cGet away from him, Hardy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The corner of Hardy\u2019s mouth curls into a nasty sneer.\u00a0\u201cOr what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>For a moment, Dan just glares at him. He notices Phil struggling to sit up in the periphery of his vision, and is momentarily distracted. He turns, noting the terror on Phil\u2019s face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan, just leave it,\u201d Phil garbles, urgently.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, okay?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, whore,\u201d Hardy says, drawing Dan\u2019s attention again. He\u2019s still got that smug, shit-eating smirk on his face. Dan\u2019s fist begins to curl. Oh, he\u2019s been aching for a release, and this is all too perfectly set up to resist.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave it? Go back to whatever back room you crawled out of, wait for the next John to pull down his fly for you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says, from somewhere seemingly far away.\u00a0\u201cDan, ignore him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Drunkenly, Dan turns to Phil for a split second. He shoots him a stupid grin, allowing the rush of white heat and anger to flood him, and then lunges forwards, his own fist connecting with Hardy\u2019s jaw.<br></p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d Phil calls out. The concern in his voice is blissful. It slips into Dan\u2019s bloodstream, giving him the energy to land a second punch on Hardy\u2019s stupid forehead. This time, it knocks him backwards, and he crashes onto the table behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan, stop!\u201d Phil\u2019s voice is shrill.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck off me you little cunt,\u201d Hardy shouts, as Dan grabs him by the lapels\u00a0of his idiotic white suit, slamming him down against the table he\u2019s sprawled on, so the back of his skull thunks against it. Amanda is still sitting down, watching with wide-eyes; Dan doesn\u2019t spare her a glance. He\u2019s seething, livid, and Hardy\u2019s stupid, ignorant face suddenly represents every reason why.\u00a0</p><p>Dan knows he doesn\u2019t look like he could lift a fruitfly, but he\u2019s had to toughen up, living where he does. He\u2019s stronger than anyone he knows his age, which people don\u2019t expect. By the look on Hardy\u2019s face, he\u2019s no exception. Dan slaps Hardy sharp across the cheek, hard enough to leave a red mark come morning. They\u2019ve gathered a crowd now, so it won\u2019t be long until a teacher notices and comes over to break them up. So, Dan brings his face close to Hardy\u2019s, close enough that the dickhead should be able to smell the nicotine on his breath.</p><p>\u201cAmanda is not your girl,\u201d Dan hisses. \u201cShe can do whatever she wants. And mercifully, that\u2019s not you anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d There\u2019s something urgent and worried in Hardy\u2019s tone. Dan\u2019s half on top of him now, and it seems to be making Hardy even more furious. Dan\u2019s having to exert a lot of energy just pinning him here.\u00a0\u201cGet the fuck off me you fag fuck!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>And then, it all becomes painfully clear.\u00a0</p><p>The anger recedes a little as Dan\u2019s knee comes into contact with a rather obvious bulge. His eyebrows lift, and Hardy\u2019s terror is palpable. Dan sends him a little\u00a0\u2018gotcha\u2019 smile.\u00a0</p><p>He leans forwards, feeling Hardy go limp, sensing the defeat.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t think you and I will be having a problem anymore, do you?\u201d</p><p>Hardy doesn\u2019t respond at first, so Dan pushes his knee sharply into Hardy\u2019s crotch, and he shakes his head quickly.\u00a0\u201cPlease move,\u201d Hardy begs.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll back off, I swear. Just don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSwear to me you\u2019ll leave him alone,\u201d Dan says, knee still jammed up against Hardy\u2019s erection.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI swear, fuck.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd Amanda.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Hardy says hurriedly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf you tell your Dad, and get me fired,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI will tell everyone about what I felt here tonight.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Hardy nods inn understanding, cheeks aflame.\u00a0Dan releases him then, and wipes his hands on his shirt in disgust. Hardy doesn\u2019t move for a minute. There\u2019s a wide, stunned look in his eyes, as though he\u2019s not sure of his next move. He casts a quick, frightened gaze around the room, meeting the eyes of every onlooker, and then jumps up, fleeing to the hall doors.</p><p>Bizarrely, just as Dan turns to go, it\u2019s Amanda\u2019s gaze that he catches. She\u2019s staring at him wonderingly, calmly, despite having seen him beat up and threaten her ex moments ago. In her right thumb and forefinger, she twiddles one of her earrings. Dan turns from her then, nauseated, eye and cheek throbbing, and pushes back into the crowd. He can see the glowing exit sign now, and the crowds seem all too happy to part as he moves towards it. He doesn\u2019t care about these people anymore, nor did he ever. So they\u2019ve finally seen just what happens when somebody pisses off the scary emo kid just a little too much. Let them be scared of him. Maybe it\u2019ll make them leave him alone. </p><p>He\u2019s almost at the door, almost free from this horrendous night, when something catches his arm. When Dan turns to see who is stopping him, he has to stop himself from throwing more punches. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Phil asks; his eyes are red. Dan tastes blood. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d </p><p>Dan licks the corner of his mouth. His lip ring is missing, and there\u2019s blood pooled there. It must have ripped out during the fight. He wipes the blood with the back of his hand, hardly caring. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 home,\u201d Dan says, dejected. The alcohol in his system has swooped back into play, and he feels drunk again, the adrenaline of the pain and violence gone. \u201cI\u2019ve given Lee th\u2019keys t\u2019Ricky\u2019s car. He agreed to drive you and Amanda back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Phil begs him. He seems desperate, and Dan cannot fathom why. \u201cPlease, just stay for a while, we can talk, I can get you some ice-\u201d</p><p>Dan pulls free of Phil\u2019s grip, annoyed. \u201cIf y\u2019wanted t\u2019talk t\u2019me, y\u2019could\u2019ve this morning. Now\u2019m tired, and drunk, and\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let Hardy punch you?\u201d Phil\u2019s blue eyes are deep and watery. Dan could throw anchors into them, made of longing, and hurt, and misery, but they\u2019d never reach the bottoms - they\u2019re too deep. \u201cWhy did you push me out of the way?\u201d </p><p>The question, to Dan, is absurd. \u201cB\u2019cause he was going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan whispers. He tastes blood again. \u201cI won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. You\u2019re the only thing that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou matter,\u201d Phil whispers back. \u201cYou matter to me.\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts in derision, not bothering to reply. Instead, he turns away, and pushes through the fire exit, out into the cold night beyond</p><p>*</p><p>The vodka in Dan\u2019s blood is making the dense, humid air shimmer. He\u2019s wrapped in someone\u2019s arms, grinding on someone\u2019s thigh. There\u2019s a sultry, pulsating beat all around him. He thinks maybe, before, there was a finger in his mouth, a small blue pill pressed onto his tongue. Dark grey eyes are locked on his, and as they move to the music, Dan can feel warmth, sweat, hands on his hips. </p><p>He wishes he were in bed, not here, with the covers pulled over him, and a pillow to softly soak up the tears. But going home would mean facing Ricky, and perhaps getting another punch thrown at him for kicks. Dan doesn\u2019t even have his brother\u2019s car anymore. Facing Ricky\u2019s wrath without it would be suicidal. The right side of his face throbs and aches. It\u2019s bruised badly, Dan saw it in Ozone\u2019s cracked bathroom mirror. His eye is swollen, making it hard to see. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna cost me to take you home?\u201d A rough, gravelly voice says into Dan\u2019s ear.</p><p>It\u2019s a little surprising Dan is able to pull anyone in the state he\u2019s in. Damaged goods are apparently not a dealbreaker for the dudes in here. A rush of something blissful and heady threads itself through Dan\u2019s body, making him wonder what exactly it was that he swallowed half an hour ago, compressed into that tiny pill. He welcomes the rush of pleasure even so, closing his aching eyes as he allows the drug to sweep away the pain. </p><p>He leans forwards, lips to the guy\u2019s ear, and says: \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d </p><p>(<b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/179356571622/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Nine</a>!)</b></p>",

Phil is loud, excitable, and irritatingly happy all of the time. Phil seems to find Dan&rsquo;s perpetual attitude funny, and despite Dan&rsquo;s best efforts to shun him and everyone else, wants to be around him all the time. That is, until Phil starts talking about Amanda Jones.<br /></i><b>Word Count:</b> WIP (Estimated 12-15 chapters) updates every Tuesday<br /><b>Rating:</b> Explicit<br /><b>Warnings:</b> Smoking, swearing, implied prostitution, broken home, class divide/classism, pining, light homophobia, sex <br /><br /></p><p><b>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/177738852529/some-kind-of-folliful-new-fic\">Chapter One</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/177982263491/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Two</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178227297225/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Three</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178454752236/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Four</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178671704545/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Five</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178676195090/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Six</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178893484577/edgelorddan-x-obliviousbisexualphil-au-chapter\">Chapter Seven</a>]</b></p><p><b>[<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15894954%2Fchapters%2F37042212&amp;t=YWVmOTliMzc0MTkyZDFjZTFkMzVmMzM4NmFlOGJjZDJmODI1Njk5YixVNUVvdGxGag%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AA-PgA5Z7k9tbi8i-ePCy7Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffeels-forever.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F177763348310%2Fsome-kind-of-folliful-new-fic&amp;m=1\">Ao3</a>!]</b></p><p>The school parking lot is rammed with limousines and Rolls Royce&rsquo;s. Dan idles the car in a queue for about ten minutes waiting for one particularly obnoxious pink limo to do a seventy-point turn in an attempt to get out of the exit again. Amanda coos over the colour of the awful car, nose pressed almost to the glass, and Phil gently teases her for being a stereotype.<b><br /></b></p><p>She rolls her eyes and swats him in the shoulder. &ldquo;Girls are allowed to like pink.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughs and pokes her in the side, making her smile. Dan watches the fond exchange in the rearview mirror, lips pressed together. Eventually, he finds a parking space, though it&rsquo;s a tight squeeze between the hundreds of cars that have shown up here tonight. He switches off the engine, blank eyes staring out of the windscreen at the building in front of him. They&rsquo;re about half an hour late, so the parking lot is pretty much deserted &ndash; everyone is already inside. The back door of the car opens, and Amanda begins climbing out, complaining and laughing at once about how difficult it is to elegantly clamber out of a car in a big dress and heels. Dan&rsquo;s fingertips tingle. He&rsquo;s already mentally projecting to the next available smoking opportunity.</p><p>Phil leans forwards then, his chin resting on the back of Dan&rsquo;s seat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna come in, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan is silent for a moment. &ldquo;Actually, I was thinking I might wait out here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please come in,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to Prom without my best friend.&rdquo;</p><p>Venom sears Dan&rsquo;s throat, he swallows it down but it stings. &ldquo;Is that what we are?&rdquo;</p><p>Their eyes meet in the mirror, and Phil looks desperate, as though he&rsquo;s begging Dan not to push it. Luckily for him, Amanda knocks on the glass of the back window, making a face that says &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the hold up?&rsquo;.</p><p>Phil gives him one last pleading look, and Dan&rsquo;s resolve breaks. Reluctantly, he sighs, and unplugs his seatbelt.</p><p>Prom is everything Dan expected, and worse. The hall is crammed with his peers, each of them decked out in a taffeta frock, or a cheap rented suit &ndash; with the exception of the Elites, of course, all of whom wear tight designer dresses, or tailored tuxedos.</p><p>The Elites have commandeered a table near the back, and are lounging around it holding plastic stem glasses of what appears to be punch, but Dan suspects is not. There&rsquo;s a stage in the hall, on which a marginally terrible band is playing a mashup of chart hits, the majority of which Dan only knows because Louise forces him to have Radio One playing in the caf&eacute; at all hours.</p><p>There are paper chains, and a glitterball, and cr&ecirc;pe-papered tables holding punch bowls and bowls of crisps. It&rsquo;s the kind of Prom that Dan has seen in a dozen American high school movies, which isn&rsquo;t that surprising, as the Prom-planning committee&rsquo;s inspiration was <i>Pretty In Pink</i>.</p><p>Everyone&rsquo;s attention is stolen by the entrance of Phil with Amanda Jones on his arm. Hardy, over at the Elite table, glares across the room at them, sour-faced. He&rsquo;s wearing a white tuxedo, as if he could get any more douchey, and seems to have brought a different Elite girl as his date, though he doesn&rsquo;t appear to be paying too much attention to her.</p><p>Dan can&rsquo;t imagine that Amanda would be welcomed if she tried to go over to her usual possy, but she doesn&rsquo;t so much as look their direction. Phil, looking slightly uncomfortable under the scrutiny of near everyone in the room, leads Amanda through the crowd towards the punch table. Dan follows solemnly behind them; distracted as they are by the scandalous date of the century, nobody pays him any attention at all.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;This punch tastes like ass,&rdquo; Dan says, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, they made me use Diet lemonade,&rdquo; Lee says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gross.&rdquo;</p><p>If Dan asked Lee why he&rsquo;d chosen to volunteer at the Sixth Form Prom, doling out ladlefuls of disgusting punch to a load of teenagers that are sneaking vodka into it anyway, he&rsquo;d probably say that he had nothing better to do with his Friday night, or that he came to watch everyone be &lsquo;tragic&rsquo;. In reality, he is almost definitely here to hang around Dan. In another timeline, Dan might find this annoying, but tonight he&rsquo;s glad of the company.</p><p>The punch table is on the periphery of the dancefloor; in the centre, a few brave couples have already started vaguely swaying together to the cacophony of noise the band is making. One of those couples are Phil and Amanda.</p><p>Dan would have put good money on the fact that Phil cannot dance, and he&rsquo;d have won the bet. Phil is tall, and clumsy, with two left feet and a tendency to not know where to place his hands. Amanda seems to find this utter incompetence on his part incredibly endearing, and keeps laughing every time Phil steps on her pointed shoes.</p><p>The moment they began, she picked up Phil&rsquo;s hands and placed them straight on her hips, then slung hers around his neck, just as Dan said she would. They&rsquo;re awkward, and due to their height difference the movements are far from graceful, but they&rsquo;re having fun, apparently, if their laughter is anything to go by.</p><p>&ldquo;Got a cold?&rdquo; Lee asks, handing Dan a napkin.</p><p>Dan sniffs for the hundredth time, shrugging, and takes it from him. &ldquo;Can we get out of here? Go for a smoke or something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got something even better,&rdquo; Lee says with a grin.</p><p>He reaches discreetly into the pocket of his sweatpants, and exposes the tip of a flask. He tucks it away quickly before any of the patrolling teachers notice.</p><p>&ldquo;You make yourself useful, I&rsquo;ll give you that,&rdquo; Dan says, then inclines his head, and starts to make his way over to the hall doors.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Geez, that&rsquo;s a bit full on,&rdquo; Lee says, staring into Amanda&rsquo;s painted face. The canvas is bigger than Dan remembers it being. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he planning on doing with it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gonna gift it to her, apparently,&rdquo; Dan replies.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s already taken the flask from Lee, and is sipping it quietly, perched up on a desk. Phil&rsquo;s left a few paintbrushes and dried up palettes scattered about the place, but the usual vibrancy he brings to the art studio is missing. Now, the room seems bereft, dark.</p><p>&ldquo;Weird,&rdquo; Lee says, leaning close to peer into Amanda&rsquo;s vacant brown eyes.</p><p>Dan takes another sip of what tastes vaguely like whiskey, but is probably more likely to be a mixture of a few spirits Lee swiped from his parents&rsquo; liquor cabinet in order to avoid being caught.</p><p>&ldquo;I want a cigarette. Let&rsquo;s sit behind here,&rdquo; Dan says, walking around to the back of a big stack of blank canvases, propped against a desk. In the tight space behind them, he and Lee will be impossible to see from the door if a teacher comes snooping. Lee follows him obediently, squatting down in the small nook. Dan offers him the flask while he digs around for his pack of cigarettes, but Lee refuses.</p><p>&ldquo;You look like you need it more, mate.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan wants to call him out on this statement, argue and demand he explain himself, but he thinks better of it. So what if his misery is written all over his face? Lee is too up his ass to do anything with the information that Dan might be crushing on Phil, if he has indeed picked up on it. Dan puts the flask between his knees and pulls two cigarettes out of his rapidly depleting pack of Djarums.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Dan says, not giving Lee a chance to refuse. He hands one of the cigarettes over, and pulls out a lighter. The first drag is glorious. A thick rush of nicotine sluices through Dan from head to fingertips. Lee lights his up after a moment, too, then promptly splutters, grimacing.</p><p>He puts it straight out again. &ldquo;Eugh, what the fuck&rsquo;s that? All perfumey.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan snorts with laughter, about to explain that they&rsquo;re flavoured, but right then, voices permeate the quiet air, right outside the door. Dan looks forlornly at his cigarette, which he&rsquo;s only just begun. He takes another deep drag, then one more, breathing it out in a long rush just as the door opens. Then he stubs it out on the tiled floor.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;you think you could do a better job of it?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s heart plummets straight through his ribcage, landing on the floor with a pathetic &lsquo;plop&rsquo;. He imagines he can see it pulsating weakly on the tile beside his the ashes of his cigarette. It&rsquo;s Amanda&rsquo;s voice. Which means&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, maybe that&rsquo;s my calling,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I could be the next big thing in the cover band world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do agree that you couldn&rsquo;t be any worse than that lot,&rdquo; Amanda agrees. &ldquo;But I guess we can&rsquo;t be too critical- what the&hellip; oh my God.&rdquo;</p><p>Her voice falls away, leaving only the stagnant silence of this room in its wake. A few seconds pass, and then there&rsquo;s the sound of her kitten heels tritting slowly across the floor. She&rsquo;s approaching the canvas, on the other side of where Dan and Lee hide. The door closes, and Dan hears Phil moving cautiously further into the studio. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to capture you,&rdquo; Phil says; Dan can <i>feel</i> the nerves in his best friend&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I wanted to do something big, but there&rsquo;s so much about you I didn&rsquo;t manage to get right-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; Amanda interrupts. Her voice is choked. Dan swallows down a gulp of tobacco flavoured saliva. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this. You painted this? By hand?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;For you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Amanda says; yep, she&rsquo;s definitely choking back tears. Desperate to escape, Dan looks around himself for a possible exit, but without Amanda and Phil seeing him, there&rsquo;s no choice but to just sit here and listen. He brings his knuckles up to bite at them. &ldquo;Why would you do this for me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; Phil says, and <i>oh God</i>, Dan had almost forgotten. </p><p>Eyes smarting, Dan hears the rustle of Phil digging around in his suit pocket. Phil steps forward, closing the gap between he and the girl of his dreams. A moment passes, and then she gasps. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God, Phil I can&rsquo;t&hellip; you shouldn&rsquo;t have-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just let me explain,&rdquo; Phil says. Amanda stays quiet. &ldquo;I know you spend every day wishing you were born differently, watching your friends glide through life with ease just because they have money. I know it makes you feel inferior to them. It shouldn&rsquo;t, because you&rsquo;re perfect. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to paint you, to show you that to me, at least, you&rsquo;re flawless.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shifts quietly. The floor is hardening beneath him, making it impossible to stay still. He catches Lee watching him, fingers covering his mouth in an attempt to stay quiet. <i>It doesn&rsquo;t matter</i>, he wants to shout at Lee, <i>they&rsquo;d never notice us. Even if we screamed</i>. </p><p>Dan wants to put his fingers in his ears to block it out, but Lee might ask him why later, and Dan can&rsquo;t handle it. So he just grits his teeth and tells himself it won&rsquo;t last forever, and that later he can deal with the pain. He remembers, belatedly, the flask laying in his lap, so unscrews the cap and pours a great deal of whatever is inside into his mouth. It tastes disgusting, but then he has another swig, and it goes down a little easier. </p><p>&ldquo;I bought you these because you deserve them,&rdquo; Phil tells Amanda then, and Dan knows he must be handing her the earrings. Those beautiful black pearls on silver stems. &ldquo;I want you to feel like you ought to feel. I want you to feel as precious as I see you every day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much,&rdquo; Amanda says, weakly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t accept them.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Please take them,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I want to show you what you&rsquo;re worth.&rdquo; </p><p>A quiet falls, and all Dan can hear is vague rustling. Lee is staring at him now, his eyes feel like they&rsquo;re boring into his skull. It might be something to do with the tear that&rsquo;s just fallen down Dan&rsquo;s cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;How do they look?&rdquo; Amanda says after a while. </p><p>To Dan&rsquo;s surprise, Phil doesn&rsquo;t respond straight away. Dan kind of wants to peer his head over the canvases and see for himself. Maybe they really do look hideous on her; Dan had always thought they weren&rsquo;t really her usual style. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil says then, though his voice is not at all convincing. &ldquo;Really nice.&rdquo; </p><p><i>Tip-tap </i>go&nbsp;Amanda&rsquo;s shoes as she closes the distance between them. Dan can&rsquo;t help it, he shifts again, bum numbed by the horrible hard tile. As he moves, he realises there&rsquo;s a slit between two canvases, allowing him just enough space to see through if he leans awkwardly. In the tiny gap, he watches, heart tearing itself down the middle, as Amanda&rsquo;s hand rests on Phil&rsquo;s chin, and she tiptoes up to press a kiss to his lips. </p><p>At this point, the tears are too insistent to try and hold back. Lee can think what he wants. Dan sips more of the flask, and sinks back to his former position, hating himself for torturing his own heart this way. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you smell cherry?&rdquo; Amanda asks then, and Dan freezes. He turns to Lee, wide-eyed. </p><p>Like they&rsquo;re connected, Dan can feel it in his chest as the realisation floods over Phil. He hears the guilt in his silence, and aches from it. Phil will sweep his gaze over the room, will note the strange wall of canvases and know at once what they hide. He will know, <i>of course he will know</i>, and now he will pretend he doesn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; Phil says, just like Dan knew he would. There&rsquo;s a slit in his voice, like it&rsquo;s about to crack, to splinter into bits. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t smell anything. Come on, let&rsquo;s go back to the dance.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Lee says for maybe the fifth time. &ldquo;Dan, are you alright?&rdquo; </p><p>The jumble of art supplies in front of Dan seems to be moving. The supplies swirl about randomly, paint brushes blending into charcoals, oil pastels bleeding into one another, creating a brown sludge. </p><p>&ldquo; &lsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Dan gets out. He tries to drain the last of the flask, but finds that it&rsquo;s somehow already empty. He turns to Lee, eyes blurred from the film of moisture gathered in his ducts. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he slurs, pushing the empty flask at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sober, right?&rdquo; </p><p>Warily, Lee nods. </p><p>Dan digs in his trouser pocket for Ricky&rsquo;s car keys. &ldquo;I need a favour.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>The bright lights and jarring, staticky noise coming from the ancient speakers is a lot worse now that Dan&rsquo;s mind is thickened with alcohol. He pushes through seemingly hoards of people, some of whom grunt and shout things at him, indignant. These people, his classmates, seem alien to him, their faces unrecognisable, distorted and strange. </p><p>He&rsquo;s trying to find the exit, but ends up at the back of the room somehow, with all the tables. Amanda and Phil are sat at one, just the two of them, sharing a glass of punch, their cheeks rosy with happiness. Amanda&rsquo;s earlobes are glistening with two black pearls. </p><p>Just as a wash of bile crawls up Dan&rsquo;s throat, something happens. It shatters the warping, undulating bubble of Dan&rsquo;s drunken state, and everything clatters into clarity just as Hardy Jenns&rsquo; fist slams down in front of Phil, shaking the table. Phil leaps to his feet, stricken, and Hardy starts to yell. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;showing up here with my girl on your arm! Who the fuck d&rsquo;you think you are, you little shitbox, I&rsquo;m gonna punch your lights out!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan watches in alarm, a tiny <i>&lsquo;no&rsquo;</i> slipping from his lips. He surges forwards, straight through a gaggle of girls on the periphery of the dance floor, and lunges. Hardy&rsquo;s fist draws back, his teeth bared into a snarl as he pulls his weight into the incoming punch. He swings, fast, but Dan is faster. Phil falls to the floor with how hard Dan barrels into him, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because Hardy&rsquo;s fist misses him by centimetres, and connects with the bone of Dan&rsquo;s right cheek instead. It makes a dull &lsquo;thwack&rsquo;, and Dan is thrown backwards by the force of it. </p><p>The alcohol numbs the pain, but it throbs unbearably even so. He straightens up, clutching his face and swearing loudly. Phil, on the floor still, has his mouth open in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, for fuck&rsquo;s sake, not you again,&rdquo; Hardy growls. There&rsquo;s a slur to his voice too; Dan clearly isn&rsquo;t the only one imbibing this evening.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thought I told you to tell your boyfriend to leave my girl alone!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan jabs a finger at Hardy, breathing hard through the pain.&nbsp;&ldquo;Get away from him, Hardy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The corner of Hardy&rsquo;s mouth curls into a nasty sneer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>For a moment, Dan just glares at him. He notices Phil struggling to sit up in the periphery of his vision, and is momentarily distracted. He turns, noting the terror on Phil&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, just leave it,&rdquo; Phil garbles, urgently.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything stupid, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, whore,&rdquo; Hardy says, drawing Dan&rsquo;s attention again. He&rsquo;s still got that smug, shit-eating smirk on his face. Dan&rsquo;s fist begins to curl. Oh, he&rsquo;s been aching for a release, and this is all too perfectly set up to resist.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you leave it? Go back to whatever back room you crawled out of, wait for the next John to pull down his fly for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil says, from somewhere seemingly far away.&nbsp;&ldquo;Dan, ignore him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Drunkenly, Dan turns to Phil for a split second. He shoots him a stupid grin, allowing the rush of white heat and anger to flood him, and then lunges forwards, his own fist connecting with Hardy&rsquo;s jaw.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; Phil calls out. The concern in his voice is blissful. It slips into Dan&rsquo;s bloodstream, giving him the energy to land a second punch on Hardy&rsquo;s stupid forehead. This time, it knocks him backwards, and he crashes onto the table behind him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, stop!&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s voice is shrill.</p><p>&ldquo;Get the fuck off me you little cunt,&rdquo; Hardy shouts, as Dan grabs him by the lapels&nbsp;of his idiotic white suit, slamming him down against the table he&rsquo;s sprawled on, so the back of his skull thunks against it. Amanda is still sitting down, watching with wide-eyes; Dan doesn&rsquo;t spare her a glance. He&rsquo;s seething, livid, and Hardy&rsquo;s stupid, ignorant face suddenly represents every reason why.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan knows he doesn&rsquo;t look like he could lift a fruitfly, but he&rsquo;s had to toughen up, living where he does. He&rsquo;s stronger than anyone he knows his age, which people don&rsquo;t expect. By the look on Hardy&rsquo;s face, he&rsquo;s no exception. Dan slaps Hardy sharp across the cheek, hard enough to leave a red mark come morning. They&rsquo;ve gathered a crowd now, so it won&rsquo;t be long until a teacher notices and comes over to break them up. So, Dan brings his face close to Hardy&rsquo;s, close enough that the dickhead should be able to smell the nicotine on his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Amanda is not your girl,&rdquo; Dan hisses. &ldquo;She can do whatever she wants. And mercifully, that&rsquo;s not you anymore.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Get off me!&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something urgent and worried in Hardy&rsquo;s tone. Dan&rsquo;s half on top of him now, and it seems to be making Hardy even more furious. Dan&rsquo;s having to exert a lot of energy just pinning him here.&nbsp;&ldquo;Get the fuck off me you fag fuck!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>And then, it all becomes painfully clear.&nbsp;</p><p>The anger recedes a little as Dan&rsquo;s knee comes into contact with a rather obvious bulge. His eyebrows lift, and Hardy&rsquo;s terror is palpable. Dan sends him a little&nbsp;&lsquo;gotcha&rsquo; smile.&nbsp;</p><p>He leans forwards, feeling Hardy go limp, sensing the defeat.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you and I will be having a problem anymore, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>Hardy doesn&rsquo;t respond at first, so Dan pushes his knee sharply into Hardy&rsquo;s crotch, and he shakes his head quickly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please move,&rdquo; Hardy begs.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll back off, I swear. Just don&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Swear to me you&rsquo;ll leave him alone,&rdquo; Dan says, knee still jammed up against Hardy&rsquo;s erection.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I swear, fuck.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And Amanda.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine, fine,&rdquo; Hardy says hurriedly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you tell your Dad, and get me fired,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I will tell everyone about what I felt here tonight.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Hardy nods inn understanding, cheeks aflame.&nbsp;Dan releases him then, and wipes his hands on his shirt in disgust. Hardy doesn&rsquo;t move for a minute. There&rsquo;s a wide, stunned look in his eyes, as though he&rsquo;s not sure of his next move. He casts a quick, frightened gaze around the room, meeting the eyes of every onlooker, and then jumps up, fleeing to the hall doors.</p><p>Bizarrely, just as Dan turns to go, it&rsquo;s Amanda&rsquo;s gaze that he catches. She&rsquo;s staring at him wonderingly, calmly, despite having seen him beat up and threaten her ex moments ago. In her right thumb and forefinger, she twiddles one of her earrings. Dan turns from her then, nauseated, eye and cheek throbbing, and pushes back into the crowd. He can see the glowing exit sign now, and the crowds seem all too happy to part as he moves towards it. He doesn&rsquo;t care about these people anymore, nor did he ever. So they&rsquo;ve finally seen just what happens when somebody pisses off the scary emo kid just a little too much. Let them be scared of him. Maybe it&rsquo;ll make them leave him alone. </p><p>He&rsquo;s almost at the door, almost free from this horrendous night, when something catches his arm. When Dan turns to see who is stopping him, he has to stop himself from throwing more punches. </p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Phil asks; his eyes are red. Dan tastes blood. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan licks the corner of his mouth. His lip ring is missing, and there&rsquo;s blood pooled there. It must have ripped out during the fight. He wipes the blood with the back of his hand, hardly caring. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; home,&rdquo; Dan says, dejected. The alcohol in his system has swooped back into play, and he feels drunk again, the adrenaline of the pain and violence gone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given Lee th&rsquo;keys t&rsquo;Ricky&rsquo;s car. He agreed to drive you and Amanda back.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Phil begs him. He seems desperate, and Dan cannot fathom why. &ldquo;Please, just stay for a while, we can talk, I can get you some ice-&rdquo;</p><p>Dan pulls free of Phil&rsquo;s grip, annoyed. &ldquo;If y&rsquo;wanted t&rsquo;talk t&rsquo;me, y&rsquo;could&rsquo;ve this morning. Now&rsquo;m tired, and drunk, and&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you let Hardy punch you?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s blue eyes are deep and watery. Dan could throw anchors into them, made of longing, and hurt, and misery, but they&rsquo;d never reach the bottoms - they&rsquo;re too deep. &ldquo;Why did you push me out of the way?&rdquo; </p><p>The question, to Dan, is absurd. &ldquo;B&rsquo;cause he was going to hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Dan whispers. He tastes blood again. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let anyone hurt you. You&rsquo;re the only thing that matters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You matter,&rdquo; Phil whispers back. &ldquo;You matter to me.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan snorts in derision, not bothering to reply. Instead, he turns away, and pushes through the fire exit, out into the cold night beyond</p><p>*</p><p>The vodka in Dan&rsquo;s blood is making the dense, humid air shimmer. He&rsquo;s wrapped in someone&rsquo;s arms, grinding on someone&rsquo;s thigh. There&rsquo;s a sultry, pulsating beat all around him. He thinks maybe, before, there was a finger in his mouth, a small blue pill pressed onto his tongue. Dark grey eyes are locked on his, and as they move to the music, Dan can feel warmth, sweat, hands on his hips. </p><p>He wishes he were in bed, not here, with the covers pulled over him, and a pillow to softly soak up the tears. But going home would mean facing Ricky, and perhaps getting another punch thrown at him for kicks. Dan doesn&rsquo;t even have his brother&rsquo;s car anymore. Facing Ricky&rsquo;s wrath without it would be suicidal. The right side of his face throbs and aches. It&rsquo;s bruised badly, Dan saw it in Ozone&rsquo;s cracked bathroom mirror. His eye is swollen, making it hard to see. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it gonna cost me to take you home?&rdquo; A rough, gravelly voice says into Dan&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a little surprising Dan is able to pull anyone in the state he&rsquo;s in. Damaged goods are apparently not a dealbreaker for the dudes in here. A rush of something blissful and heady threads itself through Dan&rsquo;s body, making him wonder what exactly it was that he swallowed half an hour ago, compressed into that tiny pill. He welcomes the rush of pleasure even so, closing his aching eyes as he allows the drug to sweep away the pain. </p><p>He leans forwards, lips to the guy&rsquo;s ear, and says: &ldquo;What&rsquo;ve you got?&rdquo; </p><p>(<b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/179356571622/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Nine</a>!)</b></p>",

Phil seems to find Dan&rsquo;s perpetual attitude funny, and despite Dan&rsquo;s best efforts to shun him and everyone else, wants to be around him all the time. That is, until Phil starts talking about Amanda Jones.<br /></i><b>Word Count:</b> WIP (Estimated 12-15 chapters) updates every Tuesday<br /><b>Rating:</b> Explicit<br /><b>Warnings:</b> Smoking, swearing, implied prostitution, broken home, class divide/classism, pining, light homophobia, sex <br /><br /></p>\n<p><b>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/177738852529/some-kind-of-folliful-new-fic\">Chapter One</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/177982263491/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Two</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178227297225/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Three</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178454752236/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Four</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178671704545/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Five</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178676195090/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Six</a>]<br />[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178893484577/edgelorddan-x-obliviousbisexualphil-au-chapter\">Chapter Seven</a>]</b></p>\n<p><b>[<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15894954%2Fchapters%2F37042212&amp;t=YWVmOTliMzc0MTkyZDFjZTFkMzVmMzM4NmFlOGJjZDJmODI1Njk5YixVNUVvdGxGag%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AA-PgA5Z7k9tbi8i-ePCy7Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffeels-forever.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F177763348310%2Fsome-kind-of-folliful-new-fic&amp;m=1\">Ao3</a>!]</b></p>\n<p>The school parking lot is rammed with limousines and Rolls Royce&rsquo;s. Dan idles the car in a queue for about ten minutes waiting for one particularly obnoxious pink limo to do a seventy-point turn in an attempt to get out of the exit again. Amanda coos over the colour of the awful car, nose pressed almost to the glass, and Phil gently teases her for being a stereotype.<b><br /></b></p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes and swats him in the shoulder. &ldquo;Girls are allowed to like pink.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Phil laughs and pokes her in the side, making her smile. Dan watches the fond exchange in the rearview mirror, lips pressed together. Eventually, he finds a parking space, though it&rsquo;s a tight squeeze between the hundreds of cars that have shown up here tonight. He switches off the engine, blank eyes staring out of the windscreen at the building in front of him. They&rsquo;re about half an hour late, so the parking lot is pretty much deserted &ndash; everyone is already inside. The back door of the car opens, and Amanda begins climbing out, complaining and laughing at once about how difficult it is to elegantly clamber out of a car in a big dress and heels. Dan&rsquo;s fingertips tingle. He&rsquo;s already mentally projecting to the next available smoking opportunity.</p>\n<p>Phil leans forwards then, his chin resting on the back of Dan&rsquo;s seat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna come in, right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dan is silent for a moment. &ldquo;Actually, I was thinking I might wait out here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Please come in,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to Prom without my best friend.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Venom sears Dan&rsquo;s throat, he swallows it down but it stings. &ldquo;Is that what we are?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Their eyes meet in the mirror, and Phil looks desperate, as though he&rsquo;s begging Dan not to push it. Luckily for him, Amanda knocks on the glass of the back window, making a face that says &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the hold up?&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Phil gives him one last pleading look, and Dan&rsquo;s resolve breaks. Reluctantly, he sighs, and unplugs his seatbelt.</p>\n</p>",
