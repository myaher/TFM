Enjoy! <b>\ud83d\udc95</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><!-- more --><hr><p><br/></p><p>The\nthought of the Avengers being a threat to the world was hammered into\nyour head since the day you were born. July 4<sup>th</sup>,\nironically, did you open your eyes for the first time, and it wasn\u2019t\neven strange for you that you had the body of a seventeen years old,\nwhile only being alive for a few minutes.</p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t strange that you had to learn the most most basic like\nreading and writing, all while already being able to use every weapon\navailable, lifting tons of weight without breaking a sweat, and when\nyou were one week old, you had outmatched the best fighter in\nhand-to-hand combat HYDRA could find.</p><p>Though,\nlike every time HYDRA seemed to make one step closer to their\nultimate goal \u2013 to conquer the world \u2013 the Avengers were right\nbehind them.</p><p>And\nwith them were Steven Grant Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>When\nyou were looking at Steven Grant Rogers, it was a bit like looking\ninto a mirror. Although you didn\u2019t look exactly the same as him,\nthere was a striking resemblance.</p><p>You\nslightly leaned to the side, catching a glance at the figure standing\nin the doorway. The metal arm was anything you needed to see to know\nthat this was indeed the Winter Soldier. Slowly, you leaned back,\nstaring once again into the perfect baby blues of Captain America.</p><p>\u201cYou\nkicked in my door.\u201d</p><p>For\na short moment, Steve looked at a loss of words, lips parted in\nconfusion. Bucky laughed, trying to cover it up as he cleared his\nthroat, giving a little cough.</p><p>\u201cI,\nuh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>HYDRA\ndidn\u2019t set great values on moral and right social behaviors. All\nyou had learned were the things you had read in books one of the nice\nscientists had given to you. You blinked.</p><p>\u201cI\nguess it is fine, then.\u201d You finally closed the book you had been\nreading before you had unexpected visitors. Then you rose from the\nsitting position on your bed, now towering over Steve, who had been\ncrouching in front of you to be on your height. Gracefully, you\nside-stepped him, sauntering over to the only cabinet in the room to\nput back your book.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou know who we are? Why we are here?\u201d</p><p>This\nwas Bucky talking. You hummed before answering his question, starting\nto gather other books in your arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\nare the Avengers. Well, part of them; Captain America and former\nHYDRA assassin the Winter Soldier. Highest threat level.\u201d</p><p>You\nstood up, walking right in front of the Winter Soldier, this time\npeering over his shoulder. A few bodies were lying in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI\nam not dumb. This HYDRA base has surely fallen. The question is, are\nyou gonna kill me like you did the other agents, or are you gonna\ncapture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nnot going to kill you,\u201d said Steve. You looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nthe latter then.\u201d Dropping your head, you intently studied the\ncover of the book lying on top. \u201cDo you think I can bring these?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>As\nit turned out, there was so much you didn\u2019t know about the world.</p><p>First\nof all, you could bring your books. That was nice. Just as nice as\nthe room you got at the Avengers Compound, apparently the place you\nwere going to live for now on.</p><p>Secondly,\nyou were never registered as \u2026 well, as a person living on this\nworld, so you couldn\u2019t be charged guilty for the things <strike>you\ndid</strike> HYDRA\nmade you do.</p><p>Thirdly,\nother kids had parents,\nand they are responsible for them until they are of age, meaning\neighteen years old. Technically,\nyou were four years old, a toddler, you had learned. You\nweren\u2019t supposed to be as\ntall as Thor and have arm\nwrestling matches with the Winter Soldier you were able to win.</p><p>According\nto the law, you were to be assigned a guardian, and your medical\nexamination when you first had set foot\nonto the Avengers Compound, which included a DNA\ntest, brought\nsurprising results.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nhe\u2019s my father then?\u201d</p><p>Dr.\nBanner, <i>Bruce,</i> as he insisted\nyou to call him (he didn\u2019t like Hulky very much), shook\nhis head, still looking at the hologram showing the results.</p><p>\u201cI\nam not sure how to call it, to be honest. Based on the file the\nothers found in the base, your embryo grew in vitro,\nthen they continued the growth in some kind of chamber, similar to\nthe cryo\nchambers, until\nthey seemed you fit to be \u2026 born, I guess.</p><p>\u201cThe\npoint is, you weren\u2019t born in the way it normally happens, and I\ndon\u2019t think you have to see him as a father. HYDRA just borrowed\nsome of his DNA. The parts effected by the super soldier serum, to be\nexact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrothers?\u201d</p><p>Bruce\nnodded, a bit distracted as he wasn\u2019t able to look away from your\ntest results. \u201cMaybe more like that, I don\u2019t know. More\nimportant, though, is that you don\u2019t have to see him as anything.\nYou don\u2019t even have to talk to him if you do not want to. It\u2019s\nall up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>Now,\nBruce finally looked at you, giving you a shy smile. \u201cI understand\nif you\u2019re a bit overwhelmed of the whole situation, but everything\nwill settle in a few days or weeks time. Don\u2019t worry. If you need\nhelp you can come to any of us, or ask F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d</p><p>You\ntried to return his smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\ngonna find back to your room on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThough, it was more like an entire apartment than a simple room.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course.\nDinner is at half past eight. If you want to join us. Today\u2019s one\nof the few days were everyone can attend, but you don\u2019t have to\nfeel obligated to show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>It\nhad just turned eight o\u2019clock, and you picked up the remote to\npress the necessary button to have Netflix go to the next episode of\nBrooklyn 99 without having to wait five seconds. Your hand dropped\nback to your side, landing on the <i>incredible</i> soft blanket you\nhad thrown over your legs, tucking the end under your feet.</p><p>The\nblanket was really soft, like, <i>really</i> soft. You had asked\nF.R.I.D.A.Y., who said it was something called cashmere. Once again,\nyou lifted the corner of it to your face, letting it glide over your\ncheek to relish in its softness.</p><p>A\nsmall chuckle escaped you as you watched Boyle pouring hot coffee all\nover himself and under his bandages, your hands lowering back down so\nyou could keep gliding your finger tips over the fabric.</p><p>However,\nwhen Steve entered your <strike>room</strike> apartment, two plates\nfilled with food in his hands, he found the couch empty, the blanket\ndiscarded over the back of it, while the TV still played your show.</p><p>Steve\nset down the plates on the coffee table. \u201cY/N?\u201d he called out,\nturning to look over the apartment. Only after a few seconds did you\nstep out of the corner you were hiding in, shooting Steve an\nindefinable look.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d\nSteve said. \u201cI, uh, I took the liberty of having F.R.I.D.A.Y. open\nthe door for me.\u201d</p><p>You\nstared at him, eyes flickering to the plates on the coffee table and\nthe steam rising from the hot food. \u201cYou could have just let her\nask me to open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\nyes, I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nstartled me, and I panicked a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\nI am sorry, I just \u2026 wanted to eat dinner with you. And maybe talk\na bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d\nyou said, \u201cokay. I am not really hungry, though.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nsmiled. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>You\nnodded, sitting back down on the couch next to your blanket, and\naccepted the plate Steve offered you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthis?\u201d you asked, digging your fork into \u2026 you didn\u2019t know what\nit was. It crushed under the force, revealing a filling of what you\nassumed were vegetables.</p><p>\u201cSpring\nrolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d\nyou said, still having no clue what Steve brought you.</p><p>He\nonly chuckled. \u201cJust try it. They\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\nyou say so.\u201d You lifted the fork to your mouth, sniffing at the\nfood first before trying it. The pastry crunched in your mouth, the\nvegetables were soft.</p><p>Steve\nlooked at you expectantly. You tried a small smile and nodded. \u201cIt\ntastes good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d\nhe said, picking up his own meal. It was silent for a short time,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had been so polite to pause the current episode, and you\nwatched Steve while munching on your spring rolls.</p><p>\u201cIs\nthis about your DNA?\u201d</p><p>Steve\nchoked a bit on his food, face turning red as he coughed. \u201cI-\nwhat?\u201d</p><p>You\ncould hear his heart thumping even faster in his chest than before,\nand the blush didn\u2019t subside.</p><p>\u201cI\nasked if this is about your DNA. Bruce surely must have told you that\nHYDRA used your DNA to create me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\n\u2026\u201d Steve looked to the side and set his plate down. \u201cYes, it\nmay be. Bruce- I- yes, Bruce told me about it. He also told me that \u2026\nthat you asked if I would be your father now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFathers\nand sons share the same DNA. But Bruce also said that brothers share\nthe same DNA. However it is up to me how I see you.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nnodded. The red color on his skin had faded a bit. \u201cOf course.\nNobody\u2019s going to tell you what to do. You see, when I woke up in\nthis century, I knew nothing about this world. Everything had changed\nand I would have been lost without the team.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow that you have been alive for only a few years to begin with <i>and</i>\nlived in isolation. I just wanted you to know that you have me if you\nneed help, <i>like</i> a brother. If you want.\u201d</p><p>You\nwatched Steve, eyes straight on staring into his (which didn\u2019t\ntotally unnerved him). \u201cSo, like a big brother helping his little\nbrother. I saw about this in some show.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nchuckled. \u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\nbig bro, wanna watch some Brooklyn 99 while eating spring rolls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nhe laughed, picking up his own food to continue eating. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nBrooklyn 99?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\nwatch it,\u201d you said, mimicking Steve\u2019s words from earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s\ngood.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/>When\nyou befriend Steve Rogers, you automatically have to befriend Bucky\nBarnes \u2013 or have to put up with him even if you don\u2019t like him.\nFortunately, it was the former for you (unlike Sam; though you\nweren\u2019t sure if Sam really hated Bucky or the other way around;\nthey were bantering, like siblings, you had thought).</p><p>You\nknew that Bucky had been with HYDRA for a long time, not voluntarily.\nHowever, you always had thought you were kind of connected. You liked\nit when Bucky was around. He didn\u2019t say much, but he was a calming\npresence, making everything \u2013 adjusting, and learning, and\ninteracting with other people - seem easier. You had talked a few\ntimes with him about HYDRA, about his time there, even though Bucky\u2019s\nexperience was much different, with the whole being tortured and\ntaken apart and remade.</p><p>Nevertheless,\nit was good to talk with someone about HYDRA and your own\nexperiences. Steve was always there for you, of course, but after a\nfew months you realized that every person on the team had a few\ntopics you could talk to them about and a few topics you rather not\ntalk to them about.</p><p>And\nsometimes you liked to imagine that Bucky might like talking to you,\ntoo.<br/><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>It\nonly took Bucky a few seconds to open his door, revealing you with\nyour blanket in your hands.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nBucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\nY/N,\u201d Bucky greeted back. \u201cSteve ain\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI know, he\u2019s in the gym. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\nDid somethin\u2019 happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\nOh, no. Just wanted some company.\u201d You stopped in your tracks,\nlooking back at Bucky while he was closing the door. \u201cAm I\nintrusive? Bruce said it is fine to seek company of the people you\nlike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Bucky chuckled a bit, following you into the\nliving room area. \u201cYou always carry that blanket with ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\nIt\u2019s soft.\u201d You sat and patted the space on the couch next to\nyou, telling Bucky to sit down with you. Without another word, you\npicked up the blanket and arranged it that both you and Bucky were\nwrapped in its fluffiness.\u201dDidn\u2019t had much soft things while\nbeing with HYDRA.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nwiggled a bit in his place, getting comfortable as he settled in,\nyour shoulders touching. \u201cYeah, know whatcha mean. When I came here\nfirst, everything was bright and soft and nice. Didn\u2019t think I\ndeserved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause\nof the things HYDRA made you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nI just didn\u2019t think of it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\ndeserve nice things. That\u2019s what Steve always says, but I am not so\nsure about that.\u201d You turned your head, looking at Bucky.\n\u201cInteracting with people is hard,\u201d you said, studying Bucky\u2019s\ncalm eyes. \u201cKnowing how they feel and acting appropriately is\nhard.\u201d Gaze lowering down on your hands, you began petting the\nblanket.</p><p>\u201c\u2019S\nalright,\u201d Bucky said, \u201cit really is hard sometimes.\u201d</p><p>You\nnodded, contemplating if you should tell Bucky that it never was hard\nwith him, and that you liked it, but then decided against it.</p><p>Bucky\nsmiled, just as soft as the blanket, and it made you feel warm over \u2013\nit was confusing. But you smiled back, even laughing when he bumped\nhis shoulder with yours. But you sobered up quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow that- I know HYDRA made me because they wanted another weapon\nlike you. I was trained, and trained, and trained every day, and even\nthough I rarely got tired, I <i>am</i> tired of it. You know what I\nmean?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nnodded, letting you talk.</p><p>\u201cI\nkept up the routine because I didn\u2019t know what else to do, but I\ndecided to just \u2026 stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nokay.\u201d</p><p>You\nhummed, sinking further into the cushions. Everything was okay,\nalways okay. There were still so much thinks making life not okay at\nthe moment, but \u2013 unsurprisingly by now, you thought \u2013 with Bucky\nthis fact didn\u2019t seem so important anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\nthink I need a nap.\u201d You sighed.</p><p>\u201cLay\ndown, doll,\u201d Bucky said, grabbing the blanket and the pillow to put\nit in his lap. After you laid down, he threw the blanket over your\nform, letting you snuggle into it.</p><p>Being\nwith Bucky was easy.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>It\nwas in times like these where you felt lonely.</p><p>After\nlearning the concept of two people being more than friends, <i>loving\neach other,</i> you also learned the concept of feeling lonely.</p><p>You\nshould really stop watching these films, and movies, and reading\nbooks. Love stories weren\u2019t good. It made you crave things.\nCloseness, <i>proximity,</i> human touch, hugs, <i>kisses, Bu-</i></p><p>Your\neyes widened and you frantically grabbed for the remote, shutting off\nthe TV before the two guys in the movie could get back to their\nkissing.</p><p>It\nwas now pitch black, the only light in the room having come from the\nTV. You reached for another pillow, hugging it to your upper body.</p><p>Your\nchest hurt.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>It\nhad been nearly a year since you joined the team when you realized\nthat you actively sought out Bucky\u2019s company. You had asked Steve\nif he could switch places with you at dinner so you could sit between\nboth him and Bucky. At movie nights you continued to share your\nblanket with Bucky, and every second day you would join him for a\nmorning run.</p><p>Today,\neven though you said you would stop training, having too much the\nfeeling of continuing what HYDRA had started, you found yourself in\nthe gym, watching Bucky and Sam spar.</p><p>It\nwas hilarious, to say the least. Sam clearly had troubles getting the\nupper hand, a fact that didn\u2019t surprise you; he was sparing with a\nsuper-soldier, and in real battles he had the advantage of his Falcon\nwings. Still, it was funny to watch him try, and the bantering\nbetween him and Bucky just added to the fun.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\nokay, I\u2019m done,\u201d Sam said, words clipped as he panted for breath,\nlying on his back after Bucky had slammed him onto the mat. You\nlaughed at the expression on his face, knowing his face would be beet\nred if his skin were brighter. Though, Sam didn\u2019t think it to be\nfunny and he glared at you as he rolled to his side, scrambling to\nget up.</p><p>\u201cHow\nabout you fight a super soldier for two hours?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nlooked at you, the wide smile on his face narrowing a bit as he saw\nyou contemplating it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna, Y/N, you don\u2019t have\nto,\u201d he said, but you shook your head, standing up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, it\u2019s fine. Made to be a super soldier myself, remember? You\u2019re\nnothing I couldn\u2019t take on. Besides, it\u2019s just for fun, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d\nBucky said, full smile returning. \u201cMaybe this will be some kind of\na challenge for once.\u201d</p><p>Sam\nscoffed, but you didn\u2019t mind it over the feel of excitement rushing\nthrough you as you stepped onto the mat, right in front of Bucky who\ngot back into his fighting stance.</p><p>For\na few seconds, nothing happened, then Bucky charged at you.\nInstinctively, you sidestepped him, grabbing his shoulder and arm as\nyou stood beside him to yank his upper body back while simultaneously\nkicking his feet from under him. He landed on his back.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\nwow, that was just you going easy on the kid!\u201d Sam complained.\nBucky laughed, getting back on his feet without effort.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d\nhe retorted. \u201cCannot go full Winter Soldier from the beginning on.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmiled, brightly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bucky. As I said earlier: Nothing\nI can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\nyou\u2019re just a cocky little shit.\u201d</p><p>Laughing,\nyou blocked Bucky\u2019s next attempt at striking out at you, but he\nhadn\u2019t been kidding when he said he wouldn\u2019t go easy on you next\ntime. It was getting harder and harder to elude Bucky\u2019s attacks and\nget in a few of your own. Even with all the getting frozen Bucky had\na few more years of training under his belt than you, after all. And\nbefore you knew it, it was now you the one who was getting punched\ninto the mat, but that didn\u2019t mean it was over, yet. If you were\ngetting down Bucky was getting down with you, and the expression of\nutter surprise on his face when you latched onto his shirt to pull\nhim down with you was worth the several pounds of beefy super soldier\nslamming into you, all with metal arm digging into your ribs.</p><p>Originally,\nyou had planned to bring Bucky down with and off of you in one fluid\nmotion, getting back on your feet in an instance, but somehow your\nbrain just stopped working as soon as Bucky\u2019s face got (unplanned)\nclose enough to easily bridge over the last few inches and press your\nlips to -</p><p>Bucky\nhuffed on top of you, the warm air hitting your face as his eyes\nbored into yours. Strands of soft brown hair were falling out of his\nhair tie, tickling your cheek. Warmth began to spread throughout your\nwhole body, gathering deep in the pit of your stomach as you\nliterally felt the blood rushing downwards. Only now did you realize\nthat one of Bucky\u2019s (very muscular) thighs was pressing down on\nyour crotch, making you ache all over in a bittersweet way, but you\nwere unable to pinpoint why exactly.</p><p>Carefully,\nyou pried your fingers out of their death grip on Bucky\u2019s shirt,\neyes darting down to Bucky\u2019s mouth as his tongue slipped out to\nlick away the sweat that had gathered on the curve of his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou guys okay? You\u2019re just laying down there.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice\nsounded concerned.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\nMuscles shifting, Bucky lifted himself up. Still crouching but back\non his feet, he held out a hand to help you back on your own. You\ntook it, the touch sending a pleasant tingle to mix with the warmth\nin your entire body.</p><p>Uncomfortable\nsilence. Your ears buzzed, and you all were standing there like\nidiots until the doors opened, the sound filling the entire room. You\nflinched violently, which in turn startled Bucky and he took a step\nforward, as if he would want to comfort you. Steve stepped into the\ngym.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nguys, F.R.I.D.A.Y. told me you were down- oh, Y/N, what are you doing\non the mat? I thought you didn\u2019t want to fight anymore?\u201d</p><p>You\nlooked at Steve like a deer caught in headlights, not knowing what to\nsay.</p><p>\u201cI,\nuh, I- sorry, I don\u2019t know I \u2026 I-I need to go.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nshot his friends a questioning look after he watched you practically\nflee the whole scene. Sam shrugged his shoulders, Bucky looked to the\nside, trying not to think of the horrified expression on your face\nand, most importantly, the hard line of your dick against his thigh.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/>You\nstumbled into your apartment, the door falling shut behind you with a\ndull sound. Feeling hot all over, you quickly pulled your top over\nyour head, carelessly tossing it to the floor. Nearly smashing the\nlight switch in the bathroom as you hurried to the sink, you quickly\nsplashed freezing water onto your face.</p><p>Panting,\nyou studied your face in the mirror, watching droplets of water\ntrickle down the sides of your face. Unconsciously, you pressed your\ncrotch against the sink, a muffled moan sounding.</p><p>\u201cGod,\nwhat is wrong with me?\u201d Of course, no one answered, as no one was\nthere with you. You felt like crying, and you never had cried before;\nYou were overwhelmed with the situation, not knowing what to do or\nwhat happened right now. Your body still felt hot, still was aching,\nand the pressure against your crotch relieved and fueled the burning\nat the same time.</p><p>In\nan impromptu decision, you stripped out of the rest of your clothes,\nmoving to stand under the shower. The cold water did little to calm\nyou down, though. Your skin may have felt cool to the touch now, but\nthere was still the heat pooling in your belly, and you finally\nallowed yourself to look down your body.</p><p>Your\ndick definitely was bigger than usual, standing from your body in an\nangle. You swallowed, bringing up your hand to touch it carefully. It\ntwitched at the contact, making your breath hitch. Then you wrapped\nyour fingers fully around it, and you were able to feel the pulsing\nof blood. Your ache grew, the heat in your belly flared like actual\nflames, and your cock hardened even more.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d\nyou swore, biting your lip as you began to slide your hard length in\nand out of the grip of your fingers, the water easing the way. It\nwasn\u2019t enough, not nearly, but it also felt <i>so</i> good. You\nleaned on the wall, back of your head pressed against the tiles as\nyou thrusted into your fist with a steady rhythm. Your other hand\ngrabbed blindly for the water faucet, fumbling to have the water turn\nwarm instead of cold.</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t know how much time passed while you stood under the warm\nwater spray, the occasional sigh leaving your lips, stroking your\ncock until it became too hard for you to be standing. With trembling\nlegs you lowered yourself to the ground, opening your eyes without\nhaving realized that you had closed them in the first place.</p><p>Gasping,\nyou blinked the water out of your face, just as your hips bucked up\ninvoluntarily. A clear fluid had oozed from the tip of your cock.\nExperimentally, you smeared your thumb over it, moaning softly at the\nsensation. You continued this, massaging the head while your other\nhand stroke the length of your dick.</p><p>Suddenly,\nyour breathing pattern picked up, small moans forced their way out of\nyour throat, actual tears gathered in your eyes. The ache in your\nbody built up, every touch grew more and more intense, and you could\nfeel a tingle in your balls, just as another fluid shot out of the\ntip of your cock. White decorated your thighs as ribbon after ribbon\npumped itself out of your length, making your eyes roll back into\nyour head while your body trembled all over from the intense pleasure\nraking through you.</p><p>Panting,\nyou let your hands drop to your sides, your cock feeling too\nsensitive to be touching it anymore. The great feeling of finally\nhaving satisfied the ache passed, taking the pleasure and warmth with\nit.</p><p>You\nshivered out of entirely different reasons now, and pulled yourself\nback on your feet. Sniffling, you took hold of the shower head,\nwashing off the last remains of the white fluid before leaning\nagainst the wall again.</p><p>What\nhad this been? It had felt good, <i>so good,</i> but now you just\nfelt empty, all while salty tears mingled with the water drops on\nyour cheeks.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t knew it was possible for an AI to actually sound this\ncaring, only by calling someone\u2019s name as well. F.R.I.D.A.Y. did\nsound caring, voice gentle and quiet as to not disturb the silence\nyou had engulfed in for the past or so hour too harshly. She was\npatient, waiting for your answer as you were taking your time (a\nquite generous amount of time).</p><p>After\nyou had emerged from the shower and dried yourself up, you had put on\nthe softest clothes you could find in the closet and burried yourself\nin your favorite blanket on your bed, along with all the pillows you\nhad. You had just laid there, cozy and warm, while you drifted in and\nout of a state where you were able to think about nothing. For the\nrest, your thoughts were a mess. You thought about Bucky, about the \u2026\nthe thing in the gym, and <i>whatever</i> happened afterwards;\nsomething you didn\u2019t know what to think of.</p><p>It\nwas easier to just bury yourself away, so you did just that.</p><p>Anyways,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had called out and was waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d\nYour voice was small, just as quiet as hers had been.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou alright?\u201d</p><p>You\nblinked, not having expected a question like that. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow,\u201d you said. \u201cI- something happened, and I don\u2019t really\nhave an idea what exactly. But I guess I am not feeling particularly\ngood.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\ndid something that sounded a bit like humming. \u201cIs there anything I\ncan do to help you?\u201d</p><p>The\nsheets rustled as you shifted in the bed, thinking about how to\nexpress your request. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get to go through\npuberty,\u201d you said, feeling your face heating up already, even\nthough you knew F.R.I.D.A.Y. would be the last to judge you. \u201dTo be\nhonest, I didn\u2019t give it much thought before and the others, and\nme, didn\u2019t think it was necessary. But I fear I missed some\naspects, important aspects.\u201d</p><p>Now,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. sounded like she was smiling, or rather would be if she\nwas human, when she talked. \u201cWell, the Internet has been used to\nask and answer many question concerning puberty; I am sure we will\nfind the answers you need.</p><p>\u201cShall\nwe start immediately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nYou sat up, stretching your whole body from the curled in position it\nhad been in. \u201cJust \u2026 I don\u2019t think the others should now about\nit. I would appreciate it if -\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\ncut in before you could finish. \u201cYou do not need to worry, Y/N,\nevery conversation between you and me will be discrete, which can\nonly be abolished by certain circumstances and protocols only a few\nselected persons have access to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou.\u201d You smiled, and as if she was smiling back, F.R.I.D.A.Y.\npulled up a holograph, waiting for you to state your first question.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>Steve\u2019s\nconcern reached a breaking point when you didn\u2019t even show up for\ndinner the following day. He ignored Bucky telling him he should\nstill give you space, ignored also Sam and even Tony, who defended\nhis AI as F.R.I.D.A.Y. refused multiple times to tell him more about\nyou other than that you were fine on your own for the moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ngo and check up on him,\u201d Steve said as soon as he swallowed his\nlast mouthful of food, standing up and pushing back his chair.</p><p>Bucky\njust rolled his eyes, Sam shot him an exasperated look, but didn\u2019t\nsay anything, both knowing better than anyone that it was pointless\nto argue with this stubborn bullhead.</p><p>The\nteam watched Steve as he left the room. In a few minutes, he reached\nyour room, pushing down the door handle. The door didn\u2019t budge,\nthough.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n-\u201d he started, but she was quick to interrupt him.</p><p>\u201cY/N\nhas been informed that you are waiting for him. It is advised to not\nenter his rooms without his consent.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nnodded, clearing his throat as he remembered the first time he barged\nin without announcing himself. That was a trait he really should\ndeposit. His patience was short-lived, but fortunately, Steve didn\u2019t\nhave to wait long before you answered the door.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nSteve.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\nhad told you as soon as Steve made his way up, and it wasn\u2019t like\nyou didn\u2019t expect Steve to come see you after your sudden\ndisappearing yesterday; you still had hoped for him leaving you alone\nfor a bit longer.</p><p>Though\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had also told you, she wouldn\u2019t let Steve in if you\ndidn\u2019t want to, you answered the door for yourself, knowing that\nyou were only deferring the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d\nSteve looked relieved as you opened the door, posture relaxing. \u201cCan\nI come in?\u201d</p><p>You\nwanted to say no, you really wanted, but in the end, you opened the\ndoor further, allowing Steve to step in. He followed you to the\ncouch, sitting down next to you.</p><p>\u201cBucky\nand Sam didn\u2019t wanna tell me what exactly happened in the gym.\u201d</p><p>He\ndidn\u2019t exactly asked for it, but it was clear that Steve wanted <i>you</i>\nto tell him. You sighed, not looking at him but instead trained your\neyes on the remote laying on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cNothing\nhappened,\u201d you began, crossing your legs, \u201cwell, I mean nothing\nbad happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nhiding here for a day now, Y/N, something bad <i>must</i> have\nhappened.\u201d</p><p>God,\nSteve was famous for his \u2018Captain-America-is-disapproving\u2019-voice\nand his \u2018Captain-America-is-disapproving\u2019-face and now it was all\ndirected at you.</p><p>You\nsighed, sagging against the arm rest as you started playing with the\nhem at the end of your pants. \u201cI \u2026 We were just sparring, okay?\nAt first, I was just watching Sam and Bucky, because, you know, it is\nreally entertaining, and then Sam meant that if I could be laughing\nat him, I might as well spar with Bucky myself, right?\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked like he wanted to interrupt, but you didn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas all okay, Bucky made sure I\u2019d know I didn\u2019t have to because I\nsaid before I didn\u2019t wanna fight anymore, but it was all okay; it\nwas supposed to be fun. And it was fun, I was excited to see how I\nwould do against the famous Winter Soldier. However, \u2026\u201d</p><p>You\nfaltered, thinking back on your enlightening research with\nF.R.I.D.A.Y., which made you think you know now what exactly\nhappened. You knew how to put it in words, but you also learned that\na topic like this was intimate, not something you share with\neverybody. Furthermore, it also included Bucky, and Bucky was Steve\u2019s\nbest friend, and it was clear to everyone that Steve was hella\nprotective of Bucky, and while you thought you and Steve grew close\nas well, that he cared for you as well (which kind of got confirmed\nwith his showing up here), you did not feel exactly confident saying\nwhat you found out about yourself.</p><p>\u201cDid\nBucky hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\nNo, no. I threw him on the mat, he threw me on the mat, nothing\nunexpected when you\u2019re sparing. It was just \u2026 what was unexpected\nwas -\u201d</p><p>You\ndid look up, gazing at Steve as you struggled to say what you\napparently had to say.</p><p>\u201cSteve,\nyou said I could come to you whatever I am worrying about or have\nproblems with.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s\nfacial expression softened. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise\nme you won\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\nyou\u2019re worrying me a bit.\u201d Steve chuckled lightly, but even\nthough you could give a shaky smile back, it did nothing to ease you\nup. You looked down into your lap again, forcing the words out.</p><p>\u201cDuring\nsparring, Bucky landed on top of me, and \u2026 and m-my body had a very\nconfusing reaction. Everything was so <i>damn</i> overwhelming and\nthen suddenly you came in and asked what I was even doing there and I\njust -\u201d you choked out the last word \u201c- panicked.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked at you with wide eyes, expression just short of dread. \u201cWhat\ndo you mean your body had a reaction?\u201d</p><p>A\nlump formed in your throat rapidly. \u201cI think I am attracted to\nBucky. A-also sexually.\u201d</p><p>Deafening\nsilence.</p><p>\u201cIt\njust happened,\u201d you frantically continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\nAt first I didn\u2019t even know what was happening, I got confused and\njust had to get out of there!\u201d</p><p>Steve\nsighed as you finished, leaning forward to support his head in his\nhands with his elbows resting on his knees. \u201cI cannot believe\nthis.\u201d</p><p>His\nwords were only muttered, barely understandable, but they made your\neyes water. <i>Again.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\npromised to not be angry,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\nam not angry.\u201d</p><p>Steve\ndidn\u2019t sound exactly angry, more like <i>grossed</i> out. Breath\nshaking, you stood up and turned away from him.</p><p>\u201cIs\nit because we\u2019re both males?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot it. I do realized that the twenty first century is way more\naccepting than the forties were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nwhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked away as you built up the courage to search for eye contact. He\ncleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. The \u2026 the notion that you\nand Bucky could -\u201d</p><p>Your\nthroat closed up and you turned away again as you pressed one hand to\nyour mouth, forcing down a whimper. That <i>hurt</i>. Even though\nSteve didn\u2019t finish.</p><p>Did\nhe think you didn\u2019t deserve to be with someone? With his best\nfriend of all people? Was it the HYDRA-thing? The fact you were male,\nthough Steve said it wasn\u2019t? The fact you were a five-year-old in a\ntwenty-something-body? The fact you still struggled with basic things\nin society? You had discovered your own libido and the whole concept\nof sex only yesterday, for god\u2019s sake!</p><p>You\nspoke before you wouldn\u2019t be able to anymore. \u201cPlease go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\nI didn\u2019t mean -\u201d</p><p>Steve\nsnapped his mouth shut, <i>thankfully</i>, when you shook your head.\n\u201cNo, I see. I shouldn\u2019t have told you, it only freaks you out.\u201d\nA broken sob escaped before you could hold it back. \u201cJust <i>go.</i>\u201d</p><p>For\nonce, Steve did what he was told. The door slammed shut behind him.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>After\ncrying for too long and falling asleep on the couch, you woke up a\nfew hours later to an aching body due to an uncomfortable position,\nswollen eyes and a dry throat. Groggily, you made your way to the\nkitchen sink, grabbing a glass to fill with water. You downed it in\none go, just to fill it again.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nY/N?\u201d God, F.R.I.D.A.Y. still sounded so caring, and you promptly\nfelt like crying again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\ntime is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwill turn half past three in the morning in exactly four minutes.\u201d</p><p>Your\nsigh got drowned out by the rumbling in your stomach, indicating the\nlack of food in the past hours. Even though you knew better, you\nopened your own fridge anyway, hoping, <i>praying</i>, that it would\ncontain something you could eat. Of course there wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIs\nsomeone in the communal kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nappears not so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nabout food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty\nof it. Boss had shawarma delivered to the compound.\u201d</p><p>Well,\nthat didn\u2019t sound too bad. Carefully, you made your way to the\ncommunal kitchen, planning to just sneak some leftover shawarma and\nheating it up at your own place.</p><p>Even\nthough it was the middle of the night, the chance of meeting someone\nwas high. Tony tended to stay in the lab longer than any other person\nwould be able to, so it wasn\u2019t unusual to find him in the kitchen\nat any time, brewing himself some coffee. Everyone on the team had\nnightmares from time to time, and if someone couldn\u2019t sleep after\nthem, they got some food, or something to drink, or stayed in the\ncommon room to watch TV on a bigger screen and a less lonely feeling\narea. Clint always craved food, Vision wasn\u2019t sleeping at all and\nyou once caught him phasing through walls and the ground to his\nheart\u2019s content.</p><p>So,\nthe chance of meeting <i>nobody</i> was slim, and of course you\ndidn\u2019t had any luck today. F.R.I.D.A.Y. had barely finished\ninforming you that \u201cMr. Barnes is making his way to the kitchen,\u201d\nthat the good assassin turned the corner, halting in his steps when\nhe saw you.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nhey,\u201d he said, smiling softly, <i>smiling softly,</i> as he stepped\nnext to you to retrieve a cup out of the cupboard. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nfine,\u201d you answered quietly, going back to shoveling shawarma onto\na plate.</p><p>Bucky\nstudied your face, then turned away to place his mug under the coffee\nmaker. \u201cWhy were you crying?\u201d</p><p>You\nfroze. \u201cHow -\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\neyes are a bit puffy.\u201d</p><p>Of\ncourse. Your entire form slumped in on itself. \u201cSteve, uh, visited\nme. Wanted to know why I, um, fled the gym.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nhummed. \u201cStubborn punk. Didn\u2019t wanna hear a thing about letting\nyou come out of your own. What did he say to make you cry?\u201d</p><p>Being\nwith Bucky was easy, you had known this early on. Even now it seemed\nso much easier to tell Bucky everything than it was with Steve, even\nthough it concerned Bucky. But Bucky was patient, eyes holding no\njudgment as they regarded you, even though you closed and opened your\nmouth again and again without actually saying something. He smiled\nagain.</p><p>\u201cYou\nwanna have a hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\nsit down, doll.\u201d</p><p>You\ndid as you were told, sat down and only a few minutes later, Bucky\nset down a steaming mug with hot chocolate in front of you, all with\nwhipped cream and cocoa powder on top. He sat down right next to you,\nnodding as you thanked him.</p><p>Blowing\non the liquid to cool it down a bit, you took your first sip. It\nreally tasted good, and after you lowered your mug back down, you\nkind of just blurted, \u201cI really like you, Bucky!\u201d</p><p>Hand\nstilling, Bucky stopped short of setting his own mug to his lips to\ntake a sip. But you didn\u2019t give him any opportunity to react.</p><p>\u201cMany,\n<i>so many </i>things are super confusing here, and I struggled many\ntimes. But you made everything just easy. It is easy to talk to you,\nit is easy to understand and accept myself when I\u2019m with you. What\n\u2026 what happened in the gym, did you \u2026 did you notice?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\npuffed, cheeks gaining color distinctly. \u201cWell, it\u2019s been hard\nnot to.\u201d</p><p>You\nstared at him dumbfounded, and he grinned, teeth showing as he cocked\nhis head to the side. \u201cGood pun, huh?\u201d</p><p>Your\nlips twitched into a watery smile. \u201cI told Steve that I like you.\nHe \u2026 he looked at me like I was crazy.\u201d</p><p>The\ncorners of your lips dropped down, Bucky grimaced, but he did take\nyour hand laying on the table top, embracing your shaking fingers\nwith his own.</p><p>\u201cI\ntold him that I didn\u2019t plan this; I didn\u2019t even know what was\ngoing on, it just happened! Then I asked him what was wrong, why he\nbecame so <i>grossed out,</i> and he just said, said that the mere\n<i>notion</i> of us two- I- he \u2026 he said he couldn\u2019t believe it.\nAnd he had his stupid \u2018Captain-America\u2019-face.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nsighed, giving your hand a quick squeeze. \u201cSteve, you goddamn\nidiot,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAlright, Y/N, nobody plans anything when it\ncomes to feelings, okay? As you said, they just happen, and no normal\nhuman being, not even Steve, who, to be exact is no normal human\nbeing, can control them. You are not a freak or something like that\nbecause you have feelings. And sometimes a fella gets a boner when\nanother hot fella presses their thigh right down there.\u201d</p><p>Again,\nyou stared at him dumbfounded. \u201cDid you just describe yourself as a\nhot fella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t\nanything wrong about being aware of \u2026 your qualities.\u201d</p><p>You\nlaughed. \u201cSee, everything\u2019s easy with you, Bucky.\u201d You looked\nat him, his eyes sparkling as he looked right back with a smile on\nhis lips. \u201cI could kiss you right now.\u201d</p><p>Your\neyes widened. \u201cOkay, sorry, no, that would be weird. I like you,\nand you gave me my first bo- wow, please make me stop talking.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nlaughed. \u201cYou know what is weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve\nkissing his first love\u2019s niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\n<i>that</i> is weird.\u201d</p><p>You\nwatched Bucky, who totally decided to lick his lips now on purpose.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m five years old and have the body of a\ntwenty-three-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nI\u2019m a semi-stable 100-year-old man in a body of a thirty-year-old.\nJust because the whole <i>universe</i> is weird, doesn\u2019t mean you\ncan\u2019t be attracted to someone a bit older than you.</p><p>\u201cObviously,\nthere are also boundaries we don\u2019t cross, but <i>you</i> did\n<i>nothing</i> wrong.\u201d</p><p>Bringing\nup a hand, you touched Bucky\u2019s cheek, thumb <strike>accidentally</strike>\nbrushing his upper lip. \u201cDoes this mean I can kiss you?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nsmiled.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><h2>Tags</h2><p><b>General:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NUj5cFwKPDsnEpTIEYI1A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NUj5cFwKPDsnEpTIEYI1A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NUj5cFwKPDsnEpTIEYI1A\">@buckys-shield</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miUIwJodtAJEdxSlsvGHPxg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miUIwJodtAJEdxSlsvGHPxg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miUIwJodtAJEdxSlsvGHPxg\">@woahmister-ohheck</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msjL3dLsAiR1bRIsuRIgAbg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msjL3dLsAiR1bRIsuRIgAbg\">@bluestroke1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDwFea9uQ94m2PN6e0CE-Xg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDwFea9uQ94m2PN6e0CE-Xg\">@tina8009</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpHWXfOCfRw5BT_O-y_fOQA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpHWXfOCfRw5BT_O-y_fOQA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpHWXfOCfRw5BT_O-y_fOQA\">@peters-vlogs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJt9KRjL8MxfM3BqYR0jxpA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJt9KRjL8MxfM3BqYR0jxpA\">@ailynalonso15</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmKGfhy1nzsdMnotu-5Pyg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmKGfhy1nzsdMnotu-5Pyg\">@x777eyes-wide-open</a><br/></p><p><b>male!Reader:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhzglZNFoG4LeYkSpTctBRA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhzglZNFoG4LeYkSpTctBRA\">@mrgrant9559-blog</a> <strike>@faeriekiing</strike><br/></p>",

July 4<sup>th</sup>,\nironically, did you open your eyes for the first time, and it wasn\u2019t\neven strange for you that you had the body of a seventeen years old,\nwhile only being alive for a few minutes.</p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t strange that you had to learn the most most basic like\nreading and writing, all while already being able to use every weapon\navailable, lifting tons of weight without breaking a sweat, and when\nyou were one week old, you had outmatched the best fighter in\nhand-to-hand combat HYDRA could find.</p><p>Though,\nlike every time HYDRA seemed to make one step closer to their\nultimate goal \u2013 to conquer the world \u2013 the Avengers were right\nbehind them.</p><p>And\nwith them were Steven Grant Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>When\nyou were looking at Steven Grant Rogers, it was a bit like looking\ninto a mirror. Although you didn\u2019t look exactly the same as him,\nthere was a striking resemblance.</p><p>You\nslightly leaned to the side, catching a glance at the figure standing\nin the doorway. The metal arm was anything you needed to see to know\nthat this was indeed the Winter Soldier. Slowly, you leaned back,\nstaring once again into the perfect baby blues of Captain America.</p><p>\u201cYou\nkicked in my door.\u201d</p><p>For\na short moment, Steve looked at a loss of words, lips parted in\nconfusion. Bucky laughed, trying to cover it up as he cleared his\nthroat, giving a little cough.</p><p>\u201cI,\nuh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>HYDRA\ndidn\u2019t set great values on moral and right social behaviors. All\nyou had learned were the things you had read in books one of the nice\nscientists had given to you. You blinked.</p><p>\u201cI\nguess it is fine, then.\u201d You finally closed the book you had been\nreading before you had unexpected visitors. Then you rose from the\nsitting position on your bed, now towering over Steve, who had been\ncrouching in front of you to be on your height. Gracefully, you\nside-stepped him, sauntering over to the only cabinet in the room to\nput back your book.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou know who we are? Why we are here?\u201d</p><p>This\nwas Bucky talking. You hummed before answering his question, starting\nto gather other books in your arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\nare the Avengers. Well, part of them; Captain America and former\nHYDRA assassin the Winter Soldier. Highest threat level.\u201d</p><p>You\nstood up, walking right in front of the Winter Soldier, this time\npeering over his shoulder. A few bodies were lying in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI\nam not dumb. This HYDRA base has surely fallen. The question is, are\nyou gonna kill me like you did the other agents, or are you gonna\ncapture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nnot going to kill you,\u201d said Steve. You looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nthe latter then.\u201d Dropping your head, you intently studied the\ncover of the book lying on top. \u201cDo you think I can bring these?\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>As\nit turned out, there was so much you didn\u2019t know about the world.</p><p>First\nof all, you could bring your books. That was nice. Just as nice as\nthe room you got at the Avengers Compound, apparently the place you\nwere going to live for now on.</p><p>Secondly,\nyou were never registered as \u2026 well, as a person living on this\nworld, so you couldn\u2019t be charged guilty for the things <strike>you\ndid</strike> HYDRA\nmade you do.</p><p>Thirdly,\nother kids had parents,\nand they are responsible for them until they are of age, meaning\neighteen years old. Technically,\nyou were four years old, a toddler, you had learned. You\nweren\u2019t supposed to be as\ntall as Thor and have arm\nwrestling matches with the Winter Soldier you were able to win.</p><p>According\nto the law, you were to be assigned a guardian, and your medical\nexamination when you first had set foot\nonto the Avengers Compound, which included a DNA\ntest, brought\nsurprising results.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nhe\u2019s my father then?\u201d</p><p>Dr.\nBanner, <i>Bruce,</i> as he insisted\nyou to call him (he didn\u2019t like Hulky very much), shook\nhis head, still looking at the hologram showing the results.</p><p>\u201cI\nam not sure how to call it, to be honest. Based on the file the\nothers found in the base, your embryo grew in vitro,\nthen they continued the growth in some kind of chamber, similar to\nthe cryo\nchambers, until\nthey seemed you fit to be \u2026 born, I guess.</p><p>\u201cThe\npoint is, you weren\u2019t born in the way it normally happens, and I\ndon\u2019t think you have to see him as a father. HYDRA just borrowed\nsome of his DNA. The parts effected by the super soldier serum, to be\nexact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrothers?\u201d</p><p>Bruce\nnodded, a bit distracted as he wasn\u2019t able to look away from your\ntest results. \u201cMaybe more like that, I don\u2019t know. More\nimportant, though, is that you don\u2019t have to see him as anything.\nYou don\u2019t even have to talk to him if you do not want to. It\u2019s\nall up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>Now,\nBruce finally looked at you, giving you a shy smile. \u201cI understand\nif you\u2019re a bit overwhelmed of the whole situation, but everything\nwill settle in a few days or weeks time. Don\u2019t worry. If you need\nhelp you can come to any of us, or ask F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d</p><p>You\ntried to return his smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\ngonna find back to your room on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThough, it was more like an entire apartment than a simple room.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course.\nDinner is at half past eight. If you want to join us. Today\u2019s one\nof the few days were everyone can attend, but you don\u2019t have to\nfeel obligated to show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It\nhad just turned eight o\u2019clock, and you picked up the remote to\npress the necessary button to have Netflix go to the next episode of\nBrooklyn 99 without having to wait five seconds. Your hand dropped\nback to your side, landing on the <i>incredible</i> soft blanket you\nhad thrown over your legs, tucking the end under your feet.</p><p>The\nblanket was really soft, like, <i>really</i> soft. You had asked\nF.R.I.D.A.Y., who said it was something called cashmere. Once again,\nyou lifted the corner of it to your face, letting it glide over your\ncheek to relish in its softness.</p><p>A\nsmall chuckle escaped you as you watched Boyle pouring hot coffee all\nover himself and under his bandages, your hands lowering back down so\nyou could keep gliding your finger tips over the fabric.</p><p>However,\nwhen Steve entered your <strike>room</strike> apartment, two plates\nfilled with food in his hands, he found the couch empty, the blanket\ndiscarded over the back of it, while the TV still played your show.</p><p>Steve\nset down the plates on the coffee table. \u201cY/N?\u201d he called out,\nturning to look over the apartment. Only after a few seconds did you\nstep out of the corner you were hiding in, shooting Steve an\nindefinable look.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d\nSteve said. \u201cI, uh, I took the liberty of having F.R.I.D.A.Y. open\nthe door for me.\u201d</p><p>You\nstared at him, eyes flickering to the plates on the coffee table and\nthe steam rising from the hot food. \u201cYou could have just let her\nask me to open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\nyes, I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nstartled me, and I panicked a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\nI am sorry, I just \u2026 wanted to eat dinner with you. And maybe talk\na bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d\nyou said, \u201cokay. I am not really hungry, though.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nsmiled. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>You\nnodded, sitting back down on the couch next to your blanket, and\naccepted the plate Steve offered you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthis?\u201d you asked, digging your fork into \u2026 you didn\u2019t know what\nit was. It crushed under the force, revealing a filling of what you\nassumed were vegetables.</p><p>\u201cSpring\nrolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d\nyou said, still having no clue what Steve brought you.</p><p>He\nonly chuckled. \u201cJust try it. They\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\nyou say so.\u201d You lifted the fork to your mouth, sniffing at the\nfood first before trying it. The pastry crunched in your mouth, the\nvegetables were soft.</p><p>Steve\nlooked at you expectantly. You tried a small smile and nodded. \u201cIt\ntastes good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d\nhe said, picking up his own meal. It was silent for a short time,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had been so polite to pause the current episode, and you\nwatched Steve while munching on your spring rolls.</p><p>\u201cIs\nthis about your DNA?\u201d</p><p>Steve\nchoked a bit on his food, face turning red as he coughed. \u201cI-\nwhat?\u201d</p><p>You\ncould hear his heart thumping even faster in his chest than before,\nand the blush didn\u2019t subside.</p><p>\u201cI\nasked if this is about your DNA. Bruce surely must have told you that\nHYDRA used your DNA to create me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\n\u2026\u201d Steve looked to the side and set his plate down. \u201cYes, it\nmay be. Bruce- I- yes, Bruce told me about it. He also told me that \u2026\nthat you asked if I would be your father now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFathers\nand sons share the same DNA. But Bruce also said that brothers share\nthe same DNA. However it is up to me how I see you.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nnodded. The red color on his skin had faded a bit. \u201cOf course.\nNobody\u2019s going to tell you what to do. You see, when I woke up in\nthis century, I knew nothing about this world. Everything had changed\nand I would have been lost without the team.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow that you have been alive for only a few years to begin with <i>and</i>\nlived in isolation. I just wanted you to know that you have me if you\nneed help, <i>like</i> a brother. If you want.\u201d</p><p>You\nwatched Steve, eyes straight on staring into his (which didn\u2019t\ntotally unnerved him). \u201cSo, like a big brother helping his little\nbrother. I saw about this in some show.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nchuckled. \u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\nbig bro, wanna watch some Brooklyn 99 while eating spring rolls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nhe laughed, picking up his own food to continue eating. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nBrooklyn 99?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\nwatch it,\u201d you said, mimicking Steve\u2019s words from earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s\ngood.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br>When\nyou befriend Steve Rogers, you automatically have to befriend Bucky\nBarnes \u2013 or have to put up with him even if you don\u2019t like him.\nFortunately, it was the former for you (unlike Sam; though you\nweren\u2019t sure if Sam really hated Bucky or the other way around;\nthey were bantering, like siblings, you had thought).</p><p>You\nknew that Bucky had been with HYDRA for a long time, not voluntarily.\nHowever, you always had thought you were kind of connected. You liked\nit when Bucky was around. He didn\u2019t say much, but he was a calming\npresence, making everything \u2013 adjusting, and learning, and\ninteracting with other people - seem easier. You had talked a few\ntimes with him about HYDRA, about his time there, even though Bucky\u2019s\nexperience was much different, with the whole being tortured and\ntaken apart and remade.</p><p>Nevertheless,\nit was good to talk with someone about HYDRA and your own\nexperiences. Steve was always there for you, of course, but after a\nfew months you realized that every person on the team had a few\ntopics you could talk to them about and a few topics you rather not\ntalk to them about.</p><p>And\nsometimes you liked to imagine that Bucky might like talking to you,\ntoo.<br><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It\nonly took Bucky a few seconds to open his door, revealing you with\nyour blanket in your hands.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nBucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\nY/N,\u201d Bucky greeted back. \u201cSteve ain\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI know, he\u2019s in the gym. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\nDid somethin\u2019 happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\nOh, no. Just wanted some company.\u201d You stopped in your tracks,\nlooking back at Bucky while he was closing the door. \u201cAm I\nintrusive? Bruce said it is fine to seek company of the people you\nlike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Bucky chuckled a bit, following you into the\nliving room area. \u201cYou always carry that blanket with ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\nIt\u2019s soft.\u201d You sat and patted the space on the couch next to\nyou, telling Bucky to sit down with you. Without another word, you\npicked up the blanket and arranged it that both you and Bucky were\nwrapped in its fluffiness.\u201dDidn\u2019t had much soft things while\nbeing with HYDRA.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nwiggled a bit in his place, getting comfortable as he settled in,\nyour shoulders touching. \u201cYeah, know whatcha mean. When I came here\nfirst, everything was bright and soft and nice. Didn\u2019t think I\ndeserved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause\nof the things HYDRA made you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nI just didn\u2019t think of it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\ndeserve nice things. That\u2019s what Steve always says, but I am not so\nsure about that.\u201d You turned your head, looking at Bucky.\n\u201cInteracting with people is hard,\u201d you said, studying Bucky\u2019s\ncalm eyes. \u201cKnowing how they feel and acting appropriately is\nhard.\u201d Gaze lowering down on your hands, you began petting the\nblanket.</p><p>\u201c\u2019S\nalright,\u201d Bucky said, \u201cit really is hard sometimes.\u201d</p><p>You\nnodded, contemplating if you should tell Bucky that it never was hard\nwith him, and that you liked it, but then decided against it.</p><p>Bucky\nsmiled, just as soft as the blanket, and it made you feel warm over \u2013\nit was confusing. But you smiled back, even laughing when he bumped\nhis shoulder with yours. But you sobered up quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow that- I know HYDRA made me because they wanted another weapon\nlike you. I was trained, and trained, and trained every day, and even\nthough I rarely got tired, I <i>am</i> tired of it. You know what I\nmean?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nnodded, letting you talk.</p><p>\u201cI\nkept up the routine because I didn\u2019t know what else to do, but I\ndecided to just \u2026 stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nokay.\u201d</p><p>You\nhummed, sinking further into the cushions. Everything was okay,\nalways okay. There were still so much thinks making life not okay at\nthe moment, but \u2013 unsurprisingly by now, you thought \u2013 with Bucky\nthis fact didn\u2019t seem so important anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\nthink I need a nap.\u201d You sighed.</p><p>\u201cLay\ndown, doll,\u201d Bucky said, grabbing the blanket and the pillow to put\nit in his lap. After you laid down, he threw the blanket over your\nform, letting you snuggle into it.</p><p>Being\nwith Bucky was easy.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It\nwas in times like these where you felt lonely.</p><p>After\nlearning the concept of two people being more than friends, <i>loving\neach other,</i> you also learned the concept of feeling lonely.</p><p>You\nshould really stop watching these films, and movies, and reading\nbooks. Love stories weren\u2019t good. It made you crave things.\nCloseness, <i>proximity,</i> human touch, hugs, <i>kisses, Bu-</i></p><p>Your\neyes widened and you frantically grabbed for the remote, shutting off\nthe TV before the two guys in the movie could get back to their\nkissing.</p><p>It\nwas now pitch black, the only light in the room having come from the\nTV. You reached for another pillow, hugging it to your upper body.</p><p>Your\nchest hurt.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It\nhad been nearly a year since you joined the team when you realized\nthat you actively sought out Bucky\u2019s company. You had asked Steve\nif he could switch places with you at dinner so you could sit between\nboth him and Bucky. At movie nights you continued to share your\nblanket with Bucky, and every second day you would join him for a\nmorning run.</p><p>Today,\neven though you said you would stop training, having too much the\nfeeling of continuing what HYDRA had started, you found yourself in\nthe gym, watching Bucky and Sam spar.</p><p>It\nwas hilarious, to say the least. Sam clearly had troubles getting the\nupper hand, a fact that didn\u2019t surprise you; he was sparing with a\nsuper-soldier, and in real battles he had the advantage of his Falcon\nwings. Still, it was funny to watch him try, and the bantering\nbetween him and Bucky just added to the fun.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\nokay, I\u2019m done,\u201d Sam said, words clipped as he panted for breath,\nlying on his back after Bucky had slammed him onto the mat. You\nlaughed at the expression on his face, knowing his face would be beet\nred if his skin were brighter. Though, Sam didn\u2019t think it to be\nfunny and he glared at you as he rolled to his side, scrambling to\nget up.</p><p>\u201cHow\nabout you fight a super soldier for two hours?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nlooked at you, the wide smile on his face narrowing a bit as he saw\nyou contemplating it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna, Y/N, you don\u2019t have\nto,\u201d he said, but you shook your head, standing up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, it\u2019s fine. Made to be a super soldier myself, remember? You\u2019re\nnothing I couldn\u2019t take on. Besides, it\u2019s just for fun, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d\nBucky said, full smile returning. \u201cMaybe this will be some kind of\na challenge for once.\u201d</p><p>Sam\nscoffed, but you didn\u2019t mind it over the feel of excitement rushing\nthrough you as you stepped onto the mat, right in front of Bucky who\ngot back into his fighting stance.</p><p>For\na few seconds, nothing happened, then Bucky charged at you.\nInstinctively, you sidestepped him, grabbing his shoulder and arm as\nyou stood beside him to yank his upper body back while simultaneously\nkicking his feet from under him. He landed on his back.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\nwow, that was just you going easy on the kid!\u201d Sam complained.\nBucky laughed, getting back on his feet without effort.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d\nhe retorted. \u201cCannot go full Winter Soldier from the beginning on.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmiled, brightly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bucky. As I said earlier: Nothing\nI can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\nyou\u2019re just a cocky little shit.\u201d</p><p>Laughing,\nyou blocked Bucky\u2019s next attempt at striking out at you, but he\nhadn\u2019t been kidding when he said he wouldn\u2019t go easy on you next\ntime. It was getting harder and harder to elude Bucky\u2019s attacks and\nget in a few of your own. Even with all the getting frozen Bucky had\na few more years of training under his belt than you, after all. And\nbefore you knew it, it was now you the one who was getting punched\ninto the mat, but that didn\u2019t mean it was over, yet. If you were\ngetting down Bucky was getting down with you, and the expression of\nutter surprise on his face when you latched onto his shirt to pull\nhim down with you was worth the several pounds of beefy super soldier\nslamming into you, all with metal arm digging into your ribs.</p><p>Originally,\nyou had planned to bring Bucky down with and off of you in one fluid\nmotion, getting back on your feet in an instance, but somehow your\nbrain just stopped working as soon as Bucky\u2019s face got (unplanned)\nclose enough to easily bridge over the last few inches and press your\nlips to -</p><p>Bucky\nhuffed on top of you, the warm air hitting your face as his eyes\nbored into yours. Strands of soft brown hair were falling out of his\nhair tie, tickling your cheek. Warmth began to spread throughout your\nwhole body, gathering deep in the pit of your stomach as you\nliterally felt the blood rushing downwards. Only now did you realize\nthat one of Bucky\u2019s (very muscular) thighs was pressing down on\nyour crotch, making you ache all over in a bittersweet way, but you\nwere unable to pinpoint why exactly.</p><p>Carefully,\nyou pried your fingers out of their death grip on Bucky\u2019s shirt,\neyes darting down to Bucky\u2019s mouth as his tongue slipped out to\nlick away the sweat that had gathered on the curve of his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou guys okay? You\u2019re just laying down there.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice\nsounded concerned.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\nMuscles shifting, Bucky lifted himself up. Still crouching but back\non his feet, he held out a hand to help you back on your own. You\ntook it, the touch sending a pleasant tingle to mix with the warmth\nin your entire body.</p><p>Uncomfortable\nsilence. Your ears buzzed, and you all were standing there like\nidiots until the doors opened, the sound filling the entire room. You\nflinched violently, which in turn startled Bucky and he took a step\nforward, as if he would want to comfort you. Steve stepped into the\ngym.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nguys, F.R.I.D.A.Y. told me you were down- oh, Y/N, what are you doing\non the mat? I thought you didn\u2019t want to fight anymore?\u201d</p><p>You\nlooked at Steve like a deer caught in headlights, not knowing what to\nsay.</p><p>\u201cI,\nuh, I- sorry, I don\u2019t know I \u2026 I-I need to go.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nshot his friends a questioning look after he watched you practically\nflee the whole scene. Sam shrugged his shoulders, Bucky looked to the\nside, trying not to think of the horrified expression on your face\nand, most importantly, the hard line of your dick against his thigh.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br>You\nstumbled into your apartment, the door falling shut behind you with a\ndull sound. Feeling hot all over, you quickly pulled your top over\nyour head, carelessly tossing it to the floor. Nearly smashing the\nlight switch in the bathroom as you hurried to the sink, you quickly\nsplashed freezing water onto your face.</p><p>Panting,\nyou studied your face in the mirror, watching droplets of water\ntrickle down the sides of your face. Unconsciously, you pressed your\ncrotch against the sink, a muffled moan sounding.</p><p>\u201cGod,\nwhat is wrong with me?\u201d Of course, no one answered, as no one was\nthere with you. You felt like crying, and you never had cried before;\nYou were overwhelmed with the situation, not knowing what to do or\nwhat happened right now. Your body still felt hot, still was aching,\nand the pressure against your crotch relieved and fueled the burning\nat the same time.</p><p>In\nan impromptu decision, you stripped out of the rest of your clothes,\nmoving to stand under the shower. The cold water did little to calm\nyou down, though. Your skin may have felt cool to the touch now, but\nthere was still the heat pooling in your belly, and you finally\nallowed yourself to look down your body.</p><p>Your\ndick definitely was bigger than usual, standing from your body in an\nangle. You swallowed, bringing up your hand to touch it carefully. It\ntwitched at the contact, making your breath hitch. Then you wrapped\nyour fingers fully around it, and you were able to feel the pulsing\nof blood. Your ache grew, the heat in your belly flared like actual\nflames, and your cock hardened even more.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d\nyou swore, biting your lip as you began to slide your hard length in\nand out of the grip of your fingers, the water easing the way. It\nwasn\u2019t enough, not nearly, but it also felt <i>so</i> good. You\nleaned on the wall, back of your head pressed against the tiles as\nyou thrusted into your fist with a steady rhythm. Your other hand\ngrabbed blindly for the water faucet, fumbling to have the water turn\nwarm instead of cold.</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t know how much time passed while you stood under the warm\nwater spray, the occasional sigh leaving your lips, stroking your\ncock until it became too hard for you to be standing. With trembling\nlegs you lowered yourself to the ground, opening your eyes without\nhaving realized that you had closed them in the first place.</p><p>Gasping,\nyou blinked the water out of your face, just as your hips bucked up\ninvoluntarily. A clear fluid had oozed from the tip of your cock.\nExperimentally, you smeared your thumb over it, moaning softly at the\nsensation. You continued this, massaging the head while your other\nhand stroke the length of your dick.</p><p>Suddenly,\nyour breathing pattern picked up, small moans forced their way out of\nyour throat, actual tears gathered in your eyes. The ache in your\nbody built up, every touch grew more and more intense, and you could\nfeel a tingle in your balls, just as another fluid shot out of the\ntip of your cock. White decorated your thighs as ribbon after ribbon\npumped itself out of your length, making your eyes roll back into\nyour head while your body trembled all over from the intense pleasure\nraking through you.</p><p>Panting,\nyou let your hands drop to your sides, your cock feeling too\nsensitive to be touching it anymore. The great feeling of finally\nhaving satisfied the ache passed, taking the pleasure and warmth with\nit.</p><p>You\nshivered out of entirely different reasons now, and pulled yourself\nback on your feet. Sniffling, you took hold of the shower head,\nwashing off the last remains of the white fluid before leaning\nagainst the wall again.</p><p>What\nhad this been? It had felt good, <i>so good,</i> but now you just\nfelt empty, all while salty tears mingled with the water drops on\nyour cheeks.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t knew it was possible for an AI to actually sound this\ncaring, only by calling someone\u2019s name as well. F.R.I.D.A.Y. did\nsound caring, voice gentle and quiet as to not disturb the silence\nyou had engulfed in for the past or so hour too harshly. She was\npatient, waiting for your answer as you were taking your time (a\nquite generous amount of time).</p><p>After\nyou had emerged from the shower and dried yourself up, you had put on\nthe softest clothes you could find in the closet and burried yourself\nin your favorite blanket on your bed, along with all the pillows you\nhad. You had just laid there, cozy and warm, while you drifted in and\nout of a state where you were able to think about nothing. For the\nrest, your thoughts were a mess. You thought about Bucky, about the \u2026\nthe thing in the gym, and <i>whatever</i> happened afterwards;\nsomething you didn\u2019t know what to think of.</p><p>It\nwas easier to just bury yourself away, so you did just that.</p><p>Anyways,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had called out and was waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d\nYour voice was small, just as quiet as hers had been.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou alright?\u201d</p><p>You\nblinked, not having expected a question like that. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow,\u201d you said. \u201cI- something happened, and I don\u2019t really\nhave an idea what exactly. But I guess I am not feeling particularly\ngood.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\ndid something that sounded a bit like humming. \u201cIs there anything I\ncan do to help you?\u201d</p><p>The\nsheets rustled as you shifted in the bed, thinking about how to\nexpress your request. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get to go through\npuberty,\u201d you said, feeling your face heating up already, even\nthough you knew F.R.I.D.A.Y. would be the last to judge you. \u201dTo be\nhonest, I didn\u2019t give it much thought before and the others, and\nme, didn\u2019t think it was necessary. But I fear I missed some\naspects, important aspects.\u201d</p><p>Now,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. sounded like she was smiling, or rather would be if she\nwas human, when she talked. \u201cWell, the Internet has been used to\nask and answer many question concerning puberty; I am sure we will\nfind the answers you need.</p><p>\u201cShall\nwe start immediately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nYou sat up, stretching your whole body from the curled in position it\nhad been in. \u201cJust \u2026 I don\u2019t think the others should now about\nit. I would appreciate it if -\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\ncut in before you could finish. \u201cYou do not need to worry, Y/N,\nevery conversation between you and me will be discrete, which can\nonly be abolished by certain circumstances and protocols only a few\nselected persons have access to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou.\u201d You smiled, and as if she was smiling back, F.R.I.D.A.Y.\npulled up a holograph, waiting for you to state your first question.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Steve\u2019s\nconcern reached a breaking point when you didn\u2019t even show up for\ndinner the following day. He ignored Bucky telling him he should\nstill give you space, ignored also Sam and even Tony, who defended\nhis AI as F.R.I.D.A.Y. refused multiple times to tell him more about\nyou other than that you were fine on your own for the moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ngo and check up on him,\u201d Steve said as soon as he swallowed his\nlast mouthful of food, standing up and pushing back his chair.</p><p>Bucky\njust rolled his eyes, Sam shot him an exasperated look, but didn\u2019t\nsay anything, both knowing better than anyone that it was pointless\nto argue with this stubborn bullhead.</p><p>The\nteam watched Steve as he left the room. In a few minutes, he reached\nyour room, pushing down the door handle. The door didn\u2019t budge,\nthough.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n-\u201d he started, but she was quick to interrupt him.</p><p>\u201cY/N\nhas been informed that you are waiting for him. It is advised to not\nenter his rooms without his consent.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nnodded, clearing his throat as he remembered the first time he barged\nin without announcing himself. That was a trait he really should\ndeposit. His patience was short-lived, but fortunately, Steve didn\u2019t\nhave to wait long before you answered the door.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nSteve.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\nhad told you as soon as Steve made his way up, and it wasn\u2019t like\nyou didn\u2019t expect Steve to come see you after your sudden\ndisappearing yesterday; you still had hoped for him leaving you alone\nfor a bit longer.</p><p>Though\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had also told you, she wouldn\u2019t let Steve in if you\ndidn\u2019t want to, you answered the door for yourself, knowing that\nyou were only deferring the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d\nSteve looked relieved as you opened the door, posture relaxing. \u201cCan\nI come in?\u201d</p><p>You\nwanted to say no, you really wanted, but in the end, you opened the\ndoor further, allowing Steve to step in. He followed you to the\ncouch, sitting down next to you.</p><p>\u201cBucky\nand Sam didn\u2019t wanna tell me what exactly happened in the gym.\u201d</p><p>He\ndidn\u2019t exactly asked for it, but it was clear that Steve wanted <i>you</i>\nto tell him. You sighed, not looking at him but instead trained your\neyes on the remote laying on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cNothing\nhappened,\u201d you began, crossing your legs, \u201cwell, I mean nothing\nbad happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nhiding here for a day now, Y/N, something bad <i>must</i> have\nhappened.\u201d</p><p>God,\nSteve was famous for his \u2018Captain-America-is-disapproving\u2019-voice\nand his \u2018Captain-America-is-disapproving\u2019-face and now it was all\ndirected at you.</p><p>You\nsighed, sagging against the arm rest as you started playing with the\nhem at the end of your pants. \u201cI \u2026 We were just sparring, okay?\nAt first, I was just watching Sam and Bucky, because, you know, it is\nreally entertaining, and then Sam meant that if I could be laughing\nat him, I might as well spar with Bucky myself, right?\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked like he wanted to interrupt, but you didn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas all okay, Bucky made sure I\u2019d know I didn\u2019t have to because I\nsaid before I didn\u2019t wanna fight anymore, but it was all okay; it\nwas supposed to be fun. And it was fun, I was excited to see how I\nwould do against the famous Winter Soldier. However, \u2026\u201d</p><p>You\nfaltered, thinking back on your enlightening research with\nF.R.I.D.A.Y., which made you think you know now what exactly\nhappened. You knew how to put it in words, but you also learned that\na topic like this was intimate, not something you share with\neverybody. Furthermore, it also included Bucky, and Bucky was Steve\u2019s\nbest friend, and it was clear to everyone that Steve was hella\nprotective of Bucky, and while you thought you and Steve grew close\nas well, that he cared for you as well (which kind of got confirmed\nwith his showing up here), you did not feel exactly confident saying\nwhat you found out about yourself.</p><p>\u201cDid\nBucky hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\nNo, no. I threw him on the mat, he threw me on the mat, nothing\nunexpected when you\u2019re sparing. It was just \u2026 what was unexpected\nwas -\u201d</p><p>You\ndid look up, gazing at Steve as you struggled to say what you\napparently had to say.</p><p>\u201cSteve,\nyou said I could come to you whatever I am worrying about or have\nproblems with.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s\nfacial expression softened. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise\nme you won\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\nyou\u2019re worrying me a bit.\u201d Steve chuckled lightly, but even\nthough you could give a shaky smile back, it did nothing to ease you\nup. You looked down into your lap again, forcing the words out.</p><p>\u201cDuring\nsparring, Bucky landed on top of me, and \u2026 and m-my body had a very\nconfusing reaction. Everything was so <i>damn</i> overwhelming and\nthen suddenly you came in and asked what I was even doing there and I\njust -\u201d you choked out the last word \u201c- panicked.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked at you with wide eyes, expression just short of dread. \u201cWhat\ndo you mean your body had a reaction?\u201d</p><p>A\nlump formed in your throat rapidly. \u201cI think I am attracted to\nBucky. A-also sexually.\u201d</p><p>Deafening\nsilence.</p><p>\u201cIt\njust happened,\u201d you frantically continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\nAt first I didn\u2019t even know what was happening, I got confused and\njust had to get out of there!\u201d</p><p>Steve\nsighed as you finished, leaning forward to support his head in his\nhands with his elbows resting on his knees. \u201cI cannot believe\nthis.\u201d</p><p>His\nwords were only muttered, barely understandable, but they made your\neyes water. <i>Again.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\npromised to not be angry,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\nam not angry.\u201d</p><p>Steve\ndidn\u2019t sound exactly angry, more like <i>grossed</i> out. Breath\nshaking, you stood up and turned away from him.</p><p>\u201cIs\nit because we\u2019re both males?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot it. I do realized that the twenty first century is way more\naccepting than the forties were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nwhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked away as you built up the courage to search for eye contact. He\ncleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. The \u2026 the notion that you\nand Bucky could -\u201d</p><p>Your\nthroat closed up and you turned away again as you pressed one hand to\nyour mouth, forcing down a whimper. That <i>hurt</i>. Even though\nSteve didn\u2019t finish.</p><p>Did\nhe think you didn\u2019t deserve to be with someone? With his best\nfriend of all people? Was it the HYDRA-thing? The fact you were male,\nthough Steve said it wasn\u2019t? The fact you were a five-year-old in a\ntwenty-something-body? The fact you still struggled with basic things\nin society? You had discovered your own libido and the whole concept\nof sex only yesterday, for god\u2019s sake!</p><p>You\nspoke before you wouldn\u2019t be able to anymore. \u201cPlease go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\nI didn\u2019t mean -\u201d</p><p>Steve\nsnapped his mouth shut, <i>thankfully</i>, when you shook your head.\n\u201cNo, I see. I shouldn\u2019t have told you, it only freaks you out.\u201d\nA broken sob escaped before you could hold it back. \u201cJust <i>go.</i>\u201d</p><p>For\nonce, Steve did what he was told. The door slammed shut behind him.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After\ncrying for too long and falling asleep on the couch, you woke up a\nfew hours later to an aching body due to an uncomfortable position,\nswollen eyes and a dry throat. Groggily, you made your way to the\nkitchen sink, grabbing a glass to fill with water. You downed it in\none go, just to fill it again.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nY/N?\u201d God, F.R.I.D.A.Y. still sounded so caring, and you promptly\nfelt like crying again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\ntime is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwill turn half past three in the morning in exactly four minutes.\u201d</p><p>Your\nsigh got drowned out by the rumbling in your stomach, indicating the\nlack of food in the past hours. Even though you knew better, you\nopened your own fridge anyway, hoping, <i>praying</i>, that it would\ncontain something you could eat. Of course there wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIs\nsomeone in the communal kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nappears not so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nabout food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty\nof it. Boss had shawarma delivered to the compound.\u201d</p><p>Well,\nthat didn\u2019t sound too bad. Carefully, you made your way to the\ncommunal kitchen, planning to just sneak some leftover shawarma and\nheating it up at your own place.</p><p>Even\nthough it was the middle of the night, the chance of meeting someone\nwas high. Tony tended to stay in the lab longer than any other person\nwould be able to, so it wasn\u2019t unusual to find him in the kitchen\nat any time, brewing himself some coffee. Everyone on the team had\nnightmares from time to time, and if someone couldn\u2019t sleep after\nthem, they got some food, or something to drink, or stayed in the\ncommon room to watch TV on a bigger screen and a less lonely feeling\narea. Clint always craved food, Vision wasn\u2019t sleeping at all and\nyou once caught him phasing through walls and the ground to his\nheart\u2019s content.</p><p>So,\nthe chance of meeting <i>nobody</i> was slim, and of course you\ndidn\u2019t had any luck today. F.R.I.D.A.Y. had barely finished\ninforming you that \u201cMr. Barnes is making his way to the kitchen,\u201d\nthat the good assassin turned the corner, halting in his steps when\nhe saw you.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nhey,\u201d he said, smiling softly, <i>smiling softly,</i> as he stepped\nnext to you to retrieve a cup out of the cupboard. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nfine,\u201d you answered quietly, going back to shoveling shawarma onto\na plate.</p><p>Bucky\nstudied your face, then turned away to place his mug under the coffee\nmaker. \u201cWhy were you crying?\u201d</p><p>You\nfroze. \u201cHow -\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\neyes are a bit puffy.\u201d</p><p>Of\ncourse. Your entire form slumped in on itself. \u201cSteve, uh, visited\nme. Wanted to know why I, um, fled the gym.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nhummed. \u201cStubborn punk. Didn\u2019t wanna hear a thing about letting\nyou come out of your own. What did he say to make you cry?\u201d</p><p>Being\nwith Bucky was easy, you had known this early on. Even now it seemed\nso much easier to tell Bucky everything than it was with Steve, even\nthough it concerned Bucky. But Bucky was patient, eyes holding no\njudgment as they regarded you, even though you closed and opened your\nmouth again and again without actually saying something. He smiled\nagain.</p><p>\u201cYou\nwanna have a hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\nsit down, doll.\u201d</p><p>You\ndid as you were told, sat down and only a few minutes later, Bucky\nset down a steaming mug with hot chocolate in front of you, all with\nwhipped cream and cocoa powder on top. He sat down right next to you,\nnodding as you thanked him.</p><p>Blowing\non the liquid to cool it down a bit, you took your first sip. It\nreally tasted good, and after you lowered your mug back down, you\nkind of just blurted, \u201cI really like you, Bucky!\u201d</p><p>Hand\nstilling, Bucky stopped short of setting his own mug to his lips to\ntake a sip. But you didn\u2019t give him any opportunity to react.</p><p>\u201cMany,\n<i>so many </i>things are super confusing here, and I struggled many\ntimes. But you made everything just easy. It is easy to talk to you,\nit is easy to understand and accept myself when I\u2019m with you. What\n\u2026 what happened in the gym, did you \u2026 did you notice?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\npuffed, cheeks gaining color distinctly. \u201cWell, it\u2019s been hard\nnot to.\u201d</p><p>You\nstared at him dumbfounded, and he grinned, teeth showing as he cocked\nhis head to the side. \u201cGood pun, huh?\u201d</p><p>Your\nlips twitched into a watery smile. \u201cI told Steve that I like you.\nHe \u2026 he looked at me like I was crazy.\u201d</p><p>The\ncorners of your lips dropped down, Bucky grimaced, but he did take\nyour hand laying on the table top, embracing your shaking fingers\nwith his own.</p><p>\u201cI\ntold him that I didn\u2019t plan this; I didn\u2019t even know what was\ngoing on, it just happened! Then I asked him what was wrong, why he\nbecame so <i>grossed out,</i> and he just said, said that the mere\n<i>notion</i> of us two- I- he \u2026 he said he couldn\u2019t believe it.\nAnd he had his stupid \u2018Captain-America\u2019-face.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nsighed, giving your hand a quick squeeze. \u201cSteve, you goddamn\nidiot,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAlright, Y/N, nobody plans anything when it\ncomes to feelings, okay? As you said, they just happen, and no normal\nhuman being, not even Steve, who, to be exact is no normal human\nbeing, can control them. You are not a freak or something like that\nbecause you have feelings. And sometimes a fella gets a boner when\nanother hot fella presses their thigh right down there.\u201d</p><p>Again,\nyou stared at him dumbfounded. \u201cDid you just describe yourself as a\nhot fella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t\nanything wrong about being aware of \u2026 your qualities.\u201d</p><p>You\nlaughed. \u201cSee, everything\u2019s easy with you, Bucky.\u201d You looked\nat him, his eyes sparkling as he looked right back with a smile on\nhis lips. \u201cI could kiss you right now.\u201d</p><p>Your\neyes widened. \u201cOkay, sorry, no, that would be weird. I like you,\nand you gave me my first bo- wow, please make me stop talking.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nlaughed. \u201cYou know what is weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve\nkissing his first love\u2019s niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\n<i>that</i> is weird.\u201d</p><p>You\nwatched Bucky, who totally decided to lick his lips now on purpose.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m five years old and have the body of a\ntwenty-three-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nI\u2019m a semi-stable 100-year-old man in a body of a thirty-year-old.\nJust because the whole <i>universe</i> is weird, doesn\u2019t mean you\ncan\u2019t be attracted to someone a bit older than you.</p><p>\u201cObviously,\nthere are also boundaries we don\u2019t cross, but <i>you</i> did\n<i>nothing</i> wrong.\u201d</p><p>Bringing\nup a hand, you touched Bucky\u2019s cheek, thumb <strike>accidentally</strike>\nbrushing his upper lip. \u201cDoes this mean I can kiss you?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nsmiled.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Tags</h2><p><b>General:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NUj5cFwKPDsnEpTIEYI1A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NUj5cFwKPDsnEpTIEYI1A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NUj5cFwKPDsnEpTIEYI1A\">@buckys-shield</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miUIwJodtAJEdxSlsvGHPxg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miUIwJodtAJEdxSlsvGHPxg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miUIwJodtAJEdxSlsvGHPxg\">@woahmister-ohheck</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msjL3dLsAiR1bRIsuRIgAbg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msjL3dLsAiR1bRIsuRIgAbg\">@bluestroke1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDwFea9uQ94m2PN6e0CE-Xg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDwFea9uQ94m2PN6e0CE-Xg\">@tina8009</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpHWXfOCfRw5BT_O-y_fOQA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpHWXfOCfRw5BT_O-y_fOQA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpHWXfOCfRw5BT_O-y_fOQA\">@peters-vlogs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJt9KRjL8MxfM3BqYR0jxpA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJt9KRjL8MxfM3BqYR0jxpA\">@ailynalonso15</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmKGfhy1nzsdMnotu-5Pyg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmKGfhy1nzsdMnotu-5Pyg\">@x777eyes-wide-open</a><br></p><p><b>male!Reader:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhzglZNFoG4LeYkSpTctBRA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhzglZNFoG4LeYkSpTctBRA\">@mrgrant9559-blog</a> <strike>@faeriekiing</strike><br></p></p>",

July 4<sup>th</sup>,\nironically, did you open your eyes for the first time, and it wasn\u2019t\neven strange for you that you had the body of a seventeen years old,\nwhile only being alive for a few minutes.</p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t strange that you had to learn the most most basic like\nreading and writing, all while already being able to use every weapon\navailable, lifting tons of weight without breaking a sweat, and when\nyou were one week old, you had outmatched the best fighter in\nhand-to-hand combat HYDRA could find.</p><p>Though,\nlike every time HYDRA seemed to make one step closer to their\nultimate goal \u2013 to conquer the world \u2013 the Avengers were right\nbehind them.</p><p>And\nwith them were Steven Grant Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>When\nyou were looking at Steven Grant Rogers, it was a bit like looking\ninto a mirror. Although you didn\u2019t look exactly the same as him,\nthere was a striking resemblance.</p><p>You\nslightly leaned to the side, catching a glance at the figure standing\nin the doorway. The metal arm was anything you needed to see to know\nthat this was indeed the Winter Soldier. Slowly, you leaned back,\nstaring once again into the perfect baby blues of Captain America.</p><p>\u201cYou\nkicked in my door.\u201d</p><p>For\na short moment, Steve looked at a loss of words, lips parted in\nconfusion. Bucky laughed, trying to cover it up as he cleared his\nthroat, giving a little cough.</p><p>\u201cI,\nuh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>HYDRA\ndidn\u2019t set great values on moral and right social behaviors. All\nyou had learned were the things you had read in books one of the nice\nscientists had given to you. You blinked.</p><p>\u201cI\nguess it is fine, then.\u201d You finally closed the book you had been\nreading before you had unexpected visitors. Then you rose from the\nsitting position on your bed, now towering over Steve, who had been\ncrouching in front of you to be on your height. Gracefully, you\nside-stepped him, sauntering over to the only cabinet in the room to\nput back your book.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou know who we are? Why we are here?\u201d</p><p>This\nwas Bucky talking. You hummed before answering his question, starting\nto gather other books in your arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\nare the Avengers. Well, part of them; Captain America and former\nHYDRA assassin the Winter Soldier. Highest threat level.\u201d</p><p>You\nstood up, walking right in front of the Winter Soldier, this time\npeering over his shoulder. A few bodies were lying in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI\nam not dumb. This HYDRA base has surely fallen. The question is, are\nyou gonna kill me like you did the other agents, or are you gonna\ncapture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nnot going to kill you,\u201d said Steve. You looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nthe latter then.\u201d Dropping your head, you intently studied the\ncover of the book lying on top. \u201cDo you think I can bring these?\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>As\nit turned out, there was so much you didn\u2019t know about the world.</p><p>First\nof all, you could bring your books. That was nice. Just as nice as\nthe room you got at the Avengers Compound, apparently the place you\nwere going to live for now on.</p><p>Secondly,\nyou were never registered as \u2026 well, as a person living on this\nworld, so you couldn\u2019t be charged guilty for the things <strike>you\ndid</strike> HYDRA\nmade you do.</p><p>Thirdly,\nother kids had parents,\nand they are responsible for them until they are of age, meaning\neighteen years old. Technically,\nyou were four years old, a toddler, you had learned. You\nweren\u2019t supposed to be as\ntall as Thor and have arm\nwrestling matches with the Winter Soldier you were able to win.</p><p>According\nto the law, you were to be assigned a guardian, and your medical\nexamination when you first had set foot\nonto the Avengers Compound, which included a DNA\ntest, brought\nsurprising results.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nhe\u2019s my father then?\u201d</p><p>Dr.\nBanner, <i>Bruce,</i> as he insisted\nyou to call him (he didn\u2019t like Hulky very much), shook\nhis head, still looking at the hologram showing the results.</p><p>\u201cI\nam not sure how to call it, to be honest. Based on the file the\nothers found in the base, your embryo grew in vitro,\nthen they continued the growth in some kind of chamber, similar to\nthe cryo\nchambers, until\nthey seemed you fit to be \u2026 born, I guess.</p><p>\u201cThe\npoint is, you weren\u2019t born in the way it normally happens, and I\ndon\u2019t think you have to see him as a father. HYDRA just borrowed\nsome of his DNA. The parts effected by the super soldier serum, to be\nexact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrothers?\u201d</p><p>Bruce\nnodded, a bit distracted as he wasn\u2019t able to look away from your\ntest results. \u201cMaybe more like that, I don\u2019t know. More\nimportant, though, is that you don\u2019t have to see him as anything.\nYou don\u2019t even have to talk to him if you do not want to. It\u2019s\nall up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>Now,\nBruce finally looked at you, giving you a shy smile. \u201cI understand\nif you\u2019re a bit overwhelmed of the whole situation, but everything\nwill settle in a few days or weeks time. Don\u2019t worry. If you need\nhelp you can come to any of us, or ask F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d</p><p>You\ntried to return his smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\ngonna find back to your room on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThough, it was more like an entire apartment than a simple room.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course.\nDinner is at half past eight. If you want to join us. Today\u2019s one\nof the few days were everyone can attend, but you don\u2019t have to\nfeel obligated to show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It\nhad just turned eight o\u2019clock, and you picked up the remote to\npress the necessary button to have Netflix go to the next episode of\nBrooklyn 99 without having to wait five seconds. Your hand dropped\nback to your side, landing on the <i>incredible</i> soft blanket you\nhad thrown over your legs, tucking the end under your feet.</p><p>The\nblanket was really soft, like, <i>really</i> soft. You had asked\nF.R.I.D.A.Y., who said it was something called cashmere. Once again,\nyou lifted the corner of it to your face, letting it glide over your\ncheek to relish in its softness.</p><p>A\nsmall chuckle escaped you as you watched Boyle pouring hot coffee all\nover himself and under his bandages, your hands lowering back down so\nyou could keep gliding your finger tips over the fabric.</p><p>However,\nwhen Steve entered your <strike>room</strike> apartment, two plates\nfilled with food in his hands, he found the couch empty, the blanket\ndiscarded over the back of it, while the TV still played your show.</p><p>Steve\nset down the plates on the coffee table. \u201cY/N?\u201d he called out,\nturning to look over the apartment. Only after a few seconds did you\nstep out of the corner you were hiding in, shooting Steve an\nindefinable look.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d\nSteve said. \u201cI, uh, I took the liberty of having F.R.I.D.A.Y. open\nthe door for me.\u201d</p><p>You\nstared at him, eyes flickering to the plates on the coffee table and\nthe steam rising from the hot food. \u201cYou could have just let her\nask me to open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\nyes, I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nstartled me, and I panicked a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\nI am sorry, I just \u2026 wanted to eat dinner with you. And maybe talk\na bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d\nyou said, \u201cokay. I am not really hungry, though.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nsmiled. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>You\nnodded, sitting back down on the couch next to your blanket, and\naccepted the plate Steve offered you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthis?\u201d you asked, digging your fork into \u2026 you didn\u2019t know what\nit was. It crushed under the force, revealing a filling of what you\nassumed were vegetables.</p><p>\u201cSpring\nrolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d\nyou said, still having no clue what Steve brought you.</p><p>He\nonly chuckled. \u201cJust try it. They\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\nyou say so.\u201d You lifted the fork to your mouth, sniffing at the\nfood first before trying it. The pastry crunched in your mouth, the\nvegetables were soft.</p><p>Steve\nlooked at you expectantly. You tried a small smile and nodded. \u201cIt\ntastes good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d\nhe said, picking up his own meal. It was silent for a short time,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had been so polite to pause the current episode, and you\nwatched Steve while munching on your spring rolls.</p><p>\u201cIs\nthis about your DNA?\u201d</p><p>Steve\nchoked a bit on his food, face turning red as he coughed. \u201cI-\nwhat?\u201d</p><p>You\ncould hear his heart thumping even faster in his chest than before,\nand the blush didn\u2019t subside.</p><p>\u201cI\nasked if this is about your DNA. Bruce surely must have told you that\nHYDRA used your DNA to create me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\n\u2026\u201d Steve looked to the side and set his plate down. \u201cYes, it\nmay be. Bruce- I- yes, Bruce told me about it. He also told me that \u2026\nthat you asked if I would be your father now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFathers\nand sons share the same DNA. But Bruce also said that brothers share\nthe same DNA. However it is up to me how I see you.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nnodded. The red color on his skin had faded a bit. \u201cOf course.\nNobody\u2019s going to tell you what to do. You see, when I woke up in\nthis century, I knew nothing about this world. Everything had changed\nand I would have been lost without the team.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow that you have been alive for only a few years to begin with <i>and</i>\nlived in isolation. I just wanted you to know that you have me if you\nneed help, <i>like</i> a brother. If you want.\u201d</p><p>You\nwatched Steve, eyes straight on staring into his (which didn\u2019t\ntotally unnerved him). \u201cSo, like a big brother helping his little\nbrother. I saw about this in some show.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nchuckled. \u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\nbig bro, wanna watch some Brooklyn 99 while eating spring rolls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nhe laughed, picking up his own food to continue eating. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nBrooklyn 99?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\nwatch it,\u201d you said, mimicking Steve\u2019s words from earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s\ngood.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br>When\nyou befriend Steve Rogers, you automatically have to befriend Bucky\nBarnes \u2013 or have to put up with him even if you don\u2019t like him.\nFortunately, it was the former for you (unlike Sam; though you\nweren\u2019t sure if Sam really hated Bucky or the other way around;\nthey were bantering, like siblings, you had thought).</p><p>You\nknew that Bucky had been with HYDRA for a long time, not voluntarily.\nHowever, you always had thought you were kind of connected. You liked\nit when Bucky was around. He didn\u2019t say much, but he was a calming\npresence, making everything \u2013 adjusting, and learning, and\ninteracting with other people - seem easier. You had talked a few\ntimes with him about HYDRA, about his time there, even though Bucky\u2019s\nexperience was much different, with the whole being tortured and\ntaken apart and remade.</p><p>Nevertheless,\nit was good to talk with someone about HYDRA and your own\nexperiences. Steve was always there for you, of course, but after a\nfew months you realized that every person on the team had a few\ntopics you could talk to them about and a few topics you rather not\ntalk to them about.</p><p>And\nsometimes you liked to imagine that Bucky might like talking to you,\ntoo.<br><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It\nonly took Bucky a few seconds to open his door, revealing you with\nyour blanket in your hands.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nBucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\nY/N,\u201d Bucky greeted back. \u201cSteve ain\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI know, he\u2019s in the gym. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\nDid somethin\u2019 happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\nOh, no. Just wanted some company.\u201d You stopped in your tracks,\nlooking back at Bucky while he was closing the door. \u201cAm I\nintrusive? Bruce said it is fine to seek company of the people you\nlike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Bucky chuckled a bit, following you into the\nliving room area. \u201cYou always carry that blanket with ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\nIt\u2019s soft.\u201d You sat and patted the space on the couch next to\nyou, telling Bucky to sit down with you. Without another word, you\npicked up the blanket and arranged it that both you and Bucky were\nwrapped in its fluffiness.\u201dDidn\u2019t had much soft things while\nbeing with HYDRA.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nwiggled a bit in his place, getting comfortable as he settled in,\nyour shoulders touching. \u201cYeah, know whatcha mean. When I came here\nfirst, everything was bright and soft and nice. Didn\u2019t think I\ndeserved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause\nof the things HYDRA made you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nI just didn\u2019t think of it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\ndeserve nice things. That\u2019s what Steve always says, but I am not so\nsure about that.\u201d You turned your head, looking at Bucky.\n\u201cInteracting with people is hard,\u201d you said, studying Bucky\u2019s\ncalm eyes. \u201cKnowing how they feel and acting appropriately is\nhard.\u201d Gaze lowering down on your hands, you began petting the\nblanket.</p><p>\u201c\u2019S\nalright,\u201d Bucky said, \u201cit really is hard sometimes.\u201d</p><p>You\nnodded, contemplating if you should tell Bucky that it never was hard\nwith him, and that you liked it, but then decided against it.</p><p>Bucky\nsmiled, just as soft as the blanket, and it made you feel warm over \u2013\nit was confusing. But you smiled back, even laughing when he bumped\nhis shoulder with yours. But you sobered up quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow that- I know HYDRA made me because they wanted another weapon\nlike you. I was trained, and trained, and trained every day, and even\nthough I rarely got tired, I <i>am</i> tired of it. You know what I\nmean?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nnodded, letting you talk.</p><p>\u201cI\nkept up the routine because I didn\u2019t know what else to do, but I\ndecided to just \u2026 stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nokay.\u201d</p><p>You\nhummed, sinking further into the cushions. Everything was okay,\nalways okay. There were still so much thinks making life not okay at\nthe moment, but \u2013 unsurprisingly by now, you thought \u2013 with Bucky\nthis fact didn\u2019t seem so important anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\nthink I need a nap.\u201d You sighed.</p><p>\u201cLay\ndown, doll,\u201d Bucky said, grabbing the blanket and the pillow to put\nit in his lap. After you laid down, he threw the blanket over your\nform, letting you snuggle into it.</p><p>Being\nwith Bucky was easy.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It\nwas in times like these where you felt lonely.</p><p>After\nlearning the concept of two people being more than friends, <i>loving\neach other,</i> you also learned the concept of feeling lonely.</p><p>You\nshould really stop watching these films, and movies, and reading\nbooks. Love stories weren\u2019t good. It made you crave things.\nCloseness, <i>proximity,</i> human touch, hugs, <i>kisses, Bu-</i></p><p>Your\neyes widened and you frantically grabbed for the remote, shutting off\nthe TV before the two guys in the movie could get back to their\nkissing.</p><p>It\nwas now pitch black, the only light in the room having come from the\nTV. You reached for another pillow, hugging it to your upper body.</p><p>Your\nchest hurt.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It\nhad been nearly a year since you joined the team when you realized\nthat you actively sought out Bucky\u2019s company. You had asked Steve\nif he could switch places with you at dinner so you could sit between\nboth him and Bucky. At movie nights you continued to share your\nblanket with Bucky, and every second day you would join him for a\nmorning run.</p><p>Today,\neven though you said you would stop training, having too much the\nfeeling of continuing what HYDRA had started, you found yourself in\nthe gym, watching Bucky and Sam spar.</p><p>It\nwas hilarious, to say the least. Sam clearly had troubles getting the\nupper hand, a fact that didn\u2019t surprise you; he was sparing with a\nsuper-soldier, and in real battles he had the advantage of his Falcon\nwings. Still, it was funny to watch him try, and the bantering\nbetween him and Bucky just added to the fun.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\nokay, I\u2019m done,\u201d Sam said, words clipped as he panted for breath,\nlying on his back after Bucky had slammed him onto the mat. You\nlaughed at the expression on his face, knowing his face would be beet\nred if his skin were brighter. Though, Sam didn\u2019t think it to be\nfunny and he glared at you as he rolled to his side, scrambling to\nget up.</p><p>\u201cHow\nabout you fight a super soldier for two hours?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nlooked at you, the wide smile on his face narrowing a bit as he saw\nyou contemplating it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna, Y/N, you don\u2019t have\nto,\u201d he said, but you shook your head, standing up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, it\u2019s fine. Made to be a super soldier myself, remember? You\u2019re\nnothing I couldn\u2019t take on. Besides, it\u2019s just for fun, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d\nBucky said, full smile returning. \u201cMaybe this will be some kind of\na challenge for once.\u201d</p><p>Sam\nscoffed, but you didn\u2019t mind it over the feel of excitement rushing\nthrough you as you stepped onto the mat, right in front of Bucky who\ngot back into his fighting stance.</p><p>For\na few seconds, nothing happened, then Bucky charged at you.\nInstinctively, you sidestepped him, grabbing his shoulder and arm as\nyou stood beside him to yank his upper body back while simultaneously\nkicking his feet from under him. He landed on his back.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\nwow, that was just you going easy on the kid!\u201d Sam complained.\nBucky laughed, getting back on his feet without effort.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d\nhe retorted. \u201cCannot go full Winter Soldier from the beginning on.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmiled, brightly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bucky. As I said earlier: Nothing\nI can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\nyou\u2019re just a cocky little shit.\u201d</p><p>Laughing,\nyou blocked Bucky\u2019s next attempt at striking out at you, but he\nhadn\u2019t been kidding when he said he wouldn\u2019t go easy on you next\ntime. It was getting harder and harder to elude Bucky\u2019s attacks and\nget in a few of your own. Even with all the getting frozen Bucky had\na few more years of training under his belt than you, after all. And\nbefore you knew it, it was now you the one who was getting punched\ninto the mat, but that didn\u2019t mean it was over, yet. If you were\ngetting down Bucky was getting down with you, and the expression of\nutter surprise on his face when you latched onto his shirt to pull\nhim down with you was worth the several pounds of beefy super soldier\nslamming into you, all with metal arm digging into your ribs.</p><p>Originally,\nyou had planned to bring Bucky down with and off of you in one fluid\nmotion, getting back on your feet in an instance, but somehow your\nbrain just stopped working as soon as Bucky\u2019s face got (unplanned)\nclose enough to easily bridge over the last few inches and press your\nlips to -</p><p>Bucky\nhuffed on top of you, the warm air hitting your face as his eyes\nbored into yours. Strands of soft brown hair were falling out of his\nhair tie, tickling your cheek. Warmth began to spread throughout your\nwhole body, gathering deep in the pit of your stomach as you\nliterally felt the blood rushing downwards. Only now did you realize\nthat one of Bucky\u2019s (very muscular) thighs was pressing down on\nyour crotch, making you ache all over in a bittersweet way, but you\nwere unable to pinpoint why exactly.</p><p>Carefully,\nyou pried your fingers out of their death grip on Bucky\u2019s shirt,\neyes darting down to Bucky\u2019s mouth as his tongue slipped out to\nlick away the sweat that had gathered on the curve of his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou guys okay? You\u2019re just laying down there.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice\nsounded concerned.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\nMuscles shifting, Bucky lifted himself up. Still crouching but back\non his feet, he held out a hand to help you back on your own. You\ntook it, the touch sending a pleasant tingle to mix with the warmth\nin your entire body.</p><p>Uncomfortable\nsilence. Your ears buzzed, and you all were standing there like\nidiots until the doors opened, the sound filling the entire room. You\nflinched violently, which in turn startled Bucky and he took a step\nforward, as if he would want to comfort you. Steve stepped into the\ngym.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nguys, F.R.I.D.A.Y. told me you were down- oh, Y/N, what are you doing\non the mat? I thought you didn\u2019t want to fight anymore?\u201d</p><p>You\nlooked at Steve like a deer caught in headlights, not knowing what to\nsay.</p><p>\u201cI,\nuh, I- sorry, I don\u2019t know I \u2026 I-I need to go.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nshot his friends a questioning look after he watched you practically\nflee the whole scene. Sam shrugged his shoulders, Bucky looked to the\nside, trying not to think of the horrified expression on your face\nand, most importantly, the hard line of your dick against his thigh.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br>You\nstumbled into your apartment, the door falling shut behind you with a\ndull sound. Feeling hot all over, you quickly pulled your top over\nyour head, carelessly tossing it to the floor. Nearly smashing the\nlight switch in the bathroom as you hurried to the sink, you quickly\nsplashed freezing water onto your face.</p><p>Panting,\nyou studied your face in the mirror, watching droplets of water\ntrickle down the sides of your face. Unconsciously, you pressed your\ncrotch against the sink, a muffled moan sounding.</p><p>\u201cGod,\nwhat is wrong with me?\u201d Of course, no one answered, as no one was\nthere with you. You felt like crying, and you never had cried before;\nYou were overwhelmed with the situation, not knowing what to do or\nwhat happened right now. Your body still felt hot, still was aching,\nand the pressure against your crotch relieved and fueled the burning\nat the same time.</p><p>In\nan impromptu decision, you stripped out of the rest of your clothes,\nmoving to stand under the shower. The cold water did little to calm\nyou down, though. Your skin may have felt cool to the touch now, but\nthere was still the heat pooling in your belly, and you finally\nallowed yourself to look down your body.</p><p>Your\ndick definitely was bigger than usual, standing from your body in an\nangle. You swallowed, bringing up your hand to touch it carefully. It\ntwitched at the contact, making your breath hitch. Then you wrapped\nyour fingers fully around it, and you were able to feel the pulsing\nof blood. Your ache grew, the heat in your belly flared like actual\nflames, and your cock hardened even more.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d\nyou swore, biting your lip as you began to slide your hard length in\nand out of the grip of your fingers, the water easing the way. It\nwasn\u2019t enough, not nearly, but it also felt <i>so</i> good. You\nleaned on the wall, back of your head pressed against the tiles as\nyou thrusted into your fist with a steady rhythm. Your other hand\ngrabbed blindly for the water faucet, fumbling to have the water turn\nwarm instead of cold.</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t know how much time passed while you stood under the warm\nwater spray, the occasional sigh leaving your lips, stroking your\ncock until it became too hard for you to be standing. With trembling\nlegs you lowered yourself to the ground, opening your eyes without\nhaving realized that you had closed them in the first place.</p><p>Gasping,\nyou blinked the water out of your face, just as your hips bucked up\ninvoluntarily. A clear fluid had oozed from the tip of your cock.\nExperimentally, you smeared your thumb over it, moaning softly at the\nsensation. You continued this, massaging the head while your other\nhand stroke the length of your dick.</p><p>Suddenly,\nyour breathing pattern picked up, small moans forced their way out of\nyour throat, actual tears gathered in your eyes. The ache in your\nbody built up, every touch grew more and more intense, and you could\nfeel a tingle in your balls, just as another fluid shot out of the\ntip of your cock. White decorated your thighs as ribbon after ribbon\npumped itself out of your length, making your eyes roll back into\nyour head while your body trembled all over from the intense pleasure\nraking through you.</p><p>Panting,\nyou let your hands drop to your sides, your cock feeling too\nsensitive to be touching it anymore. The great feeling of finally\nhaving satisfied the ache passed, taking the pleasure and warmth with\nit.</p><p>You\nshivered out of entirely different reasons now, and pulled yourself\nback on your feet. Sniffling, you took hold of the shower head,\nwashing off the last remains of the white fluid before leaning\nagainst the wall again.</p><p>What\nhad this been? It had felt good, <i>so good,</i> but now you just\nfelt empty, all while salty tears mingled with the water drops on\nyour cheeks.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t knew it was possible for an AI to actually sound this\ncaring, only by calling someone\u2019s name as well. F.R.I.D.A.Y. did\nsound caring, voice gentle and quiet as to not disturb the silence\nyou had engulfed in for the past or so hour too harshly. She was\npatient, waiting for your answer as you were taking your time (a\nquite generous amount of time).</p><p>After\nyou had emerged from the shower and dried yourself up, you had put on\nthe softest clothes you could find in the closet and burried yourself\nin your favorite blanket on your bed, along with all the pillows you\nhad. You had just laid there, cozy and warm, while you drifted in and\nout of a state where you were able to think about nothing. For the\nrest, your thoughts were a mess. You thought about Bucky, about the \u2026\nthe thing in the gym, and <i>whatever</i> happened afterwards;\nsomething you didn\u2019t know what to think of.</p><p>It\nwas easier to just bury yourself away, so you did just that.</p><p>Anyways,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had called out and was waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d\nYour voice was small, just as quiet as hers had been.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou alright?\u201d</p><p>You\nblinked, not having expected a question like that. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow,\u201d you said. \u201cI- something happened, and I don\u2019t really\nhave an idea what exactly. But I guess I am not feeling particularly\ngood.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\ndid something that sounded a bit like humming. \u201cIs there anything I\ncan do to help you?\u201d</p><p>The\nsheets rustled as you shifted in the bed, thinking about how to\nexpress your request. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get to go through\npuberty,\u201d you said, feeling your face heating up already, even\nthough you knew F.R.I.D.A.Y. would be the last to judge you. \u201dTo be\nhonest, I didn\u2019t give it much thought before and the others, and\nme, didn\u2019t think it was necessary. But I fear I missed some\naspects, important aspects.\u201d</p><p>Now,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. sounded like she was smiling, or rather would be if she\nwas human, when she talked. \u201cWell, the Internet has been used to\nask and answer many question concerning puberty; I am sure we will\nfind the answers you need.</p><p>\u201cShall\nwe start immediately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nYou sat up, stretching your whole body from the curled in position it\nhad been in. \u201cJust \u2026 I don\u2019t think the others should now about\nit. I would appreciate it if -\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\ncut in before you could finish. \u201cYou do not need to worry, Y/N,\nevery conversation between you and me will be discrete, which can\nonly be abolished by certain circumstances and protocols only a few\nselected persons have access to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou.\u201d You smiled, and as if she was smiling back, F.R.I.D.A.Y.\npulled up a holograph, waiting for you to state your first question.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Steve\u2019s\nconcern reached a breaking point when you didn\u2019t even show up for\ndinner the following day. He ignored Bucky telling him he should\nstill give you space, ignored also Sam and even Tony, who defended\nhis AI as F.R.I.D.A.Y. refused multiple times to tell him more about\nyou other than that you were fine on your own for the moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ngo and check up on him,\u201d Steve said as soon as he swallowed his\nlast mouthful of food, standing up and pushing back his chair.</p><p>Bucky\njust rolled his eyes, Sam shot him an exasperated look, but didn\u2019t\nsay anything, both knowing better than anyone that it was pointless\nto argue with this stubborn bullhead.</p><p>The\nteam watched Steve as he left the room. In a few minutes, he reached\nyour room, pushing down the door handle. The door didn\u2019t budge,\nthough.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n-\u201d he started, but she was quick to interrupt him.</p><p>\u201cY/N\nhas been informed that you are waiting for him. It is advised to not\nenter his rooms without his consent.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nnodded, clearing his throat as he remembered the first time he barged\nin without announcing himself. That was a trait he really should\ndeposit. His patience was short-lived, but fortunately, Steve didn\u2019t\nhave to wait long before you answered the door.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nSteve.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\nhad told you as soon as Steve made his way up, and it wasn\u2019t like\nyou didn\u2019t expect Steve to come see you after your sudden\ndisappearing yesterday; you still had hoped for him leaving you alone\nfor a bit longer.</p><p>Though\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had also told you, she wouldn\u2019t let Steve in if you\ndidn\u2019t want to, you answered the door for yourself, knowing that\nyou were only deferring the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d\nSteve looked relieved as you opened the door, posture relaxing. \u201cCan\nI come in?\u201d</p><p>You\nwanted to say no, you really wanted, but in the end, you opened the\ndoor further, allowing Steve to step in. He followed you to the\ncouch, sitting down next to you.</p><p>\u201cBucky\nand Sam didn\u2019t wanna tell me what exactly happened in the gym.\u201d</p><p>He\ndidn\u2019t exactly asked for it, but it was clear that Steve wanted <i>you</i>\nto tell him. You sighed, not looking at him but instead trained your\neyes on the remote laying on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cNothing\nhappened,\u201d you began, crossing your legs, \u201cwell, I mean nothing\nbad happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nhiding here for a day now, Y/N, something bad <i>must</i> have\nhappened.\u201d</p><p>God,\nSteve was famous for his \u2018Captain-America-is-disapproving\u2019-voice\nand his \u2018Captain-America-is-disapproving\u2019-face and now it was all\ndirected at you.</p><p>You\nsighed, sagging against the arm rest as you started playing with the\nhem at the end of your pants. \u201cI \u2026 We were just sparring, okay?\nAt first, I was just watching Sam and Bucky, because, you know, it is\nreally entertaining, and then Sam meant that if I could be laughing\nat him, I might as well spar with Bucky myself, right?\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked like he wanted to interrupt, but you didn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas all okay, Bucky made sure I\u2019d know I didn\u2019t have to because I\nsaid before I didn\u2019t wanna fight anymore, but it was all okay; it\nwas supposed to be fun. And it was fun, I was excited to see how I\nwould do against the famous Winter Soldier. However, \u2026\u201d</p><p>You\nfaltered, thinking back on your enlightening research with\nF.R.I.D.A.Y., which made you think you know now what exactly\nhappened. You knew how to put it in words, but you also learned that\na topic like this was intimate, not something you share with\neverybody. Furthermore, it also included Bucky, and Bucky was Steve\u2019s\nbest friend, and it was clear to everyone that Steve was hella\nprotective of Bucky, and while you thought you and Steve grew close\nas well, that he cared for you as well (which kind of got confirmed\nwith his showing up here), you did not feel exactly confident saying\nwhat you found out about yourself.</p><p>\u201cDid\nBucky hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\nNo, no. I threw him on the mat, he threw me on the mat, nothing\nunexpected when you\u2019re sparing. It was just \u2026 what was unexpected\nwas -\u201d</p><p>You\ndid look up, gazing at Steve as you struggled to say what you\napparently had to say.</p><p>\u201cSteve,\nyou said I could come to you whatever I am worrying about or have\nproblems with.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s\nfacial expression softened. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise\nme you won\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\nyou\u2019re worrying me a bit.\u201d Steve chuckled lightly, but even\nthough you could give a shaky smile back, it did nothing to ease you\nup. You looked down into your lap again, forcing the words out.</p><p>\u201cDuring\nsparring, Bucky landed on top of me, and \u2026 and m-my body had a very\nconfusing reaction. Everything was so <i>damn</i> overwhelming and\nthen suddenly you came in and asked what I was even doing there and I\njust -\u201d you choked out the last word \u201c- panicked.\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked at you with wide eyes, expression just short of dread. \u201cWhat\ndo you mean your body had a reaction?\u201d</p><p>A\nlump formed in your throat rapidly. \u201cI think I am attracted to\nBucky. A-also sexually.\u201d</p><p>Deafening\nsilence.</p><p>\u201cIt\njust happened,\u201d you frantically continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\nAt first I didn\u2019t even know what was happening, I got confused and\njust had to get out of there!\u201d</p><p>Steve\nsighed as you finished, leaning forward to support his head in his\nhands with his elbows resting on his knees. \u201cI cannot believe\nthis.\u201d</p><p>His\nwords were only muttered, barely understandable, but they made your\neyes water. <i>Again.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\npromised to not be angry,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\nam not angry.\u201d</p><p>Steve\ndidn\u2019t sound exactly angry, more like <i>grossed</i> out. Breath\nshaking, you stood up and turned away from him.</p><p>\u201cIs\nit because we\u2019re both males?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot it. I do realized that the twenty first century is way more\naccepting than the forties were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nwhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked away as you built up the courage to search for eye contact. He\ncleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. The \u2026 the notion that you\nand Bucky could -\u201d</p><p>Your\nthroat closed up and you turned away again as you pressed one hand to\nyour mouth, forcing down a whimper. That <i>hurt</i>. Even though\nSteve didn\u2019t finish.</p><p>Did\nhe think you didn\u2019t deserve to be with someone? With his best\nfriend of all people? Was it the HYDRA-thing? The fact you were male,\nthough Steve said it wasn\u2019t? The fact you were a five-year-old in a\ntwenty-something-body? The fact you still struggled with basic things\nin society? You had discovered your own libido and the whole concept\nof sex only yesterday, for god\u2019s sake!</p><p>You\nspoke before you wouldn\u2019t be able to anymore. \u201cPlease go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\nI didn\u2019t mean -\u201d</p><p>Steve\nsnapped his mouth shut, <i>thankfully</i>, when you shook your head.\n\u201cNo, I see. I shouldn\u2019t have told you, it only freaks you out.\u201d\nA broken sob escaped before you could hold it back. \u201cJust <i>go.</i>\u201d</p><p>For\nonce, Steve did what he was told. The door slammed shut behind him.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After\ncrying for too long and falling asleep on the couch, you woke up a\nfew hours later to an aching body due to an uncomfortable position,\nswollen eyes and a dry throat. Groggily, you made your way to the\nkitchen sink, grabbing a glass to fill with water. You downed it in\none go, just to fill it again.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nY/N?\u201d God, F.R.I.D.A.Y. still sounded so caring, and you promptly\nfelt like crying again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\ntime is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwill turn half past three in the morning in exactly four minutes.\u201d</p><p>Your\nsigh got drowned out by the rumbling in your stomach, indicating the\nlack of food in the past hours. Even though you knew better, you\nopened your own fridge anyway, hoping, <i>praying</i>, that it would\ncontain something you could eat. Of course there wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIs\nsomeone in the communal kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nappears not so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nabout food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty\nof it. Boss had shawarma delivered to the compound.\u201d</p><p>Well,\nthat didn\u2019t sound too bad. Carefully, you made your way to the\ncommunal kitchen, planning to just sneak some leftover shawarma and\nheating it up at your own place.</p><p>Even\nthough it was the middle of the night, the chance of meeting someone\nwas high. Tony tended to stay in the lab longer than any other person\nwould be able to, so it wasn\u2019t unusual to find him in the kitchen\nat any time, brewing himself some coffee. Everyone on the team had\nnightmares from time to time, and if someone couldn\u2019t sleep after\nthem, they got some food, or something to drink, or stayed in the\ncommon room to watch TV on a bigger screen and a less lonely feeling\narea. Clint always craved food, Vision wasn\u2019t sleeping at all and\nyou once caught him phasing through walls and the ground to his\nheart\u2019s content.</p><p>So,\nthe chance of meeting <i>nobody</i> was slim, and of course you\ndidn\u2019t had any luck today. F.R.I.D.A.Y. had barely finished\ninforming you that \u201cMr. Barnes is making his way to the kitchen,\u201d\nthat the good assassin turned the corner, halting in his steps when\nhe saw you.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nhey,\u201d he said, smiling softly, <i>smiling softly,</i> as he stepped\nnext to you to retrieve a cup out of the cupboard. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nfine,\u201d you answered quietly, going back to shoveling shawarma onto\na plate.</p><p>Bucky\nstudied your face, then turned away to place his mug under the coffee\nmaker. \u201cWhy were you crying?\u201d</p><p>You\nfroze. \u201cHow -\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\neyes are a bit puffy.\u201d</p><p>Of\ncourse. Your entire form slumped in on itself. \u201cSteve, uh, visited\nme. Wanted to know why I, um, fled the gym.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nhummed. \u201cStubborn punk. Didn\u2019t wanna hear a thing about letting\nyou come out of your own. What did he say to make you cry?\u201d</p><p>Being\nwith Bucky was easy, you had known this early on. Even now it seemed\nso much easier to tell Bucky everything than it was with Steve, even\nthough it concerned Bucky. But Bucky was patient, eyes holding no\njudgment as they regarded you, even though you closed and opened your\nmouth again and again without actually saying something. He smiled\nagain.</p><p>\u201cYou\nwanna have a hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\nsit down, doll.\u201d</p><p>You\ndid as you were told, sat down and only a few minutes later, Bucky\nset down a steaming mug with hot chocolate in front of you, all with\nwhipped cream and cocoa powder on top. He sat down right next to you,\nnodding as you thanked him.</p><p>Blowing\non the liquid to cool it down a bit, you took your first sip. It\nreally tasted good, and after you lowered your mug back down, you\nkind of just blurted, \u201cI really like you, Bucky!\u201d</p><p>Hand\nstilling, Bucky stopped short of setting his own mug to his lips to\ntake a sip. But you didn\u2019t give him any opportunity to react.</p><p>\u201cMany,\n<i>so many </i>things are super confusing here, and I struggled many\ntimes. But you made everything just easy. It is easy to talk to you,\nit is easy to understand and accept myself when I\u2019m with you. What\n\u2026 what happened in the gym, did you \u2026 did you notice?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\npuffed, cheeks gaining color distinctly. \u201cWell, it\u2019s been hard\nnot to.\u201d</p><p>You\nstared at him dumbfounded, and he grinned, teeth showing as he cocked\nhis head to the side. \u201cGood pun, huh?\u201d</p><p>Your\nlips twitched into a watery smile. \u201cI told Steve that I like you.\nHe \u2026 he looked at me like I was crazy.\u201d</p><p>The\ncorners of your lips dropped down, Bucky grimaced, but he did take\nyour hand laying on the table top, embracing your shaking fingers\nwith his own.</p><p>\u201cI\ntold him that I didn\u2019t plan this; I didn\u2019t even know what was\ngoing on, it just happened! Then I asked him what was wrong, why he\nbecame so <i>grossed out,</i> and he just said, said that the mere\n<i>notion</i> of us two- I- he \u2026 he said he couldn\u2019t believe it.\nAnd he had his stupid \u2018Captain-America\u2019-face.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\nsighed, giving your hand a quick squeeze. \u201cSteve, you goddamn\nidiot,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAlright, Y/N, nobody plans anything when it\ncomes to feelings, okay? As you said, they just happen, and no normal\nhuman being, not even Steve, who, to be exact is no normal human\nbeing, can control them. You are not a freak or something like that\nbecause you have feelings.

Enjoy! <b>&#128149;</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>The\nthought of the Avengers being a threat to the world was hammered into\nyour head since the day you were born. July 4<sup>th</sup>,\nironically, did you open your eyes for the first time, and it wasn&rsquo;t\neven strange for you that you had the body of a seventeen years old,\nwhile only being alive for a few minutes.</p><p>It\nwasn&rsquo;t strange that you had to learn the most most basic like\nreading and writing, all while already being able to use every weapon\navailable, lifting tons of weight without breaking a sweat, and when\nyou were one week old, you had outmatched the best fighter in\nhand-to-hand combat HYDRA could find.</p><p>Though,\nlike every time HYDRA seemed to make one step closer to their\nultimate goal &ndash; to conquer the world &ndash; the Avengers were right\nbehind them.</p><p>And\nwith them were Steven Grant Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>When\nyou were looking at Steven Grant Rogers, it was a bit like looking\ninto a mirror. Although you didn&rsquo;t look exactly the same as him,\nthere was a striking resemblance.</p><p>You\nslightly leaned to the side, catching a glance at the figure standing\nin the doorway. The metal arm was anything you needed to see to know\nthat this was indeed the Winter Soldier. Slowly, you leaned back,\nstaring once again into the perfect baby blues of Captain America.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nkicked in my door.&rdquo;</p><p>For\na short moment, Steve looked at a loss of words, lips parted in\nconfusion. Bucky laughed, trying to cover it up as he cleared his\nthroat, giving a little cough.</p><p>&ldquo;I,\nuh, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>HYDRA\ndidn&rsquo;t set great values on moral and right social behaviors. All\nyou had learned were the things you had read in books one of the nice\nscientists had given to you. You blinked.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nguess it is fine, then.&rdquo; You finally closed the book you had been\nreading before you had unexpected visitors. Then you rose from the\nsitting position on your bed, now towering over Steve, who had been\ncrouching in front of you to be on your height. Gracefully, you\nside-stepped him, sauntering over to the only cabinet in the room to\nput back your book.</p><p>&ldquo;Do\nyou know who we are? Why we are here?&rdquo;</p><p>This\nwas Bucky talking. You hummed before answering his question, starting\nto gather other books in your arms.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nare the Avengers. Well, part of them; Captain America and former\nHYDRA assassin the Winter Soldier. Highest threat level.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nstood up, walking right in front of the Winter Soldier, this time\npeering over his shoulder. A few bodies were lying in the hallway.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nam not dumb. This HYDRA base has surely fallen. The question is, are\nyou gonna kill me like you did the other agents, or are you gonna\ncapture me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re\nnot going to kill you,&rdquo; said Steve. You looked back at him.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nthe latter then.&rdquo; Dropping your head, you intently studied the\ncover of the book lying on top. &ldquo;Do you think I can bring these?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>As\nit turned out, there was so much you didn&rsquo;t know about the world.</p><p>First\nof all, you could bring your books. That was nice. Just as nice as\nthe room you got at the Avengers Compound, apparently the place you\nwere going to live for now on.</p><p>Secondly,\nyou were never registered as &hellip; well, as a person living on this\nworld, so you couldn&rsquo;t be charged guilty for the things <strike>you\ndid</strike> HYDRA\nmade you do.</p><p>Thirdly,\nother kids had parents,\nand they are responsible for them until they are of age, meaning\neighteen years old. Technically,\nyou were four years old, a toddler, you had learned. You\nweren&rsquo;t supposed to be as\ntall as Thor and have arm\nwrestling matches with the Winter Soldier you were able to win.</p><p>According\nto the law, you were to be assigned a guardian, and your medical\nexamination when you first had set foot\nonto the Avengers Compound, which included a DNA\ntest, brought\nsurprising results.</p><p>&ldquo;So,\nhe&rsquo;s my father then?&rdquo;</p><p>Dr.\nBanner, <i>Bruce,</i> as he insisted\nyou to call him (he didn&rsquo;t like Hulky very much), shook\nhis head, still looking at the hologram showing the results.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nam not sure how to call it, to be honest. Based on the file the\nothers found in the base, your embryo grew in vitro,\nthen they continued the growth in some kind of chamber, similar to\nthe cryo\nchambers, until\nthey seemed you fit to be &hellip; born, I guess.</p><p>&ldquo;The\npoint is, you weren&rsquo;t born in the way it normally happens, and I\ndon&rsquo;t think you have to see him as a father. HYDRA just borrowed\nsome of his DNA. The parts effected by the super soldier serum, to be\nexact.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brothers?&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce\nnodded, a bit distracted as he wasn&rsquo;t able to look away from your\ntest results. &ldquo;Maybe more like that, I don&rsquo;t know. More\nimportant, though, is that you don&rsquo;t have to see him as anything.\nYou don&rsquo;t even have to talk to him if you do not want to. It&rsquo;s\nall up to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p><p>Now,\nBruce finally looked at you, giving you a shy smile. &ldquo;I understand\nif you&rsquo;re a bit overwhelmed of the whole situation, but everything\nwill settle in a few days or weeks time. Don&rsquo;t worry. If you need\nhelp you can come to any of us, or ask F.R.I.D.A.Y.&rdquo;</p><p>You\ntried to return his smile. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\ngonna find back to your room on your own?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;\nThough, it was more like an entire apartment than a simple room.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course.\nDinner is at half past eight. If you want to join us. Today&rsquo;s one\nof the few days were everyone can attend, but you don&rsquo;t have to\nfeel obligated to show up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>It\nhad just turned eight o&rsquo;clock, and you picked up the remote to\npress the necessary button to have Netflix go to the next episode of\nBrooklyn 99 without having to wait five seconds. Your hand dropped\nback to your side, landing on the <i>incredible</i> soft blanket you\nhad thrown over your legs, tucking the end under your feet.</p><p>The\nblanket was really soft, like, <i>really</i> soft. You had asked\nF.R.I.D.A.Y., who said it was something called cashmere. Once again,\nyou lifted the corner of it to your face, letting it glide over your\ncheek to relish in its softness.</p><p>A\nsmall chuckle escaped you as you watched Boyle pouring hot coffee all\nover himself and under his bandages, your hands lowering back down so\nyou could keep gliding your finger tips over the fabric.</p><p>However,\nwhen Steve entered your <strike>room</strike> apartment, two plates\nfilled with food in his hands, he found the couch empty, the blanket\ndiscarded over the back of it, while the TV still played your show.</p><p>Steve\nset down the plates on the coffee table. &ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; he called out,\nturning to look over the apartment. Only after a few seconds did you\nstep out of the corner you were hiding in, shooting Steve an\nindefinable look.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;\nSteve said. &ldquo;I, uh, I took the liberty of having F.R.I.D.A.Y. open\nthe door for me.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nstared at him, eyes flickering to the plates on the coffee table and\nthe steam rising from the hot food. &ldquo;You could have just let her\nask me to open it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,\nyes, I am sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nstartled me, and I panicked a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,\nI am sorry, I just &hellip; wanted to eat dinner with you. And maybe talk\na bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;\nyou said, &ldquo;okay. I am not really hungry, though.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nsmiled. &ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nnodded, sitting back down on the couch next to your blanket, and\naccepted the plate Steve offered you.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nthis?&rdquo; you asked, digging your fork into &hellip; you didn&rsquo;t know what\nit was. It crushed under the force, revealing a filling of what you\nassumed were vegetables.</p><p>&ldquo;Spring\nrolls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;\nyou said, still having no clue what Steve brought you.</p><p>He\nonly chuckled. &ldquo;Just try it. They&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If\nyou say so.&rdquo; You lifted the fork to your mouth, sniffing at the\nfood first before trying it. The pastry crunched in your mouth, the\nvegetables were soft.</p><p>Steve\nlooked at you expectantly. You tried a small smile and nodded. &ldquo;It\ntastes good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo;\nhe said, picking up his own meal. It was silent for a short time,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had been so polite to pause the current episode, and you\nwatched Steve while munching on your spring rolls.</p><p>&ldquo;Is\nthis about your DNA?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nchoked a bit on his food, face turning red as he coughed. &ldquo;I-\nwhat?&rdquo;</p><p>You\ncould hear his heart thumping even faster in his chest than before,\nand the blush didn&rsquo;t subside.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nasked if this is about your DNA. Bruce surely must have told you that\nHYDRA used your DNA to create me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh\n&hellip;&rdquo; Steve looked to the side and set his plate down. &ldquo;Yes, it\nmay be. Bruce- I- yes, Bruce told me about it. He also told me that &hellip;\nthat you asked if I would be your father now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fathers\nand sons share the same DNA. But Bruce also said that brothers share\nthe same DNA. However it is up to me how I see you.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nnodded. The red color on his skin had faded a bit. &ldquo;Of course.\nNobody&rsquo;s going to tell you what to do. You see, when I woke up in\nthis century, I knew nothing about this world. Everything had changed\nand I would have been lost without the team.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow that you have been alive for only a few years to begin with <i>and</i>\nlived in isolation. I just wanted you to know that you have me if you\nneed help, <i>like</i> a brother. If you want.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nwatched Steve, eyes straight on staring into his (which didn&rsquo;t\ntotally unnerved him). &ldquo;So, like a big brother helping his little\nbrother. I saw about this in some show.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nchuckled. &ldquo;Yeah, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,\nbig bro, wanna watch some Brooklyn 99 while eating spring rolls?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nhe laughed, picking up his own food to continue eating. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nBrooklyn 99?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just\nwatch it,&rdquo; you said, mimicking Steve&rsquo;s words from earlier. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\ngood.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br />When\nyou befriend Steve Rogers, you automatically have to befriend Bucky\nBarnes &ndash; or have to put up with him even if you don&rsquo;t like him.\nFortunately, it was the former for you (unlike Sam; though you\nweren&rsquo;t sure if Sam really hated Bucky or the other way around;\nthey were bantering, like siblings, you had thought).</p><p>You\nknew that Bucky had been with HYDRA for a long time, not voluntarily.\nHowever, you always had thought you were kind of connected. You liked\nit when Bucky was around. He didn&rsquo;t say much, but he was a calming\npresence, making everything &ndash; adjusting, and learning, and\ninteracting with other people - seem easier. You had talked a few\ntimes with him about HYDRA, about his time there, even though Bucky&rsquo;s\nexperience was much different, with the whole being tortured and\ntaken apart and remade.</p><p>Nevertheless,\nit was good to talk with someone about HYDRA and your own\nexperiences. Steve was always there for you, of course, but after a\nfew months you realized that every person on the team had a few\ntopics you could talk to them about and a few topics you rather not\ntalk to them about.</p><p>And\nsometimes you liked to imagine that Bucky might like talking to you,\ntoo.<br /><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>It\nonly took Bucky a few seconds to open his door, revealing you with\nyour blanket in your hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nBucky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nY/N,&rdquo; Bucky greeted back. &ldquo;Steve ain&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nI know, he&rsquo;s in the gym. Can I come in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.\nDid somethin&rsquo; happen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?\nOh, no. Just wanted some company.&rdquo; You stopped in your tracks,\nlooking back at Bucky while he was closing the door. &ldquo;Am I\nintrusive? Bruce said it is fine to seek company of the people you\nlike.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,\nno, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Bucky chuckled a bit, following you into the\nliving room area. &ldquo;You always carry that blanket with ya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.\nIt&rsquo;s soft.&rdquo; You sat and patted the space on the couch next to\nyou, telling Bucky to sit down with you. Without another word, you\npicked up the blanket and arranged it that both you and Bucky were\nwrapped in its fluffiness.&rdquo;Didn&rsquo;t had much soft things while\nbeing with HYDRA.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky\nwiggled a bit in his place, getting comfortable as he settled in,\nyour shoulders touching. &ldquo;Yeah, know whatcha mean. When I came here\nfirst, everything was bright and soft and nice. Didn&rsquo;t think I\ndeserved that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause\nof the things HYDRA made you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.\nI just didn&rsquo;t think of it that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We\ndeserve nice things. That&rsquo;s what Steve always says, but I am not so\nsure about that.&rdquo; You turned your head, looking at Bucky.\n&ldquo;Interacting with people is hard,&rdquo; you said, studying Bucky&rsquo;s\ncalm eyes. &ldquo;Knowing how they feel and acting appropriately is\nhard.&rdquo; Gaze lowering down on your hands, you began petting the\nblanket.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S\nalright,&rdquo; Bucky said, &ldquo;it really is hard sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nnodded, contemplating if you should tell Bucky that it never was hard\nwith him, and that you liked it, but then decided against it.</p><p>Bucky\nsmiled, just as soft as the blanket, and it made you feel warm over &ndash;\nit was confusing. But you smiled back, even laughing when he bumped\nhis shoulder with yours. But you sobered up quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow that- I know HYDRA made me because they wanted another weapon\nlike you. I was trained, and trained, and trained every day, and even\nthough I rarely got tired, I <i>am</i> tired of it. You know what I\nmean?&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky\nnodded, letting you talk.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nkept up the routine because I didn&rsquo;t know what else to do, but I\ndecided to just &hellip; stop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nokay.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nhummed, sinking further into the cushions. Everything was okay,\nalways okay. There were still so much thinks making life not okay at\nthe moment, but &ndash; unsurprisingly by now, you thought &ndash; with Bucky\nthis fact didn&rsquo;t seem so important anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nthink I need a nap.&rdquo; You sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Lay\ndown, doll,&rdquo; Bucky said, grabbing the blanket and the pillow to put\nit in his lap. After you laid down, he threw the blanket over your\nform, letting you snuggle into it.</p><p>Being\nwith Bucky was easy.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>It\nwas in times like these where you felt lonely.</p><p>After\nlearning the concept of two people being more than friends, <i>loving\neach other,</i> you also learned the concept of feeling lonely.</p><p>You\nshould really stop watching these films, and movies, and reading\nbooks. Love stories weren&rsquo;t good. It made you crave things.\nCloseness, <i>proximity,</i> human touch, hugs, <i>kisses, Bu-</i></p><p>Your\neyes widened and you frantically grabbed for the remote, shutting off\nthe TV before the two guys in the movie could get back to their\nkissing.</p><p>It\nwas now pitch black, the only light in the room having come from the\nTV. You reached for another pillow, hugging it to your upper body.</p><p>Your\nchest hurt.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>It\nhad been nearly a year since you joined the team when you realized\nthat you actively sought out Bucky&rsquo;s company. You had asked Steve\nif he could switch places with you at dinner so you could sit between\nboth him and Bucky. At movie nights you continued to share your\nblanket with Bucky, and every second day you would join him for a\nmorning run.</p><p>Today,\neven though you said you would stop training, having too much the\nfeeling of continuing what HYDRA had started, you found yourself in\nthe gym, watching Bucky and Sam spar.</p><p>It\nwas hilarious, to say the least. Sam clearly had troubles getting the\nupper hand, a fact that didn&rsquo;t surprise you; he was sparing with a\nsuper-soldier, and in real battles he had the advantage of his Falcon\nwings. Still, it was funny to watch him try, and the bantering\nbetween him and Bucky just added to the fun.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,\nokay, I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; Sam said, words clipped as he panted for breath,\nlying on his back after Bucky had slammed him onto the mat. You\nlaughed at the expression on his face, knowing his face would be beet\nred if his skin were brighter. Though, Sam didn&rsquo;t think it to be\nfunny and he glared at you as he rolled to his side, scrambling to\nget up.</p><p>&ldquo;How\nabout you fight a super soldier for two hours?&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky\nlooked at you, the wide smile on his face narrowing a bit as he saw\nyou contemplating it. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t wanna, Y/N, you don&rsquo;t have\nto,&rdquo; he said, but you shook your head, standing up.</p><p>&ldquo;No,\nno, it&rsquo;s fine. Made to be a super soldier myself, remember? You&rsquo;re\nnothing I couldn&rsquo;t take on. Besides, it&rsquo;s just for fun, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;\nBucky said, full smile returning. &ldquo;Maybe this will be some kind of\na challenge for once.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam\nscoffed, but you didn&rsquo;t mind it over the feel of excitement rushing\nthrough you as you stepped onto the mat, right in front of Bucky who\ngot back into his fighting stance.</p><p>For\na few seconds, nothing happened, then Bucky charged at you.\nInstinctively, you sidestepped him, grabbing his shoulder and arm as\nyou stood beside him to yank his upper body back while simultaneously\nkicking his feet from under him. He landed on his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,\nwow, that was just you going easy on the kid!&rdquo; Sam complained.\nBucky laughed, getting back on his feet without effort.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo;\nhe retorted. &ldquo;Cannot go full Winter Soldier from the beginning on.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nsmiled, brightly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Bucky. As I said earlier: Nothing\nI can&rsquo;t handle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now\nyou&rsquo;re just a cocky little shit.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughing,\nyou blocked Bucky&rsquo;s next attempt at striking out at you, but he\nhadn&rsquo;t been kidding when he said he wouldn&rsquo;t go easy on you next\ntime. It was getting harder and harder to elude Bucky&rsquo;s attacks and\nget in a few of your own. Even with all the getting frozen Bucky had\na few more years of training under his belt than you, after all. And\nbefore you knew it, it was now you the one who was getting punched\ninto the mat, but that didn&rsquo;t mean it was over, yet. If you were\ngetting down Bucky was getting down with you, and the expression of\nutter surprise on his face when you latched onto his shirt to pull\nhim down with you was worth the several pounds of beefy super soldier\nslamming into you, all with metal arm digging into your ribs.</p><p>Originally,\nyou had planned to bring Bucky down with and off of you in one fluid\nmotion, getting back on your feet in an instance, but somehow your\nbrain just stopped working as soon as Bucky&rsquo;s face got (unplanned)\nclose enough to easily bridge over the last few inches and press your\nlips to -</p><p>Bucky\nhuffed on top of you, the warm air hitting your face as his eyes\nbored into yours. Strands of soft brown hair were falling out of his\nhair tie, tickling your cheek. Warmth began to spread throughout your\nwhole body, gathering deep in the pit of your stomach as you\nliterally felt the blood rushing downwards. Only now did you realize\nthat one of Bucky&rsquo;s (very muscular) thighs was pressing down on\nyour crotch, making you ache all over in a bittersweet way, but you\nwere unable to pinpoint why exactly.</p><p>Carefully,\nyou pried your fingers out of their death grip on Bucky&rsquo;s shirt,\neyes darting down to Bucky&rsquo;s mouth as his tongue slipped out to\nlick away the sweat that had gathered on the curve of his upper lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Are\nyou guys okay? You&rsquo;re just laying down there.&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;s voice\nsounded concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;\nMuscles shifting, Bucky lifted himself up. Still crouching but back\non his feet, he held out a hand to help you back on your own. You\ntook it, the touch sending a pleasant tingle to mix with the warmth\nin your entire body.</p><p>Uncomfortable\nsilence. Your ears buzzed, and you all were standing there like\nidiots until the doors opened, the sound filling the entire room. You\nflinched violently, which in turn startled Bucky and he took a step\nforward, as if he would want to comfort you. Steve stepped into the\ngym.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nguys, F.R.I.D.A.Y. told me you were down- oh, Y/N, what are you doing\non the mat? I thought you didn&rsquo;t want to fight anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>You\nlooked at Steve like a deer caught in headlights, not knowing what to\nsay.</p><p>&ldquo;I,\nuh, I- sorry, I don&rsquo;t know I &hellip; I-I need to go.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nshot his friends a questioning look after he watched you practically\nflee the whole scene. Sam shrugged his shoulders, Bucky looked to the\nside, trying not to think of the horrified expression on your face\nand, most importantly, the hard line of your dick against his thigh.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br />You\nstumbled into your apartment, the door falling shut behind you with a\ndull sound. Feeling hot all over, you quickly pulled your top over\nyour head, carelessly tossing it to the floor. Nearly smashing the\nlight switch in the bathroom as you hurried to the sink, you quickly\nsplashed freezing water onto your face.</p><p>Panting,\nyou studied your face in the mirror, watching droplets of water\ntrickle down the sides of your face. Unconsciously, you pressed your\ncrotch against the sink, a muffled moan sounding.</p><p>&ldquo;God,\nwhat is wrong with me?&rdquo; Of course, no one answered, as no one was\nthere with you. You felt like crying, and you never had cried before;\nYou were overwhelmed with the situation, not knowing what to do or\nwhat happened right now. Your body still felt hot, still was aching,\nand the pressure against your crotch relieved and fueled the burning\nat the same time.</p><p>In\nan impromptu decision, you stripped out of the rest of your clothes,\nmoving to stand under the shower. The cold water did little to calm\nyou down, though. Your skin may have felt cool to the touch now, but\nthere was still the heat pooling in your belly, and you finally\nallowed yourself to look down your body.</p><p>Your\ndick definitely was bigger than usual, standing from your body in an\nangle. You swallowed, bringing up your hand to touch it carefully. It\ntwitched at the contact, making your breath hitch. Then you wrapped\nyour fingers fully around it, and you were able to feel the pulsing\nof blood. Your ache grew, the heat in your belly flared like actual\nflames, and your cock hardened even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo;\nyou swore, biting your lip as you began to slide your hard length in\nand out of the grip of your fingers, the water easing the way. It\nwasn&rsquo;t enough, not nearly, but it also felt <i>so</i> good. You\nleaned on the wall, back of your head pressed against the tiles as\nyou thrusted into your fist with a steady rhythm. Your other hand\ngrabbed blindly for the water faucet, fumbling to have the water turn\nwarm instead of cold.</p><p>You\ndidn&rsquo;t know how much time passed while you stood under the warm\nwater spray, the occasional sigh leaving your lips, stroking your\ncock until it became too hard for you to be standing. With trembling\nlegs you lowered yourself to the ground, opening your eyes without\nhaving realized that you had closed them in the first place.</p><p>Gasping,\nyou blinked the water out of your face, just as your hips bucked up\ninvoluntarily. A clear fluid had oozed from the tip of your cock.\nExperimentally, you smeared your thumb over it, moaning softly at the\nsensation. You continued this, massaging the head while your other\nhand stroke the length of your dick.</p><p>Suddenly,\nyour breathing pattern picked up, small moans forced their way out of\nyour throat, actual tears gathered in your eyes. The ache in your\nbody built up, every touch grew more and more intense, and you could\nfeel a tingle in your balls, just as another fluid shot out of the\ntip of your cock. White decorated your thighs as ribbon after ribbon\npumped itself out of your length, making your eyes roll back into\nyour head while your body trembled all over from the intense pleasure\nraking through you.</p><p>Panting,\nyou let your hands drop to your sides, your cock feeling too\nsensitive to be touching it anymore. The great feeling of finally\nhaving satisfied the ache passed, taking the pleasure and warmth with\nit.</p><p>You\nshivered out of entirely different reasons now, and pulled yourself\nback on your feet. Sniffling, you took hold of the shower head,\nwashing off the last remains of the white fluid before leaning\nagainst the wall again.</p><p>What\nhad this been? It had felt good, <i>so good,</i> but now you just\nfelt empty, all while salty tears mingled with the water drops on\nyour cheeks.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>You\ndidn&rsquo;t knew it was possible for an AI to actually sound this\ncaring, only by calling someone&rsquo;s name as well. F.R.I.D.A.Y. did\nsound caring, voice gentle and quiet as to not disturb the silence\nyou had engulfed in for the past or so hour too harshly. She was\npatient, waiting for your answer as you were taking your time (a\nquite generous amount of time).</p><p>After\nyou had emerged from the shower and dried yourself up, you had put on\nthe softest clothes you could find in the closet and burried yourself\nin your favorite blanket on your bed, along with all the pillows you\nhad. You had just laid there, cozy and warm, while you drifted in and\nout of a state where you were able to think about nothing. For the\nrest, your thoughts were a mess. You thought about Bucky, about the &hellip;\nthe thing in the gym, and <i>whatever</i> happened afterwards;\nsomething you didn&rsquo;t know what to think of.</p><p>It\nwas easier to just bury yourself away, so you did just that.</p><p>Anyways,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had called out and was waiting for an answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;\nYour voice was small, just as quiet as hers had been.</p><p>&ldquo;Are\nyou alright?&rdquo;</p><p>You\nblinked, not having expected a question like that. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;I- something happened, and I don&rsquo;t really\nhave an idea what exactly. But I guess I am not feeling particularly\ngood.&rdquo;</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\ndid something that sounded a bit like humming. &ldquo;Is there anything I\ncan do to help you?&rdquo;</p><p>The\nsheets rustled as you shifted in the bed, thinking about how to\nexpress your request. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really get to go through\npuberty,&rdquo; you said, feeling your face heating up already, even\nthough you knew F.R.I.D.A.Y. would be the last to judge you. &rdquo;To be\nhonest, I didn&rsquo;t give it much thought before and the others, and\nme, didn&rsquo;t think it was necessary. But I fear I missed some\naspects, important aspects.&rdquo;</p><p>Now,\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. sounded like she was smiling, or rather would be if she\nwas human, when she talked. &ldquo;Well, the Internet has been used to\nask and answer many question concerning puberty; I am sure we will\nfind the answers you need.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall\nwe start immediately?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;\nYou sat up, stretching your whole body from the curled in position it\nhad been in. &ldquo;Just &hellip; I don&rsquo;t think the others should now about\nit. I would appreciate it if -&rdquo;</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\ncut in before you could finish. &ldquo;You do not need to worry, Y/N,\nevery conversation between you and me will be discrete, which can\nonly be abolished by certain circumstances and protocols only a few\nselected persons have access to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank\nyou.&rdquo; You smiled, and as if she was smiling back, F.R.I.D.A.Y.\npulled up a holograph, waiting for you to state your first question.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>Steve&rsquo;s\nconcern reached a breaking point when you didn&rsquo;t even show up for\ndinner the following day. He ignored Bucky telling him he should\nstill give you space, ignored also Sam and even Tony, who defended\nhis AI as F.R.I.D.A.Y. refused multiple times to tell him more about\nyou other than that you were fine on your own for the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\ngo and check up on him,&rdquo; Steve said as soon as he swallowed his\nlast mouthful of food, standing up and pushing back his chair.</p><p>Bucky\njust rolled his eyes, Sam shot him an exasperated look, but didn&rsquo;t\nsay anything, both knowing better than anyone that it was pointless\nto argue with this stubborn bullhead.</p><p>The\nteam watched Steve as he left the room. In a few minutes, he reached\nyour room, pushing down the door handle. The door didn&rsquo;t budge,\nthough.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y.\n-&rdquo; he started, but she was quick to interrupt him.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N\nhas been informed that you are waiting for him. It is advised to not\nenter his rooms without his consent.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nnodded, clearing his throat as he remembered the first time he barged\nin without announcing himself. That was a trait he really should\ndeposit. His patience was short-lived, but fortunately, Steve didn&rsquo;t\nhave to wait long before you answered the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nSteve.&rdquo;</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y.\nhad told you as soon as Steve made his way up, and it wasn&rsquo;t like\nyou didn&rsquo;t expect Steve to come see you after your sudden\ndisappearing yesterday; you still had hoped for him leaving you alone\nfor a bit longer.</p><p>Though\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. had also told you, she wouldn&rsquo;t let Steve in if you\ndidn&rsquo;t want to, you answered the door for yourself, knowing that\nyou were only deferring the inevitable.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;\nSteve looked relieved as you opened the door, posture relaxing. &ldquo;Can\nI come in?&rdquo;</p><p>You\nwanted to say no, you really wanted, but in the end, you opened the\ndoor further, allowing Steve to step in. He followed you to the\ncouch, sitting down next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky\nand Sam didn&rsquo;t wanna tell me what exactly happened in the gym.&rdquo;</p><p>He\ndidn&rsquo;t exactly asked for it, but it was clear that Steve wanted <i>you</i>\nto tell him. You sighed, not looking at him but instead trained your\neyes on the remote laying on the coffee table.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing\nhappened,&rdquo; you began, crossing your legs, &ldquo;well, I mean nothing\nbad happened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nhiding here for a day now, Y/N, something bad <i>must</i> have\nhappened.&rdquo;</p><p>God,\nSteve was famous for his &lsquo;Captain-America-is-disapproving&rsquo;-voice\nand his &lsquo;Captain-America-is-disapproving&rsquo;-face and now it was all\ndirected at you.</p><p>You\nsighed, sagging against the arm rest as you started playing with the\nhem at the end of your pants. &ldquo;I &hellip; We were just sparring, okay?\nAt first, I was just watching Sam and Bucky, because, you know, it is\nreally entertaining, and then Sam meant that if I could be laughing\nat him, I might as well spar with Bucky myself, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nlooked like he wanted to interrupt, but you didn&rsquo;t let him.</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas all okay, Bucky made sure I&rsquo;d know I didn&rsquo;t have to because I\nsaid before I didn&rsquo;t wanna fight anymore, but it was all okay; it\nwas supposed to be fun. And it was fun, I was excited to see how I\nwould do against the famous Winter Soldier. However, &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You\nfaltered, thinking back on your enlightening research with\nF.R.I.D.A.Y., which made you think you know now what exactly\nhappened. You knew how to put it in words, but you also learned that\na topic like this was intimate, not something you share with\neverybody. Furthermore, it also included Bucky, and Bucky was Steve&rsquo;s\nbest friend, and it was clear to everyone that Steve was hella\nprotective of Bucky, and while you thought you and Steve grew close\nas well, that he cared for you as well (which kind of got confirmed\nwith his showing up here), you did not feel exactly confident saying\nwhat you found out about yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Did\nBucky hurt you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!\nNo, no. I threw him on the mat, he threw me on the mat, nothing\nunexpected when you&rsquo;re sparing. It was just &hellip; what was unexpected\nwas -&rdquo;</p><p>You\ndid look up, gazing at Steve as you struggled to say what you\napparently had to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve,\nyou said I could come to you whatever I am worrying about or have\nproblems with.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s\nfacial expression softened. &ldquo;Of course you can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Promise\nme you won&rsquo;t be angry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now\nyou&rsquo;re worrying me a bit.&rdquo; Steve chuckled lightly, but even\nthough you could give a shaky smile back, it did nothing to ease you\nup. You looked down into your lap again, forcing the words out.</p><p>&ldquo;During\nsparring, Bucky landed on top of me, and &hellip; and m-my body had a very\nconfusing reaction. Everything was so <i>damn</i> overwhelming and\nthen suddenly you came in and asked what I was even doing there and I\njust -&rdquo; you choked out the last word &ldquo;- panicked.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nlooked at you with wide eyes, expression just short of dread. &ldquo;What\ndo you mean your body had a reaction?&rdquo;</p><p>A\nlump formed in your throat rapidly. &ldquo;I think I am attracted to\nBucky. A-also sexually.&rdquo;</p><p>Deafening\nsilence.</p><p>&ldquo;It\njust happened,&rdquo; you frantically continued, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to!\nAt first I didn&rsquo;t even know what was happening, I got confused and\njust had to get out of there!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nsighed as you finished, leaning forward to support his head in his\nhands with his elbows resting on his knees. &ldquo;I cannot believe\nthis.&rdquo;</p><p>His\nwords were only muttered, barely understandable, but they made your\neyes water. <i>Again.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You\npromised to not be angry,&rdquo; you whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nam not angry.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\ndidn&rsquo;t sound exactly angry, more like <i>grossed</i> out. Breath\nshaking, you stood up and turned away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Is\nit because we&rsquo;re both males?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nnot it. I do realized that the twenty first century is way more\naccepting than the forties were.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then\nwhat&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nlooked away as you built up the courage to search for eye contact. He\ncleared his throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. The &hellip; the notion that you\nand Bucky could -&rdquo;</p><p>Your\nthroat closed up and you turned away again as you pressed one hand to\nyour mouth, forcing down a whimper. That <i>hurt</i>. Even though\nSteve didn&rsquo;t finish.</p><p>Did\nhe think you didn&rsquo;t deserve to be with someone? With his best\nfriend of all people? Was it the HYDRA-thing? The fact you were male,\nthough Steve said it wasn&rsquo;t? The fact you were a five-year-old in a\ntwenty-something-body? The fact you still struggled with basic things\nin society? You had discovered your own libido and the whole concept\nof sex only yesterday, for god&rsquo;s sake!</p><p>You\nspoke before you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to anymore. &ldquo;Please go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,\nI didn&rsquo;t mean -&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nsnapped his mouth shut, <i>thankfully</i>, when you shook your head.\n&ldquo;No, I see. I shouldn&rsquo;t have told you, it only freaks you out.&rdquo;\nA broken sob escaped before you could hold it back. &ldquo;Just <i>go.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>For\nonce, Steve did what he was told. The door slammed shut behind him.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>After\ncrying for too long and falling asleep on the couch, you woke up a\nfew hours later to an aching body due to an uncomfortable position,\nswollen eyes and a dry throat. Groggily, you made your way to the\nkitchen sink, grabbing a glass to fill with water. You downed it in\none go, just to fill it again.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y.?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nY/N?&rdquo; God, F.R.I.D.A.Y. still sounded so caring, and you promptly\nfelt like crying again.</p><p>&ldquo;What\ntime is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwill turn half past three in the morning in exactly four minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>Your\nsigh got drowned out by the rumbling in your stomach, indicating the\nlack of food in the past hours. Even though you knew better, you\nopened your own fridge anyway, hoping, <i>praying</i>, that it would\ncontain something you could eat. Of course there wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Is\nsomeone in the communal kitchen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nappears not so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What\nabout food?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Plenty\nof it. Boss had shawarma delivered to the compound.&rdquo;</p><p>Well,\nthat didn&rsquo;t sound too bad. Carefully, you made your way to the\ncommunal kitchen, planning to just sneak some leftover shawarma and\nheating it up at your own place.</p><p>Even\nthough it was the middle of the night, the chance of meeting someone\nwas high. Tony tended to stay in the lab longer than any other person\nwould be able to, so it wasn&rsquo;t unusual to find him in the kitchen\nat any time, brewing himself some coffee. Everyone on the team had\nnightmares from time to time, and if someone couldn&rsquo;t sleep after\nthem, they got some food, or something to drink, or stayed in the\ncommon room to watch TV on a bigger screen and a less lonely feeling\narea. Clint always craved food, Vision wasn&rsquo;t sleeping at all and\nyou once caught him phasing through walls and the ground to his\nheart&rsquo;s content.</p><p>So,\nthe chance of meeting <i>nobody</i> was slim, and of course you\ndidn&rsquo;t had any luck today. F.R.I.D.A.Y. had barely finished\ninforming you that &ldquo;Mr. Barnes is making his way to the kitchen,&rdquo;\nthat the good assassin turned the corner, halting in his steps when\nhe saw you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nhey,&rdquo; he said, smiling softly, <i>smiling softly,</i> as he stepped\nnext to you to retrieve a cup out of the cupboard. &ldquo;How you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nfine,&rdquo; you answered quietly, going back to shoveling shawarma onto\na plate.</p><p>Bucky\nstudied your face, then turned away to place his mug under the coffee\nmaker. &ldquo;Why were you crying?&rdquo;</p><p>You\nfroze. &ldquo;How -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your\neyes are a bit puffy.&rdquo;</p><p>Of\ncourse. Your entire form slumped in on itself. &ldquo;Steve, uh, visited\nme. Wanted to know why I, um, fled the gym.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky\nhummed. &ldquo;Stubborn punk. Didn&rsquo;t wanna hear a thing about letting\nyou come out of your own. What did he say to make you cry?&rdquo;</p><p>Being\nwith Bucky was easy, you had known this early on. Even now it seemed\nso much easier to tell Bucky everything than it was with Steve, even\nthough it concerned Bucky. But Bucky was patient, eyes holding no\njudgment as they regarded you, even though you closed and opened your\nmouth again and again without actually saying something. He smiled\nagain.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nwanna have a hot chocolate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,\nsit down, doll.&rdquo;</p><p>You\ndid as you were told, sat down and only a few minutes later, Bucky\nset down a steaming mug with hot chocolate in front of you, all with\nwhipped cream and cocoa powder on top. He sat down right next to you,\nnodding as you thanked him.</p><p>Blowing\non the liquid to cool it down a bit, you took your first sip. It\nreally tasted good, and after you lowered your mug back down, you\nkind of just blurted, &ldquo;I really like you, Bucky!&rdquo;</p><p>Hand\nstilling, Bucky stopped short of setting his own mug to his lips to\ntake a sip. But you didn&rsquo;t give him any opportunity to react.</p><p>&ldquo;Many,\n<i>so many </i>things are super confusing here, and I struggled many\ntimes. But you made everything just easy. It is easy to talk to you,\nit is easy to understand and accept myself when I&rsquo;m with you. What\n&hellip; what happened in the gym, did you &hellip; did you notice?&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky\npuffed, cheeks gaining color distinctly. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been hard\nnot to.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nstared at him dumbfounded, and he grinned, teeth showing as he cocked\nhis head to the side. &ldquo;Good pun, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Your\nlips twitched into a watery smile. &ldquo;I told Steve that I like you.\nHe &hellip; he looked at me like I was crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>The\ncorners of your lips dropped down, Bucky grimaced, but he did take\nyour hand laying on the table top, embracing your shaking fingers\nwith his own.</p><p>&ldquo;I\ntold him that I didn&rsquo;t plan this; I didn&rsquo;t even know what was\ngoing on, it just happened! Then I asked him what was wrong, why he\nbecame so <i>grossed out,</i> and he just said, said that the mere\n<i>notion</i> of us two- I- he &hellip; he said he couldn&rsquo;t believe it.\nAnd he had his stupid &lsquo;Captain-America&rsquo;-face.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky\nsighed, giving your hand a quick squeeze. &ldquo;Steve, you goddamn\nidiot,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Alright, Y/N, nobody plans anything when it\ncomes to feelings, okay? As you said, they just happen, and no normal\nhuman being, not even Steve, who, to be exact is no normal human\nbeing, can control them. You are not a freak or something like that\nbecause you have feelings. And sometimes a fella gets a boner when\nanother hot fella presses their thigh right down there.&rdquo;</p><p>Again,\nyou stared at him dumbfounded. &ldquo;Did you just describe yourself as a\nhot fella?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t\nanything wrong about being aware of &hellip; your qualities.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nlaughed. &ldquo;See, everything&rsquo;s easy with you, Bucky.&rdquo; You looked\nat him, his eyes sparkling as he looked right back with a smile on\nhis lips. &ldquo;I could kiss you right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Your\neyes widened. &ldquo;Okay, sorry, no, that would be weird. I like you,\nand you gave me my first bo- wow, please make me stop talking.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky\nlaughed. &ldquo;You know what is weird?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Steve\nkissing his first love&rsquo;s niece.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\n<i>that</i> is weird.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nwatched Bucky, who totally decided to lick his lips now on purpose.\n&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m five years old and have the body of a\ntwenty-three-year-old.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And\nI&rsquo;m a semi-stable 100-year-old man in a body of a thirty-year-old.\nJust because the whole <i>universe</i> is weird, doesn&rsquo;t mean you\ncan&rsquo;t be attracted to someone a bit older than you.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously,\nthere are also boundaries we don&rsquo;t cross, but <i>you</i> did\n<i>nothing</i> wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Bringing\nup a hand, you touched Bucky&rsquo;s cheek, thumb <strike>accidentally</strike>\nbrushing his upper lip. &ldquo;Does this mean I can kiss you?&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky\nsmiled.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><h2>Tags</h2><p><b>General:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NUj5cFwKPDsnEpTIEYI1A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NUj5cFwKPDsnEpTIEYI1A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NUj5cFwKPDsnEpTIEYI1A\">@buckys-shield</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miUIwJodtAJEdxSlsvGHPxg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miUIwJodtAJEdxSlsvGHPxg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miUIwJodtAJEdxSlsvGHPxg\">@woahmister-ohheck</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msjL3dLsAiR1bRIsuRIgAbg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msjL3dLsAiR1bRIsuRIgAbg\">@bluestroke1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDwFea9uQ94m2PN6e0CE-Xg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDwFea9uQ94m2PN6e0CE-Xg\">@tina8009</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpHWXfOCfRw5BT_O-y_fOQA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpHWXfOCfRw5BT_O-y_fOQA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpHWXfOCfRw5BT_O-y_fOQA\">@peters-vlogs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJt9KRjL8MxfM3BqYR0jxpA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJt9KRjL8MxfM3BqYR0jxpA\">@ailynalonso15</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmKGfhy1nzsdMnotu-5Pyg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmKGfhy1nzsdMnotu-5Pyg\">@x777eyes-wide-open</a><br /></p><p><b>male!Reader:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhzglZNFoG4LeYkSpTctBRA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhzglZNFoG4LeYkSpTctBRA\">@mrgrant9559-blog</a> <strike>@faeriekiing</strike><br /></p></p>",
