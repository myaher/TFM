        "question": "the thing that gets me abt the lack of inclusion of uncle ben's death in homecoming is that it genuinely didn't have to be a big part of the movie (such as in tasm, which i loved). batman vs superman, for all its flaws, showed the death of the waynes wonderfully, as a flashback bruce was having as he ran from their funeral, culminating in him falling into the cave of bats and beginning his journey towards batman, taking less than 5 minutes from beginning to end but framing his whole mentality.",
        "answer": "<p>Thank you for mentioning Batman here because literally one of the things I always go back to when people complain about having to sit through Uncle Ben\u2019s death again is that you would <i>never</i> see nerds treat Batman\u2019s origin story the same way. How would a version of Batman where they never mention he\u2019s an orphan even work? \u201cHere\u2019s Bruce Wayne, by the way, we\u2019re just not going to mention whether or not he has parents, because confirming they\u2019re dead might be kind of a downer. Them being shot in front of him certainly has no bearing on his crimefighting! We don\u2019t need to examine that <i>at all</i>.\u201d\u00a0I can\u2019t see it going over very well or being taken very seriously or being labeled as The First Bruce Wayne Movie. So why does Batman\u2019s loss-based origin story get continually treated with respect while Spider-Man\u2019s is seen as some negligible piece of his story? Is it because Batman\u2019s viewed as a more\u00a0\u201cserious\u201d character, in his black caped costume (with or without nipples), whereas Spider-Man\u2019s primary colors and quips mean we don\u2019t have to take him seriously as an important piece of the American pop culture landscape or as a real character with an established personality? Because &ndash; and no offense meant to Batman here, because I love Batman &ndash; that\u2019s totally bullshit.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s not mince words here: Homecoming\u2019s director, Jon Watts, has literally gone on record saying they didn\u2019t mention Uncle Ben because it would put a\u00a0\u201cdamper\u201d on the movie:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nAs for why Ben was left out, Watts says he wanted to go all out on focusing on how awesome it would be to become Spider-Man, going from a geeky teen to possessing superhuman powers. Dealing with the fact that Peter is partially guilty for a loved one\u2019s death would have put the dampers on that. (<a href=\"https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/spider-man-homecoming-uncle-ben/\">source</a>)</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Which is again, and I\u2019m sorry for repeating myself, but it\u2019s <i>total bullshit</i>. You have a character here who is defined by responsibility, whose famous catchphrase is <i>with great power comes great responsibility</i>, meaning that because he has greater power than the average man, he has a greater responsibility, so you remove the responsibility, because the responsibility\u2019s&hellip; not fun? Yeah, we know that! Responsibility\u2019s not fun! That\u2019s always been the point of Spider-Man! It\u2019s hard, but he does it, because it\u2019s right! And to quote my good friend Yuuhy: you actually do need to put \u201ca damper\u201d on a story about a teenage boy who can crush concrete &ndash; or a human skull &ndash; with his bare hands. You do need to cement that responsibility in him. His origin story is perfectly tailored towards showing that &ndash; Amazing Fantasy #15, Peter\u2019s first appearance, DOES show how great it would be to be a nerdy teenager who suddenly gets these incredible powers and has fun with them! Makes money with them! Is <i>selfish</i> with them. And someone he loves pays the price. It\u2019s important. Additionally, in erasing Uncle Ben\u2019s death from the narrative, you take away the fact that the Parkers are a family who are the victims of gun violence. When you\u2019re dealing with a story about a teenage outcast who suddenly gains incredible powers, I think that\u2019s kind of an important detail to include in the framing of his responsibility to his community. Of course, who can blame the MCU for leaving out something as small as Uncle Ben being shot when less than four months to the day of Spider-Man: Homecoming\u2019s release, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/marvel-ends-partnership-defense-contractor-northrop-grumman-1202583463/\">Marvel announced their intentions to partner with defense contractor Northrop Grumman</a> (which was canceled after massive fan backlash). Or when Spider-Man: Homecoming put drones and something called an \u201cinstant kill mode\u201d in Spider-Man\u2019s cool new technologically adept and weaponized suit. Or when the Pentagon can make changes to MCU film scripts. <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/captain-marvel-superhero-movies-air-force-comic-book-military-promotion-1348486?amp=1&amp;__twitter_impression=true\">This Newsweek article on Captain Marvel and the Air Force goes into detail</a>, including the sheer amount of military equipment that the Department of Defense put on screen for Iron Man 2. So we wouldn\u2019t want to confuse the audience by saying the small guns are bad when we definitely still want them to think the big guns are cool, right.</p><p>Like I\u2019ve said before, as much as I personally love the fact that The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) takes like a full 40 minutes of screentime to get to the scene where Uncle Ben is shot, I don\u2019t think you need to make it a big thing. Like you said about the Batman vs Superman scene &ndash; I haven\u2019t seen that movie yet, so thanks for your detailed description! &ndash; it doesn\u2019t have to be some big long thing. Take five minutes. Take two minutes. Hell, take twenty seconds. Into the Spider-Verse did it by having Ben say\u00a0\u201cwith great power comes great responsibility\u201d before walking into the light at the very beginning of the movie. (Fun fact! Ben actually doesn\u2019t originally say that line in Amazing Spider-Man #15, but I appreciate that it\u2019s become so associated with him, because it is the easiest way to communicate the sentiment to both the audience and to Peter in a film.)

            "comment": "<p>Thank you for mentioning Batman here because literally one of the things I always go back to when people complain about having to sit through Uncle Ben\u2019s death again is that you would <i>never</i> see nerds treat Batman\u2019s origin story the same way. How would a version of Batman where they never mention he\u2019s an orphan even work? \u201cHere\u2019s Bruce Wayne, by the way, we\u2019re just not going to mention whether or not he has parents, because confirming they\u2019re dead might be kind of a downer. Them being shot in front of him certainly has no bearing on his crimefighting! We don\u2019t need to examine that <i>at all</i>.\u201d\u00a0I can\u2019t see it going over very well or being taken very seriously or being labeled as The First Bruce Wayne Movie. So why does Batman\u2019s loss-based origin story get continually treated with respect while Spider-Man\u2019s is seen as some negligible piece of his story? Is it because Batman\u2019s viewed as a more\u00a0\u201cserious\u201d character, in his black caped costume (with or without nipples), whereas Spider-Man\u2019s primary colors and quips mean we don\u2019t have to take him seriously as an important piece of the American pop culture landscape or as a real character with an established personality? Because \u2013 and no offense meant to Batman here, because I love Batman \u2013 that\u2019s totally bullshit.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s not mince words here: Homecoming\u2019s director, Jon Watts, has literally gone on record saying they didn\u2019t mention Uncle Ben because it would put a\u00a0\u201cdamper\u201d on the movie:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nAs for why Ben was left out, Watts says he wanted to go all out on focusing on how awesome it would be to become Spider-Man, going from a geeky teen to possessing superhuman powers. Dealing with the fact that Peter is partially guilty for a loved one\u2019s death would have put the dampers on that. (<a href=\"https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/spider-man-homecoming-uncle-ben/\">source</a>)</i><br></p></blockquote><p>Which is again, and I\u2019m sorry for repeating myself, but it\u2019s <i>total bullshit</i>. You have a character here who is defined by responsibility, whose famous catchphrase is <i>with great power comes great responsibility</i>, meaning that because he has greater power than the average man, he has a greater responsibility, so you remove the responsibility, because the responsibility\u2019s\u2026 not fun? Yeah, we know that! Responsibility\u2019s not fun! That\u2019s always been the point of Spider-Man! It\u2019s hard, but he does it, because it\u2019s right! And to quote my good friend Yuuhy: you actually do need to put \u201ca damper\u201d on a story about a teenage boy who can crush concrete \u2013 or a human skull \u2013 with his bare hands. You do need to cement that responsibility in him. His origin story is perfectly tailored towards showing that \u2013 Amazing Fantasy #15, Peter\u2019s first appearance, DOES show how great it would be to be a nerdy teenager who suddenly gets these incredible powers and has fun with them! Makes money with them! Is <i>selfish</i> with them. And someone he loves pays the price. It\u2019s important. Additionally, in erasing Uncle Ben\u2019s death from the narrative, you take away the fact that the Parkers are a family who are the victims of gun violence. When you\u2019re dealing with a story about a teenage outcast who suddenly gains incredible powers, I think that\u2019s kind of an important detail to include in the framing of his responsibility to his community. Of course, who can blame the MCU for leaving out something as small as Uncle Ben being shot when less than four months to the day of Spider-Man: Homecoming\u2019s release, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/marvel-ends-partnership-defense-contractor-northrop-grumman-1202583463/\">Marvel announced their intentions to partner with defense contractor Northrop Grumman</a> (which was canceled after massive fan backlash). Or when Spider-Man: Homecoming put drones and something called an \u201cinstant kill mode\u201d in Spider-Man\u2019s cool new technologically adept and weaponized suit. Or when the Pentagon can make changes to MCU film scripts. <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/captain-marvel-superhero-movies-air-force-comic-book-military-promotion-1348486?amp=1&amp;__twitter_impression=true\">This Newsweek article on Captain Marvel and the Air Force goes into detail</a>, including the sheer amount of military equipment that the Department of Defense put on screen for Iron Man 2. So we wouldn\u2019t want to confuse the audience by saying the small guns are bad when we definitely still want them to think the big guns are cool, right.</p><p>Like I\u2019ve said before, as much as I personally love the fact that The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) takes like a full 40 minutes of screentime to get to the scene where Uncle Ben is shot, I don\u2019t think you need to make it a big thing. Like you said about the Batman vs Superman scene \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen that movie yet, so thanks for your detailed description! \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be some big long thing. Take five minutes. Take two minutes. Hell, take twenty seconds. Into the Spider-Verse did it by having Ben say\u00a0\u201cwith great power comes great responsibility\u201d before walking into the light at the very beginning of the movie. (Fun fact! Ben actually doesn\u2019t originally say that line in Amazing Spider-Man #15, but I appreciate that it\u2019s become so associated with him, because it is the easiest way to communicate the sentiment to both the audience and to Peter in a film.)

        "body": "<!-- more --><p>\n\nPeter swung onto the rooftop with the soft pat of his feet. It was a crisp night in New York City, the trees were loosing their leaves and Central Park had become a sea of orange and yellow, lit up by the never ending line of street\n lamps and night shift taxi\u2019s. It was peaceful in a way.\u00a0\n\u201cHey Spider butt.\u201d Well, at least he thought. Peter looked toward the voice and found that red suit laying on his back, hands used as a pillow for his head.\u00a0\n\u201cGeez Wade I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d Peter pads over to look down at him. \u201cWhat are you doing laying down?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStar gazing.\u201d He looks up to find what Wade is supposedly gazing it, but as usual pollution had covered the sky.\u00a0\n\u201cBut the-\u201c\n\u201cI know.\u201d Peter nodded quietly. He\u2019s had enough run ins with Wade to know you don\u2019t argue with him.\u00a0\n\u201cWell don\u2019t just stand there,\u201d Wade insists \u201ccome join the tranquility.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter pauses for a moment before laying next to Wade. \u201cWhich one is your favourite?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStar?\u201d Peter assumes, \u201cuh, that one.\u201d He says pointing to&hellip;well nothing really. Just fog.\n\u201cShit really?!\u201d Wade exclaims, \u201cthat\u2019s mine too! What a coinkydink.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter hums in response. His senses began to relax, even with the agitating noise of car horns and drunks shouting. This usually happens around Wade, Peter found it strange. There are times, when Peter is fuelling with adrenaline,\n that even the thought of Wade made Peter skin crawl, but other times there was little. Tingles really. Almost as if a thick wind was brushing against the hairs of his body.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you into 80\u2019s classics?\u201d Wade breaks the silence.\u00a0\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYa you know, music, movies, politics.\u201d Peter turns his head to Wade then back to the sky.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Queen is my Spotify top play, Bryan Adams had a couple good hits.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what about Wham? What do you think of them?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA great shower singalong.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFantastic.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter crosses his right foot over the left, overhead a plane is passing by. He recognizes the lights, it\u2019s a Stark Enterprise craft. After he had taken down Oscorp, he was approached by Tony Stark. Literally. He was offered a paid\n internship which turned out to be fighting Captain America in a German airport. Now he works along side Bruce when he isn\u2019t working or miserably studying his college courses. It\u2019s ironic that Harry happens to be the teachers assistant, meaning Peters grades\n don\u2019t always reflect what he knows. God damn Oscorp. For all it gave, it took, and it took.\u00a0\n\u201cWhatcha thinking about Spiderbutt?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGwen.\u201d It slipped out.\u00a0\n\u201cWho?\u201d Of course Wade doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0\n\u201cBen.\u201d Peter mumbles.\n\u201cAre you saying Gwen or Ben I can\u2019t tell?\u201d\u00a0\nPeter sighs and sits up, \u201cboth.\u201d He crawls over to the ledge and sits criss cross. Looking down at the city, he sees flashes of lights, people coming and going. He often wonders about their lives. Are they good? Bad? Do they possess\n superhuman abilities too or are they just normal? Peter wished he was normal.\u00a0\nWade is now propped up on his elbows watching him. His back was hunched and his head hung. Wade isn\u2019t good with emotions, he often uses humour to deal with such situations but he always does his best to impress Spiderman. That\u2019s the\n kind of crime fighter Wade aspires to be. So he gets up and sits on the ledge too, legs dangling over.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, I lost someone too.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSure but was it your fault?\u201d Peter asked flatly.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Wade nodded. \u201cI got messy on a job and they found my home. Six guys with guns broke down the door and I dropped all of them with kitchen knifes. God bless Betty Crocker. But the last one, he took a shot before I got him. The\n only bullet fired the entire time and it got Vanessa right in the chest. She died in surgery.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow did you deal with it?\u201d Peters voice sounded strained.\u00a0\n\u201cAt first I was a mess. I\u2019d kill myself over and over just to see her, to apologize&hellip;but after a while I realized it would fix nothing.\u201d Wade rolled up his mask to the bridge of his nose. His lips were chapped from the friction of\n leather. \u201cThen I found out I had a daughter from a past lady and Spidey let me tell you, reality hit me right in the sack. Just, metaphorically punches my balls back up into my body,\u201d Wade motions his fist upward. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew that as shitty as the\n situation was, it didn\u2019t define who I was. I had a lot left to live for and stewing in self loathing wasn\u2019t helping. I didn\u2019t sit back and let them kill Vanessa, I fought. The truth is man, in this line of work? You can\u2019t save everyone, and your loved ones\n are no exception. We just do the best we can, and deal with the sacrifices that come along.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter is glad that his mask is waterproof because he can\u2019t stop the few tears that fell.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSometimes life is a sandpaper dildo, other times its free bag of cocaine. You just gotta roll with the punches, play the cards you\u2019re dealt. You know what they say: with great power comes great responsibility.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter looks at Wade. \u201cWho says that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEverybody.\u201d Wade shrugs.\n\u201cI have literally never heard that in my life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201c&hellip;ya sure?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPositive.\u201d Peter looks back to the city.\n\u201cRight. Copy rights. So what\u2019s going to get you out of this funk? Could be anything. Something fun. Something dangerous.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWade-\u201c\n\u201cSpidey just trust me. I know that seems like a bad idea but I got past my loss and I can help you.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter sighs and shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, dangerous I guess.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOk good.\u201d Wade sits facing Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s something dangerous you\u2019ve always wanted to do?\u201d Peter thought for a moment. He had many things he\u2019d like to do, many lines he\u2019d like to push, but one stuck out in particular and it was calling\n his name.\u00a0\n\u201cThis.\u201d He reaches up and rips off his mask, it was an adrenaline he hadn\u2019t felt before. Wade stared at him mouth agape. Wade knew Peter was a fit guy but holy hell he was beautiful. \u201cThat feels better.\u201d Peter head turns to Wade.\n \u201cWhat do I have something on my face?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. A lot of handsome.\u201d Peter felt his cheeks burn and lightly punched Wade on the arm.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not gay.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t knock until you try it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI have enough problems I don\u2019t need my sexuality to be one of them.\u201d Wades wonder turned into a stern, tight lip.\u00a0\n\u201cBeing fluid isn\u2019t a problem. It\u2019s normal. I bet you haven\u2019t even tried it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo I haven\u2019t but honestly I\u2019m going through so much shit that I might just get drunk and give it a go.\u201d Peter rubs a hand over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know Wade I\u2019m sick of feeling nothing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThen let yourself feel something.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow?\u201d Peter expected one of wades smart ass comebacks but he got a chin grip and a solid kiss on the lips instead. His spider senses shot up like a rocked but crashed just as quick. When Wade finally let go Peter could hear the thump\n of his own pulse.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s your start.\u201d Wade sits back to his spot as if he had done nothing. Peter felt a turn in his stomach, and a lump from in his throat. But most of all, he felt hungry, and not in the way he usually does.\u00a0\n\u201cAgain.\u201d He demands.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wade barely has time to finish his question before Peter has him pinned to the roof top. \u201cSpidey?!\u201d He crushes his mouth against Wades, successful reliving the surge of taboo energy.\u00a0\n\u201cMy names Peter.\u201d Wade was speechless, even his boxes were silent. \u201cDon\u2019t knock until you try right? Wade, help me feel something.\u201d Peter knew before Wade said yes, he was sitting low enough to feel Wades erection grow against his\n thigh.\u00a0\n\u201cMy suit stays on.\u201d Peter nods at Wades request but starts removing his own. Wade does his best to help, both of them now heated with lust. Tossing the suit aside, Wade sits up to kiss Peter heatedly and forces him to sit against\n a dome skylight. Peters skin felt like it was burning against the cold glass. His cock too was now full and resting against his stomach. Wades mouth sucked heavenly at his mouth and makes it\u2019s way to his neck.\u00a0\n\u201cW-ade.\u201d Peter cracks in a moan. He wanted to cry, this felt wrong but he\u2019d just die if it stopped. He sucked in a loud gasp when Wades hand started pumping his cock, adding a little extra pressure just beneath the head. His precum\n dribbles out over Wades fingers and lands in the well kept patch of pubic hair on Peters body. Now Wade isn\u2019t use to sensual, romantic sex, he\u2019s always had the taste for the dirty but this time he was reserved. Peter had never even kissed a guy until now,\n Wade certainly wasn\u2019t about to split him open (he\u2019s a little hung in the pants if you know what I mean). But he couldn\u2019t let butt stuff escape this opportunity, so with the middle finger of his right hand, left hand still on Peters dick, he scoops up some\n of the slick from Peters body and reaches down below. Peter yelps when he feels Wades finger against his hole.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Wade assures, \u201cI won\u2019t go in.\u201d Peter nods and mewls when Wade begins to circle the untouched ring of muscle. Wades erection throbs in his suit, he had most of a mind to take it out but he wanted this experience to be all\n about Peter. Underneath him Peter was gripping onto the window ledge with his face nose to skin at Wades neck. He couldn\u2019t quit squirming and had to take a look at the stroking below, which by now had started to make lewd noises. It was certainly a sight he\u2019d\n never thought he\u2019d see but he loved the leather glove against his shaft. He wasn\u2019t pleased that Wade was doing all of the work, after all this is sex. Right? Kind of? Wade jumped and stopped his motion when Peter gripped him through his suit. \u201cPeter that\u2019s\n not necess-\u201c\u00a0\n\u201cShut up and keep going.\u201d Peter squeezes and Wade grunts. How could he say no to that? He starts again but this time his movements were sloppy, it was hard to concentrate while Peter rubbed him through his suit.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter if you don\u2019t stop-\u201c\n\u201cYou bet I\u2019m not.\u201d Wade groaned and quickened his hand on Peters cock.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck. Wade.\u201d That\u2019s when the orgasm hit Wade. He\u2019d never forget how his name sounded in that moment. He also didn\u2019t realize his finger and slipped into Peters ass, not until Peters back curled and a horse cry was heard. He had to\n have hit the prostate.\u00a0\nPeters whole body felt weightless yet paralyzed at the same time. His skin flushed red and hair damp with sweat. There was an uncomfortable tug at his bottom then emptiness. Peter felt empty.\u00a0\n\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t going in?\u201d He asked, not that he minded.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Wade says sitting back, \u201cit just kinda&hellip;slipped.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that in there?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s called a prostate, God uses it to punish straight men.\u201d Peter chuckles and lays his head back to look up, the fog was still thick. \u201cSo uh&hellip;that happened.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Usually I wine and dine first.\u201d Peter sits up to look for his suit, he\u2019s bloody freezing now, and covered in his own jizz no less. \u201cThis is really going to stain my suit.\u201d\n\u201cI got you.\u201d Wade reaches into a pouch on his belt and pulls out a baby wipe. \u201cI clean up a lot of blood now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Peter starts to clean his stomach and chest, still bare naked and you know what? He doesn\u2019t even mind. He doesn\u2019t feel the least bit vulnerable with Wade. Of course he still puts his suit back on, he is in the open air after\n all. \u201cHey Wade do you like Rocky?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo I like Rocky? Is that even a question? Is it legal to ask that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSo yes?\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d Peter nods and walks back to the ledge.\u00a0\n\u201cTomorrow night then? Back here? I\u2019ll bring my laptop and a blanket.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the snacks and cocaine.\u201d\n\u201cNo drugs.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOk.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSee you tomorrow then.\u201d Peter jumps from the ledge screaming Adrian, and swinging off into a city that never sleeps.\u00a0\n[Wade.]\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d He says standing up.\n{And you\u2019re totally chill?}\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d He says with a smile.\u00a0<br/></p>",

You know what they say: with great power comes great responsibility.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter looks at Wade. \u201cWho says that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEverybody.\u201d Wade shrugs.\n\u201cI have literally never heard that in my life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026ya sure?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPositive.\u201d Peter looks back to the city.\n\u201cRight. Copy rights. So what\u2019s going to get you out of this funk? Could be anything. Something fun. Something dangerous.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWade-\u201c\n\u201cSpidey just trust me. I know that seems like a bad idea but I got past my loss and I can help you.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter sighs and shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, dangerous I guess.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOk good.\u201d Wade sits facing Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s something dangerous you\u2019ve always wanted to do?\u201d Peter thought for a moment. He had many things he\u2019d like to do, many lines he\u2019d like to push, but one stuck out in particular and it was calling\n his name.\u00a0\n\u201cThis.\u201d He reaches up and rips off his mask, it was an adrenaline he hadn\u2019t felt before. Wade stared at him mouth agape. Wade knew Peter was a fit guy but holy hell he was beautiful. \u201cThat feels better.\u201d Peter head turns to Wade.\n \u201cWhat do I have something on my face?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. A lot of handsome.\u201d Peter felt his cheeks burn and lightly punched Wade on the arm.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not gay.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t knock until you try it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI have enough problems I don\u2019t need my sexuality to be one of them.\u201d Wades wonder turned into a stern, tight lip.\u00a0\n\u201cBeing fluid isn\u2019t a problem. It\u2019s normal. I bet you haven\u2019t even tried it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo I haven\u2019t but honestly I\u2019m going through so much shit that I might just get drunk and give it a go.\u201d Peter rubs a hand over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know Wade I\u2019m sick of feeling nothing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThen let yourself feel something.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow?\u201d Peter expected one of wades smart ass comebacks but he got a chin grip and a solid kiss on the lips instead. His spider senses shot up like a rocked but crashed just as quick. When Wade finally let go Peter could hear the thump\n of his own pulse.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s your start.\u201d Wade sits back to his spot as if he had done nothing. Peter felt a turn in his stomach, and a lump from in his throat. But most of all, he felt hungry, and not in the way he usually does.\u00a0\n\u201cAgain.\u201d He demands.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wade barely has time to finish his question before Peter has him pinned to the roof top. \u201cSpidey?!\u201d He crushes his mouth against Wades, successful reliving the surge of taboo energy.\u00a0\n\u201cMy names Peter.\u201d Wade was speechless, even his boxes were silent. \u201cDon\u2019t knock until you try right? Wade, help me feel something.\u201d Peter knew before Wade said yes, he was sitting low enough to feel Wades erection grow against his\n thigh.\u00a0\n\u201cMy suit stays on.\u201d Peter nods at Wades request but starts removing his own. Wade does his best to help, both of them now heated with lust. Tossing the suit aside, Wade sits up to kiss Peter heatedly and forces him to sit against\n a dome skylight. Peters skin felt like it was burning against the cold glass. His cock too was now full and resting against his stomach. Wades mouth sucked heavenly at his mouth and makes it\u2019s way to his neck.\u00a0\n\u201cW-ade.\u201d Peter cracks in a moan. He wanted to cry, this felt wrong but he\u2019d just die if it stopped. He sucked in a loud gasp when Wades hand started pumping his cock, adding a little extra pressure just beneath the head. His precum\n dribbles out over Wades fingers and lands in the well kept patch of pubic hair on Peters body. Now Wade isn\u2019t use to sensual, romantic sex, he\u2019s always had the taste for the dirty but this time he was reserved. Peter had never even kissed a guy until now,\n Wade certainly wasn\u2019t about to split him open (he\u2019s a little hung in the pants if you know what I mean). But he couldn\u2019t let butt stuff escape this opportunity, so with the middle finger of his right hand, left hand still on Peters dick, he scoops up some\n of the slick from Peters body and reaches down below. Peter yelps when he feels Wades finger against his hole.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Wade assures, \u201cI won\u2019t go in.\u201d Peter nods and mewls when Wade begins to circle the untouched ring of muscle. Wades erection throbs in his suit, he had most of a mind to take it out but he wanted this experience to be all\n about Peter. Underneath him Peter was gripping onto the window ledge with his face nose to skin at Wades neck. He couldn\u2019t quit squirming and had to take a look at the stroking below, which by now had started to make lewd noises. It was certainly a sight he\u2019d\n never thought he\u2019d see but he loved the leather glove against his shaft. He wasn\u2019t pleased that Wade was doing all of the work, after all this is sex. Right? Kind of? Wade jumped and stopped his motion when Peter gripped him through his suit. \u201cPeter that\u2019s\n not necess-\u201c\u00a0\n\u201cShut up and keep going.\u201d Peter squeezes and Wade grunts. How could he say no to that? He starts again but this time his movements were sloppy, it was hard to concentrate while Peter rubbed him through his suit.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter if you don\u2019t stop-\u201c\n\u201cYou bet I\u2019m not.\u201d Wade groaned and quickened his hand on Peters cock.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck. Wade.\u201d That\u2019s when the orgasm hit Wade. He\u2019d never forget how his name sounded in that moment. He also didn\u2019t realize his finger and slipped into Peters ass, not until Peters back curled and a horse cry was heard. He had to\n have hit the prostate.\u00a0\nPeters whole body felt weightless yet paralyzed at the same time. His skin flushed red and hair damp with sweat. There was an uncomfortable tug at his bottom then emptiness. Peter felt empty.\u00a0\n\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t going in?\u201d He asked, not that he minded.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Wade says sitting back, \u201cit just kinda\u2026slipped.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that in there?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s called a prostate, God uses it to punish straight men.\u201d Peter chuckles and lays his head back to look up, the fog was still thick. \u201cSo uh\u2026that happened.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Usually I wine and dine first.\u201d Peter sits up to look for his suit, he\u2019s bloody freezing now, and covered in his own jizz no less. \u201cThis is really going to stain my suit.\u201d\n\u201cI got you.\u201d Wade reaches into a pouch on his belt and pulls out a baby wipe. \u201cI clean up a lot of blood now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Peter starts to clean his stomach and chest, still bare naked and you know what? He doesn\u2019t even mind. He doesn\u2019t feel the least bit vulnerable with Wade. Of course he still puts his suit back on, he is in the open air after\n all. \u201cHey Wade do you like Rocky?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo I like Rocky? Is that even a question? Is it legal to ask that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSo yes?\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d Peter nods and walks back to the ledge.\u00a0\n\u201cTomorrow night then? Back here? I\u2019ll bring my laptop and a blanket.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the snacks and cocaine.\u201d\n\u201cNo drugs.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOk.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSee you tomorrow then.\u201d Peter jumps from the ledge screaming Adrian, and swinging off into a city that never sleeps.\u00a0\n[Wade.]\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d He says standing up.\n{And you\u2019re totally chill?}\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d He says with a smile.\u00a0<br></p></p>",

It was a crisp night in New York City, the trees were loosing their leaves and Central Park had become a sea of orange and yellow, lit up by the never ending line of street\n lamps and night shift taxi\u2019s. It was peaceful in a way.\u00a0\n\u201cHey Spider butt.\u201d Well, at least he thought. Peter looked toward the voice and found that red suit laying on his back, hands used as a pillow for his head.\u00a0\n\u201cGeez Wade I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d Peter pads over to look down at him. \u201cWhat are you doing laying down?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStar gazing.\u201d He looks up to find what Wade is supposedly gazing it, but as usual pollution had covered the sky.\u00a0\n\u201cBut the-\u201c\n\u201cI know.\u201d Peter nodded quietly. He\u2019s had enough run ins with Wade to know you don\u2019t argue with him.\u00a0\n\u201cWell don\u2019t just stand there,\u201d Wade insists \u201ccome join the tranquility.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter pauses for a moment before laying next to Wade. \u201cWhich one is your favourite?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStar?\u201d Peter assumes, \u201cuh, that one.\u201d He says pointing to\u2026well nothing really. Just fog.\n\u201cShit really?!\u201d Wade exclaims, \u201cthat\u2019s mine too! What a coinkydink.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter hums in response. His senses began to relax, even with the agitating noise of car horns and drunks shouting. This usually happens around Wade, Peter found it strange. There are times, when Peter is fuelling with adrenaline,\n that even the thought of Wade made Peter skin crawl, but other times there was little. Tingles really. Almost as if a thick wind was brushing against the hairs of his body.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you into 80\u2019s classics?\u201d Wade breaks the silence.\u00a0\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYa you know, music, movies, politics.\u201d Peter turns his head to Wade then back to the sky.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Queen is my Spotify top play, Bryan Adams had a couple good hits.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what about Wham? What do you think of them?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA great shower singalong.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFantastic.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter crosses his right foot over the left, overhead a plane is passing by. He recognizes the lights, it\u2019s a Stark Enterprise craft. After he had taken down Oscorp, he was approached by Tony Stark. Literally. He was offered a paid\n internship which turned out to be fighting Captain America in a German airport. Now he works along side Bruce when he isn\u2019t working or miserably studying his college courses. It\u2019s ironic that Harry happens to be the teachers assistant, meaning Peters grades\n don\u2019t always reflect what he knows. God damn Oscorp. For all it gave, it took, and it took.\u00a0\n\u201cWhatcha thinking about Spiderbutt?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGwen.\u201d It slipped out.\u00a0\n\u201cWho?\u201d Of course Wade doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0\n\u201cBen.\u201d Peter mumbles.\n\u201cAre you saying Gwen or Ben I can\u2019t tell?\u201d\u00a0\nPeter sighs and sits up, \u201cboth.\u201d He crawls over to the ledge and sits criss cross. Looking down at the city, he sees flashes of lights, people coming and going. He often wonders about their lives. Are they good? Bad? Do they possess\n superhuman abilities too or are they just normal? Peter wished he was normal.\u00a0\nWade is now propped up on his elbows watching him. His back was hunched and his head hung. Wade isn\u2019t good with emotions, he often uses humour to deal with such situations but he always does his best to impress Spiderman. That\u2019s the\n kind of crime fighter Wade aspires to be. So he gets up and sits on the ledge too, legs dangling over.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, I lost someone too.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSure but was it your fault?\u201d Peter asked flatly.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Wade nodded. \u201cI got messy on a job and they found my home. Six guys with guns broke down the door and I dropped all of them with kitchen knifes. God bless Betty Crocker. But the last one, he took a shot before I got him. The\n only bullet fired the entire time and it got Vanessa right in the chest. She died in surgery.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow did you deal with it?\u201d Peters voice sounded strained.\u00a0\n\u201cAt first I was a mess. I\u2019d kill myself over and over just to see her, to apologize\u2026but after a while I realized it would fix nothing.\u201d Wade rolled up his mask to the bridge of his nose. His lips were chapped from the friction of\n leather. \u201cThen I found out I had a daughter from a past lady and Spidey let me tell you, reality hit me right in the sack. Just, metaphorically punches my balls back up into my body,\u201d Wade motions his fist upward. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew that as shitty as the\n situation was, it didn\u2019t define who I was. I had a lot left to live for and stewing in self loathing wasn\u2019t helping. I didn\u2019t sit back and let them kill Vanessa, I fought. The truth is man, in this line of work? You can\u2019t save everyone, and your loved ones\n are no exception. We just do the best we can, and deal with the sacrifices that come along.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter is glad that his mask is waterproof because he can\u2019t stop the few tears that fell.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSometimes life is a sandpaper dildo, other times its free bag of cocaine. You just gotta roll with the punches, play the cards you\u2019re dealt. You know what they say: with great power comes great responsibility.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter looks at Wade. \u201cWho says that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEverybody.\u201d Wade shrugs.\n\u201cI have literally never heard that in my life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026ya sure?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPositive.\u201d Peter looks back to the city.\n\u201cRight. Copy rights. So what\u2019s going to get you out of this funk? Could be anything. Something fun. Something dangerous.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWade-\u201c\n\u201cSpidey just trust me. I know that seems like a bad idea but I got past my loss and I can help you.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter sighs and shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, dangerous I guess.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOk good.\u201d Wade sits facing Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s something dangerous you\u2019ve always wanted to do?\u201d Peter thought for a moment. He had many things he\u2019d like to do, many lines he\u2019d like to push, but one stuck out in particular and it was calling\n his name.\u00a0\n\u201cThis.\u201d He reaches up and rips off his mask, it was an adrenaline he hadn\u2019t felt before.

A lot of handsome.\u201d Peter felt his cheeks burn and lightly punched Wade on the arm.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not gay.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t knock until you try it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI have enough problems I don\u2019t need my sexuality to be one of them.\u201d Wades wonder turned into a stern, tight lip.\u00a0\n\u201cBeing fluid isn\u2019t a problem. It\u2019s normal. I bet you haven\u2019t even tried it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo I haven\u2019t but honestly I\u2019m going through so much shit that I might just get drunk and give it a go.\u201d Peter rubs a hand over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know Wade I\u2019m sick of feeling nothing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThen let yourself feel something.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow?\u201d Peter expected one of wades smart ass comebacks but he got a chin grip and a solid kiss on the lips instead. His spider senses shot up like a rocked but crashed just as quick. When Wade finally let go Peter could hear the thump\n of his own pulse.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s your start.\u201d Wade sits back to his spot as if he had done nothing.

Wade, help me feel something.\u201d Peter knew before Wade said yes, he was sitting low enough to feel Wades erection grow against his\n thigh.\u00a0\n\u201cMy suit stays on.\u201d Peter nods at Wades request but starts removing his own. Wade does his best to help, both of them now heated with lust. Tossing the suit aside, Wade sits up to kiss Peter heatedly and forces him to sit against\n a dome skylight. Peters skin felt like it was burning against the cold glass. His cock too was now full and resting against his stomach.

He starts again but this time his movements were sloppy, it was hard to concentrate while Peter rubbed him through his suit.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter if you don\u2019t stop-\u201c\n\u201cYou bet I\u2019m not.\u201d Wade groaned and quickened his hand on Peters cock.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck. Wade.\u201d That\u2019s when the orgasm hit Wade. He\u2019d never forget how his name sounded in that moment. He also didn\u2019t realize his finger and slipped into Peters ass, not until Peters back curled and a horse cry was heard. He had to\n have hit the prostate.\u00a0\nPeters whole body felt weightless yet paralyzed at the same time. His skin flushed red and hair damp with sweat. There was an uncomfortable tug at his bottom then emptiness. Peter felt empty.\u00a0\n\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t going in?\u201d He asked, not that he minded.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Wade says sitting back, \u201cit just kinda\u2026slipped.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that in there?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s called a prostate, God uses it to punish straight men.\u201d Peter chuckles and lays his head back to look up, the fog was still thick. \u201cSo uh\u2026that happened.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Usually I wine and dine first.\u201d Peter sits up to look for his suit, he\u2019s bloody freezing now, and covered in his own jizz no less. \u201cThis is really going to stain my suit.\u201d\n\u201cI got you.\u201d Wade reaches into a pouch on his belt and pulls out a baby wipe. \u201cI clean up a lot of blood now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Peter starts to clean his stomach and chest, still bare naked and you know what? He doesn\u2019t even mind. He doesn\u2019t feel the least bit vulnerable with Wade. Of course he still puts his suit back on, he is in the open air after\n all. \u201cHey Wade do you like Rocky?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo I like Rocky? Is that even a question? Is it legal to ask that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSo yes?\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d Peter nods and walks back to the ledge.\u00a0\n\u201cTomorrow night then? Back here? I\u2019ll bring my laptop and a blanket.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the snacks and cocaine.\u201d\n\u201cNo drugs.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOk.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSee you tomorrow then.\u201d Peter jumps from the ledge screaming Adrian, and swinging off into a city that never sleeps.\u00a0\n[Wade.]\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d He says standing up.\n{And you\u2019re totally chill?}\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d He says with a smile.\u00a0<br></p></p>",
                "content": "<p>\n\nPeter swung onto the rooftop with the soft pat of his feet. It was a crisp night in New York City, the trees were loosing their leaves and Central Park had become a sea of orange and yellow, lit up by the never ending line of street\n lamps and night shift taxi&rsquo;s. It was peaceful in a way.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Hey Spider butt.&rdquo; Well, at least he thought. Peter looked toward the voice and found that red suit laying on his back, hands used as a pillow for his head.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Geez Wade I didn&rsquo;t see you there.&rdquo; Peter pads over to look down at him. &ldquo;What are you doing laying down?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Star gazing.&rdquo; He looks up to find what Wade is supposedly gazing it, but as usual pollution had covered the sky.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;But the-&ldquo;\n&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Peter nodded quietly. He&rsquo;s had enough run ins with Wade to know you don&rsquo;t argue with him.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t just stand there,&rdquo; Wade insists &ldquo;come join the tranquility.&rdquo;&nbsp;\nPeter pauses for a moment before laying next to Wade. &ldquo;Which one is your favourite?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Star?&rdquo; Peter assumes, &ldquo;uh, that one.&rdquo; He says pointing to&hellip;well nothing really. Just fog.\n&ldquo;Shit really?!&rdquo; Wade exclaims, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s mine too! What a coinkydink.&rdquo;&nbsp;\nPeter hums in response. His senses began to relax, even with the agitating noise of car horns and drunks shouting. This usually happens around Wade, Peter found it strange. There are times, when Peter is fuelling with adrenaline,\n that even the thought of Wade made Peter skin crawl, but other times there was little. Tingles really. Almost as if a thick wind was brushing against the hairs of his body.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Are you into 80&rsquo;s classics?&rdquo; Wade breaks the silence.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Ya you know, music, movies, politics.&rdquo; Peter turns his head to Wade then back to the sky.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Well, Queen is my Spotify top play, Bryan Adams had a couple good hits.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;And what about Wham? What do you think of them?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;A great shower singalong.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Fantastic.&rdquo;&nbsp;\nPeter crosses his right foot over the left, overhead a plane is passing by. He recognizes the lights, it&rsquo;s a Stark Enterprise craft. After he had taken down Oscorp, he was approached by Tony Stark. Literally. He was offered a paid\n internship which turned out to be fighting Captain America in a German airport. Now he works along side Bruce when he isn&rsquo;t working or miserably studying his college courses. It&rsquo;s ironic that Harry happens to be the teachers assistant, meaning Peters grades\n don&rsquo;t always reflect what he knows. God damn Oscorp. For all it gave, it took, and it took.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Whatcha thinking about Spiderbutt?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Gwen.&rdquo; It slipped out.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Of course Wade doesn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Ben.&rdquo; Peter mumbles.\n&ldquo;Are you saying Gwen or Ben I can&rsquo;t tell?&rdquo;&nbsp;\nPeter sighs and sits up, &ldquo;both.&rdquo; He crawls over to the ledge and sits criss cross. Looking down at the city, he sees flashes of lights, people coming and going. He often wonders about their lives. Are they good? Bad? Do they possess\n superhuman abilities too or are they just normal? Peter wished he was normal.&nbsp;\nWade is now propped up on his elbows watching him. His back was hunched and his head hung. Wade isn&rsquo;t good with emotions, he often uses humour to deal with such situations but he always does his best to impress Spiderman. That&rsquo;s the\n kind of crime fighter Wade aspires to be. So he gets up and sits on the ledge too, legs dangling over.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;You know, I lost someone too.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Sure but was it your fault?&rdquo; Peter asked flatly.\n&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Wade nodded. &ldquo;I got messy on a job and they found my home. Six guys with guns broke down the door and I dropped all of them with kitchen knifes. God bless Betty Crocker. But the last one, he took a shot before I got him. The\n only bullet fired the entire time and it got Vanessa right in the chest. She died in surgery.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;How did you deal with it?&rdquo; Peters voice sounded strained.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;At first I was a mess. I&rsquo;d kill myself over and over just to see her, to apologize&hellip;but after a while I realized it would fix nothing.&rdquo; Wade rolled up his mask to the bridge of his nose. His lips were chapped from the friction of\n leather. &ldquo;Then I found out I had a daughter from a past lady and Spidey let me tell you, reality hit me right in the sack. Just, metaphorically punches my balls back up into my body,&rdquo; Wade motions his fist upward. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I knew that as shitty as the\n situation was, it didn&rsquo;t define who I was. I had a lot left to live for and stewing in self loathing wasn&rsquo;t helping. I didn&rsquo;t sit back and let them kill Vanessa, I fought. The truth is man, in this line of work? You can&rsquo;t save everyone, and your loved ones\n are no exception. We just do the best we can, and deal with the sacrifices that come along.&rdquo;&nbsp;\nPeter is glad that his mask is waterproof because he can&rsquo;t stop the few tears that fell.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Sometimes life is a sandpaper dildo, other times its free bag of cocaine. You just gotta roll with the punches, play the cards you&rsquo;re dealt. You know what they say: with great power comes great responsibility.&rdquo;&nbsp;\nPeter looks at Wade. &ldquo;Who says that?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Everybody.&rdquo; Wade shrugs.\n&ldquo;I have literally never heard that in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;&hellip;ya sure?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Positive.&rdquo; Peter looks back to the city.\n&ldquo;Right. Copy rights. So what&rsquo;s going to get you out of this funk? Could be anything. Something fun. Something dangerous.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Wade-&ldquo;\n&ldquo;Spidey just trust me. I know that seems like a bad idea but I got past my loss and I can help you.&rdquo;&nbsp;\nPeter sighs and shrugs. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, dangerous I guess.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Ok good.&rdquo; Wade sits facing Peter. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s something dangerous you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do?&rdquo; Peter thought for a moment. He had many things he&rsquo;d like to do, many lines he&rsquo;d like to push, but one stuck out in particular and it was calling\n his name.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;This.&rdquo; He reaches up and rips off his mask, it was an adrenaline he hadn&rsquo;t felt before. Wade stared at him mouth agape. Wade knew Peter was a fit guy but holy hell he was beautiful. &ldquo;That feels better.&rdquo; Peter head turns to Wade.\n &ldquo;What do I have something on my face?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Yeah. A lot of handsome.&rdquo; Peter felt his cheeks burn and lightly punched Wade on the arm.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gay.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t knock until you try it.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;I have enough problems I don&rsquo;t need my sexuality to be one of them.&rdquo; Wades wonder turned into a stern, tight lip.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Being fluid isn&rsquo;t a problem. It&rsquo;s normal. I bet you haven&rsquo;t even tried it.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;No I haven&rsquo;t but honestly I&rsquo;m going through so much shit that I might just get drunk and give it a go.&rdquo; Peter rubs a hand over his face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Wade I&rsquo;m sick of feeling nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Then let yourself feel something.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Peter expected one of wades smart ass comebacks but he got a chin grip and a solid kiss on the lips instead. His spider senses shot up like a rocked but crashed just as quick. When Wade finally let go Peter could hear the thump\n of his own pulse.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your start.&rdquo; Wade sits back to his spot as if he had done nothing. Peter felt a turn in his stomach, and a lump from in his throat. But most of all, he felt hungry, and not in the way he usually does.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Again.&rdquo; He demands.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Wade barely has time to finish his question before Peter has him pinned to the roof top. &ldquo;Spidey?!&rdquo; He crushes his mouth against Wades, successful reliving the surge of taboo energy.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;My names Peter.&rdquo; Wade was speechless, even his boxes were silent. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t knock until you try right? Wade, help me feel something.&rdquo; Peter knew before Wade said yes, he was sitting low enough to feel Wades erection grow against his\n thigh.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;My suit stays on.&rdquo; Peter nods at Wades request but starts removing his own. Wade does his best to help, both of them now heated with lust. Tossing the suit aside, Wade sits up to kiss Peter heatedly and forces him to sit against\n a dome skylight. Peters skin felt like it was burning against the cold glass. His cock too was now full and resting against his stomach. Wades mouth sucked heavenly at his mouth and makes it&rsquo;s way to his neck.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;W-ade.&rdquo; Peter cracks in a moan. He wanted to cry, this felt wrong but he&rsquo;d just die if it stopped. He sucked in a loud gasp when Wades hand started pumping his cock, adding a little extra pressure just beneath the head. His precum\n dribbles out over Wades fingers and lands in the well kept patch of pubic hair on Peters body. Now Wade isn&rsquo;t use to sensual, romantic sex, he&rsquo;s always had the taste for the dirty but this time he was reserved. Peter had never even kissed a guy until now,\n Wade certainly wasn&rsquo;t about to split him open (he&rsquo;s a little hung in the pants if you know what I mean). But he couldn&rsquo;t let butt stuff escape this opportunity, so with the middle finger of his right hand, left hand still on Peters dick, he scoops up some\n of the slick from Peters body and reaches down below. Peter yelps when he feels Wades finger against his hole.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok,&rdquo; Wade assures, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo; Peter nods and mewls when Wade begins to circle the untouched ring of muscle. Wades erection throbs in his suit, he had most of a mind to take it out but he wanted this experience to be all\n about Peter. Underneath him Peter was gripping onto the window ledge with his face nose to skin at Wades neck. He couldn&rsquo;t quit squirming and had to take a look at the stroking below, which by now had started to make lewd noises. It was certainly a sight he&rsquo;d\n never thought he&rsquo;d see but he loved the leather glove against his shaft. He wasn&rsquo;t pleased that Wade was doing all of the work, after all this is sex. Right? Kind of? Wade jumped and stopped his motion when Peter gripped him through his suit. &ldquo;Peter that&rsquo;s\n not necess-&ldquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Shut up and keep going.&rdquo; Peter squeezes and Wade grunts. How could he say no to that? He starts again but this time his movements were sloppy, it was hard to concentrate while Peter rubbed him through his suit.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Peter if you don&rsquo;t stop-&ldquo;\n&ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; Wade groaned and quickened his hand on Peters cock.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Fuck. Wade.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when the orgasm hit Wade. He&rsquo;d never forget how his name sounded in that moment. He also didn&rsquo;t realize his finger and slipped into Peters ass, not until Peters back curled and a horse cry was heard. He had to\n have hit the prostate.&nbsp;\nPeters whole body felt weightless yet paralyzed at the same time. His skin flushed red and hair damp with sweat. There was an uncomfortable tug at his bottom then emptiness. Peter felt empty.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;I thought you said you weren&rsquo;t going in?&rdquo; He asked, not that he minded.\n&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; Wade says sitting back, &ldquo;it just kinda&hellip;slipped.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;What was that in there?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called a prostate, God uses it to punish straight men.&rdquo; Peter chuckles and lays his head back to look up, the fog was still thick. &ldquo;So uh&hellip;that happened.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Yeah.
