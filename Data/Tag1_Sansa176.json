        "answer": "<p>Well\u2026she <i>could</i>\u00a0make that argument, it\u2019d just go into the legal weeds if she did, with some nasty implications for the standing of Jon\u2019s regime. (I\u2019m going to assume for a second that law and politics in the show are functional bits of worldbuilding, which they are not, and everything to do with Sansa and Ramsay proves it.) And she wouldn\u2019t <i>own</i>\u00a0the Dreadfort; she\u2019d have widow\u2019s rights to it. (Again, if this were anything like the books.)</p><p>First, are the Starks prepared to allow Roose\u2019s right to the Dreadfort to stand for the period between his betrayal of the Starks and his murder? Jon argued to Dany that the feudal arrangement between Rickard and Aerys was void from Aerys\u2019 betrayal; that would indicate to me that he would regard the feudal contract between the Starks and the Boltons void from the Red Wedding, and Roose was no longer Lord of the Dreadfort by the Starks\u2019 consent. The title wasn\u2019t Roose\u2019s to give to his heir upon his death. Arguably.</p><p>Second, Ramsay. Even if Jon decided that the Dreadfort <i>was</i>\u00a0Roose\u2019s, passing to his heir as per usual, <i>was</i>\u00a0Ramsay a legitimate heir? Ramsay was legitimised by Tommen. Any recognition of this is a recognition of Tommen\u2019s legal authority (and <i>this</i>, the show has definitely ignored). As far as the Starks should be concerned, Ramsay was always a bastard. There may be Bolton cousins out there with claims to the Dreadfort the Starks would prefer to his.</p><p>Third, the marriage itself. Do the Starks want to recognise the validity of Sansa\u2019s marriage to Ramsay? While there\u2019s precedent for wedding vows said at swordpoint being binding (in the books), that also seems like a precedent that Jon might want to overrule for <i>so</i>\u00a0many reasons. That would be a good positive development in the Northern legal system, inching the standard of consent required to make a binding marriage a bit higher.</p><p>Fourth, even if Jon decides Roose was able to pass his title and lands on, to Ramsay, and from him to his legal wife, whether he takes them away for Ramsay\u2019s actions is definitely within his powers - Sansa\u2019s argued rights to the lands and titles notwithstanding. That\u2019s the sort of decision he gets to make. If he wants to parcel out that land to the people who actually supported him, he gets to do that. In practical political terms, his subjects would back him on this one.</p><p>Most importantly, however, is what <i>Sansa</i>\u00a0wants. It\u2019s clear to me that <i>she</i>\u00a0rejects the marriage\u2019s validity and prefers to build her political identity and power as a Stark. Who could blame her?</p>",

In my previous post I wrote that:<br/></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nIf Sansa\u2019s season 2 arc was about enduring abuse, then her season 3 arc is dealing with hope of an escape - a hope held out by different political players of varying trustworthiness.\n\n</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>However, her season 3 arc is also very much about her political status as Robb Stark\u2019s heir apparent. In short, she has become the Key to the North and as such she\u2019s become an important piece on the political chessboard and to all the major political players in King\u2019s Landing and that is why Petyr Baelish, Lord Varys, Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells begin to take an interest in her. In this post I\u2019m going to take a closer look at her very first interactions with the members of House Tyrell, which is establishing itself as a major power player in the Game of Thrones. Sansa has several interactions with the Tyrells but in this post I\u2019ll limit my analysis to one scene in particular since it is interesting how the Tyrells at first are only interested in Sansa because they\u2019ve heard some disturbing rumours about King Joffrey, Margaery Tyrell\u2019s intended. It is also a scene that I found much more disturbing during my re-watch than when I first watched in years ago.</p><!-- more --><p><b>SECRETS, LIES AND TRUTH - LUNCH WITH THE TYRELLS</b></p><p>In my metas about Margery Tyrell\u2019s season 3 arc (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179150770774/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>), I noted that she immediately made her presence felt in King\u2019s Landing through a clever deployment of soft power, which has secured her the goodwill of the common people. At the same time her grandmother Olenna, called the Queen of Thorns, conducts the more direct political negotiations with both Tywin and Tyrion Lannister. However, that is not all - in the very first episode it becomes clear that they are also taking an interest in Sansa, due to the disturbing rumours that they\u2019ve heard about Joffrey\u2019s abuse of her. Thus, they are quick to invite her to a private lunch in the lush gardens of the Red Keep.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"404\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb3cbf3761390613bd6411ff30b5495e/tumblr_inline_pjh4ac8yIY1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"404\"/></figure><p>It is both sweet and a bit sad to see how happy and excited Sansa is that there are some people that want to spend time with her, who are initially kind to her and who even made the effort to find out what her favorite food is.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e74afd0b1442fa1830ab800818320650/tumblr_inline_pjh49xwzec1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure><p>Her hopeful little smile here shows how incredibly grateful she is that someone is seeking out her company and it really drives home just how isolated and lonely Sansa has been at the royal court - shunned by the people who have been standing idly by as she\u2019s been abused in public.\u00a0</p><p>She\u2019s being charmed by the Tyrells and you can see how she\u2019s beginning to think that things might change for her. Sadly, as Sansa, Olenna and Margaery sit down for a talk, it quickly becomes clear that the reason they have invited her to lunch is because they want something from her. It is worth watching the entire scene, especially the private conversation between the three women (timestamp; 2:22) because this conversation turns out to be rather traumatic for Sansa.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FsyFUIT_v3Pk%3Ft%3D142\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/syFUIT_v3Pk?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s happiness is shattered the moment that Olenna Tyrell asks her to tell the truth about Joffrey. This turn in the conversation makes\nSansa feel incredibly nervous and unsafe \u2013 she stammers and her eyes dart\nwildly about, as if she\u2019s looking for an escape.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I\u2026 I\u2026</i></p><p>Olenna: <i>You, you. Who else know better? We\u2019ve heard\nsome troubling tales. Is there any truth to them?</i></p></blockquote><p>Cut to a\nclose-up of Margaery, tilting her head, looking at Sansa. Then the camera cuts to a\nclose-up of Sansa who looks down, having lost her happy smile. She\u2019s clearly\nscared but perhaps also disappointed that these people have only sought out her\ncompany because they want something from her.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna\n(VO): <i>Has this boy mistreated you? &hellip;</i><i>\u00a0Has he ripped out your tongue?</i></p></blockquote><p>Olenna really\ncomes across as a bully here, especially when you consider that Sansa is an\nabuse victim.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\n(stammers): <i>King Joffrey, His Grace is\nvery fair and handsome and as brave as a lion.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is clear\nthat Sansa is very uncomfortable and that she\u2019s lying. Sansa\u2019s response tells us that\nshe doesn\u2019t trust the Tyrells, and I also expect that she doesn\u2019t react well to\nOlenna pressuring her like that (it is too similar to the way her abusers demanding answers\nfrom her), which we\u2019ve seen in previous episodes. In fact, Olenna\u2019s method is reminiscent of how Cersei Lannister interacts with Sansa (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175999573309/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-9\">x</a>), except that Olenna is more directly aggressive than Cersei.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>Yes, all Lannisters are lions\u2026 But how kind\nis he? How clever? Has he a good heart? A gentle hand?</i></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/caecff9ab2042f91e57b1b159b105ed8/tumblr_inline_pkrjq6fype1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>I\u2019m to be his wife. I only want to know what\nthat means.</i></p></blockquote><p>I believe\nthat Margaery is honest here. Then we get an\u00a0OTS shot of\nMargaery, from Sansa\u2019s POV. The camera work reinforces the POV structure \u2013 we\nexperience this conversation mainly through Sansa point of view. The camera cuts to a close-up of\nSansa, her mouth is slightly open.\nThis is a reaction shot to Margaery\u2019s utterance. Sansa is hesitating, pondering whether she should tell Margaery the truth. Margaery\u2019s soft approach seems to\nwork better than Olenna\u2019s heavy-handed bullying. This moment, where\nSansa is on the brink of telling the truth about Joffrey, is ruined when a\nservant appears. <b>Sansa turns to look at\nhim \u2013 and when she turns back, her expression is closed-off!</b> She\u2019s afraid\nof being overheard \u2013 she knows that there are spies everywhere in the Red Keep.\nSansa lowers her head quickly and her gaze follows the retreating servant.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna\n(leaning forward towards Sansa): <i>Are you\nfrightened child? No need for that.</i></p></blockquote><p>She offers\nSansa a lemon cake \u2013 her favorite food \u2013 in an attempt to calm her down.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>We\u2019re only women here. Tell us the truth. No\nharm will come to you.</i></p></blockquote><p>OTS shot of\nSansa with her gaze lowered (from Margaery\u2019s POV).</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>My father always told the truth.</i></p></blockquote><p>She lifts\nher gaze but it is clear that she isn\u2019t looking at either woman. <b>An avoidance\nof a gaze is often a defense mechanism. Sansa is scared and she doesn\u2019t trust\nthese women - and Olenna is making things worse by pressuring her since it is the\nway that Sansa\u2019s abusers also act.</b></p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>Yes, he had that reputation. And they named\nhim traitor and took his head.</i></p></blockquote><p>A close-up\nof Sansa\u2019s face, her gaze unfocused. She looks lost in thought and she looks so defeated.\nOleanna is handling her all wrong, now invoking the traumatic experience of her\nfather\u2019s death.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Joffrey\u2026</i></p></blockquote><p>Close-up of\nSansa. She looks at Olenna now, her expression is both angry and anguished.

Most of the dialogue is taken directly from the book\n(ASoS) and like in the show, Sansa is absolutely terrified throughout the whole\ninterview whilst Olenna keeps pressuring her. In the books, we know Sansa\u2019s\nthoughts because we are in her head \u2013 we see what she thinks and we feel what\nshe feels. <b>That kind of interiority cannot really be recreated on television\nwhere the audience is placed on the outside when it comes to the inner life of\nthe characters. Sansa\u2019s acute fear during this interview is conveyed entirely\nthrough Sophie Turner\u2019s acting: her facial expressions, her gestures and the\nmodulation of her voice.</b> It is fortunate that Turner is as talented as she is\nwhen it comes to non-verbal cues.</p><p>This entire\nscene makes me so sad for Sansa.

It is also a scene that I found much more disturbing during my re-watch than when I first watched in years ago.</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>SECRETS, LIES AND TRUTH - LUNCH WITH THE TYRELLS</b></p><p>In my metas about Margery Tyrell\u2019s season 3 arc (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179150770774/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>), I noted that she immediately made her presence felt in King\u2019s Landing through a clever deployment of soft power, which has secured her the goodwill of the common people. At the same time her grandmother Olenna, called the Queen of Thorns, conducts the more direct political negotiations with both Tywin and Tyrion Lannister. However, that is not all - in the very first episode it becomes clear that they are also taking an interest in Sansa, due to the disturbing rumours that they\u2019ve heard about Joffrey\u2019s abuse of her. Thus, they are quick to invite her to a private lunch in the lush gardens of the Red Keep.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"404\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb3cbf3761390613bd6411ff30b5495e/tumblr_inline_pjh4ac8yIY1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"404\"></figure><p>It is both sweet and a bit sad to see how happy and excited Sansa is that there are some people that want to spend time with her, who are initially kind to her and who even made the effort to find out what her favorite food is.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e74afd0b1442fa1830ab800818320650/tumblr_inline_pjh49xwzec1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\"></figure><p>Her hopeful little smile here shows how incredibly grateful she is that someone is seeking out her company and it really drives home just how isolated and lonely Sansa has been at the royal court - shunned by the people who have been standing idly by as she\u2019s been abused in public.\u00a0</p><p>She\u2019s being charmed by the Tyrells and you can see how she\u2019s beginning to think that things might change for her. Sadly, as Sansa, Olenna and Margaery sit down for a talk, it quickly becomes clear that the reason they have invited her to lunch is because they want something from her. It is worth watching the entire scene, especially the private conversation between the three women (timestamp; 2:22) because this conversation turns out to be rather traumatic for Sansa.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FsyFUIT_v3Pk%3Ft%3D142\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/syFUIT_v3Pk?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s happiness is shattered the moment that Olenna Tyrell asks her to tell the truth about Joffrey. This turn in the conversation makes\nSansa feel incredibly nervous and unsafe \u2013 she stammers and her eyes dart\nwildly about, as if she\u2019s looking for an escape.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I\u2026 I\u2026</i></p><p>Olenna: <i>You, you. Who else know better? We\u2019ve heard\nsome troubling tales. Is there any truth to them?</i></p></blockquote><p>Cut to a\nclose-up of Margaery, tilting her head, looking at Sansa. Then the camera cuts to a\nclose-up of Sansa who looks down, having lost her happy smile. She\u2019s clearly\nscared but perhaps also disappointed that these people have only sought out her\ncompany because they want something from her.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna\n(VO): <i>Has this boy mistreated you? \u2026</i><i>\u00a0Has he ripped out your tongue?</i></p></blockquote><p>Olenna really\ncomes across as a bully here, especially when you consider that Sansa is an\nabuse victim.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\n(stammers): <i>King Joffrey, His Grace is\nvery fair and handsome and as brave as a lion.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is clear\nthat Sansa is very uncomfortable and that she\u2019s lying. Sansa\u2019s response tells us that\nshe doesn\u2019t trust the Tyrells, and I also expect that she doesn\u2019t react well to\nOlenna pressuring her like that (it is too similar to the way her abusers demanding answers\nfrom her), which we\u2019ve seen in previous episodes. In fact, Olenna\u2019s method is reminiscent of how Cersei Lannister interacts with Sansa (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175999573309/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-9\">x</a>), except that Olenna is more directly aggressive than Cersei.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>Yes, all Lannisters are lions\u2026 But how kind\nis he? How clever? Has he a good heart? A gentle hand?</i></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/caecff9ab2042f91e57b1b159b105ed8/tumblr_inline_pkrjq6fype1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"></figure><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>I\u2019m to be his wife. I only want to know what\nthat means.</i></p></blockquote><p>I believe\nthat Margaery is honest here. Then we get an\u00a0OTS shot of\nMargaery, from Sansa\u2019s POV. The camera work reinforces the POV structure \u2013 we\nexperience this conversation mainly through Sansa point of view. The camera cuts to a close-up of\nSansa, her mouth is slightly open.\nThis is a reaction shot to Margaery\u2019s utterance. Sansa is hesitating, pondering whether she should tell Margaery the truth. Margaery\u2019s soft approach seems to\nwork better than Olenna\u2019s heavy-handed bullying. This moment, where\nSansa is on the brink of telling the truth about Joffrey, is ruined when a\nservant appears. <b>Sansa turns to look at\nhim \u2013 and when she turns back, her expression is closed-off!</b> She\u2019s afraid\nof being overheard \u2013 she knows that there are spies everywhere in the Red Keep.\nSansa lowers her head quickly and her gaze follows the retreating servant.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna\n(leaning forward towards Sansa): <i>Are you\nfrightened child? No need for that.</i></p></blockquote><p>She offers\nSansa a lemon cake \u2013 her favorite food \u2013 in an attempt to calm her down.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>We\u2019re only women here. Tell us the truth. No\nharm will come to you.</i></p></blockquote><p>OTS shot of\nSansa with her gaze lowered (from Margaery\u2019s POV).</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>My father always told the truth.</i></p></blockquote><p>She lifts\nher gaze but it is clear that she isn\u2019t looking at either woman. <b>An avoidance\nof a gaze is often a defense mechanism. Sansa is scared and she doesn\u2019t trust\nthese women - and Olenna is making things worse by pressuring her since it is the\nway that Sansa\u2019s abusers also act.</b></p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>Yes, he had that reputation. And they named\nhim traitor and took his head.</i></p></blockquote><p>A close-up\nof Sansa\u2019s face, her gaze unfocused. She looks lost in thought and she looks so defeated.\nOleanna is handling her all wrong, now invoking the traumatic experience of her\nfather\u2019s death.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Joffrey\u2026</i></p></blockquote><p>Close-up of\nSansa.

In my previous post I wrote that:<br></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nIf Sansa\u2019s season 2 arc was about enduring abuse, then her season 3 arc is dealing with hope of an escape - a hope held out by different political players of varying trustworthiness.\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>However, her season 3 arc is also very much about her political status as Robb Stark\u2019s heir apparent. In short, she has become the Key to the North and as such she\u2019s become an important piece on the political chessboard and to all the major political players in King\u2019s Landing and that is why Petyr Baelish, Lord Varys, Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells begin to take an interest in her. In this post I\u2019m going to take a closer look at her very first interactions with the members of House Tyrell, which is establishing itself as a major power player in the Game of Thrones. Sansa has several interactions with the Tyrells but in this post I\u2019ll limit my analysis to one scene in particular since it is interesting how the Tyrells at first are only interested in Sansa because they\u2019ve heard some disturbing rumours about King Joffrey, Margaery Tyrell\u2019s intended. It is also a scene that I found much more disturbing during my re-watch than when I first watched in years ago.</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>SECRETS, LIES AND TRUTH - LUNCH WITH THE TYRELLS</b></p><p>In my metas about Margery Tyrell\u2019s season 3 arc (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179150770774/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>), I noted that she immediately made her presence felt in King\u2019s Landing through a clever deployment of soft power, which has secured her the goodwill of the common people. At the same time her grandmother Olenna, called the Queen of Thorns, conducts the more direct political negotiations with both Tywin and Tyrion Lannister. However, that is not all - in the very first episode it becomes clear that they are also taking an interest in Sansa, due to the disturbing rumours that they\u2019ve heard about Joffrey\u2019s abuse of her. Thus, they are quick to invite her to a private lunch in the lush gardens of the Red Keep.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"404\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb3cbf3761390613bd6411ff30b5495e/tumblr_inline_pjh4ac8yIY1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"404\"></figure><p>It is both sweet and a bit sad to see how happy and excited Sansa is that there are some people that want to spend time with her, who are initially kind to her and who even made the effort to find out what her favorite food is.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e74afd0b1442fa1830ab800818320650/tumblr_inline_pjh49xwzec1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\"></figure><p>Her hopeful little smile here shows how incredibly grateful she is that someone is seeking out her company and it really drives home just how isolated and lonely Sansa has been at the royal court - shunned by the people who have been standing idly by as she\u2019s been abused in public.\u00a0</p><p>She\u2019s being charmed by the Tyrells and you can see how she\u2019s beginning to think that things might change for her. Sadly, as Sansa, Olenna and Margaery sit down for a talk, it quickly becomes clear that the reason they have invited her to lunch is because they want something from her. It is worth watching the entire scene, especially the private conversation between the three women (timestamp; 2:22) because this conversation turns out to be rather traumatic for Sansa.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FsyFUIT_v3Pk%3Ft%3D142\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/syFUIT_v3Pk?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s happiness is shattered the moment that Olenna Tyrell asks her to tell the truth about Joffrey. This turn in the conversation makes\nSansa feel incredibly nervous and unsafe \u2013 she stammers and her eyes dart\nwildly about, as if she\u2019s looking for an escape.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I\u2026 I\u2026</i></p><p>Olenna: <i>You, you. Who else know better? We\u2019ve heard\nsome troubling tales. Is there any truth to them?</i></p></blockquote><p>Cut to a\nclose-up of Margaery, tilting her head, looking at Sansa. Then the camera cuts to a\nclose-up of Sansa who looks down, having lost her happy smile. She\u2019s clearly\nscared but perhaps also disappointed that these people have only sought out her\ncompany because they want something from her.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna\n(VO): <i>Has this boy mistreated you? \u2026</i><i>\u00a0Has he ripped out your tongue?</i></p></blockquote><p>Olenna really\ncomes across as a bully here, especially when you consider that Sansa is an\nabuse victim.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\n(stammers): <i>King Joffrey, His Grace is\nvery fair and handsome and as brave as a lion.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is clear\nthat Sansa is very uncomfortable and that she\u2019s lying. Sansa\u2019s response tells us that\nshe doesn\u2019t trust the Tyrells, and I also expect that she doesn\u2019t react well to\nOlenna pressuring her like that (it is too similar to the way her abusers demanding answers\nfrom her), which we\u2019ve seen in previous episodes. In fact, Olenna\u2019s method is reminiscent of how Cersei Lannister interacts with Sansa (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175999573309/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-9\">x</a>), except that Olenna is more directly aggressive than Cersei.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>Yes, all Lannisters are lions\u2026 But how kind\nis he? How clever? Has he a good heart? A gentle hand?</i></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/caecff9ab2042f91e57b1b159b105ed8/tumblr_inline_pkrjq6fype1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"></figure><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>I\u2019m to be his wife. I only want to know what\nthat means.</i></p></blockquote><p>I believe\nthat Margaery is honest here. Then we get an\u00a0OTS shot of\nMargaery, from Sansa\u2019s POV. The camera work reinforces the POV structure \u2013 we\nexperience this conversation mainly through Sansa point of view. The camera cuts to a close-up of\nSansa, her mouth is slightly open.\nThis is a reaction shot to Margaery\u2019s utterance. Sansa is hesitating, pondering whether she should tell Margaery the truth. Margaery\u2019s soft approach seems to\nwork better than Olenna\u2019s heavy-handed bullying. This moment, where\nSansa is on the brink of telling the truth about Joffrey, is ruined when a\nservant appears. <b>Sansa turns to look at\nhim \u2013 and when she turns back, her expression is closed-off!</b> She\u2019s afraid\nof being overheard \u2013 she knows that there are spies everywhere in the Red Keep.\nSansa lowers her head quickly and her gaze follows the retreating servant.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna\n(leaning forward towards Sansa): <i>Are you\nfrightened child? No need for that.</i></p></blockquote><p>She offers\nSansa a lemon cake \u2013 her favorite food \u2013 in an attempt to calm her down.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>We\u2019re only women here. Tell us the truth. No\nharm will come to you.</i></p></blockquote><p>OTS shot of\nSansa with her gaze lowered (from Margaery\u2019s POV).</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>My father always told the truth.</i></p></blockquote><p>She lifts\nher gaze but it is clear that she isn\u2019t looking at either woman. <b>An avoidance\nof a gaze is often a defense mechanism. Sansa is scared and she doesn\u2019t trust\nthese women - and Olenna is making things worse by pressuring her since it is the\nway that Sansa\u2019s abusers also act.</b></p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>Yes, he had that reputation. And they named\nhim traitor and took his head.</i></p></blockquote><p>A close-up\nof Sansa\u2019s face, her gaze unfocused.

Most of the dialogue is taken directly from the book\n(ASoS) and like in the show, Sansa is absolutely terrified throughout the whole\ninterview whilst Olenna keeps pressuring her. In the books, we know Sansa\u2019s\nthoughts because we are in her head \u2013 we see what she thinks and we feel what\nshe feels. <b>That kind of interiority cannot really be recreated on television\nwhere the audience is placed on the outside when it comes to the inner life of\nthe characters.

She was so excited and delighted that someone\nwas seeking out her company, looking as though they would be kind to her \u2013 only\nfor her to realize that they want something from her. Even worse, Olenna\nbasically bullies Sansa into telling the truth about Joffrey and then they both\nshe and Margaery act rather cavalierly, as if the truth doesn\u2019t matter (or that\nis what it would look like to Sansa). <b>When they have finally gotten what they\nwanted, they continue as if nothing unusual has happened whilst Sansa just silently\nsits there, in emotional turmoil and bitterly disappointed.\u00a0</b></p><p><br></p><p>To be continued\u2026</p><p>(GIFs not mine)</p></p>",

Sansa has several interactions with the Tyrells but in this post I&rsquo;ll limit my analysis to one scene in particular since it is interesting how the Tyrells at first are only interested in Sansa because they&rsquo;ve heard some disturbing rumours about King Joffrey, Margaery Tyrell&rsquo;s intended. It is also a scene that I found much more disturbing during my re-watch than when I first watched in years ago.</p><p><b>SECRETS, LIES AND TRUTH - LUNCH WITH THE TYRELLS</b></p><p>In my metas about Margery Tyrell&rsquo;s season 3 arc (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179150770774/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>), I noted that she immediately made her presence felt in King&rsquo;s Landing through a clever deployment of soft power, which has secured her the goodwill of the common people. At the same time her grandmother Olenna, called the Queen of Thorns, conducts the more direct political negotiations with both Tywin and Tyrion Lannister. However, that is not all - in the very first episode it becomes clear that they are also taking an interest in Sansa, due to the disturbing rumours that they&rsquo;ve heard about Joffrey&rsquo;s abuse of her. Thus, they are quick to invite her to a private lunch in the lush gardens of the Red Keep.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb3cbf3761390613bd6411ff30b5495e/tumblr_inline_pjh4ac8yIY1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It is both sweet and a bit sad to see how happy and excited Sansa is that there are some people that want to spend time with her, who are initially kind to her and who even made the effort to find out what her favorite food is.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e74afd0b1442fa1830ab800818320650/tumblr_inline_pjh49xwzec1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Her hopeful little smile here shows how incredibly grateful she is that someone is seeking out her company and it really drives home just how isolated and lonely Sansa has been at the royal court - shunned by the people who have been standing idly by as she&rsquo;s been abused in public.&nbsp;</p><p>She&rsquo;s being charmed by the Tyrells and you can see how she&rsquo;s beginning to think that things might change for her. Sadly, as Sansa, Olenna and Margaery sit down for a talk, it quickly becomes clear that the reason they have invited her to lunch is because they want something from her. It is worth watching the entire scene, especially the private conversation between the three women (timestamp; 2:22) because this conversation turns out to be rather traumatic for Sansa.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p>Sansa&rsquo;s happiness is shattered the moment that Olenna Tyrell asks her to tell the truth about Joffrey. This turn in the conversation makes\nSansa feel incredibly nervous and unsafe &ndash; she stammers and her eyes dart\nwildly about, as if she&rsquo;s looking for an escape.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I&hellip; I&hellip;</i></p><p>Olenna: <i>You, you. Who else know better? We&rsquo;ve heard\nsome troubling tales. Is there any truth to them?</i></p></blockquote><p>Cut to a\nclose-up of Margaery, tilting her head, looking at Sansa. Then the camera cuts to a\nclose-up of Sansa who looks down, having lost her happy smile. She&rsquo;s clearly\nscared but perhaps also disappointed that these people have only sought out her\ncompany because they want something from her.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna\n(VO): <i>Has this boy mistreated you? &hellip;</i><i>&nbsp;Has he ripped out your tongue?</i></p></blockquote><p>Olenna really\ncomes across as a bully here, especially when you consider that Sansa is an\nabuse victim.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\n(stammers): <i>King Joffrey, His Grace is\nvery fair and handsome and as brave as a lion.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is clear\nthat Sansa is very uncomfortable and that she&rsquo;s lying. Sansa&rsquo;s response tells us that\nshe doesn&rsquo;t trust the Tyrells, and I also expect that she doesn&rsquo;t react well to\nOlenna pressuring her like that (it is too similar to the way her abusers demanding answers\nfrom her), which we&rsquo;ve seen in previous episodes. In fact, Olenna&rsquo;s method is reminiscent of how Cersei Lannister interacts with Sansa (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175999573309/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-9\">x</a>), except that Olenna is more directly aggressive than Cersei.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>Yes, all Lannisters are lions&hellip; But how kind\nis he? How clever? Has he a good heart? A gentle hand?</i></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/caecff9ab2042f91e57b1b159b105ed8/tumblr_inline_pkrjq6fype1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>I&rsquo;m to be his wife. I only want to know what\nthat means.</i></p></blockquote><p>I believe\nthat Margaery is honest here. Then we get an&nbsp;OTS shot of\nMargaery, from Sansa&rsquo;s POV. The camera work reinforces the POV structure &ndash; we\nexperience this conversation mainly through Sansa point of view. The camera cuts to a close-up of\nSansa, her mouth is slightly open.\nThis is a reaction shot to Margaery&rsquo;s utterance. Sansa is hesitating, pondering whether she should tell Margaery the truth. Margaery&rsquo;s soft approach seems to\nwork better than Olenna&rsquo;s heavy-handed bullying. This moment, where\nSansa is on the brink of telling the truth about Joffrey, is ruined when a\nservant appears. <b>Sansa turns to look at\nhim &ndash; and when she turns back, her expression is closed-off!</b> She&rsquo;s afraid\nof being overheard &ndash; she knows that there are spies everywhere in the Red Keep.\nSansa lowers her head quickly and her gaze follows the retreating servant.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna\n(leaning forward towards Sansa): <i>Are you\nfrightened child? No need for that.</i></p></blockquote><p>She offers\nSansa a lemon cake &ndash; her favorite food &ndash; in an attempt to calm her down.</p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>We&rsquo;re only women here. Tell us the truth. No\nharm will come to you.</i></p></blockquote><p>OTS shot of\nSansa with her gaze lowered (from Margaery&rsquo;s POV).</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>My father always told the truth.</i></p></blockquote><p>She lifts\nher gaze but it is clear that she isn&rsquo;t looking at either woman. <b>An avoidance\nof a gaze is often a defense mechanism. Sansa is scared and she doesn&rsquo;t trust\nthese women - and Olenna is making things worse by pressuring her since it is the\nway that Sansa&rsquo;s abusers also act.</b></p><blockquote><p>Olenna: <i>Yes, he had that reputation. And they named\nhim traitor and took his head.</i></p></blockquote><p>A close-up\nof Sansa&rsquo;s face, her gaze unfocused. She looks lost in thought and she looks so defeated.\nOleanna is handling her all wrong, now invoking the traumatic experience of her\nfather&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Joffrey&hellip;</i></p></blockquote><p>Close-up of\nSansa. She looks at Olenna now, her expression is both angry and anguished. Her\neyes move, shifting her gaze to Margaery.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd376eff5abbd5214aa93c2f9dbb5e88/tumblr_inline_pkr4phmSJV1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99eb21a7e25212bcc3328c01bdd37d43/tumblr_inline_pkr4rggAQD1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d7ae98810ff6a2f0f8d71110ca530dd/tumblr_inline_pkr4rzsH5a1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\n\n(GIF set by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/midOTmSBVMT5qTe8e_DQOBQ\">@aryaestarks</a>)\n\n<br /></p><p>Her lip\nquivers, she&rsquo;s close to tears.

Once again Sansa had her hopes lifted only to have them smashed.&nbsp;</p><p>This scene\nis, in many ways, very close to how it plays out in the book (though with less\ncharacters present). Most of the dialogue is taken directly from the book\n(ASoS) and like in the show, Sansa is absolutely terrified throughout the whole\ninterview whilst Olenna keeps pressuring her. In the books, we know Sansa&rsquo;s\nthoughts because we are in her head &ndash; we see what she thinks and we feel what\nshe feels. <b>That kind of interiority cannot really be recreated on television\nwhere the audience is placed on the outside when it comes to the inner life of\nthe characters. Sansa&rsquo;s acute fear during this interview is conveyed entirely\nthrough Sophie Turner&rsquo;s acting: her facial expressions, her gestures and the\nmodulation of her voice.</b> It is fortunate that Turner is as talented as she is\nwhen it comes to non-verbal cues.</p><p>This entire\nscene makes me so sad for Sansa. She was so excited and delighted that someone\nwas seeking out her company, looking as though they would be kind to her &ndash; only\nfor her to realize that they want something from her. Even worse, Olenna\nbasically bullies Sansa into telling the truth about Joffrey and then they both\nshe and Margaery act rather cavalierly, as if the truth doesn&rsquo;t matter (or that\nis what it would look like to Sansa). <b>When they have finally gotten what they\nwanted, they continue as if nothing unusual has happened whilst Sansa just silently\nsits there, in emotional turmoil and bitterly disappointed.&nbsp;</b></p><p><br /></p><p>To be continued&hellip;</p><p>(GIFs not mine)</p></p>",

In my previous post I wrote that:<br /></p>\n<blockquote><p><i>\n\nIf Sansa&rsquo;s season 2 arc was about enduring abuse, then her season 3 arc is dealing with hope of an escape - a hope held out by different political players of varying trustworthiness.\n\n</i><br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>However, her season 3 arc is also very much about her political status as Robb Stark&rsquo;s heir apparent. In short, she has become the Key to the North and as such she&rsquo;s become an important piece on the political chessboard and to all the major political players in King&rsquo;s Landing and that is why Petyr Baelish, Lord Varys, Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells begin to take an interest in her.

Her marriage of Harry the Heir is meant to tie her to the Vale so that she can be given an army to take back the kingdom she has an actual claim to. The reason she\u2019s not marrying SR but SR\u2019s heir is because he is too young. The reason Sansa accepts the inevitability of SR\u2019s death is because SR is a sickly child. If being afraid of Littlefinger forces her to ignore all of that so that she can pretend she doesn\u2019t know about the poisoning of SR, then that\u2019s a new trait in Sansa because she has been in constant danger since the end of book 1 and that didn\u2019t stop her for helping and protecting people. She was assaulted by rioters and she still wanted to give them bread. She spoke up for Dontos, she warned Margaery about Joffrey. Sansa is much braver than people give her credit for and much more lucid. If you believe that side of the fandom then you\u2019d think Sansa spends half her time being an unreliable narrator.

People think her putting up boundaries between the two of them is hate and a sign that she would OK with his death are wrong. She wants him to grow up and marry. She carries him down the mountain despite the danger. Sansa doesn\u2019t want this child hurt and she\u2019s brave enough to stand up to Littlefinger if he tries to kill him in front of her.

        "answer": "<p>Pretty much. I would never say dads irl never go unappreciated and they definitely deserve as much respect as moms, but society does often praise them for doing the bare minimum at times, and that&rsquo;s ridiculously easy to do in a place like Westeros where nobody but the abused kid bats an eye at being chained to a wall to make you &ldquo;man up&rdquo;. </p><p>Ned was busy on his investigation, yes, but&hellip; so? All the more reason to ensure his daughters had more protection since he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to. People say he was used to Sansa being obedient and had no idea she would go to Cersei. Well, if he took five minutes to spend any time with her, he might notice that not only is Sansa growing up, but she&rsquo;s started her rebellious teen phase right before his eyes (thanks in no small part to his double standards with Arya). </p><p>Oh, and I love that <i>Cat</i> is a horrible parent for &ldquo;nagging&rdquo; Robb (translation: telling him what&rsquo;s what even if he&rsquo;s too much of a teenager to appreciate that she&rsquo;s right) when she should be back in the kitchen wiping Rickon&rsquo;s little nose and leaving the war stuff for the menfolk to handle, as if the Starks don&rsquo;t have a castle full of perfectly competent servants who love the boys and as if Robb isn&rsquo;t badly in need of competent advisors he can trust.
