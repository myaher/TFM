Tony could see how tired she was, she had bags under her eyes and a red puffy nose. \u201cI keep telling them I\u2019m fine\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis does not sound fine to me\u201d Nat countered as Peter walked over and took a seat on the foot of the hospital bed.

The nurse processed the information and gave her a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll get a doctor in here as soon as I can\u201d she smiled before walking out. Tony turned to y/n and raised his eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you called them\u201d she muttered over to the teenage boy who was scrolling through his phone. He shrugged and looked over to Tony for help.</p><p>\u201cNo, no don\u2019t blame him he found you unconscious. You should be thanking him for calling us\u2019\u2019 tony pointed as y/n rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust wait until Steve gets here\u2019\u2019 nat snickered, y/n\u2019s eyes widened as she leaned forward and snapped her head to peter.</p><p>\u201cYou called Steve?\u2019\u2019 she asked, Peter\u2019s mouth hung open, his eyes darted between her and Nat\u2019s who had a sly smirk on her face. \u201cHe\u2019s on a mission\u201d, she finished as she exhaled sharply from the pain and brought her hand to her forehead. Before she could say anything one of the doctors walked in and smiled at all of them, quickly recognizing Tony who just gave him a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cMs. Y/L/N, I\u2019m doctor Dorian, I\u2019m here to go over your prognosis.\u201d he introduced himself as he stood in front of the bed. \u201cLooks like you have a very simple case of appendicitis, but we\u2019re going to order a CT scan to make sure. We\u2019ll go from there\u201d he explained as she nodded and sighed.</p><p>The doctor excused himself, Tony gave her a reassuring smile before taking a seat on the small recliner in the corner of the room. She wasn\u2019t too worried about her health, Steve, however, that was a whole different story. Y/n sighed and closed her eyes thinking about the show Steve would put on when he arrived.</p><p>*</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until a couple hours after the doctor had first come in that the reality of her pain sunk in. Even on a morphine drip, she felt every single ounce of pain. Nat had to leave and fix a problem at the tower, Peter and tony on the other hand were her \u201cpain support buddies\u201d- as Peter had jokingly put it.</p><p>By the time the actual pain kicked in, Peter and Tony really wanted to get out of the room. Every time the pain came she would squeeze either of their arms and Peter for sure thought she was going to. By the time the doctor came back, he came bearing the news that she would need surgery.</p><p>\u201cJust give me more pain meds\u2019\u2019 she spoke, her voice low and raspy from the pain. The doctor glanced between her and Tony who shook his head \u201cCan it go away on its own?\u2019\u2019 she asked as she shifted her weight and let go of Peter\u2019s arm. Quickly Peter took his arm and rubbed it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not an option Ms. Y/L/N\u2019\u2019 he reasoned, Tony sighed and walked towards the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll get a nurse to help prep you for the surgery, won\u2019t take too long. I\u2019ll be back in a bit\u2019\u2019 he announced as she gave him a nod and turned to Tony.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Rogers will be here soon, you just go in there and you get better Y/n\u2019\u2019 Tony spoke as he placed his hand on her head. Peter gave her a small smile and a reassuring nod.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she breathed out and brought her hand up to her nose and gave it a scratch. \u201cBut I\u2019m gonna be complaining the whole time afterward\u2019\u2019 she sighed as she shifted in the bed, Peter chuckled and put a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIf he gets here before, we\u2019ll calm him down\u2019\u2019 Peter reassured making her nod and wince at another sharp pain. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>When y/n awoke, she felt sore all over. She turned her head to the side and glanced down to her arm and noticed the IV in her arm. The slight beeping of the monitors above her head. She tried to move but felt pain on her right side. HIssing at the pain she laid her head back on the pillow and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u2019\u2019 she heard a whisper, a voice she knew so well. Turning she saw Steve standing next to the bed with a small smile on his face. He leaned in and placed a kiss on her forehead, she hummed in response with a smile of her own. \u201cGave me quite the scare there\u2019\u2019 he whispered, a small chuckle following.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u2019\u2019 she responded, her voice low and raspy. Steve shook his head and place his hand on hers \u201cI should probably schedule my next organ removal when you\u2019re not on a mission\u2019\u2019 she jokingly added making Steve laugh lowly and lean in to place his lips on hers and gave her a quick peck.</p><p>\u201cYeah, please do\u2019\u2019 he finished making her roll her eyes and lean back.</p></p>",
