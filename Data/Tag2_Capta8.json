So this stuff gets old very quickly. Even the bits I like, it\u2019s not so much I \u201cenjoy\u201d them as it is I don\u2019t want to actively claw my eyes out when they play. Even the different Captain Marvel spots are little more than a couple minutes of zero irritation floating at the back of my mind.</p><p>Until earlier this week, when a tiny boy that couldn\u2019t have been older than a year and a half, <i>maybe</i> two years old, noticed the Captain Marvel movie/companion book ad on the big screen. His eyes lit up and he punched his fist into the air in his best superhero pose, giving a little \u201c<i>raahhh!</i>\u201d as he tried to copy the moves Carol was doing onscreen. This went on for the duration of the ad, this little boy hopping around and waving his arms like he was fighting off bad guys, like I\u2019ve seen other kids do when they see Superman or Spider-Man. I was grinning like an idiot the entire time.</p><p>And even later, a woman came up to buy something from the desk with her son in the basket of her cart, probably seven or eight years old. She began her transaction as the same CM spot came on, and the boy twisted around to watch it, chanting \u201c<i>Cap-tain Mar-vel! Cap-tain Mar-vel!</i>\u201d, something that would have been super irritating if I wasn\u2019t so over-the-moon about not one but two little boys outwardly adoring this badass superhero.
