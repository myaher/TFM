Then she went blind, then went back to be Cat of the Canals and living at Bursco\u2019s, then joined Izembaro\u2019s troupe. All of that before we got the chapter with Sam joining the Citadel.</p><p>I think according to the original plan she should have been 15 in Mercy because her role has becoming more mature - Arya is seducing Raff before killing him. \u2018Mercy\u2019 parallels the prologue to AFFC to some extend. In the prologue another young femme fatale, Rosey, brings Pate to his doom. Rosey is a beautiful girl everyone wants. Arya is already a head-turner at 12. Pate loves Rosey. Jaqen becomes Pate. Jaqen will fall for Arya. If \u2018Mercy\u2019 had been in AFFC as planned the parallel would have been more obvious.\u00a0</p><p>Of course Dany has means to conquer the world and will certainly try. She has already achieved a lot and we should remember she started off as basically a beggar. But we know GRRM loves big revelations and surprises. There\u2019s a reason why he\u2019s giving us two more books :)\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

If you are a fan of Throne of Glass I\u2019m just going to say that I got a bad impression of Celaena from the first book, so it might be an inaccurate representation. Just a warning.</p><p>PLOT SUMMARY: Celaena arrives in Winterfell due to an unknown twist of events.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"376\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"callumogden:bi8aZ8IpbLW1p17O0SU7CQ:Zlsmcn2VhJNqN\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d51fabbf0c960c4b35218fdb2fa7d0d8/tumblr_p4yzuncnrn1taio7ko1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"376\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Celaena sat shivering in the damp corner of her cell.<br/></p><p><br/>She hadn&rsquo;t seen the sun in days beyond count. The stolid guard posted outside her cell had not taken the trouble to answer most of her questions either, and when she threatened him he did not even reply. The only answers he gave her made her want to scream. How dare he! If she could, she would have throttled something out of him by now.<br/><br/>It was just her usual rotten luck that she could not grab him through the bars with the fetters she wore around her wrists. She thought about striking them against the wall, but figured grudgingly that that would reap no benefit. Annoyed, she hugged her knees closer to her chest in the hopes that he would notice that she was freezing, but the guard paid her no mind.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Brrr,&rdquo; She trilled, still waiting, yet he pretended as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard.<br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; Celaena finally blurted.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Best get used to it, lass. Winter is coming, and with it the monsters from beyond The Wall.&rdquo; The guard did not even turn around. &ldquo;Until then, may the gods save us all.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Fetch me a cloak.&rdquo; She cared not for his pathetic fears.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Lord Eddard Stark commanded me to watch you, not to do as you bid.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Ugh. How she hated this man. Ever since she had been thrown down here into this hovel of a cell, JoryCassel had given only his name, and then nothing but pointless matters. Early on, she had tried to coy him into freeing her by speaking to him seductively and leaning brazenly against the bars- which was as close as she could be to him- yet it somehow hadn&rsquo;t worked. How could it not, when she was so beautiful? It was simply that Jory Cassel could not be persuaded, she supposed.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she announced, getting onto her hands and knees and trying a different track. &ldquo;How good are you with a sword?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Not \u00a0'ser&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m not a knight. Besides, I should think myself to be capable.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Could you try me?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;I am not commanded to do your bidding.&rdquo;<br/><br/>That again. She sighed audibly. Going back to staring at the grimy walls, she wondered how she would break out of here. If they allowed her a tool of some sort, Celaena thought, she could overpower Jory and get past him easily. He had been standing here like a statue all day after all, but during the night shifts, he would swap places with Hallis Mollen to get some rest, so neither of them ever fell asleep at their post. They didn&rsquo;t dare open her door to give her food either: the gritty bowls of gruel were served to her between the bars of her cell. Even if she did somehow escape, there was the matter of guards outside, for there were bound to be plenty to man the gates and walls of this place.<br/><br/>At least this Lord Eddard Stark had thought to charge only his best guards to keep watch over her. It seemed someone knew her prowess after all, and did not want to underestimate her. She&rsquo;d nearly slain one of the men in the black cloaks she had come across when she first came here, trudging through heavy snow, and it had taken a host of five men to knock her silent. After that incident, she&rsquo;d woken up here with no idea of where she was. Jory told her only that she was in a dungeon (&ldquo;what did you expect for assaulting a man of the Night&rsquo;s Watch?&rdquo;).<br/><br/>The sound of descending footsteps echoed on the stairwell. Celaena looked up, expecting to see the rough face of Hallis Mollen come around the corner, but was surprised to see a stout keg of a knight with magnificent white whiskers approach instead.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Lord Eddard has commanded the girl to be brought before him.&rdquo; Said the knight to Jory. &ldquo;See that she&rsquo;s properly chained before you take her to his lordship&rsquo;s court, and tell her nothing even if she asks.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Jory nodded. &ldquo;Get up.&rdquo; He told Celaena as the other man left, and she did so sulkily. He unlocked the door and tugged on her chains to make sure they held, then made her march up the stairs ahead of him so that her fetters rattled noisily. She saw the tip of his spear hovering a little behind her back, and she turned her body a little to the side so she could choke Jory'swindpipe with her chains.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Best not do that,&rdquo; he warned, poking the spear into her back.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know I could snap that puny spear in one move,&rdquo; Celaena shot back, and Jory raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to snap quite a bit,&rdquo; he said in a surprised voice, &ldquo;And get round the spear itself if I don&rsquo;t impale you first, but no matter. I will not stand here idly while Lord Eddard awaits us. Either you move, or I&rsquo;ll push you.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Adarlan guards always used swords to escort her, Calaena thought, so she couldn&rsquo;t see why she should not grab the spear away. She tried to twist and grab it, but the metal point grazed her side as she did so. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; She squeaked.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Handy things, eh, spears?&rdquo; Jory asked her, grinning. &ldquo;Best move now then.&rdquo;<br/><br/>She was led down a series of corridors made of stone walls, heated from the inside by an unknown source. Oaken doors could be seen across the passages, and the occasional window let in a cold, winter light. Sometimes Celaena could see a tapestry or two: each white in colour, depicting a loping grey wolf embroidered in fine silk. WINTER IS COMING, read the words on the end of each one. Calaena wondered how terrible the winters here might really be.<br/><br/>Then Jory&rsquo;s spear turned her left, and she entered a corridor that ended in a small archway. Passing under the archway she entered a crowded hall, filled withpeople dressed in furs of grey, brown or white. The room itself was lit only by a wooden chandelier hanging from the ceiling, and a few lancet windows let in tall slits of light. Guards, some servants and a few other men stood by the door at the end of the hall, whilst six children whispered amongst each other beside the high table. An old man dressed in grey robes and a pretty, middle aged woman with auburn hair and blue eyes sat on either side of a high backed chair, but it was vacant. How dingy this is. Celaena thought. She expected this building to be the grand castle she guessed it was, but this dim hall failed to reach her expectations. The only thing she knew about it was that it was called Winterfell, though Jory had not disclosed any more than that.<br/><br/>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the person who tried to kill a man from the Night&rsquo;s Watch, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She heard one of the children whisper as she entered. It was a little horse faced girl who looked to be about ten years old, and was hardly much to look at. &ldquo;Fat Tom told me the other day that she appeared out of nowhere.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Nowhere,&rdquo; echoed her toddler brother.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Will you shut up?&rdquo; Asked their older sister. She was a pretty looking girl with the auburn hair and blue eyes of the woman at the high table. The younger girl looked as if she would hit her sister, but a nudge from her brother, who was perhaps fifteen, made her shut up and look sour instead.<br/><br/>Then with the sound of rumbling doors, a middle aged man with cold grey eyes entered the hall. &ldquo;All kneel for Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North,&rdquo; called the herald, and the hall knelt.<br/><br/>The Lord of Winterfell cleared his throat. Celaenastudied his brown hair and cold grey eyes as he regarded her sharply, wondering if this man was any good. She knew she ought to kneel, but decided not to out of defiance.<br/><br/>&ldquo;My lord&hellip;?&rdquo; Jory looked up.<br/><br/>&ldquo;No need.&rdquo; Lord Eddard looked down upon Celaena. &ldquo;Whence did you come from, girl?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell you that.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Your name, then.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Celaena Sardothien.&rdquo; She smirked, waiting for a shocked reaction at the sound of Adarlan&rsquo;s most famous assassin, but no one even so much as gasped. Lord Eddard turned to discuss with the old man sitting next to him. She didn&rsquo;t know who he was, because no one had bothered to tell her (the nerve of them!), So she studied the auburn haired woman beside Lord Eddard. She must be the lord&rsquo;s wife, and the six children must be theirs. But she noticed another boy, who looked to be older than them all. He was handsome and blonde, but did not share the features of the Starks. He looked at her and gave her a charming smirk, which she did not return.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lord Eddard and the old man had finished their discussion. &ldquo;You do not seem to come from here.&rdquo; The old man said from the high table. &ldquo;Do you know of this place, or who you are being presented to?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Well, maybe if someone had bothered to tell me I would have known.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;You speak to Eddard of House Stark, lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North.&rdquo; Eddard Stark spoke for him. &ldquo;You stand in the hall of Winterfell, the northernmost of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Here we are ruled by King Robert Baratheon, and his Queen Cersei Lannister. From whence do you hail?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;My name is Celaena.&rdquo; It was the only thing she felt they had the right to know.<br/><br/>&ldquo;As you wish. You are aware of why you were imprisoned?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;If that was hurting some man, I don&rsquo;t regret it at all.&rdquo; Celaena smirked. &ldquo;What are you going to do anyways? Throw me in a dungeon again?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;If that is needed, it will be done. But at the moment, you do not seem too dangerous against the strength of twenty guards, and that will be considered.&rdquo; Lord Eddard&rsquo;s voice echoed in the cold, stone hall. &ldquo;If freedom of the castle is what you wish, it will be given, but with strict restrictions. If you wish to listen to these terms then do so. But if not, your other option is the dungeons under the watch of guards whilst you await further sentencing.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Celaena shrugged prettily.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Maester Luwin?&rdquo; Lord Eddard turned to the old man.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The terms you are offered are as follows.&rdquo; \u00a0The old man continued on, leaning forwards in his seat. &ldquo;That you may go about the castle as you please, provided that you are under the watch of one of the castle guard at all times, and that you do not harm, assault or harass any of the occupants within WinterfellCastle. You may not depart unless by leave of Lord Eddard Stark himself, and if you are caught, you will be faced with harsh punishment. Do you consent to these terms?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Nothing was fair around here. Celaena wanted to say that she disagreed to all these terms and that she would rather leave back to her own, much better kingdom, thank you very much, but she knew enough that if she did not agree it would take her back to the dungeons again.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo; She flipped her hair over her shoulder.<br/><br/>And she was free. For then.<br/><br/>&hellip;.<br/><br/>The blonde boy stood before the archery butts, loosing an arrow at one of the targets.<br/><br/>Celaena watched it fly from his fingers. With a solid thunk! The tip met the center of the target, embedding deep into the straw to join a cluster of arrows already clustered about the center. Theon Greyjoy, the blonde boy, grinned at the result of his shot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>&ldquo;You could do better.&rdquo; Calaena said.<br/><br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll address me as &lsquo;my lord&rsquo;.&rdquo; He reprimanded arrogantly. &ldquo;And besides, what makes you think you can do better?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen better.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done better.&rdquo;<br/><br/>How self centered of him, when he obviously knew nothing about her own skill and that he was in danger just standing before her. She had to admit that he was handsome, but Maester Luwin had warned her against Theon and who he was, though she did not think him to be of any threat. \u00a0He glanced at her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the look of that smirk, by the way.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;Take it off.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;What else do you require, my lord?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Your clothes, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Before she could react, the little horse faced girl she had seen in court yesterday darted between them and took the bow from Theon. &ldquo;My turn.&rdquo; She insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching long enough.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy, Arya, not now. Go and ask Jon or Robb if you really want to shoot. But I thought you ought to be with Sansa.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Sansa&rsquo;s stupid. I want to shoot.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s going to be looking after you.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Who cares about that?&rdquo; Arya asked, taking the bow from Theon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of being cooped up inside.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Alright, but don&rsquo;t tell me when Septa Mordane calls you back,&rdquo; Theon consented, but as if on cue a woman&rsquo;s voice shouted from across the grounds: &ldquo;Arya!&rdquo;<br/><br/>That must be Septa Mordane, Celaena thought. The woman who came pointedly across the grounds was dressed in a caul and grey robes, and had wide hips that made her sway briskly as she bustled across the yard. &ldquo;You are meant to be practising needlework, not playing at weapons.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; Arya protested as Septa Mordane led her away. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you be a little more like your sister?&rdquo; The Septa muttered. &ldquo;Come along, Arya. It&rsquo;s time you were downstairs.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;&hellip;But it&rsquo;s boring. And I don&rsquo;t care if Sansa wants to. It&rsquo;s stupid&hellip;&rdquo;<br/><br/>Septa Mordane led her off. Theon raised an eyebrow as he watched them go. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lucky wench.&rdquo; He told Celaena. &ldquo;At least you don&rsquo;t have to do needlework all day. I heard nothing that restricted you from the weapons around here.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Oh, how much she wanted to feel the grip of a sword again. &ldquo;Got anyone who&rsquo;ll try me?&rdquo; She asked daringly.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Robb&rsquo;s busy with Jon, and Bran and Rickon are too young,&rdquo; Theon said. &ldquo;If you ask nicely though and don&rsquo;t kill him first, Ser Rodrik might spar with you. He&rsquo;s by the stables.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Celaena could hardly believe this arrogance towards her. She, the most notorious assassin in all of Adarlan! At least once she beat Ser Rodrik they might see she was to he feared after all. She bid good morrow to Theon and went to seek out the stout knight.<br/><br/>&hellip;<br/><br/>The yard rang with the clash of steel.<br/><br/>Calaena raised her blade to block Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s blow. The old knight was less agile then she&ndash; that was to be expected&ndash; but he fought well for a man of his age and build. He was not Chaol Westfall: young, sturdily built and handsome, but this was fair competition besides. She had only been allowed a tourney blade though, which dented her pride. Wasn&rsquo;t she the best assassin in all of Adarlan?<br/><br/>&ldquo;Move your feet.&rdquo; Jory said from across the grounds. He had been watching intently since they had begun, and since then he had hardly moved from his position on the wooden bench. Calaena hefted her sword to aim for Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s belly, covered in a layer of wool and and quilted gambeson, and quite obvious. It was fair enough in size, she judged. The hit should come easy.<br/><br/>Then a raven took flight from the ground, and the sound of its wings flapping startled her. Ser Rodrikknocked her blade to the ground where it spun for a while and then skidded to a halt. &ldquo;You were too emotional.&rdquo; He told her, picking up the sword and returning it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anger betray your skill.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;And what would you know of fighting, if you&rsquo;re so old?&rdquo; Celaena snapped, picking her blade back up off the ground and polishing it with her modest tunic.<br/><br/>&ldquo;More than you.&rdquo; Ser Rodrik looked to be suppressing a grin. &ldquo;Old knights live as long as they do for a reason, Celaena.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Might be their knees give way on the battlefield if they do.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Mine own have not yet,&rdquo; Ser Rodrik said in a measured voice, &ldquo;but you seem to want for younger competition, not the likes of men as old as I. Would you like that?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; She wanted to see the younger men, those who were a prettier sight to look at. Someone handsome would be more deserving for the likes of her. Here in Winterfell there were hardly any men half so good looking as those back at Adarlan, as much as she hated to admit it. Only Robb Stark and Jon Snow, the eldest of Lord Eddard&rsquo;s sons, could ever meet the dashing countenances of Adarlan men. She almost missed them.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Show me someone younger,&rdquo; she demanded.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Why not my nephew, then?&rdquo; Ser Rodrik asked. &ldquo;I should like to test his skill against the&hellip; ah&hellip; best assassin in the Adarlan kingdom, as you claim yourself to be. At least, we shall see if that is true when compared to the warriors of the Westerosi North. I always wondered about my nephew&rsquo;s skill, though I don&rsquo;t doubt it. Would you like that?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Calaena said, but was surprised when Jory Cassel stood up from the bench with a small smile.<br/><br/>It was then that she realized that Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s surname was also Cassel.<br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; She whined, as Jory took Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s sword. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to fight him, \u00a0I wanted to fight with someone&ndash;&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;&ndash;Your age, as you said.&rdquo; Ser Rodrik finished for her. &ldquo;My nephew is one of the men on hand closest to your age, and I doubt you&rsquo;re so many years younger than he is. Theon would be closer, though he is occupied at the moment. So, do you wish to spar with Jory or not? Or I could do it again if you like.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Whatever. Celaena knew she could best even the most skilled in Adarlan. If that was true, she could best anyone here in this Westeros. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find yourself sprawling in the dust,&rdquo; she spat, as Jory bent into a stance. &ldquo;I bet I could win against the greatest fighter in this kingdom of I wanted to.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The best fighter in the land is Ser Jaime Lannister, lass. Ten times better than me, and ten times as dishonourable.&rdquo; Jory&rsquo;s smile windened further. &ldquo;I wish you luck if you ever meet the Kingslayer on the field, but as of yet he is far away in King&rsquo;s Landing, and I should hope that he stays there. For now though, shall we begin?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Celaena growled in annoyance. Now she&rsquo;d let him see exactly how good she was, and she would not stop until he was grovelling on the ground and begging for quarter.<br/><br/>She lunged, and Jory swiped at her head, the suddenness of his movement making a breeze ruffle her hair. She ducked and lunged at his chest, but his blade met hers and her blow was batted away.<br/><br/>Calaena gritted her teeth. She would allow herself gritted her teeth. She would allow herself to toy with him for a bit longer, but now she would let him see her true strength. She met his next move with a swift block, and the swords made a cross as they came into the bind. He was faster in coming out of it though, and pushed her blade in a downward circle until it was forced out of her hands into the ground again, and the tip of his sword pointed straight at her stomach.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Never underestimate your enemy.&rdquo; Jory gave her back her sword, and she felt like snapping his spine over her knee. &ldquo;Overestimating yourself will not come to your advantage either.&rdquo;<br/><br/>If she had only been faster! Her reflexes had been as fast as a cat&rsquo;s when she had been in Adarlan, but the grimy Winterfell dungeons had slowed her down. Turning, she protested this to Jory and Ser Rodrik, but they paid her no attention. The idiots. She surveyed her surroundings instead, wondering again if there was any possible way of escaping.<br/><br/>A small figure scaling the stable walls caught her eye: Brandon Stark, Lord Eddard&rsquo;s six year old son. She had heard his name being called by the Maester only a few days ago as he was being led away to a lesson. Now the boy had reached the castle wall, and he was, of present, being reprimanded by a guard. She had never seen a boy climb so quickly.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Ah, young Bran Stark,&rdquo; chuckled a man nearby. &ldquo;He better be glad Lady Catelyn didn&rsquo;t catch him this time round.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s a squirrel.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A squirrel indeed. Yet it seemed the boy would not be able to leave the castle by climbing either. He was climbing down now, making annoyed exclamations as he went. Celaena supposed she would have to find some other way to get out. After all, she had hardly explored the entirety of Winterfell. It was just the guards who stopped her from doing so. And if she could survive the Endovier salt mines, she could survive this. She began to walk towards the stable wall to inspect the footholds Bran had used, but someone caught her by the arm.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it,&rdquo; said Hallis Mollen&rsquo;s voice.<br/><br/>His eyes followed her as she wrenched her arm away. There was the slightest bit of intrigue in his eyes, but his sentinel-like face made her know he was watching her. Every corner she turned would have a guard in the shadows, and there was no chance she would be let out of their sight. She narrowed her own sapphire blue eyes at him and stalked away.</p>",

Even if she did somehow escape, there was the matter of guards outside, for there were bound to be plenty to man the gates and walls of this place.<br><br>At least this Lord Eddard Stark had thought to charge only his best guards to keep watch over her. It seemed someone knew her prowess after all, and did not want to underestimate her. She\u2019d nearly slain one of the men in the black cloaks she had come across when she first came here, trudging through heavy snow, and it had taken a host of five men to knock her silent. After that incident, she\u2019d woken up here with no idea of where she was. Jory told her only that she was in a dungeon (\u201cwhat did you expect for assaulting a man of the Night\u2019s Watch?\u201d).<br><br>The sound of descending footsteps echoed on the stairwell. Celaena looked up, expecting to see the rough face of Hallis Mollen come around the corner, but was surprised to see a stout keg of a knight with magnificent white whiskers approach instead.<br><br>\u201cLord Eddard has commanded the girl to be brought before him.\u201d Said the knight to Jory. \u201cSee that she\u2019s properly chained before you take her to his lordship\u2019s court, and tell her nothing even if she asks.\u201d<br><br>Jory nodded. \u201cGet up.\u201d He told Celaena as the other man left, and she did so sulkily. He unlocked the door and tugged on her chains to make sure they held, then made her march up the stairs ahead of him so that her fetters rattled noisily. She saw the tip of his spear hovering a little behind her back, and she turned her body a little to the side so she could choke Jory'swindpipe with her chains.<br><br>\u201cBest not do that,\u201d he warned, poking the spear into her back.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I could snap that puny spear in one move,\u201d Celaena shot back, and Jory raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019d have to snap quite a bit,\u201d he said in a surprised voice, \u201cAnd get round the spear itself if I don\u2019t impale you first, but no matter. I will not stand here idly while Lord Eddard awaits us. Either you move, or I\u2019ll push you.\u201d<br><br>Adarlan guards always used swords to escort her, Calaena thought, so she couldn\u2019t see why she should not grab the spear away. She tried to twist and grab it, but the metal point grazed her side as she did so. \u201cOw!\u201d She squeaked.<br><br>\u201cHandy things, eh, spears?\u201d Jory asked her, grinning. \u201cBest move now then.\u201d<br><br>She was led down a series of corridors made of stone walls, heated from the inside by an unknown source. Oaken doors could be seen across the passages, and the occasional window let in a cold, winter light. Sometimes Celaena could see a tapestry or two: each white in colour, depicting a loping grey wolf embroidered in fine silk. WINTER IS COMING, read the words on the end of each one. Calaena wondered how terrible the winters here might really be.<br><br>Then Jory\u2019s spear turned her left, and she entered a corridor that ended in a small archway. Passing under the archway she entered a crowded hall, filled withpeople dressed in furs of grey, brown or white. The room itself was lit only by a wooden chandelier hanging from the ceiling, and a few lancet windows let in tall slits of light. Guards, some servants and a few other men stood by the door at the end of the hall, whilst six children whispered amongst each other beside the high table. An old man dressed in grey robes and a pretty, middle aged woman with auburn hair and blue eyes sat on either side of a high backed chair, but it was vacant. How dingy this is. Celaena thought. She expected this building to be the grand castle she guessed it was, but this dim hall failed to reach her expectations. The only thing she knew about it was that it was called Winterfell, though Jory had not disclosed any more than that.<br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s the person who tried to kill a man from the Night\u2019s Watch, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She heard one of the children whisper as she entered. It was a little horse faced girl who looked to be about ten years old, and was hardly much to look at. \u201cFat Tom told me the other day that she appeared out of nowhere.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNowhere,\u201d echoed her toddler brother.<br><br>\u201cWill you shut up?\u201d Asked their older sister. She was a pretty looking girl with the auburn hair and blue eyes of the woman at the high table. The younger girl looked as if she would hit her sister, but a nudge from her brother, who was perhaps fifteen, made her shut up and look sour instead.<br><br>Then with the sound of rumbling doors, a middle aged man with cold grey eyes entered the hall. \u201cAll kneel for Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North,\u201d called the herald, and the hall knelt.<br><br>The Lord of Winterfell cleared his throat. Celaenastudied his brown hair and cold grey eyes as he regarded her sharply, wondering if this man was any good. She knew she ought to kneel, but decided not to out of defiance.<br><br>\u201cMy lord\u2026?\u201d Jory looked up.<br><br>\u201cNo need.\u201d Lord Eddard looked down upon Celaena. \u201cWhence did you come from, girl?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYour name, then.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s Celaena Sardothien.\u201d She smirked, waiting for a shocked reaction at the sound of Adarlan\u2019s most famous assassin, but no one even so much as gasped. Lord Eddard turned to discuss with the old man sitting next to him. She didn\u2019t know who he was, because no one had bothered to tell her (the nerve of them!), So she studied the auburn haired woman beside Lord Eddard. She must be the lord\u2019s wife, and the six children must be theirs. But she noticed another boy, who looked to be older than them all. He was handsome and blonde, but did not share the features of the Starks. He looked at her and gave her a charming smirk, which she did not return.<br><br>Meanwhile, Lord Eddard and the old man had finished their discussion. \u201cYou do not seem to come from here.\u201d The old man said from the high table. \u201cDo you know of this place, or who you are being presented to?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, maybe if someone had bothered to tell me I would have known.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou speak to Eddard of House Stark, lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North.\u201d Eddard Stark spoke for him. \u201cYou stand in the hall of Winterfell, the northernmost of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Here we are ruled by King Robert Baratheon, and his Queen Cersei Lannister. From whence do you hail?\u201d<br><br>\u201cMy name is Celaena.\u201d It was the only thing she felt they had the right to know.<br><br>\u201cAs you wish. You are aware of why you were imprisoned?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf that was hurting some man, I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d Celaena smirked. \u201cWhat are you going to do anyways? Throw me in a dungeon again?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf that is needed, it will be done. But at the moment, you do not seem too dangerous against the strength of twenty guards, and that will be considered.\u201d Lord Eddard\u2019s voice echoed in the cold, stone hall. \u201cIf freedom of the castle is what you wish, it will be given, but with strict restrictions. If you wish to listen to these terms then do so. But if not, your other option is the dungeons under the watch of guards whilst you await further sentencing.\u201d<br><br>Celaena shrugged prettily.<br><br>\u201cMaester Luwin?\u201d Lord Eddard turned to the old man.<br><br>\u201cThe terms you are offered are as follows.\u201d \u00a0The old man continued on, leaning forwards in his seat. \u201cThat you may go about the castle as you please, provided that you are under the watch of one of the castle guard at all times, and that you do not harm, assault or harass any of the occupants within WinterfellCastle. You may not depart unless by leave of Lord Eddard Stark himself, and if you are caught, you will be faced with harsh punishment. Do you consent to these terms?\u201d<br><br>Nothing was fair around here. Celaena wanted to say that she disagreed to all these terms and that she would rather leave back to her own, much better kingdom, thank you very much, but she knew enough that if she did not agree it would take her back to the dungeons again.<br><br>\u201cI agree.\u201d She flipped her hair over her shoulder.<br><br>And she was free. For then.<br><br>\u2026.<br><br>The blonde boy stood before the archery butts, loosing an arrow at one of the targets.<br><br>Celaena watched it fly from his fingers. With a solid thunk! The tip met the center of the target, embedding deep into the straw to join a cluster of arrows already clustered about the center. Theon Greyjoy, the blonde boy, grinned at the result of his shot.<br><br><br><br>\u201cYou could do better.\u201d Calaena said.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019ll address me as \u2018my lord\u2019.\u201d He reprimanded arrogantly. \u201cAnd besides, what makes you think you can do better?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve seen better.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve done better.\u201d<br><br>How self centered of him, when he obviously knew nothing about her own skill and that he was in danger just standing before her. She had to admit that he was handsome, but Maester Luwin had warned her against Theon and who he was, though she did not think him to be of any threat. \u00a0He glanced at her. \u201cI don\u2019t like the look of that smirk, by the way.\u201d He said. \u201cTake it off.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat else do you require, my lord?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYour clothes, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br><br>Before she could react, the little horse faced girl she had seen in court yesterday darted between them and took the bow from Theon. \u201cMy turn.\u201d She insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching long enough.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m busy, Arya, not now. Go and ask Jon or Robb if you really want to shoot. But I thought you ought to be with Sansa.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSansa\u2019s stupid. I want to shoot.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to be looking after you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWho cares about that?\u201d Arya asked, taking the bow from Theon. \u201cI\u2019m sick of being cooped up inside.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAlright, but don\u2019t tell me when Septa Mordane calls you back,\u201d Theon consented, but as if on cue a woman\u2019s voice shouted from across the grounds: \u201cArya!\u201d<br><br>That must be Septa Mordane, Celaena thought. The woman who came pointedly across the grounds was dressed in a caul and grey robes, and had wide hips that made her sway briskly as she bustled across the yard. \u201cYou are meant to be practising needlework, not playing at weapons.\u201d<br><br>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arya protested as Septa Mordane led her away. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be a little more like your sister?\u201d The Septa muttered. \u201cCome along, Arya. It\u2019s time you were downstairs.\u201d<br><br>\u201c\u2026But it\u2019s boring. And I don\u2019t care if Sansa wants to. It\u2019s stupid\u2026\u201d<br><br>Septa Mordane led her off. Theon raised an eyebrow as he watched them go. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky wench.\u201d He told Celaena. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to do needlework all day. I heard nothing that restricted you from the weapons around here.\u201d<br><br>Oh, how much she wanted to feel the grip of a sword again. \u201cGot anyone who\u2019ll try me?\u201d She asked daringly.<br><br>\u201cRobb\u2019s busy with Jon, and Bran and Rickon are too young,\u201d Theon said. \u201cIf you ask nicely though and don\u2019t kill him first, Ser Rodrik might spar with you. He\u2019s by the stables.\u201d<br><br>Celaena could hardly believe this arrogance towards her. She, the most notorious assassin in all of Adarlan! At least once she beat Ser Rodrik they might see she was to he feared after all. She bid good morrow to Theon and went to seek out the stout knight.<br><br>\u2026<br><br>The yard rang with the clash of steel.<br><br>Calaena raised her blade to block Ser Rodrik\u2019s blow. The old knight was less agile then she\u2013 that was to be expected\u2013 but he fought well for a man of his age and build. He was not Chaol Westfall: young, sturdily built and handsome, but this was fair competition besides. She had only been allowed a tourney blade though, which dented her pride. Wasn\u2019t she the best assassin in all of Adarlan?<br><br>\u201cMove your feet.\u201d Jory said from across the grounds. He had been watching intently since they had begun, and since then he had hardly moved from his position on the wooden bench. Calaena hefted her sword to aim for Ser Rodrik\u2019s belly, covered in a layer of wool and and quilted gambeson, and quite obvious. It was fair enough in size, she judged. The hit should come easy.<br><br>Then a raven took flight from the ground, and the sound of its wings flapping startled her. Ser Rodrikknocked her blade to the ground where it spun for a while and then skidded to a halt. \u201cYou were too emotional.\u201d He told her, picking up the sword and returning it. \u201cDon\u2019t let anger betray your skill.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd what would you know of fighting, if you\u2019re so old?\u201d Celaena snapped, picking her blade back up off the ground and polishing it with her modest tunic.<br><br>\u201cMore than you.\u201d Ser Rodrik looked to be suppressing a grin. \u201cOld knights live as long as they do for a reason, Celaena.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMight be their knees give way on the battlefield if they do.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMine own have not yet,\u201d Ser Rodrik said in a measured voice, \u201cbut you seem to want for younger competition, not the likes of men as old as I. Would you like that?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI do.\u201d She wanted to see the younger men, those who were a prettier sight to look at. Someone handsome would be more deserving for the likes of her. Here in Winterfell there were hardly any men half so good looking as those back at Adarlan, as much as she hated to admit it. Only Robb Stark and Jon Snow, the eldest of Lord Eddard\u2019s sons, could ever meet the dashing countenances of Adarlan men. She almost missed them.<br><br>\u201cShow me someone younger,\u201d she demanded.<br><br>\u201cWhy not my nephew, then?\u201d Ser Rodrik asked. \u201cI should like to test his skill against the\u2026 ah\u2026 best assassin in the Adarlan kingdom, as you claim yourself to be. At least, we shall see if that is true when compared to the warriors of the Westerosi North. I always wondered about my nephew\u2019s skill, though I don\u2019t doubt it. Would you like that?\u201d<br><br>\u201cOf course.\u201d Calaena said, but was surprised when Jory Cassel stood up from the bench with a small smile.<br><br>It was then that she realized that Ser Rodrik\u2019s surname was also Cassel.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d She whined, as Jory took Ser Rodrik\u2019s sword. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight him, \u00a0I wanted to fight with someone\u2013\u201d<br><br>\u201c\u2013Your age, as you said.\u201d Ser Rodrik finished for her. \u201cMy nephew is one of the men on hand closest to your age, and I doubt you\u2019re so many years younger than he is. Theon would be closer, though he is occupied at the moment. So, do you wish to spar with Jory or not? Or I could do it again if you like.\u201d<br><br>Whatever. Celaena knew she could best even the most skilled in Adarlan. If that was true, she could best anyone here in this Westeros. \u201cYou\u2019ll find yourself sprawling in the dust,\u201d she spat, as Jory bent into a stance. \u201cI bet I could win against the greatest fighter in this kingdom of I wanted to.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThe best fighter in the land is Ser Jaime Lannister, lass. Ten times better than me, and ten times as dishonourable.\u201d Jory\u2019s smile windened further. \u201cI wish you luck if you ever meet the Kingslayer on the field, but as of yet he is far away in King\u2019s Landing, and I should hope that he stays there. For now though, shall we begin?\u201d<br><br>Celaena growled in annoyance. Now she\u2019d let him see exactly how good she was, and she would not stop until he was grovelling on the ground and begging for quarter.<br><br>She lunged, and Jory swiped at her head, the suddenness of his movement making a breeze ruffle her hair. She ducked and lunged at his chest, but his blade met hers and her blow was batted away.<br><br>Calaena gritted her teeth. She would allow herself gritted her teeth. She would allow herself to toy with him for a bit longer, but now she would let him see her true strength. She met his next move with a swift block, and the swords made a cross as they came into the bind. He was faster in coming out of it though, and pushed her blade in a downward circle until it was forced out of her hands into the ground again, and the tip of his sword pointed straight at her stomach.<br><br>\u201cNever underestimate your enemy.\u201d Jory gave her back her sword, and she felt like snapping his spine over her knee. \u201cOverestimating yourself will not come to your advantage either.\u201d<br><br>If she had only been faster! Her reflexes had been as fast as a cat\u2019s when she had been in Adarlan, but the grimy Winterfell dungeons had slowed her down. Turning, she protested this to Jory and Ser Rodrik, but they paid her no attention. The idiots. She surveyed her surroundings instead, wondering again if there was any possible way of escaping.<br><br>A small figure scaling the stable walls caught her eye: Brandon Stark, Lord Eddard\u2019s six year old son. She had heard his name being called by the Maester only a few days ago as he was being led away to a lesson. Now the boy had reached the castle wall, and he was, of present, being reprimanded by a guard. She had never seen a boy climb so quickly.<br><br>\u201cAh, young Bran Stark,\u201d chuckled a man nearby. \u201cHe better be glad Lady Catelyn didn\u2019t catch him this time round.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAye,\u201d said another. \u201cThat boy\u2019s a squirrel.\u201d<br><br>A squirrel indeed. Yet it seemed the boy would not be able to leave the castle by climbing either. He was climbing down now, making annoyed exclamations as he went. Celaena supposed she would have to find some other way to get out. After all, she had hardly explored the entirety of Winterfell. It was just the guards who stopped her from doing so. And if she could survive the Endovier salt mines, she could survive this. She began to walk towards the stable wall to inspect the footholds Bran had used, but someone caught her by the arm.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d said Hallis Mollen\u2019s voice.<br><br>His eyes followed her as she wrenched her arm away. There was the slightest bit of intrigue in his eyes, but his sentinel-like face made her know he was watching her. Every corner she turned would have a guard in the shadows, and there was no chance she would be let out of their sight. She narrowed her own sapphire blue eyes at him and stalked away.</p>",

If you are a fan of Throne of Glass I\u2019m just going to say that I got a bad impression of Celaena from the first book, so it might be an inaccurate representation.

The stolid guard posted outside her cell had not taken the trouble to answer most of her questions either, and when she threatened him he did not even reply. The only answers he gave her made her want to scream. How dare he! If she could, she would have throttled something out of him by now.<br><br>It was just her usual rotten luck that she could not grab him through the bars with the fetters she wore around her wrists. She thought about striking them against the wall, but figured grudgingly that that would reap no benefit. Annoyed, she hugged her knees closer to her chest in the hopes that he would notice that she was freezing, but the guard paid her no mind.<br><br>\u201cBrrr,\u201d She trilled, still waiting, yet he pretended as if he hadn\u2019t heard.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d Celaena finally blurted.<br><br>\u201cBest get used to it, lass. Winter is coming, and with it the monsters from beyond The Wall.\u201d The guard did not even turn around. \u201cUntil then, may the gods save us all.\u201d<br><br>\u201cFetch me a cloak.\u201d She cared not for his pathetic fears.<br><br>\u201cLord Eddard Stark commanded me to watch you, not to do as you bid.\u201d<br><br>Ugh. How she hated this man. Ever since she had been thrown down here into this hovel of a cell, JoryCassel had given only his name, and then nothing but pointless matters. Early on, she had tried to coy him into freeing her by speaking to him seductively and leaning brazenly against the bars- which was as close as she could be to him- yet it somehow hadn\u2019t worked. How could it not, when she was so beautiful? It was simply that Jory Cassel could not be persuaded, she supposed.<br><br>\u201cSir,\u201d she announced, getting onto her hands and knees and trying a different track. \u201cHow good are you with a sword?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNot \u00a0'ser\u2019, I\u2019m not a knight. Besides, I should think myself to be capable.\u201d<br><br>\u201cCould you try me?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI am not commanded to do your bidding.\u201d<br><br>That again. She sighed audibly. Going back to staring at the grimy walls, she wondered how she would break out of here. If they allowed her a tool of some sort, Celaena thought, she could overpower Jory and get past him easily. He had been standing here like a statue all day after all, but during the night shifts, he would swap places with Hallis Mollen to get some rest, so neither of them ever fell asleep at their post. They didn\u2019t dare open her door to give her food either: the gritty bowls of gruel were served to her between the bars of her cell. Even if she did somehow escape, there was the matter of guards outside, for there were bound to be plenty to man the gates and walls of this place.<br><br>At least this Lord Eddard Stark had thought to charge only his best guards to keep watch over her. It seemed someone knew her prowess after all, and did not want to underestimate her. She\u2019d nearly slain one of the men in the black cloaks she had come across when she first came here, trudging through heavy snow, and it had taken a host of five men to knock her silent. After that incident, she\u2019d woken up here with no idea of where she was. Jory told her only that she was in a dungeon (\u201cwhat did you expect for assaulting a man of the Night\u2019s Watch?\u201d).<br><br>The sound of descending footsteps echoed on the stairwell. Celaena looked up, expecting to see the rough face of Hallis Mollen come around the corner, but was surprised to see a stout keg of a knight with magnificent white whiskers approach instead.<br><br>\u201cLord Eddard has commanded the girl to be brought before him.\u201d Said the knight to Jory. \u201cSee that she\u2019s properly chained before you take her to his lordship\u2019s court, and tell her nothing even if she asks.\u201d<br><br>Jory nodded. \u201cGet up.\u201d He told Celaena as the other man left, and she did so sulkily. He unlocked the door and tugged on her chains to make sure they held, then made her march up the stairs ahead of him so that her fetters rattled noisily. She saw the tip of his spear hovering a little behind her back, and she turned her body a little to the side so she could choke Jory'swindpipe with her chains.<br><br>\u201cBest not do that,\u201d he warned, poking the spear into her back.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I could snap that puny spear in one move,\u201d Celaena shot back, and Jory raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019d have to snap quite a bit,\u201d he said in a surprised voice, \u201cAnd get round the spear itself if I don\u2019t impale you first, but no matter. I will not stand here idly while Lord Eddard awaits us. Either you move, or I\u2019ll push you.\u201d<br><br>Adarlan guards always used swords to escort her, Calaena thought, so she couldn\u2019t see why she should not grab the spear away. She tried to twist and grab it, but the metal point grazed her side as she did so. \u201cOw!\u201d She squeaked.<br><br>\u201cHandy things, eh, spears?\u201d Jory asked her, grinning. \u201cBest move now then.\u201d<br><br>She was led down a series of corridors made of stone walls, heated from the inside by an unknown source. Oaken doors could be seen across the passages, and the occasional window let in a cold, winter light. Sometimes Celaena could see a tapestry or two: each white in colour, depicting a loping grey wolf embroidered in fine silk. WINTER IS COMING, read the words on the end of each one. Calaena wondered how terrible the winters here might really be.<br><br>Then Jory\u2019s spear turned her left, and she entered a corridor that ended in a small archway. Passing under the archway she entered a crowded hall, filled withpeople dressed in furs of grey, brown or white. The room itself was lit only by a wooden chandelier hanging from the ceiling, and a few lancet windows let in tall slits of light. Guards, some servants and a few other men stood by the door at the end of the hall, whilst six children whispered amongst each other beside the high table. An old man dressed in grey robes and a pretty, middle aged woman with auburn hair and blue eyes sat on either side of a high backed chair, but it was vacant. How dingy this is. Celaena thought. She expected this building to be the grand castle she guessed it was, but this dim hall failed to reach her expectations. The only thing she knew about it was that it was called Winterfell, though Jory had not disclosed any more than that.<br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s the person who tried to kill a man from the Night\u2019s Watch, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She heard one of the children whisper as she entered. It was a little horse faced girl who looked to be about ten years old, and was hardly much to look at. \u201cFat Tom told me the other day that she appeared out of nowhere.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNowhere,\u201d echoed her toddler brother.<br><br>\u201cWill you shut up?\u201d Asked their older sister. She was a pretty looking girl with the auburn hair and blue eyes of the woman at the high table. The younger girl looked as if she would hit her sister, but a nudge from her brother, who was perhaps fifteen, made her shut up and look sour instead.<br><br>Then with the sound of rumbling doors, a middle aged man with cold grey eyes entered the hall. \u201cAll kneel for Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North,\u201d called the herald, and the hall knelt.<br><br>The Lord of Winterfell cleared his throat. Celaenastudied his brown hair and cold grey eyes as he regarded her sharply, wondering if this man was any good. She knew she ought to kneel, but decided not to out of defiance.<br><br>\u201cMy lord\u2026?\u201d Jory looked up.<br><br>\u201cNo need.\u201d Lord Eddard looked down upon Celaena. \u201cWhence did you come from, girl?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYour name, then.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s Celaena Sardothien.\u201d She smirked, waiting for a shocked reaction at the sound of Adarlan\u2019s most famous assassin, but no one even so much as gasped. Lord Eddard turned to discuss with the old man sitting next to him. She didn\u2019t know who he was, because no one had bothered to tell her (the nerve of them!), So she studied the auburn haired woman beside Lord Eddard. She must be the lord\u2019s wife, and the six children must be theirs. But she noticed another boy, who looked to be older than them all. He was handsome and blonde, but did not share the features of the Starks. He looked at her and gave her a charming smirk, which she did not return.<br><br>Meanwhile, Lord Eddard and the old man had finished their discussion. \u201cYou do not seem to come from here.\u201d The old man said from the high table. \u201cDo you know of this place, or who you are being presented to?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, maybe if someone had bothered to tell me I would have known.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou speak to Eddard of House Stark, lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North.\u201d Eddard Stark spoke for him. \u201cYou stand in the hall of Winterfell, the northernmost of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Here we are ruled by King Robert Baratheon, and his Queen Cersei Lannister. From whence do you hail?\u201d<br><br>\u201cMy name is Celaena.\u201d It was the only thing she felt they had the right to know.<br><br>\u201cAs you wish. You are aware of why you were imprisoned?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf that was hurting some man, I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d Celaena smirked. \u201cWhat are you going to do anyways? Throw me in a dungeon again?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf that is needed, it will be done. But at the moment, you do not seem too dangerous against the strength of twenty guards, and that will be considered.\u201d Lord Eddard\u2019s voice echoed in the cold, stone hall. \u201cIf freedom of the castle is what you wish, it will be given, but with strict restrictions. If you wish to listen to these terms then do so. But if not, your other option is the dungeons under the watch of guards whilst you await further sentencing.\u201d<br><br>Celaena shrugged prettily.<br><br>\u201cMaester Luwin?\u201d Lord Eddard turned to the old man.<br><br>\u201cThe terms you are offered are as follows.\u201d \u00a0The old man continued on, leaning forwards in his seat. \u201cThat you may go about the castle as you please, provided that you are under the watch of one of the castle guard at all times, and that you do not harm, assault or harass any of the occupants within WinterfellCastle. You may not depart unless by leave of Lord Eddard Stark himself, and if you are caught, you will be faced with harsh punishment. Do you consent to these terms?\u201d<br><br>Nothing was fair around here. Celaena wanted to say that she disagreed to all these terms and that she would rather leave back to her own, much better kingdom, thank you very much, but she knew enough that if she did not agree it would take her back to the dungeons again.<br><br>\u201cI agree.\u201d She flipped her hair over her shoulder.<br><br>And she was free. For then.<br><br>\u2026.<br><br>The blonde boy stood before the archery butts, loosing an arrow at one of the targets.<br><br>Celaena watched it fly from his fingers. With a solid thunk! The tip met the center of the target, embedding deep into the straw to join a cluster of arrows already clustered about the center. Theon Greyjoy, the blonde boy, grinned at the result of his shot.<br><br><br><br>\u201cYou could do better.\u201d Calaena said.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019ll address me as \u2018my lord\u2019.\u201d He reprimanded arrogantly. \u201cAnd besides, what makes you think you can do better?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve seen better.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve done better.\u201d<br><br>How self centered of him, when he obviously knew nothing about her own skill and that he was in danger just standing before her. She had to admit that he was handsome, but Maester Luwin had warned her against Theon and who he was, though she did not think him to be of any threat. \u00a0He glanced at her. \u201cI don\u2019t like the look of that smirk, by the way.\u201d He said. \u201cTake it off.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat else do you require, my lord?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYour clothes, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br><br>Before she could react, the little horse faced girl she had seen in court yesterday darted between them and took the bow from Theon. \u201cMy turn.\u201d She insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching long enough.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m busy, Arya, not now. Go and ask Jon or Robb if you really want to shoot. But I thought you ought to be with Sansa.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSansa\u2019s stupid. I want to shoot.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to be looking after you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWho cares about that?\u201d Arya asked, taking the bow from Theon. \u201cI\u2019m sick of being cooped up inside.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAlright, but don\u2019t tell me when Septa Mordane calls you back,\u201d Theon consented, but as if on cue a woman\u2019s voice shouted from across the grounds: \u201cArya!\u201d<br><br>That must be Septa Mordane, Celaena thought. The woman who came pointedly across the grounds was dressed in a caul and grey robes, and had wide hips that made her sway briskly as she bustled across the yard. \u201cYou are meant to be practising needlework, not playing at weapons.\u201d<br><br>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arya protested as Septa Mordane led her away. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be a little more like your sister?\u201d The Septa muttered. \u201cCome along, Arya. It\u2019s time you were downstairs.\u201d<br><br>\u201c\u2026But it\u2019s boring. And I don\u2019t care if Sansa wants to. It\u2019s stupid\u2026\u201d<br><br>Septa Mordane led her off. Theon raised an eyebrow as he watched them go. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky wench.\u201d He told Celaena. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to do needlework all day. I heard nothing that restricted you from the weapons around here.\u201d<br><br>Oh, how much she wanted to feel the grip of a sword again. \u201cGot anyone who\u2019ll try me?\u201d She asked daringly.<br><br>\u201cRobb\u2019s busy with Jon, and Bran and Rickon are too young,\u201d Theon said. \u201cIf you ask nicely though and don\u2019t kill him first, Ser Rodrik might spar with you. He\u2019s by the stables.\u201d<br><br>Celaena could hardly believe this arrogance towards her. She, the most notorious assassin in all of Adarlan! At least once she beat Ser Rodrik they might see she was to he feared after all. She bid good morrow to Theon and went to seek out the stout knight.<br><br>\u2026<br><br>The yard rang with the clash of steel.<br><br>Calaena raised her blade to block Ser Rodrik\u2019s blow. The old knight was less agile then she\u2013 that was to be expected\u2013 but he fought well for a man of his age and build. He was not Chaol Westfall: young, sturdily built and handsome, but this was fair competition besides. She had only been allowed a tourney blade though, which dented her pride. Wasn\u2019t she the best assassin in all of Adarlan?<br><br>\u201cMove your feet.\u201d Jory said from across the grounds. He had been watching intently since they had begun, and since then he had hardly moved from his position on the wooden bench. Calaena hefted her sword to aim for Ser Rodrik\u2019s belly, covered in a layer of wool and and quilted gambeson, and quite obvious. It was fair enough in size, she judged. The hit should come easy.<br><br>Then a raven took flight from the ground, and the sound of its wings flapping startled her. Ser Rodrikknocked her blade to the ground where it spun for a while and then skidded to a halt. \u201cYou were too emotional.\u201d He told her, picking up the sword and returning it. \u201cDon\u2019t let anger betray your skill.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd what would you know of fighting, if you\u2019re so old?\u201d Celaena snapped, picking her blade back up off the ground and polishing it with her modest tunic.<br><br>\u201cMore than you.\u201d Ser Rodrik looked to be suppressing a grin. \u201cOld knights live as long as they do for a reason, Celaena.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMight be their knees give way on the battlefield if they do.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMine own have not yet,\u201d Ser Rodrik said in a measured voice, \u201cbut you seem to want for younger competition, not the likes of men as old as I. Would you like that?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI do.\u201d She wanted to see the younger men, those who were a prettier sight to look at. Someone handsome would be more deserving for the likes of her. Here in Winterfell there were hardly any men half so good looking as those back at Adarlan, as much as she hated to admit it. Only Robb Stark and Jon Snow, the eldest of Lord Eddard\u2019s sons, could ever meet the dashing countenances of Adarlan men. She almost missed them.<br><br>\u201cShow me someone younger,\u201d she demanded.<br><br>\u201cWhy not my nephew, then?\u201d Ser Rodrik asked. \u201cI should like to test his skill against the\u2026 ah\u2026 best assassin in the Adarlan kingdom, as you claim yourself to be. At least, we shall see if that is true when compared to the warriors of the Westerosi North. I always wondered about my nephew\u2019s skill, though I don\u2019t doubt it. Would you like that?\u201d<br><br>\u201cOf course.\u201d Calaena said, but was surprised when Jory Cassel stood up from the bench with a small smile.<br><br>It was then that she realized that Ser Rodrik\u2019s surname was also Cassel.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d She whined, as Jory took Ser Rodrik\u2019s sword. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight him, \u00a0I wanted to fight with someone\u2013\u201d<br><br>\u201c\u2013Your age, as you said.\u201d Ser Rodrik finished for her. \u201cMy nephew is one of the men on hand closest to your age, and I doubt you\u2019re so many years younger than he is. Theon would be closer, though he is occupied at the moment. So, do you wish to spar with Jory or not? Or I could do it again if you like.\u201d<br><br>Whatever. Celaena knew she could best even the most skilled in Adarlan. If that was true, she could best anyone here in this Westeros. \u201cYou\u2019ll find yourself sprawling in the dust,\u201d she spat, as Jory bent into a stance. \u201cI bet I could win against the greatest fighter in this kingdom of I wanted to.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThe best fighter in the land is Ser Jaime Lannister, lass. Ten times better than me, and ten times as dishonourable.\u201d Jory\u2019s smile windened further. \u201cI wish you luck if you ever meet the Kingslayer on the field, but as of yet he is far away in King\u2019s Landing, and I should hope that he stays there. For now though, shall we begin?\u201d<br><br>Celaena growled in annoyance. Now she\u2019d let him see exactly how good she was, and she would not stop until he was grovelling on the ground and begging for quarter.<br><br>She lunged, and Jory swiped at her head, the suddenness of his movement making a breeze ruffle her hair. She ducked and lunged at his chest, but his blade met hers and her blow was batted away.<br><br>Calaena gritted her teeth. She would allow herself gritted her teeth. She would allow herself to toy with him for a bit longer, but now she would let him see her true strength. She met his next move with a swift block, and the swords made a cross as they came into the bind. He was faster in coming out of it though, and pushed her blade in a downward circle until it was forced out of her hands into the ground again, and the tip of his sword pointed straight at her stomach.<br><br>\u201cNever underestimate your enemy.\u201d Jory gave her back her sword, and she felt like snapping his spine over her knee. \u201cOverestimating yourself will not come to your advantage either.\u201d<br><br>If she had only been faster! Her reflexes had been as fast as a cat\u2019s when she had been in Adarlan, but the grimy Winterfell dungeons had slowed her down. Turning, she protested this to Jory and Ser Rodrik, but they paid her no attention. The idiots. She surveyed her surroundings instead, wondering again if there was any possible way of escaping.<br><br>A small figure scaling the stable walls caught her eye: Brandon Stark, Lord Eddard\u2019s six year old son. She had heard his name being called by the Maester only a few days ago as he was being led away to a lesson. Now the boy had reached the castle wall, and he was, of present, being reprimanded by a guard. She had never seen a boy climb so quickly.<br><br>\u201cAh, young Bran Stark,\u201d chuckled a man nearby. \u201cHe better be glad Lady Catelyn didn\u2019t catch him this time round.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAye,\u201d said another. \u201cThat boy\u2019s a squirrel.\u201d<br><br>A squirrel indeed. Yet it seemed the boy would not be able to leave the castle by climbing either. He was climbing down now, making annoyed exclamations as he went. Celaena supposed she would have to find some other way to get out. After all, she had hardly explored the entirety of Winterfell. It was just the guards who stopped her from doing so. And if she could survive the Endovier salt mines, she could survive this. She began to walk towards the stable wall to inspect the footholds Bran had used, but someone caught her by the arm.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d said Hallis Mollen\u2019s voice.<br><br>His eyes followed her as she wrenched her arm away. There was the slightest bit of intrigue in his eyes, but his sentinel-like face made her know he was watching her. Every corner she turned would have a guard in the shadows, and there was no chance she would be let out of their sight. She narrowed her own sapphire blue eyes at him and stalked away.</p>",
                "content": "<p>So this is a short piece I wrote about two years ago. If you are a fan of Throne of Glass I&rsquo;m just going to say that I got a bad impression of Celaena from the first book, so it might be an inaccurate representation. Just a warning.</p><p>PLOT SUMMARY: Celaena arrives in Winterfell due to an unknown twist of events.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Celaena sat shivering in the damp corner of her cell.<br /></p><p><br />She hadn&rsquo;t seen the sun in days beyond count. The stolid guard posted outside her cell had not taken the trouble to answer most of her questions either, and when she threatened him he did not even reply. The only answers he gave her made her want to scream. How dare he! If she could, she would have throttled something out of him by now.<br /><br />It was just her usual rotten luck that she could not grab him through the bars with the fetters she wore around her wrists. She thought about striking them against the wall, but figured grudgingly that that would reap no benefit. Annoyed, she hugged her knees closer to her chest in the hopes that he would notice that she was freezing, but the guard paid her no mind.<br /><br />&ldquo;Brrr,&rdquo; She trilled, still waiting, yet he pretended as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; Celaena finally blurted.<br /><br />&ldquo;Best get used to it, lass. Winter is coming, and with it the monsters from beyond The Wall.&rdquo; The guard did not even turn around. &ldquo;Until then, may the gods save us all.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Fetch me a cloak.&rdquo; She cared not for his pathetic fears.<br /><br />&ldquo;Lord Eddard Stark commanded me to watch you, not to do as you bid.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ugh. How she hated this man. Ever since she had been thrown down here into this hovel of a cell, JoryCassel had given only his name, and then nothing but pointless matters. Early on, she had tried to coy him into freeing her by speaking to him seductively and leaning brazenly against the bars- which was as close as she could be to him- yet it somehow hadn&rsquo;t worked. How could it not, when she was so beautiful? It was simply that Jory Cassel could not be persuaded, she supposed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she announced, getting onto her hands and knees and trying a different track. &ldquo;How good are you with a sword?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Not &nbsp;'ser&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m not a knight. Besides, I should think myself to be capable.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Could you try me?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I am not commanded to do your bidding.&rdquo;<br /><br />That again. She sighed audibly. Going back to staring at the grimy walls, she wondered how she would break out of here. If they allowed her a tool of some sort, Celaena thought, she could overpower Jory and get past him easily. He had been standing here like a statue all day after all, but during the night shifts, he would swap places with Hallis Mollen to get some rest, so neither of them ever fell asleep at their post. They didn&rsquo;t dare open her door to give her food either: the gritty bowls of gruel were served to her between the bars of her cell. Even if she did somehow escape, there was the matter of guards outside, for there were bound to be plenty to man the gates and walls of this place.<br /><br />At least this Lord Eddard Stark had thought to charge only his best guards to keep watch over her. It seemed someone knew her prowess after all, and did not want to underestimate her. She&rsquo;d nearly slain one of the men in the black cloaks she had come across when she first came here, trudging through heavy snow, and it had taken a host of five men to knock her silent. After that incident, she&rsquo;d woken up here with no idea of where she was. Jory told her only that she was in a dungeon (&ldquo;what did you expect for assaulting a man of the Night&rsquo;s Watch?&rdquo;).<br /><br />The sound of descending footsteps echoed on the stairwell. Celaena looked up, expecting to see the rough face of Hallis Mollen come around the corner, but was surprised to see a stout keg of a knight with magnificent white whiskers approach instead.<br /><br />&ldquo;Lord Eddard has commanded the girl to be brought before him.&rdquo; Said the knight to Jory. &ldquo;See that she&rsquo;s properly chained before you take her to his lordship&rsquo;s court, and tell her nothing even if she asks.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jory nodded. &ldquo;Get up.&rdquo; He told Celaena as the other man left, and she did so sulkily. He unlocked the door and tugged on her chains to make sure they held, then made her march up the stairs ahead of him so that her fetters rattled noisily. She saw the tip of his spear hovering a little behind her back, and she turned her body a little to the side so she could choke Jory'swindpipe with her chains.<br /><br />&ldquo;Best not do that,&rdquo; he warned, poking the spear into her back.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know I could snap that puny spear in one move,&rdquo; Celaena shot back, and Jory raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to snap quite a bit,&rdquo; he said in a surprised voice, &ldquo;And get round the spear itself if I don&rsquo;t impale you first, but no matter. I will not stand here idly while Lord Eddard awaits us. Either you move, or I&rsquo;ll push you.&rdquo;<br /><br />Adarlan guards always used swords to escort her, Calaena thought, so she couldn&rsquo;t see why she should not grab the spear away. She tried to twist and grab it, but the metal point grazed her side as she did so. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; She squeaked.<br /><br />&ldquo;Handy things, eh, spears?&rdquo; Jory asked her, grinning. &ldquo;Best move now then.&rdquo;<br /><br />She was led down a series of corridors made of stone walls, heated from the inside by an unknown source. Oaken doors could be seen across the passages, and the occasional window let in a cold, winter light. Sometimes Celaena could see a tapestry or two: each white in colour, depicting a loping grey wolf embroidered in fine silk. WINTER IS COMING, read the words on the end of each one. Calaena wondered how terrible the winters here might really be.<br /><br />Then Jory&rsquo;s spear turned her left, and she entered a corridor that ended in a small archway. Passing under the archway she entered a crowded hall, filled withpeople dressed in furs of grey, brown or white. The room itself was lit only by a wooden chandelier hanging from the ceiling, and a few lancet windows let in tall slits of light. Guards, some servants and a few other men stood by the door at the end of the hall, whilst six children whispered amongst each other beside the high table. An old man dressed in grey robes and a pretty, middle aged woman with auburn hair and blue eyes sat on either side of a high backed chair, but it was vacant. How dingy this is. Celaena thought. She expected this building to be the grand castle she guessed it was, but this dim hall failed to reach her expectations. The only thing she knew about it was that it was called Winterfell, though Jory had not disclosed any more than that.<br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the person who tried to kill a man from the Night&rsquo;s Watch, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She heard one of the children whisper as she entered. It was a little horse faced girl who looked to be about ten years old, and was hardly much to look at. &ldquo;Fat Tom told me the other day that she appeared out of nowhere.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Nowhere,&rdquo; echoed her toddler brother.<br /><br />&ldquo;Will you shut up?&rdquo; Asked their older sister. She was a pretty looking girl with the auburn hair and blue eyes of the woman at the high table. The younger girl looked as if she would hit her sister, but a nudge from her brother, who was perhaps fifteen, made her shut up and look sour instead.<br /><br />Then with the sound of rumbling doors, a middle aged man with cold grey eyes entered the hall. &ldquo;All kneel for Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North,&rdquo; called the herald, and the hall knelt.<br /><br />The Lord of Winterfell cleared his throat. Celaenastudied his brown hair and cold grey eyes as he regarded her sharply, wondering if this man was any good. She knew she ought to kneel, but decided not to out of defiance.<br /><br />&ldquo;My lord&hellip;?&rdquo; Jory looked up.<br /><br />&ldquo;No need.&rdquo; Lord Eddard looked down upon Celaena. &ldquo;Whence did you come from, girl?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell you that.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Your name, then.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Celaena Sardothien.&rdquo; She smirked, waiting for a shocked reaction at the sound of Adarlan&rsquo;s most famous assassin, but no one even so much as gasped. Lord Eddard turned to discuss with the old man sitting next to him. She didn&rsquo;t know who he was, because no one had bothered to tell her (the nerve of them!), So she studied the auburn haired woman beside Lord Eddard. She must be the lord&rsquo;s wife, and the six children must be theirs. But she noticed another boy, who looked to be older than them all. He was handsome and blonde, but did not share the features of the Starks. He looked at her and gave her a charming smirk, which she did not return.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lord Eddard and the old man had finished their discussion. &ldquo;You do not seem to come from here.&rdquo; The old man said from the high table. &ldquo;Do you know of this place, or who you are being presented to?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, maybe if someone had bothered to tell me I would have known.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You speak to Eddard of House Stark, lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North.&rdquo; Eddard Stark spoke for him. &ldquo;You stand in the hall of Winterfell, the northernmost of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Here we are ruled by King Robert Baratheon, and his Queen Cersei Lannister. From whence do you hail?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;My name is Celaena.&rdquo; It was the only thing she felt they had the right to know.<br /><br />&ldquo;As you wish. You are aware of why you were imprisoned?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;If that was hurting some man, I don&rsquo;t regret it at all.&rdquo; Celaena smirked. &ldquo;What are you going to do anyways? Throw me in a dungeon again?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;If that is needed, it will be done. But at the moment, you do not seem too dangerous against the strength of twenty guards, and that will be considered.&rdquo; Lord Eddard&rsquo;s voice echoed in the cold, stone hall. &ldquo;If freedom of the castle is what you wish, it will be given, but with strict restrictions. If you wish to listen to these terms then do so. But if not, your other option is the dungeons under the watch of guards whilst you await further sentencing.&rdquo;<br /><br />Celaena shrugged prettily.<br /><br />&ldquo;Maester Luwin?&rdquo; Lord Eddard turned to the old man.<br /><br />&ldquo;The terms you are offered are as follows.&rdquo; &nbsp;The old man continued on, leaning forwards in his seat. &ldquo;That you may go about the castle as you please, provided that you are under the watch of one of the castle guard at all times, and that you do not harm, assault or harass any of the occupants within WinterfellCastle. You may not depart unless by leave of Lord Eddard Stark himself, and if you are caught, you will be faced with harsh punishment. Do you consent to these terms?&rdquo;<br /><br />Nothing was fair around here. Celaena wanted to say that she disagreed to all these terms and that she would rather leave back to her own, much better kingdom, thank you very much, but she knew enough that if she did not agree it would take her back to the dungeons again.<br /><br />&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo; She flipped her hair over her shoulder.<br /><br />And she was free. For then.<br /><br />&hellip;.<br /><br />The blonde boy stood before the archery butts, loosing an arrow at one of the targets.<br /><br />Celaena watched it fly from his fingers. With a solid thunk! The tip met the center of the target, embedding deep into the straw to join a cluster of arrows already clustered about the center. Theon Greyjoy, the blonde boy, grinned at the result of his shot.<br /><br /><br /><br />&ldquo;You could do better.&rdquo; Calaena said.<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll address me as &lsquo;my lord&rsquo;.&rdquo; He reprimanded arrogantly. &ldquo;And besides, what makes you think you can do better?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen better.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done better.&rdquo;<br /><br />How self centered of him, when he obviously knew nothing about her own skill and that he was in danger just standing before her. She had to admit that he was handsome, but Maester Luwin had warned her against Theon and who he was, though she did not think him to be of any threat. &nbsp;He glanced at her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the look of that smirk, by the way.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;Take it off.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What else do you require, my lord?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Your clothes, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;<br /><br />Before she could react, the little horse faced girl she had seen in court yesterday darted between them and took the bow from Theon. &ldquo;My turn.&rdquo; She insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching long enough.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy, Arya, not now. Go and ask Jon or Robb if you really want to shoot. But I thought you ought to be with Sansa.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Sansa&rsquo;s stupid. I want to shoot.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s going to be looking after you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Who cares about that?&rdquo; Arya asked, taking the bow from Theon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of being cooped up inside.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Alright, but don&rsquo;t tell me when Septa Mordane calls you back,&rdquo; Theon consented, but as if on cue a woman&rsquo;s voice shouted from across the grounds: &ldquo;Arya!&rdquo;<br /><br />That must be Septa Mordane, Celaena thought. The woman who came pointedly across the grounds was dressed in a caul and grey robes, and had wide hips that made her sway briskly as she bustled across the yard. &ldquo;You are meant to be practising needlework, not playing at weapons.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; Arya protested as Septa Mordane led her away. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you be a little more like your sister?&rdquo; The Septa muttered. &ldquo;Come along, Arya. It&rsquo;s time you were downstairs.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;&hellip;But it&rsquo;s boring. And I don&rsquo;t care if Sansa wants to. It&rsquo;s stupid&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />Septa Mordane led her off. Theon raised an eyebrow as he watched them go. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lucky wench.&rdquo; He told Celaena. &ldquo;At least you don&rsquo;t have to do needlework all day. I heard nothing that restricted you from the weapons around here.&rdquo;<br /><br />Oh, how much she wanted to feel the grip of a sword again. &ldquo;Got anyone who&rsquo;ll try me?&rdquo; She asked daringly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Robb&rsquo;s busy with Jon, and Bran and Rickon are too young,&rdquo; Theon said. &ldquo;If you ask nicely though and don&rsquo;t kill him first, Ser Rodrik might spar with you. He&rsquo;s by the stables.&rdquo;<br /><br />Celaena could hardly believe this arrogance towards her. She, the most notorious assassin in all of Adarlan! At least once she beat Ser Rodrik they might see she was to he feared after all. She bid good morrow to Theon and went to seek out the stout knight.<br /><br />&hellip;<br /><br />The yard rang with the clash of steel.<br /><br />Calaena raised her blade to block Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s blow. The old knight was less agile then she&ndash; that was to be expected&ndash; but he fought well for a man of his age and build. He was not Chaol Westfall: young, sturdily built and handsome, but this was fair competition besides. She had only been allowed a tourney blade though, which dented her pride. Wasn&rsquo;t she the best assassin in all of Adarlan?<br /><br />&ldquo;Move your feet.&rdquo; Jory said from across the grounds. He had been watching intently since they had begun, and since then he had hardly moved from his position on the wooden bench. Calaena hefted her sword to aim for Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s belly, covered in a layer of wool and and quilted gambeson, and quite obvious. It was fair enough in size, she judged. The hit should come easy.<br /><br />Then a raven took flight from the ground, and the sound of its wings flapping startled her. Ser Rodrikknocked her blade to the ground where it spun for a while and then skidded to a halt. &ldquo;You were too emotional.&rdquo; He told her, picking up the sword and returning it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anger betray your skill.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And what would you know of fighting, if you&rsquo;re so old?&rdquo; Celaena snapped, picking her blade back up off the ground and polishing it with her modest tunic.<br /><br />&ldquo;More than you.&rdquo; Ser Rodrik looked to be suppressing a grin. &ldquo;Old knights live as long as they do for a reason, Celaena.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Might be their knees give way on the battlefield if they do.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Mine own have not yet,&rdquo; Ser Rodrik said in a measured voice, &ldquo;but you seem to want for younger competition, not the likes of men as old as I. Would you like that?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; She wanted to see the younger men, those who were a prettier sight to look at. Someone handsome would be more deserving for the likes of her. Here in Winterfell there were hardly any men half so good looking as those back at Adarlan, as much as she hated to admit it. Only Robb Stark and Jon Snow, the eldest of Lord Eddard&rsquo;s sons, could ever meet the dashing countenances of Adarlan men. She almost missed them.<br /><br />&ldquo;Show me someone younger,&rdquo; she demanded.<br /><br />&ldquo;Why not my nephew, then?&rdquo; Ser Rodrik asked. &ldquo;I should like to test his skill against the&hellip; ah&hellip; best assassin in the Adarlan kingdom, as you claim yourself to be. At least, we shall see if that is true when compared to the warriors of the Westerosi North. I always wondered about my nephew&rsquo;s skill, though I don&rsquo;t doubt it. Would you like that?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Calaena said, but was surprised when Jory Cassel stood up from the bench with a small smile.<br /><br />It was then that she realized that Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s surname was also Cassel.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; She whined, as Jory took Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s sword. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to fight him, &nbsp;I wanted to fight with someone&ndash;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;&ndash;Your age, as you said.&rdquo; Ser Rodrik finished for her. &ldquo;My nephew is one of the men on hand closest to your age, and I doubt you&rsquo;re so many years younger than he is. Theon would be closer, though he is occupied at the moment. So, do you wish to spar with Jory or not? Or I could do it again if you like.&rdquo;<br /><br />Whatever. Celaena knew she could best even the most skilled in Adarlan. If that was true, she could best anyone here in this Westeros. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find yourself sprawling in the dust,&rdquo; she spat, as Jory bent into a stance. &ldquo;I bet I could win against the greatest fighter in this kingdom of I wanted to.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The best fighter in the land is Ser Jaime Lannister, lass. Ten times better than me, and ten times as dishonourable.&rdquo; Jory&rsquo;s smile windened further. &ldquo;I wish you luck if you ever meet the Kingslayer on the field, but as of yet he is far away in King&rsquo;s Landing, and I should hope that he stays there. For now though, shall we begin?&rdquo;<br /><br />Celaena growled in annoyance. Now she&rsquo;d let him see exactly how good she was, and she would not stop until he was grovelling on the ground and begging for quarter.<br /><br />She lunged, and Jory swiped at her head, the suddenness of his movement making a breeze ruffle her hair. She ducked and lunged at his chest, but his blade met hers and her blow was batted away.<br /><br />Calaena gritted her teeth. She would allow herself gritted her teeth. She would allow herself to toy with him for a bit longer, but now she would let him see her true strength. She met his next move with a swift block, and the swords made a cross as they came into the bind. He was faster in coming out of it though, and pushed her blade in a downward circle until it was forced out of her hands into the ground again, and the tip of his sword pointed straight at her stomach.<br /><br />&ldquo;Never underestimate your enemy.&rdquo; Jory gave her back her sword, and she felt like snapping his spine over her knee. &ldquo;Overestimating yourself will not come to your advantage either.&rdquo;<br /><br />If she had only been faster! Her reflexes had been as fast as a cat&rsquo;s when she had been in Adarlan, but the grimy Winterfell dungeons had slowed her down. Turning, she protested this to Jory and Ser Rodrik, but they paid her no attention. The idiots. She surveyed her surroundings instead, wondering again if there was any possible way of escaping.<br /><br />A small figure scaling the stable walls caught her eye: Brandon Stark, Lord Eddard&rsquo;s six year old son. She had heard his name being called by the Maester only a few days ago as he was being led away to a lesson. Now the boy had reached the castle wall, and he was, of present, being reprimanded by a guard. She had never seen a boy climb so quickly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ah, young Bran Stark,&rdquo; chuckled a man nearby. &ldquo;He better be glad Lady Catelyn didn&rsquo;t catch him this time round.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s a squirrel.&rdquo;<br /><br />A squirrel indeed. Yet it seemed the boy would not be able to leave the castle by climbing either. He was climbing down now, making annoyed exclamations as he went. Celaena supposed she would have to find some other way to get out. After all, she had hardly explored the entirety of Winterfell. It was just the guards who stopped her from doing so. And if she could survive the Endovier salt mines, she could survive this. She began to walk towards the stable wall to inspect the footholds Bran had used, but someone caught her by the arm.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it,&rdquo; said Hallis Mollen&rsquo;s voice.<br /><br />His eyes followed her as she wrenched her arm away. There was the slightest bit of intrigue in his eyes, but his sentinel-like face made her know he was watching her. Every corner she turned would have a guard in the shadows, and there was no chance she would be let out of their sight. She narrowed her own sapphire blue eyes at him and stalked away.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Hello anon. I don&rsquo;t think that in the books, Arya has ever said that she wants to leave Winterfell and travel.

Steal some food from the kitchens, take Needle and her good boots and a warm cloak. She could find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, and together they&rsquo;d return to Winterfell, or run to Jon on the Wall.</p><p>We can see that even before everything goes wrong, Arya fantasises about returning to Winterfell or about going to the Wall.
