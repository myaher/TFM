Fandoms include Critical Role, Hamilton, MCU, Pacific Rim, Elementary, Brooklyn Nine Nine, LotR, Firefly, Harry Potter, Sailor Moon, K-Pop, and many others. \u00a0I post A LOT of cute animals and babies, pictures of unfairly attractive celebrities, social justice posts, and pretty things that catch my eye. I REALLY like puns.\u00a0On Wednesdays, I do No White Dude Wednesdays (NWDW) where I spam my dash with pictures and historical posts of POCs and transgender people.\u00a0Occasionally, I commit podfic.\nAlso, I apparently do fanfiction now.\nI am also on Twitter.",
