When Natasha and Sam had found you in the bar you were delirious, a big grin on your face that was bearing towards a grimace. Sam had never seen your pupils so dilated, so much laughter but fear rising in your expression.</p><p>Whatever you had taken quickly died down, leaving you completely numb as they escorted you out of there as fast as they could for your own safety.\u00a0\u201cWhatever happened, no one can know.\u201d Natasha states and Sam nods in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d we leave the party?\u201d You slur your words as you pout up to Natasha who scoffs lightly.\u00a0\u201cI wanna dance you guys!\u201d Raising your voice you force yourself from your friends, falling over nothing as you smack your face on the cool marble flooring.<br/></p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/n.\u201d Sam mutters as he reaches down to help you up, unaware of the blood around your nose as you had hit the ground.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Light footsteps came through the hallway until Natasha swore under her breath. Sam had a hold of you lightly in his arms as Tony stood before the three of you, his arms crossed as he glared to you all.\u00a0</p><p>That was until he saw your face.\u00a0</p><p>He noticed the blood falling from your nose as tears lined your cheeks. Pain evident in your eyes as you forced a smile to him.\u00a0\u201cHey Tony, we in trouble?\u201d You stammer as you glance back to Sam who wears a straight face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Tony steps forward as his muscles are burning with fury as Natasha shakes her head.\u00a0\u201cWhat. Happened.\u201d He clenches his jaw as he lightly takes a hold of your arm from Sam, looking at you with such concern you won\u2019t even remember.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe took something. We, we were gone for a split second.\u201d Sam stuttered, but Tony lifted his hand, not wanting to hear any more.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d Tony speaks up as you limply lean against him, dyeing his white shirt crimson.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll talk in the morning.\u201d He exchanges a final glance with Natasha and Sam before walking slowly with you back towards your suite.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Sam lets out a heavy sigh whilst Natasha remains silent.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe going to be okay?\u201d Sam asks Natasha as they walk down the long corridor, the sight of Tony and Y/n long gone.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Tony, I wonder more so if he\u2019ll be okay.\u201d She jokes and Sam doesn\u2019t respond.\u00a0\u201cOh come on.\u201d She laughs lightly, but Sam merely shrugs his shoulders.<br/></p><p>The shared looks between Tony and Y/n weren\u2019t subtle but remained unspoken between the pair. He was always going to look out for her, and she would always be there for him.\u00a0</p><p>As Tony helped you towards your suite your words were becoming more nonsensical by the minute. He tried to ignore them and focus on ensuring you were okay. Yet here you were, leaning on him for once rather than brushing him off. You were always denying yourself of accepting his glances, telling yourself they meant nothing. But to Tony, it meant more than you understood.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd then I saw my drink fizz and he told me to drink up.\u201d You mumble as you reach for your door, still unable to keep yourself upright and Tony\u2019s hands go straight for your waist, keeping you balanced.\u00a0<br/></p><p>A laugh escapes your lips as you turn back to face Tony, a small distance between the two of you as his brows furrow.\u00a0\u201cHe, he spiked your drink?\u201d He tries to control the venom in his tone, but when you nod he can feel his blood pumping like fire through his veins.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe told me pretty girls do as they\u2019re told.\u201d You shrug your shoulders as you lock eyes with Tony.\u00a0\u201cAnd I wanted to feel pretty.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing.\u00a0\u201cY/n,\u201d He whispered as the door clicked and you wandered inside as you swayed from side to side until you fell onto your bed.\u00a0\u201cyou don\u2019t believe that, do you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Lifting your head up he can see the sorrow in your eyes as fresh tears replace the old.\u00a0\u201cI guess I do.\u201d You mumbled.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to feel wanted, even if it was temporary.\u201d Bringing your legs close to your chest faintly you could hear what you were saying.\u00a0</p><p>Stepping forward Tony sat down on the edge of your bed, causing it to dip ever so lightly.\u00a0\u201cPlease don\u2019t ever say that.\u201d He states as he lifts his head up, his eyes focusing on your exhausted face.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re always wanted, Y/n. Fuck, I wish I could explain.\u201d He sighs loudly as he rises to his feet, your eyes carefully watching him.\u00a0\u201cI will always want you, Y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be nice because I\u2019m wasted, Tony.\u201d You sigh as you lie down, burying your head into your pillow as the tears fall along your nose, dripping across to the pillow with a light patter.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He speaks up before lying down across from you, making you see him.\u00a0\u201cIf I was I wouldn\u2019t tell you that you make me laugh by pulling those dumb facial expressions. Or when you dance around you make me want to join in. Or the time you managed to move Thor&rsquo;s hammer with your telekinesis I never felt more attracted to you. Or when you first joined I was in awe of you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Every single word is true, but you won\u2019t remember them.\u00a0</p><p>Tony places his hand on your cheek as you struggle to keep your eyes open and you move closer into him.\u00a0\u201cTony?\u201d You whisper as you hide your face in his neck. He mumbles in response as you lift your eyes up.\u00a0\u201cWill you tell me this in the morning?

You jumped and almost kicked him across the room &ldquo;Steve don&rsquo;t do that!!&rdquo; He looked slightly frightened but soon started to smile. &ldquo;Sorry (Y/N).&rdquo; He turned around with a small chuckle. &ldquo;See Bucky, I told you I could scare her.&rdquo;</p><p>&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;</p><p>PEITRO: it was a lazy and rainy day in New York and the avengers were all sitting around watching some horror movies. You were already tense when you heard a strange noise. You looked behind you&hellip;nothing there. You heard it again&hellip; still nothing. You turned around and Peitro was standing in front of you. Suddenly without thinking you swung right into his hip knocking him off balance. &ldquo;(Y/N) it&rsquo;s just me!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh my gosh Peitro?! I&rsquo;m sorry my instincts just kicked in, I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Its ok it was still fun.&rdquo; And with that Peitro zoomed back to his seat as the other avengers chuckled at his actions.</p><p>&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;</p><p>BUCKY:&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think Bucky would try to scare you because he does the same thing when people scare him.</p><p>&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;</p><p>CLINT: You we&rsquo;re walking towards the training room when you heard noises from the vents. You continued walking with caution. You heard the noises again and sprinted to the training room where the other avengers were waiting as fast as you could. Right before you entered the training room Clint dropped down from the vents making your hands shoot out and knocking him to the ground. &ldquo;Oh my gosh! Clint! I told you to stop doing that, you know how I react.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sorry (Y/N), I guess I forgot.&rdquo; Clint gave you a sheepish smile and you gave him a hug. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright just please don&rsquo;t do it again, ok?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; And with that the two of you made your way to training to see a very amused Natasha. &ldquo;I told you it was a bad idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;&#127804;</p><p>THOR:&hellip;Since Thor was always being scared by Loki I don&rsquo;t think he would try to scare other people.</p>",
