They would\u2019ve never guessed how fast their last year of high school would go by. But finally, it was Christmas break, and everyone was heading out or home for the holidays.</p><p>As normal, Aunt May and Peter were invited to the Leed\u2019s place for Christmas, and as normal, Aunt May was bringing her famous frozen lasagna.</p><p>Peter sat in his room, fresh out of school, staring at his messy desk. He knew if Aunt May stepped foot in his room he would never hear the end of how he needs to learn to keep his own place clean.</p><p>*bing!*</p><p>The boy glanced over at his phone and saw a text from Ned.</p><p><b>Guy in Chair</b>: <i>hey dude, Mia came home a day early so our family is gonna go hang out. maybe we can hang tomorrow?</i></p><p><b>Spidey-boy</b>: <i>hey no hard feelings! that\u2019s totally fine, tell mia i said hi!</i></p><p>He hit send and fell back on his bed and sighed.

Do you want me to get caught?!\u201d Peter threw off his mask and it landed on the ground somewhere.</p><p>Peter had decided to go on patrol when Ned went out with his family. He was out for hours, loosing track of time as the sun went down. It was well after dark when he had spotted some perv attacking a young woman in an alley. As he interfered to save the woman, he learned that it was none other than his best friend\u2019s sister, Mia Leeds.</p><p>\u201cPeter what the hell is this?\u201d The girl whisper yelled. She had never been more confused in her life. Her younger brother\u2019s best friend had just saved her from being sexually assaulted&hellip; but in some kind of spider suit?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s kinda hard to explain in an abandoned parking garage, Mia! If you would just calm down, I could explain.\u201d Peter explained as he fidgeted with his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to calm down?! One second I\u2019m being attacked by some perv, then the next someone in some kind of,\u201d She gestured to the boy\u2019s suit \u201cbug get up swoops me up and all within the same ten seconds, I\u2019m flying through the air! And now we\u2019re in an abandoned parking garage and I found out that the super hunk that saved me is my little brother\u2019s best friend?\u201d Mia\u2019s hands were flying around as she spoke, she tended to talk with her hands. Peter was desperately trying to calm her down so he could talk, and also so no one would hear her yelling.</p><p>\u201cMia, Mia I know it\u2019s weird but-\u201d He stopped and looked at the older girl in front of him. \u201cDid you say I\u2019m a&hellip; hunk?\u201d Mia\u2019s face started to redden with blush while Peter\u2019s mouth tugged into a smirk.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Parker!\u201d She yelled at him, crossing her arms and ducking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m attracted to you or anything, you just have really nice muscles is all.\u201d Peter\u2019s smile was still plastered on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat- what would happen, do you think, if you DID have a crush on me?\u201d Peter stayed where he was, not wanting to overwhelm his childhood friend. His smile soon became a smirk of teasing. Mia\u2019s head shot up to look at the younger boy.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Why would you even ask that?\u201d Mia scoffed, arms still crossed. Peter\u2019s eyes rolled to the sky and then met back up with hers.</p><p>\u201cBecause maybe I do have a crush on you. Maybe I have for a while.\u201d Peter mirrored her in the sense of crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not a little kid anymore, Mia. Yeah, I\u2019m still in High School but I\u2019m eighteen now. A lot more grown up than you remember.\u201d Mia\u2019s face continued to redden and she avoided looking at the spidey-boy.</p><p>\u201cOkay but I\u2019m still in college. It\u2019s not like that will ever work.\u201d She huffed, starting to call off all the reasons she never even entertained the thought of what it would be like with this high school boy.</p><p>\u201cAnd? I\u2019m going to that same college next year. You and I are both good people, we can make it through a semester of a long distance relationship.\u201d Peter took a step closer, trying to emphasize his point.</p><p>\u201cWell we\u2019re not going to be majoring in the same thing!\u201d Another dumb point. The boy scoffed again, uncrossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re smarter than that. People don\u2019t have to be the same major to be together.\u201d Mia knew that. She never admitted to it being a good reason. It was just a reason. Peter had continued to knock her off her pegs, but she had one last fight to put up.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ned?\u201d She finally brought her eyes up to his, confident that this would stunt his confidence. She was sure that this argument would be the be all end all of this conversation.</p><p>Mia had known Peter for as long as she can remember. There was a reason she never really thought about getting together with Peter, or even allowing herself to have a crush on him. Ned had a friend named Ryan, they were really close. Not as close as him and Peter, but still pretty close. Mia had allowed herself to fall for Ryan and they ended up dating. Due to Ryan being more immature than Mia, they broke up for stupid reasons. But that led to Ryan and Ned not hanging out or talking as much. Ryan would always talk trash about Mia and Ned wouldn\u2019t allow it. Ned purposely stopped hanging around Ryan, and Mia could see that it made Ned disappointed. So when Peter started high school with Ned and Mia noticed his face lightly dusted with freckles or his eyes that were pools of chocolate and honey, or even his beautiful brown curls that would fall over his forehead, she forbid herself from letting her heart take over.</p><p>So she was sure that this argument would be the one to make him lose that bright fire in his eyes. But it was Mia who was caught by surprise by this statement. Peter shook his head and let out a low chuckle.</p><p>\u201cNed? What about Ned? You think he\u2019d going to care if we\u2019re dating.?\u201d Peter put his hands on the college girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMia,\u201d His voice was low and quiet, sending chills up Mia\u2019s spine. \u201cIf Ned has a problem with us going out, then he\u2019s not my best friend after all. He knows how long I\u2019ve had a crush on you and he knows I would never, ever, hurt you. I don\u2019t care what people would think. I don\u2019t care if this gets me some kind of bragging rights for dating a college girl. I don\u2019t care about any of that stuff. All I care about is you.\u201d Peter removed his hands from her shoulders and they fell to his own sides. \u201cNed\u2019s told me about the idiotic college boys that you\u2019ve been dealing with this semester and it makes me so mad. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated like that. You deserve me.\u201d</p><p>Mia was shocked by his sudden boldness. Peter used to never talk more than three or four words when more than Ned was present. But here he was, fighting for her, making a case for them to be together. He really had grown up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend\u2019s sister, but I don\u2019t want that to stop us. You know me. You know how well I\u2019d treat you. All day,\u201d He stepped closer, leaning next to her ear and lowering his voice \u201cand all night.\u201d When he leaned back out Mia couldn\u2019t resist. Her heart said screw you to her brain and there was no going back now.</p><p>She put her hands on his cheeks and pulled him back towards her. Their lips collided and Peter tensed up at first impact. When his brain finally processed what was happening, his hands fell to her waist and grabbed them. It was a short and simple kiss, very sweet and romantic. Mia was the one to pull back, revealing the biggest smile on Peter\u2019s face. He was so happy he couldn\u2019t even form words. He didn\u2019t need to, Mia knew exactly what to say.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give it a shot.\u201d</p><p><b><i>extra tags:</i></b></p><p><b><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcXpu5I1H36UiT0jv2GnuWQ\" target=\"_blank\">@ninjamidnight</a></i></b></p>",

Peter was desperately trying to calm her down so he could talk, and also so no one would hear her yelling.</p><p>\u201cMia, Mia I know it\u2019s weird but-\u201d He stopped and looked at the older girl in front of him. \u201cDid you say I\u2019m a\u2026 hunk?\u201d Mia\u2019s face started to redden with blush while Peter\u2019s mouth tugged into a smirk.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Parker!\u201d She yelled at him, crossing her arms and ducking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m attracted to you or anything, you just have really nice muscles is all.\u201d Peter\u2019s smile was still plastered on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat- what would happen, do you think, if you DID have a crush on me?\u201d Peter stayed where he was, not wanting to overwhelm his childhood friend. His smile soon became a smirk of teasing. Mia\u2019s head shot up to look at the younger boy.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Why would you even ask that?\u201d Mia scoffed, arms still crossed. Peter\u2019s eyes rolled to the sky and then met back up with hers.</p><p>\u201cBecause maybe I do have a crush on you. Maybe I have for a while.\u201d Peter mirrored her in the sense of crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not a little kid anymore, Mia. Yeah, I\u2019m still in High School but I\u2019m eighteen now. A lot more grown up than you remember.\u201d Mia\u2019s face continued to redden and she avoided looking at the spidey-boy.</p><p>\u201cOkay but I\u2019m still in college. It\u2019s not like that will ever work.\u201d She huffed, starting to call off all the reasons she never even entertained the thought of what it would be like with this high school boy.</p><p>\u201cAnd? I\u2019m going to that same college next year. You and I are both good people, we can make it through a semester of a long distance relationship.\u201d Peter took a step closer, trying to emphasize his point.</p><p>\u201cWell we\u2019re not going to be majoring in the same thing!\u201d Another dumb point. The boy scoffed again, uncrossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re smarter than that. People don\u2019t have to be the same major to be together.\u201d Mia knew that. She never admitted to it being a good reason. It was just a reason. Peter had continued to knock her off her pegs, but she had one last fight to put up.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ned?\u201d She finally brought her eyes up to his, confident that this would stunt his confidence. She was sure that this argument would be the be all end all of this conversation.</p><p>Mia had known Peter for as long as she can remember. There was a reason she never really thought about getting together with Peter, or even allowing herself to have a crush on him. Ned had a friend named Ryan, they were really close. Not as close as him and Peter, but still pretty close. Mia had allowed herself to fall for Ryan and they ended up dating. Due to Ryan being more immature than Mia, they broke up for stupid reasons. But that led to Ryan and Ned not hanging out or talking as much. Ryan would always talk trash about Mia and Ned wouldn\u2019t allow it. Ned purposely stopped hanging around Ryan, and Mia could see that it made Ned disappointed. So when Peter started high school with Ned and Mia noticed his face lightly dusted with freckles or his eyes that were pools of chocolate and honey, or even his beautiful brown curls that would fall over his forehead, she forbid herself from letting her heart take over.</p><p>So she was sure that this argument would be the one to make him lose that bright fire in his eyes. But it was Mia who was caught by surprise by this statement. Peter shook his head and let out a low chuckle.</p><p>\u201cNed? What about Ned? You think he\u2019d going to care if we\u2019re dating.?\u201d Peter put his hands on the college girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMia,\u201d His voice was low and quiet, sending chills up Mia\u2019s spine. \u201cIf Ned has a problem with us going out, then he\u2019s not my best friend after all. He knows how long I\u2019ve had a crush on you and he knows I would never, ever, hurt you. I don\u2019t care what people would think. I don\u2019t care if this gets me some kind of bragging rights for dating a college girl. I don\u2019t care about any of that stuff. All I care about is you.\u201d Peter removed his hands from her shoulders and they fell to his own sides. \u201cNed\u2019s told me about the idiotic college boys that you\u2019ve been dealing with this semester and it makes me so mad. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated like that. You deserve me.\u201d</p><p>Mia was shocked by his sudden boldness. Peter used to never talk more than three or four words when more than Ned was present. But here he was, fighting for her, making a case for them to be together. He really had grown up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend\u2019s sister, but I don\u2019t want that to stop us. You know me. You know how well I\u2019d treat you. All day,\u201d He stepped closer, leaning next to her ear and lowering his voice \u201cand all night.\u201d When he leaned back out Mia couldn\u2019t resist. Her heart said screw you to her brain and there was no going back now.</p><p>She put her hands on his cheeks and pulled him back towards her. Their lips collided and Peter tensed up at first impact. When his brain finally processed what was happening, his hands fell to her waist and grabbed them. It was a short and simple kiss, very sweet and romantic. Mia was the one to pull back, revealing the biggest smile on Peter\u2019s face. He was so happy he couldn\u2019t even form words. He didn\u2019t need to, Mia knew exactly what to say.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give it a shot.\u201d</p><p><b><i>extra tags:</i></b></p><p><b><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcXpu5I1H36UiT0jv2GnuWQ\" target=\"_blank\">@ninjamidnight</a></i></b></p></p>",

And now we&rsquo;re in an abandoned parking garage and I found out that the super hunk that saved me is my little brother&rsquo;s best friend?&rdquo; Mia&rsquo;s hands were flying around as she spoke, she tended to talk with her hands. Peter was desperately trying to calm her down so he could talk, and also so no one would hear her yelling.</p><p>&ldquo;Mia, Mia I know it&rsquo;s weird but-&rdquo; He stopped and looked at the older girl in front of him. &ldquo;Did you say I&rsquo;m a&hellip; hunk?&rdquo; Mia&rsquo;s face started to redden with blush while Peter&rsquo;s mouth tugged into a smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Parker!&rdquo; She yelled at him, crossing her arms and ducking her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m attracted to you or anything, you just have really nice muscles is all.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s smile was still plastered on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;What- what would happen, do you think, if you DID have a crush on me?&rdquo; Peter stayed where he was, not wanting to overwhelm his childhood friend. His smile soon became a smirk of teasing. Mia&rsquo;s head shot up to look at the younger boy.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me? Why would you even ask that?&rdquo; Mia scoffed, arms still crossed. Peter&rsquo;s eyes rolled to the sky and then met back up with hers.</p><p>&ldquo;Because maybe I do have a crush on you. Maybe I have for a while.&rdquo; Peter mirrored her in the sense of crossing his arms over his chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a little kid anymore, Mia. Yeah, I&rsquo;m still in High School but I&rsquo;m eighteen now. A lot more grown up than you remember.&rdquo; Mia&rsquo;s face continued to redden and she avoided looking at the spidey-boy.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay but I&rsquo;m still in college. It&rsquo;s not like that will ever work.&rdquo; She huffed, starting to call off all the reasons she never even entertained the thought of what it would be like with this high school boy.</p><p>&ldquo;And? I&rsquo;m going to that same college next year. You and I are both good people, we can make it through a semester of a long distance relationship.&rdquo; Peter took a step closer, trying to emphasize his point.</p><p>&ldquo;Well we&rsquo;re not going to be majoring in the same thing!&rdquo; Another dumb point. The boy scoffed again, uncrossing his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? You&rsquo;re smarter than that. People don&rsquo;t have to be the same major to be together.&rdquo; Mia knew that. She never admitted to it being a good reason. It was just a reason. Peter had continued to knock her off her pegs, but she had one last fight to put up.</p><p>&ldquo;What about Ned?&rdquo; She finally brought her eyes up to his, confident that this would stunt his confidence. She was sure that this argument would be the be all end all of this conversation.</p><p>Mia had known Peter for as long as she can remember. There was a reason she never really thought about getting together with Peter, or even allowing herself to have a crush on him. Ned had a friend named Ryan, they were really close. Not as close as him and Peter, but still pretty close. Mia had allowed herself to fall for Ryan and they ended up dating. Due to Ryan being more immature than Mia, they broke up for stupid reasons. But that led to Ryan and Ned not hanging out or talking as much. Ryan would always talk trash about Mia and Ned wouldn&rsquo;t allow it. Ned purposely stopped hanging around Ryan, and Mia could see that it made Ned disappointed. So when Peter started high school with Ned and Mia noticed his face lightly dusted with freckles or his eyes that were pools of chocolate and honey, or even his beautiful brown curls that would fall over his forehead, she forbid herself from letting her heart take over.</p><p>So she was sure that this argument would be the one to make him lose that bright fire in his eyes. But it was Mia who was caught by surprise by this statement. Peter shook his head and let out a low chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned? What about Ned? You think he&rsquo;d going to care if we&rsquo;re dating.?&rdquo; Peter put his hands on the college girl&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Mia,&rdquo; His voice was low and quiet, sending chills up Mia&rsquo;s spine. &ldquo;If Ned has a problem with us going out, then he&rsquo;s not my best friend after all. He knows how long I&rsquo;ve had a crush on you and he knows I would never, ever, hurt you. I don&rsquo;t care what people would think. I don&rsquo;t care if this gets me some kind of bragging rights for dating a college girl. I don&rsquo;t care about any of that stuff. All I care about is you.&rdquo; Peter removed his hands from her shoulders and they fell to his own sides. &ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s told me about the idiotic college boys that you&rsquo;ve been dealing with this semester and it makes me so mad. You don&rsquo;t deserve to be treated like that. You deserve me.&rdquo;</p><p>Mia was shocked by his sudden boldness. Peter used to never talk more than three or four words when more than Ned was present. But here he was, fighting for her, making a case for them to be together. He really had grown up.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my best friend&rsquo;s sister, but I don&rsquo;t want that to stop us. You know me. You know how well I&rsquo;d treat you. All day,&rdquo; He stepped closer, leaning next to her ear and lowering his voice &ldquo;and all night.&rdquo; When he leaned back out Mia couldn&rsquo;t resist. Her heart said screw you to her brain and there was no going back now.</p><p>She put her hands on his cheeks and pulled him back towards her. Their lips collided and Peter tensed up at first impact. When his brain finally processed what was happening, his hands fell to her waist and grabbed them. It was a short and simple kiss, very sweet and romantic. Mia was the one to pull back, revealing the biggest smile on Peter&rsquo;s face. He was so happy he couldn&rsquo;t even form words. He didn&rsquo;t need to, Mia knew exactly what to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give it a shot.&rdquo;</p><p><b><i>extra tags:</i></b></p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcXpu5I1H36UiT0jv2GnuWQ\" target=\"_blank\">@ninjamidnight</a></i></b></p></p>",
