He kept replaying the argument over and over again \u2013 desperately trying to figure out how things had spiralled so quickly \u2013 and every time he recalled the stricken expression marring his boyfriend\u2019s beautiful face, he felt like throwing up. Cyrus hadn\u2019t deserved any of the horrible words he\u2019d spewed at him, his anger brought on by his own stupidity in the wake of his latest math test. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhy do you even bother?\u201d\u00a0</i>he remembered himself saying \u2013 no,\u00a0<i>screaming\u00a0</i>\u2013 at Cyrus.\u00a0<i>\u201cI\u2019m a fucking idiot, okay? You can\u2019t fix me! Stop trying to\u00a0</i>fix\u00a0<i>me, goddamn it!\u201d</i></p><p>After kicking a cloud of dust into the air, he\u2019d thrown his bag onto the ground and emptied his lungs at the sky, his throat raw from shouting by the time he\u2019d finished. Cyrus had stood quietly on the edge of the park, silent tears streaming down his face as he waited for TJ to calm down.</p><p><i>\u201cCome home with me,\u201d\u00a0</i>he\u2019d begged.\u00a0<i>\u201cMy mom will make you dinner. We can watch a movie. Please, TJ. I hate seeing you like this.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen go away!\u201d\u00a0</i>he\u2019d yelled in retaliation, aiming all of his anger at Cyrus in that one, heated moment. The sadness in Cyrus\u2019 eyes had cut him like a knife, but that hadn\u2019t stopped him from saying more.\u00a0<i>\u201cYou don\u2019t even like me, do you? Just admit it! I\u2019m just a fucking project to you, aren\u2019t I? Just\u00a0</i>say\u00a0<i>it!\u201d</i></p><p>Cyrus had shrunk back, as if burnt by his words, and wept even harder than before.\u00a0<i>\u201dI love you, TJ! You know I do! I just want to help \u2013\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help! Don\u2019t you get it? I don\u2019t need anyone!\u201d</i></p><p>The rest was a blur. All he remembered was Cyrus reaching forward \u2013 cautiously, like TJ was a vicious animal \u2013 and squeezing his hand once, briefly, before turning around and walking away. That had been almost three days ago, and he hadn\u2019t spoken to him since.</p><p>Without Cyrus to offer him comfort, he retreated to the park, hoping to organise his thoughts and figure things out. But when he arrived, he found the swing set already occupied, a familiar mop of dark hair hiding the other boy\u2019s face. His feet were dragging across the ground, keeping the swing at a slow, steady pace, and TJ could hear the quiet mumbling of a song falling from his lips.</p><p>\u201cLegs go up, legs go down. That\u2019s how we make the swing go \u2018round. Drag your feet, you go slow. The more you drag, the less you go \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice song.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him, his grip instantly tightening on the chains of the swing. It was so reminiscent of the first time they really talked that TJ couldn\u2019t help but smile, his heart pinching with nostalgia. Before he knew what he was doing, he took a step forward, his hand resting on the blue frame, and said, \u201cChocolate chocolate chip muffin, right?\u201d</p><p>For a second, he didn\u2019t think Cyrus was going to play along, but then the younger boy surprised him with a small, tentative smile. \u201cScary-basketball-guy.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched fondly at the old nickname. \u201cDo you hang out\u00a0here a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m feeling bad about myself,\u201d Cyrus said, the humour seeping out of his tone. He returned his eyes to the ground with a noncommittal shrug. \u201cLike when my boyfriend shouts at me for trying to help him, then ignores my calls for three days straight.\u201d</p><p>TJ winced. \u201cCyrus, I\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. You didn\u2019t deserve that.\u00a0<i>Any\u00a0</i>of it. I was just embarrassed, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never need to feel embarrassed around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, wringing his hands together as he dared to sit on the swing next to Cyrus. After a beat of silence, he took his hand and cradled it against his chest, ducking his head to meet Cyrus\u2019 downcast gaze. \u201cI trust you more than anyone, Cy. But even\u00a0<i>you\u00a0</i>can\u2019t help me sometimes.\u201d He sucked in a deep breath, his chest growing tight. \u201cWhen it gets really bad, I lash out at people. And it makes me feel like crap, but I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s like my mind goes red.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him with confused, watery eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s why I gave you space,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then you kept on ignoring my calls\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you want to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew I\u2019d hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think to apologise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might hate me,\u201d he admitted, squeezing Cyrus\u2019 hand as if it were a stress ball. \u201cI\u2019m not a good person, Cyrus. Not all the time. Not like you are\u2026 I guess I was just scared you might\u2019ve figured that out and decided to drop me for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>Delicate fingers cupped his jaw and tilted his head upwards, greeting him with the gorgeous \u2013\u00a0albeit sad\u00a0\u2013 smile of his boyfriend beaming down at him, his bottom lip trembling slightly. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop doing that,\u201d Cyrus whispered, his soft hands petting the back of his\u00a0hair. \u201cStop trying to push me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you deserve me, right? That\u2019s what this is all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot,\u201d Cyrus murmured, but there was no heat in his words. Instead, a teasing smile dimpled his cheeks as he leaned forward and kissed TJ\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re a good person,\u201d he said, his lips still pressed against his skin. \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect, TJ.\u00a0<i>Me\u00a0</i>included. And if we really want to make this work, we can\u2019t be afraid to show our imperfections to each other. Do you get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>TJ swallowed thickly. \u201cYeah. I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you, no matter what. Through the bad times as well as the good. You just have to let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looped an arm around Cyrus\u2019 waist and tugged him onto his lap, their foreheads closing the gap like a pair of magnets. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t push you away anymore\u2026 I can\u2019t stand the thought of losing you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus kissed him softly. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry, Cy \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to make it up to you?\u00a0Whatever you want, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay with me,\u201d Cyrus said, his eyes fluttering closed as he pressed his cheek against TJ\u2019s chest. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d TJ pulled him closer and buried a smile in the crook of his neck.\u00a0\u201cI can do that.\u201d</p>",

It&rsquo;s like my mind goes red.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him with confused, watery eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I gave you space,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But then you kept on ignoring my calls&hellip; Why didn&rsquo;t you want to talk to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I knew I&rsquo;d hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think to apologise?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you might hate me,&rdquo; he admitted, squeezing Cyrus&rsquo; hand as if it were a stress ball. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a good person, Cyrus. Not all the time. Not like you are&hellip; I guess I was just scared you might&rsquo;ve figured that out and decided to drop me for good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t blame you.&rdquo;</p><p>Delicate fingers cupped his jaw and tilted his head upwards, greeting him with the gorgeous &ndash;&nbsp;albeit sad&nbsp;&ndash; smile of his boyfriend beaming down at him, his bottom lip trembling slightly. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop doing that,&rdquo; Cyrus whispered, his soft hands petting the back of his&nbsp;hair. &ldquo;Stop trying to push me away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think you deserve me, right? That&rsquo;s what this is all about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such an idiot,&rdquo; Cyrus murmured, but there was no heat in his words. Instead, a teasing smile dimpled his cheeks as he leaned forward and kissed TJ&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good person,&rdquo; he said, his lips still pressed against his skin. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s perfect, TJ.&nbsp;<i>Me&nbsp;</i>included. And if we really want to make this work, we can&rsquo;t be afraid to show our imperfections to each other. Do you get what I&rsquo;m saying?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ swallowed thickly. &ldquo;Yeah. I think so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to be with you, no matter what. Through the bad times as well as the good. You just have to let me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You promise?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He looped an arm around Cyrus&rsquo; waist and tugged him onto his lap, their foreheads closing the gap like a pair of magnets. &ldquo;I promise I won&rsquo;t push you away anymore&hellip; I can&rsquo;t stand the thought of losing you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus kissed him softly. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really am sorry, Cy &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can I do to make it up to you?&nbsp;Whatever you want, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just stay with me,&rdquo; Cyrus said, his eyes fluttering closed as he pressed his cheek against TJ&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; TJ pulled him closer and buried a smile in the crook of his neck.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can do that.&rdquo;</p></p>",

This means that when Andi Mack won an award in 2018, it was winning an award based on the episodes that aired in 2017, which included all of season one and the first 6 episodes of season 2. This year\u2019s award ceremony will be rewarding media that aired last year (2018) - meaning everything between episode 207 (\u201dHead Over Heels\u201d) and 307 (\u201dThe New Girls\u201d) was eligible for this nomination.\u00a0</p><p>This means that Bex\u2019s subtextual advice about \u201cCyrus in progress\u201d, Cyrus breaking up with Iris, the original swing set scene with TJ, Cyrus coming out to Andi at the Bar Mitzvah, pretty much all of the relationship building with TJ, Cyrus talking about his crush on Jonah changing, and TJ looking back at Cyrus were all scenes taken into account in nominating Andi Mack for the award this year - as well as any moments that happened in 3a.\u00a0</p><p>This also means that even if Andi Mack does not get renewed for a 4th season, it will still technically be eligible for the award in 2020, based on the 14 episodes airing in 2019.\u00a0</p><p>Beyond these facts - this is a new category.

There\u2019s a difference between fantasy queer cartoons and an actual gay middle school student figuring out life. Cyrus\u2019 storyline is still important. Even if a lot of it is subtext. Even if it doesn\u2019t always focus on his sexuality. Even if his relationship is a slow burn. He is normalizing what it means to be gay in middle school, and starting conversations with young people and parents.

Cyrus could tell he had been crying based on his scratchy voice. The boys sat in silence while Cyrus tried to come up with something to say.</p><p>\u201cYou broke my heart and all you can say is sorry?\u201d Cyrus tried to muster up the most challenging face he could.</p><p>\u201cLook, Underdog-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t call me that.\u201d Cyrus interrupted much louder than intended.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, I was an idiot, okay?\u201d Cyrus could hear the hurt in his voice but was trying his hardest to block it out, \u201cYou can call it all off and be pissed with me for the rest of your life if you want but I at least want you to know that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked at him with the most pleading eyes he had ever seen and Cyrus could feel himself melting. No, Cyrus. He can&rsquo;t just do this to you.</p><p>At that Cyrus straightened up and spoke to TJ one last time, looking him directly in the eyes and speaking in the most calm and collected voice he could find.</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t just screw up then waltz back into my life like nothings wrong! I\u2019m sorry, TJ, but I can\u2019t do this anymore. We\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t bare to even look at TJ\u2019s face. He quickly turned on his heel and stormed away before the taller boy could respond or try to salvage what he had destroyed. Cyrus could feel tears burning his eyes and kept having to fight back the urge to run back to TJ and apologize and tell him everything was going to be okay. But to be honest with you, it wasn\u2019t. Nothing was okay and it probably never would be. But Cyrus did what he had to do and there was no going back now.</p><p>2 years and it\u2019s over just like that,</p>",
