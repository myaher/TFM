He was polite - paid for their drinks and did all the expected stuff like asking him about school, his parents and his hobbies. But there was a certain lack of warmth about the man, even when addressing his own son, that made Eliott uneasy. Like this whole situation was some sort of formality. His and Lucas\u2019s exchanges seemed marred with an edge of tension, no matter how much they seemed to try and play nice. Eliott couldn\u2019t help but notice Lucas clenching his jaw and starting to fidget with his fingers under the table towards the end of the meeting.</p><p>By the time they were getting the metro back to Lucas\u2019s it was rush hour, so was busy enough that they had to stand. And maybe Eliott stood a little closer than was really necessary, and pulled Lucas against his chest with one hand, silently resting his chin on the shorter boy\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t say anything in response, only sighed and closed his eyes for a moment, laying his hand lightly on top of Eliott\u2019s where it rested against his belly.</p></blockquote><p><strike>#2</strike></p><blockquote><p>Eliott is yet to meet Lucas\u2019s maman.

Despite his nerves, this is definitely something he wants to do.</p><p>At first, Mr and Mrs Demaury are cautious, without being stand-offish. They were well aware of their son\u2019s tendency to wear his heart on his sleeve and become infatuated at the drop of a hat, and of the events surrounding Lucas and Eliott coming together. They were concerned for his well-being, if slightly overprotective.

They had trusted Lucille.</p><p>But, starting with a homemade dinner in their slightly cramped dining room (books piled high everywhere - the stereotypical home of two academics), they started on the road to eventually liking and trusting him too. Lucas had been nervous at first, but soon eased into conversation with Mrs Demaury about their shared interest in/skills on the piano (and her joking disdain that Eliott never quite took to it himself) and Mr Demaury about his love of science, all discussed with the comforting pressure of Eliott\u2019s hand resting casually on his upper thigh under the table.</p><p>The night drawing to a natural close, Eliott and his father exited to the kitchen with the dirty dishes and Lucas was left alone in the hallway with Mrs Demaury as he readied himself to leave.
