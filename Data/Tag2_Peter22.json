But then again, the kid was always dramatizing things.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cBonjour Madame Blais!\u201d Called out a lean, curly haired boy, his chestnut curls falling in front of his matching eyes. The black leggings he was sporting accentuated every muscle in his legs as he walked, his white t-shirt letting only a peak of his collarbones show through at the top. To any passing stranger, he was the epitome of grace.</p><p>\u201cAh! Bonjour Monsieur Parker!\u201d Responded an older French woman who appeared to be in her late fifties, her graying jet black hair pulled into a tight bun at the back of her head, her lips curling into a friendly yet frightening smile.\u00a0\u201c\u00c9tendue.\u201d She briskly ordered as Peter dropped his bag on the floor. He nodded quickly as he shuffled through said bag, searching for his slippers. As much as Peter admired and envied the girls who went on pointe, it was not traditional for a guy to do so. Well, it wasn\u2019t unheard of, but Madam Blais would let Peter dance on pointe over her dead body. And Peter was okay with that. He was okay with playing male leads, no matter how he dreamed of waltzing across the stage as Odette. It was what it was.</p><p>\u201cYo! Parker!\u201d Peter whipped his head around to face the source of the noise, a girl about his age with curly brown hair and dark skin.</p><p>\u201cMJ! How was Paris?\u201d He asked as he swiftly leapt to his feet and rushed to his friend, his hands grasping hers.</p><p>\u201cIt was so beautiful! I painted so many sunsets, they were just too gorgeous, I had to! Oh and don\u2019t even get me started on the ballet-\u201c MJ was soon cut off by someone clearing their throat, Madam Blais it so happened.</p><p>\u201cChit chat is for later. I have something important to discuss.\u201d She spoke, the words rolling off her tongue along with her thick French accent. Peter admired the woman and all that she had done. She had been one of the most renowned dancers in Paris, and he was now one of her students. It was a dream come true.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow evening is opening. We have many special guests attending, and I need it to be absolutely flawless. No tripping, no falling, no messing up, no missing cues. Understood?\u201d Peter along with the rest of the class all frantically nodded their heads. Madam Blais was a kind woman, but good god was she horrifying when she wasn\u2019t. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>He was gorgeous. Stunning even. He belonged at the very center, not pushed to the side. That\u2019s how Tony Stark saw it. None of the others had captured him the way the young man had, and boy oh boy was he going have a few words with the instructor afterwards. But for now, all he could do was watch as he leapt and sashayed across the stage, his muscular yet slim pale limbs stretching to create the most delicate lines. Tony was sure that if he even breathed on the boy, he would shatter into a million pieces. He was ethereal, you could say.</p><p>When the performance came to a close, Tony was the first to stand up, his hands already stinging from how furiously he was clapping. Dear god he wanted to take that boy home and absolutely spoil him, and that\u2019s exactly what he planned on doing.</p><p>\u201cMadam Blais!\u201d Tony called out as he rushed backstage, the security guards immediately stepping aside for him because who didn\u2019t know who Tony fucking Stark was?</p><p>\u201cAh! Monsieur Stark! Avez-vous appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le spectacle?\u201d She asked, straightening the purple scarf that was wrapped around her neck. Tony finally reached the woman and stretched out his hand for her to shake.</p><p>\u201cC'\u00e9tait stup\u00e9fiant, madam.\u201d He responded as she took his hand, giving it one firm shake. \u201cQui \u00e9tait le gar\u00e7on, si \u00e7a ne vous d\u00e9range pas de demander?\u201d Madam Blais raised an eyebrow as an amused smile stretched across her face.</p><p>\u201cTu veux dire Peter Parker?\u201d Tony quickly nodded his head as she lead him down the hallway, dressing rooms lining each side until they stopped in front of a door with a plaque that read \u2018Parker\u2019. Madam Blais knocked her bony knuckles against the wooden door, a youthful voice responding from the other side.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d The next thing Tony knew, a young, lithe boy was stood in front of him, his eyes shining with amazement. \u201cM-Mr. Stark!\u201d The boy stumbled out, his cheeks quickly becoming a beautiful shade of dusty pink.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker. May I come in?\u201d He asked, glancing back at Madam Blais who winked at him before making her way down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cO-of course!\u201d Peter quickly stepped aside to allow Tony enterance. As soon as he was inside, Peter shut the door behind him. </p><p>\u201cYour performance was absolutely stunning, I must say. I was drawn to you almost immediately.\u201d Peter blushed at his words, turning away in attempt to hide it as he carefully zipped his costume bag up and hung it on the rack.</p><p>\u201cMerci. But I really am not worthy of your praise. You should be complimenting Isabella. She was Odette, was she not?\u201d He quickly stated with a sad smile. God, he wanted that so bad. But it would never happen.</p><p>\u201cSure, she may have been the main character, but you? You put so much heart and soul into every step that I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes from you.\u201d Tony\u2019s words hung in the air, Peter\u2019s breathing and heartbeat increasing in speed. No one had ever spoken to him in such a way. No one had complimented him like that. They always go straight to the lead woman and might, just might, spare him a \u201cGood job\u201d. It stung like hell, but Tony\u2019s words, just his simple words, somehow began to heal that wound. Peter barely knew the man, and yet here he was ready to through himself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Peter asked, still unable to believe what he had heard.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Assured Tony. \u201cNow. How about I take you out for dinner?\u201d Great. He broke the moment.</p><p>\u201cOh- no thank you Mr. Stark-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTony. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then um, no thank you Tony. I tend to stay under 1,000 calories, and well, I\u2019ve already reached my daily limit. But thank you for your offer, really.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes widened at the kid\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cYou- Peter, that\u2019s not healthy. Especially with all the dancing you do-\u201c Peter cut him off before he could finish, an uncomfortable smile forming on his lips.</p><p>\u201cGotta stay thin somehow, sir. And that\u2019s not gonna happen if I eat willy nilly, now is it? Have you seen those girls up there? There\u2019s nothing to them. I\u2019m no exception.\u201d Tony sat in silence as Peter slipped off his slippers, his bruised toes bleeding around the loose nails on his dainty feet. Sure, Tony knew it was common for a dancer\u2019s feet to become absolutely destroyed, but he had never seen it in person and good god. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps we skip dinner and I take you back to my place?\u201d He suggested, trying to rid himself of the thought of Peter starving himself and destroying his body just to look like the ideal dancer. Lucky for him, Peter turned back towards him as he tied up his other sneaker.</p><p>\u201cI would love to, Tony.\u201d The two smiled at each other, Peter grabbing his black dance bag, and swinging it over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Tony offered and arm to Peter who took it gladly. They walked down the hall, many of the other ballerinas pausing to give Peter not-so-discrete thumbs ups or winks among other things. Tony had to suppress his smile. Dance companies really were like families. </p><p>Once they had reached his car, Tony opened the door for Peter, the latter smiling at the older man as he bit his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cMerci.\u201d He said once again, almost&hellip; seductively? No, Tony had to be imagining things. He was the one doing the flirting here, not the other way around. Tony shook his head as he walked around the car and climbed in the driver\u2019s side, adjusting his rear view mirror. He already knew that tonight was going to be a long night.</p>",

Bonjour Monsieur Parker!\u201d Responded an older French woman who appeared to be in her late fifties, her graying jet black hair pulled into a tight bun at the back of her head, her lips curling into a friendly yet frightening smile.\u00a0\u201c\u00c9tendue.\u201d She briskly ordered as Peter dropped his bag on the floor. He nodded quickly as he shuffled through said bag, searching for his slippers. As much as Peter admired and envied the girls who went on pointe, it was not traditional for a guy to do so. Well, it wasn\u2019t unheard of, but Madam Blais would let Peter dance on pointe over her dead body. And Peter was okay with that. He was okay with playing male leads, no matter how he dreamed of waltzing across the stage as Odette. It was what it was.</p><p>\u201cYo! Parker!\u201d Peter whipped his head around to face the source of the noise, a girl about his age with curly brown hair and dark skin.</p><p>\u201cMJ! How was Paris?\u201d He asked as he swiftly leapt to his feet and rushed to his friend, his hands grasping hers.</p><p>\u201cIt was so beautiful! I painted so many sunsets, they were just too gorgeous, I had to! Oh and don\u2019t even get me started on the ballet-\u201c MJ was soon cut off by someone clearing their throat, Madam Blais it so happened.</p><p>\u201cChit chat is for later. I have something important to discuss.\u201d She spoke, the words rolling off her tongue along with her thick French accent. Peter admired the woman and all that she had done. She had been one of the most renowned dancers in Paris, and he was now one of her students. It was a dream come true.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow evening is opening. We have many special guests attending, and I need it to be absolutely flawless. No tripping, no falling, no messing up, no missing cues. Understood?\u201d Peter along with the rest of the class all frantically nodded their heads. Madam Blais was a kind woman, but good god was she horrifying when she wasn\u2019t. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>He was gorgeous. Stunning even. He belonged at the very center, not pushed to the side. That\u2019s how Tony Stark saw it. None of the others had captured him the way the young man had, and boy oh boy was he going have a few words with the instructor afterwards. But for now, all he could do was watch as he leapt and sashayed across the stage, his muscular yet slim pale limbs stretching to create the most delicate lines. Tony was sure that if he even breathed on the boy, he would shatter into a million pieces. He was ethereal, you could say.</p><p>When the performance came to a close, Tony was the first to stand up, his hands already stinging from how furiously he was clapping. Dear god he wanted to take that boy home and absolutely spoil him, and that\u2019s exactly what he planned on doing.</p><p>\u201cMadam Blais!\u201d Tony called out as he rushed backstage, the security guards immediately stepping aside for him because who didn\u2019t know who Tony fucking Stark was?</p><p>\u201cAh! Monsieur Stark! Avez-vous appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le spectacle?\u201d She asked, straightening the purple scarf that was wrapped around her neck. Tony finally reached the woman and stretched out his hand for her to shake.</p><p>\u201cC'\u00e9tait stup\u00e9fiant, madam.\u201d He responded as she took his hand, giving it one firm shake. \u201cQui \u00e9tait le gar\u00e7on, si \u00e7a ne vous d\u00e9range pas de demander?\u201d Madam Blais raised an eyebrow as an amused smile stretched across her face.</p><p>\u201cTu veux dire Peter Parker?\u201d Tony quickly nodded his head as she lead him down the hallway, dressing rooms lining each side until they stopped in front of a door with a plaque that read \u2018Parker\u2019. Madam Blais knocked her bony knuckles against the wooden door, a youthful voice responding from the other side.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d The next thing Tony knew, a young, lithe boy was stood in front of him, his eyes shining with amazement. \u201cM-Mr. Stark!\u201d The boy stumbled out, his cheeks quickly becoming a beautiful shade of dusty pink.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker. May I come in?\u201d He asked, glancing back at Madam Blais who winked at him before making her way down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cO-of course!\u201d Peter quickly stepped aside to allow Tony enterance. As soon as he was inside, Peter shut the door behind him. </p><p>\u201cYour performance was absolutely stunning, I must say. I was drawn to you almost immediately.\u201d Peter blushed at his words, turning away in attempt to hide it as he carefully zipped his costume bag up and hung it on the rack.</p><p>\u201cMerci. But I really am not worthy of your praise. You should be complimenting Isabella. She was Odette, was she not?\u201d He quickly stated with a sad smile. God, he wanted that so bad. But it would never happen.</p><p>\u201cSure, she may have been the main character, but you? You put so much heart and soul into every step that I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes from you.\u201d Tony\u2019s words hung in the air, Peter\u2019s breathing and heartbeat increasing in speed. No one had ever spoken to him in such a way. No one had complimented him like that. They always go straight to the lead woman and might, just might, spare him a \u201cGood job\u201d. It stung like hell, but Tony\u2019s words, just his simple words, somehow began to heal that wound. Peter barely knew the man, and yet here he was ready to through himself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Peter asked, still unable to believe what he had heard.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Assured Tony. \u201cNow. How about I take you out for dinner?\u201d Great. He broke the moment.</p><p>\u201cOh- no thank you Mr. Stark-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTony. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then um, no thank you Tony. I tend to stay under 1,000 calories, and well, I\u2019ve already reached my daily limit. But thank you for your offer, really.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes widened at the kid\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cYou- Peter, that\u2019s not healthy. Especially with all the dancing you do-\u201c Peter cut him off before he could finish, an uncomfortable smile forming on his lips.</p><p>\u201cGotta stay thin somehow, sir. And that\u2019s not gonna happen if I eat willy nilly, now is it? Have you seen those girls up there? There\u2019s nothing to them. I\u2019m no exception.\u201d Tony sat in silence as Peter slipped off his slippers, his bruised toes bleeding around the loose nails on his dainty feet. Sure, Tony knew it was common for a dancer\u2019s feet to become absolutely destroyed, but he had never seen it in person and good god. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps we skip dinner and I take you back to my place?\u201d He suggested, trying to rid himself of the thought of Peter starving himself and destroying his body just to look like the ideal dancer. Lucky for him, Peter turned back towards him as he tied up his other sneaker.</p><p>\u201cI would love to, Tony.\u201d The two smiled at each other, Peter grabbing his black dance bag, and swinging it over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Tony offered and arm to Peter who took it gladly. They walked down the hall, many of the other ballerinas pausing to give Peter not-so-discrete thumbs ups or winks among other things. Tony had to suppress his smile. Dance companies really were like families. </p><p>Once they had reached his car, Tony opened the door for Peter, the latter smiling at the older man as he bit his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cMerci.\u201d He said once again, almost\u2026 seductively? No, Tony had to be imagining things. He was the one doing the flirting here, not the other way around. Tony shook his head as he walked around the car and climbed in the driver\u2019s side, adjusting his rear view mirror. He already knew that tonight was going to be a long night.</p></p>",

But I really am not worthy of your praise. You should be complimenting Isabella. She was Odette, was she not?&rdquo; He quickly stated with a sad smile. God, he wanted that so bad. But it would never happen.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, she may have been the main character, but you? You put so much heart and soul into every step that I couldn&rsquo;t tear my eyes from you.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s words hung in the air, Peter&rsquo;s breathing and heartbeat increasing in speed. No one had ever spoken to him in such a way. No one had complimented him like that. They always go straight to the lead woman and might, just might, spare him a &ldquo;Good job&rdquo;. It stung like hell, but Tony&rsquo;s words, just his simple words, somehow began to heal that wound. Peter barely knew the man, and yet here he was ready to through himself into his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Peter asked, still unable to believe what he had heard.</p><p>&ldquo;Really.&rdquo; Assured Tony. &ldquo;Now. How about I take you out for dinner?&rdquo; Great. He broke the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh- no thank you Mr. Stark-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then um, no thank you Tony. I tend to stay under 1,000 calories, and well, I&rsquo;ve already reached my daily limit. But thank you for your offer, really.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes widened at the kid&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;You- Peter, that&rsquo;s not healthy. Especially with all the dancing you do-&ldquo; Peter cut him off before he could finish, an uncomfortable smile forming on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Gotta stay thin somehow, sir. And that&rsquo;s not gonna happen if I eat willy nilly, now is it? Have you seen those girls up there? There&rsquo;s nothing to them. I&rsquo;m no exception.&rdquo; Tony sat in silence as Peter slipped off his slippers, his bruised toes bleeding around the loose nails on his dainty feet. Sure, Tony knew it was common for a dancer&rsquo;s feet to become absolutely destroyed, but he had never seen it in person and good god. </p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps we skip dinner and I take you back to my place?&rdquo; He suggested, trying to rid himself of the thought of Peter starving himself and destroying his body just to look like the ideal dancer. Lucky for him, Peter turned back towards him as he tied up his other sneaker.</p><p>&ldquo;I would love to, Tony.&rdquo; The two smiled at each other, Peter grabbing his black dance bag, and swinging it over his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; Tony offered and arm to Peter who took it gladly. They walked down the hall, many of the other ballerinas pausing to give Peter not-so-discrete thumbs ups or winks among other things. Tony had to suppress his smile. Dance companies really were like families. </p><p>Once they had reached his car, Tony opened the door for Peter, the latter smiling at the older man as he bit his bottom lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Merci.&rdquo; He said once again, almost&hellip; seductively? No, Tony had to be imagining things. He was the one doing the flirting here, not the other way around. Tony shook his head as he walked around the car and climbed in the driver&rsquo;s side, adjusting his rear view mirror. He already knew that tonight was going to be a long night.</p></p>",

This is my first starker fic, and I would appreciate it if y&rsquo;all like, left constructive criticism or just comments for ya boy. Cause like, I&rsquo;m still exploring writing and such. Also, as a ballet dancer, I felt the need to write one of these and like low key exploit all the fucked up things that go on and also kinda point(e) out the fact that dudes don&rsquo;t normally go on pointe, unfortunately. :(</i></p>\n<p>Warnings: mention of an eating disorder, mention of blood</p>\n<p>It is absolutely exhilarating. The feeling of turning through the air with nothing but your own balance and strength to keep you up right and moving. Even a simple pirouette can spark adrenaline to course through your veins, your head whipping around so fast you feel as if you could pass out, yet your eyes manage to find your spot ever time, that simple object grounding you and keeping you in place. Or at least that&rsquo;s how Peter Parker would describe it to you. But then again, the kid was always dramatizing things.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",

Mr. Spider-Man!\u201d</p><p>A boy, about five years of age, ran full-tilt down the hall at St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital; he only stopped when he ran smack-dab into a pair of blue and red legs.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Peter Parker, known to many as Spider-Man, looked down at the small boy hugging his calf. </p><p>Peter had recently decided to give back to the community he helped keep safe. His aunt May had suggested going to a children\u2019s hospital in uniform, to help brighten the patients\u2019 spirits. St. Mary\u2019s was the closest, so he tried that one; he soon fell in love with the small patients there. </p><p>\u201cHey, DeMarcus! How\u2019s it goin\u2019, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what, Mr. Spider-Man!\u201d DeMarcus\u2019s little brown eyes gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lighting. \u201cThe doctors say I\u2019m all better! I have something called re&hellip;re&hellip; \u00a0ugh, Mommy, what was that <i>word</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemission,\u201d DeMarcus\u2019s mom said, smiling widely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that. But I get to go home, Mr. Spider-Man! Isn\u2019t that awesome??\u201d</p><p>Peter held out his gloved hand for a high-five, crouching down so he and DeMarcus were eye level. \u201cThat is so awesome, dude! I think that calls for a high-five.\u201d</p><p>DeMarcus giggled as he returned the high-five. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, Mr. Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you too, buddy. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy! Can you take a picture of me with Spider-Man?\u201d</p><p>DeMarcus\u2019s mom pulled out her phone, snapping a few pictures of the two of them together. \u201cThank you for doing this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really made him happy, that a real superhero took time out of his day just to come see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine, Ma\u2019am, really. DeMarcus is a good kid, I really am going to miss seeing him. Hey, buddy, can I get a hug?\u201d Peter asked, crouching down again.</p><p>Wordlessly, DeMarcus flung his arms around Peter. \u201cI love you, Mr. Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled. \u201cLove you too, buddy. I\u2019ll see you, okay? In the meantime, be good for me. Study hard in school and stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>DeMarcus nodded, firmly grasping his mother\u2019s hand. \u201cMommy! I can\u2019t wait to go back to school and tell everyone I\u2019m friends with Spider-Man!\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled as he walked down the hall.</p><p>\u201cIs that everyone?\u201d he\u2019d asked a nurse.</p><p>The nurse checked her chart. \u201cI know you don\u2019t normally go there, but you could visit the teen wing, maybe? It\u2019s not usually very full, which is why we don\u2019t usually have you go there. But\u2026 we have had one patient in there for a while now. Would you like me to see if she\u2019s up for a visitor?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSure.\u201d As the nurse walked down the hall, Peter sat down in a chair. \u201cKaren, any messages for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cText message from Science Bro Shuri. Displayed or read aloud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisplayed is fine, thanks, Karen.\u201d</p><p><i>Hey Spider-Doofus. When you get done there, come by the lab. Got a little something for ya</i></p><p>Peter chuckled. Probably a suit upgrade, again. Ever since she came to America to work for Stark Industries, carrying on Tony\u2019s work, she had been upgrading his suit at every opportunity.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d the nurse said. Peter followed her down a hallway, into a room on the corner; the nurse peeked her head in. \u201c(y/n)? You ready for your visitor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Forgot to ask who it is, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle. \u201cIs it <i>really </i>Spider-Man, or is it just my uncle Leo in a rented costume again? Because <i>that </i>was kind of a bummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the real deal, (y/n). Can he come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake him prove it,\u201d the girl called out skeptically.</p><p>Without another word, Peter shot one of his webs through the crack in the girl\u2019s door.</p><p>A long pause, then: \u201cYes, I\u2019d love to see him.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed as the nurse opened the door wider, allowing him access. He paused at the end of the girl\u2019s bed.</p><p>She was thin, not painfully so but definitely thinner than she was supposed to be. Her hair had all fallen out, but based on the pictures littering her nightstand and taped to her walls it had been (y/h/c). But the thing that struck Peter the most was - </p><p>\u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re my age,\u201d Peter breathed.</p><p>The girl chuckled. \u201cYeah, I- wait, <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, really?\u201d</p><p>The nurse had left at this point; Peter closed the door behind her and webbed it shut for extra insurance. \u201cYou <i>cannot </i>tell anyone about this,\u201d he said.</p><p>The girl scoffed loudly. \u201cProbably in this joint for the rest of my life,\u201d she said, almost bitterly. \u201cAnd I practically have nobody. Who am I going to tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 well, we\u2019ll get to that, hold on.\u201d Peter carefully removed his mask, looking at her; he ran a hand through his thick auburn curls.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re cute,\u201d she mumbled to herself; Peter laughed. \u201cDo you, uh, do you live around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I don\u2019t know you from school, though, where\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTownsend Harris. Where do you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidtown.\u201d</p><p>The girl laughed. \u201cAh, smart guy, huh? You know I missed getting in there by like three points? I got held back in fifth grade, because I missed so much school when I got sick the first time. It\u2019s a long and winding explanation but to sum it up, it\u2019s cancer. My name\u2019s (y/n), by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man. But my real name\u2019s Peter, Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s very nice to meet you, Peter Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled warmly at her. \u201cSo\u2026 what do you mean, you have practically nobody?\u201d</p><p>(y/n) sighed. \u201cWell, my dad left when I got sick the first time. Said having a sick kid was causing too much stress on him, turns out he\u2019d been cheating on my mom since I was four. Um, he pays child support but it\u2019s not much so my mom works two jobs just so she can pay for my bills. If she\u2019s not at one of her jobs, she\u2019s here. But she works such crazy hours that she\u2019s not here as much as she wants to be. I don\u2019t have any siblings, both sets of my grandparents are dead. I have cousins but they live in Maine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. They come by once in awhile, but they never stay long. I know being with someone who\u2019s dying is kind of a bummer. I\u2019m still in the group text and on Snapchat, but it\u2019s hard watching someone live the life you\u2019re supposed to be living, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>Peter just nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had this twice before,\u201d she added, \u201cand I\u2019ve beaten it both times. But this time, it\u2019s spread too far and my body really can\u2019t handle anymore chemo, so\u2026 I\u2019m just around until I\u2019m not around anymore, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThat is incredibly not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. My friends are all stressed out about their SAT\u2019s, what college they\u2019re going to pick, and here I am wondering if I\u2019m going to live until dinner.\u201d (y/n) puffed her cheeks out, exhaling slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s dramatic, I\u2019ve got at least a month or two but you know what I\u2019m trying to say. But anyway, prom is in a few weeks and they\u2019re texting me pictures of their dresses and they\u2019re all going to look great.\u201d She smiled sadly.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not going to get to go,\u201d Peter said softly.</p><p>\u201cNope. That\u2019s the thing that sucks about this the most. They get to have <i>lives</i>, Peter. They get to go on dates, have boyfriends, go to prom. I won\u2019t get to do any of that.\u201d A tear slid down her cheek; she hurriedly wiped it away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you came in here to cheer me up and now I\u2019ve bummed both of us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay! It\u2019s okay.\u201d \u00a0Peter smiled at her warmly. </p><p>But the wheels in his head were turning. And once they\u2019re in motion, he finds it very hard to get them to stop&hellip;</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWhat if I did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I-I know you can\u2019t leave, right? But maybe\u2026 maybe you could have a date? In here? With me? And-and maybe we could have our own tiny prom?\u201d</p><p>(y/n) scrunched up her face in confusion. \u201cYou just met me, you\u2019d do that just for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ll get attached,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll be gone, and then you won\u2019t know what to do?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed bitterly. \u201cYou think I\u2019ve never lost anyone close to me before?\u201d he asked, voice tinged with sadness. \u201cLet\u2019s see, I\u2019ve lost\u2026 um\u2026 both my parents. My uncle Ben - who I watched get shot, by the way. And you\u2019ve heard of Tony Stark, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That was so sad, I\u2026 oh, no.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cHe was my mentor, the closest thing I had to a dad since Uncle Ben died. And I watched him die too. So\u2026 I\u2019m sort of used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Peter. I had no idea, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cEh. You never know what\u2019s going on with a person just by looking at \u2018em, y\u2019know? So, um\u2026 what do you say, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can&rsquo;t fall in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that, I fall in love <i>very </i>easily. I almost married a key lime cheesecake last week. Our children would have looked <i>really </i>weird.\u201d</p><p>(y/n) laughed slightly. \u201cYou know what? Okay. Let\u2019s do this. What have I got to lose, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d Peter winked at her; they both burst into laughter. \u201cOkay, um\u2026 I have robotics club tomorrow after school, and then I need to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobotics club? God, my fake boyfriend is such a fucking <i>nerd</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my fake girlfriend is really fucking mean.\u201d</p><p>(y/n) started laughing again.</p><p>\u201cBut anyway, I can\u2019t come by tomorrow but I can the day after? I\u2019ll bring coffee, where\u2019s your favorite coffee place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always like Rosita\u2019s on the corner of 41st Street and 43rd Avenue?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cYou got it. I\u2019ll text you when I\u2019m close to there, you can tell me what you want when I get there.\u201d</p><p>(y/n) grinned slightly. \u201cWell, Peter Parker, how you gonna do that without my phone number?\u201d</p><p>Peter cocked his head to one side in confusion, then laughed. \u201cAh, (Y/n) used flirting! And\u2026 it\u2019s super effective! You do raise a good point, um\u2026 can I see your phone?\u201d</p><p>(y/n) nodded, handing him her phone; he programmed his number into it quickly. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll just text you so you have mine, I\u2026 it\u2019s complicated, I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone built into your suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fake girlfriend is really smart too.\u201d Peter shook his head as he dissolved the webs holding her door shut. \u201cOkay, so\u2026 see you in a couple of days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it, Peter. Bye. Great Pokemon reference, by the way.\u201d She waved slightly as Peter returned the gesture, then slipped his mask back on as he walked out the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you two were talking about in there,\u201d the nurse said as Peter stepped out of the room, \u201cbut that\u2019s the most I\u2019ve heard her laugh since she\u2019s been in here. I think that\u2019s just what she needs right now. You will come by and see her again, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He thought about that old adage - <i>To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.</i></p><p>He\u2019d only known (y/n) for about a half hour, but he already knew her world had been filled with hospitals and sadness. He hoped that he could make what was left of her world a little bit brighter.</p>",

He paused at the end of the girl\u2019s bed.</p><p>She was thin, not painfully so but definitely thinner than she was supposed to be. Her hair had all fallen out, but based on the pictures littering her nightstand and taped to her walls it had been (y/h/c). But the thing that struck Peter the most was - </p><p>\u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re my age,\u201d Peter breathed.</p><p>The girl chuckled. \u201cYeah, I- wait, <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, really?\u201d</p><p>The nurse had left at this point; Peter closed the door behind her and webbed it shut for extra insurance. \u201cYou <i>cannot </i>tell anyone about this,\u201d he said.</p><p>The girl scoffed loudly. \u201cProbably in this joint for the rest of my life,\u201d she said, almost bitterly. \u201cAnd I practically have nobody. Who am I going to tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 well, we\u2019ll get to that, hold on.\u201d Peter carefully removed his mask, looking at her; he ran a hand through his thick auburn curls.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re cute,\u201d she mumbled to herself; Peter laughed. \u201cDo you, uh, do you live around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I don\u2019t know you from school, though, where\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTownsend Harris. Where do you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidtown.\u201d</p><p>The girl laughed. \u201cAh, smart guy, huh? You know I missed getting in there by like three points? I got held back in fifth grade, because I missed so much school when I got sick the first time. It\u2019s a long and winding explanation but to sum it up, it\u2019s cancer. My name\u2019s (y/n), by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man. But my real name\u2019s Peter, Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s very nice to meet you, Peter Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled warmly at her. \u201cSo\u2026 what do you mean, you have practically nobody?\u201d</p><p>(y/n) sighed. \u201cWell, my dad left when I got sick the first time. Said having a sick kid was causing too much stress on him, turns out he\u2019d been cheating on my mom since I was four. Um, he pays child support but it\u2019s not much so my mom works two jobs just so she can pay for my bills. If she\u2019s not at one of her jobs, she\u2019s here. But she works such crazy hours that she\u2019s not here as much as she wants to be. I don\u2019t have any siblings, both sets of my grandparents are dead. I have cousins but they live in Maine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. They come by once in awhile, but they never stay long. I know being with someone who\u2019s dying is kind of a bummer. I\u2019m still in the group text and on Snapchat, but it\u2019s hard watching someone live the life you\u2019re supposed to be living, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>Peter just nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had this twice before,\u201d she added, \u201cand I\u2019ve beaten it both times. But this time, it\u2019s spread too far and my body really can\u2019t handle anymore chemo, so\u2026 I\u2019m just around until I\u2019m not around anymore, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThat is incredibly not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. My friends are all stressed out about their SAT\u2019s, what college they\u2019re going to pick, and here I am wondering if I\u2019m going to live until dinner.\u201d (y/n) puffed her cheeks out, exhaling slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s dramatic, I\u2019ve got at least a month or two but you know what I\u2019m trying to say. But anyway, prom is in a few weeks and they\u2019re texting me pictures of their dresses and they\u2019re all going to look great.\u201d She smiled sadly.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not going to get to go,\u201d Peter said softly.</p><p>\u201cNope. That\u2019s the thing that sucks about this the most. They get to have <i>lives</i>, Peter. They get to go on dates, have boyfriends, go to prom. I won\u2019t get to do any of that.\u201d A tear slid down her cheek; she hurriedly wiped it away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you came in here to cheer me up and now I\u2019ve bummed both of us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay! It\u2019s okay.\u201d \u00a0Peter smiled at her warmly. </p><p>But the wheels in his head were turning. And once they\u2019re in motion, he finds it very hard to get them to stop\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWhat if I did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I-I know you can\u2019t leave, right? But maybe\u2026 maybe you could have a date? In here? With me? And-and maybe we could have our own tiny prom?\u201d</p><p>(y/n) scrunched up her face in confusion. \u201cYou just met me, you\u2019d do that just for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ll get attached,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll be gone, and then you won\u2019t know what to do?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed bitterly. \u201cYou think I\u2019ve never lost anyone close to me before?\u201d he asked, voice tinged with sadness. \u201cLet\u2019s see, I\u2019ve lost\u2026 um\u2026 both my parents. My uncle Ben - who I watched get shot, by the way. And you\u2019ve heard of Tony Stark, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That was so sad, I\u2026 oh, no.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cHe was my mentor, the closest thing I had to a dad since Uncle Ben died. And I watched him die too. So\u2026 I\u2019m sort of used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Peter. I had no idea, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cEh. You never know what\u2019s going on with a person just by looking at \u2018em, y\u2019know? So, um\u2026 what do you say, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fall in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that, I fall in love <i>very </i>easily. I almost married a key lime cheesecake last week. Our children would have looked <i>really </i>weird.\u201d</p><p>(y/n) laughed slightly. \u201cYou know what? Okay. Let\u2019s do this. What have I got to lose, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d Peter winked at her; they both burst into laughter. \u201cOkay, um\u2026 I have robotics club tomorrow after school, and then I need to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobotics club? God, my fake boyfriend is such a fucking <i>nerd</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my fake girlfriend is really fucking mean.\u201d</p><p>(y/n) started laughing again.</p><p>\u201cBut anyway, I can\u2019t come by tomorrow but I can the day after? I\u2019ll bring coffee, where\u2019s your favorite coffee place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always like Rosita\u2019s on the corner of 41st Street and 43rd Avenue?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cYou got it. I\u2019ll text you when I\u2019m close to there, you can tell me what you want when I get there.\u201d</p><p>(y/n) grinned slightly. \u201cWell, Peter Parker, how you gonna do that without my phone number?\u201d</p><p>Peter cocked his head to one side in confusion, then laughed. \u201cAh, (Y/n) used flirting! And\u2026 it\u2019s super effective! You do raise a good point, um\u2026 can I see your phone?\u201d</p><p>(y/n) nodded, handing him her phone; he programmed his number into it quickly. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll just text you so you have mine, I\u2026 it\u2019s complicated, I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone built into your suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fake girlfriend is really smart too.\u201d Peter shook his head as he dissolved the webs holding her door shut. \u201cOkay, so\u2026 see you in a couple of days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it, Peter. Bye. Great Pokemon reference, by the way.\u201d She waved slightly as Peter returned the gesture, then slipped his mask back on as he walked out the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you two were talking about in there,\u201d the nurse said as Peter stepped out of the room, \u201cbut that\u2019s the most I\u2019ve heard her laugh since she\u2019s been in here. I think that\u2019s just what she needs right now. You will come by and see her again, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He thought about that old adage - <i>To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.</i></p><p>He\u2019d only known (y/n) for about a half hour, but he already knew her world had been filled with hospitals and sadness. He hoped that he could make what was left of her world a little bit brighter.</p></p>",

Mr. Spider-Man!\u201d</p><p>A boy, about five years of age, ran full-tilt down the hall at St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital; he only stopped when he ran smack-dab into a pair of blue and red legs.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Peter Parker, known to many as Spider-Man, looked down at the small boy hugging his calf. </p><p>Peter had recently decided to give back to the community he helped keep safe. His aunt May had suggested going to a children\u2019s hospital in uniform, to help brighten the patients\u2019 spirits. St. Mary\u2019s was the closest, so he tried that one; he soon fell in love with the small patients there. </p><p>\u201cHey, DeMarcus! How\u2019s it goin\u2019, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what, Mr. Spider-Man!\u201d DeMarcus\u2019s little brown eyes gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lighting. \u201cThe doctors say I\u2019m all better! I have something called re\u2026re\u2026 \u00a0ugh, Mommy, what was that <i>word</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemission,\u201d DeMarcus\u2019s mom said, smiling widely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that. But I get to go home, Mr. Spider-Man! Isn\u2019t that awesome??\u201d</p><p>Peter held out his gloved hand for a high-five, crouching down so he and DeMarcus were eye level. \u201cThat is so awesome, dude! I think that calls for a high-five.\u201d</p><p>DeMarcus giggled as he returned the high-five. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, Mr. Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you too, buddy. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy! Can you take a picture of me with Spider-Man?\u201d</p><p>DeMarcus\u2019s mom pulled out her phone, snapping a few pictures of the two of them together. \u201cThank you for doing this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really made him happy, that a real superhero took time out of his day just to come see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine, Ma\u2019am, really. DeMarcus is a good kid, I really am going to miss seeing him. Hey, buddy, can I get a hug?\u201d Peter asked, crouching down again.</p><p>Wordlessly, DeMarcus flung his arms around Peter. \u201cI love you, Mr. Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled. \u201cLove you too, buddy. I\u2019ll see you, okay? In the meantime, be good for me. Study hard in school and stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>DeMarcus nodded, firmly grasping his mother\u2019s hand. \u201cMommy! I can\u2019t wait to go back to school and tell everyone I\u2019m friends with Spider-Man!\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled as he walked down the hall.</p><p>\u201cIs that everyone?\u201d he\u2019d asked a nurse.</p><p>The nurse checked her chart. \u201cI know you don\u2019t normally go there, but you could visit the teen wing, maybe? It\u2019s not usually very full, which is why we don\u2019t usually have you go there. But\u2026 we have had one patient in there for a while now. Would you like me to see if she\u2019s up for a visitor?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cSure.\u201d As the nurse walked down the hall, Peter sat down in a chair. \u201cKaren, any messages for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cText message from Science Bro Shuri. Displayed or read aloud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisplayed is fine, thanks, Karen.\u201d</p><p><i>Hey Spider-Doofus. When you get done there, come by the lab. Got a little something for ya</i></p><p>Peter chuckled. Probably a suit upgrade, again. Ever since she came to America to work for Stark Industries, carrying on Tony\u2019s work, she had been upgrading his suit at every opportunity.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d the nurse said. Peter followed her down a hallway, into a room on the corner; the nurse peeked her head in. \u201c(y/n)? You ready for your visitor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Forgot to ask who it is, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle. \u201cIs it <i>really </i>Spider-Man, or is it just my uncle Leo in a rented costume again? Because <i>that </i>was kind of a bummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the real deal, (y/n). Can he come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake him prove it,\u201d the girl called out skeptically.</p><p>Without another word, Peter shot one of his webs through the crack in the girl\u2019s door.</p><p>A long pause, then: \u201cYes, I\u2019d love to see him.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed as the nurse opened the door wider, allowing him access. He paused at the end of the girl\u2019s bed.</p><p>She was thin, not painfully so but definitely thinner than she was supposed to be. Her hair had all fallen out, but based on the pictures littering her nightstand and taped to her walls it had been (y/h/c). But the thing that struck Peter the most was - </p><p>\u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re my age,\u201d Peter breathed.</p><p>The girl chuckled. \u201cYeah, I- wait, <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, really?\u201d</p><p>The nurse had left at this point; Peter closed the door behind her and webbed it shut for extra insurance. \u201cYou <i>cannot </i>tell anyone about this,\u201d he said.</p><p>The girl scoffed loudly. \u201cProbably in this joint for the rest of my life,\u201d she said, almost bitterly. \u201cAnd I practically have nobody. Who am I going to tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 well, we\u2019ll get to that, hold on.\u201d Peter carefully removed his mask, looking at her; he ran a hand through his thick auburn curls.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re cute,\u201d she mumbled to herself; Peter laughed. \u201cDo you, uh, do you live around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I don\u2019t know you from school, though, where\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTownsend Harris. Where do you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidtown.\u201d</p><p>The girl laughed. \u201cAh, smart guy, huh? You know I missed getting in there by like three points? I got held back in fifth grade, because I missed so much school when I got sick the first time. It\u2019s a long and winding explanation but to sum it up, it\u2019s cancer. My name\u2019s (y/n), by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man. But my real name\u2019s Peter, Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s very nice to meet you, Peter Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled warmly at her. \u201cSo\u2026 what do you mean, you have practically nobody?\u201d</p><p>(y/n) sighed. \u201cWell, my dad left when I got sick the first time. Said having a sick kid was causing too much stress on him, turns out he\u2019d been cheating on my mom since I was four. Um, he pays child support but it\u2019s not much so my mom works two jobs just so she can pay for my bills. If she\u2019s not at one of her jobs, she\u2019s here. But she works such crazy hours that she\u2019s not here as much as she wants to be. I don\u2019t have any siblings, both sets of my grandparents are dead. I have cousins but they live in Maine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. They come by once in awhile, but they never stay long. I know being with someone who\u2019s dying is kind of a bummer. I\u2019m still in the group text and on Snapchat, but it\u2019s hard watching someone live the life you\u2019re supposed to be living, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>Peter just nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had this twice before,\u201d she added, \u201cand I\u2019ve beaten it both times. But this time, it\u2019s spread too far and my body really can\u2019t handle anymore chemo, so\u2026 I\u2019m just around until I\u2019m not around anymore, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThat is incredibly not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. My friends are all stressed out about their SAT\u2019s, what college they\u2019re going to pick, and here I am wondering if I\u2019m going to live until dinner.\u201d (y/n) puffed her cheeks out, exhaling slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s dramatic, I\u2019ve got at least a month or two but you know what I\u2019m trying to say. But anyway, prom is in a few weeks and they\u2019re texting me pictures of their dresses and they\u2019re all going to look great.\u201d She smiled sadly.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not going to get to go,\u201d Peter said softly.</p><p>\u201cNope. That\u2019s the thing that sucks about this the most. They get to have <i>lives</i>, Peter. They get to go on dates, have boyfriends, go to prom. I won\u2019t get to do any of that.\u201d A tear slid down her cheek; she hurriedly wiped it away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you came in here to cheer me up and now I\u2019ve bummed both of us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay! It\u2019s okay.\u201d \u00a0Peter smiled at her warmly. </p><p>But the wheels in his head were turning. And once they\u2019re in motion, he finds it very hard to get them to stop\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWhat if I did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I-I know you can\u2019t leave, right? But maybe\u2026 maybe you could have a date? In here? With me? And-and maybe we could have our own tiny prom?\u201d</p><p>(y/n) scrunched up her face in confusion. \u201cYou just met me, you\u2019d do that just for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ll get attached,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll be gone, and then you won\u2019t know what to do?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed bitterly. \u201cYou think I\u2019ve never lost anyone close to me before?\u201d he asked, voice tinged with sadness. \u201cLet\u2019s see, I\u2019ve lost\u2026 um\u2026 both my parents. My uncle Ben - who I watched get shot, by the way. And you\u2019ve heard of Tony Stark, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That was so sad, I\u2026 oh, no.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cHe was my mentor, the closest thing I had to a dad since Uncle Ben died. And I watched him die too. So\u2026 I\u2019m sort of used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Peter. I had no idea, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cEh. You never know what\u2019s going on with a person just by looking at \u2018em, y\u2019know? So, um\u2026 what do you say, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fall in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that, I fall in love <i>very </i>easily. I almost married a key lime cheesecake last week. Our children would have looked <i>really </i>weird.\u201d</p><p>(y/n) laughed slightly. \u201cYou know what? Okay. Let\u2019s do this. What have I got to lose, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d Peter winked at her; they both burst into laughter. \u201cOkay, um\u2026 I have robotics club tomorrow after school, and then I need to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobotics club? God, my fake boyfriend is such a fucking <i>nerd</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my fake girlfriend is really fucking mean.\u201d</p><p>(y/n) started laughing again.</p><p>\u201cBut anyway, I can\u2019t come by tomorrow but I can the day after? I\u2019ll bring coffee, where\u2019s your favorite coffee place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always like Rosita\u2019s on the corner of 41st Street and 43rd Avenue?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cYou got it. I\u2019ll text you when I\u2019m close to there, you can tell me what you want when I get there.\u201d</p><p>(y/n) grinned slightly. \u201cWell, Peter Parker, how you gonna do that without my phone number?\u201d</p><p>Peter cocked his head to one side in confusion, then laughed. \u201cAh, (Y/n) used flirting! And\u2026 it\u2019s super effective! You do raise a good point, um\u2026 can I see your phone?\u201d</p><p>(y/n) nodded, handing him her phone; he programmed his number into it quickly. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll just text you so you have mine, I\u2026 it\u2019s complicated, I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone built into your suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fake girlfriend is really smart too.\u201d Peter shook his head as he dissolved the webs holding her door shut. \u201cOkay, so\u2026 see you in a couple of days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it, Peter. Bye. Great Pokemon reference, by the way.\u201d She waved slightly as Peter returned the gesture, then slipped his mask back on as he walked out the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you two were talking about in there,\u201d the nurse said as Peter stepped out of the room, \u201cbut that\u2019s the most I\u2019ve heard her laugh since she\u2019s been in here. I think that\u2019s just what she needs right now. You will come by and see her again, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He thought about that old adage - <i>To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.</i></p><p>He\u2019d only known (y/n) for about a half hour, but he already knew her world had been filled with hospitals and sadness. He hoped that he could make what was left of her world a little bit brighter.</p></p>",

Mr. Spider-Man!&rdquo;</p><p>A boy, about five years of age, ran full-tilt down the hall at St. Mary&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital; he only stopped when he ran smack-dab into a pair of blue and red legs.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Peter Parker, known to many as Spider-Man, looked down at the small boy hugging his calf. </p><p>Peter had recently decided to give back to the community he helped keep safe. His aunt May had suggested going to a children&rsquo;s hospital in uniform, to help brighten the patients&rsquo; spirits. St. Mary&rsquo;s was the closest, so he tried that one; he soon fell in love with the small patients there. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, DeMarcus! How&rsquo;s it goin&rsquo;, buddy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Guess what, Mr. Spider-Man!&rdquo; DeMarcus&rsquo;s little brown eyes gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lighting. &ldquo;The doctors say I&rsquo;m all better! I have something called re&hellip;re&hellip; &nbsp;ugh, Mommy, what was that <i>word</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remission,&rdquo; DeMarcus&rsquo;s mom said, smiling widely.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that. But I get to go home, Mr. Spider-Man! Isn&rsquo;t that awesome??&rdquo;</p><p>Peter held out his gloved hand for a high-five, crouching down so he and DeMarcus were eye level. &ldquo;That is so awesome, dude! I think that calls for a high-five.&rdquo;</p><p>DeMarcus giggled as he returned the high-five. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to miss you, Mr. Spider-Man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss you too, buddy. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll see you around, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mommy! Can you take a picture of me with Spider-Man?&rdquo;</p><p>DeMarcus&rsquo;s mom pulled out her phone, snapping a few pictures of the two of them together. &ldquo;Thank you for doing this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It really made him happy, that a real superhero took time out of his day just to come see him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The pleasure&rsquo;s all mine, Ma&rsquo;am, really. DeMarcus is a good kid, I really am going to miss seeing him. Hey, buddy, can I get a hug?&rdquo; Peter asked, crouching down again.</p><p>Wordlessly, DeMarcus flung his arms around Peter. &ldquo;I love you, Mr. Spider-Man.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chuckled. &ldquo;Love you too, buddy. I&rsquo;ll see you, okay? In the meantime, be good for me. Study hard in school and stay out of trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>DeMarcus nodded, firmly grasping his mother&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Mommy! I can&rsquo;t wait to go back to school and tell everyone I&rsquo;m friends with Spider-Man!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chuckled as he walked down the hall.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that everyone?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d asked a nurse.</p><p>The nurse checked her chart. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t normally go there, but you could visit the teen wing, maybe? It&rsquo;s not usually very full, which is why we don&rsquo;t usually have you go there. But&hellip; we have had one patient in there for a while now. Would you like me to see if she&rsquo;s up for a visitor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; As the nurse walked down the hall, Peter sat down in a chair. &ldquo;Karen, any messages for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Text message from Science Bro Shuri. Displayed or read aloud?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Displayed is fine, thanks, Karen.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Hey Spider-Doofus. When you get done there, come by the lab. Got a little something for ya</i></p><p>Peter chuckled. Probably a suit upgrade, again. Ever since she came to America to work for Stark Industries, carrying on Tony&rsquo;s work, she had been upgrading his suit at every opportunity.</p><p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; the nurse said. Peter followed her down a hallway, into a room on the corner; the nurse peeked her head in. &ldquo;(y/n)? You ready for your visitor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Forgot to ask who it is, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Spider-Man.&rdquo;</p><p>A chuckle. &ldquo;Is it <i>really </i>Spider-Man, or is it just my uncle Leo in a rented costume again? Because <i>that </i>was kind of a bummer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the real deal, (y/n). Can he come in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Make him prove it,&rdquo; the girl called out skeptically.</p><p>Without another word, Peter shot one of his webs through the crack in the girl&rsquo;s door.</p><p>A long pause, then: &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d love to see him.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter laughed as the nurse opened the door wider, allowing him access. He paused at the end of the girl&rsquo;s bed.</p><p>She was thin, not painfully so but definitely thinner than she was supposed to be. Her hair had all fallen out, but based on the pictures littering her nightstand and taped to her walls it had been (y/h/c). But the thing that struck Peter the most was - </p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit, you&rsquo;re my age,&rdquo; Peter breathed.</p><p>The girl chuckled. &ldquo;Yeah, I- wait, <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How old are you, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seventeen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No way, really?&rdquo;</p><p>The nurse had left at this point; Peter closed the door behind her and webbed it shut for extra insurance. &ldquo;You <i>cannot </i>tell anyone about this,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>The girl scoffed loudly. &ldquo;Probably in this joint for the rest of my life,&rdquo; she said, almost bitterly. &ldquo;And I practically have nobody. Who am I going to tell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip; well, we&rsquo;ll get to that, hold on.&rdquo; Peter carefully removed his mask, looking at her; he ran a hand through his thick auburn curls.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re cute,&rdquo; she mumbled to herself; Peter laughed. &ldquo;Do you, uh, do you live around here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sort of. I don&rsquo;t know you from school, though, where&rsquo;d you go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Townsend Harris. Where do you go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Midtown.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl laughed. &ldquo;Ah, smart guy, huh? You know I missed getting in there by like three points? I got held back in fifth grade, because I missed so much school when I got sick the first time. It&rsquo;s a long and winding explanation but to sum it up, it&rsquo;s cancer. My name&rsquo;s (y/n), by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Spider-Man. But my real name&rsquo;s Peter, Peter Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s very nice to meet you, Peter Peter Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled warmly at her. &ldquo;So&hellip; what do you mean, you have practically nobody?&rdquo;</p><p>(y/n) sighed. &ldquo;Well, my dad left when I got sick the first time. Said having a sick kid was causing too much stress on him, turns out he&rsquo;d been cheating on my mom since I was four. Um, he pays child support but it&rsquo;s not much so my mom works two jobs just so she can pay for my bills. If she&rsquo;s not at one of her jobs, she&rsquo;s here. But she works such crazy hours that she&rsquo;s not here as much as she wants to be. I don&rsquo;t have any siblings, both sets of my grandparents are dead. I have cousins but they live in Maine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Any friends?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sure. They come by once in awhile, but they never stay long. I know being with someone who&rsquo;s dying is kind of a bummer. I&rsquo;m still in the group text and on Snapchat, but it&rsquo;s hard watching someone live the life you&rsquo;re supposed to be living, y&rsquo;know?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter just nodded solemnly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had this twice before,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve beaten it both times. But this time, it&rsquo;s spread too far and my body really can&rsquo;t handle anymore chemo, so&hellip; I&rsquo;m just around until I&rsquo;m not around anymore, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;That is incredibly not fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me about it. My friends are all stressed out about their SAT&rsquo;s, what college they&rsquo;re going to pick, and here I am wondering if I&rsquo;m going to live until dinner.&rdquo; (y/n) puffed her cheeks out, exhaling slowly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s dramatic, I&rsquo;ve got at least a month or two but you know what I&rsquo;m trying to say. But anyway, prom is in a few weeks and they&rsquo;re texting me pictures of their dresses and they&rsquo;re all going to look great.&rdquo; She smiled sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not going to get to go,&rdquo; Peter said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. That&rsquo;s the thing that sucks about this the most. They get to have <i>lives</i>, Peter. They get to go on dates, have boyfriends, go to prom. I won&rsquo;t get to do any of that.&rdquo; A tear slid down her cheek; she hurriedly wiped it away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, you came in here to cheer me up and now I&rsquo;ve bummed both of us out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s okay! It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; &nbsp;Peter smiled at her warmly. </p><p>But the wheels in his head were turning. And once they&rsquo;re in motion, he finds it very hard to get them to stop&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;What if I did that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if you did what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I-I know you can&rsquo;t leave, right? But maybe&hellip; maybe you could have a date? In here? With me? And-and maybe we could have our own tiny prom?&rdquo;</p><p>(y/n) scrunched up her face in confusion. &ldquo;You just met me, you&rsquo;d do that just for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ll get attached,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;And then I&rsquo;ll be gone, and then you won&rsquo;t know what to do?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter laughed bitterly. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;ve never lost anyone close to me before?&rdquo; he asked, voice tinged with sadness. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, I&rsquo;ve lost&hellip; um&hellip; both my parents.

So&hellip; I&rsquo;m sort of used to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God, Peter. I had no idea, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter shrugged. &ldquo;Eh. You never know what&rsquo;s going on with a person just by looking at &lsquo;em, y&rsquo;know? So, um&hellip; what do you say, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fall in love with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise that, I fall in love <i>very </i>easily. I almost married a key lime cheesecake last week. Our children would have looked <i>really </i>weird.&rdquo;</p><p>(y/n) laughed slightly. &ldquo;You know what? Okay. Let&rsquo;s do this.

God, my fake boyfriend is such a fucking <i>nerd</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And my fake girlfriend is really fucking mean.&rdquo;</p><p>(y/n) started laughing again.</p><p>&ldquo;But anyway, I can&rsquo;t come by tomorrow but I can the day after?

Hey, buddy, can I get a hug?&rdquo; Peter asked, crouching down again.</p>\n<p>Wordlessly, DeMarcus flung his arms around Peter. &ldquo;I love you, Mr. Spider-Man.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter chuckled. &ldquo;Love you too, buddy. I&rsquo;ll see you, okay? In the meantime, be good for me. Study hard in school and stay out of trouble.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>DeMarcus nodded, firmly grasping his mother&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Mommy! I can&rsquo;t wait to go back to school and tell everyone I&rsquo;m friends with Spider-Man!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter chuckled as he walked down the hall.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is that everyone?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d asked a nurse.</p>\n<p>The nurse checked her chart. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t normally go there, but you could visit the teen wing, maybe? It&rsquo;s not usually very full, which is why we don&rsquo;t usually have you go there. But&hellip; we have had one patient in there for a while now. Would you like me to see if she&rsquo;s up for a visitor?&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

        "answer": "<h1>A Helping Hand</h1><p>Stephen mutters quietly to himself as he reads through a book and he snaps it shut when he hears a crash from upstairs. Peter had gone with him to the Sanctum today while the sorcerer went through its books, promising not to touch anything, but that promise was broken a couple of hours upon arriving. Peter managed to keep himself busy with homework but must have recently finished if the noise was anything to go by.</p><p>&ldquo;The Sorcerer Supreme mutters to himself?&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen turns in surprise and narrows his eyes at the man standing in the middle of the foyer. &ldquo;How did you get in here? I would ask if you are a sorcerer as that is the only explanation, but I don&rsquo;t recognize you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not all study in Kamar-Taj.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen glances at the man&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Yet you have a sling ring.\u00a0<i>Those</i>\u00a0are strictly found at the compound, which tells me you either stole from the master teaching you or you killed them&hellip;either way it makes you a rogue.&rdquo; The sorcerer supreme sighs. &ldquo;Here I thought I found all of you. My mistake.&rdquo;</p><p>He flicks both of his wrists up and their surroundings crack, giving away the mirror dimension. Stephen would never forgive himself if Peter was dragged into a fight with a rogue sorcerer, and he really didn&rsquo;t want to clean up a guaranteed mess. He needed to swipe the rogue&rsquo;s sling ring first and then he could worry about extracting the man&rsquo;s magic.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Stephen Strange&hellip;Sorcerer Supreme&hellip;my name is&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen could have sworn he heard a snicker but his foe didn&rsquo;t look around, so he brushed it off as a trick of his mind. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time. There had been a few times he said something that got a ghostly laugh, but he never found anyone when he looked around. He even called out but got no answer.</p><p>An offended look crosses the man&rsquo;s features but he continues. &ldquo;My name is&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I seriously don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Stephen interrupts again. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t matter in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>He conjures and throws his whip out against the rogue and misses by a hair when the man dodges to the side. When he pulls out his sling ring, Levi leaves Stephen&rsquo;s shoulders and squeezes itself around the rogue&rsquo;s wrist tightly enough to cause him to drop his sling ring and Stephen rushes forward and snags it off the ground. The rogue manages to throw the cloak off his hand and kicks the sorcerer supreme in the chest before he can move away, and Stephen grunts as he flies backward and hits the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;This is what I get for pulling my punches.&rdquo;</p><p>He staggers to his feet and ducks the rogue&rsquo;s flying fist, and then reaches up to grab the man&rsquo;s arm and turn to throw him over his shoulder. The rogue grunts when his back hits the floor and Stephen suddenly finds himself on his own back when the mystery man flips their positions and shoves one of his arms against the doctor&rsquo;s throat. With his free hand, the rogue conjures a knife and raises his arm and Stephen attempts to shove the man off when he brings it down.</p><p>A loud thwap causes both men to freeze, but the sorcerer supreme recovers at the sight of webbing holding back the rogue&rsquo;s arm. Stephen smirks and grabs the web, wrapping it around the man once he successfully shoves him off, and Peter jumps down next to the doctor as he reaches out and extracts the rogue&rsquo;s personal magic.</p><p>&ldquo;How dare you! You have no right to take what is rightfully mine!&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen rolls his eyes as he dismisses the mirror dimension. &ldquo;Cub.&rdquo; Peter webs the rogue&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;I am the Sorcerer Supreme. It is my job to take magic from those who use it against innocents and with ill will.&rdquo; He then looks over at Peter. &ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugs. &ldquo;Long enough to know you didn&rsquo;t care about this guy&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen chuckles as he draws a portal and sends the man through it to Kamar-Taj, leaving him for the other masters to deal with. Peter deactivates his suit and the sorcerer quickly notices the oversized sweater the teen is wearing as his own, and has to keep himself from smiling like an idiot. Peter looked to be swimming in Stephen&rsquo;s sweater, but he somehow made it look adorable.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to tell me why you&rsquo;re wearing my sweater?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I found it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No way! It&rsquo;s mine now!&rdquo; Peter climbs the wall when Stephen reaches out and he grins. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my security blanket!&rdquo;</p><p>The sorcerer raises an inquisitive eyebrow. &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Smells like you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what will you do when the smell wears off?&rdquo; Stephen asks as he massages his temples.</p><p>&ldquo;Switch it with another one.&rdquo; The teen&rsquo;s says as if it were obvious, and really&hellip;it kind of was.</p><p>&ldquo;Steal your father&rsquo;s clothes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. I have one of his shirts!&rdquo;</p><p><i>Whatever</i>. He didn&rsquo;t really care. If borrowing his clothes comforted the teen, he would happily throw what little bit he had in his closet at him. Although he wouldn&rsquo;t actually admit that out loud because then more than one sweater or shirt would go missing at a time.</p><p>Stephen walks up the stairs toward the Sanctum library as Peter follows across the ceiling, and he sighs when he finds Wong sitting at the table with his earphones in. He calls out his name a couple of times before finally waving his hand, using his magic to pull the earbuds out. Wong looks up from his book at the sudden interruption and Stephen folds his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I could have used your help a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor rolls his eyes. &ldquo;With the rogue sorcerer that walked through the front door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You look fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So Tony says.&rdquo; Wong rolls his eyes. &ldquo;I was almost stabbed. I&rsquo;m only okay because of Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>The librarian raises an eyebrow. &ldquo;Is there a problem I&rsquo;m not seeing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only that I unknowingly dragged my son into the mirror dimension.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Totally cool by the way.&rdquo; Peter pipes up from his crouch on the ceiling, making Wong jump.</p><p>&ldquo;Stephen, we all know you wouldn&rsquo;t let anything happen to him. He&rsquo;s obviously fine and so are you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wong, hitting on me is one thing but Peter&ndash;&rdquo; Stephen laughs when the other sorcerer throws a book at him in retaliation, and he side steps the second book as he answers his cell phone when it rings. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Wifey&hellip;you in New York by any chance?&rdquo; Tony asks and Stephen hears a faint explosion in the background.</p><p>&ldquo;At the Sanctum. That better have not been the lab.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\u00a0<i>wish</i>\u00a0it was the lab. No Mama Bear, just another typical alien invasion. I&rsquo;m assuming the baby is with you and we could use a couple of extra hands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. Do I have to? I just dealt with a rogue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some of them are using magic. Wanda and Loki can only do so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Hanging up, Stephen sighs and opens a portal, which Peter jumps through with a whoop (no doubt overhearing the phone call with his enhanced hearing), and the sorcerer ducks the third book Wong throws at him before following Peter. The teen was already swinging around and webbing up some aliens that the others were fighting, giving them the moments rest they needed before having to dodge and deflect the attack of another alien, leaving Stephen to find the creatures using magic.</p><p>To be fair, it was pretty chaotic. Bruce actually had to let the Hulk out and Stephen had to clone himself to deal with the multitudes of magic-using aliens so he could take the risky moments to make sure the rest of the team was okay. He already had to conjure a temporary shield between Steve and an alien that was trying to blitz him from behind when the captain was occupied with two others.</p><p>The fight was going rather well otherwise. Thor found their ships just outside the atmosphere and was taking care of those while they took care of the creatures left over on the ground, and everyone would be able to walk away without a scratch. That was until one of the remaining bigger aliens threw a car at Bucky and he managed to dodge it. It continued to fly across the street and the winter soldier looks ahead of it to find it flying right toward Stephen. His actual physical form, not one of his clones.</p><p>&ldquo;STRANGE! Look out!&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen looks away from the alien he just killed and once he catches a glimpse of the car, he attempts to conjure a shield while his armor starts to cover his body. It was too late though. The car crashes into him, sending both the human and automobile over the nearby railing and into the ocean, and Bucky quickly subdues the still approaching alien with his metal arm as he presses the comm piece in his ear with his free hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone better be a good swimmer because Strange just got thrown into the ocean! By a car that was meant for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Steve asks worriedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Directly behind me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see you. I&rsquo;m getting him.&rdquo;</p><p>Another splash confirms the captain&rsquo;s dive into the water just as the alien in Bucky&rsquo;s metal grip throws off the soldier. He lands on his back as Peter swings over him and in between them, and the eyes on the teen&rsquo;s suit turn red before the metal legs come out of his suit and one darts out to stab the alien.</p><p>Then again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>Peter went ballistic on the alien and it took both Bucky and Sam to pull him away from the now very dead alien corpse. While they calm him down, Steve surfaces with the unconscious sorcerer and Tony yells for someone to calm Bruce as he flies over to help them onto dry land. Once they get Stephen onto his back, the billionaire&rsquo;s helmet recedes and he leans down to listen for and signs of breathing. There was none, but he still had a heartbeat so he started mouth-to-mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the fuck didn&rsquo;t the cloak do anything?!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve wipes water out of his eyes. &ldquo;It tried, but it risked strangling him.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony says nothing as he continues his mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until Stephen\u00a0<i>finally</i>\u00a0chokes and turns his head to the side to cough up the water in his lungs. Steve looks over the sorcerer and nudges Tony when he finds shaking hands and the billionaire stores away the rest of his armor to grab one of the hands an gently massage it.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Thumbelina! You busy?&rdquo; Tony asks.</p><p>A grunt then, &ldquo;Not anymore. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Scott asks.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your dream come true. You get to hold my wife&rsquo;s hand&hellip;well massage it really. The water was cold enough to chill the pins in his hands so they&rsquo;re hurting right now. Cap is too cold to help so you guys switch.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve pats Tony&rsquo;s shoulder and runs off when Scott arrives, and the other man drops to his knees and takes Stephen&rsquo;s other hand, mimicking the genius&rsquo;s ministrations. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t shortstack usually help with this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Barnes and Bird-boy are a little busy trying to keep him from making another pincushion out of the alien that did this. Which is very dead now by the way.&rdquo; Tony stops his massage when Stephen&rsquo;s hands finally stop shaking and he reaches up to brush wet hair away from his forehead. &ldquo;Does anything hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;S-Side.&rdquo; Stephen forces out through chattering teeth.</p><p>Tony and Scott check both sides and the ex-criminal points out a piece of metal buried in Stephen&rsquo;s side and they carefully roll him onto his uninjured side. Scott carefully wraps his hand around the metal and the doctor hisses in pain as Ant-man looks up at Tony. The billionaire nods after checking with FRIDAY to make sure it hadn&rsquo;t hit any organs, and Scott pulls out the shard leaving Tony to close the wound with a medicated web that Bruce and Peter had designed. It was only temporary, but it would hold until they got him back to the Med-bay and Bruce could see to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything else?&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;No&hellip;j-just cold.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony taps the sorcerer&rsquo;s bracelet, and the nanotech quickly covers Stephen&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;FRIDAY, have Victor turn on his suit&rsquo;s heaters. Low heat.&rdquo;</p><p>The heater kicks on as the Avengers join them, the last of the aliens killed, and with some help they get Stephen onto the Quinjet and to the Med-bay. Bruce properly cleans and dresses the man&rsquo;s side injury and puts him on an IV as a precaution against any bacteria from the water he swallowed, and gently but forcefully shoves Peter into a chair when he doesn&rsquo;t stop his pacing. Tony, on the other hand, grabs an extra blanket from the closet and lays it over Stephen&rsquo;s sleeping form.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be fine. I want to keep him here overnight just in case though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Brucie Bear.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce nods and keeps himself busy at one of the holographic screens across the room, Peter plays on his phone after getting his chair as close as possible to the bed, and Tony sits in his own chair with a Starkpad and kicks his feet up onto another empty chair. A couple of hours pass in silence until Stephen finally blinks heavy eyelids open, and he groans quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve definitely had better days.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s head snaps up at his words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also had much worse.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony could tell that Peter was holding himself back from climbing onto the bed to cling onto Stephen. The sorcerer noticed too because he slowly pats the side of the bed on his uninjured side, and after getting an okay from Bruce, he carefully climbs onto the bed and tucks himself into Stephen&rsquo;s side.</p><p>&ldquo;Spider-Baby here actually used Instant Kill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to see the other guy.&rdquo; Peter mumbles into Stephen&rsquo;s collarbone.</p><p>The sorcerer huffs. &ldquo;I vaguely recall your father saying something about a pincushion.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony snorts. &ldquo;Maybe at first. Now the correct description would be Swiss cheese.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen sighs. &ldquo;That was an image I did not need.&rdquo;</p><p>A comfortable silence passes for a few moments.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah babe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anyone\u00a0<i>responsible</i>\u00a0with the team?&rdquo;</p><p>Both Tony and Peter laugh. &ldquo;Rhodey.&rdquo; The billionaire answers.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh thank god.&rdquo;</p>",

Peter had gone with him to the Sanctum today while the sorcerer went through its books, promising not to touch anything, but that promise was broken a couple of hours upon arriving. Peter managed to keep himself busy with homework but must have recently finished if the noise was anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cThe Sorcerer Supreme mutters to himself?\u201d</p><p>Stephen turns in surprise and narrows his eyes at the man standing in the middle of the foyer. \u201cHow did you get in here? I would ask if you are a sorcerer as that is the only explanation, but I don\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all study in Kamar-Taj.\u201d</p><p>Stephen glances at the man\u2019s hand. \u201cYet you have a sling ring.\u00a0<i>Those</i>\u00a0are strictly found at the compound, which tells me you either stole from the master teaching you or you killed them\u2026either way it makes you a rogue.\u201d The sorcerer supreme sighs. \u201cHere I thought I found all of you. My mistake.\u201d</p><p>He flicks both of his wrists up and their surroundings crack, giving away the mirror dimension. Stephen would never forgive himself if Peter was dragged into a fight with a rogue sorcerer, and he really didn\u2019t want to clean up a guaranteed mess. He needed to swipe the rogue\u2019s sling ring first and then he could worry about extracting the man\u2019s magic.</p><p>\u201cDr. Stephen Strange\u2026Sorcerer Supreme\u2026my name is\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Stephen could have sworn he heard a snicker but his foe didn\u2019t look around, so he brushed it off as a trick of his mind. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time. There had been a few times he said something that got a ghostly laugh, but he never found anyone when he looked around. He even called out but got no answer.</p><p>An offended look crosses the man\u2019s features but he continues. \u201cMy name is\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seriously don\u2019t care.\u201d Stephen interrupts again. \u201cIt won\u2019t matter in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He conjures and throws his whip out against the rogue and misses by a hair when the man dodges to the side. When he pulls out his sling ring, Levi leaves Stephen\u2019s shoulders and squeezes itself around the rogue\u2019s wrist tightly enough to cause him to drop his sling ring and Stephen rushes forward and snags it off the ground. The rogue manages to throw the cloak off his hand and kicks the sorcerer supreme in the chest before he can move away, and Stephen grunts as he flies backward and hits the wall.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I get for pulling my punches.\u201d</p><p>He staggers to his feet and ducks the rogue\u2019s flying fist, and then reaches up to grab the man\u2019s arm and turn to throw him over his shoulder. The rogue grunts when his back hits the floor and Stephen suddenly finds himself on his own back when the mystery man flips their positions and shoves one of his arms against the doctor\u2019s throat. With his free hand, the rogue conjures a knife and raises his arm and Stephen attempts to shove the man off when he brings it down.</p><p>A loud thwap causes both men to freeze, but the sorcerer supreme recovers at the sight of webbing holding back the rogue\u2019s arm. Stephen smirks and grabs the web, wrapping it around the man once he successfully shoves him off, and Peter jumps down next to the doctor as he reaches out and extracts the rogue\u2019s personal magic.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you! You have no right to take what is rightfully mine!\u201d</p><p>Stephen rolls his eyes as he dismisses the mirror dimension. \u201cCub.\u201d Peter webs the rogue\u2019s mouth. \u201cI am the Sorcerer Supreme. It is my job to take magic from those who use it against innocents and with ill will.\u201d He then looks over at Peter. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugs. \u201cLong enough to know you didn\u2019t care about this guy\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Stephen chuckles as he draws a portal and sends the man through it to Kamar-Taj, leaving him for the other masters to deal with. Peter deactivates his suit and the sorcerer quickly notices the oversized sweater the teen is wearing as his own, and has to keep himself from smiling like an idiot. Peter looked to be swimming in Stephen\u2019s sweater, but he somehow made it look adorable.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me why you\u2019re wearing my sweater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! It\u2019s mine now!\u201d Peter climbs the wall when Stephen reaches out and he grins. \u201cIt\u2019s my security blanket!\u201d</p><p>The sorcerer raises an inquisitive eyebrow. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmells like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do when the smell wears off?\u201d Stephen asks as he massages his temples.</p><p>\u201cSwitch it with another one.\u201d The teen\u2019s says as if it were obvious, and really\u2026it kind of was.</p><p>\u201cSteal your father\u2019s clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I have one of his shirts!\u201d</p><p><i>Whatever</i>. He didn\u2019t really care. If borrowing his clothes comforted the teen, he would happily throw what little bit he had in his closet at him. Although he wouldn\u2019t actually admit that out loud because then more than one sweater or shirt would go missing at a time.</p><p>Stephen walks up the stairs toward the Sanctum library as Peter follows across the ceiling, and he sighs when he finds Wong sitting at the table with his earphones in. He calls out his name a couple of times before finally waving his hand, using his magic to pull the earbuds out. Wong looks up from his book at the sudden interruption and Stephen folds his arms.</p><p>\u201cI could have used your help a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>The doctor rolls his eyes. \u201cWith the rogue sorcerer that walked through the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Tony says.\u201d Wong rolls his eyes. \u201cI was almost stabbed. I\u2019m only okay because of Peter.\u201d</p><p>The librarian raises an eyebrow. \u201cIs there a problem I\u2019m not seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that I unknowingly dragged my son into the mirror dimension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally cool by the way.\u201d Peter pipes up from his crouch on the ceiling, making Wong jump.</p><p>\u201cStephen, we all know you wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to him. He\u2019s obviously fine and so are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWong, hitting on me is one thing but Peter\u2013\u201d Stephen laughs when the other sorcerer throws a book at him in retaliation, and he side steps the second book as he answers his cell phone when it rings. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Wifey\u2026you in New York by any chance?\u201d Tony asks and Stephen hears a faint explosion in the background.</p><p>\u201cAt the Sanctum. That better have not been the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u00a0<i>wish</i>\u00a0it was the lab. No Mama Bear, just another typical alien invasion. I\u2019m assuming the baby is with you and we could use a couple of extra hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. Do I have to? I just dealt with a rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them are using magic. Wanda and Loki can only do so much.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, Stephen sighs and opens a portal, which Peter jumps through with a whoop (no doubt overhearing the phone call with his enhanced hearing), and the sorcerer ducks the third book Wong throws at him before following Peter. The teen was already swinging around and webbing up some aliens that the others were fighting, giving them the moments rest they needed before having to dodge and deflect the attack of another alien, leaving Stephen to find the creatures using magic.</p><p>To be fair, it was pretty chaotic. Bruce actually had to let the Hulk out and Stephen had to clone himself to deal with the multitudes of magic-using aliens so he could take the risky moments to make sure the rest of the team was okay. He already had to conjure a temporary shield between Steve and an alien that was trying to blitz him from behind when the captain was occupied with two others.</p><p>The fight was going rather well otherwise. Thor found their ships just outside the atmosphere and was taking care of those while they took care of the creatures left over on the ground, and everyone would be able to walk away without a scratch. That was until one of the remaining bigger aliens threw a car at Bucky and he managed to dodge it. It continued to fly across the street and the winter soldier looks ahead of it to find it flying right toward Stephen. His actual physical form, not one of his clones.</p><p>\u201cSTRANGE! Look out!\u201d</p><p>Stephen looks away from the alien he just killed and once he catches a glimpse of the car, he attempts to conjure a shield while his armor starts to cover his body. It was too late though. The car crashes into him, sending both the human and automobile over the nearby railing and into the ocean, and Bucky quickly subdues the still approaching alien with his metal arm as he presses the comm piece in his ear with his free hand.</p><p>\u201cSomeone better be a good swimmer because Strange just got thrown into the ocean! By a car that was meant for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Steve asks worriedly.</p><p>\u201cDirectly behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you. I\u2019m getting him.\u201d</p><p>Another splash confirms the captain\u2019s dive into the water just as the alien in Bucky\u2019s metal grip throws off the soldier. He lands on his back as Peter swings over him and in between them, and the eyes on the teen\u2019s suit turn red before the metal legs come out of his suit and one darts out to stab the alien.</p><p>Then again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>Peter went ballistic on the alien and it took both Bucky and Sam to pull him away from the now very dead alien corpse. While they calm him down, Steve surfaces with the unconscious sorcerer and Tony yells for someone to calm Bruce as he flies over to help them onto dry land. Once they get Stephen onto his back, the billionaire\u2019s helmet recedes and he leans down to listen for and signs of breathing. There was none, but he still had a heartbeat so he started mouth-to-mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t the cloak do anything?!\u201d</p><p>Steve wipes water out of his eyes. \u201cIt tried, but it risked strangling him.\u201d</p><p>Tony says nothing as he continues his mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until Stephen\u00a0<i>finally</i>\u00a0chokes and turns his head to the side to cough up the water in his lungs. Steve looks over the sorcerer and nudges Tony when he finds shaking hands and the billionaire stores away the rest of his armor to grab one of the hands an gently massage it.</p><p>\u201cHey Thumbelina! You busy?\u201d Tony asks.</p><p>A grunt then, \u201cNot anymore. What\u2019s up?\u201d Scott asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your dream come true.

It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time. There had been a few times he said something that got a ghostly laugh, but he never found anyone when he looked around. He even called out but got no answer.</p><p>An offended look crosses the man&rsquo;s features but he continues. &ldquo;My name is&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I seriously don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Stephen interrupts again. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t matter in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>He conjures and throws his whip out against the rogue and misses by a hair when the man dodges to the side. When he pulls out his sling ring, Levi leaves Stephen&rsquo;s shoulders and squeezes itself around the rogue&rsquo;s wrist tightly enough to cause him to drop his sling ring and Stephen rushes forward and snags it off the ground. The rogue manages to throw the cloak off his hand and kicks the sorcerer supreme in the chest before he can move away, and Stephen grunts as he flies backward and hits the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;This is what I get for pulling my punches.&rdquo;</p><p>He staggers to his feet and ducks the rogue&rsquo;s flying fist, and then reaches up to grab the man&rsquo;s arm and turn to throw him over his shoulder. The rogue grunts when his back hits the floor and Stephen suddenly finds himself on his own back when the mystery man flips their positions and shoves one of his arms against the doctor&rsquo;s throat. With his free hand, the rogue conjures a knife and raises his arm and Stephen attempts to shove the man off when he brings it down.</p><p>A loud thwap causes both men to freeze, but the sorcerer supreme recovers at the sight of webbing holding back the rogue&rsquo;s arm. Stephen smirks and grabs the web, wrapping it around the man once he successfully shoves him off, and Peter jumps down next to the doctor as he reaches out and extracts the rogue&rsquo;s personal magic.</p><p>&ldquo;How dare you! You have no right to take what is rightfully mine!&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen rolls his eyes as he dismisses the mirror dimension. &ldquo;Cub.&rdquo; Peter webs the rogue&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;I am the Sorcerer Supreme. It is my job to take magic from those who use it against innocents and with ill will.&rdquo; He then looks over at Peter. &ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugs. &ldquo;Long enough to know you didn&rsquo;t care about this guy&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen chuckles as he draws a portal and sends the man through it to Kamar-Taj, leaving him for the other masters to deal with. Peter deactivates his suit and the sorcerer quickly notices the oversized sweater the teen is wearing as his own, and has to keep himself from smiling like an idiot. Peter looked to be swimming in Stephen&rsquo;s sweater, but he somehow made it look adorable.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to tell me why you&rsquo;re wearing my sweater?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I found it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No way! It&rsquo;s mine now!&rdquo; Peter climbs the wall when Stephen reaches out and he grins. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my security blanket!&rdquo;</p><p>The sorcerer raises an inquisitive eyebrow. &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Smells like you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what will you do when the smell wears off?&rdquo; Stephen asks as he massages his temples.</p><p>&ldquo;Switch it with another one.&rdquo; The teen&rsquo;s says as if it were obvious, and really&hellip;it kind of was.</p><p>&ldquo;Steal your father&rsquo;s clothes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. I have one of his shirts!&rdquo;</p><p><i>Whatever</i>. He didn&rsquo;t really care. If borrowing his clothes comforted the teen, he would happily throw what little bit he had in his closet at him. Although he wouldn&rsquo;t actually admit that out loud because then more than one sweater or shirt would go missing at a time.</p><p>Stephen walks up the stairs toward the Sanctum library as Peter follows across the ceiling, and he sighs when he finds Wong sitting at the table with his earphones in. He calls out his name a couple of times before finally waving his hand, using his magic to pull the earbuds out. Wong looks up from his book at the sudden interruption and Stephen folds his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I could have used your help a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor rolls his eyes. &ldquo;With the rogue sorcerer that walked through the front door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You look fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So Tony says.&rdquo; Wong rolls his eyes. &ldquo;I was almost stabbed. I&rsquo;m only okay because of Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>The librarian raises an eyebrow. &ldquo;Is there a problem I&rsquo;m not seeing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only that I unknowingly dragged my son into the mirror dimension.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Totally cool by the way.&rdquo; Peter pipes up from his crouch on the ceiling, making Wong jump.</p><p>&ldquo;Stephen, we all know you wouldn&rsquo;t let anything happen to him. He&rsquo;s obviously fine and so are you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wong, hitting on me is one thing but Peter&ndash;&rdquo; Stephen laughs when the other sorcerer throws a book at him in retaliation, and he side steps the second book as he answers his cell phone when it rings. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Wifey&hellip;you in New York by any chance?&rdquo; Tony asks and Stephen hears a faint explosion in the background.</p><p>&ldquo;At the Sanctum. That better have not been the lab.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;<i>wish</i>&nbsp;it was the lab. No Mama Bear, just another typical alien invasion. I&rsquo;m assuming the baby is with you and we could use a couple of extra hands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. Do I have to? I just dealt with a rogue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some of them are using magic. Wanda and Loki can only do so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Hanging up, Stephen sighs and opens a portal, which Peter jumps through with a whoop (no doubt overhearing the phone call with his enhanced hearing), and the sorcerer ducks the third book Wong throws at him before following Peter. The teen was already swinging around and webbing up some aliens that the others were fighting, giving them the moments rest they needed before having to dodge and deflect the attack of another alien, leaving Stephen to find the creatures using magic.</p><p>To be fair, it was pretty chaotic. Bruce actually had to let the Hulk out and Stephen had to clone himself to deal with the multitudes of magic-using aliens so he could take the risky moments to make sure the rest of the team was okay. He already had to conjure a temporary shield between Steve and an alien that was trying to blitz him from behind when the captain was occupied with two others.</p><p>The fight was going rather well otherwise. Thor found their ships just outside the atmosphere and was taking care of those while they took care of the creatures left over on the ground, and everyone would be able to walk away without a scratch. That was until one of the remaining bigger aliens threw a car at Bucky and he managed to dodge it. It continued to fly across the street and the winter soldier looks ahead of it to find it flying right toward Stephen. His actual physical form, not one of his clones.</p><p>&ldquo;STRANGE! Look out!&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen looks away from the alien he just killed and once he catches a glimpse of the car, he attempts to conjure a shield while his armor starts to cover his body. It was too late though. The car crashes into him, sending both the human and automobile over the nearby railing and into the ocean, and Bucky quickly subdues the still approaching alien with his metal arm as he presses the comm piece in his ear with his free hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone better be a good swimmer because Strange just got thrown into the ocean! By a car that was meant for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Steve asks worriedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Directly behind me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see you. I&rsquo;m getting him.&rdquo;</p><p>Another splash confirms the captain&rsquo;s dive into the water just as the alien in Bucky&rsquo;s metal grip throws off the soldier. He lands on his back as Peter swings over him and in between them, and the eyes on the teen&rsquo;s suit turn red before the metal legs come out of his suit and one darts out to stab the alien.</p><p>Then again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>Peter went ballistic on the alien and it took both Bucky and Sam to pull him away from the now very dead alien corpse. While they calm him down, Steve surfaces with the unconscious sorcerer and Tony yells for someone to calm Bruce as he flies over to help them onto dry land. Once they get Stephen onto his back, the billionaire&rsquo;s helmet recedes and he leans down to listen for and signs of breathing. There was none, but he still had a heartbeat so he started mouth-to-mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the fuck didn&rsquo;t the cloak do anything?!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve wipes water out of his eyes. &ldquo;It tried, but it risked strangling him.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony says nothing as he continues his mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until Stephen&nbsp;<i>finally</i>&nbsp;chokes and turns his head to the side to cough up the water in his lungs. Steve looks over the sorcerer and nudges Tony when he finds shaking hands and the billionaire stores away the rest of his armor to grab one of the hands an gently massage it.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Thumbelina! You busy?&rdquo; Tony asks.</p><p>A grunt then, &ldquo;Not anymore. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Scott asks.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your dream come true. You get to hold my wife&rsquo;s hand&hellip;well massage it really. The water was cold enough to chill the pins in his hands so they&rsquo;re hurting right now. Cap is too cold to help so you guys switch.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve pats Tony&rsquo;s shoulder and runs off when Scott arrives, and the other man drops to his knees and takes Stephen&rsquo;s other hand, mimicking the genius&rsquo;s ministrations. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t shortstack usually help with this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Barnes and Bird-boy are a little busy trying to keep him from making another pincushion out of the alien that did this. Which is very dead now by the way.&rdquo; Tony stops his massage when Stephen&rsquo;s hands finally stop shaking and he reaches up to brush wet hair away from his forehead. &ldquo;Does anything hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;S-Side.&rdquo; Stephen forces out through chattering teeth.</p><p>Tony and Scott check both sides and the ex-criminal points out a piece of metal buried in Stephen&rsquo;s side and they carefully roll him onto his uninjured side. Scott carefully wraps his hand around the metal and the doctor hisses in pain as Ant-man looks up at Tony. The billionaire nods after checking with FRIDAY to make sure it hadn&rsquo;t hit any organs, and Scott pulls out the shard leaving Tony to close the wound with a medicated web that Bruce and Peter had designed. It was only temporary, but it would hold until they got him back to the Med-bay and Bruce could see to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything else?\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"No&hellip;j-just cold.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony taps the sorcerer&rsquo;s bracelet, and the nanotech quickly covers Stephen&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;FRIDAY, have Victor turn on his suit&rsquo;s heaters. Low heat.&rdquo;</p><p>The heater kicks on as the Avengers join them, the last of the aliens killed, and with some help they get Stephen onto the Quinjet and to the Med-bay. Bruce properly cleans and dresses the man&rsquo;s side injury and puts him on an IV as a precaution against any bacteria from the water he swallowed, and gently but forcefully shoves Peter into a chair when he doesn&rsquo;t stop his pacing. Tony, on the other hand, grabs an extra blanket from the closet and lays it over Stephen&rsquo;s sleeping form.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be fine. I want to keep him here overnight just in case though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Brucie Bear.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce nods and keeps himself busy at one of the holographic screens across the room, Peter plays on his phone after getting his chair as close as possible to the bed, and Tony sits in his own chair with a Starkpad and kicks his feet up onto another empty chair. A couple of hours pass in silence until Stephen finally blinks heavy eyelids open, and he groans quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve definitely had better days.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s head snaps up at his words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also had much worse.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony could tell that Peter was holding himself back from climbing onto the bed to cling onto Stephen. The sorcerer noticed too because he slowly pats the side of the bed on his uninjured side, and after getting an okay from Bruce, he carefully climbs onto the bed and tucks himself into Stephen&rsquo;s side.</p><p>&ldquo;Spider-Baby here actually used Instant Kill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to see the other guy.&rdquo; Peter mumbles into Stephen&rsquo;s collarbone.</p><p>The sorcerer huffs. &ldquo;I vaguely recall your father saying something about a pincushion.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony snorts. &ldquo;Maybe at first. Now the correct description would be Swiss cheese.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen sighs. &ldquo;That was an image I did not need.&rdquo;</p><p>A comfortable silence passes for a few moments.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah babe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anyone&nbsp;<i>responsible</i>&nbsp;with the team?&rdquo;</p><p>Both Tony and Peter laugh. &ldquo;Rhodey.&rdquo; The billionaire answers.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh thank god.&rdquo;</p></p>",
