And the moment your see him turn up at your door, feelings resurface. </p><p>A/N : I got bored. And I don\u2019t even know anymore. It\u2019s trash but oh well! Lol. *drake Walker inspired me* </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"286\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6450a016770f5edabf4f5f338b58a6ee/tumblr_potdruRMtu1vgfc6m_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"286\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>It had been a few years since you last heard from the Captain himself. And when he showed up at your door, different emotions washed over you completely. </p><p>Anger had overpowered most of the other emotions, and as much as you wanted to slam the door in his face, with everyone disappearing, you knew you had to let him in. </p><p>The second Steve met your gaze, he let out a sigh of relief. As everyone vanished, fading into the air and dropping like ashes, his thoughts immediately fell to you. </p><p>But standing in front of you, knowing that you were safe, he felt like he could finally breathe again. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to let us in or do we need to pitch a tent out here until you do?\u201d Nat asked, raising her brow. </p><p>You cleared your throat and waved them inside. Glancing away from Steve gaze. </p><p>\u201cIt sure hasn\u2019t changed since the last time I was here.\u201d She muttered, walking down the hall toward where her old room. </p><p>Bruce made his way in and the second you saw him, your eyes lit up. </p><p>\u201cBanner!\u201d You exclaimed, throwing your arms around him. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d </p><p>He flashed a soft smirk, awkwardly embracing you. \u201cYou and me both.\u201d He stated. \u201cI really need some coffee though. It\u2019s been a crazy few days.\u201d </p><p>You let out a soft chuckle and nod your head. \u201cI get it.\u201d </p><p>And just like that, you were left alone with Steve. </p><p>Immediately, your stomach began to churn. Even with all the anger you had for him, you cared for him. Though he would never know. </p><p>For years, you were always drooling over the Captain. Especially, every time he came back from missions, wearing his suit. </p><p>But the more time you spent with him, training, missions, even grocery runs, you started to slowly fall for him. </p><p>Steve was an old soul. Mostly having to do with him being born decades ago, but he was charming to say the least. It was hard not to fall head over heels for the man. </p><p>He took a seat on one of the couches, holding his gaze on you. It felt as if they were burning through your body, creating heat to radiate all around you. </p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d He asked, his voice soft with pain hidden just slightly. </p><p>You met his glossy blue eyes, fighting to keep your walls up as you crossed your arms over your chest. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d You muttered. </p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes held yours, and in that moment you could see just how tired and hurt he was. The bags under his eyes indicated that he wasn\u2019t getting  much sleep, and the lines that formed around his face. </p><p>Seeing him like that was hard. Sure, he was always brooding and hard on himself, but you have never seen him like this. </p><p>And just like that, you were back to letting him in. </p><p>\u201cFine. But we need drinks first.\u201d You said. </p><p>His eyes followed you as you strode across the room, grabbing two glasses and a bottle of whiskey. </p><p>As you made your way back over to him, you sat in front of him and poured the alcohol beverage into the glasses. </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d You sighed, before taking a swig and feeling it glide down your throat. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d </p><p>Steve reached for his cup and watched the liquid swirl around. This wasn\u2019t easy for him to say the least. </p><p>\u201cUs.\u201d He finally spoke, breaking the small silence that had occurred. Glancing up and meeting your gaze. </p><p>You swallowed hard, not knowing what he meant or where this conversation was going. This was all new to you. </p><p>\u201cI never meant to leave without saying goodbye.\u201d He muttered, still holding your gaze. \u201cI just\u2014if I came back and saw you, I don\u2019t know if I would have had the strength to leave.\u201d </p><p>Those last few words had forced a shiver to ripple down your spine, causing chills to cover you completely. You almost forgot how to breathe. </p><p>Steve pulled himself to the edge of his seat, giving you all of his attention. </p><p>\u201cI distanced myself from you because I thought it would be easier.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEasier than what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier than admitting to myself about how I felt.\u201d He said. \u201cI have lost everyone I have ever loved. And i promised myself never to let anyone in. And the more I pushed you away, the more you pulled me in.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t your intentions, you weren\u2019t expecting to sit there and let him back in, but the more his words sunk into you, slowly, your walls began to break down. </p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how happy I was to see you open the door.\u201d His voice shook. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you.\u201d </p><p>Without realizing, you were both sitting at the edge of your seats, inches away from one another. </p><p>The way his eyes glossed over, you could see how much this hurt him, almost as much as it hurt you. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lose me.\u201d You said. \u201cLike it or not, you\u2019re kind of stuck with me. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s lips twitched into a soft smile, feeling as if the weight of the world had dissipated in that moment. </p><p>You knew you shouldn\u2019t cave in. Letting him in would give him the power to break your heart all over again and that was the last thing you wanted. But his trance was hard to ignore. </p><p>And before you knew it, you felt yourself slowly leaning closer to him, but immediately caught yourself and pulled back. </p><p>\u201cAlright, I declare this a stress free zone.\u201d You said before realizing the bottle of whiskey had finished. </p><p>Steve ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time we catch up. Three years is a long time, Captain.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoes this mean more drinks?\u201d</p><p>You flashed a cheeky grin and propped up to your feet. \u201cVery much so.\u201d </p><p>You sprinted down to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of champagne. </p><p>\u201cThe wine cellar hasn\u2019t been restocked in years, so we will have to make due with what we got.\u201d </p><p>Steve nodded, trying not to smile like an idiot as he watched you from his seat. </p><p>Though he was exhausted, and had a million things running through his mind, he couldn\u2019t help but feel at ease with you. </p><p>\u201cAnd maybe we can even play a drinking game!\u201d You exclaimed. </p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey\u2014you don\u2019t even know what the game is yet!\u201d You chuckled. </p><p>\u201cLet me guess, you\u2019re about to tell me?\u201d </p><p>Your lips curved more at the edges, as you refilled the glasses with the champagne. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called never have I ever. You say something you haven\u2019t done and if the other person has done it, then\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cThey take a drink.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee! You\u2019re a natural.\u201d A soft chuckle escaped you both. \u201cSo whoever has had the least drinks after\u2014let\u2019s go five rounds\u2014wins.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about this&hellip;\u201d he drawled out, running his hand through his hair. \u201cYou sure you want to go up against me in a drinking game?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a challenge. And I accept!\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s brows raised with shock but peaked with interest and decided to give it a shot. \u201cYou\u2019re on. So start.\u201d</p><p>You hand him his glass while he looked at you expectantly. </p><p>\u201cGuess I better make this first question count then.\u201d You pondered your thoughts for just a moment before flashing a cynical smile. \u201cNever have I ever been called Captain.\u201d </p><p>Suddenly Steve shook his head, trying to hide the smirk as he took a sip of his drink. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating.\u201d </p><p>You shrugged your shoulders. \u201cYour turn.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright. Never have I ever gone dancing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, seriously? You havent?\u201d You asked, a bit intrigued. </p><p>Steve nodded, and sighed as the memory of Peggy filled his thoughts. \u201cNo. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t had the chance.\u201d </p><p>Quickly, you took a swig of the champagne. \u201cGuess we will have to change that.\u201d </p><p>Tension built from there on. You could feel yourself yearning to touch him, even caught yourself glancing at his lips from time to time. </p><p>Didn\u2019t help having alcohol mixed with your feelings. It was beginning to heat things up. And you were felt more confident than before. </p><p>\u201cNever have I ever imagined someone in this room naked.\u201d You said. </p><p>Steve\u2019s body immediately tensed, as he held your gaze with his. He waited for bluff, hoping you\u2019d break and change the question. But you held it together. </p><p>He took a long drink from his glass, not once tearing his eyes away from you. It made your legs clench together as part of you wanted to jump into his lap, in that very instant. </p><p>\u201cYou never go easy on me, do you?\u201d </p><p>As you let out a soft chuckle, you shook your head. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine, you want to play dirty, then let\u2019s play dirty.\u201d He smirked. \u201cNever have I ever wanted to kiss someone in this room.\u201d </p><p>You swallowed hard, lightly nibbling on your lower lip. </p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d </p><p>You hide your smile behind a drink, as Steve leaned back in to his seat. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so smug, Captain. We still have one more round.\u201d </p><p>He waved for you to go. His smile never faltering. </p><p>\u201cNever have I ever dreamt about the two of us hooking up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou really play for keeps. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d He smirked. </p><p>Steve locks his eyes with yours, while he takes a sip. </p><p>Your mind was hazed with the buzz from the alcohol, you weren\u2019t sure how you were still going. Growing into a giggling mess. </p><p>\u201cI still have one more question left.\u201d He muttered. \u201cNever have I ever gone skinny dipping.\u201d </p><p>A smile spread across your face. \u201cHa! That makes both of us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019ve never\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNope. So that means I won!\u201d </p><p>He shook his head but didn\u2019t fight it. Instead, he had only one thing on his mind, you. Nothing else mattered in that moment, and he wanted just a few more moments of that peace. </p><p>\u201cThank for this. I really needed it.\u201d His voice was soft. </p><p>You gently placed your hand over his. \u201cI\u2019m always here for you. But enough of that, what do I win?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWin?\u201d He was taken aback. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were playing for stakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the rules. You owe me something, mister. How about a kiss?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA kiss? Are you\u2014are you sure about this?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do anything you don\u2019t want to do. So if that makes you uncomfor\u2014\u201c </p><p>He cuts you off with his lips. Closing the distance between you with a longing kiss. You could feel it all the way down to your toes. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for you to  motion back, kissing him with hunger as his hands grasped your waist, pulling you on to his lap. </p><p>Everything felt as if it had disappeared and you two were all alone. Wanting nothing more than to take him right there and then. </p><p>Steve pulled apart from you, his forehead pressed against you as he tried to catch a breath. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t make this easy.\u201d He whispered. </p><p>Steve furrowed his brows, cupping your face with his calloused hands. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d He said. \u201cNot a day went by that I didn\u2019t think about you. I even flew out here a few times, ready to knock on your door\u2014but I made sure you were safe. I always made sure you were doing alright.\u201d </p><p>If you were sober, you knew you\u2019d never let him off this easy. Instead, you would have him work for your forgiveness. But your mind was clouded and you already caved into him. </p><p>\u201cWe have tomorrow to talk about everything, but for now, just kiss me again.\u201d </p><p>Without another word, Steve pulled you into him once again and held you close as his lips molded into yours. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if you really wanted to kiss me, you didn\u2019t have to come up with this game.\u201d He teased. </p><p>You rolled your eyes at him and chuckled. \u201cAnd instead of imagining me naked, why don\u2019t you take these clothes off of me?\u201d</p><p>And suddenly, you could feel Steve shift under you, as his eyes darkened with desire. </p><p>\u201cHow about we take this somewhere private?\u201d </p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>Champagne Kisses | Steve Rogers</h1><p>Summary : it\u2019s been a few years since you have last seen Steve. And the moment your see him turn up at your door, feelings resurface. </p><p>A/N : I got bored. And I don\u2019t even know anymore. It\u2019s trash but oh well! Lol. *drake Walker inspired me* </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"286\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6450a016770f5edabf4f5f338b58a6ee/tumblr_potdruRMtu1vgfc6m_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"286\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>It had been a few years since you last heard from the Captain himself. And when he showed up at your door, different emotions washed over you completely. </p><p>Anger had overpowered most of the other emotions, and as much as you wanted to slam the door in his face, with everyone disappearing, you knew you had to let him in. </p><p>The second Steve met your gaze, he let out a sigh of relief. As everyone vanished, fading into the air and dropping like ashes, his thoughts immediately fell to you. </p><p>But standing in front of you, knowing that you were safe, he felt like he could finally breathe again. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to let us in or do we need to pitch a tent out here until you do?\u201d Nat asked, raising her brow. </p><p>You cleared your throat and waved them inside. Glancing away from Steve gaze. </p><p>\u201cIt sure hasn\u2019t changed since the last time I was here.\u201d She muttered, walking down the hall toward where her old room. </p><p>Bruce made his way in and the second you saw him, your eyes lit up. </p><p>\u201cBanner!\u201d You exclaimed, throwing your arms around him. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d </p><p>He flashed a soft smirk, awkwardly embracing you. \u201cYou and me both.\u201d He stated. \u201cI really need some coffee though. It\u2019s been a crazy few days.\u201d </p><p>You let out a soft chuckle and nod your head. \u201cI get it.\u201d </p><p>And just like that, you were left alone with Steve. </p><p>Immediately, your stomach began to churn. Even with all the anger you had for him, you cared for him. Though he would never know. </p><p>For years, you were always drooling over the Captain. Especially, every time he came back from missions, wearing his suit. </p><p>But the more time you spent with him, training, missions, even grocery runs, you started to slowly fall for him. </p><p>Steve was an old soul. Mostly having to do with him being born decades ago, but he was charming to say the least. It was hard not to fall head over heels for the man. </p><p>He took a seat on one of the couches, holding his gaze on you. It felt as if they were burning through your body, creating heat to radiate all around you. </p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d He asked, his voice soft with pain hidden just slightly. </p><p>You met his glossy blue eyes, fighting to keep your walls up as you crossed your arms over your chest. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d You muttered. </p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes held yours, and in that moment you could see just how tired and hurt he was. The bags under his eyes indicated that he wasn\u2019t getting  much sleep, and the lines that formed around his face. </p><p>Seeing him like that was hard. Sure, he was always brooding and hard on himself, but you have never seen him like this. </p><p>And just like that, you were back to letting him in. </p><p>\u201cFine. But we need drinks first.\u201d You said. </p><p>His eyes followed you as you strode across the room, grabbing two glasses and a bottle of whiskey. </p><p>As you made your way back over to him, you sat in front of him and poured the alcohol beverage into the glasses. </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d You sighed, before taking a swig and feeling it glide down your throat. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d </p><p>Steve reached for his cup and watched the liquid swirl around. This wasn\u2019t easy for him to say the least. </p><p>\u201cUs.\u201d He finally spoke, breaking the small silence that had occurred. Glancing up and meeting your gaze. </p><p>You swallowed hard, not knowing what he meant or where this conversation was going. This was all new to you. </p><p>\u201cI never meant to leave without saying goodbye.\u201d He muttered, still holding your gaze. \u201cI just\u2014if I came back and saw you, I don\u2019t know if I would have had the strength to leave.\u201d </p><p>Those last few words had forced a shiver to ripple down your spine, causing chills to cover you completely. You almost forgot how to breathe. </p><p>Steve pulled himself to the edge of his seat, giving you all of his attention. </p><p>\u201cI distanced myself from you because I thought it would be easier.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEasier than what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier than admitting to myself about how I felt.\u201d He said. \u201cI have lost everyone I have ever loved. And i promised myself never to let anyone in. And the more I pushed you away, the more you pulled me in.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t your intentions, you weren\u2019t expecting to sit there and let him back in, but the more his words sunk into you, slowly, your walls began to break down. </p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how happy I was to see you open the door.\u201d His voice shook. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you.\u201d </p><p>Without realizing, you were both sitting at the edge of your seats, inches away from one another. </p><p>The way his eyes glossed over, you could see how much this hurt him, almost as much as it hurt you. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lose me.\u201d You said. \u201cLike it or not, you\u2019re kind of stuck with me. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s lips twitched into a soft smile, feeling as if the weight of the world had dissipated in that moment. </p><p>You knew you shouldn\u2019t cave in. Letting him in would give him the power to break your heart all over again and that was the last thing you wanted. But his trance was hard to ignore. </p><p>And before you knew it, you felt yourself slowly leaning closer to him, but immediately caught yourself and pulled back. </p><p>\u201cAlright, I declare this a stress free zone.\u201d You said before realizing the bottle of whiskey had finished. </p><p>Steve ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time we catch up.

And when he showed up at your door, different emotions washed over you completely. </p><p>Anger had overpowered most of the other emotions, and as much as you wanted to slam the door in his face, with everyone disappearing, you knew you had to let him in. </p><p>The second Steve met your gaze, he let out a sigh of relief. As everyone vanished, fading into the air and dropping like ashes, his thoughts immediately fell to you. </p><p>But standing in front of you, knowing that you were safe, he felt like he could finally breathe again. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to let us in or do we need to pitch a tent out here until you do?\u201d Nat asked, raising her brow. </p><p>You cleared your throat and waved them inside. Glancing away from Steve gaze. </p><p>\u201cIt sure hasn\u2019t changed since the last time I was here.\u201d She muttered, walking down the hall toward where her old room. </p><p>Bruce made his way in and the second you saw him, your eyes lit up. </p><p>\u201cBanner!\u201d You exclaimed, throwing your arms around him. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d </p><p>He flashed a soft smirk, awkwardly embracing you. \u201cYou and me both.\u201d He stated. \u201cI really need some coffee though. It\u2019s been a crazy few days.\u201d </p><p>You let out a soft chuckle and nod your head. \u201cI get it.\u201d </p><p>And just like that, you were left alone with Steve. </p><p>Immediately, your stomach began to churn. Even with all the anger you had for him, you cared for him. Though he would never know. </p><p>For years, you were always drooling over the Captain. Especially, every time he came back from missions, wearing his suit. </p><p>But the more time you spent with him, training, missions, even grocery runs, you started to slowly fall for him. </p><p>Steve was an old soul. Mostly having to do with him being born decades ago, but he was charming to say the least. It was hard not to fall head over heels for the man. </p><p>He took a seat on one of the couches, holding his gaze on you. It felt as if they were burning through your body, creating heat to radiate all around you. </p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d He asked, his voice soft with pain hidden just slightly. </p><p>You met his glossy blue eyes, fighting to keep your walls up as you crossed your arms over your chest. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d You muttered. </p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes held yours, and in that moment you could see just how tired and hurt he was. The bags under his eyes indicated that he wasn\u2019t getting  much sleep, and the lines that formed around his face. </p><p>Seeing him like that was hard. Sure, he was always brooding and hard on himself, but you have never seen him like this. </p><p>And just like that, you were back to letting him in. </p><p>\u201cFine. But we need drinks first.\u201d You said. </p><p>His eyes followed you as you strode across the room, grabbing two glasses and a bottle of whiskey. </p><p>As you made your way back over to him, you sat in front of him and poured the alcohol beverage into the glasses. </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d You sighed, before taking a swig and feeling it glide down your throat. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d </p><p>Steve reached for his cup and watched the liquid swirl around. This wasn\u2019t easy for him to say the least. </p><p>\u201cUs.\u201d He finally spoke, breaking the small silence that had occurred. Glancing up and meeting your gaze. </p><p>You swallowed hard, not knowing what he meant or where this conversation was going. This was all new to you. </p><p>\u201cI never meant to leave without saying goodbye.\u201d He muttered, still holding your gaze. \u201cI just\u2014if I came back and saw you, I don\u2019t know if I would have had the strength to leave.\u201d </p><p>Those last few words had forced a shiver to ripple down your spine, causing chills to cover you completely. You almost forgot how to breathe. </p><p>Steve pulled himself to the edge of his seat, giving you all of his attention. </p><p>\u201cI distanced myself from you because I thought it would be easier.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEasier than what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier than admitting to myself about how I felt.\u201d He said. \u201cI have lost everyone I have ever loved. And i promised myself never to let anyone in. And the more I pushed you away, the more you pulled me in.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t your intentions, you weren\u2019t expecting to sit there and let him back in, but the more his words sunk into you, slowly, your walls began to break down. </p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how happy I was to see you open the door.\u201d His voice shook. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you.\u201d </p><p>Without realizing, you were both sitting at the edge of your seats, inches away from one another. </p><p>The way his eyes glossed over, you could see how much this hurt him, almost as much as it hurt you. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lose me.\u201d You said. \u201cLike it or not, you\u2019re kind of stuck with me. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s lips twitched into a soft smile, feeling as if the weight of the world had dissipated in that moment. </p><p>You knew you shouldn\u2019t cave in. Letting him in would give him the power to break your heart all over again and that was the last thing you wanted. But his trance was hard to ignore. </p><p>And before you knew it, you felt yourself slowly leaning closer to him, but immediately caught yourself and pulled back. </p><p>\u201cAlright, I declare this a stress free zone.\u201d You said before realizing the bottle of whiskey had finished. </p><p>Steve ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time we catch up. Three years is a long time, Captain.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoes this mean more drinks?\u201d</p><p>You flashed a cheeky grin and propped up to your feet. \u201cVery much so.\u201d </p><p>You sprinted down to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of champagne. </p><p>\u201cThe wine cellar hasn\u2019t been restocked in years, so we will have to make due with what we got.\u201d </p><p>Steve nodded, trying not to smile like an idiot as he watched you from his seat. </p><p>Though he was exhausted, and had a million things running through his mind, he couldn\u2019t help but feel at ease with you. </p><p>\u201cAnd maybe we can even play a drinking game!\u201d You exclaimed. </p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey\u2014you don\u2019t even know what the game is yet!\u201d You chuckled. </p><p>\u201cLet me guess, you\u2019re about to tell me?\u201d </p><p>Your lips curved more at the edges, as you refilled the glasses with the champagne. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called never have I ever. You say something you haven\u2019t done and if the other person has done it, then\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cThey take a drink.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee! You\u2019re a natural.\u201d A soft chuckle escaped you both. \u201cSo whoever has had the least drinks after\u2014let\u2019s go five rounds\u2014wins.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about this\u2026\u201d he drawled out, running his hand through his hair. \u201cYou sure you want to go up against me in a drinking game?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a challenge. And I accept!\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s brows raised with shock but peaked with interest and decided to give it a shot. \u201cYou\u2019re on. So start.\u201d</p><p>You hand him his glass while he looked at you expectantly. </p><p>\u201cGuess I better make this first question count then.\u201d You pondered your thoughts for just a moment before flashing a cynical smile. \u201cNever have I ever been called Captain.\u201d </p><p>Suddenly Steve shook his head, trying to hide the smirk as he took a sip of his drink. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating.\u201d </p><p>You shrugged your shoulders. \u201cYour turn.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright. Never have I ever gone dancing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, seriously? You havent?\u201d You asked, a bit intrigued. </p><p>Steve nodded, and sighed as the memory of Peggy filled his thoughts. \u201cNo. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t had the chance.\u201d </p><p>Quickly, you took a swig of the champagne. \u201cGuess we will have to change that.\u201d </p><p>Tension built from there on. You could feel yourself yearning to touch him, even caught yourself glancing at his lips from time to time. </p><p>Didn\u2019t help having alcohol mixed with your feelings. It was beginning to heat things up. And you were felt more confident than before. </p><p>\u201cNever have I ever imagined someone in this room naked.\u201d You said. </p><p>Steve\u2019s body immediately tensed, as he held your gaze with his. He waited for bluff, hoping you\u2019d break and change the question. But you held it together. </p><p>He took a long drink from his glass, not once tearing his eyes away from you. It made your legs clench together as part of you wanted to jump into his lap, in that very instant. </p><p>\u201cYou never go easy on me, do you?\u201d </p><p>As you let out a soft chuckle, you shook your head. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine, you want to play dirty, then let\u2019s play dirty.\u201d He smirked. \u201cNever have I ever wanted to kiss someone in this room.\u201d </p><p>You swallowed hard, lightly nibbling on your lower lip. </p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d </p><p>You hide your smile behind a drink, as Steve leaned back in to his seat. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so smug, Captain. We still have one more round.\u201d </p><p>He waved for you to go. His smile never faltering. </p><p>\u201cNever have I ever dreamt about the two of us hooking up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou really play for keeps. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d He smirked. </p><p>Steve locks his eyes with yours, while he takes a sip. </p><p>Your mind was hazed with the buzz from the alcohol, you weren\u2019t sure how you were still going. Growing into a giggling mess. </p><p>\u201cI still have one more question left.\u201d He muttered. \u201cNever have I ever gone skinny dipping.\u201d </p><p>A smile spread across your face. \u201cHa! That makes both of us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019ve never\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNope. So that means I won!\u201d </p><p>He shook his head but didn\u2019t fight it. Instead, he had only one thing on his mind, you. Nothing else mattered in that moment, and he wanted just a few more moments of that peace. </p><p>\u201cThank for this. I really needed it.\u201d His voice was soft. </p><p>You gently placed your hand over his. \u201cI\u2019m always here for you. But enough of that, what do I win?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWin?\u201d He was taken aback. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were playing for stakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the rules. You owe me something, mister. How about a kiss?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA kiss? Are you\u2014are you sure about this?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do anything you don\u2019t want to do. So if that makes you uncomfor\u2014\u201c </p><p>He cuts you off with his lips. Closing the distance between you with a longing kiss. You could feel it all the way down to your toes. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for you to  motion back, kissing him with hunger as his hands grasped your waist, pulling you on to his lap. </p><p>Everything felt as if it had disappeared and you two were all alone. Wanting nothing more than to take him right there and then. </p><p>Steve pulled apart from you, his forehead pressed against you as he tried to catch a breath. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t make this easy.\u201d He whispered. </p><p>Steve furrowed his brows, cupping your face with his calloused hands. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d He said. \u201cNot a day went by that I didn\u2019t think about you. I even flew out here a few times, ready to knock on your door\u2014but I made sure you were safe. I always made sure you were doing alright.\u201d </p><p>If you were sober, you knew you\u2019d never let him off this easy. Instead, you would have him work for your forgiveness. But your mind was clouded and you already caved into him. </p><p>\u201cWe have tomorrow to talk about everything, but for now, just kiss me again.\u201d </p><p>Without another word, Steve pulled you into him once again and held you close as his lips molded into yours. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if you really wanted to kiss me, you didn\u2019t have to come up with this game.\u201d He teased. </p><p>You rolled your eyes at him and chuckled. \u201cAnd instead of imagining me naked, why don\u2019t you take these clothes off of me?\u201d</p><p>And suddenly, you could feel Steve shift under you, as his eyes darkened with desire. </p><p>\u201cHow about we take this somewhere private?\u201d </p></p>",

You owe me something, mister. How about a kiss?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A kiss? Are you&mdash;are you sure about this?&rdquo; He asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to do anything you don&rsquo;t want to do. So if that makes you uncomfor&mdash;&ldquo; </p><p>He cuts you off with his lips. Closing the distance between you with a longing kiss. You could feel it all the way down to your toes. </p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for you to  motion back, kissing him with hunger as his hands grasped your waist, pulling you on to his lap. </p><p>Everything felt as if it had disappeared and you two were all alone. Wanting nothing more than to take him right there and then. </p><p>Steve pulled apart from you, his forehead pressed against you as he tried to catch a breath. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t make this easy.&rdquo; He whispered. </p><p>Steve furrowed his brows, cupping your face with his calloused hands. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Y/N.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;Not a day went by that I didn&rsquo;t think about you. I even flew out here a few times, ready to knock on your door&mdash;but I made sure you were safe. I always made sure you were doing alright.&rdquo; </p><p>If you were sober, you knew you&rsquo;d never let him off this easy. Instead, you would have him work for your forgiveness. But your mind was clouded and you already caved into him. </p><p>&ldquo;We have tomorrow to talk about everything, but for now, just kiss me again.&rdquo; </p><p>Without another word, Steve pulled you into him once again and held you close as his lips molded into yours. </p><p>&ldquo;You know, if you really wanted to kiss me, you didn&rsquo;t have to come up with this game.&rdquo; He teased. </p><p>You rolled your eyes at him and chuckled. &ldquo;And instead of imagining me naked, why don&rsquo;t you take these clothes off of me?&rdquo;</p><p>And suddenly, you could feel Steve shift under you, as his eyes darkened with desire. </p><p>&ldquo;How about we take this somewhere private?&rdquo; </p></p>",

You close the door and your purse and keys on the kitchen counter. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, honey?\u201d Chris asks from the living room, turning his body to look at you. </p><p>\u201cMy boss is such an asshole and loves to give me all the work to do. Can you believe he makes me do work at work!\u201d Chris shakes his head and laughs a little. \u201cWow actually working at work, what a concept.\u201d </p><p>You shake your head in annoyance and head towards the bedroom. As your walking you come to the realization that Chris is still in his work clothes. Red and navy blue flannel with dark blue jeans. Seeing him in his work clothes always gets you all hot and bothered, and you just think about him sawing that wood all day long. It\u2019s drives you crazy. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, little miss?\u201d He turns the television off and gets up from off the couch. He is following you down the hall that leads to your guys bedroom. You are taking off your jewelry. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath, I just want to relax a little.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to draw you a bath?\u201d He calls out from the bathroom. \u201cYes, please.\u201d As he is running the water for you, you are getting undressed and putting on your robe in the bedroom. </p><p>You\u2019re in the bath for about an hour and had just gotten out and put your black robe on when Chris comes to the door. He knocks a little and then proceeds to slowly open it. He\u2019s still in his work clothes and you just can\u2019t help but put your hands all over him. You\u2019re kissing his lips so passionately like you haven\u2019t seen him days and you\u2019re really getting into it, but he stops you.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making me stop?\u201d Your voice was so low, almost like a whisper. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to do this right now.\u201d He turns around to walk out of the room, closes the door behind him and heads to the bedroom. You don\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s going on with him. You finish up throwing on your clothes in the bathroom and grab your things. You follow not too far behind him. You have this worried look on your face because you don\u2019t know what is wrong. He is always such a happy guy. You climb on top of the bed and cuddle up next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Chris?\u201d You can see the sadness in his eyes but he just answers with, \u201cNothing, honey. Can we just cuddle and watch tv before we cook dinner?\u201d You nod your head and say of course and lay your head on his chest. </p><p>He kisses the top of your head, \u201cI love you, baby girl.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you too, babe.\u201d <br/>** <br/>After dinner, you tell Chris to just go get comfortable and get in bed, you\u2019ll be in after you clean up from dinner. You\u2019re still in your robe but you have a black tank top and red panties on underneath it. You clean up from dinner and turn off the remaining lights that are on, then head to Chris in the bedroom. </p><p>\u201cHey, Chr-\u201d you stop mid sentence because you notice that he is fast asleep. You tip toe over to his side of the bed and place a long kiss on his cherry lips. He lets out a soft moan as your lips part from his. And just as you turn to walk away he pulls you right back in by the bottom of your robe. </p><p>\u201cHey come back here, baby. You aren\u2019t getting away that easy.\u201d His mood had changed completely, you weren\u2019t complaining but what had changed. You liked this new attitude though. You fall right on top of him when he pulled you back. Your faces right in line with one another, staring into each other\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cWell are you going to kiss me or not?\u201d you said jokingly with a little pout. </p><p>\u201cAm I going to kiss you? Baby, I\u2019m going to do more than just kiss you!\u201d He rolls you over so he is now hovering over you and he slowly unties your robe with the slightest of touch. He makes direct eye contact with you, never leaving his sight the whole time he is undoing it. </p><p>He runs his fingers down your side and kisses right below your ear. He whispers in your ear, \u201cI\u2019m going to sex you up real good.\u201d You both laugh at the same time because he has never said anything like that before. </p><p>You bite your lower lip as he gently starts planting kisses all the way down your body starting at your nose and ending at your naval. He can tell how much his touch you are living hi touch and the effect it is having on you. He steadily removes your red panties with his teeth and that drives you wild. Your breathing starts to get heavy and you manage to mumble out \u201churry up, you\u2019re taking to long.\u201d He smirks at you and you know exactly what is coming and there is no going back. </p><p>He goes down on you gracefully and takes his time. He is gentlest lover you have ever had. But he can be rough when he wants too. His mouth always felt amazing and his tongue work was out of this world. Luckily for you he is growing his facial hair out and boy, did it feel good on your inner thighs. You\u2019re running your fingers through his hair, pulling it every time he hits the right spot. \u201cChris, I\u2019m-\u201d you moan out. </p><p>\u201cShh shh, I know baby. Not yet.\u201d You try your best to contain yourself but damn he is just so good at it, the things he does with his tongue. It\u2019s magic and takes your breath away. Just when you think he is going to give you a break, he starts fingering your folds in a nice slow manner. And if you know anything about Chris, you know that all the fingering is accurate. </p><p>\u201cDaddy, just fuck me already,\u201d you say breathlessly. He removes his finger from inside of you and you sigh at the loss of contact. He sucks your juices from his fingers and gets up on his knees to remove his flannel, but you stop him and say \u201cleave it on, just unbutton it\u201d with a wink. He goes to remove his underwear in the dorkiest of fashions and you both laugh. That is one thing about Chris he is the dorkiest guy ever and that\u2019s what you love most about him. </p><p>You remove your robe and your shirt the rest of the way then he climbs on top of you, showering you with open mouthed kisses all over your mouth and neck. Your hips rise in search to find his, they connect and your grinding on one another. His hand guides his length to find your aching hole and once he is in, it is game over. As he starts off slow moving in and out, it drives you mad. You pull him in as close to you as possible, you become one with each other. His hips rocking back and forth with yours, his head nuzzled in your neck, you couldn\u2019t think of anywhere else you\u2019d rather be. He begins to pick up the tempo and your moans get louder and louder each time. You\u2019re scratching his back with your nails and suddenly you feel you need to dominate. </p><p>You roll him over and you have all the power now. You hear his breath hitch as you got on top. You place your hand on his chest and he grabs your hips. You ride him like there is no tomorrow, and you can see how surprised he is that you\u2019re doing this. \u201cDamn baby, I didn\u2019t know you had it in you,\u201d he says with a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cStop talking, Chris\u201d you say as you throw your head back. You pick up your thrust and start to go a little fast, rolling your hips back and forth and Chris don\u2019t know what hit him. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m so close,\u201d he moans. Without even thinking you throw Chris\u2019 words right back at him, \u201cshh shh, baby. Not yet.\u201d </p><p>You thrust a little longer until you see it in his eyes that he could combust at any moment. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d you say and you both release at the same time. You fall over to the side to catch your breath. You open your eyes and turn to look at him, \u201cI\u2019ll have to do that more often.\u201d He looks at you and says, \u201cI\u2019d like that, baby girl.\u201d </p>",

That is one thing about Chris he is the dorkiest guy ever and that\u2019s what you love most about him. </p><p>You remove your robe and your shirt the rest of the way then he climbs on top of you, showering you with open mouthed kisses all over your mouth and neck. Your hips rise in search to find his, they connect and your grinding on one another. His hand guides his length to find your aching hole and once he is in, it is game over. As he starts off slow moving in and out, it drives you mad. You pull him in as close to you as possible, you become one with each other. His hips rocking back and forth with yours, his head nuzzled in your neck, you couldn\u2019t think of anywhere else you\u2019d rather be. He begins to pick up the tempo and your moans get louder and louder each time. You\u2019re scratching his back with your nails and suddenly you feel you need to dominate. </p><p>You roll him over and you have all the power now. You hear his breath hitch as you got on top. You place your hand on his chest and he grabs your hips. You ride him like there is no tomorrow, and you can see how surprised he is that you\u2019re doing this. \u201cDamn baby, I didn\u2019t know you had it in you,\u201d he says with a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cStop talking, Chris\u201d you say as you throw your head back. You pick up your thrust and start to go a little fast, rolling your hips back and forth and Chris don\u2019t know what hit him. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m so close,\u201d he moans. Without even thinking you throw Chris\u2019 words right back at him, \u201cshh shh, baby. Not yet.\u201d </p><p>You thrust a little longer until you see it in his eyes that he could combust at any moment. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d you say and you both release at the same time. You fall over to the side to catch your breath. You open your eyes and turn to look at him, \u201cI\u2019ll have to do that more often.\u201d He looks at you and says, \u201cI\u2019d like that, baby girl.\u201d </p>",

You close the door and your purse and keys on the kitchen counter. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, honey?\u201d Chris asks from the living room, turning his body to look at you. </p><p>\u201cMy boss is such an asshole and loves to give me all the work to do. Can you believe he makes me do work at work!\u201d Chris shakes his head and laughs a little. \u201cWow actually working at work, what a concept.\u201d </p><p>You shake your head in annoyance and head towards the bedroom. As your walking you come to the realization that Chris is still in his work clothes. Red and navy blue flannel with dark blue jeans. Seeing him in his work clothes always gets you all hot and bothered, and you just think about him sawing that wood all day long. It\u2019s drives you crazy. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, little miss?\u201d He turns the television off and gets up from off the couch. He is following you down the hall that leads to your guys bedroom. You are taking off your jewelry. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath, I just want to relax a little.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to draw you a bath?\u201d He calls out from the bathroom. \u201cYes, please.\u201d As he is running the water for you, you are getting undressed and putting on your robe in the bedroom. </p><p>You\u2019re in the bath for about an hour and had just gotten out and put your black robe on when Chris comes to the door. He knocks a little and then proceeds to slowly open it. He\u2019s still in his work clothes and you just can\u2019t help but put your hands all over him. You\u2019re kissing his lips so passionately like you haven\u2019t seen him days and you\u2019re really getting into it, but he stops you.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making me stop?\u201d Your voice was so low, almost like a whisper. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to do this right now.\u201d He turns around to walk out of the room, closes the door behind him and heads to the bedroom. You don\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s going on with him. You finish up throwing on your clothes in the bathroom and grab your things. You follow not too far behind him. You have this worried look on your face because you don\u2019t know what is wrong. He is always such a happy guy. You climb on top of the bed and cuddle up next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Chris?\u201d You can see the sadness in his eyes but he just answers with, \u201cNothing, honey. Can we just cuddle and watch tv before we cook dinner?\u201d You nod your head and say of course and lay your head on his chest. </p><p>He kisses the top of your head, \u201cI love you, baby girl.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you too, babe.\u201d <br>** <br>After dinner, you tell Chris to just go get comfortable and get in bed, you\u2019ll be in after you clean up from dinner. You\u2019re still in your robe but you have a black tank top and red panties on underneath it. You clean up from dinner and turn off the remaining lights that are on, then head to Chris in the bedroom. </p><p>\u201cHey, Chr-\u201d you stop mid sentence because you notice that he is fast asleep. You tip toe over to his side of the bed and place a long kiss on his cherry lips. He lets out a soft moan as your lips part from his. And just as you turn to walk away he pulls you right back in by the bottom of your robe. </p><p>\u201cHey come back here, baby. You aren\u2019t getting away that easy.\u201d His mood had changed completely, you weren\u2019t complaining but what had changed. You liked this new attitude though. You fall right on top of him when he pulled you back. Your faces right in line with one another, staring into each other\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cWell are you going to kiss me or not?\u201d you said jokingly with a little pout. </p><p>\u201cAm I going to kiss you? Baby, I\u2019m going to do more than just kiss you!\u201d He rolls you over so he is now hovering over you and he slowly unties your robe with the slightest of touch. He makes direct eye contact with you, never leaving his sight the whole time he is undoing it. </p><p>He runs his fingers down your side and kisses right below your ear. He whispers in your ear, \u201cI\u2019m going to sex you up real good.\u201d You both laugh at the same time because he has never said anything like that before. </p><p>You bite your lower lip as he gently starts planting kisses all the way down your body starting at your nose and ending at your naval. He can tell how much his touch you are living hi touch and the effect it is having on you. He steadily removes your red panties with his teeth and that drives you wild. Your breathing starts to get heavy and you manage to mumble out \u201churry up, you\u2019re taking to long.\u201d He smirks at you and you know exactly what is coming and there is no going back. </p><p>He goes down on you gracefully and takes his time. He is gentlest lover you have ever had. But he can be rough when he wants too. His mouth always felt amazing and his tongue work was out of this world. Luckily for you he is growing his facial hair out and boy, did it feel good on your inner thighs. You\u2019re running your fingers through his hair, pulling it every time he hits the right spot. \u201cChris, I\u2019m-\u201d you moan out. </p><p>\u201cShh shh, I know baby. Not yet.\u201d You try your best to contain yourself but damn he is just so good at it, the things he does with his tongue. It\u2019s magic and takes your breath away. Just when you think he is going to give you a break, he starts fingering your folds in a nice slow manner. And if you know anything about Chris, you know that all the fingering is accurate. </p><p>\u201cDaddy, just fuck me already,\u201d you say breathlessly. He removes his finger from inside of you and you sigh at the loss of contact. He sucks your juices from his fingers and gets up on his knees to remove his flannel, but you stop him and say \u201cleave it on, just unbutton it\u201d with a wink. He goes to remove his underwear in the dorkiest of fashions and you both laugh.

It had been a long day at work and the case they were working on was horrible. The cold beer was the only thing taking his mind off the horrors he had witnessed. That was until the door opened and she walked into the bar.</i></p><p><i>Lord was she beautiful. The air in his lungs all seemed to leave him and the world slowly started to fade away. She was the only thing that he was focused on. Right then and there.</i></p><p><i>He watched as her eyes scanned around the bar as if she was looking for someone. Maybe she was meeting someone? A boyfriend? He was definitely curious about her. The corner of his eye, he could see his brother and coworker just watching him closely as his eyes were focused on this beautiful woman who walked into the bar.<b> Into his life.</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cJust go talk to her\u201d He felt his brother nudge him, trying to get him to move. He tried several times but he was just spellbound.</i></p><p><i>His eyes followed her every move as she took a seat near the end of the bar. Christopher had come over to take her order and placed it in front of her. That\u2019s when he noticed it - <b>her smile.</b> The minute Jay saw her smile was the moment he needed to go talk to this girl.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDude, just go talk to the girl. What do you have to lose?\u201d Antonio smirked over at his friend who looked like a lovesick puppy. His eyes were strictly focused on the girl.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on Jay. Show us those moves all the girls love.\u201d Will took a sip and hid that smirk behind the glass bottle. Will swore Jay was about to rip his head off just for the teasing. This was a completely different side of him that he had never seen before.</i></p><p><i>Taking a big swig of beer, he got up out of his seat and slowly made his way over towards her. The beating of his heart could be felt against his chest the closer Jay got. The feeling of the sweat on his hands and forehead were starting to form. Jay noticed her beauty the closer he got to her. How her light brown hair shined in the bar lighting, her lip piercing and combat boots. Her knee was bouncing up and down as a nervous tic. Her short frame perfectly right in front of him. Her attention was turned to the tv to whatever sport that was currently on.</i></p><p>The events of how they met played in his head. The exact conversation - the first words he spoke to her.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI think you\u2019re the only person in here not drinking a beer or some sort of liquor.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>She had turned around to look at him with her eyebrow cocked and the most confused look. Her focus was now eyeing him up and down. Like he had stepped into her personal space or maybe she just wasn\u2019t use to someone hitting on her. Who was he kidding - she probably had a boyfriend and was waiting for him.</i></p><p>Her first words echoed in his head caused a small chuckle from his lips. <i><b>\u201cI am waiting for someone\u201d</b></i>\u2026.. <i>Her eyes were dead focused on him</i>\u2026.<i><b>\u201cBesides beer is nasty.\u201d</b></i></p><p>A small smile came on his face as he heard Tegan\u2019s words in his head. Her sweet, soft voice that brought peace to his mind. The fact she was waiting for her friends and there was no boyfriend. He was able to talk to Tegan and not worry about that. That she actually let him sit with her and enjoyed her company.</p><p>From then on, the conversation just seemed to flow. How they spent 30 minutes talking and laughing. How Daphne came over and was being the protective cousin. Tegan decided to stay with him and just talk. He couldn\u2019t help but feel excited and instantly wanted to ask her out on a date. They both spent most of the night texting each other. The next morning was spent drinking lots of coffee but it was totally worth it. Jay Halstead was completely swept away. Most people would think he was crazy considering they had only been dating about 2 weeks but it didn\u2019t change how he felt inside. Those were the real feelings that he felt. That Tegan felt.</p><p>How they both spent all day talking in the park. They could just open up to each other and just be themselves. The feeling of her lips pressed against his as they kissed on the Farris Wheel. The moment they fell asleep on the couch in each other\u2019s arms. He honestly didn\u2019t want to leave her that day. The one thing that remained in his head was\u2026<b>Her smile.</b></p><p>The same smile she always gave him, the same one that made his heart raced the first night they met. That was the greatest night of his life and he wasn\u2019t about to let anyone or thing take her away from him. The only way he was going to let her go was if she didn\u2019t want to be with him anymore. That she didn\u2019t have any feelings for him but even then he would still fight for her.</p><p>The moment Antonio called him and mentioned Tegan\u2019s apartment, his heart nearly dropped to the bottom of his chest. He knew that something was going to happen at that apartment complex. It was run down and just from the looks of it, the people were somewhat sketchy. His girl was completely in the middle of that and he would be damned if Tegan would be there any longer.</p><p>The siren blared through the streets signaling that there was an emergency. The snow was slowly falling down as there was a winter storm coming. It seemed like nothing was on his side as every street light had turned red but it didn\u2019t matter. He drove through the lights like nothing else. The foot was hitting hard on the gas as he drove. His heart hammering out his chest as he drove.</p><p>Jay just prayed that Tegan was safe. That he could pull her into his arms and kiss her. God help that the person that was at fault for this. The rage could be felt in his arms and hands gripping the steering wheel as he drove. He promised Tegan he would do everything in order to protect her. Jay wasn\u2019t about to break his promise to her.</p><p>Taking a sharp turn down her street, he could see the police lights as well as several ambulances. This sending Jay into overdrive as he witnessed it. Putting the car in park, Jay grabbed his gun, placed it in his holster and hopped out of the car. His legs taking over as he quickly walked near her apartment complex. It looked like most of his team was already here and his boss Hank Voight was talking to some cops over in the corner. Antonio could see the look on Jay\u2019s face as he came closer to the team.</p><p>\u201cJay stop! Voight has ordered us to stand down for the moment.\u201d The sinking feeling in Jay\u2019s heart just took over as he was ordered to stop. Then it quickly turned to anger as he was being denied access to the apartment complex.</p><p>\u201cTHAT\u2019S MY GIRLFRIEND, Antonio! I am not going to sit here and wait. I am going to go in and get her!\u201d Jay tried to push forward but his coworker Kevin and Adam quickly backed up Antonio. He desperately did his best to try and move forward but it was no use as several other cops came forward blocking Jay from getting in.</p><p>\u201cI understand that Jay, but right now we don\u2019t have all the details before we go in. I know you want to go in there, but let Voight come back and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d Antonio was doing his best to reason with Jay but he could see the fire in his friend\u2019s eyes. It was that same fire that he, himself had when his son was kidnapped when his daughter was kidnapped. They had to remain level headed and smart or more damage could possibly be done.</p><p>Just then Voight had come over towards the group with a serious look on his face. Jay was starting to get antsy as things weren\u2019t progressing the way he wanted to. Every waking minute just seemed to be never-ending. That he was stuck in a nightmare and couldn\u2019t get out of it. Who knows if Tegan was hurt and bleeding. She was probably scared and calling out for him. This was basically killing him inside.</p><p>\u201cHank, I am going in there whether you all like it or not. My girlfriend is in that building.\u201d Jay was doing his best to plead with his boss. It didn\u2019t even seem like it was working as Voight shock his head no.</p><p>\u201cJay, I understand that we are working on a plan at the moment. Please be patient, Jay.\u201d Looking amongst the group as they seemed to be just as nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know so far?\u201d Adam was the first one to ask the question that needed to be answered. If they truly knew what was going on, a plan could be made and Jay could get to Tegan faster.</p><p>\u201cAll we know is that there was an argument on the 5th floor which caused some shots were fired. Several neighbors called the cops, but when they arrived, there seemed to be gunfire towards the cops. We don\u2019t have any information on any of the neighbors. That\u2019s the reason why we aren\u2019t going in. If they are being held hostage, we don\u2019t want to risk causalities.\u201d Voight explained but it still didn\u2019t bring any ease to Jay\u2019s mind. It actually brought even worse thoughts to his mind.</p><p>\u201cHow do YOU expect to get any information on the neighbors if no one can get inside?\u201d Jay\u2019s voice was on the verge of shouting as his team looked at him. Concern was written all over there faces. This was HIS girl they were talking about after all.</p><p>\u201cJay, I understand that and do you think I want anyone injured as well? I want to do this in a civil controlled manner. But I will not risk it because you want to go half cocked. Now we will do this when we have all the details. If you don\u2019t want to help or cannot calm down - I will bench you.\u201d Jay just stared at Voight as he spoke. Both trying to come to some sort of understand as he looked at his boss.</p><p>Just then shots were fired\u2026Almost instantly everyone took off towards the apartment. Jay\u2019s legs never took off faster as he ran inside\u2026..</p><hr><p>Tegan wrapped the covers around her body tightly. It was a lot colder than she had originally anticipated it being or maybe it was the pure fact the heater and ac weren\u2019t working. That fucking landlord couldn\u2019t fix anything in this damn place. There was nothing that could be done right now as she wrapped it closer to her body. All she wanted was to be warm and be wrapped in Jay\u2019s strong arms.<br/></p><p>The past few nights, dreams of him had entered her brain. Most of them being erotic and some romantic. Jay had entered her life when she least expected it. The moment he walked up to her and flashed that pretty boy smile. She was completely swept away. Jay was everything she wanted in a man. Funny, smart, romantic and muscular as hell. His strong arms and the way his jeans fitted his body.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deny that she was falling for him.<b> Hard. </b>He was constantly on her mind and in her dreams. Yes, her heart was still guarded but it felt like Jay was something more. But could that even be possible? They were only dating for two weeks. Of course, they were taking it slow, but she couldn\u2019t deny there was something more between them. She would just have to follow her heart to see where it led.</p><p>She struggled to go to sleep but it was no use. Between the cold weather and loud arguing at 4:30 am. Ugh. Do any of these people ever sleep? Throwing the covers over her head, she groaned loudly. All she wanted to do was sleep. That\u2019s when she heard the loud banging against her kitchen wall. Placing her feet on the cold ground, she started to walk over towards the kitchen to knock on the wall. Before she made it to the kitchen, several cracks of pops came off.</p><p>It was gunfire. Her heart started to race as she heard it and backed away from the wall. That\u2019s when she felt a sharp pain hit her leg causing her to fall down. Looking down, she noticed it started to bleed. Tegan tried to get up but it was no use as she fell to the ground instantly. The pain in her leg started to radiate all the way up. Dragging her body towards her bedroom, she needed to find somewhere to lay low. To hideaway. Who knows if they were going to come back or what was going to happen next.</p><p>The blood could be seen on the ground as she dragged herself towards the closet. That\u2019s when Tegan grabbed one of the shirts on her chair, nearest to her, to wrap it around her leg. Tears started to whelm in her eyes as pulled it tight against her skin. What was she going to do? She needed to find safety and quickly. Her closet.</p><p>Tegan did her best to limp towards the closet. Luckily, there was only a small amount of blood that was dragged but there was a decent size puddle where she fell to the ground. She couldn\u2019t worry about that right now. She just prayed that Jay wound find her. That he would save her. \u201cShit, my phone is on the other side of the room\u201d realizing she couldn\u2019t call Jay.</p><p>There was no point in getting the phone right now. She didn\u2019t know what was going to happen and didn\u2019t want to risk it. Closing the door behind her, Tegan found a blanket and wrapped it around her body. Everything seemed to fade just a bit as she felt dizzy. Or maybe it was the fact she could be dying? No! She wasn\u2019t going to die here. <b>Not today</b>. Jay would come and save her. Tegan had to believe that.</p><p>Doing her best to stay awake, she wrapped the blanket tightly around her body. That\u2019s when she heard another set of gunfire go off. Getting up slowly, she made her way to the very back of the closet. Behind all the boxes that were still in there and the clothes that hung up. Honestly, it was pretty warm back there despite the heater not even working.</p><p><i><b>\u201cJay, please save me.\u201d</b></i> Her voice was just above a whisper and tears started to stream down her face as she spoke to the empty room. All she wanted was for him to find her and hopefully, that would be soon.</p><p>Her own body started to feel weak as the cold was now starting to hit her. Or maybe it was the lack of sleep or even blood loss from her leg. Tegan felt her eyes slowly start to close and her body fall to the ground as darkness took over.</p><hr><p>Voight had led the charge into the apartment complex, followed by several officers and SWAT. Knocking could be heard on the lower floors as a means to check on the neighbors. That wasn\u2019t Jay\u2019s top priority. His mind was only on Tegan and making sure she was safe.<br/></p><p>Jay had his gun drawn to his side as they came up the stairs. The closer he got to her door, the more his heart started to race. It was as if tunnel vision took over. Her door was strictly in sight now - <b>5D</b>. Other footsteps were behind him as well following him towards the 5th floor. Antonio was close behind him knowing exactly what his mindset was on.</p><p>Jay watched as Voight, Adam, and Kevin all went towards the other doors on the left side of Tegan\u2019s door and Kim and Hailey followed towards the right side. No one had a clue as to which apartment on the fifth floor it came from. It was pretty much a guessing game at this point. The game had completely changed now as they entered the other apartments.</p><p>With his gun pointed at the door, Jay nodded at Antonio to bust the door open. It was completely easy after all being a crappy apartment after all. The moment they entered the apartment, a strong blast of cold air had whipped past them.</p><p>\u201cShit! It\u2019s freezing in here.\u201d Antonio whispered. Jay had to admit her apartment was freezing as he saw his own breath out of his mouth. He was now in overdrive as time seemed to be of the essence. He had to find her. \u201cJay, over here!\u201d Antonio shouted as he looked down at the ground and found a pool of blood on the ground.</p><p><i>\u201cFuck!\u201d</i> Jay muttered turning his head to look around the room. Her bed was completely empty except the bear he got her from the Pier. The fact that Tegan had it closer to her when she slept meant a lot to him. Placing it back on the bed, he turned around and noticed there weren\u2019t very many places to hide in a one bedroom apartment. Jay got down on the ground to check under the bed. <b>Nothing.</b> Antonio looked in the bathroom and turned right back around.</p><p>There was nothing in either place except the coldness of the room. Whoever owned this apartment complex was about to have a very bad day. It was one thing to neglect the upkeep of the apartment, it was a completely another thing not to have the air and heat properly working.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know where she could be. We have checked under the bed and the bathroom. The living room is clear as well.\u201d Antonio mentioned. Jay turned around and saw her closet. Turning the handle, Antonio flashed his flashlight into the closet. It was filled with most of her clothes and several boxes.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me see,\u201d Jay whispered as he took the flashlight from his coworker. He proceeded further into the closet and looked past the boxes that were near the back. \u201cTake this.\u201d Jay handed back the flashlight to Antonio and his heart raced as he saw Tegan laying with a blanket wrapped around her. It was a small blanket, to say the least.</p><p>\u201cTegan, baby, I am here. Please wake up.\u201d Jay\u2019s voice cracked just a bit as he spoke. He was practically pleading but there was no response from her.</p><p>His fingers went towards her neck in a means to check her pulse. \u201cShe\u2019s alive but it\u2019s a weak pulse. We need the ambo here now.\u201d That\u2019s when Jay noticed her leg and the blood-soaked shirt around her leg. \u201cShit! She\u2019s been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCivilian shot, we need an ambo now!\u201d Antonio\u2019s voice was filled with worry as Jay picked up an unconscious Tegan in his arms. Doing his best not to break down, Jay placed Tegan on the ground and took her blanket off the bed to wrap her. Tegan\u2019s lips were blue, her body was completely freezing and her pulse was weak. He could tell from the blood on the ground, Tegan had lost a decent amount of blood.</p><p>Just then Voight and Adam walked in the room. There was no expression on Jay\u2019s face as Tegan\u2019s head was placed in his lap. Just then Voight keyed his radio up.</p><p>\u201cAmbo 51, we need you here now! We have a civilian shot in the leg and she is unconscious.\u201d There was anger in Voight\u2019s voice.</p><p><i>\u201cWe are coming up now.\u201d</i></p><p>Just then paramedics Sylvie Brett and Emily Foster entered the room right past Voight and Adam. Both of them noticed Tegan wrapped in the blanket and the blood was seeping through her blanket. Honestly, they feared Jay at that moment with Tegan in his lap. It was like they never saw this side of Jay as his facial expression was completely blank except the fire behind his eyes. Almost as if he was going to lose it right then and there.</p><p>\u201cJay, let us take care of her. Don\u2019t worry, we will take care of her. If she has any family, I suggest you call them and let them know.\u201d Sylvie placed her hand on Jay\u2019s back in reassurance. It did no good. Nothing was going to reassure Jay until she was out of danger.</p><p>\u201cWe are taking her to Med. I will let your brother know okay?\u201d Emily was quick to reassure Jay as well. But all Jay could do was look at Tegan being wheeled out in a gurney. The fact he couldn\u2019t save her from this. That he should have listened to his gut when he felt like something was wrong. He should have brought her back to his apartment last night.</p><p>Looking down at the floor, he saw the blood that was now being tracked out of the apartment. It was HER blood. That\u2019s when he felt a hand being placed on his back. \u201cWe will find the son of a bitch who did this and make him pay.\u201d</p><p>Jay just pushed the hand off his back and turned around to look at Voight, Antonio, and Adam. Just then Kevin, Hailey, and Kim entered the apartment as well, unsure of what had just happened \u201cYou better be sure we are going to find this son of a bitch and he\u2019s going to get what\u2019s coming to him. He hurt Tegan and now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d With that Jay left his teammates behind.</p><p>\u201cAntonio, keep an eye on him. When we have more information, I will let you know. Right now we have to figure out what went on here.\u201d Voight turned his attention towards Antonio. \u201cLet me know if he does anything rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you once we get to Med.\u201d Antonio quickly left and to catch up to Jay. Deep down, he had a sinking feeling once Jay got ahold of the person, it wasn\u2019t going to end well. Voight just hoped that he could get to Jay before he did something stupid.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know this hits to close to home for Jay. For now, we work the case like we always do. Follow the leads and interview everyone. We will only tell Jay if we have to. For right now his attention needs to be on Tegan. We protect family and family is not just beyond this team. It\u2019s everyone that this team holds dear. So let\u2019s work the case and find this son of a bitch.\u201d Voight looked amongst the group and they nodded their heads in approval.</p><p>The Intelligence Team just hoped they found this person before Jay did. Lord knows, he would probably do something he couldn\u2019t come back from. That would be the worst case scenario and Hank Voight would be damned if that would happen. It was his job to protect his team.</p><hr><p><b>Chicago Med</b><br/></p><p>Tegan felt her body going in and out of consciousness with voices coming and going. All she sensed was Jay\u2019s presence. Being in his arms and hold her close to him. Then there was the pain. The constant pain that radiated in her leg. Then it hit her, she was shot. It all came back to her like waves in and out. Dragging herself to the closet in the freezing cold room with her leg. Just the pain. The feeling that Jay wasn\u2019t there to protect her. But he found her and saved her.</p><p>Will Halstead was waiting by the ambulance bay for Tegan Mitchell. The girl that seemed to have captured Jay\u2019s heart. He would be damned if he didn\u2019t do everything in his power to save Tegan. He remembered the first day Jay met Tegan. He was all shy and wasn\u2019t sure if he should even talk to her. That look his brother gave him. A small smile came on his face as it appeared in his face.</p><p>Just like that the ambulance appeared and pulled up with Sylvie and Emily pulling the gurney. \u201cA 25-year-old woman, shot in the leg and drop in body temperature. We have given her IV warm saline and applied fresh dressings.\u201d Sylvie gave Will as many details as she could as they brought her into the room.</p><p>\u201cOn my count\u20261\u20262\u20263\u2026\u201d They transferred Tegan over to the hospital bed but both of them turned around to face Will.</p><p>\u201cJay will be here soon and doesn\u2019t look very happy. Keep us updated Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you both,\u201d Will said as he looked over at them. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a CBC, CMP, X-rays, warm saline and blankets for the hypothermia. Also, call surgery consultation as well.\u201d Will gave instructions towards the nurse who nodded and went to work. Will took a few notes down and that\u2019s when he saw his brother Jay enter the room.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Jay looked over at Tegan who was still unconscious in the bed. His heart sank as he watched them work on her. He went over towards Tegan and held her hand into his. His eyes just focused on her, not even meeting his brother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe are running tests, going to take an X-Ray as well as a consult. Don\u2019t worry Jay. She is in good hands. Does she have any family that needs to be called.\u201d Will asked as he placed his hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder. Will was watching his brother closely as his eyes remained on her.</p><p>Of course, they had their issues especially with them losing there father six months ago. He couldn\u2019t imagine what was going on his head right now. Especially with someone who he had feelings for. Lord knows if something happened to Natalie, he would lose it. He basically risked his life to keep her safe and protect her.</p><p>\u201cShe has a cousin. I am not sure of her cousin\u2019s number. Let me call Voight and see if Tegan\u2019s phone is there. Do whatever you can for her Will. I cannot lose her.\u201d Jay looked at his brother with seriousness. Will did the unthinkable thing and pulled his brother into a hug. It took everything in that moment for Jay not to break down and cry. He was falling hard for Tegan and maybe even in love with her. They had only been dating a few weeks but those feelings were all too real for him.</p><p>Just then Antonio came over towards Jay who had a concerned look on his face as well. \u201cHow is she?\u201d Jay got up and met Antonio outside her door.</p><p>\u201cThey are running tests and going to do an X-ray. From the looks of it, she seems stable. I know they are trying to warm her up. It\u2019s all too much. First, my dad and now Tegan, Antonio, I don\u2019t know if I can handle this. I don\u2019t even know her cousin\u2019s phone number.\u201d Jay groaned as he took his hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back inside and be with her. I will call the team and see if we can get her cousin\u2019s number. Do you know where she works or anything?\u201d Antonio asked looking at his friend and colleague. Jay was so normally headstrong and could think straight but this was a different side of him Antonio had never seen before. He looked -<b> lost.</b></p><p>\u201cI know her cousin\u2019s boyfriend Chris works at the college Tegan goes to. He is a history professor.\u201d Jay answered just looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the college? I will call and see if I can get a hold of him. His name is Chris right?\u201d Jay nodded in agreement not even finding the words to say.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Chris Evans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo be with Tegan and I will take care of it okay?\u201d Antonio said as he placed a hand on Jay\u2019s shoulder. Jay stood up and went over towards Tegan\u2019s bedside.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Antonio.\u201d His words were simple and true. Jay was just glad that there was someone here to help him through this. With that, Antonio went to work on finding Tegan\u2019s family.</p><p>Jay pulled up a chair and took Tegan\u2019s hand into his. Tegan\u2019s hand always fitted so perfectly into his hand. The feeling of her soft skin brought some sort of peace to him as his thumb stroked her inner hand. Jay rested his head alongside of her hand and finally let go. Tears filled his eyes as he finally let go. </p><p><i>\u201cTegan baby, hold on and be strong for me.\u201d</i> Jay closed his eyes and prayed that Tegan would be okay.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>TAGLIST: </b>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc2i1VDavwHiG3zjhY58fw\">@moonriv-er</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a> </p>",

It had been a long day at work and the case they were working on was horrible. The cold beer was the only thing taking his mind off the horrors he had witnessed. That was until the door opened and she walked into the bar.</i></p><p><i>Lord was she beautiful. The air in his lungs all seemed to leave him and the world slowly started to fade away. She was the only thing that he was focused on. Right then and there.</i></p><p><i>He watched as her eyes scanned around the bar as if she was looking for someone. Maybe she was meeting someone? A boyfriend? He was definitely curious about her. The corner of his eye, he could see his brother and coworker just watching him closely as his eyes were focused on this beautiful woman who walked into the bar.<b> Into his life.</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cJust go talk to her\u201d He felt his brother nudge him, trying to get him to move. He tried several times but he was just spellbound.</i></p><p><i>His eyes followed her every move as she took a seat near the end of the bar. Christopher had come over to take her order and placed it in front of her. That\u2019s when he noticed it - <b>her smile.</b> The minute Jay saw her smile was the moment he needed to go talk to this girl.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDude, just go talk to the girl. What do you have to lose?\u201d Antonio smirked over at his friend who looked like a lovesick puppy. His eyes were strictly focused on the girl.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on Jay. Show us those moves all the girls love.\u201d Will took a sip and hid that smirk behind the glass bottle. Will swore Jay was about to rip his head off just for the teasing. This was a completely different side of him that he had never seen before.</i></p><p><i>Taking a big swig of beer, he got up out of his seat and slowly made his way over towards her. The beating of his heart could be felt against his chest the closer Jay got. The feeling of the sweat on his hands and forehead were starting to form. Jay noticed her beauty the closer he got to her. How her light brown hair shined in the bar lighting, her lip piercing and combat boots. Her knee was bouncing up and down as a nervous tic. Her short frame perfectly right in front of him. Her attention was turned to the tv to whatever sport that was currently on.</i></p><p>The events of how they met played in his head. The exact conversation - the first words he spoke to her.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI think you\u2019re the only person in here not drinking a beer or some sort of liquor.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>She had turned around to look at him with her eyebrow cocked and the most confused look. Her focus was now eyeing him up and down. Like he had stepped into her personal space or maybe she just wasn\u2019t use to someone hitting on her. Who was he kidding - she probably had a boyfriend and was waiting for him.</i></p><p>Her first words echoed in his head caused a small chuckle from his lips. <i><b>\u201cI am waiting for someone\u201d</b></i>\u2026.. <i>Her eyes were dead focused on him</i>\u2026.<i><b>\u201cBesides beer is nasty.\u201d</b></i></p><p>A small smile came on his face as he heard Tegan\u2019s words in his head. Her sweet, soft voice that brought peace to his mind. The fact she was waiting for her friends and there was no boyfriend. He was able to talk to Tegan and not worry about that. That she actually let him sit with her and enjoyed her company.</p><p>From then on, the conversation just seemed to flow. How they spent 30 minutes talking and laughing. How Daphne came over and was being the protective cousin. Tegan decided to stay with him and just talk. He couldn\u2019t help but feel excited and instantly wanted to ask her out on a date. They both spent most of the night texting each other. The next morning was spent drinking lots of coffee but it was totally worth it. Jay Halstead was completely swept away. Most people would think he was crazy considering they had only been dating about 2 weeks but it didn\u2019t change how he felt inside. Those were the real feelings that he felt. That Tegan felt.</p><p>How they both spent all day talking in the park. They could just open up to each other and just be themselves. The feeling of her lips pressed against his as they kissed on the Farris Wheel. The moment they fell asleep on the couch in each other\u2019s arms. He honestly didn\u2019t want to leave her that day. The one thing that remained in his head was\u2026<b>Her smile.</b></p><p>The same smile she always gave him, the same one that made his heart raced the first night they met. That was the greatest night of his life and he wasn\u2019t about to let anyone or thing take her away from him. The only way he was going to let her go was if she didn\u2019t want to be with him anymore. That she didn\u2019t have any feelings for him but even then he would still fight for her.</p><p>The moment Antonio called him and mentioned Tegan\u2019s apartment, his heart nearly dropped to the bottom of his chest. He knew that something was going to happen at that apartment complex. It was run down and just from the looks of it, the people were somewhat sketchy. His girl was completely in the middle of that and he would be damned if Tegan would be there any longer.</p><p>The siren blared through the streets signaling that there was an emergency. The snow was slowly falling down as there was a winter storm coming. It seemed like nothing was on his side as every street light had turned red but it didn\u2019t matter. He drove through the lights like nothing else. The foot was hitting hard on the gas as he drove. His heart hammering out his chest as he drove.</p><p>Jay just prayed that Tegan was safe. That he could pull her into his arms and kiss her. God help that the person that was at fault for this. The rage could be felt in his arms and hands gripping the steering wheel as he drove. He promised Tegan he would do everything in order to protect her. Jay wasn\u2019t about to break his promise to her.</p><p>Taking a sharp turn down her street, he could see the police lights as well as several ambulances. This sending Jay into overdrive as he witnessed it. Putting the car in park, Jay grabbed his gun, placed it in his holster and hopped out of the car. His legs taking over as he quickly walked near her apartment complex. It looked like most of his team was already here and his boss Hank Voight was talking to some cops over in the corner. Antonio could see the look on Jay\u2019s face as he came closer to the team.</p><p>\u201cJay stop! Voight has ordered us to stand down for the moment.\u201d The sinking feeling in Jay\u2019s heart just took over as he was ordered to stop. Then it quickly turned to anger as he was being denied access to the apartment complex.</p><p>\u201cTHAT\u2019S MY GIRLFRIEND, Antonio! I am not going to sit here and wait. I am going to go in and get her!\u201d Jay tried to push forward but his coworker Kevin and Adam quickly backed up Antonio. He desperately did his best to try and move forward but it was no use as several other cops came forward blocking Jay from getting in.</p><p>\u201cI understand that Jay, but right now we don\u2019t have all the details before we go in. I know you want to go in there, but let Voight come back and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d Antonio was doing his best to reason with Jay but he could see the fire in his friend\u2019s eyes. It was that same fire that he, himself had when his son was kidnapped when his daughter was kidnapped. They had to remain level headed and smart or more damage could possibly be done.</p><p>Just then Voight had come over towards the group with a serious look on his face. Jay was starting to get antsy as things weren\u2019t progressing the way he wanted to. Every waking minute just seemed to be never-ending. That he was stuck in a nightmare and couldn\u2019t get out of it. Who knows if Tegan was hurt and bleeding. She was probably scared and calling out for him. This was basically killing him inside.</p><p>\u201cHank, I am going in there whether you all like it or not. My girlfriend is in that building.\u201d Jay was doing his best to plead with his boss. It didn\u2019t even seem like it was working as Voight shock his head no.</p><p>\u201cJay, I understand that we are working on a plan at the moment. Please be patient, Jay.\u201d Looking amongst the group as they seemed to be just as nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know so far?\u201d Adam was the first one to ask the question that needed to be answered. If they truly knew what was going on, a plan could be made and Jay could get to Tegan faster.</p><p>\u201cAll we know is that there was an argument on the 5th floor which caused some shots were fired. Several neighbors called the cops, but when they arrived, there seemed to be gunfire towards the cops. We don\u2019t have any information on any of the neighbors. That\u2019s the reason why we aren\u2019t going in. If they are being held hostage, we don\u2019t want to risk causalities.\u201d Voight explained but it still didn\u2019t bring any ease to Jay\u2019s mind. It actually brought even worse thoughts to his mind.</p><p>\u201cHow do YOU expect to get any information on the neighbors if no one can get inside?\u201d Jay\u2019s voice was on the verge of shouting as his team looked at him. Concern was written all over there faces. This was HIS girl they were talking about after all.</p><p>\u201cJay, I understand that and do you think I want anyone injured as well? I want to do this in a civil controlled manner. But I will not risk it because you want to go half cocked. Now we will do this when we have all the details. If you don\u2019t want to help or cannot calm down - I will bench you.\u201d Jay just stared at Voight as he spoke. Both trying to come to some sort of understand as he looked at his boss.</p><p>Just then shots were fired\u2026Almost instantly everyone took off towards the apartment. Jay\u2019s legs never took off faster as he ran inside\u2026..</p><hr><p>Tegan wrapped the covers around her body tightly. It was a lot colder than she had originally anticipated it being or maybe it was the pure fact the heater and ac weren\u2019t working. That fucking landlord couldn\u2019t fix anything in this damn place. There was nothing that could be done right now as she wrapped it closer to her body. All she wanted was to be warm and be wrapped in Jay\u2019s strong arms.<br></p><p>The past few nights, dreams of him had entered her brain. Most of them being erotic and some romantic. Jay had entered her life when she least expected it. The moment he walked up to her and flashed that pretty boy smile. She was completely swept away. Jay was everything she wanted in a man. Funny, smart, romantic and muscular as hell. His strong arms and the way his jeans fitted his body.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deny that she was falling for him.<b> Hard. </b>He was constantly on her mind and in her dreams. Yes, her heart was still guarded but it felt like Jay was something more. But could that even be possible? They were only dating for two weeks. Of course, they were taking it slow, but she couldn\u2019t deny there was something more between them. She would just have to follow her heart to see where it led.</p><p>She struggled to go to sleep but it was no use. Between the cold weather and loud arguing at 4:30 am. Ugh. Do any of these people ever sleep? Throwing the covers over her head, she groaned loudly. All she wanted to do was sleep. That\u2019s when she heard the loud banging against her kitchen wall. Placing her feet on the cold ground, she started to walk over towards the kitchen to knock on the wall. Before she made it to the kitchen, several cracks of pops came off.</p><p>It was gunfire. Her heart started to race as she heard it and backed away from the wall. That\u2019s when she felt a sharp pain hit her leg causing her to fall down. Looking down, she noticed it started to bleed. Tegan tried to get up but it was no use as she fell to the ground instantly. The pain in her leg started to radiate all the way up. Dragging her body towards her bedroom, she needed to find somewhere to lay low. To hideaway. Who knows if they were going to come back or what was going to happen next.</p><p>The blood could be seen on the ground as she dragged herself towards the closet. That\u2019s when Tegan grabbed one of the shirts on her chair, nearest to her, to wrap it around her leg. Tears started to whelm in her eyes as pulled it tight against her skin. What was she going to do? She needed to find safety and quickly. Her closet.</p><p>Tegan did her best to limp towards the closet. Luckily, there was only a small amount of blood that was dragged but there was a decent size puddle where she fell to the ground. She couldn\u2019t worry about that right now. She just prayed that Jay wound find her. That he would save her. \u201cShit, my phone is on the other side of the room\u201d realizing she couldn\u2019t call Jay.</p><p>There was no point in getting the phone right now. She didn\u2019t know what was going to happen and didn\u2019t want to risk it. Closing the door behind her, Tegan found a blanket and wrapped it around her body. Everything seemed to fade just a bit as she felt dizzy. Or maybe it was the fact she could be dying? No! She wasn\u2019t going to die here. <b>Not today</b>. Jay would come and save her. Tegan had to believe that.</p><p>Doing her best to stay awake, she wrapped the blanket tightly around her body. That\u2019s when she heard another set of gunfire go off. Getting up slowly, she made her way to the very back of the closet. Behind all the boxes that were still in there and the clothes that hung up. Honestly, it was pretty warm back there despite the heater not even working.</p><p><i><b>\u201cJay, please save me.\u201d</b></i> Her voice was just above a whisper and tears started to stream down her face as she spoke to the empty room. All she wanted was for him to find her and hopefully, that would be soon.</p><p>Her own body started to feel weak as the cold was now starting to hit her. Or maybe it was the lack of sleep or even blood loss from her leg. Tegan felt her eyes slowly start to close and her body fall to the ground as darkness took over.</p><hr><p>Voight had led the charge into the apartment complex, followed by several officers and SWAT. Knocking could be heard on the lower floors as a means to check on the neighbors. That wasn\u2019t Jay\u2019s top priority. His mind was only on Tegan and making sure she was safe.<br></p><p>Jay had his gun drawn to his side as they came up the stairs. The closer he got to her door, the more his heart started to race. It was as if tunnel vision took over. Her door was strictly in sight now - <b>5D</b>. Other footsteps were behind him as well following him towards the 5th floor. Antonio was close behind him knowing exactly what his mindset was on.</p><p>Jay watched as Voight, Adam, and Kevin all went towards the other doors on the left side of Tegan\u2019s door and Kim and Hailey followed towards the right side. No one had a clue as to which apartment on the fifth floor it came from. It was pretty much a guessing game at this point. The game had completely changed now as they entered the other apartments.</p><p>With his gun pointed at the door, Jay nodded at Antonio to bust the door open. It was completely easy after all being a crappy apartment after all. The moment they entered the apartment, a strong blast of cold air had whipped past them.</p><p>\u201cShit! It\u2019s freezing in here.\u201d Antonio whispered. Jay had to admit her apartment was freezing as he saw his own breath out of his mouth. He was now in overdrive as time seemed to be of the essence. He had to find her. \u201cJay, over here!\u201d Antonio shouted as he looked down at the ground and found a pool of blood on the ground.</p><p><i>\u201cFuck!\u201d</i> Jay muttered turning his head to look around the room. Her bed was completely empty except the bear he got her from the Pier. The fact that Tegan had it closer to her when she slept meant a lot to him. Placing it back on the bed, he turned around and noticed there weren\u2019t very many places to hide in a one bedroom apartment. Jay got down on the ground to check under the bed. <b>Nothing.</b> Antonio looked in the bathroom and turned right back around.</p><p>There was nothing in either place except the coldness of the room. Whoever owned this apartment complex was about to have a very bad day. It was one thing to neglect the upkeep of the apartment, it was a completely another thing not to have the air and heat properly working.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know where she could be. We have checked under the bed and the bathroom. The living room is clear as well.\u201d Antonio mentioned. Jay turned around and saw her closet. Turning the handle, Antonio flashed his flashlight into the closet. It was filled with most of her clothes and several boxes.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me see,\u201d Jay whispered as he took the flashlight from his coworker. He proceeded further into the closet and looked past the boxes that were near the back. \u201cTake this.\u201d Jay handed back the flashlight to Antonio and his heart raced as he saw Tegan laying with a blanket wrapped around her. It was a small blanket, to say the least.</p><p>\u201cTegan, baby, I am here. Please wake up.\u201d Jay\u2019s voice cracked just a bit as he spoke. He was practically pleading but there was no response from her.</p><p>His fingers went towards her neck in a means to check her pulse. \u201cShe\u2019s alive but it\u2019s a weak pulse. We need the ambo here now.\u201d That\u2019s when Jay noticed her leg and the blood-soaked shirt around her leg. \u201cShit! She\u2019s been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCivilian shot, we need an ambo now!\u201d Antonio\u2019s voice was filled with worry as Jay picked up an unconscious Tegan in his arms. Doing his best not to break down, Jay placed Tegan on the ground and took her blanket off the bed to wrap her. Tegan\u2019s lips were blue, her body was completely freezing and her pulse was weak. He could tell from the blood on the ground, Tegan had lost a decent amount of blood.</p><p>Just then Voight and Adam walked in the room. There was no expression on Jay\u2019s face as Tegan\u2019s head was placed in his lap. Just then Voight keyed his radio up.</p><p>\u201cAmbo 51, we need you here now! We have a civilian shot in the leg and she is unconscious.\u201d There was anger in Voight\u2019s voice.</p><p><i>\u201cWe are coming up now.\u201d</i></p><p>Just then paramedics Sylvie Brett and Emily Foster entered the room right past Voight and Adam. Both of them noticed Tegan wrapped in the blanket and the blood was seeping through her blanket. Honestly, they feared Jay at that moment with Tegan in his lap. It was like they never saw this side of Jay as his facial expression was completely blank except the fire behind his eyes. Almost as if he was going to lose it right then and there.</p><p>\u201cJay, let us take care of her. Don\u2019t worry, we will take care of her. If she has any family, I suggest you call them and let them know.\u201d Sylvie placed her hand on Jay\u2019s back in reassurance. It did no good. Nothing was going to reassure Jay until she was out of danger.</p><p>\u201cWe are taking her to Med. I will let your brother know okay?\u201d Emily was quick to reassure Jay as well. But all Jay could do was look at Tegan being wheeled out in a gurney. The fact he couldn\u2019t save her from this. That he should have listened to his gut when he felt like something was wrong. He should have brought her back to his apartment last night.</p><p>Looking down at the floor, he saw the blood that was now being tracked out of the apartment. It was HER blood. That\u2019s when he felt a hand being placed on his back. \u201cWe will find the son of a bitch who did this and make him pay.\u201d</p><p>Jay just pushed the hand off his back and turned around to look at Voight, Antonio, and Adam. Just then Kevin, Hailey, and Kim entered the apartment as well, unsure of what had just happened \u201cYou better be sure we are going to find this son of a bitch and he\u2019s going to get what\u2019s coming to him. He hurt Tegan and now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d With that Jay left his teammates behind.</p><p>\u201cAntonio, keep an eye on him. When we have more information, I will let you know. Right now we have to figure out what went on here.\u201d Voight turned his attention towards Antonio. \u201cLet me know if he does anything rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you once we get to Med.\u201d Antonio quickly left and to catch up to Jay. Deep down, he had a sinking feeling once Jay got ahold of the person, it wasn\u2019t going to end well. Voight just hoped that he could get to Jay before he did something stupid.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know this hits to close to home for Jay. For now, we work the case like we always do. Follow the leads and interview everyone. We will only tell Jay if we have to. For right now his attention needs to be on Tegan. We protect family and family is not just beyond this team. It\u2019s everyone that this team holds dear. So let\u2019s work the case and find this son of a bitch.\u201d Voight looked amongst the group and they nodded their heads in approval.</p><p>The Intelligence Team just hoped they found this person before Jay did. Lord knows, he would probably do something he couldn\u2019t come back from. That would be the worst case scenario and Hank Voight would be damned if that would happen. It was his job to protect his team.</p><hr><p><b>Chicago Med</b><br></p><p>Tegan felt her body going in and out of consciousness with voices coming and going. All she sensed was Jay\u2019s presence. Being in his arms and hold her close to him. Then there was the pain. The constant pain that radiated in her leg. Then it hit her, she was shot. It all came back to her like waves in and out. Dragging herself to the closet in the freezing cold room with her leg. Just the pain. The feeling that Jay wasn\u2019t there to protect her. But he found her and saved her.</p><p>Will Halstead was waiting by the ambulance bay for Tegan Mitchell. The girl that seemed to have captured Jay\u2019s heart. He would be damned if he didn\u2019t do everything in his power to save Tegan. He remembered the first day Jay met Tegan. He was all shy and wasn\u2019t sure if he should even talk to her. That look his brother gave him. A small smile came on his face as it appeared in his face.</p><p>Just like that the ambulance appeared and pulled up with Sylvie and Emily pulling the gurney. \u201cA 25-year-old woman, shot in the leg and drop in body temperature. We have given her IV warm saline and applied fresh dressings.\u201d Sylvie gave Will as many details as she could as they brought her into the room.</p><p>\u201cOn my count\u20261\u20262\u20263\u2026\u201d They transferred Tegan over to the hospital bed but both of them turned around to face Will.</p><p>\u201cJay will be here soon and doesn\u2019t look very happy. Keep us updated Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you both,\u201d Will said as he looked over at them. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a CBC, CMP, X-rays, warm saline and blankets for the hypothermia. Also, call surgery consultation as well.\u201d Will gave instructions towards the nurse who nodded and went to work. Will took a few notes down and that\u2019s when he saw his brother Jay enter the room.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Jay looked over at Tegan who was still unconscious in the bed. His heart sank as he watched them work on her. He went over towards Tegan and held her hand into his. His eyes just focused on her, not even meeting his brother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe are running tests, going to take an X-Ray as well as a consult. Don\u2019t worry Jay. She is in good hands. Does she have any family that needs to be called.\u201d Will asked as he placed his hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder. Will was watching his brother closely as his eyes remained on her.</p><p>Of course, they had their issues especially with them losing there father six months ago. He couldn\u2019t imagine what was going on his head right now. Especially with someone who he had feelings for. Lord knows if something happened to Natalie, he would lose it. He basically risked his life to keep her safe and protect her.</p><p>\u201cShe has a cousin. I am not sure of her cousin\u2019s number. Let me call Voight and see if Tegan\u2019s phone is there. Do whatever you can for her Will. I cannot lose her.\u201d Jay looked at his brother with seriousness. Will did the unthinkable thing and pulled his brother into a hug. It took everything in that moment for Jay not to break down and cry. He was falling hard for Tegan and maybe even in love with her. They had only been dating a few weeks but those feelings were all too real for him.</p><p>Just then Antonio came over towards Jay who had a concerned look on his face as well. \u201cHow is she?\u201d Jay got up and met Antonio outside her door.</p><p>\u201cThey are running tests and going to do an X-ray. From the looks of it, she seems stable. I know they are trying to warm her up. It\u2019s all too much. First, my dad and now Tegan, Antonio, I don\u2019t know if I can handle this. I don\u2019t even know her cousin\u2019s phone number.\u201d Jay groaned as he took his hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back inside and be with her. I will call the team and see if we can get her cousin\u2019s number. Do you know where she works or anything?\u201d Antonio asked looking at his friend and colleague. Jay was so normally headstrong and could think straight but this was a different side of him Antonio had never seen before. He looked -<b> lost.</b></p><p>\u201cI know her cousin\u2019s boyfriend Chris works at the college Tegan goes to. He is a history professor.\u201d Jay answered just looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the college? I will call and see if I can get a hold of him. His name is Chris right?\u201d Jay nodded in agreement not even finding the words to say.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Chris Evans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo be with Tegan and I will take care of it okay?\u201d Antonio said as he placed a hand on Jay\u2019s shoulder. Jay stood up and went over towards Tegan\u2019s bedside.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Antonio.\u201d His words were simple and true. Jay was just glad that there was someone here to help him through this. With that, Antonio went to work on finding Tegan\u2019s family.</p><p>Jay pulled up a chair and took Tegan\u2019s hand into his. Tegan\u2019s hand always fitted so perfectly into his hand. The feeling of her soft skin brought some sort of peace to him as his thumb stroked her inner hand. Jay rested his head alongside of her hand and finally let go. Tears filled his eyes as he finally let go. </p><p><i>\u201cTegan baby, hold on and be strong for me.\u201d</i> Jay closed his eyes and prayed that Tegan would be okay.</p><p><br></p><p><b>TAGLIST: </b>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc2i1VDavwHiG3zjhY58fw\">@moonriv-er</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a> </p>",

It had been a long day at work and the case they were working on was horrible. The cold beer was the only thing taking his mind off the horrors he had witnessed. That was until the door opened and she walked into the bar.</i></p><p><i>Lord was she beautiful. The air in his lungs all seemed to leave him and the world slowly started to fade away. She was the only thing that he was focused on. Right then and there.</i></p><p><i>He watched as her eyes scanned around the bar as if she was looking for someone. Maybe she was meeting someone? A boyfriend? He was definitely curious about her. The corner of his eye, he could see his brother and coworker just watching him closely as his eyes were focused on this beautiful woman who walked into the bar.<b> Into his life.</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cJust go talk to her\u201d He felt his brother nudge him, trying to get him to move. He tried several times but he was just spellbound.</i></p><p><i>His eyes followed her every move as she took a seat near the end of the bar. Christopher had come over to take her order and placed it in front of her. That\u2019s when he noticed it - <b>her smile.</b> The minute Jay saw her smile was the moment he needed to go talk to this girl.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDude, just go talk to the girl. What do you have to lose?\u201d Antonio smirked over at his friend who looked like a lovesick puppy. His eyes were strictly focused on the girl.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on Jay. Show us those moves all the girls love.\u201d Will took a sip and hid that smirk behind the glass bottle. Will swore Jay was about to rip his head off just for the teasing. This was a completely different side of him that he had never seen before.</i></p><p><i>Taking a big swig of beer, he got up out of his seat and slowly made his way over towards her. The beating of his heart could be felt against his chest the closer Jay got. The feeling of the sweat on his hands and forehead were starting to form. Jay noticed her beauty the closer he got to her. How her light brown hair shined in the bar lighting, her lip piercing and combat boots. Her knee was bouncing up and down as a nervous tic. Her short frame perfectly right in front of him. Her attention was turned to the tv to whatever sport that was currently on.</i></p><p>The events of how they met played in his head. The exact conversation - the first words he spoke to her.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI think you\u2019re the only person in here not drinking a beer or some sort of liquor.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>She had turned around to look at him with her eyebrow cocked and the most confused look. Her focus was now eyeing him up and down. Like he had stepped into her personal space or maybe she just wasn\u2019t use to someone hitting on her. Who was he kidding - she probably had a boyfriend and was waiting for him.</i></p><p>Her first words echoed in his head caused a small chuckle from his lips. <i><b>\u201cI am waiting for someone\u201d</b></i>\u2026.. <i>Her eyes were dead focused on him</i>\u2026.<i><b>\u201cBesides beer is nasty.\u201d</b></i></p><p>A small smile came on his face as he heard Tegan\u2019s words in his head. Her sweet, soft voice that brought peace to his mind. The fact she was waiting for her friends and there was no boyfriend. He was able to talk to Tegan and not worry about that. That she actually let him sit with her and enjoyed her company.</p><p>From then on, the conversation just seemed to flow. How they spent 30 minutes talking and laughing. How Daphne came over and was being the protective cousin. Tegan decided to stay with him and just talk. He couldn\u2019t help but feel excited and instantly wanted to ask her out on a date. They both spent most of the night texting each other. The next morning was spent drinking lots of coffee but it was totally worth it. Jay Halstead was completely swept away. Most people would think he was crazy considering they had only been dating about 2 weeks but it didn\u2019t change how he felt inside. Those were the real feelings that he felt. That Tegan felt.</p><p>How they both spent all day talking in the park. They could just open up to each other and just be themselves. The feeling of her lips pressed against his as they kissed on the Farris Wheel. The moment they fell asleep on the couch in each other\u2019s arms. He honestly didn\u2019t want to leave her that day. The one thing that remained in his head was\u2026<b>Her smile.</b></p><p>The same smile she always gave him, the same one that made his heart raced the first night they met. That was the greatest night of his life and he wasn\u2019t about to let anyone or thing take her away from him. The only way he was going to let her go was if she didn\u2019t want to be with him anymore. That she didn\u2019t have any feelings for him but even then he would still fight for her.</p><p>The moment Antonio called him and mentioned Tegan\u2019s apartment, his heart nearly dropped to the bottom of his chest. He knew that something was going to happen at that apartment complex. It was run down and just from the looks of it, the people were somewhat sketchy. His girl was completely in the middle of that and he would be damned if Tegan would be there any longer.</p><p>The siren blared through the streets signaling that there was an emergency. The snow was slowly falling down as there was a winter storm coming. It seemed like nothing was on his side as every street light had turned red but it didn\u2019t matter. He drove through the lights like nothing else. The foot was hitting hard on the gas as he drove. His heart hammering out his chest as he drove.</p><p>Jay just prayed that Tegan was safe. That he could pull her into his arms and kiss her. God help that the person that was at fault for this. The rage could be felt in his arms and hands gripping the steering wheel as he drove. He promised Tegan he would do everything in order to protect her. Jay wasn\u2019t about to break his promise to her.</p><p>Taking a sharp turn down her street, he could see the police lights as well as several ambulances. This sending Jay into overdrive as he witnessed it. Putting the car in park, Jay grabbed his gun, placed it in his holster and hopped out of the car. His legs taking over as he quickly walked near her apartment complex. It looked like most of his team was already here and his boss Hank Voight was talking to some cops over in the corner. Antonio could see the look on Jay\u2019s face as he came closer to the team.</p><p>\u201cJay stop! Voight has ordered us to stand down for the moment.\u201d The sinking feeling in Jay\u2019s heart just took over as he was ordered to stop. Then it quickly turned to anger as he was being denied access to the apartment complex.</p><p>\u201cTHAT\u2019S MY GIRLFRIEND, Antonio! I am not going to sit here and wait. I am going to go in and get her!\u201d Jay tried to push forward but his coworker Kevin and Adam quickly backed up Antonio. He desperately did his best to try and move forward but it was no use as several other cops came forward blocking Jay from getting in.</p><p>\u201cI understand that Jay, but right now we don\u2019t have all the details before we go in. I know you want to go in there, but let Voight come back and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d Antonio was doing his best to reason with Jay but he could see the fire in his friend\u2019s eyes. It was that same fire that he, himself had when his son was kidnapped when his daughter was kidnapped. They had to remain level headed and smart or more damage could possibly be done.</p><p>Just then Voight had come over towards the group with a serious look on his face. Jay was starting to get antsy as things weren\u2019t progressing the way he wanted to. Every waking minute just seemed to be never-ending. That he was stuck in a nightmare and couldn\u2019t get out of it. Who knows if Tegan was hurt and bleeding. She was probably scared and calling out for him. This was basically killing him inside.</p><p>\u201cHank, I am going in there whether you all like it or not. My girlfriend is in that building.\u201d Jay was doing his best to plead with his boss. It didn\u2019t even seem like it was working as Voight shock his head no.</p><p>\u201cJay, I understand that we are working on a plan at the moment. Please be patient, Jay.\u201d Looking amongst the group as they seemed to be just as nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know so far?\u201d Adam was the first one to ask the question that needed to be answered. If they truly knew what was going on, a plan could be made and Jay could get to Tegan faster.</p><p>\u201cAll we know is that there was an argument on the 5th floor which caused some shots were fired. Several neighbors called the cops, but when they arrived, there seemed to be gunfire towards the cops. We don\u2019t have any information on any of the neighbors. That\u2019s the reason why we aren\u2019t going in. If they are being held hostage, we don\u2019t want to risk causalities.\u201d Voight explained but it still didn\u2019t bring any ease to Jay\u2019s mind. It actually brought even worse thoughts to his mind.</p><p>\u201cHow do YOU expect to get any information on the neighbors if no one can get inside?\u201d Jay\u2019s voice was on the verge of shouting as his team looked at him. Concern was written all over there faces. This was HIS girl they were talking about after all.</p><p>\u201cJay, I understand that and do you think I want anyone injured as well? I want to do this in a civil controlled manner. But I will not risk it because you want to go half cocked. Now we will do this when we have all the details. If you don\u2019t want to help or cannot calm down - I will bench you.\u201d Jay just stared at Voight as he spoke. Both trying to come to some sort of understand as he looked at his boss.</p><p>Just then shots were fired\u2026Almost instantly everyone took off towards the apartment. Jay\u2019s legs never took off faster as he ran inside\u2026..</p><hr><p>Tegan wrapped the covers around her body tightly. It was a lot colder than she had originally anticipated it being or maybe it was the pure fact the heater and ac weren\u2019t working. That fucking landlord couldn\u2019t fix anything in this damn place. There was nothing that could be done right now as she wrapped it closer to her body. All she wanted was to be warm and be wrapped in Jay\u2019s strong arms.<br></p><p>The past few nights, dreams of him had entered her brain. Most of them being erotic and some romantic. Jay had entered her life when she least expected it. The moment he walked up to her and flashed that pretty boy smile. She was completely swept away. Jay was everything she wanted in a man. Funny, smart, romantic and muscular as hell. His strong arms and the way his jeans fitted his body.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deny that she was falling for him.<b> Hard. </b>He was constantly on her mind and in her dreams. Yes, her heart was still guarded but it felt like Jay was something more. But could that even be possible? They were only dating for two weeks. Of course, they were taking it slow, but she couldn\u2019t deny there was something more between them. She would just have to follow her heart to see where it led.</p><p>She struggled to go to sleep but it was no use. Between the cold weather and loud arguing at 4:30 am. Ugh. Do any of these people ever sleep? Throwing the covers over her head, she groaned loudly. All she wanted to do was sleep. That\u2019s when she heard the loud banging against her kitchen wall. Placing her feet on the cold ground, she started to walk over towards the kitchen to knock on the wall. Before she made it to the kitchen, several cracks of pops came off.</p><p>It was gunfire. Her heart started to race as she heard it and backed away from the wall. That\u2019s when she felt a sharp pain hit her leg causing her to fall down. Looking down, she noticed it started to bleed. Tegan tried to get up but it was no use as she fell to the ground instantly. The pain in her leg started to radiate all the way up. Dragging her body towards her bedroom, she needed to find somewhere to lay low. To hideaway. Who knows if they were going to come back or what was going to happen next.</p><p>The blood could be seen on the ground as she dragged herself towards the closet. That\u2019s when Tegan grabbed one of the shirts on her chair, nearest to her, to wrap it around her leg. Tears started to whelm in her eyes as pulled it tight against her skin. What was she going to do? She needed to find safety and quickly. Her closet.</p><p>Tegan did her best to limp towards the closet. Luckily, there was only a small amount of blood that was dragged but there was a decent size puddle where she fell to the ground. She couldn\u2019t worry about that right now. She just prayed that Jay wound find her. That he would save her. \u201cShit, my phone is on the other side of the room\u201d realizing she couldn\u2019t call Jay.</p><p>There was no point in getting the phone right now. She didn\u2019t know what was going to happen and didn\u2019t want to risk it. Closing the door behind her, Tegan found a blanket and wrapped it around her body. Everything seemed to fade just a bit as she felt dizzy. Or maybe it was the fact she could be dying? No! She wasn\u2019t going to die here. <b>Not today</b>. Jay would come and save her. Tegan had to believe that.</p><p>Doing her best to stay awake, she wrapped the blanket tightly around her body. That\u2019s when she heard another set of gunfire go off. Getting up slowly, she made her way to the very back of the closet. Behind all the boxes that were still in there and the clothes that hung up. Honestly, it was pretty warm back there despite the heater not even working.</p><p><i><b>\u201cJay, please save me.\u201d</b></i> Her voice was just above a whisper and tears started to stream down her face as she spoke to the empty room. All she wanted was for him to find her and hopefully, that would be soon.</p><p>Her own body started to feel weak as the cold was now starting to hit her. Or maybe it was the lack of sleep or even blood loss from her leg. Tegan felt her eyes slowly start to close and her body fall to the ground as darkness took over.</p><hr><p>Voight had led the charge into the apartment complex, followed by several officers and SWAT. Knocking could be heard on the lower floors as a means to check on the neighbors. That wasn\u2019t Jay\u2019s top priority. His mind was only on Tegan and making sure she was safe.<br></p><p>Jay had his gun drawn to his side as they came up the stairs. The closer he got to her door, the more his heart started to race. It was as if tunnel vision took over. Her door was strictly in sight now - <b>5D</b>. Other footsteps were behind him as well following him towards the 5th floor. Antonio was close behind him knowing exactly what his mindset was on.</p><p>Jay watched as Voight, Adam, and Kevin all went towards the other doors on the left side of Tegan\u2019s door and Kim and Hailey followed towards the right side. No one had a clue as to which apartment on the fifth floor it came from. It was pretty much a guessing game at this point. The game had completely changed now as they entered the other apartments.</p><p>With his gun pointed at the door, Jay nodded at Antonio to bust the door open. It was completely easy after all being a crappy apartment after all. The moment they entered the apartment, a strong blast of cold air had whipped past them.</p><p>\u201cShit! It\u2019s freezing in here.\u201d Antonio whispered. Jay had to admit her apartment was freezing as he saw his own breath out of his mouth. He was now in overdrive as time seemed to be of the essence. He had to find her. \u201cJay, over here!\u201d Antonio shouted as he looked down at the ground and found a pool of blood on the ground.</p><p><i>\u201cFuck!\u201d</i> Jay muttered turning his head to look around the room. Her bed was completely empty except the bear he got her from the Pier. The fact that Tegan had it closer to her when she slept meant a lot to him. Placing it back on the bed, he turned around and noticed there weren\u2019t very many places to hide in a one bedroom apartment. Jay got down on the ground to check under the bed. <b>Nothing.</b> Antonio looked in the bathroom and turned right back around.</p><p>There was nothing in either place except the coldness of the room. Whoever owned this apartment complex was about to have a very bad day. It was one thing to neglect the upkeep of the apartment, it was a completely another thing not to have the air and heat properly working.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know where she could be. We have checked under the bed and the bathroom. The living room is clear as well.\u201d Antonio mentioned. Jay turned around and saw her closet. Turning the handle, Antonio flashed his flashlight into the closet. It was filled with most of her clothes and several boxes.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me see,\u201d Jay whispered as he took the flashlight from his coworker. He proceeded further into the closet and looked past the boxes that were near the back. \u201cTake this.\u201d Jay handed back the flashlight to Antonio and his heart raced as he saw Tegan laying with a blanket wrapped around her. It was a small blanket, to say the least.</p><p>\u201cTegan, baby, I am here. Please wake up.\u201d Jay\u2019s voice cracked just a bit as he spoke. He was practically pleading but there was no response from her.</p><p>His fingers went towards her neck in a means to check her pulse. \u201cShe\u2019s alive but it\u2019s a weak pulse. We need the ambo here now.\u201d That\u2019s when Jay noticed her leg and the blood-soaked shirt around her leg. \u201cShit! She\u2019s been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCivilian shot, we need an ambo now!\u201d Antonio\u2019s voice was filled with worry as Jay picked up an unconscious Tegan in his arms. Doing his best not to break down, Jay placed Tegan on the ground and took her blanket off the bed to wrap her. Tegan\u2019s lips were blue, her body was completely freezing and her pulse was weak. He could tell from the blood on the ground, Tegan had lost a decent amount of blood.</p><p>Just then Voight and Adam walked in the room. There was no expression on Jay\u2019s face as Tegan\u2019s head was placed in his lap. Just then Voight keyed his radio up.</p><p>\u201cAmbo 51, we need you here now! We have a civilian shot in the leg and she is unconscious.\u201d There was anger in Voight\u2019s voice.</p><p><i>\u201cWe are coming up now.\u201d</i></p><p>Just then paramedics Sylvie Brett and Emily Foster entered the room right past Voight and Adam. Both of them noticed Tegan wrapped in the blanket and the blood was seeping through her blanket. Honestly, they feared Jay at that moment with Tegan in his lap. It was like they never saw this side of Jay as his facial expression was completely blank except the fire behind his eyes. Almost as if he was going to lose it right then and there.</p><p>\u201cJay, let us take care of her. Don\u2019t worry, we will take care of her. If she has any family, I suggest you call them and let them know.\u201d Sylvie placed her hand on Jay\u2019s back in reassurance. It did no good. Nothing was going to reassure Jay until she was out of danger.</p><p>\u201cWe are taking her to Med. I will let your brother know okay?\u201d Emily was quick to reassure Jay as well. But all Jay could do was look at Tegan being wheeled out in a gurney. The fact he couldn\u2019t save her from this. That he should have listened to his gut when he felt like something was wrong. He should have brought her back to his apartment last night.</p><p>Looking down at the floor, he saw the blood that was now being tracked out of the apartment. It was HER blood. That\u2019s when he felt a hand being placed on his back. \u201cWe will find the son of a bitch who did this and make him pay.\u201d</p><p>Jay just pushed the hand off his back and turned around to look at Voight, Antonio, and Adam. Just then Kevin, Hailey, and Kim entered the apartment as well, unsure of what had just happened \u201cYou better be sure we are going to find this son of a bitch and he\u2019s going to get what\u2019s coming to him. He hurt Tegan and now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d With that Jay left his teammates behind.</p><p>\u201cAntonio, keep an eye on him. When we have more information, I will let you know. Right now we have to figure out what went on here.\u201d Voight turned his attention towards Antonio. \u201cLet me know if he does anything rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you once we get to Med.\u201d Antonio quickly left and to catch up to Jay. Deep down, he had a sinking feeling once Jay got ahold of the person, it wasn\u2019t going to end well. Voight just hoped that he could get to Jay before he did something stupid.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know this hits to close to home for Jay. For now, we work the case like we always do. Follow the leads and interview everyone. We will only tell Jay if we have to. For right now his attention needs to be on Tegan. We protect family and family is not just beyond this team. It\u2019s everyone that this team holds dear. So let\u2019s work the case and find this son of a bitch.\u201d Voight looked amongst the group and they nodded their heads in approval.</p><p>The Intelligence Team just hoped they found this person before Jay did. Lord knows, he would probably do something he couldn\u2019t come back from. That would be the worst case scenario and Hank Voight would be damned if that would happen. It was his job to protect his team.</p><hr><p><b>Chicago Med</b><br></p><p>Tegan felt her body going in and out of consciousness with voices coming and going. All she sensed was Jay\u2019s presence. Being in his arms and hold her close to him. Then there was the pain. The constant pain that radiated in her leg. Then it hit her, she was shot. It all came back to her like waves in and out. Dragging herself to the closet in the freezing cold room with her leg. Just the pain. The feeling that Jay wasn\u2019t there to protect her. But he found her and saved her.</p><p>Will Halstead was waiting by the ambulance bay for Tegan Mitchell. The girl that seemed to have captured Jay\u2019s heart. He would be damned if he didn\u2019t do everything in his power to save Tegan. He remembered the first day Jay met Tegan. He was all shy and wasn\u2019t sure if he should even talk to her. That look his brother gave him. A small smile came on his face as it appeared in his face.</p><p>Just like that the ambulance appeared and pulled up with Sylvie and Emily pulling the gurney. \u201cA 25-year-old woman, shot in the leg and drop in body temperature. We have given her IV warm saline and applied fresh dressings.\u201d Sylvie gave Will as many details as she could as they brought her into the room.</p><p>\u201cOn my count\u20261\u20262\u20263\u2026\u201d They transferred Tegan over to the hospital bed but both of them turned around to face Will.</p><p>\u201cJay will be here soon and doesn\u2019t look very happy. Keep us updated Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you both,\u201d Will said as he looked over at them. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a CBC, CMP, X-rays, warm saline and blankets for the hypothermia. Also, call surgery consultation as well.\u201d Will gave instructions towards the nurse who nodded and went to work. Will took a few notes down and that\u2019s when he saw his brother Jay enter the room.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Jay looked over at Tegan who was still unconscious in the bed. His heart sank as he watched them work on her. He went over towards Tegan and held her hand into his. His eyes just focused on her, not even meeting his brother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe are running tests, going to take an X-Ray as well as a consult. Don\u2019t worry Jay. She is in good hands. Does she have any family that needs to be called.\u201d Will asked as he placed his hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder. Will was watching his brother closely as his eyes remained on her.</p><p>Of course, they had their issues especially with them losing there father six months ago. He couldn\u2019t imagine what was going on his head right now. Especially with someone who he had feelings for. Lord knows if something happened to Natalie, he would lose it. He basically risked his life to keep her safe and protect her.</p><p>\u201cShe has a cousin. I am not sure of her cousin\u2019s number. Let me call Voight and see if Tegan\u2019s phone is there. Do whatever you can for her Will. I cannot lose her.\u201d Jay looked at his brother with seriousness. Will did the unthinkable thing and pulled his brother into a hug. It took everything in that moment for Jay not to break down and cry. He was falling hard for Tegan and maybe even in love with her. They had only been dating a few weeks but those feelings were all too real for him.</p><p>Just then Antonio came over towards Jay who had a concerned look on his face as well. \u201cHow is she?\u201d Jay got up and met Antonio outside her door.</p><p>\u201cThey are running tests and going to do an X-ray. From the looks of it, she seems stable. I know they are trying to warm her up. It\u2019s all too much. First, my dad and now Tegan, Antonio, I don\u2019t know if I can handle this. I don\u2019t even know her cousin\u2019s phone number.\u201d Jay groaned as he took his hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back inside and be with her. I will call the team and see if we can get her cousin\u2019s number. Do you know where she works or anything?\u201d Antonio asked looking at his friend and colleague. Jay was so normally headstrong and could think straight but this was a different side of him Antonio had never seen before. He looked -<b> lost.</b></p><p>\u201cI know her cousin\u2019s boyfriend Chris works at the college Tegan goes to. He is a history professor.\u201d Jay answered just looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the college? I will call and see if I can get a hold of him. His name is Chris right?\u201d Jay nodded in agreement not even finding the words to say.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Chris Evans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo be with Tegan and I will take care of it okay?\u201d Antonio said as he placed a hand on Jay\u2019s shoulder. Jay stood up and went over towards Tegan\u2019s bedside.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Antonio.\u201d His words were simple and true. Jay was just glad that there was someone here to help him through this. With that, Antonio went to work on finding Tegan\u2019s family.</p><p>Jay pulled up a chair and took Tegan\u2019s hand into his. Tegan\u2019s hand always fitted so perfectly into his hand. The feeling of her soft skin brought some sort of peace to him as his thumb stroked her inner hand. Jay rested his head alongside of her hand and finally let go. Tears filled his eyes as he finally let go. </p><p><i>\u201cTegan baby, hold on and be strong for me.\u201d</i> Jay closed his eyes and prayed that Tegan would be okay.</p><p><br></p><p><b>TAGLIST: </b>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc2i1VDavwHiG3zjhY58fw\">@moonriv-er</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a> </p>",

It had been a long day at work and the case they were working on was horrible. The cold beer was the only thing taking his mind off the horrors he had witnessed. That was until the door opened and she walked into the bar.</i></p><p><i>Lord was she beautiful. The air in his lungs all seemed to leave him and the world slowly started to fade away. She was the only thing that he was focused on. Right then and there.</i></p><p><i>He watched as her eyes scanned around the bar as if she was looking for someone. Maybe she was meeting someone? A boyfriend? He was definitely curious about her. The corner of his eye, he could see his brother and coworker just watching him closely as his eyes were focused on this beautiful woman who walked into the bar.<b> Into his life.</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Just go talk to her&rdquo; He felt his brother nudge him, trying to get him to move. He tried several times but he was just spellbound.</i></p><p><i>His eyes followed her every move as she took a seat near the end of the bar. Christopher had come over to take her order and placed it in front of her. That&rsquo;s when he noticed it - <b>her smile.</b> The minute Jay saw her smile was the moment he needed to go talk to this girl.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Dude, just go talk to the girl. What do you have to lose?&rdquo; Antonio smirked over at his friend who looked like a lovesick puppy. His eyes were strictly focused on the girl.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Come on Jay. Show us those moves all the girls love.&rdquo; Will took a sip and hid that smirk behind the glass bottle. Will swore Jay was about to rip his head off just for the teasing. This was a completely different side of him that he had never seen before.</i></p><p><i>Taking a big swig of beer, he got up out of his seat and slowly made his way over towards her. The beating of his heart could be felt against his chest the closer Jay got. The feeling of the sweat on his hands and forehead were starting to form. Jay noticed her beauty the closer he got to her. How her light brown hair shined in the bar lighting, her lip piercing and combat boots. Her knee was bouncing up and down as a nervous tic. Her short frame perfectly right in front of him. Her attention was turned to the tv to whatever sport that was currently on.</i></p><p>The events of how they met played in his head. The exact conversation - the first words he spoke to her.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re the only person in here not drinking a beer or some sort of liquor.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>She had turned around to look at him with her eyebrow cocked and the most confused look. Her focus was now eyeing him up and down. Like he had stepped into her personal space or maybe she just wasn&rsquo;t use to someone hitting on her. Who was he kidding - she probably had a boyfriend and was waiting for him.</i></p><p>Her first words echoed in his head caused a small chuckle from his lips. <i><b>&ldquo;I am waiting for someone&rdquo;</b></i>&hellip;.. <i>Her eyes were dead focused on him</i>&hellip;.<i><b>&ldquo;Besides beer is nasty.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>A small smile came on his face as he heard Tegan&rsquo;s words in his head. Her sweet, soft voice that brought peace to his mind. The fact she was waiting for her friends and there was no boyfriend. He was able to talk to Tegan and not worry about that. That she actually let him sit with her and enjoyed her company.</p><p>From then on, the conversation just seemed to flow. How they spent 30 minutes talking and laughing. How Daphne came over and was being the protective cousin. Tegan decided to stay with him and just talk. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel excited and instantly wanted to ask her out on a date. They both spent most of the night texting each other. The next morning was spent drinking lots of coffee but it was totally worth it. Jay Halstead was completely swept away. Most people would think he was crazy considering they had only been dating about 2 weeks but it didn&rsquo;t change how he felt inside. Those were the real feelings that he felt. That Tegan felt.</p><p>How they both spent all day talking in the park. They could just open up to each other and just be themselves. The feeling of her lips pressed against his as they kissed on the Farris Wheel. The moment they fell asleep on the couch in each other&rsquo;s arms. He honestly didn&rsquo;t want to leave her that day. The one thing that remained in his head was&hellip;<b>Her smile.</b></p><p>The same smile she always gave him, the same one that made his heart raced the first night they met. That was the greatest night of his life and he wasn&rsquo;t about to let anyone or thing take her away from him. The only way he was going to let her go was if she didn&rsquo;t want to be with him anymore. That she didn&rsquo;t have any feelings for him but even then he would still fight for her.</p><p>The moment Antonio called him and mentioned Tegan&rsquo;s apartment, his heart nearly dropped to the bottom of his chest. He knew that something was going to happen at that apartment complex. It was run down and just from the looks of it, the people were somewhat sketchy. His girl was completely in the middle of that and he would be damned if Tegan would be there any longer.</p><p>The siren blared through the streets signaling that there was an emergency. The snow was slowly falling down as there was a winter storm coming. It seemed like nothing was on his side as every street light had turned red but it didn&rsquo;t matter. He drove through the lights like nothing else. The foot was hitting hard on the gas as he drove. His heart hammering out his chest as he drove.</p><p>Jay just prayed that Tegan was safe. That he could pull her into his arms and kiss her. God help that the person that was at fault for this. The rage could be felt in his arms and hands gripping the steering wheel as he drove. He promised Tegan he would do everything in order to protect her. Jay wasn&rsquo;t about to break his promise to her.</p><p>Taking a sharp turn down her street, he could see the police lights as well as several ambulances. This sending Jay into overdrive as he witnessed it. Putting the car in park, Jay grabbed his gun, placed it in his holster and hopped out of the car. His legs taking over as he quickly walked near her apartment complex. It looked like most of his team was already here and his boss Hank Voight was talking to some cops over in the corner. Antonio could see the look on Jay&rsquo;s face as he came closer to the team.</p><p>&ldquo;Jay stop! Voight has ordered us to stand down for the moment.&rdquo; The sinking feeling in Jay&rsquo;s heart just took over as he was ordered to stop. Then it quickly turned to anger as he was being denied access to the apartment complex.</p><p>&ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S MY GIRLFRIEND, Antonio! I am not going to sit here and wait. I am going to go in and get her!&rdquo; Jay tried to push forward but his coworker Kevin and Adam quickly backed up Antonio. He desperately did his best to try and move forward but it was no use as several other cops came forward blocking Jay from getting in.</p><p>&ldquo;I understand that Jay, but right now we don&rsquo;t have all the details before we go in. I know you want to go in there, but let Voight come back and see what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; Antonio was doing his best to reason with Jay but he could see the fire in his friend&rsquo;s eyes. It was that same fire that he, himself had when his son was kidnapped when his daughter was kidnapped. They had to remain level headed and smart or more damage could possibly be done.</p><p>Just then Voight had come over towards the group with a serious look on his face. Jay was starting to get antsy as things weren&rsquo;t progressing the way he wanted to. Every waking minute just seemed to be never-ending. That he was stuck in a nightmare and couldn&rsquo;t get out of it. Who knows if Tegan was hurt and bleeding. She was probably scared and calling out for him. This was basically killing him inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Hank, I am going in there whether you all like it or not. My girlfriend is in that building.&rdquo; Jay was doing his best to plead with his boss. It didn&rsquo;t even seem like it was working as Voight shock his head no.</p><p>&ldquo;Jay, I understand that we are working on a plan at the moment. Please be patient, Jay.&rdquo; Looking amongst the group as they seemed to be just as nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;What do we know so far?&rdquo; Adam was the first one to ask the question that needed to be answered. If they truly knew what was going on, a plan could be made and Jay could get to Tegan faster.</p><p>&ldquo;All we know is that there was an argument on the 5th floor which caused some shots were fired. Several neighbors called the cops, but when they arrived, there seemed to be gunfire towards the cops. We don&rsquo;t have any information on any of the neighbors. That&rsquo;s the reason why we aren&rsquo;t going in. If they are being held hostage, we don&rsquo;t want to risk causalities.&rdquo; Voight explained but it still didn&rsquo;t bring any ease to Jay&rsquo;s mind. It actually brought even worse thoughts to his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;How do YOU expect to get any information on the neighbors if no one can get inside?&rdquo; Jay&rsquo;s voice was on the verge of shouting as his team looked at him. Concern was written all over there faces. This was HIS girl they were talking about after all.</p><p>&ldquo;Jay, I understand that and do you think I want anyone injured as well? I want to do this in a civil controlled manner. But I will not risk it because you want to go half cocked. Now we will do this when we have all the details. If you don&rsquo;t want to help or cannot calm down - I will bench you.&rdquo; Jay just stared at Voight as he spoke. Both trying to come to some sort of understand as he looked at his boss.</p><p>Just then shots were fired&hellip;Almost instantly everyone took off towards the apartment. Jay&rsquo;s legs never took off faster as he ran inside&hellip;..</p><hr /><p>Tegan wrapped the covers around her body tightly. It was a lot colder than she had originally anticipated it being or maybe it was the pure fact the heater and ac weren&rsquo;t working. That fucking landlord couldn&rsquo;t fix anything in this damn place. There was nothing that could be done right now as she wrapped it closer to her body. All she wanted was to be warm and be wrapped in Jay&rsquo;s strong arms.<br /></p><p>The past few nights, dreams of him had entered her brain. Most of them being erotic and some romantic. Jay had entered her life when she least expected it. The moment he walked up to her and flashed that pretty boy smile. She was completely swept away. Jay was everything she wanted in a man. Funny, smart, romantic and muscular as hell. His strong arms and the way his jeans fitted his body.</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t deny that she was falling for him.<b> Hard. </b>He was constantly on her mind and in her dreams. Yes, her heart was still guarded but it felt like Jay was something more. But could that even be possible? They were only dating for two weeks. Of course, they were taking it slow, but she couldn&rsquo;t deny there was something more between them. She would just have to follow her heart to see where it led.</p><p>She struggled to go to sleep but it was no use. Between the cold weather and loud arguing at 4:30 am. Ugh. Do any of these people ever sleep? Throwing the covers over her head, she groaned loudly. All she wanted to do was sleep. That&rsquo;s when she heard the loud banging against her kitchen wall. Placing her feet on the cold ground, she started to walk over towards the kitchen to knock on the wall. Before she made it to the kitchen, several cracks of pops came off.</p><p>It was gunfire. Her heart started to race as she heard it and backed away from the wall. That&rsquo;s when she felt a sharp pain hit her leg causing her to fall down. Looking down, she noticed it started to bleed. Tegan tried to get up but it was no use as she fell to the ground instantly. The pain in her leg started to radiate all the way up. Dragging her body towards her bedroom, she needed to find somewhere to lay low. To hideaway. Who knows if they were going to come back or what was going to happen next.</p><p>The blood could be seen on the ground as she dragged herself towards the closet. That&rsquo;s when Tegan grabbed one of the shirts on her chair, nearest to her, to wrap it around her leg. Tears started to whelm in her eyes as pulled it tight against her skin. What was she going to do? She needed to find safety and quickly. Her closet.</p><p>Tegan did her best to limp towards the closet. Luckily, there was only a small amount of blood that was dragged but there was a decent size puddle where she fell to the ground. She couldn&rsquo;t worry about that right now. She just prayed that Jay wound find her. That he would save her. &ldquo;Shit, my phone is on the other side of the room&rdquo; realizing she couldn&rsquo;t call Jay.</p><p>There was no point in getting the phone right now. She didn&rsquo;t know what was going to happen and didn&rsquo;t want to risk it. Closing the door behind her, Tegan found a blanket and wrapped it around her body. Everything seemed to fade just a bit as she felt dizzy. Or maybe it was the fact she could be dying? No! She wasn&rsquo;t going to die here. <b>Not today</b>. Jay would come and save her. Tegan had to believe that.</p><p>Doing her best to stay awake, she wrapped the blanket tightly around her body. That&rsquo;s when she heard another set of gunfire go off. Getting up slowly, she made her way to the very back of the closet. Behind all the boxes that were still in there and the clothes that hung up. Honestly, it was pretty warm back there despite the heater not even working.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Jay, please save me.&rdquo;</b></i> Her voice was just above a whisper and tears started to stream down her face as she spoke to the empty room. All she wanted was for him to find her and hopefully, that would be soon.</p><p>Her own body started to feel weak as the cold was now starting to hit her. Or maybe it was the lack of sleep or even blood loss from her leg. Tegan felt her eyes slowly start to close and her body fall to the ground as darkness took over.</p><hr /><p>Voight had led the charge into the apartment complex, followed by several officers and SWAT. Knocking could be heard on the lower floors as a means to check on the neighbors. That wasn&rsquo;t Jay&rsquo;s top priority. His mind was only on Tegan and making sure she was safe.<br /></p><p>Jay had his gun drawn to his side as they came up the stairs. The closer he got to her door, the more his heart started to race. It was as if tunnel vision took over. Her door was strictly in sight now - <b>5D</b>. Other footsteps were behind him as well following him towards the 5th floor. Antonio was close behind him knowing exactly what his mindset was on.</p><p>Jay watched as Voight, Adam, and Kevin all went towards the other doors on the left side of Tegan&rsquo;s door and Kim and Hailey followed towards the right side. No one had a clue as to which apartment on the fifth floor it came from. It was pretty much a guessing game at this point. The game had completely changed now as they entered the other apartments.</p><p>With his gun pointed at the door, Jay nodded at Antonio to bust the door open. It was completely easy after all being a crappy apartment after all. The moment they entered the apartment, a strong blast of cold air had whipped past them.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit! It&rsquo;s freezing in here.&rdquo; Antonio whispered. Jay had to admit her apartment was freezing as he saw his own breath out of his mouth. He was now in overdrive as time seemed to be of the essence. He had to find her. &ldquo;Jay, over here!&rdquo; Antonio shouted as he looked down at the ground and found a pool of blood on the ground.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</i> Jay muttered turning his head to look around the room. Her bed was completely empty except the bear he got her from the Pier. The fact that Tegan had it closer to her when she slept meant a lot to him. Placing it back on the bed, he turned around and noticed there weren&rsquo;t very many places to hide in a one bedroom apartment. Jay got down on the ground to check under the bed. <b>Nothing.</b> Antonio looked in the bathroom and turned right back around.</p><p>There was nothing in either place except the coldness of the room. Whoever owned this apartment complex was about to have a very bad day. It was one thing to neglect the upkeep of the apartment, it was a completely another thing not to have the air and heat properly working.</p><p>&ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know where she could be. We have checked under the bed and the bathroom. The living room is clear as well.&rdquo; Antonio mentioned. Jay turned around and saw her closet. Turning the handle, Antonio flashed his flashlight into the closet. It was filled with most of her clothes and several boxes.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, let me see,&rdquo; Jay whispered as he took the flashlight from his coworker. He proceeded further into the closet and looked past the boxes that were near the back. &ldquo;Take this.&rdquo; Jay handed back the flashlight to Antonio and his heart raced as he saw Tegan laying with a blanket wrapped around her. It was a small blanket, to say the least.</p><p>&ldquo;Tegan, baby, I am here. Please wake up.&rdquo; Jay&rsquo;s voice cracked just a bit as he spoke. He was practically pleading but there was no response from her.</p><p>His fingers went towards her neck in a means to check her pulse. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s alive but it&rsquo;s a weak pulse. We need the ambo here now.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when Jay noticed her leg and the blood-soaked shirt around her leg. &ldquo;Shit! She&rsquo;s been shot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Civilian shot, we need an ambo now!&rdquo; Antonio&rsquo;s voice was filled with worry as Jay picked up an unconscious Tegan in his arms. Doing his best not to break down, Jay placed Tegan on the ground and took her blanket off the bed to wrap her. Tegan&rsquo;s lips were blue, her body was completely freezing and her pulse was weak. He could tell from the blood on the ground, Tegan had lost a decent amount of blood.</p><p>Just then Voight and Adam walked in the room. There was no expression on Jay&rsquo;s face as Tegan&rsquo;s head was placed in his lap. Just then Voight keyed his radio up.</p><p>&ldquo;Ambo 51, we need you here now! We have a civilian shot in the leg and she is unconscious.&rdquo; There was anger in Voight&rsquo;s voice.</p><p><i>&ldquo;We are coming up now.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Just then paramedics Sylvie Brett and Emily Foster entered the room right past Voight and Adam. Both of them noticed Tegan wrapped in the blanket and the blood was seeping through her blanket. Honestly, they feared Jay at that moment with Tegan in his lap. It was like they never saw this side of Jay as his facial expression was completely blank except the fire behind his eyes. Almost as if he was going to lose it right then and there.</p><p>&ldquo;Jay, let us take care of her. Don&rsquo;t worry, we will take care of her. If she has any family, I suggest you call them and let them know.&rdquo; Sylvie placed her hand on Jay&rsquo;s back in reassurance. It did no good. Nothing was going to reassure Jay until she was out of danger.</p><p>&ldquo;We are taking her to Med. I will let your brother know okay?&rdquo; Emily was quick to reassure Jay as well. But all Jay could do was look at Tegan being wheeled out in a gurney. The fact he couldn&rsquo;t save her from this. That he should have listened to his gut when he felt like something was wrong. He should have brought her back to his apartment last night.</p><p>Looking down at the floor, he saw the blood that was now being tracked out of the apartment. It was HER blood. That&rsquo;s when he felt a hand being placed on his back. &ldquo;We will find the son of a bitch who did this and make him pay.&rdquo;</p><p>Jay just pushed the hand off his back and turned around to look at Voight, Antonio, and Adam. Just then Kevin, Hailey, and Kim entered the apartment as well, unsure of what had just happened &ldquo;You better be sure we are going to find this son of a bitch and he&rsquo;s going to get what&rsquo;s coming to him. He hurt Tegan and now it&rsquo;s my turn.&rdquo; With that Jay left his teammates behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Antonio, keep an eye on him. When we have more information, I will let you know. Right now we have to figure out what went on here.&rdquo; Voight turned his attention towards Antonio. &ldquo;Let me know if he does anything rash.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you once we get to Med.&rdquo; Antonio quickly left and to catch up to Jay. Deep down, he had a sinking feeling once Jay got ahold of the person, it wasn&rsquo;t going to end well. Voight just hoped that he could get to Jay before he did something stupid.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I know this hits to close to home for Jay. For now, we work the case like we always do. Follow the leads and interview everyone. We will only tell Jay if we have to. For right now his attention needs to be on Tegan. We protect family and family is not just beyond this team. It&rsquo;s everyone that this team holds dear. So let&rsquo;s work the case and find this son of a bitch.&rdquo; Voight looked amongst the group and they nodded their heads in approval.</p><p>The Intelligence Team just hoped they found this person before Jay did. Lord knows, he would probably do something he couldn&rsquo;t come back from. That would be the worst case scenario and Hank Voight would be damned if that would happen. It was his job to protect his team.</p><hr /><p><b>Chicago Med</b><br /></p><p>Tegan felt her body going in and out of consciousness with voices coming and going. All she sensed was Jay&rsquo;s presence. Being in his arms and hold her close to him. Then there was the pain. The constant pain that radiated in her leg. Then it hit her, she was shot. It all came back to her like waves in and out. Dragging herself to the closet in the freezing cold room with her leg. Just the pain. The feeling that Jay wasn&rsquo;t there to protect her. But he found her and saved her.</p><p>Will Halstead was waiting by the ambulance bay for Tegan Mitchell. The girl that seemed to have captured Jay&rsquo;s heart. He would be damned if he didn&rsquo;t do everything in his power to save Tegan. He remembered the first day Jay met Tegan. He was all shy and wasn&rsquo;t sure if he should even talk to her. That look his brother gave him. A small smile came on his face as it appeared in his face.</p><p>Just like that the ambulance appeared and pulled up with Sylvie and Emily pulling the gurney. &ldquo;A 25-year-old woman, shot in the leg and drop in body temperature. We have given her IV warm saline and applied fresh dressings.&rdquo; Sylvie gave Will as many details as she could as they brought her into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;On my count&hellip;1&hellip;2&hellip;3&hellip;&rdquo; They transferred Tegan over to the hospital bed but both of them turned around to face Will.</p><p>&ldquo;Jay will be here soon and doesn&rsquo;t look very happy. Keep us updated Will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you both,&rdquo; Will said as he looked over at them. &ldquo;Will do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want a CBC, CMP, X-rays, warm saline and blankets for the hypothermia. Also, call surgery consultation as well.&rdquo; Will gave instructions towards the nurse who nodded and went to work. Will took a few notes down and that&rsquo;s when he saw his brother Jay enter the room.</p><p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; Jay looked over at Tegan who was still unconscious in the bed. His heart sank as he watched them work on her. He went over towards Tegan and held her hand into his. His eyes just focused on her, not even meeting his brother&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;We are running tests, going to take an X-Ray as well as a consult. Don&rsquo;t worry Jay. She is in good hands. Does she have any family that needs to be called.&rdquo; Will asked as he placed his hand on his brother&rsquo;s shoulder. Will was watching his brother closely as his eyes remained on her.</p><p>Of course, they had their issues especially with them losing there father six months ago. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine what was going on his head right now. Especially with someone who he had feelings for. Lord knows if something happened to Natalie, he would lose it. He basically risked his life to keep her safe and protect her.</p><p>&ldquo;She has a cousin. I am not sure of her cousin&rsquo;s number. Let me call Voight and see if Tegan&rsquo;s phone is there. Do whatever you can for her Will. I cannot lose her.&rdquo; Jay looked at his brother with seriousness. Will did the unthinkable thing and pulled his brother into a hug. It took everything in that moment for Jay not to break down and cry. He was falling hard for Tegan and maybe even in love with her. They had only been dating a few weeks but those feelings were all too real for him.</p><p>Just then Antonio came over towards Jay who had a concerned look on his face as well. &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; Jay got up and met Antonio outside her door.</p><p>&ldquo;They are running tests and going to do an X-ray. From the looks of it, she seems stable. I know they are trying to warm her up. It&rsquo;s all too much. First, my dad and now Tegan, Antonio, I don&rsquo;t know if I can handle this. I don&rsquo;t even know her cousin&rsquo;s phone number.&rdquo; Jay groaned as he took his hand through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go back inside and be with her. I will call the team and see if we can get her cousin&rsquo;s number. Do you know where she works or anything?&rdquo; Antonio asked looking at his friend and colleague. Jay was so normally headstrong and could think straight but this was a different side of him Antonio had never seen before. He looked -<b> lost.</b></p><p>&ldquo;I know her cousin&rsquo;s boyfriend Chris works at the college Tegan goes to. He is a history professor.&rdquo; Jay answered just looking at the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the college? I will call and see if I can get a hold of him. His name is Chris right?&rdquo; Jay nodded in agreement not even finding the words to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Chris Evans.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go be with Tegan and I will take care of it okay?&rdquo; Antonio said as he placed a hand on Jay&rsquo;s shoulder. Jay stood up and went over towards Tegan&rsquo;s bedside.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Antonio.&rdquo; His words were simple and true. Jay was just glad that there was someone here to help him through this. With that, Antonio went to work on finding Tegan&rsquo;s family.</p><p>Jay pulled up a chair and took Tegan&rsquo;s hand into his. Tegan&rsquo;s hand always fitted so perfectly into his hand. The feeling of her soft skin brought some sort of peace to him as his thumb stroked her inner hand. Jay rested his head alongside of her hand and finally let go. Tears filled his eyes as he finally let go. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Tegan baby, hold on and be strong for me.&rdquo;</i> Jay closed his eyes and prayed that Tegan would be okay.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>TAGLIST: </b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc2i1VDavwHiG3zjhY58fw\">@moonriv-er</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a> </p>",
