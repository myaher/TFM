But I could see there being a birthday party beforehand and I do find it interesting that this credit was only added very recently as this same extra had added his role as man walking in the park in Unloading Zone almost immediately after it was filmed in October.\u00a0</p><p>If this credit is legit and it is for A Moving Day the most likely option would be for Bex\u2019s birthday since we\u2019ve seen Andi and Bowie\u2019s and Celia\u2019s birthdays already. in the original production the only recurring character was Ham and while they re-shot most of the Mack family scenes on the way to and at the Gazebo there were other scenes that likely had to be scrapped so in theory there would probably be room for Bex to have a birthday party. And either way they need to get the Macks out to the Gazebo so maybe they go there and Andi thinks it\u2019s part of Bex\u2019s birthday gift but it turns out to be Jonah singing You Girl to her.</p><p>That being said, imdb is a bit of a mess right now so we should take new credits with a grain of salt. For some reason someone removed the casting for the finale and replaced it with the cast list for the original 3x18 which was filmed at Snuck Farm. That\u2019s why Luke, Raquel, and Anson aren\u2019t currently listed for the series finale and some middle aged women who were likely wedding guests or wedding planners in the original 3x18 are listed as appearing in the finale even though all their scenes were cut.\u00a0</p>",

        "answer": "<p>I really don\u2019t know, and I haven\u2019t put too much thought into Kira\u2019s arc honestly, so this post might just be me rambling while I figure out my own thoughts on the matter. For some people, she will not be fully redeemed no matter what happens on the show. She came in swinging, and this show\u2019s audience aren\u2019t just going to let that go no matter how complex the redemption is.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve said all along that I think that Cyrus, TJ, Buffy, and Kira\u2019s storylines will all ultimately overlap and come full circle, and I think that still has to be true in some capacity. Kira not only has to find resolution with TJ and Cyrus, but she still has to resolve things with Buffy - the person she really has a problem with. Buffy is, on some level, aware of the chemistry between TJ and Cyrus - and she is already upset with TJ for the events of costume day, based on what we have learned from Andi\u2019s Texts. Buffy and Cyrus are\u00a0\u201ccrush buddies\u201d, and there\u2019s a chance that Cyrus may play a part in Muffy getting back together - so it would make sense if Buffy were involved in the rest of the Tyrus plot as well.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve discussed the importance of the parallels between TJ and Kira\u2019s storylines before. TJ was introduced to the show through Buffy\u2019s basketball storyline, as a bad guy, with the purpose of ultimately becoming Cyrus\u2019 love interest. Kira was introduced to the show through Buffy\u2019s basketball storyline, as a bad guy, with the purpose of ultimately (eventually) pushing TJ and Cyrus together.\u00a0</p><p>Early in TJ\u2019s character arc, he appeared to be putting on a\u00a0\u201ctough\u201d front, and became more mean the more threatened he felt by Buffy\u2019s skills. We saw him have moments of being <i>normal </i>like when he was outside of the record store, and was actually okay towards Buffy until he was reminded that he feels inferior to her. And we\u2019ve seen the exact same thing happen with Kira\u2019s character. She was fairly kind when Buffy first invited her to be a part of the team, but got a big head and ultimately felt inferior to Buffy - so she started to act out and put on a front.\u00a0</p><p>Because we have already seen a complete redemption arc with TJ\u2019s character, I honestly don\u2019t even think we <i>need </i>a full redemption arc with Kira\u2019s character. I keep thinking about that line that Josh shared that says\u00a0\u201c<i><b>Sometimes there\u2019s a nice person inside trying to get out</b></i>,\u201d and trying to think of how it will relate to the show. Obviously I don\u2019t know the exact plot point it will be used in, but I think that, thematically, it can apply to a lot of characters we see on the show, and their journeys.\u00a0</p><p>I think that when you apply that quote to both TJ and Kira\u2019s storylines, it makes it feel almost more natural if Kira\u2019s character <i>isn\u2019t </i>fully redeemed by it. Have her apologize, yes. Make it clear that her character is interested in changing for the better - the same way we have seen TJ and Amber change for the better. But we don\u2019t actually have to see those changes happen. I could easily see that line being in a conversation where TJ is trying to explain <i>why </i>he was trying to be friends with Kira, despite her doing terrible things. Or I could see that line being used in a conversation where Cyrus is trying to rationalize why he still cares about TJ, and why he ultimately sees that even Kira deserves a second chance. But the line is just one of those quotes from the show that can be applied to so many situations, universally, and I think no matter where it actually fits in - the themes apply to this particular storyline well.\u00a0</p><p>So yeah. I don\u2019t think Kira\u2019s redemption needs to be tied up with a bow. I don\u2019t think it has to be perfect. I don\u2019t think anyone should <i>expect </i>to get nearly as much depth to her redemption as we have seen with other characters. She needs to realize what she did was wrong, and make amends with the appropriate characters. But it\u2019s not necessary for us to go on that full journey with her. Sometimes things are left open-ended, and sometimes that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0</p>",

She was fairly kind when Buffy first invited her to be a part of the team, but got a big head and ultimately felt inferior to Buffy - so she started to act out and put on a front.\u00a0</p><p>Because we have already seen a complete redemption arc with TJ\u2019s character, I honestly don\u2019t even think we <i>need </i>a full redemption arc with Kira\u2019s character. I keep thinking about that line that Josh shared that says\u00a0\u201c<i><b>Sometimes there\u2019s a nice person inside trying to get out</b></i>,\u201d and trying to think of how it will relate to the show. Obviously I don\u2019t know the exact plot point it will be used in, but I think that, thematically, it can apply to a lot of characters we see on the show, and their journeys.\u00a0</p><p>I think that when you apply that quote to both TJ and Kira\u2019s storylines, it makes it feel almost more natural if Kira\u2019s character <i>isn\u2019t </i>fully redeemed by it. Have her apologize, yes. Make it clear that her character is interested in changing for the better - the same way we have seen TJ and Amber change for the better. But we don\u2019t actually have to see those changes happen. I could easily see that line being in a conversation where TJ is trying to explain <i>why </i>he was trying to be friends with Kira, despite her doing terrible things. Or I could see that line being used in a conversation where Cyrus is trying to rationalize why he still cares about TJ, and why he ultimately sees that even Kira deserves a second chance. But the line is just one of those quotes from the show that can be applied to so many situations, universally, and I think no matter where it actually fits in - the themes apply to this particular storyline well.\u00a0</p><p>So yeah. I don\u2019t think Kira\u2019s redemption needs to be tied up with a bow. I don\u2019t think it has to be perfect. I don\u2019t think anyone should <i>expect </i>to get nearly as much depth to her redemption as we have seen with other characters. She needs to realize what she did was wrong, and make amends with the appropriate characters. But it\u2019s not necessary for us to go on that full journey with her. Sometimes things are left open-ended, and sometimes that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0</p>",
