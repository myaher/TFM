Hero or not keeping kids past the time the UA bell rang was a struggle even for those pro heros. Andi wasn\u2019t in such a hurry to get home. Not that she hated it. There was just something lonely about a weekend spent alone cramming for class in a city still so new and unfamiliar. It was what the young hero wanted moving all the way to the Japan branch when a slot within the hero academy opened up. Passing the entrance exams in the states was one thing. Where she wanted to train was UA.</p><p> Be it true there was something more she wished she could show for such sacrifices aside from being a second year in room 1 B. Striving to be the top was hard with a mind quirk. The teachers as well as the principle had warned the young female of that. Nearly advising her and the family against it since there was no guarantee Andi would be able to keep up with strength quirks and 1 A students. Regardless she tried. Even if it meant lonely weekends and little down time. She took it with great pride. Though staying after school on a Friday wasn&rsquo;t everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. It simply allowed her a notion of doing good and keeping busy to offer more cleaning an extracurricular help. </p><p>Today was no exception. The UA sports festival had happened a little over a week ago but many of the course students were still feeling the lag. Andi had made it to round three. One on one battles. But after one round there was no way her quirk helped in a test of physical aptitude. Which this year seemed to be the only thing the top three winners had to trope competition. Andi wasn\u2019t hurt though. As a second year she still had one more UA festive to shine in. And besides that she <b>was </b>a mind quirk who&rsquo;d made it one bracket father than another student with a mind quirk. So to her it was still an honorable win to show off those skills.\u00a0</p><p>Now though it was about physical power. So she volunteered to move some boxes of texts and other articles from business class to general studies. Heavy lifting wasn&rsquo;t going to be alleviated by her quirk so Andi found this the best chance to start on more strength training. While also keeping her mind from wandering.</p><p>Down with the last grueling box of old dusty year one books schlepped off at business studies. She found it perfect timing as it was nearly six o'clock. Which meant she could go back to the apartment just to cook, eat, shove in some studying and be ready to go to bed without much down time. Shouldering the school bag and locking up 1 B like promised. Andi focus down on her phone switching through annoying voicemails from parents and the annoying notifications for apps no one gave a rats ass about. By this time all classrooms should be shut up and empty for the night. Not the case when she passed room 1 A.</p><p>Certainly not expecting the hero course to even <i>have </i>any students still here and not off enjoying the weekend. She jump a little surprised seeing one kid stuck staring at something on his desk. A step and a half back so the door frame hid her. It didn&rsquo;t seem they noticed or heard the passwerby. </p><p>&rsquo;<i>That&rsquo;s odd</i>&hellip;.&rsquo; Andi squinted her eyes trying to place the white and red haired lad, she knew she\u2019d seen him somewhere, &rsquo;&hellip;.<i>oh! The boy who placed second! Toro- No- Tadaork- Not that- Todoroki! The fire and ice guy!</i>&rsquo; </p><p>Almost ashamed she hadn&rsquo;t even paid enough attention to recall the winners names. Andi was momentarily caught off guard seeing something drip off his face. Recalling his affinity for that overly power ice attacks she reckoned it must be byproduct of his quirk. Ice wasn&rsquo;t meant to be inside in warm climate controlled air. How hard it must have been being ice AND fire. A constant battle of hoping one don&rsquo;t fire up or drench their clothes. Sure she\u2019s just passing by, Andi made to walk on her way when the 1 A student raises his arm and wipes away at his face. </p><p>She blinks mid stare. That wasn&rsquo;t melting ice. He was crying. </p><p>Silently sure but looking harder reveals how upsettingly right she is. Not many but a dotting trail of tears on his paper. Though the B class student couldn&rsquo;t see what the paper was but knew the dread of crying over a test. She\u2019d had her fair share of waterworks herself over tests.\u00a0</p><p>Engulfed in leaning into the door frame trying to guess what was wrong. While also being heart stricken that even a second place winner was crying. Andi wasn\u2019t mindful of her quirk as her thoughts wander.</p><p>Unlike those with malice mind quirks. Such as brainwashing or putting people to sleep. Hers was almost always seen as a novelty. Thought mostly done on purpose, the girls mind projected like a blanket. Not terribly far but enough people within combat range reported feeling it. To a sensation of calmness or contentedness. Andi had found out if battling hard enough that calming effect could be changed to an addling effect. Which posed better use during a fight. Sadly though she hadn&rsquo;t learned how to switch between a comforting projection or a confusion one. </p><p>This was one of those times she wasn\u2019t aware she was doing it at all. Forlorn just to see someone distressed her thoughts were a ramble but they still sought out like tendrils for the nearest life form. Not evening noticing she was doing anything until Andi saw Todoroki lean up from his paper and touch his cheeks. Where he&rsquo;d felt stray tears were now suddenly gone. That overwhelming loathsome string of thoughts in his mind nearly all gone. Not like he&rsquo;d forgotten what had upset him. But that they just seemed so, insignificant now. Replaced with a gentle calmness in regards to nothing the 1 A student ever felt. </p><p>Todoroki looked from his desk to the open classroom door. She was busted. Suddenly realizing that bad habit of letting her mind wander happened all too much. Clasping hands over her mouth like words actually had anything to do with it. Andi jerked back with a thudding heart hoping he hadn&rsquo;t seen her. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;.A mind quirk,&rdquo; Todoroki&rsquo;s low voice filled the space between, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not something we see a lot here at UA is it?&rdquo; He cast his heterochromia eyes over to the door where he knew the intruder was, &ldquo;And for one so kind willed, it&rsquo;s a wonder you want to be a hero.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Busted</b>.</p><p>Knowing there was no way to play off that he had the wrong person now. Andi stepped into the doorway. Fist clenching her bag straps afraid what he might do if he interrupted her as spying, &ldquo;I&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry I wasn&rsquo;t trying to watch you or anything. Honestly, I just done moving things for class 1 B and didn&rsquo;t expect&hellip;.well didn&rsquo;t expect to see anyone else here this late either.&rdquo; Attempting to play it off as cool she laughed light heartedly rubbing the back of her head, &ldquo;Especially from class 1 A! I thought you guys all dashed out of here the moment the bell rang!&rdquo;</p><p>He looked back down at the paper in front of him. What was a pitiful excuse for a joke failed and Andi felt her dread setting in. He probably really did think she was snooping around after hours now. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; His words surprised her even though he didn&rsquo;t look up at the girl. They were certainly meant towards her.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Andi stopped playing the cool act with his unexpected words, &ldquo;I uh no I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was quite upset about this test score,&rdquo; Todoroki turned his face away from the paper and to the student in the doorway, &ldquo;With as much prep as I&rsquo;d done it had blindsided me that Mr. Aizawa marked as many wrong as he did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh I&rsquo;m sorry about your test scores&hellip;&rdquo; she shifted a little uncomfortable not following anymore. At this point being caught red handed embarrassed the timidly straightlaced student enough. And didn&rsquo;t give her a chance to recall her quirk. Without thinking she&rsquo;d been projecting her feelings right out to the sullen school mate without her own knowledge. </p><p>Todoroki rose from his seat. Placing the no longer important test paper in his pack before stepping up to her. Since she was a second year student she was technically older. But Andi wouldn&rsquo;t stop cursing high school for all the boys getting their growth spurts now. And she\u2019d topping out at your max height in middle school. A half step back when he came up to her so silently only made Andi fumble in a panic. Just as quick as he was in the festival battles. The young fire and ice hero grabbed her wrist and helped her step back onto two solid feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh- Uh thanks-&rdquo; she smiled sheepishly rubbing the back of her head, &ldquo;Guess that makes us even now.&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki looked this new individual up and down. His guess right when he recognized her as the second year student who&rsquo;d made it to round two in the one on one battles. But had been beat by one of his own classmates due to speed and the inability to pitch a mind quirk to a hero who only needed mere seconds to push one out of the ring. She had done well and put up a fight. For that other students including the second place one had noticed.</p><p>&ldquo;Andi Meyier right? That quirk,&rdquo; Todoroki studied her, &ldquo;It calms people?&rdquo;</p><p>Not expecting to have him ask about it. She nodded seeing he got half of it right, &ldquo;Yes, for the most part. But sadly not like hypnosis.That would be more useful in a fight. I&rsquo;ve been able to project a few other stronger emotions but not with an regularity to make in part of my arsenal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you could make someone feel sad, or angry, happy or jealous?&rdquo; Todoroki through out options trying to pin point her exactly.</p><p>For those guesses she had to shake her head no, &ldquo;Not so much. I can confuse mostly, leaving someone stunned or unable to react to a situation. But like I said, the calming affect is all I&rsquo;ve really got.&rdquo; Andi looked down at her hand. Thinking this school would bring out more in her. Two years had gone by and she was really starting to wonder if this was a hero quirk at all. So many other helpful things could be done with it. But here she was being selfish and wanting to become a hero. It gnawed at her day in and day out if this was the right choice.</p><p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Todoroki&rsquo;s voice snapped her from the latent trail of thoughts in her mind. Andi looked from her hand up to him. Heat creeping on her cheeks as he was vividly and clearly studying her. Nearly about to break away and end this before she embarrassed herself anymore. He had something surprising to add, &ldquo;Would you like to study together?&rdquo;</p><p>Floored even that a 1 A student wanted to study with someone who hardly past as a support hero on a good day. She nearly gagged on the flood of words that fight to make it out of her mouth at the same time. No more abashed by that nonverbal response Todoroki still enjoyed the effects of the female\u2019s calming ability and explained further, &ldquo;When I studied for this test I was riled up. My thoughts got the best of me and this grading period suffered from it.If you can help me retain a calm mindset to study, I&rsquo;d be more than happy to return the favor and help you physically train.&rdquo; Andi\u2019s face full on heated up. No way now to deny her own prattling lucid thoughts before really did give her away. The embarrassment seemed to only be one sided thought which helped. Todoroki looked at her unphased, &ldquo;It would be even, that way.&rdquo;</p><p>Given an opportunity to train with those going pro was undeniable one of the best chances she had at getting to where she wanted. PE class just couldn&rsquo;t cut it and Andi didn&rsquo;t know enough about physical combat to set up a workout regimen that would do her the max good. And here she was being offered help by a literal runner up to the UA festival. Maybe her face gave it away. Or perhaps still her mind was wandered too much around this fellow for her own good.</p><p>But as placid as his expression stayed. The corner of Todoroki&rsquo;s lip curled up and he placed a hand on her shoulder, &ldquo;Good. Meet me outside the cram building tomorrow at eight o'clock. We can begin then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow?? Eight o'clock??&rdquo; Andi nearly choked not realizing he wanted to start right away on this barter for quirk deals. </p><p>Todoroki stopped only a few steps pasted her and cocked his head back to the older student, &ldquo;We both clearly don&rsquo;t have any plans with friends or family. That much I could gather from your thoughts.&rdquo;</p><p>Fire engine red cheeks, Andi half covered her face like she could shove her quirk back in her brain and make it stop embarrassing herself, &ldquo;Y-Yes! Tomorrow at eight! I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p><p>Again unable to help the curl of a faint smile on his lips Todoroki at least turned back away so he wouldn&rsquo;t give himself away, &ldquo;Good. I look forward to seeing what we can make of this.&rdquo;</p>",

Hero or not keeping kids past the time the UA bell rang was a struggle even for those pro heros. Andi wasn\u2019t in such a hurry to get home. Not that she hated it. There was just something lonely about a weekend spent alone cramming for class in a city still so new and unfamiliar. It was what the young hero wanted moving all the way to the Japan branch when a slot within the hero academy opened up. Passing the entrance exams in the states was one thing. Where she wanted to train was UA.</p><p> Be it true there was something more she wished she could show for such sacrifices aside from being a second year in room 1 B. Striving to be the top was hard with a mind quirk. The teachers as well as the principle had warned the young female of that. Nearly advising her and the family against it since there was no guarantee Andi would be able to keep up with strength quirks and 1 A students. Regardless she tried. Even if it meant lonely weekends and little down time. She took it with great pride. Though staying after school on a Friday wasn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea. It simply allowed her a notion of doing good and keeping busy to offer more cleaning an extracurricular help. </p><p>Today was no exception. The UA sports festival had happened a little over a week ago but many of the course students were still feeling the lag. Andi had made it to round three. One on one battles. But after one round there was no way her quirk helped in a test of physical aptitude. Which this year seemed to be the only thing the top three winners had to trope competition. Andi wasn\u2019t hurt though. As a second year she still had one more UA festive to shine in. And besides that she <b>was </b>a mind quirk who\u2019d made it one bracket father than another student with a mind quirk. So to her it was still an honorable win to show off those skills.\u00a0</p><p>Now though it was about physical power. So she volunteered to move some boxes of texts and other articles from business class to general studies. Heavy lifting wasn\u2019t going to be alleviated by her quirk so Andi found this the best chance to start on more strength training. While also keeping her mind from wandering.</p><p>Down with the last grueling box of old dusty year one books schlepped off at business studies. She found it perfect timing as it was nearly six o'clock. Which meant she could go back to the apartment just to cook, eat, shove in some studying and be ready to go to bed without much down time. Shouldering the school bag and locking up 1 B like promised. Andi focus down on her phone switching through annoying voicemails from parents and the annoying notifications for apps no one gave a rats ass about. By this time all classrooms should be shut up and empty for the night. Not the case when she passed room 1 A.</p><p>Certainly not expecting the hero course to even <i>have </i>any students still here and not off enjoying the weekend. She jump a little surprised seeing one kid stuck staring at something on his desk. A step and a half back so the door frame hid her. It didn\u2019t seem they noticed or heard the passwerby. </p><p>\u2019<i>That\u2019s odd</i>\u2026.\u2019 Andi squinted her eyes trying to place the white and red haired lad, she knew she\u2019d seen him somewhere, \u2019\u2026.<i>oh! The boy who placed second! Toro- No- Tadaork- Not that- Todoroki! The fire and ice guy!</i>\u2019 </p><p>Almost ashamed she hadn\u2019t even paid enough attention to recall the winners names. Andi was momentarily caught off guard seeing something drip off his face. Recalling his affinity for that overly power ice attacks she reckoned it must be byproduct of his quirk. Ice wasn\u2019t meant to be inside in warm climate controlled air. How hard it must have been being ice AND fire. A constant battle of hoping one don\u2019t fire up or drench their clothes. Sure she\u2019s just passing by, Andi made to walk on her way when the 1 A student raises his arm and wipes away at his face. </p><p>She blinks mid stare. That wasn\u2019t melting ice. He was crying. </p><p>Silently sure but looking harder reveals how upsettingly right she is. Not many but a dotting trail of tears on his paper. Though the B class student couldn\u2019t see what the paper was but knew the dread of crying over a test. She\u2019d had her fair share of waterworks herself over tests.\u00a0</p><p>Engulfed in leaning into the door frame trying to guess what was wrong. While also being heart stricken that even a second place winner was crying. Andi wasn\u2019t mindful of her quirk as her thoughts wander.</p><p>Unlike those with malice mind quirks. Such as brainwashing or putting people to sleep. Hers was almost always seen as a novelty. Thought mostly done on purpose, the girls mind projected like a blanket. Not terribly far but enough people within combat range reported feeling it. To a sensation of calmness or contentedness. Andi had found out if battling hard enough that calming effect could be changed to an addling effect. Which posed better use during a fight. Sadly though she hadn\u2019t learned how to switch between a comforting projection or a confusion one. </p><p>This was one of those times she wasn\u2019t aware she was doing it at all. Forlorn just to see someone distressed her thoughts were a ramble but they still sought out like tendrils for the nearest life form. Not evening noticing she was doing anything until Andi saw Todoroki lean up from his paper and touch his cheeks. Where he\u2019d felt stray tears were now suddenly gone. That overwhelming loathsome string of thoughts in his mind nearly all gone. Not like he\u2019d forgotten what had upset him. But that they just seemed so, insignificant now. Replaced with a gentle calmness in regards to nothing the 1 A student ever felt. </p><p>Todoroki looked from his desk to the open classroom door. She was busted. Suddenly realizing that bad habit of letting her mind wander happened all too much. Clasping hands over her mouth like words actually had anything to do with it. Andi jerked back with a thudding heart hoping he hadn\u2019t seen her. </p><p>\u201c\u2026.A mind quirk,\u201d Todoroki\u2019s low voice filled the space between, \u201cThat\u2019s not something we see a lot here at UA is it?\u201d He cast his heterochromia eyes over to the door where he knew the intruder was, \u201cAnd for one so kind willed, it\u2019s a wonder you want to be a hero.\u201d</p><p><b>Busted</b>.</p><p>Knowing there was no way to play off that he had the wrong person now. Andi stepped into the doorway. Fist clenching her bag straps afraid what he might do if he interrupted her as spying, \u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t trying to watch you or anything. Honestly, I just done moving things for class 1 B and didn\u2019t expect\u2026.well didn\u2019t expect to see anyone else here this late either.\u201d Attempting to play it off as cool she laughed light heartedly rubbing the back of her head, \u201cEspecially from class 1 A! I thought you guys all dashed out of here the moment the bell rang!\u201d</p><p>He looked back down at the paper in front of him. What was a pitiful excuse for a joke failed and Andi felt her dread setting in. He probably really did think she was snooping around after hours now. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d His words surprised her even though he didn\u2019t look up at the girl. They were certainly meant towards her.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Andi stopped playing the cool act with his unexpected words, \u201cI uh no I didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was quite upset about this test score,\u201d Todoroki turned his face away from the paper and to the student in the doorway, \u201cWith as much prep as I\u2019d done it had blindsided me that Mr. Aizawa marked as many wrong as he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh I\u2019m sorry about your test scores\u2026\u201d she shifted a little uncomfortable not following anymore. At this point being caught red handed embarrassed the timidly straightlaced student enough. And didn\u2019t give her a chance to recall her quirk. Without thinking she\u2019d been projecting her feelings right out to the sullen school mate without her own knowledge. </p><p>Todoroki rose from his seat. Placing the no longer important test paper in his pack before stepping up to her. Since she was a second year student she was technically older. But Andi wouldn\u2019t stop cursing high school for all the boys getting their growth spurts now. And she\u2019d topping out at your max height in middle school. A half step back when he came up to her so silently only made Andi fumble in a panic. Just as quick as he was in the festival battles. The young fire and ice hero grabbed her wrist and helped her step back onto two solid feet.</p><p>\u201cOh- Uh thanks-\u201d she smiled sheepishly rubbing the back of her head, \u201cGuess that makes us even now.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki looked this new individual up and down. His guess right when he recognized her as the second year student who\u2019d made it to round two in the one on one battles. But had been beat by one of his own classmates due to speed and the inability to pitch a mind quirk to a hero who only needed mere seconds to push one out of the ring. She had done well and put up a fight. For that other students including the second place one had noticed.</p><p>\u201cAndi Meyier right? That quirk,\u201d Todoroki studied her, \u201cIt calms people?\u201d</p><p>Not expecting to have him ask about it. She nodded seeing he got half of it right, \u201cYes, for the most part. But sadly not like hypnosis.That would be more useful in a fight. I\u2019ve been able to project a few other stronger emotions but not with an regularity to make in part of my arsenal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could make someone feel sad, or angry, happy or jealous?\u201d Todoroki through out options trying to pin point her exactly.</p><p>For those guesses she had to shake her head no, \u201cNot so much. I can confuse mostly, leaving someone stunned or unable to react to a situation. But like I said, the calming affect is all I\u2019ve really got.\u201d Andi looked down at her hand. Thinking this school would bring out more in her. Two years had gone by and she was really starting to wonder if this was a hero quirk at all. So many other helpful things could be done with it. But here she was being selfish and wanting to become a hero. It gnawed at her day in and day out if this was the right choice.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice snapped her from the latent trail of thoughts in her mind. Andi looked from her hand up to him. Heat creeping on her cheeks as he was vividly and clearly studying her. Nearly about to break away and end this before she embarrassed herself anymore. He had something surprising to add, \u201cWould you like to study together?\u201d</p><p>Floored even that a 1 A student wanted to study with someone who hardly past as a support hero on a good day. She nearly gagged on the flood of words that fight to make it out of her mouth at the same time. No more abashed by that nonverbal response Todoroki still enjoyed the effects of the female\u2019s calming ability and explained further, \u201cWhen I studied for this test I was riled up. My thoughts got the best of me and this grading period suffered from it.If you can help me retain a calm mindset to study, I\u2019d be more than happy to return the favor and help you physically train.\u201d Andi\u2019s face full on heated up. No way now to deny her own prattling lucid thoughts before really did give her away. The embarrassment seemed to only be one sided thought which helped. Todoroki looked at her unphased, \u201cIt would be even, that way.\u201d</p><p>Given an opportunity to train with those going pro was undeniable one of the best chances she had at getting to where she wanted. PE class just couldn\u2019t cut it and Andi didn\u2019t know enough about physical combat to set up a workout regimen that would do her the max good. And here she was being offered help by a literal runner up to the UA festival. Maybe her face gave it away. Or perhaps still her mind was wandered too much around this fellow for her own good.</p><p>But as placid as his expression stayed. The corner of Todoroki\u2019s lip curled up and he placed a hand on her shoulder, \u201cGood. Meet me outside the cram building tomorrow at eight o'clock. We can begin then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?? Eight o'clock??\u201d Andi nearly choked not realizing he wanted to start right away on this barter for quirk deals. </p><p>Todoroki stopped only a few steps pasted her and cocked his head back to the older student, \u201cWe both clearly don\u2019t have any plans with friends or family. That much I could gather from your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Fire engine red cheeks, Andi half covered her face like she could shove her quirk back in her brain and make it stop embarrassing herself, \u201cY-Yes! Tomorrow at eight! I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Again unable to help the curl of a faint smile on his lips Todoroki at least turned back away so he wouldn\u2019t give himself away, \u201cGood. I look forward to seeing what we can make of this.\u201d</p>",

It gnawed at her day in and day out if this was the right choice.</p><p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Todoroki&rsquo;s voice snapped her from the latent trail of thoughts in her mind. Andi looked from her hand up to him. Heat creeping on her cheeks as he was vividly and clearly studying her. Nearly about to break away and end this before she embarrassed herself anymore. He had something surprising to add, &ldquo;Would you like to study together?&rdquo;</p><p>Floored even that a 1 A student wanted to study with someone who hardly past as a support hero on a good day. She nearly gagged on the flood of words that fight to make it out of her mouth at the same time. No more abashed by that nonverbal response Todoroki still enjoyed the effects of the female&rsquo;s calming ability and explained further, &ldquo;When I studied for this test I was riled up. My thoughts got the best of me and this grading period suffered from it.If you can help me retain a calm mindset to study, I&rsquo;d be more than happy to return the favor and help you physically train.&rdquo; Andi&rsquo;s face full on heated up. No way now to deny her own prattling lucid thoughts before really did give her away. The embarrassment seemed to only be one sided thought which helped. Todoroki looked at her unphased, &ldquo;It would be even, that way.&rdquo;</p><p>Given an opportunity to train with those going pro was undeniable one of the best chances she had at getting to where she wanted. PE class just couldn&rsquo;t cut it and Andi didn&rsquo;t know enough about physical combat to set up a workout regimen that would do her the max good. And here she was being offered help by a literal runner up to the UA festival. Maybe her face gave it away. Or perhaps still her mind was wandered too much around this fellow for her own good.</p><p>But as placid as his expression stayed. The corner of Todoroki&rsquo;s lip curled up and he placed a hand on her shoulder, &ldquo;Good. Meet me outside the cram building tomorrow at eight o'clock. We can begin then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow?? Eight o'clock??&rdquo; Andi nearly choked not realizing he wanted to start right away on this barter for quirk deals. </p><p>Todoroki stopped only a few steps pasted her and cocked his head back to the older student, &ldquo;We both clearly don&rsquo;t have any plans with friends or family. That much I could gather from your thoughts.&rdquo;</p><p>Fire engine red cheeks, Andi half covered her face like she could shove her quirk back in her brain and make it stop embarrassing herself, &ldquo;Y-Yes! Tomorrow at eight! I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p><p>Again unable to help the curl of a faint smile on his lips Todoroki at least turned back away so he wouldn&rsquo;t give himself away, &ldquo;Good. I look forward to seeing what we can make of this.&rdquo;</p>",
