Of course, the possibility of a romance with Captain America was something you only entertained in your sweetest dreams, but you supposed it was okay to fantasise&hellip; </p><p>\u201cOh Captain, my Captain,\u201d you retort, sultrily, \u201cWe are only just beginning.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better finish up then because we have a job to do&hellip;\u201d</p><p>You can hear the smile in his tone, a touch of playfulness that seems to soften his scolding. </p><p>You shift in the bar stool, the delicate, smooth skin of your leg peeking out from the long slit in your satin, gold dress. You feel dozens of eyes swivel over your body appreciatively, drinking you in like golden champagne. In your previous life, that would have been the effect you were after. But tonight, you\u2019re not here to steal hearts, only biochemical weapons. </p><p>\u201cWhile you guys are having fun flirting and drinking champagne, I\u2019ve actually been working,\u201d Sams voice bites into your ear, his tone mingled amusement and exasperation, \u201cI\u2019ve scouted the area. Our escape route doesn\u2019t seem to be affected by the additional security.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be saying that if you were in here with me,\u201d Natasha snaps. </p><p>\u201cClint, what\u2019s your status?\u201d Steve asks. </p><p>\u201cIm in position, Cap,\u201d Clint answers from a neighbouring rooftop, \u201cEnjoying the view from up here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need you on the ground with Romanoff,\u201d Steve orders, \u201cI\u2019m moving into position.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back on a last name basis?\u201d Natasha says, the hum of her Widows venom buzzing in your ear, \u201cWell that\u2019s cold.\u201d </p><p>You take another languid sip of champagne, taking in your surroundings. </p><p>Classical music swells from the orchestra, climbing up the wobbly, tumultuous ladder of a chilling crescendo as you watch the wealthy mingle with one another, shrill, careless laughter echoing. There was once a time when you were with them, either running a con or planning a heist. You never imagined that you\u2019d be thrust back into this world again as an Avenger. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d Steve asks, his voice softening just slightly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in position,\u201d you answer, swirling your flute of champagne elegantly, \u201cWaiting for your signal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Steve commends, his voice sounding warm and clear, \u201cBy the way, gold really is your colour.\u201d</p><p>Your heart leaps into your throat as you turn, surveying the room. Steve is in the corner, dressed up like a daydream as he stares at you from across the room. </p><p>Your gazes clash. </p><p>Your heart freezes. </p><p>Steve crosses the room, sliding into the vacant stool next to you. </p><p>You recover quickly, ironing out your posture as you try to bury your emotions beneath a nonchalant mask. </p><p>\u201cThat was quick&hellip;\u201d you murmur, and Clint snorts. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it\u2014\u201d Sam warns through the comms, but Clint is already speaking. </p><p>\u201c\u2014Title of your sex tape.\u201d </p><p>A smirk curls around your lips, meeting Steve\u2019s eyes for one charged moment, \u201cOh Clint, that\u2019s certainly not the title of <i>my</i> sex tape&hellip;\u201d </p><p>An adorable shade of pink dusts the apples of Steve\u2019s cheeks and he quickly averts his gaze. Tilting your head at Steve, a simpering smile sprawls across your lips. </p><p>\u201c<b>What\u2019s the matter, sweetie? </b>Cat got your tongue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know,\u201d Steve glances at you, a hint of a smile tugging at the ends of his mouth. His expression straightens and he looks around, \u201cSeen Dawson anywhere?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d you smirk smugly, \u201cHe\u2019s still knocked out in the closet I left him in.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiles, regarding you warmly. There\u2019s an intensity in his eyes that you can\u2019t quite place, a sense of longing that makes the base of your spine tingle warmly. </p><p>\u201cI got eyes on the weapon.\u201d </p><p>Natasha\u2019s voice shatters the moment. Steve shakes his head, drawing himself out of a lingering gaze. </p><p>\u201cExcellent. Sam, where are you at with the security situation?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWorking on it,\u201d Sam grunts, slamming a guard into a wall. </p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m with Nat now,\u201d Clint adds, panting slightly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting too old for this game, Barton,\u201d you quip and you hear Clint sigh. </p><p>\u201cYou bet I am.\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) and I will extract the plans from Dawson\u2019s diary,\u201d Steve mutters into his comm, \u201cWe will meet at the rendezvous point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCopy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCopy that, Cap.\u201d </p><p>Steve nods purposefully and the two of you glide smoothly off the dance floor, edging toward the closed off hallway inconspicuously. </p><p>After swiftly evading the security personnel, you finally arrive at Dawson\u2019s private study. Recalling the blueprint you had stolen earlier, you locate the secret passage and enter through a hidden door, scaling down a spiral staircase until you reach the secret, underground lair. </p><p>\u201cWell if this doesn\u2019t scream cliche James-Bond-style villain lair, I don\u2019t know what else does,\u201d you retort, sauntering into the cold, damp lair. </p><p>The two of you split off into opposite directions, silently rushing around the room in search of the diary. </p><p>Steve dashes forward, moving briskly, until he finds a locked drawer. Using his superhuman strength, he wrenches the door open and steals Dawson\u2019s diary; a heavy tome with a large, metal bracket locking it into place. You and Steve exchange a look. </p><p>\u201cThink you can break into it?\u201d Steve asks, raising a questioning brow at you. You grin. </p><p>\u201cFinally, I get to do something fun around here,\u201d you quip, a sharp blade of crackling psychic energy shooting out from your palm. You neatly slice through the lock, the jaws unhinging with a click and a hiss, clanging loudly onto the floor. </p><p>You gaze at the book, teeth digging into your bottom lip. How many times had you used your gift to steal, and yet now you were using your abilities to save the world? It was a startling realisation that had crossed your mind hundreds of times over the past year or so since you had joined the Avengers as a criminal searching for redemption. </p><p>\u201cI never thought&hellip;\u201d you whisper under your breath, trailing off into silence. </p><p>\u201cNever thought what?\u201d Steve asks from the opposite side of the room and you glance back at him, momentarily forgetting about his superhuman hearing. </p><p>\u201cI just&hellip;\u201d you begin, unsure of how to phrase the emotions you\u2019ve bottled up inside of you, \u201c&hellip;I\u2019m still adjusting to the whole \u2018Avengers\u2019 thing&hellip;\u201d </p><p>Steve pauses, hesitating, gazing at you with so much hidden meaning, you think for a moment that you must have imagined it. Just as you think he\u2019s not going to speak&hellip;</p><p>\u201cChange always takes some getting used to, trust me, I know,\u201d Steve takes a step toward you, blue eyes genuine and unguarded as they consider you carefully, \u201cBut friends always make it easier and - well - you have us&hellip;\u201d </p><p>You clamp your bottom lip between your teeth, biting down on a sincere smile, \u201cI\u2019m - well - I\u2019m <b>not here to make friends.\u201d</b></p><p>Steve slides a hand through his hair, \u201cYou can\u2019t isolate yourself forever.\u201d </p><p>You shrug, eyes not quite meeting his, \u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be forever, just until I\u2019m sure about this&hellip;\u201d </p><p>Steve frowns, expression rippling, \u201cYou\u2019re not sure about us? About&hellip;\u201d he trails off, blushing. </p><p>\u201cNo, not at all! Just, well, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m not&hellip;worthy of this&hellip;\u201d </p><p>Steve crosses the room, resting a warm hand on your shoulder as he ducks his gaze, peering into your eyes with a piercing gaze, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to doubt yourself, (Y/N). Just you being here is enough, enough for everyone and enough for me.\u201d </p><p>His hand lingers, and there\u2019s so much sincerity in the clear, ceraluen depths of his eyes, you almost believe him. And then his fingers start to trail up your neck, calloused tips dancing across your skin until they tangle around a loose strand of hair and you melt into his touch, embracing it. You\u2019re drawn to him, stepping closer, until you can connect the green flecks in his eyes like constellations, and your eyes flutter closed for a moment, his voice leaking into your mind, into your inner ear, crystal clear and overflowing with hidden yearning. </p><p><i>&hellip;Kiss her&hellip;</i></p><p>Without really thinking, you step forward, pressing your lips to Steve\u2019s in a gentle kiss. Steve immediately responds, cupping your face with strong hands as he groans against your lips, his tongue gliding across the bottom cushion of your lip. You moan in response, parting your lips, and you taste champagne and mint and a hint of whiskey, and it\u2019s like tasting sunlight in the early mornings, the ones you love the most, and you arch into him, raking your fingers through his hair and tugging him closer, closer, <i>closer</i>.</p><p>\u201cErm&hellip;you guys still there?\u201d</p><p>Distantly, Sams voice breaks into your consciousness and you groan, reluctantly breaking away from Steve with an irritated sigh. </p><p>\u201cWe were kind of having a moment here, Wilson,\u201d you snap, and Sams chortles trickle into your ear. </p><p>Plucking the comm from your ear, you carelessly toss it onto the desk with a smirk. Steve\u2019s brows nearly graze his hairline, but he copies you anyway, and with a smirk, you step toward him. </p><p>\u201cNow, where were we?\u201d </p><p>****</p>",

Using his superhuman strength, he wrenches the door open and steals Dawson\u2019s diary; a heavy tome with a large, metal bracket locking it into place. You and Steve exchange a look. </p><p>\u201cThink you can break into it?\u201d Steve asks, raising a questioning brow at you. You grin. </p><p>\u201cFinally, I get to do something fun around here,\u201d you quip, a sharp blade of crackling psychic energy shooting out from your palm. You neatly slice through the lock, the jaws unhinging with a click and a hiss, clanging loudly onto the floor. </p><p>You gaze at the book, teeth digging into your bottom lip. How many times had you used your gift to steal, and yet now you were using your abilities to save the world? It was a startling realisation that had crossed your mind hundreds of times over the past year or so since you had joined the Avengers as a criminal searching for redemption. </p><p>\u201cI never thought\u2026\u201d you whisper under your breath, trailing off into silence. </p><p>\u201cNever thought what?\u201d Steve asks from the opposite side of the room and you glance back at him, momentarily forgetting about his superhuman hearing. </p><p>\u201cI just\u2026\u201d you begin, unsure of how to phrase the emotions you\u2019ve bottled up inside of you, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m still adjusting to the whole \u2018Avengers\u2019 thing\u2026\u201d </p><p>Steve pauses, hesitating, gazing at you with so much hidden meaning, you think for a moment that you must have imagined it. Just as you think he\u2019s not going to speak\u2026</p><p>\u201cChange always takes some getting used to, trust me, I know,\u201d Steve takes a step toward you, blue eyes genuine and unguarded as they consider you carefully, \u201cBut friends always make it easier and - well - you have us\u2026\u201d </p><p>You clamp your bottom lip between your teeth, biting down on a sincere smile, \u201cI\u2019m - well - I\u2019m <b>not here to make friends.\u201d</b></p><p>Steve slides a hand through his hair, \u201cYou can\u2019t isolate yourself forever.\u201d </p><p>You shrug, eyes not quite meeting his, \u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be forever, just until I\u2019m sure about this\u2026\u201d </p><p>Steve frowns, expression rippling, \u201cYou\u2019re not sure about us? About\u2026\u201d he trails off, blushing. </p><p>\u201cNo, not at all! Just, well, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m not\u2026worthy of this\u2026\u201d </p><p>Steve crosses the room, resting a warm hand on your shoulder as he ducks his gaze, peering into your eyes with a piercing gaze, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to doubt yourself, (Y/N). Just you being here is enough, enough for everyone and enough for me.\u201d </p><p>His hand lingers, and there\u2019s so much sincerity in the clear, ceraluen depths of his eyes, you almost believe him. And then his fingers start to trail up your neck, calloused tips dancing across your skin until they tangle around a loose strand of hair and you melt into his touch, embracing it. You\u2019re drawn to him, stepping closer, until you can connect the green flecks in his eyes like constellations, and your eyes flutter closed for a moment, his voice leaking into your mind, into your inner ear, crystal clear and overflowing with hidden yearning. </p><p><i>\u2026Kiss her\u2026</i></p><p>Without really thinking, you step forward, pressing your lips to Steve\u2019s in a gentle kiss. Steve immediately responds, cupping your face with strong hands as he groans against your lips, his tongue gliding across the bottom cushion of your lip. You moan in response, parting your lips, and you taste champagne and mint and a hint of whiskey, and it\u2019s like tasting sunlight in the early mornings, the ones you love the most, and you arch into him, raking your fingers through his hair and tugging him closer, closer, <i>closer</i>.</p><p>\u201cErm\u2026you guys still there?\u201d</p><p>Distantly, Sams voice breaks into your consciousness and you groan, reluctantly breaking away from Steve with an irritated sigh. </p><p>\u201cWe were kind of having a moment here, Wilson,\u201d you snap, and Sams chortles trickle into your ear. </p><p>Plucking the comm from your ear, you carelessly toss it onto the desk with a smirk.

Of course, the possibility of a romance with Captain America was something you only entertained in your sweetest dreams, but you supposed it was okay to fantasise\u2026 </p><p>\u201cOh Captain, my Captain,\u201d you retort, sultrily, \u201cWe are only just beginning.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better finish up then because we have a job to do\u2026\u201d</p><p>You can hear the smile in his tone, a touch of playfulness that seems to soften his scolding. </p><p>You shift in the bar stool, the delicate, smooth skin of your leg peeking out from the long slit in your satin, gold dress. You feel dozens of eyes swivel over your body appreciatively, drinking you in like golden champagne. In your previous life, that would have been the effect you were after. But tonight, you\u2019re not here to steal hearts, only biochemical weapons. </p><p>\u201cWhile you guys are having fun flirting and drinking champagne, I\u2019ve actually been working,\u201d Sams voice bites into your ear, his tone mingled amusement and exasperation, \u201cI\u2019ve scouted the area. Our escape route doesn\u2019t seem to be affected by the additional security.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be saying that if you were in here with me,\u201d Natasha snaps. </p><p>\u201cClint, what\u2019s your status?\u201d Steve asks. </p><p>\u201cIm in position, Cap,\u201d Clint answers from a neighbouring rooftop, \u201cEnjoying the view from up here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need you on the ground with Romanoff,\u201d Steve orders, \u201cI\u2019m moving into position.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back on a last name basis?\u201d Natasha says, the hum of her Widows venom buzzing in your ear, \u201cWell that\u2019s cold.\u201d </p><p>You take another languid sip of champagne, taking in your surroundings. </p><p>Classical music swells from the orchestra, climbing up the wobbly, tumultuous ladder of a chilling crescendo as you watch the wealthy mingle with one another, shrill, careless laughter echoing. There was once a time when you were with them, either running a con or planning a heist. You never imagined that you\u2019d be thrust back into this world again as an Avenger. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d Steve asks, his voice softening just slightly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in position,\u201d you answer, swirling your flute of champagne elegantly, \u201cWaiting for your signal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Steve commends, his voice sounding warm and clear, \u201cBy the way, gold really is your colour.\u201d</p><p>Your heart leaps into your throat as you turn, surveying the room. Steve is in the corner, dressed up like a daydream as he stares at you from across the room. </p><p>Your gazes clash. </p><p>Your heart freezes. </p><p>Steve crosses the room, sliding into the vacant stool next to you. </p><p>You recover quickly, ironing out your posture as you try to bury your emotions beneath a nonchalant mask. </p><p>\u201cThat was quick\u2026\u201d you murmur, and Clint snorts. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it\u2014\u201d Sam warns through the comms, but Clint is already speaking. </p><p>\u201c\u2014Title of your sex tape.\u201d </p><p>A smirk curls around your lips, meeting Steve\u2019s eyes for one charged moment, \u201cOh Clint, that\u2019s certainly not the title of <i>my</i> sex tape\u2026\u201d </p><p>An adorable shade of pink dusts the apples of Steve\u2019s cheeks and he quickly averts his gaze. Tilting your head at Steve, a simpering smile sprawls across your lips. </p><p>\u201c<b>What\u2019s the matter, sweetie? </b>Cat got your tongue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know,\u201d Steve glances at you, a hint of a smile tugging at the ends of his mouth. His expression straightens and he looks around, \u201cSeen Dawson anywhere?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d you smirk smugly, \u201cHe\u2019s still knocked out in the closet I left him in.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiles, regarding you warmly. There\u2019s an intensity in his eyes that you can\u2019t quite place, a sense of longing that makes the base of your spine tingle warmly. </p><p>\u201cI got eyes on the weapon.\u201d </p><p>Natasha\u2019s voice shatters the moment. Steve shakes his head, drawing himself out of a lingering gaze. </p><p>\u201cExcellent. Sam, where are you at with the security situation?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWorking on it,\u201d Sam grunts, slamming a guard into a wall. </p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m with Nat now,\u201d Clint adds, panting slightly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting too old for this game, Barton,\u201d you quip and you hear Clint sigh. </p><p>\u201cYou bet I am.\u201d </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) and I will extract the plans from Dawson\u2019s diary,\u201d Steve mutters into his comm, \u201cWe will meet at the rendezvous point.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCopy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCopy that, Cap.\u201d </p><p>Steve nods purposefully and the two of you glide smoothly off the dance floor, edging toward the closed off hallway inconspicuously. </p><p>After swiftly evading the security personnel, you finally arrive at Dawson\u2019s private study.

Of course, the possibility of a romance with Captain America was something you only entertained in your sweetest dreams, but you supposed it was okay to fantasise&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh Captain, my Captain,&rdquo; you retort, sultrily, &ldquo;We are only just beginning.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better finish up then because we have a job to do&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You can hear the smile in his tone, a touch of playfulness that seems to soften his scolding. </p><p>You shift in the bar stool, the delicate, smooth skin of your leg peeking out from the long slit in your satin, gold dress. You feel dozens of eyes swivel over your body appreciatively, drinking you in like golden champagne. In your previous life, that would have been the effect you were after. But tonight, you&rsquo;re not here to steal hearts, only biochemical weapons. </p><p>&ldquo;While you guys are having fun flirting and drinking champagne, I&rsquo;ve actually been working,&rdquo; Sams voice bites into your ear, his tone mingled amusement and exasperation, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve scouted the area. Our escape route doesn&rsquo;t seem to be affected by the additional security.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be saying that if you were in here with me,&rdquo; Natasha snaps. </p><p>&ldquo;Clint, what&rsquo;s your status?&rdquo; Steve asks. </p><p>&ldquo;Im in position, Cap,&rdquo; Clint answers from a neighbouring rooftop, &ldquo;Enjoying the view from up here.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need you on the ground with Romanoff,&rdquo; Steve orders, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m moving into position.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re back on a last name basis?&rdquo; Natasha says, the hum of her Widows venom buzzing in your ear, &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo; </p><p>You take another languid sip of champagne, taking in your surroundings. </p><p>Classical music swells from the orchestra, climbing up the wobbly, tumultuous ladder of a chilling crescendo as you watch the wealthy mingle with one another, shrill, careless laughter echoing. There was once a time when you were with them, either running a con or planning a heist. You never imagined that you&rsquo;d be thrust back into this world again as an Avenger. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)?&rdquo; Steve asks, his voice softening just slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in position,&rdquo; you answer, swirling your flute of champagne elegantly, &ldquo;Waiting for your signal.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Steve commends, his voice sounding warm and clear, &ldquo;By the way, gold really is your colour.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart leaps into your throat as you turn, surveying the room. Steve is in the corner, dressed up like a daydream as he stares at you from across the room. </p><p>Your gazes clash. </p><p>Your heart freezes. </p><p>Steve crosses the room, sliding into the vacant stool next to you. </p><p>You recover quickly, ironing out your posture as you try to bury your emotions beneath a nonchalant mask. </p><p>&ldquo;That was quick&hellip;&rdquo; you murmur, and Clint snorts. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it&mdash;&rdquo; Sam warns through the comms, but Clint is already speaking. </p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Title of your sex tape.&rdquo; </p><p>A smirk curls around your lips, meeting Steve&rsquo;s eyes for one charged moment, &ldquo;Oh Clint, that&rsquo;s certainly not the title of <i>my</i> sex tape&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>An adorable shade of pink dusts the apples of Steve&rsquo;s cheeks and he quickly averts his gaze. Tilting your head at Steve, a simpering smile sprawls across your lips. </p><p>&ldquo;<b>What&rsquo;s the matter, sweetie? </b>Cat got your tongue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know,&rdquo; Steve glances at you, a hint of a smile tugging at the ends of his mouth. His expression straightens and he looks around, &ldquo;Seen Dawson anywhere?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; you smirk smugly, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s still knocked out in the closet I left him in.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiles, regarding you warmly. There&rsquo;s an intensity in his eyes that you can&rsquo;t quite place, a sense of longing that makes the base of your spine tingle warmly. </p><p>&ldquo;I got eyes on the weapon.&rdquo; </p><p>Natasha&rsquo;s voice shatters the moment. Steve shakes his head, drawing himself out of a lingering gaze. </p><p>&ldquo;Excellent. Sam, where are you at with the security situation?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Working on it,&rdquo; Sam grunts, slamming a guard into a wall. </p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m with Nat now,&rdquo; Clint adds, panting slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting too old for this game, Barton,&rdquo; you quip and you hear Clint sigh. </p><p>&ldquo;You bet I am.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) and I will extract the plans from Dawson&rsquo;s diary,&rdquo; Steve mutters into his comm, &ldquo;We will meet at the rendezvous point.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Copy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Copy that, Cap.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve nods purposefully and the two of you glide smoothly off the dance floor, edging toward the closed off hallway inconspicuously. </p><p>After swiftly evading the security personnel, you finally arrive at Dawson&rsquo;s private study. Recalling the blueprint you had stolen earlier, you locate the secret passage and enter through a hidden door, scaling down a spiral staircase until you reach the secret, underground lair. </p><p>&ldquo;Well if this doesn&rsquo;t scream cliche James-Bond-style villain lair, I don&rsquo;t know what else does,&rdquo; you retort, sauntering into the cold, damp lair. </p><p>The two of you split off into opposite directions, silently rushing around the room in search of the diary. </p><p>Steve dashes forward, moving briskly, until he finds a locked drawer. Using his superhuman strength, he wrenches the door open and steals Dawson&rsquo;s diary; a heavy tome with a large, metal bracket locking it into place. You and Steve exchange a look. </p><p>&ldquo;Think you can break into it?&rdquo; Steve asks, raising a questioning brow at you. You grin. </p><p>&ldquo;Finally, I get to do something fun around here,&rdquo; you quip, a sharp blade of crackling psychic energy shooting out from your palm. You neatly slice through the lock, the jaws unhinging with a click and a hiss, clanging loudly onto the floor. </p><p>You gaze at the book, teeth digging into your bottom lip. How many times had you used your gift to steal, and yet now you were using your abilities to save the world? It was a startling realisation that had crossed your mind hundreds of times over the past year or so since you had joined the Avengers as a criminal searching for redemption. </p><p>&ldquo;I never thought&hellip;&rdquo; you whisper under your breath, trailing off into silence. </p><p>&ldquo;Never thought what?&rdquo; Steve asks from the opposite side of the room and you glance back at him, momentarily forgetting about his superhuman hearing. </p><p>&ldquo;I just&hellip;&rdquo; you begin, unsure of how to phrase the emotions you&rsquo;ve bottled up inside of you, &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m still adjusting to the whole &lsquo;Avengers&rsquo; thing&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Steve pauses, hesitating, gazing at you with so much hidden meaning, you think for a moment that you must have imagined it. Just as you think he&rsquo;s not going to speak&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Change always takes some getting used to, trust me, I know,&rdquo; Steve takes a step toward you, blue eyes genuine and unguarded as they consider you carefully, &ldquo;But friends always make it easier and - well - you have us&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You clamp your bottom lip between your teeth, biting down on a sincere smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m - well - I&rsquo;m <b>not here to make friends.&rdquo;</b></p><p>Steve slides a hand through his hair, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t isolate yourself forever.&rdquo; </p><p>You shrug, eyes not quite meeting his, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t have to be forever, just until I&rsquo;m sure about this&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Steve frowns, expression rippling, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sure about us? About&hellip;&rdquo; he trails off, blushing. </p><p>&ldquo;No, not at all! Just, well, sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m not&hellip;worthy of this&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Steve crosses the room, resting a warm hand on your shoulder as he ducks his gaze, peering into your eyes with a piercing gaze, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to doubt yourself, (Y/N). Just you being here is enough, enough for everyone and enough for me.&rdquo; </p><p>His hand lingers, and there&rsquo;s so much sincerity in the clear, ceraluen depths of his eyes, you almost believe him. And then his fingers start to trail up your neck, calloused tips dancing across your skin until they tangle around a loose strand of hair and you melt into his touch, embracing it. You&rsquo;re drawn to him, stepping closer, until you can connect the green flecks in his eyes like constellations, and your eyes flutter closed for a moment, his voice leaking into your mind, into your inner ear, crystal clear and overflowing with hidden yearning. </p><p><i>&hellip;Kiss her&hellip;</i></p><p>Without really thinking, you step forward, pressing your lips to Steve&rsquo;s in a gentle kiss. Steve immediately responds, cupping your face with strong hands as he groans against your lips, his tongue gliding across the bottom cushion of your lip. You moan in response, parting your lips, and you taste champagne and mint and a hint of whiskey, and it&rsquo;s like tasting sunlight in the early mornings, the ones you love the most, and you arch into him, raking your fingers through his hair and tugging him closer, closer, <i>closer</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Erm&hellip;you guys still there?&rdquo;</p><p>Distantly, Sams voice breaks into your consciousness and you groan, reluctantly breaking away from Steve with an irritated sigh. </p><p>&ldquo;We were kind of having a moment here, Wilson,&rdquo; you snap, and Sams chortles trickle into your ear. </p><p>Plucking the comm from your ear, you carelessly toss it onto the desk with a smirk. Steve&rsquo;s brows nearly graze his hairline, but he copies you anyway, and with a smirk, you step toward him. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, where were we?&rdquo; </p><p>****</p></p>",

I don\u2019t feel like you can really see one without the other, or at least if you did, it wouldn\u2019t be as satisfying. I am excited to eventually watch these films back-to-back, to see if I am right.\u00a0</p><p>When thinking about them as two, separate films though, I have to admit that I liked <b>Avengers:</b>\u00a0<b>Infinity War</b>\u00a0more.\u00a0It is true that I am typically a fan of big ensemble fight scenes and happy endings, both of which we got more of in Endgame compared to Infinity War, however, I found myself more impressed with structure of the story for Infinity War. Endgame is great, but it felt a little less fluid and more like three mini-arcs (the Garden, the Time-Heist, the Big Fight), compared to the fluidly, intertwined story that we gone in Infinity War.</p><p>All that being said,<b> Avengers: Endgame </b>was a fantastic film and thus it is now the second film in my MCU ranking. There is almost too much to say about it, but to me, it gives you everything you could want in a superhero film and more. There was so much fan-service, and I am 100% okay with that. While I can\u2019t get into everything, I do want to give a few kudos:</p><ul><li>I loved that the writers found a way of removing Thanos as a threat in the beginning of film, only to bring him back in a fun and creative way by the end.</li><li>I enjoyed the approach that the writers took with time-travel, and that they even took a moment to try and debunk common theories on the issue. I am excited to see what these ideas of time-travel and alternate realties have on the future of the MCU.\u00a0</li><li>I loved the continued character development for all six main Avengers, growth that is especially impressive when you think about how far they have already come in the last 10 years. We got Family Stark, Avengers Leader Natasha, Thick Thor, Professor Hulk, Ronin, Grandpa Rogers, and eventually the sad, tragic sacrifices of Black Widow and Iron Man.\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>I was impressed with the way that the writers brought back a bunch of characters. The Snap was always going to be reversed, but then we also got a version of Gamora back, and a version of Loki appears to be alive. While I sad for the losses, I am kind of okay that the Avengers couldn\u2019t save everyone, such as Vision or Black Widow*, because then the stakes don\u2019t feel real. (*P.S. - I think Black Widow still might find a way to come back in the future).<br/></li><li>I was surprised and impressed that we got so many cameos from famous, past actors including Frigga (Rene Russo), the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), and Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).\u00a0<br/></li><li>I loved the both obvious and subtle connections to little moments from throughout the MCU, including \u201cHail Hydra\u201d, to Cap being worthy of Mjolnir, to \u201cOn Your Left\u201d, to that final \u201cI am Iron Man\u201d line.\u00a0</li><li>Lastly, but certainly not least, that final fight scene was a cinematic masterpiece. We got all of the heroes I could hope for, with so many great team-ups, and it was shot in such a beautiful way, that even after watching it four times in theaters, I still don\u2019t think I fully caught or could appreciate everything.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Overall, while I was kind of expecting this to be my favorite MCU film, which it turned out not to be, I definitely would not say I was disappointed. I was very happy, not only with this film, but with the way it wrapped up this portion of the MCU. While I am super excited to see what the future has in store, this definitely felt like a exciting, funny, tragic, bittersweet, and satisfying ending.\u00a0</p><h2>NEXT UP is <b>Spider-Man: Far From Home</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"272\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/327a5891388c7619df371dd932a7a89c/tumblr_inline_psnz7iRQFL1r9iq8u_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"272\"/></figure><p>With the<b> Infinity Saga</b> being over, I am partially considering starting over with a new ranking system. If I do, that means I won\u2019t do an MCU ranking until three-to-five new films come out, just so I can have enough material to make a new list. I am still thinking it over, and so we will see what happens!\u00a0</p>",

I don\u2019t feel like you can really see one without the other, or at least if you did, it wouldn\u2019t be as satisfying. I am excited to eventually watch these films back-to-back, to see if I am right.\u00a0</p><p>When thinking about them as two, separate films though, I have to admit that I liked <b>Avengers:</b>\u00a0<b>Infinity War</b>\u00a0more.\u00a0It is true that I am typically a fan of big ensemble fight scenes and happy endings, both of which we got more of in Endgame compared to Infinity War, however, I found myself more impressed with structure of the story for Infinity War. Endgame is great, but it felt a little less fluid and more like three mini-arcs (the Garden, the Time-Heist, the Big Fight), compared to the fluidly, intertwined story that we gone in Infinity War.</p><p>All that being said,<b> Avengers: Endgame </b>was a fantastic film and thus it is now the second film in my MCU ranking. There is almost too much to say about it, but to me, it gives you everything you could want in a superhero film and more. There was so much fan-service, and I am 100% okay with that. While I can\u2019t get into everything, I do want to give a few kudos:</p><ul><li>I loved that the writers found a way of removing Thanos as a threat in the beginning of film, only to bring him back in a fun and creative way by the end.</li><li>I enjoyed the approach that the writers took with time-travel, and that they even took a moment to try and debunk common theories on the issue. I am excited to see what these ideas of time-travel and alternate realties have on the future of the MCU.\u00a0</li><li>I loved the continued character development for all six main Avengers, growth that is especially impressive when you think about how far they have already come in the last 10 years. We got Family Stark, Avengers Leader Natasha, Thick Thor, Professor Hulk, Ronin, Grandpa Rogers, and eventually the sad, tragic sacrifices of Black Widow and Iron Man.\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>I was impressed with the way that the writers brought back a bunch of characters. The Snap was always going to be reversed, but then we also got a version of Gamora back, and a version of Loki appears to be alive. While I sad for the losses, I am kind of okay that the Avengers couldn\u2019t save everyone, such as Vision or Black Widow*, because then the stakes don\u2019t feel real. (*P.S. - I think Black Widow still might find a way to come back in the future).<br></li><li>I was surprised and impressed that we got so many cameos from famous, past actors including Frigga (Rene Russo), the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), and Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).\u00a0<br></li><li>I loved the both obvious and subtle connections to little moments from throughout the MCU, including \u201cHail Hydra\u201d, to Cap being worthy of Mjolnir, to \u201cOn Your Left\u201d, to that final \u201cI am Iron Man\u201d line.\u00a0</li><li>Lastly, but certainly not least, that final fight scene was a cinematic masterpiece. We got all of the heroes I could hope for, with so many great team-ups, and it was shot in such a beautiful way, that even after watching it four times in theaters, I still don\u2019t think I fully caught or could appreciate everything.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Overall, while I was kind of expecting this to be my favorite MCU film, which it turned out not to be, I definitely would not say I was disappointed. I was very happy, not only with this film, but with the way it wrapped up this portion of the MCU. While I am super excited to see what the future has in store, this definitely felt like a exciting, funny, tragic, bittersweet, and satisfying ending.\u00a0</p><h2>NEXT UP is <b>Spider-Man: Far From Home</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"272\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/327a5891388c7619df371dd932a7a89c/tumblr_inline_psnz7iRQFL1r9iq8u_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"272\"></figure><p>With the<b> Infinity Saga</b> being over, I am partially considering starting over with a new ranking system. If I do, that means I won\u2019t do an MCU ranking until three-to-five new films come out, just so I can have enough material to make a new list. I am still thinking it over, and so we will see what happens!\u00a0</p></p>",

There is almost too much to say about it, but to me, it gives you everything you could want in a superhero film and more. There was so much fan-service, and I am 100% okay with that. While I can\u2019t get into everything, I do want to give a few kudos:</p><ul><li>I loved that the writers found a way of removing Thanos as a threat in the beginning of film, only to bring him back in a fun and creative way by the end.</li><li>I enjoyed the approach that the writers took with time-travel, and that they even took a moment to try and debunk common theories on the issue. I am excited to see what these ideas of time-travel and alternate realties have on the future of the MCU.\u00a0</li><li>I loved the continued character development for all six main Avengers, growth that is especially impressive when you think about how far they have already come in the last 10 years. We got Family Stark, Avengers Leader Natasha, Thick Thor, Professor Hulk, Ronin, Grandpa Rogers, and eventually the sad, tragic sacrifices of Black Widow and Iron Man.\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>I was impressed with the way that the writers brought back a bunch of characters. The Snap was always going to be reversed, but then we also got a version of Gamora back, and a version of Loki appears to be alive. While I sad for the losses, I am kind of okay that the Avengers couldn\u2019t save everyone, such as Vision or Black Widow*, because then the stakes don\u2019t feel real. (*P.S. - I think Black Widow still might find a way to come back in the future).<br></li><li>I was surprised and impressed that we got so many cameos from famous, past actors including Frigga (Rene Russo), the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), and Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).\u00a0<br></li><li>I loved the both obvious and subtle connections to little moments from throughout the MCU, including \u201cHail Hydra\u201d, to Cap being worthy of Mjolnir, to \u201cOn Your Left\u201d, to that final \u201cI am Iron Man\u201d line.\u00a0</li><li>Lastly, but certainly not least, that final fight scene was a cinematic masterpiece.
