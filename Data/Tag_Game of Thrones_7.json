There are so many leaks, and the ones that the show is following are the worst ones.\u00a0</p><p>I remember reading one leak on Episode 6, is that Jon kills Dany, and then Drogon takes her North, where she is brought back to life, with the help of Bran, and they live there together. I could be wrong, but I vaguely remember something like this. But after watching the preview on Episode 6, and comparing that with Daenerys\u2019s vision in the House of the Undying, I\u2019m getting the feeling that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen. So bear with me:</p><p>Remember when we saw the first time Dany walking through the throne room in the vision, and it was all snowy and ruined? Well, we thought that the NK would eventually come to KL, and the final battle will be held here.

We\u2019re talking about 8 seasons of character development! I was for sure expecting Jaime to kill Cersei, i think pretty much 90% of those who are following the show thought that would happen. Some of us even said\u00a0\u201cgod i hope that won\u2019t happen, it\u2019d be so obvious, but my GOD i wish that had happened now instead of this mess.\u00a0</p><p>Genuinely disregarding 8 seasons of character development, the writers said a big\u00a0\u201cf*ck\u201d u\u201d to Jaime and said\u00a0\u201cyeah let him go back to Cersei with his undying love and just try to escape with her, that\u2019s a good plot, makes sense, correlates with the past seasons too, uhuh, sure\u201d And then we\u2019re going to have to have the Euron goddamn Greyjoy (a literal no-one who has only showed up 1 season ago) vs Jaime fight, which was a mess, it was a joke, then he goes on and says he\u2019s the one who killed Jaime Lannister. Nope bud, the goddamn bricks killed him bye.</p><p>Cersei\u2019s death was also nothing special. At least let someone kill her dear god! Her dying because of bricks, how tragic, boo-f*cking-hoo. Let Dany kill her, if ya\u2019ll wanted to make her the\u00a0\u201cMad Queen\u201d so much, at least go all out, give me some sort of satisfaction at least. But no, she was sitting on her dragon for 5 minutes, then instead of going for Cersei, she just started zigzagging and killing almost everyone she could find.</p><p>The Golden Company too, made no damn sense. First you\u2019re telling me Dany\u00a0\u201cforgot about the golden company\u201d in the previous episode which cost her one of her dragons and almost Drogon too. But now with just one dragon she managed to burn it all to ashes like no big deal. She didn\u2019t even need a special strategy, she just went and burned them and for some reason the golden company was struggling to shoot the dragon.</p><p>Let\u2019s not even talk about Jon, i don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s doing at this point. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll either kill Dany, or Dany will kill him and after that Arya kills Dany because of the ominous speech of hers where she goes \u201cI\u2019m going to kill the queen\u201d. And since Cersei is dead, you guessed it, the queen is Dany, so i\u2019m sure you get where this is going. And this will piss me off even more. Arya has already killed the Night King, if she kills Dany too, i\u2019m just going to lose my shit. I don\u2019t hate her, she\u2019s a decent character, but if you\u2019re going to make Arya do everything groundbreaking in this show, why even bother having other characters literally revived (Aka Jon)?!</p><p>I\u2019m going to ignore the Sandor vs. Zombie big brother fight, it was, once again, a mess.</p><p>Also what the hell was the point of Bran? I still don\u2019t get it. Please someone tell me why he had to go around the world, become a three-eyed-freak, just to see who are Jon\u2019s parents. We don\u2019t need him for that! We already have Sam and his enormous library and his books. Bran was there to confirm that Jon\u2019s father was a good man, which btw doesn\u2019t matter! It\u2019s been an ongoing phrase in the show that\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re not like your father/mother, don\u2019t judge a child for what their parents have done in the past\u201d. So confirming that Jon was born out of love doesn\u2019t matter to the plot what-so-ever.</p><p>Onto what was good in this episode (not much but still): Songs, CGI, the scenery and such, Arya and Sandor\u2019s heart-to-heart, Tyrion and Jaime\u2019s heart-to-heart, and that\u2019s about it.</p><p>One more episode, then it\u2019s over, and i\u2019m erasing this whole season out of my mind, because it\u2019s by far the worst season of GOT and this just shows how the writers don\u2019t give a damn about the plot or the characters anymore.</p>",

Some of us even said\u00a0\u201cgod i hope that won\u2019t happen, it\u2019d be so obvious, but my GOD i wish that had happened now instead of this mess.\u00a0</p><p>Genuinely disregarding 8 seasons of character development, the writers said a big\u00a0\u201cf*ck\u201d u\u201d to Jaime and said\u00a0\u201cyeah let him go back to Cersei with his undying love and just try to escape with her, that\u2019s a good plot, makes sense, correlates with the past seasons too, uhuh, sure\u201d And then we\u2019re going to have to have the Euron goddamn Greyjoy (a literal no-one who has only showed up 1 season ago) vs Jaime fight, which was a mess, it was a joke, then he goes on and says he\u2019s the one who killed Jaime Lannister. Nope bud, the goddamn bricks killed him bye.</p><p>Cersei\u2019s death was also nothing special. At least let someone kill her dear god! Her dying because of bricks, how tragic, boo-f*cking-hoo. Let Dany kill her, if ya\u2019ll wanted to make her the\u00a0\u201cMad Queen\u201d so much, at least go all out, give me some sort of satisfaction at least. But no, she was sitting on her dragon for 5 minutes, then instead of going for Cersei, she just started zigzagging and killing almost everyone she could find.</p><p>The Golden Company too, made no damn sense. First you\u2019re telling me Dany\u00a0\u201cforgot about the golden company\u201d in the previous episode which cost her one of her dragons and almost Drogon too. But now with just one dragon she managed to burn it all to ashes like no big deal. She didn\u2019t even need a special strategy, she just went and burned them and for some reason the golden company was struggling to shoot the dragon.</p><p>Let\u2019s not even talk about Jon, i don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s doing at this point. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll either kill Dany, or Dany will kill him and after that Arya kills Dany because of the ominous speech of hers where she goes \u201cI\u2019m going to kill the queen\u201d. And since Cersei is dead, you guessed it, the queen is Dany, so i\u2019m sure you get where this is going. And this will piss me off even more. Arya has already killed the Night King, if she kills Dany too, i\u2019m just going to lose my shit.
