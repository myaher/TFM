She laughed about Jon manipulating her to fighting for the North like it was a big joke, but she must have felt embarrassed that she was so impulsive and (lbr) sex-crazed. Not exactly spectacular queen behavior. She knows that she brings nothing to the table beyond her dragons, and even they aren't much. Sansa has loyal allies, resources, brains, and more. She can't compete in the end.",

Most notably, when she asks Jon to honor the pledge his ancestors made for fear of their lives to Aegon and in the same breath accused Jon of his father\u2019s friend\u2019s choices and asks that she not be judged by her father\u2019s sin all in the same scene. </p><p>I really don\u2019t think she has enough self awareness at the moment to truly look back and reflect on her style of ruling compared to others because she simply believes her rule is the best. \n\nHer ambitions are so close to being fulfilled and I really don\u2019t see her being able to acknowledge this fact until it is too late and she becomes the stigma of her name she so desperately wished to break away from. \n\nThere was something tragic in her conversation with Barristan when he brought up the Mad King and in a low voice and a tone more to herself than him says \u201cI\u2019m not my father.\u201d She wants the glory of House Targaryen but none of the dangers that are presented when evoking inner strength from such a legacy. \n\nWith Jon though, he posed no threat to her. He was just a bastard who bent the knee and already gave away his kingdom to her. He was essentially her pet who was ever so devoted and loved her. It was like another Daario expect a more special version. It\u2019s why I think she was so confident to urge he mount her dragons and went to war with him. (Well, at the small fee of the sovereignty of the North) but she seemed so oblivious in her conversation with Sansa when she remarks of who has been manipulating whom. She didn\u2019t even catch on to the implications of this statement and only chuckles along with Sansa. </p>\n\nBut I do think she\u2019s noticing more and more the people that surround Sansa and how Sansa is a woman who commands the respect and loyalty and more importantly, love. She\u2019s never had to deal with a ruler who was loved. Hell, even more loved than she was.",
