He must have read the letter a thousand times. He memorized where the words were blurred with little splotches of water when he first got the letter. He\u2019d run his fingers along the curves of the letters with a shaky finger. He\u2019d never felt so awful in his entire life.</p><p>Absentmindedly, he ended up near Cyrus\u2019 house. He always came over on the weekends, but he hadn\u2019t done that for the last weekend, or even the one before that. He felt miserable all the time; he\u2019d been cutting back from doing things. Last week, he skipped all his basketball practices. He hadn\u2019t gone to tutoring for the past few days. He didn\u2019t eat breakfast this morning because he felt sick to his stomach. All he wanted to do was tell Cyrus how sorry he was.</p><p>Believe him, he\u2019d tried. He called, texted, emailed, and even tried to tape notes to his locker, but to no avail. Cyrus always turned away and tagged on to the nearest person, walking with them. TJ couldn\u2019t blame him, though.</p><p>He folded the letter again on its creases, pressing it into his pocket as he made his way down the driveway of Cyrus\u2019 house. He hesitated before knocking, which wasn\u2019t something he usually did. Cyrus\u2019 parents usually left the door unlocked for him, since they knew he would come over. He wondered if Cyrus told his parents about this. God, he hoped not.</p><p>Soft footsteps could be hear from inside, and TJ said a silent prayer that one of his parents wouldn\u2019t open the door. He heard the door click, and he felt his heart leap into his throat.</p><p>Sure enough, Cyrus was standing on the other side of the door. In the split second that they made eye contact, TJ could see just how tired Cyrus looked; it seemed as though he hadn\u2019t slept for days, and he looked like he was about to collapse at any moment. He inhaled sharply, pressing his lips together.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he managed, blinking a few times.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus replied softly leaning against the doorframe. He sounded so small, and almost afraid; TJ felt like his heart was breaking.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he asked, feeling in his pocket where the letter was. He clenched it in his hand, running his fingers along the edges of the creases.</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, stepping outside and shutting the door behind him. He took a seat on the bench, and TJ sat on the other side, leaving room between them. He really hated how their relationship had changed over the course of a few short weeks. They both sat in uncomfortable silence for a while, until TJ pulled out the piece of paper from his pocket and unfolded it.</p><p>\u201cI got your letter,\u201d he breaks the silence, smoothing out the sheet of paper, \u201cI read it,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, his gaze down at his feet. He wasn\u2019t sure what to say, and he was certain that if he started talking, he\u2019d start crying, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for&hellip;everything,\u201d he said lamely, not really knowing where to start, with there being so much to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ditch you for Kira, and I definitely didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like&hellip;this,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, shutting his eyes and leaning his head back against the bench. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d he whispered, swallowing hard, \u201cwhy\u2019d you leave me for Kira? Was I really just&hellip;just not good enough?\u201d His last couple of words were so much softer, filled with so much more disappointment.</p><p>TJ sighed, shaking his head, and glancing at the other boy. \u201cNo, god, of course not, Cyrus. You\u2019re the most important person in my life,\u201d he tries to assure him, tapping his fingers along the edge of the bench, \u201cit\u2019s just&hellip;complicated,\u201d</p><p>He scoffed at that, mumbling something under his breath. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t seem like that. If you don\u2019t want to hang out with me anymore, why didn\u2019t you just say so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d he exclaimed, clearing his throat and lowering his voice, \u201cKira, she&hellip;she \u00a0told me she was going to say things about me that&hellip;I\u2019m not ready for people to know,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus brought up his eyebrows, a more confused look on his face than hurt. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, closing his eyes. \u201cWhen we were at the park that first day, didn\u2019t she seem a little&hellip;off?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus remained quiet, thinking it over. \u201cI mean, I guess a little. Probably because Buffy and I are friends and she has a feud with her,\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that,\u201d he admitted, \u201cI was there a few days after that and I was finishing up playing basketball. Naturally she was there too, and she asked me to do a costume with her-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I know that,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, hold on,\u201d TJ cut in, \u201cI told her twice that I couldn\u2019t because I was doing it with you,\u201d he paused, waiting for Cyrus to say something, but when he didn\u2019t, TJ continued. \u201cAnd then she got&hellip;defensive, I guess, or something, and was upset that I\u2019d rather do a costume with you rather than with her,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you barely even know her,\u201d Cyrus mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI know. And so I was just&hellip;I don\u2019t know, it didn\u2019t sit right with me. So I tried to catch up to her and ask her what she meant by that,\u201d he could feel his voice trembling, just a hair, \u201cand she was wondering why I\u2019d rather do a costume with a boy rather than a girl, and I quote, \u2018such as herself\u2019,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glanced up at him, as if to say \u2018go on\u2019. TJ really didn\u2019t want to continue; this was the hard part. But he knew he couldn\u2019t keep hurting Cyrus like this.</p><p>\u201cShe kind of&hellip;implied that I was gay,\u201d he mumbled, before adding more, \u201cwhich wouldn\u2019t have been a <i>bad </i>thing, except that the next thing I told her was \u2018so what if I am?\u2019, which wasn\u2019t a wise decision,\u201d he looked at Cyrus, trying to gauge his reaction. He looked sympathetic, and TJ felt at least a little better.</p><p>\u201cSo then we got in a bit of a&hellip;heated conversation about that and then she basically threatened to tell people if I didn\u2019t do the costume with her,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his heart sink; he felt awful for thinking that TJ ditched him out of selfish reason. He should have known better. He scooted a little closer and put a hand on the other boy\u2019s knee. \u201cTJ&hellip;I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d</p><p>But TJ shook his head, blinking a few times. \u201cAnd I was all dressed up in the beach outfit this morning and I was ready to go, and then I got to school early, hoping I\u2019d get to talk to you about this and explain things, but she was there earlier. And again she was going to tell people so I just&hellip;chickened out. I should have told you. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so so sorry, Cyrus,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus slung an arm around TJ\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, really. I get why you did it. That must\u2019ve been so scary,\u201d</p><p>He nodded softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to know yet. I mean, heck I could barely admit it to myself. And when she was talking about you and me&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe&hellip;was pointing out how we were always hanging out or always, I guess, being close,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cand&hellip;she scared me. A lot. I didn\u2019t want her to tell people. You\u2019re&hellip;you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve told,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled reassuringly, taking one of TJ\u2019s hands and lacing it with his own. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you. Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me,\u201d he said softly, \u201cdid she say anything else about us?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled lightly, glancing at the other boy. \u201cShe said we acted like such a couple&hellip;even though I told her we weren\u2019t,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile faltered a little bit, shifting his gaze down to his lap. \u201cBut what if&hellip;what if I want that?\u201d</p><p>TJ looked a little confused, but it was more like he wanted to make sure of things before he got his hopes up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus hesitated a little, brushing his thumb over the other boy\u2019s knuckles. \u201cI want. . I want us to be a couple. A thing. Whatever you want to call it. I want to be able to hold your hand without feeling nervous that you\u2019ll pull away. I want to come up and hug you from behind and surprise you. I want to send you good morning texts with a string of heart emojis,\u201d his voice grew a little softer each time, \u201cI want to be able to kiss you and go on dates,\u201d</p><p>TJ was beyond happy listening to Cyrus. With each of his desires, his smile grew wider and wider, and he couldn\u2019t stay still any longer. He pulled the other boy in for a hug, closing his eyes softly.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how long I\u2019ve wanted to hear that,\u201d he whispered, pulling back a little, \u201cI like you so much, you know,\u201d he paused, tilting up the other boy\u2019s head with the hook of his finger under his chin.</p><p>\u201cSo. . what does this mean for us?\u201d Cyrus asked softly, with a smile that reached his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt means&hellip;I really want to do all the things you said. Hold hands, go on dates, surprise hugs&hellip;kisses,\u201d he adds softer, his cheeks a dusty rose.</p><p>Cyrus grins, and before he can stop himself, he presses a quick kiss to TJ\u2019s cheek, smiling all the while. \u201cHow about tomorrow? Movie night at my house?\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled, but shook his head. \u201cI actually have a better idea,\u201d he said, a mischievous grin on his face.</p><p>Cyrus raised his brows. \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we missed out on the \u2018summer\u2019 part of the somersault, I was thinking, maybe we can take a trip to the beach?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus lit up, breaking into a huge smile. \u201cI\u2019d love that,\u201d</p>",

That must\u2019ve been so scary,\u201d</p><p>He nodded softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to know yet. I mean, heck I could barely admit it to myself. And when she was talking about you and me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2026was pointing out how we were always hanging out or always, I guess, being close,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cand\u2026she scared me.

I want us to be a couple. A thing. Whatever you want to call it. I want to be able to hold your hand without feeling nervous that you\u2019ll pull away. I want to come up and hug you from behind and surprise you. I want to send you good morning texts with a string of heart emojis,\u201d his voice grew a little softer each time, \u201cI want to be able to kiss you and go on dates,\u201d</p><p>TJ was beyond happy listening to Cyrus. With each of his desires, his smile grew wider and wider, and he couldn\u2019t stay still any longer. He pulled the other boy in for a hug, closing his eyes softly.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how long I\u2019ve wanted to hear that,\u201d he whispered, pulling back a little, \u201cI like you so much, you know,\u201d he paused, tilting up the other boy\u2019s head with the hook of his finger under his chin.</p><p>\u201cSo. . what does this mean for us?\u201d Cyrus asked softly, with a smile that reached his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt means\u2026I really want to do all the things you said.

Thanks for making me feel at least a little special for a while.</i></p><p><i>- Cyrus</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>TJ clenched the letter in his hands, feeling like he was choking on tears as he walked down the street. He must have read the letter a thousand times. He memorized where the words were blurred with little splotches of water when he first got the letter. He\u2019d run his fingers along the curves of the letters with a shaky finger. He\u2019d never felt so awful in his entire life.</p><p>Absentmindedly, he ended up near Cyrus\u2019 house. He always came over on the weekends, but he hadn\u2019t done that for the last weekend, or even the one before that. He felt miserable all the time; he\u2019d been cutting back from doing things. Last week, he skipped all his basketball practices. He hadn\u2019t gone to tutoring for the past few days. He didn\u2019t eat breakfast this morning because he felt sick to his stomach. All he wanted to do was tell Cyrus how sorry he was.</p><p>Believe him, he\u2019d tried. He called, texted, emailed, and even tried to tape notes to his locker, but to no avail. Cyrus always turned away and tagged on to the nearest person, walking with them. TJ couldn\u2019t blame him, though.</p><p>He folded the letter again on its creases, pressing it into his pocket as he made his way down the driveway of Cyrus\u2019 house. He hesitated before knocking, which wasn\u2019t something he usually did. Cyrus\u2019 parents usually left the door unlocked for him, since they knew he would come over. He wondered if Cyrus told his parents about this. God, he hoped not.</p><p>Soft footsteps could be hear from inside, and TJ said a silent prayer that one of his parents wouldn\u2019t open the door. He heard the door click, and he felt his heart leap into his throat.</p><p>Sure enough, Cyrus was standing on the other side of the door. In the split second that they made eye contact, TJ could see just how tired Cyrus looked; it seemed as though he hadn\u2019t slept for days, and he looked like he was about to collapse at any moment. He inhaled sharply, pressing his lips together.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he managed, blinking a few times.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus replied softly leaning against the doorframe. He sounded so small, and almost afraid; TJ felt like his heart was breaking.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he asked, feeling in his pocket where the letter was. He clenched it in his hand, running his fingers along the edges of the creases.</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, stepping outside and shutting the door behind him. He took a seat on the bench, and TJ sat on the other side, leaving room between them. He really hated how their relationship had changed over the course of a few short weeks. They both sat in uncomfortable silence for a while, until TJ pulled out the piece of paper from his pocket and unfolded it.</p><p>\u201cI got your letter,\u201d he breaks the silence, smoothing out the sheet of paper, \u201cI read it,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, his gaze down at his feet. He wasn\u2019t sure what to say, and he was certain that if he started talking, he\u2019d start crying, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for\u2026everything,\u201d he said lamely, not really knowing where to start, with there being so much to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ditch you for Kira, and I definitely didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like\u2026this,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, shutting his eyes and leaning his head back against the bench. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d he whispered, swallowing hard, \u201cwhy\u2019d you leave me for Kira? Was I really just\u2026just not good enough?\u201d His last couple of words were so much softer, filled with so much more disappointment.</p><p>TJ sighed, shaking his head, and glancing at the other boy. \u201cNo, god, of course not, Cyrus. You\u2019re the most important person in my life,\u201d he tries to assure him, tapping his fingers along the edge of the bench, \u201cit\u2019s just\u2026complicated,\u201d</p><p>He scoffed at that, mumbling something under his breath. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t seem like that. If you don\u2019t want to hang out with me anymore, why didn\u2019t you just say so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d he exclaimed, clearing his throat and lowering his voice, \u201cKira, she\u2026she \u00a0told me she was going to say things about me that\u2026I\u2019m not ready for people to know,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus brought up his eyebrows, a more confused look on his face than hurt. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, closing his eyes. \u201cWhen we were at the park that first day, didn\u2019t she seem a little\u2026off?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus remained quiet, thinking it over. \u201cI mean, I guess a little. Probably because Buffy and I are friends and she has a feud with her,\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that,\u201d he admitted, \u201cI was there a few days after that and I was finishing up playing basketball.

I swear I&rsquo;ll leave you alone if that&rsquo;s what you want. Thanks for making me feel at least a little special for a while.</i></p><p><i>- Cyrus</i></p><p>TJ clenched the letter in his hands, feeling like he was choking on tears as he walked down the street. He must have read the letter a thousand times. He memorized where the words were blurred with little splotches of water when he first got the letter. He&rsquo;d run his fingers along the curves of the letters with a shaky finger. He&rsquo;d never felt so awful in his entire life.</p><p>Absentmindedly, he ended up near Cyrus&rsquo; house. He always came over on the weekends, but he hadn&rsquo;t done that for the last weekend, or even the one before that. He felt miserable all the time; he&rsquo;d been cutting back from doing things. Last week, he skipped all his basketball practices. He hadn&rsquo;t gone to tutoring for the past few days. He didn&rsquo;t eat breakfast this morning because he felt sick to his stomach. All he wanted to do was tell Cyrus how sorry he was.</p><p>Believe him, he&rsquo;d tried. He called, texted, emailed, and even tried to tape notes to his locker, but to no avail. Cyrus always turned away and tagged on to the nearest person, walking with them. TJ couldn&rsquo;t blame him, though.</p><p>He folded the letter again on its creases, pressing it into his pocket as he made his way down the driveway of Cyrus&rsquo; house. He hesitated before knocking, which wasn&rsquo;t something he usually did. Cyrus&rsquo; parents usually left the door unlocked for him, since they knew he would come over. He wondered if Cyrus told his parents about this. God, he hoped not.</p><p>Soft footsteps could be hear from inside, and TJ said a silent prayer that one of his parents wouldn&rsquo;t open the door. He heard the door click, and he felt his heart leap into his throat.</p><p>Sure enough, Cyrus was standing on the other side of the door. In the split second that they made eye contact, TJ could see just how tired Cyrus looked; it seemed as though he hadn&rsquo;t slept for days, and he looked like he was about to collapse at any moment. He inhaled sharply, pressing his lips together.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he managed, blinking a few times.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Cyrus replied softly leaning against the doorframe. He sounded so small, and almost afraid; TJ felt like his heart was breaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo; he asked, feeling in his pocket where the letter was. He clenched it in his hand, running his fingers along the edges of the creases.</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, stepping outside and shutting the door behind him. He took a seat on the bench, and TJ sat on the other side, leaving room between them. He really hated how their relationship had changed over the course of a few short weeks. They both sat in uncomfortable silence for a while, until TJ pulled out the piece of paper from his pocket and unfolded it.</p><p>&ldquo;I got your letter,&rdquo; he breaks the silence, smoothing out the sheet of paper, &ldquo;I read it,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded, his gaze down at his feet. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say, and he was certain that if he started talking, he&rsquo;d start crying, and he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stop.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for&hellip;everything,&rdquo; he said lamely, not really knowing where to start, with there being so much to say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to ditch you for Kira, and I definitely didn&rsquo;t mean to make you feel like&hellip;this,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t say anything for a moment, shutting his eyes and leaning his head back against the bench. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you do it?&rdquo; he whispered, swallowing hard, &ldquo;why&rsquo;d you leave me for Kira? Was I really just&hellip;just not good enough?&rdquo; His last couple of words were so much softer, filled with so much more disappointment.</p><p>TJ sighed, shaking his head, and glancing at the other boy. &ldquo;No, god, of course not, Cyrus. You&rsquo;re the most important person in my life,&rdquo; he tries to assure him, tapping his fingers along the edge of the bench, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just&hellip;complicated,&rdquo;</p><p>He scoffed at that, mumbling something under his breath. &ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t seem like that. If you don&rsquo;t want to hang out with me anymore, why didn&rsquo;t you just say so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; he exclaimed, clearing his throat and lowering his voice, &ldquo;Kira, she&hellip;she &nbsp;told me she was going to say things about me that&hellip;I&rsquo;m not ready for people to know,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus brought up his eyebrows, a more confused look on his face than hurt. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sighed, closing his eyes. &ldquo;When we were at the park that first day, didn&rsquo;t she seem a little&hellip;off?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus remained quiet, thinking it over. &ldquo;I mean, I guess a little. Probably because Buffy and I are friends and she has a feud with her,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just that,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;I was there a few days after that and I was finishing up playing basketball. Naturally she was there too, and she asked me to do a costume with her-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-I know that,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, hold on,&rdquo; TJ cut in, &ldquo;I told her twice that I couldn&rsquo;t because I was doing it with you,&rdquo; he paused, waiting for Cyrus to say something, but when he didn&rsquo;t, TJ continued. &ldquo;And then she got&hellip;defensive, I guess, or something, and was upset that I&rsquo;d rather do a costume with you rather than with her,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you barely even know her,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. And so I was just&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know, it didn&rsquo;t sit right with me. So I tried to catch up to her and ask her what she meant by that,&rdquo; he could feel his voice trembling, just a hair, &ldquo;and she was wondering why I&rsquo;d rather do a costume with a boy rather than a girl, and I quote, &lsquo;such as herself&rsquo;,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus glanced up at him, as if to say &lsquo;go on&rsquo;. TJ really didn&rsquo;t want to continue; this was the hard part. But he knew he couldn&rsquo;t keep hurting Cyrus like this.</p><p>&ldquo;She kind of&hellip;implied that I was gay,&rdquo; he mumbled, before adding more, &ldquo;which wouldn&rsquo;t have been a <i>bad </i>thing, except that the next thing I told her was &lsquo;so what if I am?&rsquo;, which wasn&rsquo;t a wise decision,&rdquo; he looked at Cyrus, trying to gauge his reaction. He looked sympathetic, and TJ felt at least a little better.</p><p>&ldquo;So then we got in a bit of a&hellip;heated conversation about that and then she basically threatened to tell people if I didn&rsquo;t do the costume with her,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus felt his heart sink; he felt awful for thinking that TJ ditched him out of selfish reason. He should have known better. He scooted a little closer and put a hand on the other boy&rsquo;s knee. &ldquo;TJ&hellip;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo;</p><p>But TJ shook his head, blinking a few times. &ldquo;And I was all dressed up in the beach outfit this morning and I was ready to go, and then I got to school early, hoping I&rsquo;d get to talk to you about this and explain things, but she was there earlier. And again she was going to tell people so I just&hellip;chickened out. I should have told you. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m so so sorry, Cyrus,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus slung an arm around TJ&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, really. I get why you did it. That must&rsquo;ve been so scary,&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded softly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want people to know yet. I mean, heck I could barely admit it to myself. And when she was talking about you and me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You and me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&hellip;was pointing out how we were always hanging out or always, I guess, being close,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;and&hellip;she scared me. A lot. I didn&rsquo;t want her to tell people. You&rsquo;re&hellip;you&rsquo;re the first person I&rsquo;ve told,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled reassuringly, taking one of TJ&rsquo;s hands and lacing it with his own. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really proud of you. Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;did she say anything else about us?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ chuckled lightly, glancing at the other boy. &ldquo;She said we acted like such a couple&hellip;even though I told her we weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; smile faltered a little bit, shifting his gaze down to his lap. &ldquo;But what if&hellip;what if I want that?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked a little confused, but it was more like he wanted to make sure of things before he got his hopes up. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus hesitated a little, brushing his thumb over the other boy&rsquo;s knuckles. &ldquo;I want. . I want us to be a couple. A thing. Whatever you want to call it. I want to be able to hold your hand without feeling nervous that you&rsquo;ll pull away. I want to come up and hug you from behind and surprise you. I want to send you good morning texts with a string of heart emojis,&rdquo; his voice grew a little softer each time, &ldquo;I want to be able to kiss you and go on dates,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ was beyond happy listening to Cyrus. With each of his desires, his smile grew wider and wider, and he couldn&rsquo;t stay still any longer. He pulled the other boy in for a hug, closing his eyes softly.</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea how long I&rsquo;ve wanted to hear that,&rdquo; he whispered, pulling back a little, &ldquo;I like you so much, you know,&rdquo; he paused, tilting up the other boy&rsquo;s head with the hook of his finger under his chin.</p><p>&ldquo;So. . what does this mean for us?&rdquo; Cyrus asked softly, with a smile that reached his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;It means&hellip;I really want to do all the things you said. Hold hands, go on dates, surprise hugs&hellip;kisses,&rdquo; he adds softer, his cheeks a dusty rose.</p><p>Cyrus grins, and before he can stop himself, he presses a quick kiss to TJ&rsquo;s cheek, smiling all the while. &ldquo;How about tomorrow? Movie night at my house?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ smiled, but shook his head. &ldquo;I actually have a better idea,&rdquo; he said, a mischievous grin on his face.</p><p>Cyrus raised his brows. &ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Since we missed out on the &lsquo;summer&rsquo; part of the somersault, I was thinking, maybe we can take a trip to the beach?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus lit up, breaking into a huge smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love that,&rdquo;</p>",
