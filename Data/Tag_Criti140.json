finds him and frowns, realizing he knows\nhim somehow and realizes much like on the Mondasian Colony ship, he&rsquo;s found a\nfuture version of himself.</p><p>Taking Caduceus in the TARDIS of Amy Dallen&rsquo;s Doctor, they\ntravel through the rift, using Sam de Leve&rsquo;s Rokokokoko&rsquo;s abilities to navigate\nto a point of convergence between The Master and Caduceus, arriving in a frost\ncovered mountain side, just as a well known thief who Molly had stopped and\nhelped twice before his death as Molly, has found the grave in the midst of a\nsmall forest where nature has been building a shrine of black roses around\nMolly&rsquo;s grave. &nbsp;They send the thief on\nhis way, yet again confused by the kindness of strangers, only to turn and see\npuffs of artron energy seeping out of Molly&rsquo;s grave, having arrived as he is\nreborn yet again, still the same lavender Tiefling but the same mind as well,\nthanks to Caduceus&rsquo; spell that shielded him from his normal damaged\nregeneration powers.</p><p>This leaves Caduceus to leave the TARDIS and explore the\nworld with Molly, stopping at every tea shop and bath house in all of Exandria\nthat they can find, till eventually, having reunited with their friends and\ntold many tales of their wandering years, The Master returns and frowns at them\nagain, every time they try to leave Exandria they keep getting through around\nin time and always in a different part of either Molly or Caduceus&rsquo; lives so\nthey decide to try to take them with them to see if they can make it out. &nbsp;This plan almost works but they end up\nstranded in the distant past. &nbsp;Caduceus,\nrealizing they are in the forest he grew up in but there is no sign of the\ntemple his family has guarded all these years. \nHe does discover a young Firbolg woman who is in need of rescuing.</p><p>Caduceus falls in love, marries the woman and realizes that\nthey found the temple to the Wild Mother and form the graveyard that he grows\nup in a long time from now. &nbsp;Molly goes\noff to find supplies to try to help The Master, The Doctor, and The Corsair fix\nthe TARDIS but as soon as he was far enough away the TARDIS is sling shot back\ninto its own universe and timeline leaving Molly trapped in the ancient\npast. &nbsp;He decides to commission an\nancient wizard to write spells that Caleb will hunt for later when as a young\nchild in the academy he discovers a smutty story that also has randomly hidden\nand encoded spells that only he seems to be able to decipher stored within\ntheir pages putting him on a lifelong quest to hunt for obscure works of\npornography.</p><p>Molly continues to regenerate into himself at every death wondering\nhow long he&rsquo;ll be stuck in the past like this, till he meets the loves of his\nlife and settles down in the temple with Caduceus&rsquo; great grand children and\nlive his polyamorus omnisexual hedonistic life till one day he gives his life,\none last time, to save a Firbolg woman who reminds him so much of his long departed\nfriend. &nbsp;This time, as he fades, he sees\nshe&rsquo;s mortally wounded and instead of regenerating himself he regenerates the\nwoman, connecting with the young life growing in her and realizing that this is\nCaduceus&rsquo; mother with her unborn son inside her. &nbsp;Molly dies, saving the life of his next host\n/ incarnation, casting a reincarnation spell he&rsquo;d been saving just in case he\ngot tired of his current form, so that Caduceus would be born fresh, with none\nof The Master, Missy, or Molly&rsquo;s baggage.</p><p>Caduceus is born later, growing up not only an innocent but\nnew and fresh to the world with an old soul that lets him see the world in a\nway no one else can, and his parents never tell him much about his favorite\ngrave, and the man buried there who saved his life. &nbsp;This is the same grave that he goes to when\nhe meets the Mighty Nein when they ask him to leave his home, taking a piece of\nMolly with him as he travels with Molly&rsquo;s former friends, not knowing him by\nthat name as he&rsquo;d changed it long before Caduceus&rsquo; parents were born. &nbsp;And when he stops and inspects Molly&rsquo;s grave\nhe senses the same energy from the grave he left behind, understanding that\nsomething has happened, either this being the same person in two graves or figuring\nthis is somehow a child of the man he owes his life to, he charms the grave so\nthat the earth will remember him. &nbsp;Never\nknowing until much later in his life that he&rsquo;s just started and closed a loop\nof his own life that will result in his own birth farther down the line.</p>",
