Things had been going great, they\u2019d gotten past Buffy\u2019s old grudge, the gun incident, and Costume Day. Their friendship was going steady, and it even seemed like it could be leading to more.</p><p><br/></p><p>And then it did.</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ confessed his feelings to Cyrus at Andi\u2019s 14th birthday party, and it was perfect. They sat on a bench away from everyone else, fairy lights and stars twinkling around them. He explained the real reasons behind everything that went down on Costume Day, and Cyrus told him he returned his feelings almost a little too eagerly. If their friends noticed they were that much more happy and clingy during the rest of the party, they didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p><br/></p><p>And that\u2019s when it all went wrong.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>The next day, Cyrus sent TJ a text that said, \u201cWe can\u2019t talk anymore. Bye, TJ.\u201d Completely out of the blue, unprompted. It didn\u2019t make any sense. The most wonderful thing had just happened the night before, why did it have to end so soon?</p><p><br/></p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter, because it did end, and when TJ tried to text him back, all he got was a message saying that he\u2019d been blocked. So, he figured he had a pretty valid reason to be crying on and off for the next few days, you know, considering he just lost the one person who knew him better than anyone, who he lo\u2014 really liked. Actually, fuck it, he loved him. A lot. And now he was gone.</p><p><br/></p><p>When trying to go up to him and talk to him the next day, he was only thrown a pitiful look from Andi and Buffy, with the latter adding, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you have to go, TJ.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus never even looked up at him.</p><p><br/></p><p>The two drifted apart after that, and although it was entirely agonizing for TJ, he dealt with it. Most of the time, at least. If his line of sight drifted over to the brunette boy every once in a while during lunch, it was nobody\u2019s business.</p><p><br/></p><p>The worst part of it all was having to start high school without Cyrus. He was a lone wolf for the most part, considering the friend group stopped talking to him when Cyrus did, despite the sorry looks still thrown his way sometimes. He started talking to Reed again, who luckily had apparently learned his lesson from the gun incident. He actually kept up with his school work, and he didn\u2019t make as many dumb jokes anymore. Plus, he came out as pan during that year, so TJ could at least relate to him a little bit more. TJ got more involved in basketball, and he occasionally went to GSA meetings now that he was out, just to scope it out and maybe meet some new people. Definitely not to run into an old friend, an old almost.</p><p><br/></p><p>10th grade was normal throughout the majority of the year. He was finally starting to really get over the whole Cyrus situation, and although he got nostalgic over it sometimes, he knew that it was in the past. There was nothing he could do about it now. He got more help in math and got his first A-, which he may or may not have cried over, and he picked up soccer alongside basketball. He\u2019d gotten really busy, so he didn\u2019t spend a ton of time with friends unless they were his teammates, but the soccer players were nice enough, and he didn\u2019t expect his friendship with Reed to last long, anyway.</p><p><br/></p><p>This is why he was surprised to hear a text notification from his phone at the end of practice, thinking it would be an out of nowhere text from Reed. It sure as <i>hell</i> was an out of nowhere text, but it wasn\u2019t exactly from Reed.</p><p><br/></p><p>It was from Cyrus.</p><p><br/></p><p>It read, \u201cI have some explaining to do if you\u2019ll let me. You know where I am.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ almost didn\u2019t want to go. It had been nearly two years since they\u2019d last spoken, since they\u2019d last seen each other. It took him two years to get over what had happened. Did an explanation even matter at this point? It would just be a nuisance, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p><br/></p><p>At the same time, what had happened never really gave him closure. He never even got to say goodbye to him. It was going great, and then it wasn\u2019t. TJ kinda wanted to know why.</p><p><br/></p><p>He shoved his things into his bag and sling it over his shoulder, sneaking out without anyone noticing he was gone. Not like that was any different.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tj walked over to the swings, nostalgia hitting him in waves, his eyes getting misty for what felt like no reason. When he arrived, he noticed two things: the swings were way rustier and more covered in cobwebs than he remembered, and that he would always recognize the back of the head of a certain brunette in an instant. He walked up slowly, unsure of how to approach this entire situation. He didn\u2019t have to, though, because Cyrus looked behind him the second he heard footsteps. \u201cYou came.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ sighed and blinked hard, forcing the light out of his eyes. \u201cOf course I came.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou wanna sit?\u201d Cyrus asked, grabbing the chain of the swing next to him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m good,\u201d TJ mumbled in reply, simply stepping a bit closer.</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus sighed heavily, standing up to face TJ. \u201cSo I have a lot of explaining to do.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, you already said that in your text,\u201d TJ said, lifting up his hand that held his phone.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ scoffed unintentionally. The old TJ would\u2019ve done that in a heartbeat, but he\u2019d changed. Or at least he had once. \u201cHow about the beginning? Why\u2019d you stop talking to me? Everything was going so great, why\u2019d it have to end <i>so soon</i>?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long story,\u201d Cyrus muttered, twiddling his fingers.</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ responded shortly. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, Cyrus.\u201d After a beat of silence, he added, \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t want to talk about it, that\u2019s fine, we can just go back to ignoring each other like we have been for the past two years. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt is to me,\u201d Cyrus replied, sounding the most sure of himself then than he did during the entire conversation. \u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have shown up if I didn\u2019t, Cy.\u201d The nickname didn\u2019t mean to slip out, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. Old habits die hard, he supposed.</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus opened his mouth to say something, but stopped himself. \u201cCan we please sit down for this?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d TJ said, taking a seat next to Cyrus, neither of them kicking their legs up to move.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI was <i>so</i> excited about us, TJ, you have no idea. I even woke up smiling, I remember. That was my first mistake. I went downstairs to get breakfast, and my stepmom saw how happy I was, so she asked about it. I figured, she\u2019s never said anything bad about the LGBT+ community before, plus she\u2019s a therapist so she must deal with gay patients all the time, so I wanted to tell her about me. And us. So I did.\u201d Cyrus took a deep breath. \u201cThat was my second mistake.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ\u2019s face dropped. \u201cOh my g\u2014\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d Cyrus cut him off. That was new. TJ wondered if he had any influence in that.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cShe called my dad in the room and told him what I told her, as if there was something wrong with it. She started bawling, saying that she was so disappointed that I would never had kids, and that I was too young to really know what I\u2019m talking about, and that this is what happens when I hang out around \u2018delinquents like you\u2019. And my dad didn\u2019t help either, he just stood there fuming. They made me send you that text, and block you on everything, and stop talking to you, and I did it because I\u2019m a coward and I couldn\u2019t handle being such a&hellip; <i>disappointment</i>.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ gently put his hand on Cyrus\u2019 shoulder. \u201cCyrus, that\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m so, <i>so</i> sorry that you had to go through that alone.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, well, they wanted to keep it under wraps because they were so ashamed about it, so they never told anyone, including my mom and stepdad, so at least I felt more comfortable with them. I only told Andi and Buffy about it. Buffy actually wanted me to go behind their backs and keep seeing you anyway because she saw how happy you made me, but I just couldn\u2019t do that to them.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ sighed, bringing his arm back down and leaning back a bit without falling off his seat. \u201cI get it, I still haven\u2019t come out to my parents yet because I\u2019m pretty positive they\u2019re homophobic, but what they don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them, you know? And at least you were able to talk to the girls about it, even if they didn\u2019t fully understand it.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>A small smile appeared on Cyrus\u2019 face as he let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m really grateful for them.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ smiled softly, happy to finally get some closure over what had happened between them. He quickly furrowed his eyebrows, however, asking, \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t get, though.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you want to tell me now? After two years of not talking?\u201d TJ asked, no undertones or cruelty or judgement, just curiosity.</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus chuckled to himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I would have to explain this part or not. Guess I do.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ places his hand on Cyrus\u2019. \u201cI\u2019ve already forgiven you, okay? You don\u2019t need to be worried anymore.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI am anyway, you should know that,\u201d Cyrus joked, then took a deep breath. \u201cAnyway, my stepmom and my dad said that they had to move because the shrink office they operate out of relocated. And we got in a pretty big fight, and I brought up the whole gay thing again because they basically disregarded it and pretended it didn\u2019t happen for like a year and a half which is pretty damn frustrating, and they said that I might as well live with my mom and stepdad, so I said that yeah, I might as well. And, well, now I do, and I only have to go see my other set of parents every month since they still technically share custody of me. But, they\u2019re not a problem anymore, TJ.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! Wait\u2014\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI can talk to you again, if you want me to,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, a bashful smile on his face.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI mean, of course I want to talk to you again, Underdog.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus smiled and bit his lip at the oh so familiar nickname. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>And then his face dropped.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIf you were thinking about anything more than that, anything romantic, you know, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that,\u201d TJ explained, trying to word his emotions as carefully as possible.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d Cyrus exhaled, \u201cfine. I wasn\u2019t expecting to jump into anything, anyway. I just really wanted you back in my life,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, I wanted you back too,\u201d TJ replied, a goofy grin on his face that could only be induced by Cyrus.</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus groaned, leaning back and almost falling out of his swing, \u201cYou have <i>no</i> idea how hard these past two years have been, oh my <i>goodness</i>!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ laughed, his first real laugh in a long time, \u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus looked down, then back at TJ. \u201cAt least we don\u2019t have to face it alone anymore.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>TJ simply giggled in response, just so, <i>so</i> grateful for having him back.</p><p><br/></p><p>Flash forward two months, it was as if the two had never been separated in the first place. TJ began sitting with their friend group at lunch again, everyone genuinely happy to see him. They all went to his basketball and soccer games, Cyrus bringing posters every time, while he tagged along with the group for Buffy\u2019s basketball games and Jonah\u2019s frisbee meets. He and Cyrus frequently went on \u201changouts\u201d, which Andi and Buffy loved to tease Cyrus about. And, it was on one of those hangouts when TJ finally got the guts to do what he\u2019d been wanting to do for two years.</p><p><br/></p><p>They went out for ice cream on a Saturday evening, and were sitting on a park bench enjoying their chocolate soft serve and blueberry vanilla twist (guess who\u2019s who). TJ looked over to Cyrus, who had some ice cream on his face, and it was almost subconscious the way he lifted his hand to wipe it off. Cyrus looked right into his eyes, and TJ knew then and there that he could get lost in those chocolate galaxies for the rest of his life. His hand stayed on Cyrus\u2019 cheek, and he whispered as if he would break the moment if he spoke any louder when he asked, \u201cCan I try something?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t even answer, he simply quickly got the memo and leaned in to kiss TJ like he\u2019d been wanting to for the past two months, or rather, two years. It didn\u2019t quite feel like fireworks going off and a chorus singing behind them, it felt more like an electric shock going down each of their spines while a warm blanket was wrapped around their shoulders. They touched foreheads as they pulled apart, giggling to themselves, because it finally happened. Two years of waiting, and neither of them would\u2019ve traded it for anything in the world if they knew it would\u2019ve ended like that.</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Finally</i>.</p>",

Bye, TJ.\u201d Completely out of the blue, unprompted. It didn\u2019t make any sense. The most wonderful thing had just happened the night before, why did it have to end so soon?</p><p><br></p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter, because it did end, and when TJ tried to text him back, all he got was a message saying that he\u2019d been blocked. So, he figured he had a pretty valid reason to be crying on and off for the next few days, you know, considering he just lost the one person who knew him better than anyone, who he lo\u2014 really liked. Actually, fuck it, he loved him. A lot. And now he was gone.</p><p><br></p><p>When trying to go up to him and talk to him the next day, he was only thrown a pitiful look from Andi and Buffy, with the latter adding, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you have to go, TJ.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus never even looked up at him.</p><p><br></p><p>The two drifted apart after that, and although it was entirely agonizing for TJ, he dealt with it. Most of the time, at least. If his line of sight drifted over to the brunette boy every once in a while during lunch, it was nobody\u2019s business.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part of it all was having to start high school without Cyrus. He was a lone wolf for the most part, considering the friend group stopped talking to him when Cyrus did, despite the sorry looks still thrown his way sometimes. He started talking to Reed again, who luckily had apparently learned his lesson from the gun incident. He actually kept up with his school work, and he didn\u2019t make as many dumb jokes anymore. Plus, he came out as pan during that year, so TJ could at least relate to him a little bit more. TJ got more involved in basketball, and he occasionally went to GSA meetings now that he was out, just to scope it out and maybe meet some new people. Definitely not to run into an old friend, an old almost.</p><p><br></p><p>10th grade was normal throughout the majority of the year. He was finally starting to really get over the whole Cyrus situation, and although he got nostalgic over it sometimes, he knew that it was in the past. There was nothing he could do about it now. He got more help in math and got his first A-, which he may or may not have cried over, and he picked up soccer alongside basketball. He\u2019d gotten really busy, so he didn\u2019t spend a ton of time with friends unless they were his teammates, but the soccer players were nice enough, and he didn\u2019t expect his friendship with Reed to last long, anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why he was surprised to hear a text notification from his phone at the end of practice, thinking it would be an out of nowhere text from Reed. It sure as <i>hell</i> was an out of nowhere text, but it wasn\u2019t exactly from Reed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was from Cyrus.</p><p><br></p><p>It read, \u201cI have some explaining to do if you\u2019ll let me. You know where I am.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ almost didn\u2019t want to go. It had been nearly two years since they\u2019d last spoken, since they\u2019d last seen each other.

Things had been going great, they\u2019d gotten past Buffy\u2019s old grudge, the gun incident, and Costume Day. Their friendship was going steady, and it even seemed like it could be leading to more.</p><p><br></p><p>And then it did.</p><p><br></p><p>TJ confessed his feelings to Cyrus at Andi\u2019s 14th birthday party, and it was perfect. They sat on a bench away from everyone else, fairy lights and stars twinkling around them. He explained the real reasons behind everything that went down on Costume Day, and Cyrus told him he returned his feelings almost a little too eagerly. If their friends noticed they were that much more happy and clingy during the rest of the party, they didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>And that\u2019s when it all went wrong.</p><p>[[MORE]]</p><p>The next day, Cyrus sent TJ a text that said, \u201cWe can\u2019t talk anymore. Bye, TJ.\u201d Completely out of the blue, unprompted. It didn\u2019t make any sense. The most wonderful thing had just happened the night before, why did it have to end so soon?</p><p><br></p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter, because it did end, and when TJ tried to text him back, all he got was a message saying that he\u2019d been blocked. So, he figured he had a pretty valid reason to be crying on and off for the next few days, you know, considering he just lost the one person who knew him better than anyone, who he lo\u2014 really liked. Actually, fuck it, he loved him. A lot. And now he was gone.</p><p><br></p><p>When trying to go up to him and talk to him the next day, he was only thrown a pitiful look from Andi and Buffy, with the latter adding, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you have to go, TJ.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus never even looked up at him.</p><p><br></p><p>The two drifted apart after that, and although it was entirely agonizing for TJ, he dealt with it. Most of the time, at least. If his line of sight drifted over to the brunette boy every once in a while during lunch, it was nobody\u2019s business.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part of it all was having to start high school without Cyrus. He was a lone wolf for the most part, considering the friend group stopped talking to him when Cyrus did, despite the sorry looks still thrown his way sometimes. He started talking to Reed again, who luckily had apparently learned his lesson from the gun incident. He actually kept up with his school work, and he didn\u2019t make as many dumb jokes anymore. Plus, he came out as pan during that year, so TJ could at least relate to him a little bit more. TJ got more involved in basketball, and he occasionally went to GSA meetings now that he was out, just to scope it out and maybe meet some new people. Definitely not to run into an old friend, an old almost.</p><p><br></p><p>10th grade was normal throughout the majority of the year. He was finally starting to really get over the whole Cyrus situation, and although he got nostalgic over it sometimes, he knew that it was in the past. There was nothing he could do about it now. He got more help in math and got his first A-, which he may or may not have cried over, and he picked up soccer alongside basketball. He\u2019d gotten really busy, so he didn\u2019t spend a ton of time with friends unless they were his teammates, but the soccer players were nice enough, and he didn\u2019t expect his friendship with Reed to last long, anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why he was surprised to hear a text notification from his phone at the end of practice, thinking it would be an out of nowhere text from Reed. It sure as <i>hell</i> was an out of nowhere text, but it wasn\u2019t exactly from Reed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was from Cyrus.</p><p><br></p><p>It read, \u201cI have some explaining to do if you\u2019ll let me. You know where I am.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ almost didn\u2019t want to go. It had been nearly two years since they\u2019d last spoken, since they\u2019d last seen each other. It took him two years to get over what had happened. Did an explanation even matter at this point? It would just be a nuisance, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p><br></p><p>At the same time, what had happened never really gave him closure. He never even got to say goodbye to him. It was going great, and then it wasn\u2019t. TJ kinda wanted to know why.</p><p><br></p><p>He shoved his things into his bag and sling it over his shoulder, sneaking out without anyone noticing he was gone. Not like that was any different.</p><p><br></p><p>Tj walked over to the swings, nostalgia hitting him in waves, his eyes getting misty for what felt like no reason. When he arrived, he noticed two things: the swings were way rustier and more covered in cobwebs than he remembered, and that he would always recognize the back of the head of a certain brunette in an instant. He walked up slowly, unsure of how to approach this entire situation. He didn\u2019t have to, though, because Cyrus looked behind him the second he heard footsteps. \u201cYou came.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ sighed and blinked hard, forcing the light out of his eyes. \u201cOf course I came.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou wanna sit?\u201d Cyrus asked, grabbing the chain of the swing next to him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m good,\u201d TJ mumbled in reply, simply stepping a bit closer.</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus sighed heavily, standing up to face TJ. \u201cSo I have a lot of explaining to do.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah, you already said that in your text,\u201d TJ said, lifting up his hand that held his phone.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ scoffed unintentionally. The old TJ would\u2019ve done that in a heartbeat, but he\u2019d changed. Or at least he had once. \u201cHow about the beginning? Why\u2019d you stop talking to me? Everything was going so great, why\u2019d it have to end <i>so soon</i>?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long story,\u201d Cyrus muttered, twiddling his fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>TJ responded shortly. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, Cyrus.\u201d After a beat of silence, he added, \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t want to talk about it, that\u2019s fine, we can just go back to ignoring each other like we have been for the past two years. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt is to me,\u201d Cyrus replied, sounding the most sure of himself then than he did during the entire conversation. \u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have shown up if I didn\u2019t, Cy.\u201d The nickname didn\u2019t mean to slip out, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. Old habits die hard, he supposed.</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus opened his mouth to say something, but stopped himself. \u201cCan we please sit down for this?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d TJ said, taking a seat next to Cyrus, neither of them kicking their legs up to move.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI was <i>so</i> excited about us, TJ, you have no idea. I even woke up smiling, I remember. That was my first mistake. I went downstairs to get breakfast, and my stepmom saw how happy I was, so she asked about it. I figured, she\u2019s never said anything bad about the LGBT+ community before, plus she\u2019s a therapist so she must deal with gay patients all the time, so I wanted to tell her about me. And us. So I did.\u201d Cyrus took a deep breath. \u201cThat was my second mistake.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ\u2019s face dropped. \u201cOh my g\u2014\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d Cyrus cut him off. That was new. TJ wondered if he had any influence in that.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cShe called my dad in the room and told him what I told her, as if there was something wrong with it. She started bawling, saying that she was so disappointed that I would never had kids, and that I was too young to really know what I\u2019m talking about, and that this is what happens when I hang out around \u2018delinquents like you\u2019. And my dad didn\u2019t help either, he just stood there fuming. They made me send you that text, and block you on everything, and stop talking to you, and I did it because I\u2019m a coward and I couldn\u2019t handle being such a\u2026 <i>disappointment</i>.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ gently put his hand on Cyrus\u2019 shoulder. \u201cCyrus, that\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m so, <i>so</i> sorry that you had to go through that alone.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah, well, they wanted to keep it under wraps because they were so ashamed about it, so they never told anyone, including my mom and stepdad, so at least I felt more comfortable with them. I only told Andi and Buffy about it. Buffy actually wanted me to go behind their backs and keep seeing you anyway because she saw how happy you made me, but I just couldn\u2019t do that to them.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ sighed, bringing his arm back down and leaning back a bit without falling off his seat. \u201cI get it, I still haven\u2019t come out to my parents yet because I\u2019m pretty positive they\u2019re homophobic, but what they don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them, you know? And at least you were able to talk to the girls about it, even if they didn\u2019t fully understand it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>A small smile appeared on Cyrus\u2019 face as he let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m really grateful for them.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ smiled softly, happy to finally get some closure over what had happened between them. He quickly furrowed his eyebrows, however, asking, \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t get, though.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you want to tell me now? After two years of not talking?\u201d TJ asked, no undertones or cruelty or judgement, just curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus chuckled to himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I would have to explain this part or not. Guess I do.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ places his hand on Cyrus\u2019. \u201cI\u2019ve already forgiven you, okay? You don\u2019t need to be worried anymore.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI am anyway, you should know that,\u201d Cyrus joked, then took a deep breath. \u201cAnyway, my stepmom and my dad said that they had to move because the shrink office they operate out of relocated. And we got in a pretty big fight, and I brought up the whole gay thing again because they basically disregarded it and pretended it didn\u2019t happen for like a year and a half which is pretty damn frustrating, and they said that I might as well live with my mom and stepdad, so I said that yeah, I might as well. And, well, now I do, and I only have to go see my other set of parents every month since they still technically share custody of me. But, they\u2019re not a problem anymore, TJ.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! Wait\u2014\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI can talk to you again, if you want me to,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, a bashful smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI mean, of course I want to talk to you again, Underdog.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus smiled and bit his lip at the oh so familiar nickname. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>And then his face dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf you were thinking about anything more than that, anything romantic, you know, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that,\u201d TJ explained, trying to word his emotions as carefully as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d Cyrus exhaled, \u201cfine.

I just really wanted you back in my life,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, I wanted you back too,\u201d TJ replied, a goofy grin on his face that could only be induced by Cyrus.</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus groaned, leaning back and almost falling out of his swing, \u201cYou have <i>no</i> idea how hard these past two years have been, oh my <i>goodness</i>!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ laughed, his first real laugh in a long time, \u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Cyrus looked down, then back at TJ. \u201cAt least we don\u2019t have to face it alone anymore.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>TJ simply giggled in response, just so, <i>so</i> grateful for having him back.</p><p><br></p><p>Flash forward two months, it was as if the two had never been separated in the first place.

It took him two years to get over what had happened. Did an explanation even matter at this point? It would just be a nuisance, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p><p><br /></p><p>At the same time, what had happened never really gave him closure. He never even got to say goodbye to him. It was going great, and then it wasn&rsquo;t. TJ kinda wanted to know why.</p><p><br /></p><p>He shoved his things into his bag and sling it over his shoulder, sneaking out without anyone noticing he was gone. Not like that was any different.</p><p><br /></p><p>Tj walked over to the swings, nostalgia hitting him in waves, his eyes getting misty for what felt like no reason. When he arrived, he noticed two things: the swings were way rustier and more covered in cobwebs than he remembered, and that he would always recognize the back of the head of a certain brunette in an instant. He walked up slowly, unsure of how to approach this entire situation. He didn&rsquo;t have to, though, because Cyrus looked behind him the second he heard footsteps. &ldquo;You came.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>TJ sighed and blinked hard, forcing the light out of his eyes. &ldquo;Of course I came.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You wanna sit?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, grabbing the chain of the swing next to him.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; TJ mumbled in reply, simply stepping a bit closer.</p><p><br /></p><p>Cyrus sighed heavily, standing up to face TJ. &ldquo;So I have a lot of explaining to do.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you already said that in your text,&rdquo; TJ said, lifting up his hand that held his phone.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know where to start.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>TJ scoffed unintentionally. The old TJ would&rsquo;ve done that in a heartbeat, but he&rsquo;d changed. Or at least he had once. &ldquo;How about the beginning? Why&rsquo;d you stop talking to me? Everything was going so great, why&rsquo;d it have to end <i>so soon</i>?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; Cyrus muttered, twiddling his fingers.</p><p><br /></p><p>TJ responded shortly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here, Cyrus.&rdquo; After a beat of silence, he added, &ldquo;Look, if you don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, that&rsquo;s fine, we can just go back to ignoring each other like we have been for the past two years. It&rsquo;s not a big deal.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It is to me,&rdquo; Cyrus replied, sounding the most sure of himself then than he did during the entire conversation. &ldquo;You really want to know?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have shown up if I didn&rsquo;t, Cy.&rdquo; The nickname didn&rsquo;t mean to slip out, but he couldn&rsquo;t help himself. Old habits die hard, he supposed.</p><p><br /></p><p>Cyrus opened his mouth to say something, but stopped himself. &ldquo;Can we please sit down for this?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; TJ said, taking a seat next to Cyrus, neither of them kicking their legs up to move.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was <i>so</i> excited about us, TJ, you have no idea. I even woke up smiling, I remember. That was my first mistake. I went downstairs to get breakfast, and my stepmom saw how happy I was, so she asked about it. I figured, she&rsquo;s never said anything bad about the LGBT+ community before, plus she&rsquo;s a therapist so she must deal with gay patients all the time, so I wanted to tell her about me. And us. So I did.&rdquo; Cyrus took a deep breath. &ldquo;That was my second mistake.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>TJ&rsquo;s face dropped. &ldquo;Oh my g&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not done,&rdquo; Cyrus cut him off. That was new. TJ wondered if he had any influence in that.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;She called my dad in the room and told him what I told her, as if there was something wrong with it. She started bawling, saying that she was so disappointed that I would never had kids, and that I was too young to really know what I&rsquo;m talking about, and that this is what happens when I hang out around &lsquo;delinquents like you&rsquo;. And my dad didn&rsquo;t help either, he just stood there fuming. They made me send you that text, and block you on everything, and stop talking to you, and I did it because I&rsquo;m a coward and I couldn&rsquo;t handle being such a&hellip; <i>disappointment</i>.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>TJ gently put his hand on Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder. &ldquo;Cyrus, that&rsquo;s horrible. I&rsquo;m so, <i>so</i> sorry that you had to go through that alone.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, they wanted to keep it under wraps because they were so ashamed about it, so they never told anyone, including my mom and stepdad, so at least I felt more comfortable with them. I only told Andi and Buffy about it. Buffy actually wanted me to go behind their backs and keep seeing you anyway because she saw how happy you made me, but I just couldn&rsquo;t do that to them.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>TJ sighed, bringing his arm back down and leaning back a bit without falling off his seat. &ldquo;I get it, I still haven&rsquo;t come out to my parents yet because I&rsquo;m pretty positive they&rsquo;re homophobic, but what they don&rsquo;t know won&rsquo;t hurt them, you know? And at least you were able to talk to the girls about it, even if they didn&rsquo;t fully understand it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>A small smile appeared on Cyrus&rsquo; face as he let out a breath he didn&rsquo;t know he was holding. &ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m really grateful for them.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>TJ smiled softly, happy to finally get some closure over what had happened between them. He quickly furrowed his eyebrows, however, asking, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t get, though.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you want to tell me now? After two years of not talking?&rdquo; TJ asked, no undertones or cruelty or judgement, just curiosity.</p><p><br /></p><p>Cyrus chuckled to himself. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know if I would have to explain this part or not. Guess I do.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; TJ places his hand on Cyrus&rsquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already forgiven you, okay? You don&rsquo;t need to be worried anymore.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I am anyway, you should know that,&rdquo; Cyrus joked, then took a deep breath. &ldquo;Anyway, my stepmom and my dad said that they had to move because the shrink office they operate out of relocated. And we got in a pretty big fight, and I brought up the whole gay thing again because they basically disregarded it and pretended it didn&rsquo;t happen for like a year and a half which is pretty damn frustrating, and they said that I might as well live with my mom and stepdad, so I said that yeah, I might as well. And, well, now I do, and I only have to go see my other set of parents every month since they still technically share custody of me. But, they&rsquo;re not a problem anymore, TJ.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! Wait&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can talk to you again, if you want me to,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, a bashful smile on his face.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean, of course I want to talk to you again, Underdog.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Cyrus smiled and bit his lip at the oh so familiar nickname. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>And then his face dropped.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you were thinking about anything more than that, anything romantic, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m ready for that,&rdquo; TJ explained, trying to word his emotions as carefully as possible.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Cyrus exhaled, &ldquo;fine. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to jump into anything, anyway. I just really wanted you back in my life,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, I wanted you back too,&rdquo; TJ replied, a goofy grin on his face that could only be induced by Cyrus.</p><p><br /></p><p>Cyrus groaned, leaning back and almost falling out of his swing, &ldquo;You have <i>no</i> idea how hard these past two years have been, oh my <i>goodness</i>!&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>TJ laughed, his first real laugh in a long time, &ldquo;I know, right?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Cyrus looked down, then back at TJ. &ldquo;At least we don&rsquo;t have to face it alone anymore.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>TJ simply giggled in response, just so, <i>so</i> grateful for having him back.</p><p><br /></p><p>Flash forward two months, it was as if the two had never been separated in the first place. TJ began sitting with their friend group at lunch again, everyone genuinely happy to see him. They all went to his basketball and soccer games, Cyrus bringing posters every time, while he tagged along with the group for Buffy&rsquo;s basketball games and Jonah&rsquo;s frisbee meets. He and Cyrus frequently went on &ldquo;hangouts&rdquo;, which Andi and Buffy loved to tease Cyrus about. And, it was on one of those hangouts when TJ finally got the guts to do what he&rsquo;d been wanting to do for two years.</p><p><br /></p><p>They went out for ice cream on a Saturday evening, and were sitting on a park bench enjoying their chocolate soft serve and blueberry vanilla twist (guess who&rsquo;s who). TJ looked over to Cyrus, who had some ice cream on his face, and it was almost subconscious the way he lifted his hand to wipe it off. Cyrus looked right into his eyes, and TJ knew then and there that he could get lost in those chocolate galaxies for the rest of his life. His hand stayed on Cyrus&rsquo; cheek, and he whispered as if he would break the moment if he spoke any louder when he asked, &ldquo;Can I try something?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t even answer, he simply quickly got the memo and leaned in to kiss TJ like he&rsquo;d been wanting to for the past two months, or rather, two years. It didn&rsquo;t quite feel like fireworks going off and a chorus singing behind them, it felt more like an electric shock going down each of their spines while a warm blanket was wrapped around their shoulders. They touched foreheads as they pulled apart, giggling to themselves, because it finally happened. Two years of waiting, and neither of them would&rsquo;ve traded it for anything in the world if they knew it would&rsquo;ve ended like that.</p><p><br /></p><p><i>Finally</i>.</p></p>",
