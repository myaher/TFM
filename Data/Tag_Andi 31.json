She had just closed up shop at the craft store she ran, smiling as she recalled how a young girl had so nervously asked her to teach her how to make a bracelet. While studying, she had never expected she would remain in Shadyside, but as she strolled by, taking in the aights around her, there was no place she&rsquo;d rather be. Her friends we&rsquo;re in different places though. Buffy eventually did end up in Phoenix, but she always called, keeping in touch. Cyrus had moved to New York, studying psychology further while also working on scriptwriting on the side. Jonah had gone to LA, living out his music dreams, but always leaving messages to his friends. Thank god, their friendship was very much alive, still holding onto a bit of childhood. </p><p>As she made her way down the street, she looked ahead and spotted the familiar sign of &lsquo;Cloud 10&rsquo;, her mom Bex&rsquo;s pride and joy. Seeing the sign, though, made Andi&rsquo;s heart rate pick up. Because that wasn&rsquo;t the only thing Cloud 10 was. Cloud 10 was also where Amber Kippen worked as a makeup artist. </p><p>It was common knowledge how Andi and Amber went from sworn enemies, to frenemies, to acquaintances, to great friends. She was the only one of Andi&rsquo;s friends to also still be in Shadyside, but they hadnt hung out as much, work and adulthood getting in the way. </p><p>What was not common knowledge, however, was that one day, after a particularly hectic day, one when she hadnt woken up on the right side of the bed, Andi was trudging home in the rain, and while walking by the salon, she spotted Amber with a client. It was the first time Andi had really looked at Amber. Her scrunched up nose, her furrowed eyebrows, a soft smile on her face, her hands daintily working. And it was pretty much love at the millionth sight for Andi Mack. </p><p>Since that day, Andi had always snuck glances at Amber through the window, falling even more. She knew it was stupid what she was doing, she could very well just go in and talk to her. But something always stopped her. Texting? Not a problem at all, they texted day and night. But face to face interaction? </p><p><i>She would rather the world swallow her whole and spit her out through a volcano. </i></p><p>Normally, she would get lucky and be able to sneak a glance without Amber nlticing and just go home, a warm and fuzzy feeling in her heart.</p><p>But Andi&rsquo;s luck liked to do this thing once in a while, called <i>running out. </i>And it just happened to be that day. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Andi,&rdquo; Amber called out, waving to her as she walked out of the door to where Andi stood, frozen to the spot. <i>Haha conversation. Yay. This wouldn&rsquo;t at all be awkward. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Hey Amber,&rdquo; Andi mumbled, trying to not look Amber in the eyes. Amber just narrowed her eyes in amusement, watching as Andi grew increasingly flhstered, finding it intriguing and adorable, frankly. </p><p>&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; Amber asked, trying to break the growing silence. Andi snaped out of her daze, trying to think up a reason. </p><p>&ldquo;I, uh. I wanted to, um, see Bex!&rdquo; She said, snaping her fingers as soon as she thought of her excuse. &ldquo;I needed to ask her for something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you just missed her,&rdquo; Amber said with a sigh, pointing her thumb in the direction of Bex and Bowie&rsquo;s apartment. &ldquo;She just headed home. I was about to close up shop soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi hummed in realisation, balancing on the balls of her feet, her hands stuffed in the pocket of her coat. &ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll go there then. Thanks Amber,&rdquo; She said, smiling at Amber as she began to walk away. But, she felt a hand grab her elbow and she halted. </p><p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Amber said, her voice hesitant. &ldquo;Do you have to be somewhere else, or do you have time?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi turned around, staring at Amber, unable to believe her ears. &ldquo;Um, yeah, I have time. What for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh,&rdquo; Amber muttered, looking around as she thought. &ldquo;I, um, wanted to, do your makeup!&rdquo; She exclaimed loudly, as the idea came to her. Realising how she sounded, she coughed and said again, &ldquo;I wanna do your makeup, for practice.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at Amber&rsquo;s words, looking her up and down as she nodded her head, letting Amber hold her hand and drag her into the salon. </p><p><i>Friends do this. Yes they do. </i></p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Okay so just sit here, and I&rsquo;ll get all my stuff,&rdquo; Amber said, clasping her hands in excitement. Andi smiled at her as she skipped to the other side of the room to grab her things. But Andi was also very much aware of the rate her heart was beating at, the sound a hum instead of individual beats. She wasnt really sure how she had landed up getting her makeup done buy the cute makeup artist who she was suspecting she has liked since high school but just never truly realised it. But she was not really complaining. </p><p>Amber came back, a big box with a lot of makeup stored and she plonked it on the table. She turned to Andi with a bright smile. &ldquo;So, what look do you want? Fancy, dramatic, esrthy, natural, smoky?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi just blinked, overwhelmed by what Amber was saying, not really listening when she was looking at her with so much excitement and joy. &ldquo;Um, natural, I guess? I&rsquo;m not actually going anywhere after this so.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber clapped her hands. &ldquo;Natural it is! Okay, so we&rsquo;ll start with primer.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber pulled out a tube and squeezed some product onto her hand, but pausing to look at Andi. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be using my hands. That&rsquo;s okay right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah of course,&rdquo; Andi said, shrugging. <i>She wouldn&rsquo;t at all be flustered by this. Oh no. </i></p><p>Amber smiled, moving closer to Andi and leaning toward her, rubbing the primer on Andi&rsquo;s cheeks and forehead, eyes focused on the task. Andi just held her breath, the sound of her pounding heart the only thing audible to her. Amber wasnt even leaning that close to her, but it was enough to make Andi want to scream triumphantly down the street. She was practically fangirling over how soft Amber&rsquo;s hands were in her head. Unfortunately, as soon as she started, Amber was done with primer and turned away from her. But before she turned, Andi caught sight of her and, <i>were Amber&rsquo;s cheeks redder than when they had started? </i></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, now foundation,&rdquo; Amber announced, picking out a few bottles. After some testing and searching, she found the shade that matched Andi the best and put some on the back of her hand, regrettably using a brush for this step. Things were quiet between them as Amber worked, and Andi tried to think of something to say. </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Andi started. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s everything been?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber just shrugged, sighing. &ldquo;The usual. Work takes up time, but I really do love it. Other than that, just Netflix binges and ice cream.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi laughed a bit, earning Amber hitting her with the brush to stay still. &ldquo;Honestly, same. Jim is tired of seeing me appear for wine and ice cream every week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same,&rdquo; Amber said, taking a break to throw a finger gun at Andi, which confused and amused her. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I spoke to TJ,&rdquo; Amber said, going back to work blending in the foundation. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah. How is he? Haven&rsquo;t spoken to him in a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine. I mean, he hasn&rsquo;t really been in a relationship since, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he and Cyrus end on good terms though?&rdquo; Andi asked, turning to look at Amber, who just shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;They did, and they are still friends. He just said he isn&rsquo;t ready for that right now. Too soon. Even though it&rsquo;s been 2 years.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi sighed, sitting back in the chair as Amber finished up with her foundation. As she lay there, she heard Amber hiss. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Andi asked worriedly. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna need a lot of concealer for you,&rdquo; Amber said, frowning. Andi gasped, shoving Amber in the shoulder as she giggled. </p><p>&ldquo;I will not tolerate this!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the truth, Bambi,&rdquo; Amber said, winking as she turned to hunt for concealer. </p><p><i>Bambi. </i>Amber hadn&rsquo;t called her that out loud for quite a while, and it sent the butterflies in Andi&rsquo;s stomach fluttering. <i>Amber Kippen was going to be the death of her. </i></p><p>Amber took out a wanded concealer, applying some crude lines across her face and used a brush to bend it in, again leaning towards Andi. Again, still a decent distance lay between them, but Andi couldn&rsquo;t help herself from floating to seventh heaven. </p><p>Just then, Amber&rsquo;s phone buzzed on the counter, and she looked apologetically at Andi, mumbling, &ldquo;I just need to take this.&rdquo; Andi just nodded, smiling. </p><p>Amber answered the call, walking to the other side of the room. &ldquo;Hey babe,&rdquo; She said, laughing. And Andi&rsquo;s heart sank. </p><p>Babe. She was in a relationship. Of course, she was Amber it&rsquo;s what she deserves, who wouldn&rsquo;t be in love with her. But Andi couldn&rsquo;t help the sinking feeling in her heart, knowing that she had foolishly let herself believe that she actually had a chance with Amber. With a sigh, she contemplated telling Amber she had to go home, and put and end to her sadness. But one look in the mirror made her sit back down, knowing that if she left looking the way she did, she would look ridiculous. So she sank back in the chair. </p><p><i>Getting hurt was a skill, and she had straight A&rsquo;s. </i></p><p>*</p><p>Okay so Andi was being a bit dramatic, but any and all energy and excitement had been sucked out of her when the person she was in love with had called the person she was on the phone with 'babe&rsquo;. When Amber began excitedly talking about highlighter shades, Andi just just gave a small smile and nodded her head, not trusting her voice to not be shaky. Amber had furrowed her eyes in confusion, but she wrote it off as Andi just being tired after a long day, a knot of worry winding tighter in her heart. </p><p>She had applied the highlighter without much event, the two not knowing what the other was thinking. </p><p>Amber put on a smile, diregarding her worry as she reached for the eyeshadow pallette. &ldquo;So, what colour do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked over the colours, furrowing her eyebrows. She just looked up at Amber and shrugged. </p><p>Amber sighed. &ldquo;You know, it would be helpful if you said something. Added bonus of me being able to hear your lovely voice,&rdquo; She added with a smirk. </p><p>Andi caught her breath, unsure of how to react. On one hand, that comment made her soar, heart heart dancing freely. But on the other, what she heard of the phone call brought her crashing down again. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Andi mumbled, clearing her throat. &ldquo;Just, thinking.&rdquo; She looked over the shades and picked a topey shade. &ldquo;That looked good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, for you, everything would look good,&rdquo; Amber said with a wink as she grabbed the brushes and got to work. She covered the eyelid in the shade, using two brushes, one for application and one for blending. But, somehow, Andi felt that she was leaning in closer than the other times, so much so that she could feel Amber&rsquo;s breath on her cheek. She could smell the peppermint shampoo Amber had probably used that day, and her lemon scented perfume too. <i>She was not going to live through the day. </i></p><p>Amber was done way too soon for Andi&rsquo;s taste, but she reminded herself that <i>she wasnt single. </i></p><p>Amber pulled away hesitantly, her cheeks flushed. &ldquo;Um, lips now. Right?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi couldn&rsquo;t do anything other that nod, gulping. Amber shook her head slightly, and turned around to grab a nude pink lipstick. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, just bear with me here,&rdquo; Amber warned, smiling softly. She cupped Andi&rsquo;s cheek, causing her to jump back in shock. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; She whispered to Andi. &ldquo;Just trust me.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes. &ldquo;How could I not?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber smiled, leaning in to apply the lipstick on Andi&rsquo;s lips. With Amber looking so focused, it was hard for Andi to remember that she should be trying to get over Amber, instead letting the warm fuzzy feeling take over her whole being. </p><p>Amber took in a short breath, as she moved back to grab the lip gloss. &ldquo;Hey Bambi?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi hummed in response. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just apply the lipgloss and do some last minute touches to your look.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi just nodded, smiling softly, feeling bold and reaching forward to squeeze Amber&rsquo;s hand, causing her to look away, her cheeks red. </p><p>Amber leaned in to apply the lip gloss, but something stopped her, and she set down the gloss. Confused, Andi was about to ask her what happened, but then she was struck speechles by the way Amber was looking at her. </p><p>&ldquo;Andi, I,&rdquo; Amber began, but she was cut off by Andi leaning forward and pressing her lips to Amber&rsquo;s, cupping her cheeks. Amber sighed into the kiss, running her hands through Andi&rsquo;s hair. But Andi pulled away abruptly, leaving Amber confused and worried. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, I can&rsquo;t do this,&rdquo; Andi muttered. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened? Was that not okay? I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Amber began. </p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re in a relationship. This wasnt right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what? Since when I have been in a relationship?&rdquo; Amber asked, narrowing her eyes. </p><p>Andi winced. &ldquo;You called the person you spoke to 'babe&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber&rsquo;s expression softened into a giggle. &ldquo;No!  That was just Lilia, my friend. I&rsquo;m very much single, cuz I am kinda in love with this girl in my town.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Oh is that so?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber nodded, tracing Andi&rsquo;s cheek. </p><p>Andi sighed, getting up. &ldquo;Well, i look forward to just going home to my pajamas with this makeup.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber looked at Andi curiously. &ldquo;Well, if you want, I can take you for dinner and give you a reason for having that look.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked back at Amber, surprised. &ldquo;Are you asking me out?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber sputtered, trying to figure out what to say, before just sighing. &ldquo;Yes, I am. Will you go out to dinner with me, Andi Mack?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi smiled, taking hold of Amber&rsquo;s outstretched hand. &ldquo;It would make me the happiest person ever.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~</p><p><i>Hope this was okay!! </i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\">Send me prompts and I&rsquo;ll do them in a few days! </a></b></p>",

She had just closed up shop at the craft store she ran, smiling as she recalled how a young girl had so nervously asked her to teach her how to make a bracelet. While studying, she had never expected she would remain in Shadyside, but as she strolled by, taking in the aights around her, there was no place she\u2019d rather be. Her friends we\u2019re in different places though. Buffy eventually did end up in Phoenix, but she always called, keeping in touch. Cyrus had moved to New York, studying psychology further while also working on scriptwriting on the side. Jonah had gone to LA, living out his music dreams, but always leaving messages to his friends. Thank god, their friendship was very much alive, still holding onto a bit of childhood. </p><p>As she made her way down the street, she looked ahead and spotted the familiar sign of \u2018Cloud 10\u2019, her mom Bex\u2019s pride and joy. Seeing the sign, though, made Andi\u2019s heart rate pick up. Because that wasn\u2019t the only thing Cloud 10 was. Cloud 10 was also where Amber Kippen worked as a makeup artist. </p><p>It was common knowledge how Andi and Amber went from sworn enemies, to frenemies, to acquaintances, to great friends. She was the only one of Andi\u2019s friends to also still be in Shadyside, but they hadnt hung out as much, work and adulthood getting in the way. </p><p>What was not common knowledge, however, was that one day, after a particularly hectic day, one when she hadnt woken up on the right side of the bed, Andi was trudging home in the rain, and while walking by the salon, she spotted Amber with a client. It was the first time Andi had really looked at Amber. Her scrunched up nose, her furrowed eyebrows, a soft smile on her face, her hands daintily working. And it was pretty much love at the millionth sight for Andi Mack. </p><p>Since that day, Andi had always snuck glances at Amber through the window, falling even more. She knew it was stupid what she was doing, she could very well just go in and talk to her. But something always stopped her. Texting? Not a problem at all, they texted day and night. But face to face interaction? </p><p><i>She would rather the world swallow her whole and spit her out through a volcano. </i></p><p>Normally, she would get lucky and be able to sneak a glance without Amber nlticing and just go home, a warm and fuzzy feeling in her heart.</p><p>But Andi\u2019s luck liked to do this thing once in a while, called <i>running out. </i>And it just happened to be that day. </p><p>\u201cHey Andi,\u201d Amber called out, waving to her as she walked out of the door to where Andi stood, frozen to the spot. <i>Haha conversation. Yay. This wouldn\u2019t at all be awkward. </i></p><p>\u201cHey Amber,\u201d Andi mumbled, trying to not look Amber in the eyes. Amber just narrowed her eyes in amusement, watching as Andi grew increasingly flhstered, finding it intriguing and adorable, frankly. </p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d Amber asked, trying to break the growing silence. Andi snaped out of her daze, trying to think up a reason. </p><p>\u201cI, uh. I wanted to, um, see Bex!\u201d She said, snaping her fingers as soon as she thought of her excuse. \u201cI needed to ask her for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you just missed her,\u201d Amber said with a sigh, pointing her thumb in the direction of Bex and Bowie\u2019s apartment. \u201cShe just headed home. I was about to close up shop soon.\u201d</p><p>Andi hummed in realisation, balancing on the balls of her feet, her hands stuffed in the pocket of her coat. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll go there then. Thanks Amber,\u201d She said, smiling at Amber as she began to walk away. But, she felt a hand grab her elbow and she halted. </p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Amber said, her voice hesitant. \u201cDo you have to be somewhere else, or do you have time?\u201d</p><p>Andi turned around, staring at Amber, unable to believe her ears. \u201cUm, yeah, I have time. What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d Amber muttered, looking around as she thought. \u201cI, um, wanted to, do your makeup!\u201d She exclaimed loudly, as the idea came to her. Realising how she sounded, she coughed and said again, \u201cI wanna do your makeup, for practice.\u201d</p><p>Andi couldn\u2019t help but smile at Amber\u2019s words, looking her up and down as she nodded her head, letting Amber hold her hand and drag her into the salon. </p><p><i>Friends do this.

Andi smiled at her as she skipped to the other side of the room to grab her things. But Andi was also very much aware of the rate her heart was beating at, the sound a hum instead of individual beats. She wasnt really sure how she had landed up getting her makeup done buy the cute makeup artist who she was suspecting she has liked since high school but just never truly realised it. But she was not really complaining. </p><p>Amber came back, a big box with a lot of makeup stored and she plonked it on the table. She turned to Andi with a bright smile. \u201cSo, what look do you want? Fancy, dramatic, esrthy, natural, smoky?\u201d</p><p>Andi just blinked, overwhelmed by what Amber was saying, not really listening when she was looking at her with so much excitement and joy. \u201cUm, natural, I guess?

How is he? Haven\u2019t spoken to him in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. I mean, he hasn\u2019t really been in a relationship since, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he and Cyrus end on good terms though?\u201d Andi asked, turning to look at Amber, who just shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cThey did, and they are still friends.

She had just closed up shop at the craft store she ran, smiling as she recalled how a young girl had so nervously asked her to teach her how to make a bracelet. While studying, she had never expected she would remain in Shadyside, but as she strolled by, taking in the aights around her, there was no place she\u2019d rather be. Her friends we\u2019re in different places though. Buffy eventually did end up in Phoenix, but she always called, keeping in touch. Cyrus had moved to New York, studying psychology further while also working on scriptwriting on the side. Jonah had gone to LA, living out his music dreams, but always leaving messages to his friends. Thank god, their friendship was very much alive, still holding onto a bit of childhood. </p><p>As she made her way down the street, she looked ahead and spotted the familiar sign of \u2018Cloud 10\u2019, her mom Bex\u2019s pride and joy. Seeing the sign, though, made Andi\u2019s heart rate pick up. Because that wasn\u2019t the only thing Cloud 10 was. Cloud 10 was also where Amber Kippen worked as a makeup artist. </p><p>It was common knowledge how Andi and Amber went from sworn enemies, to frenemies, to acquaintances, to great friends. She was the only one of Andi\u2019s friends to also still be in Shadyside, but they hadnt hung out as much, work and adulthood getting in the way. </p><p>What was not common knowledge, however, was that one day, after a particularly hectic day, one when she hadnt woken up on the right side of the bed, Andi was trudging home in the rain, and while walking by the salon, she spotted Amber with a client. It was the first time Andi had really looked at Amber. Her scrunched up nose, her furrowed eyebrows, a soft smile on her face, her hands daintily working. And it was pretty much love at the millionth sight for Andi Mack. </p><p>Since that day, Andi had always snuck glances at Amber through the window, falling even more. She knew it was stupid what she was doing, she could very well just go in and talk to her. But something always stopped her. Texting? Not a problem at all, they texted day and night. But face to face interaction? </p><p><i>She would rather the world swallow her whole and spit her out through a volcano. </i></p><p>Normally, she would get lucky and be able to sneak a glance without Amber nlticing and just go home, a warm and fuzzy feeling in her heart.</p><p>But Andi\u2019s luck liked to do this thing once in a while, called <i>running out. </i>And it just happened to be that day. </p><p>\u201cHey Andi,\u201d Amber called out, waving to her as she walked out of the door to where Andi stood, frozen to the spot. <i>Haha conversation. Yay. This wouldn\u2019t at all be awkward. </i></p><p>\u201cHey Amber,\u201d Andi mumbled, trying to not look Amber in the eyes. Amber just narrowed her eyes in amusement, watching as Andi grew increasingly flhstered, finding it intriguing and adorable, frankly. </p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d Amber asked, trying to break the growing silence. Andi snaped out of her daze, trying to think up a reason. </p><p>\u201cI, uh. I wanted to, um, see Bex!\u201d She said, snaping her fingers as soon as she thought of her excuse. \u201cI needed to ask her for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you just missed her,\u201d Amber said with a sigh, pointing her thumb in the direction of Bex and Bowie\u2019s apartment. \u201cShe just headed home. I was about to close up shop soon.\u201d</p><p>Andi hummed in realisation, balancing on the balls of her feet, her hands stuffed in the pocket of her coat. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll go there then. Thanks Amber,\u201d She said, smiling at Amber as she began to walk away. But, she felt a hand grab her elbow and she halted. </p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Amber said, her voice hesitant. \u201cDo you have to be somewhere else, or do you have time?\u201d</p><p>Andi turned around, staring at Amber, unable to believe her ears. \u201cUm, yeah, I have time. What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d Amber muttered, looking around as she thought. \u201cI, um, wanted to, do your makeup!\u201d She exclaimed loudly, as the idea came to her. Realising how she sounded, she coughed and said again, \u201cI wanna do your makeup, for practice.\u201d</p><p>Andi couldn\u2019t help but smile at Amber\u2019s words, looking her up and down as she nodded her head, letting Amber hold her hand and drag her into the salon. </p><p><i>Friends do this. Yes they do. </i></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cOkay so just sit here, and I\u2019ll get all my stuff,\u201d Amber said, clasping her hands in excitement. Andi smiled at her as she skipped to the other side of the room to grab her things. But Andi was also very much aware of the rate her heart was beating at, the sound a hum instead of individual beats. She wasnt really sure how she had landed up getting her makeup done buy the cute makeup artist who she was suspecting she has liked since high school but just never truly realised it. But she was not really complaining. </p><p>Amber came back, a big box with a lot of makeup stored and she plonked it on the table. She turned to Andi with a bright smile. \u201cSo, what look do you want? Fancy, dramatic, esrthy, natural, smoky?\u201d</p><p>Andi just blinked, overwhelmed by what Amber was saying, not really listening when she was looking at her with so much excitement and joy. \u201cUm, natural, I guess? I\u2019m not actually going anywhere after this so.\u201d</p><p>Amber clapped her hands. \u201cNatural it is! Okay, so we\u2019ll start with primer.\u201d</p><p>Amber pulled out a tube and squeezed some product onto her hand, but pausing to look at Andi. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be using my hands. That\u2019s okay right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah of course,\u201d Andi said, shrugging. <i>She wouldn\u2019t at all be flustered by this. Oh no. </i></p><p>Amber smiled, moving closer to Andi and leaning toward her, rubbing the primer on Andi\u2019s cheeks and forehead, eyes focused on the task. Andi just held her breath, the sound of her pounding heart the only thing audible to her. Amber wasnt even leaning that close to her, but it was enough to make Andi want to scream triumphantly down the street. She was practically fangirling over how soft Amber\u2019s hands were in her head. Unfortunately, as soon as she started, Amber was done with primer and turned away from her. But before she turned, Andi caught sight of her and, <i>were Amber\u2019s cheeks redder than when they had started? </i></p><p>\u201cOkay, now foundation,\u201d Amber announced, picking out a few bottles. After some testing and searching, she found the shade that matched Andi the best and put some on the back of her hand, regrettably using a brush for this step. Things were quiet between them as Amber worked, and Andi tried to think of something to say. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Andi started. \u201cHow\u2019s everything been?\u201d</p><p>Amber just shrugged, sighing. \u201cThe usual. Work takes up time, but I really do love it. Other than that, just Netflix binges and ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed a bit, earning Amber hitting her with the brush to stay still. \u201cHonestly, same. Jim is tired of seeing me appear for wine and ice cream every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d Amber said, taking a break to throw a finger gun at Andi, which confused and amused her. </p><p>\u201cOh, I spoke to TJ,\u201d Amber said, going back to work blending in the foundation. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah. How is he? Haven\u2019t spoken to him in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. I mean, he hasn\u2019t really been in a relationship since, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he and Cyrus end on good terms though?\u201d Andi asked, turning to look at Amber, who just shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cThey did, and they are still friends. He just said he isn\u2019t ready for that right now. Too soon. Even though it\u2019s been 2 years.\u201d</p><p>Andi sighed, sitting back in the chair as Amber finished up with her foundation. As she lay there, she heard Amber hiss. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Andi asked worriedly. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna need a lot of concealer for you,\u201d Amber said, frowning. Andi gasped, shoving Amber in the shoulder as she giggled. </p><p>\u201cI will not tolerate this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the truth, Bambi,\u201d Amber said, winking as she turned to hunt for concealer. </p><p><i>Bambi. </i>Amber hadn\u2019t called her that out loud for quite a while, and it sent the butterflies in Andi\u2019s stomach fluttering. <i>Amber Kippen was going to be the death of her. </i></p><p>Amber took out a wanded concealer, applying some crude lines across her face and used a brush to bend it in, again leaning towards Andi. Again, still a decent distance lay between them, but Andi couldn\u2019t help herself from floating to seventh heaven. </p><p>Just then, Amber\u2019s phone buzzed on the counter, and she looked apologetically at Andi, mumbling, \u201cI just need to take this.\u201d Andi just nodded, smiling. </p><p>Amber answered the call, walking to the other side of the room. \u201cHey babe,\u201d She said, laughing. And Andi\u2019s heart sank. </p><p>Babe. She was in a relationship. Of course, she was Amber it\u2019s what she deserves, who wouldn\u2019t be in love with her. But Andi couldn\u2019t help the sinking feeling in her heart, knowing that she had foolishly let herself believe that she actually had a chance with Amber. With a sigh, she contemplated telling Amber she had to go home, and put and end to her sadness. But one look in the mirror made her sit back down, knowing that if she left looking the way she did, she would look ridiculous. So she sank back in the chair. </p><p><i>Getting hurt was a skill, and she had straight A\u2019s. </i></p><p>*</p><p>Okay so Andi was being a bit dramatic, but any and all energy and excitement had been sucked out of her when the person she was in love with had called the person she was on the phone with 'babe\u2019. When Amber began excitedly talking about highlighter shades, Andi just just gave a small smile and nodded her head, not trusting her voice to not be shaky. Amber had furrowed her eyes in confusion, but she wrote it off as Andi just being tired after a long day, a knot of worry winding tighter in her heart. </p><p>She had applied the highlighter without much event, the two not knowing what the other was thinking. </p><p>Amber put on a smile, diregarding her worry as she reached for the eyeshadow pallette. \u201cSo, what colour do you want?\u201d</p><p>Andi looked over the colours, furrowing her eyebrows. She just looked up at Amber and shrugged. </p><p>Amber sighed. \u201cYou know, it would be helpful if you said something. Added bonus of me being able to hear your lovely voice,\u201d She added with a smirk. </p><p>Andi caught her breath, unsure of how to react. On one hand, that comment made her soar, heart heart dancing freely. But on the other, what she heard of the phone call brought her crashing down again. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Andi mumbled, clearing her throat. \u201cJust, thinking.\u201d She looked over the shades and picked a topey shade. \u201cThat looked good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for you, everything would look good,\u201d Amber said with a wink as she grabbed the brushes and got to work. She covered the eyelid in the shade, using two brushes, one for application and one for blending. But, somehow, Andi felt that she was leaning in closer than the other times, so much so that she could feel Amber\u2019s breath on her cheek. She could smell the peppermint shampoo Amber had probably used that day, and her lemon scented perfume too. <i>She was not going to live through the day. </i></p><p>Amber was done way too soon for Andi\u2019s taste, but she reminded herself that <i>she wasnt single. </i></p><p>Amber pulled away hesitantly, her cheeks flushed. \u201cUm, lips now. Right?\u201d</p><p>Andi couldn\u2019t do anything other that nod, gulping. Amber shook her head slightly, and turned around to grab a nude pink lipstick. </p><p>\u201cOkay, just bear with me here,\u201d Amber warned, smiling softly. She cupped Andi\u2019s cheek, causing her to jump back in shock. \u201cHey,\u201d She whispered to Andi. \u201cJust trust me.\u201d</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes. \u201cHow could I not?\u201d</p><p>Amber smiled, leaning in to apply the lipstick on Andi\u2019s lips. With Amber looking so focused, it was hard for Andi to remember that she should be trying to get over Amber, instead letting the warm fuzzy feeling take over her whole being. </p><p>Amber took in a short breath, as she moved back to grab the lip gloss. \u201cHey Bambi?\u201d</p><p>Andi hummed in response. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just apply the lipgloss and do some last minute touches to your look.\u201d</p><p>Andi just nodded, smiling softly, feeling bold and reaching forward to squeeze Amber\u2019s hand, causing her to look away, her cheeks red. </p><p>Amber leaned in to apply the lip gloss, but something stopped her, and she set down the gloss. Confused, Andi was about to ask her what happened, but then she was struck speechles by the way Amber was looking at her. </p><p>\u201cAndi, I,\u201d Amber began, but she was cut off by Andi leaning forward and pressing her lips to Amber\u2019s, cupping her cheeks. Amber sighed into the kiss, running her hands through Andi\u2019s hair. But Andi pulled away abruptly, leaving Amber confused and worried. </p><p>\u201cWait, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d Andi muttered. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Was that not okay? I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Amber began. </p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re in a relationship. This wasnt right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what? Since when I have been in a relationship?\u201d Amber asked, narrowing her eyes. </p><p>Andi winced. \u201cYou called the person you spoke to 'babe\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Amber\u2019s expression softened into a giggle. \u201cNo!  That was just Lilia, my friend. I\u2019m very much single, cuz I am kinda in love with this girl in my town.\u201d</p><p>Andi raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh is that so?\u201d</p><p>Amber nodded, tracing Andi\u2019s cheek. </p><p>Andi sighed, getting up. \u201cWell, i look forward to just going home to my pajamas with this makeup.\u201d</p><p>Amber looked at Andi curiously. \u201cWell, if you want, I can take you for dinner and give you a reason for having that look.\u201d</p><p>Andi looked back at Amber, surprised. \u201cAre you asking me out?\u201d</p><p>Amber sputtered, trying to figure out what to say, before just sighing. \u201cYes, I am. Will you go out to dinner with me, Andi Mack?\u201d</p><p>Andi smiled, taking hold of Amber\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cIt would make me the happiest person ever.\u201d</p><p>~~~~</p><p><i>Hope this was okay!! </i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\">Send me prompts and I\u2019ll do them in a few days! </a></b></p>",

Andi just held her breath, the sound of her pounding heart the only thing audible to her. Amber wasnt even leaning that close to her, but it was enough to make Andi want to scream triumphantly down the street. She was practically fangirling over how soft Amber&rsquo;s hands were in her head. Unfortunately, as soon as she started, Amber was done with primer and turned away from her. But before she turned, Andi caught sight of her and, <i>were Amber&rsquo;s cheeks redder than when they had started? </i></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, now foundation,&rdquo; Amber announced, picking out a few bottles. After some testing and searching, she found the shade that matched Andi the best and put some on the back of her hand, regrettably using a brush for this step. Things were quiet between them as Amber worked, and Andi tried to think of something to say. </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Andi started. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s everything been?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber just shrugged, sighing. &ldquo;The usual. Work takes up time, but I really do love it. Other than that, just Netflix binges and ice cream.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi laughed a bit, earning Amber hitting her with the brush to stay still. &ldquo;Honestly, same. Jim is tired of seeing me appear for wine and ice cream every week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same,&rdquo; Amber said, taking a break to throw a finger gun at Andi, which confused and amused her. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I spoke to TJ,&rdquo; Amber said, going back to work blending in the foundation. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah. How is he? Haven&rsquo;t spoken to him in a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine. I mean, he hasn&rsquo;t really been in a relationship since, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he and Cyrus end on good terms though?&rdquo; Andi asked, turning to look at Amber, who just shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;They did, and they are still friends. He just said he isn&rsquo;t ready for that right now. Too soon. Even though it&rsquo;s been 2 years.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi sighed, sitting back in the chair as Amber finished up with her foundation. As she lay there, she heard Amber hiss. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Andi asked worriedly. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna need a lot of concealer for you,&rdquo; Amber said, frowning. Andi gasped, shoving Amber in the shoulder as she giggled. </p><p>&ldquo;I will not tolerate this!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the truth, Bambi,&rdquo; Amber said, winking as she turned to hunt for concealer. </p><p><i>Bambi. </i>Amber hadn&rsquo;t called her that out loud for quite a while, and it sent the butterflies in Andi&rsquo;s stomach fluttering. <i>Amber Kippen was going to be the death of her. </i></p><p>Amber took out a wanded concealer, applying some crude lines across her face and used a brush to bend it in, again leaning towards Andi. Again, still a decent distance lay between them, but Andi couldn&rsquo;t help herself from floating to seventh heaven. </p><p>Just then, Amber&rsquo;s phone buzzed on the counter, and she looked apologetically at Andi, mumbling, &ldquo;I just need to take this.&rdquo; Andi just nodded, smiling. </p><p>Amber answered the call, walking to the other side of the room. &ldquo;Hey babe,&rdquo; She said, laughing. And Andi&rsquo;s heart sank. </p><p>Babe. She was in a relationship. Of course, she was Amber it&rsquo;s what she deserves, who wouldn&rsquo;t be in love with her. But Andi couldn&rsquo;t help the sinking feeling in her heart, knowing that she had foolishly let herself believe that she actually had a chance with Amber. With a sigh, she contemplated telling Amber she had to go home, and put and end to her sadness. But one look in the mirror made her sit back down, knowing that if she left looking the way she did, she would look ridiculous. So she sank back in the chair. </p><p><i>Getting hurt was a skill, and she had straight A&rsquo;s. </i></p><p>*</p><p>Okay so Andi was being a bit dramatic, but any and all energy and excitement had been sucked out of her when the person she was in love with had called the person she was on the phone with 'babe&rsquo;. When Amber began excitedly talking about highlighter shades, Andi just just gave a small smile and nodded her head, not trusting her voice to not be shaky. Amber had furrowed her eyes in confusion, but she wrote it off as Andi just being tired after a long day, a knot of worry winding tighter in her heart. </p><p>She had applied the highlighter without much event, the two not knowing what the other was thinking. </p><p>Amber put on a smile, diregarding her worry as she reached for the eyeshadow pallette. &ldquo;So, what colour do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked over the colours, furrowing her eyebrows. She just looked up at Amber and shrugged. </p><p>Amber sighed. &ldquo;You know, it would be helpful if you said something. Added bonus of me being able to hear your lovely voice,&rdquo; She added with a smirk. </p><p>Andi caught her breath, unsure of how to react. On one hand, that comment made her soar, heart heart dancing freely. But on the other, what she heard of the phone call brought her crashing down again. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Andi mumbled, clearing her throat. &ldquo;Just, thinking.&rdquo; She looked over the shades and picked a topey shade. &ldquo;That looked good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, for you, everything would look good,&rdquo; Amber said with a wink as she grabbed the brushes and got to work. She covered the eyelid in the shade, using two brushes, one for application and one for blending. But, somehow, Andi felt that she was leaning in closer than the other times, so much so that she could feel Amber&rsquo;s breath on her cheek. She could smell the peppermint shampoo Amber had probably used that day, and her lemon scented perfume too. <i>She was not going to live through the day. </i></p><p>Amber was done way too soon for Andi&rsquo;s taste, but she reminded herself that <i>she wasnt single. </i></p><p>Amber pulled away hesitantly, her cheeks flushed. &ldquo;Um, lips now. Right?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi couldn&rsquo;t do anything other that nod, gulping. Amber shook her head slightly, and turned around to grab a nude pink lipstick. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, just bear with me here,&rdquo; Amber warned, smiling softly. She cupped Andi&rsquo;s cheek, causing her to jump back in shock. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; She whispered to Andi. &ldquo;Just trust me.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes. &ldquo;How could I not?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber smiled, leaning in to apply the lipstick on Andi&rsquo;s lips. With Amber looking so focused, it was hard for Andi to remember that she should be trying to get over Amber, instead letting the warm fuzzy feeling take over her whole being. </p><p>Amber took in a short breath, as she moved back to grab the lip gloss. &ldquo;Hey Bambi?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi hummed in response. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just apply the lipgloss and do some last minute touches to your look.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi just nodded, smiling softly, feeling bold and reaching forward to squeeze Amber&rsquo;s hand, causing her to look away, her cheeks red. </p><p>Amber leaned in to apply the lip gloss, but something stopped her, and she set down the gloss. Confused, Andi was about to ask her what happened, but then she was struck speechles by the way Amber was looking at her. </p><p>&ldquo;Andi, I,&rdquo; Amber began, but she was cut off by Andi leaning forward and pressing her lips to Amber&rsquo;s, cupping her cheeks. Amber sighed into the kiss, running her hands through Andi&rsquo;s hair. But Andi pulled away abruptly, leaving Amber confused and worried. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, I can&rsquo;t do this,&rdquo; Andi muttered. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened? Was that not okay? I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Amber began. </p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re in a relationship. This wasnt right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what? Since when I have been in a relationship?&rdquo; Amber asked, narrowing her eyes. </p><p>Andi winced. &ldquo;You called the person you spoke to 'babe&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber&rsquo;s expression softened into a giggle. &ldquo;No!  That was just Lilia, my friend. I&rsquo;m very much single, cuz I am kinda in love with this girl in my town.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Oh is that so?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber nodded, tracing Andi&rsquo;s cheek. </p><p>Andi sighed, getting up. &ldquo;Well, i look forward to just going home to my pajamas with this makeup.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber looked at Andi curiously. &ldquo;Well, if you want, I can take you for dinner and give you a reason for having that look.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked back at Amber, surprised. &ldquo;Are you asking me out?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber sputtered, trying to figure out what to say, before just sighing. &ldquo;Yes, I am. Will you go out to dinner with me, Andi Mack?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi smiled, taking hold of Amber&rsquo;s outstretched hand. &ldquo;It would make me the happiest person ever.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~</p><p><i>Hope this was okay!! </i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\">Send me prompts and I&rsquo;ll do them in a few days! </a></b></p>",

And I don\u2019t really see Kira being jealous of Cyrus over TJ specifically, so Cyrus saying that about Kira would also be weird to me. I also don\u2019t think having such a direct parallel to a failed relationship would really fit the tone of the Tyrus relationship. </p><p>There really haven\u2019t been that many Tyrus/Jandi parallels as far as I can remember. Tyrus shares the most parallels with Muffy, and Jandi shares the most parallels with Bexie in my opinion. But really - I think that if there are any callbacks to quotes or moments we\u2019ve seen on the show, they will be moments that involve TJ and Cyrus. If they were going to bring up a past quote about jealousy, I think it would be more accurate and relevant to parallel Cyrus\u2019 first coming out scene. Buffy asking if Cyrus was jealous, assuming he liked Andi, and then realizing he liked Jonah. Except this time, I don\u2019t think his friends would even have to ask. They know he\u2019s hurt and that he\u2019s going to be jealous. </p><p>There are some pretty elaborate theories out there, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re all that impossible. Closet to relationship really isn\u2019t that hard, especially depending on how subtextual the build up remains. They\u2019re not going to focus on the \u201ccloset\u201d too much. They\u2019re going to have to explain TJ\u2019s fear, but I doubt they\u2019ll dive too deeply into the fear of people finding out he\u2019s gay. Instead, I imagine the focus will be more on his fear of Cyrus finding out he likes him. And once that\u2019s out in the open, setting up the relationship is pretty easy - especially considering they don\u2019t have to dive into anything beyond the establishment of said relationship. </p>",
