With your help, I truly believe we can bring Hell\u2019s Kitchen to its full potential and create a beautiful city,\u201d Fisk boasted proudly before walking off the stage with his entourage. </p><p>Peter turned to the fuming girl standing beside him, watching the gears in her head turn as she plotted a way to get closer to Fisk. \u201cY/n,\u201d he warned quietly as he failed to get a grasp on her wrist to hold her back.</p><p>Y/n stalked in the direction Fisk had headed, weaving through the crowd with ease. \u201cEasy there, tiger,\u201d Tony chuckled as he followed behind her before wrapping his hand around hers and pulling her to the dance floor. \u201cAnd you wonder why we call you the team hothead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, I\u2019ve learned from the best,\u201d Y/n quipped as she fell into step with Tony, causing him to chuckle. \u201cBesides, I was just gonna talk to the big fella- ruffle his feathers at most, but no-.\u201d Her eyes fell onto the man whose attention had been focused on her ever since she and Tony began their waltz. \u201cIf there was ever a time I\u2019d agree you should force me to leave I\u2019d say now would be perfect.\u201d She pulled him closer, her face mere centimeters from his shoulder to hide the fact that she was whispering. \u201cWesley. 12\u2019o clock,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>\u201cHead to the car, I\u2019ll keep him off your trail and find Pete.\u201d His demeanor softened as she looked up at him with a sacredness that was buried underneath her forced brave face. Her previously stony yet confident eyes wavered now as they glanced back at Wesley. \u00a0\u201cY/n,\u201d he pulled away so he could get a good look at her, \u201cgo now. I\u2019ll handle it kiddo.\u201d</p><p>After a small nod, Y/n stalked off, gathering whatever confidence she had left and exuding it with every step. She ignored the feeling of eyes following her as she weaved through the crowd of partygoers. The muggy June air washed over her like a cold tsunami. </p><p>\u201cKeep her safe,\u201d a booming voice spoke in a hushed tone. Y/n peeked around the corner to see Fisk facing away with his phone pressed against his ear. Y/n bit her lip as she stilled her breath. </p><p>\u201cCan I help you, Ma\u2019am,\u201d Wesley asked from behind her, startling her enough to make her nearly fall over the railing. \u201cPardon me, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d he apologized in a half-truth manner.</p><p>Y/n turned to face him as she let out an uneasy breath, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I just didn\u2019t expect to see anyone out here, thought I could find some peace and quiet,\u201d she quickly lied with a smile. The smile he returned sent a chill down her spine. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to head back in,\u201d she said more to herself than to him. She stopped mid-step once she noticed Wesley slide in between her and the doorway. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Ms. Y/l/n, but I think we both know why I can\u2019t let you do that. So, why don\u2019t you make this easy on yourself,\u201d he spoke in a low voice as he grabbed her arm. He waited for her to nod gently before leading her down the steps toward Fisk\u2019s car. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance Ms. Y/l/n,\u201d Fisk spoke cooly. His stony gaze was fixated on her, knowing the longer he stared the more she resisted the urge to fidget. </p><p>The twisting in her gut she had felt at merely being in the same room as him was nothing in comparison to now. If she wasn\u2019t so scared he\u2019d beat her to death she probably would\u2019ve worried more about the crushing feeling of his aura. Y/n pulled her lips into a tight smile, refusing to give him or Wesley the satisfaction of seeing her sweat. \u201cPlease, the pleasure is all mine.\u201d </p><p>Fisk chuckled dryly at her statement, finally taking the moment to shift his eyes towards Wesley. \u201cTake her, I have some business to attend to here before I can deal with this matter.\u201d Y/n fought every urge within herself to say some snarky reply or even a quiet quip. She wasn\u2019t dealing with just any criminal like she tended to do with Peter, this was Wilson Fisk. A man just about twice her size with the strength and political power of a bulldozer. He turned toward Y/n once again, sending a heart-chilling smile her way. \u201cI apologize for my abruptness, but I do hope this gives your little friend Spider-Man time to join us.\u201d He stepped out of the car, paying no mind to the distraught girl he left behind. </p><p>She wasn\u2019t possibly just bait to him, was she? More importantly, why did he feel the need to include Peter? She had to do something to help. What if Fisk gets to Peter before Tony does? Does he even know Peter is Spider-man?</p><p>\u201cNow I hate to do this, but considering your record,\u201d Wesley snapped her from her spiraling thoughts as he pulled a gun out. \u201cOne wrong move, if you even try to call out for help, well, I\u2019m sure a smart girl like you can figure where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know for a smart guy, you\u2019re really dumb. Do you really think I need someone to help me escape from you?\u201d Y/n scoffed before smiling at him, \u201cyou have no idea who\u2019ve you just pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Mr. Stark? You said she would be here,\u201d Peter panicked once they arrived at an empty car. \u201cWhat if she-?\u201d He trailed off as he ran his hand through his gelled down curls. \u201cWe need to go find her. I have to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid, Pete,\u201d \u00a0he tried to gain his attention, immediately putting on his dad hat. \u201cHopefully she just went back inside, you go check inside and I\u2019ll look around the building. Call me if you find anything.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, his head racing a thousand miles away. This was exactly why he hadn\u2019t wanted her to do this in the first place. But no, she just had to be the hardheaded yet recklessly brave girl that he\u2019d follow to the end of the worlds. What he wouldn\u2019t give to see her gorgeous smile or her signature eye roll that distracted people from the smirk forcing its way out. What he wouldn\u2019t give to make this night not about Fisk, but just an excuse to dress up and dance with her. To hold her in his arms and know she\u2019s safe. Peter\u2019s feet moved on their own, stalking back into the building with a mission his head hadn\u2019t been informed of, which is probably why he ran into what felt like a wall. \u201cS-Sorry mister,\u201d Peter mumbled softly with every intent to keep moving.</p><p>\u201cFisk,\u201d the \u2018wall\u2019 spoke, freezing Peter to his core. \u201cMr. Fisk,\u201d he reiterated as he turned to face Peter. \u201cThough I\u2019d assume you\u2019d know that already considering you\u2019re attending my gala.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf-of course! I apologize, I was just trying to find a friend.\u201d Peter attempted to relax under Fisk\u2019s attention. </p><p>\u201cI completely understand. It is truly a heartwrenching experience to discover the person you like has suddenly disappeared. We can only hope in a city like Hell\u2019s Kitchen that the missing person hasn\u2019t had an encounter with the wrong people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- right. It was nice talking to you Mr. Fisk, but I- um I have to go.\u201d His feet couldn\u2019t carry him back to the car as he scribbled on a napkin. Once he entered the garage Peter broke out into a sprint, stuffing the napkin in his pocket for Tony to hopefully find later. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Y/n, I\u2019m coming,\u201d he thought aloud as he hastily loosened his tie. He pulled his mask over his face, not giving a second thought to who may be around to see. Fisk had her, he could feel it even if his spider-sense hadn\u2019t picked up on anything. He tossed his clothes onto the hood of Tony\u2019s car before flinging himself off the railing. He was going to get her back no matter what and he was going to kick whoever\u2019s ass he had to to do it.</p>",

Her previously stony yet confident eyes wavered now as they glanced back at Wesley. \u00a0\u201cY/n,\u201d he pulled away so he could get a good look at her, \u201cgo now. I\u2019ll handle it kiddo.\u201d</p><p>After a small nod, Y/n stalked off, gathering whatever confidence she had left and exuding it with every step.

Y/n peeked around the corner to see Fisk facing away with his phone pressed against his ear. Y/n bit her lip as she stilled her breath. </p><p>\u201cCan I help you, Ma\u2019am,\u201d Wesley asked from behind her, startling her enough to make her nearly fall over the railing. \u201cPardon me, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d he apologized in a half-truth manner.</p><p>Y/n turned to face him as she let out an uneasy breath, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I just didn\u2019t expect to see anyone out here, thought I could find some peace and quiet,\u201d she quickly lied with a smile. The smile he returned sent a chill down her spine. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to head back in,\u201d she said more to herself than to him. She stopped mid-step once she noticed Wesley slide in between her and the doorway. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Ms. Y/l/n, but I think we both know why I can\u2019t let you do that. So, why don\u2019t you make this easy on yourself,\u201d he spoke in a low voice as he grabbed her arm. He waited for her to nod gently before leading her down the steps toward Fisk\u2019s car. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance Ms. Y/l/n,\u201d Fisk spoke cooly. His stony gaze was fixated on her, knowing the longer he stared the more she resisted the urge to fidget. </p><p>The twisting in her gut she had felt at merely being in the same room as him was nothing in comparison to now. If she wasn\u2019t so scared he\u2019d beat her to death she probably would\u2019ve worried more about the crushing feeling of his aura. Y/n pulled her lips into a tight smile, refusing to give him or Wesley the satisfaction of seeing her sweat. \u201cPlease, the pleasure is all mine.\u201d </p><p>Fisk chuckled dryly at her statement, finally taking the moment to shift his eyes towards Wesley. \u201cTake her, I have some business to attend to here before I can deal with this matter.\u201d Y/n fought every urge within herself to say some snarky reply or even a quiet quip. She wasn\u2019t dealing with just any criminal like she tended to do with Peter, this was Wilson Fisk. A man just about twice her size with the strength and political power of a bulldozer. He turned toward Y/n once again, sending a heart-chilling smile her way. \u201cI apologize for my abruptness, but I do hope this gives your little friend Spider-Man time to join us.\u201d He stepped out of the car, paying no mind to the distraught girl he left behind. </p><p>She wasn\u2019t possibly just bait to him, was she? More importantly, why did he feel the need to include Peter? She had to do something to help. What if Fisk gets to Peter before Tony does? Does he even know Peter is Spider-man?</p><p>\u201cNow I hate to do this, but considering your record,\u201d Wesley snapped her from her spiraling thoughts as he pulled a gun out. \u201cOne wrong move, if you even try to call out for help, well, I\u2019m sure a smart girl like you can figure where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know for a smart guy, you\u2019re really dumb. Do you really think I need someone to help me escape from you?\u201d Y/n scoffed before smiling at him, \u201cyou have no idea who\u2019ve you just pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, Mr. Stark? You said she would be here,\u201d Peter panicked once they arrived at an empty car. \u201cWhat if she-?\u201d He trailed off as he ran his hand through his gelled down curls. \u201cWe need to go find her. I have to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid, Pete,\u201d \u00a0he tried to gain his attention, immediately putting on his dad hat. \u201cHopefully she just went back inside, you go check inside and I\u2019ll look around the building. Call me if you find anything.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, his head racing a thousand miles away. This was exactly why he hadn\u2019t wanted her to do this in the first place. But no, she just had to be the hardheaded yet recklessly brave girl that he\u2019d follow to the end of the worlds. What he wouldn\u2019t give to see her gorgeous smile or her signature eye roll that distracted people from the smirk forcing its way out. What he wouldn\u2019t give to make this night not about Fisk, but just an excuse to dress up and dance with her. To hold her in his arms and know she\u2019s safe. Peter\u2019s feet moved on their own, stalking back into the building with a mission his head hadn\u2019t been informed of, which is probably why he ran into what felt like a wall. \u201cS-Sorry mister,\u201d Peter mumbled softly with every intent to keep moving.</p><p>\u201cFisk,\u201d the \u2018wall\u2019 spoke, freezing Peter to his core. \u201cMr. Fisk,\u201d he reiterated as he turned to face Peter. \u201cThough I\u2019d assume you\u2019d know that already considering you\u2019re attending my gala.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf-of course! I apologize, I was just trying to find a friend.\u201d Peter attempted to relax under Fisk\u2019s attention. </p><p>\u201cI completely understand. It is truly a heartwrenching experience to discover the person you like has suddenly disappeared. We can only hope in a city like Hell\u2019s Kitchen that the missing person hasn\u2019t had an encounter with the wrong people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- right. It was nice talking to you Mr. Fisk, but I- um I have to go.\u201d His feet couldn\u2019t carry him back to the car as he scribbled on a napkin. Once he entered the garage Peter broke out into a sprint, stuffing the napkin in his pocket for Tony to hopefully find later. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Y/n, I\u2019m coming,\u201d he thought aloud as he hastily loosened his tie. He pulled his mask over his face, not giving a second thought to who may be around to see. Fisk had her, he could feel it even if his spider-sense hadn\u2019t picked up on anything. He tossed his clothes onto the hood of Tony\u2019s car before flinging himself off the railing. He was going to get her back no matter what and he was going to kick whoever\u2019s ass he had to to do it.</p></p>",

I&rsquo;ll handle it kiddo.&rdquo;</p><p>After a small nod, Y/n stalked off, gathering whatever confidence she had left and exuding it with every step. She ignored the feeling of eyes following her as she weaved through the crowd of partygoers. The muggy June air washed over her like a cold tsunami. </p><p>&ldquo;Keep her safe,&rdquo; a booming voice spoke in a hushed tone. Y/n peeked around the corner to see Fisk facing away with his phone pressed against his ear. Y/n bit her lip as she stilled her breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Wesley asked from behind her, startling her enough to make her nearly fall over the railing. &ldquo;Pardon me, I didn&rsquo;t mean to startle you,&rdquo; he apologized in a half-truth manner.</p><p>Y/n turned to face him as she let out an uneasy breath, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I just didn&rsquo;t expect to see anyone out here, thought I could find some peace and quiet,&rdquo; she quickly lied with a smile. The smile he returned sent a chill down her spine. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to head back in,&rdquo; she said more to herself than to him. She stopped mid-step once she noticed Wesley slide in between her and the doorway. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Ms. Y/l/n, but I think we both know why I can&rsquo;t let you do that. So, why don&rsquo;t you make this easy on yourself,&rdquo; he spoke in a low voice as he grabbed her arm. He waited for her to nod gently before leading her down the steps toward Fisk&rsquo;s car. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance Ms. Y/l/n,&rdquo; Fisk spoke cooly. His stony gaze was fixated on her, knowing the longer he stared the more she resisted the urge to fidget. </p><p>The twisting in her gut she had felt at merely being in the same room as him was nothing in comparison to now. If she wasn&rsquo;t so scared he&rsquo;d beat her to death she probably would&rsquo;ve worried more about the crushing feeling of his aura. Y/n pulled her lips into a tight smile, refusing to give him or Wesley the satisfaction of seeing her sweat. &ldquo;Please, the pleasure is all mine.&rdquo; </p><p>Fisk chuckled dryly at her statement, finally taking the moment to shift his eyes towards Wesley. &ldquo;Take her, I have some business to attend to here before I can deal with this matter.&rdquo; Y/n fought every urge within herself to say some snarky reply or even a quiet quip. She wasn&rsquo;t dealing with just any criminal like she tended to do with Peter, this was Wilson Fisk. A man just about twice her size with the strength and political power of a bulldozer. He turned toward Y/n once again, sending a heart-chilling smile her way. &ldquo;I apologize for my abruptness, but I do hope this gives your little friend Spider-Man time to join us.&rdquo; He stepped out of the car, paying no mind to the distraught girl he left behind. </p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t possibly just bait to him, was she? More importantly, why did he feel the need to include Peter? She had to do something to help. What if Fisk gets to Peter before Tony does? Does he even know Peter is Spider-man?</p><p>&ldquo;Now I hate to do this, but considering your record,&rdquo; Wesley snapped her from her spiraling thoughts as he pulled a gun out. &ldquo;One wrong move, if you even try to call out for help, well, I&rsquo;m sure a smart girl like you can figure where I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know for a smart guy, you&rsquo;re really dumb. Do you really think I need someone to help me escape from you?&rdquo; Y/n scoffed before smiling at him, &ldquo;you have no idea who&rsquo;ve you just pissed off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is she, Mr. Stark? You said she would be here,&rdquo; Peter panicked once they arrived at an empty car. &ldquo;What if she-?&rdquo; He trailed off as he ran his hand through his gelled down curls. &ldquo;We need to go find her. I have to find her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, Pete,&rdquo; &nbsp;he tried to gain his attention, immediately putting on his dad hat. &ldquo;Hopefully she just went back inside, you go check inside and I&rsquo;ll look around the building. Call me if you find anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded, his head racing a thousand miles away. This was exactly why he hadn&rsquo;t wanted her to do this in the first place. But no, she just had to be the hardheaded yet recklessly brave girl that he&rsquo;d follow to the end of the worlds. What he wouldn&rsquo;t give to see her gorgeous smile or her signature eye roll that distracted people from the smirk forcing its way out. What he wouldn&rsquo;t give to make this night not about Fisk, but just an excuse to dress up and dance with her. To hold her in his arms and know she&rsquo;s safe. Peter&rsquo;s feet moved on their own, stalking back into the building with a mission his head hadn&rsquo;t been informed of, which is probably why he ran into what felt like a wall. &ldquo;S-Sorry mister,&rdquo; Peter mumbled softly with every intent to keep moving.</p><p>&ldquo;Fisk,&rdquo; the &lsquo;wall&rsquo; spoke, freezing Peter to his core. &ldquo;Mr. Fisk,&rdquo; he reiterated as he turned to face Peter. &ldquo;Though I&rsquo;d assume you&rsquo;d know that already considering you&rsquo;re attending my gala.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of-of course! I apologize, I was just trying to find a friend.&rdquo; Peter attempted to relax under Fisk&rsquo;s attention. </p><p>&ldquo;I completely understand. It is truly a heartwrenching experience to discover the person you like has suddenly disappeared. We can only hope in a city like Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen that the missing person hasn&rsquo;t had an encounter with the wrong people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- right. It was nice talking to you Mr. Fisk, but I- um I have to go.&rdquo; His feet couldn&rsquo;t carry him back to the car as he scribbled on a napkin. Once he entered the garage Peter broke out into a sprint, stuffing the napkin in his pocket for Tony to hopefully find later. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Y/n, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; he thought aloud as he hastily loosened his tie. He pulled his mask over his face, not giving a second thought to who may be around to see. Fisk had her, he could feel it even if his spider-sense hadn&rsquo;t picked up on anything. He tossed his clothes onto the hood of Tony&rsquo;s car before flinging himself off the railing. He was going to get her back no matter what and he was going to kick whoever&rsquo;s ass he had to to do it.</p></p>",

A moonbeam gently filtered in through the almost closed blinds, and there was white noise coming softly from a machine in the corner. The scent of bergamot floated from an essential oil diffuser on a small table. In short, the calm, dreamy setup was perfect for a couple who just needed some rest. One man would argue that his partner needed to be getting MORE rest, but that was neither here nor there. Stephen, the taller of the two, held a half asleep Tony in his arms, softly tracing stars onto his back. Tony, content in his lover\u2019s embrace, smirked. See, he\u2019d been feeling very impish recently (a side effect of visiting Thor and the redeemed but mischievous Loki on Asgard), and Peter had shown him a reaction image (a meme? Tony didn\u2019t know. He could hardly keep up with his son) and it had a question that he desperately wanted to ask Stephen. Tony yawned and snuggled further into Stephen\u2019s chest, smiling as Stephen hugged him tighter and dropped a kiss on his head. Now was as good as any time to ask a weird ass question. Tony yawned again and reached up to ruffle Stephen\u2019s hair. What could he say, the sorcerer supreme liked to cuddle. Tony often thought he should be called the snuggler supreme, and if that was his contact name for Stephen in his phone, nobody had to know. \u201cSteph?\u201d Tony asked, softly rubbing Stephen\u2019s cheek. \u201cHm?\u201d Stephen replied, tiredness present in his voice. \u201cNot to get political or anything, but what the fuck is oatmeal?\u201d Tony asked, barely able to contain his laughter. Stephen, despite himself, laughed. \u201cTony,\u201d he said, \u201cPeter showed me that meme earlier today.
