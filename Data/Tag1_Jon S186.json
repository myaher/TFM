So, now, let\u2019s do this!)</i><br/><br/>Euron Greyjoy laid in his bed aboard the <i>Silence</i>, looking down at the young man beside him, smiling to himself he ran his fingertips over pale skin made even paler by the moonlight shinning through the cabin window.<br/><br/>When he had returned to the Iron Islands to overthrow Balon, to reunite his elder brother with their brothers already lost to death, the last thing he had expected to find was his Northern raised nephew along with the half-brother of the fearsome King in the North trying to persuade Balon to align himself, and the Iron Islands, with Robb Stark.<br/><br/>Jon Snow, the bastard of Winterfell, had been the most beautiful thing Euron had ever lain eyes on. Pale skinned with dark curls framing that beautiful face and dark grey eyes, sharp and cunning as a crow while being as watchful and determined as the giant direwolf that prowled like a white shadow behind him. Euron had known instantly that he wanted Jon. And, to have him, that meant ensuring Balon, who had already refused an alliance, would not be around to interfere with things.<br/><br/>An alliance meant Jon\u2019s trust. Meant the young man\u2019s gratitude. Meant that Jon would see him as an ally rather than a potential enemy. Euron knew had best to play people. He\u2019d been doing it all his life. And, really, he\u2019d been planning to kill Balon for years, meeting Jon had just given him a better reason to do so.<br/><br/>It had been easy to throw Balon from the walkway. Almost as easy as having himself declared king. Really, his only competition had been his brother\u2019s children, a son raised not in the Islands but in the North, who dressed and acted like a Northerner, a daughter who was all but dismissed from the beginning, and his brother Victarion who, though a strong captain and warrior, had no love of the people and no idea how to inspire it.<br/><br/>Euron\u2019s first act had been to agree to Robb Stark\u2019s alliance, sending men, including his brother and nephew, to offer naval and foot support to the King in the North, while insisting that Jon remain with him to help him formulate a plan to better secure not only the Iron Islands but the Northern coasts as well should the Lannister and royal fleets attempt to strike once they learned of the alliance.<br/><br/>Truthfully, it hadn\u2019t taken much to coax Jon into his bed. A few gentle words, a few light touches, and Jon had warmed to him. A blind man could see how love starved the young man was and Euron took full advantage of that. Whispering honey-sweet words into Jon\u2019s ears, promises that, if Euron had his way, he would keep in full. He wanted Jon with him and that meant keeping him happy.<br/><br/>It had been after a night of drinking, that Jon had first joined him in bed, the young man crawling over him, a wolf stalking its prey and Euron had all but hummed with excitement and pleasure before reverse their positions and laying claim to the younger man.<br/><br/>Tonight had been no different, taking Jon to bed was now as easy as breathing and, sitting there, watching Jon sleep, Euron couldn\u2019t help but think of how Jon had sounded and looked beneath him. Like some graceful, beautiful northern god.<br/><br/>A quiet murmur drew his attention to Jon\u2019s face and he found the younger man watching him sleepily even as a hand caught his, fingers tangling together, making his smile widen.<br/><br/>\u201cI love you,\u201d Jon whispered and Euron\u2019s blood sang in his veins as he leaned down to press a kiss to Jon\u2019s lips.<br/><br/>He knew what he felt for Jon wasn\u2019t love. Not truly. Not like the love Jon now felt for him. To say it was would be a lie. But, Euron thought, moving to be between Jon\u2019s legs once again, it was likely as close as a man like himself would ever get and, kissing Jon, holding him, reaching down between the younger man\u2019s legs, drinking down Jon\u2019s gasps and cries, he knew he would do whatever he had to to keep Jon.<br/><br/>The Greyjoy sigil was, after all, a kraken, and what a kraken grasped once it would never surrender.</p>",
