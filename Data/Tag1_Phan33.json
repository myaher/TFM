        "body": "<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br/></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 2.1k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing </p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/45036658/\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p><!-- more --><p>Phil doesn\u2019t bring up the Instastory to Dan. He let\u2019s Dan remain asleep on his chest even though his heart is beating so fast that surely, Dan can feel it under his head. Phil texted Martyn back saying that he definitely did not see it and it made him feel a bit sick.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe didn\u2019t want to believe that Dan did it on purpose. A part of him tells him that he hopes that Dan was messing around and went to delete it and posted it instead. But another part was punching his gut and telling him that Dan posted that photo to get a rise out of everyone. He wanted people to to be tense about this.\u00a0</p><p>\tFor many people, seeing Spike on Dan\u2019s instastory was probably not even weird. They just assumed that maybe Dan adopted a dog or he was with a dog for emotional support. Dan did mention sometimes in interviews that he would go to specialized places for emotional support animals and sometimes hold the dogs for a bit and play with them. Maybe people assumed the same.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut for other people, the hardcore stans of Dan and some even of Phil, they would recognize Spike from Phil\u2019s Twitter and Instagram. They would recognize his blue collar and his distinct markings on his fur. There is no mistaking that that is Spike in Dan\u2019s photo.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd furthermore, the headlines on social media definitely are saying the same.\u00a0</p><p>\tWas this why PJ and Gemma were acting so weird earlier? Had they seen the post and both just never told Phil? Did they assume that Phil approved to the post?\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s head was swimming and he was finding it hard to form his thoughts coherently.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan woke up a little before midnight, rubbing his eyes a bit before sitting up and rolling off from Phil and kneeling onto the floor next to the couch as he woke up. He then stood up and Phil just smiled at him and Dan gave him a strange look as he pushed his hair back down into place from being matted up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asks. \u201cDid I crush you while I was sleeping? You could have shoved me off. I wouldn\u2019t have minded.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Phil realizes after he spoke that his voice is tight and constricted.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan furrowed his brows. \u201cOkay, well now I definitely know something is wrong so tell me what\u2019s up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sighed. \u201cWhy did you do it, Dan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s face fell and Phil watches as his eyes glassed over. \u201cDo what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPost that story on your Instagram!\u201d Phil doesn\u2019t know when his voice decided to rise in volume but the way Dan flinched told him he definitely was on the verge of yelling. He didn\u2019t want to yell. He was just upset.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I meant nothing by that!\u201d Dan quickly pushed. \u201cI posted it as just a stupid thing. I can delete it, I promise!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cEveryone has seen it Dan!\u201d Phil countered. \u201cThe media has seen it. The fans have seen it. Everyone knows that that is my dog in that Instastory.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I wasn\u2019t thinking\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe said we were going to be more careful so we could have our privacy!\u201d Phil interrupted. \u201cAnd you broke it by posting that!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan and watched as a stray tear fell down his cheek and suddenly, he felt awful and his heart felt even more strained that it before. He immediately slipped off from the couch and kneeled next to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dan whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Phil said, reaching up and placing his hand gently on Dan\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for getting upset.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shook his head and removed Phil\u2019s hand from his cheek. \u201cNo, don\u2019t apologize. I was a dumbass. You can just tell me that straight up.\u201d He let out a watery sigh and reached up, wiping the unshed tears from under his eyes. \u201cI probably just a made a giant fucking mess and Marianne is gonna kill me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan reached down and pulled his phone out of his pocket and let out a loud sigh. \u201c35 missed calls, all from Marianne.\u201d He stood up and ran his hand through his hair. \u201cI have to call her back and make some phone calls.

He let\u2019s Dan remain asleep on his chest even though his heart is beating so fast that surely, Dan can feel it under his head. Phil texted Martyn back saying that he definitely did not see it and it made him feel a bit sick.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe didn\u2019t want to believe that Dan did it on purpose. A part of him tells him that he hopes that Dan was messing around and went to delete it and posted it instead. But another part was punching his gut and telling him that Dan posted that photo to get a rise out of everyone. He wanted people to to be tense about this.\u00a0</p><p>\tFor many people, seeing Spike on Dan\u2019s instastory was probably not even weird. They just assumed that maybe Dan adopted a dog or he was with a dog for emotional support. Dan did mention sometimes in interviews that he would go to specialized places for emotional support animals and sometimes hold the dogs for a bit and play with them. Maybe people assumed the same.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut for other people, the hardcore stans of Dan and some even of Phil, they would recognize Spike from Phil\u2019s Twitter and Instagram. They would recognize his blue collar and his distinct markings on his fur. There is no mistaking that that is Spike in Dan\u2019s photo.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd furthermore, the headlines on social media definitely are saying the same.\u00a0</p><p>\tWas this why PJ and Gemma were acting so weird earlier? Had they seen the post and both just never told Phil? Did they assume that Phil approved to the post?\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s head was swimming and he was finding it hard to form his thoughts coherently.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan woke up a little before midnight, rubbing his eyes a bit before sitting up and rolling off from Phil and kneeling onto the floor next to the couch as he woke up. He then stood up and Phil just smiled at him and Dan gave him a strange look as he pushed his hair back down into place from being matted up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asks. \u201cDid I crush you while I was sleeping? You could have shoved me off. I wouldn\u2019t have minded.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Phil realizes after he spoke that his voice is tight and constricted.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan furrowed his brows. \u201cOkay, well now I definitely know something is wrong so tell me what\u2019s up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sighed. \u201cWhy did you do it, Dan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s face fell and Phil watches as his eyes glassed over. \u201cDo what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPost that story on your Instagram!\u201d Phil doesn\u2019t know when his voice decided to rise in volume but the way Dan flinched told him he definitely was on the verge of yelling. He didn\u2019t want to yell. He was just upset.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I meant nothing by that!\u201d Dan quickly pushed. \u201cI posted it as just a stupid thing. I can delete it, I promise!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cEveryone has seen it Dan!\u201d Phil countered. \u201cThe media has seen it. The fans have seen it.

He immediately slipped off from the couch and kneeled next to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dan whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Phil said, reaching up and placing his hand gently on Dan\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for getting upset.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shook his head and removed Phil\u2019s hand from his cheek. \u201cNo, don\u2019t apologize. I was a dumbass. You can just tell me that straight up.\u201d He let out a watery sigh and reached up, wiping the unshed tears from under his eyes. \u201cI probably just a made a giant fucking mess and Marianne is gonna kill me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan reached down and pulled his phone out of his pocket and let out a loud sigh. \u201c35 missed calls, all from Marianne.\u201d He stood up and ran his hand through his hair. \u201cI have to call her back and make some phone calls. I need someplace quiet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded and looked up at him. \u201cYou can take my room.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded and flashed him a smile but Phil could tell how much this was bothering him now that he was witnessing the implications of something he thought was going to be a simple post.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shut the door behind him to the bedroom and Phil never heard a word that was said by him to Marianne or anyone else he was talking to.

He let\u2019s Dan remain asleep on his chest even though his heart is beating so fast that surely, Dan can feel it under his head. Phil texted Martyn back saying that he definitely did not see it and it made him feel a bit sick.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe didn\u2019t want to believe that Dan did it on purpose. A part of him tells him that he hopes that Dan was messing around and went to delete it and posted it instead. But another part was punching his gut and telling him that Dan posted that photo to get a rise out of everyone. He wanted people to to be tense about this.\u00a0</p><p>\tFor many people, seeing Spike on Dan\u2019s instastory was probably not even weird. They just assumed that maybe Dan adopted a dog or he was with a dog for emotional support. Dan did mention sometimes in interviews that he would go to specialized places for emotional support animals and sometimes hold the dogs for a bit and play with them. Maybe people assumed the same.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut for other people, the hardcore stans of Dan and some even of Phil, they would recognize Spike from Phil\u2019s Twitter and Instagram. They would recognize his blue collar and his distinct markings on his fur. There is no mistaking that that is Spike in Dan\u2019s photo.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd furthermore, the headlines on social media definitely are saying the same.\u00a0</p><p>\tWas this why PJ and Gemma were acting so weird earlier? Had they seen the post and both just never told Phil? Did they assume that Phil approved to the post?\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s head was swimming and he was finding it hard to form his thoughts coherently.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan woke up a little before midnight, rubbing his eyes a bit before sitting up and rolling off from Phil and kneeling onto the floor next to the couch as he woke up. He then stood up and Phil just smiled at him and Dan gave him a strange look as he pushed his hair back down into place from being matted up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asks. \u201cDid I crush you while I was sleeping? You could have shoved me off. I wouldn\u2019t have minded.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Phil realizes after he spoke that his voice is tight and constricted.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan furrowed his brows. \u201cOkay, well now I definitely know something is wrong so tell me what\u2019s up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sighed. \u201cWhy did you do it, Dan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s face fell and Phil watches as his eyes glassed over. \u201cDo what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPost that story on your Instagram!\u201d Phil doesn\u2019t know when his voice decided to rise in volume but the way Dan flinched told him he definitely was on the verge of yelling. He didn\u2019t want to yell. He was just upset.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I meant nothing by that!\u201d Dan quickly pushed. \u201cI posted it as just a stupid thing. I can delete it, I promise!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cEveryone has seen it Dan!\u201d Phil countered. \u201cThe media has seen it. The fans have seen it. Everyone knows that that is my dog in that Instastory.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I wasn\u2019t thinking\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe said we were going to be more careful so we could have our privacy!\u201d Phil interrupted. \u201cAnd you broke it by posting that!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan and watched as a stray tear fell down his cheek and suddenly, he felt awful and his heart felt even more strained that it before. He immediately slipped off from the couch and kneeled next to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dan whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Phil said, reaching up and placing his hand gently on Dan\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for getting upset.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shook his head and removed Phil\u2019s hand from his cheek. \u201cNo, don\u2019t apologize. I was a dumbass. You can just tell me that straight up.\u201d He let out a watery sigh and reached up, wiping the unshed tears from under his eyes. \u201cI probably just a made a giant fucking mess and Marianne is gonna kill me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan reached down and pulled his phone out of his pocket and let out a loud sigh. \u201c35 missed calls, all from Marianne.\u201d He stood up and ran his hand through his hair. \u201cI have to call her back and make some phone calls. I need someplace quiet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded and looked up at him. \u201cYou can take my room.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded and flashed him a smile but Phil could tell how much this was bothering him now that he was witnessing the implications of something he thought was going to be a simple post.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shut the door behind him to the bedroom and Phil never heard a word that was said by him to Marianne or anyone else he was talking to. During the time he was on the phone, Phil took a shower and then let out Spike for one more sleepy bathroom break to the courtyard.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t know truly when Dan got off from the phone because he fell asleep on the couch. However, when he wakes up a short time later to his back aching, he hears the sound of sobs coming from his bedroom and it alarms him enough to wake up fully and rush in there.\u00a0</p><p>\tSeeing Dan curled into a ball on his bed, still in his clothing, hugging Spike to his chest as he cried was one of the saddest sights Phil has ever seen in his lifetime. He rushes over to the bed and climbs in behind Dan and wraps his arms around his middle and holds him close.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan eventually cries himself to sleep but Phil remains awake until his alarm goes off for work.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tWhen Phil leaves for work, Dan is still asleep, completely exhausted from crying the night before. Phil didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to him before he left but he did kiss Dan\u2019s cheek before he left and tried to ignore how it was still a bit damp.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he gets to the BBC, he has paparazzi waiting for him and ignores them by pulling the collar of his jacket up past his face and hiding as he flashes his badge and runs into the building.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ is already at his desk like always and Phil feels himself feel a bit more relaxed seeing it was just PJ this time and not Gemma. Despite it feeling a bit tense, he did appreciate being alone with PJ.\u00a0</p><p>\tThere is a silence crossing over the room for the first hour of their shift as they each worked silently, but finally PJ spoke up and broke that. \u201cI saw the Instastory.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI guessed.\u201d Phil said. \u201cAccording to the article I found online last night, they were estimating millions of people had seen it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDid Dan realize what he was doing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know, Peej.\u201d Phil said. \u201cDan was extremely upset when I brought it up to him but I really don\u2019t think he realized what was going to happen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut why did he do it?\u201d PJ questioned.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugged.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you two going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Phil said. \u201cI simply do not know what the fuck is going to happen and I don\u2019t know what the future holds anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ\u2019s eyes widened as he turned in his chair and faced Phil. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to be like that after everything you and Dan have gone through?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leaned back in his chair and rubbed his eyes with the backs of his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know, PJ. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you like this before.\u201d PJ began. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you so ready to just throw your hands up and walk away from something. You were so sure about Dan but you\u2019re actually saying you\u2019re not sure about the future anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBecause I really don\u2019t know anymore, PJ.\u201d Phil comments. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I want to be here anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHere?\u201d PJ questions.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThe BBC.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d PJ\u2019s voice is suddenly higher pitched, definitely taken aback by Phil\u2019s clarification of what he meant.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI might quit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd, I\u2019m sorry, but do what?\u201d PJ presses.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI want to work on YouTube more. I\u2019ve been neglecting my fans because of the drama and because of The BBC and I kind of just want to start fresh and focus all of my time there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you doing this because of Dan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks at him, furrowing his brows. \u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you sure that you\u2019re not just wanting to give up working here so you have the ability to\u2026galavant\u2026with Dan wherever you want to?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m just asking, Phil.\u201d PJ said. \u201cBecause you should listen to what you\u2019re telling me right now. You\u2019re considering giving up your entire career here for something like YouTube!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t need this talk today, PJ.\u201d He let out a sigh. \u201cI know how it looks. I do. But I\u2019m not happy here. I want to be able to go back and do what I always wanted to and that is YouTube.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ just nods at him and folds his arms over his chest. He doesn\u2019t say anything right away and Phil swallows down the knot that had formed in his throat. \u201cI just want you to be happy, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPj rolled his chair over to Phil\u2019s desk and rested his hands on the edge of it. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to end up doing something you regret.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ\u2019s words stuck with Phil the rest of the day.\u00a0</p><p>\tI don\u2019t want you to end up doing something you regret.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil hoped he didn\u2019t either.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe managed to get back to his flat with no paparazzi and no one calling for him.

He let&rsquo;s Dan remain asleep on his chest even though his heart is beating so fast that surely, Dan can feel it under his head. Phil texted Martyn back saying that he definitely did not see it and it made him feel a bit sick.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe didn&rsquo;t want to believe that Dan did it on purpose. A part of him tells him that he hopes that Dan was messing around and went to delete it and posted it instead. But another part was punching his gut and telling him that Dan posted that photo to get a rise out of everyone. He wanted people to to be tense about this.&nbsp;</p><p>\tFor many people, seeing Spike on Dan&rsquo;s instastory was probably not even weird. They just assumed that maybe Dan adopted a dog or he was with a dog for emotional support. Dan did mention sometimes in interviews that he would go to specialized places for emotional support animals and sometimes hold the dogs for a bit and play with them. Maybe people assumed the same.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut for other people, the hardcore stans of Dan and some even of Phil, they would recognize Spike from Phil&rsquo;s Twitter and Instagram. They would recognize his blue collar and his distinct markings on his fur. There is no mistaking that that is Spike in Dan&rsquo;s photo.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAnd furthermore, the headlines on social media definitely are saying the same.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWas this why PJ and Gemma were acting so weird earlier? Had they seen the post and both just never told Phil? Did they assume that Phil approved to the post?&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil&rsquo;s head was swimming and he was finding it hard to form his thoughts coherently.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan woke up a little before midnight, rubbing his eyes a bit before sitting up and rolling off from Phil and kneeling onto the floor next to the couch as he woke up. He then stood up and Phil just smiled at him and Dan gave him a strange look as he pushed his hair back down into place from being matted up.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Dan asks. &ldquo;Did I crush you while I was sleeping? You could have shoved me off. I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; Phil realizes after he spoke that his voice is tight and constricted.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan furrowed his brows. &ldquo;Okay, well now I definitely know something is wrong so tell me what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil sighed. &ldquo;Why did you do it, Dan?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan&rsquo;s face fell and Phil watches as his eyes glassed over. &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Post that story on your Instagram!&rdquo; Phil doesn&rsquo;t know when his voice decided to rise in volume but the way Dan flinched told him he definitely was on the verge of yelling. He didn&rsquo;t want to yell. He was just upset.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil, I meant nothing by that!&rdquo; Dan quickly pushed. &ldquo;I posted it as just a stupid thing. I can delete it, I promise!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Everyone has seen it Dan!&rdquo; Phil countered. &ldquo;The media has seen it. The fans have seen it. Everyone knows that that is my dog in that Instastory.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We said we were going to be more careful so we could have our privacy!&rdquo; Phil interrupted. &ldquo;And you broke it by posting that!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan and watched as a stray tear fell down his cheek and suddenly, he felt awful and his heart felt even more strained that it before. He immediately slipped off from the couch and kneeled next to Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Dan whispered. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Phil said, reaching up and placing his hand gently on Dan&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for getting upset.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan shook his head and removed Phil&rsquo;s hand from his cheek. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t apologize. I was a dumbass. You can just tell me that straight up.&rdquo; He let out a watery sigh and reached up, wiping the unshed tears from under his eyes. &ldquo;I probably just a made a giant fucking mess and Marianne is gonna kill me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan reached down and pulled his phone out of his pocket and let out a loud sigh. &ldquo;35 missed calls, all from Marianne.&rdquo; He stood up and ran his hand through his hair. &ldquo;I have to call her back and make some phone calls. I need someplace quiet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nodded and looked up at him. &ldquo;You can take my room.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nodded and flashed him a smile but Phil could tell how much this was bothering him now that he was witnessing the implications of something he thought was going to be a simple post.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan shut the door behind him to the bedroom and Phil never heard a word that was said by him to Marianne or anyone else he was talking to. During the time he was on the phone, Phil took a shower and then let out Spike for one more sleepy bathroom break to the courtyard.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe doesn&rsquo;t know truly when Dan got off from the phone because he fell asleep on the couch. However, when he wakes up a short time later to his back aching, he hears the sound of sobs coming from his bedroom and it alarms him enough to wake up fully and rush in there.&nbsp;</p><p>\tSeeing Dan curled into a ball on his bed, still in his clothing, hugging Spike to his chest as he cried was one of the saddest sights Phil has ever seen in his lifetime. He rushes over to the bed and climbs in behind Dan and wraps his arms around his middle and holds him close.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan eventually cries himself to sleep but Phil remains awake until his alarm goes off for work.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\tWhen Phil leaves for work, Dan is still asleep, completely exhausted from crying the night before. Phil didn&rsquo;t get a chance to talk to him before he left but he did kiss Dan&rsquo;s cheek before he left and tried to ignore how it was still a bit damp.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen he gets to the BBC, he has paparazzi waiting for him and ignores them by pulling the collar of his jacket up past his face and hiding as he flashes his badge and runs into the building.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ is already at his desk like always and Phil feels himself feel a bit more relaxed seeing it was just PJ this time and not Gemma. Despite it feeling a bit tense, he did appreciate being alone with PJ.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThere is a silence crossing over the room for the first hour of their shift as they each worked silently, but finally PJ spoke up and broke that. &ldquo;I saw the Instastory.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I guessed.&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;According to the article I found online last night, they were estimating millions of people had seen it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Did Dan realize what he was doing?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Peej.&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;Dan was extremely upset when I brought it up to him but I really don&rsquo;t think he realized what was going to happen.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But why did he do it?&rdquo; PJ questioned.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shrugged.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What are you two going to do?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I simply do not know what the fuck is going to happen and I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds anymore.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ&rsquo;s eyes widened as he turned in his chair and faced Phil. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really going to be like that after everything you and Dan have gone through?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil leaned back in his chair and rubbed his eyes with the backs of his hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, PJ. I just don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen you like this before.&rdquo; PJ began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen you so ready to just throw your hands up and walk away from something. You were so sure about Dan but you&rsquo;re actually saying you&rsquo;re not sure about the future anymore.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Because I really don&rsquo;t know anymore, PJ.&rdquo; Phil comments. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know if I want to be here anymore.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; PJ questions.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;The BBC.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What?&rdquo; PJ&rsquo;s voice is suddenly higher pitched, definitely taken aback by Phil&rsquo;s clarification of what he meant.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I might quit.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And, I&rsquo;m sorry, but do what?&rdquo; PJ presses.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I want to work on YouTube more. I&rsquo;ve been neglecting my fans because of the drama and because of The BBC and I kind of just want to start fresh and focus all of my time there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you doing this because of Dan?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looks at him, furrowing his brows. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you sure that you&rsquo;re not just wanting to give up working here so you have the ability to&hellip;galavant&hellip;with Dan wherever you want to?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just asking, Phil.&rdquo; PJ said. &ldquo;Because you should listen to what you&rsquo;re telling me right now. You&rsquo;re considering giving up your entire career here for something like YouTube!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need this talk today, PJ.&rdquo; He let out a sigh. &ldquo;I know how it looks. I do. But I&rsquo;m not happy here. I want to be able to go back and do what I always wanted to and that is YouTube.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ just nods at him and folds his arms over his chest. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything right away and Phil swallows down the knot that had formed in his throat. &ldquo;I just want you to be happy, Phil.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my best friend.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPj rolled his chair over to Phil&rsquo;s desk and rested his hands on the edge of it. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want you to end up doing something you regret.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ&rsquo;s words stuck with Phil the rest of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>\tI don&rsquo;t want you to end up doing something you regret.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil hoped he didn&rsquo;t either.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe managed to get back to his flat with no paparazzi and no one calling for him. When he went to unlock the door, it suddenly opened and Dan nearly ran into him, in a rush to get wherever he needed to be.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I have to head out to meet up with Marianne. She took the first flight available to London and she just arrived and it going to her London based office right now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh okay.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back before it&rsquo;s too late tonight, hopefully.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I took Spike out and cleaned your bedroom a bit since I cried all over your sheets last night.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan&rsquo;s face flushed at that and Phil just shook his head. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t need to do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I wanted to.&rdquo; Dan said. He looked down at his phone and sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running late so I have to go now. My car is picking me up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan&rsquo;s lips crack up in a smile and leans forward, pressing their lips together gently.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil pecks his lips and then moves back and lets Dan rush past him as he throws up his hood and rushes to his black cab and gets inside.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil walks into his flat and gives Spike his well deserved attention and then finds his feet carrying him to the bedroom. He laughs a bit at seeing how Dan really did redress the bed but he found it so endearing and nice that he just falls onto the comforter and is lulled into a nap not long after.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\tSomething was buzzing in Phil&rsquo;s hip bone and it wasn&rsquo;t pleasant. In fact, Phil kind of wants it to stop. He pushes his hand under his thigh and reaches around until he feels the buzzing object and picks it up, bringing it up to his eye-level.&nbsp;</p><p>\t7 Missed Calls from: Dan&nbsp;</p><p>\t6 Missed Calls from: Martyn&nbsp;</p><p>\t10 Missed Calls from: Mum&nbsp;</p><p>\t2 Texts from: PJ&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil was confused. What the fuck?&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis reaction was to call Dan so he immediately called Dan back.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;OH MY GOD PHIL! WHY WEREN&rsquo;T YOU ANSWERING?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil sits up in bed, his heart racing. &ldquo;What is happening? Are you okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan sniffles on the other side and Phil feels his heart fall out of his body. Dan was crying? What was happening.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil, it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What&rsquo;s over?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil&hellip;I&hellip;go on Twitter.&rdquo; Dan sniffles a bit on the other end.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil quickly takes his phone away from his ear and puts Dan on speaker phone as he shakily presses his thumb against the Twitter app. He goes under the headlines and moments and he audibly gasps.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Daniel Howell Spotted Sharing a Sweet Kiss with Boyfriend in London&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>\tUnderneath, there is a picture of him and Dan kissing on the doorstep of the building of his flat.&nbsp;</p>",
