Jack met his eyes, bent his head in shame and looked away.</p><p>Jack stood trembling trying to master his terror, only now noticing the bodies that littered the field. He wasn\u2019t trained for war. It was one thing to defend yourself, to learn the ways to move to take down an attacker. It was something else to go willingly into combat when death was scattered at your feet. And the portal called to him. Called to the thing that he kept leashed with magic and memory. Promised it power. Revenge. Bloodshed. This was a war on two sides and he dared not tell Loki lest he be seen as a liability. Jack chanted under his breath invoking the bindings carved into his skin and pale blue light glowed softly over his armor, covering him in a gossamer web.</p><p>He finished the spell and caught the last few words of the brothers&rsquo; whispered conference.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust him.\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cTrust my judgement, brother.\u201d Loki answered. </p><p>Thor raised his battleax and with a thunderclap he was descending on the ranks of the invaders. \u00a0 Lightning forked and stabbed blowing the groups apart, some of the insectoids scattered, but more of them turned to attack the thunder god. To Jack\u2019s amazement Thor retreated across the field as the creatures poured after him. It was at this moment Loki squeezed his arm again and they were suddenly within feet of the portal. Jack swayed, the teleportation was disorienting, but this close the darkness was singing to him in a thousand leering voices. He took a step back from it.</p><!-- more --><p>Loki shook him.</p><p>\u201cLittle demon, watch my back while I unmake the rip between worlds.\u201d Loki said and released his grip.</p><p>Jack wanted to scream at Loki that he couldn\u2019t be here, that the other side was pounding its magic in his veins. That Corbin needed him and he shouldn&rsquo;t be here. That he wasn\u2019t any kind of a warrior. Instead he turned his back to Loki and the portal and braced his feet, the naginata in his hands. He could feel Loki\u2019s magic building in a whirlwind of power. The bug things bounded across the field, turning from Thor\u2019s distraction and racing to protect the doorway. Air cars circled and jetted toward them. The shaft of the weapon was slick from his sweating palms, and at the first strike it turned in his grip and he hit the bug with the side of the blade instead of the edge. It was knocked back into the second attacker. The delay as they disentangled allowed Jack to freeze off the sweat and take a firmer grip. </p><p>Then it was all movement and magic. The shield above them to protect form the blasts of the flying machines, the blade blurring as Jack slashed and stabbed, striking with wings and feet and once even his tail to pull an enemy off balance. And the whole time the terrible screaming in his head got louder and louder, no longer able to seduce him, it tormented him with threats of its vengeance.</p><p>Lightning was flickering around them, and once a giant green thing plowed through the field tossing insectoids as it charged past. There were explosions overhead and red and gold streaked across the sky. It was chaos and noise, the stench of burnt machine and flesh, the smell of blood and ichor and the reek of shit and piss from the dead. Horror overwhelmed Jack and he was screaming as he struck out. Too scared to run, he fought on driving the things back from where Loki cursed and wrestled the dark power that held the portal open. \u00a0He felt a tightening at his belly and then Loki was tapping into Jack\u2019s own magic, pulling power away from his bindings. \u00a0Jack cried out, without the bindings the dark part of his nature might get lose again. He didn\u2019t have time to fret because a second wave of attackers were on them and he lost himself in the deadly dance.</p><p>The screaming in his mind cut off like a switch had been flipped. Jack saw the last of the bugs destroyed by Thor\u2019s battleax before it could get close. \u00a0He took a ragged breath and looked about him. The remains of the invasion force was dead or dying. He was soaked in yellowish ichor and bright drops of blood spattered his armor. \u00a0An insectoid was on its back, its legs kicking in its death throws. \u00a0Loki sat on the ground behind him white faced and panting. Thor was hurrying toward them grinning, he paused to dispatch one of the wounded creatures. \u00a0Jack turned to Loki, took two paces \u00a0from the carnage and dropped to the ground on his hands and knees, the naginata fell beside him. He vomited, emptying his belly, with harsh gasps. \u00a0Loki looked at him with an expression devoid of anything but exhaustion. Jack crawled to Loki\u2019s side and curled up, hugging his knees, his head tucked down and his damaged wings folded to his back. He shivered when Loki\u2019s hand tangled in his matted hair.</p><p>There were more voices and the sound of sirens. Loki rose with Thor\u2019s help and he in turn dragged Jack to his feet. Jack wrapped himself in his wings and covered his face with his hands. Loki walked away and there were other people by him now. \u00a0Jack wanted to hide, but didn\u2019t have the strength to move so he stood were he was. He heard Loki arguing with a man he called Strange and Thor\u2019s gruff attempt at peacemaking. Then a metal hand touched his shoulder and a voice, softer now without the amplification said.</p><p>\u201cHey Bat Boy you alright in there?\u201d Stark asked, concerned.</p><p>Jack lifted his tear streaked face and shook his head at Stark.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d Jack said in a harsh whisper. \u201cThe bug people are dead and I killed them. I murdered them. \u00a0And other people are dead. Everybody\u2019s dead. I\u2019m a monster and I keep killing people. There\u2019s blood all over me.\u201d</p><p>He held out his shaking hands that were splattered with ichor and asked, his voice loud in a pause in the conversations. \u201cHow do you clean off the blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Said Stark, looking around, then \u201cLoki!\u201d </p><p>Jack covered his face again, sobbing. Loki looked over, took in the situation with an annoyed expression and turned back to Strange. Tony awkwardly patted Jack\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHey. It wasn\u2019t your fault, Count Chocula.\u201d Stark said. \u201cThey invaded us. They were the ones who started the attack. You helped stop them from killing more innocent people. Am I right?\u201d </p><p>Jack nodded, wiping his eyes with the palms of his hands and his nose on his gauntlet.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m right. Genius.\u201d Stark said. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Jack sniffled. </p><p>\u201cIts OK Bat Boy. You know Rock of Ages is a real asshole.\u201d Stark commented, steering Jack toward Loki.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s his nature.\u201d</p><p>Thor smiled, \u201cJack!\u201d he boomed, striding up to them. \u201cYou did well in battle today. You will be a fine warrior in time.\u201d He raised his hand to clap Jack on the shoulder but Jack dodged away with a growl. He mantled his wings, bared his teeth and unsheathed his claws.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me.\u201d Jack snarled. \u201cI\u2019m not a goddamn warrior, I\u2019m a painter.\u201d</p><p>Thor dropped his hand and scowled at Jack, then turned away without another word.</p><p>\u201cHarsh.\u201d Stark commented. \u201cA painter? House? Landscape? Body?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook himself, folded his wings and turned back to Stark. \u201cPortrait. Jack Linden. I used to have a website. About three, four years back, not sure because of the time differential. Ever heard of Sakaar?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s where Banner was.\u201d Stark said. \u201cYou were there too? What do you know about their tech? And the wormholes. Were you there long enough to study them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve managed to anger Thor again.\u201d Loki said coming up behind them. \u201cWhat little Jack knows about wormholes and alien technology would hardly hold your attention, Stark.\u201d</p><p>The man Loki addressed as Strange was with him. He eyed Jack with suspicion and the glow of a spitting, barely controlled magic gathered around his hands. Alarmed, Jack tried to gather his own power but he was drained from the fight. Loki turned to Strange.</p><p>\u201cIs there some reason you are about to attack my property, wizard?\u201d Loki asked.</p><p>\u201cStand down Dr.\u201d Stark said raising his hands and added to Loki. \u201cProperty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a demon, a creature of evil. It does not belong on this plane.\u201d Strange said.</p><p>\u201cNot this shit again.\u201d Jack said. \u201cSpecieist much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Loki said and punched the sorcerer in the chest, launching him thirty feet across the field. As he landed Loki added, \u201cThe next time you call me to deal with a problem of your own making, I will not answer.\u201d</p><p>Loki took Jack by the wrist. \u201cYes, Stark, Property. My property.\u201d </p><p>Jack nodded at Stark\u2019s startled face. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t own another person, that\u2019s slavery.\u201d Stark said in outrage.</p><p>\u201cIt is and I certainly can.\u201d Loki said. \u201cThor! I tire of these mortal\u2019s company. It is time to return to our home.\u201d</p><p>Thor made his goodbyes to Captain America and his friend and walked over to Loki.</p><p>\u201cLook Reindeer Games, slavery is outlawed on earth. I don\u2019t care who you are, you can\u2019t own people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut new Asgard is not a part of Earth. It says specifically in our charter that we are a sovereign people and not under the laws of any nation. Only Asgard law applies in new Asgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in New Asgard now. Let him go.\u201d Stark said, and the weapons on his armor activated and pointed in Loki\u2019s direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! No!&rdquo; Jack said.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d \u00a0Loki said. He dropped Jack\u2019s wrist, turned to Thor and placed his hand on his brother\u2019s forearm. \u201cTake me home.\u201d </p><p>Thor smiled at Jack before raising his battleax.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d said Jack. \u201cWait!\u201d </p><p>The brothers disappeared in a burst of shimmering rainbow light. Jack stood open mouthed, looking at the burned spot were his owner had been only moments before.</p><p>\u201cHey Bat Boy, You\u2019re a free man now.\u201d Stark said with a cocky grin.</p><p>Jack rounded on him with a shout. \u201cYou fucking idiot!\u201d<br/></p>",

Jack chanted under his breath invoking the bindings carved into his skin and pale blue light glowed softly over his armor, covering him in a gossamer web.</p><p>He finished the spell and caught the last few words of the brothers\u2019 whispered conference.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust him.\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cTrust my judgement, brother.\u201d Loki answered. </p><p>Thor raised his battleax and with a thunderclap he was descending on the ranks of the invaders. \u00a0 Lightning forked and stabbed blowing the groups apart, some of the insectoids scattered, but more of them turned to attack the thunder god.

Jack swayed, the teleportation was disorienting, but this close the darkness was singing to him in a thousand leering voices. He took a step back from it.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Loki shook him.</p><p>\u201cLittle demon, watch my back while I unmake the rip between worlds.\u201d Loki said and released his grip.</p><p>Jack wanted to scream at Loki that he couldn\u2019t be here, that the other side was pounding its magic in his veins. That Corbin needed him and he shouldn\u2019t be here. That he wasn\u2019t any kind of a warrior. Instead he turned his back to Loki and the portal and braced his feet, the naginata in his hands. He could feel Loki\u2019s magic building in a whirlwind of power. The bug things bounded across the field, turning from Thor\u2019s distraction and racing to protect the doorway. Air cars circled and jetted toward them. The shaft of the weapon was slick from his sweating palms, and at the first strike it turned in his grip and he hit the bug with the side of the blade instead of the edge. It was knocked back into the second attacker. The delay as they disentangled allowed Jack to freeze off the sweat and take a firmer grip. </p><p>Then it was all movement and magic. The shield above them to protect form the blasts of the flying machines, the blade blurring as Jack slashed and stabbed, striking with wings and feet and once even his tail to pull an enemy off balance. And the whole time the terrible screaming in his head got louder and louder, no longer able to seduce him, it tormented him with threats of its vengeance.</p><p>Lightning was flickering around them, and once a giant green thing plowed through the field tossing insectoids as it charged past. There were explosions overhead and red and gold streaked across the sky. It was chaos and noise, the stench of burnt machine and flesh, the smell of blood and ichor and the reek of shit and piss from the dead. Horror overwhelmed Jack and he was screaming as he struck out. Too scared to run, he fought on driving the things back from where Loki cursed and wrestled the dark power that held the portal open. \u00a0He felt a tightening at his belly and then Loki was tapping into Jack\u2019s own magic, pulling power away from his bindings. \u00a0Jack cried out, without the bindings the dark part of his nature might get lose again. He didn\u2019t have time to fret because a second wave of attackers were on them and he lost himself in the deadly dance.</p><p>The screaming in his mind cut off like a switch had been flipped. Jack saw the last of the bugs destroyed by Thor\u2019s battleax before it could get close. \u00a0He took a ragged breath and looked about him. The remains of the invasion force was dead or dying. He was soaked in yellowish ichor and bright drops of blood spattered his armor. \u00a0An insectoid was on its back, its legs kicking in its death throws. \u00a0Loki sat on the ground behind him white faced and panting. Thor was hurrying toward them grinning, he paused to dispatch one of the wounded creatures. \u00a0Jack turned to Loki, took two paces \u00a0from the carnage and dropped to the ground on his hands and knees, the naginata fell beside him. He vomited, emptying his belly, with harsh gasps. \u00a0Loki looked at him with an expression devoid of anything but exhaustion. Jack crawled to Loki\u2019s side and curled up, hugging his knees, his head tucked down and his damaged wings folded to his back. He shivered when Loki\u2019s hand tangled in his matted hair.</p><p>There were more voices and the sound of sirens. Loki rose with Thor\u2019s help and he in turn dragged Jack to his feet. Jack wrapped himself in his wings and covered his face with his hands. Loki walked away and there were other people by him now. \u00a0Jack wanted to hide, but didn\u2019t have the strength to move so he stood were he was. He heard Loki arguing with a man he called Strange and Thor\u2019s gruff attempt at peacemaking. Then a metal hand touched his shoulder and a voice, softer now without the amplification said.</p><p>\u201cHey Bat Boy you alright in there?\u201d Stark asked, concerned.</p><p>Jack lifted his tear streaked face and shook his head at Stark.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d Jack said in a harsh whisper. \u201cThe bug people are dead and I killed them. I murdered them. \u00a0And other people are dead. Everybody\u2019s dead. I\u2019m a monster and I keep killing people. There\u2019s blood all over me.\u201d</p><p>He held out his shaking hands that were splattered with ichor and asked, his voice loud in a pause in the conversations. \u201cHow do you clean off the blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Said Stark, looking around, then \u201cLoki!\u201d </p><p>Jack covered his face again, sobbing. Loki looked over, took in the situation with an annoyed expression and turned back to Strange. Tony awkwardly patted Jack\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHey. It wasn\u2019t your fault, Count Chocula.\u201d Stark said. \u201cThey invaded us. They were the ones who started the attack. You helped stop them from killing more innocent people. Am I right?\u201d </p><p>Jack nodded, wiping his eyes with the palms of his hands and his nose on his gauntlet.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m right. Genius.\u201d Stark said. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Jack sniffled. </p><p>\u201cIts OK Bat Boy. You know Rock of Ages is a real asshole.\u201d Stark commented, steering Jack toward Loki.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s his nature.\u201d</p><p>Thor smiled, \u201cJack!\u201d he boomed, striding up to them. \u201cYou did well in battle today. You will be a fine warrior in time.\u201d He raised his hand to clap Jack on the shoulder but Jack dodged away with a growl. He mantled his wings, bared his teeth and unsheathed his claws.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me.\u201d Jack snarled. \u201cI\u2019m not a goddamn warrior, I\u2019m a painter.\u201d</p><p>Thor dropped his hand and scowled at Jack, then turned away without another word.</p><p>\u201cHarsh.\u201d Stark commented. \u201cA painter? House? Landscape? Body?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook himself, folded his wings and turned back to Stark. \u201cPortrait. Jack Linden. I used to have a website. About three, four years back, not sure because of the time differential. Ever heard of Sakaar?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s where Banner was.\u201d Stark said. \u201cYou were there too? What do you know about their tech? And the wormholes. Were you there long enough to study them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve managed to anger Thor again.\u201d Loki said coming up behind them. \u201cWhat little Jack knows about wormholes and alien technology would hardly hold your attention, Stark.\u201d</p><p>The man Loki addressed as Strange was with him. He eyed Jack with suspicion and the glow of a spitting, barely controlled magic gathered around his hands. Alarmed, Jack tried to gather his own power but he was drained from the fight. Loki turned to Strange.</p><p>\u201cIs there some reason you are about to attack my property, wizard?\u201d Loki asked.</p><p>\u201cStand down Dr.\u201d Stark said raising his hands and added to Loki. \u201cProperty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a demon, a creature of evil. It does not belong on this plane.\u201d Strange said.</p><p>\u201cNot this shit again.\u201d Jack said. \u201cSpecieist much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Loki said and punched the sorcerer in the chest, launching him thirty feet across the field. As he landed Loki added, \u201cThe next time you call me to deal with a problem of your own making, I will not answer.\u201d</p><p>Loki took Jack by the wrist. \u201cYes, Stark, Property. My property.\u201d </p><p>Jack nodded at Stark\u2019s startled face. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t own another person, that\u2019s slavery.\u201d Stark said in outrage.</p><p>\u201cIt is and I certainly can.\u201d Loki said. \u201cThor! I tire of these mortal\u2019s company. It is time to return to our home.\u201d</p><p>Thor made his goodbyes to Captain America and his friend and walked over to Loki.</p><p>\u201cLook Reindeer Games, slavery is outlawed on earth. I don\u2019t care who you are, you can\u2019t own people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut new Asgard is not a part of Earth. It says specifically in our charter that we are a sovereign people and not under the laws of any nation. Only Asgard law applies in new Asgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in New Asgard now. Let him go.\u201d Stark said, and the weapons on his armor activated and pointed in Loki\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cHey! No!\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d \u00a0Loki said. He dropped Jack\u2019s wrist, turned to Thor and placed his hand on his brother\u2019s forearm. \u201cTake me home.\u201d </p><p>Thor smiled at Jack before raising his battleax.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d said Jack. \u201cWait!\u201d </p><p>The brothers disappeared in a burst of shimmering rainbow light. Jack stood open mouthed, looking at the burned spot were his owner had been only moments before.</p><p>\u201cHey Bat Boy, You\u2019re a free man now.\u201d Stark said with a cocky grin.</p><p>Jack rounded on him with a shout. \u201cYou fucking idiot!\u201d<br></p>",
