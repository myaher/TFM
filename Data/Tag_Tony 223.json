It lasted for only a second before War Machine broke through the ceiling\nand quickly dispatched the bad guys.</p><p>Peter had the fight in play-by-plays\nin his head. The entrance (kicking down the door), the fight (long and bloody)\nand the moment before the sonic burst, where the bad guys argued, one of them\nyelled that they didn\u2019t know what the device did yet, and another said <i>screw it, do it anyway</i>.</p><p>Then it went off.</p><p>And Peter\u2019s ears were still\nringing after the police had surrounded the warehouse and Tony was helping\nSpiderman walk out of the building. The Channel 6 news was just pulling up to\ncall for a statement when Peter groaned, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou alright there, kid?\u201d\nTony asked, the helmet having receded into the rest of the armour.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter muttered, then\nfrowned. Had he meant to say that? \u201cMy ears still hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the doc to meet us\nat the tower,\u201d Tony replied, glancing back to see Rhodey in the War Machine get\nup talking to the head police officer on site. Then he looked back to the news\ncrew approaching. \u201cOh crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine Everhart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Peter\nasked.</p><p>\u201cWe fucked once.\u201d Peter\nlooked up at him suddenly, a confused expression on Tony\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\nto say that out loud.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Katherine Everhart appeared\nin Peter\u2019s peripheral, the camera rushing along behind her. \u201cMr Stark,\u201d she\nannounced, \u201cSpiderman. Christine Everhart, can you give us a statement about\nwhat happened here today?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked to Tony, still\nin his mentor\u2019s grip. \u201cYou got her name wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I got her name\nwrong,\u201d Tony replied, quiet, despite Christine\u2019s raised eyebrow. \u201cThere were\nbad guys, we took them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of bad guys,\u201d Peter\nagreed.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what\norganisation they worked for?\u201d Christine asked, following along as Tony and Peter\nlimped to the edge of the property.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tony said. \u201cIt\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassified,\u201d Rhodey\ninterrupted suddenly, appearing by Tony\u2019s side. \u201cNice to see you again, Miss\nEverhart. We\u2019ve gotta go. You okay to fly, Spidey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Peter asked, looking to\nRhodey. \u201cI\u2019m okay to fly though I might throw up over Brooklyn if I do.\u201d There\nwas a beat, then Peter added: \u201cBut I\u2019m wearing my mask so I\u2019ll probably just\nthrow up in my own face.\u201d</p><p>Rhodey and Tony both blinked\nat him and Christine seemed lost for words.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Rhodey\nannounced, and as soon as Tony agreed, Peter was gripped tightly by the Iron\nMan armour and they shot off across New York.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t vomit during the\ntrip, but it wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cStill in pain?\u201d Tony asked\nwhen they reached the medbay.</p><p>Peter yanked off his mask to\nsit on the bed as Tony pulled an MIT sweatshirt on. Peter shook his head. \u201cMy\nears don\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d the doctor\nsaid with a nod, before starting the check up.</p><p>Peter squinted at Tony\u2019s\nsweatshirt. \u201cI like it,\u201d he said when Tony raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI stole it from Rhodey,\u201d\nTony replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know where my one is.\u201d</p><p>The doctor checked Peter\u2019s\nears and gave him a full body scan, before frowning at an area of his brain lighting\nup on FRIDAY\u2019s systems.</p><p>\u201cHave you taken any drugs\nrecently?\u201d the doctor asked without looking at him.</p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cNot\nrecently.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised a pointed\neyebrow. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ve taken drugs <i>not</i>\nrecently?\u201d</p><p>Peter blinked. He knew the\nright answer was to say no, but- \u201cHow recently is not recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark.\u201d</p><p>The doctor clicked at the\nkeyboard in the background as the two of them stared off.</p><p>\u201cPeter, have you taken\nrecreational drugs before?\u201d</p><p><i>No.\nOf course not. Never in my life. </i>\u201cYes.\u201d\n<i>Jesus Christ, Peter.</i> \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\nto say that.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared at him and Peter\nwasn\u2019t sure if he could work out the rage from the confusion. When he spoke, he\ndid so incredibly slowly. \u201cPeter Benjamin Parker. What recreational drugs have\nyou taken?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t want to\nmove. He didn\u2019t want it to. He would do anything to just not open it and say: \u201cI\nsmoked weed a few times and then I went to a party and I think I tried E-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>PETER-</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201c-But my metabolism meant I\ncouldn\u2019t really feel the effect of it so it was like I didn\u2019t take it at all.\u201d</p><p>The room was entirely silent.\nEven the doctor was staring at Peter. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say that,\neither.\u201d</p><p>Just as Tony opened his mouth\nto no doubt ban Peter from drugs, drinking, Spiderman and <i>possibly</i> TV for the rest of his life, the doctor interrupted. \u201cWhat\ndo you mean, you didn\u2019t mean to say that? What did you mean to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to lie,\u201d Peter\nreplied with zero hesitation.</p><p>\u201cHas this been going on for\nlong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust since I got here,\nreally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anything happen on the\nmission to affect you in this way?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause before Peter\nlooked over to Tony. \u201cThat sound,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a noise \u2013 it took me\ndown. Mr Stark got hit with it, too.\u201d</p><p>The doctor nodded slowly. \u201cAnd\nnow you keep speaking without meaning to. You keep telling the truth when you\ndon\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The doctor turned to Tony and\ntilted his head. \u201cMr Stark, I\u2019ve been told you\u2019re fourteen months sober. Is\nthat true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony replied, his eyes\ngrowing wide at how his mouth moved so fast. \u201cI\u2019m like three and a half weeks\nsober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark!\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at Peter with his\njaw clenched. Still, he said, \u201cBeing sober is really difficult. I went about\nfour months without a drink and that\u2019s my record.\u201d</p><p>The room was silent, the\nthree looking between each other as it dawned on them what was going on.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the doctor said,\nmoving back to his keyboard. \u201cIt seems you two can only tell the truth. I\u2019ll\ncall the team in to start working on a fix, but I do recommend you don\u2019t leave\nthe tower in case you say something you usually wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Peter said.</p><p>The doctor raised an eyebrow\nbut didn\u2019t look away from the screen. \u201cPeter, are you Spiderman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Peter blinked. \u201cI see\nyour point.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Tony and Peter sat across\nfrom each other at the kitchen table. A few floors down, the doctors were\nworking on the fix, while Rhodey had been sent away and Vision \u2013 well, Vision\nwas never there anyway. Tony had given his phone to the doctor and gotten him\nto text May that Peter was staying the night \u2013 he really didn\u2019t need Peter\nblabbing to May when she was the one person who had higher authority than Tony\nabout whether Spiderman was allowed to come and play or not.</p><p>So they stared at each other,\nneither wanting to speak in case they said something they shouldn\u2019t \u2013 but Peter\nshould\u2019ve recognised the look on Tony\u2019s face, that he had a plan brewing.</p><p>\u201cSo, kid,\u201d Tony started.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d Peter\ninterrupted. \u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Peter glared. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a crush on anyone?\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to hum to keep\nhis voice at bay, but he still said, \u201cThere\u2019s this guy in my Lit class.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows and\nshrugged. \u201cIs he cute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and I\u2019m not doing this,\nMr Stark. We should spend the rest of the day apart until the doctors can fix\nthis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they can\u2019t?\u201d Tony\nasked, though his voice was toying. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re stuck telling the truth\nforever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you and Pepper are\ngoing to have to start going to marriage counselling,\u201d Peter replied.</p><p>\u201cWe already go to marriage\ncounselling and we\u2019re not even married yet.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged to look as if\nhe was indifferent about it, but he averted his gaze all the same. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fly around all day in a\ntin can. I worry her a lot. It\u2019s healthy, apparently, to go to therapy for\nthat.\u201d </p><p>Peter hesitated, then, \u201cYou\u2019re\nreally not fourteen months sober?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to worry you.\nPepper and Rhodey don\u2019t know, either, though I should probably tell them.\u201d There\nwas a long silence, in which the clock in the kitchen ticked every second and Peter\nwished they were closer to the ground so he could at least focus on the street\nnoises. Peter understood when Tony changed the subject. \u201cYou never told me you\nwere interested in boys.\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged, but he found\nhimself staring at the table. \u201cYou never asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how this works,\u201d Peter\nreplied. \u201cI was planning to tell you eventually, but it\u2019s not a big thing, you\nknow? It\u2019s just\u2026 part of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. It\u2019s part of\nme, too.\u201d</p><p>Peter raised his eyes to see\nTony\u2019s face, but he didn\u2019t need to really. Tony could only tell the truth.</p><p>\u201cThe press likes to forget\nthat time I dated like four male models at once.\u201d</p><p>Peter cracked a smile. So did\nTony.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about\nthe drugs?\u201d Tony asked, immediately making Peter frown.</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you to\nbe disappointed in me. Why did you ask me that? I thought we were having a\nmoment.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, then tipped his\nhead back with a huff. \u201cYou wanna watch a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything to stop talking.\u201d</p><p>They watched the first movie\nthat came up on Netflix \u2013 which happened to be some sappy rom com. Neither of\nthem paid much attention, hyper aware of the other and this curse they\u2019d been afflicted\nwith.</p><p>At some point during the\nfilm, Peter had started leaning against Tony\u2019s side, and Tony had swung an arm\naround his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep much last\nnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor like an hour,\u201d Peter\nreplied.</p><p>On screen, the main couple\nwere arguing. In about twenty minutes they\u2019d get back together again, so this\nreally meant nothing to Peter.</p><p>\u201cThe drugs really didn\u2019t affect\nyou?\u201d Tony asked, making Peter roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI got a\nlittle happy for like a minute and then it was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you take them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to have fun. Would\nyou mind waiting to ask these questions until I\u2019m capable of lying?\u201d</p><p>Tony snorted. \u201cI\u2019d mind.\u201d\nStill he quietened until the main couple were finally kissing and making up and\nready to walk off into the sunset together. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna be\ndisappointed in you for that sort of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical, I guess,\nconsidering everything I\u2019ve done and the lying about sobriety. But, Peter \u2013 I\u2019ll\nbe disappointed if you think you can\u2019t come to me about it. If you think you\nhave to lie to me.\u201d On screen, the main couple started singing. Up to this\npoint, the movie hadn\u2019t been a musical. \u201cI want you to be able to talk to me.\nTo trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like my dad, of\ncourse I do.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened and he\nstared steadfastly at the screen and pointedly not at Tony. <i>You\u2019re like my dad? Peter, stop talking.</i></p><p>\u201cWould you, uh, would you\nmind repeating yourself there, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter. Do you consider me a\nfather-figure in your life?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned to glare at Tony,\nwho seemed particularly amused with the situation. \u201cYes,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>Tony smiled and Peter\nshuffled until he was facing the screen again. There was a pre-choreographed\nmusic number with a large ensemble. Peter wasn\u2019t sure they were watching the\nsame movie as five minutes ago. He felt Tony pull him in close, his chin\nresting in Peter\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s voice was quiet. \u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Pete. Good.\u201d</p><p>He knew he\u2019d regret asking if\nhe didn\u2019t like the response, but Peter Parker had never had a filter even\nbefore he could only tell the truth. \u201cMr Stark, do you consider me a\nson-figure?\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t hesitate, and all\nthe warmth he could muster went into the words. \u201cYeah, Peter. I do.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>When Peter got up the next\nday, the first thing Tony asked when he walked into the kitchen was, \u201cHey,\nkiddo. What\u2019s your crush\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2019s confidential,\u201d\nPeter replied.</p><p>Tony grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019m\ngonna find it out anyway, but it\u2019s nice to know the truth thing wore off.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, no\nway! I\u2019ve never taken drugs before in my life! May\u2019s cooking is great! The US\nmilitary budget is not big enough! Mr Stark! I can lie again!\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed. \u201cSure can, kid.\nYou want pancakes or waffles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaffles,\u201d Peter said, then\nwhen Tony moved, \u201cThat was a lie! I want pancakes! Mr Stark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like that\u2019s not gonna\nget old real quick,\u201d Tony muttered, moving to make the pancakes. Peter landed\non the stool at the kitchen island.</p><p>\u201cThis is great,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI\u2019m\ngonna lie so much. I\u2019m gonna evade every question. I never realised how much I\ntook it for granted.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes. \u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth thing lasted less\nthan 24 hours, it\u2019s not like we spent a year with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but I\u2019m not gonna let\nmy lying ability go to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible at lying,\nthough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m so happy to\nfinally be able to <i>practice</i> again!\u201d</p><p>Overhead, music filtered into\nthe kitchen, Tony cooking at the stove and morning sunlight streaming through\nthe windows. Peter rambled off every lie he could think of, while Tony rolled\nhis eyes, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI like Flash as a person. I\u2019ve\nkilled a man in cold blood. I\u2019ve gone to the moon. I didn\u2019t totally have a\ncrush on Black Widow at age eleven. I\u2019ve never been arrested-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 uh-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Peter.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 uh. Oh shit.\u201d</p>",

Christine Everhart, can you give us a statement about\nwhat happened here today?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked to Tony, still\nin his mentor\u2019s grip. \u201cYou got her name wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I got her name\nwrong,\u201d Tony replied, quiet, despite Christine\u2019s raised eyebrow. \u201cThere were\nbad guys, we took them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of bad guys,\u201d Peter\nagreed.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what\norganisation they worked for?\u201d Christine asked, following along as Tony and Peter\nlimped to the edge of the property.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tony said. \u201cIt\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassified,\u201d Rhodey\ninterrupted suddenly, appearing by Tony\u2019s side. \u201cNice to see you again, Miss\nEverhart. We\u2019ve gotta go. You okay to fly, Spidey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Peter asked, looking to\nRhodey. \u201cI\u2019m okay to fly though I might throw up over Brooklyn if I do.\u201d There\nwas a beat, then Peter added: \u201cBut I\u2019m wearing my mask so I\u2019ll probably just\nthrow up in my own face.\u201d</p><p>Rhodey and Tony both blinked\nat him and Christine seemed lost for words.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Rhodey\nannounced, and as soon as Tony agreed, Peter was gripped tightly by the Iron\nMan armour and they shot off across New York.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t vomit during the\ntrip, but it wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cStill in pain?\u201d Tony asked\nwhen they reached the medbay.</p><p>Peter yanked off his mask to\nsit on the bed as Tony pulled an MIT sweatshirt on. Peter shook his head. \u201cMy\nears don\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d the doctor\nsaid with a nod, before starting the check up.</p><p>Peter squinted at Tony\u2019s\nsweatshirt. \u201cI like it,\u201d he said when Tony raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI stole it from Rhodey,\u201d\nTony replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know where my one is.\u201d</p><p>The doctor checked Peter\u2019s\nears and gave him a full body scan, before frowning at an area of his brain lighting\nup on FRIDAY\u2019s systems.</p><p>\u201cHave you taken any drugs\nrecently?\u201d the doctor asked without looking at him.</p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cNot\nrecently.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised a pointed\neyebrow. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ve taken drugs <i>not</i>\nrecently?\u201d</p><p>Peter blinked. He knew the\nright answer was to say no, but- \u201cHow recently is not recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark.\u201d</p><p>The doctor clicked at the\nkeyboard in the background as the two of them stared off.</p><p>\u201cPeter, have you taken\nrecreational drugs before?\u201d</p><p><i>No.\nOf course not. Never in my life. </i>\u201cYes.\u201d\n<i>Jesus Christ, Peter.</i> \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\nto say that.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared at him and Peter\nwasn\u2019t sure if he could work out the rage from the confusion. When he spoke, he\ndid so incredibly slowly. \u201cPeter Benjamin Parker. What recreational drugs have\nyou taken?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t want to\nmove. He didn\u2019t want it to. He would do anything to just not open it and say: \u201cI\nsmoked weed a few times and then I went to a party and I think I tried E-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>PETER-</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201c-But my metabolism meant I\ncouldn\u2019t really feel the effect of it so it was like I didn\u2019t take it at all.\u201d</p><p>The room was entirely silent.\nEven the doctor was staring at Peter. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say that,\neither.\u201d</p><p>Just as Tony opened his mouth\nto no doubt ban Peter from drugs, drinking, Spiderman and <i>possibly</i> TV for the rest of his life, the doctor interrupted. \u201cWhat\ndo you mean, you didn\u2019t mean to say that? What did you mean to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to lie,\u201d Peter\nreplied with zero hesitation.</p><p>\u201cHas this been going on for\nlong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust since I got here,\nreally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anything happen on the\nmission to affect you in this way?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause before Peter\nlooked over to Tony. \u201cThat sound,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a noise \u2013 it took me\ndown. Mr Stark got hit with it, too.\u201d</p><p>The doctor nodded slowly. \u201cAnd\nnow you keep speaking without meaning to. You keep telling the truth when you\ndon\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The doctor turned to Tony and\ntilted his head. \u201cMr Stark, I\u2019ve been told you\u2019re fourteen months sober. Is\nthat true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony replied, his eyes\ngrowing wide at how his mouth moved so fast. \u201cI\u2019m like three and a half weeks\nsober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark!\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at Peter with his\njaw clenched. Still, he said, \u201cBeing sober is really difficult. I went about\nfour months without a drink and that\u2019s my record.\u201d</p><p>The room was silent, the\nthree looking between each other as it dawned on them what was going on.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the doctor said,\nmoving back to his keyboard. \u201cIt seems you two can only tell the truth. I\u2019ll\ncall the team in to start working on a fix, but I do recommend you don\u2019t leave\nthe tower in case you say something you usually wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Peter said.</p><p>The doctor raised an eyebrow\nbut didn\u2019t look away from the screen. \u201cPeter, are you Spiderman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Peter blinked. \u201cI see\nyour point.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Tony and Peter sat across\nfrom each other at the kitchen table. A few floors down, the doctors were\nworking on the fix, while Rhodey had been sent away and Vision \u2013 well, Vision\nwas never there anyway. Tony had given his phone to the doctor and gotten him\nto text May that Peter was staying the night \u2013 he really didn\u2019t need Peter\nblabbing to May when she was the one person who had higher authority than Tony\nabout whether Spiderman was allowed to come and play or not.</p><p>So they stared at each other,\nneither wanting to speak in case they said something they shouldn\u2019t \u2013 but Peter\nshould\u2019ve recognised the look on Tony\u2019s face, that he had a plan brewing.</p><p>\u201cSo, kid,\u201d Tony started.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d Peter\ninterrupted. \u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Peter glared. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a crush on anyone?\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to hum to keep\nhis voice at bay, but he still said, \u201cThere\u2019s this guy in my Lit class.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows and\nshrugged. \u201cIs he cute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and I\u2019m not doing this,\nMr Stark. We should spend the rest of the day apart until the doctors can fix\nthis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they can\u2019t?\u201d Tony\nasked, though his voice was toying. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re stuck telling the truth\nforever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you and Pepper are\ngoing to have to start going to marriage counselling,\u201d Peter replied.</p><p>\u201cWe already go to marriage\ncounselling and we\u2019re not even married yet.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged to look as if\nhe was indifferent about it, but he averted his gaze all the same. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fly around all day in a\ntin can. I worry her a lot. It\u2019s healthy, apparently, to go to therapy for\nthat.\u201d </p><p>Peter hesitated, then, \u201cYou\u2019re\nreally not fourteen months sober?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to worry you.\nPepper and Rhodey don\u2019t know, either, though I should probably tell them.\u201d There\nwas a long silence, in which the clock in the kitchen ticked every second and Peter\nwished they were closer to the ground so he could at least focus on the street\nnoises. Peter understood when Tony changed the subject. \u201cYou never told me you\nwere interested in boys.\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged, but he found\nhimself staring at the table. \u201cYou never asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how this works,\u201d Peter\nreplied. \u201cI was planning to tell you eventually, but it\u2019s not a big thing, you\nknow? It\u2019s just\u2026 part of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. It\u2019s part of\nme, too.\u201d</p><p>Peter raised his eyes to see\nTony\u2019s face, but he didn\u2019t need to really. Tony could only tell the truth.</p><p>\u201cThe press likes to forget\nthat time I dated like four male models at once.\u201d</p><p>Peter cracked a smile. So did\nTony.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about\nthe drugs?\u201d Tony asked, immediately making Peter frown.</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you to\nbe disappointed in me. Why did you ask me that? I thought we were having a\nmoment.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, then tipped his\nhead back with a huff. \u201cYou wanna watch a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything to stop talking.\u201d</p><p>They watched the first movie\nthat came up on Netflix \u2013 which happened to be some sappy rom com. Neither of\nthem paid much attention, hyper aware of the other and this curse they\u2019d been afflicted\nwith.</p><p>At some point during the\nfilm, Peter had started leaning against Tony\u2019s side, and Tony had swung an arm\naround his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep much last\nnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor like an hour,\u201d Peter\nreplied.</p><p>On screen, the main couple\nwere arguing. In about twenty minutes they\u2019d get back together again, so this\nreally meant nothing to Peter.</p><p>\u201cThe drugs really didn\u2019t affect\nyou?\u201d Tony asked, making Peter roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI got a\nlittle happy for like a minute and then it was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you take them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to have fun. Would\nyou mind waiting to ask these questions until I\u2019m capable of lying?\u201d</p><p>Tony snorted. \u201cI\u2019d mind.\u201d\nStill he quietened until the main couple were finally kissing and making up and\nready to walk off into the sunset together. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna be\ndisappointed in you for that sort of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical, I guess,\nconsidering everything I\u2019ve done and the lying about sobriety. But, Peter \u2013 I\u2019ll\nbe disappointed if you think you can\u2019t come to me about it. If you think you\nhave to lie to me.\u201d On screen, the main couple started singing. Up to this\npoint, the movie hadn\u2019t been a musical. \u201cI want you to be able to talk to me.\nTo trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like my dad, of\ncourse I do.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened and he\nstared steadfastly at the screen and pointedly not at Tony. <i>You\u2019re like my dad? Peter, stop talking.</i></p><p>\u201cWould you, uh, would you\nmind repeating yourself there, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter. Do you consider me a\nfather-figure in your life?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned to glare at Tony,\nwho seemed particularly amused with the situation. \u201cYes,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>Tony smiled and Peter\nshuffled until he was facing the screen again. There was a pre-choreographed\nmusic number with a large ensemble. Peter wasn\u2019t sure they were watching the\nsame movie as five minutes ago. He felt Tony pull him in close, his chin\nresting in Peter\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s voice was quiet. \u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Pete. Good.\u201d</p><p>He knew he\u2019d regret asking if\nhe didn\u2019t like the response, but Peter Parker had never had a filter even\nbefore he could only tell the truth. \u201cMr Stark, do you consider me a\nson-figure?\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t hesitate, and all\nthe warmth he could muster went into the words. \u201cYeah, Peter. I do.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>When Peter got up the next\nday, the first thing Tony asked when he walked into the kitchen was, \u201cHey,\nkiddo. What\u2019s your crush\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2019s confidential,\u201d\nPeter replied.</p><p>Tony grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019m\ngonna find it out anyway, but it\u2019s nice to know the truth thing wore off.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, no\nway! I\u2019ve never taken drugs before in my life! May\u2019s cooking is great! The US\nmilitary budget is not big enough! Mr Stark! I can lie again!\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed. \u201cSure can, kid.\nYou want pancakes or waffles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaffles,\u201d Peter said, then\nwhen Tony moved, \u201cThat was a lie! I want pancakes! Mr Stark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like that\u2019s not gonna\nget old real quick,\u201d Tony muttered, moving to make the pancakes. Peter landed\non the stool at the kitchen island.</p><p>\u201cThis is great,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI\u2019m\ngonna lie so much. I\u2019m gonna evade every question. I never realised how much I\ntook it for granted.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes. \u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth thing lasted less\nthan 24 hours, it\u2019s not like we spent a year with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but I\u2019m not gonna let\nmy lying ability go to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible at lying,\nthough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m so happy to\nfinally be able to <i>practice</i> again!\u201d</p><p>Overhead, music filtered into\nthe kitchen, Tony cooking at the stove and morning sunlight streaming through\nthe windows. Peter rambled off every lie he could think of, while Tony rolled\nhis eyes, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI like Flash as a person. I\u2019ve\nkilled a man in cold blood. I\u2019ve gone to the moon. I didn\u2019t totally have a\ncrush on Black Widow at age eleven. I\u2019ve never been arrested-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 uh-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Peter.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 uh. Oh shit.\u201d</p>",

It lasted for only a second before War Machine broke through the ceiling\nand quickly dispatched the bad guys.</p><p>Peter had the fight in play-by-plays\nin his head. The entrance (kicking down the door), the fight (long and bloody)\nand the moment before the sonic burst, where the bad guys argued, one of them\nyelled that they didn\u2019t know what the device did yet, and another said <i>screw it, do it anyway</i>.</p><p>Then it went off.</p><p>And Peter\u2019s ears were still\nringing after the police had surrounded the warehouse and Tony was helping\nSpiderman walk out of the building. The Channel 6 news was just pulling up to\ncall for a statement when Peter groaned, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou alright there, kid?\u201d\nTony asked, the helmet having receded into the rest of the armour.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter muttered, then\nfrowned. Had he meant to say that? \u201cMy ears still hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the doc to meet us\nat the tower,\u201d Tony replied, glancing back to see Rhodey in the War Machine get\nup talking to the head police officer on site. Then he looked back to the news\ncrew approaching. \u201cOh crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine Everhart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Peter\nasked.</p><p>\u201cWe fucked once.\u201d Peter\nlooked up at him suddenly, a confused expression on Tony\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\nto say that out loud.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Katherine Everhart appeared\nin Peter\u2019s peripheral, the camera rushing along behind her. \u201cMr Stark,\u201d she\nannounced, \u201cSpiderman. Christine Everhart, can you give us a statement about\nwhat happened here today?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked to Tony, still\nin his mentor\u2019s grip. \u201cYou got her name wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I got her name\nwrong,\u201d Tony replied, quiet, despite Christine\u2019s raised eyebrow. \u201cThere were\nbad guys, we took them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of bad guys,\u201d Peter\nagreed.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what\norganisation they worked for?\u201d Christine asked, following along as Tony and Peter\nlimped to the edge of the property.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tony said. \u201cIt\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassified,\u201d Rhodey\ninterrupted suddenly, appearing by Tony\u2019s side. \u201cNice to see you again, Miss\nEverhart. We\u2019ve gotta go. You okay to fly, Spidey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Peter asked, looking to\nRhodey. \u201cI\u2019m okay to fly though I might throw up over Brooklyn if I do.\u201d There\nwas a beat, then Peter added: \u201cBut I\u2019m wearing my mask so I\u2019ll probably just\nthrow up in my own face.\u201d</p><p>Rhodey and Tony both blinked\nat him and Christine seemed lost for words.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Rhodey\nannounced, and as soon as Tony agreed, Peter was gripped tightly by the Iron\nMan armour and they shot off across New York.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t vomit during the\ntrip, but it wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cStill in pain?\u201d Tony asked\nwhen they reached the medbay.</p><p>Peter yanked off his mask to\nsit on the bed as Tony pulled an MIT sweatshirt on. Peter shook his head. \u201cMy\nears don\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d the doctor\nsaid with a nod, before starting the check up.</p><p>Peter squinted at Tony\u2019s\nsweatshirt. \u201cI like it,\u201d he said when Tony raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI stole it from Rhodey,\u201d\nTony replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know where my one is.\u201d</p><p>The doctor checked Peter\u2019s\nears and gave him a full body scan, before frowning at an area of his brain lighting\nup on FRIDAY\u2019s systems.</p><p>\u201cHave you taken any drugs\nrecently?\u201d the doctor asked without looking at him.</p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cNot\nrecently.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised a pointed\neyebrow. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ve taken drugs <i>not</i>\nrecently?\u201d</p><p>Peter blinked. He knew the\nright answer was to say no, but- \u201cHow recently is not recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark.\u201d</p><p>The doctor clicked at the\nkeyboard in the background as the two of them stared off.</p><p>\u201cPeter, have you taken\nrecreational drugs before?\u201d</p><p><i>No.\nOf course not. Never in my life. </i>\u201cYes.\u201d\n<i>Jesus Christ, Peter.</i> \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\nto say that.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared at him and Peter\nwasn\u2019t sure if he could work out the rage from the confusion. When he spoke, he\ndid so incredibly slowly. \u201cPeter Benjamin Parker. What recreational drugs have\nyou taken?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t want to\nmove. He didn\u2019t want it to. He would do anything to just not open it and say: \u201cI\nsmoked weed a few times and then I went to a party and I think I tried E-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>PETER-</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201c-But my metabolism meant I\ncouldn\u2019t really feel the effect of it so it was like I didn\u2019t take it at all.\u201d</p><p>The room was entirely silent.\nEven the doctor was staring at Peter. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say that,\neither.\u201d</p><p>Just as Tony opened his mouth\nto no doubt ban Peter from drugs, drinking, Spiderman and <i>possibly</i> TV for the rest of his life, the doctor interrupted. \u201cWhat\ndo you mean, you didn\u2019t mean to say that? What did you mean to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to lie,\u201d Peter\nreplied with zero hesitation.</p><p>\u201cHas this been going on for\nlong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust since I got here,\nreally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anything happen on the\nmission to affect you in this way?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause before Peter\nlooked over to Tony. \u201cThat sound,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a noise \u2013 it took me\ndown. Mr Stark got hit with it, too.\u201d</p><p>The doctor nodded slowly. \u201cAnd\nnow you keep speaking without meaning to. You keep telling the truth when you\ndon\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The doctor turned to Tony and\ntilted his head. \u201cMr Stark, I\u2019ve been told you\u2019re fourteen months sober. Is\nthat true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony replied, his eyes\ngrowing wide at how his mouth moved so fast. \u201cI\u2019m like three and a half weeks\nsober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark!\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at Peter with his\njaw clenched. Still, he said, \u201cBeing sober is really difficult. I went about\nfour months without a drink and that\u2019s my record.\u201d</p><p>The room was silent, the\nthree looking between each other as it dawned on them what was going on.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the doctor said,\nmoving back to his keyboard. \u201cIt seems you two can only tell the truth. I\u2019ll\ncall the team in to start working on a fix, but I do recommend you don\u2019t leave\nthe tower in case you say something you usually wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Peter said.</p><p>The doctor raised an eyebrow\nbut didn\u2019t look away from the screen. \u201cPeter, are you Spiderman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Peter blinked. \u201cI see\nyour point.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Tony and Peter sat across\nfrom each other at the kitchen table. A few floors down, the doctors were\nworking on the fix, while Rhodey had been sent away and Vision \u2013 well, Vision\nwas never there anyway. Tony had given his phone to the doctor and gotten him\nto text May that Peter was staying the night \u2013 he really didn\u2019t need Peter\nblabbing to May when she was the one person who had higher authority than Tony\nabout whether Spiderman was allowed to come and play or not.</p><p>So they stared at each other,\nneither wanting to speak in case they said something they shouldn\u2019t \u2013 but Peter\nshould\u2019ve recognised the look on Tony\u2019s face, that he had a plan brewing.</p><p>\u201cSo, kid,\u201d Tony started.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d Peter\ninterrupted. \u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Peter glared. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a crush on anyone?\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to hum to keep\nhis voice at bay, but he still said, \u201cThere\u2019s this guy in my Lit class.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows and\nshrugged. \u201cIs he cute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and I\u2019m not doing this,\nMr Stark. We should spend the rest of the day apart until the doctors can fix\nthis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they can\u2019t?\u201d Tony\nasked, though his voice was toying. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re stuck telling the truth\nforever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you and Pepper are\ngoing to have to start going to marriage counselling,\u201d Peter replied.</p><p>\u201cWe already go to marriage\ncounselling and we\u2019re not even married yet.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged to look as if\nhe was indifferent about it, but he averted his gaze all the same. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fly around all day in a\ntin can. I worry her a lot. It\u2019s healthy, apparently, to go to therapy for\nthat.\u201d </p><p>Peter hesitated, then, \u201cYou\u2019re\nreally not fourteen months sober?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to worry you.\nPepper and Rhodey don\u2019t know, either, though I should probably tell them.\u201d There\nwas a long silence, in which the clock in the kitchen ticked every second and Peter\nwished they were closer to the ground so he could at least focus on the street\nnoises. Peter understood when Tony changed the subject. \u201cYou never told me you\nwere interested in boys.\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged, but he found\nhimself staring at the table. \u201cYou never asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how this works,\u201d Peter\nreplied. \u201cI was planning to tell you eventually, but it\u2019s not a big thing, you\nknow? It\u2019s just\u2026 part of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. It\u2019s part of\nme, too.\u201d</p><p>Peter raised his eyes to see\nTony\u2019s face, but he didn\u2019t need to really. Tony could only tell the truth.</p><p>\u201cThe press likes to forget\nthat time I dated like four male models at once.\u201d</p><p>Peter cracked a smile. So did\nTony.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about\nthe drugs?\u201d Tony asked, immediately making Peter frown.</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you to\nbe disappointed in me. Why did you ask me that? I thought we were having a\nmoment.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, then tipped his\nhead back with a huff. \u201cYou wanna watch a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything to stop talking.\u201d</p><p>They watched the first movie\nthat came up on Netflix \u2013 which happened to be some sappy rom com.

We&rsquo;ve gotta go. You okay to fly, Spidey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Peter asked, looking to\nRhodey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay to fly though I might throw up over Brooklyn if I do.&rdquo; There\nwas a beat, then Peter added: &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m wearing my mask so I&rsquo;ll probably just\nthrow up in my own face.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodey and Tony both blinked\nat him and Christine seemed lost for words.</p><p>&ldquo;We should get going,&rdquo; Rhodey\nannounced, and as soon as Tony agreed, Peter was gripped tightly by the Iron\nMan armour and they shot off across New York.</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t vomit during the\ntrip, but it wasn&rsquo;t for a lack of trying.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Still in pain?&rdquo; Tony asked\nwhen they reached the medbay.</p><p>Peter yanked off his mask to\nsit on the bed as Tony pulled an MIT sweatshirt on. Peter shook his head. &ldquo;My\nears don&rsquo;t hurt anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; the doctor\nsaid with a nod, before starting the check up.</p><p>Peter squinted at Tony&rsquo;s\nsweatshirt. &ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; he said when Tony raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;I stole it from Rhodey,&rdquo;\nTony replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where my one is.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor checked Peter&rsquo;s\nears and gave him a full body scan, before frowning at an area of his brain lighting\nup on FRIDAY&rsquo;s systems.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you taken any drugs\nrecently?&rdquo; the doctor asked without looking at him.</p><p>Peter shrugged. &ldquo;Not\nrecently.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony raised a pointed\neyebrow. &ldquo;Does that mean you&rsquo;ve taken drugs <i>not</i>\nrecently?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter blinked. He knew the\nright answer was to say no, but- &ldquo;How recently is not recently?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor clicked at the\nkeyboard in the background as the two of them stared off.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, have you taken\nrecreational drugs before?&rdquo;</p><p><i>No.\nOf course not. Never in my life. </i>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;\n<i>Jesus Christ, Peter.</i> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean\nto say that.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stared at him and Peter\nwasn&rsquo;t sure if he could work out the rage from the confusion. When he spoke, he\ndid so incredibly slowly. &ldquo;Peter Benjamin Parker. What recreational drugs have\nyou taken?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s mouth didn&rsquo;t want to\nmove. He didn&rsquo;t want it to. He would do anything to just not open it and say: &ldquo;I\nsmoked weed a few times and then I went to a party and I think I tried E-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>PETER-</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-But my metabolism meant I\ncouldn&rsquo;t really feel the effect of it so it was like I didn&rsquo;t take it at all.&rdquo;</p><p>The room was entirely silent.\nEven the doctor was staring at Peter. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that,\neither.&rdquo;</p><p>Just as Tony opened his mouth\nto no doubt ban Peter from drugs, drinking, Spiderman and <i>possibly</i> TV for the rest of his life, the doctor interrupted. &ldquo;What\ndo you mean, you didn&rsquo;t mean to say that? What did you mean to say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I meant to lie,&rdquo; Peter\nreplied with zero hesitation.</p><p>&ldquo;Has this been going on for\nlong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just since I got here,\nreally.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did anything happen on the\nmission to affect you in this way?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a pause before Peter\nlooked over to Tony. &ldquo;That sound,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was a noise &ndash; it took me\ndown. Mr Stark got hit with it, too.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor nodded slowly. &ldquo;And\nnow you keep speaking without meaning to. You keep telling the truth when you\ndon&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor turned to Tony and\ntilted his head. &ldquo;Mr Stark, I&rsquo;ve been told you&rsquo;re fourteen months sober. Is\nthat true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tony replied, his eyes\ngrowing wide at how his mouth moved so fast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like three and a half weeks\nsober.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked at Peter with his\njaw clenched. Still, he said, &ldquo;Being sober is really difficult. I went about\nfour months without a drink and that&rsquo;s my record.&rdquo;</p><p>The room was silent, the\nthree looking between each other as it dawned on them what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the doctor said,\nmoving back to his keyboard. &ldquo;It seems you two can only tell the truth. I&rsquo;ll\ncall the team in to start working on a fix, but I do recommend you don&rsquo;t leave\nthe tower in case you say something you usually wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Peter said.</p><p>The doctor raised an eyebrow\nbut didn&rsquo;t look away from the screen. &ldquo;Peter, are you Spiderman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Peter blinked. &ldquo;I see\nyour point.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>Tony and Peter sat across\nfrom each other at the kitchen table. A few floors down, the doctors were\nworking on the fix, while Rhodey had been sent away and Vision &ndash; well, Vision\nwas never there anyway. Tony had given his phone to the doctor and gotten him\nto text May that Peter was staying the night &ndash; he really didn&rsquo;t need Peter\nblabbing to May when she was the one person who had higher authority than Tony\nabout whether Spiderman was allowed to come and play or not.</p><p>So they stared at each other,\nneither wanting to speak in case they said something they shouldn&rsquo;t &ndash; but Peter\nshould&rsquo;ve recognised the look on Tony&rsquo;s face, that he had a plan brewing.</p><p>&ldquo;So, kid,&rdquo; Tony started.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this,&rdquo; Peter\ninterrupted. &ldquo;This is a bad idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got a girlfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter glared. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got a crush on anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter tried to hum to keep\nhis voice at bay, but he still said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this guy in my Lit class.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows and\nshrugged. &ldquo;Is he cute?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes and I&rsquo;m not doing this,\nMr Stark. We should spend the rest of the day apart until the doctors can fix\nthis.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if they can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Tony\nasked, though his voice was toying. &ldquo;What if we&rsquo;re stuck telling the truth\nforever?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you and Pepper are\ngoing to have to start going to marriage counselling,&rdquo; Peter replied.</p><p>&ldquo;We already go to marriage\ncounselling and we&rsquo;re not even married yet.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a pause. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shrugged to look as if\nhe was indifferent about it, but he averted his gaze all the same. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I fly around all day in a\ntin can. I worry her a lot. It&rsquo;s healthy, apparently, to go to therapy for\nthat.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter hesitated, then, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nreally not fourteen months sober?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You never told me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to worry you.\nPepper and Rhodey don&rsquo;t know, either, though I should probably tell them.&rdquo; There\nwas a long silence, in which the clock in the kitchen ticked every second and Peter\nwished they were closer to the ground so he could at least focus on the street\nnoises. Peter understood when Tony changed the subject. &ldquo;You never told me you\nwere interested in boys.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugged, but he found\nhimself staring at the table. &ldquo;You never asked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how this works,&rdquo; Peter\nreplied. &ldquo;I was planning to tell you eventually, but it&rsquo;s not a big thing, you\nknow? It&rsquo;s just&hellip; part of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool. It&rsquo;s part of\nme, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter raised his eyes to see\nTony&rsquo;s face, but he didn&rsquo;t need to really. Tony could only tell the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;The press likes to forget\nthat time I dated like four male models at once.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter cracked a smile. So did\nTony.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about\nthe drugs?&rdquo; Tony asked, immediately making Peter frown.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t want you to\nbe disappointed in me. Why did you ask me that? I thought we were having a\nmoment.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed, then tipped his\nhead back with a huff. &ldquo;You wanna watch a movie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything to stop talking.&rdquo;</p><p>They watched the first movie\nthat came up on Netflix &ndash; which happened to be some sappy rom com. Neither of\nthem paid much attention, hyper aware of the other and this curse they&rsquo;d been afflicted\nwith.</p><p>At some point during the\nfilm, Peter had started leaning against Tony&rsquo;s side, and Tony had swung an arm\naround his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; Tony asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always tired.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you sleep much last\nnight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For like an hour,&rdquo; Peter\nreplied.</p><p>On screen, the main couple\nwere arguing.
