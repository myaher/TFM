A couple of weeks ago I still believed they would give us the third act in the last two episodes but they didn\u2019t\u00a0(fuck them), but in my head that only means one thing: that\u00a0<b>the third act is yet to unfold.</b></p><p>(Now for this I drew some inspiration from @mehomom\u2018s <a href=\"https://mehomom.tumblr.com/post/185022174827/misseffie-listen-i-know-our-ending-sucked-a\">comment</a> on @misseffie\u2019s post).</p><p>Any writer no matter how basic and stupid (@D&amp;D) knows every story has a three-act structure:\u00a0<b>Setup</b>,\u00a0<b>Confrontation\u00a0</b>and\u00a0<b>Resolution</b>. It\u2019s writing 101. This applies to ships as well.</p><p>Gendrya:</p><ul><li><b>Setup:</b>\u00a0their arc from seasons 1, 2 and 3. They meet, they get along, she tells him the truth about her identity, blah blah blah, they separate after she asks him to go with her, he gets on a boat and rows forever. No one knows where he is or if he\u2019ll ever return and they don\u2019t see each other for years. A lot of things happen to them, especially Arya.</li><li><b>Confrontation:</b>\u00a0their arc from season 8. They reconnect, they flirt, they act on their attraction for one another, they separate after he offers her to go with him, she gets on a boat and will travel for a while, probably a few months or even years. Technically no one knows if she is going to return (although she obviously is. This is the girl who defeated death and saved humanity, there\u2019s no way she\u2019s going to die at sea without anyone knowing what happened to her).</li></ul><p>I think it\u2019s important to mention how big the things that separated them each time really are.

Technically no one knows if she is going to return (although she obviously is. This is the girl who defeated death and saved humanity, there&rsquo;s no way she&rsquo;s going to die at sea without anyone knowing what happened to her).</li></ul><p>I think it&rsquo;s important to mention how big the things that separated them each time really are. First it was the social difference, then it was the imminent power unbalance. @mehomom&#8203; calls them &ldquo;extra layers&rdquo;, layers they were able to ignore when they slept together because they thought they were going to die. They survived but they were also forced to remember those layers were&nbsp;<i>still </i>there and they were&nbsp;<i>still </i>preventing them from being together, which sucks because they love each other deeply but their timing <i>sucks </i>(more on that later).  </p><p>The way I see it the final episode settled the ground for the third act of their story: the&nbsp;<b>Resolution</b>. Unfortunately we won&rsquo;t get to see it on screen but the way their story was constructed points to them eventually reaching it in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>During the setup they were pretty much children (she was 11-12 and he was 16-17). During the confrontation they were technically adults (she was 18 and he was 23) but sometimes they still behaved like angsty drunken teenagers *<b>Lots of using of the word &ldquo;ready&rdquo; coming up, apologies in advance*. </b>Each time they separated it was because one of them wasn&rsquo;t ready. First time? She is ready (or as ready as a 13-year old can be) but he isn&rsquo;t; second time? He is ready (or as ready as a drunk, freshly legitimized blacksmith-turned-Lord can be) but she isn&rsquo;t. They weren&rsquo;t mature enough, they had other plans in mind, they were scared and confused about their feelings&mdash;choose your fighter, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But in the future? As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg-LmnbWAfjniAHzrPA34_Q\">@misseffie</a> says, <i>third time is the charm.</i></p><p>Arya was forced to grow up in the cruelest of ways. We all agree she is a badass and one of the best characters in GOT&mdash;and arguably in the history of fiction&mdash;but because of that badassery sometimes we forget she is still a <i>very </i>young woman. At 18 you are technically an adult, but emotionally? You are still a teenager. Most of us didn&rsquo;t know shit when we were that age, why would Arya be any different? Gendry is still very young as well. He and I are the same age and I still have no idea what to do with my life, and I&rsquo;m not the one who just inherited a castle, titles and lands after a life without nothing.</p><p>When they reconnect during the resolution they will finally be emotional adults. Gendry needs to learn how to be a Lord, to embrace his new responsibilities and overall adjust to his new identity and position. He&rsquo;ll have to learn how to read and write, about history, economics, politics, etiquette. Now I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;ll make the conscious decision to wait for her&mdash;because let&rsquo;s be honest, if it were the other way around we would all be screaming sexism&mdash; but he has a <i>long </i>road ahead, I seriously doubt he will have time to find himself a bride because he&rsquo;ll be busy learning stuff. Arya, on the other hand, will get to travel and know the world.&nbsp;She clearly wants to have new experiences now that she has embraced life, and she still needs to find herself after all the shit she went through (I&rsquo;ll elaborate more on this topic in another meta). They clearly weren&rsquo;t ready to be together the first time, they weren&rsquo;t ready to be together the second time, they&rsquo;ll <i>finally </i>be the third time. </p><p>Arya and Gendry&rsquo;s timing and their choice of words to confess their love has never been their strongest suit. They met when they were both fugitives (not the most romantic set up), Arya insinuated Gendry could work for her brother but Gendry was already sick of serving, she poured her heart out to him with the &ldquo;I can be your family&rdquo; line but he pointed out their class difference would be an obstacle. Fast forward to five years later and they met again a few days short of the apocalypse, did the nasty while death was literally knocking at the door (<i>again</i>, not the most romantic set up). Gendry word-vomited his devotion for Arya and asked her &ldquo;to be his wife&rdquo; and to &ldquo;be the Lady of Storm&rsquo;s End&rdquo;, but she turned him down because she didn&rsquo;t want that kind of life. When they reunite after Arya returns from her voyages their timing will <i>finally </i>be adequate, and hopefully the words they use to confess their feelings for each other will be as well.</p><p>It seems as if finding their way back to each other however unlikely the odds are is kind of Arya and Gendry&rsquo;s thing, and the hope of them reuniting is what kept the ship alive during the seasons they were apart. No one knew if we would see Gendry again, he could&rsquo;ve been lost at sea because of a storm or dead. We had to wait literal&nbsp;<i>years </i>to see him again. Now the same thing will happen to Arya. She&rsquo;ll be out of the game for a while and people will fear the worst. However she&rsquo;ll find her way back home again, she always does.</p></p>",
