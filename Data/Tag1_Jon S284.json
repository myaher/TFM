        "answer": "<p>Putting it under the cut for speculation &amp; spoilers</p><!-- more --><p>Do I think Jon and Dany will die in the end? Yes.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe not in HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones, where the producers have set up emphasis of Jon being heir or Daenerys being a mother, but even them I\u2019m 60% sure they\u2019ll die on the show. 90% sure for books.</p><p>More or less what Joanna said: Jon was brought back for a purpose. Whatever magic or God that brought him back didn\u2019t do it because they want to see a Targaryen restoration or because Jon is\u00a0\u201con of the good guys\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Read this except from ASOS:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDeath and life. Everywhere, opposites. Everywhere, the war.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe war?\u201d asked Davos.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe war,\u201d she affirmed. \u201cThere are two, Onion Knight. Not seven, not one, not a hundred or a thousand. Two!<b> Do you think I crossed half the world to put yet another vain king on yet another empty throne?</b> The war has been waged since time began, and before it is done, all men must choose where they will stand. On one side is R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror. Ours is not a choice between Baratheon and Lannister, between Greyjoy and Stark. <b>It is death we choose, or life. Darkness, or light.&ldquo;\u00a0</b></i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Whether he is a prince that was promised, a dragon rider, or simply someone with a diplomatic part to play in rallying Dany to fight for the living, Jon Snow has a part to play in the war for the dawn.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys most definitely does. Since that night that she walked into her husband\u2019s burning pyre and the music of dragons filled the air, she signed up herself for the destiny of one of the few people in the world with the power of stopping the others. One of the few people in the world who can unite East and West and North and South to fight a common enemy.</p><p>Since the first book, George R.R Martin lets us know that our actions have consequences. Even honorable Ned Stark was beheaded for doing what\u2019s right. Being a hero and doing what\u2019s right it\u2019s painful. It\u2019s not\u00a0\u201cAzor Ahai\u201d painful, where you can simply kill your beloved wife and that pain should be enough to count as a sacrifice.</p><p><a href=\"https://ladyofdragonstone.tumblr.com/post/177734727851/ladyofdragonstone-the-lightbringer-theory\">A true sacrifice would be heart wrenching. </a>I would be knowing your family and friends all live and you\u2019ll never get to see them thrive and be happy, but you know that now they have the chance to <i>live</i>. It would be knowing that you will never restore your family\u2019s dynasty. It would be dying next to your lover and knowing you\u2019ll never watch your child grow up.

Horror</b></p><p>Tyrion wasn&rsquo;t used to nightmares. He couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he had one. Maybe when he was a child, and he was hunted during the night by his sister&rsquo;s terrible &ldquo;jokes&rdquo; -as if he could really believe that those were just jokes, but still-. He wasn&rsquo;t even sure that was a nightmare, it didn&rsquo;t look like one. It looked more like a memory, though it couldn&rsquo;t be so because it was clear from what people were wearing in that fucking dream that it was from another period, from another century, maybe even from another millennium.</p><p>But the darkness was there, present and real, and Tyrion couldn&rsquo;t ignore it. He was too much a man of science to believe in dreams, but that night was different. Perhaps it was because it was Halloween night, perhaps because it was freezing cold. But those blue eyes, empty and too shining, were still in front of him, on pale, too pale skin. And pitch-black curls. </p><p>He tuned in the bed, searching for Jon&rsquo;s body as if seeing his boyfriend could help him in being sure that it was just a dream, but there was nobody there. And didn&rsquo;t matter that he was keeping tell himself not being stupid -he knew it wasn&rsquo;t-, his heart wasn&rsquo;t stopping to rush. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; He called. A moment later, he saw something flash in the dark hallway. How he didn&rsquo;t scream was something Tyrion couldn&rsquo;t tell, but he managed not to, while red eyes approached him. He knew those eyes: Ghost. </p><p>And if Jon&rsquo;s dog was there, it meant his owner wasn&rsquo;t so far. Jon emerged from the bathroom soon after. He was paler than usual, but his eyes were still dark even in the dim moonlight which intruded inside their house from outside. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon, are you fine?&rdquo; He asked, even if it was clear that he wasn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;I had a very strange nightmare,&rdquo; He answered and his glance was distant. &ldquo;Something about the Night King or&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion had no idea of what he was going to say.

        "body": "<p>(You\u2019re proposing that Jon and Dany sacrificing themselves to save the world would make sense, and the horrible thing is&hellip; from a certain perspective, it kind of does TT)</p><p>So I went back to scavenging bits and pieces from AGOT (because apparently all the clues are there for the endgame), trying to see if there were clues in there supporting this theory. P.S. This is meant to be a discussion:</p><p><i>&ldquo;It is not a matter of gold or\nhorses. This is bloodmagic, lady. Only death may pay for life.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Death?&rdquo; Dany wrapped her\narms around herself protectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. &ldquo;My\ndeath?&rdquo; She told herself she would die for him, if she must. She was the\nblood of the dragon, she would not be afraid. Her brother Rhaegar had died for\nthe woman he loved.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mirri Maz Duur\npromised. &ldquo;Not your death, Khaleesi.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Dany trembled with relief. &ldquo;Do\nit.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Ok. This brings me to the arguments you and others have made <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8tLPN-NsfT2b2s4aAdF3Sg\">@joannalannister</a> about self-sacrifice being the only kind of sacrifice that truly counts (shit). What\u2019s particularly shilling here is that Daenerys was ready to sacrifice herself: was that a red herring? Will she be faced with a similar choice once more? As <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4rA6TO-EQRRVGq9rEiUF5w\">@turtle-paced</a> previously pointed out, her dragons were likely born because she chose to walk into the fire herself (i.e self-sacrifice). Everything else - Drogo, Rhaego - turned to shit because Dany didn\u2019t\u00a0\u201cneed\u201d to sacrifice herself (according to MMD).\u00a0</p><p><i>Wind whispered through the stable,\na <b>cold dead breath on his face</b>, but Jon paid it no mind. He strapped his roll\nto the saddle, <b>his scarred fingers </b>stiff and clumsy. &ldquo;Ghost,&rdquo; he\ncalled softly, &ldquo;to me.&rdquo; And the wolf was there, eyes like embers.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Jon, please. You must not do\nthis.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p>Why&hellip; urgh, this reeks of nasty <b>I\u2019m-the-sacrificial-lamb</b> foreshadowing (why, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8tLPN-NsfT2b2s4aAdF3Sg\">@joannalannister</a>, why?). The\u00a0\u201ccold dead breath\u201d, the\u00a0\u201cscarred\u201d (remove one of the R&hellip;) finger, Sam\u2019s plea&hellip;\u00a0</p><p><i>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The\nsouthron had it easier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them\nthe gods&rsquo; will and help sort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the\nold gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.</i><br/></p><p>Reminds me of another thing you said. That self-sacrifice must be a choice, freely made, not one imposed on you.

                "content": "<p>(You&rsquo;re proposing that Jon and Dany sacrificing themselves to save the world would make sense, and the horrible thing is&hellip; from a certain perspective, it kind of does TT)</p><p>So I went back to scavenging bits and pieces from AGOT (because apparently all the clues are there for the endgame), trying to see if there were clues in there supporting this theory. P.S. This is meant to be a discussion:</p><p><i>&ldquo;It is not a matter of gold or\nhorses. This is bloodmagic, lady. Only death may pay for life.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Death?&rdquo; Dany wrapped her\narms around herself protectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. &ldquo;My\ndeath?&rdquo; She told herself she would die for him, if she must. She was the\nblood of the dragon, she would not be afraid. Her brother Rhaegar had died for\nthe woman he loved.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mirri Maz Duur\npromised. &ldquo;Not your death, Khaleesi.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Dany trembled with relief. &ldquo;Do\nit.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Ok. This brings me to the arguments you and others have made <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8tLPN-NsfT2b2s4aAdF3Sg\">@joannalannister</a> about self-sacrifice being the only kind of sacrifice that truly counts (shit). What&rsquo;s particularly shilling here is that Daenerys was ready to sacrifice herself: was that a red herring? Will she be faced with a similar choice once more? As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4rA6TO-EQRRVGq9rEiUF5w\">@turtle-paced</a> previously pointed out, her dragons were likely born because she chose to walk into the fire herself (i.e self-sacrifice). Everything else - Drogo, Rhaego - turned to shit because Dany didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;&ldquo;need&rdquo; to sacrifice herself (according to MMD).&nbsp;</p><p><i>Wind whispered through the stable,\na <b>cold dead breath on his face</b>, but Jon paid it no mind. He strapped his roll\nto the saddle, <b>his scarred fingers </b>stiff and clumsy. &ldquo;Ghost,&rdquo; he\ncalled softly, &ldquo;to me.&rdquo; And the wolf was there, eyes like embers.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Jon, please. You must not do\nthis.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p>Why&hellip; urgh, this reeks of nasty <b>I&rsquo;m-the-sacrificial-lamb</b> foreshadowing (why, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8tLPN-NsfT2b2s4aAdF3Sg\">@joannalannister</a>, why?). The&nbsp;&ldquo;cold dead breath&rdquo;, the&nbsp;&ldquo;scarred&rdquo; (remove one of the R&hellip;) finger, Sam&rsquo;s plea&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p><i>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The\nsouthron had it easier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them\nthe gods&rsquo; will and help sort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the\nold gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.</i><br /></p><p>Reminds me of another thing you said. That self-sacrifice must be a choice, freely made, not one imposed on you. Not something you&rsquo;d be coerced into (whether it be by the gods or else).&nbsp;</p><p><i>A bank of <b>melting snow</b>&nbsp;lay under the trees, bright in the\nmoonlight, water trickling off to form small shallow pools. Jon squatted and\nbrought his hands together, cupping the <b>runoff</b>\nbetween his fingers.&nbsp;</i></p><p>This part I&rsquo;m not so sure&hellip; the&nbsp;&ldquo;melting snow&rdquo; probably represents Jon himself,&nbsp;&ldquo;melting&rdquo; (whether it&rsquo;s an identity matter or something more&hellip; literal), and it disagreeably reminds me of Ygritte&rsquo;s death, in a puddle of old melting snow. Then again&hellip; you&rsquo;ve then got Jon&nbsp;&ldquo;cupping the runoff&rdquo; (another hint that the snow refers to himself, since he&rsquo;s running away from the Night&rsquo;s Watch in this chapter), meaning&hellip; what, exactly?&nbsp;</p><p>(There&rsquo;s also the&nbsp;&ldquo;bright in the moonlight&rdquo; part&hellip; does it point to J + D?)</p><p><i><b>Dawn</b> was still an hour off when Jon\nglimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of them, <b>dark against the pale immensity</b> of the Wall. <b>It did not seem like home this time.</b></i></p><p><b>(&hellip;)</b></p><p><i><b>My\nplace is here &hellip; where is yours, boy</b>?&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>I have no place, Jon wanted to say,\nI&rsquo;m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now not even a father.\nThe words would not come. \"I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Lord\nCommander Mormont. &ldquo;The cold winds are rising, Snow. <b>Beyond the Wall,</b> the shadows lengthen.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://tatticstudio55.tumblr.com/post/175275515711/why-jon-had-to-die\">There&rsquo;s another passage in ASOS that seemingly points to Jon&rsquo;s true&nbsp;&ldquo;place&rdquo; being beyond the Wall - it&rsquo;s where he belongs, it&rsquo;s who he is.&nbsp;</a>Ick factor is,&nbsp;&ldquo;beyond the Wall&rdquo; sounds like a barely hidden metaphor for&nbsp;&ldquo;dying&rdquo;. Or&hellip; as my dear <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8tLPN-NsfT2b2s4aAdF3Sg\">@joannalannister</a> pointed out, it could stand for the&nbsp;&ldquo;Faerie&rdquo; land, the land beyond the curtain of light&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>(It&rsquo;s bizarre, actually, because I made a post a few months ago about Jon&rsquo;s death - the first one, anyway, at the end of ADWD - allowing him full&nbsp;&ldquo;passage&rdquo; into a more&nbsp;&ldquo;faerie-ish&rdquo; self, <a href=\"https://tatticstudio55.tumblr.com/post/173845343496/starklings-and-the-snow-queen\">here</a>. I didn&rsquo;t really associate this&nbsp;&ldquo;faerie&rdquo; land/state/self with death (or death to come), but that&rsquo;s another matter open for discussion, I suppose :o)&nbsp;</p><p>But anyway, to wrap it up: the Dany passage I cited takes place in the evening (or just before the sunset) and is brought to a conclusion the following morning (or some following morning, doesn&rsquo;t really matter. That&rsquo;s accessory.), when she wakes up and find out about the death of her child, Drogo&rsquo;s vegetative state, etc. The Jon passages I cited takes place during the night and are brought to a conclusion the following morning. So I wonder: are we to take the events of these nights as foreshadowing to what will happen during the real&nbsp;&ldquo;long night&rdquo;? Will J and D be&nbsp;&ldquo;tested&rdquo; again, faced with difficult choices, and does it more or less spells doom for them, or could it allow for another, less&hellip; <i>tragic</i> resolution?&nbsp;</p><p>(I&rsquo;ll just tag a bunch of people who might be interested in this discussion.
