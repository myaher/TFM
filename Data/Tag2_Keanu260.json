Y/n was on the last month of her pregnancy, she doctor had insisted on bed rest on her seventh month when she fainted. She had scared John that day, he worried that someone was seriously wrong with his wife and their unborn baby. He had rushed her straight to the hospital in his car, not wanting to wait for an ambulance, he did not want to take a risk. It was at the hospital they learnt Y/n\u2019s blood pressure was dangerously high and warned her to rest, to stay in bed.</p><p>The fact that she was told to rest made her furious, she hated being still for so long and longed to be outside, feeling the breeze against her skin. Y/n missed their walks together along the beach, going hiking and travelling. Although she loved her unborn baby, Y/n could not wait for them to come so that she could get out of the house. \u00a0</p><p>She felt guilty that her husband John had to do everything, the laundry, the cooking and the cleaning. He did reassure her that he was okay with it, that he could manage, he had been prefect. Sometimes she thought she did not deserve him, she had dreamt of finding a husband as good as him and never thought it would come true. </p><p>So as a thank you she surprised him with a gift, a beautiful beagle puppy called Daisy. Her sister had helped her look for the perfect one, a dog that could accompany him where she could not. Y/n had even found it harder to move as her stomach swelled and felt as if she was keeping him trapped inside their home. Y/n waited patiently for her husband to return from work, as she placed the dog crate on top of the coffee table. She may have looked small but she was heavier than she initially thought, it wasn\u2019t long till John arrived home from his job. His head tilted in curiosity when he caught sight of the small crate on the coffee table.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 he asks her as he takes a seat beside his wife.</p><p>\u2018Well I got you a gift\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I see that, what is it?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Open it up and take a look\u2019 Y/n tells him as she rolls her eyes, but holds her breath in anticipation as she hopes that she hasn\u2019t made the wrong decision.<br/></p><p>Y/n watches carefully from her spot as she watches John open the door the crate and moves his hands inside. Slowly he pulls out a furry surprise, a gift he had not been expecting.</p><p>\u2018You got me a dog?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Yeah her name is Daisy, I thought you could use some company since I am on best rest and I felt guilty I couldn\u2019t spend time with you like we used to\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t have to do this\u2019 he tells as he quilty gazes at her before focusing his attention on the bundle in his hands.</p><p>\u2018I wanted to, please\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, okay. I\u2019m not going to get rid of her\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I hoped not, how can you deny such cuteness. She is adorable, you cannot say she isn\u2019t\u2019<br/></p><p>John lowers the puppy into his lap before slowly stroking her but the poor creature got excited and jumped up to lick him on the face. Y/n could not stop herself from laughing as he scowled at her, his face soon relaxed when Daisy got herself comfortable once again in his lap.\u00a0</p><p>It took a little time for both John and Y/n to get used to the early wake up calls in the morning, but they knew in the coming weeks that they would be in the same thing with their newborn baby. Y/n was getting excited and could not wait to see their baby in her arms.</p><p>It was late at night, Y/n was home alone with Daisy as John had went out to the store in search for another one of her strange cravings but he never complained and went willingly. John had made her so happy, she had never met anyone quite like him and he told her everything about his past. At the time she thought he was mad, Y/n thought things that he told her about only happened in movies and not in real life. That was when he showed her his weapons that he kept from his past life; she had been worried at first that the man she had fallen in love with was not who he appeared to be. He had promised her that part of his life was over now that he had met her; he knew what he had been missing out on. He vowed never to return to that life he once lived, he wanted to spend the rest of his days with the woman he loved the most.</p><p>Y/n lay in bed with Daisy curled around her growing belly; Daisy had become protective of Y/n as of late even though she bought her for John. It hadn\u2019t been long since John had left as Y/n lay awake, finding it hard to sleep and become comfortable. Her unborn child was having fun kicking her bladder and putting pressure onto her spine. It was quiet inside the house, the only noise coming from a ticking clock and Daisy lightly snoring. Y/n held her book in her hand as she tried hard to forget about her hunger pangs, she hoped her husband wouldn\u2019t take long as she was becoming famished. Her mind was pulled from her book as she heard a noise coming from the hallway; it was too soon for John to be back already. Curious to find what was going on, Y/n places her book down cabinet before pushing the bedsheets aside; waking Daisy up in the process. </p><p>She quietly stands from the bed as she shudders when her feet touch the cold floor, worried that it may not be her husband she takes her baseball bat from her closet, trying her hardest not to make a noise. Y/n stands still for a moment at her closed bedroom door as she listens for any further noise; she swears she can hear footsteps as she looks at Daisy her ears are twitching as if she can hear something.</p><p>Y/n knows she should just stay inside her room as John would go mad if she risked her life, instead she doesn\u2019t listen to her own reasoning and starts to slowly open the bedroom door. Daisy doesn\u2019t remain by her side, instead she runs off; no doubt in search for the noise. </p><p>\u2018Daisy\u2026come back\u2019 she quietly demands, but the excited pup does not listen \u2018Fuck. God I hope it\u2019s you John\u2019</p><p>Y/n walks barefoot along the hallway, her feet not making any noise as she walks on the hardwood floor. Her heart is beating fast in her chest she thinks she can hear it; she is almost at the top of the stairs when she hears voices coming from downstairs. </p><p>\u2018Shit, shit\u2019 she quietly mutters to herself, turning her back she walks as fast as she could back to her bedroom. As she walks into her room she picks up her cell phone from her bedside table, she immediately calls John, hoping that he picks up. But instead of him picking up the phone continues to ring until it goes to voicemail \u2018John you need to come home I think there is someone in our house. Please come back as soon as you get this\u2019</p><p>Y/n hangs up the phone but as she looks around there was no sign that Daisy had followed her back, she grows worried that the people downstairs may find her. She cannot find herself to wait and find out if she will be discovered, she grabs her bat and goes back to the stairs but this time she finds herself walking down them. </p><p>\u2018Trash the place! Send him a message! No one says no to me!\u2019 she hears the voice yell \u2018Oh look we </p><p>have here a cute little doggy, come here\u2019</p><p>Scared that they would harm Daisy she makes her presence known as she walks into the living room, there she finds two large men dressed in black and another scrawny man, neither which she recognised.</p><p>\u2018What the hell are you doing in my house?!\u2019 she asks them as she holds out her bat in front of her, the men were surprised to see her; they clearly had no idea that she had been there \u2018Who are you?!\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I am looking for the man that lives here, drives a nice car\u2019</p><p>\u2018John?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where is he?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He isn\u2019t here, but he will be home any minute. I called him and he will be here soon, so I would get out of here while you can\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oooohhhh I scared\u2019 the young man tells her as he laughs, his voice echoing through the house. </p><p>\u2018I mean it get the hell out!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And what do you think you can do huh? I mean look at you, you can barely move\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh yeah but that does not stop me shoving this bat up your ass does it? I throw a good swing too, wanna see\u2019 Y/n was trying her hardest not to show that she was scared, inside she was terrified that something may happen to both her and her child \u2018Thought not, get the fuck out of my house or you are going to have to deal with my husband when he comes back. Believe me he will not be happy when he finds you in here\u2019</p><p>\u2018Deal with her\u2019</p><p>The young man looks at his goons, who slowly make his way towards her as she keeps her bat in front of her; ready to swing. </p><p>\u2018Stay away from me! Keep back!\u2019 Y/n demands \u2018I said stay back!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut her up!\u2019</p><p>One of the goons stands right in front of her, his frame towering over her, he startles her as he removes the bat from her hold and before she knows it he throws a punch right at her. A searing pain spreads across her face, her eyes flutter shut as her world turns black. Her eyes slowly open as she feels herself being shaken awake, she is having trouble opening one of her eyes but as she looks up she sees John Hovering over her.</p><p>\u2018John?\u2019 her voice cracks.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here\u2019</p><p>\u2018The men\u2019</p><p>\u2018They left before I got here, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get here sooner\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have nothing to be sorry about, this is my fault. The men who came here did they sound Russian?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yes, yes I think so\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck this is my entire fault, I saw them earlier today. That kid wanted to buy my car, I told him it was not for sale. Then he does this\u2019 he tells her, tears are falling down his cheeks \u2018I\u2019ve called an ambulance, they should be here soon\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about the cops?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s been dealt with. We need to get you out of here; we need to make sure the baby is okay\u2019</p><p>\u2018Daisy? Did you find her? She ran off before I could find her\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m so sorry Y/n, they killed her\u2019</p><p>\u2018They killed her?\u2019 she asks, instead of crying the anger builds up inside of her \u2018You need to find them John; they attack me, trash the place and kill Daisy over a car. What else could they do, please John you know what to do\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, I will\u2019</p>",

Y/n was on the last month of her pregnancy, she doctor had insisted on bed rest on her seventh month when she fainted. She had scared John that day, he worried that someone was seriously wrong with his wife and their unborn baby. He had rushed her straight to the hospital in his car, not wanting to wait for an ambulance, he did not want to take a risk. It was at the hospital they learnt Y/n\u2019s blood pressure was dangerously high and warned her to rest, to stay in bed.</p><p>The fact that she was told to rest made her furious, she hated being still for so long and longed to be outside, feeling the breeze against her skin. Y/n missed their walks together along the beach, going hiking and travelling. Although she loved her unborn baby, Y/n could not wait for them to come so that she could get out of the house. \u00a0</p><p>She felt guilty that her husband John had to do everything, the laundry, the cooking and the cleaning. He did reassure her that he was okay with it, that he could manage, he had been prefect. Sometimes she thought she did not deserve him, she had dreamt of finding a husband as good as him and never thought it would come true. </p><p>So as a thank you she surprised him with a gift, a beautiful beagle puppy called Daisy. Her sister had helped her look for the perfect one, a dog that could accompany him where she could not. Y/n had even found it harder to move as her stomach swelled and felt as if she was keeping him trapped inside their home. Y/n waited patiently for her husband to return from work, as she placed the dog crate on top of the coffee table. She may have looked small but she was heavier than she initially thought, it wasn\u2019t long till John arrived home from his job. His head tilted in curiosity when he caught sight of the small crate on the coffee table.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 he asks her as he takes a seat beside his wife.</p><p>\u2018Well I got you a gift\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I see that, what is it?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Open it up and take a look\u2019 Y/n tells him as she rolls her eyes, but holds her breath in anticipation as she hopes that she hasn\u2019t made the wrong decision.<br></p><p>Y/n watches carefully from her spot as she watches John open the door the crate and moves his hands inside. Slowly he pulls out a furry surprise, a gift he had not been expecting.</p><p>\u2018You got me a dog?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Yeah her name is Daisy, I thought you could use some company since I am on best rest and I felt guilty I couldn\u2019t spend time with you like we used to\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t have to do this\u2019 he tells as he quilty gazes at her before focusing his attention on the bundle in his hands.</p><p>\u2018I wanted to, please\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, okay. I\u2019m not going to get rid of her\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I hoped not, how can you deny such cuteness. She is adorable, you cannot say she isn\u2019t\u2019<br></p><p>John lowers the puppy into his lap before slowly stroking her but the poor creature got excited and jumped up to lick him on the face. Y/n could not stop herself from laughing as he scowled at her, his face soon relaxed when Daisy got herself comfortable once again in his lap.\u00a0</p><p>It took a little time for both John and Y/n to get used to the early wake up calls in the morning, but they knew in the coming weeks that they would be in the same thing with their newborn baby. Y/n was getting excited and could not wait to see their baby in her arms.</p><p>It was late at night, Y/n was home alone with Daisy as John had went out to the store in search for another one of her strange cravings but he never complained and went willingly. John had made her so happy, she had never met anyone quite like him and he told her everything about his past. At the time she thought he was mad, Y/n thought things that he told her about only happened in movies and not in real life. That was when he showed her his weapons that he kept from his past life; she had been worried at first that the man she had fallen in love with was not who he appeared to be. He had promised her that part of his life was over now that he had met her; he knew what he had been missing out on. He vowed never to return to that life he once lived, he wanted to spend the rest of his days with the woman he loved the most.</p><p>Y/n lay in bed with Daisy curled around her growing belly; Daisy had become protective of Y/n as of late even though she bought her for John. It hadn\u2019t been long since John had left as Y/n lay awake, finding it hard to sleep and become comfortable. Her unborn child was having fun kicking her bladder and putting pressure onto her spine. It was quiet inside the house, the only noise coming from a ticking clock and Daisy lightly snoring. Y/n held her book in her hand as she tried hard to forget about her hunger pangs, she hoped her husband wouldn\u2019t take long as she was becoming famished. Her mind was pulled from her book as she heard a noise coming from the hallway; it was too soon for John to be back already. Curious to find what was going on, Y/n places her book down cabinet before pushing the bedsheets aside; waking Daisy up in the process. </p><p>She quietly stands from the bed as she shudders when her feet touch the cold floor, worried that it may not be her husband she takes her baseball bat from her closet, trying her hardest not to make a noise. Y/n stands still for a moment at her closed bedroom door as she listens for any further noise; she swears she can hear footsteps as she looks at Daisy her ears are twitching as if she can hear something.</p><p>Y/n knows she should just stay inside her room as John would go mad if she risked her life, instead she doesn\u2019t listen to her own reasoning and starts to slowly open the bedroom door. Daisy doesn\u2019t remain by her side, instead she runs off; no doubt in search for the noise. </p><p>\u2018Daisy\u2026come back\u2019 she quietly demands, but the excited pup does not listen \u2018Fuck. God I hope it\u2019s you John\u2019</p><p>Y/n walks barefoot along the hallway, her feet not making any noise as she walks on the hardwood floor. Her heart is beating fast in her chest she thinks she can hear it; she is almost at the top of the stairs when she hears voices coming from downstairs. </p><p>\u2018Shit, shit\u2019 she quietly mutters to herself, turning her back she walks as fast as she could back to her bedroom. As she walks into her room she picks up her cell phone from her bedside table, she immediately calls John, hoping that he picks up. But instead of him picking up the phone continues to ring until it goes to voicemail \u2018John you need to come home I think there is someone in our house. Please come back as soon as you get this\u2019</p><p>Y/n hangs up the phone but as she looks around there was no sign that Daisy had followed her back, she grows worried that the people downstairs may find her. She cannot find herself to wait and find out if she will be discovered, she grabs her bat and goes back to the stairs but this time she finds herself walking down them. </p><p>\u2018Trash the place! Send him a message! No one says no to me!\u2019 she hears the voice yell \u2018Oh look we </p><p>have here a cute little doggy, come here\u2019</p><p>Scared that they would harm Daisy she makes her presence known as she walks into the living room, there she finds two large men dressed in black and another scrawny man, neither which she recognised.</p><p>\u2018What the hell are you doing in my house?!\u2019 she asks them as she holds out her bat in front of her, the men were surprised to see her; they clearly had no idea that she had been there \u2018Who are you?!\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I am looking for the man that lives here, drives a nice car\u2019</p><p>\u2018John?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where is he?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He isn\u2019t here, but he will be home any minute. I called him and he will be here soon, so I would get out of here while you can\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oooohhhh I scared\u2019 the young man tells her as he laughs, his voice echoing through the house. </p><p>\u2018I mean it get the hell out!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And what do you think you can do huh? I mean look at you, you can barely move\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh yeah but that does not stop me shoving this bat up your ass does it? I throw a good swing too, wanna see\u2019 Y/n was trying her hardest not to show that she was scared, inside she was terrified that something may happen to both her and her child \u2018Thought not, get the fuck out of my house or you are going to have to deal with my husband when he comes back. Believe me he will not be happy when he finds you in here\u2019</p><p>\u2018Deal with her\u2019</p><p>The young man looks at his goons, who slowly make his way towards her as she keeps her bat in front of her; ready to swing. </p><p>\u2018Stay away from me! Keep back!\u2019 Y/n demands \u2018I said stay back!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut her up!\u2019</p><p>One of the goons stands right in front of her, his frame towering over her, he startles her as he removes the bat from her hold and before she knows it he throws a punch right at her. A searing pain spreads across her face, her eyes flutter shut as her world turns black. Her eyes slowly open as she feels herself being shaken awake, she is having trouble opening one of her eyes but as she looks up she sees John Hovering over her.</p><p>\u2018John?\u2019 her voice cracks.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here\u2019</p><p>\u2018The men\u2019</p><p>\u2018They left before I got here, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get here sooner\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have nothing to be sorry about, this is my fault. The men who came here did they sound Russian?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Yes, yes I think so\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck this is my entire fault, I saw them earlier today. That kid wanted to buy my car, I told him it was not for sale. Then he does this\u2019 he tells her, tears are falling down his cheeks \u2018I\u2019ve called an ambulance, they should be here soon\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about the cops?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s been dealt with. We need to get you out of here; we need to make sure the baby is okay\u2019</p><p>\u2018Daisy? Did you find her? She ran off before I could find her\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m so sorry Y/n, they killed her\u2019</p><p>\u2018They killed her?\u2019 she asks, instead of crying the anger builds up inside of her \u2018You need to find them John; they attack me, trash the place and kill Daisy over a car. What else could they do, please John you know what to do\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, I will\u2019</p></p>",

Y/n was on the last month of her pregnancy, she doctor had insisted on bed rest on her seventh month when she fainted. She had scared John that day, he worried that someone was seriously wrong with his wife and their unborn baby. He had rushed her straight to the hospital in his car, not wanting to wait for an ambulance, he did not want to take a risk. It was at the hospital they learnt Y/n&rsquo;s blood pressure was dangerously high and warned her to rest, to stay in bed.</p><p>The fact that she was told to rest made her furious, she hated being still for so long and longed to be outside, feeling the breeze against her skin. Y/n missed their walks together along the beach, going hiking and travelling. Although she loved her unborn baby, Y/n could not wait for them to come so that she could get out of the house. &nbsp;</p><p>She felt guilty that her husband John had to do everything, the laundry, the cooking and the cleaning. He did reassure her that he was okay with it, that he could manage, he had been prefect. Sometimes she thought she did not deserve him, she had dreamt of finding a husband as good as him and never thought it would come true. </p><p>So as a thank you she surprised him with a gift, a beautiful beagle puppy called Daisy. Her sister had helped her look for the perfect one, a dog that could accompany him where she could not. Y/n had even found it harder to move as her stomach swelled and felt as if she was keeping him trapped inside their home. Y/n waited patiently for her husband to return from work, as she placed the dog crate on top of the coffee table. She may have looked small but she was heavier than she initially thought, it wasn&rsquo;t long till John arrived home from his job. His head tilted in curiosity when he caught sight of the small crate on the coffee table.</p><p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo; he asks her as he takes a seat beside his wife.</p><p>&lsquo;Well I got you a gift&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I see that, what is it?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Open it up and take a look&rsquo; Y/n tells him as she rolls her eyes, but holds her breath in anticipation as she hopes that she hasn&rsquo;t made the wrong decision.<br /></p><p>Y/n watches carefully from her spot as she watches John open the door the crate and moves his hands inside. Slowly he pulls out a furry surprise, a gift he had not been expecting.</p><p>&lsquo;You got me a dog?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Yeah her name is Daisy, I thought you could use some company since I am on best rest and I felt guilty I couldn&rsquo;t spend time with you like we used to&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to do this&rsquo; he tells as he quilty gazes at her before focusing his attention on the bundle in his hands.</p><p>&lsquo;I wanted to, please&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Okay, okay. I&rsquo;m not going to get rid of her&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I hoped not, how can you deny such cuteness. She is adorable, you cannot say she isn&rsquo;t&rsquo;<br /></p><p>John lowers the puppy into his lap before slowly stroking her but the poor creature got excited and jumped up to lick him on the face. Y/n could not stop herself from laughing as he scowled at her, his face soon relaxed when Daisy got herself comfortable once again in his lap.&nbsp;</p><p>It took a little time for both John and Y/n to get used to the early wake up calls in the morning, but they knew in the coming weeks that they would be in the same thing with their newborn baby. Y/n was getting excited and could not wait to see their baby in her arms.</p><p>It was late at night, Y/n was home alone with Daisy as John had went out to the store in search for another one of her strange cravings but he never complained and went willingly. John had made her so happy, she had never met anyone quite like him and he told her everything about his past. At the time she thought he was mad, Y/n thought things that he told her about only happened in movies and not in real life. That was when he showed her his weapons that he kept from his past life; she had been worried at first that the man she had fallen in love with was not who he appeared to be. He had promised her that part of his life was over now that he had met her; he knew what he had been missing out on. He vowed never to return to that life he once lived, he wanted to spend the rest of his days with the woman he loved the most.</p><p>Y/n lay in bed with Daisy curled around her growing belly; Daisy had become protective of Y/n as of late even though she bought her for John. It hadn&rsquo;t been long since John had left as Y/n lay awake, finding it hard to sleep and become comfortable. Her unborn child was having fun kicking her bladder and putting pressure onto her spine. It was quiet inside the house, the only noise coming from a ticking clock and Daisy lightly snoring. Y/n held her book in her hand as she tried hard to forget about her hunger pangs, she hoped her husband wouldn&rsquo;t take long as she was becoming famished. Her mind was pulled from her book as she heard a noise coming from the hallway; it was too soon for John to be back already. Curious to find what was going on, Y/n places her book down cabinet before pushing the bedsheets aside; waking Daisy up in the process. </p><p>She quietly stands from the bed as she shudders when her feet touch the cold floor, worried that it may not be her husband she takes her baseball bat from her closet, trying her hardest not to make a noise. Y/n stands still for a moment at her closed bedroom door as she listens for any further noise; she swears she can hear footsteps as she looks at Daisy her ears are twitching as if she can hear something.</p><p>Y/n knows she should just stay inside her room as John would go mad if she risked her life, instead she doesn&rsquo;t listen to her own reasoning and starts to slowly open the bedroom door. Daisy doesn&rsquo;t remain by her side, instead she runs off; no doubt in search for the noise. </p><p>&lsquo;Daisy&hellip;come back&rsquo; she quietly demands, but the excited pup does not listen &lsquo;Fuck. God I hope it&rsquo;s you John&rsquo;</p><p>Y/n walks barefoot along the hallway, her feet not making any noise as she walks on the hardwood floor. Her heart is beating fast in her chest she thinks she can hear it; she is almost at the top of the stairs when she hears voices coming from downstairs. </p><p>&lsquo;Shit, shit&rsquo; she quietly mutters to herself, turning her back she walks as fast as she could back to her bedroom. As she walks into her room she picks up her cell phone from her bedside table, she immediately calls John, hoping that he picks up. But instead of him picking up the phone continues to ring until it goes to voicemail &lsquo;John you need to come home I think there is someone in our house. Please come back as soon as you get this&rsquo;</p><p>Y/n hangs up the phone but as she looks around there was no sign that Daisy had followed her back, she grows worried that the people downstairs may find her. She cannot find herself to wait and find out if she will be discovered, she grabs her bat and goes back to the stairs but this time she finds herself walking down them. </p><p>&lsquo;Trash the place! Send him a message! No one says no to me!&rsquo; she hears the voice yell &lsquo;Oh look we </p><p>have here a cute little doggy, come here&rsquo;</p><p>Scared that they would harm Daisy she makes her presence known as she walks into the living room, there she finds two large men dressed in black and another scrawny man, neither which she recognised.</p><p>&lsquo;What the hell are you doing in my house?!&rsquo; she asks them as she holds out her bat in front of her, the men were surprised to see her; they clearly had no idea that she had been there &lsquo;Who are you?!&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;I am looking for the man that lives here, drives a nice car&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;John?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t here, but he will be home any minute.
