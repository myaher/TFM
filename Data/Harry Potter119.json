Your eyes. Your hair. Your weight. Your personality. You hated everything.<br/></p><p>Everything about yourself, you despised.</p><p>You were standing in front of your full body mirror, making disgusted faces at your horrid figure.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what you saw about yourself, that&rsquo;s how you treated your self-care and ego. All your friends always argued against your view, saying how you were much better than you thought to be.</p><p>Thankful for your separate room- (being a prefect had its perks)- you kept turning and staring and thinking about your horridness.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know that Lily was about to burst in and save you from your self-loathing mind, so you continued to look at yourself in disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! Do you wanna- Y/N? What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>Lily Evans stood in your doorway, looking saddened at you standing in front of your mirror, you looking disgusted.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m just looking at how much I dislike our uniforms&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two days ago you were discussing how much you liked these uniforms compared to your muggle friends&rsquo; ones at their high school. I&rsquo;m not foolish, Y/N. I know what you&rsquo;re doing and thinking, and I want you to know a lot of us are here for you, as well as the fact that you&rsquo;re drop dead <i>gorgeous</i>. Why don&rsquo;t you see what we see?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s not true! It&rsquo;s not bloody true, Lily! Can&rsquo;t you accept the fact that I&rsquo;m ugly and horrible and no one will ever look at me the way they look at you?!&rdquo;</p><p>Lily had come closer to your slightly trembling figure. &ldquo;Is this what your self-loathing is about this time?&rdquo; She asked softly.</p><p>You nod your head. Sometimes you got like this- it was a cycle. First was self-hate. Next was comforting from close friends. Next came parties, hooking up, leaving quickly the next morning and trying not to fall in love. And then, self-hate came again straight after you looked back at what you did.</p><p>It was easy to say that your coping mechanisms were shit.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m so sorry Lily! I have this constant, like, despair cycle and I-I&rsquo;ve gotten you heavily involved!&rdquo;</p><p>She took a seat on your bed and sighed. &ldquo;Y/N, you haven&rsquo;t dragged me into your &lsquo;despair cycle&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ve let myself be involved because I want to help you. I know that you&rsquo;ve gone through this a lot, but I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;ll ALWAYS be here because I care. You&rsquo;re one of my best friends. I will not leave your side until you&rsquo;ve gotten better. Now, how can I cheer you up?&rdquo;</p><p>You glanced at Lily who was sitting there patiently, her red hair ablaze with the glow of the sunset. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m like this, Lils. I&rsquo;ll cheer myself up- I heard there was a party in the-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Y/N, I won&rsquo;t let you break your own heart at a party.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I <i>want</i> to go!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will it actually benefit <i>healthily</i> you this time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>You watched as Lily heaved a big sigh, rubbing at her temples. &ldquo;Alright, this is the <i>absolute</i> last time. If I don&rsquo;t see any self-improvement, I will officially be taking away your party privileges.&rdquo;</p><p>A big smile breaks through your lips as you sit down by Lily as squash her in a hug. &ldquo;Thanks, Lils.&rdquo;</p><p>After a few more hours hanging out together, you both started getting ready.</p><p>&ldquo;How do I look, Lily?&rdquo; You twirl around in a dark blue dress, letting Lily see your whole outfit. The two of you were trying on multiple different outfits in your dorm for the party in the Gryffindor common room.</p><p>&ldquo;As always, you look good. Shall we, my lady?&rdquo; Lily offers, holding her arm up towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;We shall.&rdquo;</p><p>You link her arm in yours look at her outfit, consisting of flattering jeans and a nice fitting lace long sleeve. Your heart falls at the thought that even though she was dressed more casually than you, she still looked better.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>You look up to see Lily&rsquo;s green eyes staring into yours. &ldquo;Yep! I&rsquo;m fine. Totally cool. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p><p>You were not fine. An invisible force was tugging you, and you were tugging Lily. You WANTED to go to this party to forget everything, but at the same time, you dreaded the thought of seeing everyone all over again.</p><p>With your mind lost in a never-ending train of thought, you halt just in front of the Gryffindor common room portrait entrance.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! I almost forgot there was a password. <i>Flitterbloom</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>The portrait of the fat lady swung open towards you as you and Lily climbed through the opening.</p><p>There was already mildly loud music, dim lighting and trays everywhere floating themselves around, carrying either butterbeer, firewhiskey or muggle alcohol. Possibly even mixed drinks.</p><p>Almost immediately, the marauders were by your side. &ldquo;Y/N! Lily! Glad you two could make it. Remus isn&rsquo;t going to be here yet, though. He&rsquo;s going to 'pack in a bit of studying&rsquo; before relaxing down here. Now, have a drink or two!&rdquo; Sirius was already chatting and attempting to coax the two of you into drinks and drunkness.</p><p>Before you were about to drag Lily away, James Potter came into the scene. &ldquo;Evans! Great to see you! You look lovely as ever. Did I mention how every time I look into your eyes I get lost?&rdquo;</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes at the pathetic pickup line from James. &ldquo;Potter, you&rsquo;ve had better pickup lines. Maybe if you up your game a lot more, I&rsquo;ll let you <i>actually</i> pick me up. For a date.&rdquo;</p><p>James looked as if he was going into cardiac arrest.</p><p>He dragged Sirius and Peter away to chat in a more secluded area.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyways, Lily, are you up to having a drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of you grab a bottle of butterbeer and start pouring it into some clean cups all stacked. &ldquo;Wait! Let&rsquo;s add a little bit of this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You add a bit of firewhiskey to the drink.</p><p>&ldquo;It might taste disgusting&hellip; But it&rsquo;s worth it!&rdquo; You exclaim.</p><p>Lily&rsquo;s eyebrows shoot up and almost disappear into her hairline. She raises her cup nonetheless, proclaiming a toast between the two of you. &ldquo;To getting Y/N to feel better. And weird concoctions.&rdquo;</p><p>You clink your glasses together and cheer. Downing the drink in one go, you see a boy from the corner of your eye staring at you.</p><p>Many thoughts run through your mind. With the flashing lights, the dimness of the room and everyone&rsquo;s faces, the firewhiskey starts getting into your system.</p><p>Finishing the drink, you place the glass on the closest table. &ldquo;Lils, do you think that guy is checking me out? Or is he staring at someone behind us?&rdquo;</p><p>Lily discretely turned her head towards the direction you were looking. &ldquo;Nick? The one with the dark blue jacket and white shirt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>You take a quick peek at him again and see him still looking at you. Flushing, you grab Lily&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Back me up, wingwoman!&rdquo;</p><p>The both of you turn and pretend to be talking in a deep conversation. &ldquo;Well, is he coming over here?!&rdquo; You ask frantically, seeing Lily&rsquo;s eyes drift over your shoulder.</p><p>Lily nods as if she&rsquo;s casually talking to you, squeezing your arm. &ldquo;Good luck with this guy. Please, try not to break your heart, okay? I&rsquo;m serious.&rdquo;</p><p>You nod enthusiastically, your body moving to its own accord but your heart wrenching at the thought of another one nighter.</p><p>As Lily stepped away from you and headed for the Marauders, you reviewed your options. If Nick was really going for you, would you stay with him for the night, only to get your heart broken again? Or would you finally wisen up and face your feelings and say no?</p><p>However, you didn&rsquo;t know of his personality too much, so maybe starting a relationship wouldn&rsquo;t be the worst idea&hellip;</p><p>The thought of being in a committed relationship made you internally claw at your heart. It&rsquo;s not that you didn&rsquo;t want a long-term relationship, it&rsquo;s the fact that you knew your insecurities were in the way.</p><p>Biting your lip, you make for the bottle of firewhiskey but stop as someone else snatches it. &ldquo;Let me pour it.&rdquo;</p><p>Looking up shocked, you see Nick. Blushing, you hold out your cup, observing Nick&rsquo;s face as he concentrates on your drink. When he finishes pouring, he starts to make small talk. You&rsquo;re only half concentrated as you nod and reply short answers to him, making eye contact every now and then.</p><p>Suddenly, he&rsquo;s grabbing your hand and pulling you up towards the dorms. You don&rsquo;t hesitate, but deep inside you half wish you were with Lily and the gang rather than having another one night stand.</p><p>From the corner of your eye, you see the marauders. Other than Lily, one face sticks out in particular. You see Sirius Black&rsquo;s face, carefully devoid of emotions yet carelessly watching your every move.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know whether it was your disgust of having another one night stand and finally owning your feelings, or because it was almost like Sirius Black was screaming at you to not go with Nick- but you let go of Nick&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Confused, he looks back. &ldquo;What are you doing? I thought you wanted to&hellip;?&rdquo; Nick questioned, reaching to grab your hand again.</p><p>&ldquo;I changed my mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nicholas Walsh. Why would you change your mind about ME?&rdquo;</p><p>Frowning in disdain, you reply with as much disgust in your voice as possible. &ldquo;Because I just do? Goodbye-&rdquo;</p><p>Before you could escape what would have been another horrible hook-up, you feel a tight grip on your wrist, pulling you back towards Nick. Shocked, you freeze up, not knowing what to do.</p><p>While it&rsquo;s obvious you need to pull away and flee, you can&rsquo;t help but stare at Nick, fearful of what&rsquo;s to come. The next few moments happened very quickly.</p><p>You were pulled away from Nicholas, and suddenly facing someone&rsquo;s back. Returning to your senses, you look up, realizing it&rsquo;s none other than Sirius Black.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better back off, <i>Walsh</i>. No means no,&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>&ldquo;She only said, 'I changed my mind&rsquo;, not 'no&rsquo;,&rdquo; Nick spat.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a <i>huge</i> difference, you bloody <i>idiot</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>Normally, you&rsquo;d have stopped the little spat, but you couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Sirius in a new light. Not only had he saved and defended you from Nick, but he also showed a maturity that you didn&rsquo;t really think he would have.</p><p>Obviously, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p><p>The firewhiskey (mixed with a few other things) had also slowed your thought process, rendering you silent.</p><p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much difference to me, though,&rdquo; Nick replied, smug and smirking, standing 'all holy&rsquo;.</p><p>Before anyone could make a move, you walked up to him from behind Sirius&rsquo;s protective stance and slapped him.</p><p>The party had already gone rather quiet, everyone tuning into Sirius and Nick arguing. However, now even the quietened music stopped completely and literally <i>everyone</i> was watching.</p><p>You felt your face hot all over from the attention, as well as rage.</p><p>&ldquo;From someone who comes from a pureblood, all English family, you certainly lack the understanding of some of the most basic English words,&rdquo; you spat. &ldquo;Screw you.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, you speed past everyone, rushing out of the Gryffindor common room, running towards the Ravenclaw tower.</p><p>Your eyes started to prickle with tears, but you harshly rubbed at them, refusing to cry until you were alone. You didn&rsquo;t bother checking for Filch; nor any other staff for the matter.</p><p>All that mattered was that you got back to your private dorm to have a breakdown in peace.</p><p>As soon as you reached the entrance, you were listening in on the riddle, only to lose track of your thoughts as a voice called out from behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, L/N! Wait!&rdquo;</p><p>Of course. Sirius Black. Rolling your eyes but begrudgingly turning to him, you sigh. &ldquo;Sorry for running out. I should have thanked you before running away to go cry somewhere else where I wouldn&rsquo;t lose <i>all</i> my dignity,&rdquo; you chuckled.</p><p>Sirius winced a bit, knowing there was no humour in your statement whatsoever.</p><p>Maybe it was the alcohol (actually, it probably isn&rsquo;t)- but your heart rate sped up. You realized how close you were to Sirius and how alone you both currently were. With newfound braveness, you observed him. How black but soft looking his hair was, how his eyes showed so much concern. It didn&rsquo;t help that he was breathtakingly gorgeous.</p><p>&ldquo;I only wanted to check on you. Gotta make sure you&rsquo;re not getting ready to murder Nicholas. Wouldn&rsquo;t be a big loss, but I can&rsquo;t have such a pretty face rot away in Azkaban so quickly,&rdquo; he teased, his usually playful manner coming back out.</p><p>Even though you tried your hardest to suppress a big grin, it broke out anyway, along with a small laugh. It was beginning to feel like the horrible incident with Nick happened ages ago as if Sirius had the ability to make you feel better quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;There I was, about to be taken advantage of and here you are still cracking jokes,&rdquo; you joke. However, it seemed that Sirius was genuinely worried.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding. I have dark humour sometimes,&rdquo; you grin.</p><p>Before Sirius could reply, another voice spoke out, echoing in the hallway. &ldquo;Y/N/N! Thank Merlin I caught you. We need to go into your common room, I \u00a0saw Professor Snape wondering around nearby. That&rsquo;s why I took so long to get here, sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Lily was panting, tying up her hair when Sirius spoke. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Remus, James and Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told them to wait and deal with Nick,&rdquo; she frowned. &ldquo;I hope James hexes the shit out of Nick, <i>honestly</i>. What an arse.&rdquo;</p><p>You and Sirius both look at each other, eyebrows raised. Lily seemed to have gained another personality, much fiercer than her red hair.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright then. Now both of you shush so I can concentrate on finding an answer to the riddle.&rdquo;</p><p>'When will water stop running down a hill?&rsquo; The eagle knocker speaks out.</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of riddle is this? When it reaches the bottom,&rdquo; you reply, disappointed at the easiness but grateful for being able to leave the corridor quickly.</p><p>'It&rsquo;s a very simple one. I&rsquo;m quite tired and students like you poking around late disturb me. The quicker you work out the riddle, the quicker I can get back to my rest,&rsquo; the eagle spoke, a hint of annoyance in their voice.</p><p>Chuckling, you step in. &ldquo;Have a good night,&rdquo; you say as you close the door after Sirius and Lily.</p><p>As soon as you all reach your private dorm, you collapse onto the bed, Sirius and Lily both sitting at the foot of your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; Y/N. Are you feeling any better?&rdquo; Lily asked, with concern etched onto her face.</p><p>&ldquo;I am, actually. Believe it or not, but Sirius actually helped. Even though you are extremely annoying, Black, you&rsquo;re pretty damn helpful and hilarious too.&rdquo;</p><p>Sirius grinned wolfishly, indicating that he was about to say something very smug. It surprised you how well you knew him, even though you hung out more with just Remus and Lily.</p><p>&ldquo;Glad to know I&rsquo;m of help,&rdquo; he started. &ldquo;It was nothing, defending you from Nick, my dear.&rdquo; He smiled cheekily, knowing you 'hated&rsquo; being called 'my dear&rsquo;, especially since you both weren&rsquo;t really relationship people yourselves.</p><p>Deep down, however, you knew you loved the attention from Sirius.</p><p>Blushing, you were thinking of a witty response, but to your luck, Lily noticed how you were struggling.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re fine now, Y/N, which you are, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Lily began. &ldquo;-Then maybe you could join Sirius and I as we go check on the rest? Which unfortunately includes Nick. Unless you want to stay and have alone time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just stay, yeah. I don&rsquo;t want everyone to try whisper to each other about me while I&rsquo;m there. I&rsquo;ll just give them the satisfaction of free gossip. I&rsquo;ll help you get out, though. I don&rsquo;t like pestering the poor eagle too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you implying that we aren&rsquo;t as smart as you, dear?&rdquo; Sirius quipped.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. Well, maybe just you, Black.&rdquo;</p><p>You all got off your bed chuckling, heading for the common room. As soon as you reach the entrance, you turn to them.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, guys. Really. Go have fun. Murder Nick for me.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as you answer the riddle quickly, you wave them off and quietly shut the door. Slumping towards your room, you lie down and attempt to rest; trying not to think of Nicholas Walsh.</p><p>Despite the countless attempts, you still didn&rsquo;t want to give into your thoughts. You really felt that it was all your fault; you wanted to go out and party (which meant hook-up, feel disappointed in the end) and continue your self-destructive cycle.</p><p>You had also dragged Lily right back into it and had given Sirius a peek at what you were really like.</p><p>However, you did get to hang out with Sirius a bit more. And while the thought made you very giddy, a little voice also said that you were too insecure and would only pull Sirius back from his own happiness.</p><p>As the night went on, you slowly gave in to sleep, letting your eyelids close and your thoughts flow into your dreams.</p>",

Why don\u2019t you see what we see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not true! It\u2019s not bloody true, Lily! Can\u2019t you accept the fact that I\u2019m ugly and horrible and no one will ever look at me the way they look at you?!\u201d</p><p>Lily had come closer to your slightly trembling figure. \u201cIs this what your self-loathing is about this time?\u201d She asked softly.</p><p>You nod your head. Sometimes you got like this- it was a cycle. First was self-hate. Next was comforting from close friends. Next came parties, hooking up, leaving quickly the next morning and trying not to fall in love. And then, self-hate came again straight after you looked back at what you did.</p><p>It was easy to say that your coping mechanisms were shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m so sorry Lily! I have this constant, like, despair cycle and I-I\u2019ve gotten you heavily involved!\u201d</p><p>She took a seat on your bed and sighed. \u201cY/N, you haven\u2019t dragged me into your \u2018despair cycle\u2019, I\u2019ve let myself be involved because I want to help you. I know that you\u2019ve gone through this a lot, but I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll ALWAYS be here because I care. You\u2019re one of my best friends. I will not leave your side until you\u2019ve gotten better. Now, how can I cheer you up?\u201d</p><p>You glanced at Lily who was sitting there patiently, her red hair ablaze with the glow of the sunset. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m like this, Lils. I\u2019ll cheer myself up- I heard there was a party in the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Y/N, I won\u2019t let you break your own heart at a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I <i>want</i> to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it actually benefit <i>healthily</i> you this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I promise.\u201d</p><p>You watched as Lily heaved a big sigh, rubbing at her temples. \u201cAlright, this is the <i>absolute</i> last time. If I don\u2019t see any self-improvement, I will officially be taking away your party privileges.\u201d</p><p>A big smile breaks through your lips as you sit down by Lily as squash her in a hug. \u201cThanks, Lils.\u201d</p><p>After a few more hours hanging out together, you both started getting ready.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look, Lily?\u201d You twirl around in a dark blue dress, letting Lily see your whole outfit. The two of you were trying on multiple different outfits in your dorm for the party in the Gryffindor common room.</p><p>\u201cAs always, you look good. Shall we, my lady?\u201d Lily offers, holding her arm up towards you.</p><p>\u201cWe shall.\u201d</p><p>You link her arm in yours look at her outfit, consisting of flattering jeans and a nice fitting lace long sleeve. Your heart falls at the thought that even though she was dressed more casually than you, she still looked better.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>You look up to see Lily\u2019s green eyes staring into yours. \u201cYep! I\u2019m fine. Totally cool. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>You were not fine. An invisible force was tugging you, and you were tugging Lily. You WANTED to go to this party to forget everything, but at the same time, you dreaded the thought of seeing everyone all over again.</p><p>With your mind lost in a never-ending train of thought, you halt just in front of the Gryffindor common room portrait entrance.</p><p>\u201cOh! I almost forgot there was a password. <i>Flitterbloom</i>.\u201d</p><p>The portrait of the fat lady swung open towards you as you and Lily climbed through the opening.</p><p>There was already mildly loud music, dim lighting and trays everywhere floating themselves around, carrying either butterbeer, firewhiskey or muggle alcohol. Possibly even mixed drinks.</p><p>Almost immediately, the marauders were by your side. \u201cY/N! Lily! Glad you two could make it. Remus isn\u2019t going to be here yet, though. He\u2019s going to 'pack in a bit of studying\u2019 before relaxing down here. Now, have a drink or two!\u201d Sirius was already chatting and attempting to coax the two of you into drinks and drunkness.</p><p>Before you were about to drag Lily away, James Potter came into the scene. \u201cEvans! Great to see you! You look lovely as ever. Did I mention how every time I look into your eyes I get lost?\u201d</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes at the pathetic pickup line from James. \u201cPotter, you\u2019ve had better pickup lines. Maybe if you up your game a lot more, I\u2019ll let you <i>actually</i> pick me up. For a date.\u201d</p><p>James looked as if he was going into cardiac arrest.</p><p>He dragged Sirius and Peter away to chat in a more secluded area.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, Lily, are you up to having a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>The two of you grab a bottle of butterbeer and start pouring it into some clean cups all stacked. \u201cWait! Let\u2019s add a little bit of this\u2026\u201d</p><p>You add a bit of firewhiskey to the drink.</p><p>\u201cIt might taste disgusting\u2026 But it\u2019s worth it!\u201d You exclaim.</p><p>Lily\u2019s eyebrows shoot up and almost disappear into her hairline. She raises her cup nonetheless, proclaiming a toast between the two of you. \u201cTo getting Y/N to feel better. And weird concoctions.\u201d</p><p>You clink your glasses together and cheer. Downing the drink in one go, you see a boy from the corner of your eye staring at you.</p><p>Many thoughts run through your mind. With the flashing lights, the dimness of the room and everyone\u2019s faces, the firewhiskey starts getting into your system.</p><p>Finishing the drink, you place the glass on the closest table. \u201cLils, do you think that guy is checking me out? Or is he staring at someone behind us?\u201d</p><p>Lily discretely turned her head towards the direction you were looking. \u201cNick? The one with the dark blue jacket and white shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>You take a quick peek at him again and see him still looking at you. Flushing, you grab Lily\u2019s hand. \u201cBack me up, wingwoman!\u201d</p><p>The both of you turn and pretend to be talking in a deep conversation. \u201cWell, is he coming over here?!\u201d You ask frantically, seeing Lily\u2019s eyes drift over your shoulder.</p><p>Lily nods as if she\u2019s casually talking to you, squeezing your arm. \u201cGood luck with this guy. Please, try not to break your heart, okay? I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>You nod enthusiastically, your body moving to its own accord but your heart wrenching at the thought of another one nighter.</p><p>As Lily stepped away from you and headed for the Marauders, you reviewed your options. If Nick was really going for you, would you stay with him for the night, only to get your heart broken again? Or would you finally wisen up and face your feelings and say no?</p><p>However, you didn\u2019t know of his personality too much, so maybe starting a relationship wouldn\u2019t be the worst idea\u2026</p><p>The thought of being in a committed relationship made you internally claw at your heart. It\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t want a long-term relationship, it\u2019s the fact that you knew your insecurities were in the way.</p><p>Biting your lip, you make for the bottle of firewhiskey but stop as someone else snatches it. \u201cLet me pour it.\u201d</p><p>Looking up shocked, you see Nick. Blushing, you hold out your cup, observing Nick\u2019s face as he concentrates on your drink. When he finishes pouring, he starts to make small talk. You\u2019re only half concentrated as you nod and reply short answers to him, making eye contact every now and then.</p><p>Suddenly, he\u2019s grabbing your hand and pulling you up towards the dorms. You don\u2019t hesitate, but deep inside you half wish you were with Lily and the gang rather than having another one night stand.</p><p>From the corner of your eye, you see the marauders. Other than Lily, one face sticks out in particular. You see Sirius Black\u2019s face, carefully devoid of emotions yet carelessly watching your every move.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know whether it was your disgust of having another one night stand and finally owning your feelings, or because it was almost like Sirius Black was screaming at you to not go with Nick- but you let go of Nick\u2019s hand.</p><p>Confused, he looks back. \u201cWhat are you doing? I thought you wanted to\u2026?\u201d Nick questioned, reaching to grab your hand again.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nicholas Walsh. Why would you change your mind about ME?\u201d</p><p>Frowning in disdain, you reply with as much disgust in your voice as possible. \u201cBecause I just do? Goodbye-\u201d</p><p>Before you could escape what would have been another horrible hook-up, you feel a tight grip on your wrist, pulling you back towards Nick. Shocked, you freeze up, not knowing what to do.</p><p>While it\u2019s obvious you need to pull away and flee, you can\u2019t help but stare at Nick, fearful of what\u2019s to come. The next few moments happened very quickly.</p><p>You were pulled away from Nicholas, and suddenly facing someone\u2019s back. Returning to your senses, you look up, realizing it\u2019s none other than Sirius Black.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better back off, <i>Walsh</i>. No means no,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cShe only said, 'I changed my mind\u2019, not 'no\u2019,\u201d Nick spat.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a <i>huge</i> difference, you bloody <i>idiot</i>!\u201d</p><p>Normally, you\u2019d have stopped the little spat, but you couldn\u2019t help but look at Sirius in a new light. Not only had he saved and defended you from Nick, but he also showed a maturity that you didn\u2019t really think he would have.</p><p>Obviously, you\u2019re wrong.</p><p>The firewhiskey (mixed with a few other things) had also slowed your thought process, rendering you silent.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much difference to me, though,\u201d Nick replied, smug and smirking, standing 'all holy\u2019.</p><p>Before anyone could make a move, you walked up to him from behind Sirius\u2019s protective stance and slapped him.</p><p>The party had already gone rather quiet, everyone tuning into Sirius and Nick arguing. However, now even the quietened music stopped completely and literally <i>everyone</i> was watching.</p><p>You felt your face hot all over from the attention, as well as rage.</p><p>\u201cFrom someone who comes from a pureblood, all English family, you certainly lack the understanding of some of the most basic English words,\u201d you spat. \u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>With that, you speed past everyone, rushing out of the Gryffindor common room, running towards the Ravenclaw tower.</p><p>Your eyes started to prickle with tears, but you harshly rubbed at them, refusing to cry until you were alone. You didn\u2019t bother checking for Filch; nor any other staff for the matter.</p><p>All that mattered was that you got back to your private dorm to have a breakdown in peace.</p><p>As soon as you reached the entrance, you were listening in on the riddle, only to lose track of your thoughts as a voice called out from behind.</p><p>\u201cHey, L/N! Wait!\u201d</p><p>Of course. Sirius Black. Rolling your eyes but begrudgingly turning to him, you sigh. \u201cSorry for running out. I should have thanked you before running away to go cry somewhere else where I wouldn\u2019t lose <i>all</i> my dignity,\u201d you chuckled.</p><p>Sirius winced a bit, knowing there was no humour in your statement whatsoever.</p><p>Maybe it was the alcohol (actually, it probably isn\u2019t)- but your heart rate sped up. You realized how close you were to Sirius and how alone you both currently were. With newfound braveness, you observed him. How black but soft looking his hair was, how his eyes showed so much concern. It didn\u2019t help that he was breathtakingly gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cI only wanted to check on you. Gotta make sure you\u2019re not getting ready to murder Nicholas. Wouldn\u2019t be a big loss, but I can\u2019t have such a pretty face rot away in Azkaban so quickly,\u201d he teased, his usually playful manner coming back out.</p><p>Even though you tried your hardest to suppress a big grin, it broke out anyway, along with a small laugh. It was beginning to feel like the horrible incident with Nick happened ages ago as if Sirius had the ability to make you feel better quickly.</p><p>\u201cThere I was, about to be taken advantage of and here you are still cracking jokes,\u201d you joke. However, it seemed that Sirius was genuinely worried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding. I have dark humour sometimes,\u201d you grin.</p><p>Before Sirius could reply, another voice spoke out, echoing in the hallway. \u201cY/N/N! Thank Merlin I caught you. We need to go into your common room, I \u00a0saw Professor Snape wondering around nearby. That\u2019s why I took so long to get here, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lily was panting, tying up her hair when Sirius spoke. \u201cWhere\u2019s Remus, James and Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them to wait and deal with Nick,\u201d she frowned. \u201cI hope James hexes the shit out of Nick, <i>honestly</i>. What an arse.\u201d</p><p>You and Sirius both look at each other, eyebrows raised. Lily seemed to have gained another personality, much fiercer than her red hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright then. Now both of you shush so I can concentrate on finding an answer to the riddle.\u201d</p><p>'When will water stop running down a hill?\u2019 The eagle knocker speaks out.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of riddle is this? When it reaches the bottom,\u201d you reply, disappointed at the easiness but grateful for being able to leave the corridor quickly.</p><p>'It\u2019s a very simple one. I\u2019m quite tired and students like you poking around late disturb me. The quicker you work out the riddle, the quicker I can get back to my rest,\u2019 the eagle spoke, a hint of annoyance in their voice.</p><p>Chuckling, you step in. \u201cHave a good night,\u201d you say as you close the door after Sirius and Lily.</p><p>As soon as you all reach your private dorm, you collapse onto the bed, Sirius and Lily both sitting at the foot of your bed.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 Y/N. Are you feeling any better?\u201d Lily asked, with concern etched onto her face.</p><p>\u201cI am, actually. Believe it or not, but Sirius actually helped. Even though you are extremely annoying, Black, you\u2019re pretty damn helpful and hilarious too.\u201d</p><p>Sirius grinned wolfishly, indicating that he was about to say something very smug. It surprised you how well you knew him, even though you hung out more with just Remus and Lily.</p><p>\u201cGlad to know I\u2019m of help,\u201d he started. \u201cIt was nothing, defending you from Nick, my dear.\u201d He smiled cheekily, knowing you 'hated\u2019 being called 'my dear\u2019, especially since you both weren\u2019t really relationship people yourselves.</p><p>Deep down, however, you knew you loved the attention from Sirius.</p><p>Blushing, you were thinking of a witty response, but to your luck, Lily noticed how you were struggling.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re fine now, Y/N, which you are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Lily began. \u201c-Then maybe you could join Sirius and I as we go check on the rest? Which unfortunately includes Nick. Unless you want to stay and have alone time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just stay, yeah. I don\u2019t want everyone to try whisper to each other about me while I\u2019m there. I\u2019ll just give them the satisfaction of free gossip. I\u2019ll help you get out, though. I don\u2019t like pestering the poor eagle too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that we aren\u2019t as smart as you, dear?\u201d Sirius quipped.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Well, maybe just you, Black.\u201d</p><p>You all got off your bed chuckling, heading for the common room. As soon as you reach the entrance, you turn to them.</p><p>\u201cThanks, guys. Really. Go have fun. Murder Nick for me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as you answer the riddle quickly, you wave them off and quietly shut the door. Slumping towards your room, you lie down and attempt to rest; trying not to think of Nicholas Walsh.</p><p>Despite the countless attempts, you still didn\u2019t want to give into your thoughts. You really felt that it was all your fault; you wanted to go out and party (which meant hook-up, feel disappointed in the end) and continue your self-destructive cycle.</p><p>You had also dragged Lily right back into it and had given Sirius a peek at what you were really like.</p><p>However, you did get to hang out with Sirius a bit more. And while the thought made you very giddy, a little voice also said that you were too insecure and would only pull Sirius back from his own happiness.</p><p>As the night went on, you slowly gave in to sleep, letting your eyelids close and your thoughts flow into your dreams.</p>",

All your friends always argued against your view, saying how you were much better than you thought to be.</p><p>Thankful for your separate room- (being a prefect had its perks)- you kept turning and staring and thinking about your horridness.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know that Lily was about to burst in and save you from your self-loathing mind, so you continued to look at yourself in disgust.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Do you wanna- Y/N? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Lily Evans stood in your doorway, looking saddened at you standing in front of your mirror, you looking disgusted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m just looking at how much I dislike our uniforms\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days ago you were discussing how much you liked these uniforms compared to your muggle friends\u2019 ones at their high school. I\u2019m not foolish, Y/N. I know what you\u2019re doing and thinking, and I want you to know a lot of us are here for you, as well as the fact that you\u2019re drop dead <i>gorgeous</i>. Why don\u2019t you see what we see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not true! It\u2019s not bloody true, Lily! Can\u2019t you accept the fact that I\u2019m ugly and horrible and no one will ever look at me the way they look at you?!\u201d</p><p>Lily had come closer to your slightly trembling figure. \u201cIs this what your self-loathing is about this time?\u201d She asked softly.</p><p>You nod your head. Sometimes you got like this- it was a cycle. First was self-hate. Next was comforting from close friends. Next came parties, hooking up, leaving quickly the next morning and trying not to fall in love. And then, self-hate came again straight after you looked back at what you did.</p><p>It was easy to say that your coping mechanisms were shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m so sorry Lily! I have this constant, like, despair cycle and I-I\u2019ve gotten you heavily involved!\u201d</p><p>She took a seat on your bed and sighed. \u201cY/N, you haven\u2019t dragged me into your \u2018despair cycle\u2019, I\u2019ve let myself be involved because I want to help you. I know that you\u2019ve gone through this a lot, but I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll ALWAYS be here because I care. You\u2019re one of my best friends. I will not leave your side until you\u2019ve gotten better. Now, how can I cheer you up?\u201d</p><p>You glanced at Lily who was sitting there patiently, her red hair ablaze with the glow of the sunset. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m like this, Lils. I\u2019ll cheer myself up- I heard there was a party in the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Y/N, I won\u2019t let you break your own heart at a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I <i>want</i> to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it actually benefit <i>healthily</i> you this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I promise.\u201d</p><p>You watched as Lily heaved a big sigh, rubbing at her temples. \u201cAlright, this is the <i>absolute</i> last time. If I don\u2019t see any self-improvement, I will officially be taking away your party privileges.\u201d</p><p>A big smile breaks through your lips as you sit down by Lily as squash her in a hug. \u201cThanks, Lils.\u201d</p><p>After a few more hours hanging out together, you both started getting ready.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look, Lily?\u201d You twirl around in a dark blue dress, letting Lily see your whole outfit. The two of you were trying on multiple different outfits in your dorm for the party in the Gryffindor common room.</p><p>\u201cAs always, you look good. Shall we, my lady?\u201d Lily offers, holding her arm up towards you.</p><p>\u201cWe shall.\u201d</p><p>You link her arm in yours look at her outfit, consisting of flattering jeans and a nice fitting lace long sleeve. Your heart falls at the thought that even though she was dressed more casually than you, she still looked better.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>You look up to see Lily\u2019s green eyes staring into yours. \u201cYep! I\u2019m fine. Totally cool. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>You were not fine. An invisible force was tugging you, and you were tugging Lily. You WANTED to go to this party to forget everything, but at the same time, you dreaded the thought of seeing everyone all over again.</p><p>With your mind lost in a never-ending train of thought, you halt just in front of the Gryffindor common room portrait entrance.</p><p>\u201cOh! I almost forgot there was a password. <i>Flitterbloom</i>.\u201d</p><p>The portrait of the fat lady swung open towards you as you and Lily climbed through the opening.</p><p>There was already mildly loud music, dim lighting and trays everywhere floating themselves around, carrying either butterbeer, firewhiskey or muggle alcohol. Possibly even mixed drinks.</p><p>Almost immediately, the marauders were by your side. \u201cY/N! Lily! Glad you two could make it. Remus isn\u2019t going to be here yet, though. He\u2019s going to 'pack in a bit of studying\u2019 before relaxing down here. Now, have a drink or two!\u201d Sirius was already chatting and attempting to coax the two of you into drinks and drunkness.</p><p>Before you were about to drag Lily away, James Potter came into the scene. \u201cEvans! Great to see you! You look lovely as ever. Did I mention how every time I look into your eyes I get lost?\u201d</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes at the pathetic pickup line from James. \u201cPotter, you\u2019ve had better pickup lines. Maybe if you up your game a lot more, I\u2019ll let you <i>actually</i> pick me up. For a date.\u201d</p><p>James looked as if he was going into cardiac arrest.</p><p>He dragged Sirius and Peter away to chat in a more secluded area.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, Lily, are you up to having a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>The two of you grab a bottle of butterbeer and start pouring it into some clean cups all stacked. \u201cWait! Let\u2019s add a little bit of this\u2026\u201d</p><p>You add a bit of firewhiskey to the drink.</p><p>\u201cIt might taste disgusting\u2026 But it\u2019s worth it!\u201d You exclaim.</p><p>Lily\u2019s eyebrows shoot up and almost disappear into her hairline. She raises her cup nonetheless, proclaiming a toast between the two of you. \u201cTo getting Y/N to feel better. And weird concoctions.\u201d</p><p>You clink your glasses together and cheer. Downing the drink in one go, you see a boy from the corner of your eye staring at you.</p><p>Many thoughts run through your mind. With the flashing lights, the dimness of the room and everyone\u2019s faces, the firewhiskey starts getting into your system.</p><p>Finishing the drink, you place the glass on the closest table. \u201cLils, do you think that guy is checking me out? Or is he staring at someone behind us?\u201d</p><p>Lily discretely turned her head towards the direction you were looking. \u201cNick? The one with the dark blue jacket and white shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>You take a quick peek at him again and see him still looking at you. Flushing, you grab Lily\u2019s hand. \u201cBack me up, wingwoman!\u201d</p><p>The both of you turn and pretend to be talking in a deep conversation. \u201cWell, is he coming over here?!\u201d You ask frantically, seeing Lily\u2019s eyes drift over your shoulder.</p><p>Lily nods as if she\u2019s casually talking to you, squeezing your arm. \u201cGood luck with this guy. Please, try not to break your heart, okay? I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>You nod enthusiastically, your body moving to its own accord but your heart wrenching at the thought of another one nighter.</p><p>As Lily stepped away from you and headed for the Marauders, you reviewed your options. If Nick was really going for you, would you stay with him for the night, only to get your heart broken again? Or would you finally wisen up and face your feelings and say no?</p><p>However, you didn\u2019t know of his personality too much, so maybe starting a relationship wouldn\u2019t be the worst idea\u2026</p><p>The thought of being in a committed relationship made you internally claw at your heart. It\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t want a long-term relationship, it\u2019s the fact that you knew your insecurities were in the way.</p><p>Biting your lip, you make for the bottle of firewhiskey but stop as someone else snatches it. \u201cLet me pour it.\u201d</p><p>Looking up shocked, you see Nick. Blushing, you hold out your cup, observing Nick\u2019s face as he concentrates on your drink. When he finishes pouring, he starts to make small talk. You\u2019re only half concentrated as you nod and reply short answers to him, making eye contact every now and then.</p><p>Suddenly, he\u2019s grabbing your hand and pulling you up towards the dorms. You don\u2019t hesitate, but deep inside you half wish you were with Lily and the gang rather than having another one night stand.</p><p>From the corner of your eye, you see the marauders. Other than Lily, one face sticks out in particular. You see Sirius Black\u2019s face, carefully devoid of emotions yet carelessly watching your every move.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know whether it was your disgust of having another one night stand and finally owning your feelings, or because it was almost like Sirius Black was screaming at you to not go with Nick- but you let go of Nick\u2019s hand.</p><p>Confused, he looks back. \u201cWhat are you doing? I thought you wanted to\u2026?\u201d Nick questioned, reaching to grab your hand again.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nicholas Walsh. Why would you change your mind about ME?\u201d</p><p>Frowning in disdain, you reply with as much disgust in your voice as possible. \u201cBecause I just do? Goodbye-\u201d</p><p>Before you could escape what would have been another horrible hook-up, you feel a tight grip on your wrist, pulling you back towards Nick. Shocked, you freeze up, not knowing what to do.</p><p>While it\u2019s obvious you need to pull away and flee, you can\u2019t help but stare at Nick, fearful of what\u2019s to come. The next few moments happened very quickly.</p><p>You were pulled away from Nicholas, and suddenly facing someone\u2019s back. Returning to your senses, you look up, realizing it\u2019s none other than Sirius Black.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better back off, <i>Walsh</i>. No means no,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cShe only said, 'I changed my mind\u2019, not 'no\u2019,\u201d Nick spat.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a <i>huge</i> difference, you bloody <i>idiot</i>!\u201d</p><p>Normally, you\u2019d have stopped the little spat, but you couldn\u2019t help but look at Sirius in a new light. Not only had he saved and defended you from Nick, but he also showed a maturity that you didn\u2019t really think he would have.</p><p>Obviously, you\u2019re wrong.</p><p>The firewhiskey (mixed with a few other things) had also slowed your thought process, rendering you silent.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much difference to me, though,\u201d Nick replied, smug and smirking, standing 'all holy\u2019.</p><p>Before anyone could make a move, you walked up to him from behind Sirius\u2019s protective stance and slapped him.</p><p>The party had already gone rather quiet, everyone tuning into Sirius and Nick arguing. However, now even the quietened music stopped completely and literally <i>everyone</i> was watching.</p><p>You felt your face hot all over from the attention, as well as rage.</p><p>\u201cFrom someone who comes from a pureblood, all English family, you certainly lack the understanding of some of the most basic English words,\u201d you spat. \u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>With that, you speed past everyone, rushing out of the Gryffindor common room, running towards the Ravenclaw tower.</p><p>Your eyes started to prickle with tears, but you harshly rubbed at them, refusing to cry until you were alone. You didn\u2019t bother checking for Filch; nor any other staff for the matter.</p><p>All that mattered was that you got back to your private dorm to have a breakdown in peace.</p><p>As soon as you reached the entrance, you were listening in on the riddle, only to lose track of your thoughts as a voice called out from behind.</p><p>\u201cHey, L/N! Wait!\u201d</p><p>Of course. Sirius Black. Rolling your eyes but begrudgingly turning to him, you sigh. \u201cSorry for running out. I should have thanked you before running away to go cry somewhere else where I wouldn\u2019t lose <i>all</i> my dignity,\u201d you chuckled.</p><p>Sirius winced a bit, knowing there was no humour in your statement whatsoever.</p><p>Maybe it was the alcohol (actually, it probably isn\u2019t)- but your heart rate sped up. You realized how close you were to Sirius and how alone you both currently were. With newfound braveness, you observed him. How black but soft looking his hair was, how his eyes showed so much concern. It didn\u2019t help that he was breathtakingly gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cI only wanted to check on you. Gotta make sure you\u2019re not getting ready to murder Nicholas. Wouldn\u2019t be a big loss, but I can\u2019t have such a pretty face rot away in Azkaban so quickly,\u201d he teased, his usually playful manner coming back out.</p><p>Even though you tried your hardest to suppress a big grin, it broke out anyway, along with a small laugh. It was beginning to feel like the horrible incident with Nick happened ages ago as if Sirius had the ability to make you feel better quickly.</p><p>\u201cThere I was, about to be taken advantage of and here you are still cracking jokes,\u201d you joke. However, it seemed that Sirius was genuinely worried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding. I have dark humour sometimes,\u201d you grin.</p><p>Before Sirius could reply, another voice spoke out, echoing in the hallway. \u201cY/N/N! Thank Merlin I caught you. We need to go into your common room, I \u00a0saw Professor Snape wondering around nearby. That\u2019s why I took so long to get here, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lily was panting, tying up her hair when Sirius spoke. \u201cWhere\u2019s Remus, James and Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them to wait and deal with Nick,\u201d she frowned. \u201cI hope James hexes the shit out of Nick, <i>honestly</i>. What an arse.\u201d</p><p>You and Sirius both look at each other, eyebrows raised. Lily seemed to have gained another personality, much fiercer than her red hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright then. Now both of you shush so I can concentrate on finding an answer to the riddle.\u201d</p><p>'When will water stop running down a hill?\u2019 The eagle knocker speaks out.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of riddle is this? When it reaches the bottom,\u201d you reply, disappointed at the easiness but grateful for being able to leave the corridor quickly.</p><p>'It\u2019s a very simple one. I\u2019m quite tired and students like you poking around late disturb me. The quicker you work out the riddle, the quicker I can get back to my rest,\u2019 the eagle spoke, a hint of annoyance in their voice.</p><p>Chuckling, you step in. \u201cHave a good night,\u201d you say as you close the door after Sirius and Lily.</p><p>As soon as you all reach your private dorm, you collapse onto the bed, Sirius and Lily both sitting at the foot of your bed.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 Y/N. Are you feeling any better?\u201d Lily asked, with concern etched onto her face.</p><p>\u201cI am, actually. Believe it or not, but Sirius actually helped. Even though you are extremely annoying, Black, you\u2019re pretty damn helpful and hilarious too.\u201d</p><p>Sirius grinned wolfishly, indicating that he was about to say something very smug. It surprised you how well you knew him, even though you hung out more with just Remus and Lily.</p><p>\u201cGlad to know I\u2019m of help,\u201d he started. \u201cIt was nothing, defending you from Nick, my dear.\u201d He smiled cheekily, knowing you 'hated\u2019 being called 'my dear\u2019, especially since you both weren\u2019t really relationship people yourselves.</p><p>Deep down, however, you knew you loved the attention from Sirius.</p><p>Blushing, you were thinking of a witty response, but to your luck, Lily noticed how you were struggling.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re fine now, Y/N, which you are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Lily began. \u201c-Then maybe you could join Sirius and I as we go check on the rest? Which unfortunately includes Nick. Unless you want to stay and have alone time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just stay, yeah. I don\u2019t want everyone to try whisper to each other about me while I\u2019m there. I\u2019ll just give them the satisfaction of free gossip. I\u2019ll help you get out, though. I don\u2019t like pestering the poor eagle too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that we aren\u2019t as smart as you, dear?\u201d Sirius quipped.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Well, maybe just you, Black.\u201d</p><p>You all got off your bed chuckling, heading for the common room. As soon as you reach the entrance, you turn to them.</p><p>\u201cThanks, guys. Really. Go have fun. Murder Nick for me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as you answer the riddle quickly, you wave them off and quietly shut the door. Slumping towards your room, you lie down and attempt to rest; trying not to think of Nicholas Walsh.</p><p>Despite the countless attempts, you still didn\u2019t want to give into your thoughts. You really felt that it was all your fault; you wanted to go out and party (which meant hook-up, feel disappointed in the end) and continue your self-destructive cycle.</p><p>You had also dragged Lily right back into it and had given Sirius a peek at what you were really like.</p><p>However, you did get to hang out with Sirius a bit more. And while the thought made you very giddy, a little voice also said that you were too insecure and would only pull Sirius back from his own happiness.</p><p>As the night went on, you slowly gave in to sleep, letting your eyelids close and your thoughts flow into your dreams.</p>",

You hated everything.<br /></p><p>Everything about yourself, you despised.</p><p>You were standing in front of your full body mirror, making disgusted faces at your horrid figure.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what you saw about yourself, that&rsquo;s how you treated your self-care and ego. All your friends always argued against your view, saying how you were much better than you thought to be.</p><p>Thankful for your separate room- (being a prefect had its perks)- you kept turning and staring and thinking about your horridness.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know that Lily was about to burst in and save you from your self-loathing mind, so you continued to look at yourself in disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! Do you wanna- Y/N? What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>Lily Evans stood in your doorway, looking saddened at you standing in front of your mirror, you looking disgusted.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m just looking at how much I dislike our uniforms&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two days ago you were discussing how much you liked these uniforms compared to your muggle friends&rsquo; ones at their high school.

Why don&rsquo;t you see what we see?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s not true! It&rsquo;s not bloody true, Lily! Can&rsquo;t you accept the fact that I&rsquo;m ugly and horrible and no one will ever look at me the way they look at you?!&rdquo;</p><p>Lily had come closer to your slightly trembling figure. &ldquo;Is this what your self-loathing is about this time?&rdquo; She asked softly.</p><p>You nod your head. Sometimes you got like this- it was a cycle. First was self-hate. Next was comforting from close friends. Next came parties, hooking up, leaving quickly the next morning and trying not to fall in love. And then, self-hate came again straight after you looked back at what you did.</p><p>It was easy to say that your coping mechanisms were shit.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m so sorry Lily! I have this constant, like, despair cycle and I-I&rsquo;ve gotten you heavily involved!&rdquo;</p><p>She took a seat on your bed and sighed. &ldquo;Y/N, you haven&rsquo;t dragged me into your &lsquo;despair cycle&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ve let myself be involved because I want to help you. I know that you&rsquo;ve gone through this a lot, but I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;ll ALWAYS be here because I care. You&rsquo;re one of my best friends. I will not leave your side until you&rsquo;ve gotten better.

No means no,&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>&ldquo;She only said, 'I changed my mind&rsquo;, not 'no&rsquo;,&rdquo; Nick spat.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a <i>huge</i> difference, you bloody <i>idiot</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>Normally, you&rsquo;d have stopped the little spat, but you couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Sirius in a new light. Not only had he saved and defended you from Nick, but he also showed a maturity that you didn&rsquo;t really think he would have.</p><p>Obviously, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p><p>The firewhiskey (mixed with a few other things) had also slowed your thought process, rendering you silent.</p><p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much difference to me, though,&rdquo; Nick replied, smug and smirking, standing 'all holy&rsquo;.</p><p>Before anyone could make a move, you walked up to him from behind Sirius&rsquo;s protective stance and slapped him.</p><p>The party had already gone rather quiet, everyone tuning into Sirius and Nick arguing. However, now even the quietened music stopped completely and literally <i>everyone</i> was watching.</p><p>You felt your face hot all over from the attention, as well as rage.</p><p>&ldquo;From someone who comes from a pureblood, all English family, you certainly lack the understanding of some of the most basic English words,&rdquo; you spat. &ldquo;Screw you.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, you speed past everyone, rushing out of the Gryffindor common room, running towards the Ravenclaw tower.</p><p>Your eyes started to prickle with tears, but you harshly rubbed at them, refusing to cry until you were alone. You didn&rsquo;t bother checking for Filch; nor any other staff for the matter.</p><p>All that mattered was that you got back to your private dorm to have a breakdown in peace.</p><p>As soon as you reached the entrance, you were listening in on the riddle, only to lose track of your thoughts as a voice called out from behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, L/N! Wait!&rdquo;</p><p>Of course. Sirius Black. Rolling your eyes but begrudgingly turning to him, you sigh. &ldquo;Sorry for running out. I should have thanked you before running away to go cry somewhere else where I wouldn&rsquo;t lose <i>all</i> my dignity,&rdquo; you chuckled.</p><p>Sirius winced a bit, knowing there was no humour in your statement whatsoever.</p><p>Maybe it was the alcohol (actually, it probably isn&rsquo;t)- but your heart rate sped up. You realized how close you were to Sirius and how alone you both currently were. With newfound braveness, you observed him. How black but soft looking his hair was, how his eyes showed so much concern. It didn&rsquo;t help that he was breathtakingly gorgeous.</p><p>&ldquo;I only wanted to check on you. Gotta make sure you&rsquo;re not getting ready to murder Nicholas. Wouldn&rsquo;t be a big loss, but I can&rsquo;t have such a pretty face rot away in Azkaban so quickly,&rdquo; he teased, his usually playful manner coming back out.</p><p>Even though you tried your hardest to suppress a big grin, it broke out anyway, along with a small laugh. It was beginning to feel like the horrible incident with Nick happened ages ago as if Sirius had the ability to make you feel better quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;There I was, about to be taken advantage of and here you are still cracking jokes,&rdquo; you joke. However, it seemed that Sirius was genuinely worried.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding. I have dark humour sometimes,&rdquo; you grin.</p><p>Before Sirius could reply, another voice spoke out, echoing in the hallway. &ldquo;Y/N/N! Thank Merlin I caught you. We need to go into your common room, I &nbsp;saw Professor Snape wondering around nearby. That&rsquo;s why I took so long to get here, sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Lily was panting, tying up her hair when Sirius spoke. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Remus, James and Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told them to wait and deal with Nick,&rdquo; she frowned. &ldquo;I hope James hexes the shit out of Nick, <i>honestly</i>. What an arse.&rdquo;</p><p>You and Sirius both look at each other, eyebrows raised. Lily seemed to have gained another personality, much fiercer than her red hair.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright then. Now both of you shush so I can concentrate on finding an answer to the riddle.&rdquo;</p><p>'When will water stop running down a hill?&rsquo; The eagle knocker speaks out.</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of riddle is this? When it reaches the bottom,&rdquo; you reply, disappointed at the easiness but grateful for being able to leave the corridor quickly.</p><p>'It&rsquo;s a very simple one. I&rsquo;m quite tired and students like you poking around late disturb me. The quicker you work out the riddle, the quicker I can get back to my rest,&rsquo; the eagle spoke, a hint of annoyance in their voice.</p><p>Chuckling, you step in. &ldquo;Have a good night,&rdquo; you say as you close the door after Sirius and Lily.</p><p>As soon as you all reach your private dorm, you collapse onto the bed, Sirius and Lily both sitting at the foot of your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; Y/N. Are you feeling any better?&rdquo; Lily asked, with concern etched onto her face.</p><p>&ldquo;I am, actually. Believe it or not, but Sirius actually helped. Even though you are extremely annoying, Black, you&rsquo;re pretty damn helpful and hilarious too.&rdquo;</p><p>Sirius grinned wolfishly, indicating that he was about to say something very smug. It surprised you how well you knew him, even though you hung out more with just Remus and Lily.</p><p>&ldquo;Glad to know I&rsquo;m of help,&rdquo; he started. &ldquo;It was nothing, defending you from Nick, my dear.&rdquo; He smiled cheekily, knowing you 'hated&rsquo; being called 'my dear&rsquo;, especially since you both weren&rsquo;t really relationship people yourselves.</p><p>Deep down, however, you knew you loved the attention from Sirius.</p><p>Blushing, you were thinking of a witty response, but to your luck, Lily noticed how you were struggling.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re fine now, Y/N, which you are, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Lily began. &ldquo;-Then maybe you could join Sirius and I as we go check on the rest? Which unfortunately includes Nick. Unless you want to stay and have alone time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just stay, yeah. I don&rsquo;t want everyone to try whisper to each other about me while I&rsquo;m there. I&rsquo;ll just give them the satisfaction of free gossip. I&rsquo;ll help you get out, though. I don&rsquo;t like pestering the poor eagle too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you implying that we aren&rsquo;t as smart as you, dear?&rdquo; Sirius quipped.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. Well, maybe just you, Black.&rdquo;</p><p>You all got off your bed chuckling, heading for the common room. As soon as you reach the entrance, you turn to them.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, guys. Really. Go have fun. Murder Nick for me.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as you answer the riddle quickly, you wave them off and quietly shut the door. Slumping towards your room, you lie down and attempt to rest; trying not to think of Nicholas Walsh.</p><p>Despite the countless attempts, you still didn&rsquo;t want to give into your thoughts. You really felt that it was all your fault; you wanted to go out and party (which meant hook-up, feel disappointed in the end) and continue your self-destructive cycle.</p><p>You had also dragged Lily right back into it and had given Sirius a peek at what you were really like.</p><p>However, you did get to hang out with Sirius a bit more. And while the thought made you very giddy, a little voice also said that you were too insecure and would only pull Sirius back from his own happiness.</p><p>As the night went on, you slowly gave in to sleep, letting your eyelids close and your thoughts flow into your dreams.</p>",

Ayala, she, 15, Jewish, lives in Israel, speaks Hebrew, draw way too much, Slytherin, ROTBTD fangirl, firebender, obsessed with green color, in love with prince Zuko, Jack Frost, Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the third, and a lot more fictional characters. Watching Tangled the Series and enjoy drawing angst Varian from time to time. Cassarian, Jelsa and Hiccstrid, though I'm also a multishiper. \nI will be publishing my art (and probably rebloging a lot of other stuff) in here. Enjoy^^ \n\nhttps://jewishicequeen.tumblr.com/search/ayala's%20art",
