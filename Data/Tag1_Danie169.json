The rape had taught me that I was not smart or well-rounded or strong. After all, if I was any of those things, I would have insisted that I go home right away. I would have not followed my friend upstairs to his room. I wouldn&rsquo;t have done a lot of things.</p><p>Finding a good support system is CRUCIAL. After talking things through with my therapist and talking and journaling to myself, I finally felt like I was able to tell other people, and the more I talked about it, the better I felt<b>.</b>&nbsp;I wrote about it, I basically had to make my husband listen to me (that is a story for another time, but long story short, between the stresses of teaching, marriage, and no sex, he became an alcoholic), and I confided in my best friend what had happened. Just the act of being able to talk about it allowed me to understand that it wasn&rsquo;t my fault. It helped me undo years of damaging thoughts and helped me unlearn some really terrible habits I had gotten myself into while thinking I wasn&rsquo;t worth anything.</p><p>As I talked with them, worked it through via books and workbooks, and began working my ASS off at my job because it was the one place I could go where I didn&rsquo;t have to let my past affect my present, I began realizing that I was capable of things. I was capable of being a good friend and coworker and boss. I was capable of making sound judgments.</p><p>I started taking pride in every aspect of my job, whether or not I wanted to really do them. Listening to 90 voice mails that were left over the course of 2 months on a phone where the voice mail indicator light was broken? That&rsquo;s real shitty. But I was going to do it, and I was going to do it well. I felt like I could conquer anything and everything. That led to taking pride in every aspect of my life; walking the dog, grocery shopping, making appointments, watching Judge Judy.</p><p>I still don&rsquo;t trust myself all the time, which I think is normal. But I&rsquo;ve learned to:</p><p>- Not panic over things I cannot control at that moment (ie, work problems when I&rsquo;m not at work)<br />- Allow myself to make mistakes<br />- Maintain my&nbsp;&ldquo;box&rdquo;</p><p><i>(my box is in my car. when i leave for work, i place all my home issues in the box and when i arrive at work, i collect my work issues. then when i get back in the car on the way home, i place all my work issues in the box and when i get home, i collect my home issues. this way i can really enjoy my 40 minute commute to work and think about other, peaceful things. this is IMMENSELY helpful for me.)</i></p><p><b>3) I started Living my Truth (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90HDPSz3ldU\">x</a>)</b></p><p>I&rsquo;ve been in the Phandom for nearly 10 years now, but nothing ever spoke to me the way that Dan Howell&rsquo;s video about living your truth did. I&rsquo;ve been writing for 17 years, and publication has always been a major goal for me. Suddenly, in a video from a nerd who I had watched while maturing and growing up - not to mention in the darkest phases of my life - he was encouraging his fanbase to do what they loved, and to live the life they wanted to despite what anyone else thought.</p><p>So I did just that. I maintained (and am still maintaining) the highest standards for myself at work, I&rsquo;m living the kind of life I want to live at home, and I&rsquo;m unabashedly writing my butt off. I&rsquo;m submitting to expeditions and I&rsquo;m telling everyone about my writing goals and I&rsquo;m not ashamed to promote this <strike>silly</strike> habit that I love so much.</p><p><b><b>4) I actually started romanticizing simple things</b>\n\n<br /></b></p><p>This is a very recent thing (like, beginning of 2019, 10-days-old new) but my life has definitely changed. I took inspiration from a post about how you should live your life like a Studio Ghibli movie. Romanticize all the little things you do and make them truly enjoyable. I do just that.</p><p>- I no longer go to Starbucks. Instead I make a pot of tea and heat it up each morning and start my commute with fresh hot liquids and some sort of music/podcast<br />- I started bullet journaling. It&rsquo;s not pretty, but it&rsquo;s functional, and the hobby and habit tracker requires me to take time (maybe not every day because hey, life&rsquo;s crazy sometimes!) to review the past days and how I&rsquo;ve felt<br />- I tidy every day. I used to not do this, but between enjoying putting things in their place (the type-A part of me) and the fact that it makes my husband so happy, I&rsquo;m starting to make it a habit, and a habit that I really like doing</p><hr /><p>I hope this gives you a little hope, you there, person who is struggling and who feels betrayed by their own mind. Remember you&rsquo;re not alone, there&rsquo;s no timeline to figure out your life, and the crappy feelings you have now, so when you dig yourself out, you can be proud of where you came from.</p>",
