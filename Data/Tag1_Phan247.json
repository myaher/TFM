It seems like some of his younger fans don\u2019t quite realize that, and that\u2019s honestly not their fault, because they may not have even been around to witness what Youtube was like at the time that Dan started.

        "answer": "<p>\u201cIt was nowhere near the kind of platform that it was today. It was something that people did for fun, and being a career Youtuber wasn\u2019t a big Thing. Hell, when Phil started Youtube, making it a career wasn\u2019t even an option. I think the case for both of them, but for Dan especially, is that Youtube was a fun thing that they started doing at very young ages, and they ended up finding a lot of unexpected success. (2/7)\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd like, when you\u2019re very young and you find that you can make a good living out of doing something that started off as just a hobby for you, then hell yeah you\u2019re gonna capitalize on it without necessarily thinking about its long-term implications. Again, this applies especially to Dan, because his crescendo of internet fame happened at a time when he had absolutely no idea what he wanted to do with his life. (3/7)\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d dropped out of college (or university I guess but I\u2019m American lol) and had no direction. And he was able to find a lot of success in a booming new industry, and build a successful brand both on his own and with his best friend, and that\u2019s great. But this is kind of a pivotal moment in his life. Youtube is a big business now, and Dan\u2019s in his late 20s, and it\u2019s like\u2026 does he want Youtube to be his Job for the rest of his life? (4/7)\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDoes he want to use his Youtube success as a stepping stone into some other creative/entertainment industry? Does he want to abandon the platform altogether and take his life in a completely different direction? Does he want to have some sense of like, \u201ctraditional normalcy\u201d that his Youtube career and branding doesn\u2019t really offer? (5/7)\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWho knows, but it must be getting more and more complicated for him as he gets older, considering that he had no way of planning for his future while his internet success was happening (because he was among the first wave of people to become Really Successful on social media, so there was honestly no telling what the future would hold). This is becoming a very long-winded stream-of-consciousness clusterfuck, so I think I\u2019ll just end it here. (6/7)\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cTL;DR, Dan never planned on being internet famous, and while he\u2019s clearly very grateful for his fans and his success and his relationship (whatever it may be) with Phil and proud of all he\u2019s been able to do, he may not want to do it forever. Whether he decides to stay on Youtube, continues but just to a lesser extent, leaves altogether, or whatever, I\u2019ll be happy for him. He brought me a lot of joy during some of my very difficult formative years, and I\u2019ll be grateful for that regardless. (7/7)\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><br/></p><p>You know, I think 7 parts is the longest ask I\u2019ve gotten to date. Well done, anon. </p><p><br/></p><p>I really don\u2019t have much to add. I don\u2019t really disagree with a single thing you said. A lot of the old-school youtubers never intended to be famous at all. 10 years ago, youtube was more of a hobby you had the option to get paid for. So like you said, of course people jumped at the opportunity to make a bit of extra cash doing stuff they were already doing anyway. </p><p><br/></p><p>Then it reached a point where you could make more money on YouTube than you did at your day job. So people jumped on the opportunity to pursue youtube full time. </p><p><br/></p><p>Now it\u2019s changing again. There\u2019s not as much freedom for creators now. With \u201cthe algorithm\u201d fucking everyone over, with Adsense in the toilet, it\u2019s become a competition of views and likes and who has the most subscribers and who gets the best brand deals and who sells the most merch. It really is a business now, and youtube rewards the people who treat it like a business. </p><p><br/></p><p>It seems like Dan and Phil tried to keep up with it for a while. They wrote a book when youtubers writing books was a big thing. They went on tour when youtubers going on tour was a big thing. But somewhere post-tatinof seems to be where their channels started declining and I think at least Dan, is finally throwing in the towel. Not necessarily because he cares about the views, but because youtube has changed into something so different that he just seems kind of done with it. </p><p><br/></p><p>And who knows what he\u2019ll do next. Maybe he\u2019ll get a \u201creal job\u201d. Maybe he\u2019ll throw himself into his thing with young minds. Maybe he\u2019ll just flat out retire, since he\u2019s most likely rich enough to do so. </p><p><br/></p><p>But I really don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see him drop entirely off the platform. I think he still enjoys making videos. He\u2019s said himself that he considers himself an entertainer, a content creator. So I think he\u2019s gonna keep making content. I just don\u2019t think he gives a fuck how many people are watching. Because he knows <i>someone</i> is watching. I think he\u2019ll make videos whenever he wants to make them, and he won\u2019t worry about whether or not youtube and \u201cthe algorithm\u201d are going to reward him for it. </p><p><br/></p><p>As for Phil, he doesn\u2019t seem to be going down that road quite yet. But I think you\u2019ll see him follow before too long. </p>",
