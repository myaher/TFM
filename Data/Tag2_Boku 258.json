Gran trolled him Yoda-style for a few minutes and then when Deku was about to leave, he suddenly turned it all the way to eleven and was all COME AT ME.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> All Might and Naomasa discuss Noumu.

Gran trolled him Yoda-style for a few minutes and then when Deku was about to leave, he suddenly turned it all the way to eleven and was all COME AT ME.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> All Might and Naomasa discuss Noumu. Deku spars with Gran and gets a quick ass-kicking and some advice. Iida patrols Hosu City. Stain and Tomura are formally introduced and immediately hate each other.
