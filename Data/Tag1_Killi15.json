Eve ran to catch up with her, calling her name, but Oksana didn\u2019t turn around until Eve put a hand on her elbow. Even then, she kept her eyes to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come home last night? Did you actually think I wouldn\u2019t want you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just&hellip;I thought it\u2019d be better if I gave you some space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my office. Well, I spent the night there. I didn\u2019t really sleep. I finished grading the papers and I just kind of&hellip;stared at the wall.\u201d</p><p>Eve felt sick. \u00a0\u201cOksana-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent out an email apologizing and letting them know that it was my fault, not yours. I\u2019m going to be in my office all day with the papers so everyone should be able to come by and pick them up and to make up for everything I\u2019m going to do an extra review session in half an hour.\u201d Oksana\u2019s words fell out of her mouth in a single rushed breath.</p><p>\u201cI know, I saw the email,\u201d Eve said, gently.</p><p>Oksana was still pointedly not looking at Eve and she hadn\u2019t made eye contact once since they\u2019d started talking. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably start getting here soon. I was just making copies of some practice problems, but I should be getting back.\u201d</p><p>She turned to go, but Eve pulled on her arm lightly. \u201cOksana. Please.\u201d Oksana stopped but she still refused to look at Eve. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Eve whispered, slipping her fingers through her wife\u2019s. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you. I was stressed and that\u2019s no excuse, I\u2019m just telling you so you know that it wasn\u2019t about you.\u201d</p><p>Oksana was biting her lip hard and Eve could see that her eyes were wet. \u201cYou were right, though. I let you down. I do that. I do that with everyone and most of the time I don\u2019t care but it\u2019s you, so I do care. I care a lot. I don\u2019t want to let you down, Eve. I\u2019m sorry. I really am.\u201d</p><p>Eve brushed her thumb across Oksana\u2019s cheek. \u201cPlease look at me.\u201d Oksana took a shaky breath, but she finally raised her eyes to meet Eve\u2019s. \u201cYes, I was frustrated. Yes, I would hope you plan ahead better on things like that in the future. But that\u2019s a small thing, a stupid thing. You have a bad habit of procrastinating and we all have bad habits. I have plenty of my own. It doesn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you can\u2019t count on me,\u201d Oksana whispered and Eve\u2019s heart clenched tight in her chest.</p><p>She rested her forehead on Oksana&rsquo;s. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d she murmured, hoping her words conveyed how much she truly regretted saying it. Oksana shook her head ever so slightly; she clearly didn\u2019t believe Eve. Eve sucked in a shaky breath, she was starting to fight back tears herself, and nudged Oksana&rsquo;s chin with her hand, forcing her wife to look at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. Not in general. In that one moment, for that one thing, maybe, but not about you and us in the everyday, for the big things. You are the person I go to for everything. Whether I\u2019m happy or sad or scared or tired or frustrated, whatever it is, I go to you. Whenever I have news, big or small, it\u2019s you I want to tell and I always know you\u2019ll be excited to hear it or support me if it\u2019s bad. I know you\u2019re there for me. More than anyone or anything has ever been. You\u2019re my one constant, the thing I can trust more than anything. I count on you. Absolutely. Unquestionably.\u201d</p><p>Oksana wasn\u2019t responding. Her face was blank but her breathing was coming faster and faster and a single tear had escaped and started to slip down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cOksana, are you hearing me?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014&ndash;</p><p>A group of students was clustered at the windows in the main hall of the faculty office buildings. The bank of windows looked out over the small courtyard that was tucked behind the building and the first few students who had been heading to Dr. Astankova\u2019s office that morning had skidded to a halt when the glanced out them as they were walking by. A small crowd had soon formed.</p><p>Their two professors were standing in the middle of the courtyard with the sunlight that was just beginning to break through the clouds lighting up their faces for everyone to see. They were barely a couple inches apart, foreheads pressed together, Dr. Polastri\u2019s hand on Dr. Astankova\u2019s cheek. The sunlight picked up the glint of tears on her other cheek and if they looked close it was clear she wasn\u2019t the only one crying.</p><p>They had clearly been in the middle of an intense conversation, but by the time the majority of people had gathered they were no longer speaking, just standing still as statues, close enough to kiss. Indeed, someone chanted under their breath, \u201cKiss, kiss, kiss.\u201d</p><p>And then, as if she had heard them, Dr. Astankova dropped the stack of papers she had been holding and her hands hooked around the back of Dr. Polastri\u2019s neck so she could pull her in, close the final few inches, and press their lips together. The papers spilled to the ground in a disorganized mess and a faint breeze that had been caught in the courtyard swirled them around the professors\u2019 feet.</p><p>One of the girls grinned and held out her hand to the guy standing next to her. \u201cPay up. I told you it was a lovers quarrel.\u201d He laughed, shook his head, and handed over the money without argument.</p><p>It was no little peck on the lips, nothing that any reasonable person could argue to be a friendly kiss, if there even was such a thing. Even from a little bit of a distance, the students could see their breaths had quickened by the time they broke apart. Dr. Astankova tucked her face into Dr. Polastri\u2019s shoulder and Dr. Polastri wrapped her arms tight around her wife, pulling her close and burying her face in Dr. Astankova\u2019s hair.</p><p>All the bets got paid up - lovers quarrel, kissing by the end of the term, sleeping together, in a relationship, in love, married. No argument. There was no argument.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014&ndash;</p><p>Oksana was floating, floating.</p><p>She opened her eyes, slowly coming out of the post-sex haze. Eve was on her back beside her, eyes still closed. One of her arms was stretched out just enough to bridge the distance between the two of them and brush Oksana\u2019s side. Oksana smiled; Eve always had to keep in contact with her afterwards. Oksana liked it, too.</p><p>She ran her fingers up Eve\u2019s arm, wrist to shoulder, with feather-light touch. Eve hummed in contentment.</p><p>\u201cYou know I think people saw us in the courtyard.\u201d Oksana continued circling patterns on Eve\u2019s skin as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cMm, it\u2019s possible,\u201d Eve said, eyes still closed. \u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don&rsquo;t. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>A big smile spread across Oksana\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you too. I want people to know you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d Eve replied teasingly, opening her eyes to catch Oksana\u2019s expression, \u201cI\u2019m yours, am I?\u201d</p><p>Oksana blushed hard and red, burying her face in the pillow. \u201cI mean - if you want to be - because, well, I consider myself to be yours, well, you know, if you\u2019ll have me-\u201d The words tumbled out muffled by the pillow</p><p>Eve laughed and rolled over against her wife, wrapping an arm tight around her bare waist. She pressed a line of kisses down her neck and onto her shoulder where she paused and whispered to Oksana, \u201cYou\u2019re too precious. You\u2019re my wife. Yes, you\u2019re mine and yes, I\u2019m yours. And I love you. A whole lot, more than I can ever explain.\u201d</p><p>Oksana lifted her head from the pillow so she could look at Eve. The flush had yet to fade from her cheeks and was still coloring them a brilliant red. \u201cI love you, too. More than I can ever explain.\u201d</p><p>Eve kissed her and Oksana could feel the grin on her lips as she did so. Oksana pulled away just enough that she could look at Eve, light dancing in her eyes. \u201cDoes this mean I get to buy you a bigger wedding ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It does not. I like my wedding ring.\u201d</p><p>Oksana kissed her again, long and hard, the moment filled with all of the tension of the past twenty-four hours, finally released. After she broke away, she curled up against Eve\u2019s side where traced her fingers across Eve\u2019s skin and whispered, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Eve smiled, the weight in her stomach and chest finally gone and replaced with an all-encompassing warmth. \u201cYours. And mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d</p>",

Eve ran to catch up with her, calling her name, but Oksana didn\u2019t turn around until Eve put a hand on her elbow. Even then, she kept her eyes to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come home last night? Did you actually think I wouldn\u2019t want you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just\u2026I thought it\u2019d be better if I gave you some space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my office. Well, I spent the night there. I didn\u2019t really sleep. I finished grading the papers and I just kind of\u2026stared at the wall.\u201d</p><p>Eve felt sick. \u00a0\u201cOksana-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent out an email apologizing and letting them know that it was my fault, not yours. I\u2019m going to be in my office all day with the papers so everyone should be able to come by and pick them up and to make up for everything I\u2019m going to do an extra review session in half an hour.\u201d Oksana\u2019s words fell out of her mouth in a single rushed breath.</p><p>\u201cI know, I saw the email,\u201d Eve said, gently.</p><p>Oksana was still pointedly not looking at Eve and she hadn\u2019t made eye contact once since they\u2019d started talking. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably start getting here soon. I was just making copies of some practice problems, but I should be getting back.\u201d</p><p>She turned to go, but Eve pulled on her arm lightly. \u201cOksana. Please.\u201d Oksana stopped but she still refused to look at Eve. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Eve whispered, slipping her fingers through her wife\u2019s. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you. I was stressed and that\u2019s no excuse, I\u2019m just telling you so you know that it wasn\u2019t about you.\u201d</p><p>Oksana was biting her lip hard and Eve could see that her eyes were wet. \u201cYou were right, though. I let you down. I do that. I do that with everyone and most of the time I don\u2019t care but it\u2019s you, so I do care. I care a lot. I don\u2019t want to let you down, Eve. I\u2019m sorry. I really am.\u201d</p><p>Eve brushed her thumb across Oksana\u2019s cheek. \u201cPlease look at me.\u201d Oksana took a shaky breath, but she finally raised her eyes to meet Eve\u2019s. \u201cYes, I was frustrated. Yes, I would hope you plan ahead better on things like that in the future. But that\u2019s a small thing, a stupid thing. You have a bad habit of procrastinating and we all have bad habits. I have plenty of my own. It doesn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you can\u2019t count on me,\u201d Oksana whispered and Eve\u2019s heart clenched tight in her chest.</p><p>She rested her forehead on Oksana\u2019s. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d she murmured, hoping her words conveyed how much she truly regretted saying it. Oksana shook her head ever so slightly; she clearly didn\u2019t believe Eve. Eve sucked in a shaky breath, she was starting to fight back tears herself, and nudged Oksana\u2019s chin with her hand, forcing her wife to look at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. Not in general. In that one moment, for that one thing, maybe, but not about you and us in the everyday, for the big things. You are the person I go to for everything. Whether I\u2019m happy or sad or scared or tired or frustrated, whatever it is, I go to you. Whenever I have news, big or small, it\u2019s you I want to tell and I always know you\u2019ll be excited to hear it or support me if it\u2019s bad. I know you\u2019re there for me. More than anyone or anything has ever been. You\u2019re my one constant, the thing I can trust more than anything. I count on you. Absolutely. Unquestionably.\u201d</p><p>Oksana wasn\u2019t responding. Her face was blank but her breathing was coming faster and faster and a single tear had escaped and started to slip down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cOksana, are you hearing me?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>A group of students was clustered at the windows in the main hall of the faculty office buildings. The bank of windows looked out over the small courtyard that was tucked behind the building and the first few students who had been heading to Dr. Astankova\u2019s office that morning had skidded to a halt when the glanced out them as they were walking by. A small crowd had soon formed.</p><p>Their two professors were standing in the middle of the courtyard with the sunlight that was just beginning to break through the clouds lighting up their faces for everyone to see. They were barely a couple inches apart, foreheads pressed together, Dr. Polastri\u2019s hand on Dr. Astankova\u2019s cheek. The sunlight picked up the glint of tears on her other cheek and if they looked close it was clear she wasn\u2019t the only one crying.</p><p>They had clearly been in the middle of an intense conversation, but by the time the majority of people had gathered they were no longer speaking, just standing still as statues, close enough to kiss. Indeed, someone chanted under their breath, \u201cKiss, kiss, kiss.\u201d</p><p>And then, as if she had heard them, Dr. Astankova dropped the stack of papers she had been holding and her hands hooked around the back of Dr. Polastri\u2019s neck so she could pull her in, close the final few inches, and press their lips together. The papers spilled to the ground in a disorganized mess and a faint breeze that had been caught in the courtyard swirled them around the professors\u2019 feet.</p><p>One of the girls grinned and held out her hand to the guy standing next to her. \u201cPay up. I told you it was a lovers quarrel.\u201d He laughed, shook his head, and handed over the money without argument.</p><p>It was no little peck on the lips, nothing that any reasonable person could argue to be a friendly kiss, if there even was such a thing. Even from a little bit of a distance, the students could see their breaths had quickened by the time they broke apart. Dr. Astankova tucked her face into Dr. Polastri\u2019s shoulder and Dr. Polastri wrapped her arms tight around her wife, pulling her close and burying her face in Dr. Astankova\u2019s hair.</p><p>All the bets got paid up - lovers quarrel, kissing by the end of the term, sleeping together, in a relationship, in love, married. No argument. There was no argument.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>Oksana was floating, floating.</p><p>She opened her eyes, slowly coming out of the post-sex haze. Eve was on her back beside her, eyes still closed. One of her arms was stretched out just enough to bridge the distance between the two of them and brush Oksana\u2019s side. Oksana smiled; Eve always had to keep in contact with her afterwards. Oksana liked it, too.</p><p>She ran her fingers up Eve\u2019s arm, wrist to shoulder, with feather-light touch. Eve hummed in contentment.</p><p>\u201cYou know I think people saw us in the courtyard.\u201d Oksana continued circling patterns on Eve\u2019s skin as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cMm, it\u2019s possible,\u201d Eve said, eyes still closed. \u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>A big smile spread across Oksana\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you too. I want people to know you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d Eve replied teasingly, opening her eyes to catch Oksana\u2019s expression, \u201cI\u2019m yours, am I?\u201d</p><p>Oksana blushed hard and red, burying her face in the pillow. \u201cI mean - if you want to be - because, well, I consider myself to be yours, well, you know, if you\u2019ll have me-\u201d The words tumbled out muffled by the pillow</p><p>Eve laughed and rolled over against her wife, wrapping an arm tight around her bare waist. She pressed a line of kisses down her neck and onto her shoulder where she paused and whispered to Oksana, \u201cYou\u2019re too precious. You\u2019re my wife. Yes, you\u2019re mine and yes, I\u2019m yours. And I love you. A whole lot, more than I can ever explain.\u201d</p><p>Oksana lifted her head from the pillow so she could look at Eve. The flush had yet to fade from her cheeks and was still coloring them a brilliant red. \u201cI love you, too. More than I can ever explain.\u201d</p><p>Eve kissed her and Oksana could feel the grin on her lips as she did so. Oksana pulled away just enough that she could look at Eve, light dancing in her eyes. \u201cDoes this mean I get to buy you a bigger wedding ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It does not. I like my wedding ring.\u201d</p><p>Oksana kissed her again, long and hard, the moment filled with all of the tension of the past twenty-four hours, finally released. After she broke away, she curled up against Eve\u2019s side where traced her fingers across Eve\u2019s skin and whispered, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Eve smiled, the weight in her stomach and chest finally gone and replaced with an all-encompassing warmth. \u201cYours. And mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d</p>",

It doesn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you can\u2019t count on me,\u201d Oksana whispered and Eve\u2019s heart clenched tight in her chest.</p><p>She rested her forehead on Oksana\u2019s. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d she murmured, hoping her words conveyed how much she truly regretted saying it. Oksana shook her head ever so slightly; she clearly didn\u2019t believe Eve. Eve sucked in a shaky breath, she was starting to fight back tears herself, and nudged Oksana\u2019s chin with her hand, forcing her wife to look at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. Not in general. In that one moment, for that one thing, maybe, but not about you and us in the everyday, for the big things. You are the person I go to for everything. Whether I\u2019m happy or sad or scared or tired or frustrated, whatever it is, I go to you. Whenever I have news, big or small, it\u2019s you I want to tell and I always know you\u2019ll be excited to hear it or support me if it\u2019s bad. I know you\u2019re there for me. More than anyone or anything has ever been. You\u2019re my one constant, the thing I can trust more than anything. I count on you. Absolutely. Unquestionably.\u201d</p><p>Oksana wasn\u2019t responding. Her face was blank but her breathing was coming faster and faster and a single tear had escaped and started to slip down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cOksana, are you hearing me?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>A group of students was clustered at the windows in the main hall of the faculty office buildings. The bank of windows looked out over the small courtyard that was tucked behind the building and the first few students who had been heading to Dr. Astankova\u2019s office that morning had skidded to a halt when the glanced out them as they were walking by. A small crowd had soon formed.</p><p>Their two professors were standing in the middle of the courtyard with the sunlight that was just beginning to break through the clouds lighting up their faces for everyone to see. They were barely a couple inches apart, foreheads pressed together, Dr. Polastri\u2019s hand on Dr. Astankova\u2019s cheek. The sunlight picked up the glint of tears on her other cheek and if they looked close it was clear she wasn\u2019t the only one crying.</p><p>They had clearly been in the middle of an intense conversation, but by the time the majority of people had gathered they were no longer speaking, just standing still as statues, close enough to kiss. Indeed, someone chanted under their breath, \u201cKiss, kiss, kiss.\u201d</p><p>And then, as if she had heard them, Dr. Astankova dropped the stack of papers she had been holding and her hands hooked around the back of Dr. Polastri\u2019s neck so she could pull her in, close the final few inches, and press their lips together. The papers spilled to the ground in a disorganized mess and a faint breeze that had been caught in the courtyard swirled them around the professors\u2019 feet.</p><p>One of the girls grinned and held out her hand to the guy standing next to her. \u201cPay up. I told you it was a lovers quarrel.\u201d He laughed, shook his head, and handed over the money without argument.</p><p>It was no little peck on the lips, nothing that any reasonable person could argue to be a friendly kiss, if there even was such a thing. Even from a little bit of a distance, the students could see their breaths had quickened by the time they broke apart. Dr. Astankova tucked her face into Dr. Polastri\u2019s shoulder and Dr. Polastri wrapped her arms tight around her wife, pulling her close and burying her face in Dr. Astankova\u2019s hair.</p><p>All the bets got paid up - lovers quarrel, kissing by the end of the term, sleeping together, in a relationship, in love, married. No argument. There was no argument.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>Oksana was floating, floating.</p><p>She opened her eyes, slowly coming out of the post-sex haze. Eve was on her back beside her, eyes still closed. One of her arms was stretched out just enough to bridge the distance between the two of them and brush Oksana\u2019s side. Oksana smiled; Eve always had to keep in contact with her afterwards. Oksana liked it, too.</p><p>She ran her fingers up Eve\u2019s arm, wrist to shoulder, with feather-light touch. Eve hummed in contentment.</p><p>\u201cYou know I think people saw us in the courtyard.\u201d Oksana continued circling patterns on Eve\u2019s skin as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cMm, it\u2019s possible,\u201d Eve said, eyes still closed. \u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>A big smile spread across Oksana\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you too. I want people to know you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d Eve replied teasingly, opening her eyes to catch Oksana\u2019s expression, \u201cI\u2019m yours, am I?\u201d</p><p>Oksana blushed hard and red, burying her face in the pillow. \u201cI mean - if you want to be - because, well, I consider myself to be yours, well, you know, if you\u2019ll have me-\u201d The words tumbled out muffled by the pillow</p><p>Eve laughed and rolled over against her wife, wrapping an arm tight around her bare waist. She pressed a line of kisses down her neck and onto her shoulder where she paused and whispered to Oksana, \u201cYou\u2019re too precious. You\u2019re my wife. Yes, you\u2019re mine and yes, I\u2019m yours. And I love you. A whole lot, more than I can ever explain.\u201d</p><p>Oksana lifted her head from the pillow so she could look at Eve. The flush had yet to fade from her cheeks and was still coloring them a brilliant red. \u201cI love you, too. More than I can ever explain.\u201d</p><p>Eve kissed her and Oksana could feel the grin on her lips as she did so. Oksana pulled away just enough that she could look at Eve, light dancing in her eyes. \u201cDoes this mean I get to buy you a bigger wedding ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It does not. I like my wedding ring.\u201d</p><p>Oksana kissed her again, long and hard, the moment filled with all of the tension of the past twenty-four hours, finally released. After she broke away, she curled up against Eve\u2019s side where traced her fingers across Eve\u2019s skin and whispered, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Eve smiled, the weight in her stomach and chest finally gone and replaced with an all-encompassing warmth. \u201cYours. And mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d</p>",

Eve ran to catch up with her, calling her name, but Oksana didn&rsquo;t turn around until Eve put a hand on her elbow. Even then, she kept her eyes to the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come home last night? Did you actually think I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I just&hellip;I thought it&rsquo;d be better if I gave you some space.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where did you sleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In my office. Well, I spent the night there. I didn&rsquo;t really sleep. I finished grading the papers and I just kind of&hellip;stared at the wall.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve felt sick. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oksana-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I sent out an email apologizing and letting them know that it was my fault, not yours. I&rsquo;m going to be in my office all day with the papers so everyone should be able to come by and pick them up and to make up for everything I&rsquo;m going to do an extra review session in half an hour.&rdquo; Oksana&rsquo;s words fell out of her mouth in a single rushed breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I saw the email,&rdquo; Eve said, gently.</p><p>Oksana was still pointedly not looking at Eve and she hadn&rsquo;t made eye contact once since they&rsquo;d started talking. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll probably start getting here soon. I was just making copies of some practice problems, but I should be getting back.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned to go, but Eve pulled on her arm lightly. &ldquo;Oksana. Please.&rdquo; Oksana stopped but she still refused to look at Eve. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Eve whispered, slipping her fingers through her wife&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have yelled at you. I was stressed and that&rsquo;s no excuse, I&rsquo;m just telling you so you know that it wasn&rsquo;t about you.&rdquo;</p><p>Oksana was biting her lip hard and Eve could see that her eyes were wet. &ldquo;You were right, though. I let you down. I do that. I do that with everyone and most of the time I don&rsquo;t care but it&rsquo;s you, so I do care. I care a lot. I don&rsquo;t want to let you down, Eve. I&rsquo;m sorry. I really am.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve brushed her thumb across Oksana&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;Please look at me.&rdquo; Oksana took a shaky breath, but she finally raised her eyes to meet Eve&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Yes, I was frustrated. Yes, I would hope you plan ahead better on things like that in the future. But that&rsquo;s a small thing, a stupid thing. You have a bad habit of procrastinating and we all have bad habits. I have plenty of my own. It doesn&rsquo;t matter in the grand scheme of things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You said you can&rsquo;t count on me,&rdquo; Oksana whispered and Eve&rsquo;s heart clenched tight in her chest.</p><p>She rested her forehead on Oksana&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; she murmured, hoping her words conveyed how much she truly regretted saying it.
