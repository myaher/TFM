I mostly understand all of her actions and they are justifiable considering the position that she was in and her age so I don\u2019t judge her for any of that. The one thing that kind of made me sad though was when Sansa was thinking of Arya and thought she was unsatisfactory as sisters went. I thought it was a bit harsh for her baby sister that could very well be dead. Do you think she loves or cares about Arya?",
        "answer": "<p>When Sansa thought that Arya was unsatisfactory as sisters went, I thought that it was valid for her to feel in such a way. Think about it, Sansa has three high born brothers and a half-brother, and they all do and prefer traditionally masculine activities. They train alongside each other and they enjoy the same hobbies, so they do these together as well. They have a sibling that they can not only relate to when it comes to having a similar daily life, but a sibling they can do what they love with. Then you have Sansa, who loves to sew, to dance, to sing, to play instruments, to read and write, to dress prettily, to listen to romantic stories, etc. A sister in the traditional sense of the word would in theory not only be good at all of these things, but more importantly, would enjoy to do them alongside Sansa. They could gossip, eat lemon cakes and and listen to stories of knightly valor together.\u00a0</p><p>This is where Arya comes in. Arya is her little sister. In theory, she\u2019s supposed to be the only member of the Stark household who she could do all of these activities in a daily level with. She\u2019s supposed to enjoy courtesies, enjoy gossiping, enjoy these romantic tales, enjoy these things that none of her other siblings even pretend to care about. However, Arya not only doesn\u2019t but acts in a way that doesn\u2019t fit with these conventions, and far prefers to do the same things that her brothers do. Not only that but all of her siblings collectively look down on what Sansa likes and wants. Jon has an extremely misogynistic view of the struggles of traditionally feminine women and is quick to dismiss them, Robb doesn\u2019t put as much value to his sisters as he does on Jaime, Bran has no wish to hang out with Arya and Sansa in the beginning of the series because they are girls, and later mocks the romantic stories that Sansa likes, and internally Arya consistently degrades everything that Sansa does, likes and wants. Not only do her siblings not enjoy the things that she does, but they look down on her for enjoying these things.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The moment that Sansa is thinking about how Arya is an unsatisfactory sister, she doesn\u2019t mean that Arya is an unsatisfactory sibling and that she particularly dislikes her, but rather that she doesn\u2019t do the conventional things that Sansa would come to expect from a sister in that society and so Sansa is often alone with the few friends that she has (who can\u2019t always be there to hang out with her). Sansa felt very lonely in Winterfell because of the limited amount of people she could relate to there, and there wasn\u2019t a wide outlet to enjoy all of the things that she liked. For example, singers don\u2019t often go North, nor are there tourneys there and songs and tourneys are two things that Sansa actively enjoy a lot.\u00a0 The quote about \u2018\u2019unsatisfactory sister\u2019\u2019 is especially important in relation to Margaery. She is someone Sansa immediately became attached to because she offered Sansa the opportunity to have a sibling that she could do all of these traditionally feminine things with. Even earlier in the series, Sansa laments the fact that she never got a sister she could relate to and do things she loves with. She often tries to include Arya or asks her to join her in doing something, but Arya either doesn\u2019t realize it, or flat out just doesn\u2019t want to do what Sansa wants to do. The contrary is just as valid. Arya proposed for Sansa to join her and Mycah but Sansa does not because she doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy the things that Arya often wants to do. Both are unwilling to compromise, but while Arya has other siblings she could do what she loves with (plus she interacts a lot with the small folk), Sansa does not have a sibling like that, and has very few friends. Her loneliness in Winterfell perfectly explains her wanting to leave that place and her wishing to have a traditionally feminine sibling.\u00a0</p>",

        "body": "<p>And now for my favourite character. What is going to happen to Arya in Season 8 of Game of Thrones. I have already gone through some of this with my Jon post but here is a more in depth breakdown of our favourite Assassin (except Zevran).</p><p>Episode 1.</p><p>I think before the big intro with Dany and Jon arriving in Winterfell there will be an establishing scene of Arya and some of the people in Winter town - you know so when most of them die we feel bad. There has been some talk that in this season she has a meaningful scene with a child so potentially she is teaching the kids how to fight. As Tyrion was also not at the original meeting of Robert B and Ned in Season 1 as he was in Winter town he might also be show up there as well.</p><p>Now that she and Sansa have buried the hatchet (in Littlefingers head) there will be a scene with them and Bran where they discuss Jon, what he did and the ramifications of it. Possibly this is where Bran tells Sansa and Arya about Jon&rsquo;s parents which would lead into the next episode.</p><p>This will likely also be where she has her reunions with the Hound and Gendry and honestly it&rsquo;s a coin toss how she will react to either of them.</p><p>Episode 2. </p><p>As I mentioned on Jon&rsquo;s post I believe Arya will be the one to talk him out of his funk. They have a short amount of time and tying the reunion scene together with Jon recovering from his BSOD kills two birds with one stone.</p><p>There will be a scene with everyone preparing for the inevitable attack and at some point Dany and Arya with have a conversation and Arya will not hold back with Dany as she isn&rsquo;t politically minded like Sansa. She will be testing her to she how she reacts. I also think once it comes out that Sam&rsquo;s father and brother were killed she will be very cautious of her as she could see this as an abuse of authority which we all know Arya is not a fan of.</p><p>Episode 3.</p><p>Arya will likely have some real time to shine here because if she doesn&rsquo;t kill at\u00a0least one\u00a0White Walker I would be very surprised. I think they will likely be caught slightly unaware by the attack and she will go out to try and save the people of the town she gets some of them out but looks like she is swarmed but Wights and potentially we think she is going to die. There are two ways I see this going - the first is the wolf pack arrives and saves her (I will call it now if they show up and she gets circled like Dany has been and Jon as well then I am guaranteed right about the ending of the series). The second way it could go is she actually does die and Beric uses his last life to save her as a call back to Lady Stoneheart though if this happens the wolf pack will just have to show up later but there is no way they can tease an army of wolves last season and not use them.</p><p>As I said last time they win but the Night King tricked them and has gone further South.</p><p>Episode 4.</p><p>Jon goes to Kingslanding to strenuous objections from everyone and he gives a bit of sass back especially to Arya if she did go to Winter Town to save everyone. He immediately gets caught and Arya goes with the Hound to save him and have some sweet revenge on the side while they are there. Jaime might go with them. Remember from Season\u00a0one Arya actually knows some secret ways into the Red Keep and with her faces she will likely be able to get in quite easily. Obviously since Jon will have flown down on Rhaegal they will use Varys&rsquo; teleportation skills to get there quickly. Cleganebowl happens but likely Cersei lives until at least the next episode.</p><p>Episode 5 and 6.</p><p>They all get together and talk about their feelings and realise the Nights King isn't\u00a0such a bad guy - he just need a hug. Or there is a huge battle and a bunch of people kill each other. It could go either way. Arya will probably kill another White Walker and loads of people will die. After as they argue over politics she has the slow dawning horror of realisation that they are asking her to shag her cousin who she thought was her brother. They do it for political stability but after a few years - maybe once Jon and Dany are both dead many years later she leaves with the Hound her true Bromantic love interest and they finally go out in search of what is West of Westeros. </p><p>That might be a little bit too happy of an ending but she is my favourite so allow me the hope of her riding into the sunset at least.</p>",

They have a short amount of time and tying the reunion scene together with Jon recovering from his BSOD kills two birds with one stone.</p><p>There will be a scene with everyone preparing for the inevitable attack and at some point Dany and Arya with have a conversation and Arya will not hold back with Dany as she isn&rsquo;t politically minded like Sansa. She will be testing her to she how she reacts. I also think once it comes out that Sam&rsquo;s father and brother were killed she will be very cautious of her as she could see this as an abuse of authority which we all know Arya is not a fan of.</p><p>Episode 3.</p><p>Arya will likely have some real time to shine here because if she doesn&rsquo;t kill at&nbsp;least one&nbsp;White Walker I would be very surprised. I think they will likely be caught slightly unaware by the attack and she will go out to try and save the people of the town she gets some of them out but looks like she is swarmed but Wights and potentially we think she is going to die. There are two ways I see this going - the first is the wolf pack arrives and saves her (I will call it now if they show up and she gets circled like Dany has been and Jon as well then I am guaranteed right about the ending of the series). The second way it could go is she actually does die and Beric uses his last life to save her as a call back to Lady Stoneheart though if this happens the wolf pack will just have to show up later but there is no way they can tease an army of wolves last season and not use them.</p><p>As I said last time they win but the Night King tricked them and has gone further South.</p><p>Episode 4.</p><p>Jon goes to Kingslanding to strenuous objections from everyone and he gives a bit of sass back especially to Arya if she did go to Winter Town to save everyone. He immediately gets caught and Arya goes with the Hound to save him and have some sweet revenge on the side while they are there. Jaime might go with them. Remember from Season&nbsp;one Arya actually knows some secret ways into the Red Keep and with her faces she will likely be able to get in quite easily. Obviously since Jon will have flown down on Rhaegal they will use Varys&rsquo; teleportation skills to get there quickly. Cleganebowl happens but likely Cersei lives until at least the next episode.</p><p>Episode 5 and 6.</p><p>They all get together and talk about their feelings and realise the Nights King isn't&nbsp;such a bad guy - he just need a hug. Or there is a huge battle and a bunch of people kill each other. It could go either way. Arya will probably kill another White Walker and loads of people will die. After as they argue over politics she has the slow dawning horror of realisation that they are asking her to shag her cousin who she thought was her brother. They do it for political stability but after a few years - maybe once Jon and Dany are both dead many years later she leaves with the Hound her true Bromantic love interest and they finally go out in search of what is West of Westeros. </p><p>That might be a little bit too happy of an ending but she is my favourite so allow me the hope of her riding into the sunset at least.</p>",
