That means teaser trailers, photo shoots and posters - and it also means a sneak peak at some of the new costumes. I\u2019m a big fan of Michele Clapton\u2019s work on the show so I\u2019m really excited to see some of the new costumes, especially for the female characters.\u00a0</p><p>Not long ago Sophie Turner revealed that Sansa Stark would get an all-black new costume made of leather - and she characterized it as a kind of armour:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve had armor,\u201d Sophie Turner tells EW.\u00a0</i><i>The costume is not Jaime Lannister or Brienne of Tarth-style metal armor, but more like <b>a jet-black ensemble made of thick leather or similar material</b>. </i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/02/20/sophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8/\">Entertainment Weekly</a>)</p></blockquote><!-- more --><p>This quote provoked a lot of discussion among Sansa fans - some loved the idea while others hated it. However, we were all thrilled that to know that she got a new costume because at that point the teaser trailers and the still photos only showed Sansa wearing costumes from season 7.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3dabce3be9f020ea861a78f0ed8fdd1/tumblr_inline_pnoohnp01U1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"/></figure><p>The costumes in question were the charcoal dress with the feathered bodice and another grey piece with patterned fabric. She also wore her signature Stark furs.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3120\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67968e9075d38d24eb72a8efb812d586/tumblr_inline_pnooi1eSf81uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3120\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>Luckily, the new ForTheThrone posters and the big EW photo spread gave us a look at one of Sansa\u2019s new costumes: a spectacular black dress (with a blue tint?) made up of soft and glossy leather.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3032\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/62c0612b5d43d57cbb59c3746e5302ea/tumblr_inline_pnuyejHv6X1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3032\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>It looks to be an intricate piece made up of a staggering amount of tiny leather flaps sew together in an overlapping pattern, which creates a richly textured surface. I\u2019m can\u2019t wait to see it on the screen, in motion, because it promises to be a show-stopping piece.</p><p>The question is, of course, whether this dress is the costume that Sophie Turner refers to - but unless she has two jet-black leather costumes, I think it is safe to say that this textured leather dress is the armour costume that Turner refers to. However, it doesn&rsquo;t look armour in a practical sense - it is not a garment that will block a weapon. Rather, it is a protective garment in a more symbolic sense. The leather dress covers the actress from neck to ankle and it incorporates the heavy leather belt that wraps around her torso, which is an element that was designed to convey how Sansa emotionally protects herself after all the abuse she has suffered:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAll the characters\u2019 costumes are a consequence of the journey and lifestyle,\u201d Clapton states, particularly referencing a favorite piece of hers \u2014 <b>Sansa\u2019s belt</b>. \u201cThis is her<b> taking back control of her body</b>. I designed it to <b>wrap around over her side-laced dress</b> to<b> represent the</b> <b>absolute removal of any possible physical touch</b>. Her <b>dresses are also tightly-laced on, incredibly difficult to remove.</b>\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/02/20/sophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8/\">Making Game of Thrones</a>)<br/></p><p><i>\u201cWith one of the key pieces this year, <b>I wanted it to look as if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress\u2014like there was no way in. </b>So I designed a belt that comes around the neck, across the chest and around the waist. She\u2019s trying to protect herself from all the awfulness that\u2019s happened.<b> It\u2019s a form of armor.</b> It will be interesting to see how that moves forward.\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\">Elle</a>)</p></blockquote><p>With this new dress we see the same effect. Sansa\u2019s body is tightly bound and completely encased in this second skin of leather - and that certainly plays into the idea that Sansa\u2019s costumes express how she\u2019s building walls to protect herself. However, Sophie Turner also said something interesting about this new dress:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cWe the idea of it being very protective and she buttons herself up,\u201d Turner says. \u201cI wanted her to have a bit of armor and be a bit more warrior like. <b>She\u2019s like the warrior of Winterfell</b>.\u201d</i> (Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2F2019%2F02%2F20%2Fsophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8%2F&amp;t=ZWJjMDlhNzgxMGVkZTcyY2M4ZDBiYjY5NjU0ZDliNGYwNDJkNWU1NyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-preliminary-thoughts-on&amp;m=1\">EW</a>)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>So Sansa is still armoured - but it isn\u2019t just about keeping people at arm\u2019s length anymore but also a reflection of the fact that battle against the Army of the Dead is finally here and that she is ready for war. So it is about protection but also <i>a battle dress</i> signalling that Sansa is a leader, a warrior of Winterfell on the symbolic level. She isn\u2019t going to wield a sword but she is involved in organizing the defense, we saw that in season 7.</p><p>There\u2019s a stylistic continuity to the new costume in that it has almost the same silhouette as her season 7 costumes. It is the colour and the material that has changed. The only other difference is the absence of the shoulder tabs that characterized Sansa\u2019s dresses in season 7. We don\u2019t know when Sansa will wear this new black leather dress but I think she\u2019ll wear it in the 2nd and/or 3rd episode (when the big battle most likely will take place at Winterfell). <b>I don\u2019t think this dress will incarnate Sansa\u2019s final style at the end of the story.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/64860807783d2c865ce0e8843ef4c8a6/tumblr_inline_pnv574ztVL1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"/></figure><p><b>I my opinion, this is very much a transitional costume.</b> It keeps the general silhouette of her season 7 costumes with the high neck and the hidden side-lacing on the front of the bodice. It also keeps the belt and it looks as though the feathers that adorns the bodice of the season 7 dress has spread entirely over the new black dress. So, no, this is most likely not Sansa\u2019s only new costume nor the final one she\u2019ll wear on the show.</p><h2><b>A MATTER OF TEXTURE</b></h2><p>As the photos show, Sansa\u2019s new black gown is heavily textured - an effect that is created by what looks to a multitude of tiny leather flaps sewn together to create a kind of scaly appearance. This texture is really what draws the eye, mainly because it covers the entire dress but also because the material is very different from the more muted and discrete textures of Sansa\u2019s season 7 costumes (@lostlittlesatellites has written a great <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181846188337/a-ladys-armor-part-2\">essay</a> on the subject of the textures in the season 7 costumes).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2364\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6728457273566fd000f1a947ea61e8c5/tumblr_inline_pnrbrfGoqF1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2364\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>The question is: Is this visually extravagant texture just an aesthetic feature or does it have symbolic meaning? The answer is: Yes! Michele Clapton has always approached costume design in terms of narrative where patterns, colours and embroidery all tell a story about the characters. However, in regard to season 7 she really emphasized how the costumes are saturated with meaning:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We try to be really <b>symbolic about everything</b> everyone wears now.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>So when every detail is has meaning, when the elements of a costume are symbolic, what does the scaly texture of Sansa\u2019s black leather dress signify? There are several options, which I\u2019ll consider in the following section.</p><p><b>Dragonglass?</b></p><p>I\u2019ve seen several people mention dragonglass (obsidian) in relation to this dress, probably due to the bluish iridescence we can see in the photos and because the dress has been described as armour and obsidian is a hard substance that can protect people against the White Walkers.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ef0c9013eb6c1138073cd3b6ca2b63d/tumblr_inline_pnrbrxNvIg1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"/></figure><p>There is a certain resemblance when we put a photo of the dress and a piece of chipped obsidian side by side - and there certainly is a similarity between the blue tint of this dress and the way dragonglass looks in the cold North (where the scenes are often filmed with a blue tint).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1886\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4bc8613aa08db3febd3e75b77d3942d8/tumblr_inline_pnzr0d6Q0Y1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1886\"/></figure><p>The dress appears blue-black and very shiny in the photos but we have to take into account that the lighting for a photo shoot is much stronger than the lighting on the show and we also have to remember that the photos have been through a photo editing program, which may have enhanced the bluish shine.\u00a0It is possible that the leather isn\u2019t jet-black like Sophie said but has a bluish tint and it is possible that it has been treated in a way that makes it reflect light more than usual. It is hard to tell what is Photoshop, what is an effect of the lighting and what is the dress itself with the pictures we have - even when we zoom in on a photo taken in daylight.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"548\" data-orig-height=\"310\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a43ff65e3d24df5e00efc9432789962c/tumblr_inline_pnv0xtGeyc1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"548\" data-orig-height=\"310\"/></figure><p>However, jet-black is a <i>glossy</i> black colour - and if the leather is shiny and glossy as all the photos strongly suggest, then reflected light will show up as dark blue.\u00a0</p><p>Initially, I wasn\u2019t really sold on the idea that that this dress could evoke dragonglass but in a private discussion\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> presented some interesting arguments, such as the visual similarities between the dragonglass in Gendry\u2019s smithy (seen in the trailer) and the photos of Sansa\u2019s dress. She also suggested that a dragonglass reference could work as an image of strength but also as another type of\u00a0\u201cglass\u201d as a foil to the brittle glass pieces that adorns Cersei\u2019s season 7 costumes (<a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"667\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/189d2fd6796a9c6d0500b98edb911cea/tumblr_inline_pnzy9r1WZq1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"667\"/></figure><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c</i><i>I mean with Cersei<b> I wanted to show this brittleness to her</b>. So I started adding these <b>jagged edges and points to what she was wearing</b>. I\u2019m trying to give clues to their situation,<b> to subtly show when the characters are feeling strong, when they are feeling weak</b></i>.\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/game-of-thrones-season-7-costume-designer-michele-clapton-talks-female-power-dressing-war-and-the-a7912736.html\">The Independent</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>Sansa and Cersei have a complicated relationship and that has manifested in the costumes as well (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/182432528629/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-17\">x</a>). Narratively, they are foils to each other so if Cersei\u2019s excessive adornment signals a brittle strength, then Sansa\u2019s unadorned but textured gown externalizes an inner strength that has evolved over the course of her story. This is, after all, power dressing taken to the ninth degree.</p><p>I\u2019m still not quite sold on the dragonglass argument since the stylistic elements of the dress echo elements that have previously been associated with Sansa - feathers from her time in the Eyrie and fish scales as a nod to her Tully heritage through her mother. I\u2019ve mentioned that I think this is a transitional dress and as such it builds on the stylistic and symbolic approach that Clapton took with Sansa\u2019s costumes in season 7 where they visually express all of the things that has happened to her - the abuse and the lessons:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c&hellip;she\u2019s bringing all that she\u2019s been through to her costume.\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton,<i>\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">The Insider</a>)<br/></p><p>\n\n<i> I was trying to grasp <b>all that has happened to Sansa, all the hurt and abuse and frustration</b>, and trying to understand how she would <b>express this yet appear strong</b>. She adapts all she has learnt to her look.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-explains-danys-meaningful-outfits_us_59a4319fe4b06d67e33926b6?ec_carp=8265756527327536922\">The HuffPost</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>The fact that it is a kind of armour or battle dress also represents a further hardening due to the seriousness of the circumstances that Clapton spoke about in the previous season:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\u201c<i><b>There\u2019s war coming.

Still, it is a theory I\u2019m not completely sold but it did make me recall\u00a0this wonderful Magician\u2019s Cloak that Sandy Powell created for Prospera in Julie Taymor\u2019s adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s <i>The Tempest</i>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/247c3d06076c7aa5781609cdff4b0093/tumblr_inline_pnrds4VPX11uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"/></figure><p>This magnificent costume was created from 3.000 pieces of plastic painted and cut to resemble glass-like volcanic rock (<a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2011/02/06/features/outtakes/tempest-costume-piece-could-light-up-an-oscar/\">x</a>) - a sort of combination of obsidian and the basalt rock that is created from cooling lava flows. It is an amazing piece and I just wanted to share it with my dear readers.</p><p><b>Dragon Scales?</b><br/></p><p>Other people have suggested that Sansa\u2019s costume resembles dragon scales - and there is a certain resemblance when we compare the dress to the scales of the dragons in the show.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2608\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/784af4b35c6df13f78f5dc51d27ded17/tumblr_inline_pnud5bXwfm1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2608\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>However, this issue of dragon scales regarding Sansa\u2019s new costume really ought to be discussed in relation to previous costumes that features elements meant to evoke dragon scales, not the dragons themselves - as they belong to a coherent body of work created by costumier Michele Clapton and embroiderer Michele Carragher.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2577\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9866242e8ac6ba0eff1d48743674fac5/tumblr_inline_pnud62hZpi1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2577\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>The only person that wears dragon scales on her costumes is Daenerys Targaryen, which makes perfect sense since she\u2019s the descendant of the dragon lords of Old Valyria and because she has three living dragons from which she derives her power and her mystique. As we can see from the photos above, Michele Clapton and the embroiderer Michele Carragher have used various techniques over the seasons to evoke dragon scales on Dany\u2019s clothing - from pleating and other fabric manipulation to beading with square Tila beads made of glass as well as pointy metallic sequins.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/414c3ec3e74f8994f60457b6c5e4229d/tumblr_inline_pnwa4bsg081uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"/></figure><p>Stylistically, you could make an argument that Sansa\u2019s black leather scales resemble the soft white cloth scales on Dany\u2019s white queenly dress from season 5. However, in terms of narrative it makes no sense whatsoever for Sansa to suddenly cover herself in dragon scales just because Daenerys enters her narrative.</p><p>In her quest to fit in, Sansa has always been very influenced by other people and her costumes mirror her journey towards finding out who she is as Clapton explains:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cInitially we see her try to emulate Cersei in her costumes, and then when that starts going wrong she sort of stalls and her colors start drifting back towards blue. But they\u2019re not quite blue, they\u2019re mauve. <b>Wherever she goes, she\u2019s sort of pulled in each direction.</b> Finally we see her as Dark Sansa, when she very dramatically changes her appearance and darkens her hair, and has a very dark costume.\u201d \u2026 &ldquo; Now we see her back at Winterfell \u2014 <b>I think, slowly, she\u2019s becoming slightly more her own woman rather than always being influenced by those around her</b>. <b>She\u2019s finally finding herself</b>, and it\u2019s really interesting to explore that in Season 7, and it\u2019s exciting.\u201c</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkeelyflaherty%2Ffacts-about-the-game-of-thrones-costumes-you-probably-nev%3Futm_term%3D.je5dAr7OP%23.hbzdAqKzQ&amp;t=MDQ3NTZkOTY4NGM5YmRiYzE1ZjMxYzIxMzIwOTE0YmNmNDg5NDczYSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fcostume-design-quotes-by-michele-clapton-and&amp;m=1\">BuzzFeed</a>) \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Season 8 is the time for Sansa to finally have found herself - to know herself and what she wants, which is going to be expressed in her costumes and her hair styles:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nFor so long, <b>Sansa\u2019s hair changed season by season depending on who was influencing her</b>. The first few episodes she was a Northerner in Winterfell and took after her mother with a simple braid down the back. Then when she went to King\u2019s Landing it was a big, decadent halo that was very much like what the Queen wore. With Littlefinger, she dyes her hair black and wears all black. Then she goes back to Winterfell and returns to her mother\u2019s hair. <b>She created her own identity in season 7 and that kind of runs through to season 8. She\u2019s chosen how she wants her hair to be, and she\u2019s finally the leader and influencer instead of being influenced by everyone else. </b></i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/hair/sophie-turner-hair-color\">InStyle</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>This quote is about Sansa\u2019s hair style but it will certainly also apply to her costumes because Clapton creates her designs to visually express the character\u2019s narrative journeys. And Sophie Turner has hinted that in this final season, Sansa has indeed come to know herself:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nThe past few seasons for her and the whole series for her, <b>she\u2019s kind of been somewhat lost </b>as a matter of where she wants to be, who she wants to be, who she wants to surround herself with, and <b>this season she is very very self-assured. She knows what she wants. She knows what she stands for. She knows who she wants to be around</b>, and she faces threats to that this season. </i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/sophie-turner-and-maisie-williams-game-of-thrones-self-care.html\">Vulture</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>So, no - Sansa Stark\u2019s scaly new battle dress doesn\u2019t represent dragon scales because it makes absolutely no narrative sense for her to suddenly adopt a Targaryen style. Her narrative arc has been a long journey back towards her roots but also a journey of self-discovery, a tempering of character by way of much hardship.</p><p><b>Fish or Fowl?</b></p><p>If the leather scales on this costume evoke neither dragonglass nor dragon scales, what do they refer to? As seen below, the texture of the dress looks very similar to both raven feather and fish scales.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/18b17d42ca69f494ad0d5fd5c9a52842/tumblr_inline_pnud6zIrtl1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>Sansa has worn feathers before and she has had a lot of winged imagery - in the form of dragonflies, moths, and raven feathers in her costuming whilst she has been called \u201cLittle Dove\u201d by Cersei and \u201cLittle Bird\u201d by the Hound in the dialogue of the show. Narratively, there\u2019s a precedent for her new dress to evoke feathers and the individual flaps looks to have textured surfaces in a manner that looks a bit feathery. The iridescence in the photos also reminds one of raven feathers but it is hard to tell whether this blue sheen is an effect of lighting and Photoshop or whether it comes from some kind of surface treatment of the material or whether the leather is more of a midnight blue than jet-black. It is very hard to tell.</p><h2><b>THE TULLY CONNECTION</b></h2><p>Despite the bird imagery in Sansa\u2019s narrative arc and the use of feathers in her previous costumes, I don\u2019t think that we should dismiss the possibility that the texture on her new dress is meant to evoke fish scales. After all, her mother was born a Tully of Riverrun. The sigil of House Tully is a trout and in the show their armour is made of textured leather flaps assembled to evoke fish scales!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8be1b5d9d6da581b7ad89da44e743e5/tumblr_inline_pnrbteOxTo1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>If we take a closer look at the armour that Edmure and Brynden Tully wear, you can see that it is made of layered flaps of stiff leather - and that each flap is been embossed to create a pattern of raised bumps, giving the whole ensemble an extra layer of texture. The similarities of both pattern and material between Sansa\u2019s dress and the Tully armour makes a compelling argument that this battle dress is a female variation on the traditional armour of her mother\u2019s House.</p><p>So why would Sansa, who as Lady of Winterfell is the head of House Stark, wear something that looks like Tully armour? As said, Sansa\u2019s mother Catelyn was born a Tully of Riverrun and since the end of season 2, Sansa has included elements of her mother\u2019s style and symbols of her mother\u2019s heritage in her clothing and her hair style.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1704\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5cf6b579cabbbd12f7bb03ff20e9519/tumblr_inline_pnwgg2UHwl1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1704\"/></figure><p>From the end of season 2 to the end of season 4, Sansa wears her dresses and her hair in the style of her mother (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/182432528629/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-17\">x</a>). Sansa styling herself as her mother in King\u2019s Landing is way for her to signal her distance from Cersei\u2019s toxic wisdom. Sansa doesn\u2019t want to look like the woman who not only turns the blind eye to Joffrey\u2019s abuse of her but who herself delights in tormenting the girl emotionally. Whereas Sansa started to emulate Cersei\u2019s style before she knew any better, she now models herself on her mother (<i>\u201dI must be as strong as my lady mother\u201d</i> - AGoT, Sansa V).</p><p>In season 5, Sansa returns to Winterfell, sold into a marriage with her family\u2019s enemy. After a brief and drastic change of style (\u201dDarkSansa\u201d), she reverts to her mother\u2019s style again - the dresses are of the same cut and she dons a double embroidered collar such as Catelyn wore. At this point her mother (and most of her family are either dead or missing) and therefore Sansa does homage to her lost family by incorporating elements associated with them in her white wedding dress:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n&quot;It\u2019s Sansa trying to respect everyone that\u2019s been before her. <b>She finally feels like she can make Winterfell a family home again. So I wanted to incorporate pieces that represented her family.</b>&rdquo; </i>(Michele Clapton, <i>Fashionista</i>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>She pays a special homage to her late mother by wearing a set of silver clasps in the shape of the Tully trout. Her mother had worn similar clasps but in season 2 the observant viewer can see that she left a few behind at Winterfell.</p><p>In season 6, Sansa once more turns to the style of her mother in order to reclaim her identity as a Stark after all the abuse she has endured. Thus, when she travels the North with Jon to raise troops in order to retake Winterfell, she is styled in a way that visually echoes Catelyn Stark\u2019s style.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2277ba7846d3e2eaad31b3367802d1f4/tumblr_inline_pny9p7J5Cp1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"/></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s dress of teal velvet is the same colour of one of the dresses that Catelyn wore in season 1 and she wears a silver and black fur cape over her cloak, just like her mother.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;She has these amazing green dresses.

Another very interesting feature is the way that the stylized fur of the wolf morphs into a more scaly pattern where the iridescence of the mother of pearl beads clearly evoke fish scales. So while feathers have been more prominent in Sansa\u2019s costuming so far, the fish scales have been used as well - but in a much more subtle manner!</p><p>Sansa\u2019s wardrobe takes a more plain and practical turn in season 7 with a new silhouette and colour palette. Her gowns are grey, in more rough-spun and heavy fabrics - and she no longer embellishes her dresses with beaded embroidery. Winter and war is here - and there\u2019s no room for frivolity. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t a subtle nod to her Tully heritage - now it is just expressed through the textures of her clothes.</p><blockquote><p>\u201d<i>Within each of their costumes, there are influences.

However, <b>throughout the seasons Michele Clapton has ensured that Catelyn Stark has remained an unspoken presence with her eldest daughter - a presence expressed through the way that Sansa styles herself.</b></p><p>Until now, the Tully connection in Sansa\u2019s costumes has always been a very personal one - referencing her mother Catelyn. She has worn colours, silhouettes and jewellery in her mother\u2019s style and her some textures, patterns and embroidery has had subtle references to the Tully sigil. However, while Sansa\u2019s new leather dress looks like a female version of the traditional Tully armour, it is not a style that has ever been associated with Catelyn\u2019s personal look! So while this dress can be interpreted as an homage to her murdered mother (<a href=\"https://www.inquisitr.com/5318889/sansa-stark-got-season-8-poster-photos/\">x</a>), its symbolism encompass more than the memory of a beloved parent.</p><h2>A Tully armour dress is also a political statement!</h2><p>Sansa is, according to Clapton, a person who\u00a0<i>\u201ctends to express herself visually\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65fYoMINx00\">x</a>) and on <i>Game of Thrones</i> fashion choices are always meaningful:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>Everything \u2013 even a fashion choice \u2013 has meaning on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d </b>In this cutthroat world where men fight for the Iron Throne and the women yield a different kind of power, <b>a choice of fabric or a different cut of cloth can be a political statement, costume designer Michele Clapton told TODAY.com</b></i><b>.\u00a0</b>(Michele Clapton,\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fstyle%2Fwhat-expect-costumes-season-3-game-thrones-1C9143460&amp;t=YTMwZTU5MjllNmQ3NTU4MjAzYzI2Y2I1NjBkZjMxYWY3YTUxNDEwOSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Today</a>) \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Though the style of this costume may invoke several different meanings, I am of the opinion it is first and foremost a nod to the heraldic sigil of House Tully because the stylistic similarities between Sansa\u2019s dress and the Tully armour are so strong. This raises some very interesting possibilities in terms of what may happen in the story - because we have to ask ourselves: Why would Lady Stark wear a garment that invokes the sigil of House Tully?</p><p>At this point in the story, Sansa has accrued quite a bit of political influence. The Northern lords have become rather impressed with her during her tenure as Jon\u2019s regent, she also has the allegiance of the Knights of the Vale through Lord Royce. That is two major regions that she has in her pocket so to speak. However, her mother\u2019s heritage may also become politically important - after all, her uncle is Lord of Riverrun. House Tully hasn\u2019t had much of a presence in the story after the Red Wedding and we last saw Edmure Tully in season 6 where he yielded Riverrun to Jaime Lannister. Will House Tully have a role to play in this final season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>? It seems so because Tobias Menzies has been confirmed to appear in the first episode of the last season, along with the actor who plays the Robert Arryn, the young Lord of the Vale (<a href=\"https://winteriscoming.net/2019/02/14/hbo-schedule-reveals-full-season-8-cast-with-some-surprising-returns/\">x</a>). Thus, two political figures with personal ties to Sansa is set to enter the political arena - and it is very likely that Sansa\u2019s impressive fish scale battle dress is related to this.</p><p>To be continued&hellip;</p>",

However, we were all thrilled that to know that she got a new costume because at that point the teaser trailers and the still photos only showed Sansa wearing costumes from season 7.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3dabce3be9f020ea861a78f0ed8fdd1/tumblr_inline_pnoohnp01U1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>The costumes in question were the charcoal dress with the feathered bodice and another grey piece with patterned fabric.

I\u2019m can\u2019t wait to see it on the screen, in motion, because it promises to be a show-stopping piece.</p><p>The question is, of course, whether this dress is the costume that Sophie Turner refers to - but unless she has two jet-black leather costumes, I think it is safe to say that this textured leather dress is the armour costume that Turner refers to. However, it doesn\u2019t look armour in a practical sense - it is not a garment that will block a weapon. Rather, it is a protective garment in a more symbolic sense. The leather dress covers the actress from neck to ankle and it incorporates the heavy leather belt that wraps around her torso, which is an element that was designed to convey how Sansa emotionally protects herself after all the abuse she has suffered:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAll the characters\u2019 costumes are a consequence of the journey and lifestyle,\u201d Clapton states, particularly referencing a favorite piece of hers \u2014 <b>Sansa\u2019s belt</b>. \u201cThis is her<b> taking back control of her body</b>. I designed it to <b>wrap around over her side-laced dress</b> to<b> represent the</b> <b>absolute removal of any possible physical touch</b>. Her <b>dresses are also tightly-laced on, incredibly difficult to remove.</b>\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/02/20/sophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8/\">Making Game of Thrones</a>)<br></p><p><i>\u201cWith one of the key pieces this year, <b>I wanted it to look as if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress\u2014like there was no way in. </b>So I designed a belt that comes around the neck, across the chest and around the waist. She\u2019s trying to protect herself from all the awfulness that\u2019s happened.<b> It\u2019s a form of armor.</b> It will be interesting to see how that moves forward.\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\">Elle</a>)</p></blockquote><p>With this new dress we see the same effect. Sansa\u2019s body is tightly bound and completely encased in this second skin of leather - and that certainly plays into the idea that Sansa\u2019s costumes express how she\u2019s building walls to protect herself. However, Sophie Turner also said something interesting about this new dress:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cWe the idea of it being very protective and she buttons herself up,\u201d Turner says. \u201cI wanted her to have a bit of armor and be a bit more warrior like. <b>She\u2019s like the warrior of Winterfell</b>.\u201d</i> (Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2F2019%2F02%2F20%2Fsophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8%2F&amp;t=ZWJjMDlhNzgxMGVkZTcyY2M4ZDBiYjY5NjU0ZDliNGYwNDJkNWU1NyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-preliminary-thoughts-on&amp;m=1\">EW</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>So Sansa is still armoured - but it isn\u2019t just about keeping people at arm\u2019s length anymore but also a reflection of the fact that battle against the Army of the Dead is finally here and that she is ready for war. So it is about protection but also <i>a battle dress</i> signalling that Sansa is a leader, a warrior of Winterfell on the symbolic level. She isn\u2019t going to wield a sword but she is involved in organizing the defense, we saw that in season 7.</p><p>There\u2019s a stylistic continuity to the new costume in that it has almost the same silhouette as her season 7 costumes. It is the colour and the material that has changed. The only other difference is the absence of the shoulder tabs that characterized Sansa\u2019s dresses in season 7. We don\u2019t know when Sansa will wear this new black leather dress but I think she\u2019ll wear it in the 2nd and/or 3rd episode (when the big battle most likely will take place at Winterfell). <b>I don\u2019t think this dress will incarnate Sansa\u2019s final style at the end of the story.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/64860807783d2c865ce0e8843ef4c8a6/tumblr_inline_pnv574ztVL1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p><b>I my opinion, this is very much a transitional costume.</b> It keeps the general silhouette of her season 7 costumes with the high neck and the hidden side-lacing on the front of the bodice. It also keeps the belt and it looks as though the feathers that adorns the bodice of the season 7 dress has spread entirely over the new black dress. So, no, this is most likely not Sansa\u2019s only new costume nor the final one she\u2019ll wear on the show.</p><h2><b>A MATTER OF TEXTURE</b></h2><p>As the photos show, Sansa\u2019s new black gown is heavily textured - an effect that is created by what looks to a multitude of tiny leather flaps sewn together to create a kind of scaly appearance. This texture is really what draws the eye, mainly because it covers the entire dress but also because the material is very different from the more muted and discrete textures of Sansa\u2019s season 7 costumes (@lostlittlesatellites has written a great <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181846188337/a-ladys-armor-part-2\">essay</a> on the subject of the textures in the season 7 costumes).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2364\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6728457273566fd000f1a947ea61e8c5/tumblr_inline_pnrbrfGoqF1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2364\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>The question is: Is this visually extravagant texture just an aesthetic feature or does it have symbolic meaning? The answer is: Yes! Michele Clapton has always approached costume design in terms of narrative where patterns, colours and embroidery all tell a story about the characters. However, in regard to season 7 she really emphasized how the costumes are saturated with meaning:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We try to be really <b>symbolic about everything</b> everyone wears now.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>So when every detail is has meaning, when the elements of a costume are symbolic, what does the scaly texture of Sansa\u2019s black leather dress signify? There are several options, which I\u2019ll consider in the following section.</p><p><b>Dragonglass?</b></p><p>I\u2019ve seen several people mention dragonglass (obsidian) in relation to this dress, probably due to the bluish iridescence we can see in the photos and because the dress has been described as armour and obsidian is a hard substance that can protect people against the White Walkers.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ef0c9013eb6c1138073cd3b6ca2b63d/tumblr_inline_pnrbrxNvIg1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>There is a certain resemblance when we put a photo of the dress and a piece of chipped obsidian side by side - and there certainly is a similarity between the blue tint of this dress and the way dragonglass looks in the cold North (where the scenes are often filmed with a blue tint).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1886\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4bc8613aa08db3febd3e75b77d3942d8/tumblr_inline_pnzr0d6Q0Y1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1886\"></figure><p>The dress appears blue-black and very shiny in the photos but we have to take into account that the lighting for a photo shoot is much stronger than the lighting on the show and we also have to remember that the photos have been through a photo editing program, which may have enhanced the bluish shine.\u00a0It is possible that the leather isn\u2019t jet-black like Sophie said but has a bluish tint and it is possible that it has been treated in a way that makes it reflect light more than usual. It is hard to tell what is Photoshop, what is an effect of the lighting and what is the dress itself with the pictures we have - even when we zoom in on a photo taken in daylight.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"548\" data-orig-height=\"310\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a43ff65e3d24df5e00efc9432789962c/tumblr_inline_pnv0xtGeyc1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"548\" data-orig-height=\"310\"></figure><p>However, jet-black is a <i>glossy</i> black colour - and if the leather is shiny and glossy as all the photos strongly suggest, then reflected light will show up as dark blue.\u00a0</p><p>Initially, I wasn\u2019t really sold on the idea that that this dress could evoke dragonglass but in a private discussion\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> presented some interesting arguments, such as the visual similarities between the dragonglass in Gendry\u2019s smithy (seen in the trailer) and the photos of Sansa\u2019s dress. She also suggested that a dragonglass reference could work as an image of strength but also as another type of\u00a0\u201cglass\u201d as a foil to the brittle glass pieces that adorns Cersei\u2019s season 7 costumes (<a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"667\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/189d2fd6796a9c6d0500b98edb911cea/tumblr_inline_pnzy9r1WZq1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"667\"></figure><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c</i><i>I mean with Cersei<b> I wanted to show this brittleness to her</b>.

Narratively, they are foils to each other so if Cersei\u2019s excessive adornment signals a brittle strength, then Sansa\u2019s unadorned but textured gown externalizes an inner strength that has evolved over the course of her story. This is, after all, power dressing taken to the ninth degree.</p><p>I\u2019m still not quite sold on the dragonglass argument since the stylistic elements of the dress echo elements that have previously been associated with Sansa - feathers from her time in the Eyrie and fish scales as a nod to her Tully heritage through her mother. I\u2019ve mentioned that I think this is a transitional dress and as such it builds on the stylistic and symbolic approach that Clapton took with Sansa\u2019s costumes in season 7 where they visually express all of the things that has happened to her - the abuse and the lessons:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c\u2026she\u2019s bringing all that she\u2019s been through to her costume.\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton,<i>\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">The Insider</a>)<br></p><p>\n\n<i> I was trying to grasp <b>all that has happened to Sansa, all the hurt and abuse and frustration</b>, and trying to understand how she would <b>express this yet appear strong</b>.

Still, it is a theory I\u2019m not completely sold but it did make me recall\u00a0this wonderful Magician\u2019s Cloak that Sandy Powell created for Prospera in Julie Taymor\u2019s adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s <i>The Tempest</i>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/247c3d06076c7aa5781609cdff4b0093/tumblr_inline_pnrds4VPX11uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"></figure><p>This magnificent costume was created from 3.000 pieces of plastic painted and cut to resemble glass-like volcanic rock (<a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2011/02/06/features/outtakes/tempest-costume-piece-could-light-up-an-oscar/\">x</a>) - a sort of combination of obsidian and the basalt rock that is created from cooling lava flows. It is an amazing piece and I just wanted to share it with my dear readers.</p><p><b>Dragon Scales?</b><br></p><p>Other people have suggested that Sansa\u2019s costume resembles dragon scales - and there is a certain resemblance when we compare the dress to the scales of the dragons in the show.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2608\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/784af4b35c6df13f78f5dc51d27ded17/tumblr_inline_pnud5bXwfm1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2608\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>However, this issue of dragon scales regarding Sansa\u2019s new costume really ought to be discussed in relation to previous costumes that features elements meant to evoke dragon scales, not the dragons themselves - as they belong to a coherent body of work created by costumier Michele Clapton and embroiderer Michele Carragher.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2577\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9866242e8ac6ba0eff1d48743674fac5/tumblr_inline_pnud62hZpi1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2577\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>The only person that wears dragon scales on her costumes is Daenerys Targaryen, which makes perfect sense since she\u2019s the descendant of the dragon lords of Old Valyria and because she has three living dragons from which she derives her power and her mystique. As we can see from the photos above, Michele Clapton and the embroiderer Michele Carragher have used various techniques over the seasons to evoke dragon scales on Dany\u2019s clothing - from pleating and other fabric manipulation to beading with square Tila beads made of glass as well as pointy metallic sequins.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/414c3ec3e74f8994f60457b6c5e4229d/tumblr_inline_pnwa4bsg081uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>Stylistically, you could make an argument that Sansa\u2019s black leather scales resemble the soft white cloth scales on Dany\u2019s white queenly dress from season 5. However, in terms of narrative it makes no sense whatsoever for Sansa to suddenly cover herself in dragon scales just because Daenerys enters her narrative.</p><p>In her quest to fit in, Sansa has always been very influenced by other people and her costumes mirror her journey towards finding out who she is as Clapton explains:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cInitially we see her try to emulate Cersei in her costumes, and then when that starts going wrong she sort of stalls and her colors start drifting back towards blue. But they\u2019re not quite blue, they\u2019re mauve. <b>Wherever she goes, she\u2019s sort of pulled in each direction.</b> Finally we see her as Dark Sansa, when she very dramatically changes her appearance and darkens her hair, and has a very dark costume.\u201d \u2026 \u201c Now we see her back at Winterfell \u2014 <b>I think, slowly, she\u2019s becoming slightly more her own woman rather than always being influenced by those around her</b>. <b>She\u2019s finally finding herself</b>, and it\u2019s really interesting to explore that in Season 7, and it\u2019s exciting.\u201c</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkeelyflaherty%2Ffacts-about-the-game-of-thrones-costumes-you-probably-nev%3Futm_term%3D.je5dAr7OP%23.hbzdAqKzQ&amp;t=MDQ3NTZkOTY4NGM5YmRiYzE1ZjMxYzIxMzIwOTE0YmNmNDg5NDczYSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fcostume-design-quotes-by-michele-clapton-and&amp;m=1\">BuzzFeed</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Season 8 is the time for Sansa to finally have found herself - to know herself and what she wants, which is going to be expressed in her costumes and her hair styles:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nFor so long, <b>Sansa\u2019s hair changed season by season depending on who was influencing her</b>. The first few episodes she was a Northerner in Winterfell and took after her mother with a simple braid down the back. Then when she went to King\u2019s Landing it was a big, decadent halo that was very much like what the Queen wore. With Littlefinger, she dyes her hair black and wears all black. Then she goes back to Winterfell and returns to her mother\u2019s hair. <b>She created her own identity in season 7 and that kind of runs through to season 8. She\u2019s chosen how she wants her hair to be, and she\u2019s finally the leader and influencer instead of being influenced by everyone else. </b></i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/hair/sophie-turner-hair-color\">InStyle</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>This quote is about Sansa\u2019s hair style but it will certainly also apply to her costumes because Clapton creates her designs to visually express the character\u2019s narrative journeys. And Sophie Turner has hinted that in this final season, Sansa has indeed come to know herself:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nThe past few seasons for her and the whole series for her, <b>she\u2019s kind of been somewhat lost </b>as a matter of where she wants to be, who she wants to be, who she wants to surround herself with, and <b>this season she is very very self-assured. She knows what she wants. She knows what she stands for. She knows who she wants to be around</b>, and she faces threats to that this season. </i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/sophie-turner-and-maisie-williams-game-of-thrones-self-care.html\">Vulture</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>So, no - Sansa Stark\u2019s scaly new battle dress doesn\u2019t represent dragon scales because it makes absolutely no narrative sense for her to suddenly adopt a Targaryen style. Her narrative arc has been a long journey back towards her roots but also a journey of self-discovery, a tempering of character by way of much hardship.</p><p><b>Fish or Fowl?</b></p><p>If the leather scales on this costume evoke neither dragonglass nor dragon scales, what do they refer to? As seen below, the texture of the dress looks very similar to both raven feather and fish scales.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/18b17d42ca69f494ad0d5fd5c9a52842/tumblr_inline_pnud6zIrtl1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>Sansa has worn feathers before and she has had a lot of winged imagery - in the form of dragonflies, moths, and raven feathers in her costuming whilst she has been called \u201cLittle Dove\u201d by Cersei and \u201cLittle Bird\u201d by the Hound in the dialogue of the show. Narratively, there\u2019s a precedent for her new dress to evoke feathers and the individual flaps looks to have textured surfaces in a manner that looks a bit feathery. The iridescence in the photos also reminds one of raven feathers but it is hard to tell whether this blue sheen is an effect of lighting and Photoshop or whether it comes from some kind of surface treatment of the material or whether the leather is more of a midnight blue than jet-black. It is very hard to tell.</p><h2><b>THE TULLY CONNECTION</b></h2><p>Despite the bird imagery in Sansa\u2019s narrative arc and the use of feathers in her previous costumes, I don\u2019t think that we should dismiss the possibility that the texture on her new dress is meant to evoke fish scales. After all, her mother was born a Tully of Riverrun. The sigil of House Tully is a trout and in the show their armour is made of textured leather flaps assembled to evoke fish scales!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8be1b5d9d6da581b7ad89da44e743e5/tumblr_inline_pnrbteOxTo1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>If we take a closer look at the armour that Edmure and Brynden Tully wear, you can see that it is made of layered flaps of stiff leather - and that each flap is been embossed to create a pattern of raised bumps, giving the whole ensemble an extra layer of texture. The similarities of both pattern and material between Sansa\u2019s dress and the Tully armour makes a compelling argument that this battle dress is a female variation on the traditional armour of her mother\u2019s House.</p><p>So why would Sansa, who as Lady of Winterfell is the head of House Stark, wear something that looks like Tully armour? As said, Sansa\u2019s mother Catelyn was born a Tully of Riverrun and since the end of season 2, Sansa has included elements of her mother\u2019s style and symbols of her mother\u2019s heritage in her clothing and her hair style.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1704\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5cf6b579cabbbd12f7bb03ff20e9519/tumblr_inline_pnwgg2UHwl1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1704\"></figure><p>From the end of season 2 to the end of season 4, Sansa wears her dresses and her hair in the style of her mother (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/182432528629/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-17\">x</a>). Sansa styling herself as her mother in King\u2019s Landing is way for her to signal her distance from Cersei\u2019s toxic wisdom. Sansa doesn\u2019t want to look like the woman who not only turns the blind eye to Joffrey\u2019s abuse of her but who herself delights in tormenting the girl emotionally. Whereas Sansa started to emulate Cersei\u2019s style before she knew any better, she now models herself on her mother (<i>\u201dI must be as strong as my lady mother\u201d</i> - AGoT, Sansa V).</p><p>In season 5, Sansa returns to Winterfell, sold into a marriage with her family\u2019s enemy. After a brief and drastic change of style (\u201dDarkSansa\u201d), she reverts to her mother\u2019s style again - the dresses are of the same cut and she dons a double embroidered collar such as Catelyn wore. At this point her mother (and most of her family are either dead or missing) and therefore Sansa does homage to her lost family by incorporating elements associated with them in her white wedding dress:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\"It\u2019s Sansa trying to respect everyone that\u2019s been before her. <b>She finally feels like she can make Winterfell a family home again. So I wanted to incorporate pieces that represented her family.</b>\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <i>Fashionista</i>)<br></p></blockquote><p>She pays a special homage to her late mother by wearing a set of silver clasps in the shape of the Tully trout. Her mother had worn similar clasps but in season 2 the observant viewer can see that she left a few behind at Winterfell.</p><p>In season 6, Sansa once more turns to the style of her mother in order to reclaim her identity as a Stark after all the abuse she has endured. Thus, when she travels the North with Jon to raise troops in order to retake Winterfell, she is styled in a way that visually echoes Catelyn Stark\u2019s style.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2277ba7846d3e2eaad31b3367802d1f4/tumblr_inline_pny9p7J5Cp1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s dress of teal velvet is the same colour of one of the dresses that Catelyn wore in season 1 and she wears a silver and black fur cape over her cloak, just like her mother.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cShe has these amazing green dresses.

Another very interesting feature is the way that the stylized fur of the wolf morphs into a more scaly pattern where the iridescence of the mother of pearl beads clearly evoke fish scales. So while feathers have been more prominent in Sansa\u2019s costuming so far, the fish scales have been used as well - but in a much more subtle manner!</p><p>Sansa\u2019s wardrobe takes a more plain and practical turn in season 7 with a new silhouette and colour palette. Her gowns are grey, in more rough-spun and heavy fabrics - and she no longer embellishes her dresses with beaded embroidery. Winter and war is here - and there\u2019s no room for frivolity. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t a subtle nod to her Tully heritage - now it is just expressed through the textures of her clothes.</p><blockquote><p>\u201d<i>Within each of their costumes, there are influences.

However, <b>throughout the seasons Michele Clapton has ensured that Catelyn Stark has remained an unspoken presence with her eldest daughter - a presence expressed through the way that Sansa styles herself.</b></p><p>Until now, the Tully connection in Sansa\u2019s costumes has always been a very personal one - referencing her mother Catelyn. She has worn colours, silhouettes and jewellery in her mother\u2019s style and her some textures, patterns and embroidery has had subtle references to the Tully sigil. However, while Sansa\u2019s new leather dress looks like a female version of the traditional Tully armour, it is not a style that has ever been associated with Catelyn\u2019s personal look! So while this dress can be interpreted as an homage to her murdered mother (<a href=\"https://www.inquisitr.com/5318889/sansa-stark-got-season-8-poster-photos/\">x</a>), its symbolism encompass more than the memory of a beloved parent.</p><h2>A Tully armour dress is also a political statement!</h2><p>Sansa is, according to Clapton, a person who\u00a0<i>\u201ctends to express herself visually\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65fYoMINx00\">x</a>) and on <i>Game of Thrones</i> fashion choices are always meaningful:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>Everything \u2013 even a fashion choice \u2013 has meaning on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d </b>In this cutthroat world where men fight for the Iron Throne and the women yield a different kind of power, <b>a choice of fabric or a different cut of cloth can be a political statement, costume designer Michele Clapton told TODAY.com</b></i><b>.\u00a0</b>(Michele Clapton,\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fstyle%2Fwhat-expect-costumes-season-3-game-thrones-1C9143460&amp;t=YTMwZTU5MjllNmQ3NTU4MjAzYzI2Y2I1NjBkZjMxYWY3YTUxNDEwOSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Today</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Though the style of this costume may invoke several different meanings, I am of the opinion it is first and foremost a nod to the heraldic sigil of House Tully because the stylistic similarities between Sansa\u2019s dress and the Tully armour are so strong. This raises some very interesting possibilities in terms of what may happen in the story - because we have to ask ourselves: Why would Lady Stark wear a garment that invokes the sigil of House Tully?</p><p>At this point in the story, Sansa has accrued quite a bit of political influence. The Northern lords have become rather impressed with her during her tenure as Jon\u2019s regent, she also has the allegiance of the Knights of the Vale through Lord Royce. That is two major regions that she has in her pocket so to speak. However, her mother\u2019s heritage may also become politically important - after all, her uncle is Lord of Riverrun. House Tully hasn\u2019t had much of a presence in the story after the Red Wedding and we last saw Edmure Tully in season 6 where he yielded Riverrun to Jaime Lannister. Will House Tully have a role to play in this final season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>? It seems so because Tobias Menzies has been confirmed to appear in the first episode of the last season, along with the actor who plays the Robert Arryn, the young Lord of the Vale (<a href=\"https://winteriscoming.net/2019/02/14/hbo-schedule-reveals-full-season-8-cast-with-some-surprising-returns/\">x</a>). Thus, two political figures with personal ties to Sansa is set to enter the political arena - and it is very likely that Sansa\u2019s impressive fish scale battle dress is related to this.</p><p>To be continued\u2026</p></p>",

However, it doesn\u2019t look armour in a practical sense - it is not a garment that will block a weapon. Rather, it is a protective garment in a more symbolic sense. The leather dress covers the actress from neck to ankle and it incorporates the heavy leather belt that wraps around her torso, which is an element that was designed to convey how Sansa emotionally protects herself after all the abuse she has suffered:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAll the characters\u2019 costumes are a consequence of the journey and lifestyle,\u201d Clapton states, particularly referencing a favorite piece of hers \u2014 <b>Sansa\u2019s belt</b>. \u201cThis is her<b> taking back control of her body</b>. I designed it to <b>wrap around over her side-laced dress</b> to<b> represent the</b> <b>absolute removal of any possible physical touch</b>.

She\u2019s trying to protect herself from all the awfulness that\u2019s happened.<b> It\u2019s a form of armor.</b> It will be interesting to see how that moves forward.\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\">Elle</a>)</p></blockquote><p>With this new dress we see the same effect. Sansa\u2019s body is tightly bound and completely encased in this second skin of leather - and that certainly plays into the idea that Sansa\u2019s costumes express how she\u2019s building walls to protect herself. However, Sophie Turner also said something interesting about this new dress:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cWe the idea of it being very protective and she buttons herself up,\u201d Turner says. \u201cI wanted her to have a bit of armor and be a bit more warrior like. <b>She\u2019s like the warrior of Winterfell</b>.\u201d</i> (Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2F2019%2F02%2F20%2Fsophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8%2F&amp;t=ZWJjMDlhNzgxMGVkZTcyY2M4ZDBiYjY5NjU0ZDliNGYwNDJkNWU1NyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-preliminary-thoughts-on&amp;m=1\">EW</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>So Sansa is still armoured - but it isn\u2019t just about keeping people at arm\u2019s length anymore but also a reflection of the fact that battle against the Army of the Dead is finally here and that she is ready for war. So it is about protection but also <i>a battle dress</i> signalling that Sansa is a leader, a warrior of Winterfell on the symbolic level. She isn\u2019t going to wield a sword but she is involved in organizing the defense, we saw that in season 7.</p><p>There\u2019s a stylistic continuity to the new costume in that it has almost the same silhouette as her season 7 costumes. It is the colour and the material that has changed. The only other difference is the absence of the shoulder tabs that characterized Sansa\u2019s dresses in season 7. We don\u2019t know when Sansa will wear this new black leather dress but I think she\u2019ll wear it in the 2nd and/or 3rd episode (when the big battle most likely will take place at Winterfell). <b>I don\u2019t think this dress will incarnate Sansa\u2019s final style at the end of the story.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/64860807783d2c865ce0e8843ef4c8a6/tumblr_inline_pnv574ztVL1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p><b>I my opinion, this is very much a transitional costume.</b> It keeps the general silhouette of her season 7 costumes with the high neck and the hidden side-lacing on the front of the bodice. It also keeps the belt and it looks as though the feathers that adorns the bodice of the season 7 dress has spread entirely over the new black dress. So, no, this is most likely not Sansa\u2019s only new costume nor the final one she\u2019ll wear on the show.</p><h2><b>A MATTER OF TEXTURE</b></h2><p>As the photos show, Sansa\u2019s new black gown is heavily textured - an effect that is created by what looks to a multitude of tiny leather flaps sewn together to create a kind of scaly appearance. This texture is really what draws the eye, mainly because it covers the entire dress but also because the material is very different from the more muted and discrete textures of Sansa\u2019s season 7 costumes (@lostlittlesatellites has written a great <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181846188337/a-ladys-armor-part-2\">essay</a> on the subject of the textures in the season 7 costumes).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2364\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6728457273566fd000f1a947ea61e8c5/tumblr_inline_pnrbrfGoqF1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2364\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>The question is: Is this visually extravagant texture just an aesthetic feature or does it have symbolic meaning? The answer is: Yes! Michele Clapton has always approached costume design in terms of narrative where patterns, colours and embroidery all tell a story about the characters. However, in regard to season 7 she really emphasized how the costumes are saturated with meaning:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We try to be really <b>symbolic about everything</b> everyone wears now.</i>\u201d (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>So when every detail is has meaning, when the elements of a costume are symbolic, what does the scaly texture of Sansa\u2019s black leather dress signify? There are several options, which I\u2019ll consider in the following section.</p><p><b>Dragonglass?</b></p><p>I\u2019ve seen several people mention dragonglass (obsidian) in relation to this dress, probably due to the bluish iridescence we can see in the photos and because the dress has been described as armour and obsidian is a hard substance that can protect people against the White Walkers.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ef0c9013eb6c1138073cd3b6ca2b63d/tumblr_inline_pnrbrxNvIg1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>There is a certain resemblance when we put a photo of the dress and a piece of chipped obsidian side by side - and there certainly is a similarity between the blue tint of this dress and the way dragonglass looks in the cold North (where the scenes are often filmed with a blue tint).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1886\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4bc8613aa08db3febd3e75b77d3942d8/tumblr_inline_pnzr0d6Q0Y1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1886\"></figure><p>The dress appears blue-black and very shiny in the photos but we have to take into account that the lighting for a photo shoot is much stronger than the lighting on the show and we also have to remember that the photos have been through a photo editing program, which may have enhanced the bluish shine.\u00a0It is possible that the leather isn\u2019t jet-black like Sophie said but has a bluish tint and it is possible that it has been treated in a way that makes it reflect light more than usual. It is hard to tell what is Photoshop, what is an effect of the lighting and what is the dress itself with the pictures we have - even when we zoom in on a photo taken in daylight.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"548\" data-orig-height=\"310\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a43ff65e3d24df5e00efc9432789962c/tumblr_inline_pnv0xtGeyc1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"548\" data-orig-height=\"310\"></figure><p>However, jet-black is a <i>glossy</i> black colour - and if the leather is shiny and glossy as all the photos strongly suggest, then reflected light will show up as dark blue.\u00a0</p><p>Initially, I wasn\u2019t really sold on the idea that that this dress could evoke dragonglass but in a private discussion\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> presented some interesting arguments, such as the visual similarities between the dragonglass in Gendry\u2019s smithy (seen in the trailer) and the photos of Sansa\u2019s dress. She also suggested that a dragonglass reference could work as an image of strength but also as another type of\u00a0\u201cglass\u201d as a foil to the brittle glass pieces that adorns Cersei\u2019s season 7 costumes (<a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"667\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/189d2fd6796a9c6d0500b98edb911cea/tumblr_inline_pnzy9r1WZq1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"667\"></figure><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c</i><i>I mean with Cersei<b> I wanted to show this brittleness to her</b>.

Narratively, they are foils to each other so if Cersei\u2019s excessive adornment signals a brittle strength, then Sansa\u2019s unadorned but textured gown externalizes an inner strength that has evolved over the course of her story. This is, after all, power dressing taken to the ninth degree.</p><p>I\u2019m still not quite sold on the dragonglass argument since the stylistic elements of the dress echo elements that have previously been associated with Sansa - feathers from her time in the Eyrie and fish scales as a nod to her Tully heritage through her mother. I\u2019ve mentioned that I think this is a transitional dress and as such it builds on the stylistic and symbolic approach that Clapton took with Sansa\u2019s costumes in season 7 where they visually express all of the things that has happened to her - the abuse and the lessons:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c\u2026she\u2019s bringing all that she\u2019s been through to her costume.\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton,<i>\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">The Insider</a>)<br></p><p>\n\n<i> I was trying to grasp <b>all that has happened to Sansa, all the hurt and abuse and frustration</b>, and trying to understand how she would <b>express this yet appear strong</b>.

Still, it is a theory I\u2019m not completely sold but it did make me recall\u00a0this wonderful Magician\u2019s Cloak that Sandy Powell created for Prospera in Julie Taymor\u2019s adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s <i>The Tempest</i>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/247c3d06076c7aa5781609cdff4b0093/tumblr_inline_pnrds4VPX11uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"></figure><p>This magnificent costume was created from 3.000 pieces of plastic painted and cut to resemble glass-like volcanic rock (<a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2011/02/06/features/outtakes/tempest-costume-piece-could-light-up-an-oscar/\">x</a>) - a sort of combination of obsidian and the basalt rock that is created from cooling lava flows. It is an amazing piece and I just wanted to share it with my dear readers.</p><p><b>Dragon Scales?</b><br></p><p>Other people have suggested that Sansa\u2019s costume resembles dragon scales - and there is a certain resemblance when we compare the dress to the scales of the dragons in the show.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2608\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/784af4b35c6df13f78f5dc51d27ded17/tumblr_inline_pnud5bXwfm1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2608\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>However, this issue of dragon scales regarding Sansa\u2019s new costume really ought to be discussed in relation to previous costumes that features elements meant to evoke dragon scales, not the dragons themselves - as they belong to a coherent body of work created by costumier Michele Clapton and embroiderer Michele Carragher.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2577\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9866242e8ac6ba0eff1d48743674fac5/tumblr_inline_pnud62hZpi1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2577\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>The only person that wears dragon scales on her costumes is Daenerys Targaryen, which makes perfect sense since she\u2019s the descendant of the dragon lords of Old Valyria and because she has three living dragons from which she derives her power and her mystique. As we can see from the photos above, Michele Clapton and the embroiderer Michele Carragher have used various techniques over the seasons to evoke dragon scales on Dany\u2019s clothing - from pleating and other fabric manipulation to beading with square Tila beads made of glass as well as pointy metallic sequins.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/414c3ec3e74f8994f60457b6c5e4229d/tumblr_inline_pnwa4bsg081uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>Stylistically, you could make an argument that Sansa\u2019s black leather scales resemble the soft white cloth scales on Dany\u2019s white queenly dress from season 5. However, in terms of narrative it makes no sense whatsoever for Sansa to suddenly cover herself in dragon scales just because Daenerys enters her narrative.</p><p>In her quest to fit in, Sansa has always been very influenced by other people and her costumes mirror her journey towards finding out who she is as Clapton explains:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cInitially we see her try to emulate Cersei in her costumes, and then when that starts going wrong she sort of stalls and her colors start drifting back towards blue. But they\u2019re not quite blue, they\u2019re mauve. <b>Wherever she goes, she\u2019s sort of pulled in each direction.</b> Finally we see her as Dark Sansa, when she very dramatically changes her appearance and darkens her hair, and has a very dark costume.\u201d \u2026 \u201c Now we see her back at Winterfell \u2014 <b>I think, slowly, she\u2019s becoming slightly more her own woman rather than always being influenced by those around her</b>. <b>She\u2019s finally finding herself</b>, and it\u2019s really interesting to explore that in Season 7, and it\u2019s exciting.\u201c</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkeelyflaherty%2Ffacts-about-the-game-of-thrones-costumes-you-probably-nev%3Futm_term%3D.je5dAr7OP%23.hbzdAqKzQ&amp;t=MDQ3NTZkOTY4NGM5YmRiYzE1ZjMxYzIxMzIwOTE0YmNmNDg5NDczYSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fcostume-design-quotes-by-michele-clapton-and&amp;m=1\">BuzzFeed</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Season 8 is the time for Sansa to finally have found herself - to know herself and what she wants, which is going to be expressed in her costumes and her hair styles:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nFor so long, <b>Sansa\u2019s hair changed season by season depending on who was influencing her</b>. The first few episodes she was a Northerner in Winterfell and took after her mother with a simple braid down the back. Then when she went to King\u2019s Landing it was a big, decadent halo that was very much like what the Queen wore. With Littlefinger, she dyes her hair black and wears all black. Then she goes back to Winterfell and returns to her mother\u2019s hair. <b>She created her own identity in season 7 and that kind of runs through to season 8. She\u2019s chosen how she wants her hair to be, and she\u2019s finally the leader and influencer instead of being influenced by everyone else. </b></i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/hair/sophie-turner-hair-color\">InStyle</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>This quote is about Sansa\u2019s hair style but it will certainly also apply to her costumes because Clapton creates her designs to visually express the character\u2019s narrative journeys. And Sophie Turner has hinted that in this final season, Sansa has indeed come to know herself:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nThe past few seasons for her and the whole series for her, <b>she\u2019s kind of been somewhat lost </b>as a matter of where she wants to be, who she wants to be, who she wants to surround herself with, and <b>this season she is very very self-assured. She knows what she wants. She knows what she stands for. She knows who she wants to be around</b>, and she faces threats to that this season. </i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/sophie-turner-and-maisie-williams-game-of-thrones-self-care.html\">Vulture</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>So, no - Sansa Stark\u2019s scaly new battle dress doesn\u2019t represent dragon scales because it makes absolutely no narrative sense for her to suddenly adopt a Targaryen style. Her narrative arc has been a long journey back towards her roots but also a journey of self-discovery, a tempering of character by way of much hardship.</p><p><b>Fish or Fowl?</b></p><p>If the leather scales on this costume evoke neither dragonglass nor dragon scales, what do they refer to? As seen below, the texture of the dress looks very similar to both raven feather and fish scales.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/18b17d42ca69f494ad0d5fd5c9a52842/tumblr_inline_pnud6zIrtl1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>Sansa has worn feathers before and she has had a lot of winged imagery - in the form of dragonflies, moths, and raven feathers in her costuming whilst she has been called \u201cLittle Dove\u201d by Cersei and \u201cLittle Bird\u201d by the Hound in the dialogue of the show. Narratively, there\u2019s a precedent for her new dress to evoke feathers and the individual flaps looks to have textured surfaces in a manner that looks a bit feathery. The iridescence in the photos also reminds one of raven feathers but it is hard to tell whether this blue sheen is an effect of lighting and Photoshop or whether it comes from some kind of surface treatment of the material or whether the leather is more of a midnight blue than jet-black. It is very hard to tell.</p><h2><b>THE TULLY CONNECTION</b></h2><p>Despite the bird imagery in Sansa\u2019s narrative arc and the use of feathers in her previous costumes, I don\u2019t think that we should dismiss the possibility that the texture on her new dress is meant to evoke fish scales. After all, her mother was born a Tully of Riverrun. The sigil of House Tully is a trout and in the show their armour is made of textured leather flaps assembled to evoke fish scales!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8be1b5d9d6da581b7ad89da44e743e5/tumblr_inline_pnrbteOxTo1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>If we take a closer look at the armour that Edmure and Brynden Tully wear, you can see that it is made of layered flaps of stiff leather - and that each flap is been embossed to create a pattern of raised bumps, giving the whole ensemble an extra layer of texture. The similarities of both pattern and material between Sansa\u2019s dress and the Tully armour makes a compelling argument that this battle dress is a female variation on the traditional armour of her mother\u2019s House.</p><p>So why would Sansa, who as Lady of Winterfell is the head of House Stark, wear something that looks like Tully armour? As said, Sansa\u2019s mother Catelyn was born a Tully of Riverrun and since the end of season 2, Sansa has included elements of her mother\u2019s style and symbols of her mother\u2019s heritage in her clothing and her hair style.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1704\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5cf6b579cabbbd12f7bb03ff20e9519/tumblr_inline_pnwgg2UHwl1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1704\"></figure><p>From the end of season 2 to the end of season 4, Sansa wears her dresses and her hair in the style of her mother (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/182432528629/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-17\">x</a>). Sansa styling herself as her mother in King\u2019s Landing is way for her to signal her distance from Cersei\u2019s toxic wisdom. Sansa doesn\u2019t want to look like the woman who not only turns the blind eye to Joffrey\u2019s abuse of her but who herself delights in tormenting the girl emotionally. Whereas Sansa started to emulate Cersei\u2019s style before she knew any better, she now models herself on her mother (<i>\u201dI must be as strong as my lady mother\u201d</i> - AGoT, Sansa V).</p><p>In season 5, Sansa returns to Winterfell, sold into a marriage with her family\u2019s enemy. After a brief and drastic change of style (\u201dDarkSansa\u201d), she reverts to her mother\u2019s style again - the dresses are of the same cut and she dons a double embroidered collar such as Catelyn wore. At this point her mother (and most of her family are either dead or missing) and therefore Sansa does homage to her lost family by incorporating elements associated with them in her white wedding dress:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\"It\u2019s Sansa trying to respect everyone that\u2019s been before her. <b>She finally feels like she can make Winterfell a family home again. So I wanted to incorporate pieces that represented her family.</b>\u201d </i>(Michele Clapton, <i>Fashionista</i>)<br></p></blockquote><p>She pays a special homage to her late mother by wearing a set of silver clasps in the shape of the Tully trout. Her mother had worn similar clasps but in season 2 the observant viewer can see that she left a few behind at Winterfell.</p><p>In season 6, Sansa once more turns to the style of her mother in order to reclaim her identity as a Stark after all the abuse she has endured. Thus, when she travels the North with Jon to raise troops in order to retake Winterfell, she is styled in a way that visually echoes Catelyn Stark\u2019s style.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2277ba7846d3e2eaad31b3367802d1f4/tumblr_inline_pny9p7J5Cp1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3030\"></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s dress of teal velvet is the same colour of one of the dresses that Catelyn wore in season 1 and she wears a silver and black fur cape over her cloak, just like her mother.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cShe has these amazing green dresses.

So while feathers have been more prominent in Sansa\u2019s costuming so far, the fish scales have been used as well - but in a much more subtle manner!</p><p>Sansa\u2019s wardrobe takes a more plain and practical turn in season 7 with a new silhouette and colour palette. Her gowns are grey, in more rough-spun and heavy fabrics - and she no longer embellishes her dresses with beaded embroidery. Winter and war is here - and there\u2019s no room for frivolity.

However, <b>throughout the seasons Michele Clapton has ensured that Catelyn Stark has remained an unspoken presence with her eldest daughter - a presence expressed through the way that Sansa styles herself.</b></p><p>Until now, the Tully connection in Sansa\u2019s costumes has always been a very personal one - referencing her mother Catelyn. She has worn colours, silhouettes and jewellery in her mother\u2019s style and her some textures, patterns and embroidery has had subtle references to the Tully sigil. However, while Sansa\u2019s new leather dress looks like a female version of the traditional Tully armour, it is not a style that has ever been associated with Catelyn\u2019s personal look! So while this dress can be interpreted as an homage to her murdered mother (<a href=\"https://www.inquisitr.com/5318889/sansa-stark-got-season-8-poster-photos/\">x</a>), its symbolism encompass more than the memory of a beloved parent.</p><h2>A Tully armour dress is also a political statement!</h2><p>Sansa is, according to Clapton, a person who\u00a0<i>\u201ctends to express herself visually\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65fYoMINx00\">x</a>) and on <i>Game of Thrones</i> fashion choices are always meaningful:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>Everything \u2013 even a fashion choice \u2013 has meaning on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d </b>In this cutthroat world where men fight for the Iron Throne and the women yield a different kind of power, <b>a choice of fabric or a different cut of cloth can be a political statement, costume designer Michele Clapton told TODAY.com</b></i><b>.\u00a0</b>(Michele Clapton,\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fstyle%2Fwhat-expect-costumes-season-3-game-thrones-1C9143460&amp;t=YTMwZTU5MjllNmQ3NTU4MjAzYzI2Y2I1NjBkZjMxYWY3YTUxNDEwOSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Today</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Though the style of this costume may invoke several different meanings, I am of the opinion it is first and foremost a nod to the heraldic sigil of House Tully because the stylistic similarities between Sansa\u2019s dress and the Tully armour are so strong. This raises some very interesting possibilities in terms of what may happen in the story - because we have to ask ourselves: Why would Lady Stark wear a garment that invokes the sigil of House Tully?</p><p>At this point in the story, Sansa has accrued quite a bit of political influence. The Northern lords have become rather impressed with her during her tenure as Jon\u2019s regent, she also has the allegiance of the Knights of the Vale through Lord Royce. That is two major regions that she has in her pocket so to speak. However, her mother\u2019s heritage may also become politically important - after all, her uncle is Lord of Riverrun. House Tully hasn\u2019t had much of a presence in the story after the Red Wedding and we last saw Edmure Tully in season 6 where he yielded Riverrun to Jaime Lannister. Will House Tully have a role to play in this final season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>? It seems so because Tobias Menzies has been confirmed to appear in the first episode of the last season, along with the actor who plays the Robert Arryn, the young Lord of the Vale (<a href=\"https://winteriscoming.net/2019/02/14/hbo-schedule-reveals-full-season-8-cast-with-some-surprising-returns/\">x</a>). Thus, two political figures with personal ties to Sansa is set to enter the political arena - and it is very likely that Sansa\u2019s impressive fish scale battle dress is related to this.</p><p>To be continued\u2026</p></p>",

That means teaser trailers, photo shoots and posters - and it also means a sneak peak at some of the new costumes. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Michele Clapton&rsquo;s work on the show so I&rsquo;m really excited to see some of the new costumes, especially for the female characters.&nbsp;</p><p>Not long ago Sophie Turner revealed that Sansa Stark would get an all-black new costume made of leather - and she characterized it as a kind of armour:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;This is the first time I&rsquo;ve had armor,&rdquo; Sophie Turner tells EW.&nbsp;</i><i>The costume is not Jaime Lannister or Brienne of Tarth-style metal armor, but more like <b>a jet-black ensemble made of thick leather or similar material</b>. </i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/02/20/sophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8/\">Entertainment Weekly</a>)</p></blockquote><p>This quote provoked a lot of discussion among Sansa fans - some loved the idea while others hated it. However, we were all thrilled that to know that she got a new costume because at that point the teaser trailers and the still photos only showed Sansa wearing costumes from season 7.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3dabce3be9f020ea861a78f0ed8fdd1/tumblr_inline_pnoohnp01U1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The costumes in question were the charcoal dress with the feathered bodice and another grey piece with patterned fabric.

I&rsquo;m can&rsquo;t wait to see it on the screen, in motion, because it promises to be a show-stopping piece.</p><p>The question is, of course, whether this dress is the costume that Sophie Turner refers to - but unless she has two jet-black leather costumes, I think it is safe to say that this textured leather dress is the armour costume that Turner refers to. However, it doesn&rsquo;t look armour in a practical sense - it is not a garment that will block a weapon. Rather, it is a protective garment in a more symbolic sense. The leather dress covers the actress from neck to ankle and it incorporates the heavy leather belt that wraps around her torso, which is an element that was designed to convey how Sansa emotionally protects herself after all the abuse she has suffered:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;All the characters&rsquo; costumes are a consequence of the journey and lifestyle,&rdquo; Clapton states, particularly referencing a favorite piece of hers &mdash; <b>Sansa&rsquo;s belt</b>. &ldquo;This is her<b> taking back control of her body</b>. I designed it to <b>wrap around over her side-laced dress</b> to<b> represent the</b> <b>absolute removal of any possible physical touch</b>. Her <b>dresses are also tightly-laced on, incredibly difficult to remove.</b>&rdquo; </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/02/20/sophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8/\">Making Game of Thrones</a>)<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;With one of the key pieces this year, <b>I wanted it to look as if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress&mdash;like there was no way in. </b>So I designed a belt that comes around the neck, across the chest and around the waist. She&rsquo;s trying to protect herself from all the awfulness that&rsquo;s happened.<b> It&rsquo;s a form of armor.</b> It will be interesting to see how that moves forward.&rdquo; </i>(Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\">Elle</a>)</p></blockquote><p>With this new dress we see the same effect. Sansa&rsquo;s body is tightly bound and completely encased in this second skin of leather - and that certainly plays into the idea that Sansa&rsquo;s costumes express how she&rsquo;s building walls to protect herself. However, Sophie Turner also said something interesting about this new dress:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;We the idea of it being very protective and she buttons herself up,&rdquo; Turner says. &ldquo;I wanted her to have a bit of armor and be a bit more warrior like. <b>She&rsquo;s like the warrior of Winterfell</b>.&rdquo;</i> (Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2F2019%2F02%2F20%2Fsophie-turner-sansa-armor-game-thrones-season-8%2F&amp;t=ZWJjMDlhNzgxMGVkZTcyY2M4ZDBiYjY5NjU0ZDliNGYwNDJkNWU1NyxaMGdLU2FadA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183118735354%2Farmoured-in-scales-some-preliminary-thoughts-on&amp;m=1\">EW</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>So Sansa is still armoured - but it isn&rsquo;t just about keeping people at arm&rsquo;s length anymore but also a reflection of the fact that battle against the Army of the Dead is finally here and that she is ready for war. So it is about protection but also <i>a battle dress</i> signalling that Sansa is a leader, a warrior of Winterfell on the symbolic level. She isn&rsquo;t going to wield a sword but she is involved in organizing the defense, we saw that in season 7.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a stylistic continuity to the new costume in that it has almost the same silhouette as her season 7 costumes. It is the colour and the material that has changed. The only other difference is the absence of the shoulder tabs that characterized Sansa&rsquo;s dresses in season 7. We don&rsquo;t know when Sansa will wear this new black leather dress but I think she&rsquo;ll wear it in the 2nd and/or 3rd episode (when the big battle most likely will take place at Winterfell). <b>I don&rsquo;t think this dress will incarnate Sansa&rsquo;s final style at the end of the story.</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/64860807783d2c865ce0e8843ef4c8a6/tumblr_inline_pnv574ztVL1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>I my opinion, this is very much a transitional costume.</b> It keeps the general silhouette of her season 7 costumes with the high neck and the hidden side-lacing on the front of the bodice. It also keeps the belt and it looks as though the feathers that adorns the bodice of the season 7 dress has spread entirely over the new black dress. So, no, this is most likely not Sansa&rsquo;s only new costume nor the final one she&rsquo;ll wear on the show.</p><h2><b>A MATTER OF TEXTURE</b></h2><p>As the photos show, Sansa&rsquo;s new black gown is heavily textured - an effect that is created by what looks to a multitude of tiny leather flaps sewn together to create a kind of scaly appearance. This texture is really what draws the eye, mainly because it covers the entire dress but also because the material is very different from the more muted and discrete textures of Sansa&rsquo;s season 7 costumes (@lostlittlesatellites has written a great <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181846188337/a-ladys-armor-part-2\">essay</a> on the subject of the textures in the season 7 costumes).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6728457273566fd000f1a947ea61e8c5/tumblr_inline_pnrbrfGoqF1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The question is: Is this visually extravagant texture just an aesthetic feature or does it have symbolic meaning? The answer is: Yes! Michele Clapton has always approached costume design in terms of narrative where patterns, colours and embroidery all tell a story about the characters. However, in regard to season 7 she really emphasized how the costumes are saturated with meaning:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>We try to be really <b>symbolic about everything</b> everyone wears now.</i>&rdquo; (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">Insider</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>So when every detail is has meaning, when the elements of a costume are symbolic, what does the scaly texture of Sansa&rsquo;s black leather dress signify? There are several options, which I&rsquo;ll consider in the following section.</p><p><b>Dragonglass?</b></p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen several people mention dragonglass (obsidian) in relation to this dress, probably due to the bluish iridescence we can see in the photos and because the dress has been described as armour and obsidian is a hard substance that can protect people against the White Walkers.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ef0c9013eb6c1138073cd3b6ca2b63d/tumblr_inline_pnrbrxNvIg1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There is a certain resemblance when we put a photo of the dress and a piece of chipped obsidian side by side - and there certainly is a similarity between the blue tint of this dress and the way dragonglass looks in the cold North (where the scenes are often filmed with a blue tint).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4bc8613aa08db3febd3e75b77d3942d8/tumblr_inline_pnzr0d6Q0Y1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The dress appears blue-black and very shiny in the photos but we have to take into account that the lighting for a photo shoot is much stronger than the lighting on the show and we also have to remember that the photos have been through a photo editing program, which may have enhanced the bluish shine.&nbsp;It is possible that the leather isn&rsquo;t jet-black like Sophie said but has a bluish tint and it is possible that it has been treated in a way that makes it reflect light more than usual. It is hard to tell what is Photoshop, what is an effect of the lighting and what is the dress itself with the pictures we have - even when we zoom in on a photo taken in daylight.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a43ff65e3d24df5e00efc9432789962c/tumblr_inline_pnv0xtGeyc1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>However, jet-black is a <i>glossy</i> black colour - and if the leather is shiny and glossy as all the photos strongly suggest, then reflected light will show up as dark blue.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, I wasn&rsquo;t really sold on the idea that that this dress could evoke dragonglass but in a private discussion&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> presented some interesting arguments, such as the visual similarities between the dragonglass in Gendry&rsquo;s smithy (seen in the trailer) and the photos of Sansa&rsquo;s dress. She also suggested that a dragonglass reference could work as an image of strength but also as another type of&nbsp;&ldquo;glass&rdquo; as a foil to the brittle glass pieces that adorns Cersei&rsquo;s season 7 costumes (<a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">x</a>).&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/189d2fd6796a9c6d0500b98edb911cea/tumblr_inline_pnzy9r1WZq1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;</i><i>I mean with Cersei<b> I wanted to show this brittleness to her</b>. So I started adding these <b>jagged edges and points to what she was wearing</b>.

Narratively, they are foils to each other so if Cersei&rsquo;s excessive adornment signals a brittle strength, then Sansa&rsquo;s unadorned but textured gown externalizes an inner strength that has evolved over the course of her story. This is, after all, power dressing taken to the ninth degree.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still not quite sold on the dragonglass argument since the stylistic elements of the dress echo elements that have previously been associated with Sansa - feathers from her time in the Eyrie and fish scales as a nod to her Tully heritage through her mother. I&rsquo;ve mentioned that I think this is a transitional dress and as such it builds on the stylistic and symbolic approach that Clapton took with Sansa&rsquo;s costumes in season 7 where they visually express all of the things that has happened to her - the abuse and the lessons:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;&hellip;she&rsquo;s bringing all that she&rsquo;s been through to her costume.&rdquo; </i>(Michele Clapton,<i>&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6\">The Insider</a>)<br /></p><p>\n\n<i> I was trying to grasp <b>all that has happened to Sansa, all the hurt and abuse and frustration</b>, and trying to understand how she would <b>express this yet appear strong</b>.

Everything&rsquo;s quite muted and quite bleak.</b> I think it&rsquo;s important for the four women left to have a very strong&mdash;<b>it&rsquo;s not masculine, there&rsquo;s still a femininity to it&mdash;but there&rsquo;s a sort of hardening</b>.

Still, it is a theory I&rsquo;m not completely sold but it did make me recall&nbsp;this wonderful Magician&rsquo;s Cloak that Sandy Powell created for Prospera in Julie Taymor&rsquo;s adaptation of William Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>The Tempest</i>.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/247c3d06076c7aa5781609cdff4b0093/tumblr_inline_pnrds4VPX11uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This magnificent costume was created from 3.000 pieces of plastic painted and cut to resemble glass-like volcanic rock (<a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2011/02/06/features/outtakes/tempest-costume-piece-could-light-up-an-oscar/\">x</a>) - a sort of combination of obsidian and the basalt rock that is created from cooling lava flows. It is an amazing piece and I just wanted to share it with my dear readers.</p><p><b>Dragon Scales?</b><br /></p><p>Other people have suggested that Sansa&rsquo;s costume resembles dragon scales - and there is a certain resemblance when we compare the dress to the scales of the dragons in the show.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/784af4b35c6df13f78f5dc51d27ded17/tumblr_inline_pnud5bXwfm1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>However, this issue of dragon scales regarding Sansa&rsquo;s new costume really ought to be discussed in relation to previous costumes that features elements meant to evoke dragon scales, not the dragons themselves - as they belong to a coherent body of work created by costumier Michele Clapton and embroiderer Michele Carragher.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9866242e8ac6ba0eff1d48743674fac5/tumblr_inline_pnud62hZpi1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The only person that wears dragon scales on her costumes is Daenerys Targaryen, which makes perfect sense since she&rsquo;s the descendant of the dragon lords of Old Valyria and because she has three living dragons from which she derives her power and her mystique. As we can see from the photos above, Michele Clapton and the embroiderer Michele Carragher have used various techniques over the seasons to evoke dragon scales on Dany&rsquo;s clothing - from pleating and other fabric manipulation to beading with square Tila beads made of glass as well as pointy metallic sequins.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/414c3ec3e74f8994f60457b6c5e4229d/tumblr_inline_pnwa4bsg081uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Stylistically, you could make an argument that Sansa&rsquo;s black leather scales resemble the soft white cloth scales on Dany&rsquo;s white queenly dress from season 5. However, in terms of narrative it makes no sense whatsoever for Sansa to suddenly cover herself in dragon scales just because Daenerys enters her narrative.</p><p>In her quest to fit in, Sansa has always been very influenced by other people and her costumes mirror her journey towards finding out who she is as Clapton explains:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;Initially we see her try to emulate Cersei in her costumes, and then when that starts going wrong she sort of stalls and her colors start drifting back towards blue. But they&rsquo;re not quite blue, they&rsquo;re mauve. <b>Wherever she goes, she&rsquo;s sort of pulled in each direction.</b> Finally we see her as Dark Sansa, when she very dramatically changes her appearance and darkens her hair, and has a very dark costume.&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo; Now we see her back at Winterfell &mdash; <b>I think, slowly, she&rsquo;s becoming slightly more her own woman rather than always being influenced by those around her</b>. <b>She&rsquo;s finally finding herself</b>, and it&rsquo;s really interesting to explore that in Season 7, and it&rsquo;s exciting.&ldquo;</i> (Michele Clapton, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkeelyflaherty%2Ffacts-about-the-game-of-thrones-costumes-you-probably-nev%3Futm_term%3D.je5dAr7OP%23.hbzdAqKzQ&amp;t=MDQ3NTZkOTY4NGM5YmRiYzE1ZjMxYzIxMzIwOTE0YmNmNDg5NDczYSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fcostume-design-quotes-by-michele-clapton-and&amp;m=1\">BuzzFeed</a>) \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Season 8 is the time for Sansa to finally have found herself - to know herself and what she wants, which is going to be expressed in her costumes and her hair styles:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nFor so long, <b>Sansa&rsquo;s hair changed season by season depending on who was influencing her</b>. The first few episodes she was a Northerner in Winterfell and took after her mother with a simple braid down the back. Then when she went to King&rsquo;s Landing it was a big, decadent halo that was very much like what the Queen wore. With Littlefinger, she dyes her hair black and wears all black. Then she goes back to Winterfell and returns to her mother&rsquo;s hair. <b>She created her own identity in season 7 and that kind of runs through to season 8. She&rsquo;s chosen how she wants her hair to be, and she&rsquo;s finally the leader and influencer instead of being influenced by everyone else. </b></i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/hair/sophie-turner-hair-color\">InStyle</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>This quote is about Sansa&rsquo;s hair style but it will certainly also apply to her costumes because Clapton creates her designs to visually express the character&rsquo;s narrative journeys. And Sophie Turner has hinted that in this final season, Sansa has indeed come to know herself:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nThe past few seasons for her and the whole series for her, <b>she&rsquo;s kind of been somewhat lost </b>as a matter of where she wants to be, who she wants to be, who she wants to surround herself with, and <b>this season she is very very self-assured. She knows what she wants. She knows what she stands for. She knows who she wants to be around</b>, and she faces threats to that this season. </i>(Sophie Turner, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/sophie-turner-and-maisie-williams-game-of-thrones-self-care.html\">Vulture</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>So, no - Sansa Stark&rsquo;s scaly new battle dress doesn&rsquo;t represent dragon scales because it makes absolutely no narrative sense for her to suddenly adopt a Targaryen style. Her narrative arc has been a long journey back towards her roots but also a journey of self-discovery, a tempering of character by way of much hardship.</p><p><b>Fish or Fowl?</b></p><p>If the leather scales on this costume evoke neither dragonglass nor dragon scales, what do they refer to? As seen below, the texture of the dress looks very similar to both raven feather and fish scales.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/18b17d42ca69f494ad0d5fd5c9a52842/tumblr_inline_pnud6zIrtl1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sansa has worn feathers before and she has had a lot of winged imagery - in the form of dragonflies, moths, and raven feathers in her costuming whilst she has been called &ldquo;Little Dove&rdquo; by Cersei and &ldquo;Little Bird&rdquo; by the Hound in the dialogue of the show. Narratively, there&rsquo;s a precedent for her new dress to evoke feathers and the individual flaps looks to have textured surfaces in a manner that looks a bit feathery. The iridescence in the photos also reminds one of raven feathers but it is hard to tell whether this blue sheen is an effect of lighting and Photoshop or whether it comes from some kind of surface treatment of the material or whether the leather is more of a midnight blue than jet-black. It is very hard to tell.</p><h2><b>THE TULLY CONNECTION</b></h2><p>Despite the bird imagery in Sansa&rsquo;s narrative arc and the use of feathers in her previous costumes, I don&rsquo;t think that we should dismiss the possibility that the texture on her new dress is meant to evoke fish scales. After all, her mother was born a Tully of Riverrun. The sigil of House Tully is a trout and in the show their armour is made of textured leather flaps assembled to evoke fish scales!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8be1b5d9d6da581b7ad89da44e743e5/tumblr_inline_pnrbteOxTo1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>If we take a closer look at the armour that Edmure and Brynden Tully wear, you can see that it is made of layered flaps of stiff leather - and that each flap is been embossed to create a pattern of raised bumps, giving the whole ensemble an extra layer of texture. The similarities of both pattern and material between Sansa&rsquo;s dress and the Tully armour makes a compelling argument that this battle dress is a female variation on the traditional armour of her mother&rsquo;s House.</p><p>So why would Sansa, who as Lady of Winterfell is the head of House Stark, wear something that looks like Tully armour? As said, Sansa&rsquo;s mother Catelyn was born a Tully of Riverrun and since the end of season 2, Sansa has included elements of her mother&rsquo;s style and symbols of her mother&rsquo;s heritage in her clothing and her hair style.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5cf6b579cabbbd12f7bb03ff20e9519/tumblr_inline_pnwgg2UHwl1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>From the end of season 2 to the end of season 4, Sansa wears her dresses and her hair in the style of her mother (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/182432528629/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-17\">x</a>). Sansa styling herself as her mother in King&rsquo;s Landing is way for her to signal her distance from Cersei&rsquo;s toxic wisdom. Sansa doesn&rsquo;t want to look like the woman who not only turns the blind eye to Joffrey&rsquo;s abuse of her but who herself delights in tormenting the girl emotionally. Whereas Sansa started to emulate Cersei&rsquo;s style before she knew any better, she now models herself on her mother (<i>&rdquo;I must be as strong as my lady mother&rdquo;</i> - AGoT, Sansa V).</p><p>In season 5, Sansa returns to Winterfell, sold into a marriage with her family&rsquo;s enemy. After a brief and drastic change of style (&rdquo;DarkSansa&rdquo;), she reverts to her mother&rsquo;s style again - the dresses are of the same cut and she dons a double embroidered collar such as Catelyn wore. At this point her mother (and most of her family are either dead or missing) and therefore Sansa does homage to her lost family by incorporating elements associated with them in her white wedding dress:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\"It&rsquo;s Sansa trying to respect everyone that&rsquo;s been before her. <b>She finally feels like she can make Winterfell a family home again. So I wanted to incorporate pieces that represented her family.</b>&rdquo; </i>(Michele Clapton, <i>Fashionista</i>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>She pays a special homage to her late mother by wearing a set of silver clasps in the shape of the Tully trout. Her mother had worn similar clasps but in season 2 the observant viewer can see that she left a few behind at Winterfell.</p><p>In season 6, Sansa once more turns to the style of her mother in order to reclaim her identity as a Stark after all the abuse she has endured. Thus, when she travels the North with Jon to raise troops in order to retake Winterfell, she is styled in a way that visually echoes Catelyn Stark&rsquo;s style.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2277ba7846d3e2eaad31b3367802d1f4/tumblr_inline_pny9p7J5Cp1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sansa&rsquo;s dress of teal velvet is the same colour of one of the dresses that Catelyn wore in season 1 and she wears a silver and black fur cape over her cloak, just like her mother.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;She has these amazing green dresses.

Another very interesting feature is the way that the stylized fur of the wolf morphs into a more scaly pattern where the iridescence of the mother of pearl beads clearly evoke fish scales. So while feathers have been more prominent in Sansa&rsquo;s costuming so far, the fish scales have been used as well - but in a much more subtle manner!</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s wardrobe takes a more plain and practical turn in season 7 with a new silhouette and colour palette. Her gowns are grey, in more rough-spun and heavy fabrics - and she no longer embellishes her dresses with beaded embroidery. Winter and war is here - and there&rsquo;s no room for frivolity. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there aren&rsquo;t a subtle nod to her Tully heritage - now it is just expressed through the textures of her clothes.</p><blockquote><p>&rdquo;<i>Within each of their costumes, there are influences. [&hellip;] <b>Sansa&rsquo;s are part father, part mother.</b> <b>It&rsquo;s her father&rsquo;s silhouette with the fur, her mother&rsquo;s within.

However, <b>throughout the seasons Michele Clapton has ensured that Catelyn Stark has remained an unspoken presence with her eldest daughter - a presence expressed through the way that Sansa styles herself.</b></p><p>Until now, the Tully connection in Sansa&rsquo;s costumes has always been a very personal one - referencing her mother Catelyn. She has worn colours, silhouettes and jewellery in her mother&rsquo;s style and her some textures, patterns and embroidery has had subtle references to the Tully sigil. However, while Sansa&rsquo;s new leather dress looks like a female version of the traditional Tully armour, it is not a style that has ever been associated with Catelyn&rsquo;s personal look! So while this dress can be interpreted as an homage to her murdered mother (<a href=\"https://www.inquisitr.com/5318889/sansa-stark-got-season-8-poster-photos/\">x</a>), its symbolism encompass more than the memory of a beloved parent.</p><h2>A Tully armour dress is also a political statement!</h2><p>Sansa is, according to Clapton, a person who&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;tends to express herself visually&rdquo;</i> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65fYoMINx00\">x</a>) and on <i>Game of Thrones</i> fashion choices are always meaningful:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>Everything &ndash; even a fashion choice &ndash; has meaning on &ldquo;Game of Thrones.&rdquo; </b>In this cutthroat world where men fight for the Iron Throne and the women yield a different kind of power, <b>a choice of fabric or a different cut of cloth can be a political statement, costume designer Michele Clapton told TODAY.com</b></i><b>.&nbsp;</b>(Michele Clapton,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fstyle%2Fwhat-expect-costumes-season-3-game-thrones-1C9143460&amp;t=YTMwZTU5MjllNmQ3NTU4MjAzYzI2Y2I1NjBkZjMxYWY3YTUxNDEwOSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Today</a>) \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Though the style of this costume may invoke several different meanings, I am of the opinion it is first and foremost a nod to the heraldic sigil of House Tully because the stylistic similarities between Sansa&rsquo;s dress and the Tully armour are so strong. This raises some very interesting possibilities in terms of what may happen in the story - because we have to ask ourselves: Why would Lady Stark wear a garment that invokes the sigil of House Tully?</p><p>At this point in the story, Sansa has accrued quite a bit of political influence. The Northern lords have become rather impressed with her during her tenure as Jon&rsquo;s regent, she also has the allegiance of the Knights of the Vale through Lord Royce. That is two major regions that she has in her pocket so to speak. However, her mother&rsquo;s heritage may also become politically important - after all, her uncle is Lord of Riverrun. House Tully hasn&rsquo;t had much of a presence in the story after the Red Wedding and we last saw Edmure Tully in season 6 where he yielded Riverrun to Jaime Lannister. Will House Tully have a role to play in this final season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>? It seems so because Tobias Menzies has been confirmed to appear in the first episode of the last season, along with the actor who plays the Robert Arryn, the young Lord of the Vale (<a href=\"https://winteriscoming.net/2019/02/14/hbo-schedule-reveals-full-season-8-cast-with-some-surprising-returns/\">x</a>). Thus, two political figures with personal ties to Sansa is set to enter the political arena - and it is very likely that Sansa&rsquo;s impressive fish scale battle dress is related to this.</p><p>To be continued&hellip;</p></p>",

        "body": "<h1>Daenerys Vs Sansa Bullshit.</h1><p>I have never been a huge fan of book or show Sansa. That being said she\u2019s grown a lot in the last three seasons and I can respect/relate to that. I can see why so many people adore her. She\u2019s like a Disney princess in this horrible world, smart on the sly but always the lady, comes from the seemingly perfect family, is abused mentally/physically and later sexually and raises herself back up.</p><p> There\u2019s some that say she wouldn\u2019t be where she is without Jon and this is partly true. If Jon wasn\u2019t the Lord commander of the nights watch Sansa would\u2019ve had no refuge. If Jon didn\u2019t agree to go to battle with Ramsay they wouldn\u2019t of gotten winterfell back, he wouldn\u2019t of become king and she wouldn\u2019t of been named Lady when he left. </p><p>But she has to be mentally strong and cunning to leave Ramsay/go to battle against him, to kill Littlefinger and she also has to be gentle, kind and considerate to be the Lady. But she\u2019s also undoubtedly flawed. She disliked and picked on Arya as a child because she wasn\u2019t graceful or pretty. She alienated Jon because he was a bastard. She was disgusted by Tyrion because he was a dwarf. She was self centred and selfish and I expect book Sansa is still in many ways the same in her inner thoughts. So many of us as children were the exact same. Some of us still are. </p><p>Daenerys had the opposite as a child. She resonates with those of us who didn\u2019t have the best upbringing. She was the underdog. Nobody expected much of her. But here this girl who was physically/mentally and sexually abused, hidden away, lied to and sold has made herself into a queen. Not just any queen but the queen she\u2019s always imagined. </p><p>She\u2019s between Visenya and Rhaenys, she can be the lady but she can also be dark. Some people claim she had everything handed to her because she was given dragons eggs and the dragons are the reason she\u2019s been able to rise. This is partly true. If she didn\u2019t have the newborn dragons she wouldn\u2019t have been permitted to enter Quarth and thus died in the red waste. The dragons have given her an edge nobody else has, they\u2019re her strongest weapon and the reason why she could free slaves, conquer cities ect.</p><p> But think about if Viserys had the dragons. He would either have been murdered very early on for gloating/showing off or set the dragons on the world to cause chaos. She\u2019s smart and calculated. In the book someone gifts her some armour that wouldn\u2019t be any good in a real battle we\u2019re told through her thoughts she has proper armour should battle come. She\u2019s not afraid to get her hands dirty and she takes responsibility for her mistakes. </p><p>That being said she\u2019s also undoubtedly flawed. She\u2019s headstrong, her first thought when attacked is to kill, she sometimes struggles to see past her own experiences and feelings and thinks others who have been in these situations should feel the same. </p><p><b>Sansa\u2019s flaws are a product of her environment and upbringing. Daenerys\u2019s flaws are a product of her environment and upbringing</b>. This doesn\u2019t make either character bad, evil, horrible ect. </p><p>My point is that while these two characters are very different they are also very much alike. It would make zero sense for these two to become enemies so why do we pit them against each other? Why are we desperate for a woman vs woman? <b>Why do we have to use a man to get that?</b> Why does one have to be better than the other? Simple, they don\u2019t. </p><p>Grey characters are the best characters. Those are the characters we can cry with, laugh with, root for, fear for. Stop trying to make them perfect and embrace their imperfections. </p>",

Only this time&hellip; There were dragons. As they flew overhead, she could not stop the cold sense of dread that settled into the pit of her stomach, knowing these dragons were supposed to be their saviors&hellip; But they would be the North&rsquo;s end. Sansa turned and crossed the battlement, her eyes never once straying from the sight of those two dragons, wondering if all was to be lost. These dragons, they&rsquo;d eat them out of house and home. Not to mention the thousands of soldiers marching their way into Wintertown and down to Winterfell. The long line of them seemed endless. Sansa shuddered, a sudden chill racing the length of her spine as she turned back to face front. </p><p>And then she saw them.</p><p>It was Jon and with him a woman she knew had to be Daenerys Targaryen. They were far but even from such a distance her silver hair was unmistakable. Swallowing down her fears, Sansa made her way down from the battlements, back down towards the courtyard where already people had begun to gather. Arya and Brienne already stood across the way, an odd looking pair to say the least, but the sight of them gave her courage. Bran was missing, but she wasn&rsquo;t surprised he&rsquo;d not come down to greet this Dragon queen and her army. He said he had to speak with Jon and while it had seemed important, he had not spoken of the details. She had begun to grow accustomed to her changed siblings- both Arya and Bran were far from the people she recalled from childhood. Though, she supposed they must have thought the same of her. She took a single step forward, preparing herself to join Arya and Brienne, but the gates suddenly opened and it was Jon alone on his horse, not a soul with him as he rode through. </p><p>Sansa felt her heart turnover, her breath catching in her throat as Jon slid down from his horse, his eyes only on her. He crossed the courtyard in several strides, taking her into his arms before everyone there. He was warm and solid, the feeling of his arms around her like that of a perfect dream. &ldquo;Trust in me.&rdquo; Was all he whispered, his breath warm against the shell of her ear as her eyes raised, seeing the silver-haired woman as she approached, her horse left behind somewhere else. Another man walked beside her, a man she did not recognize, but Sansa could see he would not stray from her side. </p><p>Jon released her a moment later, stepping back as Daenerys stepped up before them, a smile twitching on her lips. For a moment, Sansa was awestruck by the queen&rsquo;s beauty- her violet eyes were like that of a spring bloom, her skin pale and probably soft to the touch. But then she caught herself, remembering who she was and what was happening, and Sansa looked down at her from where she stood. &ldquo;Winterfell is yours, your grace,&rdquo; she said by way of a greeting, her words an echo of those her own father had spoken to Robert Baratheon so long ago. The dragon queen smiled again, exchanging pleasantries for only a moment longer before Sansa bid a serving man to her side, indicating for him to show the queen to the rooms she&rsquo;d had prepared for her. </p><p>The moment the queen had disappeared through the doors leading inside, Arya had pounced, and for the first time since their own reunion Sansa saw a piece of the little sister she&rsquo;d once had. Sansa watched as they embraced, Jon&rsquo;s smile as true as she had always thought it would be. A moment later Jon was turning back to her, his dark eyes finding her own, and Sansa&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat. She had so much to tell him&hellip; So very much she wasn&rsquo;t even sure where to begin. &ldquo;Jon&hellip; I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should see that she&rsquo;s settled properly.&rdquo; Jon suddenly spoke, looking towards the doors that Daenerys had just disappeared through. Sansa blinked but her face did not betray her and she merely nodded, saying she understood. She watched him go, that sinking feeling returning as she absently put a hand to her abdomen, wondering what he would say when she told him the truth. </p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>He hated hearing her say those words.</p><p><i>Winterfell is yours, your grace.</i> Sansa&rsquo;s words echoed through his mind, over and over again, every time like a knife to his gut. They had worked so hard to gain Winterfell back and now, just like that, it belonged to someone else. He knew it must have killed her to say such a thing to anyone, let alone this foreign queen he&rsquo;d brought with him. He knew what it must have looked like to anyone- him riding into Winterfell beside the beautiful dragon queen- but this was how it had to be. No matter what happened, he had to ensure everyone around him believed his motives just as much as Daenerys herself did. Soon&hellip; Soon he would tell Sansa the truth. But for now, even her he would have to keep in the dark.</p><p>He did as he said, making his way to Daenerys&rsquo; rooms to ensure she would be comfortable there; to his shock, he found her lodged in the Lord&rsquo;s chambers, Sansa&rsquo;s own chambers. The same ones he&rsquo;d given to her months before when they had won the battle against Ramsay Bolton. First her home, now her own rooms? Knocking on the door, Daenerys opened it with a smile, her picture-like features glowing with renewed warmth. &ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she greeted, allowing him entrance, shutting the door behind him. She had shed her warm, white jacket and blood red gloves, both thrown over the back of the chair closest to the fire. &ldquo;Your sister seems&hellip;&rdquo; She trailed off, as if trying to find the right word to say without causing offense. &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s quite beautiful.&rdquo; Daenerys finally recovered, chuckling softly. &ldquo;Though it would seem she was not happy to welcome me to Winterfell.&rdquo; She returned to the chair she&rsquo;d clearly been sitting in before his arrival, her long silver hair falling across one shoulder as she leaned over to begin unlacing her boots. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to forgive her, she&rsquo;s only just got Winterfell back. It must pain her to offer her home to someone else, queen or no queen.&rdquo; Jon stepped further into the room, closer to the fire that brought him no warmth at all. He found he wanted nothing more than to return to Sansa. Jon knew he&rsquo;d upset her out in the courtyard, leaving her so quickly&hellip; But all of this&hellip; It was for her. &ldquo;I just wanted to ensure you were comfortable.&rdquo; Daenerys raised her head to look at him then, perhaps taken by surprise, but then her features softened and she nodded. </p><p>They made small talk for just a few more minutes before Jon excused himself, heading down the corridors towards the Great Hall. Inside he found a single servant who jumped at the sight of him, offering a quick bow, stumbling over a greeting. &ldquo;What room is Lady Stark housed in now?&rdquo; The man replied that it was her old childhood rooms to which Jon thanked him and left, this time his feet carrying him towards the chambers he&rsquo;d not visited since their childhood days.</p><p>Knocking on her door, he heard her shuffling behind it before she opened it, her smile at once brightening her face. &ldquo;Jon.&rdquo; She greeted as she stepped back, allowing him entrance, the door closing behind them. Without a word, Jon took her back into his arms, holding onto her for far longer than he&rsquo;d dared to do out in the courtyard. For a split second she stiffened, but then he felt her yield to his embrace, sinking against his chest as her own arms came around his waist. &ldquo;I missed you.&rdquo; Her voice was muffled against his shoulder and Jon drew back then, holding her at arms length, unwilling to completely release her from his grasp. It was as if she&rsquo;d grown more beautiful in these weeks since he&rsquo;d left, a glow about her he&rsquo;d never truly noticed before. He attributed it to her becoming healthy again, beginning to rise above everything that had happened to her. What else could it be, after all?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you,&rdquo; he replied, giving her another quick squeeze before finally letting go, though he felt the cold the moment she&rsquo;d gone from his arms. &ldquo;You must tell me everything that&rsquo;s happened while I&rsquo;ve been away.&rdquo; Their correspondence had been slim, only a few quick and simple coded messages that hadn&rsquo;t given him much information. He took her by the hands, leading her towards her bed, both of them settling themselves upon the edge beside one another. Jon didn&rsquo;t let go of her hands, he couldn&rsquo;t, he had to still yet feel her soft skin against his. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to give her your rooms, you know.&rdquo; Jon said softly, gesturing about the room they sat in, his hand returning to sit upon her leg. &ldquo;She could have stayed here, you didn&rsquo;t have to give her yours.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa smiled, shaking her head. &ldquo;You remember, father always gave his rooms to a visitor. It was the right thing to do.&rdquo; She slipped her other free hand into place over his, still settled there upon her thigh. <i>Tell him,</i> she thought, <i>tell him while you&rsquo;ve got the chance! </i>She opened her mouth as if she meant to speak but there came a knock on her chamber door and at once Jon jumped up, the door opening only a second later. </p><p>&ldquo;Lady Stark&hellip; My lord, a rider&hellip; At the gate.&rdquo; The chamberlain said, looking from one to the other, not quite noticing the awkward look on either of their faces. &ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s Jaime Lannister.&rdquo; Sansa was on her feet then, her blue eyes wide as she nodded, striding past Jon who followed after her, both of them making their way back down towards the courtyard. All she could think was later&hellip; I&rsquo;ll tell him later. A silent promise to herself and to the life she carried within her. </p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>So much had happened in these last few days, Sansa could scarcely wrap her mind around it.</p><p>Jaime Lannister had indeed showed up at their gates and pledged his life to her, to House Stark, and to the fight for the living. Though most would have distrusted him, Sansa accepted his vow and gave hers back, thus welcoming him into Winterfell. After living the life she had these last few years, she&rsquo;d learned to trust almost no one, but something about Jaime Lannister had felt&hellip; Honest. Had felt right. And Brienne had spoken to his true skill as a swordsman and she supposed if nothing else they would be glad to have him on their side in the fight against the Night King. </p><p>The Night King&hellip; The very thought of him sent shivers down her spine. As the days grew colder, she knew the final battle was coming. This would be a fight between the living and the dead and if they lost&hellip; No, she couldn&rsquo;t think that way. Jon wouldn&rsquo;t lose. She walked through the courtyard as she did every morning, surveying the smiths as they forged weapons made from the dragonglass Jon and Daenerys had brought. She stopped for a moment to exchange words with Gendry, who&rsquo;s easy going smile calmed her, his dark eyes a mirror of the father he&rsquo;d never got to know. It was well known who Gendry&rsquo;s father had been, the one time King Robert Baratheon, the only living bastard of his reign. Though he didn&rsquo;t know who his mother was, there were some who said it was a peasant girl, conceived back during his days as a soldier. She felt sad for him, for he&rsquo;d known no parent at all. </p><p>Taking her leave from Gendry, she made her way further down the line, stopping only when she caught sight of that silver-hair reflecting the cold, winter sun. Daenerys was walking along the outer edge of the courtyard with Jon and she was surprised to see the dragon queen leaning on his arm, head tilted in as she listened to Jon speak. Sansa felt her stomach sink, her cheeks growing warm as she watched them go, looking quite like lovers sneaking off to be alone. It was like a gut punch, the breath stolen from her very lungs. For a long moment she stood there, completely and utterly frozen, unable to look away as they continued on, her heart fluttering fast within her chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Lady Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>She nearly lept from her skin, turning so fast she nearly stumbled and the man before her caught her elbow, righting her stance. &ldquo;Forgive me, my lady.&rdquo; Jaime Lannister stood before her then, his eyes finding hers, perhaps taking note of the wild look to her own, but not mentioning it. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to startle you.&rdquo; He watched as her features changed and suddenly she was Lady Stark again, not the young girl he&rsquo;d just interrupted, a young woman forced to partake in a dark and gloomy world. &ldquo;I came to speak to you of something.&rdquo; He had held his tongue these first few days at Winterfell, knowing this alliance with the dragon queen was vital to their war against the Night King, but&hellip; He had pledged himself to this young woman and her house. He owed her the truth and the knowledge he had of all he&rsquo;d witnessed Daenerys Targaryen do. &ldquo;Might we walk?&rdquo; He offered her his arm then and she took it, allowing him to lead her, all the while beginning the long conversation they would have to have.</p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>She tried to tell herself it didn&rsquo;t matter. Jon didn&rsquo;t owe her anything, after all. It was true&hellip; They had slept together that night before he left for Dragonstone. She had wanted it as much as he had, so she didn&rsquo;t blame him for the aftermath, she knew as well as any woman what coupling could lead to. How she&rsquo;d gone this long without conceiving a child had convinced her she was barren- had Ramsay not beat her for thinking so, too? Besides&hellip; There were ways of handling an unwanted child. She and Jon were half-siblings, perhaps a child of theirs was an abomination&hellip; She reasoned with herself, citing Joffrey as reason enough to believe siblings should never create a child. But then again&hellip; Myrcella and Tommen had been normal enough, hadn&rsquo;t they?</p><p>Needing time alone, Sansa found herself climbing the old, crumbling steps up to the broken tower which years ago, Bran had fallen from. Or been pushed&hellip; Sometimes she wasn&rsquo;t certain which it had been. But, this place felt like the only place she&rsquo;d not be disturbed, the only place she could sit and think without someone saying Lady Stark. And it was here, only here, that she sank into an old dusty chair and began to cry. Heartfelt sobs that caught in her throat, her shoulders shaking as she curved into herself, wishing with all of her might that this could be easy. But life had proven to her time and time again that nothing was ever easy. And yet&hellip; This was more painful than she&rsquo;d ever thought heartbreak could be. </p><p>It was a short time later, hours perhaps, she had lost track of time, when she finally knew all of her tears had been shed. Rising up from the chair, she wiped her face dry and crossed the room to stand at the window, fingertips tracing the old, broken stones. &ldquo;Sansa!&rdquo; She turned at the sound of his voice, her eyes taking in the sight of him in the doorway, his worry evident as he crossed the room in three great strides to take her into his arms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere for you!&rdquo; His tone was full of relief, his grip warm and strong, but Sansa pulled away and turned back to look out the window, unable to look at him. &ldquo;Sansa&hellip;?&rdquo; Now his tone had changed, surprised, perhaps even hurt. She knew what his face must have looked like, those dark eyes widening slightly, his jaw tight. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; </p><p><i>Everything.</i> The word was on the tip of her tongue, so close she almost said it. &ldquo;Have you asked her about the Battle of the Goldroad?&rdquo; She said instead, whirling back around to face him, watching as his face screwed up as it always did when he was thinking about what was said to him. It was endearing. She hated herself for thinking so. &ldquo;Has Samwell asked about his father? His brother?&rdquo; Jon was understanding then, slowly, but he was. &ldquo;She burned them, Jon. Your lover queen has burned them alive. And all the supplies the Lannister army was taking back to King&rsquo;s Landing. All the food, grain, all of the supplies she could have sent North to feed her army and ours. Your <i>queen</i> has doomed us to starvation.&rdquo; By the time she finished ranting, she was breathless, chest heaving as she made to rush past him, but Jon caught her by the arm, forcing her back.</p><p>His dark eyes were like a raging storm, his mouth a permanent frown as he fought to find the words to say to her. &ldquo;I&hellip; No,&rdquo; he finally admitted, shaking his head as all of the fight went out of him. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He thought of his friend, Sam, and how he would have to know the fate of his family. He thought of the North, already locked into a long winter, now with thousands of soliders to feed. He thought of the dragons that had come with them, dragons that would know no difference between livestock or children, that would eat what should have been theirs. This was why he did not deserve a crown, a title of any kind. He knew nothing of ruling beyond pretty speeches and wielding a sword. But this girl before him&hellip; She knew it better than him. Her blue eyes were dark with grief, red rimmed and swollen, telling him she&rsquo;d been crying up here. Now he understood why she&rsquo;d been hiding. She took her role as Lady of Winterfell seriously and she&rsquo;d not wanted anyone to see her in such a state. &ldquo;Sansa&hellip; I know you don&rsquo;t want to hear this, but we need her. No matter what she&rsquo;s done, we needed her dragonglass, her alliance.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa laughed, pulling back again, shaking her head. &ldquo;Of course you would say that.&rdquo; Her tone was dark, a tone he&rsquo;d never heard her use before. Now he was recalling the other words she&rsquo;d said only moments before, lost to him when he&rsquo;d heard of the Tarly&rsquo;s death. <i>Your lover queen</i>, she had called Daenerys, reminding him that he had never told her the truth. He supposed in some ways, this was good, because it meant no one suspected a thing from him. But seeing her there looking like that, he knew he had to tell her the truth. He opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off as she spoke two simple, but life changing words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant.&rdquo; </p><p>For a moment the world seemed to stop spinning. Jon blinked, faltering as he gazed back at her, not quite seeing her. &ldquo;Pregnant&hellip;?&rdquo; He parroted back, recalling the night they&rsquo;d spent together before he had left for Dragonstone. At once the world began to spin again and Jon could not stop himself from drawing her back into his arms again. She struggled against him for a few moments, but then she ceased, clinging to the front of his tunic as she sagged against him. It was as if the weight of the world had finally lifted from her shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Sansa,&rdquo; he whispered against the crown of her head, one hand stroking her long, vibrant hair, the other around her waist pressed into the small of her back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he murmured again, knowing in some ways he had failed her. He had coupled with her that night without thinking of what could happen, led by his feelings for her, and then had gone off to Dragonstone to forge an alliance with Daenerys. He&rsquo;d never thought doing such a thing would mean what it meant for him, pretending to fall for her, sharing her bed all so she would help him help the North. Though he could argue he had done it all for her, Jon knew he owed her more than that. More than it&rsquo;s all for you. Besides, he owed her the truth of what Bran had just told him hours before. </p><p>And so he opened his mouth and began to talk.</p><p>He talked for what could have been hours- long enough that the afternoon sun had begun to sink and cast the old tower into darkness. He had settled himself into the old chair, pulling her onto his lap while they talked. For the first time since his return, they could talk without worry of being discovered, without their important roles hanging over their heads. They could just be them- Jon and Sansa, not King in the North or Lady of Winterfell. Jon knew now he had a much bigger reason to fight the Night King, he had more than just a home to fight for. He had a child. He had a true love. Jon knew, without a doubt, there was nothing he wouldn&rsquo;t do for this woman tucked into his arms, her red hair a waterfall over her shoulder as she leaned her head on his. He did not deserve such a perfect woman. </p><p>It was a few minutes into the silence that had fallen after he&rsquo;d finished speaking and Jon felt her raise her head from his shoulder to face him. Over her shoulder he could see the sunset sky, crimson and gold streaking across the blue as the sun sank beneath the horizon. He had always thought of her at the sunset. &ldquo;I love you, Sansa.&rdquo; He spoke simply, knowing those words were the truth of his heart. Reaching out, he put his hand against the flat plane of her stomach, knowing in the coming months it would begin to curve with the growth of their child and he knew&hellip; He had to do the right thing by her and the child. He loved her with every piece of him. Leaning in, he captured her mouth with his and for a long moment, everything in his world was perfect.</p><p>But as always, nothing could stay perfect forever. </p><p>They both heard the footsteps a moment too late- as they broke apart and turned, it was Jaime Lannister standing there, looking pale and worried. But for a single moment, his expression changed and he smiled, as if he understood, watching as Sansa slid from Jon&rsquo;s lap and stood, Jon rising a moment later. &ldquo;My lord, a white walker has been spotted outside Wintertown.&rdquo; Back to business and both Jon and Sansa could appreciate that. She felt a chill rush through her and she could not stop herself from clutching his hand. &ldquo;And so it begins.&rdquo; Jaime said before he turned and went from the room, leaving them alone once again.</p><p>Though he would have given anything to remain up there in that broken tower with Sansa, he knew what he had to do. And so he kept his hand in hers, walking her down the crumbling stone steps and back out into the falling darkness of night, leading her back towards the doors that would lead them inside. &ldquo;Gather what you need and then I will take you to the crypts.&rdquo; He shook his head when she opened her mouth, as if she meant to argue with him. &ldquo;You will be safest there.&rdquo; She sighed but then nodded, giving his hand a single squeeze before she made to go, but a grip on her hand made her turn back. &ldquo;But first&hellip; Meet me in the godswood.&rdquo; Her eyes widened for a moment but then she nodded and then he let her go, watching as she disappeared around a corner, off to begin taking command of Winterfell, preparing its inhabitants for the fight to come.</p><p>And Jon went out into the courtyard, joining Jaime and Tormund and all of the others, where they would speak one last time about their battle plans. Then&hellip; The fight would begin. But first, he had something important to handle. Excusing himself, he wandered back into Winterfell and found Sam with Gilly, already ushering her down the hall that would lead them into the crypts. &ldquo;Sam&hellip;&rdquo; Jon caught his attention and the man turned, his easy going smile appearing at the sight of him. &ldquo;Can I borrow you, for just a short time?&rdquo; Sam arched a brow in question but then nodded, following after him after sending Gilly and baby Sam down to where they would be safe in the fight to come.</p><p>Sam asked no questions as they approached the heart tree and for that, Jon was thankful. He knew that through the faith of the Old Gods that there were no priests, no specific person needed to marry two people. And so he called upon the only person he could trust with such a thing. </p><p>Standing there beneath the heart tree, it was only a few minutes before he heard her approaching footsteps. She had changed gowns, a new gown of the darkest blues, something quite like fish scales, reminding him of her tie to House Tully through Catelyn Stark. He could catch glimpses of it beneath her cloak in the dying sunlight. &ldquo;Jon, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; She asked, close enough now that she noticed Sam behind him. He said nothing as he took her hands and drew her close, breathing in her sweet, familiar scent. </p><p>&ldquo;Marry me.&rdquo; </p><p>A smile curved on her lips and she then nodded, needing no words to say in a moment like this. And so Jon pulled from his doublet a single winter rose, its blue petals soft and scented as he tucked it into her hair, a call back to the mother he had never known. Then, taking her by the hands, they turned to face Sam who smiled and began to speak, weaving the words that would commit them to each other before the Old Gods and the New, words that would no matter what happened in the end of the war, protect her and their child. </p><p>Then he took her to the crypts and left her there with the others who could not fight in the battle, holding onto her for a moment longer than he&rsquo;d intended, whispering words against her ear. &ldquo;Until morning, wife&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>And then&hellip; He was gone. Sansa stood watching him go, her heart beating fast in her chest, knowing this very well could have been the last time she saw him alive.<i> No</i>, she told herself, <i>you can&rsquo;t think like that.</i> Without thinking, she put a hand to her abdomen and knew Jon would come back for her&hellip; No, he would come back for them. And that was all she could hope for. It was all she could believe. </p>",

Only this time\u2026 There were dragons. As they flew overhead, she could not stop the cold sense of dread that settled into the pit of her stomach, knowing these dragons were supposed to be their saviors\u2026 But they would be the North\u2019s end. Sansa turned and crossed the battlement, her eyes never once straying from the sight of those two dragons, wondering if all was to be lost. These dragons, they\u2019d eat them out of house and home. Not to mention the thousands of soldiers marching their way into Wintertown and down to Winterfell. The long line of them seemed endless. Sansa shuddered, a sudden chill racing the length of her spine as she turned back to face front. </p><p>And then she saw them.</p><p>It was Jon and with him a woman she knew had to be Daenerys Targaryen. They were far but even from such a distance her silver hair was unmistakable. Swallowing down her fears, Sansa made her way down from the battlements, back down towards the courtyard where already people had begun to gather. Arya and Brienne already stood across the way, an odd looking pair to say the least, but the sight of them gave her courage. Bran was missing, but she wasn\u2019t surprised he\u2019d not come down to greet this Dragon queen and her army. He said he had to speak with Jon and while it had seemed important, he had not spoken of the details. She had begun to grow accustomed to her changed siblings- both Arya and Bran were far from the people she recalled from childhood. Though, she supposed they must have thought the same of her. She took a single step forward, preparing herself to join Arya and Brienne, but the gates suddenly opened and it was Jon alone on his horse, not a soul with him as he rode through. </p><p>Sansa felt her heart turnover, her breath catching in her throat as Jon slid down from his horse, his eyes only on her. He crossed the courtyard in several strides, taking her into his arms before everyone there. He was warm and solid, the feeling of his arms around her like that of a perfect dream. \u201cTrust in me.\u201d Was all he whispered, his breath warm against the shell of her ear as her eyes raised, seeing the silver-haired woman as she approached, her horse left behind somewhere else. Another man walked beside her, a man she did not recognize, but Sansa could see he would not stray from her side. </p><p>Jon released her a moment later, stepping back as Daenerys stepped up before them, a smile twitching on her lips. For a moment, Sansa was awestruck by the queen\u2019s beauty- her violet eyes were like that of a spring bloom, her skin pale and probably soft to the touch. But then she caught herself, remembering who she was and what was happening, and Sansa looked down at her from where she stood. \u201cWinterfell is yours, your grace,\u201d she said by way of a greeting, her words an echo of those her own father had spoken to Robert Baratheon so long ago. The dragon queen smiled again, exchanging pleasantries for only a moment longer before Sansa bid a serving man to her side, indicating for him to show the queen to the rooms she\u2019d had prepared for her. </p><p>The moment the queen had disappeared through the doors leading inside, Arya had pounced, and for the first time since their own reunion Sansa saw a piece of the little sister she\u2019d once had. Sansa watched as they embraced, Jon\u2019s smile as true as she had always thought it would be. A moment later Jon was turning back to her, his dark eyes finding her own, and Sansa\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She had so much to tell him\u2026 So very much she wasn\u2019t even sure where to begin. \u201cJon\u2026 I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should see that she\u2019s settled properly.\u201d Jon suddenly spoke, looking towards the doors that Daenerys had just disappeared through. Sansa blinked but her face did not betray her and she merely nodded, saying she understood. She watched him go, that sinking feeling returning as she absently put a hand to her abdomen, wondering what he would say when she told him the truth. </p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>He hated hearing her say those words.</p><p><i>Winterfell is yours, your grace.</i> Sansa\u2019s words echoed through his mind, over and over again, every time like a knife to his gut. They had worked so hard to gain Winterfell back and now, just like that, it belonged to someone else. He knew it must have killed her to say such a thing to anyone, let alone this foreign queen he\u2019d brought with him. He knew what it must have looked like to anyone- him riding into Winterfell beside the beautiful dragon queen- but this was how it had to be. No matter what happened, he had to ensure everyone around him believed his motives just as much as Daenerys herself did. Soon\u2026 Soon he would tell Sansa the truth. But for now, even her he would have to keep in the dark.</p><p>He did as he said, making his way to Daenerys\u2019 rooms to ensure she would be comfortable there; to his shock, he found her lodged in the Lord\u2019s chambers, Sansa\u2019s own chambers. The same ones he\u2019d given to her months before when they had won the battle against Ramsay Bolton. First her home, now her own rooms? Knocking on the door, Daenerys opened it with a smile, her picture-like features glowing with renewed warmth. \u201cJon,\u201d she greeted, allowing him entrance, shutting the door behind him. She had shed her warm, white jacket and blood red gloves, both thrown over the back of the chair closest to the fire. \u201cYour sister seems\u2026\u201d She trailed off, as if trying to find the right word to say without causing offense. \u201cWell, she\u2019s quite beautiful.\u201d Daenerys finally recovered, chuckling softly. \u201cThough it would seem she was not happy to welcome me to Winterfell.\u201d She returned to the chair she\u2019d clearly been sitting in before his arrival, her long silver hair falling across one shoulder as she leaned over to begin unlacing her boots. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive her, she\u2019s only just got Winterfell back. It must pain her to offer her home to someone else, queen or no queen.\u201d Jon stepped further into the room, closer to the fire that brought him no warmth at all. He found he wanted nothing more than to return to Sansa. Jon knew he\u2019d upset her out in the courtyard, leaving her so quickly\u2026 But all of this\u2026 It was for her. \u201cI just wanted to ensure you were comfortable.\u201d Daenerys raised her head to look at him then, perhaps taken by surprise, but then her features softened and she nodded. </p><p>They made small talk for just a few more minutes before Jon excused himself, heading down the corridors towards the Great Hall. Inside he found a single servant who jumped at the sight of him, offering a quick bow, stumbling over a greeting. \u201cWhat room is Lady Stark housed in now?\u201d The man replied that it was her old childhood rooms to which Jon thanked him and left, this time his feet carrying him towards the chambers he\u2019d not visited since their childhood days.</p><p>Knocking on her door, he heard her shuffling behind it before she opened it, her smile at once brightening her face. \u201cJon.\u201d She greeted as she stepped back, allowing him entrance, the door closing behind them. Without a word, Jon took her back into his arms, holding onto her for far longer than he\u2019d dared to do out in the courtyard. For a split second she stiffened, but then he felt her yield to his embrace, sinking against his chest as her own arms came around his waist. \u201cI missed you.\u201d Her voice was muffled against his shoulder and Jon drew back then, holding her at arms length, unwilling to completely release her from his grasp. It was as if she\u2019d grown more beautiful in these weeks since he\u2019d left, a glow about her he\u2019d never truly noticed before. He attributed it to her becoming healthy again, beginning to rise above everything that had happened to her. What else could it be, after all?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he replied, giving her another quick squeeze before finally letting go, though he felt the cold the moment she\u2019d gone from his arms. \u201cYou must tell me everything that\u2019s happened while I\u2019ve been away.\u201d Their correspondence had been slim, only a few quick and simple coded messages that hadn\u2019t given him much information. He took her by the hands, leading her towards her bed, both of them settling themselves upon the edge beside one another. Jon didn\u2019t let go of her hands, he couldn\u2019t, he had to still yet feel her soft skin against his. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to give her your rooms, you know.\u201d Jon said softly, gesturing about the room they sat in, his hand returning to sit upon her leg. \u201cShe could have stayed here, you didn\u2019t have to give her yours.\u201d </p><p>Sansa smiled, shaking her head. \u201cYou remember, father always gave his rooms to a visitor. It was the right thing to do.\u201d She slipped her other free hand into place over his, still settled there upon her thigh. <i>Tell him,</i> she thought, <i>tell him while you\u2019ve got the chance! </i>She opened her mouth as if she meant to speak but there came a knock on her chamber door and at once Jon jumped up, the door opening only a second later. </p><p>\u201cLady Stark\u2026 My lord, a rider\u2026 At the gate.\u201d The chamberlain said, looking from one to the other, not quite noticing the awkward look on either of their faces. \u201cHe says he\u2019s Jaime Lannister.\u201d Sansa was on her feet then, her blue eyes wide as she nodded, striding past Jon who followed after her, both of them making their way back down towards the courtyard. All she could think was later\u2026 I\u2019ll tell him later. A silent promise to herself and to the life she carried within her. </p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>So much had happened in these last few days, Sansa could scarcely wrap her mind around it.</p><p>Jaime Lannister had indeed showed up at their gates and pledged his life to her, to House Stark, and to the fight for the living. Though most would have distrusted him, Sansa accepted his vow and gave hers back, thus welcoming him into Winterfell. After living the life she had these last few years, she\u2019d learned to trust almost no one, but something about Jaime Lannister had felt\u2026 Honest. Had felt right. And Brienne had spoken to his true skill as a swordsman and she supposed if nothing else they would be glad to have him on their side in the fight against the Night King. </p><p>The Night King\u2026 The very thought of him sent shivers down her spine. As the days grew colder, she knew the final battle was coming. This would be a fight between the living and the dead and if they lost\u2026 No, she couldn\u2019t think that way. Jon wouldn\u2019t lose. She walked through the courtyard as she did every morning, surveying the smiths as they forged weapons made from the dragonglass Jon and Daenerys had brought. She stopped for a moment to exchange words with Gendry, who\u2019s easy going smile calmed her, his dark eyes a mirror of the father he\u2019d never got to know. It was well known who Gendry\u2019s father had been, the one time King Robert Baratheon, the only living bastard of his reign. Though he didn\u2019t know who his mother was, there were some who said it was a peasant girl, conceived back during his days as a soldier. She felt sad for him, for he\u2019d known no parent at all. </p><p>Taking her leave from Gendry, she made her way further down the line, stopping only when she caught sight of that silver-hair reflecting the cold, winter sun. Daenerys was walking along the outer edge of the courtyard with Jon and she was surprised to see the dragon queen leaning on his arm, head tilted in as she listened to Jon speak. Sansa felt her stomach sink, her cheeks growing warm as she watched them go, looking quite like lovers sneaking off to be alone. It was like a gut punch, the breath stolen from her very lungs. For a long moment she stood there, completely and utterly frozen, unable to look away as they continued on, her heart fluttering fast within her chest. </p><p>\u201cLady Stark?\u201d</p><p>She nearly lept from her skin, turning so fast she nearly stumbled and the man before her caught her elbow, righting her stance. \u201cForgive me, my lady.\u201d Jaime Lannister stood before her then, his eyes finding hers, perhaps taking note of the wild look to her own, but not mentioning it. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d He watched as her features changed and suddenly she was Lady Stark again, not the young girl he\u2019d just interrupted, a young woman forced to partake in a dark and gloomy world. \u201cI came to speak to you of something.\u201d He had held his tongue these first few days at Winterfell, knowing this alliance with the dragon queen was vital to their war against the Night King, but\u2026 He had pledged himself to this young woman and her house. He owed her the truth and the knowledge he had of all he\u2019d witnessed Daenerys Targaryen do. \u201cMight we walk?\u201d He offered her his arm then and she took it, allowing him to lead her, all the while beginning the long conversation they would have to have.</p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>She tried to tell herself it didn\u2019t matter. Jon didn\u2019t owe her anything, after all. It was true\u2026 They had slept together that night before he left for Dragonstone. She had wanted it as much as he had, so she didn\u2019t blame him for the aftermath, she knew as well as any woman what coupling could lead to. How she\u2019d gone this long without conceiving a child had convinced her she was barren- had Ramsay not beat her for thinking so, too? Besides\u2026 There were ways of handling an unwanted child. She and Jon were half-siblings, perhaps a child of theirs was an abomination\u2026 She reasoned with herself, citing Joffrey as reason enough to believe siblings should never create a child. But then again\u2026 Myrcella and Tommen had been normal enough, hadn\u2019t they?</p><p>Needing time alone, Sansa found herself climbing the old, crumbling steps up to the broken tower which years ago, Bran had fallen from. Or been pushed\u2026 Sometimes she wasn\u2019t certain which it had been. But, this place felt like the only place she\u2019d not be disturbed, the only place she could sit and think without someone saying Lady Stark. And it was here, only here, that she sank into an old dusty chair and began to cry. Heartfelt sobs that caught in her throat, her shoulders shaking as she curved into herself, wishing with all of her might that this could be easy. But life had proven to her time and time again that nothing was ever easy. And yet\u2026 This was more painful than she\u2019d ever thought heartbreak could be. </p><p>It was a short time later, hours perhaps, she had lost track of time, when she finally knew all of her tears had been shed. Rising up from the chair, she wiped her face dry and crossed the room to stand at the window, fingertips tracing the old, broken stones. \u201cSansa!\u201d She turned at the sound of his voice, her eyes taking in the sight of him in the doorway, his worry evident as he crossed the room in three great strides to take her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you!\u201d His tone was full of relief, his grip warm and strong, but Sansa pulled away and turned back to look out the window, unable to look at him. \u201cSansa\u2026?\u201d Now his tone had changed, surprised, perhaps even hurt. She knew what his face must have looked like, those dark eyes widening slightly, his jaw tight. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p><p><i>Everything.</i> The word was on the tip of her tongue, so close she almost said it. \u201cHave you asked her about the Battle of the Goldroad?\u201d She said instead, whirling back around to face him, watching as his face screwed up as it always did when he was thinking about what was said to him. It was endearing. She hated herself for thinking so. \u201cHas Samwell asked about his father? His brother?\u201d Jon was understanding then, slowly, but he was. \u201cShe burned them, Jon. Your lover queen has burned them alive. And all the supplies the Lannister army was taking back to King\u2019s Landing. All the food, grain, all of the supplies she could have sent North to feed her army and ours. Your <i>queen</i> has doomed us to starvation.\u201d By the time she finished ranting, she was breathless, chest heaving as she made to rush past him, but Jon caught her by the arm, forcing her back.</p><p>His dark eyes were like a raging storm, his mouth a permanent frown as he fought to find the words to say to her. \u201cI\u2026 No,\u201d he finally admitted, shaking his head as all of the fight went out of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d He thought of his friend, Sam, and how he would have to know the fate of his family. He thought of the North, already locked into a long winter, now with thousands of soliders to feed. He thought of the dragons that had come with them, dragons that would know no difference between livestock or children, that would eat what should have been theirs. This was why he did not deserve a crown, a title of any kind. He knew nothing of ruling beyond pretty speeches and wielding a sword. But this girl before him\u2026 She knew it better than him. Her blue eyes were dark with grief, red rimmed and swollen, telling him she\u2019d been crying up here. Now he understood why she\u2019d been hiding. She took her role as Lady of Winterfell seriously and she\u2019d not wanted anyone to see her in such a state. \u201cSansa\u2026 I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but we need her. No matter what she\u2019s done, we needed her dragonglass, her alliance.\u201d </p><p>Sansa laughed, pulling back again, shaking her head. \u201cOf course you would say that.\u201d Her tone was dark, a tone he\u2019d never heard her use before. Now he was recalling the other words she\u2019d said only moments before, lost to him when he\u2019d heard of the Tarly\u2019s death. <i>Your lover queen</i>, she had called Daenerys, reminding him that he had never told her the truth. He supposed in some ways, this was good, because it meant no one suspected a thing from him. But seeing her there looking like that, he knew he had to tell her the truth. He opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off as she spoke two simple, but life changing words. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d </p><p>For a moment the world seemed to stop spinning. Jon blinked, faltering as he gazed back at her, not quite seeing her. \u201cPregnant\u2026?\u201d He parroted back, recalling the night they\u2019d spent together before he had left for Dragonstone. At once the world began to spin again and Jon could not stop himself from drawing her back into his arms again. She struggled against him for a few moments, but then she ceased, clinging to the front of his tunic as she sagged against him. It was as if the weight of the world had finally lifted from her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sansa,\u201d he whispered against the crown of her head, one hand stroking her long, vibrant hair, the other around her waist pressed into the small of her back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured again, knowing in some ways he had failed her. He had coupled with her that night without thinking of what could happen, led by his feelings for her, and then had gone off to Dragonstone to forge an alliance with Daenerys. He\u2019d never thought doing such a thing would mean what it meant for him, pretending to fall for her, sharing her bed all so she would help him help the North. Though he could argue he had done it all for her, Jon knew he owed her more than that. More than it\u2019s all for you. Besides, he owed her the truth of what Bran had just told him hours before. </p><p>And so he opened his mouth and began to talk.</p><p>He talked for what could have been hours- long enough that the afternoon sun had begun to sink and cast the old tower into darkness. He had settled himself into the old chair, pulling her onto his lap while they talked. For the first time since his return, they could talk without worry of being discovered, without their important roles hanging over their heads. They could just be them- Jon and Sansa, not King in the North or Lady of Winterfell. Jon knew now he had a much bigger reason to fight the Night King, he had more than just a home to fight for. He had a child. He had a true love. Jon knew, without a doubt, there was nothing he wouldn\u2019t do for this woman tucked into his arms, her red hair a waterfall over her shoulder as she leaned her head on his. He did not deserve such a perfect woman. </p><p>It was a few minutes into the silence that had fallen after he\u2019d finished speaking and Jon felt her raise her head from his shoulder to face him. Over her shoulder he could see the sunset sky, crimson and gold streaking across the blue as the sun sank beneath the horizon. He had always thought of her at the sunset. \u201cI love you, Sansa.\u201d He spoke simply, knowing those words were the truth of his heart. Reaching out, he put his hand against the flat plane of her stomach, knowing in the coming months it would begin to curve with the growth of their child and he knew\u2026 He had to do the right thing by her and the child. He loved her with every piece of him. Leaning in, he captured her mouth with his and for a long moment, everything in his world was perfect.</p><p>But as always, nothing could stay perfect forever. </p><p>They both heard the footsteps a moment too late- as they broke apart and turned, it was Jaime Lannister standing there, looking pale and worried. But for a single moment, his expression changed and he smiled, as if he understood, watching as Sansa slid from Jon\u2019s lap and stood, Jon rising a moment later. \u201cMy lord, a white walker has been spotted outside Wintertown.\u201d Back to business and both Jon and Sansa could appreciate that. She felt a chill rush through her and she could not stop herself from clutching his hand. \u201cAnd so it begins.\u201d Jaime said before he turned and went from the room, leaving them alone once again.</p><p>Though he would have given anything to remain up there in that broken tower with Sansa, he knew what he had to do. And so he kept his hand in hers, walking her down the crumbling stone steps and back out into the falling darkness of night, leading her back towards the doors that would lead them inside. \u201cGather what you need and then I will take you to the crypts.\u201d He shook his head when she opened her mouth, as if she meant to argue with him. \u201cYou will be safest there.\u201d She sighed but then nodded, giving his hand a single squeeze before she made to go, but a grip on her hand made her turn back. \u201cBut first\u2026 Meet me in the godswood.\u201d Her eyes widened for a moment but then she nodded and then he let her go, watching as she disappeared around a corner, off to begin taking command of Winterfell, preparing its inhabitants for the fight to come.</p><p>And Jon went out into the courtyard, joining Jaime and Tormund and all of the others, where they would speak one last time about their battle plans. Then\u2026 The fight would begin. But first, he had something important to handle. Excusing himself, he wandered back into Winterfell and found Sam with Gilly, already ushering her down the hall that would lead them into the crypts. \u201cSam\u2026\u201d Jon caught his attention and the man turned, his easy going smile appearing at the sight of him. \u201cCan I borrow you, for just a short time?\u201d Sam arched a brow in question but then nodded, following after him after sending Gilly and baby Sam down to where they would be safe in the fight to come.</p><p>Sam asked no questions as they approached the heart tree and for that, Jon was thankful. He knew that through the faith of the Old Gods that there were no priests, no specific person needed to marry two people. And so he called upon the only person he could trust with such a thing. </p><p>Standing there beneath the heart tree, it was only a few minutes before he heard her approaching footsteps. She had changed gowns, a new gown of the darkest blues, something quite like fish scales, reminding him of her tie to House Tully through Catelyn Stark. He could catch glimpses of it beneath her cloak in the dying sunlight. \u201cJon, what\u2019s going on?\u201d She asked, close enough now that she noticed Sam behind him. He said nothing as he took her hands and drew her close, breathing in her sweet, familiar scent. </p><p>\u201cMarry me.\u201d </p><p>A smile curved on her lips and she then nodded, needing no words to say in a moment like this. And so Jon pulled from his doublet a single winter rose, its blue petals soft and scented as he tucked it into her hair, a call back to the mother he had never known. Then, taking her by the hands, they turned to face Sam who smiled and began to speak, weaving the words that would commit them to each other before the Old Gods and the New, words that would no matter what happened in the end of the war, protect her and their child. </p><p>Then he took her to the crypts and left her there with the others who could not fight in the battle, holding onto her for a moment longer than he\u2019d intended, whispering words against her ear. \u201cUntil morning, wife\u2026\u201d </p><p>And then\u2026 He was gone. Sansa stood watching him go, her heart beating fast in her chest, knowing this very well could have been the last time she saw him alive.<i> No</i>, she told herself, <i>you can\u2019t think like that.</i> Without thinking, she put a hand to her abdomen and knew Jon would come back for her\u2026 No, he would come back for them. And that was all she could hope for. It was all she could believe. </p>",

SO i decided to write it.\u00a0</p><p>this is a two part mini fic, part 2 will probably come soon! (probably today lmao)</p><p>anyways</p><p>i credit <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJHsK6Pc1_SMBWpoQTzURow\" target=\"_blank\">@athimbleful</a> &amp;</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUcZI4n7t2BGnO1ob5iZwvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@sepedarodatiga</a> both who had posted about this theory and got me REALLY excited. hopefully you guys all enjoy part 1 of this :)</p>[[MORE]]<p>She had been waiting for this moment for weeks. </p><p>Standing there on the battlements, Sansa watched as Jon and company arrived, reminding her much of the day years ago when Robert Baratheon had come to Winterfell. Only this time\u2026 There were dragons. As they flew overhead, she could not stop the cold sense of dread that settled into the pit of her stomach, knowing these dragons were supposed to be their saviors\u2026 But they would be the North\u2019s end. Sansa turned and crossed the battlement, her eyes never once straying from the sight of those two dragons, wondering if all was to be lost. These dragons, they\u2019d eat them out of house and home. Not to mention the thousands of soldiers marching their way into Wintertown and down to Winterfell. The long line of them seemed endless. Sansa shuddered, a sudden chill racing the length of her spine as she turned back to face front. </p><p>And then she saw them.</p><p>It was Jon and with him a woman she knew had to be Daenerys Targaryen. They were far but even from such a distance her silver hair was unmistakable. Swallowing down her fears, Sansa made her way down from the battlements, back down towards the courtyard where already people had begun to gather. Arya and Brienne already stood across the way, an odd looking pair to say the least, but the sight of them gave her courage. Bran was missing, but she wasn\u2019t surprised he\u2019d not come down to greet this Dragon queen and her army. He said he had to speak with Jon and while it had seemed important, he had not spoken of the details. She had begun to grow accustomed to her changed siblings- both Arya and Bran were far from the people she recalled from childhood. Though, she supposed they must have thought the same of her. She took a single step forward, preparing herself to join Arya and Brienne, but the gates suddenly opened and it was Jon alone on his horse, not a soul with him as he rode through. </p><p>Sansa felt her heart turnover, her breath catching in her throat as Jon slid down from his horse, his eyes only on her. He crossed the courtyard in several strides, taking her into his arms before everyone there. He was warm and solid, the feeling of his arms around her like that of a perfect dream. \u201cTrust in me.\u201d Was all he whispered, his breath warm against the shell of her ear as her eyes raised, seeing the silver-haired woman as she approached, her horse left behind somewhere else. Another man walked beside her, a man she did not recognize, but Sansa could see he would not stray from her side. </p><p>Jon released her a moment later, stepping back as Daenerys stepped up before them, a smile twitching on her lips. For a moment, Sansa was awestruck by the queen\u2019s beauty- her violet eyes were like that of a spring bloom, her skin pale and probably soft to the touch. But then she caught herself, remembering who she was and what was happening, and Sansa looked down at her from where she stood. \u201cWinterfell is yours, your grace,\u201d she said by way of a greeting, her words an echo of those her own father had spoken to Robert Baratheon so long ago. The dragon queen smiled again, exchanging pleasantries for only a moment longer before Sansa bid a serving man to her side, indicating for him to show the queen to the rooms she\u2019d had prepared for her. </p><p>The moment the queen had disappeared through the doors leading inside, Arya had pounced, and for the first time since their own reunion Sansa saw a piece of the little sister she\u2019d once had. Sansa watched as they embraced, Jon\u2019s smile as true as she had always thought it would be. A moment later Jon was turning back to her, his dark eyes finding her own, and Sansa\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She had so much to tell him\u2026 So very much she wasn\u2019t even sure where to begin. \u201cJon\u2026 I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should see that she\u2019s settled properly.\u201d Jon suddenly spoke, looking towards the doors that Daenerys had just disappeared through. Sansa blinked but her face did not betray her and she merely nodded, saying she understood. She watched him go, that sinking feeling returning as she absently put a hand to her abdomen, wondering what he would say when she told him the truth. </p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>He hated hearing her say those words.</p><p><i>Winterfell is yours, your grace.</i> Sansa\u2019s words echoed through his mind, over and over again, every time like a knife to his gut. They had worked so hard to gain Winterfell back and now, just like that, it belonged to someone else. He knew it must have killed her to say such a thing to anyone, let alone this foreign queen he\u2019d brought with him. He knew what it must have looked like to anyone- him riding into Winterfell beside the beautiful dragon queen- but this was how it had to be. No matter what happened, he had to ensure everyone around him believed his motives just as much as Daenerys herself did. Soon\u2026 Soon he would tell Sansa the truth. But for now, even her he would have to keep in the dark.</p><p>He did as he said, making his way to Daenerys\u2019 rooms to ensure she would be comfortable there; to his shock, he found her lodged in the Lord\u2019s chambers, Sansa\u2019s own chambers. The same ones he\u2019d given to her months before when they had won the battle against Ramsay Bolton. First her home, now her own rooms? Knocking on the door, Daenerys opened it with a smile, her picture-like features glowing with renewed warmth. \u201cJon,\u201d she greeted, allowing him entrance, shutting the door behind him. She had shed her warm, white jacket and blood red gloves, both thrown over the back of the chair closest to the fire. \u201cYour sister seems\u2026\u201d She trailed off, as if trying to find the right word to say without causing offense. \u201cWell, she\u2019s quite beautiful.\u201d Daenerys finally recovered, chuckling softly. \u201cThough it would seem she was not happy to welcome me to Winterfell.\u201d She returned to the chair she\u2019d clearly been sitting in before his arrival, her long silver hair falling across one shoulder as she leaned over to begin unlacing her boots. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive her, she\u2019s only just got Winterfell back. It must pain her to offer her home to someone else, queen or no queen.\u201d Jon stepped further into the room, closer to the fire that brought him no warmth at all. He found he wanted nothing more than to return to Sansa. Jon knew he\u2019d upset her out in the courtyard, leaving her so quickly\u2026 But all of this\u2026 It was for her. \u201cI just wanted to ensure you were comfortable.\u201d Daenerys raised her head to look at him then, perhaps taken by surprise, but then her features softened and she nodded. </p><p>They made small talk for just a few more minutes before Jon excused himself, heading down the corridors towards the Great Hall. Inside he found a single servant who jumped at the sight of him, offering a quick bow, stumbling over a greeting. \u201cWhat room is Lady Stark housed in now?\u201d The man replied that it was her old childhood rooms to which Jon thanked him and left, this time his feet carrying him towards the chambers he\u2019d not visited since their childhood days.</p><p>Knocking on her door, he heard her shuffling behind it before she opened it, her smile at once brightening her face. \u201cJon.\u201d She greeted as she stepped back, allowing him entrance, the door closing behind them. Without a word, Jon took her back into his arms, holding onto her for far longer than he\u2019d dared to do out in the courtyard. For a split second she stiffened, but then he felt her yield to his embrace, sinking against his chest as her own arms came around his waist. \u201cI missed you.\u201d Her voice was muffled against his shoulder and Jon drew back then, holding her at arms length, unwilling to completely release her from his grasp. It was as if she\u2019d grown more beautiful in these weeks since he\u2019d left, a glow about her he\u2019d never truly noticed before. He attributed it to her becoming healthy again, beginning to rise above everything that had happened to her. What else could it be, after all?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he replied, giving her another quick squeeze before finally letting go, though he felt the cold the moment she\u2019d gone from his arms. \u201cYou must tell me everything that\u2019s happened while I\u2019ve been away.\u201d Their correspondence had been slim, only a few quick and simple coded messages that hadn\u2019t given him much information. He took her by the hands, leading her towards her bed, both of them settling themselves upon the edge beside one another. Jon didn\u2019t let go of her hands, he couldn\u2019t, he had to still yet feel her soft skin against his. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to give her your rooms, you know.\u201d Jon said softly, gesturing about the room they sat in, his hand returning to sit upon her leg. \u201cShe could have stayed here, you didn\u2019t have to give her yours.\u201d </p><p>Sansa smiled, shaking her head. \u201cYou remember, father always gave his rooms to a visitor. It was the right thing to do.\u201d She slipped her other free hand into place over his, still settled there upon her thigh. <i>Tell him,</i> she thought, <i>tell him while you\u2019ve got the chance! </i>She opened her mouth as if she meant to speak but there came a knock on her chamber door and at once Jon jumped up, the door opening only a second later. </p><p>\u201cLady Stark\u2026 My lord, a rider\u2026 At the gate.\u201d The chamberlain said, looking from one to the other, not quite noticing the awkward look on either of their faces. \u201cHe says he\u2019s Jaime Lannister.\u201d Sansa was on her feet then, her blue eyes wide as she nodded, striding past Jon who followed after her, both of them making their way back down towards the courtyard. All she could think was later\u2026 I\u2019ll tell him later. A silent promise to herself and to the life she carried within her. </p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>So much had happened in these last few days, Sansa could scarcely wrap her mind around it.</p><p>Jaime Lannister had indeed showed up at their gates and pledged his life to her, to House Stark, and to the fight for the living. Though most would have distrusted him, Sansa accepted his vow and gave hers back, thus welcoming him into Winterfell. After living the life she had these last few years, she\u2019d learned to trust almost no one, but something about Jaime Lannister had felt\u2026 Honest. Had felt right. And Brienne had spoken to his true skill as a swordsman and she supposed if nothing else they would be glad to have him on their side in the fight against the Night King. </p><p>The Night King\u2026 The very thought of him sent shivers down her spine. As the days grew colder, she knew the final battle was coming. This would be a fight between the living and the dead and if they lost\u2026 No, she couldn\u2019t think that way. Jon wouldn\u2019t lose. She walked through the courtyard as she did every morning, surveying the smiths as they forged weapons made from the dragonglass Jon and Daenerys had brought. She stopped for a moment to exchange words with Gendry, who\u2019s easy going smile calmed her, his dark eyes a mirror of the father he\u2019d never got to know. It was well known who Gendry\u2019s father had been, the one time King Robert Baratheon, the only living bastard of his reign. Though he didn\u2019t know who his mother was, there were some who said it was a peasant girl, conceived back during his days as a soldier. She felt sad for him, for he\u2019d known no parent at all. </p><p>Taking her leave from Gendry, she made her way further down the line, stopping only when she caught sight of that silver-hair reflecting the cold, winter sun. Daenerys was walking along the outer edge of the courtyard with Jon and she was surprised to see the dragon queen leaning on his arm, head tilted in as she listened to Jon speak. Sansa felt her stomach sink, her cheeks growing warm as she watched them go, looking quite like lovers sneaking off to be alone. It was like a gut punch, the breath stolen from her very lungs. For a long moment she stood there, completely and utterly frozen, unable to look away as they continued on, her heart fluttering fast within her chest. </p><p>\u201cLady Stark?\u201d</p><p>She nearly lept from her skin, turning so fast she nearly stumbled and the man before her caught her elbow, righting her stance. \u201cForgive me, my lady.\u201d Jaime Lannister stood before her then, his eyes finding hers, perhaps taking note of the wild look to her own, but not mentioning it. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d He watched as her features changed and suddenly she was Lady Stark again, not the young girl he\u2019d just interrupted, a young woman forced to partake in a dark and gloomy world. \u201cI came to speak to you of something.\u201d He had held his tongue these first few days at Winterfell, knowing this alliance with the dragon queen was vital to their war against the Night King, but\u2026 He had pledged himself to this young woman and her house. He owed her the truth and the knowledge he had of all he\u2019d witnessed Daenerys Targaryen do. \u201cMight we walk?\u201d He offered her his arm then and she took it, allowing him to lead her, all the while beginning the long conversation they would have to have.</p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>She tried to tell herself it didn\u2019t matter. Jon didn\u2019t owe her anything, after all. It was true\u2026 They had slept together that night before he left for Dragonstone. She had wanted it as much as he had, so she didn\u2019t blame him for the aftermath, she knew as well as any woman what coupling could lead to. How she\u2019d gone this long without conceiving a child had convinced her she was barren- had Ramsay not beat her for thinking so, too? Besides\u2026 There were ways of handling an unwanted child. She and Jon were half-siblings, perhaps a child of theirs was an abomination\u2026 She reasoned with herself, citing Joffrey as reason enough to believe siblings should never create a child. But then again\u2026 Myrcella and Tommen had been normal enough, hadn\u2019t they?</p><p>Needing time alone, Sansa found herself climbing the old, crumbling steps up to the broken tower which years ago, Bran had fallen from. Or been pushed\u2026 Sometimes she wasn\u2019t certain which it had been. But, this place felt like the only place she\u2019d not be disturbed, the only place she could sit and think without someone saying Lady Stark. And it was here, only here, that she sank into an old dusty chair and began to cry. Heartfelt sobs that caught in her throat, her shoulders shaking as she curved into herself, wishing with all of her might that this could be easy. But life had proven to her time and time again that nothing was ever easy. And yet\u2026 This was more painful than she\u2019d ever thought heartbreak could be. </p><p>It was a short time later, hours perhaps, she had lost track of time, when she finally knew all of her tears had been shed. Rising up from the chair, she wiped her face dry and crossed the room to stand at the window, fingertips tracing the old, broken stones. \u201cSansa!\u201d She turned at the sound of his voice, her eyes taking in the sight of him in the doorway, his worry evident as he crossed the room in three great strides to take her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you!\u201d His tone was full of relief, his grip warm and strong, but Sansa pulled away and turned back to look out the window, unable to look at him. \u201cSansa\u2026?\u201d Now his tone had changed, surprised, perhaps even hurt. She knew what his face must have looked like, those dark eyes widening slightly, his jaw tight. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p><p><i>Everything.</i> The word was on the tip of her tongue, so close she almost said it. \u201cHave you asked her about the Battle of the Goldroad?\u201d She said instead, whirling back around to face him, watching as his face screwed up as it always did when he was thinking about what was said to him. It was endearing. She hated herself for thinking so. \u201cHas Samwell asked about his father? His brother?\u201d Jon was understanding then, slowly, but he was. \u201cShe burned them, Jon. Your lover queen has burned them alive. And all the supplies the Lannister army was taking back to King\u2019s Landing. All the food, grain, all of the supplies she could have sent North to feed her army and ours. Your <i>queen</i> has doomed us to starvation.\u201d By the time she finished ranting, she was breathless, chest heaving as she made to rush past him, but Jon caught her by the arm, forcing her back.</p><p>His dark eyes were like a raging storm, his mouth a permanent frown as he fought to find the words to say to her. \u201cI\u2026 No,\u201d he finally admitted, shaking his head as all of the fight went out of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d He thought of his friend, Sam, and how he would have to know the fate of his family. He thought of the North, already locked into a long winter, now with thousands of soliders to feed. He thought of the dragons that had come with them, dragons that would know no difference between livestock or children, that would eat what should have been theirs. This was why he did not deserve a crown, a title of any kind. He knew nothing of ruling beyond pretty speeches and wielding a sword. But this girl before him\u2026 She knew it better than him. Her blue eyes were dark with grief, red rimmed and swollen, telling him she\u2019d been crying up here. Now he understood why she\u2019d been hiding. She took her role as Lady of Winterfell seriously and she\u2019d not wanted anyone to see her in such a state. \u201cSansa\u2026 I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but we need her. No matter what she\u2019s done, we needed her dragonglass, her alliance.\u201d </p><p>Sansa laughed, pulling back again, shaking her head. \u201cOf course you would say that.\u201d Her tone was dark, a tone he\u2019d never heard her use before. Now he was recalling the other words she\u2019d said only moments before, lost to him when he\u2019d heard of the Tarly\u2019s death. <i>Your lover queen</i>, she had called Daenerys, reminding him that he had never told her the truth. He supposed in some ways, this was good, because it meant no one suspected a thing from him. But seeing her there looking like that, he knew he had to tell her the truth. He opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off as she spoke two simple, but life changing words. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d </p><p>For a moment the world seemed to stop spinning. Jon blinked, faltering as he gazed back at her, not quite seeing her. \u201cPregnant\u2026?\u201d He parroted back, recalling the night they\u2019d spent together before he had left for Dragonstone. At once the world began to spin again and Jon could not stop himself from drawing her back into his arms again. She struggled against him for a few moments, but then she ceased, clinging to the front of his tunic as she sagged against him. It was as if the weight of the world had finally lifted from her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sansa,\u201d he whispered against the crown of her head, one hand stroking her long, vibrant hair, the other around her waist pressed into the small of her back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured again, knowing in some ways he had failed her. He had coupled with her that night without thinking of what could happen, led by his feelings for her, and then had gone off to Dragonstone to forge an alliance with Daenerys. He\u2019d never thought doing such a thing would mean what it meant for him, pretending to fall for her, sharing her bed all so she would help him help the North. Though he could argue he had done it all for her, Jon knew he owed her more than that. More than it\u2019s all for you. Besides, he owed her the truth of what Bran had just told him hours before. </p><p>And so he opened his mouth and began to talk.</p><p>He talked for what could have been hours- long enough that the afternoon sun had begun to sink and cast the old tower into darkness. He had settled himself into the old chair, pulling her onto his lap while they talked. For the first time since his return, they could talk without worry of being discovered, without their important roles hanging over their heads. They could just be them- Jon and Sansa, not King in the North or Lady of Winterfell. Jon knew now he had a much bigger reason to fight the Night King, he had more than just a home to fight for. He had a child. He had a true love. Jon knew, without a doubt, there was nothing he wouldn\u2019t do for this woman tucked into his arms, her red hair a waterfall over her shoulder as she leaned her head on his. He did not deserve such a perfect woman. </p><p>It was a few minutes into the silence that had fallen after he\u2019d finished speaking and Jon felt her raise her head from his shoulder to face him. Over her shoulder he could see the sunset sky, crimson and gold streaking across the blue as the sun sank beneath the horizon. He had always thought of her at the sunset. \u201cI love you, Sansa.\u201d He spoke simply, knowing those words were the truth of his heart. Reaching out, he put his hand against the flat plane of her stomach, knowing in the coming months it would begin to curve with the growth of their child and he knew\u2026 He had to do the right thing by her and the child. He loved her with every piece of him. Leaning in, he captured her mouth with his and for a long moment, everything in his world was perfect.</p><p>But as always, nothing could stay perfect forever. </p><p>They both heard the footsteps a moment too late- as they broke apart and turned, it was Jaime Lannister standing there, looking pale and worried. But for a single moment, his expression changed and he smiled, as if he understood, watching as Sansa slid from Jon\u2019s lap and stood, Jon rising a moment later. \u201cMy lord, a white walker has been spotted outside Wintertown.\u201d Back to business and both Jon and Sansa could appreciate that. She felt a chill rush through her and she could not stop herself from clutching his hand. \u201cAnd so it begins.\u201d Jaime said before he turned and went from the room, leaving them alone once again.</p><p>Though he would have given anything to remain up there in that broken tower with Sansa, he knew what he had to do. And so he kept his hand in hers, walking her down the crumbling stone steps and back out into the falling darkness of night, leading her back towards the doors that would lead them inside. \u201cGather what you need and then I will take you to the crypts.\u201d He shook his head when she opened her mouth, as if she meant to argue with him. \u201cYou will be safest there.\u201d She sighed but then nodded, giving his hand a single squeeze before she made to go, but a grip on her hand made her turn back. \u201cBut first\u2026 Meet me in the godswood.\u201d Her eyes widened for a moment but then she nodded and then he let her go, watching as she disappeared around a corner, off to begin taking command of Winterfell, preparing its inhabitants for the fight to come.</p><p>And Jon went out into the courtyard, joining Jaime and Tormund and all of the others, where they would speak one last time about their battle plans. Then\u2026 The fight would begin. But first, he had something important to handle. Excusing himself, he wandered back into Winterfell and found Sam with Gilly, already ushering her down the hall that would lead them into the crypts. \u201cSam\u2026\u201d Jon caught his attention and the man turned, his easy going smile appearing at the sight of him. \u201cCan I borrow you, for just a short time?\u201d Sam arched a brow in question but then nodded, following after him after sending Gilly and baby Sam down to where they would be safe in the fight to come.</p><p>Sam asked no questions as they approached the heart tree and for that, Jon was thankful. He knew that through the faith of the Old Gods that there were no priests, no specific person needed to marry two people. And so he called upon the only person he could trust with such a thing. </p><p>Standing there beneath the heart tree, it was only a few minutes before he heard her approaching footsteps. She had changed gowns, a new gown of the darkest blues, something quite like fish scales, reminding him of her tie to House Tully through Catelyn Stark. He could catch glimpses of it beneath her cloak in the dying sunlight. \u201cJon, what\u2019s going on?\u201d She asked, close enough now that she noticed Sam behind him. He said nothing as he took her hands and drew her close, breathing in her sweet, familiar scent. </p><p>\u201cMarry me.\u201d </p><p>A smile curved on her lips and she then nodded, needing no words to say in a moment like this. And so Jon pulled from his doublet a single winter rose, its blue petals soft and scented as he tucked it into her hair, a call back to the mother he had never known. Then, taking her by the hands, they turned to face Sam who smiled and began to speak, weaving the words that would commit them to each other before the Old Gods and the New, words that would no matter what happened in the end of the war, protect her and their child. </p><p>Then he took her to the crypts and left her there with the others who could not fight in the battle, holding onto her for a moment longer than he\u2019d intended, whispering words against her ear. \u201cUntil morning, wife\u2026\u201d </p><p>And then\u2026 He was gone. Sansa stood watching him go, her heart beating fast in her chest, knowing this very well could have been the last time she saw him alive.<i> No</i>, she told herself, <i>you can\u2019t think like that.</i> Without thinking, she put a hand to her abdomen and knew Jon would come back for her\u2026 No, he would come back for them. And that was all she could hope for. It was all she could believe. </p>",
                "content": "<p>so over the last few days ive seen posts about sansa and the kidnapping plot with cersei. these particular posts have struck me with inspiration because i love a good plot twist like this. SO i decided to write it.&nbsp;</p><p>this is a two part mini fic, part 2 will probably come soon! (probably today lmao)</p><p>anyways</p><p>i credit <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJHsK6Pc1_SMBWpoQTzURow\" target=\"_blank\">@athimbleful</a> &amp;</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUcZI4n7t2BGnO1ob5iZwvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@sepedarodatiga</a> both who had posted about this theory and got me REALLY excited. hopefully you guys all enjoy part 1 of this :)</p><p>She had been waiting for this moment for weeks. </p><p>Standing there on the battlements, Sansa watched as Jon and company arrived, reminding her much of the day years ago when Robert Baratheon had come to Winterfell. Only this time&hellip; There were dragons. As they flew overhead, she could not stop the cold sense of dread that settled into the pit of her stomach, knowing these dragons were supposed to be their saviors&hellip; But they would be the North&rsquo;s end. Sansa turned and crossed the battlement, her eyes never once straying from the sight of those two dragons, wondering if all was to be lost. These dragons, they&rsquo;d eat them out of house and home. Not to mention the thousands of soldiers marching their way into Wintertown and down to Winterfell. The long line of them seemed endless. Sansa shuddered, a sudden chill racing the length of her spine as she turned back to face front. </p><p>And then she saw them.</p><p>It was Jon and with him a woman she knew had to be Daenerys Targaryen. They were far but even from such a distance her silver hair was unmistakable. Swallowing down her fears, Sansa made her way down from the battlements, back down towards the courtyard where already people had begun to gather. Arya and Brienne already stood across the way, an odd looking pair to say the least, but the sight of them gave her courage. Bran was missing, but she wasn&rsquo;t surprised he&rsquo;d not come down to greet this Dragon queen and her army. He said he had to speak with Jon and while it had seemed important, he had not spoken of the details. She had begun to grow accustomed to her changed siblings- both Arya and Bran were far from the people she recalled from childhood. Though, she supposed they must have thought the same of her. She took a single step forward, preparing herself to join Arya and Brienne, but the gates suddenly opened and it was Jon alone on his horse, not a soul with him as he rode through. </p><p>Sansa felt her heart turnover, her breath catching in her throat as Jon slid down from his horse, his eyes only on her. He crossed the courtyard in several strides, taking her into his arms before everyone there. He was warm and solid, the feeling of his arms around her like that of a perfect dream. &ldquo;Trust in me.&rdquo; Was all he whispered, his breath warm against the shell of her ear as her eyes raised, seeing the silver-haired woman as she approached, her horse left behind somewhere else. Another man walked beside her, a man she did not recognize, but Sansa could see he would not stray from her side. </p><p>Jon released her a moment later, stepping back as Daenerys stepped up before them, a smile twitching on her lips. For a moment, Sansa was awestruck by the queen&rsquo;s beauty- her violet eyes were like that of a spring bloom, her skin pale and probably soft to the touch. But then she caught herself, remembering who she was and what was happening, and Sansa looked down at her from where she stood. &ldquo;Winterfell is yours, your grace,&rdquo; she said by way of a greeting, her words an echo of those her own father had spoken to Robert Baratheon so long ago. The dragon queen smiled again, exchanging pleasantries for only a moment longer before Sansa bid a serving man to her side, indicating for him to show the queen to the rooms she&rsquo;d had prepared for her. </p><p>The moment the queen had disappeared through the doors leading inside, Arya had pounced, and for the first time since their own reunion Sansa saw a piece of the little sister she&rsquo;d once had. Sansa watched as they embraced, Jon&rsquo;s smile as true as she had always thought it would be. A moment later Jon was turning back to her, his dark eyes finding her own, and Sansa&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat. She had so much to tell him&hellip; So very much she wasn&rsquo;t even sure where to begin. &ldquo;Jon&hellip; I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should see that she&rsquo;s settled properly.&rdquo; Jon suddenly spoke, looking towards the doors that Daenerys had just disappeared through. Sansa blinked but her face did not betray her and she merely nodded, saying she understood. She watched him go, that sinking feeling returning as she absently put a hand to her abdomen, wondering what he would say when she told him the truth. </p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>He hated hearing her say those words.</p><p><i>Winterfell is yours, your grace.</i> Sansa&rsquo;s words echoed through his mind, over and over again, every time like a knife to his gut. They had worked so hard to gain Winterfell back and now, just like that, it belonged to someone else. He knew it must have killed her to say such a thing to anyone, let alone this foreign queen he&rsquo;d brought with him. He knew what it must have looked like to anyone- him riding into Winterfell beside the beautiful dragon queen- but this was how it had to be. No matter what happened, he had to ensure everyone around him believed his motives just as much as Daenerys herself did. Soon&hellip; Soon he would tell Sansa the truth. But for now, even her he would have to keep in the dark.</p><p>He did as he said, making his way to Daenerys&rsquo; rooms to ensure she would be comfortable there; to his shock, he found her lodged in the Lord&rsquo;s chambers, Sansa&rsquo;s own chambers. The same ones he&rsquo;d given to her months before when they had won the battle against Ramsay Bolton. First her home, now her own rooms? Knocking on the door, Daenerys opened it with a smile, her picture-like features glowing with renewed warmth. &ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she greeted, allowing him entrance, shutting the door behind him. She had shed her warm, white jacket and blood red gloves, both thrown over the back of the chair closest to the fire. &ldquo;Your sister seems&hellip;&rdquo; She trailed off, as if trying to find the right word to say without causing offense. &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s quite beautiful.&rdquo; Daenerys finally recovered, chuckling softly. &ldquo;Though it would seem she was not happy to welcome me to Winterfell.&rdquo; She returned to the chair she&rsquo;d clearly been sitting in before his arrival, her long silver hair falling across one shoulder as she leaned over to begin unlacing her boots. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to forgive her, she&rsquo;s only just got Winterfell back. It must pain her to offer her home to someone else, queen or no queen.&rdquo; Jon stepped further into the room, closer to the fire that brought him no warmth at all. He found he wanted nothing more than to return to Sansa. Jon knew he&rsquo;d upset her out in the courtyard, leaving her so quickly&hellip; But all of this&hellip; It was for her. &ldquo;I just wanted to ensure you were comfortable.&rdquo; Daenerys raised her head to look at him then, perhaps taken by surprise, but then her features softened and she nodded. </p><p>They made small talk for just a few more minutes before Jon excused himself, heading down the corridors towards the Great Hall. Inside he found a single servant who jumped at the sight of him, offering a quick bow, stumbling over a greeting. &ldquo;What room is Lady Stark housed in now?&rdquo; The man replied that it was her old childhood rooms to which Jon thanked him and left, this time his feet carrying him towards the chambers he&rsquo;d not visited since their childhood days.</p><p>Knocking on her door, he heard her shuffling behind it before she opened it, her smile at once brightening her face. &ldquo;Jon.&rdquo; She greeted as she stepped back, allowing him entrance, the door closing behind them. Without a word, Jon took her back into his arms, holding onto her for far longer than he&rsquo;d dared to do out in the courtyard. For a split second she stiffened, but then he felt her yield to his embrace, sinking against his chest as her own arms came around his waist. &ldquo;I missed you.&rdquo; Her voice was muffled against his shoulder and Jon drew back then, holding her at arms length, unwilling to completely release her from his grasp. It was as if she&rsquo;d grown more beautiful in these weeks since he&rsquo;d left, a glow about her he&rsquo;d never truly noticed before. He attributed it to her becoming healthy again, beginning to rise above everything that had happened to her. What else could it be, after all?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you,&rdquo; he replied, giving her another quick squeeze before finally letting go, though he felt the cold the moment she&rsquo;d gone from his arms. &ldquo;You must tell me everything that&rsquo;s happened while I&rsquo;ve been away.&rdquo; Their correspondence had been slim, only a few quick and simple coded messages that hadn&rsquo;t given him much information. He took her by the hands, leading her towards her bed, both of them settling themselves upon the edge beside one another. Jon didn&rsquo;t let go of her hands, he couldn&rsquo;t, he had to still yet feel her soft skin against his. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to give her your rooms, you know.&rdquo; Jon said softly, gesturing about the room they sat in, his hand returning to sit upon her leg. &ldquo;She could have stayed here, you didn&rsquo;t have to give her yours.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa smiled, shaking her head. &ldquo;You remember, father always gave his rooms to a visitor. It was the right thing to do.&rdquo; She slipped her other free hand into place over his, still settled there upon her thigh. <i>Tell him,</i> she thought, <i>tell him while you&rsquo;ve got the chance! </i>She opened her mouth as if she meant to speak but there came a knock on her chamber door and at once Jon jumped up, the door opening only a second later. </p><p>&ldquo;Lady Stark&hellip; My lord, a rider&hellip; At the gate.&rdquo; The chamberlain said, looking from one to the other, not quite noticing the awkward look on either of their faces. &ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s Jaime Lannister.&rdquo; Sansa was on her feet then, her blue eyes wide as she nodded, striding past Jon who followed after her, both of them making their way back down towards the courtyard. All she could think was later&hellip; I&rsquo;ll tell him later. A silent promise to herself and to the life she carried within her. </p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>So much had happened in these last few days, Sansa could scarcely wrap her mind around it.</p><p>Jaime Lannister had indeed showed up at their gates and pledged his life to her, to House Stark, and to the fight for the living. Though most would have distrusted him, Sansa accepted his vow and gave hers back, thus welcoming him into Winterfell. After living the life she had these last few years, she&rsquo;d learned to trust almost no one, but something about Jaime Lannister had felt&hellip; Honest. Had felt right. And Brienne had spoken to his true skill as a swordsman and she supposed if nothing else they would be glad to have him on their side in the fight against the Night King. </p><p>The Night King&hellip; The very thought of him sent shivers down her spine. As the days grew colder, she knew the final battle was coming. This would be a fight between the living and the dead and if they lost&hellip; No, she couldn&rsquo;t think that way. Jon wouldn&rsquo;t lose. She walked through the courtyard as she did every morning, surveying the smiths as they forged weapons made from the dragonglass Jon and Daenerys had brought. She stopped for a moment to exchange words with Gendry, who&rsquo;s easy going smile calmed her, his dark eyes a mirror of the father he&rsquo;d never got to know. It was well known who Gendry&rsquo;s father had been, the one time King Robert Baratheon, the only living bastard of his reign. Though he didn&rsquo;t know who his mother was, there were some who said it was a peasant girl, conceived back during his days as a soldier. She felt sad for him, for he&rsquo;d known no parent at all. </p><p>Taking her leave from Gendry, she made her way further down the line, stopping only when she caught sight of that silver-hair reflecting the cold, winter sun. Daenerys was walking along the outer edge of the courtyard with Jon and she was surprised to see the dragon queen leaning on his arm, head tilted in as she listened to Jon speak. Sansa felt her stomach sink, her cheeks growing warm as she watched them go, looking quite like lovers sneaking off to be alone. It was like a gut punch, the breath stolen from her very lungs. For a long moment she stood there, completely and utterly frozen, unable to look away as they continued on, her heart fluttering fast within her chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Lady Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>She nearly lept from her skin, turning so fast she nearly stumbled and the man before her caught her elbow, righting her stance. &ldquo;Forgive me, my lady.&rdquo; Jaime Lannister stood before her then, his eyes finding hers, perhaps taking note of the wild look to her own, but not mentioning it. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to startle you.&rdquo; He watched as her features changed and suddenly she was Lady Stark again, not the young girl he&rsquo;d just interrupted, a young woman forced to partake in a dark and gloomy world. &ldquo;I came to speak to you of something.&rdquo; He had held his tongue these first few days at Winterfell, knowing this alliance with the dragon queen was vital to their war against the Night King, but&hellip; He had pledged himself to this young woman and her house. He owed her the truth and the knowledge he had of all he&rsquo;d witnessed Daenerys Targaryen do. &ldquo;Might we walk?&rdquo; He offered her his arm then and she took it, allowing him to lead her, all the while beginning the long conversation they would have to have.</p><p>[ x x x ]</p><p>She tried to tell herself it didn&rsquo;t matter. Jon didn&rsquo;t owe her anything, after all. It was true&hellip; They had slept together that night before he left for Dragonstone. She had wanted it as much as he had, so she didn&rsquo;t blame him for the aftermath, she knew as well as any woman what coupling could lead to. How she&rsquo;d gone this long without conceiving a child had convinced her she was barren- had Ramsay not beat her for thinking so, too? Besides&hellip; There were ways of handling an unwanted child. She and Jon were half-siblings, perhaps a child of theirs was an abomination&hellip; She reasoned with herself, citing Joffrey as reason enough to believe siblings should never create a child. But then again&hellip; Myrcella and Tommen had been normal enough, hadn&rsquo;t they?</p><p>Needing time alone, Sansa found herself climbing the old, crumbling steps up to the broken tower which years ago, Bran had fallen from. Or been pushed&hellip; Sometimes she wasn&rsquo;t certain which it had been. But, this place felt like the only place she&rsquo;d not be disturbed, the only place she could sit and think without someone saying Lady Stark. And it was here, only here, that she sank into an old dusty chair and began to cry. Heartfelt sobs that caught in her throat, her shoulders shaking as she curved into herself, wishing with all of her might that this could be easy. But life had proven to her time and time again that nothing was ever easy. And yet&hellip; This was more painful than she&rsquo;d ever thought heartbreak could be. </p><p>It was a short time later, hours perhaps, she had lost track of time, when she finally knew all of her tears had been shed. Rising up from the chair, she wiped her face dry and crossed the room to stand at the window, fingertips tracing the old, broken stones. &ldquo;Sansa!&rdquo; She turned at the sound of his voice, her eyes taking in the sight of him in the doorway, his worry evident as he crossed the room in three great strides to take her into his arms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere for you!&rdquo; His tone was full of relief, his grip warm and strong, but Sansa pulled away and turned back to look out the window, unable to look at him. &ldquo;Sansa&hellip;?&rdquo; Now his tone had changed, surprised, perhaps even hurt. She knew what his face must have looked like, those dark eyes widening slightly, his jaw tight. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; </p><p><i>Everything.</i> The word was on the tip of her tongue, so close she almost said it. &ldquo;Have you asked her about the Battle of the Goldroad?&rdquo; She said instead, whirling back around to face him, watching as his face screwed up as it always did when he was thinking about what was said to him. It was endearing. She hated herself for thinking so. &ldquo;Has Samwell asked about his father? His brother?&rdquo; Jon was understanding then, slowly, but he was. &ldquo;She burned them, Jon. Your lover queen has burned them alive. And all the supplies the Lannister army was taking back to King&rsquo;s Landing. All the food, grain, all of the supplies she could have sent North to feed her army and ours. Your <i>queen</i> has doomed us to starvation.&rdquo; By the time she finished ranting, she was breathless, chest heaving as she made to rush past him, but Jon caught her by the arm, forcing her back.</p><p>His dark eyes were like a raging storm, his mouth a permanent frown as he fought to find the words to say to her. &ldquo;I&hellip; No,&rdquo; he finally admitted, shaking his head as all of the fight went out of him. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He thought of his friend, Sam, and how he would have to know the fate of his family. He thought of the North, already locked into a long winter, now with thousands of soliders to feed. He thought of the dragons that had come with them, dragons that would know no difference between livestock or children, that would eat what should have been theirs. This was why he did not deserve a crown, a title of any kind. He knew nothing of ruling beyond pretty speeches and wielding a sword. But this girl before him&hellip; She knew it better than him. Her blue eyes were dark with grief, red rimmed and swollen, telling him she&rsquo;d been crying up here. Now he understood why she&rsquo;d been hiding. She took her role as Lady of Winterfell seriously and she&rsquo;d not wanted anyone to see her in such a state. &ldquo;Sansa&hellip; I know you don&rsquo;t want to hear this, but we need her. No matter what she&rsquo;s done, we needed her dragonglass, her alliance.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa laughed, pulling back again, shaking her head. &ldquo;Of course you would say that.&rdquo; Her tone was dark, a tone he&rsquo;d never heard her use before. Now he was recalling the other words she&rsquo;d said only moments before, lost to him when he&rsquo;d heard of the Tarly&rsquo;s death. <i>Your lover queen</i>, she had called Daenerys, reminding him that he had never told her the truth. He supposed in some ways, this was good, because it meant no one suspected a thing from him. But seeing her there looking like that, he knew he had to tell her the truth. He opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off as she spoke two simple, but life changing words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant.&rdquo; </p><p>For a moment the world seemed to stop spinning. Jon blinked, faltering as he gazed back at her, not quite seeing her. &ldquo;Pregnant&hellip;?&rdquo; He parroted back, recalling the night they&rsquo;d spent together before he had left for Dragonstone. At once the world began to spin again and Jon could not stop himself from drawing her back into his arms again. She struggled against him for a few moments, but then she ceased, clinging to the front of his tunic as she sagged against him. It was as if the weight of the world had finally lifted from her shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Sansa,&rdquo; he whispered against the crown of her head, one hand stroking her long, vibrant hair, the other around her waist pressed into the small of her back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he murmured again, knowing in some ways he had failed her. He had coupled with her that night without thinking of what could happen, led by his feelings for her, and then had gone off to Dragonstone to forge an alliance with Daenerys. He&rsquo;d never thought doing such a thing would mean what it meant for him, pretending to fall for her, sharing her bed all so she would help him help the North. Though he could argue he had done it all for her, Jon knew he owed her more than that. More than it&rsquo;s all for you. Besides, he owed her the truth of what Bran had just told him hours before. </p><p>And so he opened his mouth and began to talk.</p><p>He talked for what could have been hours- long enough that the afternoon sun had begun to sink and cast the old tower into darkness. He had settled himself into the old chair, pulling her onto his lap while they talked. For the first time since his return, they could talk without worry of being discovered, without their important roles hanging over their heads. They could just be them- Jon and Sansa, not King in the North or Lady of Winterfell. Jon knew now he had a much bigger reason to fight the Night King, he had more than just a home to fight for. He had a child. He had a true love. Jon knew, without a doubt, there was nothing he wouldn&rsquo;t do for this woman tucked into his arms, her red hair a waterfall over her shoulder as she leaned her head on his. He did not deserve such a perfect woman. </p><p>It was a few minutes into the silence that had fallen after he&rsquo;d finished speaking and Jon felt her raise her head from his shoulder to face him. Over her shoulder he could see the sunset sky, crimson and gold streaking across the blue as the sun sank beneath the horizon. He had always thought of her at the sunset. &ldquo;I love you, Sansa.&rdquo; He spoke simply, knowing those words were the truth of his heart. Reaching out, he put his hand against the flat plane of her stomach, knowing in the coming months it would begin to curve with the growth of their child and he knew&hellip; He had to do the right thing by her and the child. He loved her with every piece of him. Leaning in, he captured her mouth with his and for a long moment, everything in his world was perfect.</p><p>But as always, nothing could stay perfect forever. </p><p>They both heard the footsteps a moment too late- as they broke apart and turned, it was Jaime Lannister standing there, looking pale and worried. But for a single moment, his expression changed and he smiled, as if he understood, watching as Sansa slid from Jon&rsquo;s lap and stood, Jon rising a moment later. &ldquo;My lord, a white walker has been spotted outside Wintertown.&rdquo; Back to business and both Jon and Sansa could appreciate that. She felt a chill rush through her and she could not stop herself from clutching his hand. &ldquo;And so it begins.&rdquo; Jaime said before he turned and went from the room, leaving them alone once again.</p><p>Though he would have given anything to remain up there in that broken tower with Sansa, he knew what he had to do. And so he kept his hand in hers, walking her down the crumbling stone steps and back out into the falling darkness of night, leading her back towards the doors that would lead them inside. &ldquo;Gather what you need and then I will take you to the crypts.&rdquo; He shook his head when she opened her mouth, as if she meant to argue with him. &ldquo;You will be safest there.&rdquo; She sighed but then nodded, giving his hand a single squeeze before she made to go, but a grip on her hand made her turn back. &ldquo;But first&hellip; Meet me in the godswood.&rdquo; Her eyes widened for a moment but then she nodded and then he let her go, watching as she disappeared around a corner, off to begin taking command of Winterfell, preparing its inhabitants for the fight to come.</p><p>And Jon went out into the courtyard, joining Jaime and Tormund and all of the others, where they would speak one last time about their battle plans. Then&hellip; The fight would begin. But first, he had something important to handle. Excusing himself, he wandered back into Winterfell and found Sam with Gilly, already ushering her down the hall that would lead them into the crypts. &ldquo;Sam&hellip;&rdquo; Jon caught his attention and the man turned, his easy going smile appearing at the sight of him. &ldquo;Can I borrow you, for just a short time?&rdquo; Sam arched a brow in question but then nodded, following after him after sending Gilly and baby Sam down to where they would be safe in the fight to come.</p><p>Sam asked no questions as they approached the heart tree and for that, Jon was thankful. He knew that through the faith of the Old Gods that there were no priests, no specific person needed to marry two people. And so he called upon the only person he could trust with such a thing. </p><p>Standing there beneath the heart tree, it was only a few minutes before he heard her approaching footsteps. She had changed gowns, a new gown of the darkest blues, something quite like fish scales, reminding him of her tie to House Tully through Catelyn Stark. He could catch glimpses of it beneath her cloak in the dying sunlight. &ldquo;Jon, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; She asked, close enough now that she noticed Sam behind him. He said nothing as he took her hands and drew her close, breathing in her sweet, familiar scent. </p><p>&ldquo;Marry me.&rdquo; </p><p>A smile curved on her lips and she then nodded, needing no words to say in a moment like this. And so Jon pulled from his doublet a single winter rose, its blue petals soft and scented as he tucked it into her hair, a call back to the mother he had never known. Then, taking her by the hands, they turned to face Sam who smiled and began to speak, weaving the words that would commit them to each other before the Old Gods and the New, words that would no matter what happened in the end of the war, protect her and their child. </p><p>Then he took her to the crypts and left her there with the others who could not fight in the battle, holding onto her for a moment longer than he&rsquo;d intended, whispering words against her ear. &ldquo;Until morning, wife&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>And then&hellip; He was gone. Sansa stood watching him go, her heart beating fast in her chest, knowing this very well could have been the last time she saw him alive.<i> No</i>, she told herself, <i>you can&rsquo;t think like that.</i> Without thinking, she put a hand to her abdomen and knew Jon would come back for her&hellip; No, he would come back for them. And that was all she could hope for. It was all she could believe. </p>",
