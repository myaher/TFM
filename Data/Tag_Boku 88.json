In the middle of the night Ochako would make every piece of furniture in the common area float. Tsu would position all the furniture, and Sero would tape it all upside down on the roof. Nobody would suspect the three of them working together </p><p>- Iida would send out a mass text message saying \u201cI hope you are all ready for the exam we have today. the exam that was definitely talked about. and is today. There is no reason why this would be a fake message because I am your class representative and you trust me.\u201d Only a few students fall for it and are seen crying in the library an hour before class </p><p>- Kirishima and Denki decide the night before to dye their hair to each other\u2019s colour, and styling it appropriately. Denki walks around all day with spiky red hair and Kirishima with an electric yellow mess on his head</p><p>- Momo decides to just. Make hundreds of tiny allmight figurines. Little allmights the size of your finger that she hides throughout ua. Everyone of course suspects Deku as being the cause of this, and he spends the day trying to collect as many as he can </p><p>- Todoroki tries to prank Izuku and his brain cell does its best. He makes Deku a cake that says \u201chappy birthday izuku\u201d, and then proceeds to explain to Deku that \u201cit\u2019s a prank. Because it\u2019s not your birthday today. I pranked you Izuku\u201d and Deku just blushes and laughs because todoroki is trying his best</p><p>- Little does he know that todoroki goes home after school to meet up with natsuo and fiyumi to absolutely WRECK the house with all might merch. Endeavour loses it. Half way through cooking dinner he realizes that all the dishes in the house have been replaced with \u201c#1 hero allmight\u201d dishes. All the clothes in his closet have been replaced with allmight onesies. His toothbrush says \u201cI am here\u201d on the handle. Todoroki and Natsuo sit in the corner of the room slurping their allmight sponsored noodles</p><p>- Denki\u2019s prank is pretending to not know that it\u2019s April fools day. He decided that this was the best way to freak the class out. Just pretending that he has no idea </p>",
