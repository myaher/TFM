        "body": "<p>Title: A Week In Boston, part 8<b><br/></b></p><p>Pairing: Chris Evans x Reader</p><p>Summary: It was your first vacation in years. One week all by yourself in the big city of Boston. No rules. No expectations. Just a list of places to go and things you wanted to see. That all changed when you run into a certain blue-eyed Boston boy who turned your world upside down. Is it really possible to fall in love with someone in just one week? Or is that kind of love just a fairytale?</p><p>Warning: language</p><p>Word Count:\t3300</p><p>Author\u2019s Note: I\u2019m sorry for the delay. The loss of my parents home has meant I\u2019m spending every weekend on the road going to help them clean up and rebuild. This has really cut into my writing time I\u2019m working hard to keep bringing you the content you love. I just ask that you be patient with me while my family works through this.\u00a0 As always, feedback is much appreciated.</p><p>Thank you to the amazing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdqJ3syPOMR3iOJOiNK9NCQ\" target=\"_blank\">@until-theend-oftheline</a> for betaing this fic.

Seeing his big brown eyes made Y/N realize just how much she missed him. She talked to him for a moment, his tail wag wildly, \u00a0before Rachel had to let him outside.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Rachel went on once she\u2019d returned, \u201cwhat\u2019s on the agenda today?\u201d</p><p>A rueful smile spread across Y/N\u2019s face. Rachel had been so keen on the idea of her spending more time with Chris that she knew she would flip when she heard about what he had planned for her today.</p><!-- more --><p>The memory of their almost kiss the day before played through her mind. Just thinking about the way he had looked at her made her heart race. She\u2019d played the moment over and over again in her dreams. Only this time, their lips had actually met.</p><p>\u201cChris is taking me to a Red Sox game,\u201d she said. Y/N braced for the ear piercing scream she was sure was coming, but all she got was silence. Her speculation quickly turned to dread when she watched a cheshire cat grin take over her little sister\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Rachel shrugged. \u201cNothing.\u201d<i> Bullshit!</i></p><p>\u201cThat is not a nothing look. Spill it, Rach.\u201d Rachel just shook her head and continued to insist that she didn\u2019t have anything to say. \u201cYou\u2019re a brat you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you love me,\u201d Rachel said, cheeky grin firmly planted on her face.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>The sibling shared a small laugh before Rachel had to get back to her latest project. Y/N promised she would call her and tell her about the game the next day before saying a final goodbye and ending the call.</p><p>She glanced over at the clock and decided to get ready to go. Chris had texted her saying to wear something warm. While the skies were only supposed to be partly cloudy today, it could get pretty chilly in the stadium once the sun went down. Grabbing her favorite sweater, she threw on a pair of boots and headed down to meet Chris.</p><hr><p>There was nothing like Fenway Park on gameday. Some people would say it was too crowded and noisy, but not Chris. Chris loved the hustle and bustle of the fans clamoring for their seats and cheering their team on to victory. The smell of stale peanuts and over priced beer were just as much a part of the experience as anything else. That was why he\u2019d chosen the seats he did.</p><p>Chris had bought a pair of tickets about half way up the main deck in the outfield along the third base line. They were good seats. He and Y/N would still be able to see everything without being close enough for photographers to easily spot too focused on them.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to a baseball game before?\u201d Chris asked.</p><p>He waited for her to take her seat before handing her a hot dog and taking a seat beside her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Y/N said, a giant smile plastered on her face. \u201cThis is the one where they score touchdowns right?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 face paled, and his eyes went wide when he looked at her. Surely she couldn\u2019t be serious. How was it possible that someone could know that little about baseball? His brain started to short circuit.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><p>A sly grin made its way onto Y/N\u2019s face. Chris hung his head in defeat. He should have known that she was messing with him.</p><p>He pointed a finger at her. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N busted out in laughter, her head falling back against her shoulders. The sound was infections, and Chris found himself laughing along with her. He caught a young boy watching them in wonder out of the corner of his eye and gave him a smile and nod before reaching up to pull the cap farther down over his eyes before anyone else noticed him.</p><p>That was the only downside to getting seats like that. It made it easier for people to recognize him. If he was up in a box, the media was more likely to see him. There was always a member of the press up there scoping out the scene. Getting seats behind the dugout wouldn\u2019t have been any better. A camera would have picked them up the second they sat down. No. This was the best option if Chris wanted to avoid any major fan interactions. He\u2019d been fortunate enough not to have one with Y/N so far. He worried about what that side of his life would look like to her. She wasn\u2019t used to that, and he was afraid that if he wasn\u2019t careful it would cause him to lose what ground he had gained if it happened too soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just messing with you,\u201d she said through her laughter.</p><p>She jostled his arm with her shoulder, almost making him spill his beer in his lap.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Chris shouted, trying to hold the beer out away from his body before he ended up wearing it. \u201cAre you trying to pay me back for the night we met or something?\u201d</p><p>Y/N threw her head back and laughed. \u201cNo. No. I\u2019m sorry. I was just teasing.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled. He loved her laugh. It never failed to make him smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d He waived her off. \u201cSo you know baseball?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded. \u201cMy dad used to take me to watch the minor league team a few towns over play every fall.\u201d</p><p>Chris looked surprised. While he may not have expected her to know much, he hadn\u2019t counted on her actually being a fan. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Y/N started telling him stories about some of the players she\u2019d been able to see before they made it to the big time. She even told him about getting to see a few All Stars working their way back from injury.</p><p>Chris listened to the whole thing with a smile on his face. The soft whimsical look that came over her face when she talked about the way her dad would explain rules and strategies to her warmed his heart.</p><p>\u201cDad tried taking Rachel a few times,\u201d she said, \u201cbut she never really got into it. So it stayed our thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still go with him?\u201d</p><p>A sad look crossed her features, and she shook her head. \u201cHe died a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>Chris stopped with his beer half way to his lips. He hadn\u2019t been expecting that. Watching the cloud fall over her now, he could tell that it was something that still hurt her, and that was the last thing he ever wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Y/N waved him off, assuring him it was okay. He placed his hand on her knee and gave it a comforting squeeze. She smiled at him in thanks before turning her attention back to the field. There was an awkward beat of silence before the announcer\u2019s voice boomed through the stadium, announcing the starting lineups for both teams.</p><p>They watched the game with all of the excitement of a kid on Christmas. They cheered and clapped when the Red Sox turned a double play, and booed with the rest of the crowd when one of their players was called out at home. Chris noticed it was a bit darker than normal and looked down at his watch. 3pm. He looked up at the sky and noticed a collection of dark grey clouds blocking the sun and shrugged before turning his attention back to the game.</p><p>He saw Y/N jump out of the corner of his eye and turned to look at her. She was staring down at her hand before looking up at the sky with a frown etched on her face.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cFeel what?\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, the sky suddenly ripped open, and rain began falling down in buckets on the crowd.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Chris exclaimed, flinching when the cold water soaked through his sweater and began chilling him to the bone in a matter of second.</p><p>The announcer came on to say that the game was under a weather delay. The field team raced to get the tarp over the infield while the fans headed for cover.</p><p>Chris put his hand at the small of Y/N\u2019s back and started leading her up the stadium steps. She nearly tripped over her feet on her way up the stairs once or twice, but he managed to keep her on her feet.</p><p>Everyone crowded under the awning, watching the rain fall rapidly onto their now empty seats while they waited for it to pass. Chris looked down at Y/N to see her shoulders curling in on themselves while her eyes darted around the crowded space, her breath coming in short gasps. Chris knew that look. He\u2019d worn it many times himself. It meant the walls felt like they were closing in, and the only thing you could hear over the roar around you was the defining sound of your heart trying to beat its way up into your throat. He needed to get her out of there and fast, or this night was going to take a turn for the worst.</p><p>He scanned the area around them for somewhere else to go. Maybe getting out of the tightly packed space would help calm her. That\u2019s when he spotted a small alcove off to the side leading to a dark hallway. It looked like it was used for maintenance or security, but nobody seemed to have noticed it. It was perfect.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, gesturing with his head. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Chris took Y/N\u2019s hand in his and started making his way through the crowd. A chorus of \u201cExcuse me. Sorry. Pardon me\u201d clearing their way. He felt the grip on his hand tighten and looked back to see Y/N desperately trying to push her way through, but the crowd wasn\u2019t letting her pass. Chris\u2019 heart sped up when he saw the look of panic on her face. There was no way he was losing her in this crowd. He made his way back and pushed her in front of him, using his body as a shield to move her through the space until they reached the dim hallway.</p><p>\u201cHey. Hey. Look at me.\u201d Chris tried to draw her attention towards him, but her eyes kept darting around the hallway. He took her face in both hands and forced her to look at him. \u201cFocus on me alright? Just breath.\u201d He guided her through some slow deep breaths. \u201cClose your eyes and breath with me okay? Just listen to my voice. In.\u201d He inhaled. \u201cOut.\u201d Exhale.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough. Chris could still see her trembling and her breathing was still rushed and shallow. He racked his brain for all the things he had learned to deal with his own anxiety and settled on one that he\u2019d always found helpful.</p><p>\u201cListen to the rain,\u201d he told her. \u201cDrown out everything but the rain. Hear it hitting the roof, the bleachers. Smell it in the air.\u201d He watched the tension slowly easy from her shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Now breath.\u201d</p><p>He lead her through a few more calming breaths before her eyes fluttered open. Chris took a step back and studied her face for any sign that she was not okay.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Y/N sighed. \u201cI thought I was gonna suffocate back there.\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 heart rate slowly returned to normal. Now that she was back with him, he looked her over for any sign of injury.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Are you alright?\u201d he asked, his hands fluttering just above her body. \u201cIt got kind of crazy back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Chris.\u201d He gave her an unbelieving look. \u201cSee,\u201d she started turning in a circle, \u201cnothing to worry abo\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s foot slipped in a small puddle on the concrete, and Chris\u2019 heart leapt into his throat. Visions of her skull cracking against the hard floor raced through his mind as he shoot forward to catch her. He grabbed a hold of her and pulled her tight against his chest, but the momentum kept pulling them forward. He tried to keep his footing, but they were still falling. Chris placed a hand at the back of her head to cushion the blow as they crashed into the opposite wall, trapping her body between it and him.</p><p>It took Chris a moment to realize they\u2019d stopped before he was able to pull himself away from her. When he looked down to see if she was alright, his breath stopped. She was so close. He could smell the light floral scent of her shampoo, and it was making his head spin. He knew he should be stepping away from her, but something about her wide luminous eyes was drawing him in. He watched those eyes dart down to his lips before moving back up to meet his.</p><p>Chris\u2019 heart started beating double time. It was beating so hard that he was sure she could feel it trying to beat it\u2019s way through his chest. His eyes moved across her face before settling on her lips.</p><p>He kept his movements slow, giving Y/N a chance to pull away. He licked his lips and started to lean in. The last trace of doubt left his mind when her eyes fluttered closed, and she closed the last of the space between them.</p><p>Everything around him stopped. Her lips were soft and warm despite the chilly Autumn air. They molded to his perfectly, filling him with a warmth and life he hadn\u2019t realized he was missing. He could feel her hand fisting around the front of his sweatshirt, and he brought his a hand up to cradle her cheek. The kiss was perfect. It was sweet and tender. It was everything he could have ever hoped for and so much more.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen.\u201d The sound of the announcer\u2019s voice broke the spell. Chris pulled away from her quickly, his breath coming in short puffs of air. \u201cDue to severe weather conditions, the game has been canceled and will be rescheduled for a later date. Please make your ways to the exits where you will be given instructions on claiming your ticket for the game once it is rescheduled.\u201d</p><p>Chris didn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t. He stared down into her y/e/c eyes, gasping for breath while his mind reeled from their kiss. His eyes danced across her face, seeing the look of shock on her face made him nervous. <i>Does she regret it? </i>That doubt vanished from his mind when he saw her smile. He beamed down at her.</p><p>\u201cShould we go?\u201d he asked, brushing a piece of hair out of her face..</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Chris took a step back. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, taking her hand in his own, \u201cI\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><hr><p>Her insides were still bubbling with excitement. Kissing Chris had been even more wonderful than she imagined. It was gentle, and warm, and filled the pit of her stomach with so many butterflies that she wasn\u2019t sure they would ever stop.</p><p>Y/N glanced over at Chris as he drove. Every time he glanced over at her, he glanced in her direction like he could feel her watching him. A look of affection would pull the corner of his mouth into a half smile that she was more than willing to return.</p><p>She was disappointed when Chris pulled up outside her door. She didn\u2019t want the night to end. She wanted to spend more time with him, to feel his hand in hers, to kiss him again. The click of the door opening beside her startled her. Chris had never gone around to open her door at the end of the night. Sure he did it other places, but not here. He\u2019d always just dropped her off and waited in the car until she made it through the door. The fact that he was doing it now thrilled her.</p><p>Y/N took the hand Chris held out to her and felt her heart flutter all over again as he help her out of the car. She kept her hand in his as the walked to the door. She kept rolling things over and over again in her mind, trying to find a way to extend their time together, but nothing had come to her by the time they reached the door.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d she said softly and turned to go inside. A slight tug on her hand made her pause and turn back towards Chris. He was smiling at her again in that way that turned her insides to mush. He took a step forward and brought a hand up to run his thumb along her jaw.</p><p>\u201cHave dinner with me tomorrow?\u201d he asked simply, running his thumb back and forth across her skin.</p><p>A radiant smile spread across her face. She didn\u2019t even hesitate before answering. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick you up at seven?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded. Chris smiled back at her before leaning in to give her a sweet kiss. Y/N rested her hands against his chest and leaned in a bit more, savoring the feel of his lips against her own before reluctantly pulling away.</p><p>They exchanged whispered good nights before Y/N fumbled behind her for the door handle and went inside. She peeked through the curtain to watch Chris make his way back to the car. He paused at the bottom of the steps and did a little fist pump that had her giggling. He turned back towards the building, and Y/N quickly ducked out of sight before he could catch her spying. She heard the car pull away and decided to head up to her room for the night.</p><p>Y/N was practically floated up the steps. She couldn\u2019t remember a time when she felt this happy. <i>I kissed him. I actually kissed him.</i> She suppressed a girlish squeal of joy until she was able to make it to her room and scream her excitement into one of the pillows on her bed.</p><p>She rolled over onto her back and looked up at the ceiling. She replayed the night over again in her mind like a movie. The laughs. The game. The kiss. It was all so perfect. Another squeal left her lips at the thought of seeing him again tomorrow. True she\u2019d seen him every day while she\u2019d been here, but this felt different. That kiss changed everything.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><a href=\"http://blacktithe7.tumblr.com/post/183802059295/a-week-in-boston-part-9-chris-evans-x-reader\" target=\"_blank\">Part

Rachel had been so keen on the idea of her spending more time with Chris that she knew she would flip when she heard about what he had planned for her today.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The memory of their almost kiss the day before played through her mind. Just thinking about the way he had looked at her made her heart race. She\u2019d played the moment over and over again in her dreams. Only this time, their lips had actually met.</p><p>\u201cChris is taking me to a Red Sox game,\u201d she said. Y/N braced for the ear piercing scream she was sure was coming, but all she got was silence. Her speculation quickly turned to dread when she watched a cheshire cat grin take over her little sister\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Rachel shrugged. \u201cNothing.\u201d<i> Bullshit!</i></p><p>\u201cThat is not a nothing look. Spill it, Rach.\u201d Rachel just shook her head and continued to insist that she didn\u2019t have anything to say. \u201cYou\u2019re a brat you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you love me,\u201d Rachel said, cheeky grin firmly planted on her face.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>The sibling shared a small laugh before Rachel had to get back to her latest project. Y/N promised she would call her and tell her about the game the next day before saying a final goodbye and ending the call.</p><p>She glanced over at the clock and decided to get ready to go. Chris had texted her saying to wear something warm. While the skies were only supposed to be partly cloudy today, it could get pretty chilly in the stadium once the sun went down. Grabbing her favorite sweater, she threw on a pair of boots and headed down to meet Chris.</p><hr><p>There was nothing like Fenway Park on gameday. Some people would say it was too crowded and noisy, but not Chris. Chris loved the hustle and bustle of the fans clamoring for their seats and cheering their team on to victory. The smell of stale peanuts and over priced beer were just as much a part of the experience as anything else. That was why he\u2019d chosen the seats he did.</p><p>Chris had bought a pair of tickets about half way up the main deck in the outfield along the third base line. They were good seats. He and Y/N would still be able to see everything without being close enough for photographers to easily spot too focused on them.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to a baseball game before?\u201d Chris asked.</p><p>He waited for her to take her seat before handing her a hot dog and taking a seat beside her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Y/N said, a giant smile plastered on her face. \u201cThis is the one where they score touchdowns right?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 face paled, and his eyes went wide when he looked at her. Surely she couldn\u2019t be serious. How was it possible that someone could know that little about baseball? His brain started to short circuit.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><p>A sly grin made its way onto Y/N\u2019s face. Chris hung his head in defeat. He should have known that she was messing with him.</p><p>He pointed a finger at her. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N busted out in laughter, her head falling back against her shoulders. The sound was infections, and Chris found himself laughing along with her. He caught a young boy watching them in wonder out of the corner of his eye and gave him a smile and nod before reaching up to pull the cap farther down over his eyes before anyone else noticed him.</p><p>That was the only downside to getting seats like that. It made it easier for people to recognize him. If he was up in a box, the media was more likely to see him. There was always a member of the press up there scoping out the scene. Getting seats behind the dugout wouldn\u2019t have been any better. A camera would have picked them up the second they sat down. No. This was the best option if Chris wanted to avoid any major fan interactions. He\u2019d been fortunate enough not to have one with Y/N so far. He worried about what that side of his life would look like to her. She wasn\u2019t used to that, and he was afraid that if he wasn\u2019t careful it would cause him to lose what ground he had gained if it happened too soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just messing with you,\u201d she said through her laughter.</p><p>She jostled his arm with her shoulder, almost making him spill his beer in his lap.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Chris shouted, trying to hold the beer out away from his body before he ended up wearing it. \u201cAre you trying to pay me back for the night we met or something?\u201d</p><p>Y/N threw her head back and laughed. \u201cNo. No. I\u2019m sorry. I was just teasing.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled. He loved her laugh. It never failed to make him smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d He waived her off. \u201cSo you know baseball?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded. \u201cMy dad used to take me to watch the minor league team a few towns over play every fall.\u201d</p><p>Chris looked surprised. While he may not have expected her to know much, he hadn\u2019t counted on her actually being a fan. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Y/N started telling him stories about some of the players she\u2019d been able to see before they made it to the big time. She even told him about getting to see a few All Stars working their way back from injury.</p><p>Chris listened to the whole thing with a smile on his face. The soft whimsical look that came over her face when she talked about the way her dad would explain rules and strategies to her warmed his heart.</p><p>\u201cDad tried taking Rachel a few times,\u201d she said, \u201cbut she never really got into it. So it stayed our thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still go with him?\u201d</p><p>A sad look crossed her features, and she shook her head. \u201cHe died a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>Chris stopped with his beer half way to his lips. He hadn\u2019t been expecting that. Watching the cloud fall over her now, he could tell that it was something that still hurt her, and that was the last thing he ever wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Y/N waved him off, assuring him it was okay. He placed his hand on her knee and gave it a comforting squeeze. She smiled at him in thanks before turning her attention back to the field. There was an awkward beat of silence before the announcer\u2019s voice boomed through the stadium, announcing the starting lineups for both teams.</p><p>They watched the game with all of the excitement of a kid on Christmas. They cheered and clapped when the Red Sox turned a double play, and booed with the rest of the crowd when one of their players was called out at home. Chris noticed it was a bit darker than normal and looked down at his watch. 3pm. He looked up at the sky and noticed a collection of dark grey clouds blocking the sun and shrugged before turning his attention back to the game.</p><p>He saw Y/N jump out of the corner of his eye and turned to look at her. She was staring down at her hand before looking up at the sky with a frown etched on her face.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cFeel what?\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, the sky suddenly ripped open, and rain began falling down in buckets on the crowd.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Chris exclaimed, flinching when the cold water soaked through his sweater and began chilling him to the bone in a matter of second.</p><p>The announcer came on to say that the game was under a weather delay. The field team raced to get the tarp over the infield while the fans headed for cover.</p><p>Chris put his hand at the small of Y/N\u2019s back and started leading her up the stadium steps. She nearly tripped over her feet on her way up the stairs once or twice, but he managed to keep her on her feet.</p><p>Everyone crowded under the awning, watching the rain fall rapidly onto their now empty seats while they waited for it to pass. Chris looked down at Y/N to see her shoulders curling in on themselves while her eyes darted around the crowded space, her breath coming in short gasps. Chris knew that look. He\u2019d worn it many times himself. It meant the walls felt like they were closing in, and the only thing you could hear over the roar around you was the defining sound of your heart trying to beat its way up into your throat. He needed to get her out of there and fast, or this night was going to take a turn for the worst.</p><p>He scanned the area around them for somewhere else to go. Maybe getting out of the tightly packed space would help calm her. That\u2019s when he spotted a small alcove off to the side leading to a dark hallway. It looked like it was used for maintenance or security, but nobody seemed to have noticed it. It was perfect.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, gesturing with his head. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Chris took Y/N\u2019s hand in his and started making his way through the crowd. A chorus of \u201cExcuse me. Sorry. Pardon me\u201d clearing their way. He felt the grip on his hand tighten and looked back to see Y/N desperately trying to push her way through, but the crowd wasn\u2019t letting her pass. Chris\u2019 heart sped up when he saw the look of panic on her face. There was no way he was losing her in this crowd. He made his way back and pushed her in front of him, using his body as a shield to move her through the space until they reached the dim hallway.</p><p>\u201cHey. Hey. Look at me.\u201d Chris tried to draw her attention towards him, but her eyes kept darting around the hallway. He took her face in both hands and forced her to look at him. \u201cFocus on me alright? Just breath.\u201d He guided her through some slow deep breaths. \u201cClose your eyes and breath with me okay? Just listen to my voice. In.\u201d He inhaled. \u201cOut.\u201d Exhale.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough. Chris could still see her trembling and her breathing was still rushed and shallow. He racked his brain for all the things he had learned to deal with his own anxiety and settled on one that he\u2019d always found helpful.</p><p>\u201cListen to the rain,\u201d he told her. \u201cDrown out everything but the rain. Hear it hitting the roof, the bleachers. Smell it in the air.\u201d He watched the tension slowly easy from her shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Now breath.\u201d</p><p>He lead her through a few more calming breaths before her eyes fluttered open. Chris took a step back and studied her face for any sign that she was not okay.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Y/N sighed. \u201cI thought I was gonna suffocate back there.\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 heart rate slowly returned to normal. Now that she was back with him, he looked her over for any sign of injury.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Are you alright?\u201d he asked, his hands fluttering just above her body. \u201cIt got kind of crazy back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Chris.\u201d He gave her an unbelieving look. \u201cSee,\u201d she started turning in a circle, \u201cnothing to worry abo\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s foot slipped in a small puddle on the concrete, and Chris\u2019 heart leapt into his throat. Visions of her skull cracking against the hard floor raced through his mind as he shoot forward to catch her. He grabbed a hold of her and pulled her tight against his chest, but the momentum kept pulling them forward. He tried to keep his footing, but they were still falling. Chris placed a hand at the back of her head to cushion the blow as they crashed into the opposite wall, trapping her body between it and him.</p><p>It took Chris a moment to realize they\u2019d stopped before he was able to pull himself away from her. When he looked down to see if she was alright, his breath stopped. She was so close. He could smell the light floral scent of her shampoo, and it was making his head spin. He knew he should be stepping away from her, but something about her wide luminous eyes was drawing him in. He watched those eyes dart down to his lips before moving back up to meet his.</p><p>Chris\u2019 heart started beating double time. It was beating so hard that he was sure she could feel it trying to beat it\u2019s way through his chest. His eyes moved across her face before settling on her lips.</p><p>He kept his movements slow, giving Y/N a chance to pull away. He licked his lips and started to lean in. The last trace of doubt left his mind when her eyes fluttered closed, and she closed the last of the space between them.</p><p>Everything around him stopped. Her lips were soft and warm despite the chilly Autumn air. They molded to his perfectly, filling him with a warmth and life he hadn\u2019t realized he was missing. He could feel her hand fisting around the front of his sweatshirt, and he brought his a hand up to cradle her cheek. The kiss was perfect. It was sweet and tender. It was everything he could have ever hoped for and so much more.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen.\u201d The sound of the announcer\u2019s voice broke the spell. Chris pulled away from her quickly, his breath coming in short puffs of air. \u201cDue to severe weather conditions, the game has been canceled and will be rescheduled for a later date. Please make your ways to the exits where you will be given instructions on claiming your ticket for the game once it is rescheduled.\u201d</p><p>Chris didn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t. He stared down into her y/e/c eyes, gasping for breath while his mind reeled from their kiss. His eyes danced across her face, seeing the look of shock on her face made him nervous. <i>Does she regret it? </i>That doubt vanished from his mind when he saw her smile. He beamed down at her.</p><p>\u201cShould we go?\u201d he asked, brushing a piece of hair out of her face..</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Chris took a step back. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, taking her hand in his own, \u201cI\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><hr><p>Her insides were still bubbling with excitement. Kissing Chris had been even more wonderful than she imagined. It was gentle, and warm, and filled the pit of her stomach with so many butterflies that she wasn\u2019t sure they would ever stop.</p><p>Y/N glanced over at Chris as he drove. Every time he glanced over at her, he glanced in her direction like he could feel her watching him. A look of affection would pull the corner of his mouth into a half smile that she was more than willing to return.</p><p>She was disappointed when Chris pulled up outside her door. She didn\u2019t want the night to end. She wanted to spend more time with him, to feel his hand in hers, to kiss him again. The click of the door opening beside her startled her. Chris had never gone around to open her door at the end of the night. Sure he did it other places, but not here. He\u2019d always just dropped her off and waited in the car until she made it through the door. The fact that he was doing it now thrilled her.</p><p>Y/N took the hand Chris held out to her and felt her heart flutter all over again as he help her out of the car. She kept her hand in his as the walked to the door. She kept rolling things over and over again in her mind, trying to find a way to extend their time together, but nothing had come to her by the time they reached the door.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d she said softly and turned to go inside. A slight tug on her hand made her pause and turn back towards Chris. He was smiling at her again in that way that turned her insides to mush. He took a step forward and brought a hand up to run his thumb along her jaw.</p><p>\u201cHave dinner with me tomorrow?\u201d he asked simply, running his thumb back and forth across her skin.</p><p>A radiant smile spread across her face. She didn\u2019t even hesitate before answering. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick you up at seven?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded. Chris smiled back at her before leaning in to give her a sweet kiss. Y/N rested her hands against his chest and leaned in a bit more, savoring the feel of his lips against her own before reluctantly pulling away.</p><p>They exchanged whispered good nights before Y/N fumbled behind her for the door handle and went inside. She peeked through the curtain to watch Chris make his way back to the car. He paused at the bottom of the steps and did a little fist pump that had her giggling. He turned back towards the building, and Y/N quickly ducked out of sight before he could catch her spying. She heard the car pull away and decided to head up to her room for the night.</p><p>Y/N was practically floated up the steps. She couldn\u2019t remember a time when she felt this happy. <i>I kissed him. I actually kissed him.</i> She suppressed a girlish squeal of joy until she was able to make it to her room and scream her excitement into one of the pillows on her bed.</p><p>She rolled over onto her back and looked up at the ceiling. She replayed the night over again in her mind like a movie. The laughs. The game. The kiss. It was all so perfect. Another squeal left her lips at the thought of seeing him again tomorrow. True she\u2019d seen him every day while she\u2019d been here, but this felt different. That kiss changed everything.</p><p><br></p><p><b><a href=\"http://blacktithe7.tumblr.com/post/183802059295/a-week-in-boston-part-9-chris-evans-x-reader\" target=\"_blank\">Part

One week all by yourself in the big city of Boston. No rules. No expectations. Just a list of places to go and things you wanted to see. That all changed when you run into a certain blue-eyed Boston boy who turned your world upside down. Is it really possible to fall in love with someone in just one week? Or is that kind of love just a fairytale?</p><p>Warning: language</p><p>Word Count:\t3300</p><p>Author\u2019s Note: I\u2019m sorry for the delay. The loss of my parents home has meant I\u2019m spending every weekend on the road going to help them clean up and rebuild. This has really cut into my writing time I\u2019m working hard to keep bringing you the content you love. I just ask that you be patient with me while my family works through this.\u00a0 As always, feedback is much appreciated.</p><p>Thank you to the amazing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdqJ3syPOMR3iOJOiNK9NCQ\" target=\"_blank\">@until-theend-oftheline</a> for betaing this fic.

Seeing his big brown eyes made Y/N realize just how much she missed him. She talked to him for a moment, his tail wag wildly, \u00a0before Rachel had to let him outside.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Rachel went on once she\u2019d returned, \u201cwhat\u2019s on the agenda today?\u201d</p><p>A rueful smile spread across Y/N\u2019s face. Rachel had been so keen on the idea of her spending more time with Chris that she knew she would flip when she heard about what he had planned for her today.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The memory of their almost kiss the day before played through her mind. Just thinking about the way he had looked at her made her heart race. She\u2019d played the moment over and over again in her dreams. Only this time, their lips had actually met.</p><p>\u201cChris is taking me to a Red Sox game,\u201d she said. Y/N braced for the ear piercing scream she was sure was coming, but all she got was silence. Her speculation quickly turned to dread when she watched a cheshire cat grin take over her little sister\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Rachel shrugged. \u201cNothing.\u201d<i> Bullshit!</i></p><p>\u201cThat is not a nothing look. Spill it, Rach.\u201d Rachel just shook her head and continued to insist that she didn\u2019t have anything to say. \u201cYou\u2019re a brat you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you love me,\u201d Rachel said, cheeky grin firmly planted on her face.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>The sibling shared a small laugh before Rachel had to get back to her latest project. Y/N promised she would call her and tell her about the game the next day before saying a final goodbye and ending the call.</p><p>She glanced over at the clock and decided to get ready to go. Chris had texted her saying to wear something warm. While the skies were only supposed to be partly cloudy today, it could get pretty chilly in the stadium once the sun went down. Grabbing her favorite sweater, she threw on a pair of boots and headed down to meet Chris.</p><hr><p>There was nothing like Fenway Park on gameday. Some people would say it was too crowded and noisy, but not Chris. Chris loved the hustle and bustle of the fans clamoring for their seats and cheering their team on to victory. The smell of stale peanuts and over priced beer were just as much a part of the experience as anything else. That was why he\u2019d chosen the seats he did.</p><p>Chris had bought a pair of tickets about half way up the main deck in the outfield along the third base line. They were good seats. He and Y/N would still be able to see everything without being close enough for photographers to easily spot too focused on them.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to a baseball game before?\u201d Chris asked.</p><p>He waited for her to take her seat before handing her a hot dog and taking a seat beside her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Y/N said, a giant smile plastered on her face. \u201cThis is the one where they score touchdowns right?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 face paled, and his eyes went wide when he looked at her. Surely she couldn\u2019t be serious. How was it possible that someone could know that little about baseball? His brain started to short circuit.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><p>A sly grin made its way onto Y/N\u2019s face. Chris hung his head in defeat. He should have known that she was messing with him.</p><p>He pointed a finger at her. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N busted out in laughter, her head falling back against her shoulders. The sound was infections, and Chris found himself laughing along with her. He caught a young boy watching them in wonder out of the corner of his eye and gave him a smile and nod before reaching up to pull the cap farther down over his eyes before anyone else noticed him.</p><p>That was the only downside to getting seats like that. It made it easier for people to recognize him. If he was up in a box, the media was more likely to see him. There was always a member of the press up there scoping out the scene. Getting seats behind the dugout wouldn\u2019t have been any better. A camera would have picked them up the second they sat down. No. This was the best option if Chris wanted to avoid any major fan interactions. He\u2019d been fortunate enough not to have one with Y/N so far. He worried about what that side of his life would look like to her. She wasn\u2019t used to that, and he was afraid that if he wasn\u2019t careful it would cause him to lose what ground he had gained if it happened too soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just messing with you,\u201d she said through her laughter.</p><p>She jostled his arm with her shoulder, almost making him spill his beer in his lap.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Chris shouted, trying to hold the beer out away from his body before he ended up wearing it. \u201cAre you trying to pay me back for the night we met or something?\u201d</p><p>Y/N threw her head back and laughed. \u201cNo. No. I\u2019m sorry. I was just teasing.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled. He loved her laugh. It never failed to make him smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d He waived her off. \u201cSo you know baseball?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded. \u201cMy dad used to take me to watch the minor league team a few towns over play every fall.\u201d</p><p>Chris looked surprised. While he may not have expected her to know much, he hadn\u2019t counted on her actually being a fan. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Y/N started telling him stories about some of the players she\u2019d been able to see before they made it to the big time. She even told him about getting to see a few All Stars working their way back from injury.</p><p>Chris listened to the whole thing with a smile on his face. The soft whimsical look that came over her face when she talked about the way her dad would explain rules and strategies to her warmed his heart.</p><p>\u201cDad tried taking Rachel a few times,\u201d she said, \u201cbut she never really got into it. So it stayed our thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still go with him?\u201d</p><p>A sad look crossed her features, and she shook her head. \u201cHe died a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>Chris stopped with his beer half way to his lips. He hadn\u2019t been expecting that. Watching the cloud fall over her now, he could tell that it was something that still hurt her, and that was the last thing he ever wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Y/N waved him off, assuring him it was okay. He placed his hand on her knee and gave it a comforting squeeze. She smiled at him in thanks before turning her attention back to the field. There was an awkward beat of silence before the announcer\u2019s voice boomed through the stadium, announcing the starting lineups for both teams.</p><p>They watched the game with all of the excitement of a kid on Christmas. They cheered and clapped when the Red Sox turned a double play, and booed with the rest of the crowd when one of their players was called out at home. Chris noticed it was a bit darker than normal and looked down at his watch. 3pm. He looked up at the sky and noticed a collection of dark grey clouds blocking the sun and shrugged before turning his attention back to the game.</p><p>He saw Y/N jump out of the corner of his eye and turned to look at her. She was staring down at her hand before looking up at the sky with a frown etched on her face.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cFeel what?\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, the sky suddenly ripped open, and rain began falling down in buckets on the crowd.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Chris exclaimed, flinching when the cold water soaked through his sweater and began chilling him to the bone in a matter of second.</p><p>The announcer came on to say that the game was under a weather delay. The field team raced to get the tarp over the infield while the fans headed for cover.</p><p>Chris put his hand at the small of Y/N\u2019s back and started leading her up the stadium steps. She nearly tripped over her feet on her way up the stairs once or twice, but he managed to keep her on her feet.</p><p>Everyone crowded under the awning, watching the rain fall rapidly onto their now empty seats while they waited for it to pass. Chris looked down at Y/N to see her shoulders curling in on themselves while her eyes darted around the crowded space, her breath coming in short gasps. Chris knew that look. He\u2019d worn it many times himself. It meant the walls felt like they were closing in, and the only thing you could hear over the roar around you was the defining sound of your heart trying to beat its way up into your throat. He needed to get her out of there and fast, or this night was going to take a turn for the worst.</p><p>He scanned the area around them for somewhere else to go. Maybe getting out of the tightly packed space would help calm her. That\u2019s when he spotted a small alcove off to the side leading to a dark hallway. It looked like it was used for maintenance or security, but nobody seemed to have noticed it. It was perfect.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, gesturing with his head. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Chris took Y/N\u2019s hand in his and started making his way through the crowd. A chorus of \u201cExcuse me. Sorry. Pardon me\u201d clearing their way. He felt the grip on his hand tighten and looked back to see Y/N desperately trying to push her way through, but the crowd wasn\u2019t letting her pass. Chris\u2019 heart sped up when he saw the look of panic on her face. There was no way he was losing her in this crowd. He made his way back and pushed her in front of him, using his body as a shield to move her through the space until they reached the dim hallway.</p><p>\u201cHey. Hey. Look at me.\u201d Chris tried to draw her attention towards him, but her eyes kept darting around the hallway. He took her face in both hands and forced her to look at him. \u201cFocus on me alright? Just breath.\u201d He guided her through some slow deep breaths. \u201cClose your eyes and breath with me okay? Just listen to my voice. In.\u201d He inhaled. \u201cOut.\u201d Exhale.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough. Chris could still see her trembling and her breathing was still rushed and shallow. He racked his brain for all the things he had learned to deal with his own anxiety and settled on one that he\u2019d always found helpful.</p><p>\u201cListen to the rain,\u201d he told her. \u201cDrown out everything but the rain. Hear it hitting the roof, the bleachers. Smell it in the air.\u201d He watched the tension slowly easy from her shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Now breath.\u201d</p><p>He lead her through a few more calming breaths before her eyes fluttered open. Chris took a step back and studied her face for any sign that she was not okay.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Y/N sighed. \u201cI thought I was gonna suffocate back there.\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019 heart rate slowly returned to normal. Now that she was back with him, he looked her over for any sign of injury.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Are you alright?\u201d he asked, his hands fluttering just above her body. \u201cIt got kind of crazy back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Chris.\u201d He gave her an unbelieving look. \u201cSee,\u201d she started turning in a circle, \u201cnothing to worry abo\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s foot slipped in a small puddle on the concrete, and Chris\u2019 heart leapt into his throat. Visions of her skull cracking against the hard floor raced through his mind as he shoot forward to catch her. He grabbed a hold of her and pulled her tight against his chest, but the momentum kept pulling them forward. He tried to keep his footing, but they were still falling. Chris placed a hand at the back of her head to cushion the blow as they crashed into the opposite wall, trapping her body between it and him.</p><p>It took Chris a moment to realize they\u2019d stopped before he was able to pull himself away from her. When he looked down to see if she was alright, his breath stopped. She was so close. He could smell the light floral scent of her shampoo, and it was making his head spin. He knew he should be stepping away from her, but something about her wide luminous eyes was drawing him in. He watched those eyes dart down to his lips before moving back up to meet his.</p><p>Chris\u2019 heart started beating double time. It was beating so hard that he was sure she could feel it trying to beat it\u2019s way through his chest. His eyes moved across her face before settling on her lips.</p><p>He kept his movements slow, giving Y/N a chance to pull away. He licked his lips and started to lean in. The last trace of doubt left his mind when her eyes fluttered closed, and she closed the last of the space between them.</p><p>Everything around him stopped. Her lips were soft and warm despite the chilly Autumn air. They molded to his perfectly, filling him with a warmth and life he hadn\u2019t realized he was missing. He could feel her hand fisting around the front of his sweatshirt, and he brought his a hand up to cradle her cheek. The kiss was perfect. It was sweet and tender. It was everything he could have ever hoped for and so much more.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen.\u201d The sound of the announcer\u2019s voice broke the spell. Chris pulled away from her quickly, his breath coming in short puffs of air. \u201cDue to severe weather conditions, the game has been canceled and will be rescheduled for a later date. Please make your ways to the exits where you will be given instructions on claiming your ticket for the game once it is rescheduled.\u201d</p><p>Chris didn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t. He stared down into her y/e/c eyes, gasping for breath while his mind reeled from their kiss. His eyes danced across her face, seeing the look of shock on her face made him nervous. <i>Does she regret it? </i>That doubt vanished from his mind when he saw her smile. He beamed down at her.</p><p>\u201cShould we go?\u201d he asked, brushing a piece of hair out of her face..</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Chris took a step back. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, taking her hand in his own, \u201cI\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><hr><p>Her insides were still bubbling with excitement. Kissing Chris had been even more wonderful than she imagined. It was gentle, and warm, and filled the pit of her stomach with so many butterflies that she wasn\u2019t sure they would ever stop.</p><p>Y/N glanced over at Chris as he drove. Every time he glanced over at her, he glanced in her direction like he could feel her watching him. A look of affection would pull the corner of his mouth into a half smile that she was more than willing to return.</p><p>She was disappointed when Chris pulled up outside her door. She didn\u2019t want the night to end. She wanted to spend more time with him, to feel his hand in hers, to kiss him again. The click of the door opening beside her startled her. Chris had never gone around to open her door at the end of the night. Sure he did it other places, but not here. He\u2019d always just dropped her off and waited in the car until she made it through the door. The fact that he was doing it now thrilled her.</p><p>Y/N took the hand Chris held out to her and felt her heart flutter all over again as he help her out of the car. She kept her hand in his as the walked to the door. She kept rolling things over and over again in her mind, trying to find a way to extend their time together, but nothing had come to her by the time they reached the door.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d she said softly and turned to go inside. A slight tug on her hand made her pause and turn back towards Chris. He was smiling at her again in that way that turned her insides to mush. He took a step forward and brought a hand up to run his thumb along her jaw.</p><p>\u201cHave dinner with me tomorrow?\u201d he asked simply, running his thumb back and forth across her skin.</p><p>A radiant smile spread across her face. She didn\u2019t even hesitate before answering. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick you up at seven?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded. Chris smiled back at her before leaning in to give her a sweet kiss. Y/N rested her hands against his chest and leaned in a bit more, savoring the feel of his lips against her own before reluctantly pulling away.</p><p>They exchanged whispered good nights before Y/N fumbled behind her for the door handle and went inside. She peeked through the curtain to watch Chris make his way back to the car. He paused at the bottom of the steps and did a little fist pump that had her giggling. He turned back towards the building, and Y/N quickly ducked out of sight before he could catch her spying. She heard the car pull away and decided to head up to her room for the night.</p><p>Y/N was practically floated up the steps. She couldn\u2019t remember a time when she felt this happy. <i>I kissed him. I actually kissed him.</i> She suppressed a girlish squeal of joy until she was able to make it to her room and scream her excitement into one of the pillows on her bed.</p><p>She rolled over onto her back and looked up at the ceiling. She replayed the night over again in her mind like a movie. The laughs. The game. The kiss. It was all so perfect. Another squeal left her lips at the thought of seeing him again tomorrow. True she\u2019d seen him every day while she\u2019d been here, but this felt different. That kiss changed everything.</p><p><br></p><p><b><a href=\"http://blacktithe7.tumblr.com/post/183802059295/a-week-in-boston-part-9-chris-evans-x-reader\" target=\"_blank\">Part

                "content": "<p>Title: A Week In Boston, part 8<b><br /></b></p><p>Pairing: Chris Evans x Reader</p><p>Summary: It was your first vacation in years. One week all by yourself in the big city of Boston. No rules. No expectations. Just a list of places to go and things you wanted to see. That all changed when you run into a certain blue-eyed Boston boy who turned your world upside down. Is it really possible to fall in love with someone in just one week? Or is that kind of love just a fairytale?</p><p>Warning: language</p><p>Word Count:\t3300</p><p>Author&rsquo;s Note: I&rsquo;m sorry for the delay. The loss of my parents home has meant I&rsquo;m spending every weekend on the road going to help them clean up and rebuild.

Seeing his big brown eyes made Y/N realize just how much she missed him. She talked to him for a moment, his tail wag wildly, &nbsp;before Rachel had to let him outside.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Rachel went on once she&rsquo;d returned, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s on the agenda today?&rdquo;</p><p>A rueful smile spread across Y/N&rsquo;s face. Rachel had been so keen on the idea of her spending more time with Chris that she knew she would flip when she heard about what he had planned for her today.</p><p>The memory of their almost kiss the day before played through her mind. Just thinking about the way he had looked at her made her heart race. She&rsquo;d played the moment over and over again in her dreams. Only this time, their lips had actually met.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris is taking me to a Red Sox game,&rdquo; she said. Y/N braced for the ear piercing scream she was sure was coming, but all she got was silence. Her speculation quickly turned to dread when she watched a cheshire cat grin take over her little sister&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Rachel shrugged. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;<i> Bullshit!</i></p><p>&ldquo;That is not a nothing look. Spill it, Rach.&rdquo; Rachel just shook her head and continued to insist that she didn&rsquo;t have anything to say. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brat you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but you love me,&rdquo; Rachel said, cheeky grin firmly planted on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately.&rdquo;</p><p>The sibling shared a small laugh before Rachel had to get back to her latest project. Y/N promised she would call her and tell her about the game the next day before saying a final goodbye and ending the call.</p><p>She glanced over at the clock and decided to get ready to go. Chris had texted her saying to wear something warm. While the skies were only supposed to be partly cloudy today, it could get pretty chilly in the stadium once the sun went down. Grabbing her favorite sweater, she threw on a pair of boots and headed down to meet Chris.</p><hr /><p>There was nothing like Fenway Park on gameday. Some people would say it was too crowded and noisy, but not Chris. Chris loved the hustle and bustle of the fans clamoring for their seats and cheering their team on to victory. The smell of stale peanuts and over priced beer were just as much a part of the experience as anything else. That was why he&rsquo;d chosen the seats he did.</p><p>Chris had bought a pair of tickets about half way up the main deck in the outfield along the third base line. They were good seats. He and Y/N would still be able to see everything without being close enough for photographers to easily spot too focused on them.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever been to a baseball game before?&rdquo; Chris asked.</p><p>He waited for her to take her seat before handing her a hot dog and taking a seat beside her.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Y/N said, a giant smile plastered on her face. &ldquo;This is the one where they score touchdowns right?&rdquo;</p><p>Chris&rsquo; face paled, and his eyes went wide when he looked at her. Surely she couldn&rsquo;t be serious. How was it possible that someone could know that little about baseball? His brain started to short circuit.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>A sly grin made its way onto Y/N&rsquo;s face. Chris hung his head in defeat. He should have known that she was messing with him.</p><p>He pointed a finger at her. &ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N busted out in laughter, her head falling back against her shoulders. The sound was infections, and Chris found himself laughing along with her. He caught a young boy watching them in wonder out of the corner of his eye and gave him a smile and nod before reaching up to pull the cap farther down over his eyes before anyone else noticed him.</p><p>That was the only downside to getting seats like that. It made it easier for people to recognize him. If he was up in a box, the media was more likely to see him. There was always a member of the press up there scoping out the scene. Getting seats behind the dugout wouldn&rsquo;t have been any better. A camera would have picked them up the second they sat down. No. This was the best option if Chris wanted to avoid any major fan interactions. He&rsquo;d been fortunate enough not to have one with Y/N so far. He worried about what that side of his life would look like to her. She wasn&rsquo;t used to that, and he was afraid that if he wasn&rsquo;t careful it would cause him to lose what ground he had gained if it happened too soon.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just messing with you,&rdquo; she said through her laughter.</p><p>She jostled his arm with her shoulder, almost making him spill his beer in his lap.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; Chris shouted, trying to hold the beer out away from his body before he ended up wearing it. &ldquo;Are you trying to pay me back for the night we met or something?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N threw her head back and laughed. &ldquo;No. No. I&rsquo;m sorry. I was just teasing.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris smiled. He loved her laugh. It never failed to make him smile.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; He waived her off. &ldquo;So you know baseball?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded. &ldquo;My dad used to take me to watch the minor league team a few towns over play every fall.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris looked surprised. While he may not have expected her to know much, he hadn&rsquo;t counted on her actually being a fan. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N started telling him stories about some of the players she&rsquo;d been able to see before they made it to the big time. She even told him about getting to see a few All Stars working their way back from injury.</p><p>Chris listened to the whole thing with a smile on his face. The soft whimsical look that came over her face when she talked about the way her dad would explain rules and strategies to her warmed his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad tried taking Rachel a few times,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but she never really got into it. So it stayed our thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you still go with him?&rdquo;</p><p>A sad look crossed her features, and she shook her head. &ldquo;He died a few years ago.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris stopped with his beer half way to his lips. He hadn&rsquo;t been expecting that. Watching the cloud fall over her now, he could tell that it was something that still hurt her, and that was the last thing he ever wanted to do.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N waved him off, assuring him it was okay. He placed his hand on her knee and gave it a comforting squeeze. She smiled at him in thanks before turning her attention back to the field. There was an awkward beat of silence before the announcer&rsquo;s voice boomed through the stadium, announcing the starting lineups for both teams.</p><p>They watched the game with all of the excitement of a kid on Christmas. They cheered and clapped when the Red Sox turned a double play, and booed with the rest of the crowd when one of their players was called out at home. Chris noticed it was a bit darker than normal and looked down at his watch. 3pm. He looked up at the sky and noticed a collection of dark grey clouds blocking the sun and shrugged before turning his attention back to the game.</p><p>He saw Y/N jump out of the corner of his eye and turned to look at her. She was staring down at her hand before looking up at the sky with a frown etched on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you feel that?&rdquo; she asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Feel what?&rdquo;</p><p>As if on cue, the sky suddenly ripped open, and rain began falling down in buckets on the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; Chris exclaimed, flinching when the cold water soaked through his sweater and began chilling him to the bone in a matter of second.</p><p>The announcer came on to say that the game was under a weather delay. The field team raced to get the tarp over the infield while the fans headed for cover.</p><p>Chris put his hand at the small of Y/N&rsquo;s back and started leading her up the stadium steps. She nearly tripped over her feet on her way up the stairs once or twice, but he managed to keep her on her feet.</p><p>Everyone crowded under the awning, watching the rain fall rapidly onto their now empty seats while they waited for it to pass. Chris looked down at Y/N to see her shoulders curling in on themselves while her eyes darted around the crowded space, her breath coming in short gasps. Chris knew that look. He&rsquo;d worn it many times himself. It meant the walls felt like they were closing in, and the only thing you could hear over the roar around you was the defining sound of your heart trying to beat its way up into your throat. He needed to get her out of there and fast, or this night was going to take a turn for the worst.</p><p>He scanned the area around them for somewhere else to go. Maybe getting out of the tightly packed space would help calm her. That&rsquo;s when he spotted a small alcove off to the side leading to a dark hallway. It looked like it was used for maintenance or security, but nobody seemed to have noticed it. It was perfect.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said, gesturing with his head. &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris took Y/N&rsquo;s hand in his and started making his way through the crowd. A chorus of &ldquo;Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me&rdquo; clearing their way. He felt the grip on his hand tighten and looked back to see Y/N desperately trying to push her way through, but the crowd wasn&rsquo;t letting her pass. Chris&rsquo; heart sped up when he saw the look of panic on her face. There was no way he was losing her in this crowd. He made his way back and pushed her in front of him, using his body as a shield to move her through the space until they reached the dim hallway.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey. Hey. Look at me.&rdquo; Chris tried to draw her attention towards him, but her eyes kept darting around the hallway. He took her face in both hands and forced her to look at him. &ldquo;Focus on me alright? Just breath.&rdquo; He guided her through some slow deep breaths. &ldquo;Close your eyes and breath with me okay? Just listen to my voice. In.&rdquo; He inhaled. &ldquo;Out.&rdquo; Exhale.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough. Chris could still see her trembling and her breathing was still rushed and shallow. He racked his brain for all the things he had learned to deal with his own anxiety and settled on one that he&rsquo;d always found helpful.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen to the rain,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Drown out everything but the rain. Hear it hitting the roof, the bleachers. Smell it in the air.&rdquo; He watched the tension slowly easy from her shoulders. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Now breath.&rdquo;</p><p>He lead her through a few more calming breaths before her eyes fluttered open. Chris took a step back and studied her face for any sign that she was not okay.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Y/N sighed. &ldquo;I thought I was gonna suffocate back there.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris&rsquo; heart rate slowly returned to normal. Now that she was back with him, he looked her over for any sign of injury.</p><p>&ldquo;No problem. Are you alright?&rdquo; he asked, his hands fluttering just above her body. &ldquo;It got kind of crazy back there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Chris.&rdquo; He gave her an unbelieving look. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she started turning in a circle, &ldquo;nothing to worry abo&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s foot slipped in a small puddle on the concrete, and Chris&rsquo; heart leapt into his throat. Visions of her skull cracking against the hard floor raced through his mind as he shoot forward to catch her. He grabbed a hold of her and pulled her tight against his chest, but the momentum kept pulling them forward. He tried to keep his footing, but they were still falling. Chris placed a hand at the back of her head to cushion the blow as they crashed into the opposite wall, trapping her body between it and him.</p><p>It took Chris a moment to realize they&rsquo;d stopped before he was able to pull himself away from her. When he looked down to see if she was alright, his breath stopped. She was so close. He could smell the light floral scent of her shampoo, and it was making his head spin. He knew he should be stepping away from her, but something about her wide luminous eyes was drawing him in. He watched those eyes dart down to his lips before moving back up to meet his.</p><p>Chris&rsquo; heart started beating double time. It was beating so hard that he was sure she could feel it trying to beat it&rsquo;s way through his chest. His eyes moved across her face before settling on her lips.</p><p>He kept his movements slow, giving Y/N a chance to pull away. He licked his lips and started to lean in. The last trace of doubt left his mind when her eyes fluttered closed, and she closed the last of the space between them.</p><p>Everything around him stopped. Her lips were soft and warm despite the chilly Autumn air. They molded to his perfectly, filling him with a warmth and life he hadn&rsquo;t realized he was missing. He could feel her hand fisting around the front of his sweatshirt, and he brought his a hand up to cradle her cheek. The kiss was perfect. It was sweet and tender. It was everything he could have ever hoped for and so much more.</p><p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo; The sound of the announcer&rsquo;s voice broke the spell. Chris pulled away from her quickly, his breath coming in short puffs of air. &ldquo;Due to severe weather conditions, the game has been canceled and will be rescheduled for a later date. Please make your ways to the exits where you will be given instructions on claiming your ticket for the game once it is rescheduled.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris didn&rsquo;t move. He couldn&rsquo;t. He stared down into her y/e/c eyes, gasping for breath while his mind reeled from their kiss. His eyes danced across her face, seeing the look of shock on her face made him nervous. <i>Does she regret it? </i>That doubt vanished from his mind when he saw her smile. He beamed down at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Should we go?&rdquo; he asked, brushing a piece of hair out of her face..</p><p>She nodded. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris took a step back. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand in his own, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you home.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Her insides were still bubbling with excitement. Kissing Chris had been even more wonderful than she imagined. It was gentle, and warm, and filled the pit of her stomach with so many butterflies that she wasn&rsquo;t sure they would ever stop.</p><p>Y/N glanced over at Chris as he drove. Every time he glanced over at her, he glanced in her direction like he could feel her watching him. A look of affection would pull the corner of his mouth into a half smile that she was more than willing to return.</p><p>She was disappointed when Chris pulled up outside her door. She didn&rsquo;t want the night to end. She wanted to spend more time with him, to feel his hand in hers, to kiss him again. The click of the door opening beside her startled her. Chris had never gone around to open her door at the end of the night. Sure he did it other places, but not here. He&rsquo;d always just dropped her off and waited in the car until she made it through the door. The fact that he was doing it now thrilled her.</p><p>Y/N took the hand Chris held out to her and felt her heart flutter all over again as he help her out of the car. She kept her hand in his as the walked to the door. She kept rolling things over and over again in her mind, trying to find a way to extend their time together, but nothing had come to her by the time they reached the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; she said softly and turned to go inside. A slight tug on her hand made her pause and turn back towards Chris. He was smiling at her again in that way that turned her insides to mush. He took a step forward and brought a hand up to run his thumb along her jaw.</p><p>&ldquo;Have dinner with me tomorrow?&rdquo; he asked simply, running his thumb back and forth across her skin.</p><p>A radiant smile spread across her face. She didn&rsquo;t even hesitate before answering. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pick you up at seven?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded. Chris smiled back at her before leaning in to give her a sweet kiss. Y/N rested her hands against his chest and leaned in a bit more, savoring the feel of his lips against her own before reluctantly pulling away.</p><p>They exchanged whispered good nights before Y/N fumbled behind her for the door handle and went inside. She peeked through the curtain to watch Chris make his way back to the car. He paused at the bottom of the steps and did a little fist pump that had her giggling. He turned back towards the building, and Y/N quickly ducked out of sight before he could catch her spying. She heard the car pull away and decided to head up to her room for the night.</p><p>Y/N was practically floated up the steps. She couldn&rsquo;t remember a time when she felt this happy. <i>I kissed him. I actually kissed him.</i> She suppressed a girlish squeal of joy until she was able to make it to her room and scream her excitement into one of the pillows on her bed.</p><p>She rolled over onto her back and looked up at the ceiling. She replayed the night over again in her mind like a movie. The laughs. The game. The kiss. It was all so perfect. Another squeal left her lips at the thought of seeing him again tomorrow. True she&rsquo;d seen him every day while she&rsquo;d been here, but this felt different. That kiss changed everything.</p><p><br /></p><p><b><a href=\"http://blacktithe7.tumblr.com/post/183802059295/a-week-in-boston-part-9-chris-evans-x-reader\" target=\"_blank\">Part

One week all by yourself in the big city of Boston. No rules. No expectations. Just a list of places to go and things you wanted to see. That all changed when you run into a certain blue-eyed Boston boy who turned your world upside down. Is it really possible to fall in love with someone in just one week? Or is that kind of love just a fairytale?</p>\n<p>Warning: language</p>\n<p>Word Count:\t3300</p>\n<p>Author&rsquo;s Note: I&rsquo;m sorry for the delay. The loss of my parents home has meant I&rsquo;m spending every weekend on the road going to help them clean up and rebuild. This has really cut into my writing time I&rsquo;m working hard to keep bringing you the content you love. I just ask that you be patient with me while my family works through this.&nbsp; As always, feedback is much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the amazing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdqJ3syPOMR3iOJOiNK9NCQ\" target=\"_blank\">@until-theend-oftheline</a> for betaing this fic.

You look exhausted&rdquo; Lily was right, you couldn&rsquo;t sleep after Rogers left the training room.<br/>&ldquo;I coulnd&rsquo;t sleep&rdquo; you say.<br/>&ldquo;You have chosen a bad day to be tired, it seems that Captain Hanks wants to kill us with these training exercises&rdquo; Lily says between push-ups.<br/>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s nothing new&rdquo; you say wiping the sweat off your forehead.<br/>&ldquo;it seems that cadet Y/L/N is bored, So why don&rsquo;t you do 20 more laps?&rdquo; Captain Hanks says with a big smile on his face. You really hate that man. You know it&rsquo;s no use protesting so you have no choice but to start running. You were exhausted, your muscles complain of fatigue, but you can&rsquo;t stop. When you finish you are out of breath, the others had already gone to the showers only Captain Hank remained. &ldquo;why have you stopped?&rdquo; he asks. <br/>&ldquo;I finished the laps&rdquo; you say breathless.<br/>&ldquo;you think you&rsquo;re very special for having captured the non-human, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He says looking at you with contempt.<br/>&ldquo;No&hellip; i just..&rdquo; you start saying.<br/>&ldquo;100 push-ups, now&rdquo; he yells.<br/>&ldquo;what why?&rdquo; he really wants to kill you.<br/>&ldquo;Because I say it&rdquo; He&rsquo;s your superior and you have to obey his orders, so despite the fatigue, you start doing push-ups. When you think it can\u2019t get worse, it starts to rain, great. You had done fifty push-ups when you let yourself fall to the ground, you couldn\u2019t do it anymore, your arms hurt and you were trembling from the cold in the rain.<br/>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re nobody, you&rsquo;re worth nothing&rdquo; he says, but you say nothing, you know it wouldn\u2019t help &ldquo;you are weak&rdquo; he says with hatred in his eyes &ldquo;it would be best if you resigned&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Would that be the best thing for me or for you?&rdquo; you say breathless.<br/>&ldquo;you are playing with fire Y/L/N, don&rsquo;t say I didn\u2019t warned you&rdquo; he pushes you to the ground \u00a0&quot;you won&rsquo;t leave until you finish the push-ups&quot; <br/>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; you recognize that voice, Steve Rogers.<br/>&ldquo;Nothing of your concern&rdquo; Hank says annoyed at the interruption &ldquo; you have Fifty push-ups left, start&rdquo; he says in your direction.<br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late and it&rsquo;s raining&rdquo; Rogers says.<br/>&ldquo;she is under my command, she has to fulfill his punishment&rdquo; he looks at you &ldquo;Start if you don&rsquo;t want me to add more!&rdquo; he yells this time. You look at Steve before continuing with the push-ups, your whole body trembles but you keep up the pace. <br/>&ldquo;What has she done?&rdquo; \u00a0you hear him say, he seems angry.<br/>&ldquo;nothing that is of your concern&rdquo; Hanks\u00a0answers.<br/>&ldquo;Are you doing this because she captured the non-human making you look bad or for the simple fact of being a woman?&rdquo; Steve says in a low voice, Hank takes a step forward, it seems that he wanted to hit him when you interrupted him.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m finished, one hundred push-ups, can I go Captain?&rdquo; you say still on the ground.<br/>&ldquo;we are finished&rdquo; he says taking a step back \u00a0&quot;for today&quot; he adds before leaving.</p><!-- more --><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0adf83ca3d7602724c6998c38fa8076/tumblr_inline_pmmkg43CzN1s3c2y7_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;are you okay?&rdquo; Steve says helping you get up<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo; you say shaking.<br/>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re soaked&rdquo; he says giving you his jacket.<br/>&ldquo;thanks, i need to go&hellip;&rdquo; You were soaked, exhausted and in front of the man who almost kissed you yesterday, you need to go.<br/>&ldquo;Why did Hank punish you?&rdquo; he asks you when you are about to leave.<br/>&ldquo;does it matter?
