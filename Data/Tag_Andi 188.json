Sure, it looked nice, but there was no way people wouldn\u2019t judge him for it. Or worse - figure out he was gay. </i></p><p>Panic started to settle in, and he fled from his room to the bathroom, flinging open the cabinets and rummaging around for nail polish remover. He found a bottle of it that was very nearly empty, and grabbed some cotton pads so he could frantically scrub it all off.</p><p><i>He had to leave for school in 5 minutes, and here he was trying to remove nail polish. Classic Cyrus.</i></p><p>He hastily replaced the bottle when he had finished, and dashed out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cCyrus! You ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d he called back, taking two stairs at a time as he rushed down. There were a few close calls, but he reached the bottom of the staircase unscathed.</p><p><i>Maybe one day he would have the confidence to wear nail polish, but today just wasn\u2019t that day.</i></p><p>~</p><p>\u201cHey Underdog!\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy turned around with a bright smile. \u201cHey! What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaths.\u201d TJ responded with a shudder. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a guess.\u201d</p><p>The athlete gave him a fond smile, before looking down at the books he was holding. \u201cHmm&hellip;could it be Biology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect!\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes lingered on the boy\u2019s hands, and his smile turned curious. \u201cHey - is that nail polish?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened, and he frantically looked down at his nails. Sure enough, there were remnants of nail polish on not one - but two of his nails.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said defensively, shifting his books from his left arm to his right. \u201cWhy would I be wearing nail polish?\u201d</p><p>The athlete laughed slightly and raised his free arm in surrender. \u201cI don\u2019t know, because it looks cute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;Okay then. Well - this is where I turn. See you at lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;see you then.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus spent the next few periods trying desperately to cover the nail polish remnants - so much so that he could barely pay attention in class. As he found out - writing with his left hand was not a strong suit of his.</p><p>He was well aware that straight guys wore nail polish sometimes, but that was definitely not how people would interpret it if he wore nail polish. He knew that for sure.</p><p>With this in mind, he hid his right arm under the desk and tried desperately to focus on writing with his left hand.</p><p>At lunch in the cafeteria, Cyrus felt arms wrap around his waist from behind. He laughed at first and turned around to greet TJ, but then he noticed a few of the curious looks they were receiving. He cleared his throat and stepped out of the athlete\u2019s grasp.</p><p>TJ frowned at that, but he seemed to brush it off. \u201cSo&hellip;\u201d he began hesitantly. \u201cWanna sit alone somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out a small sigh of relief. \u201cYeah. I do.\u201d</p><p>They found a tucked away corner by an unused part of the basketball court, and settled down there to have lunch. </p><!-- more --><p>For a few minutes, there was a tense silence between them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wearing nail polish&hellip;you know that right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked down at the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s not nail polish,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s paint. From art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe because I\u2019m your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just shrugged, and TJ let out a small sigh. He shuffled closer and wrapped a hesitant arm around the boy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like seeing you sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sad.\u201d</p><p>The athlete gave him a playful nudge. \u201cRight. So is today international \u2018deny everything\u2019 day or what?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but laugh slightly. He finally looked over at the other boy, who gave him a heart-melting smile, and placed a hand on his arm. \u201cOkay,\u201d he conceded. \u201cIt <i>was </i>nail polish. I wanted to wear some today, but this morning I panicked and tried to take it off. Obviously, I didn\u2019t get all of it. Because I\u2019m <i>me</i>.\u201d</p><p>TJ softened at that, and leant over to place a kiss on the boy\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhy did you remove it? I didn\u2019t even get to see you looking adorable with nail polish on.\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy could feel himself blushing, so he looked bashfully down at the ground again. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to figure out I was gay. Or say anything about it. I don\u2019t know - I was just scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ murmured, gently tilting the boy\u2019s head toward him. \u201cIf <i>anyone </i>says anything like that whatsoever, I <i>will </i>beat them up. It\u2019s none of their business whether you\u2019re gay or not.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave him a pointed look, and he chuckled before adding \u201cOkay - I\u2019ll beat them up with <i>words</i>.\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy shook his head in amusement \u201cYou\u2019re sweet&hellip;but gosh, I feel so stupid right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so&hellip;I don\u2019t know, unapologetic? And here I am having a tantrum over <i>nail polish</i>.\u201d</p><p>TJ frowned and shook his head. \u201cEveryone\u2019s different. Not giving a fuck about what other people think takes time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think - being gay isn\u2019t a choice, so why should it matter what other people think of me?\u201d he paused for a moment, before smiling sheepishly. \u201cAnd I guess I <i>can </i>be intimidating sometimes. That probably helps.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed and pulled the athlete in, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re very cute for someone so intimidating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d TJ teased, smiling fondly at his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>They remained like that for a few moments, before the taller boy playfully nudged Cyrus\u2019 forehead with his own. \u201cHow would you feel about wearing nail polish if I wore it too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm&hellip;I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m scared you\u2019d rock it better than I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Impossible.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t help a shy smile. \u201cHonestly though, I\u2019m still not sure if I could. You definitely should though&hellip;if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay&hellip;but promise me one day we\u2019ll rock nail polish together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day.\u201d Cyrus promised, leaning his head on the boy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>~</p><p>Later on, Cyrus and Andi couldn\u2019t make it to The Spoon, which left TJ sitting alone with Buffy and Marty.</p><p>\u201cSo where you and Cyrus at lunch?\u201d Buffy asked him.</p><p>TJ hesitated for a moment, glancing nervously around the diner. \u201cUm&hellip;he was kinda upset, so I asked him if he wanted to sit alone with me.\u201d</p><p>Marty frowned. \u201cWhat was he upset about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm&hellip;\u201d</p><p><i>Should he tell them? They were both pretty close to Cyrus, so it couldn\u2019t hurt. Could it?</i></p><p>Buffy in particular looked very protective at that moment, and TJ knew instantly that she\u2019d end up confronting Cyrus about it if he didn\u2019t tell her.</p><p>\u201cBasically&hellip;he wanted to wear nail polish today, but he ended up removing it because he was scared of what people at school might think. We talked about it though.\u201d</p><p>Buffy slowly shook her head. \u201cIf anyone were to say <i>anything </i>about him wearing nail polish, I\u2019d kill them.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed slightly. \u201cI know - same here. That\u2019s what I told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019d be more comfortable if he saw me wearing nail polish?\u201d Marty asked.</p><p>TJ gave him a surprised look, but he smiled eagerly and nodded all the same. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt, that\u2019s for sure. I was planning on doing the same thing tomorrow actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet! I\u2019ll steal some of my sister\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Buffy gave him a fond look, before turning to TJ with a smile. \u201cI could wear some too&hellip;although I\u2019m not sure if it would have the same effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh, everything counts. We could totally be a nail polish trio.\u201d</p><p>Marty laughed. \u201cThat sounds dope! Obviously though - we\u2019d have to coordinate our colours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Pink, purple and blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s basic.\u201d Buffy argued. \u201cYellow, pink and blue is a much more interesting combo.\u201d</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes and turned to Marty, clearly trying to get his opinion.</p><p>The boy just laughed again. \u201cWho am I to argue with my girlfriend? Yellow, pink and blue sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou argue with her <i>all </i>the time.\u201d TJ pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s banter,\u201d he corrected. \u201cAnd it\u2019s <i>cute</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I have dibs on pink.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have dibs on blue!\u201d Buffy added.</p><p>\u201cAlright, well jokes on you guys, because yellow is superior anyway!\u201d</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes again. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>The following day, Cyrus walked up to his locker with fully clear nails - he could officially go back to writing with his right hand, and he had never been so thankful.</p><p>After dumping his bag in his locker and collecting his things, he turned to find TJ in front of him. He glanced down for a moment, double-taking when he noticed the boy\u2019s nail polish.</p><p><i>Was TJ actually wearing pink nail polish, or was Cyrus just seeing things?</i></p><p>He glanced up at the boy\u2019s face, before looking back down at his nails.</p><p><i>Okay yeah - he was definitely wearing pink nail polish. And it looked far too good to be allowed.</i></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cuteness, apparently. That shade of pink is awesome!\u201d </p><p>TJ laughed as they began to head to class. \u201cThanks, Underdog.\u201d</p><p>Aside from the occasional curious glance, TJ\u2019s nail polish went relatively unnoticed as they walked through the corridors. Cyrus ended up reasoning that TJ was pretty popular - people probably just didn\u2019t want to get on his bad side.</p><p>At lunch, Buffy and Andi were waiting for him by his locker. As he opened it, he excitedly told the pair about a movie he had watched the night before.</p><p>\u201cSo in the end, the mean girl got redeemed! Serious guys, it was great, and - hang on - Buffy, are you wearing <i>nail polish</i>?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm - you absolutely are - and it looks amazing! I didn\u2019t realise you were a nail polish type of gal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the only one.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus whirled around to find Marty standing there, casually pushing back his hair. Sure enough - his nails were painted a vibrant yellow.</p><p><i>So straightest guy he knew was wearing nail polish&hellip;and no one was giving him weird looks?\u00a0</i></p><p>He gaped at the boy for a moment or two, before blushing slightly and smiling wide. \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t realise nail polish was your thing either. But&hellip;it looks good on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;Has anyone said anything about it?\u201d</p><p>Marty shook his head. \u201cNo, not really. A few people told me they liked the colour, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave him an amazed look as TJ approached them, a knowing smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cHey Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you three coordinate this?!\u201d</p><p>The athlete laughed and wrapped a casual arm around the boy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMaybe. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked down at the ground, a light blush tinging his cheeks. \u201cYou all look good.\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>TJ beamed and resisted the sudden urge to kiss his boyfriend on the cheek. Instead - he began guiding him towards the cafeteria. </p><p>\u201cPink looks cute on you.\u201d Cyrus commented.</p><p>The athlete gave him a playful smile. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus could feel their hands brushing as he walked, and it took all of his restraint not to just reach out and take the boy\u2019s hand.</p><p>One look at TJ confirmed that he was likely thinking the same thing, if his glances towards their hands were anything to go by.</p><p>A few moments passed, and Cyrus was very seriously considering just taking his hand and being done with it. He hesitated, but slowly, he slipped in hand into TJ\u2019s.</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes widened, and he looked over at Cyrus in alarm. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d whispered. \u201cI <i>really </i>don\u2019t think we can pass this off as a \u2018friend\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. As long as I have you guys, I\u2019m good.\u201d he hesitated again for a moment, before wincing slightly. \u201cBut&hellip;do you think we\u2019ll get bullied?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI <i>am </i>the bully.\u201d TJ reminded him. </p><p>\u201cThe <i>ex</i>-bully.\u201d Cyrus corrected.</p><p>\u201cStill - people are scared of me. They wouldn\u2019t dare go near my adorable boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled at that as they sat down. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe people are scared of a giant teddy bear like you.\u201d</p><p>Marty scoffed as he and Buffy sat down next to them. \u201cHe\u2019s only a teddy bear around you, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Buffy agreed. \u201cAround other people, he\u2018s the polar opposite of a teddy bear. I\u2019m not sure what that is, but he\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed as her and Amber took a seat across from them. \u201cWhy exactly are we talking about teddy bears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good question.\u201d TJ remarked.</p><p>As various conversations started up, Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but sneak glances at Andi and Amber. Amber had a casual arm around the girl\u2019s waist, and occasionally she would kiss Andi\u2019s cheek, or call her cute, or do <i>something </i>that clearly hinted at their relationship.</p><p><i>They didn\u2019t seem to get trouble from people&hellip;so maybe he and TJ wouldn\u2019t either? Then again, maybe people thought they were just ridiculously close friends. Ridiculously close friends who kissed sometimes. </i></p><p>\u201cEarth to Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at his boyfriend, and couldn\u2019t help but blush slightly at the way TJ was gazing at him.</p><p>\u201c<i>Gosh</i>, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d the athlete mumbled. \u201cWho gave you the right to be so cute?\u201d</p><p>Okay. Cyrus could definitely feel his face burning now.</p><p>\u201cWell&hellip;who gave <i>you </i>the right to be so sweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that in the job description for being your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise there <i>was </i>a job description.\u201d</p><p>The boy grinned. \u201cOh - there definitely is. I\u2019ve read it, and it clearly says that Cyrus Goodman\u2019s boyfriend must be sweet to him, because he deserves all the sweetness in the world.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus beamed as he moved forward to engulf TJ in a hug, burying his face in the boy\u2019s jumper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve broken him, TJ.\u201d Marty commented.</p><p>TJ just laughed and rested his chin atop of Cyrus\u2019 head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay - give him a few minutes and he\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>That afternoon, after spending a few hours agonising over the idea, Cyrus finally decided he would wear nail polish to school the next day.</p><p><b>Cyrus:</b> Come over and help me paint my nails for tomorrow? :)</p><p><b>TJ:</b> I\u2019ll be there asap! xx</p>",

Classic Cyrus.</i></p><p>He hastily replaced the bottle when he had finished, and dashed out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cCyrus! You ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d he called back, taking two stairs at a time as he rushed down. There were a few close calls, but he reached the bottom of the staircase unscathed.</p><p><i>Maybe one day he would have the confidence to wear nail polish, but today just wasn\u2019t that day.</i></p><p>~</p><p>\u201cHey Underdog!\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy turned around with a bright smile. \u201cHey! What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaths.\u201d TJ responded with a shudder. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a guess.\u201d</p><p>The athlete gave him a fond smile, before looking down at the books he was holding. \u201cHmm\u2026could it be Biology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect!\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes lingered on the boy\u2019s hands, and his smile turned curious. \u201cHey - is that nail polish?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened, and he frantically looked down at his nails. Sure enough, there were remnants of nail polish on not one - but two of his nails.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said defensively, shifting his books from his left arm to his right. \u201cWhy would I be wearing nail polish?\u201d</p><p>The athlete laughed slightly and raised his free arm in surrender. \u201cI don\u2019t know, because it looks cute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Okay then. Well - this is where I turn. See you at lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026see you then.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus spent the next few periods trying desperately to cover the nail polish remnants - so much so that he could barely pay attention in class. As he found out - writing with his left hand was not a strong suit of his.</p><p>He was well aware that straight guys wore nail polish sometimes, but that was definitely not how people would interpret it if he wore nail polish. He knew that for sure.</p><p>With this in mind, he hid his right arm under the desk and tried desperately to focus on writing with his left hand.</p><p>At lunch in the cafeteria, Cyrus felt arms wrap around his waist from behind. He laughed at first and turned around to greet TJ, but then he noticed a few of the curious looks they were receiving. He cleared his throat and stepped out of the athlete\u2019s grasp.</p><p>TJ frowned at that, but he seemed to brush it off. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d he began hesitantly. \u201cWanna sit alone somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out a small sigh of relief. \u201cYeah. I do.\u201d</p><p>They found a tucked away corner by an unused part of the basketball court, and settled down there to have lunch. </p>[[MORE]]<p>For a few minutes, there was a tense silence between them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wearing nail polish\u2026you know that right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked down at the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s not nail polish,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s paint. From art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe because I\u2019m your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just shrugged, and TJ let out a small sigh. He shuffled closer and wrapped a hesitant arm around the boy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like seeing you sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sad.\u201d</p><p>The athlete gave him a playful nudge. \u201cRight. So is today international \u2018deny everything\u2019 day or what?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but laugh slightly. He finally looked over at the other boy, who gave him a heart-melting smile, and placed a hand on his arm. \u201cOkay,\u201d he conceded. \u201cIt <i>was </i>nail polish. I wanted to wear some today, but this morning I panicked and tried to take it off. Obviously, I didn\u2019t get all of it. Because I\u2019m <i>me</i>.\u201d</p><p>TJ softened at that, and leant over to place a kiss on the boy\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhy did you remove it? I didn\u2019t even get to see you looking adorable with nail polish on.\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy could feel himself blushing, so he looked bashfully down at the ground again. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to figure out I was gay. Or say anything about it. I don\u2019t know - I was just scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ murmured, gently tilting the boy\u2019s head toward him. \u201cIf <i>anyone </i>says anything like that whatsoever, I <i>will </i>beat them up. It\u2019s none of their business whether you\u2019re gay or not.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave him a pointed look, and he chuckled before adding \u201cOkay - I\u2019ll beat them up with <i>words</i>.\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy shook his head in amusement \u201cYou\u2019re sweet\u2026but gosh, I feel so stupid right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so\u2026I don\u2019t know, unapologetic? And here I am having a tantrum over <i>nail polish</i>.\u201d</p><p>TJ frowned and shook his head. \u201cEveryone\u2019s different. Not giving a fuck about what other people think takes time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think - being gay isn\u2019t a choice, so why should it matter what other people think of me?\u201d he paused for a moment, before smiling sheepishly. \u201cAnd I guess I <i>can </i>be intimidating sometimes. That probably helps.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed and pulled the athlete in, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re very cute for someone so intimidating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d TJ teased, smiling fondly at his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>They remained like that for a few moments, before the taller boy playfully nudged Cyrus\u2019 forehead with his own. \u201cHow would you feel about wearing nail polish if I wore it too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm\u2026I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m scared you\u2019d rock it better than I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Impossible.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t help a shy smile. \u201cHonestly though, I\u2019m still not sure if I could. You definitely should though\u2026if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026but promise me one day we\u2019ll rock nail polish together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day.\u201d Cyrus promised, leaning his head on the boy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>~</p><p>Later on, Cyrus and Andi couldn\u2019t make it to The Spoon, which left TJ sitting alone with Buffy and Marty.</p><p>\u201cSo where you and Cyrus at lunch?\u201d Buffy asked him.</p><p>TJ hesitated for a moment, glancing nervously around the diner. \u201cUm\u2026he was kinda upset, so I asked him if he wanted to sit alone with me.\u201d</p><p>Marty frowned. \u201cWhat was he upset about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Should he tell them? They were both pretty close to Cyrus, so it couldn\u2019t hurt. Could it?</i></p><p>Buffy in particular looked very protective at that moment, and TJ knew instantly that she\u2019d end up confronting Cyrus about it if he didn\u2019t tell her.</p><p>\u201cBasically\u2026he wanted to wear nail polish today, but he ended up removing it because he was scared of what people at school might think. We talked about it though.\u201d</p><p>Buffy slowly shook her head. \u201cIf anyone were to say <i>anything </i>about him wearing nail polish, I\u2019d kill them.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed slightly. \u201cI know - same here. That\u2019s what I told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019d be more comfortable if he saw me wearing nail polish?\u201d Marty asked.</p><p>TJ gave him a surprised look, but he smiled eagerly and nodded all the same. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt, that\u2019s for sure. I was planning on doing the same thing tomorrow actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet! I\u2019ll steal some of my sister\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Buffy gave him a fond look, before turning to TJ with a smile. \u201cI could wear some too\u2026although I\u2019m not sure if it would have the same effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh, everything counts. We could totally be a nail polish trio.\u201d</p><p>Marty laughed. \u201cThat sounds dope! Obviously though - we\u2019d have to coordinate our colours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Pink, purple and blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s basic.\u201d Buffy argued. \u201cYellow, pink and blue is a much more interesting combo.\u201d</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes and turned to Marty, clearly trying to get his opinion.</p><p>The boy just laughed again. \u201cWho am I to argue with my girlfriend? Yellow, pink and blue sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou argue with her <i>all </i>the time.\u201d TJ pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s banter,\u201d he corrected. \u201cAnd it\u2019s <i>cute</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I have dibs on pink.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have dibs on blue!\u201d Buffy added.</p><p>\u201cAlright, well jokes on you guys, because yellow is superior anyway!\u201d</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes again. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>The following day, Cyrus walked up to his locker with fully clear nails - he could officially go back to writing with his right hand, and he had never been so thankful.</p><p>After dumping his bag in his locker and collecting his things, he turned to find TJ in front of him. He glanced down for a moment, double-taking when he noticed the boy\u2019s nail polish.</p><p><i>Was TJ actually wearing pink nail polish, or was Cyrus just seeing things?</i></p><p>He glanced up at the boy\u2019s face, before looking back down at his nails.</p><p><i>Okay yeah - he was definitely wearing pink nail polish. And it looked far too good to be allowed.</i></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cuteness, apparently. That shade of pink is awesome!\u201d </p><p>TJ laughed as they began to head to class. \u201cThanks, Underdog.\u201d</p><p>Aside from the occasional curious glance, TJ\u2019s nail polish went relatively unnoticed as they walked through the corridors. Cyrus ended up reasoning that TJ was pretty popular - people probably just didn\u2019t want to get on his bad side.</p><p>At lunch, Buffy and Andi were waiting for him by his locker. As he opened it, he excitedly told the pair about a movie he had watched the night before.</p><p>\u201cSo in the end, the mean girl got redeemed! Serious guys, it was great, and - hang on - Buffy, are you wearing <i>nail polish</i>?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm - you absolutely are - and it looks amazing! I didn\u2019t realise you were a nail polish type of gal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the only one.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus whirled around to find Marty standing there, casually pushing back his hair. Sure enough - his nails were painted a vibrant yellow.</p><p><i>So straightest guy he knew was wearing nail polish\u2026and no one was giving him weird looks?\u00a0</i></p><p>He gaped at the boy for a moment or two, before blushing slightly and smiling wide. \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t realise nail polish was your thing either. But\u2026it looks good on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Has anyone said anything about it?\u201d</p><p>Marty shook his head. \u201cNo, not really. A few people told me they liked the colour, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave him an amazed look as TJ approached them, a knowing smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cHey Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you three coordinate this?!\u201d</p><p>The athlete laughed and wrapped a casual arm around the boy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMaybe. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked down at the ground, a light blush tinging his cheeks. \u201cYou all look good.\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>TJ beamed and resisted the sudden urge to kiss his boyfriend on the cheek. Instead - he began guiding him towards the cafeteria. </p><p>\u201cPink looks cute on you.\u201d Cyrus commented.</p><p>The athlete gave him a playful smile. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus could feel their hands brushing as he walked, and it took all of his restraint not to just reach out and take the boy\u2019s hand.</p><p>One look at TJ confirmed that he was likely thinking the same thing, if his glances towards their hands were anything to go by.</p><p>A few moments passed, and Cyrus was very seriously considering just taking his hand and being done with it. He hesitated, but slowly, he slipped in hand into TJ\u2019s.</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes widened, and he looked over at Cyrus in alarm. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d whispered. \u201cI <i>really </i>don\u2019t think we can pass this off as a \u2018friend\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. As long as I have you guys, I\u2019m good.\u201d he hesitated again for a moment, before wincing slightly. \u201cBut\u2026do you think we\u2019ll get bullied?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI <i>am </i>the bully.\u201d TJ reminded him. </p><p>\u201cThe <i>ex</i>-bully.\u201d Cyrus corrected.</p><p>\u201cStill - people are scared of me. They wouldn\u2019t dare go near my adorable boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled at that as they sat down. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe people are scared of a giant teddy bear like you.\u201d</p><p>Marty scoffed as he and Buffy sat down next to them. \u201cHe\u2019s only a teddy bear around you, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Buffy agreed. \u201cAround other people, he\u2018s the polar opposite of a teddy bear. I\u2019m not sure what that is, but he\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed as her and Amber took a seat across from them. \u201cWhy exactly are we talking about teddy bears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good question.\u201d TJ remarked.</p><p>As various conversations started up, Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but sneak glances at Andi and Amber. Amber had a casual arm around the girl\u2019s waist, and occasionally she would kiss Andi\u2019s cheek, or call her cute, or do <i>something </i>that clearly hinted at their relationship.</p><p><i>They didn\u2019t seem to get trouble from people\u2026so maybe he and TJ wouldn\u2019t either? Then again, maybe people thought they were just ridiculously close friends. Ridiculously close friends who kissed sometimes. </i></p><p>\u201cEarth to Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at his boyfriend, and couldn\u2019t help but blush slightly at the way TJ was gazing at him.</p><p>\u201c<i>Gosh</i>, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d the athlete mumbled. \u201cWho gave you the right to be so cute?\u201d</p><p>Okay. Cyrus could definitely feel his face burning now.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026who gave <i>you </i>the right to be so sweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that in the job description for being your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise there <i>was </i>a job description.\u201d</p><p>The boy grinned. \u201cOh - there definitely is. I\u2019ve read it, and it clearly says that Cyrus Goodman\u2019s boyfriend must be sweet to him, because he deserves all the sweetness in the world.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus beamed as he moved forward to engulf TJ in a hug, burying his face in the boy\u2019s jumper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve broken him, TJ.\u201d Marty commented.</p><p>TJ just laughed and rested his chin atop of Cyrus\u2019 head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay - give him a few minutes and he\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>That afternoon, after spending a few hours agonising over the idea, Cyrus finally decided he would wear nail polish to school the next day.</p><p><b>Cyrus:</b> Come over and help me paint my nails for tomorrow? :)</p><p><b>TJ:</b> I\u2019ll be there asap! xx</p>",

Sure enough, there were remnants of nail polish on not one - but two of his nails.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said defensively, shifting his books from his left arm to his right. \u201cWhy would I be wearing nail polish?\u201d</p><p>The athlete laughed slightly and raised his free arm in surrender. \u201cI don\u2019t know, because it looks cute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Okay then.

He cleared his throat and stepped out of the athlete\u2019s grasp.</p><p>TJ frowned at that, but he seemed to brush it off. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d he began hesitantly. \u201cWanna sit alone somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out a small sigh of relief. \u201cYeah. I do.\u201d</p><p>They found a tucked away corner by an unused part of the basketball court, and settled down there to have lunch. </p>[[MORE]]<p>For a few minutes, there was a tense silence between them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wearing nail polish\u2026you know that right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked down at the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s not nail polish,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s paint. From art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe because I\u2019m your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just shrugged, and TJ let out a small sigh. He shuffled closer and wrapped a hesitant arm around the boy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like seeing you sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sad.\u201d</p><p>The athlete gave him a playful nudge. \u201cRight. So is today international \u2018deny everything\u2019 day or what?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but laugh slightly. He finally looked over at the other boy, who gave him a heart-melting smile, and placed a hand on his arm. \u201cOkay,\u201d he conceded. \u201cIt <i>was </i>nail polish. I wanted to wear some today, but this morning I panicked and tried to take it off. Obviously, I didn\u2019t get all of it. Because I\u2019m <i>me</i>.\u201d</p><p>TJ softened at that, and leant over to place a kiss on the boy\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhy did you remove it? I didn\u2019t even get to see you looking adorable with nail polish on.\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy could feel himself blushing, so he looked bashfully down at the ground again. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to figure out I was gay. Or say anything about it. I don\u2019t know - I was just scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ murmured, gently tilting the boy\u2019s head toward him. \u201cIf <i>anyone </i>says anything like that whatsoever, I <i>will </i>beat them up. It\u2019s none of their business whether you\u2019re gay or not.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave him a pointed look, and he chuckled before adding \u201cOkay - I\u2019ll beat them up with <i>words</i>.\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy shook his head in amusement \u201cYou\u2019re sweet\u2026but gosh, I feel so stupid right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so\u2026I don\u2019t know, unapologetic? And here I am having a tantrum over <i>nail polish</i>.\u201d</p><p>TJ frowned and shook his head. \u201cEveryone\u2019s different. Not giving a fuck about what other people think takes time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think - being gay isn\u2019t a choice, so why should it matter what other people think of me?\u201d he paused for a moment, before smiling sheepishly. \u201cAnd I guess I <i>can </i>be intimidating sometimes. That probably helps.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed and pulled the athlete in, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re very cute for someone so intimidating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d TJ teased, smiling fondly at his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>They remained like that for a few moments, before the taller boy playfully nudged Cyrus\u2019 forehead with his own. \u201cHow would you feel about wearing nail polish if I wore it too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm\u2026I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m scared you\u2019d rock it better than I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Impossible.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t help a shy smile. \u201cHonestly though, I\u2019m still not sure if I could. You definitely should though\u2026if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026but promise me one day we\u2019ll rock nail polish together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day.\u201d Cyrus promised, leaning his head on the boy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>~</p><p>Later on, Cyrus and Andi couldn\u2019t make it to The Spoon, which left TJ sitting alone with Buffy and Marty.</p><p>\u201cSo where you and Cyrus at lunch?\u201d Buffy asked him.</p><p>TJ hesitated for a moment, glancing nervously around the diner. \u201cUm\u2026he was kinda upset, so I asked him if he wanted to sit alone with me.\u201d</p><p>Marty frowned. \u201cWhat was he upset about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Should he tell them? They were both pretty close to Cyrus, so it couldn\u2019t hurt. Could it?</i></p><p>Buffy in particular looked very protective at that moment, and TJ knew instantly that she\u2019d end up confronting Cyrus about it if he didn\u2019t tell her.</p><p>\u201cBasically\u2026he wanted to wear nail polish today, but he ended up removing it because he was scared of what people at school might think. We talked about it though.\u201d</p><p>Buffy slowly shook her head. \u201cIf anyone were to say <i>anything </i>about him wearing nail polish, I\u2019d kill them.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed slightly. \u201cI know - same here. That\u2019s what I told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019d be more comfortable if he saw me wearing nail polish?\u201d Marty asked.</p><p>TJ gave him a surprised look, but he smiled eagerly and nodded all the same. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt, that\u2019s for sure. I was planning on doing the same thing tomorrow actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet! I\u2019ll steal some of my sister\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Buffy gave him a fond look, before turning to TJ with a smile. \u201cI could wear some too\u2026although I\u2019m not sure if it would have the same effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh, everything counts. We could totally be a nail polish trio.\u201d</p><p>Marty laughed. \u201cThat sounds dope! Obviously though - we\u2019d have to coordinate our colours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Pink, purple and blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s basic.\u201d Buffy argued. \u201cYellow, pink and blue is a much more interesting combo.\u201d</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes and turned to Marty, clearly trying to get his opinion.</p><p>The boy just laughed again. \u201cWho am I to argue with my girlfriend? Yellow, pink and blue sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou argue with her <i>all </i>the time.\u201d TJ pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s banter,\u201d he corrected. \u201cAnd it\u2019s <i>cute</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I have dibs on pink.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have dibs on blue!\u201d Buffy added.</p><p>\u201cAlright, well jokes on you guys, because yellow is superior anyway!\u201d</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes again. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>The following day, Cyrus walked up to his locker with fully clear nails - he could officially go back to writing with his right hand, and he had never been so thankful.</p><p>After dumping his bag in his locker and collecting his things, he turned to find TJ in front of him. He glanced down for a moment, double-taking when he noticed the boy\u2019s nail polish.</p><p><i>Was TJ actually wearing pink nail polish, or was Cyrus just seeing things?</i></p><p>He glanced up at the boy\u2019s face, before looking back down at his nails.</p><p><i>Okay yeah - he was definitely wearing pink nail polish. And it looked far too good to be allowed.</i></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cuteness, apparently. That shade of pink is awesome!\u201d </p><p>TJ laughed as they began to head to class. \u201cThanks, Underdog.\u201d</p><p>Aside from the occasional curious glance, TJ\u2019s nail polish went relatively unnoticed as they walked through the corridors. Cyrus ended up reasoning that TJ was pretty popular - people probably just didn\u2019t want to get on his bad side.</p><p>At lunch, Buffy and Andi were waiting for him by his locker. As he opened it, he excitedly told the pair about a movie he had watched the night before.</p><p>\u201cSo in the end, the mean girl got redeemed! Serious guys, it was great, and - hang on - Buffy, are you wearing <i>nail polish</i>?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm - you absolutely are - and it looks amazing! I didn\u2019t realise you were a nail polish type of gal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the only one.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus whirled around to find Marty standing there, casually pushing back his hair. Sure enough - his nails were painted a vibrant yellow.</p><p><i>So straightest guy he knew was wearing nail polish\u2026and no one was giving him weird looks?\u00a0</i></p><p>He gaped at the boy for a moment or two, before blushing slightly and smiling wide. \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t realise nail polish was your thing either. But\u2026it looks good on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Has anyone said anything about it?\u201d</p><p>Marty shook his head. \u201cNo, not really. A few people told me they liked the colour, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave him an amazed look as TJ approached them, a knowing smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cHey Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you three coordinate this?!\u201d</p><p>The athlete laughed and wrapped a casual arm around the boy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMaybe. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked down at the ground, a light blush tinging his cheeks. \u201cYou all look good.\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>TJ beamed and resisted the sudden urge to kiss his boyfriend on the cheek. Instead - he began guiding him towards the cafeteria. </p><p>\u201cPink looks cute on you.\u201d Cyrus commented.</p><p>The athlete gave him a playful smile. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus could feel their hands brushing as he walked, and it took all of his restraint not to just reach out and take the boy\u2019s hand.</p><p>One look at TJ confirmed that he was likely thinking the same thing, if his glances towards their hands were anything to go by.</p><p>A few moments passed, and Cyrus was very seriously considering just taking his hand and being done with it. He hesitated, but slowly, he slipped in hand into TJ\u2019s.</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes widened, and he looked over at Cyrus in alarm. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d whispered. \u201cI <i>really </i>don\u2019t think we can pass this off as a \u2018friend\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. As long as I have you guys, I\u2019m good.\u201d he hesitated again for a moment, before wincing slightly. \u201cBut\u2026do you think we\u2019ll get bullied?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI <i>am </i>the bully.\u201d TJ reminded him. </p><p>\u201cThe <i>ex</i>-bully.\u201d Cyrus corrected.</p><p>\u201cStill - people are scared of me. They wouldn\u2019t dare go near my adorable boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled at that as they sat down. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe people are scared of a giant teddy bear like you.\u201d</p><p>Marty scoffed as he and Buffy sat down next to them. \u201cHe\u2019s only a teddy bear around you, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Buffy agreed. \u201cAround other people, he\u2018s the polar opposite of a teddy bear. I\u2019m not sure what that is, but he\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed as her and Amber took a seat across from them. \u201cWhy exactly are we talking about teddy bears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good question.\u201d TJ remarked.</p><p>As various conversations started up, Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but sneak glances at Andi and Amber. Amber had a casual arm around the girl\u2019s waist, and occasionally she would kiss Andi\u2019s cheek, or call her cute, or do <i>something </i>that clearly hinted at their relationship.</p><p><i>They didn\u2019t seem to get trouble from people\u2026so maybe he and TJ wouldn\u2019t either? Then again, maybe people thought they were just ridiculously close friends. Ridiculously close friends who kissed sometimes. </i></p><p>\u201cEarth to Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at his boyfriend, and couldn\u2019t help but blush slightly at the way TJ was gazing at him.</p><p>\u201c<i>Gosh</i>, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d the athlete mumbled. \u201cWho gave you the right to be so cute?\u201d</p><p>Okay. Cyrus could definitely feel his face burning now.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026who gave <i>you </i>the right to be so sweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that in the job description for being your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise there <i>was </i>a job description.\u201d</p><p>The boy grinned. \u201cOh - there definitely is. I\u2019ve read it, and it clearly says that Cyrus Goodman\u2019s boyfriend must be sweet to him, because he deserves all the sweetness in the world.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus beamed as he moved forward to engulf TJ in a hug, burying his face in the boy\u2019s jumper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve broken him, TJ.\u201d Marty commented.</p><p>TJ just laughed and rested his chin atop of Cyrus\u2019 head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay - give him a few minutes and he\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>That afternoon, after spending a few hours agonising over the idea, Cyrus finally decided he would wear nail polish to school the next day.</p><p><b>Cyrus:</b> Come over and help me paint my nails for tomorrow? :)</p><p><b>TJ:</b> I\u2019ll be there asap! xx</p>",
                "content": "<p>This was longer than I intended it to be, but oh well!! </p><p>~</p><p>There was a small frown on Cyrus&rsquo; face as he studied his painted nails.</p><p><i>This was a bad idea</i>, he thought.</p><p><i>He couldn&rsquo;t wear this to school. Sure, it looked nice, but there was no way people wouldn&rsquo;t judge him for it. Or worse - figure out he was gay. </i></p><p>Panic started to settle in, and he fled from his room to the bathroom, flinging open the cabinets and rummaging around for nail polish remover. He found a bottle of it that was very nearly empty, and grabbed some cotton pads so he could frantically scrub it all off.</p><p><i>He had to leave for school in 5 minutes, and here he was trying to remove nail polish. Classic Cyrus.</i></p><p>He hastily replaced the bottle when he had finished, and dashed out of the bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus! You ready to go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup!&rdquo; he called back, taking two stairs at a time as he rushed down. There were a few close calls, but he reached the bottom of the staircase unscathed.</p><p><i>Maybe one day he would have the confidence to wear nail polish, but today just wasn&rsquo;t that day.</i></p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Underdog!&rdquo;</p><p>The shorter boy turned around with a bright smile. &ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maths.&rdquo; TJ responded with a shudder. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take a guess.&rdquo;</p><p>The athlete gave him a fond smile, before looking down at the books he was holding. &ldquo;Hmm&hellip;could it be Biology?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Correct!&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s eyes lingered on the boy&rsquo;s hands, and his smile turned curious. &ldquo;Hey - is that nail polish?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; eyes widened, and he frantically looked down at his nails. Sure enough, there were remnants of nail polish on not one - but two of his nails.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said defensively, shifting his books from his left arm to his right. &ldquo;Why would I be wearing nail polish?&rdquo;</p><p>The athlete laughed slightly and raised his free arm in surrender. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, because it looks cute?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Okay then. Well - this is where I turn. See you at lunch?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;see you then.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus spent the next few periods trying desperately to cover the nail polish remnants - so much so that he could barely pay attention in class. As he found out - writing with his left hand was not a strong suit of his.</p><p>He was well aware that straight guys wore nail polish sometimes, but that was definitely not how people would interpret it if he wore nail polish. He knew that for sure.</p><p>With this in mind, he hid his right arm under the desk and tried desperately to focus on writing with his left hand.</p><p>At lunch in the cafeteria, Cyrus felt arms wrap around his waist from behind. He laughed at first and turned around to greet TJ, but then he noticed a few of the curious looks they were receiving. He cleared his throat and stepped out of the athlete&rsquo;s grasp.</p><p>TJ frowned at that, but he seemed to brush it off. &ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; he began hesitantly. &ldquo;Wanna sit alone somewhere?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus let out a small sigh of relief. &ldquo;Yeah.

Cyrus ended up reasoning that TJ was pretty popular - people probably just didn&rsquo;t want to get on his bad side.</p><p>At lunch, Buffy and Andi were waiting for him by his locker. As he opened it, he excitedly told the pair about a movie he had watched the night before.</p><p>&ldquo;So in the end, the mean girl got redeemed! Serious guys, it was great, and - hang on - Buffy, are you wearing <i>nail polish</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>She shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Am I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um - you absolutely are - and it looks amazing! I didn&rsquo;t realise you were a nail polish type of gal!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the only one.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus whirled around to find Marty standing there, casually pushing back his hair. Sure enough - his nails were painted a vibrant yellow.</p><p><i>So straightest guy he knew was wearing nail polish&hellip;and no one was giving him weird looks?&nbsp;</i></p><p>He gaped at the boy for a moment or two, before blushing slightly and smiling wide. &ldquo;Wow, I didn&rsquo;t realise nail polish was your thing either. But&hellip;it looks good on you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Has anyone said anything about it?&rdquo;</p><p>Marty shook his head. &ldquo;No, not really. A few people told me they liked the colour, but that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gave him an amazed look as TJ approached them, a knowing smile on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you three coordinate this?!&rdquo;</p><p>The athlete laughed and wrapped a casual arm around the boy&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Maybe. What do you think?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus looked down at the ground, a light blush tinging his cheeks. &ldquo;You all look good.&rdquo; he mumbled.</p><p>TJ beamed and resisted the sudden urge to kiss his boyfriend on the cheek. Instead - he began guiding him towards the cafeteria. </p><p>&ldquo;Pink looks cute on you.&rdquo; Cyrus commented.</p><p>The athlete gave him a playful smile. &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus could feel their hands brushing as he walked, and it took all of his restraint not to just reach out and take the boy&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>One look at TJ confirmed that he was likely thinking the same thing, if his glances towards their hands were anything to go by.</p><p>A few moments passed, and Cyrus was very seriously considering just taking his hand and being done with it. He hesitated, but slowly, he slipped in hand into TJ&rsquo;s.</p><p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes widened, and he looked over at Cyrus in alarm. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; whispered. &ldquo;I <i>really </i>don&rsquo;t think we can pass this off as a &lsquo;friend&rsquo; thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. As long as I have you guys, I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; he hesitated again for a moment, before wincing slightly. &ldquo;But&hellip;do you think we&rsquo;ll get bullied?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I <i>am </i>the bully.&rdquo; TJ reminded him. </p><p>&ldquo;The <i>ex</i>-bully.&rdquo; Cyrus corrected.</p><p>&ldquo;Still - people are scared of me. They wouldn&rsquo;t dare go near my adorable boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus giggled at that as they sat down. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe people are scared of a giant teddy bear like you.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty scoffed as he and Buffy sat down next to them. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only a teddy bear around you, dude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Buffy agreed. &ldquo;Around other people, he&lsquo;s the polar opposite of a teddy bear. I&rsquo;m not sure what that is, but he&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi laughed as her and Amber took a seat across from them. &ldquo;Why exactly are we talking about teddy bears?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good question.&rdquo; TJ remarked.</p><p>As various conversations started up, Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t help but sneak glances at Andi and Amber. Amber had a casual arm around the girl&rsquo;s waist, and occasionally she would kiss Andi&rsquo;s cheek, or call her cute, or do <i>something </i>that clearly hinted at their relationship.</p><p><i>They didn&rsquo;t seem to get trouble from people&hellip;so maybe he and TJ wouldn&rsquo;t either? Then again, maybe people thought they were just ridiculously close friends. Ridiculously close friends who kissed sometimes. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Earth to Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked over at his boyfriend, and couldn&rsquo;t help but blush slightly at the way TJ was gazing at him.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Gosh</i>, you&rsquo;re killing me.&rdquo; the athlete mumbled. &ldquo;Who gave you the right to be so cute?&rdquo;</p><p>Okay. Cyrus could definitely feel his face burning now.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;who gave <i>you </i>the right to be so sweet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that in the job description for being your boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise there <i>was </i>a job description.&rdquo;</p><p>The boy grinned. &ldquo;Oh - there definitely is. I&rsquo;ve read it, and it clearly says that Cyrus Goodman&rsquo;s boyfriend must be sweet to him, because he deserves all the sweetness in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus beamed as he moved forward to engulf TJ in a hug, burying his face in the boy&rsquo;s jumper.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve broken him, TJ.&rdquo; Marty commented.</p><p>TJ just laughed and rested his chin atop of Cyrus&rsquo; head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay - give him a few minutes and he&rsquo;ll be good.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>That afternoon, after spending a few hours agonising over the idea, Cyrus finally decided he would wear nail polish to school the next day.</p><p><b>Cyrus:</b> Come over and help me paint my nails for tomorrow? :)</p><p><b>TJ:</b> I&rsquo;ll be there asap! xx</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>This was longer than I intended it to be, but oh well!! </p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>There was a small frown on Cyrus&rsquo; face as he studied his painted nails.</p>\n<p><i>This was a bad idea</i>, he thought.</p>\n<p><i>He couldn&rsquo;t wear this to school. Sure, it looked nice, but there was no way people wouldn&rsquo;t judge him for it. Or worse - figure out he was gay. </i></p>\n<p>Panic started to settle in, and he fled from his room to the bathroom, flinging open the cabinets and rummaging around for nail polish remover. He found a bottle of it that was very nearly empty, and grabbed some cotton pads so he could frantically scrub it all off.</p>\n<p><i>He had to leave for school in 5 minutes, and here he was trying to remove nail polish. Classic Cyrus.</i></p>\n<p>He hastily replaced the bottle when he had finished, and dashed out of the bathroom.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cyrus! You ready to go?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yup!&rdquo; he called back, taking two stairs at a time as he rushed down. There were a few close calls, but he reached the bottom of the staircase unscathed.</p>\n<p><i>Maybe one day he would have the confidence to wear nail polish, but today just wasn&rsquo;t that day.</i></p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Underdog!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The shorter boy turned around with a bright smile. &ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Maths.&rdquo; TJ responded with a shudder. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Take a guess.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The athlete gave him a fond smile, before looking down at the books he was holding. &ldquo;Hmm&hellip;could it be Biology?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Correct!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>TJ&rsquo;s eyes lingered on the boy&rsquo;s hands, and his smile turned curious. &ldquo;Hey - is that nail polish?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus&rsquo; eyes widened, and he frantically looked down at his nails. Sure enough, there were remnants of nail polish on not one - but two of his nails.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said defensively, shifting his books from his left arm to his right. &ldquo;Why would I be wearing nail polish?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The athlete laughed slightly and raised his free arm in surrender. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, because it looks cute?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Okay then. Well - this is where I turn. See you at lunch?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;see you then.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus spent the next few periods trying desperately to cover the nail polish remnants - so much so that he could barely pay attention in class. As he found out - writing with his left hand was not a strong suit of his.</p>\n<p>He was well aware that straight guys wore nail polish sometimes, but that was definitely not how people would interpret it if he wore nail polish. He knew that for sure.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, he hid his right arm under the desk and tried desperately to focus on writing with his left hand.</p>\n<p>At lunch in the cafeteria, Cyrus felt arms wrap around his waist from behind. He laughed at first and turned around to greet TJ, but then he noticed a few of the curious looks they were receiving. He cleared his throat and stepped out of the athlete&rsquo;s grasp.</p>\n<p>TJ frowned at that, but he seemed to brush it off. &ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; he began hesitantly. &ldquo;Wanna sit alone somewhere?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus let out a small sigh of relief. &ldquo;Yeah. I do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They found a tucked away corner by an unused part of the basketball court, and settled down there to have lunch. </p>\n</p>",

He\u2019d always found it annoying, waking up at times when he didn\u2019t want to, and never managing to go back to sleep, So, it didn\u2019t take much for Tj to wake up at 3am one night when he heard silent sobs coming from the mattress on the floor.</p><p>Cyrus was spending the night at Tj\u2019s, which had become quite a tradition for the two. They\u2019d always stay up late and play games, watch movies and talk about everything between heaven and earth (with a few exceptions of course, Tj never mentioned his heart-aching, painful, unrequited crush on the other boy). His favorite part about the sleepovers had always been watching movies, because if he was lucky, Cyrus would get tired and slowly but surely get closer to Tj. In the end, he\u2019d be leaning against Tj completely with his head on his shoulder and their legs intertwined. It was almost like cuddling, and Tj secretly adored it.</p><p>As soon as Tj came to his senses, he realized that Cyrus was crying. Feeling panic spread to his body, he whispered a quiet \u201cHey, Cyrus.\u201d, and awaited an answer. Cyrus turned around to face Tj, and even in the dark, Tj could see Cyrus\u2019 teary eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d He whispered back, probably thinking that he had annoyed Tj by waking him up in the middle of the night. Tj, on the other hand, was just concerned for the other boy\u2019s feelings. He immediately shook his head, not wanting Cyrus to think that he was being a burden.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, no, it\u2019s fine. Is everything okay?\u201d He asked, voice soft and caring. \u201cI heard you crying, I don\u2019t want you to be upset.\u201d Cyrus managed to smile, and sniffled before answering, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay. I just had a nightmare, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it? You know I\u2019m a great listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, it was just a normal nightmare. Thanks though.\u201d</p><p>Before Tj could think, he lifted up his duvet and motioned for Cyrus lay next to him. As soon as his mind caught up with his body though, he had an internal panic attack because what was he doing? He faked a cough and tried to explain himself, \u201cI mean, you could lay here, if you want. Only if you want to, though. But I was thinking that you might feel safer up here? I don\u2019t want you to be scared.\u201d Tj held his breath while he waited for Cyrus to answer, he was afraid that he\u2019d said something wrong or too revealing of his crush.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cyrus asked. \u201cI mean, I want to, but I wouldn\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Tj smiled, realizing that maybe he didn\u2019t screw up after all, and assured Cyrus that no, he wouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable. After all, he was the one who asked in the first place. Cyrus face broke into a smile as he got up from the mattress on the floor and went to lay down next to Tj. He made sure not to lay too close to him though, considering the two were just friends, and he didn\u2019t want Tj to think he was into him or something. Even if that was the case, Tj didn\u2019t need to know that. No way he\u2019d ever feel the same.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d Tj asked as before getting ready to fall back asleep. Cyrus turned around to face Tj and smiled, said \u201cThank you.\u201d and \u201cI think so.\u201d before turning back around and closing his eyes.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before they fell back to sleep, both a little bit happier than the first time they\u2019d gone to bed that night.</p><p>___</p><p>Just a while later, Tj was once again woken up by the sound of Cyrus crying. His heart broke at the sound of Cyrus\u2019 crying, and he put a hand on his shoulder to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, what\u2019s going on? Are you having nightmares again?\u201d Tj asked, this time even more concerned. Cyrus turned around, upset at the thought of waking Tj up again, and managed to get out a quiet \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still not want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d rather not, they\u2019re just nightmares and I don\u2019t know why I keep having them.\u201d He paused for a while, before continuing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to be such a baby.\u201d</p><p>Tj was quick to assure him that he didn\u2019t think of him that way. \u201cCyrus, crying does not make you a baby, it makes you brave. I don\u2019t ever want you to feel like you have to hide stuff from me, nothing can make me think any differently of you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but break out into a huge grin at that, and for a little while, they just faced each other and examined every part of the other\u2019s face, a comfortable silence filling the room.</p><p>After a while, Tj broke the silence. \u201cI look up to you and admire you so much, you know that, right?\u201d He almost regretted saying it as soon as the words left his mouth, but he realized that there was no point in hiding it. After all, it was true.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Just thought you should know. I feel like people don\u2019t tell you that enough.\u201d</p><p>After another moment of silence, Cyrus felt his screw it instincts kick in and he decided to do something he\u2019d longed for for a long time. He leaned forward and closed the gap between him and Tj by pressing his lips against his. At first, Tj was caught off guard, but as soon as he realized what was happening, he happily melted into the kiss. As soon as they broke apart, both boys smiled at each other.</p><p>\u201cWoah.\u201d Was all that Tj managed to get out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do that for a while now.\u201d Cyrus shyly admitted. Tj couldn\u2019t quite comprehend what was happening, as he was too focused on not letting out a scream of excitement ,\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you did, because so have I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well kiss me again, then.\u201d Cyrus said through a huge grin. Tj, who was smiling just as big, leaned in and pressed his lips against Cyrus\u2019 now familiar ones.</p><p>As they parted, Cyrus let out a little laugh. Tj furrowed his eyebrows and looked at him questioningly. \u201cThat\u2019s not quite the outcome I expected from having nightmares.\u201d Cyrus said and chuckled. Tj did the same, because this was really not how he expected their sleepover to end. Cyrus yawned, and Tj noticed that he was quite tired, too. They\u2019d both woken up in the middle of the night, so it was no surprise that they were sleepy.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay to go back to sleep?\u201d Tj asked, to which Cyrus nodded. Cyrus hesitated before asking \u201cTj? Can you\u2026 um, hold me?\u201d He was happy that the lights were off, so Tj couldn\u2019t see the blush spreading across his cheeks. Little did he know that the same pink color was painted on Tj\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Underdog.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, and moved closer to Tj while not facing him. Tj put him arms around Cyrus waist so that they were spooning, and Tj prayed that Cyrus couldn\u2019t feel how fast his heart was beating in his chest. They stayed in that position for the rest of the night, and Cyrus managed to get through it without a single nightmare.</p>",

He\u2019d always found it annoying, waking up at times when he didn\u2019t want to, and never managing to go back to sleep, So, it didn\u2019t take much for Tj to wake up at 3am one night when he heard silent sobs coming from the mattress on the floor.</p><p>Cyrus was spending the night at Tj\u2019s, which had become quite a tradition for the two. They\u2019d always stay up late and play games, watch movies and talk about everything between heaven and earth (with a few exceptions of course, Tj never mentioned his heart-aching, painful, unrequited crush on the other boy). His favorite part about the sleepovers had always been watching movies, because if he was lucky, Cyrus would get tired and slowly but surely get closer to Tj. In the end, he\u2019d be leaning against Tj completely with his head on his shoulder and their legs intertwined. It was almost like cuddling, and Tj secretly adored it.</p><p>As soon as Tj came to his senses, he realized that Cyrus was crying. Feeling panic spread to his body, he whispered a quiet \u201cHey, Cyrus.\u201d, and awaited an answer. Cyrus turned around to face Tj, and even in the dark, Tj could see Cyrus\u2019 teary eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d He whispered back, probably thinking that he had annoyed Tj by waking him up in the middle of the night. Tj, on the other hand, was just concerned for the other boy\u2019s feelings. He immediately shook his head, not wanting Cyrus to think that he was being a burden.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, no, it\u2019s fine. Is everything okay?\u201d He asked, voice soft and caring. \u201cI heard you crying, I don\u2019t want you to be upset.\u201d Cyrus managed to smile, and sniffled before answering, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay. I just had a nightmare, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it? You know I\u2019m a great listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, it was just a normal nightmare. Thanks though.\u201d</p><p>Before Tj could think, he lifted up his duvet and motioned for Cyrus lay next to him. As soon as his mind caught up with his body though, he had an internal panic attack because what was he doing? He faked a cough and tried to explain himself, \u201cI mean, you could lay here, if you want. Only if you want to, though. But I was thinking that you might feel safer up here? I don\u2019t want you to be scared.\u201d Tj held his breath while he waited for Cyrus to answer, he was afraid that he\u2019d said something wrong or too revealing of his crush.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cyrus asked. \u201cI mean, I want to, but I wouldn\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Tj smiled, realizing that maybe he didn\u2019t screw up after all, and assured Cyrus that no, he wouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable. After all, he was the one who asked in the first place. Cyrus face broke into a smile as he got up from the mattress on the floor and went to lay down next to Tj. He made sure not to lay too close to him though, considering the two were just friends, and he didn\u2019t want Tj to think he was into him or something. Even if that was the case, Tj didn\u2019t need to know that. No way he\u2019d ever feel the same.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d Tj asked as before getting ready to fall back asleep. Cyrus turned around to face Tj and smiled, said \u201cThank you.\u201d and \u201cI think so.\u201d before turning back around and closing his eyes.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before they fell back to sleep, both a little bit happier than the first time they\u2019d gone to bed that night.</p><p>___</p><p>Just a while later, Tj was once again woken up by the sound of Cyrus crying. His heart broke at the sound of Cyrus\u2019 crying, and he put a hand on his shoulder to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, what\u2019s going on? Are you having nightmares again?\u201d Tj asked, this time even more concerned. Cyrus turned around, upset at the thought of waking Tj up again, and managed to get out a quiet \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still not want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d rather not, they\u2019re just nightmares and I don\u2019t know why I keep having them.\u201d He paused for a while, before continuing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to be such a baby.\u201d</p><p>Tj was quick to assure him that he didn\u2019t think of him that way. \u201cCyrus, crying does not make you a baby, it makes you brave. I don\u2019t ever want you to feel like you have to hide stuff from me, nothing can make me think any differently of you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but break out into a huge grin at that, and for a little while, they just faced each other and examined every part of the other\u2019s face, a comfortable silence filling the room.</p><p>After a while, Tj broke the silence. \u201cI look up to you and admire you so much, you know that, right?\u201d He almost regretted saying it as soon as the words left his mouth, but he realized that there was no point in hiding it. After all, it was true.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Just thought you should know. I feel like people don\u2019t tell you that enough.\u201d</p><p>After another moment of silence, Cyrus felt his screw it instincts kick in and he decided to do something he\u2019d longed for for a long time. He leaned forward and closed the gap between him and Tj by pressing his lips against his. At first, Tj was caught off guard, but as soon as he realized what was happening, he happily melted into the kiss. As soon as they broke apart, both boys smiled at each other.</p><p>\u201cWoah.\u201d Was all that Tj managed to get out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do that for a while now.\u201d Cyrus shyly admitted. Tj couldn\u2019t quite comprehend what was happening, as he was too focused on not letting out a scream of excitement ,\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you did, because so have I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well kiss me again, then.\u201d Cyrus said through a huge grin. Tj, who was smiling just as big, leaned in and pressed his lips against Cyrus\u2019 now familiar ones.</p><p>As they parted, Cyrus let out a little laugh. Tj furrowed his eyebrows and looked at him questioningly. \u201cThat\u2019s not quite the outcome I expected from having nightmares.\u201d Cyrus said and chuckled. Tj did the same, because this was really not how he expected their sleepover to end. Cyrus yawned, and Tj noticed that he was quite tired, too. They\u2019d both woken up in the middle of the night, so it was no surprise that they were sleepy.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay to go back to sleep?\u201d Tj asked, to which Cyrus nodded. Cyrus hesitated before asking \u201cTj? Can you\u2026 um, hold me?\u201d He was happy that the lights were off, so Tj couldn\u2019t see the blush spreading across his cheeks. Little did he know that the same pink color was painted on Tj\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Underdog.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, and moved closer to Tj while not facing him. Tj put him arms around Cyrus waist so that they were spooning, and Tj prayed that Cyrus couldn\u2019t feel how fast his heart was beating in his chest. They stayed in that position for the rest of the night, and Cyrus managed to get through it without a single nightmare.</p></p>",

They&rsquo;d both woken up in the middle of the night, so it was no surprise that they were sleepy.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay to go back to sleep?&rdquo; Tj asked, to which Cyrus nodded. Cyrus hesitated before asking &ldquo;Tj? Can you&hellip; um, hold me?&rdquo; He was happy that the lights were off, so Tj couldn&rsquo;t see the blush spreading across his cheeks. Little did he know that the same pink color was painted on Tj&rsquo;s cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Underdog.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled, and moved closer to Tj while not facing him. Tj put him arms around Cyrus waist so that they were spooning, and Tj prayed that Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t feel how fast his heart was beating in his chest. They stayed in that position for the rest of the night, and Cyrus managed to get through it without a single nightmare.</p></p>",
