They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026<br/></p><!-- more --><p>Crowley\nsat in the Bentley. He had been there for some time, just outside of the large\npark he was supposed to meet his next date in. </p><p>Dumah\nwas another angel. He wanted to feel encouraged by that. The truth of it was\nCrowley that couldn\u2019t stand anyone who was cruel. He had come to grips with\nthis some time ago, and admitted that he was likely better off trying an angel\nthan a demon. </p><p>But\nwhat if this angel was like the last one? What if she thought he was beneath\nher and wanted him to ask for\u2013 he winced \u2013 <i>absolution?</i> As if he needed to be sanctified,\nnot because of the way he acted but on the simple grounds of him being a demon?\n</p><p>What\nif she didn\u2019t bother to see any of his good qualities? He didn\u2019t want to be\npitied or feared, and certainly not in the name of misplaced concern for his\nsoul!</p><p><i>\u2018Inside my heart is breaking</i></p><p><i>My makeup may be flaking</i></p><p><i>But my smile stays ooon.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nsighed Crowley, listening to Mussorgky\u2019s <i>Pictures\nat an Exhibition</i>.</p><p>Might\nas well get it over with.</p><p>If\nthis angel tried anything, he\u2019d give her the slip and be back in the Bentley\nbefore she could say \u2018superiority complex\u2019.</p><p>Maybe\nhe\u2019d call Aziraphale after. It had been such an unspeakable relief to hear his\nvoice again, to remember that there was someone who knew him for who he was and\n<i>liked</i> him for it.</p><p><i>\u2018The Show must go ooon.\u2019</i> <br/></p><p>\u201cAll\nright, all right. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Xxx<i> <br/></i></p><p>Aziraphale\nstood in front of the mirror. This wasn\u2019t something he did very often. After a\ngood few decades wearing a corporation, he rather fancied he knew what he\nlooked like. His clothing he tended to know just as well. It wasn\u2019t a lack of\nvanity on his part, per se. It was that he simply knew what clothes he enjoyed\nmatching together, and how he would look in them. There simply wasn\u2019t a need to\nspend much time looking at himself. <br/></p><p>Today,\nas he readied himself for his next date, he wondered if he had been remiss in\nthat.</p><p>Aziraphale\nliked how he looked. He did, he really did. </p><p>His\nbody was comfortable and familiar, and he\u2019d been in this one long enough that it\nhad stopped feeling like a corporation and had started feeling like <i>himself</i>. He was rather fond of his\nfluffy curls and comfortable layer of fat around his middle.</p><p>But\u2026Wasco\nhad taken one look at him and laughed at his face. Admittedly, the little demon\nlikely wasn\u2019t the best judge, yet the more he thought on it the more it rattled\nhim.</p><p>He\nwasn\u2019t\u2026funny looking. Surely not?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbit his lip.</p><p>The\npassingly man-shaped being in the mirror wore a bright reddish brown coat with\na cheerful green tartan bow-tie. He stared. Maybe the coat was a little faded.\nHis trousers were a deep mustard yellow. They had seen better days too.</p><p>He\nfrowned. He\u2019d been planning to add a handkerchief. Something bright and paisley\npatterned for his breast pocket. It was what he usually did.</p><p>With\na sigh, he shrugged out of his coat. He looked at it miserably. </p><p>Aziraphale\nloved colours. He loved patterns and textures, and the thing about Heaven was\nthat it lacked just about all of it. Everything was severe whites and creams and the\nodd grey. Sometimes you got a pale brown. The best you could do was the metal\ntones, the golds and coppers and bronzes, though it was expected they were used\nsparingly. </p><p>But\nthen there had been earth and the garden bursting with more colours than he had\never seen, and Aziraphale had never looked back.</p><p>With\na sigh he pulled out a camel hair coat from his closet. It wasn\u2019t his favorite.\nIt was more of a sandy cream than a brown. </p><p>He\npulled it on. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>It\nwas snowing. Crowley knew because he was covered in a thin layer of it. He\u2019d\nfound a bench and had been waiting for some ten minutes now, watching as the\nworn wood slowly disappeared beneath a thin layer of fluff.</p><p>His\ndate was late.</p><p>Fifteen\nmore minutes of this and he was going get a coffee. Scratch that, make it a\nlarge, hot whiskey.</p><p>He\nblinked. </p><p>Very\nslowly he looked up.</p><p>A\nwhite deer stood silently in the snow, watching him with soft silvery eyes.</p><p>\u201cEr&hellip;\u201d <br/></p><p>The\ndeer blinked at him, slow and graceful.</p><p>\u201cDumah,\nright?\u201d guessed Crowley.</p><p><i>Yes.</i></p><p>The\ndeer\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t move, and the sound that came out was nothing any human\ncould hope to process, but Crowley understood. He crossed his legs.</p><p><i>\u201c</i>Not a fan of human language?\u201d <br/></p><p><i>Sorry, no. I care for all fauna\non earth. It simply is not something I use.</i></p><p>\u201cAnimals.\nNeat.\u201d Crowley shifted closer to the edge of the bench.</p><p>Duamah\nglowed for a moment, then took the form of a large grey heron, long legs\nkeeping her far from the snow. The angel ran her beak through her feathers\nawkwardly.</p><p><i>I\u2026apologize. I am not comfortable\nwith human forms.</i></p><p>\u201cHey,\nno worries.\u201d Crowley smiled. \u201cI get days like that too.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh?</i></p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He\nstretched out his spine with a satisfying <i>pop</i>\nand slithered off the bench, wincing at the feel of the cold snow against his\nscales.</p><p>\u201cSsseee?\u201d</p><p>Dumah\nstartled, eyes widening in fear. She took a few hasty steps back her wings raised\ndefensively. </p><p>\u201cOh,\nhey. No. It\u2019ssssss all right.\u201d Crowley\u2019s heart sunk. He hadn\u2019t meant to scare\nher. </p><p><i>Aziraphale was </i>never<i> afraid of me, </i>came the sudden thought<i>.</i> <i>Not\neven at the beginning</i>*.</p><p>*The\nfirst moment Crowley and Aziraphale had locked eyes all those millennia ago,\nCrowley had been expecting to see fear or hatred or disgust\u2014that was what he\nhad gotten when he tried the North, West and South gates of Eden. The Guardian\nof the Eastern Gate, however, had made a little cooing sound, crouched right\ndown and promptly asked him what he was. Crowley had admitted, a little\nembarrassed, that he was a demon. Aziraphale had waved him off impatiently and\nsaid \u201cYes but what <i>are</i> you?\u201d There\nwas no animal half as extraordinary in the whole garden as whatever he was,\nAziraphale told him, eyes bright with delight and wonder, flaming sword lying\nforgotten against a nearby rock. Crowley had decided right there and then that\nthey would be friends**.</p><p> **He hadn\u2019t regretted it for a single day\nsince. </p><p>Crowley\nlaid himself down in the snow, exposing some of his belly. \u201cI won\u2019t bite.\nSsssnake\u2019ssss honour.\u201d<i></i></p><p><i>You are</i> The <i>Serpent, aren\u2019t you? </i>She asked.</p><p>\u201cMy\nname\u2019ssss Crowley. But yesssss.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cAren\u2019t you ssssupossssssed to\ncare for all animalsssss?\u201d</p><p><i>All except the serpent.</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ssss\na little harsssssh, don\u2019t you think? It wasssss <i>me</i> that causssssed the trouble. The ressst of them didn\u2019t have\nanything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Dumah\nlowered her feathers slowly. <i>No. You are\nright. It was wrong of me to make that assumption.</i></p><p>Crowley\nwished he had eyelids so he could blink at her. \u201cReally?\u201d </p><p>That\nwas it? No guilt tripping, no deflecting, no condemnations, just up and admitting\nto it?</p><p><i>Yes. </i></p><p>Crowley\u2019s\ntongue sucked back into his mouth. Dumah took a cautious step forward. </p><p><i>I will admit your form does set\nme on edge.</i></p><p>\u201cOh.\nSsssorry. I can sssswitch\u2014\u201c</p><p><i>No. No please, don\u2019t. It was kind\nof you to take my preferences into account. I wish you to stay as you are. It\nwill be good for me to get over my fear.</i></p><p>\u201cEr\u2026right.\nLet me know if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p><i>Of course.</i></p><p>Crowley\nslithered closer, wishing it wasn\u2019t such a cold day and he didn\u2019t have snow\nnearly up to his eyeballs. Dumah watched him closely. When he was close enough she\nhesitantly lent down. Her beak gently brushed against Crowley\u2019s scales.</p><p>\u201cSsssee?\nNo biting from me,\u201d said Crowley helpfully.</p><p><i>No</i>, agreed Dumah slowly. </p><p>\u201cDid\nyou want to get sssssssomething to eat?\u201d asked Crowley. \u201cThere\u2019ssssss thissss great\nlittle bakery nearby where\u2014erm. Hmm. Right. Animal form.\u201d</p><p><i>Perhaps not.</i></p><p>\u201cWe\ncould figure it out. It\u2019ssss amazzzzzing what people won\u2019t noticccce if you\ngive them a bit of a nudge.\u201d And now that he\u2019d brought it up he really was\ncraving some of those excellent apple dumplings. His mouth started to water\njust at the thought.</p><p><i>If you don\u2019t mind, I would rather\nnot.</i></p><p>\u201cMnh?\nYou ssssure? It ssshouldn\u2019t be much trouble.\u201d</p><p>She\nducked her head.<i> Thank you, no. I\u2019m\nafraid I am not very fond of humans.</i></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p><i>You must think of it from my\nposition. Animals are my charges, yet everything in Heaven and Hell is designed\nfor humans. It is\u2026difficult to not feel frustrated towards them when they do so\nmuch harm to my own.</i></p><p>\u201cSssssupossssse\nthat checkssss out. They\u2019re not all bad though. Humansssss.\u201d</p><p><i>No. Maybe not. But enough are</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nmissssssing out on an awful lot you know,\u201d he tried.</p><p><i>I think I will survive.</i></p><p>He\nshrugged as best he could without shoulders. \u201cAll right then.\u201d</p><p>Dumah\nshifted again, changing into a large white rabbit with the same silvery eyes.\nHer ears drooped.</p><p><i>I am sorry for being difficult.</i></p><p>\u201cNah,\nit\u2019ssss all right. I wouldn\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>The\nrabbit cocked her head. <i>You are very kind.</i></p><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d\nCrowley ducked his head. \u201cThanksssss. Don\u2019t let it get around.\u201d</p><p><i>Wouldn\u2019t dream of it. </i>He got the feeling she\nwas smiling at him. <i>Would you like to\nexplore the park? I do not usually come so far into the city.</i></p><p>Crowley\nsmiled. \u201cSsssssure! Been a while sssssinccccce I\u2019ve last been out in thissss\nssssskin.\u201d</p><p>Maybe\nthey could accidentally stumble across some humans. It would make a fun bit of\nfuss. Dumah would at least appreciate him scaring them a little.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cThe\nearth is a fascinating place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nyes. Yes I certainly think so,\u201d agreed Aziraphale.</p><p>This\ndate was going better than the others. Chayyliel was a Throne who had spent\nsome time on earth. He\u2019d been spending the better part of an hour telling\nAziraphale about his latest missions and thwartings and the trouble he\u2019d had\ndown on earth while they sat in one of London\u2019s fancier restaurants. </p><p>Chayyliel\nreally was an engaging speaker. Aziraphale could simply eat his meal and drink\nhis wine and nod and gasp at the right places, and leave the rest to the other\nangel. No having to fumble around struggling to keep the conversation going\ntoday. </p><p>Of\ncourse, it wasn\u2019t exactly a conversation. More of a monologue, really. But at\nleast there were none of those dreadful silences.</p><p>\u201cHumans\nneed so much guidance,\u201d said Chayyliel, handsome in a sharp, clean kind of way,\nwith his neat blond hair and immaculate grey suit. \u201cI\u2019ve almost grown fond of\nthem, in a sense. They need a firm hand lest they turn to paths of sin.\u201d He\ntook a measured sip of his mineral water. \u201cOnce mustn\u2019t go soft. So long as\nsouls are saved one must do what they can. It\u2019s in their best interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d\nAziraphale took a sip of his wine. It turned into a gulp, and he vaguely wished\nit would hurry up and affect him more.</p><p>\u201cThings\nare always more difficult around this time of year with\u2014what do they call it,\nValentine\u2019s Day? \u00a0Of course, chocolate\nhas to go. It simply can\u2019t be allowed.\u201d <br/></p><p>Aziraphale\nput down his glass a bit more heavily than he meant to. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit rash,\nisn\u2019t it?\u201d he managed. \u201cSurely chocolate has caused much more good than bad. The\ntaste could only be described as divine, after all. They <i>do</i> call it the food of the gods for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo\nthey?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nnodded. \u201cI\u2019ve always considered it a compliment.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p> Chayyliel eyed him across the table, finishing\nhis forkful of salad with measured, neat bites. His gaze dragged over Aziraphale\u2019s\ndecade old coat and the rounded shape of his belly beneath it, settling on his\nnear empty glass of wine and plate of honey glazed chicken. He finished chewing\nand neatly put down his cutlery. He steepled his hands. </p><p>\u201cYou\nsee, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s the small things that cannot be tolerated.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cA\nminor indulgence may seem harmless at first. But one leads to many, and soon\nthey spread like a plague. With such allowances, even the most promising souls\nare corrupted by sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nchocolate, really? Have you ever tried it? It\u2019s done so much more good than\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cOne\nmust be firm in their affirmations. And hold <i>themselves</i> to the highest standard.\u201d He gave Aziraphale a sharp\nlook. \u201cHow else are we to lead from example?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nmade a noise in the back of his throat. \u201cNo, I think you\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHumans are so incredibly skilled at finding balance. They\u2019re endlessly\ncomplex. And sometimes it\u2019s the little indulgences that give them the strength\nto resist more dangerous sins. It\u2019s not all so very cut and dry. Er, for the\nmost part, of course,\u201d he corrected himself. \u201cWhy, even things they do while\nmeaning to be bad can have resoundingly good effects, and vise a versa. Not to\nsay wanting to do bad is <i>good</i>, but it\nsimply isn\u2019t as black and white as all that. There\u2019s context for one. It\u2019s\nineffable.\u201d He felt rather pleased with himself and reached for his glass of\nwine.</p><p>Chayyliel\nwas not impressed. He hadn\u2019t moved in all of Aziraphale\u2019s little impassioned\nspeech, and now there was something very hard in his eyes as he looked across\nthe table. </p><p>\u201cIneffable?\nI believe we may have a different understanding of its meaning.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared at him, suddenly feeling very cold. \u201cYes, I think we do.\u201d</p><p>He\ndid not like this conversation. For one, Aziraphale was quickly doubting it was\na conversation any more, and had rapidly become something of an Argument. Not\nthe type he and Crowley liked to have, where they snipped at each other and\nexchanged ideas and metaphors playfully, and there was no real menace and no\none really kept score*.</p><p>*Score\nwas kept for the express purposes of teasing the other at some future date. It\nwas awfully fun. </p><p>This\nfelt different. This felt more like a Disagreement.</p><p>In\nfact, Aziraphale felt a bit like he did during those unfortunate times he was\nforced to be in Gabriel\u2019s presence, like he was some particularly unpleasant\nweed being sized up by a disgusted gardener with sheers.</p><p>Chayyliel\npatted his mouth with his napkin and set it down neatly on the table. \u201cLook,\nAziraphale. It\u2019s clear you need help.\u201d</p><p>He\nblinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\na sorry excuse for an angel. An embarrassment really.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nspluttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nlet yourself go. It\u2019s shameful. That\u2019s no way to represent Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\n<i>beg</i> your pardon?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot all bad. You\u2019re almost likeable,\u201d said Chayyliel in a way he clearly\nthought was charitable \u201cThere\u2019s still some hope. If we go Up now I\u2019m sure they\ncan get you sorted. You\u2019ll have to undergo some mortification, but suffering is\ngood for the soul, after all. You certainly could use some.\u201d</p><p>In\nall of his millennium on earth, Aziraphale had never thrown his drink in\nsomeone\u2019s face. He\u2019d secretly fantasized about doing it the odd time or two. It\nhad such flair! What an effective was to shut someone down, to end a\nconversation! But of course, being an angel, this activity was strictly\nrestricted to his imagination*.</p><p>*Plus,\nhe hated to waste good food or drink.</p><p>As\nAziraphale pushed back his chair and stormed out of the restaurant, he was\npleased to note that throwing his wine in someone\u2019s face\u2019s was <i>exactly</i> as rewarding as he imagined it\nmight be.</p><p>xxx</p><p>It\nwas rush hour.</p><p>Crowley\nwas in a good enough mood that he didn\u2019t bother to get around it, and was happy\nenough to inch along with the other drivers on the busy London roads. He\u2019d\nturned the Bentley\u2019s heat up on full blast, warmth slow to return to his limbs\nafter spending the better part of two hours slithering around in the snow. </p><p>The\ndate had gone all right. Dumah was gentle and considerate and it had been fun\nto spend time as a serpent. Cold, but fun. He could see Dumah as a sort of\nfriend, maybe. But she hadn\u2019t liked humans and didn\u2019t want to have anything to\ndo with them or what they made. That was a bit of a deal breaker.</p><p>Besides,\nCrowley needed someone who was a bit more\u2026fiery. <i>Sassy</i>, he thought with a grin. Flamboyant. Maybe even a little\nfussy. He liked people who were so sure of themselves and what they liked and\nwhat they did. Mind you, they had to be somewhat open minded, or at least happy\nto have a good argument about it over drinks.</p><p>Without\nany warning the Bentley lurched to a screeching halt.</p><p>A seat-belt manifested at the last second and saved Crowley from crashing headlong\ninto the dashboard</p><p>\u201cHey!\nWhat gives?\u201d</p><p>Horns\nand angry shouting erupted behind him. They hadn\u2019t hit anyone. He put his foot\ndown on the pedal. The Bentley would not budge.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong?\u201d he asked her. The Bentely\u2019s horn started honking loudly. \u201cAre you angry\nat me? Did I\u2014<i>Hhnng!\u201c</i></p><p>The\ncar jerked towards the pavement, knocking his gaze up from the dashboard. His\neyes landed on a familiar figure walking a few yards away.</p><p>\u201cAngel!\u201d</p><p>The\ndoor sprang open before Crowley could reach for it. If he had bothered to look,\nhe would have seen the Bentley neatly park herself by the side of the road.\nCrowley\u2019s didn\u2019t notice, too happy to see his friend.</p><p>\u201cAngel!\nHey!\u201d </p><p>He\ncaught up to him, a grin already on his face. </p><p>Azirphale\nturned, startled. \u201cOh. Hu-hullo. My dear.\u201d</p><p>Crolwey\nslowed, taking him in. Something was wrong.</p><p>His\nhair was all stiff, some sort of gel trapping his curls from their usual fluffy\nabandon. Aziraphale wore a pale cream coat and dull grey trousers. It was\njarring to see him dressed so colourlessly. The angel sniffed, meeting his eyes\nguiltily.</p><p>\u201cYou\nlook\u2026\u201d The angel cringed, looking half embarrassed and half miserable and very\nmuch like he had been crying. Crowley felt his heart give a little lurch. <br/></p><p>\u201cUncomfortable,\u201d\nsaid Crowley firmly. </p><p>Aziraphale\nblinked.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d\nCrowley ran a hand through the angel\u2019s hair, banishing the gel and freeing his\ncurls to their usual messy glory. He smoothed down Aziraphale\u2019s coat, and\nmiracled a green carnation, sticking the flower in his breast pocket.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d\nsaid Crowley definitely. \u201cMuch better.\u201d <br/></p><p>Suddenly\nhe had his arms full of Aziraphale, the angel lurching forward and hugging him\ntightly. He felt his mouth go dry. Aziraphale was warm and soft against him. He\nslowly wrapped his own arms around him, resting his cheek on the angels\u2019 curls.\nAziraphale made a small sound and squeezed him tighter. Crowley rubbed his\nback.</p><p>\u201cHey.\nHey, it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>They\nbroke apart after a long few moments, Crowley trailing his hands down the\nangels\u2019 arms, strangely reluctant to let him go. Aziraphale\u2019s glasses were half\nfogged up, his face still a study in misery.</p><p>\u201cCome\non.\u201d Crowley kept a firm hold of Aziraphale\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nnodded gratefully and followed him over to the Bentley. They got inside,\nCrowley starting the car up again and merging back into traffic.</p><p>He\nshot a glance at his companion.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas still for long moment. </p><p><i>\u2018Look into my eyes and you\u2019ll see\n</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m the only one,\u2019 </i>sang Freddie Mercury.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d\nAziraphale sighed. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible angel, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s\nhands tightened on the wheel. \u201cYou\u2019re not the shining example of it.\u201d The angel\nslumped. \u201cBut angel, why would you <i>want</i>\nto be?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared at him.</p><p><i>\u2018You\u2019ve captured my love</i></p><p><i>Stolen my heart</i></p><p><i>Changed my life\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cThey\ndon\u2019t enjoy things,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cThey don\u2019t <i>want</i> to enjoy things. Perfect angels are terrifying. And the ones\nlike Gabriel are just smug, self-obsessed bastards.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cThe\npoint, the <i>point</i>,\u201d said Crowley,\nsuddenly determined to make him understand, \u201cIs that I don\u2019t want you to be\nperfect. And I\u2019m not saying this as a demon, I\u2019m saying it as your, your <i>friend</i>. I like you as you are. I don\u2019t\nwant you to be like them. <i>You </i>don\u2019t\nwant to be like them. They\u2019re dull, self-righteous pricks with no appreciation\nfor good take-out.\u201d </p><p>The\nangel gave a little laugh. He smiled at him, taking it as a good sign. </p><p>\u201cYou\nhave to decide for yourself what you want to be\u2014and not let anyone else tell\nyou what you are, or what you\u2019re supposed to be. Not even me!\u201d He shrugged a\nlittle self-consciously. \u201cDon\u2019t judge yourself by their standards. I\u2019ve\u2026always\nadmired how you\u2019ve kept to your own moral code.\u201d Crowley smiled. \u201cEven when you\ntry so hard to deny it. You can\u2019t let them decide who you should be.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018You take my breath away\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>Aziraphale\ntook Crowley\u2019s free hand in his own and squeezed it gently. Crowley turned his\nhand around and laced their fingers together, squeezing back.</p><p><i>\u2018You can reduce me to tears </i></p><p><i>With a single sigh</i></p><p><i>(Please don\u2019t cry anymore)</i></p><p><i>Every breath that you take </i></p><p><i>Every sound that you make</i></p><p><i>Is a whisper in my ear\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nvery glad you ran into me,\u201d said Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry\nto get all\u2014\u201d he hiccuped softly, \u201c\u2014all soppy on you. Goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nbe,\u201d said Crowley firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing our drunken nights in haven\u2019t seen\nbefore.\u201d</p><p>That\nwon him a watery laugh.</p><p><i>\u2018I could give up all my life</i></p><p><i>For just one kiss</i></p><p><i>I would surely die </i></p><p><i>If you dismiss me </i></p><p><i>From your love\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cThank\nyou for talking to me.\u201d Crowley glanced over at him. \u201cThat day. In the garden,\u201d said Aziraphale. \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed you to come up to me, Guardian of the Eastern Gate\nand all, and strike up conversation, but.\u201d He squeezed Crowley\u2019s hand again.\n\u201cI\u2019m so very glad you did.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018You take my breath away\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>Even\ncold-blooded beings blush. Crowley gave a pleased little shrug, the warmth from\nthe angel\u2019s hand in his own so unspeakably comforting.</p><p>\u201cYou\njust. Looked like a friend.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nlaughed again. \u201cSo did you. Funny little noodle that you were.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nmade a noise of mock outrage. \u201c<i>Noodle</i>.\u201d</p><p>He\nnodded. \u201cI like noodles. It\u2019s a compliment. You are very cute like that, you\nknow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute!\u201d\nCrowley felt ridiculously pleased by this. He tried to scowl. \u201cI\u2019m a serpent.\nI\u2019m <i>the</i> serpent. I have a fearsome\nreputation. Angels are terrified of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\ndear, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\nare! You ought to watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\nI\u2019m terribly frightened, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nthumb rubbed across the back of his hand, sending warm tingles all through his\nbody.</p><p>They\nreached the bookshop, Crowley pulling over and parking against the curve.</p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nthrew wine in a Throne\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlooked over at him. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\ncalled me a sorry excuse for an angel. And he wanted to ban chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\n<i>bastard.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nfeel bad about it now.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cIt was a terrible waste of good wine.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nsniggered, unable to keep the fond grin off his face. Aziraphale joined him,\ndissolving into giggles. </p><p>\u201cOh\nangel,\u201d managed Crowley. \u201cDon\u2019t ever change.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nleaned over and hugged him. Crowley hugged back, shutting his eyes and drinking\nin the warmth of his friend. </p><p><i>\u2018So please don\u2019t go</i></p><p><i>Don\u2019t leave me here all by myself</i></p><p><i>I get ever so lonely</i></p><p><i>From time to time\u2026.\u2019</i></p><p>They\npulled apart.

Aziraphale\u2019s warmth clung to him, safe and familiar.\nHe let out a long breath.</p><p><i>\u2018I will find you</i></p><p><i>Anywhere you go</i></p><p><i>Right until the ends of the earth</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ll get no sleep</i></p><p><i>Till I find you<br/></i></p><p><i>To tell you when I\u2019ve found you</i></p><p><i>I love you\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>He\nchoked.</p><p>Then\nhe blinked.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>He\nslowly opened the glove compartment, taking out the quiz. <br/></p><p>\u201cCome\non Adam,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMatch me with the one person in all of Heaven and Hell\nwho I want to be with.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nclosed the bookshop door behind him, relieved to be back in its familiar\ncomfort.</p><p>There\nwas a flash of light, and a booklet of pink papers materialized in front of\nhim.

He didn\u2019t want to be\npitied or feared, and certainly not in the name of misplaced concern for his\nsoul!</p><p><i>\u2018Inside my heart is breaking</i></p><p><i>My makeup may be flaking</i></p><p><i>But my smile stays ooon.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nsighed Crowley, listening to Mussorgky\u2019s <i>Pictures\nat an Exhibition</i>.</p><p>Might\nas well get it over with.</p><p>If\nthis angel tried anything, he\u2019d give her the slip and be back in the Bentley\nbefore she could say \u2018superiority complex\u2019.</p><p>Maybe\nhe\u2019d call Aziraphale after. It had been such an unspeakable relief to hear his\nvoice again, to remember that there was someone who knew him for who he was and\n<i>liked</i> him for it.</p><p><i>\u2018The Show must go ooon.\u2019</i> <br></p><p>\u201cAll\nright, all right. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Xxx<i> <br></i></p><p>Aziraphale\nstood in front of the mirror. This wasn\u2019t something he did very often. After a\ngood few decades wearing a corporation, he rather fancied he knew what he\nlooked like. His clothing he tended to know just as well. It wasn\u2019t a lack of\nvanity on his part, per se. It was that he simply knew what clothes he enjoyed\nmatching together, and how he would look in them. There simply wasn\u2019t a need to\nspend much time looking at himself. <br></p><p>Today,\nas he readied himself for his next date, he wondered if he had been remiss in\nthat.</p><p>Aziraphale\nliked how he looked. He did, he really did. </p><p>His\nbody was comfortable and familiar, and he\u2019d been in this one long enough that it\nhad stopped feeling like a corporation and had started feeling like <i>himself</i>. He was rather fond of his\nfluffy curls and comfortable layer of fat around his middle.</p><p>But\u2026Wasco\nhad taken one look at him and laughed at his face. Admittedly, the little demon\nlikely wasn\u2019t the best judge, yet the more he thought on it the more it rattled\nhim.</p><p>He\nwasn\u2019t\u2026funny looking. Surely not?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbit his lip.</p><p>The\npassingly man-shaped being in the mirror wore a bright reddish brown coat with\na cheerful green tartan bow-tie. He stared. Maybe the coat was a little faded.\nHis trousers were a deep mustard yellow. They had seen better days too.</p><p>He\nfrowned. He\u2019d been planning to add a handkerchief. Something bright and paisley\npatterned for his breast pocket. It was what he usually did.</p><p>With\na sigh, he shrugged out of his coat. He looked at it miserably. </p><p>Aziraphale\nloved colours. He loved patterns and textures, and the thing about Heaven was\nthat it lacked just about all of it. Everything was severe whites and creams and the\nodd grey. Sometimes you got a pale brown. The best you could do was the metal\ntones, the golds and coppers and bronzes, though it was expected they were used\nsparingly. </p><p>But\nthen there had been earth and the garden bursting with more colours than he had\never seen, and Aziraphale had never looked back.</p><p>With\na sigh he pulled out a camel hair coat from his closet. It wasn\u2019t his favorite.\nIt was more of a sandy cream than a brown. </p><p>He\npulled it on. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>It\nwas snowing. Crowley knew because he was covered in a thin layer of it. He\u2019d\nfound a bench and had been waiting for some ten minutes now, watching as the\nworn wood slowly disappeared beneath a thin layer of fluff.</p><p>His\ndate was late.</p><p>Fifteen\nmore minutes of this and he was going get a coffee. Scratch that, make it a\nlarge, hot whiskey.</p><p>He\nblinked. </p><p>Very\nslowly he looked up.</p><p>A\nwhite deer stood silently in the snow, watching him with soft silvery eyes.</p><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d <br></p><p>The\ndeer blinked at him, slow and graceful.</p><p>\u201cDumah,\nright?\u201d guessed Crowley.</p><p><i>Yes.</i></p><p>The\ndeer\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t move, and the sound that came out was nothing any human\ncould hope to process, but Crowley understood. He crossed his legs.</p><p><i>\u201c</i>Not a fan of human language?\u201d <br></p><p><i>Sorry, no. I care for all fauna\non earth. It simply is not something I use.</i></p><p>\u201cAnimals.\nNeat.\u201d Crowley shifted closer to the edge of the bench.</p><p>Duamah\nglowed for a moment, then took the form of a large grey heron, long legs\nkeeping her far from the snow. The angel ran her beak through her feathers\nawkwardly.</p><p><i>I\u2026apologize. I am not comfortable\nwith human forms.</i></p><p>\u201cHey,\nno worries.\u201d Crowley smiled. \u201cI get days like that too.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh?</i></p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He\nstretched out his spine with a satisfying <i>pop</i>\nand slithered off the bench, wincing at the feel of the cold snow against his\nscales.</p><p>\u201cSsseee?\u201d</p><p>Dumah\nstartled, eyes widening in fear. She took a few hasty steps back her wings raised\ndefensively. </p><p>\u201cOh,\nhey. No. It\u2019ssssss all right.\u201d Crowley\u2019s heart sunk. He hadn\u2019t meant to scare\nher. </p><p><i>Aziraphale was </i>never<i> afraid of me, </i>came the sudden thought<i>.</i> <i>Not\neven at the beginning</i>*.</p><p>*The\nfirst moment Crowley and Aziraphale had locked eyes all those millennia ago,\nCrowley had been expecting to see fear or hatred or disgust\u2014that was what he\nhad gotten when he tried the North, West and South gates of Eden. The Guardian\nof the Eastern Gate, however, had made a little cooing sound, crouched right\ndown and promptly asked him what he was. Crowley had admitted, a little\nembarrassed, that he was a demon. Aziraphale had waved him off impatiently and\nsaid \u201cYes but what <i>are</i> you?\u201d There\nwas no animal half as extraordinary in the whole garden as whatever he was,\nAziraphale told him, eyes bright with delight and wonder, flaming sword lying\nforgotten against a nearby rock. Crowley had decided right there and then that\nthey would be friends**.</p><p> **He hadn\u2019t regretted it for a single day\nsince. </p><p>Crowley\nlaid himself down in the snow, exposing some of his belly. \u201cI won\u2019t bite.\nSsssnake\u2019ssss honour.\u201d<i></i></p><p><i>You are</i> The <i>Serpent, aren\u2019t you? </i>She asked.</p><p>\u201cMy\nname\u2019ssss Crowley. But yesssss.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cAren\u2019t you ssssupossssssed to\ncare for all animalsssss?\u201d</p><p><i>All except the serpent.</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ssss\na little harsssssh, don\u2019t you think? It wasssss <i>me</i> that causssssed the trouble. The ressst of them didn\u2019t have\nanything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Dumah\nlowered her feathers slowly. <i>No. You are\nright. It was wrong of me to make that assumption.</i></p><p>Crowley\nwished he had eyelids so he could blink at her. \u201cReally?\u201d </p><p>That\nwas it? No guilt tripping, no deflecting, no condemnations, just up and admitting\nto it?</p><p><i>Yes. </i></p><p>Crowley\u2019s\ntongue sucked back into his mouth. Dumah took a cautious step forward. </p><p><i>I will admit your form does set\nme on edge.</i></p><p>\u201cOh.\nSsssorry. I can sssswitch\u2014\u201c</p><p><i>No. No please, don\u2019t. It was kind\nof you to take my preferences into account. I wish you to stay as you are. It\nwill be good for me to get over my fear.</i></p><p>\u201cEr\u2026right.\nLet me know if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p><i>Of course.</i></p><p>Crowley\nslithered closer, wishing it wasn\u2019t such a cold day and he didn\u2019t have snow\nnearly up to his eyeballs. Dumah watched him closely. When he was close enough she\nhesitantly lent down. Her beak gently brushed against Crowley\u2019s scales.</p><p>\u201cSsssee?\nNo biting from me,\u201d said Crowley helpfully.</p><p><i>No</i>, agreed Dumah slowly. </p><p>\u201cDid\nyou want to get sssssssomething to eat?\u201d asked Crowley. \u201cThere\u2019ssssss thissss great\nlittle bakery nearby where\u2014erm. Hmm. Right. Animal form.\u201d</p><p><i>Perhaps not.</i></p><p>\u201cWe\ncould figure it out. It\u2019ssss amazzzzzing what people won\u2019t noticccce if you\ngive them a bit of a nudge.\u201d And now that he\u2019d brought it up he really was\ncraving some of those excellent apple dumplings. His mouth started to water\njust at the thought.</p><p><i>If you don\u2019t mind, I would rather\nnot.</i></p><p>\u201cMnh?\nYou ssssure? It ssshouldn\u2019t be much trouble.\u201d</p><p>She\nducked her head.<i> Thank you, no. I\u2019m\nafraid I am not very fond of humans.</i></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p><i>You must think of it from my\nposition. Animals are my charges, yet everything in Heaven and Hell is designed\nfor humans. It is\u2026difficult to not feel frustrated towards them when they do so\nmuch harm to my own.</i></p><p>\u201cSssssupossssse\nthat checkssss out. They\u2019re not all bad though. Humansssss.\u201d</p><p><i>No. Maybe not. But enough are</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nmissssssing out on an awful lot you know,\u201d he tried.</p><p><i>I think I will survive.</i></p><p>He\nshrugged as best he could without shoulders. \u201cAll right then.\u201d</p><p>Dumah\nshifted again, changing into a large white rabbit with the same silvery eyes.\nHer ears drooped.</p><p><i>I am sorry for being difficult.</i></p><p>\u201cNah,\nit\u2019ssss all right. I wouldn\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>The\nrabbit cocked her head. <i>You are very kind.</i></p><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d\nCrowley ducked his head. \u201cThanksssss. Don\u2019t let it get around.\u201d</p><p><i>Wouldn\u2019t dream of it. </i>He got the feeling she\nwas smiling at him. <i>Would you like to\nexplore the park? I do not usually come so far into the city.</i></p><p>Crowley\nsmiled. \u201cSsssssure! Been a while sssssinccccce I\u2019ve last been out in thissss\nssssskin.\u201d</p><p>Maybe\nthey could accidentally stumble across some humans. It would make a fun bit of\nfuss. Dumah would at least appreciate him scaring them a little.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cThe\nearth is a fascinating place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nyes. Yes I certainly think so,\u201d agreed Aziraphale.</p><p>This\ndate was going better than the others. Chayyliel was a Throne who had spent\nsome time on earth. He\u2019d been spending the better part of an hour telling\nAziraphale about his latest missions and thwartings and the trouble he\u2019d had\ndown on earth while they sat in one of London\u2019s fancier restaurants. </p><p>Chayyliel\nreally was an engaging speaker. Aziraphale could simply eat his meal and drink\nhis wine and nod and gasp at the right places, and leave the rest to the other\nangel. No having to fumble around struggling to keep the conversation going\ntoday. </p><p>Of\ncourse, it wasn\u2019t exactly a conversation. More of a monologue, really. But at\nleast there were none of those dreadful silences.</p><p>\u201cHumans\nneed so much guidance,\u201d said Chayyliel, handsome in a sharp, clean kind of way,\nwith his neat blond hair and immaculate grey suit. \u201cI\u2019ve almost grown fond of\nthem, in a sense. They need a firm hand lest they turn to paths of sin.\u201d He\ntook a measured sip of his mineral water. \u201cOnce mustn\u2019t go soft. So long as\nsouls are saved one must do what they can. It\u2019s in their best interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d\nAziraphale took a sip of his wine. It turned into a gulp, and he vaguely wished\nit would hurry up and affect him more.</p><p>\u201cThings\nare always more difficult around this time of year with\u2014what do they call it,\nValentine\u2019s Day? \u00a0Of course, chocolate\nhas to go. It simply can\u2019t be allowed.\u201d <br></p><p>Aziraphale\nput down his glass a bit more heavily than he meant to. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit rash,\nisn\u2019t it?\u201d he managed. \u201cSurely chocolate has caused much more good than bad. The\ntaste could only be described as divine, after all. They <i>do</i> call it the food of the gods for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo\nthey?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nnodded. \u201cI\u2019ve always considered it a compliment.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p> Chayyliel eyed him across the table, finishing\nhis forkful of salad with measured, neat bites. His gaze dragged over Aziraphale\u2019s\ndecade old coat and the rounded shape of his belly beneath it, settling on his\nnear empty glass of wine and plate of honey glazed chicken. He finished chewing\nand neatly put down his cutlery. He steepled his hands. </p><p>\u201cYou\nsee, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s the small things that cannot be tolerated.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cA\nminor indulgence may seem harmless at first. But one leads to many, and soon\nthey spread like a plague. With such allowances, even the most promising souls\nare corrupted by sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nchocolate, really? Have you ever tried it? It\u2019s done so much more good than\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cOne\nmust be firm in their affirmations. And hold <i>themselves</i> to the highest standard.\u201d He gave Aziraphale a sharp\nlook. \u201cHow else are we to lead from example?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nmade a noise in the back of his throat. \u201cNo, I think you\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHumans are so incredibly skilled at finding balance. They\u2019re endlessly\ncomplex. And sometimes it\u2019s the little indulgences that give them the strength\nto resist more dangerous sins. It\u2019s not all so very cut and dry. Er, for the\nmost part, of course,\u201d he corrected himself. \u201cWhy, even things they do while\nmeaning to be bad can have resoundingly good effects, and vise a versa. Not to\nsay wanting to do bad is <i>good</i>, but it\nsimply isn\u2019t as black and white as all that. There\u2019s context for one. It\u2019s\nineffable.\u201d He felt rather pleased with himself and reached for his glass of\nwine.</p><p>Chayyliel\nwas not impressed. He hadn\u2019t moved in all of Aziraphale\u2019s little impassioned\nspeech, and now there was something very hard in his eyes as he looked across\nthe table. </p><p>\u201cIneffable?\nI believe we may have a different understanding of its meaning.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared at him, suddenly feeling very cold. \u201cYes, I think we do.\u201d</p><p>He\ndid not like this conversation. For one, Aziraphale was quickly doubting it was\na conversation any more, and had rapidly become something of an Argument. Not\nthe type he and Crowley liked to have, where they snipped at each other and\nexchanged ideas and metaphors playfully, and there was no real menace and no\none really kept score*.</p><p>*Score\nwas kept for the express purposes of teasing the other at some future date. It\nwas awfully fun. </p><p>This\nfelt different. This felt more like a Disagreement.</p><p>In\nfact, Aziraphale felt a bit like he did during those unfortunate times he was\nforced to be in Gabriel\u2019s presence, like he was some particularly unpleasant\nweed being sized up by a disgusted gardener with sheers.</p><p>Chayyliel\npatted his mouth with his napkin and set it down neatly on the table. \u201cLook,\nAziraphale. It\u2019s clear you need help.\u201d</p><p>He\nblinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\na sorry excuse for an angel. An embarrassment really.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nspluttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nlet yourself go. It\u2019s shameful. That\u2019s no way to represent Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\n<i>beg</i> your pardon?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot all bad. You\u2019re almost likeable,\u201d said Chayyliel in a way he clearly\nthought was charitable \u201cThere\u2019s still some hope. If we go Up now I\u2019m sure they\ncan get you sorted. You\u2019ll have to undergo some mortification, but suffering is\ngood for the soul, after all. You certainly could use some.\u201d</p><p>In\nall of his millennium on earth, Aziraphale had never thrown his drink in\nsomeone\u2019s face. He\u2019d secretly fantasized about doing it the odd time or two. It\nhad such flair! What an effective was to shut someone down, to end a\nconversation! But of course, being an angel, this activity was strictly\nrestricted to his imagination*.</p><p>*Plus,\nhe hated to waste good food or drink.</p><p>As\nAziraphale pushed back his chair and stormed out of the restaurant, he was\npleased to note that throwing his wine in someone\u2019s face\u2019s was <i>exactly</i> as rewarding as he imagined it\nmight be.</p><p>xxx</p><p>It\nwas rush hour.</p><p>Crowley\nwas in a good enough mood that he didn\u2019t bother to get around it, and was happy\nenough to inch along with the other drivers on the busy London roads. He\u2019d\nturned the Bentley\u2019s heat up on full blast, warmth slow to return to his limbs\nafter spending the better part of two hours slithering around in the snow. </p><p>The\ndate had gone all right. Dumah was gentle and considerate and it had been fun\nto spend time as a serpent. Cold, but fun. He could see Dumah as a sort of\nfriend, maybe. But she hadn\u2019t liked humans and didn\u2019t want to have anything to\ndo with them or what they made. That was a bit of a deal breaker.</p><p>Besides,\nCrowley needed someone who was a bit more\u2026fiery. <i>Sassy</i>, he thought with a grin. Flamboyant. Maybe even a little\nfussy. He liked people who were so sure of themselves and what they liked and\nwhat they did. Mind you, they had to be somewhat open minded, or at least happy\nto have a good argument about it over drinks.</p><p>Without\nany warning the Bentley lurched to a screeching halt.</p><p>A seat-belt manifested at the last second and saved Crowley from crashing headlong\ninto the dashboard</p><p>\u201cHey!\nWhat gives?\u201d</p><p>Horns\nand angry shouting erupted behind him. They hadn\u2019t hit anyone. He put his foot\ndown on the pedal. The Bentley would not budge.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong?\u201d he asked her. The Bentely\u2019s horn started honking loudly. \u201cAre you angry\nat me? Did I\u2014<i>Hhnng!\u201c</i></p><p>The\ncar jerked towards the pavement, knocking his gaze up from the dashboard. His\neyes landed on a familiar figure walking a few yards away.</p><p>\u201cAngel!\u201d</p><p>The\ndoor sprang open before Crowley could reach for it. If he had bothered to look,\nhe would have seen the Bentley neatly park herself by the side of the road.\nCrowley\u2019s didn\u2019t notice, too happy to see his friend.</p><p>\u201cAngel!\nHey!\u201d </p><p>He\ncaught up to him, a grin already on his face. </p><p>Azirphale\nturned, startled. \u201cOh. Hu-hullo. My dear.\u201d</p><p>Crolwey\nslowed, taking him in. Something was wrong.</p><p>His\nhair was all stiff, some sort of gel trapping his curls from their usual fluffy\nabandon. Aziraphale wore a pale cream coat and dull grey trousers. It was\njarring to see him dressed so colourlessly. The angel sniffed, meeting his eyes\nguiltily.</p><p>\u201cYou\nlook\u2026\u201d The angel cringed, looking half embarrassed and half miserable and very\nmuch like he had been crying. Crowley felt his heart give a little lurch. <br></p><p>\u201cUncomfortable,\u201d\nsaid Crowley firmly. </p><p>Aziraphale\nblinked.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d\nCrowley ran a hand through the angel\u2019s hair, banishing the gel and freeing his\ncurls to their usual messy glory. He smoothed down Aziraphale\u2019s coat, and\nmiracled a green carnation, sticking the flower in his breast pocket.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d\nsaid Crowley definitely. \u201cMuch better.\u201d <br></p><p>Suddenly\nhe had his arms full of Aziraphale, the angel lurching forward and hugging him\ntightly. He felt his mouth go dry. Aziraphale was warm and soft against him. He\nslowly wrapped his own arms around him, resting his cheek on the angels\u2019 curls.\nAziraphale made a small sound and squeezed him tighter. Crowley rubbed his\nback.</p><p>\u201cHey.\nHey, it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>They\nbroke apart after a long few moments, Crowley trailing his hands down the\nangels\u2019 arms, strangely reluctant to let him go. Aziraphale\u2019s glasses were half\nfogged up, his face still a study in misery.</p><p>\u201cCome\non.\u201d Crowley kept a firm hold of Aziraphale\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nnodded gratefully and followed him over to the Bentley. They got inside,\nCrowley starting the car up again and merging back into traffic.</p><p>He\nshot a glance at his companion.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas still for long moment. </p><p><i>\u2018Look into my eyes and you\u2019ll see\n</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m the only one,\u2019 </i>sang Freddie Mercury.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d\nAziraphale sighed. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible angel, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s\nhands tightened on the wheel. \u201cYou\u2019re not the shining example of it.\u201d The angel\nslumped. \u201cBut angel, why would you <i>want</i>\nto be?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared at him.</p><p><i>\u2018You\u2019ve captured my love</i></p><p><i>Stolen my heart</i></p><p><i>Changed my life\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cThey\ndon\u2019t enjoy things,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cThey don\u2019t <i>want</i> to enjoy things. Perfect angels are terrifying. And the ones\nlike Gabriel are just smug, self-obsessed bastards.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cThe\npoint, the <i>point</i>,\u201d said Crowley,\nsuddenly determined to make him understand, \u201cIs that I don\u2019t want you to be\nperfect. And I\u2019m not saying this as a demon, I\u2019m saying it as your, your <i>friend</i>. I like you as you are. I don\u2019t\nwant you to be like them. <i>You </i>don\u2019t\nwant to be like them. They\u2019re dull, self-righteous pricks with no appreciation\nfor good take-out.\u201d </p><p>The\nangel gave a little laugh. He smiled at him, taking it as a good sign. </p><p>\u201cYou\nhave to decide for yourself what you want to be\u2014and not let anyone else tell\nyou what you are, or what you\u2019re supposed to be. Not even me!\u201d He shrugged a\nlittle self-consciously. \u201cDon\u2019t judge yourself by their standards. I\u2019ve\u2026always\nadmired how you\u2019ve kept to your own moral code.\u201d Crowley smiled. \u201cEven when you\ntry so hard to deny it. You can\u2019t let them decide who you should be.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018You take my breath away\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>Aziraphale\ntook Crowley\u2019s free hand in his own and squeezed it gently. Crowley turned his\nhand around and laced their fingers together, squeezing back.</p><p><i>\u2018You can reduce me to tears </i></p><p><i>With a single sigh</i></p><p><i>(Please don\u2019t cry anymore)</i></p><p><i>Every breath that you take </i></p><p><i>Every sound that you make</i></p><p><i>Is a whisper in my ear\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nvery glad you ran into me,\u201d said Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry\nto get all\u2014\u201d he hiccuped softly, \u201c\u2014all soppy on you. Goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nbe,\u201d said Crowley firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing our drunken nights in haven\u2019t seen\nbefore.\u201d</p><p>That\nwon him a watery laugh.</p><p><i>\u2018I could give up all my life</i></p><p><i>For just one kiss</i></p><p><i>I would surely die </i></p><p><i>If you dismiss me </i></p><p><i>From your love\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cThank\nyou for talking to me.\u201d Crowley glanced over at him. \u201cThat day. In the garden,\u201d said Aziraphale. \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed you to come up to me, Guardian of the Eastern Gate\nand all, and strike up conversation, but.\u201d He squeezed Crowley\u2019s hand again.\n\u201cI\u2019m so very glad you did.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018You take my breath away\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>Even\ncold-blooded beings blush. Crowley gave a pleased little shrug, the warmth from\nthe angel\u2019s hand in his own so unspeakably comforting.</p><p>\u201cYou\njust. Looked like a friend.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nlaughed again. \u201cSo did you. Funny little noodle that you were.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nmade a noise of mock outrage. \u201c<i>Noodle</i>.\u201d</p><p>He\nnodded. \u201cI like noodles. It\u2019s a compliment. You are very cute like that, you\nknow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute!\u201d\nCrowley felt ridiculously pleased by this. He tried to scowl. \u201cI\u2019m a serpent.\nI\u2019m <i>the</i> serpent. I have a fearsome\nreputation. Angels are terrified of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\ndear, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\nare! You ought to watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\nI\u2019m terribly frightened, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nthumb rubbed across the back of his hand, sending warm tingles all through his\nbody.</p><p>They\nreached the bookshop, Crowley pulling over and parking against the curve.</p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nthrew wine in a Throne\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlooked over at him. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\ncalled me a sorry excuse for an angel. And he wanted to ban chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\n<i>bastard.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nfeel bad about it now.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cIt was a terrible waste of good wine.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nsniggered, unable to keep the fond grin off his face. Aziraphale joined him,\ndissolving into giggles. </p><p>\u201cOh\nangel,\u201d managed Crowley. \u201cDon\u2019t ever change.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nleaned over and hugged him. Crowley hugged back, shutting his eyes and drinking\nin the warmth of his friend. </p><p><i>\u2018So please don\u2019t go</i></p><p><i>Don\u2019t leave me here all by myself</i></p><p><i>I get ever so lonely</i></p><p><i>From time to time\u2026.\u2019</i></p><p>They\npulled apart. Aziraphale patted Crowley\u2019s arm affectionately. \u201cThank you, my\ndear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nsee you soon, right?\u201d called Crowley as the angel climbed out of the car.</p><p>\u201cOh\nyes. As soon as this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo\nmore dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\ndecided how many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nSays on the new form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo\nmore days. Goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nsmiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nwatched him open the shop door and step inside, some strange feeling of longing\nwelling up inside of him. Aziraphale\u2019s warmth clung to him, safe and familiar.\nHe let out a long breath.</p><p><i>\u2018I will find you</i></p><p><i>Anywhere you go</i></p><p><i>Right until the ends of the earth</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ll get no sleep</i></p><p><i>Till I find you<br></i></p><p><i>To tell you when I\u2019ve found you</i></p><p><i>I love you\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>He\nchoked.</p><p>Then\nhe blinked.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>He\nslowly opened the glove compartment, taking out the quiz. <br></p><p>\u201cCome\non Adam,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMatch me with the one person in all of Heaven and Hell\nwho I want to be with.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nclosed the bookshop door behind him, relieved to be back in its familiar\ncomfort.</p><p>There\nwas a flash of light, and a booklet of pink papers materialized in front of\nhim. He caught the quiz with a sigh and scanned it.</p><p><i>Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if I got\nCrowley this time?</i></p><p>He\nsmiled. Then froze.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Several\nthings were occurring very fast to him, realizations made millennia ago\nclicking into place.</p><p>Very\nslowly he brought a hand to his face.</p><p><i>\u201cOh.\u201d</i></p><p>His\nknees wobbled. Aziraphale slid down against the door, hunched up in a little\nball on the floor. He felt very warm. Logically he knew he ought to be\nterrified or disgusted.</p><p>\n\nAziraphale\nthought of Crowley and felt the largest, soppiest smile come across his face. He\nhad come to a Realization.<br></p>",

They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days.

He had been there for some time, just outside of the large\npark he was supposed to meet his next date in. </p><p>Dumah\nwas another angel. He wanted to feel encouraged by that. The truth of it was\nCrowley that couldn\u2019t stand anyone who was cruel. He had come to grips with\nthis some time ago, and admitted that he was likely better off trying an angel\nthan a demon. </p><p>But\nwhat if this angel was like the last one? What if she thought he was beneath\nher and wanted him to ask for\u2013 he winced \u2013 <i>absolution?</i> As if he needed to be sanctified,\nnot because of the way he acted but on the simple grounds of him being a demon?\n</p><p>What\nif she didn\u2019t bother to see any of his good qualities? He didn\u2019t want to be\npitied or feared, and certainly not in the name of misplaced concern for his\nsoul!</p><p><i>\u2018Inside my heart is breaking</i></p><p><i>My makeup may be flaking</i></p><p><i>But my smile stays ooon.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nsighed Crowley, listening to Mussorgky\u2019s <i>Pictures\nat an Exhibition</i>.</p><p>Might\nas well get it over with.</p><p>If\nthis angel tried anything, he\u2019d give her the slip and be back in the Bentley\nbefore she could say \u2018superiority complex\u2019.</p><p>Maybe\nhe\u2019d call Aziraphale after. It had been such an unspeakable relief to hear his\nvoice again, to remember that there was someone who knew him for who he was and\n<i>liked</i> him for it.</p><p><i>\u2018The Show must go ooon.\u2019</i> <br></p><p>\u201cAll\nright, all right. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Xxx<i> <br></i></p><p>Aziraphale\nstood in front of the mirror. This wasn\u2019t something he did very often. After a\ngood few decades wearing a corporation, he rather fancied he knew what he\nlooked like. His clothing he tended to know just as well. It wasn\u2019t a lack of\nvanity on his part, per se. It was that he simply knew what clothes he enjoyed\nmatching together, and how he would look in them. There simply wasn\u2019t a need to\nspend much time looking at himself. <br></p><p>Today,\nas he readied himself for his next date, he wondered if he had been remiss in\nthat.</p><p>Aziraphale\nliked how he looked. He did, he really did. </p><p>His\nbody was comfortable and familiar, and he\u2019d been in this one long enough that it\nhad stopped feeling like a corporation and had started feeling like <i>himself</i>. He was rather fond of his\nfluffy curls and comfortable layer of fat around his middle.</p><p>But\u2026Wasco\nhad taken one look at him and laughed at his face. Admittedly, the little demon\nlikely wasn\u2019t the best judge, yet the more he thought on it the more it rattled\nhim.</p><p>He\nwasn\u2019t\u2026funny looking. Surely not?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbit his lip.</p><p>The\npassingly man-shaped being in the mirror wore a bright reddish brown coat with\na cheerful green tartan bow-tie. He stared. Maybe the coat was a little faded.\nHis trousers were a deep mustard yellow. They had seen better days too.</p><p>He\nfrowned. He\u2019d been planning to add a handkerchief. Something bright and paisley\npatterned for his breast pocket. It was what he usually did.</p><p>With\na sigh, he shrugged out of his coat. He looked at it miserably. </p><p>Aziraphale\nloved colours. He loved patterns and textures, and the thing about Heaven was\nthat it lacked just about all of it. Everything was severe whites and creams and the\nodd grey. Sometimes you got a pale brown. The best you could do was the metal\ntones, the golds and coppers and bronzes, though it was expected they were used\nsparingly. </p><p>But\nthen there had been earth and the garden bursting with more colours than he had\never seen, and Aziraphale had never looked back.</p><p>With\na sigh he pulled out a camel hair coat from his closet. It wasn\u2019t his favorite.\nIt was more of a sandy cream than a brown. </p><p>He\npulled it on. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>It\nwas snowing. Crowley knew because he was covered in a thin layer of it. He\u2019d\nfound a bench and had been waiting for some ten minutes now, watching as the\nworn wood slowly disappeared beneath a thin layer of fluff.</p><p>His\ndate was late.</p><p>Fifteen\nmore minutes of this and he was going get a coffee. Scratch that, make it a\nlarge, hot whiskey.</p><p>He\nblinked. </p><p>Very\nslowly he looked up.</p><p>A\nwhite deer stood silently in the snow, watching him with soft silvery eyes.</p><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d <br></p><p>The\ndeer blinked at him, slow and graceful.</p><p>\u201cDumah,\nright?\u201d guessed Crowley.</p><p><i>Yes.</i></p><p>The\ndeer\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t move, and the sound that came out was nothing any human\ncould hope to process, but Crowley understood. He crossed his legs.</p><p><i>\u201c</i>Not a fan of human language?\u201d <br></p><p><i>Sorry, no. I care for all fauna\non earth. It simply is not something I use.</i></p><p>\u201cAnimals.\nNeat.\u201d Crowley shifted closer to the edge of the bench.</p><p>Duamah\nglowed for a moment, then took the form of a large grey heron, long legs\nkeeping her far from the snow. The angel ran her beak through her feathers\nawkwardly.</p><p><i>I\u2026apologize. I am not comfortable\nwith human forms.</i></p><p>\u201cHey,\nno worries.\u201d Crowley smiled. \u201cI get days like that too.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh?</i></p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He\nstretched out his spine with a satisfying <i>pop</i>\nand slithered off the bench, wincing at the feel of the cold snow against his\nscales.</p><p>\u201cSsseee?\u201d</p><p>Dumah\nstartled, eyes widening in fear. She took a few hasty steps back her wings raised\ndefensively. </p><p>\u201cOh,\nhey. No. It\u2019ssssss all right.\u201d Crowley\u2019s heart sunk. He hadn\u2019t meant to scare\nher. </p><p><i>Aziraphale was </i>never<i> afraid of me, </i>came the sudden thought<i>.</i> <i>Not\neven at the beginning</i>*.</p><p>*The\nfirst moment Crowley and Aziraphale had locked eyes all those millennia ago,\nCrowley had been expecting to see fear or hatred or disgust\u2014that was what he\nhad gotten when he tried the North, West and South gates of Eden. The Guardian\nof the Eastern Gate, however, had made a little cooing sound, crouched right\ndown and promptly asked him what he was. Crowley had admitted, a little\nembarrassed, that he was a demon. Aziraphale had waved him off impatiently and\nsaid \u201cYes but what <i>are</i> you?\u201d There\nwas no animal half as extraordinary in the whole garden as whatever he was,\nAziraphale told him, eyes bright with delight and wonder, flaming sword lying\nforgotten against a nearby rock. Crowley had decided right there and then that\nthey would be friends**.</p><p> **He hadn\u2019t regretted it for a single day\nsince. </p><p>Crowley\nlaid himself down in the snow, exposing some of his belly. \u201cI won\u2019t bite.\nSsssnake\u2019ssss honour.\u201d<i></i></p><p><i>You are</i> The <i>Serpent, aren\u2019t you? </i>She asked.</p><p>\u201cMy\nname\u2019ssss Crowley. But yesssss.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cAren\u2019t you ssssupossssssed to\ncare for all animalsssss?\u201d</p><p><i>All except the serpent.</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ssss\na little harsssssh, don\u2019t you think? It wasssss <i>me</i> that causssssed the trouble. The ressst of them didn\u2019t have\nanything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Dumah\nlowered her feathers slowly. <i>No. You are\nright. It was wrong of me to make that assumption.</i></p><p>Crowley\nwished he had eyelids so he could blink at her. \u201cReally?\u201d </p><p>That\nwas it? No guilt tripping, no deflecting, no condemnations, just up and admitting\nto it?</p><p><i>Yes. </i></p><p>Crowley\u2019s\ntongue sucked back into his mouth. Dumah took a cautious step forward. </p><p><i>I will admit your form does set\nme on edge.</i></p><p>\u201cOh.\nSsssorry. I can sssswitch\u2014\u201c</p><p><i>No. No please, don\u2019t. It was kind\nof you to take my preferences into account. I wish you to stay as you are. It\nwill be good for me to get over my fear.</i></p><p>\u201cEr\u2026right.\nLet me know if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p><i>Of course.</i></p><p>Crowley\nslithered closer, wishing it wasn\u2019t such a cold day and he didn\u2019t have snow\nnearly up to his eyeballs. Dumah watched him closely. When he was close enough she\nhesitantly lent down. Her beak gently brushed against Crowley\u2019s scales.</p><p>\u201cSsssee?\nNo biting from me,\u201d said Crowley helpfully.</p><p><i>No</i>, agreed Dumah slowly. </p><p>\u201cDid\nyou want to get sssssssomething to eat?\u201d asked Crowley. \u201cThere\u2019ssssss thissss great\nlittle bakery nearby where\u2014erm. Hmm. Right. Animal form.\u201d</p><p><i>Perhaps not.</i></p><p>\u201cWe\ncould figure it out. It\u2019ssss amazzzzzing what people won\u2019t noticccce if you\ngive them a bit of a nudge.\u201d And now that he\u2019d brought it up he really was\ncraving some of those excellent apple dumplings. His mouth started to water\njust at the thought.</p><p><i>If you don\u2019t mind, I would rather\nnot.</i></p><p>\u201cMnh?\nYou ssssure? It ssshouldn\u2019t be much trouble.\u201d</p><p>She\nducked her head.<i> Thank you, no. I\u2019m\nafraid I am not very fond of humans.</i></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p><i>You must think of it from my\nposition. Animals are my charges, yet everything in Heaven and Hell is designed\nfor humans. It is\u2026difficult to not feel frustrated towards them when they do so\nmuch harm to my own.</i></p><p>\u201cSssssupossssse\nthat checkssss out. They\u2019re not all bad though. Humansssss.\u201d</p><p><i>No. Maybe not. But enough are</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nmissssssing out on an awful lot you know,\u201d he tried.</p><p><i>I think I will survive.</i></p><p>He\nshrugged as best he could without shoulders. \u201cAll right then.\u201d</p><p>Dumah\nshifted again, changing into a large white rabbit with the same silvery eyes.\nHer ears drooped.</p><p><i>I am sorry for being difficult.</i></p><p>\u201cNah,\nit\u2019ssss all right. I wouldn\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>The\nrabbit cocked her head. <i>You are very kind.</i></p><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d\nCrowley ducked his head. \u201cThanksssss. Don\u2019t let it get around.\u201d</p><p><i>Wouldn\u2019t dream of it. </i>He got the feeling she\nwas smiling at him. <i>Would you like to\nexplore the park? I do not usually come so far into the city.</i></p><p>Crowley\nsmiled. \u201cSsssssure! Been a while sssssinccccce I\u2019ve last been out in thissss\nssssskin.\u201d</p><p>Maybe\nthey could accidentally stumble across some humans. It would make a fun bit of\nfuss. Dumah would at least appreciate him scaring them a little.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cThe\nearth is a fascinating place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nyes. Yes I certainly think so,\u201d agreed Aziraphale.</p><p>This\ndate was going better than the others. Chayyliel was a Throne who had spent\nsome time on earth. He\u2019d been spending the better part of an hour telling\nAziraphale about his latest missions and thwartings and the trouble he\u2019d had\ndown on earth while they sat in one of London\u2019s fancier restaurants. </p><p>Chayyliel\nreally was an engaging speaker. Aziraphale could simply eat his meal and drink\nhis wine and nod and gasp at the right places, and leave the rest to the other\nangel. No having to fumble around struggling to keep the conversation going\ntoday. </p><p>Of\ncourse, it wasn\u2019t exactly a conversation. More of a monologue, really. But at\nleast there were none of those dreadful silences.</p><p>\u201cHumans\nneed so much guidance,\u201d said Chayyliel, handsome in a sharp, clean kind of way,\nwith his neat blond hair and immaculate grey suit. \u201cI\u2019ve almost grown fond of\nthem, in a sense. They need a firm hand lest they turn to paths of sin.\u201d He\ntook a measured sip of his mineral water. \u201cOnce mustn\u2019t go soft. So long as\nsouls are saved one must do what they can. It\u2019s in their best interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d\nAziraphale took a sip of his wine. It turned into a gulp, and he vaguely wished\nit would hurry up and affect him more.</p><p>\u201cThings\nare always more difficult around this time of year with\u2014what do they call it,\nValentine\u2019s Day? \u00a0Of course, chocolate\nhas to go. It simply can\u2019t be allowed.\u201d <br></p><p>Aziraphale\nput down his glass a bit more heavily than he meant to. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit rash,\nisn\u2019t it?\u201d he managed. \u201cSurely chocolate has caused much more good than bad. The\ntaste could only be described as divine, after all. They <i>do</i> call it the food of the gods for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo\nthey?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nnodded. \u201cI\u2019ve always considered it a compliment.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p> Chayyliel eyed him across the table, finishing\nhis forkful of salad with measured, neat bites. His gaze dragged over Aziraphale\u2019s\ndecade old coat and the rounded shape of his belly beneath it, settling on his\nnear empty glass of wine and plate of honey glazed chicken. He finished chewing\nand neatly put down his cutlery. He steepled his hands. </p><p>\u201cYou\nsee, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s the small things that cannot be tolerated.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cA\nminor indulgence may seem harmless at first. But one leads to many, and soon\nthey spread like a plague. With such allowances, even the most promising souls\nare corrupted by sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nchocolate, really? Have you ever tried it? It\u2019s done so much more good than\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cOne\nmust be firm in their affirmations. And hold <i>themselves</i> to the highest standard.\u201d He gave Aziraphale a sharp\nlook. \u201cHow else are we to lead from example?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nmade a noise in the back of his throat. \u201cNo, I think you\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHumans are so incredibly skilled at finding balance. They\u2019re endlessly\ncomplex. And sometimes it\u2019s the little indulgences that give them the strength\nto resist more dangerous sins. It\u2019s not all so very cut and dry. Er, for the\nmost part, of course,\u201d he corrected himself. \u201cWhy, even things they do while\nmeaning to be bad can have resoundingly good effects, and vise a versa. Not to\nsay wanting to do bad is <i>good</i>, but it\nsimply isn\u2019t as black and white as all that. There\u2019s context for one. It\u2019s\nineffable.\u201d He felt rather pleased with himself and reached for his glass of\nwine.</p><p>Chayyliel\nwas not impressed. He hadn\u2019t moved in all of Aziraphale\u2019s little impassioned\nspeech, and now there was something very hard in his eyes as he looked across\nthe table. </p><p>\u201cIneffable?\nI believe we may have a different understanding of its meaning.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared at him, suddenly feeling very cold. \u201cYes, I think we do.\u201d</p><p>He\ndid not like this conversation. For one, Aziraphale was quickly doubting it was\na conversation any more, and had rapidly become something of an Argument. Not\nthe type he and Crowley liked to have, where they snipped at each other and\nexchanged ideas and metaphors playfully, and there was no real menace and no\none really kept score*.</p><p>*Score\nwas kept for the express purposes of teasing the other at some future date. It\nwas awfully fun. </p><p>This\nfelt different. This felt more like a Disagreement.</p><p>In\nfact, Aziraphale felt a bit like he did during those unfortunate times he was\nforced to be in Gabriel\u2019s presence, like he was some particularly unpleasant\nweed being sized up by a disgusted gardener with sheers.</p><p>Chayyliel\npatted his mouth with his napkin and set it down neatly on the table. \u201cLook,\nAziraphale. It\u2019s clear you need help.\u201d</p><p>He\nblinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\na sorry excuse for an angel. An embarrassment really.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nspluttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nlet yourself go. It\u2019s shameful. That\u2019s no way to represent Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\n<i>beg</i> your pardon?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot all bad. You\u2019re almost likeable,\u201d said Chayyliel in a way he clearly\nthought was charitable \u201cThere\u2019s still some hope. If we go Up now I\u2019m sure they\ncan get you sorted. You\u2019ll have to undergo some mortification, but suffering is\ngood for the soul, after all. You certainly could use some.\u201d</p><p>In\nall of his millennium on earth, Aziraphale had never thrown his drink in\nsomeone\u2019s face. He\u2019d secretly fantasized about doing it the odd time or two. It\nhad such flair! What an effective was to shut someone down, to end a\nconversation! But of course, being an angel, this activity was strictly\nrestricted to his imagination*.</p><p>*Plus,\nhe hated to waste good food or drink.</p><p>As\nAziraphale pushed back his chair and stormed out of the restaurant, he was\npleased to note that throwing his wine in someone\u2019s face\u2019s was <i>exactly</i> as rewarding as he imagined it\nmight be.</p><p>xxx</p><p>It\nwas rush hour.</p><p>Crowley\nwas in a good enough mood that he didn\u2019t bother to get around it, and was happy\nenough to inch along with the other drivers on the busy London roads. He\u2019d\nturned the Bentley\u2019s heat up on full blast, warmth slow to return to his limbs\nafter spending the better part of two hours slithering around in the snow. </p><p>The\ndate had gone all right. Dumah was gentle and considerate and it had been fun\nto spend time as a serpent. Cold, but fun. He could see Dumah as a sort of\nfriend, maybe. But she hadn\u2019t liked humans and didn\u2019t want to have anything to\ndo with them or what they made. That was a bit of a deal breaker.</p><p>Besides,\nCrowley needed someone who was a bit more\u2026fiery. <i>Sassy</i>, he thought with a grin. Flamboyant. Maybe even a little\nfussy. He liked people who were so sure of themselves and what they liked and\nwhat they did. Mind you, they had to be somewhat open minded, or at least happy\nto have a good argument about it over drinks.</p><p>Without\nany warning the Bentley lurched to a screeching halt.</p><p>A seat-belt manifested at the last second and saved Crowley from crashing headlong\ninto the dashboard</p><p>\u201cHey!\nWhat gives?\u201d</p><p>Horns\nand angry shouting erupted behind him. They hadn\u2019t hit anyone. He put his foot\ndown on the pedal. The Bentley would not budge.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong?\u201d he asked her. The Bentely\u2019s horn started honking loudly. \u201cAre you angry\nat me? Did I\u2014<i>Hhnng!\u201c</i></p><p>The\ncar jerked towards the pavement, knocking his gaze up from the dashboard. His\neyes landed on a familiar figure walking a few yards away.</p><p>\u201cAngel!\u201d</p><p>The\ndoor sprang open before Crowley could reach for it. If he had bothered to look,\nhe would have seen the Bentley neatly park herself by the side of the road.\nCrowley\u2019s didn\u2019t notice, too happy to see his friend.</p><p>\u201cAngel!\nHey!\u201d </p><p>He\ncaught up to him, a grin already on his face. </p><p>Azirphale\nturned, startled. \u201cOh. Hu-hullo. My dear.\u201d</p><p>Crolwey\nslowed, taking him in. Something was wrong.</p><p>His\nhair was all stiff, some sort of gel trapping his curls from their usual fluffy\nabandon. Aziraphale wore a pale cream coat and dull grey trousers. It was\njarring to see him dressed so colourlessly. The angel sniffed, meeting his eyes\nguiltily.</p><p>\u201cYou\nlook\u2026\u201d The angel cringed, looking half embarrassed and half miserable and very\nmuch like he had been crying. Crowley felt his heart give a little lurch. <br></p><p>\u201cUncomfortable,\u201d\nsaid Crowley firmly. </p><p>Aziraphale\nblinked.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d\nCrowley ran a hand through the angel\u2019s hair, banishing the gel and freeing his\ncurls to their usual messy glory. He smoothed down Aziraphale\u2019s coat, and\nmiracled a green carnation, sticking the flower in his breast pocket.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d\nsaid Crowley definitely. \u201cMuch better.\u201d <br></p><p>Suddenly\nhe had his arms full of Aziraphale, the angel lurching forward and hugging him\ntightly. He felt his mouth go dry. Aziraphale was warm and soft against him. He\nslowly wrapped his own arms around him, resting his cheek on the angels\u2019 curls.\nAziraphale made a small sound and squeezed him tighter. Crowley rubbed his\nback.</p><p>\u201cHey.\nHey, it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>They\nbroke apart after a long few moments, Crowley trailing his hands down the\nangels\u2019 arms, strangely reluctant to let him go. Aziraphale\u2019s glasses were half\nfogged up, his face still a study in misery.</p><p>\u201cCome\non.\u201d Crowley kept a firm hold of Aziraphale\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nnodded gratefully and followed him over to the Bentley. They got inside,\nCrowley starting the car up again and merging back into traffic.</p><p>He\nshot a glance at his companion.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas still for long moment. </p><p><i>\u2018Look into my eyes and you\u2019ll see\n</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m the only one,\u2019 </i>sang Freddie Mercury.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d\nAziraphale sighed. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible angel, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s\nhands tightened on the wheel. \u201cYou\u2019re not the shining example of it.\u201d The angel\nslumped. \u201cBut angel, why would you <i>want</i>\nto be?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared at him.</p><p><i>\u2018You\u2019ve captured my love</i></p><p><i>Stolen my heart</i></p><p><i>Changed my life\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cThey\ndon\u2019t enjoy things,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cThey don\u2019t <i>want</i> to enjoy things. Perfect angels are terrifying. And the ones\nlike Gabriel are just smug, self-obsessed bastards.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cThe\npoint, the <i>point</i>,\u201d said Crowley,\nsuddenly determined to make him understand, \u201cIs that I don\u2019t want you to be\nperfect. And I\u2019m not saying this as a demon, I\u2019m saying it as your, your <i>friend</i>. I like you as you are. I don\u2019t\nwant you to be like them. <i>You </i>don\u2019t\nwant to be like them. They\u2019re dull, self-righteous pricks with no appreciation\nfor good take-out.\u201d </p><p>The\nangel gave a little laugh. He smiled at him, taking it as a good sign. </p><p>\u201cYou\nhave to decide for yourself what you want to be\u2014and not let anyone else tell\nyou what you are, or what you\u2019re supposed to be. Not even me!\u201d He shrugged a\nlittle self-consciously. \u201cDon\u2019t judge yourself by their standards. I\u2019ve\u2026always\nadmired how you\u2019ve kept to your own moral code.\u201d Crowley smiled. \u201cEven when you\ntry so hard to deny it. You can\u2019t let them decide who you should be.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018You take my breath away\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>Aziraphale\ntook Crowley\u2019s free hand in his own and squeezed it gently. Crowley turned his\nhand around and laced their fingers together, squeezing back.</p><p><i>\u2018You can reduce me to tears </i></p><p><i>With a single sigh</i></p><p><i>(Please don\u2019t cry anymore)</i></p><p><i>Every breath that you take </i></p><p><i>Every sound that you make</i></p><p><i>Is a whisper in my ear\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nvery glad you ran into me,\u201d said Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry\nto get all\u2014\u201d he hiccuped softly, \u201c\u2014all soppy on you. Goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nbe,\u201d said Crowley firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing our drunken nights in haven\u2019t seen\nbefore.\u201d</p><p>That\nwon him a watery laugh.</p><p><i>\u2018I could give up all my life</i></p><p><i>For just one kiss</i></p><p><i>I would surely die </i></p><p><i>If you dismiss me </i></p><p><i>From your love\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cThank\nyou for talking to me.\u201d Crowley glanced over at him. \u201cThat day. In the garden,\u201d said Aziraphale. \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed you to come up to me, Guardian of the Eastern Gate\nand all, and strike up conversation, but.\u201d He squeezed Crowley\u2019s hand again.\n\u201cI\u2019m so very glad you did.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018You take my breath away\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>Even\ncold-blooded beings blush. Crowley gave a pleased little shrug, the warmth from\nthe angel\u2019s hand in his own so unspeakably comforting.</p><p>\u201cYou\njust. Looked like a friend.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nlaughed again. \u201cSo did you. Funny little noodle that you were.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nmade a noise of mock outrage. \u201c<i>Noodle</i>.\u201d</p><p>He\nnodded. \u201cI like noodles. It\u2019s a compliment. You are very cute like that, you\nknow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute!\u201d\nCrowley felt ridiculously pleased by this. He tried to scowl. \u201cI\u2019m a serpent.\nI\u2019m <i>the</i> serpent. I have a fearsome\nreputation. Angels are terrified of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\ndear, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\nare! You ought to watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\nI\u2019m terribly frightened, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nthumb rubbed across the back of his hand, sending warm tingles all through his\nbody.</p><p>They\nreached the bookshop, Crowley pulling over and parking against the curve.</p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nthrew wine in a Throne\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlooked over at him. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\ncalled me a sorry excuse for an angel. And he wanted to ban chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\n<i>bastard.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nfeel bad about it now.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cIt was a terrible waste of good wine.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nsniggered, unable to keep the fond grin off his face. Aziraphale joined him,\ndissolving into giggles. </p><p>\u201cOh\nangel,\u201d managed Crowley. \u201cDon\u2019t ever change.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nleaned over and hugged him. Crowley hugged back, shutting his eyes and drinking\nin the warmth of his friend. </p><p><i>\u2018So please don\u2019t go</i></p><p><i>Don\u2019t leave me here all by myself</i></p><p><i>I get ever so lonely</i></p><p><i>From time to time\u2026.\u2019</i></p><p>They\npulled apart. Aziraphale patted Crowley\u2019s arm affectionately. \u201cThank you, my\ndear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nsee you soon, right?\u201d called Crowley as the angel climbed out of the car.</p><p>\u201cOh\nyes. As soon as this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo\nmore dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\ndecided how many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nSays on the new form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo\nmore days. Goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nsmiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nwatched him open the shop door and step inside, some strange feeling of longing\nwelling up inside of him. Aziraphale\u2019s warmth clung to him, safe and familiar.\nHe let out a long breath.</p><p><i>\u2018I will find you</i></p><p><i>Anywhere you go</i></p><p><i>Right until the ends of the earth</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ll get no sleep</i></p><p><i>Till I find you<br></i></p><p><i>To tell you when I\u2019ve found you</i></p><p><i>I love you\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>He\nchoked.</p><p>Then\nhe blinked.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>He\nslowly opened the glove compartment, taking out the quiz. <br></p><p>\u201cCome\non Adam,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMatch me with the one person in all of Heaven and Hell\nwho I want to be with.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nclosed the bookshop door behind him, relieved to be back in its familiar\ncomfort.</p><p>There\nwas a flash of light, and a booklet of pink papers materialized in front of\nhim. He caught the quiz with a sigh and scanned it.</p><p><i>Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if I got\nCrowley this time?</i></p><p>He\nsmiled. Then froze.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Several\nthings were occurring very fast to him, realizations made millennia ago\nclicking into place.</p><p>Very\nslowly he brought a hand to his face.</p><p><i>\u201cOh.\u201d</i></p><p>His\nknees wobbled. Aziraphale slid down against the door, hunched up in a little\nball on the floor. He felt very warm.

After a\ngood few decades wearing a corporation, he rather fancied he knew what he\nlooked like. His clothing he tended to know just as well. It wasn&rsquo;t a lack of\nvanity on his part, per se. It was that he simply knew what clothes he enjoyed\nmatching together, and how he would look in them. There simply wasn&rsquo;t a need to\nspend much time looking at himself. <br /></p><p>Today,\nas he readied himself for his next date, he wondered if he had been remiss in\nthat.</p><p>Aziraphale\nliked how he looked. He did, he really did. </p><p>His\nbody was comfortable and familiar, and he&rsquo;d been in this one long enough that it\nhad stopped feeling like a corporation and had started feeling like <i>himself</i>. He was rather fond of his\nfluffy curls and comfortable layer of fat around his middle.</p><p>But&hellip;Wasco\nhad taken one look at him and laughed at his face. Admittedly, the little demon\nlikely wasn&rsquo;t the best judge, yet the more he thought on it the more it rattled\nhim.</p><p>He\nwasn&rsquo;t&hellip;funny looking. Surely not?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbit his lip.</p><p>The\npassingly man-shaped being in the mirror wore a bright reddish brown coat with\na cheerful green tartan bow-tie. He stared. Maybe the coat was a little faded.\nHis trousers were a deep mustard yellow. They had seen better days too.</p><p>He\nfrowned. He&rsquo;d been planning to add a handkerchief. Something bright and paisley\npatterned for his breast pocket. It was what he usually did.</p><p>With\na sigh, he shrugged out of his coat. He looked at it miserably. </p><p>Aziraphale\nloved colours. He loved patterns and textures, and the thing about Heaven was\nthat it lacked just about all of it. Everything was severe whites and creams and the\nodd grey. Sometimes you got a pale brown. The best you could do was the metal\ntones, the golds and coppers and bronzes, though it was expected they were used\nsparingly. </p><p>But\nthen there had been earth and the garden bursting with more colours than he had\never seen, and Aziraphale had never looked back.</p><p>With\na sigh he pulled out a camel hair coat from his closet. It wasn&rsquo;t his favorite.\nIt was more of a sandy cream than a brown. </p><p>He\npulled it on. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>It\nwas snowing. Crowley knew because he was covered in a thin layer of it. He&rsquo;d\nfound a bench and had been waiting for some ten minutes now, watching as the\nworn wood slowly disappeared beneath a thin layer of fluff.</p><p>His\ndate was late.</p><p>Fifteen\nmore minutes of this and he was going get a coffee.

It simply is not something I use.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Animals.\nNeat.&rdquo; Crowley shifted closer to the edge of the bench.</p><p>Duamah\nglowed for a moment, then took the form of a large grey heron, long legs\nkeeping her far from the snow. The angel ran her beak through her feathers\nawkwardly.</p><p><i>I&hellip;apologize. I am not comfortable\nwith human forms.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nno worries.&rdquo; Crowley smiled. &ldquo;I get days like that too.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nstretched out his spine with a satisfying <i>pop</i>\nand slithered off the bench, wincing at the feel of the cold snow against his\nscales.</p><p>&ldquo;Ssseee?&rdquo;</p><p>Dumah\nstartled, eyes widening in fear. She took a few hasty steps back her wings raised\ndefensively. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nhey. No. It&rsquo;ssssss all right.&rdquo; Crowley&rsquo;s heart sunk. He hadn&rsquo;t meant to scare\nher. </p><p><i>Aziraphale was </i>never<i> afraid of me, </i>came the sudden thought<i>.</i> <i>Not\neven at the beginning</i>*.</p><p>*The\nfirst moment Crowley and Aziraphale had locked eyes all those millennia ago,\nCrowley had been expecting to see fear or hatred or disgust&mdash;that was what he\nhad gotten when he tried the North, West and South gates of Eden. The Guardian\nof the Eastern Gate, however, had made a little cooing sound, crouched right\ndown and promptly asked him what he was. Crowley had admitted, a little\nembarrassed, that he was a demon. Aziraphale had waved him off impatiently and\nsaid &ldquo;Yes but what <i>are</i> you?&rdquo; There\nwas no animal half as extraordinary in the whole garden as whatever he was,\nAziraphale told him, eyes bright with delight and wonder, flaming sword lying\nforgotten against a nearby rock. Crowley had decided right there and then that\nthey would be friends**.</p><p> **He hadn&rsquo;t regretted it for a single day\nsince. </p><p>Crowley\nlaid himself down in the snow, exposing some of his belly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bite.\nSsssnake&rsquo;ssss honour.&rdquo;<i></i></p><p><i>You are</i> The <i>Serpent, aren&rsquo;t you? </i>She asked.</p><p>&ldquo;My\nname&rsquo;ssss Crowley. But yesssss.&rdquo; He sniffed. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ssssupossssssed to\ncare for all animalsssss?&rdquo;</p><p><i>All except the serpent.</i></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ssss\na little harsssssh, don&rsquo;t you think? It wasssss <i>me</i> that causssssed the trouble. The ressst of them didn&rsquo;t have\nanything to do with it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dumah\nlowered her feathers slowly. <i>No. You are\nright. It was wrong of me to make that assumption.</i></p><p>Crowley\nwished he had eyelids so he could blink at her. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; </p><p>That\nwas it? No guilt tripping, no deflecting, no condemnations, just up and admitting\nto it?</p><p><i>Yes. </i></p><p>Crowley&rsquo;s\ntongue sucked back into his mouth. Dumah took a cautious step forward. </p><p><i>I will admit your form does set\nme on edge.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh.\nSsssorry. I can sssswitch&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p><i>No. No please, don&rsquo;t. It was kind\nof you to take my preferences into account. I wish you to stay as you are. It\nwill be good for me to get over my fear.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Er&hellip;right.\nLet me know if you change your mind.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Of course.</i></p><p>Crowley\nslithered closer, wishing it wasn&rsquo;t such a cold day and he didn&rsquo;t have snow\nnearly up to his eyeballs. Dumah watched him closely. When he was close enough she\nhesitantly lent down. Her beak gently brushed against Crowley&rsquo;s scales.</p><p>&ldquo;Ssssee?\nNo biting from me,&rdquo; said Crowley helpfully.</p><p><i>No</i>, agreed Dumah slowly. </p><p>&ldquo;Did\nyou want to get sssssssomething to eat?&rdquo; asked Crowley. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ssssss thissss great\nlittle bakery nearby where&mdash;erm. Hmm. Right. Animal form.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Perhaps not.</i></p><p>&ldquo;We\ncould figure it out. It&rsquo;ssss amazzzzzing what people won&rsquo;t noticccce if you\ngive them a bit of a nudge.&rdquo; And now that he&rsquo;d brought it up he really was\ncraving some of those excellent apple dumplings. His mouth started to water\njust at the thought.</p><p><i>If you don&rsquo;t mind, I would rather\nnot.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Mnh?\nYou ssssure? It ssshouldn&rsquo;t be much trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>She\nducked her head.<i> Thank you, no. I&rsquo;m\nafraid I am not very fond of humans.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p><i>You must think of it from my\nposition. Animals are my charges, yet everything in Heaven and Hell is designed\nfor humans. It is&hellip;difficult to not feel frustrated towards them when they do so\nmuch harm to my own.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Sssssupossssse\nthat checkssss out. They&rsquo;re not all bad though. Humansssss.&rdquo;</p><p><i>No. Maybe not. But enough are</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nmissssssing out on an awful lot you know,&rdquo; he tried.</p><p><i>I think I will survive.</i></p><p>He\nshrugged as best he could without shoulders. &ldquo;All right then.&rdquo;</p><p>Dumah\nshifted again, changing into a large white rabbit with the same silvery eyes.\nHer ears drooped.</p><p><i>I am sorry for being difficult.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Nah,\nit&rsquo;ssss all right. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to make you uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nrabbit cocked her head. <i>You are very kind.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Er&hellip;&rdquo;\nCrowley ducked his head. &ldquo;Thanksssss. Don&rsquo;t let it get around.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Wouldn&rsquo;t dream of it. </i>He got the feeling she\nwas smiling at him. <i>Would you like to\nexplore the park? I do not usually come so far into the city.</i></p><p>Crowley\nsmiled. &ldquo;Ssssssure! Been a while sssssinccccce I&rsquo;ve last been out in thissss\nssssskin.&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe\nthey could accidentally stumble across some humans. It would make a fun bit of\nfuss. Dumah would at least appreciate him scaring them a little.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;The\nearth is a fascinating place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nyes. Yes I certainly think so,&rdquo; agreed Aziraphale.</p><p>This\ndate was going better than the others. Chayyliel was a Throne who had spent\nsome time on earth. He&rsquo;d been spending the better part of an hour telling\nAziraphale about his latest missions and thwartings and the trouble he&rsquo;d had\ndown on earth while they sat in one of London&rsquo;s fancier restaurants. </p><p>Chayyliel\nreally was an engaging speaker. Aziraphale could simply eat his meal and drink\nhis wine and nod and gasp at the right places, and leave the rest to the other\nangel. No having to fumble around struggling to keep the conversation going\ntoday. </p><p>Of\ncourse, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a conversation. More of a monologue, really. But at\nleast there were none of those dreadful silences.</p><p>&ldquo;Humans\nneed so much guidance,&rdquo; said Chayyliel, handsome in a sharp, clean kind of way,\nwith his neat blond hair and immaculate grey suit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve almost grown fond of\nthem, in a sense. They need a firm hand lest they turn to paths of sin.&rdquo; He\ntook a measured sip of his mineral water. &ldquo;Once mustn&rsquo;t go soft. So long as\nsouls are saved one must do what they can. It&rsquo;s in their best interests.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;\nAziraphale took a sip of his wine. It turned into a gulp, and he vaguely wished\nit would hurry up and affect him more.</p><p>&ldquo;Things\nare always more difficult around this time of year with&mdash;what do they call it,\nValentine&rsquo;s Day? &nbsp;Of course, chocolate\nhas to go. It simply can&rsquo;t be allowed.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Aziraphale\nput down his glass a bit more heavily than he meant to. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit rash,\nisn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he managed. &ldquo;Surely chocolate has caused much more good than bad. The\ntaste could only be described as divine, after all. They <i>do</i> call it the food of the gods for a reason.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do\nthey?&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nnodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always considered it a compliment.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p><p> Chayyliel eyed him across the table, finishing\nhis forkful of salad with measured, neat bites. His gaze dragged over Aziraphale&rsquo;s\ndecade old coat and the rounded shape of his belly beneath it, settling on his\nnear empty glass of wine and plate of honey glazed chicken. He finished chewing\nand neatly put down his cutlery. He steepled his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;You\nsee, I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s the small things that cannot be tolerated.&rdquo; He sniffed. &ldquo;A\nminor indulgence may seem harmless at first. But one leads to many, and soon\nthey spread like a plague. With such allowances, even the most promising souls\nare corrupted by sin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But\nchocolate, really? Have you ever tried it? It&rsquo;s done so much more good than&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One\nmust be firm in their affirmations. And hold <i>themselves</i> to the highest standard.&rdquo; He gave Aziraphale a sharp\nlook. &ldquo;How else are we to lead from example?&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nmade a noise in the back of his throat. &ldquo;No, I think you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; he said.\n&ldquo;Humans are so incredibly skilled at finding balance. They&rsquo;re endlessly\ncomplex. And sometimes it&rsquo;s the little indulgences that give them the strength\nto resist more dangerous sins. It&rsquo;s not all so very cut and dry. Er, for the\nmost part, of course,&rdquo; he corrected himself. &ldquo;Why, even things they do while\nmeaning to be bad can have resoundingly good effects, and vise a versa. Not to\nsay wanting to do bad is <i>good</i>, but it\nsimply isn&rsquo;t as black and white as all that. There&rsquo;s context for one. It&rsquo;s\nineffable.&rdquo; He felt rather pleased with himself and reached for his glass of\nwine.</p><p>Chayyliel\nwas not impressed. He hadn&rsquo;t moved in all of Aziraphale&rsquo;s little impassioned\nspeech, and now there was something very hard in his eyes as he looked across\nthe table. </p><p>&ldquo;Ineffable?\nI believe we may have a different understanding of its meaning.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared at him, suddenly feeling very cold. &ldquo;Yes, I think we do.&rdquo;</p><p>He\ndid not like this conversation. For one, Aziraphale was quickly doubting it was\na conversation any more, and had rapidly become something of an Argument. Not\nthe type he and Crowley liked to have, where they snipped at each other and\nexchanged ideas and metaphors playfully, and there was no real menace and no\none really kept score*.</p><p>*Score\nwas kept for the express purposes of teasing the other at some future date. It\nwas awfully fun. </p><p>This\nfelt different. This felt more like a Disagreement.</p><p>In\nfact, Aziraphale felt a bit like he did during those unfortunate times he was\nforced to be in Gabriel&rsquo;s presence, like he was some particularly unpleasant\nweed being sized up by a disgusted gardener with sheers.</p><p>Chayyliel\npatted his mouth with his napkin and set it down neatly on the table. &ldquo;Look,\nAziraphale. It&rsquo;s clear you need help.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nblinked. &ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\na sorry excuse for an angel. An embarrassment really.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nspluttered.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\nlet yourself go. It&rsquo;s shameful. That&rsquo;s no way to represent Heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I\n<i>beg</i> your pardon?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nnot all bad. You&rsquo;re almost likeable,&rdquo; said Chayyliel in a way he clearly\nthought was charitable &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still some hope. If we go Up now I&rsquo;m sure they\ncan get you sorted. You&rsquo;ll have to undergo some mortification, but suffering is\ngood for the soul, after all. You certainly could use some.&rdquo;</p><p>In\nall of his millennium on earth, Aziraphale had never thrown his drink in\nsomeone&rsquo;s face. He&rsquo;d secretly fantasized about doing it the odd time or two. It\nhad such flair! What an effective was to shut someone down, to end a\nconversation! But of course, being an angel, this activity was strictly\nrestricted to his imagination*.</p><p>*Plus,\nhe hated to waste good food or drink.</p><p>As\nAziraphale pushed back his chair and stormed out of the restaurant, he was\npleased to note that throwing his wine in someone&rsquo;s face&rsquo;s was <i>exactly</i> as rewarding as he imagined it\nmight be.</p><p>xxx</p><p>It\nwas rush hour.</p><p>Crowley\nwas in a good enough mood that he didn&rsquo;t bother to get around it, and was happy\nenough to inch along with the other drivers on the busy London roads. He&rsquo;d\nturned the Bentley&rsquo;s heat up on full blast, warmth slow to return to his limbs\nafter spending the better part of two hours slithering around in the snow. </p><p>The\ndate had gone all right. Dumah was gentle and considerate and it had been fun\nto spend time as a serpent. Cold, but fun. He could see Dumah as a sort of\nfriend, maybe. But she hadn&rsquo;t liked humans and didn&rsquo;t want to have anything to\ndo with them or what they made. That was a bit of a deal breaker.</p><p>Besides,\nCrowley needed someone who was a bit more&hellip;fiery. <i>Sassy</i>, he thought with a grin. Flamboyant. Maybe even a little\nfussy. He liked people who were so sure of themselves and what they liked and\nwhat they did. Mind you, they had to be somewhat open minded, or at least happy\nto have a good argument about it over drinks.</p><p>Without\nany warning the Bentley lurched to a screeching halt.</p><p>A seat-belt manifested at the last second and saved Crowley from crashing headlong\ninto the dashboard</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!\nWhat gives?&rdquo;</p><p>Horns\nand angry shouting erupted behind him. They hadn&rsquo;t hit anyone. He put his foot\ndown on the pedal. The Bentley would not budge.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nwrong?&rdquo; he asked her. The Bentely&rsquo;s horn started honking loudly. &ldquo;Are you angry\nat me? Did I&mdash;<i>Hhnng!&ldquo;</i></p><p>The\ncar jerked towards the pavement, knocking his gaze up from the dashboard. His\neyes landed on a familiar figure walking a few yards away.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel!&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndoor sprang open before Crowley could reach for it. If he had bothered to look,\nhe would have seen the Bentley neatly park herself by the side of the road.\nCrowley&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t notice, too happy to see his friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel!\nHey!&rdquo; </p><p>He\ncaught up to him, a grin already on his face. </p><p>Azirphale\nturned, startled. &ldquo;Oh. Hu-hullo. My dear.&rdquo;</p><p>Crolwey\nslowed, taking him in. Something was wrong.</p><p>His\nhair was all stiff, some sort of gel trapping his curls from their usual fluffy\nabandon. Aziraphale wore a pale cream coat and dull grey trousers. It was\njarring to see him dressed so colourlessly. The angel sniffed, meeting his eyes\nguiltily.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nlook&hellip;&rdquo; The angel cringed, looking half embarrassed and half miserable and very\nmuch like he had been crying. Crowley felt his heart give a little lurch. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uncomfortable,&rdquo;\nsaid Crowley firmly. </p><p>Aziraphale\nblinked.</p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;\nCrowley ran a hand through the angel&rsquo;s hair, banishing the gel and freeing his\ncurls to their usual messy glory. He smoothed down Aziraphale&rsquo;s coat, and\nmiracled a green carnation, sticking the flower in his breast pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo;\nsaid Crowley definitely. &ldquo;Much better.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Suddenly\nhe had his arms full of Aziraphale, the angel lurching forward and hugging him\ntightly. He felt his mouth go dry. Aziraphale was warm and soft against him. He\nslowly wrapped his own arms around him, resting his cheek on the angels&rsquo; curls.\nAziraphale made a small sound and squeezed him tighter. Crowley rubbed his\nback.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.\nHey, it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p><p>They\nbroke apart after a long few moments, Crowley trailing his hands down the\nangels&rsquo; arms, strangely reluctant to let him go. Aziraphale&rsquo;s glasses were half\nfogged up, his face still a study in misery.</p><p>&ldquo;Come\non.&rdquo; Crowley kept a firm hold of Aziraphale&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive you.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nnodded gratefully and followed him over to the Bentley. They got inside,\nCrowley starting the car up again and merging back into traffic.</p><p>He\nshot a glance at his companion.</p><p>&ldquo;Do\nyou want to talk about it?&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas still for long moment. </p><p><i>&lsquo;Look into my eyes and you&rsquo;ll see\n</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m the only one,&rsquo; </i>sang Freddie Mercury.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo;\nAziraphale sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a terrible angel, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley&rsquo;s\nhands tightened on the wheel. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the shining example of it.&rdquo; The angel\nslumped. &ldquo;But angel, why would you <i>want</i>\nto be?&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared at him.</p><p><i>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve captured my love</i></p><p><i>Stolen my heart</i></p><p><i>Changed my life&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;They\ndon&rsquo;t enjoy things,&rdquo; said Crowley. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to enjoy things. Perfect angels are terrifying. And the ones\nlike Gabriel are just smug, self-obsessed bastards.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale hiccuped.</p><p>&ldquo;The\npoint, the <i>point</i>,&rdquo; said Crowley,\nsuddenly determined to make him understand, &ldquo;Is that I don&rsquo;t want you to be\nperfect. And I&rsquo;m not saying this as a demon, I&rsquo;m saying it as your, your <i>friend</i>. I like you as you are. I don&rsquo;t\nwant you to be like them. <i>You </i>don&rsquo;t\nwant to be like them. They&rsquo;re dull, self-righteous pricks with no appreciation\nfor good take-out.&rdquo; </p><p>The\nangel gave a little laugh. He smiled at him, taking it as a good sign. </p><p>&ldquo;You\nhave to decide for yourself what you want to be&mdash;and not let anyone else tell\nyou what you are, or what you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Not even me!&rdquo; He shrugged a\nlittle self-consciously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge yourself by their standards. I&rsquo;ve&hellip;always\nadmired how you&rsquo;ve kept to your own moral code.&rdquo; Crowley smiled. &ldquo;Even when you\ntry so hard to deny it. You can&rsquo;t let them decide who you should be.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&lsquo;You take my breath away&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>Aziraphale\ntook Crowley&rsquo;s free hand in his own and squeezed it gently. Crowley turned his\nhand around and laced their fingers together, squeezing back.</p><p><i>&lsquo;You can reduce me to tears </i></p><p><i>With a single sigh</i></p><p><i>(Please don&rsquo;t cry anymore)</i></p><p><i>Every breath that you take </i></p><p><i>Every sound that you make</i></p><p><i>Is a whisper in my ear&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nvery glad you ran into me,&rdquo; said Aziraphale.</p><p>&ldquo;Me\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry\nto get all&mdash;&rdquo; he hiccuped softly, &ldquo;&mdash;all soppy on you. Goodness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nbe,&rdquo; said Crowley firmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing our drunken nights in haven&rsquo;t seen\nbefore.&rdquo;</p><p>That\nwon him a watery laugh.</p><p><i>&lsquo;I could give up all my life</i></p><p><i>For just one kiss</i></p><p><i>I would surely die </i></p><p><i>If you dismiss me </i></p><p><i>From your love&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Thank\nyou for talking to me.&rdquo; Crowley glanced over at him. &ldquo;That day. In the garden,&rdquo; said Aziraphale. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what possessed you to come up to me, Guardian of the Eastern Gate\nand all, and strike up conversation, but.&rdquo; He squeezed Crowley&rsquo;s hand again.\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so very glad you did.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&lsquo;You take my breath away&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>Even\ncold-blooded beings blush. Crowley gave a pleased little shrug, the warmth from\nthe angel&rsquo;s hand in his own so unspeakably comforting.</p><p>&ldquo;You\njust. Looked like a friend.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nlaughed again. &ldquo;So did you. Funny little noodle that you were.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nmade a noise of mock outrage. &ldquo;<i>Noodle</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nnodded. &ldquo;I like noodles. It&rsquo;s a compliment. You are very cute like that, you\nknow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cute!&rdquo;\nCrowley felt ridiculously pleased by this. He tried to scowl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a serpent.\nI&rsquo;m <i>the</i> serpent. I have a fearsome\nreputation. Angels are terrified of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\ndear, really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They\nare! You ought to watch it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm.\nI&rsquo;m terribly frightened, my dear.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nthumb rubbed across the back of his hand, sending warm tingles all through his\nbody.</p><p>They\nreached the bookshop, Crowley pulling over and parking against the curve.</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nthrew wine in a Throne&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nlooked over at him. &ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He\ncalled me a sorry excuse for an angel. And he wanted to ban chocolate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The\n<i>bastard.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nfeel bad about it now.&rdquo; He sniffed. &ldquo;It was a terrible waste of good wine.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nsniggered, unable to keep the fond grin off his face. Aziraphale joined him,\ndissolving into giggles. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nangel,&rdquo; managed Crowley. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever change.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nleaned over and hugged him. Crowley hugged back, shutting his eyes and drinking\nin the warmth of his friend. </p><p><i>&lsquo;So please don&rsquo;t go</i></p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t leave me here all by myself</i></p><p><i>I get ever so lonely</i></p><p><i>From time to time&hellip;.&rsquo;</i></p><p>They\npulled apart. Aziraphale patted Crowley&rsquo;s arm affectionately. &ldquo;Thank you, my\ndear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nsee you soon, right?&rdquo; called Crowley as the angel climbed out of the car.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nyes. As soon as this is over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two\nmore dates.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s\ndecided how many?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.\nSays on the new form.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two\nmore days. Goodness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nsmiled at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nwatched him open the shop door and step inside, some strange feeling of longing\nwelling up inside of him. Aziraphale&rsquo;s warmth clung to him, safe and familiar.\nHe let out a long breath.</p><p><i>&lsquo;I will find you</i></p><p><i>Anywhere you go</i></p><p><i>Right until the ends of the earth</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;ll get no sleep</i></p><p><i>Till I find you<br /></i></p><p><i>To tell you when I&rsquo;ve found you</i></p><p><i>I love you&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>He\nchoked.</p><p>Then\nhe blinked.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>He\nslowly opened the glove compartment, taking out the quiz. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come\non Adam,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Match me with the one person in all of Heaven and Hell\nwho I want to be with.&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nclosed the bookshop door behind him, relieved to be back in its familiar\ncomfort.</p><p>There\nwas a flash of light, and a booklet of pink papers materialized in front of\nhim. He caught the quiz with a sigh and scanned it.</p><p><i>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if I got\nCrowley this time?</i></p><p>He\nsmiled. Then froze.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Several\nthings were occurring very fast to him, realizations made millennia ago\nclicking into place.</p><p>Very\nslowly he brought a hand to his face.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</i></p><p>His\nknees wobbled. Aziraphale slid down against the door, hunched up in a little\nball on the floor. He felt very warm. Logically he knew he ought to be\nterrified or disgusted.</p><p>\n\nAziraphale\nthought of Crowley and felt the largest, soppiest smile come across his face. He\nhad come to a Realization.<br /></p>",

I try to be equal opportunity with my roasts. I may make fun of hardcore stans at some point. If you are a stan and get mad at me, I will probably reblog to laugh at you.
