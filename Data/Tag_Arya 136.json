        "body": "<p>And now for my favourite character. What is going to happen to Arya in Season 8 of Game of Thrones. I have already gone through some of this with my Jon post but here is a more in depth breakdown of our favourite Assassin (except Zevran).</p><p>Episode 1.</p><p>I think before the big intro with Dany and Jon arriving in Winterfell there will be an establishing scene of Arya and some of the people in Winter town - you know so when most of them die we feel bad. There has been some talk that in this season she has a meaningful scene with a child so potentially she is teaching the kids how to fight. As Tyrion was also not at the original meeting of Robert B and Ned in Season 1 as he was in Winter town he might also be show up there as well.</p><p>Now that she and Sansa have buried the hatchet (in Littlefingers head) there will be a scene with them and Bran where they discuss Jon, what he did and the ramifications of it. Possibly this is where Bran tells Sansa and Arya about Jon&rsquo;s parents which would lead into the next episode.</p><p>This will likely also be where she has her reunions with the Hound and Gendry and honestly it&rsquo;s a coin toss how she will react to either of them.</p><p>Episode 2. </p><p>As I mentioned on Jon&rsquo;s post I believe Arya will be the one to talk him out of his funk. They have a short amount of time and tying the reunion scene together with Jon recovering from his BSOD kills two birds with one stone.</p><p>There will be a scene with everyone preparing for the inevitable attack and at some point Dany and Arya with have a conversation and Arya will not hold back with Dany as she isn&rsquo;t politically minded like Sansa. She will be testing her to she how she reacts. I also think once it comes out that Sam&rsquo;s father and brother were killed she will be very cautious of her as she could see this as an abuse of authority which we all know Arya is not a fan of.</p><p>Episode 3.</p><p>Arya will likely have some real time to shine here because if she doesn&rsquo;t kill at\u00a0least one\u00a0White Walker I would be very surprised. I think they will likely be caught slightly unaware by the attack and she will go out to try and save the people of the town she gets some of them out but looks like she is swarmed but Wights and potentially we think she is going to die. There are two ways I see this going - the first is the wolf pack arrives and saves her (I will call it now if they show up and she gets circled like Dany has been and Jon as well then I am guaranteed right about the ending of the series). The second way it could go is she actually does die and Beric uses his last life to save her as a call back to Lady Stoneheart though if this happens the wolf pack will just have to show up later but there is no way they can tease an army of wolves last season and not use them.</p><p>As I said last time they win but the Night King tricked them and has gone further South.</p><p>Episode 4.</p><p>Jon goes to Kingslanding to strenuous objections from everyone and he gives a bit of sass back especially to Arya if she did go to Winter Town to save everyone. He immediately gets caught and Arya goes with the Hound to save him and have some sweet revenge on the side while they are there. Jaime might go with them. Remember from Season\u00a0one Arya actually knows some secret ways into the Red Keep and with her faces she will likely be able to get in quite easily. Obviously since Jon will have flown down on Rhaegal they will use Varys&rsquo; teleportation skills to get there quickly. Cleganebowl happens but likely Cersei lives until at least the next episode.</p><p>Episode 5 and 6.</p><p>They all get together and talk about their feelings and realise the Nights King isn't\u00a0such a bad guy - he just need a hug. Or there is a huge battle and a bunch of people kill each other. It could go either way. Arya will probably kill another White Walker and loads of people will die. After as they argue over politics she has the slow dawning horror of realisation that they are asking her to shag her cousin who she thought was her brother. They do it for political stability but after a few years - maybe once Jon and Dany are both dead many years later she leaves with the Hound her true Bromantic love interest and they finally go out in search of what is West of Westeros. </p><p>That might be a little bit too happy of an ending but she is my favourite so allow me the hope of her riding into the sunset at least.</p>",
