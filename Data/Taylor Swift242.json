        "body": "<p>Taylor closed the front door and took her jacket off, Joe doing the same thing.<br/>\nAs they both bent down to take their shoes off, Taylor said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to my brother\u2019s room to see if I can find you something for you to change into.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll be fine like this\u201d Joe told her. He didn\u2019t want to give her any trouble.<br/>\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll get you some clothes, come on\u201d she insisted, straightening up and starting walking towards Austin\u2019s room. She wasn\u2019t about to have him dressed in outside clothes if they were just going to sit on the couch, especially when she had perfectly comfortable clothes he could wear.<br/>\nTaylor opened the door and they both got in. She walked towards the dresser and opened the first drawer.<br/>\n\u201cOkay, loads of t-shirts, which one do you want?\u201d She asked him, turning her head to see him walking in her direction.<br/>\n\u201cWhichever is fine, I don\u2019t mind\u201d Joe said, ending up choosing a grey one.<br/>\n\u201cOkay, now, let\u2019s see\u201d Taylor mumbled while closing the first drawer and opening a couple more. \u201cAha!\u201d She exclaimed. \u201cSweatpants okay?\u201d she asked Joe.<br/>\n\u201cYeah, perfect\u201d he smiled at her while grabbing the first pair on the drawer.<br/>\n\u201cJust unfold them and have a look, I think they\u2019ll fit\u201d Taylor said while closing the drawer.<br/>\nHe did as she suggested and nodded once while saying \u201cyeah, they look like they\u2019ll fit, don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cOkay, get changed and I\u2019ll meet you in the living room in a couple of minutes\u201d she smiled at him while leaving the room and closing the door.<br/>\nOnce she got to her room she noticed the cats were still lounging on her bed. \u201cHi guys, we have a guest, be ni-\u201c she stopped herself thinking about the word \u2018guest\u2019 and ended up rolling her eyes. \u201cGigi was right about this after all, damn her\u201d she whispered and ended up chuckling at the irony. It was fine, she still had plenty of cookies, certainly enough for the both of them. She should ask him if he wanted some.<br/>\nShe went to grab the pyjamas she had on earlier but stopped herself. Should she put on something nicer? But that wouldn\u2019t make sense, she just gave him freaking sweatpants for fuck\u2019s sake. Her brother\u2019s sweatpants. Ugh. What to do\u2026 she went to the drawer where she kept her sleeping clothes, opened it and stared. Definitely nothing with lace. Or silk. But she wanted a nightie.<br/>\nSuddenly she remembered she had a new one somewhere, it was grey cotton, it looked a bit like an oversized t-shirt, definitely comfortable looking, definitely not too obvious, but the hemline didn\u2019t even hit her mid tight. She\u2019d go with that.<br/>\nOnce she had it on she pulled her hair up in a ponytail and walked to the living room.<br/>\nJoe was already sitting on the couch, Meredith on his left side while he rubbed her tummy and Olivia on his right side while he tickled in between her ears.\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cWhy do my cats like you better than me?\u201d Taylor asked, pretending to sound outraged.\u00a0<br/>\nJoe looked over at her and smirked. \u201cThey sense my pure soul\u201d he answered, trying not to laugh.<br/>\nTaylor scoffed. \u201cYeah, right. Do you want something to drink? Also, before I forget, I have chocolate chip cookies I baked earlier today if you want some.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWell, I was going to ask for some wine but since you have cookies I\u2019ll go with some milk, please.\u201d<br/>\nTaylor laughed, \u201cYou can still have wine even if you want the cookies\u201d she told him.<br/>\n\u201cWell, I guess, but cookies with milk is the perfect combination\u201d Joe argued.<br/>\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re not wrong\u201d Taylor started walking in the direction of the kitchen. \u201cJust wait a second and I\u2019ll bring you some. Could you turn on the TV, please? I had started season two but I was a couple of episodes in so maybe we should start the beginning?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYeah, sounds good\u201d he reassured, picking up the remote as Taylor went into the kitchen.<br/>\nWhen she returned with a plate of cookies and a glass of milk, Meredith and Olivia were no where in sight and Joe had season two of \u2018Friends\u2019 ready to play.<br/>\n\u201cJesus, those look so good, I think I might drool a bit\u201d Joe told her while looking at the cookies.<br/>\nTaylor laughed then. \u201cDon\u2019t judge till you actually taste them, they might be terrible\u201d she joked.<br/>\n\u201cHm I see your point, but it\u2019s very unlikely\u201d he told her as he grabbed the glass and plate from her and put them on the table in front of the couch. \u201cEverything you make is bloody brilliant\u201d he finished, and Taylor could feel her cheeks warming up at that.<br/>\n\u2018Ugh, I hate him\u2019 she thought. \u2018How the hell am I supposed not to like him when he\u2019s like this.\u2019<br/>\n\u201cThank you\u201d Taylor mumbled as she sat down next to him on the couch, folding her left leg underneath herself. She picked up the remote and hit \u2018play\u2019.<br/>\nJoe got a cookie from the plate and took a bite, closing his eyes instantly and moaning. Taylor gave a very deep breath while chanting in her head \u2018the world hates me, the world hates me, the world hates me\u2019.<br/>\n\u201cNot wanting to be that person but\u201d Joe started as he put the rest of the cookies in his mouth, \u201cI totally told you so. Bloody brilliant\u201d he complemented as he kept chewing.<br/>\nTaylor cleared her throat. \u201cGlad you like them\u201d she said. \u2018I need to do something about this\u2019 Taylor thought, \u2018so, I like him. And I need to figure out a way to tell him. Because this is torture. He\u2019s right here. But not as much as he could be. Ugh, why did I ever tell him I just wanted to be friends. Idiot. How do I tell him\u2026 What if he\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t want a relationship right now. I never really asked if-\u2018<br/>\n\u201cTaylor?\u201d She turned her head to her left to look up at him.<br/>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked, her eyes open wide.<br/>\n\u201cI asked if you didn\u2019t want a cookie\u201d he told her, looking at her weird. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d <br/>\n\u2018Perfect, you can tell him now\u2019 she thought. \u201cI\u2026 am great\u201d she smiled at him, \u201cwas just a bit distracted\u201d she continued, taking the cookie he was holding out for her.<br/>\nHe hummed and turned his head back to the TV. Taylor sighed and started chewing on the cookie, thinking some other time would have to do.<br/>\nAround an hour and a half later, Taylor was cuddled on Joe\u2019s side, her right leg across his lap, his right arm around her, his hand gently massaging her scalp, her hair tie long gone, his other hand half holding her hip.<br/>\n\u201cIs this weird\u201d Taylor murmured only loud enough for him to hear.<br/>\nShe could feel him moving his neck a bit so his cheek was on top of her head.<br/>\n\u201cWhat is weird?\u201d He murmured back, his fingers still doing that back and forth motion in between strands of her hair, making her want to sigh in contentment.<br/>\n\u201cWe\u2019re cuddling\u201d she said, adjusting herself so she was now straddling his lap, resting her cheek on his chest in a way that she couldn\u2019t even watch the TV anymore.<br/>\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird\u201d Joe said, adjusting his arms so he could rub a hand up and down her back and bring the other one back to her hair.<br/>\nTaylor hummed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it though\u2026\u201d Taylor mumbled again. Her eyes felt heavy. <br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s only weird if we let it be weird, I think\u201d she could feel him kissing the top of her head. Or at least she thought so\u2026<br/>\nTaylor opened her eyes because she felt cold. She was lying down in her bed, alone. Her bedroom door wasn\u2019t closed all the way through and she could see light coming from it. She sat up in bed. She could hear footsteps outside in the corridor so she got up.<br/>\nJoe was halfway down the stairs when he heard a groggy \u201cwhere are you going?\u201d<br/>\nHe stoped and looked back, Taylor was at the top of the staircase looking half asleep and not completely happy, if he was going to be honest.<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d he said. \u201cI tried really hard not to wake you up. I didn\u2019t want you to wake up hurting tomorrow from sleeping in the couch all night.\u201d<br/>\nTaylor frowned her eyes. \u201cOkay. Where are you going?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure if there was a very obvious reason he seemed to be leaving and she just couldn\u2019t think about it because she was basically sleeping while standing.<br/>\n\u201cI was going to leave\u201d he said, slowly.<br/>\nTaylor stared for a few seconds. \u201cBut why?\u201d She asked him.<br/>\nHe seemed a bit uncertain. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t sure if you wanted me to stay.\u201d<br/>\nShe looked a bit annoyed then. \u201cOf course I want you to stay\u201d she mumbled, grumpily. \u201cI\u2019m cold, come to bed\u201d she practically ordered, turning around and starting to walk back to her room. He gave an incredulous chuckle and started going up the stairs again.<br/>\nWhen he got inside her room he closed the door, noticing she was already buried in the covers on the left side of the bed, her eyes and forehead peaking from underneath, making sure he was coming. He walked around the bed to get to his side and pulled the sheets, starting to climb inside.<br/>\n\u201cWhat are you doing\u201d he heard her ask, and stopped to look at her.<br/>\n\u201cLying down\u201d he said slowly, unsure again. <br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping in my bed with me with my brother\u2019s clothes on\u201d she told him, and he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. <br/>\n\u201cYes, Miss\u201d he grinned at her and straightened up again, taking the t-shirt off and stripping off the sweats. \u201cBetter?\u201d Joe asked her.<br/>\n\u201cYes\u201d Taylor told him. \u201cHurry up, I\u2019m cold.\u201d<br/>\nHe chuckled again, finally lying down next to her.<br/>\n\u201cJesus, you\u2019re freezing\u201d he told her when she cuddled up next to him. <br/>\n\u201cYour fault, left me alone on the bed\u201d she mumbled, breathing in the scent from his neck. <br/>\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t stay here for even a minute though\u201d he said incredulously while pulling her even closer to him.<br/>\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m still cold. And sleepy. Shut up.\u201d <br/>\nJoe grinned and bent down a bit to kiss her forehead. \u201cSleep tight, have the best dreams\u201d he murmured.<br/>\nHe could feel her moving her head away from his neck and looked down to find her staring up at him. Her eyes were puffy from sleep, but she looked beautiful nonetheless.<br/>\n\u201cKiss?\u201d He heard her ask, seeming a bit unsure of herself.<br/>\n\u201cAll the kisses\u201d he smiled at her, running his hand up from her back, through her shoulder, towards her neck and resting it on her face, tilting it up enough so that he could kiss her on the mouth. He rested his lips on hers for a few seconds and then pecked her once, twice, three times. <br/>\n\u201cNunight, love.\u201d Joe said with his lips still touching hers. He kissed her cheek and she cuddled back into his neck, his hand moving back to her lower back where he rubbed soothing circles.<br/>\nWhatever this was, it was growing, and Joe thought maybe it was time they properly talked about it. But for tonight he was going to enjoy his share of cuddles.<br/>\n-<br/>\n(Ok, this is it! Not sure if anyone is interested in why I wrote it like I wrote it but when I hear \u2018Delicate\u2019, and I feel that is what most people think too, is that \u201clong nights with your hands up in my hair, echoes of your footsteps on the stairs, stay here honey I don\u2019t wanna share\u201d implies some kind of sexual encounter, so I wanted to try and write it without that just to mess around with the possibilities a bit, taking some advantage of the duality of words you know :) also the nightie is in one of Taylor\u2019s rep magazine photos, there\u2019s a photo of her hugging her knees looking at her left side into the camera wearing an oversized grey t-shirt (something tells me that was not her t-shirt lmao). Hope you enjoyed it, and hopefully I\u2019ll feel inspired to write some other things soon)\u00a0</p>",

Her eyes were puffy from sleep, but she looked beautiful nonetheless.<br>\n\u201cKiss?\u201d He heard her ask, seeming a bit unsure of herself.<br>\n\u201cAll the kisses\u201d he smiled at her, running his hand up from her back, through her shoulder, towards her neck and resting it on her face, tilting it up enough so that he could kiss her on the mouth. He rested his lips on hers for a few seconds and then pecked her once, twice, three times. <br>\n\u201cNunight, love.\u201d Joe said with his lips still touching hers. He kissed her cheek and she cuddled back into his neck, his hand moving back to her lower back where he rubbed soothing circles.<br>\nWhatever this was, it was growing, and Joe thought maybe it was time they properly talked about it. But for tonight he was going to enjoy his share of cuddles.<br>\n-<br>\n(Ok, this is it! Not sure if anyone is interested in why I wrote it like I wrote it but when I hear \u2018Delicate\u2019, and I feel that is what most people think too, is that \u201clong nights with your hands up in my hair, echoes of your footsteps on the stairs, stay here honey I don\u2019t wanna share\u201d implies some kind of sexual encounter, so I wanted to try and write it without that just to mess around with the possibilities a bit, taking some advantage of the duality of words you know :) also the nightie is in one of Taylor\u2019s rep magazine photos, there\u2019s a photo of her hugging her knees looking at her left side into the camera wearing an oversized grey t-shirt (something tells me that was not her t-shirt lmao).

He didn\u2019t want to give her any trouble.<br>\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll get you some clothes, come on\u201d she insisted, straightening up and starting walking towards Austin\u2019s room. She wasn\u2019t about to have him dressed in outside clothes if they were just going to sit on the couch, especially when she had perfectly comfortable clothes he could wear.<br>\nTaylor opened the door and they both got in. She walked towards the dresser and opened the first drawer.<br>\n\u201cOkay, loads of t-shirts, which one do you want?\u201d She asked him, turning her head to see him walking in her direction.<br>\n\u201cWhichever is fine, I don\u2019t mind\u201d Joe said, ending up choosing a grey one.<br>\n\u201cOkay, now, let\u2019s see\u201d Taylor mumbled while closing the first drawer and opening a couple more. \u201cAha!\u201d She exclaimed. \u201cSweatpants okay?\u201d she asked Joe.<br>\n\u201cYeah, perfect\u201d he smiled at her while grabbing the first pair on the drawer.<br>\n\u201cJust unfold them and have a look, I think they\u2019ll fit\u201d Taylor said while closing the drawer.<br>\nHe did as she suggested and nodded once while saying \u201cyeah, they look like they\u2019ll fit, don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\n\u201cOkay, get changed and I\u2019ll meet you in the living room in a couple of minutes\u201d she smiled at him while leaving the room and closing the door.<br>\nOnce she got to her room she noticed the cats were still lounging on her bed. \u201cHi guys, we have a guest, be ni-\u201c she stopped herself thinking about the word \u2018guest\u2019 and ended up rolling her eyes. \u201cGigi was right about this after all, damn her\u201d she whispered and ended up chuckling at the irony. It was fine, she still had plenty of cookies, certainly enough for the both of them. She should ask him if he wanted some.<br>\nShe went to grab the pyjamas she had on earlier but stopped herself. Should she put on something nicer? But that wouldn\u2019t make sense, she just gave him freaking sweatpants for fuck\u2019s sake. Her brother\u2019s sweatpants. Ugh. What to do\u2026 she went to the drawer where she kept her sleeping clothes, opened it and stared. Definitely nothing with lace. Or silk. But she wanted a nightie.<br>\nSuddenly she remembered she had a new one somewhere, it was grey cotton, it looked a bit like an oversized t-shirt, definitely comfortable looking, definitely not too obvious, but the hemline didn\u2019t even hit her mid tight. She\u2019d go with that.<br>\nOnce she had it on she pulled her hair up in a ponytail and walked to the living room.<br>\nJoe was already sitting on the couch, Meredith on his left side while he rubbed her tummy and Olivia on his right side while he tickled in between her ears.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cWhy do my cats like you better than me?\u201d Taylor asked, pretending to sound outraged.\u00a0<br>\nJoe looked over at her and smirked. \u201cThey sense my pure soul\u201d he answered, trying not to laugh.<br>\nTaylor scoffed. \u201cYeah, right. Do you want something to drink? Also, before I forget, I have chocolate chip cookies I baked earlier today if you want some.\u201d<br>\n\u201cWell, I was going to ask for some wine but since you have cookies I\u2019ll go with some milk, please.\u201d<br>\nTaylor laughed, \u201cYou can still have wine even if you want the cookies\u201d she told him.<br>\n\u201cWell, I guess, but cookies with milk is the perfect combination\u201d Joe argued.<br>\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re not wrong\u201d Taylor started walking in the direction of the kitchen. \u201cJust wait a second and I\u2019ll bring you some. Could you turn on the TV, please? I had started season two but I was a couple of episodes in so maybe we should start the beginning?\u201d<br>\n\u201cYeah, sounds good\u201d he reassured, picking up the remote as Taylor went into the kitchen.<br>\nWhen she returned with a plate of cookies and a glass of milk, Meredith and Olivia were no where in sight and Joe had season two of \u2018Friends\u2019 ready to play.<br>\n\u201cJesus, those look so good, I think I might drool a bit\u201d Joe told her while looking at the cookies.<br>\nTaylor laughed then. \u201cDon\u2019t judge till you actually taste them, they might be terrible\u201d she joked.<br>\n\u201cHm I see your point, but it\u2019s very unlikely\u201d he told her as he grabbed the glass and plate from her and put them on the table in front of the couch. \u201cEverything you make is bloody brilliant\u201d he finished, and Taylor could feel her cheeks warming up at that.<br>\n\u2018Ugh, I hate him\u2019 she thought. \u2018How the hell am I supposed not to like him when he\u2019s like this.\u2019<br>\n\u201cThank you\u201d Taylor mumbled as she sat down next to him on the couch, folding her left leg underneath herself. She picked up the remote and hit \u2018play\u2019.<br>\nJoe got a cookie from the plate and took a bite, closing his eyes instantly and moaning. Taylor gave a very deep breath while chanting in her head \u2018the world hates me, the world hates me, the world hates me\u2019.<br>\n\u201cNot wanting to be that person but\u201d Joe started as he put the rest of the cookies in his mouth, \u201cI totally told you so. Bloody brilliant\u201d he complemented as he kept chewing.<br>\nTaylor cleared her throat. \u201cGlad you like them\u201d she said. \u2018I need to do something about this\u2019 Taylor thought, \u2018so, I like him. And I need to figure out a way to tell him. Because this is torture. He\u2019s right here. But not as much as he could be. Ugh, why did I ever tell him I just wanted to be friends. Idiot. How do I tell him\u2026 What if he\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t want a relationship right now. I never really asked if-\u2018<br>\n\u201cTaylor?\u201d She turned her head to her left to look up at him.<br>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked, her eyes open wide.<br>\n\u201cI asked if you didn\u2019t want a cookie\u201d he told her, looking at her weird. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d <br>\n\u2018Perfect, you can tell him now\u2019 she thought. \u201cI\u2026 am great\u201d she smiled at him, \u201cwas just a bit distracted\u201d she continued, taking the cookie he was holding out for her.<br>\nHe hummed and turned his head back to the TV. Taylor sighed and started chewing on the cookie, thinking some other time would have to do.<br>\nAround an hour and a half later, Taylor was cuddled on Joe\u2019s side, her right leg across his lap, his right arm around her, his hand gently massaging her scalp, her hair tie long gone, his other hand half holding her hip.<br>\n\u201cIs this weird\u201d Taylor murmured only loud enough for him to hear.<br>\nShe could feel him moving his neck a bit so his cheek was on top of her head.<br>\n\u201cWhat is weird?\u201d He murmured back, his fingers still doing that back and forth motion in between strands of her hair, making her want to sigh in contentment.<br>\n\u201cWe\u2019re cuddling\u201d she said, adjusting herself so she was now straddling his lap, resting her cheek on his chest in a way that she couldn\u2019t even watch the TV anymore.<br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird\u201d Joe said, adjusting his arms so he could rub a hand up and down her back and bring the other one back to her hair.<br>\nTaylor hummed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it though\u2026\u201d Taylor mumbled again. Her eyes felt heavy. <br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s only weird if we let it be weird, I think\u201d she could feel him kissing the top of her head. Or at least she thought so\u2026<br>\nTaylor opened her eyes because she felt cold. She was lying down in her bed, alone. Her bedroom door wasn\u2019t closed all the way through and she could see light coming from it. She sat up in bed. She could hear footsteps outside in the corridor so she got up.<br>\nJoe was halfway down the stairs when he heard a groggy \u201cwhere are you going?\u201d<br>\nHe stoped and looked back, Taylor was at the top of the staircase looking half asleep and not completely happy, if he was going to be honest.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d he said. \u201cI tried really hard not to wake you up. I didn\u2019t want you to wake up hurting tomorrow from sleeping in the couch all night.\u201d<br>\nTaylor frowned her eyes. \u201cOkay. Where are you going?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure if there was a very obvious reason he seemed to be leaving and she just couldn\u2019t think about it because she was basically sleeping while standing.<br>\n\u201cI was going to leave\u201d he said, slowly.<br>\nTaylor stared for a few seconds. \u201cBut why?\u201d She asked him.<br>\nHe seemed a bit uncertain. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t sure if you wanted me to stay.\u201d<br>\nShe looked a bit annoyed then. \u201cOf course I want you to stay\u201d she mumbled, grumpily. \u201cI\u2019m cold, come to bed\u201d she practically ordered, turning around and starting to walk back to her room. He gave an incredulous chuckle and started going up the stairs again.<br>\nWhen he got inside her room he closed the door, noticing she was already buried in the covers on the left side of the bed, her eyes and forehead peaking from underneath, making sure he was coming. He walked around the bed to get to his side and pulled the sheets, starting to climb inside.<br>\n\u201cWhat are you doing\u201d he heard her ask, and stopped to look at her.<br>\n\u201cLying down\u201d he said slowly, unsure again. <br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping in my bed with me with my brother\u2019s clothes on\u201d she told him, and he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. <br>\n\u201cYes, Miss\u201d he grinned at her and straightened up again, taking the t-shirt off and stripping off the sweats. \u201cBetter?\u201d Joe asked her.<br>\n\u201cYes\u201d Taylor told him. \u201cHurry up, I\u2019m cold.\u201d<br>\nHe chuckled again, finally lying down next to her.<br>\n\u201cJesus, you\u2019re freezing\u201d he told her when she cuddled up next to him. <br>\n\u201cYour fault, left me alone on the bed\u201d she mumbled, breathing in the scent from his neck. <br>\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t stay here for even a minute though\u201d he said incredulously while pulling her even closer to him.<br>\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m still cold. And sleepy. Shut up.\u201d <br>\nJoe grinned and bent down a bit to kiss her forehead. \u201cSleep tight, have the best dreams\u201d he murmured.<br>\nHe could feel her moving her head away from his neck and looked down to find her staring up at him. Her eyes were puffy from sleep, but she looked beautiful nonetheless.<br>\n\u201cKiss?\u201d He heard her ask, seeming a bit unsure of herself.<br>\n\u201cAll the kisses\u201d he smiled at her, running his hand up from her back, through her shoulder, towards her neck and resting it on her face, tilting it up enough so that he could kiss her on the mouth.

She could hear footsteps outside in the corridor so she got up.<br />\nJoe was halfway down the stairs when he heard a groggy &ldquo;where are you going?&rdquo;<br />\nHe stoped and looked back, Taylor was at the top of the staircase looking half asleep and not completely happy, if he was going to be honest.<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I tried really hard not to wake you up. I didn&rsquo;t want you to wake up hurting tomorrow from sleeping in the couch all night.&rdquo;<br />\nTaylor frowned her eyes. &ldquo;Okay. Where are you going?&rdquo; She wasn&rsquo;t sure if there was a very obvious reason he seemed to be leaving and she just couldn&rsquo;t think about it because she was basically sleeping while standing.<br />\n&ldquo;I was going to leave&rdquo; he said, slowly.<br />\nTaylor stared for a few seconds. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; She asked him.<br />\nHe seemed a bit uncertain. &ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if you wanted me to stay.&rdquo;<br />\nShe looked a bit annoyed then. &ldquo;Of course I want you to stay&rdquo; she mumbled, grumpily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold, come to bed&rdquo; she practically ordered, turning around and starting to walk back to her room. He gave an incredulous chuckle and started going up the stairs again.<br />\nWhen he got inside her room he closed the door, noticing she was already buried in the covers on the left side of the bed, her eyes and forehead peaking from underneath, making sure he was coming. He walked around the bed to get to his side and pulled the sheets, starting to climb inside.<br />\n&ldquo;What are you doing&rdquo; he heard her ask, and stopped to look at her.<br />\n&ldquo;Lying down&rdquo; he said slowly, unsure again. <br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sleeping in my bed with me with my brother&rsquo;s clothes on&rdquo; she told him, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. <br />\n&ldquo;Yes, Miss&rdquo; he grinned at her and straightened up again, taking the t-shirt off and stripping off the sweats. &ldquo;Better?&rdquo; Joe asked her.<br />\n&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; Taylor told him. &ldquo;Hurry up, I&rsquo;m cold.&rdquo;<br />\nHe chuckled again, finally lying down next to her.<br />\n&ldquo;Jesus, you&rsquo;re freezing&rdquo; he told her when she cuddled up next to him. <br />\n&ldquo;Your fault, left me alone on the bed&rdquo; she mumbled, breathing in the scent from his neck. <br />\n&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t stay here for even a minute though&rdquo; he said incredulously while pulling her even closer to him.<br />\n&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m still cold. And sleepy. Shut up.&rdquo; <br />\nJoe grinned and bent down a bit to kiss her forehead. &ldquo;Sleep tight, have the best dreams&rdquo; he murmured.<br />\nHe could feel her moving her head away from his neck and looked down to find her staring up at him. Her eyes were puffy from sleep, but she looked beautiful nonetheless.<br />\n&ldquo;Kiss?&rdquo; He heard her ask, seeming a bit unsure of herself.<br />\n&ldquo;All the kisses&rdquo; he smiled at her, running his hand up from her back, through her shoulder, towards her neck and resting it on her face, tilting it up enough so that he could kiss her on the mouth. He rested his lips on hers for a few seconds and then pecked her once, twice, three times. <br />\n&ldquo;Nunight, love.&rdquo; Joe said with his lips still touching hers. He kissed her cheek and she cuddled back into his neck, his hand moving back to her lower back where he rubbed soothing circles.<br />\nWhatever this was, it was growing, and Joe thought maybe it was time they properly talked about it. But for tonight he was going to enjoy his share of cuddles.<br />\n-<br />\n(Ok, this is it! Not sure if anyone is interested in why I wrote it like I wrote it but when I hear &lsquo;Delicate&rsquo;, and I feel that is what most people think too, is that &ldquo;long nights with your hands up in my hair, echoes of your footsteps on the stairs, stay here honey I don&rsquo;t wanna share&rdquo; implies some kind of sexual encounter, so I wanted to try and write it without that just to mess around with the possibilities a bit, taking some advantage of the duality of words you know :) also the nightie is in one of Taylor&rsquo;s rep magazine photos, there&rsquo;s a photo of her hugging her knees looking at her left side into the camera wearing an oversized grey t-shirt (something tells me that was not her t-shirt lmao). Hope you enjoyed it, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll feel inspired to write some other things soon)&nbsp;</p>",
