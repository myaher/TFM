        "body": "<p>In which we are finally introduced to Peter! If you would prefer, you can also read it on AO3 <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18032402/chapters/43032233#workskin\">here</a>. Hope you enjoy reading it!</p><!-- more --><p>It was obvious that SHIELD\u2019s medical wing was not meant for young patients. Tony mentally scoffed when he saw someone had tried to hastily put up colorful posters and pictures on the walls in a sad attempt to make the usually stoic and sleek hallways appear more warm and cozy. </p><p>It was just Tony and the doctor walking down the corridor to Peter\u2019s room- Fury had left to continue to deal with the aftershocks of finding a still-operating HYDRA base. </p><p>Dr. Helames slowed down to stop in front of a door at the end of the dead end hallway. \u201cAnd here we are,\u201d She smiled, and Tony felt grateful that she didn\u2019t comment on his obviously-nervous appearance. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in with you but I\u2019ll step out once Peter feels comfortable enough with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony said, taking a deep breath. Part of him was begging to just bolt and never look back, but Tony locked those feelings up behind steel doors. He refused to be a coward and just abandon his child. He was not Howard Stark. </p><p>\u201cJust as a reminder, he does have enhanced senses so try to keep your voice low. We had to make his door and walls soundproof because he kept hearing noises from even outside of the base.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t even know what to say towards that so instead he just nodded tightly. Dr. Helames smiled again, this time more understanding, before gently opening the door. </p><p>Once it was open enough she poked her head inside the room and in a soft voice called out, \u201cPeter? May I come in?\u201d She paused for a moment, obviously waiting for the kid to respond. He must have given a positive reaction because the doctor then asked, \u201cI also brought a friend to visit you, is it ok if he comes in?\u201d</p><p>This time the kid\u2019s response came out much more hesitant, but the doctor waited patiently. It was obvious that Dr. Helames was trying to allow Peter to have the chance to make choices for himself, which made sense; his captors hadn\u2019t most likely allowed the kid to make any decisions on what was happening to him. Tony mentally noted to give the kid choices for simple things in the future. </p><p>Tony shifted his weight as he waited for Peter\u2019s decision. If he was being honest with himself he hadn\u2019t even thought there was a chance that the kid would refuse to meet with him today. If Peter decided to send him away right now Tony wouldn\u2019t hold it against him- he clearly remembered how he barely wanted to meet with random people after returning home from his own kidnapping. Regardless, Tony had promised himself he wouldn\u2019t give up on the kid, and if there was one thing Stark men were good at it was keeping their promises.</p><p>Dr. Helames\u2019s grateful voice brought Tony out of his musings. \u201cPerfect, we\u2019re going to come in then,\u201d She said, opening the door wider to allow herself in. She turned back to look at Tony, who was still rooted in his spot just outside the room. She smiled reassuringly as she gestured with a tip of her head for him to come inside. Before Tony could talk himself out of it he squared his shoulders and joined her inside the room.</p><p>As much as Tony had been trying to prepare himself for this moment it seemed as if it were all in vein as he still felt his hands tremble and the air leave his lungs in a quick release as soon as he spotted the boy on the bed. The kid was absolutely tiny, smaller than what Tony had been expecting. The boy\u2019s hair was longer than in all the pictures Tony had seen previously, and it curled sweetly near the nape of his head. But what Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice most of all was how bright the kid\u2019s eyes were- and how they were the exact shade of Tony\u2019s own. </p><p>Peter had his head cocked to the side in obvious confusion and with a hint of fear. He looked quickly between Dr. Helames and Tony, before deciding to settle his gaze on the stranger in front of him. Tony knew the exact moment that Peter seemed to recognize him when he saw the kid\u2019s eyes widen while he sucked in a quick gasp.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I\u2019d like you to meet a good friend of mine,\u201d Dr. Helames announced but Tony didn\u2019t even spare a glance at her; his gaze was stuck firmly on the little boy in front of him who looked seconds away from bolting. \u201cThis is Tony Stark. Tony, this is Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-hey kid,\u201d Tony stuttered out, and part of him was embarrassed at how emotional he sounded in front of the doctor. However, a bigger part of him could care less how he sounded because he was finally meeting his son! Maybe it was creepy but Tony couldn\u2019t stop staring at the kid. He drank in every feature of the boy as if he were about to go blind; he tried to memorize every little detail the kid\u2019s face while he silently realized that holy crap! Tony had somehow helped make this beautiful, perfect creature in front of him. The genius was usually proud of the things he created and invented but he could already tell that the title for his best (greatest) creation would always belong to the tiny boy in front of him.</p><p>Tony watched in trepidation as the boy raised a small hand and waved hesitantly. Tony felt a watery smile on his lips as he waved back. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Dr. Helames said, snapping the boys attention back to her for a moment. \u201cI have to go check on other patients, but is it ok if Mr. Stark here keeps you company until I come back?\u201d</p><p>Tony was expecting more hesitation from Peter but was surprised when the kid nodded eagerly, eyes much brighter if that was even possible. Dr. Helames beamed. \u201cPerfect! Then I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d And with that she silently exited the room, but not before shooting Tony a small wink. Tony turned back towards the kid when he heard the door click shut behind him.</p><p>The room lapsed into an awkward silence as the kid nervously fixed his eyes down to his blanketed lap while Tony just continued to gaze at the boy. He saw the kid\u2019s eyes peek up shyly before shooting back down towards his lap when he saw that the man was still staring at him. Tony internally groaned. <i>Great, not even five full minutes and I\u2019m already scaring my kid. Great job, genius</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>He forced himself to stop staring and instead glanced around the room. With a quirk of his lips he commented, \u201cNot exactly a five star hotel, huh?\u201d</p><p>His heart almost came to a stop when the kid gave the most delicate giggle he ever heard. Peter looked up to meet Tony\u2019s eyes as he smiled timidly. He pointed a finger towards a chair next to the bed as he stared imploringly at Tony. </p><p>The billionaire raised an eyebrow as he smiled softly. \u201cDo you want me to sit there?\u201d Peter bobbed his head, clearly glad that the man could easily tell what he wanted. Tony could feel his heart melt as he moved to sit in the chair. \u201cAlright, thanks for the seat, kiddo,\u201d</p><p>Peter bashfully bowed his head as he fidgeted with his blankets. From the closer angle Tony could observe some of the kid\u2019s finer features. He could see how the kid\u2019s eyelashes were long like his own and how slight freckles dotted his nose and cheeks. There was a light scar on the side of his chin and Tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it came from before or after his time with HYDRA.</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes drifted to the bedside table at Peter\u2019s other side of the bed and noticed there was a small model Empire State Building made out of Lego blocks. \u201cYou build that?\u201d Tony asked, making sure to keep his voice warm and quiet. Peter looked up and nodded, a slight blush staining his cheeks as he continued to stare at his lap. \u201cWow, it looks really good! I couldn\u2019t have made a better one even if I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was an obvious lie and Tony internally winced at how forced his exclamation sounded. He wasn\u2019t used to interacting with kids, especially ones as young as Peter, so he didn\u2019t even have a baseline on what to say to the kid. Regardless of how stiff Tony sounded the kid started to uncurl on the bed, turning to face the man next to him. The boy bit his lip and pointed towards a box next to the Lego Empire State Building, looking hopefully up at Tony. The genius melted on the spot. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to grab it?\u201d Another shy nod from the kid. \u201cAlright, hold on.\u201d Tony reached across the bed and grabbed the box, handing it over to Peter slowly so he wouldn\u2019t scare the kid. Peter took it and opened the box, showing the contents to the billionaire. Tony saw that the box was filled to the brim with various Lego pieces, blocks, and cars. The boy picked up a little orange sports car and started to spin its wheels as he cocked his head at Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking, kiddo?\u201d Tony asked and immediately wanted to smack himself. The doctor had told him the boy was practically mute after the trauma he had faced, why would he suddenly answer Tony of all people? </p><p>Peter blinked at the question before his eyes drifted to Tony\u2019s chest. He reached forwards and tried to touch the Arc Reactor. Reacting on instinct Tony flinched away, causing the boy to stiffen and pull his arm backwards, quickly lowering his head and looking as if he were waiting to get hit. Tony\u2019s heart clenched as he regarded the boy in regret. It seemed that Tony was doomed to continue to make stupid mistakes and keep scaring his kid away </p><p>\u201cSorry kid, you just\u2026 uh surprised me is all,\u201d Tony started. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. Can you please look at me again?\u201d</p><p>Peter gnawed at his lower lip but ultimately peered up at Tony. His previously bright eyes had dulled slightly as started to spin his car\u2019s wheels faster. Tony tried to offer him a soft and comforting smile. \u201cDo you want to see my Arc Reactor?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened but he didn\u2019t offer a nod or shake of his head. Reading the expression on the boy\u2019s face Tony assumed that the kid wanted to see the reactor but didn\u2019t want to admit it in case it made Tony upset. Taking a deep breath Tony decided to lower his shirt so the kid could look at the reactor clearly. </p><p>Tony tried not to squirm as the boy studied the Arc Reactor in silence. He wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of showing people what had basically kept him alive for the past year (and also what had very nearly killed him), but he swallowed the discomfort in order to make his son (still not freaking used to that) less apprehensive. </p><p>Peter lifted his eyes to meet Tony\u2019s gaze before he very slowly lifted the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the toy car. The kid cautiously reached to touch the Arc Reactor while still holding Tony\u2019s gaze. It was obvious that Peter was trying to give Tony a chance to move away again if he needed to, and that made the genius\u2019s previously cold heart flutter as he realized how empathetic his son was.</p><p>Tony allowed Peter to touch the Arc Reactor. He was expecting the child to push hard against it but instead Peter just lightly grazed his finger over the top of it. The kid smiled as he looked over the Arc Reactor before leaning back and away from the billionaire. Tony pulled up his shirt once he was sure the kid didn\u2019t want to continue to study the reactor. Smiling slightly he questioned, \u201cYou\u2019re a fan of Iron Man, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned widely and motioned to a shelf on the opposite wall. From here Tony could barely make out a child\u2019s version of the Iron Man helmet, which for some reason looked vaguely familiar but Tony wasn\u2019t sure why. Tony couldn\u2019t stop his own grin from forming on his lips when he realized that his son was actually a fan of his alter ego. The idea made Tony feel warm inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess he is the best hero out there,\u201d Tony teased, causing the kid to giggle again as he continued to play with his toy car on the bed. Tony felt the last of the previous tension uncoil from his stomach as he decided that yes, his kid had the most adorable little giggle out there.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you laughing?\u201d Tony asked in mock offense, making sure it was obvious that he was kidding by widening his smile. Peter looked up at him with starstruck eyes so Tony figured he was doing a good job of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe I\u2019m the best superhero, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>Peter rapidly shook his head, giggles growing louder. It was at that moment that Tony knew that he had fallen deeply in love with the boy in front of him, and that without even trying the kid had seamlessly wrapped the billionaire tightly around his finger. If the kid asked for the moon right then and there Tony would have probably called up the head of NASA to ask how to buy the moon just to keep that beautiful smile on his son\u2019s face. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes snapped to the door and before Tony could as if something was wrong he heard a soft knock. A second later Dr. Helames poked her head in the room. \u201cEverything ok in here, boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony confirmed, shooting a small smile with Peter that the boy slowly returned. \u201cEverything\u2019s going great, doc, I think me and Petey here are getting along swimmingly.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushed and and lowered his head, but Tony could see the timid ghost of a smile on that precious little face. God, he was sounding so sappy but Tony didn\u2019t care; he absolutely already adored this kid with his whole heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Dr. Helames replied truthfully. \u201cBut unfortunately it\u2019s time for Peter to take a nap, he\u2019s still healing and the medication we have to give him will make him drowsy.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression completely changed at those words and he turned wide eyes towards Tony. The genius\u2019s chest tightened when he saw the honest distress in those doe-brown eyes, but he knew logically that the kid was still healing so he needed all the rest he could have. </p><p>Still, Tony reached a cautious hand to lay on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t look so sad, kiddie, sleeps important. Or, at least I\u2019ve been told that,\u201d Tony gave an exaggerated eye roll, earning a watery giggle from Peter. \u201cHow about this: You take a nice nap, and I\u2019ll come visit you again really soon?\u201d</p><p>A tear slipped from Peter\u2019s eye and Tony, without even thinking about it, reached up to wipe it away. He froze, and was about to apologize until Peter leaned into Tony\u2019s hand against his cheek. The boy pursed his lips and held up a hand, pinky out.</p><p>Tony blinked and the realized what the kid meant. If possible his chest warmed even more as he asked, \u201cYou want me to pinky promise, kid?\u201d Peter nodded and stared at Tony wordlessly. \u201cFair enough, pinky promises are pretty unbreakable I guess.\u201d Tony moved his hand away from the kids face as he wrapped his pinky around Peter\u2019s much smaller one. The kid beamed up at him and Tony returned the expression. The kid put his little car back into the box and leaned away to put it on the bedside table.</p><p>Tony quietly stood up and watched as the kid got comfortable on the bed. The kid waved at him again so Tony waved back. \u201cSee you later, kiddo, have wonderful dreams.\u201d Peter watched owlishly as Tony went towards the door. The billionaire paused before he turned back to the kid. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad I got to meet you, kiddie, and I can\u2019t wait to see you again.\u201d The last thing Tony saw before he closed the door to his son\u2019s room was Peter\u2019s bright eyes. </p><p>Once the door was fully closed Tony leaned his forehead against the door as he closed his eyes, cementing his son\u2019s precious face in his mind.</p>",

Hope you enjoy reading it!</p>[[MORE]]<p>It was obvious that SHIELD\u2019s medical wing was not meant for young patients. Tony mentally scoffed when he saw someone had tried to hastily put up colorful posters and pictures on the walls in a sad attempt to make the usually stoic and sleek hallways appear more warm and cozy. </p><p>It was just Tony and the doctor walking down the corridor to Peter\u2019s room- Fury had left to continue to deal with the aftershocks of finding a still-operating HYDRA base. </p><p>Dr. Helames slowed down to stop in front of a door at the end of the dead end hallway. \u201cAnd here we are,\u201d She smiled, and Tony felt grateful that she didn\u2019t comment on his obviously-nervous appearance. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in with you but I\u2019ll step out once Peter feels comfortable enough with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony said, taking a deep breath. Part of him was begging to just bolt and never look back, but Tony locked those feelings up behind steel doors. He refused to be a coward and just abandon his child. He was not Howard Stark. </p><p>\u201cJust as a reminder, he does have enhanced senses so try to keep your voice low. We had to make his door and walls soundproof because he kept hearing noises from even outside of the base.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t even know what to say towards that so instead he just nodded tightly. Dr. Helames smiled again, this time more understanding, before gently opening the door. </p><p>Once it was open enough she poked her head inside the room and in a soft voice called out, \u201cPeter? May I come in?\u201d She paused for a moment, obviously waiting for the kid to respond. He must have given a positive reaction because the doctor then asked, \u201cI also brought a friend to visit you, is it ok if he comes in?\u201d</p><p>This time the kid\u2019s response came out much more hesitant, but the doctor waited patiently. It was obvious that Dr. Helames was trying to allow Peter to have the chance to make choices for himself, which made sense; his captors hadn\u2019t most likely allowed the kid to make any decisions on what was happening to him. Tony mentally noted to give the kid choices for simple things in the future. </p><p>Tony shifted his weight as he waited for Peter\u2019s decision. If he was being honest with himself he hadn\u2019t even thought there was a chance that the kid would refuse to meet with him today. If Peter decided to send him away right now Tony wouldn\u2019t hold it against him- he clearly remembered how he barely wanted to meet with random people after returning home from his own kidnapping. Regardless, Tony had promised himself he wouldn\u2019t give up on the kid, and if there was one thing Stark men were good at it was keeping their promises.</p><p>Dr. Helames\u2019s grateful voice brought Tony out of his musings. \u201cPerfect, we\u2019re going to come in then,\u201d She said, opening the door wider to allow herself in. She turned back to look at Tony, who was still rooted in his spot just outside the room. She smiled reassuringly as she gestured with a tip of her head for him to come inside. Before Tony could talk himself out of it he squared his shoulders and joined her inside the room.</p><p>As much as Tony had been trying to prepare himself for this moment it seemed as if it were all in vein as he still felt his hands tremble and the air leave his lungs in a quick release as soon as he spotted the boy on the bed. The kid was absolutely tiny, smaller than what Tony had been expecting. The boy\u2019s hair was longer than in all the pictures Tony had seen previously, and it curled sweetly near the nape of his head. But what Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice most of all was how bright the kid\u2019s eyes were- and how they were the exact shade of Tony\u2019s own. </p><p>Peter had his head cocked to the side in obvious confusion and with a hint of fear. He looked quickly between Dr. Helames and Tony, before deciding to settle his gaze on the stranger in front of him. Tony knew the exact moment that Peter seemed to recognize him when he saw the kid\u2019s eyes widen while he sucked in a quick gasp.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I\u2019d like you to meet a good friend of mine,\u201d Dr. Helames announced but Tony didn\u2019t even spare a glance at her; his gaze was stuck firmly on the little boy in front of him who looked seconds away from bolting. \u201cThis is Tony Stark. Tony, this is Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-hey kid,\u201d Tony stuttered out, and part of him was embarrassed at how emotional he sounded in front of the doctor. However, a bigger part of him could care less how he sounded because he was finally meeting his son! Maybe it was creepy but Tony couldn\u2019t stop staring at the kid. He drank in every feature of the boy as if he were about to go blind; he tried to memorize every little detail the kid\u2019s face while he silently realized that holy crap! Tony had somehow helped make this beautiful, perfect creature in front of him. The genius was usually proud of the things he created and invented but he could already tell that the title for his best (greatest) creation would always belong to the tiny boy in front of him.</p><p>Tony watched in trepidation as the boy raised a small hand and waved hesitantly. Tony felt a watery smile on his lips as he waved back. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Dr. Helames said, snapping the boys attention back to her for a moment. \u201cI have to go check on other patients, but is it ok if Mr. Stark here keeps you company until I come back?\u201d</p><p>Tony was expecting more hesitation from Peter but was surprised when the kid nodded eagerly, eyes much brighter if that was even possible. Dr. Helames beamed. \u201cPerfect! Then I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d And with that she silently exited the room, but not before shooting Tony a small wink. Tony turned back towards the kid when he heard the door click shut behind him.</p><p>The room lapsed into an awkward silence as the kid nervously fixed his eyes down to his blanketed lap while Tony just continued to gaze at the boy. He saw the kid\u2019s eyes peek up shyly before shooting back down towards his lap when he saw that the man was still staring at him. Tony internally groaned. <i>Great, not even five full minutes and I\u2019m already scaring my kid. Great job, genius</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>He forced himself to stop staring and instead glanced around the room. With a quirk of his lips he commented, \u201cNot exactly a five star hotel, huh?\u201d</p><p>His heart almost came to a stop when the kid gave the most delicate giggle he ever heard. Peter looked up to meet Tony\u2019s eyes as he smiled timidly. He pointed a finger towards a chair next to the bed as he stared imploringly at Tony. </p><p>The billionaire raised an eyebrow as he smiled softly. \u201cDo you want me to sit there?\u201d Peter bobbed his head, clearly glad that the man could easily tell what he wanted. Tony could feel his heart melt as he moved to sit in the chair. \u201cAlright, thanks for the seat, kiddo,\u201d</p><p>Peter bashfully bowed his head as he fidgeted with his blankets. From the closer angle Tony could observe some of the kid\u2019s finer features. He could see how the kid\u2019s eyelashes were long like his own and how slight freckles dotted his nose and cheeks. There was a light scar on the side of his chin and Tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it came from before or after his time with HYDRA.</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes drifted to the bedside table at Peter\u2019s other side of the bed and noticed there was a small model Empire State Building made out of Lego blocks. \u201cYou build that?\u201d Tony asked, making sure to keep his voice warm and quiet. Peter looked up and nodded, a slight blush staining his cheeks as he continued to stare at his lap. \u201cWow, it looks really good! I couldn\u2019t have made a better one even if I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was an obvious lie and Tony internally winced at how forced his exclamation sounded. He wasn\u2019t used to interacting with kids, especially ones as young as Peter, so he didn\u2019t even have a baseline on what to say to the kid. Regardless of how stiff Tony sounded the kid started to uncurl on the bed, turning to face the man next to him. The boy bit his lip and pointed towards a box next to the Lego Empire State Building, looking hopefully up at Tony. The genius melted on the spot. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to grab it?\u201d Another shy nod from the kid. \u201cAlright, hold on.\u201d Tony reached across the bed and grabbed the box, handing it over to Peter slowly so he wouldn\u2019t scare the kid. Peter took it and opened the box, showing the contents to the billionaire. Tony saw that the box was filled to the brim with various Lego pieces, blocks, and cars. The boy picked up a little orange sports car and started to spin its wheels as he cocked his head at Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking, kiddo?\u201d Tony asked and immediately wanted to smack himself. The doctor had told him the boy was practically mute after the trauma he had faced, why would he suddenly answer Tony of all people? </p><p>Peter blinked at the question before his eyes drifted to Tony\u2019s chest. He reached forwards and tried to touch the Arc Reactor. Reacting on instinct Tony flinched away, causing the boy to stiffen and pull his arm backwards, quickly lowering his head and looking as if he were waiting to get hit. Tony\u2019s heart clenched as he regarded the boy in regret. It seemed that Tony was doomed to continue to make stupid mistakes and keep scaring his kid away </p><p>\u201cSorry kid, you just\u2026 uh surprised me is all,\u201d Tony started. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. Can you please look at me again?\u201d</p><p>Peter gnawed at his lower lip but ultimately peered up at Tony. His previously bright eyes had dulled slightly as started to spin his car\u2019s wheels faster. Tony tried to offer him a soft and comforting smile. \u201cDo you want to see my Arc Reactor?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened but he didn\u2019t offer a nod or shake of his head. Reading the expression on the boy\u2019s face Tony assumed that the kid wanted to see the reactor but didn\u2019t want to admit it in case it made Tony upset. Taking a deep breath Tony decided to lower his shirt so the kid could look at the reactor clearly. </p><p>Tony tried not to squirm as the boy studied the Arc Reactor in silence. He wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of showing people what had basically kept him alive for the past year (and also what had very nearly killed him), but he swallowed the discomfort in order to make his son (still not freaking used to that) less apprehensive. </p><p>Peter lifted his eyes to meet Tony\u2019s gaze before he very slowly lifted the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the toy car. The kid cautiously reached to touch the Arc Reactor while still holding Tony\u2019s gaze. It was obvious that Peter was trying to give Tony a chance to move away again if he needed to, and that made the genius\u2019s previously cold heart flutter as he realized how empathetic his son was.</p><p>Tony allowed Peter to touch the Arc Reactor. He was expecting the child to push hard against it but instead Peter just lightly grazed his finger over the top of it. The kid smiled as he looked over the Arc Reactor before leaning back and away from the billionaire. Tony pulled up his shirt once he was sure the kid didn\u2019t want to continue to study the reactor. Smiling slightly he questioned, \u201cYou\u2019re a fan of Iron Man, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned widely and motioned to a shelf on the opposite wall. From here Tony could barely make out a child\u2019s version of the Iron Man helmet, which for some reason looked vaguely familiar but Tony wasn\u2019t sure why. Tony couldn\u2019t stop his own grin from forming on his lips when he realized that his son was actually a fan of his alter ego. The idea made Tony feel warm inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess he is the best hero out there,\u201d Tony teased, causing the kid to giggle again as he continued to play with his toy car on the bed. Tony felt the last of the previous tension uncoil from his stomach as he decided that yes, his kid had the most adorable little giggle out there.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you laughing?\u201d Tony asked in mock offense, making sure it was obvious that he was kidding by widening his smile.

But what Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice most of all was how bright the kid\u2019s eyes were- and how they were the exact shade of Tony\u2019s own. </p><p>Peter had his head cocked to the side in obvious confusion and with a hint of fear. He looked quickly between Dr. Helames and Tony, before deciding to settle his gaze on the stranger in front of him. Tony knew the exact moment that Peter seemed to recognize him when he saw the kid\u2019s eyes widen while he sucked in a quick gasp.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I\u2019d like you to meet a good friend of mine,\u201d Dr. Helames announced but Tony didn\u2019t even spare a glance at her; his gaze was stuck firmly on the little boy in front of him who looked seconds away from bolting. \u201cThis is Tony Stark. Tony, this is Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-hey kid,\u201d Tony stuttered out, and part of him was embarrassed at how emotional he sounded in front of the doctor. However, a bigger part of him could care less how he sounded because he was finally meeting his son! Maybe it was creepy but Tony couldn\u2019t stop staring at the kid. He drank in every feature of the boy as if he were about to go blind; he tried to memorize every little detail the kid\u2019s face while he silently realized that holy crap! Tony had somehow helped make this beautiful, perfect creature in front of him. The genius was usually proud of the things he created and invented but he could already tell that the title for his best (greatest) creation would always belong to the tiny boy in front of him.</p><p>Tony watched in trepidation as the boy raised a small hand and waved hesitantly. Tony felt a watery smile on his lips as he waved back. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Dr. Helames said, snapping the boys attention back to her for a moment. \u201cI have to go check on other patients, but is it ok if Mr. Stark here keeps you company until I come back?\u201d</p><p>Tony was expecting more hesitation from Peter but was surprised when the kid nodded eagerly, eyes much brighter if that was even possible. Dr. Helames beamed. \u201cPerfect! Then I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d And with that she silently exited the room, but not before shooting Tony a small wink. Tony turned back towards the kid when he heard the door click shut behind him.</p><p>The room lapsed into an awkward silence as the kid nervously fixed his eyes down to his blanketed lap while Tony just continued to gaze at the boy. He saw the kid\u2019s eyes peek up shyly before shooting back down towards his lap when he saw that the man was still staring at him. Tony internally groaned. <i>Great, not even five full minutes and I\u2019m already scaring my kid. Great job, genius</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>He forced himself to stop staring and instead glanced around the room. With a quirk of his lips he commented, \u201cNot exactly a five star hotel, huh?\u201d</p><p>His heart almost came to a stop when the kid gave the most delicate giggle he ever heard. Peter looked up to meet Tony\u2019s eyes as he smiled timidly. He pointed a finger towards a chair next to the bed as he stared imploringly at Tony. </p><p>The billionaire raised an eyebrow as he smiled softly. \u201cDo you want me to sit there?\u201d Peter bobbed his head, clearly glad that the man could easily tell what he wanted. Tony could feel his heart melt as he moved to sit in the chair. \u201cAlright, thanks for the seat, kiddo,\u201d</p><p>Peter bashfully bowed his head as he fidgeted with his blankets. From the closer angle Tony could observe some of the kid\u2019s finer features. He could see how the kid\u2019s eyelashes were long like his own and how slight freckles dotted his nose and cheeks. There was a light scar on the side of his chin and Tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it came from before or after his time with HYDRA.</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes drifted to the bedside table at Peter\u2019s other side of the bed and noticed there was a small model Empire State Building made out of Lego blocks. \u201cYou build that?\u201d Tony asked, making sure to keep his voice warm and quiet. Peter looked up and nodded, a slight blush staining his cheeks as he continued to stare at his lap. \u201cWow, it looks really good! I couldn\u2019t have made a better one even if I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was an obvious lie and Tony internally winced at how forced his exclamation sounded. He wasn\u2019t used to interacting with kids, especially ones as young as Peter, so he didn\u2019t even have a baseline on what to say to the kid. Regardless of how stiff Tony sounded the kid started to uncurl on the bed, turning to face the man next to him. The boy bit his lip and pointed towards a box next to the Lego Empire State Building, looking hopefully up at Tony. The genius melted on the spot. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to grab it?\u201d Another shy nod from the kid. \u201cAlright, hold on.\u201d Tony reached across the bed and grabbed the box, handing it over to Peter slowly so he wouldn\u2019t scare the kid. Peter took it and opened the box, showing the contents to the billionaire. Tony saw that the box was filled to the brim with various Lego pieces, blocks, and cars. The boy picked up a little orange sports car and started to spin its wheels as he cocked his head at Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking, kiddo?\u201d Tony asked and immediately wanted to smack himself. The doctor had told him the boy was practically mute after the trauma he had faced, why would he suddenly answer Tony of all people? </p><p>Peter blinked at the question before his eyes drifted to Tony\u2019s chest. He reached forwards and tried to touch the Arc Reactor. Reacting on instinct Tony flinched away, causing the boy to stiffen and pull his arm backwards, quickly lowering his head and looking as if he were waiting to get hit. Tony\u2019s heart clenched as he regarded the boy in regret. It seemed that Tony was doomed to continue to make stupid mistakes and keep scaring his kid away </p><p>\u201cSorry kid, you just\u2026 uh surprised me is all,\u201d Tony started. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. Can you please look at me again?\u201d</p><p>Peter gnawed at his lower lip but ultimately peered up at Tony. His previously bright eyes had dulled slightly as started to spin his car\u2019s wheels faster. Tony tried to offer him a soft and comforting smile. \u201cDo you want to see my Arc Reactor?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened but he didn\u2019t offer a nod or shake of his head. Reading the expression on the boy\u2019s face Tony assumed that the kid wanted to see the reactor but didn\u2019t want to admit it in case it made Tony upset. Taking a deep breath Tony decided to lower his shirt so the kid could look at the reactor clearly. </p><p>Tony tried not to squirm as the boy studied the Arc Reactor in silence. He wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of showing people what had basically kept him alive for the past year (and also what had very nearly killed him), but he swallowed the discomfort in order to make his son (still not freaking used to that) less apprehensive. </p><p>Peter lifted his eyes to meet Tony\u2019s gaze before he very slowly lifted the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the toy car. The kid cautiously reached to touch the Arc Reactor while still holding Tony\u2019s gaze. It was obvious that Peter was trying to give Tony a chance to move away again if he needed to, and that made the genius\u2019s previously cold heart flutter as he realized how empathetic his son was.</p><p>Tony allowed Peter to touch the Arc Reactor. He was expecting the child to push hard against it but instead Peter just lightly grazed his finger over the top of it. The kid smiled as he looked over the Arc Reactor before leaning back and away from the billionaire. Tony pulled up his shirt once he was sure the kid didn\u2019t want to continue to study the reactor. Smiling slightly he questioned, \u201cYou\u2019re a fan of Iron Man, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned widely and motioned to a shelf on the opposite wall. From here Tony could barely make out a child\u2019s version of the Iron Man helmet, which for some reason looked vaguely familiar but Tony wasn\u2019t sure why. Tony couldn\u2019t stop his own grin from forming on his lips when he realized that his son was actually a fan of his alter ego. The idea made Tony feel warm inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess he is the best hero out there,\u201d Tony teased, causing the kid to giggle again as he continued to play with his toy car on the bed. Tony felt the last of the previous tension uncoil from his stomach as he decided that yes, his kid had the most adorable little giggle out there.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you laughing?\u201d Tony asked in mock offense, making sure it was obvious that he was kidding by widening his smile. Peter looked up at him with starstruck eyes so Tony figured he was doing a good job of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe I\u2019m the best superhero, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>Peter rapidly shook his head, giggles growing louder. It was at that moment that Tony knew that he had fallen deeply in love with the boy in front of him, and that without even trying the kid had seamlessly wrapped the billionaire tightly around his finger. If the kid asked for the moon right then and there Tony would have probably called up the head of NASA to ask how to buy the moon just to keep that beautiful smile on his son\u2019s face. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes snapped to the door and before Tony could as if something was wrong he heard a soft knock. A second later Dr. Helames poked her head in the room. \u201cEverything ok in here, boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony confirmed, shooting a small smile with Peter that the boy slowly returned. \u201cEverything\u2019s going great, doc, I think me and Petey here are getting along swimmingly.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushed and and lowered his head, but Tony could see the timid ghost of a smile on that precious little face. God, he was sounding so sappy but Tony didn\u2019t care; he absolutely already adored this kid with his whole heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Dr. Helames replied truthfully. \u201cBut unfortunately it\u2019s time for Peter to take a nap, he\u2019s still healing and the medication we have to give him will make him drowsy.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression completely changed at those words and he turned wide eyes towards Tony. The genius\u2019s chest tightened when he saw the honest distress in those doe-brown eyes, but he knew logically that the kid was still healing so he needed all the rest he could have. </p><p>Still, Tony reached a cautious hand to lay on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t look so sad, kiddie, sleeps important. Or, at least I\u2019ve been told that,\u201d Tony gave an exaggerated eye roll, earning a watery giggle from Peter. \u201cHow about this: You take a nice nap, and I\u2019ll come visit you again really soon?\u201d</p><p>A tear slipped from Peter\u2019s eye and Tony, without even thinking about it, reached up to wipe it away. He froze, and was about to apologize until Peter leaned into Tony\u2019s hand against his cheek. The boy pursed his lips and held up a hand, pinky out.</p><p>Tony blinked and the realized what the kid meant. If possible his chest warmed even more as he asked, \u201cYou want me to pinky promise, kid?\u201d Peter nodded and stared at Tony wordlessly. \u201cFair enough, pinky promises are pretty unbreakable I guess.\u201d Tony moved his hand away from the kids face as he wrapped his pinky around Peter\u2019s much smaller one. The kid beamed up at him and Tony returned the expression. The kid put his little car back into the box and leaned away to put it on the bedside table.</p><p>Tony quietly stood up and watched as the kid got comfortable on the bed. The kid waved at him again so Tony waved back. \u201cSee you later, kiddo, have wonderful dreams.\u201d Peter watched owlishly as Tony went towards the door. The billionaire paused before he turned back to the kid. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad I got to meet you, kiddie, and I can\u2019t wait to see you again.\u201d The last thing Tony saw before he closed the door to his son\u2019s room was Peter\u2019s bright eyes. </p><p>Once the door was fully closed Tony leaned his forehead against the door as he closed his eyes, cementing his son\u2019s precious face in his mind.</p>",
                "content": "<p>In which we are finally introduced to Peter! If you would prefer, you can also read it on AO3 <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18032402/chapters/43032233#workskin\">here</a>. Hope you enjoy reading it!</p><p>It was obvious that SHIELD&rsquo;s medical wing was not meant for young patients. Tony mentally scoffed when he saw someone had tried to hastily put up colorful posters and pictures on the walls in a sad attempt to make the usually stoic and sleek hallways appear more warm and cozy. </p><p>It was just Tony and the doctor walking down the corridor to Peter&rsquo;s room- Fury had left to continue to deal with the aftershocks of finding a still-operating HYDRA base. </p><p>Dr. Helames slowed down to stop in front of a door at the end of the dead end hallway. &ldquo;And here we are,&rdquo; She smiled, and Tony felt grateful that she didn&rsquo;t comment on his obviously-nervous appearance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go in with you but I&rsquo;ll step out once Peter feels comfortable enough with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Tony said, taking a deep breath. Part of him was begging to just bolt and never look back, but Tony locked those feelings up behind steel doors. He refused to be a coward and just abandon his child. He was not Howard Stark. </p><p>&ldquo;Just as a reminder, he does have enhanced senses so try to keep your voice low. We had to make his door and walls soundproof because he kept hearing noises from even outside of the base.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t even know what to say towards that so instead he just nodded tightly. Dr. Helames smiled again, this time more understanding, before gently opening the door. </p><p>Once it was open enough she poked her head inside the room and in a soft voice called out, &ldquo;Peter? May I come in?&rdquo; She paused for a moment, obviously waiting for the kid to respond. He must have given a positive reaction because the doctor then asked, &ldquo;I also brought a friend to visit you, is it ok if he comes in?&rdquo;</p><p>This time the kid&rsquo;s response came out much more hesitant, but the doctor waited patiently. It was obvious that Dr. Helames was trying to allow Peter to have the chance to make choices for himself, which made sense; his captors hadn&rsquo;t most likely allowed the kid to make any decisions on what was happening to him. Tony mentally noted to give the kid choices for simple things in the future. </p><p>Tony shifted his weight as he waited for Peter&rsquo;s decision. If he was being honest with himself he hadn&rsquo;t even thought there was a chance that the kid would refuse to meet with him today. If Peter decided to send him away right now Tony wouldn&rsquo;t hold it against him- he clearly remembered how he barely wanted to meet with random people after returning home from his own kidnapping. Regardless, Tony had promised himself he wouldn&rsquo;t give up on the kid, and if there was one thing Stark men were good at it was keeping their promises.</p><p>Dr. Helames&rsquo;s grateful voice brought Tony out of his musings. &ldquo;Perfect, we&rsquo;re going to come in then,&rdquo; She said, opening the door wider to allow herself in. She turned back to look at Tony, who was still rooted in his spot just outside the room. She smiled reassuringly as she gestured with a tip of her head for him to come inside. Before Tony could talk himself out of it he squared his shoulders and joined her inside the room.</p><p>As much as Tony had been trying to prepare himself for this moment it seemed as if it were all in vein as he still felt his hands tremble and the air leave his lungs in a quick release as soon as he spotted the boy on the bed. The kid was absolutely tiny, smaller than what Tony had been expecting. The boy&rsquo;s hair was longer than in all the pictures Tony had seen previously, and it curled sweetly near the nape of his head. But what Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but notice most of all was how bright the kid&rsquo;s eyes were- and how they were the exact shade of Tony&rsquo;s own. </p><p>Peter had his head cocked to the side in obvious confusion and with a hint of fear. He looked quickly between Dr. Helames and Tony, before deciding to settle his gaze on the stranger in front of him. Tony knew the exact moment that Peter seemed to recognize him when he saw the kid&rsquo;s eyes widen while he sucked in a quick gasp.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I&rsquo;d like you to meet a good friend of mine,&rdquo; Dr. Helames announced but Tony didn&rsquo;t even spare a glance at her; his gaze was stuck firmly on the little boy in front of him who looked seconds away from bolting. &ldquo;This is Tony Stark. Tony, this is Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;H-hey kid,&rdquo; Tony stuttered out, and part of him was embarrassed at how emotional he sounded in front of the doctor. However, a bigger part of him could care less how he sounded because he was finally meeting his son! Maybe it was creepy but Tony couldn&rsquo;t stop staring at the kid. He drank in every feature of the boy as if he were about to go blind; he tried to memorize every little detail the kid&rsquo;s face while he silently realized that holy crap! Tony had somehow helped make this beautiful, perfect creature in front of him. The genius was usually proud of the things he created and invented but he could already tell that the title for his best (greatest) creation would always belong to the tiny boy in front of him.</p><p>Tony watched in trepidation as the boy raised a small hand and waved hesitantly.

Tony could feel his heart melt as he moved to sit in the chair. &ldquo;Alright, thanks for the seat, kiddo,&rdquo;</p><p>Peter bashfully bowed his head as he fidgeted with his blankets. From the closer angle Tony could observe some of the kid&rsquo;s finer features. He could see how the kid&rsquo;s eyelashes were long like his own and how slight freckles dotted his nose and cheeks.

Like, how his hand would get all warm when his crush touches it, or how his lips would feel all tingly and numb after their first kiss, or how his body would feel after his \u2018first time\u2019. I feel like everything is truly dialed to 100 because of his Spidey senses. Maybe some good ol\u2019 fluff with this concept? Love your writing \u2665\ufe0f</p><p>~~~</p><p>It was difficult to understand how Peter really felt with the parts of his abilities that people couldn&rsquo;t really see. It wasn&rsquo;t like the webs or the agility that were evident in the stories about him and the sights of him around the city. It was the small detail in actions that only he noticed, and, eventually, you would too as you saw more and more of the boy you&rsquo;d grown to love. </p><p>~~~</p><p>Peter first noticed those details when your hand first brushed against his. He could remember his exact position in that seat in chem class - forever thanking fate for sitting you next to him. He felt the way every single hair on his limbs jumped to a bold attention. How it felt as though everything slowed to allow every electrified nerve ending in his hand to capture the feeling of your skin in contact with his. It was like he could feel his body&rsquo;s response to release an overwhelming adrenaline. He could feel it pulsing in the increased blood pressure. But it vanished. It was gone just as quickly as it had arrived - leaving him unsure if it ever really happened at all. </p><p>~~~</p><p>And then it was there again. He could feel the vibration of your laugh against his ear drums, hating the feeling of it quietening - wanting to keep it locked there for forever. But your hand was in his again and you weren&rsquo;t letting go this time. And anyone knows he certainly wouldn&rsquo;t either. So, there you were, intertwined hands and electrified senses for the boy that felt like he was dreaming. There was a strange warmth in his palm that he was sure your cool hands would welcome in a heartbeat. It felt as though all of his body was detached from his buzzing mind in a moment everyone else would view as mundane. But you were holding hands. And you weren&rsquo;t letting go. </p><p>~~~</p><p>But boy, oh boy, nothing would prepare him for that first kiss. The movies didn&rsquo;t show it, the kids at school didn&rsquo;t feel like he did. Because your lips on his felt beyond anything his dreams could conjure. It was slow and cautious at first - mainly due to his lack of experience and his uncertainty for your response to his forward actions. But then you were kissing back and he oddly felt like a natural at an action completely new to him. It was in the way that he was close enough to feel your cheeks against his and feel the way your noses bumped against each other. It was in the heat that arose on his face in response to such contact. The way his lips tingled with a tickling sensation as soon as your mouth left his. Was it normal to smile this much after your first kiss? He saw the adoration in your eyes and he was sure they were clear enough for him to see the mirror reflection of his own. God, he&rsquo;d be doing this a lot more if this is what kissing felt like.</p><p>~~~</p><p>If kissing was a big deal, it was inevitable that anything further than that was even more intense for Peter. Which is why your relationship was a slow process. A speed you were both comfortable to maintain. Until that first night. A night of many firsts for Peter - the main being his first &lsquo;time&rsquo;. He&rsquo;d made sure everything was perfect, planned meticulously every detail to go into making sure you felt special on that evening. From candlelit dinners to your favourite movie to, inevitably, the moment you&rsquo;d both been waiting for. He&rsquo;d researched it a million times but nothing could compare. It was in the way his nerves felt as though they were trembling with every feeling possible. In the way his eyes couldn&rsquo;t manage to stay open but he was too adrenaline fueled to sleep. In the warm scent of your presence beside him. He was sure it was all a dream but the crystal clear senses coursing his veins made him certain that everything that had just happened had really just happened!</p><p>And then those words. Spoken in the sweetest, fatigue soaked voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Peter,&rdquo;</p><p>He felt as it rumbled into his chest from your resting on his bare torso. He felt the way it echoed quietly in his ears and settled the rushing blood for a moment of welcome bliss. He felt his hand hold you a little closer. He felt it all. </p><p>~~~</p><p>Tags: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0TMhQmFSJcVDo6Tz0pibIg\">@imarypayne</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTYhz8SAix2kAyx3S0sWHVA\">@sunshine112</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Fijx22baZx1OrZPZHHJQQ\">@bringmethehorizonandpizza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1YBDcBz6Q08BurkhU_q9rA\">@vibhati123</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIYTZTvm98ugq3dzvzdIvTA\">@butithasntkilledyouyet</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOKErMb8y_XqH9PBurRosQ\">@faefictions</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfd423T9ymiK6auxtTnOsXA\">@carisi-sonny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwdRp42HIty5X-EGSuEahGg\">@trap-house-homiecide</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msrO4TweMKVGo4q4irPtOAg\">@shamelessbookaddict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7raS9lsMcucctfWG5HpPdg\">@tommydaspidey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHK3bu1q5iOqXC1y9MhdF0A\">@oneblckcoffee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPI_5sIRuTeJ5F03Io2m_tA\">@darlingtholland</a> </p>",

He could feel the vibration of your laugh against his ear drums, hating the feeling of it quietening - wanting to keep it locked there for forever. But your hand was in his again and you weren&rsquo;t letting go this time. And anyone knows he certainly wouldn&rsquo;t either. So, there you were, intertwined hands and electrified senses for the boy that felt like he was dreaming. There was a strange warmth in his palm that he was sure your cool hands would welcome in a heartbeat. It felt as though all of his body was detached from his buzzing mind in a moment everyone else would view as mundane. But you were holding hands. And you weren&rsquo;t letting go. </p><p>~~~</p><p>But boy, oh boy, nothing would prepare him for that first kiss. The movies didn&rsquo;t show it, the kids at school didn&rsquo;t feel like he did. Because your lips on his felt beyond anything his dreams could conjure. It was slow and cautious at first - mainly due to his lack of experience and his uncertainty for your response to his forward actions. But then you were kissing back and he oddly felt like a natural at an action completely new to him. It was in the way that he was close enough to feel your cheeks against his and feel the way your noses bumped against each other. It was in the heat that arose on his face in response to such contact. The way his lips tingled with a tickling sensation as soon as your mouth left his. Was it normal to smile this much after your first kiss? He saw the adoration in your eyes and he was sure they were clear enough for him to see the mirror reflection of his own. God, he&rsquo;d be doing this a lot more if this is what kissing felt like.</p><p>~~~</p><p>If kissing was a big deal, it was inevitable that anything further than that was even more intense for Peter. Which is why your relationship was a slow process. A speed you were both comfortable to maintain. Until that first night. A night of many firsts for Peter - the main being his first &lsquo;time&rsquo;. He&rsquo;d made sure everything was perfect, planned meticulously every detail to go into making sure you felt special on that evening. From candlelit dinners to your favourite movie to, inevitably, the moment you&rsquo;d both been waiting for. He&rsquo;d researched it a million times but nothing could compare. It was in the way his nerves felt as though they were trembling with every feeling possible. In the way his eyes couldn&rsquo;t manage to stay open but he was too adrenaline fueled to sleep. In the warm scent of your presence beside him. He was sure it was all a dream but the crystal clear senses coursing his veins made him certain that everything that had just happened had really just happened!</p><p>And then those words. Spoken in the sweetest, fatigue soaked voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Peter,&rdquo;</p><p>He felt as it rumbled into his chest from your resting on his bare torso. He felt the way it echoed quietly in his ears and settled the rushing blood for a moment of welcome bliss. He felt his hand hold you a little closer. He felt it all. </p><p>~~~</p><p>Tags: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0TMhQmFSJcVDo6Tz0pibIg\">@imarypayne</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTYhz8SAix2kAyx3S0sWHVA\">@sunshine112</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Fijx22baZx1OrZPZHHJQQ\">@bringmethehorizonandpizza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1YBDcBz6Q08BurkhU_q9rA\">@vibhati123</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIYTZTvm98ugq3dzvzdIvTA\">@butithasntkilledyouyet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOKErMb8y_XqH9PBurRosQ\">@faefictions</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfd423T9ymiK6auxtTnOsXA\">@carisi-sonny</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwdRp42HIty5X-EGSuEahGg\">@trap-house-homiecide</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msrO4TweMKVGo4q4irPtOAg\">@shamelessbookaddict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7raS9lsMcucctfWG5HpPdg\">@tommydaspidey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHK3bu1q5iOqXC1y9MhdF0A\">@oneblckcoffee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPI_5sIRuTeJ5F03Io2m_tA\">@darlingtholland</a> </p></p>",

She just wanted to be unnoticed for just a minute, so getting lost in the crowd wasn&rsquo;t such a bad idea in her mind. Her shoes, old, overused ones that were over worn and ripped by the original owners, squeaked to a stop as she reached her locker. </p><p>She pulled the sleeves of her ripped jacket up her arms and opened her locker. She took out a couple folders and notebooks from her backpack then put them in the metal box before her. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Y/N,&rdquo; Flash beckoned behind her as she rolled her eyes. Y/N slowly turned around with her shoulders slumped, &ldquo;what do you want Flash?&rdquo; She sounded so, defeated.</p><p>&ldquo;I love your jacket. Where&rsquo;d you get it, in the dumpster of Forever 21?&rdquo; Him and his buddies laughed as Y/N looked down and fiddled with the zipper of the jacket littered with holes. &ldquo;God I would give you money, but let&rsquo;s face it,&rdquo; the brunette chuckled as he set up his &lsquo;joke&rsquo;, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d probably just by drugs or some shit, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N sighed, biting her lip and refusing to look at the trio of asshats in front of her.</p><p>Peter Parker walked through the halls, music blaring in his headphones as he hurried to reach his locker. His steps slowed as he saw Flash and a few of his friends harassing some girl. His eyes went wide when he saw how sad and dejected she was. Annoyed, Peter approached the small group of teenagers.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Flash,&rdquo; Peter boldly intervened, &ldquo;just leave her alone. She didn&rsquo;t do anything to you.&rdquo; His eyes darted between the girl and the bully.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Parker here to save the day. Of course you&rsquo;d be friends with the hom-,&rdquo; he was interrupted by the bell. &ldquo;Well, see you in physics penis Parker.&rdquo; His friends laughed as they left with the heard of highschoolers around them.</p><p>Peter approached the girl with a worried look on his face. &ldquo;Hey, you alright?&rdquo; He was standing right in front of her now, finally able to take in her beauty. She smiled, &ldquo;Y-yeah. Thank you so much by the way, Flash can be such a dick.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled, &ldquo;I know right?&rdquo; </p><p>They stood in silence for a second, contentment apparent in both of their eyes &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Y/N and I have a feeling your name isn&rsquo;t Penis Parker.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s smile grew, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter actually. Peter Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>Months after that day, her and Peter were the best of friends. Ned and Michelle welcomed her into their little group with open arms. She was actually insanely happy at this point of her life. Despite complications with her home, she was overjoyed.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, um, do you wanna go to like Starbucks or something after school to study for exam week?&rdquo; Peter asked her as they threw away the cafeteria food that she got for free. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can go. I don&rsquo;t have any money on me.&rdquo; She blushed lightly, embarrassed by the fact.</p><p>Peter shrugged, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. It&rsquo;s on me.&rdquo; She looked at him with slightly wide eyes, &ldquo;you sure? I mean I don&rsquo;t wanna burden you.&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled his eyes, nudging her lightly as they walked back to their seats. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure! Anything for my favorite girl.&rdquo; He immediately covered his mouth with his hands. How could he possibly recover from something like that in front of such a pretty girl. </p><p>Y/N smiled, watching her shoes the tiles, &ldquo;Well thank you, my favorite boy.&rdquo; She walked a little bit ahead and went to sit across from Michelle. Peter stood there cracking his knuckles with a small smile on his face, &ldquo;awesome.&rdquo;</p><p>After school, Peter met her by her locker. &ldquo;Hey Y/N,&rdquo; he greeted as he leaned against the locker that was next to hers. She took a few things out an shoved them into her torn backpack, &ldquo;hey Peter.&rdquo; He fiddled with his hands, biting his lip and avoiding eye contact. He was still a bit uneasy after what he said a few hours ago. </p><p>Y/N shut her locker and put her arms through her backpack straps. &ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; Peter asked, while standing up properly. Y/N nodded and started walking to the door. They walked through the halls, their hands brushing against each other but neither of them moving to prevent it.</p><p>The two of them talked about random nothings as the walked to the nearest train station. Peter, being the kind boy he was, paid for both of their train tickets to get to the closest cafe. They sat next to each other while he told her of all the bad things Flash ever did to him, including that horrid moment at Liz&rsquo;s party last year.</p><p>After a few minutes of rambling, he felt her head lean against his shoulder. He looked over and saw that her eyes were closed and her breathing steadied. A smile graced his features as he wrapped his arm around the small of her back to keep her steady.</p><p>The women sitting across from them looked at the pair with a kind smile, &ldquo;You two make a cute couple.&rdquo; Peter looked up, mouth slightly open and eyes wide in shock as he pointed between himself and Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, um, we&rsquo;re just friends,&rdquo; he stumbled over his words out of embarrassment. Y/N leaned in further, her hand going to rest onto his chest. He chuckled nervously as the act did anything but prove him wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;Well you could&rsquo;ve fooled me,&rdquo; the women smiled and stood up as the train stopped, most likely leaving as this was her stop.</p><p>Peter sat there, admiring the girl who was currently using him as a pillow. Y/N opened her eyes when the train was about to stop. She looked at Peter who chuckled at her tiredness, &ldquo;hey sleepyhead.&rdquo; </p><p>She rubbed her eyes and groaned, &ldquo;shut up.&rdquo; The train halted so, Peter stood and grabbed her hand, &ldquo;come on. Don&rsquo;t wanna miss our stop.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/N slowly stood up, grabbing the backpack from her lap and pushing past the sea of strangers. </p><p>Again, the pair walked on the crowded New York streets as they tried to reach the nearest Starbucks. Once they got to the small shop, Peter opened the door for her, and a few others, before the two of them found a place to sit. </p><p>Y/N sat in the booth with a huff leaving her lips. &ldquo;I am not excited for next weeks exams.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter laughed at her comment, throwing his bag in the booth, and grabbing his wallet from the pocket of his jeans. &ldquo;Alright what do you want?&rdquo; </p><p>Y/N looked at him, &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ve never been here before.&rdquo;</p><p>A small, &ldquo;oh&rdquo; escaped Peter&rsquo;s lips as he made sure his debit card was in his wallet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just get you what I&rsquo;m getting. You good with that?&rdquo; Y/N nodded as Peter tapped his knuckles on the table, &ldquo;okay, I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p><p>A few minutes went by and Y/N had already set up all of her school stuff while Peter just returned with two drinks in his hand. &ldquo;Thank you so much, my favorite boy.&rdquo; He placed both of the drinks on the table, before sipping his and sitting down. He looked at her as his cheeks turned a bright red.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still doing this?&rdquo; Peter groaned, unzipping his bag and pulling out a few worksheets. Y/N sipped her drink, enjoying the sugary taste, &ldquo;yep.&rdquo; She gave him a small wink that made his blush deepen.</p><p>After a few hours of going over notes and helping each other with homework, they decided to call it a day. &ldquo;Do you want me to walk you back to your place?&rdquo; He asked as they were about to part ways in front of the coffee shop. </p><p>Y/N nodded her head and started walking towards the homeless shelter. They walked and complained about the 'dicks in New York not knowing what personal space was&rsquo; as Peter put it. The walked for about twenty minutes before they reached the big sign. </p><p>&ldquo;FEAST. Food, Emergency, Aid, Shelter, Training,&rdquo; Peter quietly read out loud as they stopped in front of the building.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, this is my stop,&rdquo; Y/N mumbled, playing with the rips in the sleeves of her shirt. &ldquo;Y-You live here?&rdquo; He stammered in wonder.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I thought you knew. I thought everyone knew.&rdquo; She avoided his eyes, messing with her hands. &ldquo;I just- I didn&rsquo;t expect this.&rdquo; His eyes finally met hers as they both turned to look at one another. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Flash was making fun of me the day we met. He always bullied me because I&rsquo;m homeless, but ever since you came around he hasn&rsquo;t bothered me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes softened, and he moved slightly closer to her. She gave a short smile, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re my hero, ya know?&rdquo; </p><p>Her eyes welled up with a few tears, &ldquo;ever since I met you, you&rsquo;ve made my life a thousand times better. Whenever I&rsquo;m around you, all i can do is smile.&rdquo;</p><p>He took her hands in his, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s cause I love seeing my favorite girl smile.&rdquo; Y/N looked down, taking one of her hands out of his to wipe the tears from her eyes. &ldquo;Y/N, you mean so much to me. Every time I look at you it&rsquo;s like my heart is about to burst out of my chest. God, how did I get so lucky to meet someone as awesome as you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I please kiss you?&rdquo; Peter breathed as each breath became more uneven. Before he received an answer, Y/N placed her hands on his cheeks and leaned up to finally let their lips meet. The faint taste of coffee was apparent on both of their lips as Peter moved his hands onto her hips. He pulled away for air, their foreheads leaning against one another as he caught his breath. </p><p>&ldquo;See you at school tomorrow?&rdquo; She questioned, pulling away and moving her hands to his neck. He absentmindedly nodded his head, &ldquo;yeah. Yeah awesome.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/N giggled, stepping away and giving him a quick peck on his cheek. &ldquo;Goodbye, my favorite boy.&rdquo;</p><p>The next day at school Y/N found Peter at his locker and wrapped her hand around his. &ldquo;Will you be my girlfriend?&rdquo; Peter blurted out, making Y/N giggle. &ldquo;Of course, my favorite boy.&rdquo; They went through their day, meeting in between classes as often as they could.</p><p>Every day after school, Peter would go do his 'Stark internship&rsquo; thing while Y/N would walk back to the center. One day, a few months into their relationship, Y/N went to the cafeteria of the center to talk with one of her friends there when she saw Peter loading boxes into the kitchen.</p><p>Shocked, Y/N when in to make sure that her mind wasn&rsquo;t playing tricks on her. And sure enough, it was her favorite brunet boy. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; She questioned. He stood up and turned around, a smile appearing as he saw who it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Y/N.&rdquo; He dusted his hands onto his jeans and approached her. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; She asked, looking behind him and at the boxes filled with food. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I decided to start volunteering here.&rdquo; He grabbed her hand into his and started swinging them slightly back and forth. &ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; Y/N asked in awe. Peter chuckled, &ldquo;yeah. Gotta help out the people of New York.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N wrapped her arms around his torso, her face going into his chest. &ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; she whispered. Peter took a small step back in shock at her actions, before wrapping his arms around her back. &ldquo;Anything for my favorite girl.&rdquo;</p><p><b>hope you enjoyed the ps4 reference :))</b></p>",

His steps slowed as he saw Flash and a few of his friends harassing some girl. His eyes went wide when he saw how sad and dejected she was. Annoyed, Peter approached the small group of teenagers.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cFlash,\u201d Peter boldly intervened, \u201cjust leave her alone. She didn\u2019t do anything to you.\u201d His eyes darted between the girl and the bully.</p><p>\u201cAh, Parker here to save the day. Of course you\u2019d be friends with the hom-,\u201d he was interrupted by the bell. \u201cWell, see you in physics penis Parker.\u201d His friends laughed as they left with the heard of highschoolers around them.</p><p>Peter approached the girl with a worried look on his face. \u201cHey, you alright?\u201d He was standing right in front of her now, finally able to take in her beauty. She smiled, \u201cY-yeah. Thank you so much by the way, Flash can be such a dick.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cI know right?\u201d </p><p>They stood in silence for a second, contentment apparent in both of their eyes \u201cI\u2019m Y/N and I have a feeling your name isn\u2019t Penis Parker.\u201d Peter\u2019s smile grew, \u201cI\u2019m Peter actually. Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>Months after that day, her and Peter were the best of friends. Ned and Michelle welcomed her into their little group with open arms. She was actually insanely happy at this point of her life. Despite complications with her home, she was overjoyed.</p><p>\u201cHey, um, do you wanna go to like Starbucks or something after school to study for exam week?\u201d Peter asked her as they threw away the cafeteria food that she got for free. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can go. I don\u2019t have any money on me.\u201d She blushed lightly, embarrassed by the fact.</p><p>Peter shrugged, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s on me.\u201d She looked at him with slightly wide eyes, \u201cyou sure? I mean I don\u2019t wanna burden you.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, nudging her lightly as they walked back to their seats. \u201cOf course I\u2019m sure! Anything for my favorite girl.\u201d He immediately covered his mouth with his hands. How could he possibly recover from something like that in front of such a pretty girl. </p><p>Y/N smiled, watching her shoes the tiles, \u201cWell thank you, my favorite boy.\u201d She walked a little bit ahead and went to sit across from Michelle. Peter stood there cracking his knuckles with a small smile on his face, \u201cawesome.\u201d</p><p>After school, Peter met her by her locker. \u201cHey Y/N,\u201d he greeted as he leaned against the locker that was next to hers. She took a few things out an shoved them into her torn backpack, \u201chey Peter.\u201d He fiddled with his hands, biting his lip and avoiding eye contact. He was still a bit uneasy after what he said a few hours ago. </p><p>Y/N shut her locker and put her arms through her backpack straps. \u201cYou ready?\u201d Peter asked, while standing up properly. Y/N nodded and started walking to the door. They walked through the halls, their hands brushing against each other but neither of them moving to prevent it.</p><p>The two of them talked about random nothings as the walked to the nearest train station. Peter, being the kind boy he was, paid for both of their train tickets to get to the closest cafe. They sat next to each other while he told her of all the bad things Flash ever did to him, including that horrid moment at Liz\u2019s party last year.</p><p>After a few minutes of rambling, he felt her head lean against his shoulder. He looked over and saw that her eyes were closed and her breathing steadied. A smile graced his features as he wrapped his arm around the small of her back to keep her steady.</p><p>The women sitting across from them looked at the pair with a kind smile, \u201cYou two make a cute couple.\u201d Peter looked up, mouth slightly open and eyes wide in shock as he pointed between himself and Y/N.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, we\u2019re just friends,\u201d he stumbled over his words out of embarrassment. Y/N leaned in further, her hand going to rest onto his chest. He chuckled nervously as the act did anything but prove him wrong.</p><p>\u201cWell you could\u2019ve fooled me,\u201d the women smiled and stood up as the train stopped, most likely leaving as this was her stop.</p><p>Peter sat there, admiring the girl who was currently using him as a pillow. Y/N opened her eyes when the train was about to stop. She looked at Peter who chuckled at her tiredness, \u201chey sleepyhead.\u201d </p><p>She rubbed her eyes and groaned, \u201cshut up.\u201d The train halted so, Peter stood and grabbed her hand, \u201ccome on. Don\u2019t wanna miss our stop.\u201d </p><p>Y/N slowly stood up, grabbing the backpack from her lap and pushing past the sea of strangers. </p><p>Again, the pair walked on the crowded New York streets as they tried to reach the nearest Starbucks. Once they got to the small shop, Peter opened the door for her, and a few others, before the two of them found a place to sit. </p><p>Y/N sat in the booth with a huff leaving her lips. \u201cI am not excited for next weeks exams.\u201d </p><p>Peter laughed at her comment, throwing his bag in the booth, and grabbing his wallet from the pocket of his jeans. \u201cAlright what do you want?\u201d </p><p>Y/N looked at him, \u201cI-I\u2019ve never been here before.\u201d</p><p>A small, \u201coh\u201d escaped Peter\u2019s lips as he made sure his debit card was in his wallet. \u201cI\u2019ll just get you what I\u2019m getting. You good with that?\u201d Y/N nodded as Peter tapped his knuckles on the table, \u201cokay, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes went by and Y/N had already set up all of her school stuff while Peter just returned with two drinks in his hand. \u201cThank you so much, my favorite boy.\u201d He placed both of the drinks on the table, before sipping his and sitting down.

She didn\u2019t do anything to you.\u201d His eyes darted between the girl and the bully.</p><p>\u201cAh, Parker here to save the day. Of course you\u2019d be friends with the hom-,\u201d he was interrupted by the bell. \u201cWell, see you in physics penis Parker.\u201d His friends laughed as they left with the heard of highschoolers around them.</p><p>Peter approached the girl with a worried look on his face. \u201cHey, you alright?\u201d He was standing right in front of her now, finally able to take in her beauty. She smiled, \u201cY-yeah. Thank you so much by the way, Flash can be such a dick.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cI know right?\u201d </p><p>They stood in silence for a second, contentment apparent in both of their eyes \u201cI\u2019m Y/N and I have a feeling your name isn\u2019t Penis Parker.\u201d Peter\u2019s smile grew, \u201cI\u2019m Peter actually. Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>Months after that day, her and Peter were the best of friends. Ned and Michelle welcomed her into their little group with open arms. She was actually insanely happy at this point of her life. Despite complications with her home, she was overjoyed.</p><p>\u201cHey, um, do you wanna go to like Starbucks or something after school to study for exam week?\u201d Peter asked her as they threw away the cafeteria food that she got for free. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can go. I don\u2019t have any money on me.\u201d She blushed lightly, embarrassed by the fact.</p><p>Peter shrugged, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s on me.\u201d She looked at him with slightly wide eyes, \u201cyou sure? I mean I don\u2019t wanna burden you.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, nudging her lightly as they walked back to their seats. \u201cOf course I\u2019m sure! Anything for my favorite girl.\u201d He immediately covered his mouth with his hands. How could he possibly recover from something like that in front of such a pretty girl. </p><p>Y/N smiled, watching her shoes the tiles, \u201cWell thank you, my favorite boy.\u201d She walked a little bit ahead and went to sit across from Michelle. Peter stood there cracking his knuckles with a small smile on his face, \u201cawesome.\u201d</p><p>After school, Peter met her by her locker. \u201cHey Y/N,\u201d he greeted as he leaned against the locker that was next to hers. She took a few things out an shoved them into her torn backpack, \u201chey Peter.\u201d He fiddled with his hands, biting his lip and avoiding eye contact. He was still a bit uneasy after what he said a few hours ago. </p><p>Y/N shut her locker and put her arms through her backpack straps. \u201cYou ready?\u201d Peter asked, while standing up properly. Y/N nodded and started walking to the door. They walked through the halls, their hands brushing against each other but neither of them moving to prevent it.</p><p>The two of them talked about random nothings as the walked to the nearest train station. Peter, being the kind boy he was, paid for both of their train tickets to get to the closest cafe. They sat next to each other while he told her of all the bad things Flash ever did to him, including that horrid moment at Liz\u2019s party last year.</p><p>After a few minutes of rambling, he felt her head lean against his shoulder. He looked over and saw that her eyes were closed and her breathing steadied. A smile graced his features as he wrapped his arm around the small of her back to keep her steady.</p><p>The women sitting across from them looked at the pair with a kind smile, \u201cYou two make a cute couple.\u201d Peter looked up, mouth slightly open and eyes wide in shock as he pointed between himself and Y/N.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, we\u2019re just friends,\u201d he stumbled over his words out of embarrassment. Y/N leaned in further, her hand going to rest onto his chest. He chuckled nervously as the act did anything but prove him wrong.</p><p>\u201cWell you could\u2019ve fooled me,\u201d the women smiled and stood up as the train stopped, most likely leaving as this was her stop.</p><p>Peter sat there, admiring the girl who was currently using him as a pillow. Y/N opened her eyes when the train was about to stop. She looked at Peter who chuckled at her tiredness, \u201chey sleepyhead.\u201d </p><p>She rubbed her eyes and groaned, \u201cshut up.\u201d The train halted so, Peter stood and grabbed her hand, \u201ccome on. Don\u2019t wanna miss our stop.\u201d </p><p>Y/N slowly stood up, grabbing the backpack from her lap and pushing past the sea of strangers. </p><p>Again, the pair walked on the crowded New York streets as they tried to reach the nearest Starbucks. Once they got to the small shop, Peter opened the door for her, and a few others, before the two of them found a place to sit. </p><p>Y/N sat in the booth with a huff leaving her lips. \u201cI am not excited for next weeks exams.\u201d </p><p>Peter laughed at her comment, throwing his bag in the booth, and grabbing his wallet from the pocket of his jeans. \u201cAlright what do you want?\u201d </p><p>Y/N looked at him, \u201cI-I\u2019ve never been here before.\u201d</p><p>A small, \u201coh\u201d escaped Peter\u2019s lips as he made sure his debit card was in his wallet. \u201cI\u2019ll just get you what I\u2019m getting. You good with that?\u201d Y/N nodded as Peter tapped his knuckles on the table, \u201cokay, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes went by and Y/N had already set up all of her school stuff while Peter just returned with two drinks in his hand. \u201cThank you so much, my favorite boy.\u201d He placed both of the drinks on the table, before sipping his and sitting down. He looked at her as his cheeks turned a bright red.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still doing this?\u201d Peter groaned, unzipping his bag and pulling out a few worksheets. Y/N sipped her drink, enjoying the sugary taste, \u201cyep.\u201d She gave him a small wink that made his blush deepen.</p><p>After a few hours of going over notes and helping each other with homework, they decided to call it a day. \u201cDo you want me to walk you back to your place?\u201d He asked as they were about to part ways in front of the coffee shop. </p><p>Y/N nodded her head and started walking towards the homeless shelter. They walked and complained about the 'dicks in New York not knowing what personal space was\u2019 as Peter put it. The walked for about twenty minutes before they reached the big sign. </p><p>\u201cFEAST. Food, Emergency, Aid, Shelter, Training,\u201d Peter quietly read out loud as they stopped in front of the building.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is my stop,\u201d Y/N mumbled, playing with the rips in the sleeves of her shirt. \u201cY-You live here?\u201d He stammered in wonder.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I thought you knew. I thought everyone knew.\u201d She avoided his eyes, messing with her hands. \u201cI just- I didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d His eyes finally met hers as they both turned to look at one another. \u201cThat\u2019s why Flash was making fun of me the day we met. He always bullied me because I\u2019m homeless, but ever since you came around he hasn\u2019t bothered me.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes softened, and he moved slightly closer to her. She gave a short smile, \u201cyou\u2019re my hero, ya know?\u201d </p><p>Her eyes welled up with a few tears, \u201cever since I met you, you\u2019ve made my life a thousand times better. Whenever I\u2019m around you, all i can do is smile.\u201d</p><p>He took her hands in his, \u201cit\u2019s cause I love seeing my favorite girl smile.\u201d Y/N looked down, taking one of her hands out of his to wipe the tears from her eyes. \u201cY/N, you mean so much to me. Every time I look at you it\u2019s like my heart is about to burst out of my chest. God, how did I get so lucky to meet someone as awesome as you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I please kiss you?\u201d Peter breathed as each breath became more uneven. Before he received an answer, Y/N placed her hands on his cheeks and leaned up to finally let their lips meet. The faint taste of coffee was apparent on both of their lips as Peter moved his hands onto her hips. He pulled away for air, their foreheads leaning against one another as he caught his breath. </p><p>\u201cSee you at school tomorrow?\u201d She questioned, pulling away and moving her hands to his neck. He absentmindedly nodded his head, \u201cyeah. Yeah awesome.\u201d </p><p>Y/N giggled, stepping away and giving him a quick peck on his cheek. \u201cGoodbye, my favorite boy.\u201d</p><p>The next day at school Y/N found Peter at his locker and wrapped her hand around his. \u201cWill you be my girlfriend?\u201d Peter blurted out, making Y/N giggle. \u201cOf course, my favorite boy.\u201d They went through their day, meeting in between classes as often as they could.</p><p>Every day after school, Peter would go do his 'Stark internship\u2019 thing while Y/N would walk back to the center. One day, a few months into their relationship, Y/N went to the cafeteria of the center to talk with one of her friends there when she saw Peter loading boxes into the kitchen.</p><p>Shocked, Y/N when in to make sure that her mind wasn\u2019t playing tricks on her. And sure enough, it was her favorite brunet boy. \u201cPeter?\u201d She questioned. He stood up and turned around, a smile appearing as he saw who it was.</p><p>\u201cHey Y/N.\u201d He dusted his hands onto his jeans and approached her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She asked, looking behind him and at the boxes filled with food. </p><p>\u201cWell, I decided to start volunteering here.\u201d He grabbed her hand into his and started swinging them slightly back and forth. \u201cSeriously?\u201d Y/N asked in awe. Peter chuckled, \u201cyeah. Gotta help out the people of New York.\u201d</p><p>Y/N wrapped her arms around his torso, her face going into his chest. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d she whispered. Peter took a small step back in shock at her actions, before wrapping his arms around her back. \u201cAnything for my favorite girl.\u201d</p><p><b>hope you enjoyed the ps4 reference :))</b></p></p>",

Where&rsquo;d you get it, in the dumpster of Forever 21?&rdquo; Him and his buddies laughed as Y/N looked down and fiddled with the zipper of the jacket littered with holes. &ldquo;God I would give you money, but let&rsquo;s face it,&rdquo; the brunette chuckled as he set up his &lsquo;joke&rsquo;, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d probably just by drugs or some shit, right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Y/N sighed, biting her lip and refusing to look at the trio of asshats in front of her.</p>\n<p>Peter Parker walked through the halls, music blaring in his headphones as he hurried to reach his locker.

She holds a manila folder out to Tony.</p><p>\u201cYeah, put it down over there, I&rsquo;ll look at it later,\u201d the engineer replies, barely glancing up from the wires he&rsquo;s fiddling with under a magnifying glass. \u201cAnd toss me the Advil bottle from the cupboard, will ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u00b4re burning through these way too fast,\u201d Pepper observes while setting the nearly empty bottle on the table in front of him. \u201cExactly how light are these \u2018light headaches\u2019 you&rsquo;ve been getting?\u201d </p><p>Tony ignores her in favour of throwing down two painkillers in a fluid motion. He massages his closed eyes with his thumb and index finger, a scrunched look on his face, before blinking hard a few times and focusing back on the magnifying glass. None of this escapes Pepper&rsquo;s notice.</p><p>\u201cI want you to look at that document for me,\u201d she orders. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan&rsquo;t I have one hour to work in peace?

You pulled that trick on Peter yesterday, it won\u2019t work with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you that?\u201d Tony huffs. \u201cThink I&rsquo;m gonna have to fire him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, he&rsquo;s an intern of Stark Industries, which happens to be a company controlled by me, so decisions about his contract are under my jurisdiction. Now read that out to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I feel like it was a mistake to promote you,\u201d Tony grumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re getting too used to being in power.\u201d</p><p>He takes the sheet of paper from the folder and squints at it. Then he pushes it away at arm&rsquo;s length and squints even harder. \u201cYou know that I can\u2019t read French, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s English, Tony.\u201d Pepper snatches the document out of his hand. \u201cAnd you just proved my point. You have an appointment with the optician this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s ridiculous. I don&rsquo;t need reading glasses. I&rsquo;ve got Friday, I&rsquo;ve got you and the kid. I&rsquo;m totally fine to work without <i>prosthesis</i>,\u201d he argues. \u201cOh, fuck.\u201d</p><p>One of the wires under his fingers has started to spark. He uses the sleeve of his already grease-stained sweatshirt to extinguish it.</p><p>\u201c3:00 pm, Friday knows the address,\u201d Pepper continues. \u201cYou should take a shower before you show yourself in public. Oh, and Peter will be accompanying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- what? Pep, that&rsquo;s not fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve got a meeting. And the boy has certain skills that he promised to use in order to ensure you won&rsquo;t sneak out of the shop. Thank me later.\u201d Pepper gives him a sweet, deceptively innocent smile. She presses a kiss onto the clean side of his cheeks before turning around and walking off.</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re an evil, evil woman, Miss Potts,\u201d Tony mutters as he watches her leave.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI look <i>old</i>. I&rsquo;m not old, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Peter only offers an exasperated sigh, biting back the very tempting \u2018Yes, you are\u2019 \u00a0that&rsquo;s sitting on the tip of his tongue.</p><p>It&rsquo;s early evening. There&rsquo;s a heap of discarded frames the size of a small iceberg next to Tony. The third shop assistant attending to them this day is trying to mask her growing desperation while two others are snoring behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cThey look just like your sunglasses, Mr. Stark, and you never have a problem wearing them.\u201d</p><p>Peter had been delighted when Pepper had called him for a \u201cspecial mission\u201d the other day, looking forward to spending time with Tony outside the workshop. But he probably should have guessed from the hint of guilt in Pepper&rsquo;s eyes that this was not going to be an easy mission.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s not the same. These aren\u2019t sunglasses, and I know it. I can <i>feel</i> the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s sort of the point, isn&rsquo;t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t be a smartass, kid.\u201d Tony&rsquo;s tired eyes narrow at Peter, which would be sort of threatening if it weren&rsquo;t for the bright purple spectacles currently balanced on his nose.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I liked those simple black frames, but you said they were too ooooordinary,\u201d Peter pronounces, stretching out the vowel as he breaks into a yawn.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try those again,\u201d Tony deliberates, then looks a little helplessly at the startling number of discarded models surrounding him. \u201cUhm, where did I put them?\u201d</p><p>While the shop assistant jumps in to prevent Tony from further increasing the chaos, Peter gets up from the chair to stretch his legs. He tries on a pair of half-moon glasses and stands in front of the mirror. <br/></p><p>\u201cThose who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it,\u201c he imitates in a deep voice, then pauses when something catches his eye.</p><p>\u201cOh wow, they still make these!\u201d he blurts out, dropping the Dumbledore frames and striding over to the kids&rsquo; section.</p><p>On a small, colourfully-painted rack, a number of superhero-themed glasses are displayed. There&rsquo;s a pair with small wings on each side that look like miniature versions of those mounted on Thor&rsquo;s helmet, one with stars all over the frame in Captain-America themed colours, and a red one with golden screws that remotely resembles the Iron Man armour. Below all of them, there&rsquo;s a pair of specs with the unmistakable pattern of a spider web crisscrossing the red and blue frame.</p><p>\u201cThey made Spider-Man glasses,\u201d Peter whispers, completely awe-struck.</p><p>\u201cI know I said I&rsquo;m not old, but I&rsquo;m definitely too old for <i>those</i>,\u201d Tony remarks from behind his shoulder. Peter turns around. There&rsquo;s a sober-looking black framed pair sitting on his mentor&rsquo;s nose and a nearly identical one shoved up to his forehead. A third pair of glasses is dangling from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo, it&rsquo;s just-\u201d Peter steps away from the shelf, suddenly a little embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s just what? The stunning ability of capitalism to churn out endless variations of the very same product in order to convince customers they\u2019re buying something different? The marketisation of people with special powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot - not exactly.\u201d Peter blinks, slightly confused.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to wear these when I was little,\u201d Peter admits, pointing at the Iron Man frame. \u201cBefore the bite, my eyesight was so bad that I couldn&rsquo;t even make out my own toes when I was standing. I got my first glasses when I was three, and I guess it&rsquo;s easier to convince a kid to wear them when you can claim that they give him superpowers.

Well, that&rsquo;s&hellip;.spectacular.\u201d Tony raises his eyebrows in a mocking gesture, but his expression goes a little soft. \u201cI guess my father could have learned something from your aunt&rsquo;s parenting skills.\u201d</p><p>He turns away before Peter can think of something to say.</p><p>\u201cCome here, kid,\u201d Tony calls over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve compiled a top ten, if you wanna give me a hand\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>A few days later, Dum-E and U get into an argument that ends with U setting a bunch of papers on fire in an attempt to offer an apology to Dum-E, who extinguishes the flames with loud chirps of joy.

She holds a manila folder out to Tony.</p><p>\u201cYeah, put it down over there, I\u2019ll look at it later,\u201d the engineer replies, barely glancing up from the wires he\u2019s fiddling with under a magnifying glass. \u201cAnd toss me the Advil bottle from the cupboard, will ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u00b4re burning through these way too fast,\u201d Pepper observes while setting the nearly empty bottle on the table in front of him. \u201cExactly how light are these \u2018light headaches\u2019 you\u2019ve been getting?\u201d </p><p>Tony ignores her in favour of throwing down two painkillers in a fluid motion. He massages his closed eyes with his thumb and index finger, a scrunched look on his face, before blinking hard a few times and focusing back on the magnifying glass. None of this escapes Pepper\u2019s notice.</p><p>\u201cI want you to look at that document for me,\u201d she orders. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I have one hour to work in peace? Put it on the table over there\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have FRIDAY scan it and read it out loud. You pulled that trick on Peter yesterday, it won\u2019t work with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you that?\u201d Tony huffs. \u201cThink I\u2019m gonna have to fire him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, he\u2019s an intern of Stark Industries, which happens to be a company controlled by me, so decisions about his contract are under my jurisdiction. Now read that out to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I feel like it was a mistake to promote you,\u201d Tony grumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re getting too used to being in power.\u201d</p><p>He takes the sheet of paper from the folder and squints at it. Then he pushes it away at arm\u2019s length and squints even harder. \u201cYou know that I can\u2019t read French, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s English, Tony.\u201d Pepper snatches the document out of his hand. \u201cAnd you just proved my point. You have an appointment with the optician this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t need reading glasses. I\u2019ve got Friday, I\u2019ve got you and the kid. I\u2019m totally fine to work without <i>prosthesis</i>,\u201d he argues. \u201cOh, fuck.\u201d</p><p>One of the wires under his fingers has started to spark. He uses the sleeve of his already grease-stained sweatshirt to extinguish it.</p><p>\u201c3:00 pm, Friday knows the address,\u201d Pepper continues. \u201cYou should take a shower before you show yourself in public. Oh, and Peter will be accompanying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- what? Pep, that\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a meeting. And the boy has certain skills that he promised to use in order to ensure you won\u2019t sneak out of the shop. Thank me later.\u201d Pepper gives him a sweet, deceptively innocent smile. She presses a kiss onto the clean side of his cheeks before turning around and walking off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an evil, evil woman, Miss Potts,\u201d Tony mutters as he watches her leave.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI look <i>old</i>. I\u2019m not old, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Peter only offers an exasperated sigh, biting back the very tempting \u2018Yes, you are\u2019 \u00a0that\u2019s sitting on the tip of his tongue.</p><p>It\u2019s early evening. There\u2019s a heap of discarded frames the size of a small iceberg next to Tony. The third shop assistant attending to them this day is trying to mask her growing desperation while two others are snoring behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cThey look just like your sunglasses, Mr. Stark, and you never have a problem wearing them.\u201d</p><p>Peter had been delighted when Pepper had called him for a \u201cspecial mission\u201d the other day, looking forward to spending time with Tony outside the workshop. But he probably should have guessed from the hint of guilt in Pepper\u2019s eyes that this was not going to be an easy mission.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same. These aren\u2019t sunglasses, and I know it. I can <i>feel</i> the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sort of the point, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a smartass, kid.\u201d Tony\u2019s tired eyes narrow at Peter, which would be sort of threatening if it weren\u2019t for the bright purple spectacles currently balanced on his nose.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I liked those simple black frames, but you said they were too ooooordinary,\u201d Peter pronounces, stretching out the vowel as he breaks into a yawn.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Maybe I\u2019ll try those again,\u201d Tony deliberates, then looks a little helplessly at the startling number of discarded models surrounding him. \u201cUhm, where did I put them?\u201d</p><p>While the shop assistant jumps in to prevent Tony from further increasing the chaos, Peter gets up from the chair to stretch his legs. He tries on a pair of half-moon glasses and stands in front of the mirror. <br></p><p>\u201cThose who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it,\u201c he imitates in a deep voice, then pauses when something catches his eye.</p><p>\u201cOh wow, they still make these!\u201d he blurts out, dropping the Dumbledore frames and striding over to the kids\u2019 section.</p><p>On a small, colourfully-painted rack, a number of superhero-themed glasses are displayed. There\u2019s a pair with small wings on each side that look like miniature versions of those mounted on Thor\u2019s helmet, one with stars all over the frame in Captain-America themed colours, and a red one with golden screws that remotely resembles the Iron Man armour. Below all of them, there\u2019s a pair of specs with the unmistakable pattern of a spider web crisscrossing the red and blue frame.</p><p>\u201cThey made Spider-Man glasses,\u201d Peter whispers, completely awe-struck.</p><p>\u201cI know I said I\u2019m not old, but I\u2019m definitely too old for <i>those</i>,\u201d Tony remarks from behind his shoulder. Peter turns around. There\u2019s a sober-looking black framed pair sitting on his mentor\u2019s nose and a nearly identical one shoved up to his forehead. A third pair of glasses is dangling from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just-\u201d Peter steps away from the shelf, suddenly a little embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just what? The stunning ability of capitalism to churn out endless variations of the very same product in order to convince customers they\u2019re buying something different? The marketisation of people with special powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot - not exactly.\u201d Peter blinks, slightly confused.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to wear these when I was little,\u201d Peter admits, pointing at the Iron Man frame. \u201cBefore the bite, my eyesight was so bad that I couldn\u2019t even make out my own toes when I was standing. I got my first glasses when I was three, and I guess it\u2019s easier to convince a kid to wear them when you can claim that they give him superpowers. At least that\u2019s what my aunt used to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuperpowered glasses? Well, that\u2019s\u2026.spectacular.\u201d Tony raises his eyebrows in a mocking gesture, but his expression goes a little soft. \u201cI guess my father could have learned something from your aunt\u2019s parenting skills.\u201d</p><p>He turns away before Peter can think of something to say.</p><p>\u201cCome here, kid,\u201d Tony calls over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve compiled a top ten, if you wanna give me a hand\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>A few days later, Dum-E and U get into an argument that ends with U setting a bunch of papers on fire in an attempt to offer an apology to Dum-E, who extinguishes the flames with loud chirps of joy. When Tony skims through the smoldering remains of the documents, the one Pepper gave him to read falls into his hands.</p><p>With a grimace, he pulls the newly-acquired reading glasses from the explosion-proof safe in which Peter has deposited them with admirable foresight.</p><p>In the middle of the paper, one sentence is written in tiny letters: \u201cProof that Pepper Potts always knows best.\u201d</p>",
