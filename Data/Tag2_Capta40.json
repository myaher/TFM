(this is only part one of this btw!)</b></p><p><b>Warnings: swearing, mild reference to sexual assault (just a drunk asshole), suggestive themes, gender neutral reader</b></p><p><b>[THIS IS IN A UNIVERSE WHERE THE EVENTS OF ENDGAME DON\u2019T HAPPEN]</b></p><p><b>Word Count: 1183</b></p><p>This felt like the longest mission ever. Traces of HYDRA activity had started to pop up in random bursts on the Avengers\u2019 radars over the last several months, and tonight was the culmination to weeks of preparation and intel collection on your part. All that was left to do was infiltrate the gala which was disguising an illegal weapons trading ring. Easier said than done, apparently.<br/></p><p>You sat silently, leaning against the bar and nursing yet another lemonade while you scanned the room and listened intently for any sign of conflict. It was getting harder and harder to keep your focus, however, as the only thing on your mind was a certain Captain. The interaction between you two before you\u2019d left kept replaying in your head as your eyes once again swept the room and expertly avoided her gaze.</p><p><i>You barely heard the door of your room open as you put your earpiece in and took a deep breath, mentally preparing yourself for a long evening. Carol\u2019s satiny voice startled you,</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, Y/N, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have a necklace that goes with this dress by any chance?\u201d she asked hopefully. </i></p><p><i>Her face twisted and she let out a musical laugh at your reaction to her sneaking up on you. After your initial shock, you were able to look her up and down properly; and continue to struggle as you hardly managed to keep your jaw off the ground. She looked gorgeous. The white gown she was wearing hugged her in all the right places as your eyes followed her silhouette to the floor. You weren\u2019t used to seeing Carol like this; being more acquainted with her Captain uniform and covered in dirt or dust from missions on faraway planets. The golden belt cinched around her waist immediately lit a lightbulb in your brain and you turned to rummage through your jewellery box. A moment later, you pulled the golden necklace from the box. Turning back to Carol, you didn\u2019t expect her to be as close as she was, causing a light blush to rise to your cheeks.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHere\u2019s, um- here\u2019s one,\u201d you stammered. Carol\u2019s eyes met yours and her signature smirk spread across her features as she cocked her head.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt looks great. Do you mind?\u201d she asked, turning around and lifting her hair away from her neck. As she turned, you heartbeat sped up with the realisation that the dress was completely backless, revealing the woman\u2019s taut muscles. Your cheeks burned and your hands trembled as they came up to her neck and fastened the necklace in place. </i></p><p><i>Carol turned back around and somehow, looked even better with such a small touch to her appearance.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThanks. I hate missions like this. Having to schmooze old men to get information out of them. It makes me feel so cheap,\u201d she admitted with a roll of her shining hazel eyes.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, if it makes you feel any better, I hate them too. Wearing a dress and having to be someone I\u2019m not for the night. Suppose it has its benefits though; at least I get to see you looking like that, Captain,\u201d you shot back, not meaning for it to come out as flirty as it did. The air in the room suddenly became heavy and Carol\u2019s gaze changed as she got impossibly closer to you. Here you were, basically nose-to-nose with the strongest Avenger and you had never wanted to kiss anyone more. Your breath hitched in your throat when you saw her tongue dart out across her bottom lip. An incessant banging on your bedroom door interrupted the moment, an even more incessant voice on the other side.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time for flirting later, you two! It\u2019s time to move!\u201d Clint boomed.</i></p><p>A voice cutting through your earpiece brought you back to the ballroom. Whom else\u2019s voice, of course, than Carol fucking Danvers\u2019 smooth register. </p><p>\u201cY/N, need a little help here. This guy\u2019s getting a little handsy and I barely convinced him to go get more drinks,\u201d she said rapidly. Your response was immediate as you quickly made your way across the room to seek out Carol and act like her drunk best friend.</p><p>\u201cHeyyyyy,\u201d you slurred at Carol just as the man came back. She made a quick escape and led you both away to the bathroom. The plan had to be thorough enough to be believable, after all.

After your initial shock, you were able to look her up and down properly; and continue to struggle as you hardly managed to keep your jaw off the ground. She looked gorgeous. The white gown she was wearing hugged her in all the right places as your eyes followed her silhouette to the floor. You weren\u2019t used to seeing Carol like this; being more acquainted with her Captain uniform and covered in dirt or dust from missions on faraway planets. The golden belt cinched around her waist immediately lit a lightbulb in your brain and you turned to rummage through your jewellery box. A moment later, you pulled the golden necklace from the box. Turning back to Carol, you didn\u2019t expect her to be as close as she was, causing a light blush to rise to your cheeks.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHere\u2019s, um- here\u2019s one,\u201d you stammered. Carol\u2019s eyes met yours and her signature smirk spread across her features as she cocked her head.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt looks great. Do you mind?\u201d she asked, turning around and lifting her hair away from her neck. As she turned, you heartbeat sped up with the realisation that the dress was completely backless, revealing the woman\u2019s taut muscles. Your cheeks burned and your hands trembled as they came up to her neck and fastened the necklace in place. </i></p><p><i>Carol turned back around and somehow, looked even better with such a small touch to her appearance.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThanks. I hate missions like this. Having to schmooze old men to get information out of them. It makes me feel so cheap,\u201d she admitted with a roll of her shining hazel eyes.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, if it makes you feel any better, I hate them too. Wearing a dress and having to be someone I\u2019m not for the night. Suppose it has its benefits though; at least I get to see you looking like that, Captain,\u201d you shot back, not meaning for it to come out as flirty as it did. The air in the room suddenly became heavy and Carol\u2019s gaze changed as she got impossibly closer to you. Here you were, basically nose-to-nose with the strongest Avenger and you had never wanted to kiss anyone more. Your breath hitched in your throat when you saw her tongue dart out across her bottom lip. An incessant banging on your bedroom door interrupted the moment, an even more incessant voice on the other side.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time for flirting later, you two! It\u2019s time to move!\u201d Clint boomed.</i></p><p>A voice cutting through your earpiece brought you back to the ballroom.

        "body": "<p>Fandom: Captain Marvel <br/>\nCharacters: Talos, Carol<br/>\nRelationship: Talos/reader <br/>\nRequest: have you seen the new captain marvel movie? I really want to see what you would do with a Talos request. </p>\n\n<p>You sat at the console, watching Carol as she flew in front. She would be getting tired and would need to stop soon, but not quite yet. She could return to the ship and enter through a bay at the back which would close and inside door to open the outside one for her to come in. Once she was inside, it would swap and close the outside one then open the inside. this would allow her to enter the ship and leave when she desired. <br/>\nMost of the Skrull were fast asleep throughout the ship apart from one or two who were still a little on edge about everything. <br/>\nYou had decided to help them find a home along with Carol. She was your sister, and the thought of losing her again made your stomach twist horribly in your stomach. After her disappearance, you rose through the ranks and ended up working with Fury. You had been there from the start, you had seen all this unfold and watched in disbelief as your sister not only rose from the grave but also in a ball of fire. <br/>\nYou had been there when you all entered Lawsons ship and reunited Talos with his sister and niece. <br/>\nWhen the time had come for her to leave, she offered you to come with her. Fury had agreed, saying that there was going to be a shift in the whole galaxy, and he would need someone he could trust. And so, here you were. <br/>\nleaning back in the seat, your eyes skimmed the empty space around you, wondering where she was leading you all. <br/>\nYou heard the door to the room open and looked over to see Talos enter. He smiled and nodded to greet you which you returned. <br/>\n\u201cYou should be asleep.\u201d His voice was deep and a little gruff as he walked over and sat at the control panel next to you. <br/>\n\u201cprobably.\u201d You agree with a chuckle. \u201cbut I cant.\u201d <br/>\nyou looked at the Skrull who sat next to you. The first time you had seen him, you had felt anger and hate for him and his kind. But you had been misinformed like some many others. When your alliances changed, you began to look at him more kindly and felt a great respect for him. He fought a losing battle in hopes of seeing his family again. He admitted he had done things he wasn\u2019t proud of, but he did them for his people and so they could survive. <br/>\nYou could relate to him in some ways. You had lost your sister and the grief had driven you near insanity. They never found a body, or anything else for that matter. The thought that she might still be out there, somewhere, haunted you.<br/>\nYou couldn\u2019t pinpoint the moment you realised you were attracted to him. Some small voice at the back of your head whispered it had been right from the start, and even though you shook it away, you had a suspicion it was right. <br/>\nHis features and colour were so unique and otherworldly. You partly hated that you were so attracted to him because you spent a lot of time with him now. The two of you were very close, and he seemed genuinely happy when he found out you were accompanying them. <br/>\n\u201cCant?\u201d Talos chuckled as he sat back in the chair comfortably. He was more relaxed around you than most other. Maybe because with you, he didn\u2019t have to be a leader. He didn\u2019t have to be the fearless general, the ruthless commander. No, he just had to be himself. <br/>\n\u201cIm still getting use to the lack of sun.\u201d You explain, looking out past Carol into the black void. <br/>\n\u201cAh.\u201d Talos hums, seeming to understand immediately as he nods. \u201cIt does take some time.\u201d <br/>\n\u201cwhy are you still awake?\u201d You ask, turning your chair to face him. You instantly saw a soft smile dawn his lips as he glanced at you. <br/>\n\u201cI still have a journey ahead before I can rest easily again.\u201d He tell you, making you offer him a soft smile. He was worried about his future, the future of his people. <br/>\n\u201cyou don\u2019t have to carry that burden alone anymore.\u201d You keep your voice soft, and quiet. you knew he wouldn\u2019t want anyone to overhear such things. Talos frowns and tilts his head to the side. after a moment of watching you, he signs slightly and shakes his head, looking away from you. <br/>\nTalos suddenly stands, turning and walking towards the door. <br/>\nYou dart up from your seat. You didn\u2019t mean to offend him or upset him. <br/>\nGrabbing his hand, he stops when your skins touches his own. You were so much softer than his own kind. The palms of your hand, the pads of your fingers, so soft. <br/>\nunlike his own hands, which were rough but no less sensitive than your own. <br/>\n\u201cTalos?\u201d you call his name, drawing him back a little as he turned to face you but you didn\u2019t drop his hand. In fact, you felt him clutch your hand.  \u201cYou\u2019re not alone anymore.\u201d <br/>\n\u201cyou think im lonely?\u201d Talos smirked, as if he found the idea amusing in some way. <br/>\n\u201cA little. Yes. I think you\u2019re so use to being on your own.\u201d You confess to him, stroking the back of his hand with your palm in a soothing motion. <br/>\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Talos asked, his eyes falling to your hand as he marvelled at how small they were in comparison with his own. <br/>\n\u201cAnd you have me.\u201d You tell him, unsure if he could sense the true meaning of your words. <br/>\n\u201cyou?\u201d He smiles, but not in a malicious way. <br/>\n\u201cIm know im not much.\u201d You giggle, looking down as you cheeks burned red. A soft chuckle echoed from his chest as he reached up his free hand. Gently, he took your chin between his forefinger and thumb and guided your attention back up to him. His eyes darted between your own eyes and your lips.<br/>\n\u201cYou are so much more.\u201d He breaths, his voice filled with love and a hint of lust. \u201cyou are perfect.\u201d<br/>\nAll you could do was look at him with wide, owlish eyes as he smiled and leaned closer. <br/>\nHe paused an inch or so away from your lips, his eyes darted up to meet yours. It dawned on you that he had paused to allow you time to reject him. You could lean away, turn your head to the side or tell him to stop. But you didn\u2019t want that. <br/>\nClosing your eyes, you leaned forward and met his lips. <br/>\nHe kissed you softly, sweetly. Your hand drop from his own so you could wrap your arms around his neck. His own hands found your hips, pulling you against his solid chest, not that you minded. You pressed yourself against him, feeling one of his hands slip around to rest on your lower back. <br/>\nSomething in the kiss shifted. It was in a moment, barely a blink of an eye. It went from soft and sweet to desperate and needy. You didn\u2019t know if you had changed the kiss, or he had. But you found yourself clinging to him, moaning against his lips. <br/>\nHe pulled you to the side where there was a table. Pushing you up against it, you instantly knew what to do. You hopped you, spreading your legs and pulling him between them. <br/>\nOne of his hands fell to your thigh then back to your hips as he held you tightly. His other hand left you hip, coming up to rest on the side of your neck. In a slow and sensual way, he brushed all your hair away from the right side of your neck. <br/>\nYou broke the kiss, gasping for air. But Talos seemed to be unable to stop. He pressed kisses down your jaw to your neck, seeming to have planned it since he had moved the hair from that area. <br/>\nYou couldn\u2019t help but smirk as you let out a soft moan at the sensation. Turned your head, your eyes fell on his large ears. Pressing your lips to the tip of the pointed ear, you pressed soft, open mouth kisses and immediately got a response. <br/>\nHis entire body trembled as he growled against his skin. <br/>\nBut the moment was ruined when your eyes fell on the windows and you noticed there was no longer a flame in the distance. <br/>\n\u201cShit.\u201d You gasped, jumping as Talos immediately stepped back, afraid he had went too far. <br/>\nHis eyes filled with fear as you jumped off the table, but he was thankful to see you weren\u2019t angry or upset at him. <br/>\n\u201cWheres Carol?\u201d You nod to the window, still panting slightly. Talos looks out and realizes why you had jumped. <br/>\n\u201cIm right here.\u201d Carols voice made you jump again as you see her walk into the room. She smiles but, judging from her innocent dementor, she didn\u2019t know what had just happened. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d <br/>\n\u201cYes, fine.\u201d You nod, answering a little too quickly. But Talos was able to regain his composure a lot quicker than you were. <br/>\n\u201cWe were just going to get some thing to drink. Do you want anything?\u201d He asked Carol, who thought for a moment before shaking her head. <br/>\n\u201cNo, im going to bed.\u201d She tells you before leaving after bidding you a good night. <br/>\nOnce the door was closed, you immediately relaxed with an audible sigh. <br/>\nTalos let out a small chuckle as you turned to him. You raise an eyebrow. <br/>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know a humans neck was so\u2026 sensitive.\u201d He smirks, his eyes darting down to the area he had been giving so much attention to before. <br/>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise a Skrulls ears were so sensitive.\u201d You smirk right back at him. \u201cLooks like we both have a lot to learn.\u201d <br/>\nA soft chuckle left talos\u2019 lips as he wraps an arm around your waist. To your surprise, he leans forward and presses his forehead to yours. It wasn\u2019t a gesture you were use to, but something about it felt really intense and loving. <br/>\nA soft purr came from Talos as you looked up and saw he had his eyes closed. In that moment, you knew it was a sign of affection. <br/>\nSmiling, you place your hands on his shoulders, gently nuzzling your head against his own for a moment. <br/>\n\u201cNow, about that drink?\u201d You asked as he pulled away. <br/>\n\u201cI have some supplies in my quarters.\u201d Talos glances to the door, as if checking no one had snuck in during the intimate moment. <br/>\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d You giggle, pulling away so he could lead you to the door. <br/>\nWhatever Carol had \u2018interrupted\u2019, you were very keen to get it right back on track.</p>",

No, he just had to be himself. <br>\n\u201cIm still getting use to the lack of sun.\u201d You explain, looking out past Carol into the black void. <br>\n\u201cAh.\u201d Talos hums, seeming to understand immediately as he nods. \u201cIt does take some time.\u201d <br>\n\u201cwhy are you still awake?\u201d You ask, turning your chair to face him. You instantly saw a soft smile dawn his lips as he glanced at you. <br>\n\u201cI still have a journey ahead before I can rest easily again.\u201d He tell you, making you offer him a soft smile. He was worried about his future, the future of his people. <br>\n\u201cyou don\u2019t have to carry that burden alone anymore.\u201d You keep your voice soft, and quiet. you knew he wouldn\u2019t want anyone to overhear such things. Talos frowns and tilts his head to the side. after a moment of watching you, he signs slightly and shakes his head, looking away from you. <br>\nTalos suddenly stands, turning and walking towards the door. <br>\nYou dart up from your seat. You didn\u2019t mean to offend him or upset him. <br>\nGrabbing his hand, he stops when your skins touches his own. You were so much softer than his own kind. The palms of your hand, the pads of your fingers, so soft. <br>\nunlike his own hands, which were rough but no less sensitive than your own. <br>\n\u201cTalos?\u201d you call his name, drawing him back a little as he turned to face you but you didn\u2019t drop his hand. In fact, you felt him clutch your hand.  \u201cYou\u2019re not alone anymore.\u201d <br>\n\u201cyou think im lonely?\u201d Talos smirked, as if he found the idea amusing in some way. <br>\n\u201cA little. Yes. I think you\u2019re so use to being on your own.\u201d You confess to him, stroking the back of his hand with your palm in a soothing motion. <br>\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Talos asked, his eyes falling to your hand as he marvelled at how small they were in comparison with his own. <br>\n\u201cAnd you have me.\u201d You tell him, unsure if he could sense the true meaning of your words. <br>\n\u201cyou?\u201d He smiles, but not in a malicious way. <br>\n\u201cIm know im not much.\u201d You giggle, looking down as you cheeks burned red. A soft chuckle echoed from his chest as he reached up his free hand. Gently, he took your chin between his forefinger and thumb and guided your attention back up to him. His eyes darted between your own eyes and your lips.<br>\n\u201cYou are so much more.\u201d He breaths, his voice filled with love and a hint of lust. \u201cyou are perfect.\u201d<br>\nAll you could do was look at him with wide, owlish eyes as he smiled and leaned closer. <br>\nHe paused an inch or so away from your lips, his eyes darted up to meet yours. It dawned on you that he had paused to allow you time to reject him. You could lean away, turn your head to the side or tell him to stop. But you didn\u2019t want that. <br>\nClosing your eyes, you leaned forward and met his lips. <br>\nHe kissed you softly, sweetly. Your hand drop from his own so you could wrap your arms around his neck. His own hands found your hips, pulling you against his solid chest, not that you minded. You pressed yourself against him, feeling one of his hands slip around to rest on your lower back. <br>\nSomething in the kiss shifted. It was in a moment, barely a blink of an eye. It went from soft and sweet to desperate and needy. You didn\u2019t know if you had changed the kiss, or he had. But you found yourself clinging to him, moaning against his lips. <br>\nHe pulled you to the side where there was a table. Pushing you up against it, you instantly knew what to do. You hopped you, spreading your legs and pulling him between them. <br>\nOne of his hands fell to your thigh then back to your hips as he held you tightly. His other hand left you hip, coming up to rest on the side of your neck. In a slow and sensual way, he brushed all your hair away from the right side of your neck. <br>\nYou broke the kiss, gasping for air. But Talos seemed to be unable to stop. He pressed kisses down your jaw to your neck, seeming to have planned it since he had moved the hair from that area. <br>\nYou couldn\u2019t help but smirk as you let out a soft moan at the sensation. Turned your head, your eyes fell on his large ears. Pressing your lips to the tip of the pointed ear, you pressed soft, open mouth kisses and immediately got a response. <br>\nHis entire body trembled as he growled against his skin. <br>\nBut the moment was ruined when your eyes fell on the windows and you noticed there was no longer a flame in the distance. <br>\n\u201cShit.\u201d You gasped, jumping as Talos immediately stepped back, afraid he had went too far. <br>\nHis eyes filled with fear as you jumped off the table, but he was thankful to see you weren\u2019t angry or upset at him. <br>\n\u201cWheres Carol?\u201d You nod to the window, still panting slightly. Talos looks out and realizes why you had jumped. <br>\n\u201cIm right here.\u201d Carols voice made you jump again as you see her walk into the room. She smiles but, judging from her innocent dementor, she didn\u2019t know what had just happened. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d <br>\n\u201cYes, fine.\u201d You nod, answering a little too quickly. But Talos was able to regain his composure a lot quicker than you were. <br>\n\u201cWe were just going to get some thing to drink. Do you want anything?\u201d He asked Carol, who thought for a moment before shaking her head. <br>\n\u201cNo, im going to bed.\u201d She tells you before leaving after bidding you a good night. <br>\nOnce the door was closed, you immediately relaxed with an audible sigh. <br>\nTalos let out a small chuckle as you turned to him. You raise an eyebrow. <br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know a humans neck was so\u2026 sensitive.\u201d He smirks, his eyes darting down to the area he had been giving so much attention to before. <br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise a Skrulls ears were so sensitive.\u201d You smirk right back at him. \u201cLooks like we both have a lot to learn.\u201d <br>\nA soft chuckle left talos\u2019 lips as he wraps an arm around your waist. To your surprise, he leans forward and presses his forehead to yours. It wasn\u2019t a gesture you were use to, but something about it felt really intense and loving. <br>\nA soft purr came from Talos as you looked up and saw he had his eyes closed. In that moment, you knew it was a sign of affection. <br>\nSmiling, you place your hands on his shoulders, gently nuzzling your head against his own for a moment. <br>\n\u201cNow, about that drink?\u201d You asked as he pulled away. <br>\n\u201cI have some supplies in my quarters.\u201d Talos glances to the door, as if checking no one had snuck in during the intimate moment. <br>\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d You giggle, pulling away so he could lead you to the door. <br>\nWhatever Carol had \u2018interrupted\u2019, you were very keen to get it right back on track.</p>",

I really want to see what you would do with a Talos request. </p>\n\n<p>You sat at the console, watching Carol as she flew in front. She would be getting tired and would need to stop soon, but not quite yet. She could return to the ship and enter through a bay at the back which would close and inside door to open the outside one for her to come in. Once she was inside, it would swap and close the outside one then open the inside. this would allow her to enter the ship and leave when she desired. <br>\nMost of the Skrull were fast asleep throughout the ship apart from one or two who were still a little on edge about everything. <br>\nYou had decided to help them find a home along with Carol. She was your sister, and the thought of losing her again made your stomach twist horribly in your stomach. After her disappearance, you rose through the ranks and ended up working with Fury. You had been there from the start, you had seen all this unfold and watched in disbelief as your sister not only rose from the grave but also in a ball of fire. <br>\nYou had been there when you all entered Lawsons ship and reunited Talos with his sister and niece. <br>\nWhen the time had come for her to leave, she offered you to come with her. Fury had agreed, saying that there was going to be a shift in the whole galaxy, and he would need someone he could trust. And so, here you were. <br>\nleaning back in the seat, your eyes skimmed the empty space around you, wondering where she was leading you all. <br>\nYou heard the door to the room open and looked over to see Talos enter. He smiled and nodded to greet you which you returned. <br>\n\u201cYou should be asleep.\u201d His voice was deep and a little gruff as he walked over and sat at the control panel next to you. <br>\n\u201cprobably.\u201d You agree with a chuckle. \u201cbut I cant.\u201d <br>\nyou looked at the Skrull who sat next to you. The first time you had seen him, you had felt anger and hate for him and his kind. But you had been misinformed like some many others. When your alliances changed, you began to look at him more kindly and felt a great respect for him. He fought a losing battle in hopes of seeing his family again. He admitted he had done things he wasn\u2019t proud of, but he did them for his people and so they could survive. <br>\nYou could relate to him in some ways. You had lost your sister and the grief had driven you near insanity. They never found a body, or anything else for that matter. The thought that she might still be out there, somewhere, haunted you.<br>\nYou couldn\u2019t pinpoint the moment you realised you were attracted to him. Some small voice at the back of your head whispered it had been right from the start, and even though you shook it away, you had a suspicion it was right. <br>\nHis features and colour were so unique and otherworldly. You partly hated that you were so attracted to him because you spent a lot of time with him now. The two of you were very close, and he seemed genuinely happy when he found out you were accompanying them. <br>\n\u201cCant?\u201d Talos chuckled as he sat back in the chair comfortably.

But you didn&rsquo;t want that. <br />\nClosing your eyes, you leaned forward and met his lips. <br />\nHe kissed you softly, sweetly. Your hand drop from his own so you could wrap your arms around his neck. His own hands found your hips, pulling you against his solid chest, not that you minded. You pressed yourself against him, feeling one of his hands slip around to rest on your lower back. <br />\nSomething in the kiss shifted. It was in a moment, barely a blink of an eye. It went from soft and sweet to desperate and needy. You didn&rsquo;t know if you had changed the kiss, or he had. But you found yourself clinging to him, moaning against his lips. <br />\nHe pulled you to the side where there was a table. Pushing you up against it, you instantly knew what to do. You hopped you, spreading your legs and pulling him between them. <br />\nOne of his hands fell to your thigh then back to your hips as he held you tightly. His other hand left you hip, coming up to rest on the side of your neck. In a slow and sensual way, he brushed all your hair away from the right side of your neck. <br />\nYou broke the kiss, gasping for air. But Talos seemed to be unable to stop. He pressed kisses down your jaw to your neck, seeming to have planned it since he had moved the hair from that area. <br />\nYou couldn&rsquo;t help but smirk as you let out a soft moan at the sensation. Turned your head, your eyes fell on his large ears. Pressing your lips to the tip of the pointed ear, you pressed soft, open mouth kisses and immediately got a response. <br />\nHis entire body trembled as he growled against his skin. <br />\nBut the moment was ruined when your eyes fell on the windows and you noticed there was no longer a flame in the distance. <br />\n&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; You gasped, jumping as Talos immediately stepped back, afraid he had went too far. <br />\nHis eyes filled with fear as you jumped off the table, but he was thankful to see you weren&rsquo;t angry or upset at him. <br />\n&ldquo;Wheres Carol?&rdquo; You nod to the window, still panting slightly. Talos looks out and realizes why you had jumped. <br />\n&ldquo;Im right here.&rdquo; Carols voice made you jump again as you see her walk into the room. She smiles but, judging from her innocent dementor, she didn&rsquo;t know what had just happened. &ldquo;Everything okay?&rdquo; <br />\n&ldquo;Yes, fine.&rdquo; You nod, answering a little too quickly. But Talos was able to regain his composure a lot quicker than you were. <br />\n&ldquo;We were just going to get some thing to drink. Do you want anything?&rdquo; He asked Carol, who thought for a moment before shaking her head. <br />\n&ldquo;No, im going to bed.&rdquo; She tells you before leaving after bidding you a good night. <br />\nOnce the door was closed, you immediately relaxed with an audible sigh. <br />\nTalos let out a small chuckle as you turned to him. You raise an eyebrow. <br />\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know a humans neck was so&hellip; sensitive.&rdquo; He smirks, his eyes darting down to the area he had been giving so much attention to before. <br />\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise a Skrulls ears were so sensitive.&rdquo; You smirk right back at him. &ldquo;Looks like we both have a lot to learn.&rdquo; <br />\nA soft chuckle left talos&rsquo; lips as he wraps an arm around your waist. To your surprise, he leans forward and presses his forehead to yours. It wasn&rsquo;t a gesture you were use to, but something about it felt really intense and loving. <br />\nA soft purr came from Talos as you looked up and saw he had his eyes closed. In that moment, you knew it was a sign of affection. <br />\nSmiling, you place your hands on his shoulders, gently nuzzling your head against his own for a moment. <br />\n&ldquo;Now, about that drink?&rdquo; You asked as he pulled away. <br />\n&ldquo;I have some supplies in my quarters.&rdquo; Talos glances to the door, as if checking no one had snuck in during the intimate moment. <br />\n&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo; You giggle, pulling away so he could lead you to the door. <br />\nWhatever Carol had &lsquo;interrupted&rsquo;, you were very keen to get it right back on track.</p>",
