        "answer": "<p><b><i>Okay but YES! This is a part 2 to <a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/183562173739/hi-babe-could-you-maybe-write-something-about-yn\">this blurb</a>!</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i>A miracle was what it was. The fact that your daughter had slept a whole night in her own room without a peep for the first time <i>ever</i>. You\u2019d been slowly putting it into practice over the past week or so, every night tucking her into her cot rather than the basket beside your bed. And every night she\u2019d wake at some point, all but screaming the house down for attention from either of you. Each night she\u2019d slept in the room a little longer than the one before, but it seemed impossible to get a whole night\u2019s sleep out of her without hearing a wink.</p><!-- more --><p>Until last night. Sure she\u2019d woken up at six in the morning and screamed then instead, but you were willing to accept that. She normally woke an hour later anyway.</p><p>The fact that she had slept a whole night was an exciting prospect, especially for Harry.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spare load of nappies, three changes of clothes and her pyjamas,\u201d You fawn over the contents of your bag with Anne, trying to remember everything you\u2019d put in, \u201cthere\u2019s wipes and a two cloths in the side pocket because she really can make a mess on you when she\u2019s sick, and I left a pack of those biscuits for her as well.\u201d</p><p>Those baby biscuits that your husband has a tendency to eat himself\u2026</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d Harry rests a hand on your arm,</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s had babies, remember?\u201d He reminds you with a teasing smile, his whole presence screaming at you to stop fussing.</p><p>\u201cLeave her be, Harry.\u201d Anne shakes her head at him, your little girl bouncing on her hip, \u201cit\u2019s her first night away from her, just\u2026 let her say what she needs to.\u201d</p><p>Harry raises a hand defensively but he still refuses to let you go. He\u2019s been like that a lot, ever since you had that chat all those mornings ago he\u2019s been all but glued to your hip, insistent on having at least just a hand on you at all times.</p><p>You\u2019re grateful for it, though. You\u2019ve definitely learned a lesson when it comes to your marriage, and you\u2019ve never been happier that Harry is your husband.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve got toys for her but she\u2019s obsessed with this plush bear so I\u2019ve packed that as well. She\u2019ll only scream otherwise.\u201d You glance around yourself with a little pout. \u201cI think\u2026 that\u2019s everything.\u201d</p><p>Anne smiles and nods once at you. \u201cPerfect, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re gonna have the best time. Aren\u2019t we poppet?\u201d She coos at your daughter, who\u2019s delighted by Nanny\u2019s random appearance at six o\u2019clock on a Thursday.</p><p>You take her from Anne one last time while Harry loads the bags into the car, cuddling her one last time. Fortunately for Anne, she looks just about ready for bed by the way her cheeks are a little flush and her eyelids are heavy. It\u2019s a little early perhaps but Harry had made his best effort to wear her out so all his mum had to do was put her to bed. The past three hours had been chaos.</p><p>\u201cGonna be a good girl for Nanny, eh?\u201d You whisper quietly to her as her tiny hands cling to the neck of your t-shirt. \u201cBe really good for her, yeah? Just like you are for me and Daddy.\u201d</p><p>You feather her face with light kisses until she\u2019s pulling away with tired irritation, but only makes a small whimper. You don\u2019t really want to let her go, but you know it\u2019s probably a good thing that Anne\u2019s given you the opportunity to have a night with just Harry again.</p><p>It\u2019s painful as you watch the car drive away with your angel already half passed out, but you know you\u2019ll have her right back in the morning and that\u2019s all you need to remind yourself.</p><p>Once the car is out of sight you silently make your way back inside, and suddenly the house feels eerily quiet. You look around your front room with pursed lips as you think of where to start tidying up. There\u2019s toys all over the floor, a mess Harry created on his mission to wear your daughter out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing, love?\u201d Harry asks quietly as he watches you piling toys into the toy box.</p><p>You look over your shoulder to see him stood in the doorway smirking at you. \u201cTidying up after you.\u201d You mumble your reply and get back to work.</p><p>Harry sighs and follows suit. He was about to tell you to leave it and do it in the morning, but he also knows you well enough by now that suggesting that would prompt an argument neither of you want to have on your first night alone together since having your nipper. Plus -he doesn\u2019t particularly want to sit with a takeaway and a bottle of wine while there\u2019s fucking colourful toys all over the floor.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d you breathe heavily as you set your plate on the coffee table, \u201cenjoyed that more than I thought I would.</p><p>Up until that moment, the only noise for the past twenty minutes had been the low hum of the film on the tv and the scraping of cutlery against plates, sometimes accompanied with a slosh of wine in a wine glass. Prior to that he\u2019d ran you a bath, which admittedly you hadn\u2019t spent very long in because you were too hungry, but it was a nice touch nonetheless. Now you\u2019re sat lazily on the sofa with your husband beside you in nothing but his hoodie and your knickers. It was the most relaxed evening you\u2019ve had since giving birth.</p><p>Harry giggles as he pulls you back into his side, his arms wrapping around your waist while he presses soft kisses into your hair. \u201cCurry was a good idea then, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d You nod your head furiously against his chest, your hand slipping under the soft cotton of his t-shirt to rest on his slightly swollen belly from dinner. \u201cCan\u2019t remember the last time we had a good curry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not since you got pregnant\u2026 and I\u2019m pretty sure it was a while before that, too.\u201d Harry muses aloud, one hand lightly rubbing up and down your back.</p><p>\u201cI think it was that night you randomly turned up after tour, you know. When you said you weren\u2019t coming home for a few more days originally but you changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Harry stares ahead of himself for a moment in contemplation. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even married then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You hum a little laugh and place a small kiss to his stubbled jaw. \u201c<i>That\u2019s</i> how long it\u2019s been since we had a curry.\u201d</p><p>Your husband smirks and glances down at you, a weird and familiar glint in his eye. \u201cDo you remember what we did that night?\u201d</p><p>You laugh at how cheeky and obvious he is. \u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the fact that we did it on the stairs and you got carpet burn on your back, then yes; I remember.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles darkly, and you\u2019re shaking your head at his silliness. \u201cWas worth it, though. Fancy doing it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of us are in a good enough state physically to fuck on the staircase, Harry.\u201d You remind him with a frown. In fact the thought alone is making you wince.</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d He mumbles flatly, but the pull of his lips and the dimples screams that he\u2019s pissing around. \u201cI for one think I\u2019d perform perfectly fine on the staircase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo have a wank on it then.\u201d You mutter dryly, but it only has him laughing louder as his arms tighten around you.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my wife - my filthy mouthed, brash and blunt wifey. Where\u2019ve you been, eh?\u201d He teases as he shakes you gently, peppering kisses into the side of your face.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 after our baby. Can\u2019t say shit like that in front of a child, can I?\u201d You retort, while his kisses inch closer to your lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry wonders, his voice coming much lower than it had done a moment ago, \u201cpretty sure I\u2019ve heard you say \u2018bollocks\u2019 in front of her a few times.\u201d</p><p>That makes you giggle, and you\u2019re hyper aware of his hand that\u2019s managed to sneak it\u2019s way to your thigh, which doesn\u2019t help your giggling. \u201cUsually under my breath, though. I\u2019m not a complete arsehole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill <i>in front</i> of a baby.\u201d He murmurs into the corner of your mouth.</p><p>You roll your eyes eyes, but his advances have you leaning into him rather than away from him, the proximity of his hand igniting that fire in your core. \u201cWell now you\u2019re just being pedantic. And besides, I actually could\u2019ve been behind her.\u201d</p><p>Harry produces a single pitched hum as he pulls you in closer somehow, pulling your lower lip between his teeth. \u201cNow who\u2019s being pedantic?\u201d</p><p>Your laugh is dirty, but you\u2019re far more concerned with the fact that your husband\u2019s hand is inching closer to the space between your legs. You move your arms to wrap around his neck, tangling your fingers with his curls while you press your lips firmly to his. He\u2019s eager with his mouth, already teasing his tongue along your upper lip. It makes you tingle, because you haven\u2019t tasted him this way for a long time now, haven\u2019t kissed him this way since you were pregnant and <i>God</i> it feels so nice.</p><p>His tongue finds yours, and they\u2019re dancing with one another as your obvious need for one another grows. Harry\u2019s massaging his hand into the top of your thigh while the other slips under his hoodie that you\u2019re wearing to grip at your breast. He\u2019s naive to the pain it causes you, still being sensitive with breast feeding, and you hiss and wince over the feeling.</p><p>You pull away just a little, stroking a hand over the side of his face. \u201cNot there, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He blindly kisses you again, mumbling a little sheepish \u2018sorry\u2019 between pecks to your lips, before he\u2019s back to searching your mouth with his tongue, his hand finding comfort in your waist instead.</p><p>You continue this way for a while, snogging on your sofa like lovesick teenagers about to shag for the first time, because it\u2019s been so long that that\u2019s how it actually feels. And you\u2019re happy with it, because even after your brief low moment after your daughters birth - knowing that your husband still loves you the way he does fills you with something you didn\u2019t know you needed.</p><p>Harry begins to ease you backwards, the hand on your thigh gliding upwards to pull at your jumper, and he hauls it over you before laying you back with your bare skin pressed flush against the fabric of your sofa. He pulls his own t-shirt off before he sandwiches himself between your legs, his hand back to caressing and squeezing your thigh.</p><p>\u201cMissed you.\u201d He mumbles as his eyes adore your naked frame below him. \u201cMissed you like this all the time.\u201d</p><p>You swallow the lump in your throat as you reach for his hand, bringing it to your lips to kiss into his palm. \u201cI love you.\u201d You whisper against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, darlin\u2019. So fuckin\u2019 much.\u201d He hums as he watches you continue to kiss over his hand, but your eyes remain with his. \u201cAlways have been so bloody beautiful, haven\u2019t ya?\u201d His palm squeezes around your thigh again and he rubs his thumb along your lips.</p><p>You know he\u2019s always loved it when you\u2019re a little bit dirty, so you wrap your lips around the tip of his thumb and suck on it the smallest amount. You hear when his breath catches, his length between your legs growing just that bit more in his briefs.</p><p>\u201cFuuucking hell, love.\u201d He drawls, pushing his digit all the way into your mouth until it disappears completely. \u201cLook at you, my God.\u201d</p><p>His words have only got you hotter - and wetter. He can can feel the way you\u2019re trying to squeeze your thighs together to sate the burn you\u2019re experiencing. He leans down and kisses your lips harshly the thumb that was in your mouth now rubbing over the damp spot on your knickers. You whimper against his lips as your hands grip his biceps, and you\u2019re wriggling impatiently against him.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d You breathe against him, thumbs rubbing harsh circles into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWant me to make you feel good, wifey?\u201d He asks lowly, pressing another kiss to the corner of your mouth.</p><p>Your answer is another desperate kiss and your fingers slipping through his curls until they decorate you like rings. You give a gentle tug that you know he likes, and he audibly groans into your mouth.</p><p>He moves sloppy kisses down your body, taking extra care around your breasts after his last hiccup, until he\u2019s nestling himself between your legs. He presses a single kiss to the wet patch of your pants before carefully shimmying them off your legs. You watch him with intrigue as he kisses up the inside of your thigh, ignoring the way his curls slightly tickle your bare legs.</p><p>\u201cSo wet, angel. Think you need this, don\u2019t you?\u201d He hesitates, meeting your gaze as you stop massaging his scalp and just nod at him.</p><p>You\u2019re choking on air when he finally teases your clit with light flicks of his tongue, back to yanking his hair into fists. It feels different this time, like you\u2019re more sensitive to every single move he makes. It has you clinging him to you core before he\u2019s even really started his work, but he\u2019s only finding your quick exasperation encouraging.</p><p>He licks a full stripe between your folds, feeling slightly drunk off the sound you emit from deep within your belly, before dipping his tongue into your dripping heat. Your eyes roll to the back of your head, still desperately fisting at his curls as he fucks you with his tongue for the first time in months.</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit, H.\u201d You pant as your hips jerk upwards involuntarily, and you\u2019re whining as his tongue happens to rub over you in just the right way.</p><p>Harry moves over you at a faster pace, working you up until your vision blurs and you\u2019re seeing stars as your orgasm washes through you. He stills between you while you\u2019re overly sensitive, kissing back down your thighs before wrapping his hands under your back to bring you into his lap.</p><p>You delicately straddle him while you\u2019re still catching your breath, Harry\u2019s arms wrapped tightly around your waist as he leaves wet kisses in random places on your body. He\u2019s muttering \u2018I love you\u2019 after every single one, occasionally meeting your gaze with his gorgeous eyes as you watch him.</p><p>When he finally kisses your lips again you can only really taste yourself, but it still doesn\u2019t bother you. \u201cCan\u2019t believe how lucky I am.\u201d He\u2019s feeling sentimental as he loves on you a bit more.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot m\u2019self a wife as beautiful as you, <i>and</i> you gave me a beautiful daughter, <i>and</i> you still know all the ways to get me stiff.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help but giggle at him, pushing your fingers through his growing curls. \u201cSounds like a catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 <i>dreamboat</i>.\u201d He hums as he leans in to press a hard kiss to your lips. \u201cWouldn\u2019t change you for the world, y\u2019know that?\u201d</p><p>You still haven\u2019t completely calmed down yet, but he\u2019s making you feel so good you\u2019re basically ready to go again. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head head as caresses his hands from the small of your back, around your hips to the tops of your thighs and back again. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even my bitter humour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not even. In fact, apart from your arse that\u2019s my favourite thing about you.\u201d He insists as he presses a lingering kiss to your lips, his hands stopping at the tops of your thighs again.</p><p>You roll your hips into his, and you hear the throaty he lets out as you graze over his restricted bulge.</p><p>\u201cFuck, do that again.\u201d He begs breathlessly.</p><p>You do as he asks, rolling over his length and into his hips, and his moan comes out longer and louder as he squeezes your thighs much harder.</p><p>\u201cWant you in me, Harry.\u201d You admit quietly, tugging a few stray curls at the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He heaves, desperation cloaking his eyes. \u201cThat what you want? Make y\u2019feel good again?\u201d</p><p>You nod quickly.</p><p>\u201cOh fucking hell, I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d Harry chuckles, stroking his hands once up and down your sides before reaching between his legs to free his aching cock, not wasting any time with removing his briefs.</p><p>You inch forwards, steadying yourself with a grip on his shoulders before lowering your still wet heat onto his ridiculous length. You hiss as he fills you up, stretching you somehow even after giving birth, and he\u2019s releasing another guttural moan.</p><p>He\u2019s rocking into you slowly, pressing sloppy kiss into the top of your sternum between your breasts. \u201cChrist alive, you feel good.\u201d He growls into your chest as you pick up a gentle pace to match his. \u201cAlways were a tight little thing, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>You whimper, coaxing his lips to yours by gripping the sides of his face to moan into his mouth. His arms hold a vice-like grip around your back, keeping you as close to him as you gradually pick up your pace.</p><p>You can feel him well within you, and you know if you were to adjust yourself ever so slightly he\u2019d hit that place you needed.</p><p>\u201cI love you so fuckin\u2019 much, angel.\u201d He whines against your lips, tugging your bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head against him and suck on his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d He pleads.</p><p>You nod quickly. \u201cI promise.\u201d You choke out, and his hips jut unnaturally in pace, throwing you off slightly.</p><p>He keeps his grip on you, both arms stretched upwards across the expanse of your back so that his hands are close to having a decent grip on your shoulders. He adopts a quicker pace, out of time with you, and you just so happen to slip so that he finds that place you were holding off on.</p><p>You cry out as your orgasm takes a hold of you, keeping your lips forced on Harry\u2019s as your body stiffens. He holds you there as he grunts through his own high, and you can feel his hot release spreading into your own heat.</p><p>As the two of you relax into one another the room grows quiet and still, nothing to be heard but your heavy breathing. You\u2019re both feeling a bit sticky, and it used to be ritual that you\u2019d shower together after.</p><p>You twist your head to press a line of kisses along his jaw, and you can feel the shift against your lips when he smiles. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d</p><p>Harry giggles and peers down at you, placing a soft kiss to your lips. \u201cWas, wasn\u2019t it? What do you say to round two in the shower?\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Thank ya muchly!</p><p>Tag list:\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a></p>",

The fact that your daughter had slept a whole night in her own room without a peep for the first time <i>ever</i>. You\u2019d been slowly putting it into practice over the past week or so, every night tucking her into her cot rather than the basket beside your bed. And every night she\u2019d wake at some point, all but screaming the house down for attention from either of you. Each night she\u2019d slept in the room a little longer than the one before, but it seemed impossible to get a whole night\u2019s sleep out of her without hearing a wink.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Until last night. Sure she\u2019d woken up at six in the morning and screamed then instead, but you were willing to accept that. She normally woke an hour later anyway.</p><p>The fact that she had slept a whole night was an exciting prospect, especially for Harry.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spare load of nappies, three changes of clothes and her pyjamas,\u201d You fawn over the contents of your bag with Anne, trying to remember everything you\u2019d put in, \u201cthere\u2019s wipes and a two cloths in the side pocket because she really can make a mess on you when she\u2019s sick, and I left a pack of those biscuits for her as well.\u201d</p><p>Those baby biscuits that your husband has a tendency to eat himself\u2026</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d Harry rests a hand on your arm,</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s had babies, remember?\u201d He reminds you with a teasing smile, his whole presence screaming at you to stop fussing.</p><p>\u201cLeave her be, Harry.\u201d Anne shakes her head at him, your little girl bouncing on her hip, \u201cit\u2019s her first night away from her, just\u2026 let her say what she needs to.\u201d</p><p>Harry raises a hand defensively but he still refuses to let you go. He\u2019s been like that a lot, ever since you had that chat all those mornings ago he\u2019s been all but glued to your hip, insistent on having at least just a hand on you at all times.</p><p>You\u2019re grateful for it, though. You\u2019ve definitely learned a lesson when it comes to your marriage, and you\u2019ve never been happier that Harry is your husband.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve got toys for her but she\u2019s obsessed with this plush bear so I\u2019ve packed that as well. She\u2019ll only scream otherwise.\u201d You glance around yourself with a little pout. \u201cI think\u2026 that\u2019s everything.\u201d</p><p>Anne smiles and nods once at you. \u201cPerfect, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re gonna have the best time. Aren\u2019t we poppet?\u201d She coos at your daughter, who\u2019s delighted by Nanny\u2019s random appearance at six o\u2019clock on a Thursday.</p><p>You take her from Anne one last time while Harry loads the bags into the car, cuddling her one last time. Fortunately for Anne, she looks just about ready for bed by the way her cheeks are a little flush and her eyelids are heavy. It\u2019s a little early perhaps but Harry had made his best effort to wear her out so all his mum had to do was put her to bed. The past three hours had been chaos.</p><p>\u201cGonna be a good girl for Nanny, eh?\u201d You whisper quietly to her as her tiny hands cling to the neck of your t-shirt. \u201cBe really good for her, yeah? Just like you are for me and Daddy.\u201d</p><p>You feather her face with light kisses until she\u2019s pulling away with tired irritation, but only makes a small whimper. You don\u2019t really want to let her go, but you know it\u2019s probably a good thing that Anne\u2019s given you the opportunity to have a night with just Harry again.</p><p>It\u2019s painful as you watch the car drive away with your angel already half passed out, but you know you\u2019ll have her right back in the morning and that\u2019s all you need to remind yourself.</p><p>Once the car is out of sight you silently make your way back inside, and suddenly the house feels eerily quiet. You look around your front room with pursed lips as you think of where to start tidying up. There\u2019s toys all over the floor, a mess Harry created on his mission to wear your daughter out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing, love?\u201d Harry asks quietly as he watches you piling toys into the toy box.</p><p>You look over your shoulder to see him stood in the doorway smirking at you. \u201cTidying up after you.\u201d You mumble your reply and get back to work.</p><p>Harry sighs and follows suit. He was about to tell you to leave it and do it in the morning, but he also knows you well enough by now that suggesting that would prompt an argument neither of you want to have on your first night alone together since having your nipper. Plus -he doesn\u2019t particularly want to sit with a takeaway and a bottle of wine while there\u2019s fucking colourful toys all over the floor.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d you breathe heavily as you set your plate on the coffee table, \u201cenjoyed that more than I thought I would.</p><p>Up until that moment, the only noise for the past twenty minutes had been the low hum of the film on the tv and the scraping of cutlery against plates, sometimes accompanied with a slosh of wine in a wine glass. Prior to that he\u2019d ran you a bath, which admittedly you hadn\u2019t spent very long in because you were too hungry, but it was a nice touch nonetheless. Now you\u2019re sat lazily on the sofa with your husband beside you in nothing but his hoodie and your knickers. It was the most relaxed evening you\u2019ve had since giving birth.</p><p>Harry giggles as he pulls you back into his side, his arms wrapping around your waist while he presses soft kisses into your hair. \u201cCurry was a good idea then, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d You nod your head furiously against his chest, your hand slipping under the soft cotton of his t-shirt to rest on his slightly swollen belly from dinner. \u201cCan\u2019t remember the last time we had a good curry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not since you got pregnant\u2026 and I\u2019m pretty sure it was a while before that, too.\u201d Harry muses aloud, one hand lightly rubbing up and down your back.</p><p>\u201cI think it was that night you randomly turned up after tour, you know. When you said you weren\u2019t coming home for a few more days originally but you changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Harry stares ahead of himself for a moment in contemplation. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even married then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You hum a little laugh and place a small kiss to his stubbled jaw. \u201c<i>That\u2019s</i> how long it\u2019s been since we had a curry.\u201d</p><p>Your husband smirks and glances down at you, a weird and familiar glint in his eye. \u201cDo you remember what we did that night?\u201d</p><p>You laugh at how cheeky and obvious he is. \u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the fact that we did it on the stairs and you got carpet burn on your back, then yes; I remember.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles darkly, and you\u2019re shaking your head at his silliness. \u201cWas worth it, though. Fancy doing it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of us are in a good enough state physically to fuck on the staircase, Harry.\u201d You remind him with a frown. In fact the thought alone is making you wince.</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d He mumbles flatly, but the pull of his lips and the dimples screams that he\u2019s pissing around. \u201cI for one think I\u2019d perform perfectly fine on the staircase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo have a wank on it then.\u201d You mutter dryly, but it only has him laughing louder as his arms tighten around you.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my wife - my filthy mouthed, brash and blunt wifey. Where\u2019ve you been, eh?\u201d He teases as he shakes you gently, peppering kisses into the side of your face.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 after our baby. Can\u2019t say shit like that in front of a child, can I?\u201d You retort, while his kisses inch closer to your lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry wonders, his voice coming much lower than it had done a moment ago, \u201cpretty sure I\u2019ve heard you say \u2018bollocks\u2019 in front of her a few times.\u201d</p><p>That makes you giggle, and you\u2019re hyper aware of his hand that\u2019s managed to sneak it\u2019s way to your thigh, which doesn\u2019t help your giggling. \u201cUsually under my breath, though. I\u2019m not a complete arsehole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill <i>in front</i> of a baby.\u201d He murmurs into the corner of your mouth.</p><p>You roll your eyes eyes, but his advances have you leaning into him rather than away from him, the proximity of his hand igniting that fire in your core. \u201cWell now you\u2019re just being pedantic. And besides, I actually could\u2019ve been behind her.\u201d</p><p>Harry produces a single pitched hum as he pulls you in closer somehow, pulling your lower lip between his teeth. \u201cNow who\u2019s being pedantic?\u201d</p><p>Your laugh is dirty, but you\u2019re far more concerned with the fact that your husband\u2019s hand is inching closer to the space between your legs. You move your arms to wrap around his neck, tangling your fingers with his curls while you press your lips firmly to his. He\u2019s eager with his mouth, already teasing his tongue along your upper lip. It makes you tingle, because you haven\u2019t tasted him this way for a long time now, haven\u2019t kissed him this way since you were pregnant and <i>God</i> it feels so nice.</p><p>His tongue finds yours, and they\u2019re dancing with one another as your obvious need for one another grows. Harry\u2019s massaging his hand into the top of your thigh while the other slips under his hoodie that you\u2019re wearing to grip at your breast. He\u2019s naive to the pain it causes you, still being sensitive with breast feeding, and you hiss and wince over the feeling.</p><p>You pull away just a little, stroking a hand over the side of his face. \u201cNot there, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He blindly kisses you again, mumbling a little sheepish \u2018sorry\u2019 between pecks to your lips, before he\u2019s back to searching your mouth with his tongue, his hand finding comfort in your waist instead.</p><p>You continue this way for a while, snogging on your sofa like lovesick teenagers about to shag for the first time, because it\u2019s been so long that that\u2019s how it actually feels. And you\u2019re happy with it, because even after your brief low moment after your daughters birth - knowing that your husband still loves you the way he does fills you with something you didn\u2019t know you needed.</p><p>Harry begins to ease you backwards, the hand on your thigh gliding upwards to pull at your jumper, and he hauls it over you before laying you back with your bare skin pressed flush against the fabric of your sofa. He pulls his own t-shirt off before he sandwiches himself between your legs, his hand back to caressing and squeezing your thigh.</p><p>\u201cMissed you.\u201d He mumbles as his eyes adore your naked frame below him. \u201cMissed you like this all the time.\u201d</p><p>You swallow the lump in your throat as you reach for his hand, bringing it to your lips to kiss into his palm. \u201cI love you.\u201d You whisper against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, darlin\u2019. So fuckin\u2019 much.\u201d He hums as he watches you continue to kiss over his hand, but your eyes remain with his. \u201cAlways have been so bloody beautiful, haven\u2019t ya?\u201d His palm squeezes around your thigh again and he rubs his thumb along your lips.</p><p>You know he\u2019s always loved it when you\u2019re a little bit dirty, so you wrap your lips around the tip of his thumb and suck on it the smallest amount. You hear when his breath catches, his length between your legs growing just that bit more in his briefs.</p><p>\u201cFuuucking hell, love.\u201d He drawls, pushing his digit all the way into your mouth until it disappears completely. \u201cLook at you, my God.\u201d</p><p>His words have only got you hotter - and wetter. He can can feel the way you\u2019re trying to squeeze your thighs together to sate the burn you\u2019re experiencing. He leans down and kisses your lips harshly the thumb that was in your mouth now rubbing over the damp spot on your knickers. You whimper against his lips as your hands grip his biceps, and you\u2019re wriggling impatiently against him.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d You breathe against him, thumbs rubbing harsh circles into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWant me to make you feel good, wifey?\u201d He asks lowly, pressing another kiss to the corner of your mouth.</p><p>Your answer is another desperate kiss and your fingers slipping through his curls until they decorate you like rings. You give a gentle tug that you know he likes, and he audibly groans into your mouth.</p><p>He moves sloppy kisses down your body, taking extra care around your breasts after his last hiccup, until he\u2019s nestling himself between your legs. He presses a single kiss to the wet patch of your pants before carefully shimmying them off your legs. You watch him with intrigue as he kisses up the inside of your thigh, ignoring the way his curls slightly tickle your bare legs.</p><p>\u201cSo wet, angel. Think you need this, don\u2019t you?\u201d He hesitates, meeting your gaze as you stop massaging his scalp and just nod at him.</p><p>You\u2019re choking on air when he finally teases your clit with light flicks of his tongue, back to yanking his hair into fists. It feels different this time, like you\u2019re more sensitive to every single move he makes. It has you clinging him to you core before he\u2019s even really started his work, but he\u2019s only finding your quick exasperation encouraging.</p><p>He licks a full stripe between your folds, feeling slightly drunk off the sound you emit from deep within your belly, before dipping his tongue into your dripping heat. Your eyes roll to the back of your head, still desperately fisting at his curls as he fucks you with his tongue for the first time in months.</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit, H.\u201d You pant as your hips jerk upwards involuntarily, and you\u2019re whining as his tongue happens to rub over you in just the right way.</p><p>Harry moves over you at a faster pace, working you up until your vision blurs and you\u2019re seeing stars as your orgasm washes through you. He stills between you while you\u2019re overly sensitive, kissing back down your thighs before wrapping his hands under your back to bring you into his lap.</p><p>You delicately straddle him while you\u2019re still catching your breath, Harry\u2019s arms wrapped tightly around your waist as he leaves wet kisses in random places on your body. He\u2019s muttering \u2018I love you\u2019 after every single one, occasionally meeting your gaze with his gorgeous eyes as you watch him.</p><p>When he finally kisses your lips again you can only really taste yourself, but it still doesn\u2019t bother you. \u201cCan\u2019t believe how lucky I am.\u201d He\u2019s feeling sentimental as he loves on you a bit more.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot m\u2019self a wife as beautiful as you, <i>and</i> you gave me a beautiful daughter, <i>and</i> you still know all the ways to get me stiff.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help but giggle at him, pushing your fingers through his growing curls. \u201cSounds like a catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 <i>dreamboat</i>.\u201d He hums as he leans in to press a hard kiss to your lips. \u201cWouldn\u2019t change you for the world, y\u2019know that?\u201d</p><p>You still haven\u2019t completely calmed down yet, but he\u2019s making you feel so good you\u2019re basically ready to go again. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head head as caresses his hands from the small of your back, around your hips to the tops of your thighs and back again. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even my bitter humour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not even. In fact, apart from your arse that\u2019s my favourite thing about you.\u201d He insists as he presses a lingering kiss to your lips, his hands stopping at the tops of your thighs again.</p><p>You roll your hips into his, and you hear the throaty he lets out as you graze over his restricted bulge.</p><p>\u201cFuck, do that again.\u201d He begs breathlessly.</p><p>You do as he asks, rolling over his length and into his hips, and his moan comes out longer and louder as he squeezes your thighs much harder.</p><p>\u201cWant you in me, Harry.\u201d You admit quietly, tugging a few stray curls at the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He heaves, desperation cloaking his eyes. \u201cThat what you want? Make y\u2019feel good again?\u201d</p><p>You nod quickly.</p><p>\u201cOh fucking hell, I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d Harry chuckles, stroking his hands once up and down your sides before reaching between his legs to free his aching cock, not wasting any time with removing his briefs.</p><p>You inch forwards, steadying yourself with a grip on his shoulders before lowering your still wet heat onto his ridiculous length. You hiss as he fills you up, stretching you somehow even after giving birth, and he\u2019s releasing another guttural moan.</p><p>He\u2019s rocking into you slowly, pressing sloppy kiss into the top of your sternum between your breasts. \u201cChrist alive, you feel good.\u201d He growls into your chest as you pick up a gentle pace to match his. \u201cAlways were a tight little thing, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>You whimper, coaxing his lips to yours by gripping the sides of his face to moan into his mouth. His arms hold a vice-like grip around your back, keeping you as close to him as you gradually pick up your pace.</p><p>You can feel him well within you, and you know if you were to adjust yourself ever so slightly he\u2019d hit that place you needed.</p><p>\u201cI love you so fuckin\u2019 much, angel.\u201d He whines against your lips, tugging your bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head against him and suck on his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d He pleads.</p><p>You nod quickly. \u201cI promise.\u201d You choke out, and his hips jut unnaturally in pace, throwing you off slightly.</p><p>He keeps his grip on you, both arms stretched upwards across the expanse of your back so that his hands are close to having a decent grip on your shoulders. He adopts a quicker pace, out of time with you, and you just so happen to slip so that he finds that place you were holding off on.</p><p>You cry out as your orgasm takes a hold of you, keeping your lips forced on Harry\u2019s as your body stiffens. He holds you there as he grunts through his own high, and you can feel his hot release spreading into your own heat.</p><p>As the two of you relax into one another the room grows quiet and still, nothing to be heard but your heavy breathing. You\u2019re both feeling a bit sticky, and it used to be ritual that you\u2019d shower together after.</p><p>You twist your head to press a line of kisses along his jaw, and you can feel the shift against your lips when he smiles. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d</p><p>Harry giggles and peers down at you, placing a soft kiss to your lips. \u201cWas, wasn\u2019t it? What do you say to round two in the shower?\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Thank ya muchly!</p><p>Tag list:\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a></p>",

This is a part 2 to <a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/183562173739/hi-babe-could-you-maybe-write-something-about-yn\">this blurb</a>!</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i>A miracle was what it was. The fact that your daughter had slept a whole night in her own room without a peep for the first time <i>ever</i>. You\u2019d been slowly putting it into practice over the past week or so, every night tucking her into her cot rather than the basket beside your bed. And every night she\u2019d wake at some point, all but screaming the house down for attention from either of you. Each night she\u2019d slept in the room a little longer than the one before, but it seemed impossible to get a whole night\u2019s sleep out of her without hearing a wink.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Until last night. Sure she\u2019d woken up at six in the morning and screamed then instead, but you were willing to accept that. She normally woke an hour later anyway.</p><p>The fact that she had slept a whole night was an exciting prospect, especially for Harry.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spare load of nappies, three changes of clothes and her pyjamas,\u201d You fawn over the contents of your bag with Anne, trying to remember everything you\u2019d put in, \u201cthere\u2019s wipes and a two cloths in the side pocket because she really can make a mess on you when she\u2019s sick, and I left a pack of those biscuits for her as well.\u201d</p><p>Those baby biscuits that your husband has a tendency to eat himself\u2026</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d Harry rests a hand on your arm,</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s had babies, remember?\u201d He reminds you with a teasing smile, his whole presence screaming at you to stop fussing.</p><p>\u201cLeave her be, Harry.\u201d Anne shakes her head at him, your little girl bouncing on her hip, \u201cit\u2019s her first night away from her, just\u2026 let her say what she needs to.\u201d</p><p>Harry raises a hand defensively but he still refuses to let you go. He\u2019s been like that a lot, ever since you had that chat all those mornings ago he\u2019s been all but glued to your hip, insistent on having at least just a hand on you at all times.</p><p>You\u2019re grateful for it, though. You\u2019ve definitely learned a lesson when it comes to your marriage, and you\u2019ve never been happier that Harry is your husband.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve got toys for her but she\u2019s obsessed with this plush bear so I\u2019ve packed that as well. She\u2019ll only scream otherwise.\u201d You glance around yourself with a little pout. \u201cI think\u2026 that\u2019s everything.\u201d</p><p>Anne smiles and nods once at you. \u201cPerfect, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re gonna have the best time. Aren\u2019t we poppet?\u201d She coos at your daughter, who\u2019s delighted by Nanny\u2019s random appearance at six o\u2019clock on a Thursday.</p><p>You take her from Anne one last time while Harry loads the bags into the car, cuddling her one last time. Fortunately for Anne, she looks just about ready for bed by the way her cheeks are a little flush and her eyelids are heavy. It\u2019s a little early perhaps but Harry had made his best effort to wear her out so all his mum had to do was put her to bed. The past three hours had been chaos.</p><p>\u201cGonna be a good girl for Nanny, eh?\u201d You whisper quietly to her as her tiny hands cling to the neck of your t-shirt. \u201cBe really good for her, yeah? Just like you are for me and Daddy.\u201d</p><p>You feather her face with light kisses until she\u2019s pulling away with tired irritation, but only makes a small whimper. You don\u2019t really want to let her go, but you know it\u2019s probably a good thing that Anne\u2019s given you the opportunity to have a night with just Harry again.</p><p>It\u2019s painful as you watch the car drive away with your angel already half passed out, but you know you\u2019ll have her right back in the morning and that\u2019s all you need to remind yourself.</p><p>Once the car is out of sight you silently make your way back inside, and suddenly the house feels eerily quiet. You look around your front room with pursed lips as you think of where to start tidying up. There\u2019s toys all over the floor, a mess Harry created on his mission to wear your daughter out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing, love?\u201d Harry asks quietly as he watches you piling toys into the toy box.</p><p>You look over your shoulder to see him stood in the doorway smirking at you. \u201cTidying up after you.\u201d You mumble your reply and get back to work.</p><p>Harry sighs and follows suit. He was about to tell you to leave it and do it in the morning, but he also knows you well enough by now that suggesting that would prompt an argument neither of you want to have on your first night alone together since having your nipper. Plus -he doesn\u2019t particularly want to sit with a takeaway and a bottle of wine while there\u2019s fucking colourful toys all over the floor.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d you breathe heavily as you set your plate on the coffee table, \u201cenjoyed that more than I thought I would.</p><p>Up until that moment, the only noise for the past twenty minutes had been the low hum of the film on the tv and the scraping of cutlery against plates, sometimes accompanied with a slosh of wine in a wine glass. Prior to that he\u2019d ran you a bath, which admittedly you hadn\u2019t spent very long in because you were too hungry, but it was a nice touch nonetheless. Now you\u2019re sat lazily on the sofa with your husband beside you in nothing but his hoodie and your knickers. It was the most relaxed evening you\u2019ve had since giving birth.</p><p>Harry giggles as he pulls you back into his side, his arms wrapping around your waist while he presses soft kisses into your hair. \u201cCurry was a good idea then, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d You nod your head furiously against his chest, your hand slipping under the soft cotton of his t-shirt to rest on his slightly swollen belly from dinner. \u201cCan\u2019t remember the last time we had a good curry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not since you got pregnant\u2026 and I\u2019m pretty sure it was a while before that, too.\u201d Harry muses aloud, one hand lightly rubbing up and down your back.</p><p>\u201cI think it was that night you randomly turned up after tour, you know. When you said you weren\u2019t coming home for a few more days originally but you changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Harry stares ahead of himself for a moment in contemplation. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even married then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You hum a little laugh and place a small kiss to his stubbled jaw. \u201c<i>That\u2019s</i> how long it\u2019s been since we had a curry.\u201d</p><p>Your husband smirks and glances down at you, a weird and familiar glint in his eye. \u201cDo you remember what we did that night?\u201d</p><p>You laugh at how cheeky and obvious he is. \u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the fact that we did it on the stairs and you got carpet burn on your back, then yes; I remember.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles darkly, and you\u2019re shaking your head at his silliness. \u201cWas worth it, though. Fancy doing it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of us are in a good enough state physically to fuck on the staircase, Harry.\u201d You remind him with a frown. In fact the thought alone is making you wince.</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d He mumbles flatly, but the pull of his lips and the dimples screams that he\u2019s pissing around. \u201cI for one think I\u2019d perform perfectly fine on the staircase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo have a wank on it then.\u201d You mutter dryly, but it only has him laughing louder as his arms tighten around you.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my wife - my filthy mouthed, brash and blunt wifey. Where\u2019ve you been, eh?\u201d He teases as he shakes you gently, peppering kisses into the side of your face.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 after our baby. Can\u2019t say shit like that in front of a child, can I?\u201d You retort, while his kisses inch closer to your lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry wonders, his voice coming much lower than it had done a moment ago, \u201cpretty sure I\u2019ve heard you say \u2018bollocks\u2019 in front of her a few times.\u201d</p><p>That makes you giggle, and you\u2019re hyper aware of his hand that\u2019s managed to sneak it\u2019s way to your thigh, which doesn\u2019t help your giggling. \u201cUsually under my breath, though. I\u2019m not a complete arsehole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill <i>in front</i> of a baby.\u201d He murmurs into the corner of your mouth.</p><p>You roll your eyes eyes, but his advances have you leaning into him rather than away from him, the proximity of his hand igniting that fire in your core. \u201cWell now you\u2019re just being pedantic. And besides, I actually could\u2019ve been behind her.\u201d</p><p>Harry produces a single pitched hum as he pulls you in closer somehow, pulling your lower lip between his teeth. \u201cNow who\u2019s being pedantic?\u201d</p><p>Your laugh is dirty, but you\u2019re far more concerned with the fact that your husband\u2019s hand is inching closer to the space between your legs. You move your arms to wrap around his neck, tangling your fingers with his curls while you press your lips firmly to his. He\u2019s eager with his mouth, already teasing his tongue along your upper lip. It makes you tingle, because you haven\u2019t tasted him this way for a long time now, haven\u2019t kissed him this way since you were pregnant and <i>God</i> it feels so nice.</p><p>His tongue finds yours, and they\u2019re dancing with one another as your obvious need for one another grows. Harry\u2019s massaging his hand into the top of your thigh while the other slips under his hoodie that you\u2019re wearing to grip at your breast. He\u2019s naive to the pain it causes you, still being sensitive with breast feeding, and you hiss and wince over the feeling.</p><p>You pull away just a little, stroking a hand over the side of his face. \u201cNot there, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He blindly kisses you again, mumbling a little sheepish \u2018sorry\u2019 between pecks to your lips, before he\u2019s back to searching your mouth with his tongue, his hand finding comfort in your waist instead.</p><p>You continue this way for a while, snogging on your sofa like lovesick teenagers about to shag for the first time, because it\u2019s been so long that that\u2019s how it actually feels. And you\u2019re happy with it, because even after your brief low moment after your daughters birth - knowing that your husband still loves you the way he does fills you with something you didn\u2019t know you needed.</p><p>Harry begins to ease you backwards, the hand on your thigh gliding upwards to pull at your jumper, and he hauls it over you before laying you back with your bare skin pressed flush against the fabric of your sofa. He pulls his own t-shirt off before he sandwiches himself between your legs, his hand back to caressing and squeezing your thigh.</p><p>\u201cMissed you.\u201d He mumbles as his eyes adore your naked frame below him. \u201cMissed you like this all the time.\u201d</p><p>You swallow the lump in your throat as you reach for his hand, bringing it to your lips to kiss into his palm. \u201cI love you.\u201d You whisper against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, darlin\u2019. So fuckin\u2019 much.\u201d He hums as he watches you continue to kiss over his hand, but your eyes remain with his. \u201cAlways have been so bloody beautiful, haven\u2019t ya?\u201d His palm squeezes around your thigh again and he rubs his thumb along your lips.</p><p>You know he\u2019s always loved it when you\u2019re a little bit dirty, so you wrap your lips around the tip of his thumb and suck on it the smallest amount. You hear when his breath catches, his length between your legs growing just that bit more in his briefs.</p><p>\u201cFuuucking hell, love.\u201d He drawls, pushing his digit all the way into your mouth until it disappears completely. \u201cLook at you, my God.\u201d</p><p>His words have only got you hotter - and wetter. He can can feel the way you\u2019re trying to squeeze your thighs together to sate the burn you\u2019re experiencing. He leans down and kisses your lips harshly the thumb that was in your mouth now rubbing over the damp spot on your knickers. You whimper against his lips as your hands grip his biceps, and you\u2019re wriggling impatiently against him.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d You breathe against him, thumbs rubbing harsh circles into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWant me to make you feel good, wifey?\u201d He asks lowly, pressing another kiss to the corner of your mouth.</p><p>Your answer is another desperate kiss and your fingers slipping through his curls until they decorate you like rings. You give a gentle tug that you know he likes, and he audibly groans into your mouth.</p><p>He moves sloppy kisses down your body, taking extra care around your breasts after his last hiccup, until he\u2019s nestling himself between your legs. He presses a single kiss to the wet patch of your pants before carefully shimmying them off your legs. You watch him with intrigue as he kisses up the inside of your thigh, ignoring the way his curls slightly tickle your bare legs.</p><p>\u201cSo wet, angel. Think you need this, don\u2019t you?\u201d He hesitates, meeting your gaze as you stop massaging his scalp and just nod at him.</p><p>You\u2019re choking on air when he finally teases your clit with light flicks of his tongue, back to yanking his hair into fists. It feels different this time, like you\u2019re more sensitive to every single move he makes. It has you clinging him to you core before he\u2019s even really started his work, but he\u2019s only finding your quick exasperation encouraging.</p><p>He licks a full stripe between your folds, feeling slightly drunk off the sound you emit from deep within your belly, before dipping his tongue into your dripping heat. Your eyes roll to the back of your head, still desperately fisting at his curls as he fucks you with his tongue for the first time in months.</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit, H.\u201d You pant as your hips jerk upwards involuntarily, and you\u2019re whining as his tongue happens to rub over you in just the right way.</p><p>Harry moves over you at a faster pace, working you up until your vision blurs and you\u2019re seeing stars as your orgasm washes through you. He stills between you while you\u2019re overly sensitive, kissing back down your thighs before wrapping his hands under your back to bring you into his lap.</p><p>You delicately straddle him while you\u2019re still catching your breath, Harry\u2019s arms wrapped tightly around your waist as he leaves wet kisses in random places on your body. He\u2019s muttering \u2018I love you\u2019 after every single one, occasionally meeting your gaze with his gorgeous eyes as you watch him.</p><p>When he finally kisses your lips again you can only really taste yourself, but it still doesn\u2019t bother you. \u201cCan\u2019t believe how lucky I am.\u201d He\u2019s feeling sentimental as he loves on you a bit more.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot m\u2019self a wife as beautiful as you, <i>and</i> you gave me a beautiful daughter, <i>and</i> you still know all the ways to get me stiff.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help but giggle at him, pushing your fingers through his growing curls. \u201cSounds like a catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 <i>dreamboat</i>.\u201d He hums as he leans in to press a hard kiss to your lips. \u201cWouldn\u2019t change you for the world, y\u2019know that?\u201d</p><p>You still haven\u2019t completely calmed down yet, but he\u2019s making you feel so good you\u2019re basically ready to go again. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>Harry shakes his head head as caresses his hands from the small of your back, around your hips to the tops of your thighs and back again. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even my bitter humour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not even. In fact, apart from your arse that\u2019s my favourite thing about you.\u201d He insists as he presses a lingering kiss to your lips, his hands stopping at the tops of your thighs again.</p><p>You roll your hips into his, and you hear the throaty he lets out as you graze over his restricted bulge.</p><p>\u201cFuck, do that again.\u201d He begs breathlessly.</p><p>You do as he asks, rolling over his length and into his hips, and his moan comes out longer and louder as he squeezes your thighs much harder.</p><p>\u201cWant you in me, Harry.\u201d You admit quietly, tugging a few stray curls at the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He heaves, desperation cloaking his eyes. \u201cThat what you want? Make y\u2019feel good again?\u201d</p><p>You nod quickly.</p><p>\u201cOh fucking hell, I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d Harry chuckles, stroking his hands once up and down your sides before reaching between his legs to free his aching cock, not wasting any time with removing his briefs.</p><p>You inch forwards, steadying yourself with a grip on his shoulders before lowering your still wet heat onto his ridiculous length. You hiss as he fills you up, stretching you somehow even after giving birth, and he\u2019s releasing another guttural moan.</p><p>He\u2019s rocking into you slowly, pressing sloppy kiss into the top of your sternum between your breasts. \u201cChrist alive, you feel good.\u201d He growls into your chest as you pick up a gentle pace to match his. \u201cAlways were a tight little thing, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>You whimper, coaxing his lips to yours by gripping the sides of his face to moan into his mouth. His arms hold a vice-like grip around your back, keeping you as close to him as you gradually pick up your pace.</p><p>You can feel him well within you, and you know if you were to adjust yourself ever so slightly he\u2019d hit that place you needed.</p><p>\u201cI love you so fuckin\u2019 much, angel.\u201d He whines against your lips, tugging your bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head against him and suck on his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d He pleads.</p><p>You nod quickly. \u201cI promise.\u201d You choke out, and his hips jut unnaturally in pace, throwing you off slightly.</p><p>He keeps his grip on you, both arms stretched upwards across the expanse of your back so that his hands are close to having a decent grip on your shoulders. He adopts a quicker pace, out of time with you, and you just so happen to slip so that he finds that place you were holding off on.</p><p>You cry out as your orgasm takes a hold of you, keeping your lips forced on Harry\u2019s as your body stiffens. He holds you there as he grunts through his own high, and you can feel his hot release spreading into your own heat.</p><p>As the two of you relax into one another the room grows quiet and still, nothing to be heard but your heavy breathing. You\u2019re both feeling a bit sticky, and it used to be ritual that you\u2019d shower together after.</p><p>You twist your head to press a line of kisses along his jaw, and you can feel the shift against your lips when he smiles. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d</p><p>Harry giggles and peers down at you, placing a soft kiss to your lips. \u201cWas, wasn\u2019t it?

This is a part 2 to <a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/183562173739/hi-babe-could-you-maybe-write-something-about-yn\">this blurb</a>!</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i>A miracle was what it was. The fact that your daughter had slept a whole night in her own room without a peep for the first time <i>ever</i>. You&rsquo;d been slowly putting it into practice over the past week or so, every night tucking her into her cot rather than the basket beside your bed. And every night she&rsquo;d wake at some point, all but screaming the house down for attention from either of you. Each night she&rsquo;d slept in the room a little longer than the one before, but it seemed impossible to get a whole night&rsquo;s sleep out of her without hearing a wink.</p><p>Until last night. Sure she&rsquo;d woken up at six in the morning and screamed then instead, but you were willing to accept that. She normally woke an hour later anyway.</p><p>The fact that she had slept a whole night was an exciting prospect, especially for Harry.</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a spare load of nappies, three changes of clothes and her pyjamas,&rdquo; You fawn over the contents of your bag with Anne, trying to remember everything you&rsquo;d put in, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s wipes and a two cloths in the side pocket because she really can make a mess on you when she&rsquo;s sick, and I left a pack of those biscuits for her as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Those baby biscuits that your husband has a tendency to eat himself&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; Harry rests a hand on your arm,</p><p>&ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s had babies, remember?&rdquo; He reminds you with a teasing smile, his whole presence screaming at you to stop fussing.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave her be, Harry.&rdquo; Anne shakes her head at him, your little girl bouncing on her hip, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s her first night away from her, just&hellip; let her say what she needs to.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry raises a hand defensively but he still refuses to let you go. He&rsquo;s been like that a lot, ever since you had that chat all those mornings ago he&rsquo;s been all but glued to your hip, insistent on having at least just a hand on you at all times.</p><p>You&rsquo;re grateful for it, though. You&rsquo;ve definitely learned a lesson when it comes to your marriage, and you&rsquo;ve never been happier that Harry is your husband.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve got toys for her but she&rsquo;s obsessed with this plush bear so I&rsquo;ve packed that as well. She&rsquo;ll only scream otherwise.&rdquo; You glance around yourself with a little pout. &ldquo;I think&hellip; that&rsquo;s everything.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne smiles and nods once at you. &ldquo;Perfect, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re gonna have the best time. Aren&rsquo;t we poppet?&rdquo; She coos at your daughter, who&rsquo;s delighted by Nanny&rsquo;s random appearance at six o&rsquo;clock on a Thursday.</p><p>You take her from Anne one last time while Harry loads the bags into the car, cuddling her one last time. Fortunately for Anne, she looks just about ready for bed by the way her cheeks are a little flush and her eyelids are heavy. It&rsquo;s a little early perhaps but Harry had made his best effort to wear her out so all his mum had to do was put her to bed. The past three hours had been chaos.</p><p>&ldquo;Gonna be a good girl for Nanny, eh?&rdquo; You whisper quietly to her as her tiny hands cling to the neck of your t-shirt. &ldquo;Be really good for her, yeah? Just like you are for me and Daddy.&rdquo;</p><p>You feather her face with light kisses until she&rsquo;s pulling away with tired irritation, but only makes a small whimper. You don&rsquo;t really want to let her go, but you know it&rsquo;s probably a good thing that Anne&rsquo;s given you the opportunity to have a night with just Harry again.</p><p>It&rsquo;s painful as you watch the car drive away with your angel already half passed out, but you know you&rsquo;ll have her right back in the morning and that&rsquo;s all you need to remind yourself.</p><p>Once the car is out of sight you silently make your way back inside, and suddenly the house feels eerily quiet. You look around your front room with pursed lips as you think of where to start tidying up. There&rsquo;s toys all over the floor, a mess Harry created on his mission to wear your daughter out.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing, love?&rdquo; Harry asks quietly as he watches you piling toys into the toy box.</p><p>You look over your shoulder to see him stood in the doorway smirking at you. &ldquo;Tidying up after you.&rdquo; You mumble your reply and get back to work.</p><p>Harry sighs and follows suit. He was about to tell you to leave it and do it in the morning, but he also knows you well enough by now that suggesting that would prompt an argument neither of you want to have on your first night alone together since having your nipper. Plus -he doesn&rsquo;t particularly want to sit with a takeaway and a bottle of wine while there&rsquo;s fucking colourful toys all over the floor.</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Bloody hell,&rdquo; you breathe heavily as you set your plate on the coffee table, &ldquo;enjoyed that more than I thought I would.</p><p>Up until that moment, the only noise for the past twenty minutes had been the low hum of the film on the tv and the scraping of cutlery against plates, sometimes accompanied with a slosh of wine in a wine glass. Prior to that he&rsquo;d ran you a bath, which admittedly you hadn&rsquo;t spent very long in because you were too hungry, but it was a nice touch nonetheless. Now you&rsquo;re sat lazily on the sofa with your husband beside you in nothing but his hoodie and your knickers. It was the most relaxed evening you&rsquo;ve had since giving birth.</p><p>Harry giggles as he pulls you back into his side, his arms wrapping around your waist while he presses soft kisses into your hair. &ldquo;Curry was a good idea then, eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; You nod your head furiously against his chest, your hand slipping under the soft cotton of his t-shirt to rest on his slightly swollen belly from dinner. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t remember the last time we had a good curry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely not since you got pregnant&hellip; and I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was a while before that, too.&rdquo; Harry muses aloud, one hand lightly rubbing up and down your back.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it was that night you randomly turned up after tour, you know. When you said you weren&rsquo;t coming home for a few more days originally but you changed your mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stares ahead of himself for a moment in contemplation. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t even married then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; You hum a little laugh and place a small kiss to his stubbled jaw. &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> how long it&rsquo;s been since we had a curry.&rdquo;</p><p>Your husband smirks and glances down at you, a weird and familiar glint in his eye. &ldquo;Do you remember what we did that night?&rdquo;</p><p>You laugh at how cheeky and obvious he is. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re referring to the fact that we did it on the stairs and you got carpet burn on your back, then yes; I remember.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckles darkly, and you&rsquo;re shaking your head at his silliness. &ldquo;Was worth it, though. Fancy doing it again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither of us are in a good enough state physically to fuck on the staircase, Harry.&rdquo; You remind him with a frown. In fact the thought alone is making you wince.</p><p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself.&rdquo; He mumbles flatly, but the pull of his lips and the dimples screams that he&rsquo;s pissing around. &ldquo;I for one think I&rsquo;d perform perfectly fine on the staircase.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go have a wank on it then.&rdquo; You mutter dryly, but it only has him laughing louder as his arms tighten around you.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my wife - my filthy mouthed, brash and blunt wifey. Where&rsquo;ve you been, eh?&rdquo; He teases as he shakes you gently, peppering kisses into the side of your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Lookin&rsquo; after our baby. Can&rsquo;t say shit like that in front of a child, can I?&rdquo; You retort, while his kisses inch closer to your lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Harry wonders, his voice coming much lower than it had done a moment ago, &ldquo;pretty sure I&rsquo;ve heard you say &lsquo;bollocks&rsquo; in front of her a few times.&rdquo;</p><p>That makes you giggle, and you&rsquo;re hyper aware of his hand that&rsquo;s managed to sneak it&rsquo;s way to your thigh, which doesn&rsquo;t help your giggling. &ldquo;Usually under my breath, though. I&rsquo;m not a complete arsehole.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still <i>in front</i> of a baby.&rdquo; He murmurs into the corner of your mouth.</p><p>You roll your eyes eyes, but his advances have you leaning into him rather than away from him, the proximity of his hand igniting that fire in your core. &ldquo;Well now you&rsquo;re just being pedantic. And besides, I actually could&rsquo;ve been behind her.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry produces a single pitched hum as he pulls you in closer somehow, pulling your lower lip between his teeth. &ldquo;Now who&rsquo;s being pedantic?&rdquo;</p><p>Your laugh is dirty, but you&rsquo;re far more concerned with the fact that your husband&rsquo;s hand is inching closer to the space between your legs. You move your arms to wrap around his neck, tangling your fingers with his curls while you press your lips firmly to his. He&rsquo;s eager with his mouth, already teasing his tongue along your upper lip. It makes you tingle, because you haven&rsquo;t tasted him this way for a long time now, haven&rsquo;t kissed him this way since you were pregnant and <i>God</i> it feels so nice.</p><p>His tongue finds yours, and they&rsquo;re dancing with one another as your obvious need for one another grows. Harry&rsquo;s massaging his hand into the top of your thigh while the other slips under his hoodie that you&rsquo;re wearing to grip at your breast. He&rsquo;s naive to the pain it causes you, still being sensitive with breast feeding, and you hiss and wince over the feeling.</p><p>You pull away just a little, stroking a hand over the side of his face. &ldquo;Not there, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>He blindly kisses you again, mumbling a little sheepish &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; between pecks to your lips, before he&rsquo;s back to searching your mouth with his tongue, his hand finding comfort in your waist instead.</p><p>You continue this way for a while, snogging on your sofa like lovesick teenagers about to shag for the first time, because it&rsquo;s been so long that that&rsquo;s how it actually feels. And you&rsquo;re happy with it, because even after your brief low moment after your daughters birth - knowing that your husband still loves you the way he does fills you with something you didn&rsquo;t know you needed.</p><p>Harry begins to ease you backwards, the hand on your thigh gliding upwards to pull at your jumper, and he hauls it over you before laying you back with your bare skin pressed flush against the fabric of your sofa. He pulls his own t-shirt off before he sandwiches himself between your legs, his hand back to caressing and squeezing your thigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Missed you.&rdquo; He mumbles as his eyes adore your naked frame below him. &ldquo;Missed you like this all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>You swallow the lump in your throat as you reach for his hand, bringing it to your lips to kiss into his palm. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; You whisper against his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, darlin&rsquo;. So fuckin&rsquo; much.&rdquo; He hums as he watches you continue to kiss over his hand, but your eyes remain with his. &ldquo;Always have been so bloody beautiful, haven&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo; His palm squeezes around your thigh again and he rubs his thumb along your lips.</p><p>You know he&rsquo;s always loved it when you&rsquo;re a little bit dirty, so you wrap your lips around the tip of his thumb and suck on it the smallest amount. You hear when his breath catches, his length between your legs growing just that bit more in his briefs.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuuucking hell, love.&rdquo; He drawls, pushing his digit all the way into your mouth until it disappears completely. &ldquo;Look at you, my God.&rdquo;</p><p>His words have only got you hotter - and wetter. He can can feel the way you&rsquo;re trying to squeeze your thighs together to sate the burn you&rsquo;re experiencing. He leans down and kisses your lips harshly the thumb that was in your mouth now rubbing over the damp spot on your knickers. You whimper against his lips as your hands grip his biceps, and you&rsquo;re wriggling impatiently against him.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&hellip;&rdquo; You breathe against him, thumbs rubbing harsh circles into his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Want me to make you feel good, wifey?&rdquo; He asks lowly, pressing another kiss to the corner of your mouth.</p><p>Your answer is another desperate kiss and your fingers slipping through his curls until they decorate you like rings. You give a gentle tug that you know he likes, and he audibly groans into your mouth.</p><p>He moves sloppy kisses down your body, taking extra care around your breasts after his last hiccup, until he&rsquo;s nestling himself between your legs. He presses a single kiss to the wet patch of your pants before carefully shimmying them off your legs. You watch him with intrigue as he kisses up the inside of your thigh, ignoring the way his curls slightly tickle your bare legs.</p><p>&ldquo;So wet, angel. Think you need this, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He hesitates, meeting your gaze as you stop massaging his scalp and just nod at him.</p><p>You&rsquo;re choking on air when he finally teases your clit with light flicks of his tongue, back to yanking his hair into fists. It feels different this time, like you&rsquo;re more sensitive to every single move he makes. It has you clinging him to you core before he&rsquo;s even really started his work, but he&rsquo;s only finding your quick exasperation encouraging.</p><p>He licks a full stripe between your folds, feeling slightly drunk off the sound you emit from deep within your belly, before dipping his tongue into your dripping heat. Your eyes roll to the back of your head, still desperately fisting at his curls as he fucks you with his tongue for the first time in months.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy fucking shit, H.&rdquo; You pant as your hips jerk upwards involuntarily, and you&rsquo;re whining as his tongue happens to rub over you in just the right way.</p><p>Harry moves over you at a faster pace, working you up until your vision blurs and you&rsquo;re seeing stars as your orgasm washes through you. He stills between you while you&rsquo;re overly sensitive, kissing back down your thighs before wrapping his hands under your back to bring you into his lap.</p><p>You delicately straddle him while you&rsquo;re still catching your breath, Harry&rsquo;s arms wrapped tightly around your waist as he leaves wet kisses in random places on your body. He&rsquo;s muttering &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; after every single one, occasionally meeting your gaze with his gorgeous eyes as you watch him.</p><p>When he finally kisses your lips again you can only really taste yourself, but it still doesn&rsquo;t bother you. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe how lucky I am.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s feeling sentimental as he loves on you a bit more.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got m&rsquo;self a wife as beautiful as you, <i>and</i> you gave me a beautiful daughter, <i>and</i> you still know all the ways to get me stiff.&rdquo;</p><p>You can&rsquo;t help but giggle at him, pushing your fingers through his growing curls. &ldquo;Sounds like a catch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fuckin&rsquo; <i>dreamboat</i>.&rdquo; He hums as he leans in to press a hard kiss to your lips. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t change you for the world, y&rsquo;know that?&rdquo;</p><p>You still haven&rsquo;t completely calmed down yet, but he&rsquo;s making you feel so good you&rsquo;re basically ready to go again. &ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shakes his head head as caresses his hands from the small of your back, around your hips to the tops of your thighs and back again. &ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not even my bitter humour?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, not even. In fact, apart from your arse that&rsquo;s my favourite thing about you.&rdquo; He insists as he presses a lingering kiss to your lips, his hands stopping at the tops of your thighs again.</p><p>You roll your hips into his, and you hear the throaty he lets out as you graze over his restricted bulge.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, do that again.&rdquo; He begs breathlessly.</p><p>You do as he asks, rolling over his length and into his hips, and his moan comes out longer and louder as he squeezes your thighs much harder.</p><p>&ldquo;Want you in me, Harry.&rdquo; You admit quietly, tugging a few stray curls at the nape of his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He heaves, desperation cloaking his eyes. &ldquo;That what you want? Make y&rsquo;feel good again?&rdquo;</p><p>You nod quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fucking hell, I don&rsquo;t deserve you.&rdquo; Harry chuckles, stroking his hands once up and down your sides before reaching between his legs to free his aching cock, not wasting any time with removing his briefs.</p><p>You inch forwards, steadying yourself with a grip on his shoulders before lowering your still wet heat onto his ridiculous length. You hiss as he fills you up, stretching you somehow even after giving birth, and he&rsquo;s releasing another guttural moan.</p><p>He&rsquo;s rocking into you slowly, pressing sloppy kiss into the top of your sternum between your breasts. &ldquo;Christ alive, you feel good.&rdquo; He growls into your chest as you pick up a gentle pace to match his. &ldquo;Always were a tight little thing, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>You whimper, coaxing his lips to yours by gripping the sides of his face to moan into his mouth. His arms hold a vice-like grip around your back, keeping you as close to him as you gradually pick up your pace.</p><p>You can feel him well within you, and you know if you were to adjust yourself ever so slightly he&rsquo;d hit that place you needed.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so fuckin&rsquo; much, angel.&rdquo; He whines against your lips, tugging your bottom lip between his teeth. &ldquo;Promise me you won&rsquo;t go anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>You shake your head against him and suck on his upper lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Promise?&rdquo; He pleads.</p><p>You nod quickly. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; You choke out, and his hips jut unnaturally in pace, throwing you off slightly.</p><p>He keeps his grip on you, both arms stretched upwards across the expanse of your back so that his hands are close to having a decent grip on your shoulders. He adopts a quicker pace, out of time with you, and you just so happen to slip so that he finds that place you were holding off on.</p><p>You cry out as your orgasm takes a hold of you, keeping your lips forced on Harry&rsquo;s as your body stiffens. He holds you there as he grunts through his own high, and you can feel his hot release spreading into your own heat.</p><p>As the two of you relax into one another the room grows quiet and still, nothing to be heard but your heavy breathing. You&rsquo;re both feeling a bit sticky, and it used to be ritual that you&rsquo;d shower together after.</p><p>You twist your head to press a line of kisses along his jaw, and you can feel the shift against your lips when he smiles. &ldquo;That was nice.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry giggles and peers down at you, placing a soft kiss to your lips. &ldquo;Was, wasn&rsquo;t it? What do you say to round two in the shower?&rdquo;</p><p>~~~</p><p>Thank ya muchly!</p><p>Tag list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a></p>",

The fact that your daughter had slept a whole night in her own room without a peep for the first time <i>ever</i>. You&rsquo;d been slowly putting it into practice over the past week or so, every night tucking her into her cot rather than the basket beside your bed. And every night she&rsquo;d wake at some point, all but screaming the house down for attention from either of you. Each night she&rsquo;d slept in the room a little longer than the one before, but it seemed impossible to get a whole night&rsquo;s sleep out of her without hearing a wink.</p>\n</p>",
