Hidden beneath the thick paste of foundation (<i>thank you Lisa</i>), logically he knew they\ncouldn\u2019t be seen, but he still tugged at the collar of his jumper, nervous.\nJungkook had asked him to come over, had wanted his <i>company</i>, so why did he feel like a trespasser?</p><p>His pale hands trembled in the\ncold and, clenched in one fist, the bag of cheap take-out swung in the wind. He\nhoped it hadn\u2019t gotten too cold during the drive over.</p><p>He took a deep breath and\nknocked.</p><p>***</p><p>Yoongi has always been content\nwith silence. It\u2019s comfortable, the idea of being within ones own space, not\nneeding to focus or condense his thoughts into an organised train of dialogue. He\n<i>likes</i> silence. He does not, however, enjoy\nsitting across from Jungkook in the living room, while said boy says nothing\nand frowns at the wall.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to break\nthrough whatever thought processes the younger man was struggling through, but\nhe couldn\u2019t stand the awkwardness in the air.</p><p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t respond so he edged\nforward to the edge of his seat and said it again. \u201cJungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Was the reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to come over and\nI\u2019ve brought some food\u2026 Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d And Yoongi trailed into\nsilence, biting his lip.</p><p>Jungkook looked good, even in\nsweatpants and a ratty grey hoodie he was messing with Yoongi\u2019s heart. Tired\neyes and dark hair ruffled as if he\u2019d been running his hands through it, Jeon\njungkook was the epitome of what Yoongi would begrudgingly admit being his \u2018ideal\ntype\u2019. The younger man yawned and he was struck with the desire to curl up\nbetween his legs and sleep against his chest \u2013 it looked warm and firm enough\nto be the most comfortable pillow. Yoongi sort of wanted to cry.</p><p>\u201cWant something to drink,\nhyung?\u201d Jungkook suddenly asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Please,\u201d Yoongi\nsaid.</p><p>\u201cCoffee? Tea?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi looked down. \u201cDo you\npossibly have any hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fan of bitter things,\nhmm?\u201d Jungkook smirked and Yoongi blushed, the double entendre not lost on him.</p><p>\u201cSome bitter things can be\nnice,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut I really like sweet things more.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook hummed, muttered something\nunder his breath that could\u2019ve been <i>you\u2019re\nso cute</i>, and headed to the kitchen.</p><p>Yoongi stayed on the sofa,\nslightly star struck. He wanted to believe he\u2019d heard correctly, that his mind\nhadn\u2019t been playing tricks on him, but it was too much to hope for. It was too much\nto dare imagine that the boy he was half in love with \u2013 it didn\u2019t matter that\nhe hadn\u2019t known him for very long \u2013 could maybe, possibly, hopefully like him\nback? Maybe?</p><p>\u201cMilk? In your hot chocolate?\u201d\nJungkook called from the kitchen and Yoongi gave an affirmative as he stood up\nto peer around the room.</p><p>A book shelf lay opposite, two\nrows of books with a row of photo frames sandwiched between them, and all of\nthem slightly dusty. Yoongi chuckled as he looked at each one \u2013 Jungkook and\nJimin grinning at the camera with their arms around each other, Taehyung laughing\nas Jungkook struggled to hold onto an angry tomcat, Jimin and Taehyung hugging\nJungkook from either side \u2013 in every photo, they looked happy, so happy with\neach other and it tugged at Yoongi\u2019s heartstrings. Jungkook\u2019s smile, thinner\ntop lip and full bottom lip, two small indentations where his front teeth had\nbitten down, a bunny smile. </p><p>He nudged them aside to see\nthe photos hidden behind the first row and smiled again \u2013 Jungkook and a boy so\nalike him in looks that it must\u2019ve been his brother, three photos of the sun\nrising over Busan, an older couple waving at the camera with their hands\nlinked. The photographer was incredibly talented.</p><p>Pushed into the corner, however,\nwas another picture. Blurry and clearly taken mid-movement, Yoongi hesitated in\ntouching it, in recognising that someone he didn\u2019t know was touching Jungkook\nlike that, smiling at him like that, kissing him <i>like that</i>. In the photo, Jungkook was smiling at the camera, both\nhis hands thrown around the neck of another man, someone taller, obviously\nolder, as the stranger had his lips pressed to the boy\u2019s forehead. Yoongi didn\u2019t\nlike it.</p><p>He knew it was petty of him,\nbut he took a sick pleasure in shoving the photo back into the corner with the two\nsmiling faces against the wall. It was an old photo, he reasoned, the date in\nthe corner had been nearly three years previous, and Jungkook had probably\nforgotten about it.</p><p>Rearranging the front row of\nphotos to effectively hide the offending reminder quickly, Yoongi turned away\njust in time to see Jungkook hurrying back into the room, carefully balancing a\nmug of hot chocolate and what looked like black coffee.</p><p>The younger boy was sheepish\nas he handed Yoongi his drink, watching nervously as he took in the rising spiral\nof whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles adorning it. Yoongi raised an eyebrow as\nhe met the others gaze.</p><p>\u201cI might need a spoon for this,\u201d\nhe said but the delighted smile curling at his mouth betrayed the indifference\nof his tone and Jungkook relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think you\u2019d\nsuit a white moustache,\u201d the younger man teased, eyes alight with mirth but\nlingering on his mouth, a hint of something dark coming across his expression\nbefore smoothing out. Yoongi wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>\u201cI do look good in white,\u201d Yoongi\nlet his tongue dart out, a quick swipe across his lower lip and Jungkook\nswallowed. He definitely did not imagine that. Small victories.</p><p>Sipping from his mug, they\nboth sat down, Yoongi curled into the armchair and Jungkook settling across\nfrom him on the sofa. Somehow, the older man pondered, Jungkook managed to sit\nregally, like a King demanding attention, rather than the twenty-one-year-old\nstudent that he was. He distracted himself by licking at the cream atop his drink.\nJungkook coughed.</p><p>\u201cI did want to talk,\u201d he started,\nfiddling with his own cup. \u201cTae and Jimin know some of it, but they aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi wasn\u2019t sure what that\nhad to do with anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s\nimportant to me that you know the whole thing. Hyung I don\u2019t want to sound clich\u00e9\nby saying there\u2019s something different about you, but you make me feel at home. Talking\nto you feels like having a conversation with an extension of myself, and I <i>need</i> you to understand everything.\u201d\nJungkook was leaning forward now, an urgency appearing as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening, Kooks,\u201d Yoongi\nmurmured, reeling. This strong, beautiful boy felt at home with him \u2013 with <i>him</i> \u2013 and he wanted to cry again.</p><p>Jungkook closed his eyes for a\nmoment.</p><p>\u201cOk\u2026 ok. So. Lunch with\nYugyeom and Bambam today. It didn\u2019t go well.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi snorted. That was an\nunderstatement. Seeing a wild Taehyung appear and scream profanities at a\nstunned Bambam before punching him had been the highlight of his week. He\u2019d wanted\nto buy the kid dinner after that but had been too preoccupied with keeping\nJungkook from running away like he had. Terse words had been exchanged with\nYugyeom before he had left, dragging an angry Bambam behind him, but Jungkook\nhad stayed, had calmed down as Yoongi ran warm hands up and down his back. It\nhad been one of his proudest moments.</p><p>Jungkook gave a wry smile at\nYoongi\u2019s reaction. \u201cI told you Bambam fucked my ex, right?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, he did. I\u2019d been dating\nSehun since I was eighteen, he was older than me by a couple of years but he\nwas amazing. He refused to do anything with me until I was of legal age,\u201d Jungkook\nlaughed at the memory. \u201cBut he made me laugh, took me so many places, treated\nme like an <i>equal</i> and not just some\nkid who had a crush on him. He was my first love, my first everything\u2026\u201d</p><p>Something ugly twisted in\nYoongi\u2019s chest but he ignored it. The photo in the corner came back to his mind.</p><p>\u201cHe loved to dance, as well,\nand we made up so many routines together,\u201d the boy seemed lost in his memories for\na moment and completely missed Yoongi\u2019s bitter mutter of <i>I can dance, too</i>.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, kind of how it all\nstarted to go wrong,\u201d the smile on his face was now pained and Yoongi reached\nover to lace his fingers with Jungkooks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d he whispered, not too\nsure himself why he was speaking so quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Long, callused fingers hesitantly\nthreaded themselves between his own, gripping tightly, and suddenly Jungkook\u2019s\nsmile became a little more real.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know, though.\u201d He\nsaid and picked up the story again. \u201cI always attended this dance class with\nYugyeom and Bambam \u2013 I got to know them because of it \u2013 and it was always a\nsafe place for me, so one day I brought Sehun with me. I don\u2019t know, I thought\nit would be a fun thing to do together. And it was! In the beginning\u2026 But\nBambam was always a flirty little fucker and Sehun was just too oblivious to\nnotice what was going on.\u201d</p><p>The hand Yoongi held between\nhis own shook slightly, and he thought Jungkook was trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cI told him to stop, <i>Yugyeom</i> told him to stop, but he wouldn\u2019t.\nIt got worse \u2013 there was a group performance at the end of term, a big one, and\nwe all had a partner for it. I was with Sehun \u2013 of course I was \u2013 but Bambam\ntold the instructor we\u2019d get distracted if we were allowed to dance together. He\nsaid our <i>emotions</i> would make us act\nunprofessionally, and the instructor actually <i>agreed</i>,\u201d Jungkook choked on a rising sob and Yoongi pretended not\nto notice. \u201cThey split us up, put me with Yugyeom and Sehun with Bambam.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi could see where it was going\nand he didn\u2019t like it. The sudden urge to track Bambam down and do more than\npunch him in the face took hold and he gritted his teeth.</p><p>\u201cBut Sehun didn\u2019t do anything!\nHe wouldn\u2019t! He was with <i>me</i>, and\nSehun wasn\u2019t a cheater,\u201d Jungkook was still talking, spilling it into the air\nas if it would somehow release him from the lingering pain. \u201cAnd Bambam knew that!\nSo he started saying stuff, making it seem like I wanted more than friendship from\nYugyeom \u2013 that every time we laughed or got lunch together it meant something\nmore. And it didn\u2019t! It never did! But he was manipulative. He got under my boyfriend\u2019s\nskin and made him doubt me, doubt <i>us</i>.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was shaking so much the\ncoffee in his other hand was rippling inside the mug and Yoongi had to gently\nwrench it from his grip before it spilled. He placed the mug on the side table\nbeside his own and moved until he was kneeling between the boys legs, looking\nup at him. </p><p>Tears streaked down Jungkooks\nface, getting caught in his eyelashes and on the tip of his slightly-too-big\nnose, and Yoongi scrunched his fist inside the sleeve of his jumper before\nwiping them away. Glossy eyes streaked with red were wide as they stared down\nat him and Yoongi tried very hard not to blush under the weight of such\nundivided attention.</p><p>\u201cThat Bambam guy was a dick\nanyway,\u201d he murmured and Jungkook blinked. \u201cIf Tae hadn\u2019t already smacked him\nlike he did, I had half a mind to go and finish the job. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t\nneed a dick when he\u2019s already such a big one.\u201d</p><p>A startled laugh escaped the\nyounger boy and he gave Yoongi a tentative smile. Yoongi responded with a shy\ngrin and leaned back.</p><p>\u201cYeah so,\u201d Jungkook said\nquietly. \u201cSehun didn\u2019t say anything, because he was never the kind to talk\nabout his problems \u2013 never wanted to burden anyone else with his insecurities because\nhe thought it reflected badly on him \u2013 and the final performance came. It was\ngood, we all did good. And Bambam suggested we all go out afterwards to\ncelebrate. I didn\u2019t say no, and so we went. And Bambam got Sehun drunk. Like,\nreally drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jungkookie\u2026\u201d</p><p>The younger boy sounded so sad,\nso heartbroken, and in that instant, Yoongi hated everything. He hated Bambam\nand everything his smug face had done. He hated Sehun for hurting Jungkook like\nhe had. He hated Jungkook for letting himself be hurt. And he hated himself,\nfor not being honest with himself and his friends about who he was.</p><p>Jungkook shrugged. \u201cI found\nout months later. Sehun had started avoiding me, saying he was too busy to go\non dates, asked me for a break. I gave it to him \u2013 I thought it was just exam\nstress. It was Yugyeom, who told me, in the end. Couldn\u2019t take the guilt of knowing.\nSehun cried when I broke up with him. I know he didn\u2019t cheat on me\nintentionally \u2013 his soul is too good for that. But he was hurt, and confused,\nand fucking Bambam had gotten into his head, and he just didn\u2019t come and <i>talk</i> to me. He could\u2019ve just fucking <i>talked to me.</i>\u201d</p><p>Yoongi didn\u2019t know what to say,\nbut it was clear that Jungkook was done talking. The boy was still crying, silently\ncringing against his own mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Those were the\nonly words that the smaller man could utter. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry, Jungkook. <i>Fuck</i> I\u2019m sorry that bastard felt he\ncould do that to you, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re still in pain, I\u2019m sorry that Tae\ndidn\u2019t do more than punch that asshole in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, hyung,\u201d Jungkook\nsniffled out. \u201cIt was two years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime doesn\u2019t heal everything,\u201d\nYoongi said gently. \u201cAnd you still love him.\u201d</p><p>At that, Jungkook shook his\nhead. \u201cNo. No I miss him, but I don\u2019t love him anymore. I know that. I\u2019ve moved\non.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never changed his number. We\u2019ve\nbeen texting for a couple of weeks and I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t want him back, hyung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yoongi drew a blank. \u201cThat\u2019s\ngood, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 actually been asking\nfor his advice&hellip;\u201d Jungkook said, cautiously, watching to see how Yoongi would\nreact. \u201cThere\u2019s someone I like, someone I\u2019ve liked for a while and I want to\nask him out.\u201d</p><p>Inside his chest, Yoongi\u2019s\nheart crippled under the sudden pain. Of course Jungkook had someone! Of course\na guy as wonderful as him would not be single for very long! It was ridiculous\nto have even entertained the possibility that he had a chance.</p><p>\u201cI hope it all works out for\nyou, Kooks.\u201d He tried to smile, though it probably came across more as a grimace.\n\u201cAny man would be lucky to call you theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Jungkook was\neager, the sadness from before washed away to be replaced by something akin to\nhope. Yoongi didn\u2019t know what he was hoping for.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied, crawling\nbackwards. Maybe if he got some distance between himself and Jungkook, the pain\nwould decrease, but Jungkook followed him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he\u2019d think himself\nlucky?\u201d The younger boy seriously resembled a bunny with his hands on his knees\nand face sticking upwards. He looked a little ridiculous and Yoongi wished he\nwasn\u2019t so endeared.</p><p>\u201cObviously? He\u2019d jump into\nyour arms as soon as you even hint that you like him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jungkook was\nsuddenly sceptical and Yoongi was going to get whiplash from the sudden change\nof emotion.</p><p>Yoongi nodded and Jungkook frowned.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re wrong. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d The smaller man didn\u2019t\nknow where to go from there. Was Jungkook saying he\u2019d been rejected already?\nWhat sort of man would reject <i>Jungkook</i>?</p><p>Meanwhile, the aforementioned\nboy was getting dejectedly to his feet and picking up the only half-drunk mugs,\nintent on taking them back to the kitchen. Yoongi didn\u2019t know what had happened\nbut he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cJungkook? Are you ok?\u201d</p><p> \u201cAre you really that oblivious, hyung?\u201d\nJungkook sighed, throwing the accusation over his shoulder as he continued towards\nthe kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. Jungkook, <i>talk</i> to me!\u201d Yoongi begged, following\nhim.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt obviously does otherwise\nyou wouldn\u2019t be getting so upset!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave it, hyung! You don\u2019t\nfeel the same, it\u2019s ok!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Jesus fucking Christ, </i>Jungkook. <i>Feel\nwhat?</i>\u201d</p><p>The younger boy dumped the\nmugs in the sink with a clatter of porcelain that made Yoongi wince and twisted\ntowards him with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s <i>you,</i> hyung. You\u2019re the boy I like. And <i>obviously</i> you don\u2019t like me back and that\u2019s ok! So just go, I\u2019ll be\nfine.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi stepped back as if he\u2019d\nbeen slapped. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His voice was small,\njust like the hope slowly blooming in his chest.</p><p>The fight seemed to drain from\nJungkook, and his shoulders dropped. \u201cI like you, hyung.

Hidden beneath the thick paste of foundation (<i>thank you Lisa</i>), logically he knew they\ncouldn\u2019t be seen, but he still tugged at the collar of his jumper, nervous.\nJungkook had asked him to come over, had wanted his <i>company</i>, so why did he feel like a trespasser?</p><p>His pale hands trembled in the\ncold and, clenched in one fist, the bag of cheap take-out swung in the wind. He\nhoped it hadn\u2019t gotten too cold during the drive over.</p><p>He took a deep breath and\nknocked.</p><p>***</p><p>Yoongi has always been content\nwith silence. It\u2019s comfortable, the idea of being within ones own space, not\nneeding to focus or condense his thoughts into an organised train of dialogue. He\n<i>likes</i> silence. He does not, however, enjoy\nsitting across from Jungkook in the living room, while said boy says nothing\nand frowns at the wall.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to break\nthrough whatever thought processes the younger man was struggling through, but\nhe couldn\u2019t stand the awkwardness in the air.</p><p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t respond so he edged\nforward to the edge of his seat and said it again. \u201cJungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Was the reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to come over and\nI\u2019ve brought some food\u2026 Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d And Yoongi trailed into\nsilence, biting his lip.</p><p>Jungkook looked good, even in\nsweatpants and a ratty grey hoodie he was messing with Yoongi\u2019s heart. Tired\neyes and dark hair ruffled as if he\u2019d been running his hands through it, Jeon\njungkook was the epitome of what Yoongi would begrudgingly admit being his \u2018ideal\ntype\u2019. The younger man yawned and he was struck with the desire to curl up\nbetween his legs and sleep against his chest \u2013 it looked warm and firm enough\nto be the most comfortable pillow. Yoongi sort of wanted to cry.</p><p>\u201cWant something to drink,\nhyung?\u201d Jungkook suddenly asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Please,\u201d Yoongi\nsaid.</p><p>\u201cCoffee? Tea?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi looked down. \u201cDo you\npossibly have any hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fan of bitter things,\nhmm?\u201d Jungkook smirked and Yoongi blushed, the double entendre not lost on him.</p><p>\u201cSome bitter things can be\nnice,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut I really like sweet things more.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook hummed, muttered something\nunder his breath that could\u2019ve been <i>you\u2019re\nso cute</i>, and headed to the kitchen.</p><p>Yoongi stayed on the sofa,\nslightly star struck. He wanted to believe he\u2019d heard correctly, that his mind\nhadn\u2019t been playing tricks on him, but it was too much to hope for. It was too much\nto dare imagine that the boy he was half in love with \u2013 it didn\u2019t matter that\nhe hadn\u2019t known him for very long \u2013 could maybe, possibly, hopefully like him\nback? Maybe?</p><p>\u201cMilk? In your hot chocolate?\u201d\nJungkook called from the kitchen and Yoongi gave an affirmative as he stood up\nto peer around the room.</p><p>A book shelf lay opposite, two\nrows of books with a row of photo frames sandwiched between them, and all of\nthem slightly dusty. Yoongi chuckled as he looked at each one \u2013 Jungkook and\nJimin grinning at the camera with their arms around each other, Taehyung laughing\nas Jungkook struggled to hold onto an angry tomcat, Jimin and Taehyung hugging\nJungkook from either side \u2013 in every photo, they looked happy, so happy with\neach other and it tugged at Yoongi\u2019s heartstrings. Jungkook\u2019s smile, thinner\ntop lip and full bottom lip, two small indentations where his front teeth had\nbitten down, a bunny smile. </p><p>He nudged them aside to see\nthe photos hidden behind the first row and smiled again \u2013 Jungkook and a boy so\nalike him in looks that it must\u2019ve been his brother, three photos of the sun\nrising over Busan, an older couple waving at the camera with their hands\nlinked. The photographer was incredibly talented.</p><p>Pushed into the corner, however,\nwas another picture. Blurry and clearly taken mid-movement, Yoongi hesitated in\ntouching it, in recognising that someone he didn\u2019t know was touching Jungkook\nlike that, smiling at him like that, kissing him <i>like that</i>. In the photo, Jungkook was smiling at the camera, both\nhis hands thrown around the neck of another man, someone taller, obviously\nolder, as the stranger had his lips pressed to the boy\u2019s forehead. Yoongi didn\u2019t\nlike it.</p><p>He knew it was petty of him,\nbut he took a sick pleasure in shoving the photo back into the corner with the two\nsmiling faces against the wall. It was an old photo, he reasoned, the date in\nthe corner had been nearly three years previous, and Jungkook had probably\nforgotten about it.</p><p>Rearranging the front row of\nphotos to effectively hide the offending reminder quickly, Yoongi turned away\njust in time to see Jungkook hurrying back into the room, carefully balancing a\nmug of hot chocolate and what looked like black coffee.</p><p>The younger boy was sheepish\nas he handed Yoongi his drink, watching nervously as he took in the rising spiral\nof whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles adorning it. Yoongi raised an eyebrow as\nhe met the others gaze.</p><p>\u201cI might need a spoon for this,\u201d\nhe said but the delighted smile curling at his mouth betrayed the indifference\nof his tone and Jungkook relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think you\u2019d\nsuit a white moustache,\u201d the younger man teased, eyes alight with mirth but\nlingering on his mouth, a hint of something dark coming across his expression\nbefore smoothing out. Yoongi wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>\u201cI do look good in white,\u201d Yoongi\nlet his tongue dart out, a quick swipe across his lower lip and Jungkook\nswallowed. He definitely did not imagine that. Small victories.</p><p>Sipping from his mug, they\nboth sat down, Yoongi curled into the armchair and Jungkook settling across\nfrom him on the sofa. Somehow, the older man pondered, Jungkook managed to sit\nregally, like a King demanding attention, rather than the twenty-one-year-old\nstudent that he was. He distracted himself by licking at the cream atop his drink.\nJungkook coughed.</p><p>\u201cI did want to talk,\u201d he started,\nfiddling with his own cup. \u201cTae and Jimin know some of it, but they aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi wasn\u2019t sure what that\nhad to do with anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s\nimportant to me that you know the whole thing. Hyung I don\u2019t want to sound clich\u00e9\nby saying there\u2019s something different about you, but you make me feel at home. Talking\nto you feels like having a conversation with an extension of myself, and I <i>need</i> you to understand everything.\u201d\nJungkook was leaning forward now, an urgency appearing as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening, Kooks,\u201d Yoongi\nmurmured, reeling. This strong, beautiful boy felt at home with him \u2013 with <i>him</i> \u2013 and he wanted to cry again.</p><p>Jungkook closed his eyes for a\nmoment.</p><p>\u201cOk\u2026 ok. So. Lunch with\nYugyeom and Bambam today. It didn\u2019t go well.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi snorted. That was an\nunderstatement. Seeing a wild Taehyung appear and scream profanities at a\nstunned Bambam before punching him had been the highlight of his week. He\u2019d wanted\nto buy the kid dinner after that but had been too preoccupied with keeping\nJungkook from running away like he had. Terse words had been exchanged with\nYugyeom before he had left, dragging an angry Bambam behind him, but Jungkook\nhad stayed, had calmed down as Yoongi ran warm hands up and down his back. It\nhad been one of his proudest moments.</p><p>Jungkook gave a wry smile at\nYoongi\u2019s reaction. \u201cI told you Bambam fucked my ex, right?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, he did. I\u2019d been dating\nSehun since I was eighteen, he was older than me by a couple of years but he\nwas amazing. He refused to do anything with me until I was of legal age,\u201d Jungkook\nlaughed at the memory. \u201cBut he made me laugh, took me so many places, treated\nme like an <i>equal</i> and not just some\nkid who had a crush on him. He was my first love, my first everything\u2026\u201d</p><p>Something ugly twisted in\nYoongi\u2019s chest but he ignored it. The photo in the corner came back to his mind.</p><p>\u201cHe loved to dance, as well,\nand we made up so many routines together,\u201d the boy seemed lost in his memories for\na moment and completely missed Yoongi\u2019s bitter mutter of <i>I can dance, too</i>.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, kind of how it all\nstarted to go wrong,\u201d the smile on his face was now pained and Yoongi reached\nover to lace his fingers with Jungkooks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d he whispered, not too\nsure himself why he was speaking so quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Long, callused fingers hesitantly\nthreaded themselves between his own, gripping tightly, and suddenly Jungkook\u2019s\nsmile became a little more real.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know, though.\u201d He\nsaid and picked up the story again. \u201cI always attended this dance class with\nYugyeom and Bambam \u2013 I got to know them because of it \u2013 and it was always a\nsafe place for me, so one day I brought Sehun with me. I don\u2019t know, I thought\nit would be a fun thing to do together. And it was! In the beginning\u2026 But\nBambam was always a flirty little fucker and Sehun was just too oblivious to\nnotice what was going on.\u201d</p><p>The hand Yoongi held between\nhis own shook slightly, and he thought Jungkook was trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cI told him to stop, <i>Yugyeom</i> told him to stop, but he wouldn\u2019t.\nIt got worse \u2013 there was a group performance at the end of term, a big one, and\nwe all had a partner for it. I was with Sehun \u2013 of course I was \u2013 but Bambam\ntold the instructor we\u2019d get distracted if we were allowed to dance together. He\nsaid our <i>emotions</i> would make us act\nunprofessionally, and the instructor actually <i>agreed</i>,\u201d Jungkook choked on a rising sob and Yoongi pretended not\nto notice. \u201cThey split us up, put me with Yugyeom and Sehun with Bambam.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi could see where it was going\nand he didn\u2019t like it. The sudden urge to track Bambam down and do more than\npunch him in the face took hold and he gritted his teeth.</p><p>\u201cBut Sehun didn\u2019t do anything!\nHe wouldn\u2019t! He was with <i>me</i>, and\nSehun wasn\u2019t a cheater,\u201d Jungkook was still talking, spilling it into the air\nas if it would somehow release him from the lingering pain. \u201cAnd Bambam knew that!\nSo he started saying stuff, making it seem like I wanted more than friendship from\nYugyeom \u2013 that every time we laughed or got lunch together it meant something\nmore. And it didn\u2019t! It never did! But he was manipulative. He got under my boyfriend\u2019s\nskin and made him doubt me, doubt <i>us</i>.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was shaking so much the\ncoffee in his other hand was rippling inside the mug and Yoongi had to gently\nwrench it from his grip before it spilled. He placed the mug on the side table\nbeside his own and moved until he was kneeling between the boys legs, looking\nup at him. </p><p>Tears streaked down Jungkooks\nface, getting caught in his eyelashes and on the tip of his slightly-too-big\nnose, and Yoongi scrunched his fist inside the sleeve of his jumper before\nwiping them away. Glossy eyes streaked with red were wide as they stared down\nat him and Yoongi tried very hard not to blush under the weight of such\nundivided attention.</p><p>\u201cThat Bambam guy was a dick\nanyway,\u201d he murmured and Jungkook blinked. \u201cIf Tae hadn\u2019t already smacked him\nlike he did, I had half a mind to go and finish the job. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t\nneed a dick when he\u2019s already such a big one.\u201d</p><p>A startled laugh escaped the\nyounger boy and he gave Yoongi a tentative smile. Yoongi responded with a shy\ngrin and leaned back.</p><p>\u201cYeah so,\u201d Jungkook said\nquietly. \u201cSehun didn\u2019t say anything, because he was never the kind to talk\nabout his problems \u2013 never wanted to burden anyone else with his insecurities because\nhe thought it reflected badly on him \u2013 and the final performance came. It was\ngood, we all did good. And Bambam suggested we all go out afterwards to\ncelebrate. I didn\u2019t say no, and so we went. And Bambam got Sehun drunk. Like,\nreally drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jungkookie\u2026\u201d</p><p>The younger boy sounded so sad,\nso heartbroken, and in that instant, Yoongi hated everything. He hated Bambam\nand everything his smug face had done. He hated Sehun for hurting Jungkook like\nhe had. He hated Jungkook for letting himself be hurt. And he hated himself,\nfor not being honest with himself and his friends about who he was.</p><p>Jungkook shrugged. \u201cI found\nout months later. Sehun had started avoiding me, saying he was too busy to go\non dates, asked me for a break. I gave it to him \u2013 I thought it was just exam\nstress. It was Yugyeom, who told me, in the end. Couldn\u2019t take the guilt of knowing.\nSehun cried when I broke up with him. I know he didn\u2019t cheat on me\nintentionally \u2013 his soul is too good for that. But he was hurt, and confused,\nand fucking Bambam had gotten into his head, and he just didn\u2019t come and <i>talk</i> to me. He could\u2019ve just fucking <i>talked to me.</i>\u201d</p><p>Yoongi didn\u2019t know what to say,\nbut it was clear that Jungkook was done talking. The boy was still crying, silently\ncringing against his own mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Those were the\nonly words that the smaller man could utter. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry, Jungkook. <i>Fuck</i> I\u2019m sorry that bastard felt he\ncould do that to you, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re still in pain, I\u2019m sorry that Tae\ndidn\u2019t do more than punch that asshole in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, hyung,\u201d Jungkook\nsniffled out. \u201cIt was two years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime doesn\u2019t heal everything,\u201d\nYoongi said gently. \u201cAnd you still love him.\u201d</p><p>At that, Jungkook shook his\nhead. \u201cNo. No I miss him, but I don\u2019t love him anymore. I know that. I\u2019ve moved\non.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never changed his number. We\u2019ve\nbeen texting for a couple of weeks and I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t want him back, hyung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yoongi drew a blank. \u201cThat\u2019s\ngood, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 actually been asking\nfor his advice\u2026\u201d Jungkook said, cautiously, watching to see how Yoongi would\nreact. \u201cThere\u2019s someone I like, someone I\u2019ve liked for a while and I want to\nask him out.\u201d</p><p>Inside his chest, Yoongi\u2019s\nheart crippled under the sudden pain. Of course Jungkook had someone! Of course\na guy as wonderful as him would not be single for very long! It was ridiculous\nto have even entertained the possibility that he had a chance.</p><p>\u201cI hope it all works out for\nyou, Kooks.\u201d He tried to smile, though it probably came across more as a grimace.\n\u201cAny man would be lucky to call you theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Jungkook was\neager, the sadness from before washed away to be replaced by something akin to\nhope. Yoongi didn\u2019t know what he was hoping for.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied, crawling\nbackwards. Maybe if he got some distance between himself and Jungkook, the pain\nwould decrease, but Jungkook followed him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he\u2019d think himself\nlucky?\u201d The younger boy seriously resembled a bunny with his hands on his knees\nand face sticking upwards. He looked a little ridiculous and Yoongi wished he\nwasn\u2019t so endeared.</p><p>\u201cObviously? He\u2019d jump into\nyour arms as soon as you even hint that you like him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jungkook was\nsuddenly sceptical and Yoongi was going to get whiplash from the sudden change\nof emotion.</p><p>Yoongi nodded and Jungkook frowned.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re wrong. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d The smaller man didn\u2019t\nknow where to go from there. Was Jungkook saying he\u2019d been rejected already?\nWhat sort of man would reject <i>Jungkook</i>?</p><p>Meanwhile, the aforementioned\nboy was getting dejectedly to his feet and picking up the only half-drunk mugs,\nintent on taking them back to the kitchen. Yoongi didn\u2019t know what had happened\nbut he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cJungkook? Are you ok?\u201d</p><p> \u201cAre you really that oblivious, hyung?\u201d\nJungkook sighed, throwing the accusation over his shoulder as he continued towards\nthe kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. Jungkook, <i>talk</i> to me!\u201d Yoongi begged, following\nhim.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt obviously does otherwise\nyou wouldn\u2019t be getting so upset!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave it, hyung! You don\u2019t\nfeel the same, it\u2019s ok!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Jesus fucking Christ, </i>Jungkook. <i>Feel\nwhat?</i>\u201d</p><p>The younger boy dumped the\nmugs in the sink with a clatter of porcelain that made Yoongi wince and twisted\ntowards him with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s <i>you,</i> hyung. You\u2019re the boy I like. And <i>obviously</i> you don\u2019t like me back and that\u2019s ok! So just go, I\u2019ll be\nfine.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi stepped back as if he\u2019d\nbeen slapped. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His voice was small,\njust like the hope slowly blooming in his chest.</p><p>The fight seemed to drain from\nJungkook, and his shoulders dropped. \u201cI like you, hyung. Like gross, high\nschool like-like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJungkook, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel the same, it\u2019s\nok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJungkook, listen-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHyung no,\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Jeon Jungkook</i>.\u201d</p><p>The younger boy stopped\ntalking, his mouth shutting with a clack of teeth and an audible gulp. Yoongi\nwas smiling, an unidentifiable feeling welling inside him until it threatened\nto explode.</p><p>\u201c<i>I like you too.</i>\u201d</p>",

Hidden beneath the thick paste of foundation (<i>thank you Lisa</i>), logically he knew they\ncouldn\u2019t be seen, but he still tugged at the collar of his jumper, nervous.\nJungkook had asked him to come over, had wanted his <i>company</i>, so why did he feel like a trespasser?</p><p>His pale hands trembled in the\ncold and, clenched in one fist, the bag of cheap take-out swung in the wind. He\nhoped it hadn\u2019t gotten too cold during the drive over.</p><p>He took a deep breath and\nknocked.</p><p>***</p><p>Yoongi has always been content\nwith silence. It\u2019s comfortable, the idea of being within ones own space, not\nneeding to focus or condense his thoughts into an organised train of dialogue. He\n<i>likes</i> silence. He does not, however, enjoy\nsitting across from Jungkook in the living room, while said boy says nothing\nand frowns at the wall.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to break\nthrough whatever thought processes the younger man was struggling through, but\nhe couldn\u2019t stand the awkwardness in the air.</p><p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t respond so he edged\nforward to the edge of his seat and said it again. \u201cJungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Was the reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to come over and\nI\u2019ve brought some food\u2026 Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d And Yoongi trailed into\nsilence, biting his lip.</p><p>Jungkook looked good, even in\nsweatpants and a ratty grey hoodie he was messing with Yoongi\u2019s heart. Tired\neyes and dark hair ruffled as if he\u2019d been running his hands through it, Jeon\njungkook was the epitome of what Yoongi would begrudgingly admit being his \u2018ideal\ntype\u2019. The younger man yawned and he was struck with the desire to curl up\nbetween his legs and sleep against his chest \u2013 it looked warm and firm enough\nto be the most comfortable pillow. Yoongi sort of wanted to cry.</p><p>\u201cWant something to drink,\nhyung?\u201d Jungkook suddenly asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Please,\u201d Yoongi\nsaid.</p><p>\u201cCoffee? Tea?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi looked down. \u201cDo you\npossibly have any hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fan of bitter things,\nhmm?\u201d Jungkook smirked and Yoongi blushed, the double entendre not lost on him.</p><p>\u201cSome bitter things can be\nnice,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut I really like sweet things more.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook hummed, muttered something\nunder his breath that could\u2019ve been <i>you\u2019re\nso cute</i>, and headed to the kitchen.</p><p>Yoongi stayed on the sofa,\nslightly star struck. He wanted to believe he\u2019d heard correctly, that his mind\nhadn\u2019t been playing tricks on him, but it was too much to hope for. It was too much\nto dare imagine that the boy he was half in love with \u2013 it didn\u2019t matter that\nhe hadn\u2019t known him for very long \u2013 could maybe, possibly, hopefully like him\nback? Maybe?</p><p>\u201cMilk? In your hot chocolate?\u201d\nJungkook called from the kitchen and Yoongi gave an affirmative as he stood up\nto peer around the room.</p><p>A book shelf lay opposite, two\nrows of books with a row of photo frames sandwiched between them, and all of\nthem slightly dusty. Yoongi chuckled as he looked at each one \u2013 Jungkook and\nJimin grinning at the camera with their arms around each other, Taehyung laughing\nas Jungkook struggled to hold onto an angry tomcat, Jimin and Taehyung hugging\nJungkook from either side \u2013 in every photo, they looked happy, so happy with\neach other and it tugged at Yoongi\u2019s heartstrings. Jungkook\u2019s smile, thinner\ntop lip and full bottom lip, two small indentations where his front teeth had\nbitten down, a bunny smile. </p><p>He nudged them aside to see\nthe photos hidden behind the first row and smiled again \u2013 Jungkook and a boy so\nalike him in looks that it must\u2019ve been his brother, three photos of the sun\nrising over Busan, an older couple waving at the camera with their hands\nlinked. The photographer was incredibly talented.</p><p>Pushed into the corner, however,\nwas another picture. Blurry and clearly taken mid-movement, Yoongi hesitated in\ntouching it, in recognising that someone he didn\u2019t know was touching Jungkook\nlike that, smiling at him like that, kissing him <i>like that</i>. In the photo, Jungkook was smiling at the camera, both\nhis hands thrown around the neck of another man, someone taller, obviously\nolder, as the stranger had his lips pressed to the boy\u2019s forehead. Yoongi didn\u2019t\nlike it.</p><p>He knew it was petty of him,\nbut he took a sick pleasure in shoving the photo back into the corner with the two\nsmiling faces against the wall. It was an old photo, he reasoned, the date in\nthe corner had been nearly three years previous, and Jungkook had probably\nforgotten about it.</p><p>Rearranging the front row of\nphotos to effectively hide the offending reminder quickly, Yoongi turned away\njust in time to see Jungkook hurrying back into the room, carefully balancing a\nmug of hot chocolate and what looked like black coffee.</p><p>The younger boy was sheepish\nas he handed Yoongi his drink, watching nervously as he took in the rising spiral\nof whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles adorning it. Yoongi raised an eyebrow as\nhe met the others gaze.</p><p>\u201cI might need a spoon for this,\u201d\nhe said but the delighted smile curling at his mouth betrayed the indifference\nof his tone and Jungkook relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think you\u2019d\nsuit a white moustache,\u201d the younger man teased, eyes alight with mirth but\nlingering on his mouth, a hint of something dark coming across his expression\nbefore smoothing out. Yoongi wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>\u201cI do look good in white,\u201d Yoongi\nlet his tongue dart out, a quick swipe across his lower lip and Jungkook\nswallowed. He definitely did not imagine that. Small victories.</p><p>Sipping from his mug, they\nboth sat down, Yoongi curled into the armchair and Jungkook settling across\nfrom him on the sofa. Somehow, the older man pondered, Jungkook managed to sit\nregally, like a King demanding attention, rather than the twenty-one-year-old\nstudent that he was. He distracted himself by licking at the cream atop his drink.\nJungkook coughed.</p><p>\u201cI did want to talk,\u201d he started,\nfiddling with his own cup. \u201cTae and Jimin know some of it, but they aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi wasn\u2019t sure what that\nhad to do with anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s\nimportant to me that you know the whole thing. Hyung I don\u2019t want to sound clich\u00e9\nby saying there\u2019s something different about you, but you make me feel at home. Talking\nto you feels like having a conversation with an extension of myself, and I <i>need</i> you to understand everything.\u201d\nJungkook was leaning forward now, an urgency appearing as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening, Kooks,\u201d Yoongi\nmurmured, reeling. This strong, beautiful boy felt at home with him \u2013 with <i>him</i> \u2013 and he wanted to cry again.</p><p>Jungkook closed his eyes for a\nmoment.</p><p>\u201cOk\u2026 ok. So. Lunch with\nYugyeom and Bambam today. It didn\u2019t go well.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi snorted. That was an\nunderstatement. Seeing a wild Taehyung appear and scream profanities at a\nstunned Bambam before punching him had been the highlight of his week. He\u2019d wanted\nto buy the kid dinner after that but had been too preoccupied with keeping\nJungkook from running away like he had. Terse words had been exchanged with\nYugyeom before he had left, dragging an angry Bambam behind him, but Jungkook\nhad stayed, had calmed down as Yoongi ran warm hands up and down his back. It\nhad been one of his proudest moments.</p><p>Jungkook gave a wry smile at\nYoongi\u2019s reaction. \u201cI told you Bambam fucked my ex, right?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, he did. I\u2019d been dating\nSehun since I was eighteen, he was older than me by a couple of years but he\nwas amazing. He refused to do anything with me until I was of legal age,\u201d Jungkook\nlaughed at the memory. \u201cBut he made me laugh, took me so many places, treated\nme like an <i>equal</i> and not just some\nkid who had a crush on him. He was my first love, my first everything\u2026\u201d</p><p>Something ugly twisted in\nYoongi\u2019s chest but he ignored it. The photo in the corner came back to his mind.</p><p>\u201cHe loved to dance, as well,\nand we made up so many routines together,\u201d the boy seemed lost in his memories for\na moment and completely missed Yoongi\u2019s bitter mutter of <i>I can dance, too</i>.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, kind of how it all\nstarted to go wrong,\u201d the smile on his face was now pained and Yoongi reached\nover to lace his fingers with Jungkooks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d he whispered, not too\nsure himself why he was speaking so quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Long, callused fingers hesitantly\nthreaded themselves between his own, gripping tightly, and suddenly Jungkook\u2019s\nsmile became a little more real.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know, though.\u201d He\nsaid and picked up the story again. \u201cI always attended this dance class with\nYugyeom and Bambam \u2013 I got to know them because of it \u2013 and it was always a\nsafe place for me, so one day I brought Sehun with me. I don\u2019t know, I thought\nit would be a fun thing to do together. And it was! In the beginning\u2026 But\nBambam was always a flirty little fucker and Sehun was just too oblivious to\nnotice what was going on.\u201d</p><p>The hand Yoongi held between\nhis own shook slightly, and he thought Jungkook was trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cI told him to stop, <i>Yugyeom</i> told him to stop, but he wouldn\u2019t.\nIt got worse \u2013 there was a group performance at the end of term, a big one, and\nwe all had a partner for it. I was with Sehun \u2013 of course I was \u2013 but Bambam\ntold the instructor we\u2019d get distracted if we were allowed to dance together. He\nsaid our <i>emotions</i> would make us act\nunprofessionally, and the instructor actually <i>agreed</i>,\u201d Jungkook choked on a rising sob and Yoongi pretended not\nto notice. \u201cThey split us up, put me with Yugyeom and Sehun with Bambam.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi could see where it was going\nand he didn\u2019t like it. The sudden urge to track Bambam down and do more than\npunch him in the face took hold and he gritted his teeth.</p><p>\u201cBut Sehun didn\u2019t do anything!\nHe wouldn\u2019t! He was with <i>me</i>, and\nSehun wasn\u2019t a cheater,\u201d Jungkook was still talking, spilling it into the air\nas if it would somehow release him from the lingering pain. \u201cAnd Bambam knew that!\nSo he started saying stuff, making it seem like I wanted more than friendship from\nYugyeom \u2013 that every time we laughed or got lunch together it meant something\nmore. And it didn\u2019t! It never did! But he was manipulative. He got under my boyfriend\u2019s\nskin and made him doubt me, doubt <i>us</i>.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was shaking so much the\ncoffee in his other hand was rippling inside the mug and Yoongi had to gently\nwrench it from his grip before it spilled. He placed the mug on the side table\nbeside his own and moved until he was kneeling between the boys legs, looking\nup at him. </p><p>Tears streaked down Jungkooks\nface, getting caught in his eyelashes and on the tip of his slightly-too-big\nnose, and Yoongi scrunched his fist inside the sleeve of his jumper before\nwiping them away. Glossy eyes streaked with red were wide as they stared down\nat him and Yoongi tried very hard not to blush under the weight of such\nundivided attention.</p><p>\u201cThat Bambam guy was a dick\nanyway,\u201d he murmured and Jungkook blinked. \u201cIf Tae hadn\u2019t already smacked him\nlike he did, I had half a mind to go and finish the job. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t\nneed a dick when he\u2019s already such a big one.\u201d</p><p>A startled laugh escaped the\nyounger boy and he gave Yoongi a tentative smile. Yoongi responded with a shy\ngrin and leaned back.</p><p>\u201cYeah so,\u201d Jungkook said\nquietly. \u201cSehun didn\u2019t say anything, because he was never the kind to talk\nabout his problems \u2013 never wanted to burden anyone else with his insecurities because\nhe thought it reflected badly on him \u2013 and the final performance came. It was\ngood, we all did good. And Bambam suggested we all go out afterwards to\ncelebrate. I didn\u2019t say no, and so we went. And Bambam got Sehun drunk. Like,\nreally drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jungkookie\u2026\u201d</p><p>The younger boy sounded so sad,\nso heartbroken, and in that instant, Yoongi hated everything. He hated Bambam\nand everything his smug face had done. He hated Sehun for hurting Jungkook like\nhe had. He hated Jungkook for letting himself be hurt. And he hated himself,\nfor not being honest with himself and his friends about who he was.</p><p>Jungkook shrugged. \u201cI found\nout months later. Sehun had started avoiding me, saying he was too busy to go\non dates, asked me for a break. I gave it to him \u2013 I thought it was just exam\nstress. It was Yugyeom, who told me, in the end. Couldn\u2019t take the guilt of knowing.\nSehun cried when I broke up with him. I know he didn\u2019t cheat on me\nintentionally \u2013 his soul is too good for that. But he was hurt, and confused,\nand fucking Bambam had gotten into his head, and he just didn\u2019t come and <i>talk</i> to me. He could\u2019ve just fucking <i>talked to me.</i>\u201d</p><p>Yoongi didn\u2019t know what to say,\nbut it was clear that Jungkook was done talking. The boy was still crying, silently\ncringing against his own mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Those were the\nonly words that the smaller man could utter. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry, Jungkook. <i>Fuck</i> I\u2019m sorry that bastard felt he\ncould do that to you, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re still in pain, I\u2019m sorry that Tae\ndidn\u2019t do more than punch that asshole in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, hyung,\u201d Jungkook\nsniffled out. \u201cIt was two years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime doesn\u2019t heal everything,\u201d\nYoongi said gently. \u201cAnd you still love him.\u201d</p><p>At that, Jungkook shook his\nhead. \u201cNo. No I miss him, but I don\u2019t love him anymore. I know that. I\u2019ve moved\non.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never changed his number. We\u2019ve\nbeen texting for a couple of weeks and I\u2019m fine.

Of course Jungkook had someone! Of course\na guy as wonderful as him would not be single for very long! It was ridiculous\nto have even entertained the possibility that he had a chance.</p><p>\u201cI hope it all works out for\nyou, Kooks.\u201d He tried to smile, though it probably came across more as a grimace.\n\u201cAny man would be lucky to call you theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Jungkook was\neager, the sadness from before washed away to be replaced by something akin to\nhope. Yoongi didn\u2019t know what he was hoping for.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied, crawling\nbackwards. Maybe if he got some distance between himself and Jungkook, the pain\nwould decrease, but Jungkook followed him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he\u2019d think himself\nlucky?\u201d The younger boy seriously resembled a bunny with his hands on his knees\nand face sticking upwards. He looked a little ridiculous and Yoongi wished he\nwasn\u2019t so endeared.</p><p>\u201cObviously? He\u2019d jump into\nyour arms as soon as you even hint that you like him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jungkook was\nsuddenly sceptical and Yoongi was going to get whiplash from the sudden change\nof emotion.</p><p>Yoongi nodded and Jungkook frowned.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re wrong. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d The smaller man didn\u2019t\nknow where to go from there.

Are you ok?\u201d</p><p> \u201cAre you really that oblivious, hyung?\u201d\nJungkook sighed, throwing the accusation over his shoulder as he continued towards\nthe kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. Jungkook, <i>talk</i> to me!\u201d Yoongi begged, following\nhim.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt obviously does otherwise\nyou wouldn\u2019t be getting so upset!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave it, hyung!

Hidden beneath the thick paste of foundation (<i>thank you Lisa</i>), logically he knew they\ncouldn&rsquo;t be seen, but he still tugged at the collar of his jumper, nervous.\nJungkook had asked him to come over, had wanted his <i>company</i>, so why did he feel like a trespasser?</p><p>His pale hands trembled in the\ncold and, clenched in one fist, the bag of cheap take-out swung in the wind. He\nhoped it hadn&rsquo;t gotten too cold during the drive over.</p><p>He took a deep breath and\nknocked.</p><p>***</p><p>Yoongi has always been content\nwith silence. It&rsquo;s comfortable, the idea of being within ones own space, not\nneeding to focus or condense his thoughts into an organised train of dialogue. He\n<i>likes</i> silence. He does not, however, enjoy\nsitting across from Jungkook in the living room, while said boy says nothing\nand frowns at the wall.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to break\nthrough whatever thought processes the younger man was struggling through, but\nhe couldn&rsquo;t stand the awkwardness in the air.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook?&rdquo;</p><p>The boy didn&rsquo;t respond so he edged\nforward to the edge of his seat and said it again. &ldquo;Jungkook?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; Was the reaction.</p><p>&ldquo;You asked me to come over and\nI&rsquo;ve brought some food&hellip; Are you hungry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not. Not really.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; And Yoongi trailed into\nsilence, biting his lip.</p><p>Jungkook looked good, even in\nsweatpants and a ratty grey hoodie he was messing with Yoongi&rsquo;s heart. Tired\neyes and dark hair ruffled as if he&rsquo;d been running his hands through it, Jeon\njungkook was the epitome of what Yoongi would begrudgingly admit being his &lsquo;ideal\ntype&rsquo;. The younger man yawned and he was struck with the desire to curl up\nbetween his legs and sleep against his chest &ndash; it looked warm and firm enough\nto be the most comfortable pillow. Yoongi sort of wanted to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Want something to drink,\nhyung?&rdquo; Jungkook suddenly asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Please,&rdquo; Yoongi\nsaid.</p><p>&ldquo;Coffee? Tea?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi looked down. &ldquo;Do you\npossibly have any hot chocolate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a fan of bitter things,\nhmm?&rdquo; Jungkook smirked and Yoongi blushed, the double entendre not lost on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Some bitter things can be\nnice,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;But I really like sweet things more.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook hummed, muttered something\nunder his breath that could&rsquo;ve been <i>you&rsquo;re\nso cute</i>, and headed to the kitchen.</p><p>Yoongi stayed on the sofa,\nslightly star struck. He wanted to believe he&rsquo;d heard correctly, that his mind\nhadn&rsquo;t been playing tricks on him, but it was too much to hope for. It was too much\nto dare imagine that the boy he was half in love with &ndash; it didn&rsquo;t matter that\nhe hadn&rsquo;t known him for very long &ndash; could maybe, possibly, hopefully like him\nback? Maybe?</p><p>&ldquo;Milk? In your hot chocolate?&rdquo;\nJungkook called from the kitchen and Yoongi gave an affirmative as he stood up\nto peer around the room.</p><p>A book shelf lay opposite, two\nrows of books with a row of photo frames sandwiched between them, and all of\nthem slightly dusty. Yoongi chuckled as he looked at each one &ndash; Jungkook and\nJimin grinning at the camera with their arms around each other, Taehyung laughing\nas Jungkook struggled to hold onto an angry tomcat, Jimin and Taehyung hugging\nJungkook from either side &ndash; in every photo, they looked happy, so happy with\neach other and it tugged at Yoongi&rsquo;s heartstrings. Jungkook&rsquo;s smile, thinner\ntop lip and full bottom lip, two small indentations where his front teeth had\nbitten down, a bunny smile. </p><p>He nudged them aside to see\nthe photos hidden behind the first row and smiled again &ndash; Jungkook and a boy so\nalike him in looks that it must&rsquo;ve been his brother, three photos of the sun\nrising over Busan, an older couple waving at the camera with their hands\nlinked. The photographer was incredibly talented.</p><p>Pushed into the corner, however,\nwas another picture. Blurry and clearly taken mid-movement, Yoongi hesitated in\ntouching it, in recognising that someone he didn&rsquo;t know was touching Jungkook\nlike that, smiling at him like that, kissing him <i>like that</i>. In the photo, Jungkook was smiling at the camera, both\nhis hands thrown around the neck of another man, someone taller, obviously\nolder, as the stranger had his lips pressed to the boy&rsquo;s forehead. Yoongi didn&rsquo;t\nlike it.</p><p>He knew it was petty of him,\nbut he took a sick pleasure in shoving the photo back into the corner with the two\nsmiling faces against the wall. It was an old photo, he reasoned, the date in\nthe corner had been nearly three years previous, and Jungkook had probably\nforgotten about it.</p><p>Rearranging the front row of\nphotos to effectively hide the offending reminder quickly, Yoongi turned away\njust in time to see Jungkook hurrying back into the room, carefully balancing a\nmug of hot chocolate and what looked like black coffee.</p><p>The younger boy was sheepish\nas he handed Yoongi his drink, watching nervously as he took in the rising spiral\nof whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles adorning it. Yoongi raised an eyebrow as\nhe met the others gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;I might need a spoon for this,&rdquo;\nhe said but the delighted smile curling at his mouth betrayed the indifference\nof his tone and Jungkook relaxed.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I think you&rsquo;d\nsuit a white moustache,&rdquo; the younger man teased, eyes alight with mirth but\nlingering on his mouth, a hint of something dark coming across his expression\nbefore smoothing out. Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;d imagined it.</p><p>&ldquo;I do look good in white,&rdquo; Yoongi\nlet his tongue dart out, a quick swipe across his lower lip and Jungkook\nswallowed. He definitely did not imagine that. Small victories.</p><p>Sipping from his mug, they\nboth sat down, Yoongi curled into the armchair and Jungkook settling across\nfrom him on the sofa. Somehow, the older man pondered, Jungkook managed to sit\nregally, like a King demanding attention, rather than the twenty-one-year-old\nstudent that he was. He distracted himself by licking at the cream atop his drink.\nJungkook coughed.</p><p>&ldquo;I did want to talk,&rdquo; he started,\nfiddling with his own cup. &ldquo;Tae and Jimin know some of it, but they aren&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t sure what that\nhad to do with anything.</p><p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know why, but it&rsquo;s\nimportant to me that you know the whole thing. Hyung I don&rsquo;t want to sound clich&eacute;\nby saying there&rsquo;s something different about you, but you make me feel at home. Talking\nto you feels like having a conversation with an extension of myself, and I <i>need</i> you to understand everything.&rdquo;\nJungkook was leaning forward now, an urgency appearing as he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening, Kooks,&rdquo; Yoongi\nmurmured, reeling. This strong, beautiful boy felt at home with him &ndash; with <i>him</i> &ndash; and he wanted to cry again.</p><p>Jungkook closed his eyes for a\nmoment.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok&hellip; ok. So. Lunch with\nYugyeom and Bambam today. It didn&rsquo;t go well.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi snorted. That was an\nunderstatement. Seeing a wild Taehyung appear and scream profanities at a\nstunned Bambam before punching him had been the highlight of his week. He&rsquo;d wanted\nto buy the kid dinner after that but had been too preoccupied with keeping\nJungkook from running away like he had. Terse words had been exchanged with\nYugyeom before he had left, dragging an angry Bambam behind him, but Jungkook\nhad stayed, had calmed down as Yoongi ran warm hands up and down his back. It\nhad been one of his proudest moments.</p><p>Jungkook gave a wry smile at\nYoongi&rsquo;s reaction. &ldquo;I told you Bambam fucked my ex, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he did. I&rsquo;d been dating\nSehun since I was eighteen, he was older than me by a couple of years but he\nwas amazing. He refused to do anything with me until I was of legal age,&rdquo; Jungkook\nlaughed at the memory. &ldquo;But he made me laugh, took me so many places, treated\nme like an <i>equal</i> and not just some\nkid who had a crush on him. He was my first love, my first everything&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Something ugly twisted in\nYoongi&rsquo;s chest but he ignored it. The photo in the corner came back to his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;He loved to dance, as well,\nand we made up so many routines together,&rdquo; the boy seemed lost in his memories for\na moment and completely missed Yoongi&rsquo;s bitter mutter of <i>I can dance, too</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s, kind of how it all\nstarted to go wrong,&rdquo; the smile on his face was now pained and Yoongi reached\nover to lace his fingers with Jungkooks.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok,&rdquo; he whispered, not too\nsure himself why he was speaking so quietly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>Long, callused fingers hesitantly\nthreaded themselves between his own, gripping tightly, and suddenly Jungkook&rsquo;s\nsmile became a little more real.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to know, though.&rdquo; He\nsaid and picked up the story again. &ldquo;I always attended this dance class with\nYugyeom and Bambam &ndash; I got to know them because of it &ndash; and it was always a\nsafe place for me, so one day I brought Sehun with me. I don&rsquo;t know, I thought\nit would be a fun thing to do together. And it was! In the beginning&hellip; But\nBambam was always a flirty little fucker and Sehun was just too oblivious to\nnotice what was going on.&rdquo;</p><p>The hand Yoongi held between\nhis own shook slightly, and he thought Jungkook was trying not to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;I told him to stop, <i>Yugyeom</i> told him to stop, but he wouldn&rsquo;t.\nIt got worse &ndash; there was a group performance at the end of term, a big one, and\nwe all had a partner for it. I was with Sehun &ndash; of course I was &ndash; but Bambam\ntold the instructor we&rsquo;d get distracted if we were allowed to dance together. He\nsaid our <i>emotions</i> would make us act\nunprofessionally, and the instructor actually <i>agreed</i>,&rdquo; Jungkook choked on a rising sob and Yoongi pretended not\nto notice. &ldquo;They split us up, put me with Yugyeom and Sehun with Bambam.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi could see where it was going\nand he didn&rsquo;t like it. The sudden urge to track Bambam down and do more than\npunch him in the face took hold and he gritted his teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;But Sehun didn&rsquo;t do anything!\nHe wouldn&rsquo;t! He was with <i>me</i>, and\nSehun wasn&rsquo;t a cheater,&rdquo; Jungkook was still talking, spilling it into the air\nas if it would somehow release him from the lingering pain. &ldquo;And Bambam knew that!\nSo he started saying stuff, making it seem like I wanted more than friendship from\nYugyeom &ndash; that every time we laughed or got lunch together it meant something\nmore. And it didn&rsquo;t! It never did! But he was manipulative. He got under my boyfriend&rsquo;s\nskin and made him doubt me, doubt <i>us</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook was shaking so much the\ncoffee in his other hand was rippling inside the mug and Yoongi had to gently\nwrench it from his grip before it spilled. He placed the mug on the side table\nbeside his own and moved until he was kneeling between the boys legs, looking\nup at him. </p><p>Tears streaked down Jungkooks\nface, getting caught in his eyelashes and on the tip of his slightly-too-big\nnose, and Yoongi scrunched his fist inside the sleeve of his jumper before\nwiping them away. Glossy eyes streaked with red were wide as they stared down\nat him and Yoongi tried very hard not to blush under the weight of such\nundivided attention.</p><p>&ldquo;That Bambam guy was a dick\nanyway,&rdquo; he murmured and Jungkook blinked. &ldquo;If Tae hadn&rsquo;t already smacked him\nlike he did, I had half a mind to go and finish the job. I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t\nneed a dick when he&rsquo;s already such a big one.&rdquo;</p><p>A startled laugh escaped the\nyounger boy and he gave Yoongi a tentative smile. Yoongi responded with a shy\ngrin and leaned back.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah so,&rdquo; Jungkook said\nquietly. &ldquo;Sehun didn&rsquo;t say anything, because he was never the kind to talk\nabout his problems &ndash; never wanted to burden anyone else with his insecurities because\nhe thought it reflected badly on him &ndash; and the final performance came. It was\ngood, we all did good. And Bambam suggested we all go out afterwards to\ncelebrate. I didn&rsquo;t say no, and so we went. And Bambam got Sehun drunk. Like,\nreally drunk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Jungkookie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The younger boy sounded so sad,\nso heartbroken, and in that instant, Yoongi hated everything. He hated Bambam\nand everything his smug face had done. He hated Sehun for hurting Jungkook like\nhe had. He hated Jungkook for letting himself be hurt. And he hated himself,\nfor not being honest with himself and his friends about who he was.</p><p>Jungkook shrugged. &ldquo;I found\nout months later. Sehun had started avoiding me, saying he was too busy to go\non dates, asked me for a break. I gave it to him &ndash; I thought it was just exam\nstress. It was Yugyeom, who told me, in the end. Couldn&rsquo;t take the guilt of knowing.\nSehun cried when I broke up with him. I know he didn&rsquo;t cheat on me\nintentionally &ndash; his soul is too good for that. But he was hurt, and confused,\nand fucking Bambam had gotten into his head, and he just didn&rsquo;t come and <i>talk</i> to me. He could&rsquo;ve just fucking <i>talked to me.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi didn&rsquo;t know what to say,\nbut it was clear that Jungkook was done talking. The boy was still crying, silently\ncringing against his own mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Those were the\nonly words that the smaller man could utter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry, Jungkook. <i>Fuck</i> I&rsquo;m sorry that bastard felt he\ncould do that to you, I&rsquo;m sorry that you&rsquo;re still in pain, I&rsquo;m sorry that Tae\ndidn&rsquo;t do more than punch that asshole in the face.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok, hyung,&rdquo; Jungkook\nsniffled out. &ldquo;It was two years ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Time doesn&rsquo;t heal everything,&rdquo;\nYoongi said gently. &ldquo;And you still love him.&rdquo;</p><p>At that, Jungkook shook his\nhead. &ldquo;No. No I miss him, but I don&rsquo;t love him anymore. I know that. I&rsquo;ve moved\non.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He never changed his number. We&rsquo;ve\nbeen texting for a couple of weeks and I&rsquo;m fine. I don&rsquo;t want him back, hyung.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Yoongi drew a blank. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s\ngood, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&hellip; actually been asking\nfor his advice&hellip;&rdquo; Jungkook said, cautiously, watching to see how Yoongi would\nreact. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone I like, someone I&rsquo;ve liked for a while and I want to\nask him out.&rdquo;</p><p>Inside his chest, Yoongi&rsquo;s\nheart crippled under the sudden pain. Of course Jungkook had someone! Of course\na guy as wonderful as him would not be single for very long! It was ridiculous\nto have even entertained the possibility that he had a chance.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope it all works out for\nyou, Kooks.&rdquo; He tried to smile, though it probably came across more as a grimace.\n&ldquo;Any man would be lucky to call you theirs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; Jungkook was\neager, the sadness from before washed away to be replaced by something akin to\nhope. Yoongi didn&rsquo;t know what he was hoping for.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he replied, crawling\nbackwards. Maybe if he got some distance between himself and Jungkook, the pain\nwould decrease, but Jungkook followed him. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You said he&rsquo;d think himself\nlucky?&rdquo; The younger boy seriously resembled a bunny with his hands on his knees\nand face sticking upwards. He looked a little ridiculous and Yoongi wished he\nwasn&rsquo;t so endeared.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously? He&rsquo;d jump into\nyour arms as soon as you even hint that you like him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Jungkook was\nsuddenly sceptical and Yoongi was going to get whiplash from the sudden change\nof emotion.</p><p>Yoongi nodded and Jungkook frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re wrong. He didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip;&rdquo; The smaller man didn&rsquo;t\nknow where to go from there.
