Because of Jon\u2019s status, he doesn\u2019t sit with the rest of his family. He sets up the atmosphere of the feast.\u00a0<br/></p><p><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">Jon is a perfect character to bridge the gap between the nobles and common folk. He is the son of a lord so we get a glimpse of the lives of a noble family but his status as a bastard means he has to sit with the common folk.</span></p><p>Jon tries to find a positive side of his situation. We get an impression of the royal family from a different perspective. Cersei, a jeweled up beautiful queen with a fake, insincere smile. Robert, a disappointment who doesn&rsquo;t match up to Ned\u2019s stories. Myrcella, s shy, timid, insipid 8 years old. Tommen, a plump child with long hair. Joffery, a 12-year old who despite being younger than Jon and Robb is taller than them with blond curls and green eyes but Jon doesn\u2019t like Joffery\u2019s pouty lips or the way who looked at Winterfell. Jon then describes Jamie Lannister who despite being a Kingslayer is admired by Jon as he describes Jamie to be what a king should look like. Tyrion is the dwarf described by Jon to be ugly with mismatched eyes but fascinated Jon.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>We also get a glimpse of Jon\u2019s relationship with his family. Ned is his father. Catelyn is referred to a Lady Stark indicating distance. Rickon as an innocent 3-year-old wants to greet Jon but is urged on by Jon who knows better. Robb, a brother whom he loves but is bitter towards. Arya is his half-sister. Sansa is his half-sister whom he describes as radiant. Uncle Benjen of Night Watch is described with affection. Theon Greyjoy and Jon seem to have some rift.\u00a0</p><p>We are again given a glimpse of the difference between Jon and his half-siblings. His half-siblings weren&rsquo;t allowed to bring their pups but no one cared if Jon brought his pup so he feeds his pup under the table. We again see Jon\u2019s struggle to find something positive out of his status.\u00a0</p><p>Ghost his pup is a symbolism of Jon. A bitch underestimates Ghost because of his size but Ghost manages to stand strong against her.\u00a0</p><p>We meet Benjen, Ned\u2019s brother Benjen and Jon share a warm relationship. The difference between Ghost and the other pups is again a representation of the difference between Jon and the other Stark kids. They talk about Lady Stark not wanting Jon to sit with his siblings because it might be seen as an insult to the royal family. We get to see Jon\u2019s observant side when he notices Ned\u2019s unhappiness, Robert\u2019s overindulgence, and Cersei&rsquo;s coldness and anger.</p><p>Jon wants to join Benjen at the Wall but Benjen wants him to rethink it. Jon tries to convince him by telling that Bastards grow older faster and citing Daeron Targaryen conquering Dorne when he was 14. Benjen then points out that Daeron lost thousands of men and died when he was 18.</p><p> <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">No character is perfect. While we fell sad for Jon and see a lot of his positive attributes he is still a child and very naive. He can see the glory in Daeron\u2019s victory but he doesn&rsquo;t see the losses and negative aspects.\u00a0</span></p><p>We see this has been something Jon has thought a lot about. He feels unsure about his future. They continue to debate and it ends with Jon proclaiming:\u00a0</p><p> <span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cI will never father a bastard,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cNever!\u201d He spat it out like venom.</span><br/></p><p>Jon feels embarrassed by the attention and tries to leave, bringing more attention because of his drunkenness. Jon with Ghost meets Tyrion at the yard. They talk about Ghost. Ghost is a fierce but loyal and trained pup. When Jon is called a bastard by Tyrion he gets upset. We get to see that Jon has some pride over looking more northerner compared to his brothers despite being a bastard. Tyrion tries to teach Jon a valuable lesson.\u00a0</p><p> <span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cNever forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness.

He is the son of a lord so we get a glimpse of the lives of a noble family but his status as a bastard means he has to sit with the common folk.</span></p><p>Jon tries to find a positive side of his situation. We get an impression of the royal family from a different perspective. Cersei, a jeweled up beautiful queen with a fake, insincere smile. Robert, a disappointment who doesn\u2019t match up to Ned\u2019s stories. Myrcella, s shy, timid, insipid 8 years old. Tommen, a plump child with long hair. Joffery, a 12-year old who despite being younger than Jon and Robb is taller than them with blond curls and green eyes but Jon doesn\u2019t like Joffery\u2019s pouty lips or the way who looked at Winterfell. Jon then describes Jamie Lannister who despite being a Kingslayer is admired by Jon as he describes Jamie to be what a king should look like. Tyrion is the dwarf described by Jon to be ugly with mismatched eyes but fascinated Jon.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>We also get a glimpse of Jon\u2019s relationship with his family. Ned is his father. Catelyn is referred to a Lady Stark indicating distance. Rickon as an innocent 3-year-old wants to greet Jon but is urged on by Jon who knows better. Robb, a brother whom he loves but is bitter towards. Arya is his half-sister. Sansa is his half-sister whom he describes as radiant. Uncle Benjen of Night Watch is described with affection. Theon Greyjoy and Jon seem to have some rift.\u00a0</p><p>We are again given a glimpse of the difference between Jon and his half-siblings. His half-siblings weren\u2019t allowed to bring their pups but no one cared if Jon brought his pup so he feeds his pup under the table. We again see Jon\u2019s struggle to find something positive out of his status.\u00a0</p><p>Ghost his pup is a symbolism of Jon. A bitch underestimates Ghost because of his size but Ghost manages to stand strong against her.\u00a0</p><p>We meet Benjen, Ned\u2019s brother Benjen and Jon share a warm relationship. The difference between Ghost and the other pups is again a representation of the difference between Jon and the other Stark kids. They talk about Lady Stark not wanting Jon to sit with his siblings because it might be seen as an insult to the royal family. We get to see Jon\u2019s observant side when he notices Ned\u2019s unhappiness, Robert\u2019s overindulgence, and Cersei\u2019s coldness and anger.</p><p>Jon wants to join Benjen at the Wall but Benjen wants him to rethink it. Jon tries to convince him by telling that Bastards grow older faster and citing Daeron Targaryen conquering Dorne when he was 14. Benjen then points out that Daeron lost thousands of men and died when he was 18.</p><p> <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">No character is perfect. While we fell sad for Jon and see a lot of his positive attributes he is still a child and very naive. He can see the glory in Daeron\u2019s victory but he doesn\u2019t see the losses and negative aspects.\u00a0</span></p><p>We see this has been something Jon has thought a lot about. He feels unsure about his future. They continue to debate and it ends with Jon proclaiming:\u00a0</p><p> <span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cI will never father a bastard,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cNever!\u201d He spat it out like venom.</span><br></p><p>Jon feels embarrassed by the attention and tries to leave, bringing more attention because of his drunkenness. Jon with Ghost meets Tyrion at the yard. They talk about Ghost. Ghost is a fierce but loyal and trained pup. When Jon is called a bastard by Tyrion he gets upset. We get to see that Jon has some pride over looking more northerner compared to his brothers despite being a bastard. Tyrion tries to teach Jon a valuable lesson.\u00a0</p><p> <span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">\u201cNever forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength.

        "answer": "<p>I get where you\u2019re coming from, Anon, and I agree to some extent. However, the only POV that really feels <i>way</i> too old to me is Bran\u2019s. GRRM has said that he has trouble with Bran\u2019s POV the most because it\u2019s hard to write from the mind of someone that young, and yeah, it shows in his writing sometimes. Even with Bran, though, there are plenty of times when Bran sounds age appropriate (Like \u201cWhy would anyone kill Jory?\u201d or\u00a0\u201cHe sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them.\u201d)</p><p>But, you asked for examples, so here\u2019s my thoughts on it:</p><p>Jon\u2019s POV is age appropriate, to an extent. At the start of his story, he\u2019s an angsty, bratty teen with a good heart, and reads like it, for the most part.<br/></p><p>I think Sansa and Arya start off acting their age, for sure. Sansa\u2019s romanticism in the beginning of her arc is age appropriate, and written accordingly. I love that Arya calls everything and everyone \u201cstupid,\u201d and Sansa refers to her stomach as her \u201ctummy.\u201d Language like that definitely shows their age. Also, Sansa and Arya\u2019s sisterly beef with each other is written perfectly, considering their ages.</p><p>However, after Sansa goes through her trauma and has grown accustomed to being a prisoner, her POV matures in a way that, while fascinating to read, still feels a bit too\u00a0\u201cold\u201d sometimes in my opinion, if that makes sense. Like, she\u2019s just 13, but she tends to sound like someone in their later teens, and though that doesn\u2019t sound like a huge difference, the mind of someone who\u2019s 17-19 is far different from someone who just turned 13. I get why GRRM would do that, because trauma can definitely age a child, and it\u2019s beautiful writing, but I think sometimes it\u2019s just too old in how it reads. IIRC, though (correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m not a Sansa expert), she still calls her stomach her\u00a0\u201ctummy,\u201d so there\u2019s that. That word is associated with youth and innocence, so when Sansa starts saying\u00a0\u201cstomach\u201d or\u00a0\u201cbelly\u201d more than\u00a0\u201ctummy\u201d &hellip; I think it\u2019ll be kinda sad, because it will represent more of her lost/stolen innocence, due to her trauma.</p><p>I think George does a better job with making Arya still sound childish, even after she\u2019s traumatized. The way she thinks of her lost identity (\u201chad she dreamed Arya Stark?\u201d) gets the job done as far as storytelling and characterization goes, while saying it in a\u00a0\u201cchildish\u201d way.</p><p>Dany\u2019s POV is weird. Sometimes she sounds young \u2014 maybe not as young as 13, but considering her backstory, she\u2019s been forced to grow up long before the Stark children, so that makes sense. I think if her story started when she was 15 instead of 13, it would sound more\u00a0\u201cright,\u201d but honestly, with the whole dramatically written crush over Daario and the mistakes she makes as a ruler, I think you can tell that she\u2019s a teenager.</p><p>I think Theon\u2019s POV is age appropriate. He\u2019s college age, and acts like a particularly douchey frat boy. And when the Reek thing happens, he\u2019s old enough that the change in prose doesn\u2019t sound awkward. It\u2019s all written perfectly.</p><p>Also, if non-POV characters count, Tommen and Sweetrobin act pretty age appropriate. Myrcella feels like an intelligent child. I don\u2019t know, I think GRRM does a good job on this for the most part.\u00a0</p>",

GRRM has said that he has trouble with Bran\u2019s POV the most because it\u2019s hard to write from the mind of someone that young, and yeah, it shows in his writing sometimes. Even with Bran, though, there are plenty of times when Bran sounds age appropriate (Like \u201cWhy would anyone kill Jory?\u201d or\u00a0\u201cHe sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them.\u201d)</p><p>But, you asked for examples, so here\u2019s my thoughts on it:</p><p>Jon\u2019s POV is age appropriate, to an extent. At the start of his story, he\u2019s an angsty, bratty teen with a good heart, and reads like it, for the most part.<br></p><p>I think Sansa and Arya start off acting their age, for sure. Sansa\u2019s romanticism in the beginning of her arc is age appropriate, and written accordingly. I love that Arya calls everything and everyone \u201cstupid,\u201d and Sansa refers to her stomach as her \u201ctummy.\u201d Language like that definitely shows their age. Also, Sansa and Arya\u2019s sisterly beef with each other is written perfectly, considering their ages.</p><p>However, after Sansa goes through her trauma and has grown accustomed to being a prisoner, her POV matures in a way that, while fascinating to read, still feels a bit too\u00a0\u201cold\u201d sometimes in my opinion, if that makes sense. Like, she\u2019s just 13, but she tends to sound like someone in their later teens, and though that doesn\u2019t sound like a huge difference, the mind of someone who\u2019s 17-19 is far different from someone who just turned 13. I get why GRRM would do that, because trauma can definitely age a child, and it\u2019s beautiful writing, but I think sometimes it\u2019s just too old in how it reads. IIRC, though (correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m not a Sansa expert), she still calls her stomach her\u00a0\u201ctummy,\u201d so there\u2019s that. That word is associated with youth and innocence, so when Sansa starts saying\u00a0\u201cstomach\u201d or\u00a0\u201cbelly\u201d more than\u00a0\u201ctummy\u201d \u2026 I think it\u2019ll be kinda sad, because it will represent more of her lost/stolen innocence, due to her trauma.</p><p>I think George does a better job with making Arya still sound childish, even after she\u2019s traumatized. The way she thinks of her lost identity (\u201chad she dreamed Arya Stark?\u201d) gets the job done as far as storytelling and characterization goes, while saying it in a\u00a0\u201cchildish\u201d way.</p><p>Dany\u2019s POV is weird. Sometimes she sounds young \u2014 maybe not as young as 13, but considering her backstory, she\u2019s been forced to grow up long before the Stark children, so that makes sense. I think if her story started when she was 15 instead of 13, it would sound more\u00a0\u201cright,\u201d but honestly, with the whole dramatically written crush over Daario and the mistakes she makes as a ruler, I think you can tell that she\u2019s a teenager.</p><p>I think Theon\u2019s POV is age appropriate. He\u2019s college age, and acts like a particularly douchey frat boy. And when the Reek thing happens, he\u2019s old enough that the change in prose doesn\u2019t sound awkward. It\u2019s all written perfectly.</p><p>Also, if non-POV characters count, Tommen and Sweetrobin act pretty age appropriate. Myrcella feels like an intelligent child. I don\u2019t know, I think GRRM does a good job on this for the most part.\u00a0</p>",
