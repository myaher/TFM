So?\u201d Arthur asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she be here if Vortigern\ndidn\u2019t care for her?\u201d Bill pointed out. \u201cShe has to be somehow necessary. He <i>bought</i> her.\u201d</p><p>Bedivere turned to Percival. \u201cHow\nmuch did the king pay for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not know exactly.\u201d He\ninformed the others. \u201cHowever, Maggie heard rumors that go anywhere from a\nhundred to a thousand ships.\u201d</p><p>Arthur arched a brow. \u201cHe exchanged\none girl for ships?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Percival confirmed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo she thinks he does not care for\nher\u2026\u201d Bill started.</p><p>\u201cBut he must want something.\u201d\nBedivere completed.</p><p>\u201cAnd the question is\u2026 What?\u201d Bill\nfinished.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Maggie say she is the last\nof her family?\u201d Rubio interrupted. \u201cMaybe he wants her lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is it that much?\u201d Wet Stick\nthrew in. \u201cI mean, if she was the princess and all, but isn\u2019t she just the\ndaughter of someone?\u201d</p><p>That made them all quiet.</p><p>\u201cThere is another possibility.\u201d Mage\nsuddenly spoke, attracting everybody\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Arthur\nwanted to know.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know about Westeros?\u201d\nShe asked.</p><p>\n\u201cDragons.\u201d Most people around the room said at the same time.</p><p>The Mage rolled her eyes. \u201cBesides\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d Bedivere admitted. \u201cI\nremember something about Kings that married their sisters, and a great wall,\nbut not much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember the story about a wall\ntoo.\u201d Bill said, then shrugged. \u201cBut no more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said her name is Stark, right?\u201d\nRubio asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bedivere confirmed.</p><p>\u201cI used to know the name of the old\nHouses of Westeros.\u201d The boy commented. \u201cMy father liked to test me in the\nsmallest things. What I know is that her House is one of the oldest ones. I\nmight be remembering this wrong, but I think they were once called the Kings of\nWinter.\u201d</p><p>The Mage arched a brow and Bill\nnoticed. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d He wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOld families often have magic in\ntheir blood.\u201d She started explaining. \u201cIf the House managed to keep the\nbloodline somewhat pure\u2026\u201d She looked into the distance. \u201cShe might still have a good amount of magic\nin her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can Vortigern use it for?\u201d\nBedivere questioned.</p><p>\n\u201cMany things.\u201d The Mage shrugged. \u201cIf she is a virgin, he might even sacrifice\nher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was going to sacrifice her he\ncould have done it as soon as he got her.\u201d Back Slack indicated.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wants to wait for the\nTower to be ready.\u201d Bedivere reasoned.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe he will marry her.\u201d Bill\npointed out.</p><p>They all turned to him. \u201cHe does not\nhave an heir.\u201d The man indicated. \u201cPrincess Katia cannot assume the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could want the magic blood for\nhis heir.\u201d The Mage agreed.</p><p>\n\u201cBut again\u2026 Why hasn\u2019t he married her already?\u201d Wet Stick pushed.</p><p>\u201cShe is too young.\u201d Back Lack\nindicated. \u201cHe looked at her, saw his daughter; couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany nobles do it without thinking\nabout it.\u201d Bedivere reminded the other man.</p><p>\u201cHow many of them keep their\ndaughters inside a castle?\u201d Back Lack insisted. \u201cThe lass doesn\u2019t even have a\nbetrothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure, but it is a\npossibility.\u201d Rubio sighed.</p><p>\u201cThere is only one way to know.\u201d The\nMage concluded. \u201cI need her blood.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at her like she was\ncrazy. \u201cWhat for?\u201d Wet Stick demanded, shocked.</p><p>\u201cSo I can see if it has magic.\u201d The\nMage said as if it was obvious.</p><p>\u201cHer blood?\u201d He insisted, still a\nbit shocked.</p><p>The Mage rolled her eyes. \u201cFine. A\nlock of hair will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have started with that.\u201d\nBack Lack pointed out dryly.</p><p>\u201cBlood would be better.\u201d The Mage\nsimply said.</p><p>\u201cBut even if it is just the hair\u2026\nHow are we going to get it?\u201d Percival asked.</p><p>\n\u201cI will get it.\u201d Arthur suddenly said.</p><p>He\u2019d been quiet this whole time,\nlistening to this conversation and the theories being thrown around.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d Back Lack\nasked.</p><p>\n\u201cI will go and get it.\u201d Arthur repeated firmly.</p><p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d Bill wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cIt is too risky.\u201d Bedivere was\nalready shaking his head. \u201cYou cannot go\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Bedivere.\u201d Arthur brushed\noff his protests. \u201cI can be in and out before anyone notices. I\u2019m the most\nindicated for this.\u201d</p><p>Bill was looking at him, an eyebrow\narched. \u201cOr you just really want to see the lady.\u201d</p><p>Arthur snorted. \u201cI never said I\ndid.\u201d</p><p>Bill scoffed. \u201cLe him go, if he\nthinks he is the best choice.\u201d The man drawled.</p><p>\u201cI do not even know why you are\npretending I have any say over this.\u201d Bedivere grumbled.</p><p>\n\u201cThat is the spirit, Bed.\u201d Arthur slapped the older man on the shoulder.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cIs this better?\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked at the handkerchief\nKatia was presenting her.</p><p>\u201cIt is much better, princess.\u201d She\ntold the other woman honestly. \u201cYou are improving greatly.\u201d</p><p>Katia\u2019s cheeks were flushed with the\npraise. \u201cIt is because you are so patient. My tutor was always snapping at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is hardly necessary.\u201d</p><p>Katia put her embroidery down.\n\u201cSansa\u2026 How was being betrothed to someone?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s hand paused on her work.\n\u201cPerhaps\u2026 I am not the best person to ask, princess.\u201d</p><p>Katia blushed furiously. \u201cI am so\nsorry! This was so unsensitive of me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is no problem, Katia.\u201d Sansa\ngave her a small smile.</p><p>Nowadays, Katia was the only person\nthat got honest smiles from Sansa. The young princess was honestly good, even\nif she occasionally had bratty moments. Sansa felt truly sorry for her, locked\naway in a castle, waiting for life to pass her by.</p><p>It was strange to feel protective of\nsomeone that was older than her. However, Katia was unbelievably na\u00efve; like Sansa\nhad been one day.</p><p>\u201cIt was a dream, at first.\u201d Sansa\nfinally replied. \u201cHe was my beautiful golden prince and I would be queen one\nday. I blinded myself to all the signs that were shoved in my face, I ignored\nmy father\u2019s advice and my own intuition\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa paused and took a deep breath,\nbefore looking at Katia. \u201cMy father said he would find someone worthy of me;\nstrong, gentle and brave. I told him I did not want that, I wanted Joffrey.\u201d\nShe shook her head at herself. \u201cI was a stupid little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for asking.\u201d Katia\nmurmured softly.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to find a knight of\nyour own.\u201d Sansa told her gently. \u201cBut your father loves you\u2026\u201d At least Sansa\nthought he did. \u201cHe is probably waiting to find the best possible match for\nyou.\u201d</p><p>Katia gave her a small smile. \u201cI\nalways wanted to fall in love.\u201d She confessed. \u201cLike in the songs you sing.\u201d</p><p>Sansa just smiled at her, because\nshe didn\u2019t have the heart to tell Katia that songs were all lies and there was\nno one gentle, brave and strong in this world.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p><p>Arthur arched a brow at Percival.\n\u201cYou offered to come.\u201d He reminded the other man dryly.</p><p>\u201cI am talking to myself.\u201d Percival\ntold him.</p><p>\u201cIf you are scared you can go, lad.\u201d\nBack Lack threw at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is a stupid idea from a strategic\npoint of view.\u201d Percival indicated. \u201cIf they catch us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t get caught.\u201d Arthur\nspoke as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cThen no problems.\u201d</p><p>Percival\u2019s expression revealed his\ncomplete lack of amusement.</p><p>\u201cNow, Back Lack.\u201d Arthur turned to\nthe man. \u201cKeep the horses ready in case we have to leave in a hurry.</p><p>\n\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d He turned to Percival. \u201cStart\nclimbing.\u201d</p><p>Percival sighed, but turned to the\noutside wall of the small keep and did was he was ordered.</p><p>They decided to get inside the place\nwithout Maggie\u2019s help, so in case they were found, nobody could implicate\nanyone of the house as accomplice.</p><p>Percival still thought it was a\nstupid idea, but he had volunteered to come. Mostly because he knew the keep.</p><p>A lot had changed in his life since\nhe\u2019d become involved with the rebels, but Percival was, actually, from a noble\nfamily; a lower, but noble nonetheless. His parents knew Maggie\u2019s family and\nthey\u2019d played together as children, including in this particular place.</p><p>It was how they all got involved\nwith the rebels. Well, not all of them, most of Maggie\u2019s family was still\npretty much in favor of the King, if nothing else for fear.</p><p>They landed by the side of the stable,\nand looked around. \u201cThe rooms used to be over there.\u201d Percival pointed for\nArthur. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have changed that.\u201d</p><p>Arthur slapped him on the shoulder.\n\u201cExcellent. You come with me, guard the entrance. If someone suspects anything,\nwhistle and I\u2019ll come down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because me whistling out of nowhere\nwon\u2019t be suspicious at all.\u201d</p><p>Arthur -as expected -just ignored\nhim again. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Percival sighed. Why was he here\nagain?</p><p>***</p><p>Sansa felt as if she was playing\nsome odd game of cat and mouse with Lady Maggie. The lady in question had been\navoiding being alone with her; she only engaged Sansa in extremely polite\nconversation and never stayed in a situation where they could have a private talk\neven among other people.</p><p>Sansa had avoided her for a while\ntoo, right after they came back from Londinium. \u00a0However, once she realized Maggie was running\nfrom her, Sansa decided to change tactics. She had no intention of talking to\nMaggie about the rebels and what had happened on Londinium, but\u2026 The other\nwoman didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>There was something there, and Sansa\nwanted to know what it was. She was tired of being a pawn and being passed from\none side to the other. She didn\u2019t know exactly what she was doing, but it was\nstill interesting to watch Maggie squirming.</p><p>She went to her chambers after\nsupper, decided to think better about the situation, but the Gods where never\nin her favor.</p><p>As soon as she opened the door she\nfound <i>him</i>, leaning against her wall,\ncasually flipping through one of the poetry books she had.</p><p>For a delirious second, she prayed\nshe had finally lost her mind, but then he raised his eyes briefly to her and\nsaid, \u201cWhat took you so long, Red?\u201d and she realized this was real.</p><p>She closed the door behind herself. \u201cWhat\nare you doing here?\u201d She demanded, her voice a hiss, wildly looking around.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I should say something\ndramatic and poetic about\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGET OUT!\u201d She almost screeched, but\nseemed to control herself at the last minute.</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nyou. You\u2019re destroying my fantasy here.\u201d He told her dryly.</p><p>\u201cYour\nfantasy?\u201d She was astounded by the nerve\u2026 \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She\ndemanded once again.</p><p>\u201cCame\nto see you.\u201d He declared simply, putting the book down on the closest flat\nsurface.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\nShe wanted to know. \u201cI already told you I have no value\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nsee\u2026\u201d He shook his finger at her. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, princess. The\nKing paid for you. You have to be valuable somehow.\u201d He looked her up and down.\n\u201cIs he visiting your chambers at night?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\ngasped. \u201cWhat? How dare you? King Vortigern treats me with respect\u2026\u201d</p><p>Arthur\nrolled his eyes. \u201cSo a few kind words are enough for you to defend a man like\nhim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d\nShe snapped. \u201cIt is! Because the previous King I lived with liked to humiliate\nme as much as possible, and -on occasion -beat me up in front of the rest of\nthe court. So forgive me, if I seek a bit of peace now.\u201d</p><p>Arthur\ntook a deep breath, and Sansa saw his hands closing on fists by his side. She\ntook a step back, suddenly a bit scared.</p><p>\u201cWhy\nis it enough?\u201d He demanded again. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be still hoping? Shouldn\u2019t you\nstill want a hero?\u201d</p><p>She\nscoffed. \u201cThere are no heroes. In this world we live in, no one can save\nanyone.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Percival tried to be as\ninconspicuous as possible, while he kept his post on the stables. From that\nposition, he could clearly see the hallway that led to the family chambers of\nthe keep. If soldiers tried to capture Arthur, they\u2019d have to go through there,\nand the Born King would have to fly to escape them.</p><p>Percival snorted; it\u2019d\nserve Arthur well if he got a scare out of this. He had no idea what the other\nman had on his mind, but this was a stupid idea, no matter how one looked at\nit.</p><p>He wondered if Arthur\nwas truly doing this just to see the girl again, but then discarded the idea as\nan absurd one. Arthur knew how important this was; he wouldn\u2019t risk anything\nfor a girl he\u2019d seen twice -once being from a distance.</p><p>While he was there\nwaiting, a stable-hand saw him and told him to check on Pearl. Percival\ncouldn\u2019t say no, so he went to check on Pearl.</p><p>Pearl turned out to be a\nsweet mare that had a love for apples and a foal on the way.</p><p>Percival knew how to\ncare for horses; even before this whole rebel thing happened, his father had\nloved horses, and insisted that Percival knew how to properly care for them. It\nwas no sacrifice for him to check Pearl\u2019s stall and sneak her an apple. Her\nstall was in a position that allowed him to keep his eyes on his real task, so\nhe decided to give her a gentle brushing.</p><p>He was humming an old\nlullaby -one his mother used to sing to them -when he heard steps. He kept what\nhe was doing, but there was a certain tension on his shoulders; these were soft\nsteps, definitely not the other stable-hand.</p><p>The steps came closer and Percival met\nthe startled eyes of Princess Katia.</p><p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d He spoke quickly,\nlowering his eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to be worried about\nbeing recognized by the princess. As previously said, he\u2019d been a lower noble,\nhardly the type that met the King or his precious daughter.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cI came\nto see Pearl. Lord Alistair said she is expecting a foal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, my princess.\u201d He spoke,\nmore in a rumble. He had to be careful with his words now.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in and touch her?\u201d The\nprincess asked.</p><p>Percival threw a quick look towards\nthe hallway; no one there. He cleared his throat. \u201cAye, your highness.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a small smile before\nopening the stall door. Percival once again looked at the entrance of the\nhallway; there were two guards passing by it, but just on their normal rounds.</p><p>\u201cJust be gentle, my lady.\u201d He\nmurmured, when he saw the princess hesitating once she\u2019d actually entered.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>The princess gave him another shy\nsmile. \u201cShe is.\u201d She finally put her hand gently on Pearl\u2019s neck. \u201cWere you\nsinging to her just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is quite kind of you.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head suddenly and his\neyes found the princess\u2019s over Pearl\u2019s back. She had bluish grey eyes and\ndelicate features; it was somewhat odd to think that such a pretty and pure\ncreature could be Vortigern\u2019s daughter.</p><p>He was quick to lower his head\nagain. \u201cI do not remember you.\u201d The princess suddenly spoke. \u201cI thought there\nwas another stable-hand here at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am new, my lady.\u201d He answered,\nhoping against all hope she wouldn\u2019t ask for his name.</p><p>The sound of female voices in the\ndistance distracted the princess. She then sighed and took a step back. \u201cI\nshould go.\u201d She murmured, though she didn\u2019t owe him any satisfaction and she\nclearly didn\u2019t want to go.\u00a0</p><p>However, Percival knew very well she\ncouldn\u2019t stay there; she was a princess, he was -supposedly- a stable hand and\nthey were alone. It was hardly proper and he could get in trouble for it.</p><p>\u201cHave a good night, my lady.\u201d He\ntold her, nodding at her.</p><p>She gave him another shy smile. \u201cYou\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>As she moved away he noticed\nsomething: she was humming the same lullaby he\u2019d been humming before.</p><p>***</p><p>This was not right. Girls like Sansa\nStark should dream of heroes and chivalrous acts; they should think the world\nwas a beautiful and perfect place. She was a lady; she had a roof over her pretty\nhad, she had food on her table, she didn\u2019t need to worry about anything\u2026</p><p>Arthur wanted Sansa Stark to be a\nspoiled lady, he wanted her to think the world was a perfect place.</p><p>He hated to see the coldness in her\nvoice, the certainty in her statement. Arthur hated truly knowing what had happened\nto her. Maggie had only told them the Stark girl had been previously mistreated\nby a King; she hadn\u2019t told them how.</p><p>There was a part inside of him that\nhad wanted her to be just another sheltered lady, but she wasn\u2019t. He hated knowing\nthat.</p><p>\u201cIf there are no heroes, be your own\nhero.\u201d He told her firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t roll over and let them push you around;\nprotect yourself.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cSpoken like a man. I\ndo not expect you to understand me, but I do expect you to leave me alone.\u201d She\ngave him a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cI will, in a minute, princess.\nFirst, I want a lock of your hair.\u201d He pointed at the fiery curl that was draped\nover her shoulder.</p><p>Sansa clasped her hands over it,\nhiding it from his view. \u201cWhy?\u201d She demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe want to check something.\u201d He\ntold her. \u201cWe have a theory on why he wants you. You might not care, but I do.\u201d\nHe looked her straight in the eyes. \u201cHe is my enemy and I will do whatever it\ntakes to purge this land of him. The question is\u2026 Do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked down at the hand still\ngrasping the hair. \u201cWhat do you think he wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo sacrifice you.\u201d Arthur informed\nher. \u201cQuite literally: candles, daggers, virgin sacrifices\u2026 The whole spectacle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d She insisted.</p><p>\n\u201cThat is why I need the lock for: to understand it. Will you give it to me?\u201d He\ntook a step closer.</p><p>Sansa looked into his eyes, then\ndown at her own hand; she finally let go of her hair. \u201cIf it is just one lock\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Arthur assured her, pulling\na small dagger from his belt, Sansa was startled by the sight of it and almost\ntook a step back. \u201cIt is fine.\u201d Arthur was fast to assure her. \u201cI will not hurt\nyou.\u201d</p><p>She just nodded, eyes fixed on the\nblade. What had exactly happened to her? There was a story there that he didn\u2019t\nknow and it was driving him to distraction.</p><p>He stretched his left hand just\nenough to capture the lonely lock. The back of his finger brushed against her covered\nshoulder, and her eyes traced his movement, even though she remained silent.\nArthur\u2019s own eyes were fixed on the beautiful red of her hair, as he wrapped\nthe strands around his finger; his thumb caressed the strands, and he marveled\nat the softness.</p><p>It was as if time had paused for a\nminute, and all he could do was look at her hair, her eyes and imagine a\nthousand things. He wanted to ask questions, he wanted to be schooled in <i>her</i>, so he would know all the secrets\nbehind her eyes and her guarded words.</p><p>And the desire to know everything\nwas strong enough to scare him.

What I know is that her House is one of the oldest ones. I\nmight be remembering this wrong, but I think they were once called the Kings of\nWinter.\u201d</p><p>The Mage arched a brow and Bill\nnoticed. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d He wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOld families often have magic in\ntheir blood.\u201d She started explaining. \u201cIf the House managed to keep the\nbloodline somewhat pure\u2026\u201d She looked into the distance. \u201cShe might still have a good amount of magic\nin her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can Vortigern use it for?\u201d\nBedivere questioned.</p><p>\n\u201cMany things.\u201d The Mage shrugged. \u201cIf she is a virgin, he might even sacrifice\nher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was going to sacrifice her he\ncould have done it as soon as he got her.\u201d Back Slack indicated.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wants to wait for the\nTower to be ready.\u201d Bedivere reasoned.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe he will marry her.\u201d Bill\npointed out.</p><p>They all turned to him. \u201cHe does not\nhave an heir.\u201d The man indicated. \u201cPrincess Katia cannot assume the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could want the magic blood for\nhis heir.\u201d The Mage agreed.</p><p>\n\u201cBut again\u2026 Why hasn\u2019t he married her already?\u201d Wet Stick pushed.</p><p>\u201cShe is too young.\u201d Back Lack\nindicated. \u201cHe looked at her, saw his daughter; couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany nobles do it without thinking\nabout it.\u201d Bedivere reminded the other man.</p><p>\u201cHow many of them keep their\ndaughters inside a castle?\u201d Back Lack insisted. \u201cThe lass doesn\u2019t even have a\nbetrothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure, but it is a\npossibility.\u201d Rubio sighed.</p><p>\u201cThere is only one way to know.\u201d The\nMage concluded. \u201cI need her blood.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at her like she was\ncrazy. \u201cWhat for?\u201d Wet Stick demanded, shocked.</p><p>\u201cSo I can see if it has magic.\u201d The\nMage said as if it was obvious.</p><p>\u201cHer blood?\u201d He insisted, still a\nbit shocked.</p><p>The Mage rolled her eyes. \u201cFine.

I\u2019m the most\nindicated for this.\u201d</p><p>Bill was looking at him, an eyebrow\narched. \u201cOr you just really want to see the lady.\u201d</p><p>Arthur snorted. \u201cI never said I\ndid.\u201d</p><p>Bill scoffed. \u201cLe him go, if he\nthinks he is the best choice.\u201d The man drawled.</p><p>\u201cI do not even know why you are\npretending I have any say over this.\u201d Bedivere grumbled.</p><p>\n\u201cThat is the spirit, Bed.\u201d Arthur slapped the older man on the shoulder.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cIs this better?\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked at the handkerchief\nKatia was presenting her.</p><p>\u201cIt is much better, princess.\u201d She\ntold the other woman honestly. \u201cYou are improving greatly.\u201d</p><p>Katia\u2019s cheeks were flushed with the\npraise. \u201cIt is because you are so patient. My tutor was always snapping at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is hardly necessary.\u201d</p><p>Katia put her embroidery down.\n\u201cSansa\u2026 How was being betrothed to someone?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s hand paused on her work.\n\u201cPerhaps\u2026 I am not the best person to ask, princess.\u201d</p><p>Katia blushed furiously. \u201cI am so\nsorry! This was so unsensitive of me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is no problem, Katia.\u201d Sansa\ngave her a small smile.</p><p>Nowadays, Katia was the only person\nthat got honest smiles from Sansa. The young princess was honestly good, even\nif she occasionally had bratty moments. Sansa felt truly sorry for her, locked\naway in a castle, waiting for life to pass her by.</p><p>It was strange to feel protective of\nsomeone that was older than her. However, Katia was unbelievably na\u00efve; like Sansa\nhad been one day.</p><p>\u201cIt was a dream, at first.\u201d Sansa\nfinally replied. \u201cHe was my beautiful golden prince and I would be queen one\nday. I blinded myself to all the signs that were shoved in my face, I ignored\nmy father\u2019s advice and my own intuition\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa paused and took a deep breath,\nbefore looking at Katia. \u201cMy father said he would find someone worthy of me;\nstrong, gentle and brave. I told him I did not want that, I wanted Joffrey.\u201d\nShe shook her head at herself. \u201cI was a stupid little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for asking.\u201d Katia\nmurmured softly.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to find a knight of\nyour own.\u201d Sansa told her gently. \u201cBut your father loves you\u2026\u201d At least Sansa\nthought he did. \u201cHe is probably waiting to find the best possible match for\nyou.\u201d</p><p>Katia gave her a small smile. \u201cI\nalways wanted to fall in love.\u201d She confessed. \u201cLike in the songs you sing.\u201d</p><p>Sansa just smiled at her, because\nshe didn\u2019t have the heart to tell Katia that songs were all lies and there was\nno one gentle, brave and strong in this world.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p><p>Arthur arched a brow at Percival.\n\u201cYou offered to come.\u201d He reminded the other man dryly.</p><p>\u201cI am talking to myself.\u201d Percival\ntold him.</p><p>\u201cIf you are scared you can go, lad.\u201d\nBack Lack threw at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is a stupid idea from a strategic\npoint of view.\u201d Percival indicated. \u201cIf they catch us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t get caught.\u201d Arthur\nspoke as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cThen no problems.\u201d</p><p>Percival\u2019s expression revealed his\ncomplete lack of amusement.</p><p>\u201cNow, Back Lack.\u201d Arthur turned to\nthe man. \u201cKeep the horses ready in case we have to leave in a hurry.</p><p>\n\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d He turned to Percival. \u201cStart\nclimbing.\u201d</p><p>Percival sighed, but turned to the\noutside wall of the small keep and did was he was ordered.</p><p>They decided to get inside the place\nwithout Maggie\u2019s help, so in case they were found, nobody could implicate\nanyone of the house as accomplice.</p><p>Percival still thought it was a\nstupid idea, but he had volunteered to come. Mostly because he knew the keep.</p><p>A lot had changed in his life since\nhe\u2019d become involved with the rebels, but Percival was, actually, from a noble\nfamily; a lower, but noble nonetheless. His parents knew Maggie\u2019s family and\nthey\u2019d played together as children, including in this particular place.</p><p>It was how they all got involved\nwith the rebels. Well, not all of them, most of Maggie\u2019s family was still\npretty much in favor of the King, if nothing else for fear.</p><p>They landed by the side of the stable,\nand looked around. \u201cThe rooms used to be over there.\u201d Percival pointed for\nArthur. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have changed that.\u201d</p><p>Arthur slapped him on the shoulder.\n\u201cExcellent. You come with me, guard the entrance. If someone suspects anything,\nwhistle and I\u2019ll come down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because me whistling out of nowhere\nwon\u2019t be suspicious at all.\u201d</p><p>Arthur -as expected -just ignored\nhim again. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Percival sighed. Why was he here\nagain?</p><p>***</p><p>Sansa felt as if she was playing\nsome odd game of cat and mouse with Lady Maggie. The lady in question had been\navoiding being alone with her; she only engaged Sansa in extremely polite\nconversation and never stayed in a situation where they could have a private talk\neven among other people.</p><p>Sansa had avoided her for a while\ntoo, right after they came back from Londinium. \u00a0However, once she realized Maggie was running\nfrom her, Sansa decided to change tactics. She had no intention of talking to\nMaggie about the rebels and what had happened on Londinium, but\u2026 The other\nwoman didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>There was something there, and Sansa\nwanted to know what it was. She was tired of being a pawn and being passed from\none side to the other. She didn\u2019t know exactly what she was doing, but it was\nstill interesting to watch Maggie squirming.</p><p>She went to her chambers after\nsupper, decided to think better about the situation, but the Gods where never\nin her favor.</p><p>As soon as she opened the door she\nfound <i>him</i>, leaning against her wall,\ncasually flipping through one of the poetry books she had.</p><p>For a delirious second, she prayed\nshe had finally lost her mind, but then he raised his eyes briefly to her and\nsaid, \u201cWhat took you so long, Red?\u201d and she realized this was real.</p><p>She closed the door behind herself. \u201cWhat\nare you doing here?\u201d She demanded, her voice a hiss, wildly looking around.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I should say something\ndramatic and poetic about\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGET OUT!\u201d She almost screeched, but\nseemed to control herself at the last minute.</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nyou. You\u2019re destroying my fantasy here.\u201d He told her dryly.</p><p>\u201cYour\nfantasy?\u201d She was astounded by the nerve\u2026 \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She\ndemanded once again.</p><p>\u201cCame\nto see you.\u201d He declared simply, putting the book down on the closest flat\nsurface.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\nShe wanted to know. \u201cI already told you I have no value\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nsee\u2026\u201d He shook his finger at her. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, princess. The\nKing paid for you. You have to be valuable somehow.\u201d He looked her up and down.\n\u201cIs he visiting your chambers at night?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\ngasped. \u201cWhat? How dare you? King Vortigern treats me with respect\u2026\u201d</p><p>Arthur\nrolled his eyes. \u201cSo a few kind words are enough for you to defend a man like\nhim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d\nShe snapped. \u201cIt is! Because the previous King I lived with liked to humiliate\nme as much as possible, and -on occasion -beat me up in front of the rest of\nthe court. So forgive me, if I seek a bit of peace now.\u201d</p><p>Arthur\ntook a deep breath, and Sansa saw his hands closing on fists by his side. She\ntook a step back, suddenly a bit scared.</p><p>\u201cWhy\nis it enough?\u201d He demanded again. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be still hoping? Shouldn\u2019t you\nstill want a hero?\u201d</p><p>She\nscoffed. \u201cThere are no heroes. In this world we live in, no one can save\nanyone.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Percival tried to be as\ninconspicuous as possible, while he kept his post on the stables. From that\nposition, he could clearly see the hallway that led to the family chambers of\nthe keep. If soldiers tried to capture Arthur, they\u2019d have to go through there,\nand the Born King would have to fly to escape them.</p><p>Percival snorted; it\u2019d\nserve Arthur well if he got a scare out of this. He had no idea what the other\nman had on his mind, but this was a stupid idea, no matter how one looked at\nit.</p><p>He wondered if Arthur\nwas truly doing this just to see the girl again, but then discarded the idea as\nan absurd one. Arthur knew how important this was; he wouldn\u2019t risk anything\nfor a girl he\u2019d seen twice -once being from a distance.</p><p>While he was there\nwaiting, a stable-hand saw him and told him to check on Pearl. Percival\ncouldn\u2019t say no, so he went to check on Pearl.</p><p>Pearl turned out to be a\nsweet mare that had a love for apples and a foal on the way.</p><p>Percival knew how to\ncare for horses; even before this whole rebel thing happened, his father had\nloved horses, and insisted that Percival knew how to properly care for them. It\nwas no sacrifice for him to check Pearl\u2019s stall and sneak her an apple. Her\nstall was in a position that allowed him to keep his eyes on his real task, so\nhe decided to give her a gentle brushing.</p><p>He was humming an old\nlullaby -one his mother used to sing to them -when he heard steps. He kept what\nhe was doing, but there was a certain tension on his shoulders; these were soft\nsteps, definitely not the other stable-hand.</p><p>The steps came closer and Percival met\nthe startled eyes of Princess Katia.</p><p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d He spoke quickly,\nlowering his eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to be worried about\nbeing recognized by the princess. As previously said, he\u2019d been a lower noble,\nhardly the type that met the King or his precious daughter.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cI came\nto see Pearl. Lord Alistair said she is expecting a foal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, my princess.\u201d He spoke,\nmore in a rumble. He had to be careful with his words now.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in and touch her?\u201d The\nprincess asked.</p><p>Percival threw a quick look towards\nthe hallway; no one there. He cleared his throat. \u201cAye, your highness.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a small smile before\nopening the stall door. Percival once again looked at the entrance of the\nhallway; there were two guards passing by it, but just on their normal rounds.</p><p>\u201cJust be gentle, my lady.\u201d He\nmurmured, when he saw the princess hesitating once she\u2019d actually entered.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>The princess gave him another shy\nsmile. \u201cShe is.\u201d She finally put her hand gently on Pearl\u2019s neck. \u201cWere you\nsinging to her just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is quite kind of you.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head suddenly and his\neyes found the princess\u2019s over Pearl\u2019s back. She had bluish grey eyes and\ndelicate features; it was somewhat odd to think that such a pretty and pure\ncreature could be Vortigern\u2019s daughter.</p><p>He was quick to lower his head\nagain. \u201cI do not remember you.\u201d The princess suddenly spoke. \u201cI thought there\nwas another stable-hand here at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am new, my lady.\u201d He answered,\nhoping against all hope she wouldn\u2019t ask for his name.</p><p>The sound of female voices in the\ndistance distracted the princess. She then sighed and took a step back. \u201cI\nshould go.\u201d She murmured, though she didn\u2019t owe him any satisfaction and she\nclearly didn\u2019t want to go.\u00a0</p><p>However, Percival knew very well she\ncouldn\u2019t stay there; she was a princess, he was -supposedly- a stable hand and\nthey were alone. It was hardly proper and he could get in trouble for it.</p><p>\u201cHave a good night, my lady.\u201d He\ntold her, nodding at her.</p><p>She gave him another shy smile. \u201cYou\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>As she moved away he noticed\nsomething: she was humming the same lullaby he\u2019d been humming before.</p><p>***</p><p>This was not right. Girls like Sansa\nStark should dream of heroes and chivalrous acts; they should think the world\nwas a beautiful and perfect place. She was a lady; she had a roof over her pretty\nhad, she had food on her table, she didn\u2019t need to worry about anything\u2026</p><p>Arthur wanted Sansa Stark to be a\nspoiled lady, he wanted her to think the world was a perfect place.</p><p>He hated to see the coldness in her\nvoice, the certainty in her statement. Arthur hated truly knowing what had happened\nto her. Maggie had only told them the Stark girl had been previously mistreated\nby a King; she hadn\u2019t told them how.</p><p>There was a part inside of him that\nhad wanted her to be just another sheltered lady, but she wasn\u2019t. He hated knowing\nthat.</p><p>\u201cIf there are no heroes, be your own\nhero.\u201d He told her firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t roll over and let them push you around;\nprotect yourself.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cSpoken like a man. I\ndo not expect you to understand me, but I do expect you to leave me alone.\u201d She\ngave him a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cI will, in a minute, princess.\nFirst, I want a lock of your hair.\u201d He pointed at the fiery curl that was draped\nover her shoulder.</p><p>Sansa clasped her hands over it,\nhiding it from his view. \u201cWhy?\u201d She demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe want to check something.\u201d He\ntold her. \u201cWe have a theory on why he wants you. You might not care, but I do.\u201d\nHe looked her straight in the eyes. \u201cHe is my enemy and I will do whatever it\ntakes to purge this land of him. The question is\u2026 Do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked down at the hand still\ngrasping the hair. \u201cWhat do you think he wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo sacrifice you.\u201d Arthur informed\nher. \u201cQuite literally: candles, daggers, virgin sacrifices\u2026 The whole spectacle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d She insisted.</p><p>\n\u201cThat is why I need the lock for: to understand it. Will you give it to me?\u201d He\ntook a step closer.</p><p>Sansa looked into his eyes, then\ndown at her own hand; she finally let go of her hair. \u201cIf it is just one lock\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Arthur assured her, pulling\na small dagger from his belt, Sansa was startled by the sight of it and almost\ntook a step back. \u201cIt is fine.\u201d Arthur was fast to assure her. \u201cI will not hurt\nyou.\u201d</p><p>She just nodded, eyes fixed on the\nblade. What had exactly happened to her? There was a story there that he didn\u2019t\nknow and it was driving him to distraction.</p><p>He stretched his left hand just\nenough to capture the lonely lock. The back of his finger brushed against her covered\nshoulder, and her eyes traced his movement, even though she remained silent.\nArthur\u2019s own eyes were fixed on the beautiful red of her hair, as he wrapped\nthe strands around his finger; his thumb caressed the strands, and he marveled\nat the softness.</p><p>It was as if time had paused for a\nminute, and all he could do was look at her hair, her eyes and imagine a\nthousand things. He wanted to ask questions, he wanted to be schooled in <i>her</i>, so he would know all the secrets\nbehind her eyes and her guarded words.</p><p>And the desire to know everything\nwas strong enough to scare him. He needed to get away from her.</p><p>He raised his dagger and cut the\nlock, leaving him with fire wrapped around his finger. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d He\nfinally spoke, his voice rough, like he\u2019d just woken up.</p><p>Her eyes lingered on his hand for a\nsecond, before she once again looked in the eyes. \u201cYou should go.\u201d Her voice\nwas soft and uncertain.</p><p>Whatever had affected him, it\ncertainly had affected her as well.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Arthur waited impatiently as the\nMage chanted. They were all there, silently watching as she proclaimed words,\nlit incense and circled it over the red lock.</p><p>He wanted answers, now.</p><p>The Mage finally put the incense\ndown. \u201cThis is no good.\u201d She finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d Arthur\ndemanded.</p><p>\u201cShe is in danger, and so are we.\u201d</p><p><i><b>(NOTES: Du-du-duuuuuuh! By the way, I am really sorry for the delay.

So?\u201d Arthur asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she be here if Vortigern\ndidn\u2019t care for her?\u201d Bill pointed out. \u201cShe has to be somehow necessary. He <i>bought</i> her.\u201d</p><p>Bedivere turned to Percival. \u201cHow\nmuch did the king pay for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not know exactly.\u201d He\ninformed the others. \u201cHowever, Maggie heard rumors that go anywhere from a\nhundred to a thousand ships.\u201d</p><p>Arthur arched a brow. \u201cHe exchanged\none girl for ships?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Percival confirmed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo she thinks he does not care for\nher\u2026\u201d Bill started.</p><p>\u201cBut he must want something.\u201d\nBedivere completed.</p><p>\u201cAnd the question is\u2026 What?\u201d Bill\nfinished.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Maggie say she is the last\nof her family?\u201d Rubio interrupted. \u201cMaybe he wants her lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is it that much?\u201d Wet Stick\nthrew in. \u201cI mean, if she was the princess and all, but isn\u2019t she just the\ndaughter of someone?\u201d</p><p>That made them all quiet.</p><p>\u201cThere is another possibility.\u201d Mage\nsuddenly spoke, attracting everybody\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Arthur\nwanted to know.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know about Westeros?\u201d\nShe asked.</p><p>\n\u201cDragons.\u201d Most people around the room said at the same time.</p><p>The Mage rolled her eyes. \u201cBesides\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d Bedivere admitted. \u201cI\nremember something about Kings that married their sisters, and a great wall,\nbut not much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember the story about a wall\ntoo.\u201d Bill said, then shrugged. \u201cBut no more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said her name is Stark, right?\u201d\nRubio asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bedivere confirmed.</p><p>\u201cI used to know the name of the old\nHouses of Westeros.\u201d The boy commented. \u201cMy father liked to test me in the\nsmallest things. What I know is that her House is one of the oldest ones. I\nmight be remembering this wrong, but I think they were once called the Kings of\nWinter.\u201d</p><p>The Mage arched a brow and Bill\nnoticed. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d He wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOld families often have magic in\ntheir blood.\u201d She started explaining. \u201cIf the House managed to keep the\nbloodline somewhat pure\u2026\u201d She looked into the distance. \u201cShe might still have a good amount of magic\nin her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can Vortigern use it for?\u201d\nBedivere questioned.</p><p>\n\u201cMany things.\u201d The Mage shrugged. \u201cIf she is a virgin, he might even sacrifice\nher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was going to sacrifice her he\ncould have done it as soon as he got her.\u201d Back Slack indicated.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wants to wait for the\nTower to be ready.\u201d Bedivere reasoned.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe he will marry her.\u201d Bill\npointed out.</p><p>They all turned to him. \u201cHe does not\nhave an heir.\u201d The man indicated. \u201cPrincess Katia cannot assume the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could want the magic blood for\nhis heir.\u201d The Mage agreed.</p><p>\n\u201cBut again\u2026 Why hasn\u2019t he married her already?\u201d Wet Stick pushed.</p><p>\u201cShe is too young.\u201d Back Lack\nindicated. \u201cHe looked at her, saw his daughter; couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany nobles do it without thinking\nabout it.\u201d Bedivere reminded the other man.</p><p>\u201cHow many of them keep their\ndaughters inside a castle?\u201d Back Lack insisted. \u201cThe lass doesn\u2019t even have a\nbetrothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure, but it is a\npossibility.\u201d Rubio sighed.</p><p>\u201cThere is only one way to know.\u201d The\nMage concluded. \u201cI need her blood.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at her like she was\ncrazy. \u201cWhat for?\u201d Wet Stick demanded, shocked.</p><p>\u201cSo I can see if it has magic.\u201d The\nMage said as if it was obvious.</p><p>\u201cHer blood?\u201d He insisted, still a\nbit shocked.</p><p>The Mage rolled her eyes. \u201cFine. A\nlock of hair will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have started with that.\u201d\nBack Lack pointed out dryly.</p><p>\u201cBlood would be better.\u201d The Mage\nsimply said.</p><p>\u201cBut even if it is just the hair\u2026\nHow are we going to get it?\u201d Percival asked.</p><p>\n\u201cI will get it.\u201d Arthur suddenly said.</p><p>He\u2019d been quiet this whole time,\nlistening to this conversation and the theories being thrown around.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d Back Lack\nasked.</p><p>\n\u201cI will go and get it.\u201d Arthur repeated firmly.</p><p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d Bill wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cIt is too risky.\u201d Bedivere was\nalready shaking his head. \u201cYou cannot go\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Bedivere.\u201d Arthur brushed\noff his protests. \u201cI can be in and out before anyone notices. I\u2019m the most\nindicated for this.\u201d</p><p>Bill was looking at him, an eyebrow\narched. \u201cOr you just really want to see the lady.\u201d</p><p>Arthur snorted. \u201cI never said I\ndid.\u201d</p><p>Bill scoffed. \u201cLe him go, if he\nthinks he is the best choice.\u201d The man drawled.</p><p>\u201cI do not even know why you are\npretending I have any say over this.\u201d Bedivere grumbled.</p><p>\n\u201cThat is the spirit, Bed.\u201d Arthur slapped the older man on the shoulder.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cIs this better?\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked at the handkerchief\nKatia was presenting her.</p><p>\u201cIt is much better, princess.\u201d She\ntold the other woman honestly. \u201cYou are improving greatly.\u201d</p><p>Katia\u2019s cheeks were flushed with the\npraise. \u201cIt is because you are so patient. My tutor was always snapping at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is hardly necessary.\u201d</p><p>Katia put her embroidery down.\n\u201cSansa\u2026 How was being betrothed to someone?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s hand paused on her work.\n\u201cPerhaps\u2026 I am not the best person to ask, princess.\u201d</p><p>Katia blushed furiously. \u201cI am so\nsorry! This was so unsensitive of me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is no problem, Katia.\u201d Sansa\ngave her a small smile.</p><p>Nowadays, Katia was the only person\nthat got honest smiles from Sansa. The young princess was honestly good, even\nif she occasionally had bratty moments. Sansa felt truly sorry for her, locked\naway in a castle, waiting for life to pass her by.</p><p>It was strange to feel protective of\nsomeone that was older than her. However, Katia was unbelievably na\u00efve; like Sansa\nhad been one day.</p><p>\u201cIt was a dream, at first.\u201d Sansa\nfinally replied. \u201cHe was my beautiful golden prince and I would be queen one\nday. I blinded myself to all the signs that were shoved in my face, I ignored\nmy father\u2019s advice and my own intuition\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa paused and took a deep breath,\nbefore looking at Katia. \u201cMy father said he would find someone worthy of me;\nstrong, gentle and brave. I told him I did not want that, I wanted Joffrey.\u201d\nShe shook her head at herself. \u201cI was a stupid little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for asking.\u201d Katia\nmurmured softly.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to find a knight of\nyour own.\u201d Sansa told her gently. \u201cBut your father loves you\u2026\u201d At least Sansa\nthought he did. \u201cHe is probably waiting to find the best possible match for\nyou.\u201d</p><p>Katia gave her a small smile. \u201cI\nalways wanted to fall in love.\u201d She confessed. \u201cLike in the songs you sing.\u201d</p><p>Sansa just smiled at her, because\nshe didn\u2019t have the heart to tell Katia that songs were all lies and there was\nno one gentle, brave and strong in this world.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p><p>Arthur arched a brow at Percival.\n\u201cYou offered to come.\u201d He reminded the other man dryly.</p><p>\u201cI am talking to myself.\u201d Percival\ntold him.</p><p>\u201cIf you are scared you can go, lad.\u201d\nBack Lack threw at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is a stupid idea from a strategic\npoint of view.\u201d Percival indicated. \u201cIf they catch us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t get caught.\u201d Arthur\nspoke as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cThen no problems.\u201d</p><p>Percival\u2019s expression revealed his\ncomplete lack of amusement.</p><p>\u201cNow, Back Lack.\u201d Arthur turned to\nthe man. \u201cKeep the horses ready in case we have to leave in a hurry.</p><p>\n\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d He turned to Percival. \u201cStart\nclimbing.\u201d</p><p>Percival sighed, but turned to the\noutside wall of the small keep and did was he was ordered.</p><p>They decided to get inside the place\nwithout Maggie\u2019s help, so in case they were found, nobody could implicate\nanyone of the house as accomplice.</p><p>Percival still thought it was a\nstupid idea, but he had volunteered to come. Mostly because he knew the keep.</p><p>A lot had changed in his life since\nhe\u2019d become involved with the rebels, but Percival was, actually, from a noble\nfamily; a lower, but noble nonetheless. His parents knew Maggie\u2019s family and\nthey\u2019d played together as children, including in this particular place.</p><p>It was how they all got involved\nwith the rebels. Well, not all of them, most of Maggie\u2019s family was still\npretty much in favor of the King, if nothing else for fear.</p><p>They landed by the side of the stable,\nand looked around. \u201cThe rooms used to be over there.\u201d Percival pointed for\nArthur. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have changed that.\u201d</p><p>Arthur slapped him on the shoulder.\n\u201cExcellent. You come with me, guard the entrance. If someone suspects anything,\nwhistle and I\u2019ll come down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because me whistling out of nowhere\nwon\u2019t be suspicious at all.\u201d</p><p>Arthur -as expected -just ignored\nhim again. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Percival sighed. Why was he here\nagain?</p><p>***</p><p>Sansa felt as if she was playing\nsome odd game of cat and mouse with Lady Maggie. The lady in question had been\navoiding being alone with her; she only engaged Sansa in extremely polite\nconversation and never stayed in a situation where they could have a private talk\neven among other people.</p><p>Sansa had avoided her for a while\ntoo, right after they came back from Londinium. \u00a0However, once she realized Maggie was running\nfrom her, Sansa decided to change tactics. She had no intention of talking to\nMaggie about the rebels and what had happened on Londinium, but\u2026 The other\nwoman didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>There was something there, and Sansa\nwanted to know what it was. She was tired of being a pawn and being passed from\none side to the other. She didn\u2019t know exactly what she was doing, but it was\nstill interesting to watch Maggie squirming.</p><p>She went to her chambers after\nsupper, decided to think better about the situation, but the Gods where never\nin her favor.</p><p>As soon as she opened the door she\nfound <i>him</i>, leaning against her wall,\ncasually flipping through one of the poetry books she had.</p><p>For a delirious second, she prayed\nshe had finally lost her mind, but then he raised his eyes briefly to her and\nsaid, \u201cWhat took you so long, Red?\u201d and she realized this was real.</p><p>She closed the door behind herself. \u201cWhat\nare you doing here?\u201d She demanded, her voice a hiss, wildly looking around.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I should say something\ndramatic and poetic about\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGET OUT!\u201d She almost screeched, but\nseemed to control herself at the last minute.</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nyou. You\u2019re destroying my fantasy here.\u201d He told her dryly.</p><p>\u201cYour\nfantasy?\u201d She was astounded by the nerve\u2026 \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She\ndemanded once again.</p><p>\u201cCame\nto see you.\u201d He declared simply, putting the book down on the closest flat\nsurface.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\nShe wanted to know. \u201cI already told you I have no value\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nsee\u2026\u201d He shook his finger at her. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, princess. The\nKing paid for you. You have to be valuable somehow.\u201d He looked her up and down.\n\u201cIs he visiting your chambers at night?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\ngasped. \u201cWhat? How dare you? King Vortigern treats me with respect\u2026\u201d</p><p>Arthur\nrolled his eyes. \u201cSo a few kind words are enough for you to defend a man like\nhim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d\nShe snapped. \u201cIt is! Because the previous King I lived with liked to humiliate\nme as much as possible, and -on occasion -beat me up in front of the rest of\nthe court. So forgive me, if I seek a bit of peace now.\u201d</p><p>Arthur\ntook a deep breath, and Sansa saw his hands closing on fists by his side. She\ntook a step back, suddenly a bit scared.</p><p>\u201cWhy\nis it enough?\u201d He demanded again. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be still hoping? Shouldn\u2019t you\nstill want a hero?\u201d</p><p>She\nscoffed. \u201cThere are no heroes. In this world we live in, no one can save\nanyone.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Percival tried to be as\ninconspicuous as possible, while he kept his post on the stables. From that\nposition, he could clearly see the hallway that led to the family chambers of\nthe keep. If soldiers tried to capture Arthur, they\u2019d have to go through there,\nand the Born King would have to fly to escape them.</p><p>Percival snorted; it\u2019d\nserve Arthur well if he got a scare out of this. He had no idea what the other\nman had on his mind, but this was a stupid idea, no matter how one looked at\nit.</p><p>He wondered if Arthur\nwas truly doing this just to see the girl again, but then discarded the idea as\nan absurd one. Arthur knew how important this was; he wouldn\u2019t risk anything\nfor a girl he\u2019d seen twice -once being from a distance.</p><p>While he was there\nwaiting, a stable-hand saw him and told him to check on Pearl. Percival\ncouldn\u2019t say no, so he went to check on Pearl.</p><p>Pearl turned out to be a\nsweet mare that had a love for apples and a foal on the way.</p><p>Percival knew how to\ncare for horses; even before this whole rebel thing happened, his father had\nloved horses, and insisted that Percival knew how to properly care for them. It\nwas no sacrifice for him to check Pearl\u2019s stall and sneak her an apple. Her\nstall was in a position that allowed him to keep his eyes on his real task, so\nhe decided to give her a gentle brushing.</p><p>He was humming an old\nlullaby -one his mother used to sing to them -when he heard steps. He kept what\nhe was doing, but there was a certain tension on his shoulders; these were soft\nsteps, definitely not the other stable-hand.</p><p>The steps came closer and Percival met\nthe startled eyes of Princess Katia.</p><p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d He spoke quickly,\nlowering his eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to be worried about\nbeing recognized by the princess. As previously said, he\u2019d been a lower noble,\nhardly the type that met the King or his precious daughter.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cI came\nto see Pearl. Lord Alistair said she is expecting a foal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, my princess.\u201d He spoke,\nmore in a rumble. He had to be careful with his words now.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in and touch her?\u201d The\nprincess asked.</p><p>Percival threw a quick look towards\nthe hallway; no one there. He cleared his throat. \u201cAye, your highness.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a small smile before\nopening the stall door. Percival once again looked at the entrance of the\nhallway; there were two guards passing by it, but just on their normal rounds.</p><p>\u201cJust be gentle, my lady.\u201d He\nmurmured, when he saw the princess hesitating once she\u2019d actually entered.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>The princess gave him another shy\nsmile. \u201cShe is.\u201d She finally put her hand gently on Pearl\u2019s neck. \u201cWere you\nsinging to her just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is quite kind of you.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head suddenly and his\neyes found the princess\u2019s over Pearl\u2019s back. She had bluish grey eyes and\ndelicate features; it was somewhat odd to think that such a pretty and pure\ncreature could be Vortigern\u2019s daughter.</p><p>He was quick to lower his head\nagain. \u201cI do not remember you.\u201d The princess suddenly spoke. \u201cI thought there\nwas another stable-hand here at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am new, my lady.\u201d He answered,\nhoping against all hope she wouldn\u2019t ask for his name.</p><p>The sound of female voices in the\ndistance distracted the princess. She then sighed and took a step back. \u201cI\nshould go.\u201d She murmured, though she didn\u2019t owe him any satisfaction and she\nclearly didn\u2019t want to go.\u00a0</p><p>However, Percival knew very well she\ncouldn\u2019t stay there; she was a princess, he was -supposedly- a stable hand and\nthey were alone. It was hardly proper and he could get in trouble for it.</p><p>\u201cHave a good night, my lady.\u201d He\ntold her, nodding at her.</p><p>She gave him another shy smile. \u201cYou\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>As she moved away he noticed\nsomething: she was humming the same lullaby he\u2019d been humming before.</p><p>***</p><p>This was not right. Girls like Sansa\nStark should dream of heroes and chivalrous acts; they should think the world\nwas a beautiful and perfect place. She was a lady; she had a roof over her pretty\nhad, she had food on her table, she didn\u2019t need to worry about anything\u2026</p><p>Arthur wanted Sansa Stark to be a\nspoiled lady, he wanted her to think the world was a perfect place.</p><p>He hated to see the coldness in her\nvoice, the certainty in her statement. Arthur hated truly knowing what had happened\nto her. Maggie had only told them the Stark girl had been previously mistreated\nby a King; she hadn\u2019t told them how.</p><p>There was a part inside of him that\nhad wanted her to be just another sheltered lady, but she wasn\u2019t. He hated knowing\nthat.</p><p>\u201cIf there are no heroes, be your own\nhero.\u201d He told her firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t roll over and let them push you around;\nprotect yourself.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cSpoken like a man. I\ndo not expect you to understand me, but I do expect you to leave me alone.\u201d She\ngave him a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cI will, in a minute, princess.\nFirst, I want a lock of your hair.\u201d He pointed at the fiery curl that was draped\nover her shoulder.</p><p>Sansa clasped her hands over it,\nhiding it from his view. \u201cWhy?\u201d She demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe want to check something.\u201d He\ntold her. \u201cWe have a theory on why he wants you. You might not care, but I do.\u201d\nHe looked her straight in the eyes. \u201cHe is my enemy and I will do whatever it\ntakes to purge this land of him. The question is\u2026 Do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked down at the hand still\ngrasping the hair. \u201cWhat do you think he wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo sacrifice you.\u201d Arthur informed\nher. \u201cQuite literally: candles, daggers, virgin sacrifices\u2026 The whole spectacle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d She insisted.</p><p>\n\u201cThat is why I need the lock for: to understand it. Will you give it to me?\u201d He\ntook a step closer.</p><p>Sansa looked into his eyes, then\ndown at her own hand; she finally let go of her hair. \u201cIf it is just one lock\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Arthur assured her, pulling\na small dagger from his belt, Sansa was startled by the sight of it and almost\ntook a step back. \u201cIt is fine.\u201d Arthur was fast to assure her. \u201cI will not hurt\nyou.\u201d</p><p>She just nodded, eyes fixed on the\nblade. What had exactly happened to her? There was a story there that he didn\u2019t\nknow and it was driving him to distraction.</p><p>He stretched his left hand just\nenough to capture the lonely lock. The back of his finger brushed against her covered\nshoulder, and her eyes traced his movement, even though she remained silent.\nArthur\u2019s own eyes were fixed on the beautiful red of her hair, as he wrapped\nthe strands around his finger; his thumb caressed the strands, and he marveled\nat the softness.</p><p>It was as if time had paused for a\nminute, and all he could do was look at her hair, her eyes and imagine a\nthousand things. He wanted to ask questions, he wanted to be schooled in <i>her</i>, so he would know all the secrets\nbehind her eyes and her guarded words.</p><p>And the desire to know everything\nwas strong enough to scare him. He needed to get away from her.</p><p>He raised his dagger and cut the\nlock, leaving him with fire wrapped around his finger. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d He\nfinally spoke, his voice rough, like he\u2019d just woken up.</p><p>Her eyes lingered on his hand for a\nsecond, before she once again looked in the eyes. \u201cYou should go.\u201d Her voice\nwas soft and uncertain.</p><p>Whatever had affected him, it\ncertainly had affected her as well.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Arthur waited impatiently as the\nMage chanted. They were all there, silently watching as she proclaimed words,\nlit incense and circled it over the red lock.</p><p>He wanted answers, now.</p><p>The Mage finally put the incense\ndown. \u201cThis is no good.\u201d She finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d Arthur\ndemanded.</p><p>\u201cShe is in danger, and so are we.\u201d</p><p><i><b>(NOTES: Du-du-duuuuuuh! By the way, I am really sorry for the delay.

                "content": "<p><b>Chapter 4</b></p><p>&ldquo;You are quiet.&rdquo; Bedivere spoke\nsuddenly, making everybody look at him, until they noticed he was looking at Bill.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip; I was thinking about something\nArthur said.&rdquo; He explained.</p><p>&ldquo;What exactly?&rdquo; Bedivere wanted to\nknow.</p><p>&ldquo;Arthur said that Lady Sansa claimed\nthe king would not care if she was hurt.&rdquo; He looked at Arthur. &ldquo;Correct?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. So?&rdquo; Arthur asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would she be here if Vortigern\ndidn&rsquo;t care for her?&rdquo; Bill pointed out. &ldquo;She has to be somehow necessary. He <i>bought</i> her.&rdquo;</p><p>Bedivere turned to Percival. &ldquo;How\nmuch did the king pay for her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We do not know exactly.&rdquo; He\ninformed the others. &ldquo;However, Maggie heard rumors that go anywhere from a\nhundred to a thousand ships.&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur arched a brow. &ldquo;He exchanged\none girl for ships?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Percival confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So she thinks he does not care for\nher&hellip;&rdquo; Bill started.</p><p>&ldquo;But he must want something.&rdquo;\nBedivere completed.</p><p>&ldquo;And the question is&hellip; What?&rdquo; Bill\nfinished.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Maggie say she is the last\nof her family?&rdquo; Rubio interrupted. &ldquo;Maybe he wants her lands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But is it that much?&rdquo; Wet Stick\nthrew in. &ldquo;I mean, if she was the princess and all, but isn&rsquo;t she just the\ndaughter of someone?&rdquo;</p><p>That made them all quiet.</p><p>&ldquo;There is another possibility.&rdquo; Mage\nsuddenly spoke, attracting everybody&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you thinking?&rdquo; Arthur\nwanted to know.</p><p>&ldquo;What do we know about Westeros?&rdquo;\nShe asked.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Dragons.&rdquo; Most people around the room said at the same time.</p><p>The Mage rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Besides\nthat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo; Bedivere admitted. &ldquo;I\nremember something about Kings that married their sisters, and a great wall,\nbut not much more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I remember the story about a wall\ntoo.&rdquo; Bill said, then shrugged. &ldquo;But no more than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You said her name is Stark, right?&rdquo;\nRubio asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Bedivere confirmed.</p><p>&ldquo;I used to know the name of the old\nHouses of Westeros.&rdquo; The boy commented. &ldquo;My father liked to test me in the\nsmallest things. What I know is that her House is one of the oldest ones. I\nmight be remembering this wrong, but I think they were once called the Kings of\nWinter.&rdquo;</p><p>The Mage arched a brow and Bill\nnoticed. &ldquo;What are you thinking?&rdquo; He wanted to know.</p><p>&ldquo;Old families often have magic in\ntheir blood.&rdquo; She started explaining. &ldquo;If the House managed to keep the\nbloodline somewhat pure&hellip;&rdquo; She looked into the distance. &ldquo;She might still have a good amount of magic\nin her blood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can Vortigern use it for?&rdquo;\nBedivere questioned.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Many things.&rdquo; The Mage shrugged. &ldquo;If she is a virgin, he might even sacrifice\nher.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he was going to sacrifice her he\ncould have done it as soon as he got her.&rdquo; Back Slack indicated.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe he wants to wait for the\nTower to be ready.&rdquo; Bedivere reasoned.</p><p>&ldquo;Or maybe he will marry her.&rdquo; Bill\npointed out.</p><p>They all turned to him. &ldquo;He does not\nhave an heir.&rdquo; The man indicated. &ldquo;Princess Katia cannot assume the throne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He could want the magic blood for\nhis heir.&rdquo; The Mage agreed.</p><p>\n&ldquo;But again&hellip; Why hasn&rsquo;t he married her already?&rdquo; Wet Stick pushed.</p><p>&ldquo;She is too young.&rdquo; Back Lack\nindicated. &ldquo;He looked at her, saw his daughter; couldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Many nobles do it without thinking\nabout it.&rdquo; Bedivere reminded the other man.</p><p>&ldquo;How many of them keep their\ndaughters inside a castle?&rdquo; Back Lack insisted. &ldquo;The lass doesn&rsquo;t even have a\nbetrothed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know for sure, but it is a\npossibility.&rdquo; Rubio sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;There is only one way to know.&rdquo; The\nMage concluded. &ldquo;I need her blood.&rdquo;</p><p>They all looked at her like she was\ncrazy. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Wet Stick demanded, shocked.</p><p>&ldquo;So I can see if it has magic.&rdquo; The\nMage said as if it was obvious.</p><p>&ldquo;Her blood?&rdquo; He insisted, still a\nbit shocked.</p><p>The Mage rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Fine. A\nlock of hair will do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could have started with that.&rdquo;\nBack Lack pointed out dryly.</p><p>&ldquo;Blood would be better.&rdquo; The Mage\nsimply said.</p><p>&ldquo;But even if it is just the hair&hellip;\nHow are we going to get it?&rdquo; Percival asked.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I will get it.&rdquo; Arthur suddenly said.</p><p>He&rsquo;d been quiet this whole time,\nlistening to this conversation and the theories being thrown around.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo; Back Lack\nasked.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I will go and get it.&rdquo; Arthur repeated firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why you?&rdquo; Bill wanted to know.</p><p>&ldquo;It is too risky.&rdquo; Bedivere was\nalready shaking his head. &ldquo;You cannot go&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever, Bedivere.&rdquo; Arthur brushed\noff his protests. &ldquo;I can be in and out before anyone notices. I&rsquo;m the most\nindicated for this.&rdquo;</p><p>Bill was looking at him, an eyebrow\narched. &ldquo;Or you just really want to see the lady.&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur snorted. &ldquo;I never said I\ndid.&rdquo;</p><p>Bill scoffed. &ldquo;Le him go, if he\nthinks he is the best choice.&rdquo; The man drawled.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not even know why you are\npretending I have any say over this.&rdquo; Bedivere grumbled.</p><p>\n&ldquo;That is the spirit, Bed.&rdquo; Arthur slapped the older man on the shoulder.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Is this better?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa looked at the handkerchief\nKatia was presenting her.</p><p>&ldquo;It is much better, princess.&rdquo; She\ntold the other woman honestly. &ldquo;You are improving greatly.&rdquo;</p><p>Katia&rsquo;s cheeks were flushed with the\npraise. &ldquo;It is because you are so patient. My tutor was always snapping at me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is hardly necessary.&rdquo;</p><p>Katia put her embroidery down.\n&ldquo;Sansa&hellip; How was being betrothed to someone?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s hand paused on her work.\n&ldquo;Perhaps&hellip; I am not the best person to ask, princess.&rdquo;</p><p>Katia blushed furiously. &ldquo;I am so\nsorry! This was so unsensitive of me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is no problem, Katia.&rdquo; Sansa\ngave her a small smile.</p><p>Nowadays, Katia was the only person\nthat got honest smiles from Sansa. The young princess was honestly good, even\nif she occasionally had bratty moments. Sansa felt truly sorry for her, locked\naway in a castle, waiting for life to pass her by.</p><p>It was strange to feel protective of\nsomeone that was older than her. However, Katia was unbelievably na&iuml;ve; like Sansa\nhad been one day.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a dream, at first.&rdquo; Sansa\nfinally replied. &ldquo;He was my beautiful golden prince and I would be queen one\nday. I blinded myself to all the signs that were shoved in my face, I ignored\nmy father&rsquo;s advice and my own intuition&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa paused and took a deep breath,\nbefore looking at Katia. &ldquo;My father said he would find someone worthy of me;\nstrong, gentle and brave. I told him I did not want that, I wanted Joffrey.&rdquo;\nShe shook her head at herself. &ldquo;I was a stupid little girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry for asking.&rdquo; Katia\nmurmured softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you want to find a knight of\nyour own.&rdquo; Sansa told her gently. &ldquo;But your father loves you&hellip;&rdquo; At least Sansa\nthought he did. &ldquo;He is probably waiting to find the best possible match for\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>Katia gave her a small smile. &ldquo;I\nalways wanted to fall in love.&rdquo; She confessed. &ldquo;Like in the songs you sing.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa just smiled at her, because\nshe didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell Katia that songs were all lies and there was\nno one gentle, brave and strong in this world.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Why am I here?&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur arched a brow at Percival.\n&ldquo;You offered to come.&rdquo; He reminded the other man dryly.</p><p>&ldquo;I am talking to myself.&rdquo; Percival\ntold him.</p><p>&ldquo;If you are scared you can go, lad.&rdquo;\nBack Lack threw at him.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a stupid idea from a strategic\npoint of view.&rdquo; Percival indicated. &ldquo;If they catch us&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So we don&rsquo;t get caught.&rdquo; Arthur\nspoke as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. &ldquo;Then no problems.&rdquo;</p><p>Percival&rsquo;s expression revealed his\ncomplete lack of amusement.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, Back Lack.&rdquo; Arthur turned to\nthe man. &ldquo;Keep the horses ready in case we have to leave in a hurry.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Will do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; He turned to Percival. &ldquo;Start\nclimbing.&rdquo;</p><p>Percival sighed, but turned to the\noutside wall of the small keep and did was he was ordered.</p><p>They decided to get inside the place\nwithout Maggie&rsquo;s help, so in case they were found, nobody could implicate\nanyone of the house as accomplice.</p><p>Percival still thought it was a\nstupid idea, but he had volunteered to come. Mostly because he knew the keep.</p><p>A lot had changed in his life since\nhe&rsquo;d become involved with the rebels, but Percival was, actually, from a noble\nfamily; a lower, but noble nonetheless. His parents knew Maggie&rsquo;s family and\nthey&rsquo;d played together as children, including in this particular place.</p><p>It was how they all got involved\nwith the rebels. Well, not all of them, most of Maggie&rsquo;s family was still\npretty much in favor of the King, if nothing else for fear.</p><p>They landed by the side of the stable,\nand looked around. &ldquo;The rooms used to be over there.&rdquo; Percival pointed for\nArthur. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they have changed that.&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur slapped him on the shoulder.\n&ldquo;Excellent. You come with me, guard the entrance. If someone suspects anything,\nwhistle and I&rsquo;ll come down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, because me whistling out of nowhere\nwon&rsquo;t be suspicious at all.&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur -as expected -just ignored\nhim again. &ldquo;Wait here. I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p><p>Percival sighed. Why was he here\nagain?</p><p>***</p><p>Sansa felt as if she was playing\nsome odd game of cat and mouse with Lady Maggie. The lady in question had been\navoiding being alone with her; she only engaged Sansa in extremely polite\nconversation and never stayed in a situation where they could have a private talk\neven among other people.</p><p>Sansa had avoided her for a while\ntoo, right after they came back from Londinium. &nbsp;However, once she realized Maggie was running\nfrom her, Sansa decided to change tactics. She had no intention of talking to\nMaggie about the rebels and what had happened on Londinium, but&hellip; The other\nwoman didn&rsquo;t need to know that.</p><p>There was something there, and Sansa\nwanted to know what it was. She was tired of being a pawn and being passed from\none side to the other. She didn&rsquo;t know exactly what she was doing, but it was\nstill interesting to watch Maggie squirming.</p><p>She went to her chambers after\nsupper, decided to think better about the situation, but the Gods where never\nin her favor.</p><p>As soon as she opened the door she\nfound <i>him</i>, leaning against her wall,\ncasually flipping through one of the poetry books she had.</p><p>For a delirious second, she prayed\nshe had finally lost her mind, but then he raised his eyes briefly to her and\nsaid, &ldquo;What took you so long, Red?&rdquo; and she realized this was real.</p><p>She closed the door behind herself. &ldquo;What\nare you doing here?&rdquo; She demanded, her voice a hiss, wildly looking around.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like I should say something\ndramatic and poetic about&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;GET OUT!&rdquo; She almost screeched, but\nseemed to control herself at the last minute.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse\nyou. You&rsquo;re destroying my fantasy here.&rdquo; He told her dryly.</p><p>&ldquo;Your\nfantasy?&rdquo; She was astounded by the nerve&hellip; &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; She\ndemanded once again.</p><p>&ldquo;Came\nto see you.&rdquo; He declared simply, putting the book down on the closest flat\nsurface.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;\nShe wanted to know. &ldquo;I already told you I have no value&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nsee&hellip;&rdquo; He shook his finger at her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong, princess. The\nKing paid for you. You have to be valuable somehow.&rdquo; He looked her up and down.\n&ldquo;Is he visiting your chambers at night?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa\ngasped. &ldquo;What? How dare you? King Vortigern treats me with respect&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur\nrolled his eyes. &ldquo;So a few kind words are enough for you to defend a man like\nhim?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;\nShe snapped. &ldquo;It is! Because the previous King I lived with liked to humiliate\nme as much as possible, and -on occasion -beat me up in front of the rest of\nthe court. So forgive me, if I seek a bit of peace now.&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur\ntook a deep breath, and Sansa saw his hands closing on fists by his side. She\ntook a step back, suddenly a bit scared.</p><p>&ldquo;Why\nis it enough?&rdquo; He demanded again. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be still hoping? Shouldn&rsquo;t you\nstill want a hero?&rdquo;</p><p>She\nscoffed. &ldquo;There are no heroes. In this world we live in, no one can save\nanyone.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Percival tried to be as\ninconspicuous as possible, while he kept his post on the stables. From that\nposition, he could clearly see the hallway that led to the family chambers of\nthe keep. If soldiers tried to capture Arthur, they&rsquo;d have to go through there,\nand the Born King would have to fly to escape them.</p><p>Percival snorted; it&rsquo;d\nserve Arthur well if he got a scare out of this. He had no idea what the other\nman had on his mind, but this was a stupid idea, no matter how one looked at\nit.</p><p>He wondered if Arthur\nwas truly doing this just to see the girl again, but then discarded the idea as\nan absurd one. Arthur knew how important this was; he wouldn&rsquo;t risk anything\nfor a girl he&rsquo;d seen twice -once being from a distance.</p><p>While he was there\nwaiting, a stable-hand saw him and told him to check on Pearl. Percival\ncouldn&rsquo;t say no, so he went to check on Pearl.</p><p>Pearl turned out to be a\nsweet mare that had a love for apples and a foal on the way.</p><p>Percival knew how to\ncare for horses; even before this whole rebel thing happened, his father had\nloved horses, and insisted that Percival knew how to properly care for them. It\nwas no sacrifice for him to check Pearl&rsquo;s stall and sneak her an apple. Her\nstall was in a position that allowed him to keep his eyes on his real task, so\nhe decided to give her a gentle brushing.</p><p>He was humming an old\nlullaby -one his mother used to sing to them -when he heard steps. He kept what\nhe was doing, but there was a certain tension on his shoulders; these were soft\nsteps, definitely not the other stable-hand.</p><p>The steps came closer and Percival met\nthe startled eyes of Princess Katia.</p><p>&ldquo;Your Highness.&rdquo; He spoke quickly,\nlowering his eyes.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t need to be worried about\nbeing recognized by the princess. As previously said, he&rsquo;d been a lower noble,\nhardly the type that met the King or his precious daughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; She spoke softly. &ldquo;I came\nto see Pearl. Lord Alistair said she is expecting a foal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is, my princess.&rdquo; He spoke,\nmore in a rumble. He had to be careful with his words now.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I come in and touch her?&rdquo; The\nprincess asked.</p><p>Percival threw a quick look towards\nthe hallway; no one there. He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Aye, your highness.&rdquo;</p><p>She gave him a small smile before\nopening the stall door. Percival once again looked at the entrance of the\nhallway; there were two guards passing by it, but just on their normal rounds.</p><p>&ldquo;Just be gentle, my lady.&rdquo; He\nmurmured, when he saw the princess hesitating once she&rsquo;d actually entered.\n&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a sweet girl.&rdquo;</p><p>The princess gave him another shy\nsmile. &ldquo;She is.&rdquo; She finally put her hand gently on Pearl&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Were you\nsinging to her just now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is quite kind of you.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his head suddenly and his\neyes found the princess&rsquo;s over Pearl&rsquo;s back. She had bluish grey eyes and\ndelicate features; it was somewhat odd to think that such a pretty and pure\ncreature could be Vortigern&rsquo;s daughter.</p><p>He was quick to lower his head\nagain. &ldquo;I do not remember you.&rdquo; The princess suddenly spoke. &ldquo;I thought there\nwas another stable-hand here at this time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am new, my lady.&rdquo; He answered,\nhoping against all hope she wouldn&rsquo;t ask for his name.</p><p>The sound of female voices in the\ndistance distracted the princess. She then sighed and took a step back. &ldquo;I\nshould go.&rdquo; She murmured, though she didn&rsquo;t owe him any satisfaction and she\nclearly didn&rsquo;t want to go.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Percival knew very well she\ncouldn&rsquo;t stay there; she was a princess, he was -supposedly- a stable hand and\nthey were alone. It was hardly proper and he could get in trouble for it.</p><p>&ldquo;Have a good night, my lady.&rdquo; He\ntold her, nodding at her.</p><p>She gave him another shy smile. &ldquo;You\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>As she moved away he noticed\nsomething: she was humming the same lullaby he&rsquo;d been humming before.</p><p>***</p><p>This was not right. Girls like Sansa\nStark should dream of heroes and chivalrous acts; they should think the world\nwas a beautiful and perfect place. She was a lady; she had a roof over her pretty\nhad, she had food on her table, she didn&rsquo;t need to worry about anything&hellip;</p><p>Arthur wanted Sansa Stark to be a\nspoiled lady, he wanted her to think the world was a perfect place.</p><p>He hated to see the coldness in her\nvoice, the certainty in her statement.

The question is&hellip; Do you want to know?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa looked down at the hand still\ngrasping the hair. &ldquo;What do you think he wants?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To sacrifice you.&rdquo; Arthur informed\nher. &ldquo;Quite literally: candles, daggers, virgin sacrifices&hellip; The whole spectacle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; She insisted.</p><p>\n&ldquo;That is why I need the lock for: to understand it. Will you give it to me?&rdquo; He\ntook a step closer.</p><p>Sansa looked into his eyes, then\ndown at her own hand; she finally let go of her hair. &ldquo;If it is just one lock&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Arthur assured her, pulling\na small dagger from his belt, Sansa was startled by the sight of it and almost\ntook a step back. &ldquo;It is fine.&rdquo; Arthur was fast to assure her. &ldquo;I will not hurt\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>She just nodded, eyes fixed on the\nblade. What had exactly happened to her? There was a story there that he didn&rsquo;t\nknow and it was driving him to distraction.</p><p>He stretched his left hand just\nenough to capture the lonely lock. The back of his finger brushed against her covered\nshoulder, and her eyes traced his movement, even though she remained silent.\nArthur&rsquo;s own eyes were fixed on the beautiful red of her hair, as he wrapped\nthe strands around his finger; his thumb caressed the strands, and he marveled\nat the softness.</p><p>It was as if time had paused for a\nminute, and all he could do was look at her hair, her eyes and imagine a\nthousand things. He wanted to ask questions, he wanted to be schooled in <i>her</i>, so he would know all the secrets\nbehind her eyes and her guarded words.</p><p>And the desire to know everything\nwas strong enough to scare him. He needed to get away from her.</p><p>He raised his dagger and cut the\nlock, leaving him with fire wrapped around his finger. &ldquo;Thank you, my lady.&rdquo; He\nfinally spoke, his voice rough, like he&rsquo;d just woken up.</p><p>Her eyes lingered on his hand for a\nsecond, before she once again looked in the eyes. &ldquo;You should go.&rdquo; Her voice\nwas soft and uncertain.</p><p>Whatever had affected him, it\ncertainly had affected her as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my lady.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Arthur waited impatiently as the\nMage chanted. They were all there, silently watching as she proclaimed words,\nlit incense and circled it over the red lock.</p><p>He wanted answers, now.</p><p>The Mage finally put the incense\ndown. &ldquo;This is no good.&rdquo; She finally spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? What happened?&rdquo; Arthur\ndemanded.</p><p>&ldquo;She is in danger, and so are we.&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>(NOTES: Du-du-duuuuuuh! By the way, I am really sorry for the delay.

He loved her more than he could bear. He loved her more than he would admit and could admit. Every time he looked at her, his heart skipped a beat.

Every time he was with her, he forgot the rest of the underworld, the heavy weight on his shoulders, the calling of his duties.</p><p>And she loved him too. But despite her love for him, there was a certain unhappiness in her eyes, in her voice, in the way she walked around. She wasn\u2019t made to hide in the shadows and linger in the darkness.

The sudden gleam that brightened them made a pleasant warmth spread through Jon\u2019s entire body. </p><p>\u201cTo Winterfell. To your mother. To your sister. To your brothers.\u201d He reached for her hand and he tried to warm her ice cold skin between his own palms. He was nothing without her. He had been nothing before they had met. And he would return to be nothing when she had left. But he couldn\u2019t keep her here, locked up and sealed away from the world she loved so much. </p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cWould you come with me?\u201d She whispered. She loved him too. She loved him, but detested his world, his kingdom and his reign. How could he ever blame her? How could he blame the sun for hating the night?</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He bent his head, but his hands kept on holding onto hers. \u201cMy people need me. My kingdom needs me. If I\u2019m gone, there will be nothing but chaos.\u201d </p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips formed a straight line.</p><p>He remembered the first time he had seen her. </p><p>She had been climbing trees with her brothers. Higher and higher and higher, as if they had tried to reach the top of the Olympus, even though they were only demi-Gods and would never be allowed to enter. When she had almost gotten there she had fallen down, all the way to the ground. Her backbone had cracked, little bones in her body had broken and for a few short seconds her heart had stopped beating.</p><p>But even in death she had been beautiful. Despite her fall, she had smiled. She had smiled because she had attempted to reach one Goddamned place and had made it to another. She had told him about the irony in that and how even demi-Gods didn\u2019t seem to be free from the cruel games the Gods liked to play.</p><p>He had assured her he was not a cruel God. He was not playing games. And he had told her that her time hadn\u2019t come yet, that he would send her back to live a much longer life than the one she had already had.</p><p>But she had come back. She had jumped off the highest tower of Winterfell. She had drowned herself in the ice cold water of the melting snow after a terrible long winter. She had bled herself dry using her brother\u2019s sword. </p><p>And every time he had told her that it was not her time yet. That she had a much longer life to live and that he would sent her back to live it.</p><p>\u201cBut I love you\u2026\u201d She had whispered. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you ask for.\u201d He had answered. And he had let her go again.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I want is for you to be unhappy.\u201d Jon whispered and the tip of his finger draw circles on her ice cold skin. \u201cI never wanted you to be unhappy.\u201d</p><p>Jon had rarely left the Underworld. The underworld was his home, his kingdom. But he had made one exception once. He had saddled the horses all by himself to make sure no one knew he had gone. He had cracked open the earth, moving swiftly and quickly so he could close it again before anyone could notice the unusual light coming in. </p><p>Winterfell had prepared itself for the coming Winter at that time, but all the preparations had stopped when he had entered through the wide open gate. People had stared at him, Ned and Catelyn had rushed out of the castle with fear in their eyes. But he had assured them that he was simply here to ask for their daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. </p><p>And in that moment they had understood why their daughter had become reckless. Why Sansa had jumped off roofs and dove into ice cold water. In that moment they had understood that the God of the Underworld and the first born lady of Winterfell had fallen in love. </p><p>With tears in their eyes they had watched them leave. Jon had had his hand around her waist, holding her tightly, telling her to look over her shoulder to say goodbye to her family for as long as she could, because she would not see them again for a very long while. And Sansa had done so. But she had not cried. She had smiled. She had smiled because she could be with him and he could be with her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be unhappy for the rest of my life.\u201d Sansa sighed. \u201cIf I go home, I\u2019ll be unhappy because I won\u2019t be with you. If I stay, I\u2019ll be unhappy because I miss the burning sun and the holy tree blossoming.\u201d She pulled her hand back and bent her head. \u201cIt does seem that cruel Gods did play an evil game when they let me fall on that first day I met you.\u201d</p><p>Jon stood up from his seat and walked towards her. Nothing he could do would truly comfort her. He knew that because he had tried, night after night and day after day. But he wrapped his arms around her anyway and he held her while tears rolled down her cheeks. \u201cYou can have it both.\u201d He sighed. \u201cNot at the same time, but still.\u201d Jon rocked her back and forth in his arms. \u201cGo home during the spring- and summertime. Warm yourself in the sun, spend time with your parents and siblings, ride horses and feel the wind through your hair.\u201d He let his head rest on hers. \u201cAnd when Winter is coming you will return to me to rule by my side, to judge the souls that enter my realm, to love me and to make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked up. Even with traces of salted tears on her cheeks she still looked beautiful. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow.\u201d She stood up from her seat and cupped his face. Her lips brushed his, softly and gently and then fiercely and passionately. \u201cAnd I will think of you every day we\u2019re apart.\u201d</p><p>Jon wiped her hair from her face and used his thumbs to wipe her tears away. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a minute I won\u2019t be thinking of you. But we have eternity. There is still plenty of time to love.&ldquo;</p>",

She had jumped off the highest tower of Winterfell. She had drowned herself in the ice cold water of the melting snow after a terrible long winter. She had bled herself dry using her brother\u2019s sword. </p><p>And every time he had told her that it was not her time yet. That she had a much longer life to live and that he would sent her back to live it.</p><p>\u201cBut I love you\u2026\u201d She had whispered. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you ask for.\u201d He had answered. And he had let her go again.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I want is for you to be unhappy.\u201d Jon whispered and the tip of his finger draw circles on her ice cold skin. \u201cI never wanted you to be unhappy.\u201d</p><p>Jon had rarely left the Underworld. The underworld was his home, his kingdom. But he had made one exception once. He had saddled the horses all by himself to make sure no one knew he had gone. He had cracked open the earth, moving swiftly and quickly so he could close it again before anyone could notice the unusual light coming in. </p><p>Winterfell had prepared itself for the coming Winter at that time, but all the preparations had stopped when he had entered through the wide open gate. People had stared at him, Ned and Catelyn had rushed out of the castle with fear in their eyes. But he had assured them that he was simply here to ask for their daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. </p><p>And in that moment they had understood why their daughter had become reckless. Why Sansa had jumped off roofs and dove into ice cold water. In that moment they had understood that the God of the Underworld and the first born lady of Winterfell had fallen in love. </p><p>With tears in their eyes they had watched them leave. Jon had had his hand around her waist, holding her tightly, telling her to look over her shoulder to say goodbye to her family for as long as she could, because she would not see them again for a very long while. And Sansa had done so. But she had not cried. She had smiled. She had smiled because she could be with him and he could be with her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be unhappy for the rest of my life.\u201d Sansa sighed. \u201cIf I go home, I\u2019ll be unhappy because I won\u2019t be with you. If I stay, I\u2019ll be unhappy because I miss the burning sun and the holy tree blossoming.\u201d She pulled her hand back and bent her head. \u201cIt does seem that cruel Gods did play an evil game when they let me fall on that first day I met you.\u201d</p><p>Jon stood up from his seat and walked towards her. Nothing he could do would truly comfort her. He knew that because he had tried, night after night and day after day. But he wrapped his arms around her anyway and he held her while tears rolled down her cheeks. \u201cYou can have it both.\u201d He sighed. \u201cNot at the same time, but still.\u201d Jon rocked her back and forth in his arms. \u201cGo home during the spring- and summertime. Warm yourself in the sun, spend time with your parents and siblings, ride horses and feel the wind through your hair.\u201d He let his head rest on hers. \u201cAnd when Winter is coming you will return to me to rule by my side, to judge the souls that enter my realm, to love me and to make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked up. Even with traces of salted tears on her cheeks she still looked beautiful. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow.\u201d She stood up from her seat and cupped his face. Her lips brushed his, softly and gently and then fiercely and passionately. \u201cAnd I will think of you every day we\u2019re apart.\u201d</p><p>Jon wiped her hair from her face and used his thumbs to wipe her tears away. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a minute I won\u2019t be thinking of you. But we have eternity. There is still plenty of time to love.\u201c</p></p>",

And I likely will add to it in the future if/when I think of more question. And if you have a question that is not on here or wanted a better explanation of one already addressed don\u2019t be afraid to send me an ask.\u00a0</p><p><b>What is the SanSan Secret Santa?</b></p><blockquote><p>It\u2019s an anonymous gift exchange event that will begin in the beginning of November and end right before Christmas.</p></blockquote><p><b>How does it work?</b></p><blockquote><p>Each person that joins needs to come up with a five word or less prompt and send it to sansansecretsanta@yahoo.com. Once the sign-up period is done I will send out the name of your giftee and what their prompt is. You will have until December 22 to make some sort of gift whether that be a fic, fanart, or something else altogether. And throughout that whole time, you must send you giftee anonymous love at least once a week. So make sure to enable Asks to receive Anons.</p></blockquote><p><b>Why do I have to send Anon messages? And do I have to leave my Ask open?</b></p><blockquote><p>You have to send Anon Love for a couple of reasons. One: It\u2019s to help both you and your giftee get to know each and make your gift more personal. Two: Sending Anon Love also helps to keep track if the Santa\u2019s are actually working on the gifts and won\u2019t be a no-show on the big day. If you haven\u2019t heard from your Santa than contact me and I\u2019ll try and reach them.</p><p>And yes you need to have your Ask open to Anons. I know some have them closed for a personal reason, but it is required if you want to participate.</p></blockquote><p><b>Can anyone sign-up?</b></p><blockquote><p>Yes anyone can join as long as you can post it to Tumblr and want to make the holidays a little merrier.</p></blockquote><p><b>Where can I sign up?</b></p><blockquote><p>Sign-ups will begin on November 1st and end on the 8th. More information will be available on the <a href=\"https://sansansecretsanta.tumblr.com/Participation-Page\"><b>Participation Page.</b></a></p></blockquote><p><b>What are the requirements for a gift?</b></p><blockquote><p>Your gift <b>MUST </b>be completed by the deadline of December 22nd.</p><p>If you are writing a fic than you must write a minimum of 1,000 words and must be an original work. No past work or the work another person is allowed.</p><p>It answers the prompt that was assigned in someway.</p><p>The gift looks like you actually put effort into it</p><p>It is tag correctly. The first two tags must be #SanSan Secret Santa and #Partner\u2019s Username</p></blockquote><p><b>What can my gift be?</b></p><blockquote><p>Your gift can be anything as long as it\u2019s complete. free, and original. It can be anything from fanfiction, fan videos, gif sets, handcrafted creations, and anything else you can think of! \n\n</p></blockquote><p><b>What if I can\u2019t come up with a prompt? I have my prompt, but I don\u2019t know what to make? Why only 5 words maximum for the prompt?</b></p><blockquote><p>A good prompt should both be inspiring and open-ended enough that it will allow your Santa creative freedom. Which is the reason 5 words or less is the requirement for your prompt. A prompt could be a series of concepts\u2013Christmas, presents, kiss, hot coco\u2013or something more concrete\u2013They are roommates AU.</p><p>If you are struggling with ideas on what to do with your prompt talk to your giftee! Talking with your giftee and finding out what they like or what they were hoping to see will definitely get the creative juices going. If you still need help you can come message me and I will either help you or assign you a Santa\u2019s Little Helpers.</p></blockquote><p><b>Is there any way non-participants could help?</b></p><blockquote><p>Of course! If you don\u2019t want a random prompt/can\u2019t commit to filling a prompt but DO want to participate, you can submit work to the blog, tag your work #SanSan Secret Santa, or become one of Santa\u2019s Little Helpers. \u00a0Santa\u2019s Little Helpers are our beta-readers, our emergency last-minute prompt-adopters, the people who send random love to people who aren\u2019t even their exchange partner just because of reasons.</p></blockquote><p><b>What does it mean for \u201cYes or No Smut\u201d?</b></p><blockquote><p>This is referring to when you send your sign-up email. Yes Smut means that you are agreeing to receive a gift with smut(though not necessarily mean that you will get it) and is able to produce a gift with smut(though, again, not necessarily mean that you have to produce it). No Smut means that you do not want to have a gift with smut and can not make a gift with smut.</p></blockquote><p><b>What if I can no longer participate in the Secret Santa?</b></p><blockquote><p>If there is absolutely no way that you can continue with the exchange get in contact with me as soon as possible so that I can find a replacement.</p></blockquote><p><b>I haven\u2019t heard from my Santa/Giftee in while, what do I do?</b></p><blockquote><p>Message me and I will get in contact with your Santa</p></blockquote>",

                "content": "<p><p>@sharkaria requested that I make the FAQ a Tumblr post so here it is! Keep in mind that I only wrote down the answers to the question that I could think of. And I likely will add to it in the future if/when I think of more question. And if you have a question that is not on here or wanted a better explanation of one already addressed don&rsquo;t be afraid to send me an ask.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What is the SanSan Secret Santa?</b></p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s an anonymous gift exchange event that will begin in the beginning of November and end right before Christmas.</p></blockquote><p><b>How does it work?</b></p><blockquote><p>Each person that joins needs to come up with a five word or less prompt and send it to sansansecretsanta@yahoo.com. Once the sign-up period is done I will send out the name of your giftee and what their prompt is. You will have until December 22 to make some sort of gift whether that be a fic, fanart, or something else altogether. And throughout that whole time, you must send you giftee anonymous love at least once a week. So make sure to enable Asks to receive Anons.</p></blockquote><p><b>Why do I have to send Anon messages? And do I have to leave my Ask open?</b></p><blockquote><p>You have to send Anon Love for a couple of reasons. One: It&rsquo;s to help both you and your giftee get to know each and make your gift more personal. Two: Sending Anon Love also helps to keep track if the Santa&rsquo;s are actually working on the gifts and won&rsquo;t be a no-show on the big day. If you haven&rsquo;t heard from your Santa than contact me and I&rsquo;ll try and reach them.</p><p>And yes you need to have your Ask open to Anons. I know some have them closed for a personal reason, but it is required if you want to participate.</p></blockquote><p><b>Can anyone sign-up?</b></p><blockquote><p>Yes anyone can join as long as you can post it to Tumblr and want to make the holidays a little merrier.</p></blockquote><p><b>Where can I sign up?</b></p><blockquote><p>Sign-ups will begin on November 1st and end on the 8th. More information will be available on the <a href=\"https://sansansecretsanta.tumblr.com/Participation-Page\"><b>Participation Page.</b></a></p></blockquote><p><b>What are the requirements for a gift?</b></p><blockquote><p>Your gift <b>MUST </b>be completed by the deadline of December 22nd.</p><p>If you are writing a fic than you must write a minimum of 1,000 words and must be an original work. No past work or the work another person is allowed.</p><p>It answers the prompt that was assigned in someway.</p><p>The gift looks like you actually put effort into it</p><p>It is tag correctly. The first two tags must be #SanSan Secret Santa and #Partner&rsquo;s Username</p></blockquote><p><b>What can my gift be?</b></p><blockquote><p>Your gift can be anything as long as it&rsquo;s complete. free, and original. It can be anything from fanfiction, fan videos, gif sets, handcrafted creations, and anything else you can think of! \n\n</p></blockquote><p><b>What if I can&rsquo;t come up with a prompt? I have my prompt, but I don&rsquo;t know what to make? Why only 5 words maximum for the prompt?</b></p><blockquote><p>A good prompt should both be inspiring and open-ended enough that it will allow your Santa creative freedom. Which is the reason 5 words or less is the requirement for your prompt. A prompt could be a series of concepts&ndash;Christmas, presents, kiss, hot coco&ndash;or something more concrete&ndash;They are roommates AU.</p><p>If you are struggling with ideas on what to do with your prompt talk to your giftee!
