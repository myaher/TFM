It was a habit that you had never been able to let go, but you claimed it helped you \u201cthink better\u201d. You eyes narrowed in on your best friend who was currently lounging next to you on his phone.</p><p>\u201cHey Pete.\u201d The brunette looked over at you, eyes wide with a puzzled expression. </p><p>\u201cExactly how does being on your phone help you with studying for finals?\u201d You questioned him jokingly. After all, he was the one who had begged you to come over and study claiming that he couldn\u2019t focus alone.</p><p>\u201cI already know all the material.\u201d He shrugged, going back to scroll through his feed.</p><p>Your eyebrows bumped together and confusion. \u201cThen why did you beg and plead to come study with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem with me wanting to hang out with my best friend since second grade?\u201d He questioned you innocently, rolling onto his stomach. He placed his head on his palms and blinked at you with puppy eyes.</p><p>Okay, you had to admit he had a point. The two of you were practically inseparable. From spending almost everyday together or on video call to constantly texting, you almost considered him your brother.</p><p><i>Almost</i>.</p><p>See, you happened to have a rather huge crush on none other than Peter Parker. You\u2019d started having feelings for him nearly two years ago, and assumed that the butterflies would die in a few month. But you were wrong&hellip;<i>so wrong</i>.</p><p>The butterflies had seemed to multiply and now you were in love with the curly haired, starry-eyed, beautiful boy whom you called your friend&hellip;and nothing more.</p><p>But there was nothing you could do to fix your problem. You risked a lot by telling him about your feelings. Peter wasn\u2019t the type to stop being friends with you just because you liked him, but you didn\u2019t want to ruin things and make it awkward.</p><p>It was cliche, you knew that. But this was real life. Things don\u2019t work like those movies and books do&hellip;<i>right?</i></p><p>What you didn\u2019t know is that Peter wasn\u2019t much better off that you. He had liked you since, well, you first met him. He had just never said anything due to the same reasons you had.</p><p>That and recently Peter had started having a growing attraction to someone he could never tell you about in a million years.</p><p>You shook your head, coming back to reality, and rolled your eyes at him. \u201cWhat are you doing anyway?\u201d</p><p>He showed the screen of his phone to you before moving it back. \u201cReading science pick up lines.\u201d He said, as if the pastime was completely normal.</p><p>\u201cOooooh~ Peterrr wanna tell me about her?\u201d You cooed, mimicking a basic highschool girl while moving closer to him.</p><p>\u201cNahhh.\u201d He rolled over onto his side so his back was facing you. \u201cDon\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d be a liar if you didn\u2019t admit that you\u2019re heart dropped for a second. But how could you not expect him to have a crush on someone else. Honestly you were surprised he <i>didn\u2019t</i> even have anyone in the first place considering how beautiful and perfect he was.</p><p>You didn\u2019t reply, only going back to study your notes. Your answer being in the form of the sound of you writing.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna hear one?\u201d His soft voice asked after a few seconds of silence.</p><p>You signed and slowly nodded without looking up, but you could just tell he was beaming at the moment.</p><p>\u201cOk ok&hellip; So. My love for you is like the universe.\u201d You raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cNever ending!\u201d</p><p>His face almost made you laugh, but just for the spite of it, you kept a straight face and slowly shook your head in fake disapproval.</p><p>\u201cNot feelin it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTry another one, Champ.\u201d You rolled your eyes, a tiny smile pulling at your lips.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He sighed, scrolling through his phone for another second before glancing at you. \u201cDo you like science? Cuz i\u2019ve got my <i>ion</i> you.\u201d</p><p>The joke was bad enough, but Peter, being the little shit he is, added a wink into the mix. To avoid blushing madly from the tiny gesture, you picked up a pillow and threw it at him as hard as possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014Ouch!\u201d He flailed off the bed, exaggerating his pain and rolled around on the floor. \u201cOh i\u2019m wounded!\u201d He groaned before picking the same weapon up and chucking it back at you.</p><p>You ducked, missing his attack completely. You smiled widely at him, holding up two middle fingers innocently. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d You rolled your eyes, a tiny giggle still detectable in your voice. \u201cYou and your pick-up lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just warming up.\u201d Peter sat up, pushing the messy curls from his eyes. \u201cYou must be a 90 degree angle because to me, you look just right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPETER!\u201d You yelled, once again chucking the pillow back at him. This time however, you were giggling at his stupid self. It wasn\u2019t long before he too joined you as a laughing mess. All which was music to your ears.</p><p>~\u2022~</p><p>The next day was an absolute roller coaster for you. It started out like any normal day, but after getting an Avengers alert in the middle of AP Chem, things got a little crazy.</p><p>That would be your third unexcused absence that week. If you kept your side job up, your mother would start to wonder what you were doing instead.</p><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t your fault, it was either get perfect attendance or save the world. You chose the latter. </p><p>Stumbling out of school, you ran into a abandoned alley way and began hurriedly stripping out of your school clothes, revealing the slightly armored spandex suit that was hidden beneath. You shuffled through your bag, pulling out the black, red, and silver mask. </p><p>You stuffed your school back in its normal hiding spot before running down the alley, failing to notice the webbed (in plain sight) backpack also there. </p><p>\u201cHey. F.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d You tapped your temple. </p><p>\u201cYes, Ms. L/N?\u201d The automated voice responded.</p><p>\u201cPick me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready on it, look behind you.\u201d You glanced over your shoulder, smiling under your mask as your similarly colored motorcycle approached from behind. </p><p>Doing a backflip at exactly the right moment, you landed perfectly on the seat of your ride. Gripping the handles, your sped up, moving faster towards the indicated spot on your mask\u2019s digital map.</p><p>\u201cIncoming call from: Spider-Man.\u201d You raised your eyebrows at the notification but told F.R.I.D.A.Y. to answer it. </p><p>\u201cHey Webhead!\u201d You greeted your partner. Without the original Avengers around to protect Manhattan, the two of you had become the next generation. The dynamic duo. Partners in fighting crime. \u201cHow\u2019s downtown looking?\u201d</p><p>You heard incoherent sarcastic mumbling before getting a reply. \u201cLooks like a giant mechanic thingy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThingy? Very professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014Shut up. You\u2019re late anyway.\u201d</p><p>You swerved hard around a truck, leaning in order to make it in time before oncoming traffic reached you. \u201cSorry we live in Manhattan. Traffic isn\u2019t always ideal.\u201d You rolled your eyes at your partner.</p><p>\u201cWanna take the high route?\u201d You could hear the \u2018<b>thwip</b>\u2019 sound of his webshooters, knowing that he was already in his way. </p><p>You didn\u2019t reply, just ended the call and gave F.R.I.D.A.Y a quick command. \u201cHey take over for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d </p><p>You let go of the handle bars, raising one arm, knowing your spider-friend wasn\u2019t far away.</p><p>A gloved hands clasped your semi-covered one and pulled you into the air.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yoink</i>!\u201d You looked up at the hero, knowing that he was grinning behind his mask. </p><p>\u201cReally? Every time?\u201d Your mask\u2019s eyes narrowed at him in faux disapproval. </p><p>He shrugged, using the momentum of swinging to pull you up against his body.  You wrapped your arms around his neck, allowing him to let go of you and use both hands to swing through the city.  You could feel his heart beat, and it was racing. You could only assume he was nervous about the fight; you were too.</p><p>The two of you were close, fighting crime together for almost a year now was one of the factors. However, you didn\u2019t really know <i>who</i> he actually was.</p><p>It was a promise you both made when you signed up for the job. You weren\u2019t gonna let your personal lives get mixed with your hero lives. It was sensible, but it didn\u2019t keep you from wondering what he looked like under than mask. You\u2019d be naive to assume he never thought the same.</p><p>Not long after, the two of you were standing on a rooftop, watching as the giant mechanical monster worked it\u2019s way towards the heart of Manhattan.</p><p>You breathed out an exasperated breath as you watched it. \u201cHydra again?\u201d </p><p>Spider-Man crossed his arms across his chest and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m assuming so. Looks tougher than last time though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a whimp.\u201d You shrugged, attempting to mask the worry in your own voice. \u201cYou ready to go, Spidey?\u201d</p><p>He looked from you, to the machine, then back to you. \u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d He held out his hand, ready for your famous handshake. </p><p>You smiled, following his lead before jumping into action.</p><p>~<strike><b>i can\u2019t write fight scenes help</b></strike>~</p><p>Nearly two hours later, you sat on the same rooftop from before as a bruised, sweaty, and bloody mess. You could feel the wounds healing due to your healing factor, but it hurt none the less.</p><p>Spider-man has dropped you off (per your command) and was dealing with the clean up and press. but you expected him to be back at any moment.</p><p>As if he had heard your thoughts, the masked web-slinger showed up. He landed on the rooftop, his body language showing how exhausted he really was. </p><p>He stumbled over to you, sliding down the same half wall you rested against. </p><p>\u201cBack from the red carpet?\u201d You quipped, trying to control your heaving breathing.</p><p>\u201cHar. Har.\u201d He mock laughed,  placing a hand over the burned scar on his abdomen while wincing. </p><p>He glanced at you, one of his fiberglass eye-lenses was cracked, giving you the first look at his real eyes you had ever seen. But there was something else, the tiny part of his cheek you could seen was&hellip;pink? Was he blushing?</p><p>You shook your head. No, <i>of course not.</i> He was probably just worn out.</p><p>But his eyes didn\u2019t leave your figure. They were searching you, even though most of your face was covered (except for the parts now exposed from cuts and burns).</p><p>But there was something familiar about those eyes. Something that you couldn\u2019t put your together due to your hazy, tired mind. </p><p>Your partner seemed to be thinking something similar as you. But he gave up, resting his head back against the wall and sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He breathed, not looking at you. You didn\u2019t verbal reply, just looking at you with tired eyes. \u201cDo you like science?\u201d</p><p>You raised you eyebrow, mouth moving to open as you finally began to piece two and two together. </p><p>\u201cCuz I\u2019ve got my ion you.\u201d Laughing breathlessly at his joke, the hero attempted to lighten the mood. the effort caused him to wince several times during the process.</p><p>\u201cWha&hellip;what the?\u201d You slowly sat up, eyes widening. \u201cPeter..?\u201d</p><p>The visible eye widened in shock. \u201cUh, uh.\u201d He cleared his throat, lowering his voice. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2014\u201c You pulled off you mask, eyes still wide with surprise. \u201cY/N?!!\u201d</p><p>Spider-man reached up and pulled up off his own mask, his eyes nearly as wide as yours. </p><p>There sat your childhood best friend, bruised from battle, with his mouth hanging wide open. </p><p>\u201cHow can this be?\u201d He asked, his voice going an octave higher as he stuttered. \u201cMy best friend is also my hero partner? That\u2019s crazy, i mean, what are the chances of that? And to think I stopped liking you because i thought i had no chance and I started liking your alter ego\u2014wait, shit.\u201d He covered his mouth with his hands.</p><p>\u201cPeter&hellip;?\u201d Leaning towards him, your voice fell to just barely above a whisper. \u201cYou like&hellip;me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I&hellip;\u201d He glanced at you and pushed back his messy curls from his forehead. \u201cYes&hellip;I like you. I\u2019ve liked you ever since we met.\u201d He admitted sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d You asked softly, already knowing the reason.</p><p>\u201cBecause&hellip;you just seemed so out of my league.\u201d He glanced down at his hands, fidgeting nervously with the webshooters. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, sweet, kind, and absolutely beautiful. Plus we have such an amazing friendship I\u2014\u201c He took a deep breath when you placed your own hand over his, slowly interlocking them.</p><p>He looked up at you, a sudden wave of boldness washing through his veins. \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t wanna <i>just</i> be your friend.\u201d </p><p>His free hand moved up to cup your cheek; his eyes glanced from your eyes to your lips. \u201cI want to be <i>more</i>.\u201d He breathed.</p><p>You didn\u2019t reply, your actions speaking for you as you leaned closer to him. </p><p>\u201cCan I..?\u201d Peter asked, unsure suddenly as doubts began to flood his mind. </p><p>You could tell he was about to say something else, but before he could say anything, you gently pressed your lips against his. </p><p>And suddenly a beautiful feeling washed over you. Those butterflies you had been holding onto seemed to burst into freedom. Your lips moved in sync, like they were made to be together.</p><p>Peter\u2019s hands found your hips naturally, holding onto you as if you were his lifeline. You hands wrapped around his neck, fingers twirling gently in his soft hair.</p><p>Pulling back for hair, your chests heaved, but you kept your forehead pressed against his.</p><p>\u201cHey Pete?\u201d You asked softly.</p><p>He hummed in response, face still red and heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cI think&hellip;I <i>love you</i>.\u201d You whispered now only a few centimeters from his lips.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart skipped a beat when you said those words. Those magical words he never thought he would hear you say.   He bit his lips, savoring the sound of you saying it play over and over in his mind. </p><p>\u201cCan you..\u201d He hesitated. \u201cCan you say that again?\u201d </p><p>Your eyebrows bumped together as you leaned back to get a better look at him. \u201cI love you?\u201d</p><p>Like a giddy middle school girl, he fell backwards, nearly giggling from all the emotions that were coursing through him. </p><p>\u201cOh my <i>god</i>, Y/N!\u201d He laughed, covering his face with his hands before jumping up. </p><p>\u201cI love you. I <i>love</i> you. <i>I love you</i>!\u201d He laughed, forgetting all previous pain. You looked at him, smiling at how genuinely happy he was. He reached a hand out to you, pulling you up.</p><p>He twirled you around, causing you to giggle at his pure reaction to the event. Coming back in from the twirl, you wrapped your arms around his torso, hugging him tightly. </p><p>He laughed softly, resting his head in the crook of your neck, beaming like a little kid in a candy store.</p><p>\u201cAre you less than 90 degrees?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeter, don\u2019t you <i>dare</i>\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cCause you\u2019re acute girl!\u201d He laughed, and you pushed away from him, punching his chest (lightly of course).

It was a habit that you had never been able to let go, but you claimed it helped you \u201cthink better\u201d. You eyes narrowed in on your best friend who was currently lounging next to you on his phone.</p><p>\u201cHey Pete.\u201d The brunette looked over at you, eyes wide with a puzzled expression. </p><p>\u201cExactly how does being on your phone help you with studying for finals?\u201d You questioned him jokingly. After all, he was the one who had begged you to come over and study claiming that he couldn\u2019t focus alone.</p><p>\u201cI already know all the material.\u201d He shrugged, going back to scroll through his feed.</p><p>Your eyebrows bumped together and confusion. \u201cThen why did you beg and plead to come study with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem with me wanting to hang out with my best friend since second grade?\u201d He questioned you innocently, rolling onto his stomach. He placed his head on his palms and blinked at you with puppy eyes.</p><p>Okay, you had to admit he had a point. The two of you were practically inseparable. From spending almost everyday together or on video call to constantly texting, you almost considered him your brother.</p><p><i>Almost</i>.</p><p>See, you happened to have a rather huge crush on none other than Peter Parker. You\u2019d started having feelings for him nearly two years ago, and assumed that the butterflies would die in a few month. But you were wrong\u2026<i>so wrong</i>.</p><p>The butterflies had seemed to multiply and now you were in love with the curly haired, starry-eyed, beautiful boy whom you called your friend\u2026and nothing more.</p><p>But there was nothing you could do to fix your problem. You risked a lot by telling him about your feelings. Peter wasn\u2019t the type to stop being friends with you just because you liked him, but you didn\u2019t want to ruin things and make it awkward.</p><p>It was cliche, you knew that. But this was real life. Things don\u2019t work like those movies and books do\u2026<i>right?</i></p><p>What you didn\u2019t know is that Peter wasn\u2019t much better off that you. He had liked you since, well, you first met him. He had just never said anything due to the same reasons you had.</p><p>That and recently Peter had started having a growing attraction to someone he could never tell you about in a million years.</p><p>You shook your head, coming back to reality, and rolled your eyes at him. \u201cWhat are you doing anyway?\u201d</p><p>He showed the screen of his phone to you before moving it back. \u201cReading science pick up lines.\u201d He said, as if the pastime was completely normal.</p><p>\u201cOooooh~ Peterrr wanna tell me about her?\u201d You cooed, mimicking a basic highschool girl while moving closer to him.</p><p>\u201cNahhh.\u201d He rolled over onto his side so his back was facing you. \u201cDon\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d be a liar if you didn\u2019t admit that you\u2019re heart dropped for a second. But how could you not expect him to have a crush on someone else. Honestly you were surprised he <i>didn\u2019t</i> even have anyone in the first place considering how beautiful and perfect he was.</p><p>You didn\u2019t reply, only going back to study your notes. Your answer being in the form of the sound of you writing.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna hear one?\u201d His soft voice asked after a few seconds of silence.</p><p>You signed and slowly nodded without looking up, but you could just tell he was beaming at the moment.</p><p>\u201cOk ok\u2026 So. My love for you is like the universe.\u201d You raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cNever ending!\u201d</p><p>His face almost made you laugh, but just for the spite of it, you kept a straight face and slowly shook your head in fake disapproval.</p><p>\u201cNot feelin it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTry another one, Champ.\u201d You rolled your eyes, a tiny smile pulling at your lips.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He sighed, scrolling through his phone for another second before glancing at you. \u201cDo you like science? Cuz i\u2019ve got my <i>ion</i> you.\u201d</p><p>The joke was bad enough, but Peter, being the little shit he is, added a wink into the mix. To avoid blushing madly from the tiny gesture, you picked up a pillow and threw it at him as hard as possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014Ouch!\u201d He flailed off the bed, exaggerating his pain and rolled around on the floor. \u201cOh i\u2019m wounded!\u201d He groaned before picking the same weapon up and chucking it back at you.</p><p>You ducked, missing his attack completely. You smiled widely at him, holding up two middle fingers innocently. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d You rolled your eyes, a tiny giggle still detectable in your voice. \u201cYou and your pick-up lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just warming up.\u201d Peter sat up, pushing the messy curls from his eyes. \u201cYou must be a 90 degree angle because to me, you look just right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPETER!\u201d You yelled, once again chucking the pillow back at him. This time however, you were giggling at his stupid self. It wasn\u2019t long before he too joined you as a laughing mess. All which was music to your ears.</p><p>~\u2022~</p><p>The next day was an absolute roller coaster for you. It started out like any normal day, but after getting an Avengers alert in the middle of AP Chem, things got a little crazy.</p><p>That would be your third unexcused absence that week. If you kept your side job up, your mother would start to wonder what you were doing instead.</p><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t your fault, it was either get perfect attendance or save the world. You chose the latter. </p><p>Stumbling out of school, you ran into a abandoned alley way and began hurriedly stripping out of your school clothes, revealing the slightly armored spandex suit that was hidden beneath. You shuffled through your bag, pulling out the black, red, and silver mask. </p><p>You stuffed your school back in its normal hiding spot before running down the alley, failing to notice the webbed (in plain sight) backpack also there. </p><p>\u201cHey. F.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d You tapped your temple. </p><p>\u201cYes, Ms. L/N?\u201d The automated voice responded.</p><p>\u201cPick me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready on it, look behind you.\u201d You glanced over your shoulder, smiling under your mask as your similarly colored motorcycle approached from behind. </p><p>Doing a backflip at exactly the right moment, you landed perfectly on the seat of your ride. Gripping the handles, your sped up, moving faster towards the indicated spot on your mask\u2019s digital map.</p><p>\u201cIncoming call from: Spider-Man.\u201d You raised your eyebrows at the notification but told F.R.I.D.A.Y. to answer it. </p><p>\u201cHey Webhead!\u201d You greeted your partner. Without the original Avengers around to protect Manhattan, the two of you had become the next generation. The dynamic duo. Partners in fighting crime. \u201cHow\u2019s downtown looking?\u201d</p><p>You heard incoherent sarcastic mumbling before getting a reply. \u201cLooks like a giant mechanic thingy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThingy? Very professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014Shut up. You\u2019re late anyway.\u201d</p><p>You swerved hard around a truck, leaning in order to make it in time before oncoming traffic reached you. \u201cSorry we live in Manhattan. Traffic isn\u2019t always ideal.\u201d You rolled your eyes at your partner.</p><p>\u201cWanna take the high route?\u201d You could hear the \u2018<b>thwip</b>\u2019 sound of his webshooters, knowing that he was already in his way. </p><p>You didn\u2019t reply, just ended the call and gave F.R.I.D.A.Y a quick command. \u201cHey take over for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d </p><p>You let go of the handle bars, raising one arm, knowing your spider-friend wasn\u2019t far away.</p><p>A gloved hands clasped your semi-covered one and pulled you into the air.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yoink</i>!\u201d You looked up at the hero, knowing that he was grinning behind his mask. </p><p>\u201cReally? Every time?\u201d Your mask\u2019s eyes narrowed at him in faux disapproval. </p><p>He shrugged, using the momentum of swinging to pull you up against his body.  You wrapped your arms around his neck, allowing him to let go of you and use both hands to swing through the city.  You could feel his heart beat, and it was racing. You could only assume he was nervous about the fight; you were too.</p><p>The two of you were close, fighting crime together for almost a year now was one of the factors. However, you didn\u2019t really know <i>who</i> he actually was.</p><p>It was a promise you both made when you signed up for the job. You weren\u2019t gonna let your personal lives get mixed with your hero lives. It was sensible, but it didn\u2019t keep you from wondering what he looked like under than mask. You\u2019d be naive to assume he never thought the same.</p><p>Not long after, the two of you were standing on a rooftop, watching as the giant mechanical monster worked it\u2019s way towards the heart of Manhattan.</p><p>You breathed out an exasperated breath as you watched it. \u201cHydra again?\u201d </p><p>Spider-Man crossed his arms across his chest and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m assuming so. Looks tougher than last time though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a whimp.\u201d You shrugged, attempting to mask the worry in your own voice. \u201cYou ready to go, Spidey?\u201d</p><p>He looked from you, to the machine, then back to you. \u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d He held out his hand, ready for your famous handshake. </p><p>You smiled, following his lead before jumping into action.</p><p>~<strike><b>i can\u2019t write fight scenes help</b></strike>~</p><p>Nearly two hours later, you sat on the same rooftop from before as a bruised, sweaty, and bloody mess. You could feel the wounds healing due to your healing factor, but it hurt none the less.</p><p>Spider-man has dropped you off (per your command) and was dealing with the clean up and press. but you expected him to be back at any moment.</p><p>As if he had heard your thoughts, the masked web-slinger showed up. He landed on the rooftop, his body language showing how exhausted he really was. </p><p>He stumbled over to you, sliding down the same half wall you rested against. </p><p>\u201cBack from the red carpet?\u201d You quipped, trying to control your heaving breathing.</p><p>\u201cHar. Har.\u201d He mock laughed,  placing a hand over the burned scar on his abdomen while wincing. </p><p>He glanced at you, one of his fiberglass eye-lenses was cracked, giving you the first look at his real eyes you had ever seen. But there was something else, the tiny part of his cheek you could seen was\u2026pink? Was he blushing?</p><p>You shook your head. No, <i>of course not.</i> He was probably just worn out.</p><p>But his eyes didn\u2019t leave your figure. They were searching you, even though most of your face was covered (except for the parts now exposed from cuts and burns).</p><p>But there was something familiar about those eyes. Something that you couldn\u2019t put your together due to your hazy, tired mind. </p><p>Your partner seemed to be thinking something similar as you. But he gave up, resting his head back against the wall and sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He breathed, not looking at you. You didn\u2019t verbal reply, just looking at you with tired eyes. \u201cDo you like science?\u201d</p><p>You raised you eyebrow, mouth moving to open as you finally began to piece two and two together. </p><p>\u201cCuz I\u2019ve got my ion you.\u201d Laughing breathlessly at his joke, the hero attempted to lighten the mood. the effort caused him to wince several times during the process.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2026what the?\u201d You slowly sat up, eyes widening. \u201cPeter..?\u201d</p><p>The visible eye widened in shock. \u201cUh, uh.\u201d He cleared his throat, lowering his voice. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2014\u201c You pulled off you mask, eyes still wide with surprise. \u201cY/N?!!\u201d</p><p>Spider-man reached up and pulled up off his own mask, his eyes nearly as wide as yours. </p><p>There sat your childhood best friend, bruised from battle, with his mouth hanging wide open. </p><p>\u201cHow can this be?\u201d He asked, his voice going an octave higher as he stuttered. \u201cMy best friend is also my hero partner? That\u2019s crazy, i mean, what are the chances of that? And to think I stopped liking you because i thought i had no chance and I started liking your alter ego\u2014wait, shit.\u201d He covered his mouth with his hands.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026?\u201d Leaning towards him, your voice fell to just barely above a whisper. \u201cYou like\u2026me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2026\u201d He glanced at you and pushed back his messy curls from his forehead. \u201cYes\u2026I like you. I\u2019ve liked you ever since we met.\u201d He admitted sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d You asked softly, already knowing the reason.</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2026you just seemed so out of my league.\u201d He glanced down at his hands, fidgeting nervously with the webshooters. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, sweet, kind, and absolutely beautiful. Plus we have such an amazing friendship I\u2014\u201c He took a deep breath when you placed your own hand over his, slowly interlocking them.</p><p>He looked up at you, a sudden wave of boldness washing through his veins. \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t wanna <i>just</i> be your friend.\u201d </p><p>His free hand moved up to cup your cheek; his eyes glanced from your eyes to your lips. \u201cI want to be <i>more</i>.\u201d He breathed.</p><p>You didn\u2019t reply, your actions speaking for you as you leaned closer to him. </p><p>\u201cCan I..?\u201d Peter asked, unsure suddenly as doubts began to flood his mind. </p><p>You could tell he was about to say something else, but before he could say anything, you gently pressed your lips against his. </p><p>And suddenly a beautiful feeling washed over you. Those butterflies you had been holding onto seemed to burst into freedom. Your lips moved in sync, like they were made to be together.</p><p>Peter\u2019s hands found your hips naturally, holding onto you as if you were his lifeline. You hands wrapped around his neck, fingers twirling gently in his soft hair.</p><p>Pulling back for hair, your chests heaved, but you kept your forehead pressed against his.</p><p>\u201cHey Pete?\u201d You asked softly.</p><p>He hummed in response, face still red and heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cI think\u2026I <i>love you</i>.\u201d You whispered now only a few centimeters from his lips.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart skipped a beat when you said those words. Those magical words he never thought he would hear you say.   He bit his lips, savoring the sound of you saying it play over and over in his mind. </p><p>\u201cCan you..\u201d He hesitated. \u201cCan you say that again?\u201d </p><p>Your eyebrows bumped together as you leaned back to get a better look at him. \u201cI love you?\u201d</p><p>Like a giddy middle school girl, he fell backwards, nearly giggling from all the emotions that were coursing through him. </p><p>\u201cOh my <i>god</i>, Y/N!\u201d He laughed, covering his face with his hands before jumping up. </p><p>\u201cI love you. I <i>love</i> you. <i>I love you</i>!\u201d He laughed, forgetting all previous pain. You looked at him, smiling at how genuinely happy he was. He reached a hand out to you, pulling you up.</p><p>He twirled you around, causing you to giggle at his pure reaction to the event. Coming back in from the twirl, you wrapped your arms around his torso, hugging him tightly. </p><p>He laughed softly, resting his head in the crook of your neck, beaming like a little kid in a candy store.</p><p>\u201cAre you less than 90 degrees?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeter, don\u2019t you <i>dare</i>\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cCause you\u2019re acute girl!\u201d He laughed, and you pushed away from him, punching his chest (lightly of course). He laughed, giving you the biggest grin possible. \u201cYou know you love me.\u201d He smirked, winking at you.</p><p>You blushed, shaking your head as you crossed your arms. \u201cYeah..\u201d You huffed. \u201cYeah I love you..\u201d</p><p>You smiled at each other, getting lost in the magic of the night. </p></p>",

He had just never said anything due to the same reasons you had.</p><p>That and recently Peter had started having a growing attraction to someone he could never tell you about in a million years.</p><p>You shook your head, coming back to reality, and rolled your eyes at him. \u201cWhat are you doing anyway?\u201d</p><p>He showed the screen of his phone to you before moving it back. \u201cReading science pick up lines.\u201d He said, as if the pastime was completely normal.</p><p>\u201cOooooh~ Peterrr wanna tell me about her?\u201d You cooed, mimicking a basic highschool girl while moving closer to him.</p><p>\u201cNahhh.\u201d He rolled over onto his side so his back was facing you. \u201cDon\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d be a liar if you didn\u2019t admit that you\u2019re heart dropped for a second. But how could you not expect him to have a crush on someone else. Honestly you were surprised he <i>didn\u2019t</i> even have anyone in the first place considering how beautiful and perfect he was.</p><p>You didn\u2019t reply, only going back to study your notes. Your answer being in the form of the sound of you writing.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna hear one?\u201d His soft voice asked after a few seconds of silence.</p><p>You signed and slowly nodded without looking up, but you could just tell he was beaming at the moment.</p><p>\u201cOk ok\u2026 So. My love for you is like the universe.\u201d You raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cNever ending!\u201d</p><p>His face almost made you laugh, but just for the spite of it, you kept a straight face and slowly shook your head in fake disapproval.</p><p>\u201cNot feelin it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTry another one, Champ.\u201d You rolled your eyes, a tiny smile pulling at your lips.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He sighed, scrolling through his phone for another second before glancing at you. \u201cDo you like science? Cuz i\u2019ve got my <i>ion</i> you.\u201d</p><p>The joke was bad enough, but Peter, being the little shit he is, added a wink into the mix. To avoid blushing madly from the tiny gesture, you picked up a pillow and threw it at him as hard as possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014Ouch!\u201d He flailed off the bed, exaggerating his pain and rolled around on the floor. \u201cOh i\u2019m wounded!\u201d He groaned before picking the same weapon up and chucking it back at you.</p><p>You ducked, missing his attack completely. You smiled widely at him, holding up two middle fingers innocently. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d You rolled your eyes, a tiny giggle still detectable in your voice. \u201cYou and your pick-up lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just warming up.\u201d Peter sat up, pushing the messy curls from his eyes. \u201cYou must be a 90 degree angle because to me, you look just right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPETER!\u201d You yelled, once again chucking the pillow back at him. This time however, you were giggling at his stupid self. It wasn\u2019t long before he too joined you as a laughing mess. All which was music to your ears.</p><p>~\u2022~</p><p>The next day was an absolute roller coaster for you. It started out like any normal day, but after getting an Avengers alert in the middle of AP Chem, things got a little crazy.</p><p>That would be your third unexcused absence that week. If you kept your side job up, your mother would start to wonder what you were doing instead.</p><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t your fault, it was either get perfect attendance or save the world. You chose the latter. </p><p>Stumbling out of school, you ran into a abandoned alley way and began hurriedly stripping out of your school clothes, revealing the slightly armored spandex suit that was hidden beneath. You shuffled through your bag, pulling out the black, red, and silver mask. </p><p>You stuffed your school back in its normal hiding spot before running down the alley, failing to notice the webbed (in plain sight) backpack also there. </p><p>\u201cHey. F.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d You tapped your temple. </p><p>\u201cYes, Ms. L/N?\u201d The automated voice responded.</p><p>\u201cPick me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready on it, look behind you.\u201d You glanced over your shoulder, smiling under your mask as your similarly colored motorcycle approached from behind. </p><p>Doing a backflip at exactly the right moment, you landed perfectly on the seat of your ride. Gripping the handles, your sped up, moving faster towards the indicated spot on your mask\u2019s digital map.</p><p>\u201cIncoming call from: Spider-Man.\u201d You raised your eyebrows at the notification but told F.R.I.D.A.Y. to answer it. </p><p>\u201cHey Webhead!\u201d You greeted your partner. Without the original Avengers around to protect Manhattan, the two of you had become the next generation. The dynamic duo. Partners in fighting crime. \u201cHow\u2019s downtown looking?\u201d</p><p>You heard incoherent sarcastic mumbling before getting a reply. \u201cLooks like a giant mechanic thingy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThingy? Very professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014Shut up. You\u2019re late anyway.\u201d</p><p>You swerved hard around a truck, leaning in order to make it in time before oncoming traffic reached you. \u201cSorry we live in Manhattan. Traffic isn\u2019t always ideal.\u201d You rolled your eyes at your partner.</p><p>\u201cWanna take the high route?\u201d You could hear the \u2018<b>thwip</b>\u2019 sound of his webshooters, knowing that he was already in his way. </p><p>You didn\u2019t reply, just ended the call and gave F.R.I.D.A.Y a quick command. \u201cHey take over for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d </p><p>You let go of the handle bars, raising one arm, knowing your spider-friend wasn\u2019t far away.</p><p>A gloved hands clasped your semi-covered one and pulled you into the air.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yoink</i>!\u201d You looked up at the hero, knowing that he was grinning behind his mask. </p><p>\u201cReally? Every time?\u201d Your mask\u2019s eyes narrowed at him in faux disapproval. </p><p>He shrugged, using the momentum of swinging to pull you up against his body.  You wrapped your arms around his neck, allowing him to let go of you and use both hands to swing through the city.  You could feel his heart beat, and it was racing. You could only assume he was nervous about the fight; you were too.</p><p>The two of you were close, fighting crime together for almost a year now was one of the factors. However, you didn\u2019t really know <i>who</i> he actually was.</p><p>It was a promise you both made when you signed up for the job. You weren\u2019t gonna let your personal lives get mixed with your hero lives. It was sensible, but it didn\u2019t keep you from wondering what he looked like under than mask. You\u2019d be naive to assume he never thought the same.</p><p>Not long after, the two of you were standing on a rooftop, watching as the giant mechanical monster worked it\u2019s way towards the heart of Manhattan.</p><p>You breathed out an exasperated breath as you watched it. \u201cHydra again?\u201d </p><p>Spider-Man crossed his arms across his chest and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m assuming so. Looks tougher than last time though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a whimp.\u201d You shrugged, attempting to mask the worry in your own voice. \u201cYou ready to go, Spidey?\u201d</p><p>He looked from you, to the machine, then back to you. \u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d He held out his hand, ready for your famous handshake. </p><p>You smiled, following his lead before jumping into action.</p><p>~<strike><b>i can\u2019t write fight scenes help</b></strike>~</p><p>Nearly two hours later, you sat on the same rooftop from before as a bruised, sweaty, and bloody mess. You could feel the wounds healing due to your healing factor, but it hurt none the less.</p><p>Spider-man has dropped you off (per your command) and was dealing with the clean up and press. but you expected him to be back at any moment.</p><p>As if he had heard your thoughts, the masked web-slinger showed up. He landed on the rooftop, his body language showing how exhausted he really was. </p><p>He stumbled over to you, sliding down the same half wall you rested against. </p><p>\u201cBack from the red carpet?\u201d You quipped, trying to control your heaving breathing.</p><p>\u201cHar. Har.\u201d He mock laughed,  placing a hand over the burned scar on his abdomen while wincing. </p><p>He glanced at you, one of his fiberglass eye-lenses was cracked, giving you the first look at his real eyes you had ever seen. But there was something else, the tiny part of his cheek you could seen was\u2026pink? Was he blushing?</p><p>You shook your head. No, <i>of course not.</i> He was probably just worn out.</p><p>But his eyes didn\u2019t leave your figure. They were searching you, even though most of your face was covered (except for the parts now exposed from cuts and burns).</p><p>But there was something familiar about those eyes. Something that you couldn\u2019t put your together due to your hazy, tired mind. </p><p>Your partner seemed to be thinking something similar as you. But he gave up, resting his head back against the wall and sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He breathed, not looking at you. You didn\u2019t verbal reply, just looking at you with tired eyes. \u201cDo you like science?\u201d</p><p>You raised you eyebrow, mouth moving to open as you finally began to piece two and two together. </p><p>\u201cCuz I\u2019ve got my ion you.\u201d Laughing breathlessly at his joke, the hero attempted to lighten the mood. the effort caused him to wince several times during the process.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2026what the?\u201d You slowly sat up, eyes widening. \u201cPeter..?\u201d</p><p>The visible eye widened in shock. \u201cUh, uh.\u201d He cleared his throat, lowering his voice. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2014\u201c You pulled off you mask, eyes still wide with surprise. \u201cY/N?!!\u201d</p><p>Spider-man reached up and pulled up off his own mask, his eyes nearly as wide as yours. </p><p>There sat your childhood best friend, bruised from battle, with his mouth hanging wide open. </p><p>\u201cHow can this be?\u201d He asked, his voice going an octave higher as he stuttered. \u201cMy best friend is also my hero partner? That\u2019s crazy, i mean, what are the chances of that? And to think I stopped liking you because i thought i had no chance and I started liking your alter ego\u2014wait, shit.\u201d He covered his mouth with his hands.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026?\u201d Leaning towards him, your voice fell to just barely above a whisper. \u201cYou like\u2026me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2026\u201d He glanced at you and pushed back his messy curls from his forehead. \u201cYes\u2026I like you. I\u2019ve liked you ever since we met.\u201d He admitted sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d You asked softly, already knowing the reason.</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2026you just seemed so out of my league.\u201d He glanced down at his hands, fidgeting nervously with the webshooters. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, sweet, kind, and absolutely beautiful. Plus we have such an amazing friendship I\u2014\u201c He took a deep breath when you placed your own hand over his, slowly interlocking them.</p><p>He looked up at you, a sudden wave of boldness washing through his veins. \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t wanna <i>just</i> be your friend.\u201d </p><p>His free hand moved up to cup your cheek; his eyes glanced from your eyes to your lips. \u201cI want to be <i>more</i>.\u201d He breathed.</p><p>You didn\u2019t reply, your actions speaking for you as you leaned closer to him. </p><p>\u201cCan I..?\u201d Peter asked, unsure suddenly as doubts began to flood his mind. </p><p>You could tell he was about to say something else, but before he could say anything, you gently pressed your lips against his. </p><p>And suddenly a beautiful feeling washed over you. Those butterflies you had been holding onto seemed to burst into freedom. Your lips moved in sync, like they were made to be together.</p><p>Peter\u2019s hands found your hips naturally, holding onto you as if you were his lifeline. You hands wrapped around his neck, fingers twirling gently in his soft hair.</p><p>Pulling back for hair, your chests heaved, but you kept your forehead pressed against his.</p><p>\u201cHey Pete?\u201d You asked softly.</p><p>He hummed in response, face still red and heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cI think\u2026I <i>love you</i>.\u201d You whispered now only a few centimeters from his lips.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart skipped a beat when you said those words. Those magical words he never thought he would hear you say.   He bit his lips, savoring the sound of you saying it play over and over in his mind. </p><p>\u201cCan you..\u201d He hesitated. \u201cCan you say that again?\u201d </p><p>Your eyebrows bumped together as you leaned back to get a better look at him. \u201cI love you?\u201d</p><p>Like a giddy middle school girl, he fell backwards, nearly giggling from all the emotions that were coursing through him. </p><p>\u201cOh my <i>god</i>, Y/N!\u201d He laughed, covering his face with his hands before jumping up. </p><p>\u201cI love you. I <i>love</i> you. <i>I love you</i>!\u201d He laughed, forgetting all previous pain. You looked at him, smiling at how genuinely happy he was. He reached a hand out to you, pulling you up.</p><p>He twirled you around, causing you to giggle at his pure reaction to the event. Coming back in from the twirl, you wrapped your arms around his torso, hugging him tightly. </p><p>He laughed softly, resting his head in the crook of your neck, beaming like a little kid in a candy store.</p><p>\u201cAre you less than 90 degrees?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeter, don\u2019t you <i>dare</i>\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cCause you\u2019re acute girl!\u201d He laughed, and you pushed away from him, punching his chest (lightly of course). He laughed, giving you the biggest grin possible. \u201cYou know you love me.\u201d He smirked, winking at you.</p><p>You blushed, shaking your head as you crossed your arms. \u201cYeah..\u201d You huffed. \u201cYeah I love you..\u201d</p><p>You smiled at each other, getting lost in the magic of the night. </p></p>",

That&rsquo;s crazy, i mean, what are the chances of that? And to think I stopped liking you because i thought i had no chance and I started liking your alter ego&mdash;wait, shit.&rdquo; He covered his mouth with his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter&hellip;?&rdquo; Leaning towards him, your voice fell to just barely above a whisper. &ldquo;You like&hellip;me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&hellip;&rdquo; He glanced at you and pushed back his messy curls from his forehead. &ldquo;Yes&hellip;I like you. I&rsquo;ve liked you ever since we met.&rdquo; He admitted sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; You asked softly, already knowing the reason.</p><p>&ldquo;Because&hellip;you just seemed so out of my league.&rdquo; He glanced down at his hands, fidgeting nervously with the webshooters. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing, sweet, kind, and absolutely beautiful. Plus we have such an amazing friendship I&mdash;&ldquo; He took a deep breath when you placed your own hand over his, slowly interlocking them.</p><p>He looked up at you, a sudden wave of boldness washing through his veins. &ldquo;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t wanna <i>just</i> be your friend.&rdquo; </p><p>His free hand moved up to cup your cheek; his eyes glanced from your eyes to your lips. &ldquo;I want to be <i>more</i>.&rdquo; He breathed.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t reply, your actions speaking for you as you leaned closer to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I..?&rdquo; Peter asked, unsure suddenly as doubts began to flood his mind. </p><p>You could tell he was about to say something else, but before he could say anything, you gently pressed your lips against his. </p><p>And suddenly a beautiful feeling washed over you. Those butterflies you had been holding onto seemed to burst into freedom. Your lips moved in sync, like they were made to be together.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s hands found your hips naturally, holding onto you as if you were his lifeline. You hands wrapped around his neck, fingers twirling gently in his soft hair.</p><p>Pulling back for hair, your chests heaved, but you kept your forehead pressed against his.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Pete?&rdquo; You asked softly.</p><p>He hummed in response, face still red and heart pounding.</p><p>&ldquo;I think&hellip;I <i>love you</i>.&rdquo; You whispered now only a few centimeters from his lips.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat when you said those words. Those magical words he never thought he would hear you say.   He bit his lips, savoring the sound of you saying it play over and over in his mind. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you..&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;Can you say that again?&rdquo; </p><p>Your eyebrows bumped together as you leaned back to get a better look at him. &ldquo;I love you?&rdquo;</p><p>Like a giddy middle school girl, he fell backwards, nearly giggling from all the emotions that were coursing through him. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my <i>god</i>, Y/N!&rdquo; He laughed, covering his face with his hands before jumping up. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you. I <i>love</i> you. <i>I love you</i>!&rdquo; He laughed, forgetting all previous pain. You looked at him, smiling at how genuinely happy he was. He reached a hand out to you, pulling you up.</p><p>He twirled you around, causing you to giggle at his pure reaction to the event. Coming back in from the twirl, you wrapped your arms around his torso, hugging him tightly. </p><p>He laughed softly, resting his head in the crook of your neck, beaming like a little kid in a candy store.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you less than 90 degrees?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Peter, don&rsquo;t you <i>dare</i>&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cause you&rsquo;re acute girl!&rdquo; He laughed, and you pushed away from him, punching his chest (lightly of course). He laughed, giving you the biggest grin possible. &ldquo;You know you love me.&rdquo; He smirked, winking at you.</p><p>You blushed, shaking your head as you crossed your arms. &ldquo;Yeah..&rdquo; You huffed. &ldquo;Yeah I love you..&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled at each other, getting lost in the magic of the night. </p></p>",
