Also, contrary to some beliefs, it is not a yaoi style comic. The comic focuses on the two men\u2019s relationship and mentions sex very lowkey maybe twice. And it doesn\u2019t just have lgbt men! There\u2019s also a canon lesbian woman, and many extra characters that are all lgbt. Literally an entire group. (you\u2019ll understand once you read it). Even in the 18+ zines, there is both male and female content.</p><ul><li>It shows a healthy relationship!</li></ul><p>          The two men have a healthy relationship filled with communication and true love! They work things out and talk. It\u2019s the healthiest lgbt relationship I\u2019ve seen portrayed in media. </p><ul><li>It shows mental health!</li></ul><p>          Jack (the second main character) deals with clinical anxiety. (However there is a trigger warning. He overdoses in a flashback but it doesn\u2019t show it. He lives.) Also, there is a character who shows clear symptoms of borderline personality disorder (I\u2019m not sure if it was intentional or not).</p><ul><li>It shows how one of the characters got out of a past toxic relationship and how he\u2019s dealing with it!</li></ul><p>           As a person who has been in a toxic relationship like that, it handles it really well. A lot of works of media don\u2019t. The character realizes that the relationship was bad and talks about how neither of them were innocent and that they owe each other a lot of apologies.</p><ul><li>It is written by an African-American woman!</li></ul><p>          Ngozi Ukazu is an amazing woman who is so talented! It\u2019s really important to give women (especially women of color) support! Her comic Check Please is the most popular indie comic as well! </p><ul><li>There\u2019s tons of representation!</li></ul><p>          Gay! Lesbian! Bi! African-American! African-Canadian! Latino! Asian! Native American! Biracial! Possible Jewish character! A character who comes from a working class family with money problems!

Because of that, Terri likely had time to map out where she wanted things to go so that we could get a satisfying ending just in case. And also because of that, nobody else involved in the show held back. The budget for this season was insane, and we see that through the cinematography in every single episode. The cast put on their absolute best performances, and you can tell that their heart went into everything they did this season. Of course there were some really rough obstacles and circumstances that everyone had to overcome, but they were given the opportunity to push through and give this beautiful show the treatment it deserved until the very end.

I can\u2019t imagine a scenario in which it could actually work well without cheapening the overall experience of the series. Every single companion film to a Disney Channel series is some sort of stand-alone destination story, usually involving a vacation, because that is one of the only ways to raise the stakes for a TV movie. Lizzie McGuire, Hannah Montana, The Proud Family, Even Stevens, Wizards of Waverly Place - all vacation movies.

And as a concept, I LOVED that idea. But I don\u2019t trust that the execution would be good enough to make adding a movie onto the end of this series would ever be worth it.

We are so lucky with this season, because it really seems like everyone went into it prepared for it to be the last. Because of that, Terri likely had time to map out where she wanted things to go so that we could get a satisfying ending just in case. And also because of that, nobody else involved in the show held back. The budget for this season was insane, and we see that through the cinematography in every single episode. The cast put on their absolute best performances, and you can tell that their heart went into everything they did this season. Of course there were some really rough obstacles and circumstances that everyone had to overcome, but they were given the opportunity to push through and give this beautiful show the treatment it deserved until the very end.

Every single companion film to a Disney Channel series is some sort of stand-alone destination story, usually involving a vacation, because that is one of the only ways to raise the stakes for a TV movie.
