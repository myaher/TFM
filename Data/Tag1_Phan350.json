His father\u2019s condition was worsening quickly, he explained to Dan, so they haven\u2019t got the chance to see each other, making do with texts and brief phone calls. Dan suggested they skip the party, feeling that going out to celebrate might not be appropriate with everything that was going on, but Phil insisted they should go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly why we should go,\u201d Phil told him over the phone, voice exhausted and words a little slurred. \u201cI could use a break if I\u2019m honest.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Dan didn\u2019t try to argue. The way in which Phil handled the tragedies in his family was still confusing to him, still caught him off guard from time to time, but he came to accept it. It made his heart ache, thinking about how Phil was already used to this. How his dad was just another person their family \u201ccurse\u201d was going to eventually take. But he tried not to think about it too much. He knew how much he himself hated when people questioned his way of dealing with Oliver\u2019s death, and he didn\u2019t want to do the same to Phil.</p><p>When the door finally opened, Dan was met with the sight of Martyn, looking him up and down. Martyn was wearing his weird, trousers/skirt again, a colorful jumper and a big, welcoming smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you looking dapper?\u201d Martyn said, making Dan\u2019s cheeks heat a little under his blunt stare.</p><p>Dan was wearing a button down black shirt, black coat, his regular skinny jeans and his best looking dress shoes. He was pretty happy with himself when he looked at the mirror before heading out, nodding at his reflection with approval. But Martyn\u2019s tone always had a layer of tease to it, which managed, sometimes, to make Dan a little flustered.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, following Martyn inside.</p><p>\u201cPhil! Your date is here! All dressed up for you!\u201d Martyn called once they were inside, closing the door after them and moving towards the lounge with Dan strolling behind him, sitting down on the couch.</p><p>There was a loud bang noise coming from Phil\u2019s room, and a quick \u201cI\u2019m okay! Just a moment!\u201d following right after.</p><p>Dan haven\u2019t even seen him yet, but Phil was already making him smile, causing a flash of fondness to spread through his body. He really, genuinely, missed Phil a lot in the last 2 days, and it made him even more excited to spend New Year\u2019s Eve with him.</p><p>\u201che changed outfits like five times,\u201d Martyn said, looking at Dan with a look that was half amused half despaired, \u201cwhatever he ends up wearing, just tell him it looks good, please, if you don\u2019t want to spend the rest of your night here waiting for him to choose something else. \u201c</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Dan said, exchanging an amused look with Martyn.</p><p>From their first meeting, Dan felt like it was easy for him to get along with Martyn. They didn\u2019t have a lot in common, and Martyn had this strangely cool, a little bizarre aura around him that made Dan feel a little intimidated from time to time, but he felt like they both shared such a deep fondness towards Phil, a common desire to make him happy and content, that it made them automatically like each other. And maybe, Dan thought, Martyn was a little happy to take a step back, let someone else worry about Phil\u2019s well-being for a change.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for tonight?\u201d Dan asked him, when waiting for Phil turned out to take more than \u2018just a moment\u2019, sitting down on the couch as well.</p><p>Martyn looked almost surprised that Dan asked, but composed himself quickly, smiling a pleased smile. \u201cOh, Corn and I are going to a friend\u2019s place as well, it\u2019s a little out of town so we\u2019ll be staying there till tomorrow.\u201d he said, patting Dan\u2019s shoulder and smirking a bit. \u201cSo the place is all yours, mate.\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but let out a loud, nervous laugh. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, trying to cover the way Martyn\u2019s words were making something funny happen in his stomach.</p><p>It\u2019s not that the topic of sex embarrassed him, not really. But as much as Martyn was young and friendly, Dan still viewed him as a bit of a parental figure in Phil\u2019s life, and hearing him teasingly hint at the subject made him feel uncomfortably warm in his winter coat.</p><p>But to Dan\u2019s relief, at that moment Phil decided to finally enter the room, babbling \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ready!\u201d one hand subconsciously playing with the collar of his shirt.</p><p>He was wearing a salmon colored jumper with big white cat whiskers on it. Under the jumper, he had a white button down shirt buttoned all the way to the last button, and his usual skinny jeans and white sneakers. Dan had no idea how someone could look so cute in his eyes, and yet so handsome, all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Phil said softly once his and Dan\u2019s eyes locked, and Dan could feel a smile spreading on his face.</p><p>\u201cHello yourself.\u201d Dan got up and made his way to Phil, pressing his lips to his in a quick peck, ignoring the disapproving noises Martyn was making behind him.</p><p>\u201cDo I look okay?\u201d Phil asked, before Dan had any chance to say something himself, pulling on the fabric of his jumper a little.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Dan reassured.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this like\u2026 too pale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I usually don\u2019t like wearing light colors, I\u2019m already too pale myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I really think it suits you.\u201d Dan let his hand trail from Phil\u2019s shoulder down his arm, linking their fingers when his hand found Phil\u2019s.</p><p>Phil\u2019s face perked up, smiling big at Dan. \u201cThank you! Cornelia bought me this jumper for Christmas, I\u2019ll tell her you approve,\u201d he said, swinging their linked hands from side to side. \u201cOh, and you look really good too, by the way. Really really good,\u201d Phil added, smiling cheekily at Dan.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you,\u201d Dan smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cArgh, you guys are disgusting, get out of here with your honeymoon phase,\u201d Martyn grumbled (even though Dan could clearly see from the corner of his eye that he was smiling), taking a pillow from the couch and throwing it at their direction.</p><p>Phil giggled, letting go of Dan\u2019s hand and sticking his tongue out at Martyn, making Martyn mirror the action. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going,\u201d Phil said, adjusting his collar again. \u201cWish Corn a happy new year for me.\u201d</p><p>Martyn let out a little whiny noise, stretching his arms out and making grabby hands towards Phil. \u201cWhat about me? Come give your brother a New Year\u2019s kiss,\u201d Martyn pouted exaggeratedly.</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes, but the smile on his face was big and fond. He walked towards the couch where Martyn was sitting, putting two hands on his shoulders and leaning down to give him a loud kiss on the forehead. \u201cHappy new year, I love you,\u201d he said, squeezing Martyn\u2019s shoulders before straightening up.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, little bro, have fun,\u201d Martyn said, and his voice was softer than Dan was used to hearing it, less teasing.</p><p>Dan found himself, not for the first time, a little jealous of Phil\u2019s and Martyn\u2019s relationship. Dan and his brother were never close. He used to blame it on their age difference, but at some point, when his brother grew up a bit, he knew it came down to a lack of effort on both sides. He loved his brother, the way a person has to love a family member, but they had no deeper connection than that.</p><p>Dan felt like, in the past, all the familial closeness he desired he got from his relationship with Oliver. And it wasn\u2019t like he and Oliver had a brotherly relationship, far from it (Dan felt uncomfortable even thinking about it in those terms), but he did provide Dan with all he craved for from his family \u2013 unconditional support, company, love and comfort. And somewhere along the way, he forgot that maybe his family, maybe Adrian, needed someone like that too. Needed an older brother like Martyn was to Phil.</p><p>He also knew that a big reason for Phil\u2019s and Martyn\u2019s closeness was their life circumstances. They went through a lot together, lost so much, and probably learned to appreciate each other more. And Martyn, Dan had to admit, was just a really good older brother. He took upon himself to care for Phil, to provide him stability (as much as was possible in their situation) and familial warmth. He felt responsible for Phil\u2019s well-being, even though Phil was an adult, and Dan admired that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Phil said, after putting his puffy coat and mittens on (he didn\u2019t put on a hat, in spite of Dan\u2019s insistence, saying he didn\u2019t want to mess up his hair).</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Dan echoed, following Phil outside.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>They took the bus to PJ\u2019s place, sitting near the back, Dan next to the window and Phil next to him. Phil didn\u2019t waste any time, cuddling up to Dan as soon as they sat down, wrapping his arms around Dan\u2019s arm and putting his head in his shoulders.</p><p>The bus was surprisingly empty, only a few other people who didn\u2019t pay them any attention, (except one young woman, who caught Dan\u2019s eyes and smiled at him politely, nodding her head a little).</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d Phil said, rubbing his cheek against Dan\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d Dan said, and he didn\u2019t even care how sincere he sounded. He did miss Phil, more than he thought was possible to miss someone in two days.</p><p>Phil lifted his head a little, looking at Dan with his big blue eyes and pursing his lips in a silent request. Dan didn\u2019t protest, leaning down and giving Phil a quick kiss, which seemed to leave Phil unsatisfied, letting out a whine, head-butting his shoulder and squeezing his arm.</p><p>Dan chuckled, reaching his hand up and pushing Phil\u2019s hair out of his face a little, kissing his forehead. \u201cSorry, but we\u2019re on the bus,\u201d Dan said, letting his hand slide down from Phil\u2019s forehead to his cheek, pinching it a little and making Phil let out another protesting sound.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to kiss you now!\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cBe patient baby.\u201d</p><p>At that Phil got quiet, lowering his head and burying it in Dan\u2019s shoulder again. Dan could feel the heat from Phil\u2019s face against the skin if his neck. \u201cYou can\u2019t call me that when you don\u2019t want me to kiss you. That\u2019s like\u2026 a rule. If you call me cute names I\u2019m going to snog your face off,\u201d Phil mumbled, muffled by Dan\u2019s skin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been warned.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled, trying to sound unaffected but failing miserably. \u201cNoted,\u201d he said.</p><p>_______________________</p><p>The drive took less than 30 minutes, and in that time Phil managed to doze off on Dan\u2019s shoulder, letting out little puffs of air against his neck. The young woman was still giving them little glances from her seat, but she was smiling a warm smile so Dan tried not to pay her too much attention.</p><p>When they got to their stop Dan woke Phil up with a little shake and dragged him off the bus quickly, earning himself a stream of barely audible mumbles.</p><p>Phil rubbed his eyes, yawning big and loud before attaching himself again to Dan\u2019s side, making it a little hard for Dan to walk.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Dan asked when Phil yawned for the third time.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go to the party? We can always head back, have a night in,\u201d Dan suggested, feeling a little guilty for dragging Phil out when he clearly needed the rest. They stopped walking, and Dan turned to look at Phil, trying to convey that the suggestion was a genuine one.</p><p>Phil shook his head, looking at Dan with much more focused eyes. \u201cNo, I want to go, I want you to have a fun night with your friends, and I want to meet them,\u201d he said, determined.</p><p>Phil looked sincere, and Dan could feel warmth spreading from his chest to the rest of his body. Here he was, spending his New Year\u2019s Eve with this adorable guy, who Dan knew was tired and spent and didn\u2019t even liked parties all that much, who still wanted to go and have fun for Dan\u2019s sake. To put it simply, Dan felt lucky. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Dan said, smiling at Phil and starting to walk again.</p><p>But to his surprise, Phil stopped him, grabbing the sleeve of his coat and making him turn back to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil\u2019s expression changed, looking a little sheepish, letting go of his sleeve and reaching up to play with the zipper of Dan\u2019s coat. \u201cJust\u2026 do you remember? What I said?\u201d He asked, not meeting Dan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Dan asked, feeling confused by the sudden change in the mood.</p><p>\u201cAbout\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d he trailed off, sneaking one of his hands down Dan\u2019s body and taking hold of Dan\u2019s hand, squeezing tightly and finally lifting his eyes up to look at him.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Dan certainly remembered. Spent the last 2 nights thinking about the odd request, and about Phil\u2019s intense look when he told Dan his \u201ccondition\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Dan said, squeezing back. \u201cI won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d Phil asked, and to Dan\u2019s surprise he sounded a little nervous.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan answered, trying to smile reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Phil studied his eyes for a moment before he smiled, his expression changing into a sly one. \u201cEven if you need to pee?\u201d Phil asked, his tone joking.</p><p>Dan shrugged. \u201cWe can leave a crack in the door. You\u2019ll reach as far as you can in and I\u2019ll reach as far as I can out, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled, and Dan felt quite pleased with himself for making him relax. He let go of Dan\u2019s hand, covering his face with his hands and shaking his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d he said, tone a little whiny.</p><p>Dan grabbed Phil\u2019s wrists, pulling them away from his face. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do, love,\u201d he said, taking a step closer to Phil.</p><p>Phil had an unreadable expression on his face, his intense eyes staring right at Dan\u2019s. \u201cI warned you about the cute names,\u201d he said eventually, and before Dan had a chance to react, Phil launched himself forward, kissing him with force, wrapping his arms around his neck.</p><p>Dan felt like the wind got knocked out of his lungs, and it took his a moment to register what was going on. But the street was empty and Phil\u2019s lips were soft and eager, and really, Dan had no desire to protest.</p><p>______________________</p><p>When they finally reached PJ\u2019s and Sophie\u2019s place, Phil was pressed closely to Dan&rsquo;s side, his cool hand was clutching Dan&rsquo;s tightly. He looked calm, smiling big and bright at Dan when he looked to see how he was doing.</p><p>There was music and sounds of people talking coming from inside the flat, but they were faint, which made Dan feel some relief. He knew Phil definitely didn&rsquo;t want to spend his night at a loud, headache inducing party, and even though he knew PJ&rsquo;s party most likely wouldn&rsquo;t be like that, he was still a little nervous.</p><p>He knocked on the door, squeezing Phil&rsquo;s hand a few times while waiting for it to open. The door was opened less than a minute later by a redheaded girl Dan vaguely recognized as one of Sophie\u2019s friends, who smiled at them politely when they greeted her, telling them PJ was in the kitchen before leaving to get back to her friends.</p><p>They took off their winter coats (Phil was laughing at Dan when he determinedly tried to do so without letting go of Phil\u2019s hand, switching his hold to the other hand to take down each sleeve, making the process very complicated but absolutely worth the huge happy smile on Phil&rsquo;s face).</p><p>When they were done, Dan tugged on Phil&rsquo;s hand to follow him, leading them to the kitchen area where they were met with the sight of PJ, taking out bottles from the fridge. PJ lifted his head up when he heard them approaching, a friendly smile finding its way to his face.</p><p>\u201cWell hello there, long time no see,\u201d PJ said, putting the bottle in his hand on the counter and wiping his damp hand on his jeans before making his way to them.</p><p>\u201cHey Peej,\u201d Dan greeted back, patting PJ awkwardly on the shoulder, (after stepping forward for a hug and then changing his mind, remembering Phil&rsquo;s hand in his). If PJ was surprised by the strange greeting, he definitely didn&rsquo;t show it. \u201cThis is Phil,\u201d Dan introduced, smiling at Phil with encouragement.</p><p>Phil was smiling big right back at PJ, but his cheeks were a little pink and his look a little distant, which made Dan feel alert. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, waving his unoccupied hand, \u201cI think we actually know each other? Kind of.\u201d</p><p>PJ looked confused for a second, looking at Phil intently, before his eyes blew wide in realization. \u201cOh! We do!\u201d He exclaimed, a genuine look of surprise on his face. \u201cGood to see you man, I like your new hair,\u201d PJ said, making Phil reach self-consciously to pet his black fringe.</p><p>\u201cThank you! I wasn&rsquo;t too sure about the length, but I like it black,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cNo no, it&rsquo;s a good length, don&rsquo;t worry,\u201d PJ reassured, leaving Dan feeling slightly confused, even if quite happy to see PJ and Phil seemed to get along.</p><p>PJ turned to look at Dan, his smile vaguely apologetic, as if he was saying sorry for confusing him. \u201cWe went to sixth form together. Both did A level art,\u201d PJ explained, gesturing towards Phil with his thumb. \u201cThis guy always had the strangest looking art, our teacher didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 She never did understand my creative mind,\u201d Phil said, shaking his head and making PJ laugh.</p><p>Dan laughed too. It wasn&rsquo;t hard for him to imagine that the art Phil produced probably wasn&rsquo;t the most conventional.</p><p>\u201cOh man, this is such a small world. How did you guys meet?\u201d PJ asked, gesturing to their joint hands.</p><p>\u201cWe had Greek mythology class together this semester,\u201d Dan answered, happy he could contribute something to the conversation.</p><p>PJ\u2019s eyes widened again, blinking in surprise. \u201cAre you in the same uni as us, Phil? I didn&rsquo;t know that.\u201d PJ exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cUmm, yeah I am. But it&rsquo;s okay! I took two gap years, so it&rsquo;s understandable you never saw me. Also I&rsquo;m absent a lot,\u201d Dan could feel Phil getting flustered, and was just about to change the subject when PJ spoke again.</p><p>\u201cRight\u201d he said, and his face had an unreadable expression on it that made Dan a little agitated for some reason, but he pushed the feeling aside. \u201cI&rsquo;m glad I got to see you now mate, it&rsquo;s been a long time, we need to catch up\u2019\u201d Phil smiled at him, nodding a little. \u201cGrab yourself something to drink yeah? I&rsquo;ll go back to the lounge, rescue Sophie from hosting by herself,\u201d he said, taking the bottle he took out earlier, raising it in a \u201ccheers\u201d motion before leaving to join the rest of his guests.</p><p>When PJ was out of the room Dan turned to Phil, squeezing his hand tightly. \u201cThat\u2019s such a strange coincidence,\u201d Dan said, studying Phil\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil said quietly, looking somewhere to the left of Dan\u2019s face, and Dan could feel an unexplainable pit of anxiety in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You looked a little uncomfortable,\u201d he asked. He needed Phil to say more. To explain why he looked so unreachable all of a sudden.</p><p>Phil shook his head in dismissal, finally focusing on Dan\u2019s eyes, making him relax a little. \u201cNo no, it\u2019s okay, just wasn&rsquo;t expecting to see him after all these years,\u201d he said, his unoccupied hand moving to Dan\u2019s collar, smoothing the material between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 Not get along or something?\u201d Dan asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, we actually did,\u201d Phil said, smiling. \u201cI told you I had\u2026 a bit of a reputation back in school. And people usually didn&rsquo;t really want to be my friends, at least if they weren&rsquo;t seeking\u2026 something else,\u201d Phil said, his eyes dropping to his own hand on Dan\u2019s collar, shrugging. And even though he tried to sound unbothered Dan knew he still was. \u201cBut PJ was always nice to me, we weren&rsquo;t really friends but he used to sit next to me in art class and talk to me about like\u2026 regular silly things. I was always looking forward to that.\u201d Phil said, lifting his eyes and looking at Dan again, scrunching his nose in a way that really shouldn&rsquo;t be as adorable as it was.</p><p>\u201cHere I go again, making everything more complicated than it should be,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIt&rsquo;s really okay. I just didn&rsquo;t expect to see him here, that&rsquo;s all,\u201d Phil said, and Dan hated that Phil still felt the need to down play things he was feeling in front of him.</p><p>But he said nothing, squeezing Phil&rsquo;s hand and leaning down to kiss his lips softly for a moment. \u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d Dan asked when he pulled away, pulling on Phil&rsquo;s hand to follow him to the fridge.</p><p>Phil smiled a happy smile, even if it didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes like usual, squeezing Dan&rsquo;s hand back. \u201cSomething sweet please.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed, rolling his eyes but bringing Phil\u2019s hand up to his lips for a quick kiss, making Phil beam at him.</p><p>\u201cOf course that&rsquo;s what you want.\u201d</p><p>_____________________________________</p><p>Dan found, quickly enough, that Phil\u2019s hand holding rule wasn\u2019t nearly as restricting as he thought it would be.</p><p>Sure, it was a little awkward greeting people, especially when he forgot about it a few times and ended up giving weird half gestures before remembering, getting some confused looks at the process.</p><p>But it was also nice, grounding.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand was extremely soft to touch, slightly smaller than Dan\u2019s and even after holding it for quite some time it still didn\u2019t feel too warm against his.</p><p>\u201cI moisturize,\u201d Phil said when Dan comment on the softness of his skin, his tongue getting a little loose after the 2 beers he had.</p><p>Phil also wasn\u2019t shy about cozying up to Dan, pressing closely and demanding attention. Usually, when they were in public, he did try to control Phil\u2019s clingy tendencies a little, as public displays of affection tended to get him unnecessarily flustered and a little embarrassed.</p><p>But this was a party, and PJ and Sophie were curled up together on the other sofa and so were a few other couples, and honestly, no one really seemed to care.</p><p>From time to time, people came over to talk to them. Dan knew most of the people there at least by face, introducing them to Phil and letting his strangely charming boyfriend lead the conversations, smiling fondly when he said something odd enough to make the other person look at Dan for guidance, earning only an amused shrug in return.</p><p>But for some reason, no one really stayed to talk to them for more them a few minutes, all making polite excuses to leave the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou just have an aura of a new, lovey dovey couple about you. Like you want to be left alone,\u201d PJ said to Dan. They were talking in the hallway, while Dan was waiting for Phil to come out of the bathroom. (Dan did suggest he\u2019d actually come and hold his hand while he peed, to which Phil whined loudly and covered his face again, making Dan feel like his heart might just explode out of his chest. He did, however, hover not far from the bathroom in the hallway, meeting PJ there when he went to take something from the other room).</p><p>\u201cI feel bad,\u201d Phil said later. They were sitting on a two seater sofa, their heads resting next to each other on the back cushions, face to face, hands linked together between them.</p><p>It was 3 minutes to midnight and all around them was a small buzz of excitement, people saying they should turn the TV on, to see the fireworks.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Dan asked. He was studying Phil\u2019s face closely for the last 20 minutes, noting every freckle, every smile line and every mole, letting his fingers go over the parts that felt extra special in his hazy mind, memorizing them by touch and making Phil giggle.</p><p>\u201cWe came here so you could have a fun night with your friends, but I ended up keeping you all to myself,\u201d he said, his blue eyes looking a little dark in the dim light of the room.</p><p>Dan smiled, closing his eyes when Phil\u2019s hand came up automatically, poking his dimple. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I think I mainly wanted to show you off a little anyway, let everyone see how lucky I am,\u201d he said, and while he said it, he realized how true his words were.</p><p>Sure, he wanted to see PJ, and spending the night with him and their university acquaintances was a nice way to spent New Year\u2019s Eve, but he realized that most of all he wanted everyone to see how happy he finally was, how happy Phil was making him.</p><p>How he wasn\u2019t really interested anymore in going to random pubs with them for the sole purpose of trying to meet new people, and going on one unsuccessful date after the other, looking for something he didn\u2019t actually think he\u2019ll get to find again after losing it once before.</p><p>He finally had what he was missing, and even though it made him feel a little bit childish, a little silly, he wanted everyone to see him like this; happy, content and with the greatest, most beautifully unique person by his side.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t say anything, but when people started the countdown leading to midnight, Dan opened his eyes and looked at him. He almost felt the need to close them again right after, because Phil\u2019s face was filled with so much emotion Dan wasn\u2019t quite sure how to take it all in.</p><p>There was softness in there, and something that looked like genuine awe and, dare he say, love, and Dan felt dizzy with it all.</p><p>It looked like Phil was about to say something, but the clock hit 12 and everyone cheered, and Phil just shook his head before letting go of Dan\u2019s hand and cupping his face, kissing him deep and slow, making Dan\u2019s breath hitch.</p><p>\u201cTake me home please,\u201d Phil said after pulling away, his face still only an inch away from Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Dan asked. His mind felt foggy and slow, but the instinct to take care of Phil was still there, strong as ever.</p><p>Phil shook his head, smiling. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said, kissing Dan again. \u201cBut I think we should really get home. I know how shy you are about PDA, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to appreciate what I\u2019m about to do to you if we won\u2019t get to a privet place soon.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><hr><p>Notes:</p><p>again, so sorry for the long wait guys, life was crazy, i&rsquo;ll try to update more often from now on :&rsquo;) <br/>please please tell me what you thought</p>",

His father\u2019s condition was worsening quickly, he explained to Dan, so they haven\u2019t got the chance to see each other, making do with texts and brief phone calls. Dan suggested they skip the party, feeling that going out to celebrate might not be appropriate with everything that was going on, but Phil insisted they should go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly why we should go,\u201d Phil told him over the phone, voice exhausted and words a little slurred. \u201cI could use a break if I\u2019m honest.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dan didn\u2019t try to argue. The way in which Phil handled the tragedies in his family was still confusing to him, still caught him off guard from time to time, but he came to accept it. It made his heart ache, thinking about how Phil was already used to this. How his dad was just another person their family \u201ccurse\u201d was going to eventually take. But he tried not to think about it too much. He knew how much he himself hated when people questioned his way of dealing with Oliver\u2019s death, and he didn\u2019t want to do the same to Phil.</p><p>When the door finally opened, Dan was met with the sight of Martyn, looking him up and down. Martyn was wearing his weird, trousers/skirt again, a colorful jumper and a big, welcoming smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you looking dapper?\u201d Martyn said, making Dan\u2019s cheeks heat a little under his blunt stare.</p><p>Dan was wearing a button down black shirt, black coat, his regular skinny jeans and his best looking dress shoes. He was pretty happy with himself when he looked at the mirror before heading out, nodding at his reflection with approval. But Martyn\u2019s tone always had a layer of tease to it, which managed, sometimes, to make Dan a little flustered.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, following Martyn inside.</p><p>\u201cPhil! Your date is here! All dressed up for you!\u201d Martyn called once they were inside, closing the door after them and moving towards the lounge with Dan strolling behind him, sitting down on the couch.</p><p>There was a loud bang noise coming from Phil\u2019s room, and a quick \u201cI\u2019m okay! Just a moment!\u201d following right after.</p><p>Dan haven\u2019t even seen him yet, but Phil was already making him smile, causing a flash of fondness to spread through his body. He really, genuinely, missed Phil a lot in the last 2 days, and it made him even more excited to spend New Year\u2019s Eve with him.</p><p>\u201che changed outfits like five times,\u201d Martyn said, looking at Dan with a look that was half amused half despaired, \u201cwhatever he ends up wearing, just tell him it looks good, please, if you don\u2019t want to spend the rest of your night here waiting for him to choose something else. \u201c</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Dan said, exchanging an amused look with Martyn.</p><p>From their first meeting, Dan felt like it was easy for him to get along with Martyn. They didn\u2019t have a lot in common, and Martyn had this strangely cool, a little bizarre aura around him that made Dan feel a little intimidated from time to time, but he felt like they both shared such a deep fondness towards Phil, a common desire to make him happy and content, that it made them automatically like each other. And maybe, Dan thought, Martyn was a little happy to take a step back, let someone else worry about Phil\u2019s well-being for a change.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for tonight?\u201d Dan asked him, when waiting for Phil turned out to take more than \u2018just a moment\u2019, sitting down on the couch as well.</p><p>Martyn looked almost surprised that Dan asked, but composed himself quickly, smiling a pleased smile. \u201cOh, Corn and I are going to a friend\u2019s place as well, it\u2019s a little out of town so we\u2019ll be staying there till tomorrow.\u201d he said, patting Dan\u2019s shoulder and smirking a bit. \u201cSo the place is all yours, mate.\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but let out a loud, nervous laugh. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, trying to cover the way Martyn\u2019s words were making something funny happen in his stomach.</p><p>It\u2019s not that the topic of sex embarrassed him, not really. But as much as Martyn was young and friendly, Dan still viewed him as a bit of a parental figure in Phil\u2019s life, and hearing him teasingly hint at the subject made him feel uncomfortably warm in his winter coat.</p><p>But to Dan\u2019s relief, at that moment Phil decided to finally enter the room, babbling \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ready!\u201d one hand subconsciously playing with the collar of his shirt.</p><p>He was wearing a salmon colored jumper with big white cat whiskers on it. Under the jumper, he had a white button down shirt buttoned all the way to the last button, and his usual skinny jeans and white sneakers. Dan had no idea how someone could look so cute in his eyes, and yet so handsome, all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Phil said softly once his and Dan\u2019s eyes locked, and Dan could feel a smile spreading on his face.</p><p>\u201cHello yourself.\u201d Dan got up and made his way to Phil, pressing his lips to his in a quick peck, ignoring the disapproving noises Martyn was making behind him.</p><p>\u201cDo I look okay?\u201d Phil asked, before Dan had any chance to say something himself, pulling on the fabric of his jumper a little.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Dan reassured.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this like\u2026 too pale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I usually don\u2019t like wearing light colors, I\u2019m already too pale myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I really think it suits you.\u201d Dan let his hand trail from Phil\u2019s shoulder down his arm, linking their fingers when his hand found Phil\u2019s.</p><p>Phil\u2019s face perked up, smiling big at Dan. \u201cThank you! Cornelia bought me this jumper for Christmas, I\u2019ll tell her you approve,\u201d he said, swinging their linked hands from side to side. \u201cOh, and you look really good too, by the way. Really really good,\u201d Phil added, smiling cheekily at Dan.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you,\u201d Dan smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cArgh, you guys are disgusting, get out of here with your honeymoon phase,\u201d Martyn grumbled (even though Dan could clearly see from the corner of his eye that he was smiling), taking a pillow from the couch and throwing it at their direction.</p><p>Phil giggled, letting go of Dan\u2019s hand and sticking his tongue out at Martyn, making Martyn mirror the action. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going,\u201d Phil said, adjusting his collar again. \u201cWish Corn a happy new year for me.\u201d</p><p>Martyn let out a little whiny noise, stretching his arms out and making grabby hands towards Phil. \u201cWhat about me? Come give your brother a New Year\u2019s kiss,\u201d Martyn pouted exaggeratedly.</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes, but the smile on his face was big and fond. He walked towards the couch where Martyn was sitting, putting two hands on his shoulders and leaning down to give him a loud kiss on the forehead. \u201cHappy new year, I love you,\u201d he said, squeezing Martyn\u2019s shoulders before straightening up.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, little bro, have fun,\u201d Martyn said, and his voice was softer than Dan was used to hearing it, less teasing.</p><p>Dan found himself, not for the first time, a little jealous of Phil\u2019s and Martyn\u2019s relationship. Dan and his brother were never close. He used to blame it on their age difference, but at some point, when his brother grew up a bit, he knew it came down to a lack of effort on both sides. He loved his brother, the way a person has to love a family member, but they had no deeper connection than that.</p><p>Dan felt like, in the past, all the familial closeness he desired he got from his relationship with Oliver. And it wasn\u2019t like he and Oliver had a brotherly relationship, far from it (Dan felt uncomfortable even thinking about it in those terms), but he did provide Dan with all he craved for from his family \u2013 unconditional support, company, love and comfort. And somewhere along the way, he forgot that maybe his family, maybe Adrian, needed someone like that too. Needed an older brother like Martyn was to Phil.</p><p>He also knew that a big reason for Phil\u2019s and Martyn\u2019s closeness was their life circumstances. They went through a lot together, lost so much, and probably learned to appreciate each other more. And Martyn, Dan had to admit, was just a really good older brother. He took upon himself to care for Phil, to provide him stability (as much as was possible in their situation) and familial warmth. He felt responsible for Phil\u2019s well-being, even though Phil was an adult, and Dan admired that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Phil said, after putting his puffy coat and mittens on (he didn\u2019t put on a hat, in spite of Dan\u2019s insistence, saying he didn\u2019t want to mess up his hair).</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Dan echoed, following Phil outside.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>They took the bus to PJ\u2019s place, sitting near the back, Dan next to the window and Phil next to him. Phil didn\u2019t waste any time, cuddling up to Dan as soon as they sat down, wrapping his arms around Dan\u2019s arm and putting his head in his shoulders.</p><p>The bus was surprisingly empty, only a few other people who didn\u2019t pay them any attention, (except one young woman, who caught Dan\u2019s eyes and smiled at him politely, nodding her head a little).</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d Phil said, rubbing his cheek against Dan\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d Dan said, and he didn\u2019t even care how sincere he sounded. He did miss Phil, more than he thought was possible to miss someone in two days.</p><p>Phil lifted his head a little, looking at Dan with his big blue eyes and pursing his lips in a silent request. Dan didn\u2019t protest, leaning down and giving Phil a quick kiss, which seemed to leave Phil unsatisfied, letting out a whine, head-butting his shoulder and squeezing his arm.</p><p>Dan chuckled, reaching his hand up and pushing Phil\u2019s hair out of his face a little, kissing his forehead. \u201cSorry, but we\u2019re on the bus,\u201d Dan said, letting his hand slide down from Phil\u2019s forehead to his cheek, pinching it a little and making Phil let out another protesting sound.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to kiss you now!\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cBe patient baby.\u201d</p><p>At that Phil got quiet, lowering his head and burying it in Dan\u2019s shoulder again. Dan could feel the heat from Phil\u2019s face against the skin if his neck. \u201cYou can\u2019t call me that when you don\u2019t want me to kiss you. That\u2019s like\u2026 a rule. If you call me cute names I\u2019m going to snog your face off,\u201d Phil mumbled, muffled by Dan\u2019s skin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been warned.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled, trying to sound unaffected but failing miserably. \u201cNoted,\u201d he said.</p><p>_______________________</p><p>The drive took less than 30 minutes, and in that time Phil managed to doze off on Dan\u2019s shoulder, letting out little puffs of air against his neck. The young woman was still giving them little glances from her seat, but she was smiling a warm smile so Dan tried not to pay her too much attention.</p><p>When they got to their stop Dan woke Phil up with a little shake and dragged him off the bus quickly, earning himself a stream of barely audible mumbles.</p><p>Phil rubbed his eyes, yawning big and loud before attaching himself again to Dan\u2019s side, making it a little hard for Dan to walk.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Dan asked when Phil yawned for the third time.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go to the party? We can always head back, have a night in,\u201d Dan suggested, feeling a little guilty for dragging Phil out when he clearly needed the rest. They stopped walking, and Dan turned to look at Phil, trying to convey that the suggestion was a genuine one.</p><p>Phil shook his head, looking at Dan with much more focused eyes. \u201cNo, I want to go, I want you to have a fun night with your friends, and I want to meet them,\u201d he said, determined.</p><p>Phil looked sincere, and Dan could feel warmth spreading from his chest to the rest of his body. Here he was, spending his New Year\u2019s Eve with this adorable guy, who Dan knew was tired and spent and didn\u2019t even liked parties all that much, who still wanted to go and have fun for Dan\u2019s sake. To put it simply, Dan felt lucky. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Dan said, smiling at Phil and starting to walk again.</p><p>But to his surprise, Phil stopped him, grabbing the sleeve of his coat and making him turn back to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil\u2019s expression changed, looking a little sheepish, letting go of his sleeve and reaching up to play with the zipper of Dan\u2019s coat. \u201cJust\u2026 do you remember? What I said?\u201d He asked, not meeting Dan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Dan asked, feeling confused by the sudden change in the mood.</p><p>\u201cAbout\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d he trailed off, sneaking one of his hands down Dan\u2019s body and taking hold of Dan\u2019s hand, squeezing tightly and finally lifting his eyes up to look at him.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Dan certainly remembered. Spent the last 2 nights thinking about the odd request, and about Phil\u2019s intense look when he told Dan his \u201ccondition\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Dan said, squeezing back. \u201cI won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d Phil asked, and to Dan\u2019s surprise he sounded a little nervous.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan answered, trying to smile reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Phil studied his eyes for a moment before he smiled, his expression changing into a sly one. \u201cEven if you need to pee?\u201d Phil asked, his tone joking.</p><p>Dan shrugged. \u201cWe can leave a crack in the door. You\u2019ll reach as far as you can in and I\u2019ll reach as far as I can out, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled, and Dan felt quite pleased with himself for making him relax. He let go of Dan\u2019s hand, covering his face with his hands and shaking his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d he said, tone a little whiny.</p><p>Dan grabbed Phil\u2019s wrists, pulling them away from his face. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do, love,\u201d he said, taking a step closer to Phil.</p><p>Phil had an unreadable expression on his face, his intense eyes staring right at Dan\u2019s. \u201cI warned you about the cute names,\u201d he said eventually, and before Dan had a chance to react, Phil launched himself forward, kissing him with force, wrapping his arms around his neck.</p><p>Dan felt like the wind got knocked out of his lungs, and it took his a moment to register what was going on. But the street was empty and Phil\u2019s lips were soft and eager, and really, Dan had no desire to protest.</p><p>______________________</p><p>When they finally reached PJ\u2019s and Sophie\u2019s place, Phil was pressed closely to Dan\u2019s side, his cool hand was clutching Dan\u2019s tightly. He looked calm, smiling big and bright at Dan when he looked to see how he was doing.</p><p>There was music and sounds of people talking coming from inside the flat, but they were faint, which made Dan feel some relief. He knew Phil definitely didn\u2019t want to spend his night at a loud, headache inducing party, and even though he knew PJ\u2019s party most likely wouldn\u2019t be like that, he was still a little nervous.</p><p>He knocked on the door, squeezing Phil\u2019s hand a few times while waiting for it to open. The door was opened less than a minute later by a redheaded girl Dan vaguely recognized as one of Sophie\u2019s friends, who smiled at them politely when they greeted her, telling them PJ was in the kitchen before leaving to get back to her friends.</p><p>They took off their winter coats (Phil was laughing at Dan when he determinedly tried to do so without letting go of Phil\u2019s hand, switching his hold to the other hand to take down each sleeve, making the process very complicated but absolutely worth the huge happy smile on Phil\u2019s face).</p><p>When they were done, Dan tugged on Phil\u2019s hand to follow him, leading them to the kitchen area where they were met with the sight of PJ, taking out bottles from the fridge. PJ lifted his head up when he heard them approaching, a friendly smile finding its way to his face.</p><p>\u201cWell hello there, long time no see,\u201d PJ said, putting the bottle in his hand on the counter and wiping his damp hand on his jeans before making his way to them.</p><p>\u201cHey Peej,\u201d Dan greeted back, patting PJ awkwardly on the shoulder, (after stepping forward for a hug and then changing his mind, remembering Phil\u2019s hand in his). If PJ was surprised by the strange greeting, he definitely didn\u2019t show it. \u201cThis is Phil,\u201d Dan introduced, smiling at Phil with encouragement.</p><p>Phil was smiling big right back at PJ, but his cheeks were a little pink and his look a little distant, which made Dan feel alert. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, waving his unoccupied hand, \u201cI think we actually know each other? Kind of.\u201d</p><p>PJ looked confused for a second, looking at Phil intently, before his eyes blew wide in realization. \u201cOh! We do!\u201d He exclaimed, a genuine look of surprise on his face. \u201cGood to see you man, I like your new hair,\u201d PJ said, making Phil reach self-consciously to pet his black fringe.</p><p>\u201cThank you! I wasn\u2019t too sure about the length, but I like it black,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cNo no, it\u2019s a good length, don\u2019t worry,\u201d PJ reassured, leaving Dan feeling slightly confused, even if quite happy to see PJ and Phil seemed to get along.</p><p>PJ turned to look at Dan, his smile vaguely apologetic, as if he was saying sorry for confusing him. \u201cWe went to sixth form together. Both did A level art,\u201d PJ explained, gesturing towards Phil with his thumb. \u201cThis guy always had the strangest looking art, our teacher didn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 She never did understand my creative mind,\u201d Phil said, shaking his head and making PJ laugh.</p><p>Dan laughed too. It wasn\u2019t hard for him to imagine that the art Phil produced probably wasn\u2019t the most conventional.</p><p>\u201cOh man, this is such a small world. How did you guys meet?\u201d PJ asked, gesturing to their joint hands.</p><p>\u201cWe had Greek mythology class together this semester,\u201d Dan answered, happy he could contribute something to the conversation.</p><p>PJ\u2019s eyes widened again, blinking in surprise. \u201cAre you in the same uni as us, Phil? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d PJ exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cUmm, yeah I am. But it\u2019s okay! I took two gap years, so it\u2019s understandable you never saw me. Also I\u2019m absent a lot,\u201d Dan could feel Phil getting flustered, and was just about to change the subject when PJ spoke again.</p><p>\u201cRight\u201d he said, and his face had an unreadable expression on it that made Dan a little agitated for some reason, but he pushed the feeling aside. \u201cI\u2019m glad I got to see you now mate, it\u2019s been a long time, we need to catch up\u2019\u201d Phil smiled at him, nodding a little. \u201cGrab yourself something to drink yeah? I\u2019ll go back to the lounge, rescue Sophie from hosting by herself,\u201d he said, taking the bottle he took out earlier, raising it in a \u201ccheers\u201d motion before leaving to join the rest of his guests.</p><p>When PJ was out of the room Dan turned to Phil, squeezing his hand tightly. \u201cThat\u2019s such a strange coincidence,\u201d Dan said, studying Phil\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil said quietly, looking somewhere to the left of Dan\u2019s face, and Dan could feel an unexplainable pit of anxiety in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You looked a little uncomfortable,\u201d he asked. He needed Phil to say more. To explain why he looked so unreachable all of a sudden.</p><p>Phil shook his head in dismissal, finally focusing on Dan\u2019s eyes, making him relax a little. \u201cNo no, it\u2019s okay, just wasn\u2019t expecting to see him after all these years,\u201d he said, his unoccupied hand moving to Dan\u2019s collar, smoothing the material between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 Not get along or something?\u201d Dan asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, we actually did,\u201d Phil said, smiling. \u201cI told you I had\u2026 a bit of a reputation back in school. And people usually didn\u2019t really want to be my friends, at least if they weren\u2019t seeking\u2026 something else,\u201d Phil said, his eyes dropping to his own hand on Dan\u2019s collar, shrugging. And even though he tried to sound unbothered Dan knew he still was. \u201cBut PJ was always nice to me, we weren\u2019t really friends but he used to sit next to me in art class and talk to me about like\u2026 regular silly things. I was always looking forward to that.\u201d Phil said, lifting his eyes and looking at Dan again, scrunching his nose in a way that really shouldn\u2019t be as adorable as it was.</p><p>\u201cHere I go again, making everything more complicated than it should be,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s really okay. I just didn\u2019t expect to see him here, that\u2019s all,\u201d Phil said, and Dan hated that Phil still felt the need to down play things he was feeling in front of him.</p><p>But he said nothing, squeezing Phil\u2019s hand and leaning down to kiss his lips softly for a moment. \u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d Dan asked when he pulled away, pulling on Phil\u2019s hand to follow him to the fridge.</p><p>Phil smiled a happy smile, even if it didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes like usual, squeezing Dan\u2019s hand back. \u201cSomething sweet please.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed, rolling his eyes but bringing Phil\u2019s hand up to his lips for a quick kiss, making Phil beam at him.</p><p>\u201cOf course that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>_____________________________________</p><p>Dan found, quickly enough, that Phil\u2019s hand holding rule wasn\u2019t nearly as restricting as he thought it would be.</p><p>Sure, it was a little awkward greeting people, especially when he forgot about it a few times and ended up giving weird half gestures before remembering, getting some confused looks at the process.</p><p>But it was also nice, grounding.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand was extremely soft to touch, slightly smaller than Dan\u2019s and even after holding it for quite some time it still didn\u2019t feel too warm against his.</p><p>\u201cI moisturize,\u201d Phil said when Dan comment on the softness of his skin, his tongue getting a little loose after the 2 beers he had.</p><p>Phil also wasn\u2019t shy about cozying up to Dan, pressing closely and demanding attention. Usually, when they were in public, he did try to control Phil\u2019s clingy tendencies a little, as public displays of affection tended to get him unnecessarily flustered and a little embarrassed.</p><p>But this was a party, and PJ and Sophie were curled up together on the other sofa and so were a few other couples, and honestly, no one really seemed to care.</p><p>From time to time, people came over to talk to them. Dan knew most of the people there at least by face, introducing them to Phil and letting his strangely charming boyfriend lead the conversations, smiling fondly when he said something odd enough to make the other person look at Dan for guidance, earning only an amused shrug in return.</p><p>But for some reason, no one really stayed to talk to them for more them a few minutes, all making polite excuses to leave the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou just have an aura of a new, lovey dovey couple about you. Like you want to be left alone,\u201d PJ said to Dan. They were talking in the hallway, while Dan was waiting for Phil to come out of the bathroom. (Dan did suggest he\u2019d actually come and hold his hand while he peed, to which Phil whined loudly and covered his face again, making Dan feel like his heart might just explode out of his chest. He did, however, hover not far from the bathroom in the hallway, meeting PJ there when he went to take something from the other room).</p><p>\u201cI feel bad,\u201d Phil said later. They were sitting on a two seater sofa, their heads resting next to each other on the back cushions, face to face, hands linked together between them.</p><p>It was 3 minutes to midnight and all around them was a small buzz of excitement, people saying they should turn the TV on, to see the fireworks.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Dan asked. He was studying Phil\u2019s face closely for the last 20 minutes, noting every freckle, every smile line and every mole, letting his fingers go over the parts that felt extra special in his hazy mind, memorizing them by touch and making Phil giggle.</p><p>\u201cWe came here so you could have a fun night with your friends, but I ended up keeping you all to myself,\u201d he said, his blue eyes looking a little dark in the dim light of the room.</p><p>Dan smiled, closing his eyes when Phil\u2019s hand came up automatically, poking his dimple. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I think I mainly wanted to show you off a little anyway, let everyone see how lucky I am,\u201d he said, and while he said it, he realized how true his words were.</p><p>Sure, he wanted to see PJ, and spending the night with him and their university acquaintances was a nice way to spent New Year\u2019s Eve, but he realized that most of all he wanted everyone to see how happy he finally was, how happy Phil was making him.</p><p>How he wasn\u2019t really interested anymore in going to random pubs with them for the sole purpose of trying to meet new people, and going on one unsuccessful date after the other, looking for something he didn\u2019t actually think he\u2019ll get to find again after losing it once before.</p><p>He finally had what he was missing, and even though it made him feel a little bit childish, a little silly, he wanted everyone to see him like this; happy, content and with the greatest, most beautifully unique person by his side.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t say anything, but when people started the countdown leading to midnight, Dan opened his eyes and looked at him. He almost felt the need to close them again right after, because Phil\u2019s face was filled with so much emotion Dan wasn\u2019t quite sure how to take it all in.</p><p>There was softness in there, and something that looked like genuine awe and, dare he say, love, and Dan felt dizzy with it all.</p><p>It looked like Phil was about to say something, but the clock hit 12 and everyone cheered, and Phil just shook his head before letting go of Dan\u2019s hand and cupping his face, kissing him deep and slow, making Dan\u2019s breath hitch.</p><p>\u201cTake me home please,\u201d Phil said after pulling away, his face still only an inch away from Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Dan asked. His mind felt foggy and slow, but the instinct to take care of Phil was still there, strong as ever.</p><p>Phil shook his head, smiling. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said, kissing Dan again. \u201cBut I think we should really get home. I know how shy you are about PDA, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to appreciate what I\u2019m about to do to you if we won\u2019t get to a privet place soon.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><hr><p>Notes:</p><p>again, so sorry for the long wait guys, life was crazy, i\u2019ll try to update more often from now on :\u2019) <br>please please tell me what you thought</p>",

His father\u2019s condition was worsening quickly, he explained to Dan, so they haven\u2019t got the chance to see each other, making do with texts and brief phone calls. Dan suggested they skip the party, feeling that going out to celebrate might not be appropriate with everything that was going on, but Phil insisted they should go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly why we should go,\u201d Phil told him over the phone, voice exhausted and words a little slurred. \u201cI could use a break if I\u2019m honest.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dan didn\u2019t try to argue. The way in which Phil handled the tragedies in his family was still confusing to him, still caught him off guard from time to time, but he came to accept it. It made his heart ache, thinking about how Phil was already used to this. How his dad was just another person their family \u201ccurse\u201d was going to eventually take. But he tried not to think about it too much. He knew how much he himself hated when people questioned his way of dealing with Oliver\u2019s death, and he didn\u2019t want to do the same to Phil.</p><p>When the door finally opened, Dan was met with the sight of Martyn, looking him up and down. Martyn was wearing his weird, trousers/skirt again, a colorful jumper and a big, welcoming smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you looking dapper?\u201d Martyn said, making Dan\u2019s cheeks heat a little under his blunt stare.</p><p>Dan was wearing a button down black shirt, black coat, his regular skinny jeans and his best looking dress shoes. He was pretty happy with himself when he looked at the mirror before heading out, nodding at his reflection with approval. But Martyn\u2019s tone always had a layer of tease to it, which managed, sometimes, to make Dan a little flustered.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, following Martyn inside.</p><p>\u201cPhil! Your date is here! All dressed up for you!\u201d Martyn called once they were inside, closing the door after them and moving towards the lounge with Dan strolling behind him, sitting down on the couch.</p><p>There was a loud bang noise coming from Phil\u2019s room, and a quick \u201cI\u2019m okay! Just a moment!\u201d following right after.</p><p>Dan haven\u2019t even seen him yet, but Phil was already making him smile, causing a flash of fondness to spread through his body. He really, genuinely, missed Phil a lot in the last 2 days, and it made him even more excited to spend New Year\u2019s Eve with him.</p><p>\u201che changed outfits like five times,\u201d Martyn said, looking at Dan with a look that was half amused half despaired, \u201cwhatever he ends up wearing, just tell him it looks good, please, if you don\u2019t want to spend the rest of your night here waiting for him to choose something else. \u201c</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Dan said, exchanging an amused look with Martyn.</p><p>From their first meeting, Dan felt like it was easy for him to get along with Martyn. They didn\u2019t have a lot in common, and Martyn had this strangely cool, a little bizarre aura around him that made Dan feel a little intimidated from time to time, but he felt like they both shared such a deep fondness towards Phil, a common desire to make him happy and content, that it made them automatically like each other. And maybe, Dan thought, Martyn was a little happy to take a step back, let someone else worry about Phil\u2019s well-being for a change.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for tonight?\u201d Dan asked him, when waiting for Phil turned out to take more than \u2018just a moment\u2019, sitting down on the couch as well.</p><p>Martyn looked almost surprised that Dan asked, but composed himself quickly, smiling a pleased smile. \u201cOh, Corn and I are going to a friend\u2019s place as well, it\u2019s a little out of town so we\u2019ll be staying there till tomorrow.\u201d he said, patting Dan\u2019s shoulder and smirking a bit. \u201cSo the place is all yours, mate.\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but let out a loud, nervous laugh. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, trying to cover the way Martyn\u2019s words were making something funny happen in his stomach.</p><p>It\u2019s not that the topic of sex embarrassed him, not really. But as much as Martyn was young and friendly, Dan still viewed him as a bit of a parental figure in Phil\u2019s life, and hearing him teasingly hint at the subject made him feel uncomfortably warm in his winter coat.</p><p>But to Dan\u2019s relief, at that moment Phil decided to finally enter the room, babbling \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ready!\u201d one hand subconsciously playing with the collar of his shirt.</p><p>He was wearing a salmon colored jumper with big white cat whiskers on it. Under the jumper, he had a white button down shirt buttoned all the way to the last button, and his usual skinny jeans and white sneakers. Dan had no idea how someone could look so cute in his eyes, and yet so handsome, all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Phil said softly once his and Dan\u2019s eyes locked, and Dan could feel a smile spreading on his face.</p><p>\u201cHello yourself.\u201d Dan got up and made his way to Phil, pressing his lips to his in a quick peck, ignoring the disapproving noises Martyn was making behind him.</p><p>\u201cDo I look okay?\u201d Phil asked, before Dan had any chance to say something himself, pulling on the fabric of his jumper a little.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Dan reassured.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this like\u2026 too pale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I usually don\u2019t like wearing light colors, I\u2019m already too pale myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I really think it suits you.\u201d Dan let his hand trail from Phil\u2019s shoulder down his arm, linking their fingers when his hand found Phil\u2019s.</p><p>Phil\u2019s face perked up, smiling big at Dan. \u201cThank you! Cornelia bought me this jumper for Christmas, I\u2019ll tell her you approve,\u201d he said, swinging their linked hands from side to side. \u201cOh, and you look really good too, by the way. Really really good,\u201d Phil added, smiling cheekily at Dan.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you,\u201d Dan smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cArgh, you guys are disgusting, get out of here with your honeymoon phase,\u201d Martyn grumbled (even though Dan could clearly see from the corner of his eye that he was smiling), taking a pillow from the couch and throwing it at their direction.</p><p>Phil giggled, letting go of Dan\u2019s hand and sticking his tongue out at Martyn, making Martyn mirror the action. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going,\u201d Phil said, adjusting his collar again. \u201cWish Corn a happy new year for me.\u201d</p><p>Martyn let out a little whiny noise, stretching his arms out and making grabby hands towards Phil. \u201cWhat about me? Come give your brother a New Year\u2019s kiss,\u201d Martyn pouted exaggeratedly.</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes, but the smile on his face was big and fond. He walked towards the couch where Martyn was sitting, putting two hands on his shoulders and leaning down to give him a loud kiss on the forehead. \u201cHappy new year, I love you,\u201d he said, squeezing Martyn\u2019s shoulders before straightening up.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, little bro, have fun,\u201d Martyn said, and his voice was softer than Dan was used to hearing it, less teasing.</p><p>Dan found himself, not for the first time, a little jealous of Phil\u2019s and Martyn\u2019s relationship. Dan and his brother were never close. He used to blame it on their age difference, but at some point, when his brother grew up a bit, he knew it came down to a lack of effort on both sides. He loved his brother, the way a person has to love a family member, but they had no deeper connection than that.</p><p>Dan felt like, in the past, all the familial closeness he desired he got from his relationship with Oliver. And it wasn\u2019t like he and Oliver had a brotherly relationship, far from it (Dan felt uncomfortable even thinking about it in those terms), but he did provide Dan with all he craved for from his family \u2013 unconditional support, company, love and comfort. And somewhere along the way, he forgot that maybe his family, maybe Adrian, needed someone like that too. Needed an older brother like Martyn was to Phil.</p><p>He also knew that a big reason for Phil\u2019s and Martyn\u2019s closeness was their life circumstances. They went through a lot together, lost so much, and probably learned to appreciate each other more. And Martyn, Dan had to admit, was just a really good older brother. He took upon himself to care for Phil, to provide him stability (as much as was possible in their situation) and familial warmth. He felt responsible for Phil\u2019s well-being, even though Phil was an adult, and Dan admired that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Phil said, after putting his puffy coat and mittens on (he didn\u2019t put on a hat, in spite of Dan\u2019s insistence, saying he didn\u2019t want to mess up his hair).</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Dan echoed, following Phil outside.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>They took the bus to PJ\u2019s place, sitting near the back, Dan next to the window and Phil next to him. Phil didn\u2019t waste any time, cuddling up to Dan as soon as they sat down, wrapping his arms around Dan\u2019s arm and putting his head in his shoulders.</p><p>The bus was surprisingly empty, only a few other people who didn\u2019t pay them any attention, (except one young woman, who caught Dan\u2019s eyes and smiled at him politely, nodding her head a little).</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d Phil said, rubbing his cheek against Dan\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d Dan said, and he didn\u2019t even care how sincere he sounded. He did miss Phil, more than he thought was possible to miss someone in two days.</p><p>Phil lifted his head a little, looking at Dan with his big blue eyes and pursing his lips in a silent request. Dan didn\u2019t protest, leaning down and giving Phil a quick kiss, which seemed to leave Phil unsatisfied, letting out a whine, head-butting his shoulder and squeezing his arm.</p><p>Dan chuckled, reaching his hand up and pushing Phil\u2019s hair out of his face a little, kissing his forehead. \u201cSorry, but we\u2019re on the bus,\u201d Dan said, letting his hand slide down from Phil\u2019s forehead to his cheek, pinching it a little and making Phil let out another protesting sound.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to kiss you now!\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cBe patient baby.\u201d</p><p>At that Phil got quiet, lowering his head and burying it in Dan\u2019s shoulder again. Dan could feel the heat from Phil\u2019s face against the skin if his neck. \u201cYou can\u2019t call me that when you don\u2019t want me to kiss you. That\u2019s like\u2026 a rule. If you call me cute names I\u2019m going to snog your face off,\u201d Phil mumbled, muffled by Dan\u2019s skin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been warned.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled, trying to sound unaffected but failing miserably. \u201cNoted,\u201d he said.</p><p>_______________________</p><p>The drive took less than 30 minutes, and in that time Phil managed to doze off on Dan\u2019s shoulder, letting out little puffs of air against his neck. The young woman was still giving them little glances from her seat, but she was smiling a warm smile so Dan tried not to pay her too much attention.</p><p>When they got to their stop Dan woke Phil up with a little shake and dragged him off the bus quickly, earning himself a stream of barely audible mumbles.</p><p>Phil rubbed his eyes, yawning big and loud before attaching himself again to Dan\u2019s side, making it a little hard for Dan to walk.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Dan asked when Phil yawned for the third time.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go to the party? We can always head back, have a night in,\u201d Dan suggested, feeling a little guilty for dragging Phil out when he clearly needed the rest. They stopped walking, and Dan turned to look at Phil, trying to convey that the suggestion was a genuine one.</p><p>Phil shook his head, looking at Dan with much more focused eyes. \u201cNo, I want to go, I want you to have a fun night with your friends, and I want to meet them,\u201d he said, determined.</p><p>Phil looked sincere, and Dan could feel warmth spreading from his chest to the rest of his body. Here he was, spending his New Year\u2019s Eve with this adorable guy, who Dan knew was tired and spent and didn\u2019t even liked parties all that much, who still wanted to go and have fun for Dan\u2019s sake. To put it simply, Dan felt lucky. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Dan said, smiling at Phil and starting to walk again.</p><p>But to his surprise, Phil stopped him, grabbing the sleeve of his coat and making him turn back to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil\u2019s expression changed, looking a little sheepish, letting go of his sleeve and reaching up to play with the zipper of Dan\u2019s coat. \u201cJust\u2026 do you remember? What I said?\u201d He asked, not meeting Dan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Dan asked, feeling confused by the sudden change in the mood.</p><p>\u201cAbout\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d he trailed off, sneaking one of his hands down Dan\u2019s body and taking hold of Dan\u2019s hand, squeezing tightly and finally lifting his eyes up to look at him.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Dan certainly remembered. Spent the last 2 nights thinking about the odd request, and about Phil\u2019s intense look when he told Dan his \u201ccondition\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Dan said, squeezing back. \u201cI won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d Phil asked, and to Dan\u2019s surprise he sounded a little nervous.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan answered, trying to smile reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Phil studied his eyes for a moment before he smiled, his expression changing into a sly one. \u201cEven if you need to pee?\u201d Phil asked, his tone joking.</p><p>Dan shrugged. \u201cWe can leave a crack in the door. You\u2019ll reach as far as you can in and I\u2019ll reach as far as I can out, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled, and Dan felt quite pleased with himself for making him relax. He let go of Dan\u2019s hand, covering his face with his hands and shaking his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d he said, tone a little whiny.</p><p>Dan grabbed Phil\u2019s wrists, pulling them away from his face. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do, love,\u201d he said, taking a step closer to Phil.</p><p>Phil had an unreadable expression on his face, his intense eyes staring right at Dan\u2019s. \u201cI warned you about the cute names,\u201d he said eventually, and before Dan had a chance to react, Phil launched himself forward, kissing him with force, wrapping his arms around his neck.</p><p>Dan felt like the wind got knocked out of his lungs, and it took his a moment to register what was going on. But the street was empty and Phil\u2019s lips were soft and eager, and really, Dan had no desire to protest.</p><p>______________________</p><p>When they finally reached PJ\u2019s and Sophie\u2019s place, Phil was pressed closely to Dan\u2019s side, his cool hand was clutching Dan\u2019s tightly. He looked calm, smiling big and bright at Dan when he looked to see how he was doing.</p><p>There was music and sounds of people talking coming from inside the flat, but they were faint, which made Dan feel some relief. He knew Phil definitely didn\u2019t want to spend his night at a loud, headache inducing party, and even though he knew PJ\u2019s party most likely wouldn\u2019t be like that, he was still a little nervous.</p><p>He knocked on the door, squeezing Phil\u2019s hand a few times while waiting for it to open. The door was opened less than a minute later by a redheaded girl Dan vaguely recognized as one of Sophie\u2019s friends, who smiled at them politely when they greeted her, telling them PJ was in the kitchen before leaving to get back to her friends.</p><p>They took off their winter coats (Phil was laughing at Dan when he determinedly tried to do so without letting go of Phil\u2019s hand, switching his hold to the other hand to take down each sleeve, making the process very complicated but absolutely worth the huge happy smile on Phil\u2019s face).</p><p>When they were done, Dan tugged on Phil\u2019s hand to follow him, leading them to the kitchen area where they were met with the sight of PJ, taking out bottles from the fridge. PJ lifted his head up when he heard them approaching, a friendly smile finding its way to his face.</p><p>\u201cWell hello there, long time no see,\u201d PJ said, putting the bottle in his hand on the counter and wiping his damp hand on his jeans before making his way to them.</p><p>\u201cHey Peej,\u201d Dan greeted back, patting PJ awkwardly on the shoulder, (after stepping forward for a hug and then changing his mind, remembering Phil\u2019s hand in his). If PJ was surprised by the strange greeting, he definitely didn\u2019t show it. \u201cThis is Phil,\u201d Dan introduced, smiling at Phil with encouragement.</p><p>Phil was smiling big right back at PJ, but his cheeks were a little pink and his look a little distant, which made Dan feel alert. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, waving his unoccupied hand, \u201cI think we actually know each other? Kind of.\u201d</p><p>PJ looked confused for a second, looking at Phil intently, before his eyes blew wide in realization. \u201cOh! We do!\u201d He exclaimed, a genuine look of surprise on his face. \u201cGood to see you man, I like your new hair,\u201d PJ said, making Phil reach self-consciously to pet his black fringe.</p><p>\u201cThank you! I wasn\u2019t too sure about the length, but I like it black,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cNo no, it\u2019s a good length, don\u2019t worry,\u201d PJ reassured, leaving Dan feeling slightly confused, even if quite happy to see PJ and Phil seemed to get along.</p><p>PJ turned to look at Dan, his smile vaguely apologetic, as if he was saying sorry for confusing him. \u201cWe went to sixth form together. Both did A level art,\u201d PJ explained, gesturing towards Phil with his thumb. \u201cThis guy always had the strangest looking art, our teacher didn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 She never did understand my creative mind,\u201d Phil said, shaking his head and making PJ laugh.</p><p>Dan laughed too. It wasn\u2019t hard for him to imagine that the art Phil produced probably wasn\u2019t the most conventional.</p><p>\u201cOh man, this is such a small world. How did you guys meet?\u201d PJ asked, gesturing to their joint hands.</p><p>\u201cWe had Greek mythology class together this semester,\u201d Dan answered, happy he could contribute something to the conversation.</p><p>PJ\u2019s eyes widened again, blinking in surprise. \u201cAre you in the same uni as us, Phil? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d PJ exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cUmm, yeah I am. But it\u2019s okay! I took two gap years, so it\u2019s understandable you never saw me. Also I\u2019m absent a lot,\u201d Dan could feel Phil getting flustered, and was just about to change the subject when PJ spoke again.</p><p>\u201cRight\u201d he said, and his face had an unreadable expression on it that made Dan a little agitated for some reason, but he pushed the feeling aside. \u201cI\u2019m glad I got to see you now mate, it\u2019s been a long time, we need to catch up\u2019\u201d Phil smiled at him, nodding a little. \u201cGrab yourself something to drink yeah? I\u2019ll go back to the lounge, rescue Sophie from hosting by herself,\u201d he said, taking the bottle he took out earlier, raising it in a \u201ccheers\u201d motion before leaving to join the rest of his guests.</p><p>When PJ was out of the room Dan turned to Phil, squeezing his hand tightly. \u201cThat\u2019s such a strange coincidence,\u201d Dan said, studying Phil\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil said quietly, looking somewhere to the left of Dan\u2019s face, and Dan could feel an unexplainable pit of anxiety in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You looked a little uncomfortable,\u201d he asked. He needed Phil to say more. To explain why he looked so unreachable all of a sudden.</p><p>Phil shook his head in dismissal, finally focusing on Dan\u2019s eyes, making him relax a little. \u201cNo no, it\u2019s okay, just wasn\u2019t expecting to see him after all these years,\u201d he said, his unoccupied hand moving to Dan\u2019s collar, smoothing the material between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 Not get along or something?\u201d Dan asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, we actually did,\u201d Phil said, smiling. \u201cI told you I had\u2026 a bit of a reputation back in school. And people usually didn\u2019t really want to be my friends, at least if they weren\u2019t seeking\u2026 something else,\u201d Phil said, his eyes dropping to his own hand on Dan\u2019s collar, shrugging. And even though he tried to sound unbothered Dan knew he still was. \u201cBut PJ was always nice to me, we weren\u2019t really friends but he used to sit next to me in art class and talk to me about like\u2026 regular silly things. I was always looking forward to that.\u201d Phil said, lifting his eyes and looking at Dan again, scrunching his nose in a way that really shouldn\u2019t be as adorable as it was.</p><p>\u201cHere I go again, making everything more complicated than it should be,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s really okay. I just didn\u2019t expect to see him here, that\u2019s all,\u201d Phil said, and Dan hated that Phil still felt the need to down play things he was feeling in front of him.</p><p>But he said nothing, squeezing Phil\u2019s hand and leaning down to kiss his lips softly for a moment. \u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d Dan asked when he pulled away, pulling on Phil\u2019s hand to follow him to the fridge.</p><p>Phil smiled a happy smile, even if it didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes like usual, squeezing Dan\u2019s hand back. \u201cSomething sweet please.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed, rolling his eyes but bringing Phil\u2019s hand up to his lips for a quick kiss, making Phil beam at him.</p><p>\u201cOf course that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>_____________________________________</p><p>Dan found, quickly enough, that Phil\u2019s hand holding rule wasn\u2019t nearly as restricting as he thought it would be.</p><p>Sure, it was a little awkward greeting people, especially when he forgot about it a few times and ended up giving weird half gestures before remembering, getting some confused looks at the process.</p><p>But it was also nice, grounding.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand was extremely soft to touch, slightly smaller than Dan\u2019s and even after holding it for quite some time it still didn\u2019t feel too warm against his.</p><p>\u201cI moisturize,\u201d Phil said when Dan comment on the softness of his skin, his tongue getting a little loose after the 2 beers he had.</p><p>Phil also wasn\u2019t shy about cozying up to Dan, pressing closely and demanding attention. Usually, when they were in public, he did try to control Phil\u2019s clingy tendencies a little, as public displays of affection tended to get him unnecessarily flustered and a little embarrassed.</p><p>But this was a party, and PJ and Sophie were curled up together on the other sofa and so were a few other couples, and honestly, no one really seemed to care.</p><p>From time to time, people came over to talk to them. Dan knew most of the people there at least by face, introducing them to Phil and letting his strangely charming boyfriend lead the conversations, smiling fondly when he said something odd enough to make the other person look at Dan for guidance, earning only an amused shrug in return.</p><p>But for some reason, no one really stayed to talk to them for more them a few minutes, all making polite excuses to leave the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou just have an aura of a new, lovey dovey couple about you. Like you want to be left alone,\u201d PJ said to Dan. They were talking in the hallway, while Dan was waiting for Phil to come out of the bathroom. (Dan did suggest he\u2019d actually come and hold his hand while he peed, to which Phil whined loudly and covered his face again, making Dan feel like his heart might just explode out of his chest. He did, however, hover not far from the bathroom in the hallway, meeting PJ there when he went to take something from the other room).</p><p>\u201cI feel bad,\u201d Phil said later. They were sitting on a two seater sofa, their heads resting next to each other on the back cushions, face to face, hands linked together between them.</p><p>It was 3 minutes to midnight and all around them was a small buzz of excitement, people saying they should turn the TV on, to see the fireworks.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Dan asked. He was studying Phil\u2019s face closely for the last 20 minutes, noting every freckle, every smile line and every mole, letting his fingers go over the parts that felt extra special in his hazy mind, memorizing them by touch and making Phil giggle.</p><p>\u201cWe came here so you could have a fun night with your friends, but I ended up keeping you all to myself,\u201d he said, his blue eyes looking a little dark in the dim light of the room.</p><p>Dan smiled, closing his eyes when Phil\u2019s hand came up automatically, poking his dimple. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I think I mainly wanted to show you off a little anyway, let everyone see how lucky I am,\u201d he said, and while he said it, he realized how true his words were.</p><p>Sure, he wanted to see PJ, and spending the night with him and their university acquaintances was a nice way to spent New Year\u2019s Eve, but he realized that most of all he wanted everyone to see how happy he finally was, how happy Phil was making him.</p><p>How he wasn\u2019t really interested anymore in going to random pubs with them for the sole purpose of trying to meet new people, and going on one unsuccessful date after the other, looking for something he didn\u2019t actually think he\u2019ll get to find again after losing it once before.</p><p>He finally had what he was missing, and even though it made him feel a little bit childish, a little silly, he wanted everyone to see him like this; happy, content and with the greatest, most beautifully unique person by his side.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t say anything, but when people started the countdown leading to midnight, Dan opened his eyes and looked at him. He almost felt the need to close them again right after, because Phil\u2019s face was filled with so much emotion Dan wasn\u2019t quite sure how to take it all in.</p><p>There was softness in there, and something that looked like genuine awe and, dare he say, love, and Dan felt dizzy with it all.</p><p>It looked like Phil was about to say something, but the clock hit 12 and everyone cheered, and Phil just shook his head before letting go of Dan\u2019s hand and cupping his face, kissing him deep and slow, making Dan\u2019s breath hitch.</p><p>\u201cTake me home please,\u201d Phil said after pulling away, his face still only an inch away from Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Dan asked. His mind felt foggy and slow, but the instinct to take care of Phil was still there, strong as ever.</p><p>Phil shook his head, smiling. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said, kissing Dan again. \u201cBut I think we should really get home. I know how shy you are about PDA, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to appreciate what I\u2019m about to do to you if we won\u2019t get to a privet place soon.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><hr><p>Notes:</p><p>again, so sorry for the long wait guys, life was crazy, i\u2019ll try to update more often from now on :\u2019) <br>please please tell me what you thought</p>",

His father&rsquo;s condition was worsening quickly, he explained to Dan, so they haven&rsquo;t got the chance to see each other, making do with texts and brief phone calls. Dan suggested they skip the party, feeling that going out to celebrate might not be appropriate with everything that was going on, but Phil insisted they should go.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly why we should go,&rdquo; Phil told him over the phone, voice exhausted and words a little slurred. &ldquo;I could use a break if I&rsquo;m honest.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t try to argue. The way in which Phil handled the tragedies in his family was still confusing to him, still caught him off guard from time to time, but he came to accept it. It made his heart ache, thinking about how Phil was already used to this. How his dad was just another person their family &ldquo;curse&rdquo; was going to eventually take. But he tried not to think about it too much. He knew how much he himself hated when people questioned his way of dealing with Oliver&rsquo;s death, and he didn&rsquo;t want to do the same to Phil.</p><p>When the door finally opened, Dan was met with the sight of Martyn, looking him up and down. Martyn was wearing his weird, trousers/skirt again, a colorful jumper and a big, welcoming smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you looking dapper?&rdquo; Martyn said, making Dan&rsquo;s cheeks heat a little under his blunt stare.</p><p>Dan was wearing a button down black shirt, black coat, his regular skinny jeans and his best looking dress shoes. He was pretty happy with himself when he looked at the mirror before heading out, nodding at his reflection with approval. But Martyn&rsquo;s tone always had a layer of tease to it, which managed, sometimes, to make Dan a little flustered.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, following Martyn inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil! Your date is here! All dressed up for you!&rdquo; Martyn called once they were inside, closing the door after them and moving towards the lounge with Dan strolling behind him, sitting down on the couch.</p><p>There was a loud bang noise coming from Phil&rsquo;s room, and a quick &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay! Just a moment!&rdquo; following right after.</p><p>Dan haven&rsquo;t even seen him yet, but Phil was already making him smile, causing a flash of fondness to spread through his body. He really, genuinely, missed Phil a lot in the last 2 days, and it made him even more excited to spend New Year&rsquo;s Eve with him.</p><p>&ldquo;he changed outfits like five times,&rdquo; Martyn said, looking at Dan with a look that was half amused half despaired, &ldquo;whatever he ends up wearing, just tell him it looks good, please, if you don&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of your night here waiting for him to choose something else. &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will do,&rdquo; Dan said, exchanging an amused look with Martyn.</p><p>From their first meeting, Dan felt like it was easy for him to get along with Martyn. They didn&rsquo;t have a lot in common, and Martyn had this strangely cool, a little bizarre aura around him that made Dan feel a little intimidated from time to time, but he felt like they both shared such a deep fondness towards Phil, a common desire to make him happy and content, that it made them automatically like each other. And maybe, Dan thought, Martyn was a little happy to take a step back, let someone else worry about Phil&rsquo;s well-being for a change.</p><p>&ldquo;What are your plans for tonight?&rdquo; Dan asked him, when waiting for Phil turned out to take more than &lsquo;just a moment&rsquo;, sitting down on the couch as well.</p><p>Martyn looked almost surprised that Dan asked, but composed himself quickly, smiling a pleased smile. &ldquo;Oh, Corn and I are going to a friend&rsquo;s place as well, it&rsquo;s a little out of town so we&rsquo;ll be staying there till tomorrow.&rdquo; he said, patting Dan&rsquo;s shoulder and smirking a bit. &ldquo;So the place is all yours, mate.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but let out a loud, nervous laugh. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, trying to cover the way Martyn&rsquo;s words were making something funny happen in his stomach.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that the topic of sex embarrassed him, not really. But as much as Martyn was young and friendly, Dan still viewed him as a bit of a parental figure in Phil&rsquo;s life, and hearing him teasingly hint at the subject made him feel uncomfortably warm in his winter coat.</p><p>But to Dan&rsquo;s relief, at that moment Phil decided to finally enter the room, babbling &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m ready!&rdquo; one hand subconsciously playing with the collar of his shirt.</p><p>He was wearing a salmon colored jumper with big white cat whiskers on it. Under the jumper, he had a white button down shirt buttoned all the way to the last button, and his usual skinny jeans and white sneakers. Dan had no idea how someone could look so cute in his eyes, and yet so handsome, all at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Phil said softly once his and Dan&rsquo;s eyes locked, and Dan could feel a smile spreading on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello yourself.&rdquo; Dan got up and made his way to Phil, pressing his lips to his in a quick peck, ignoring the disapproving noises Martyn was making behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I look okay?&rdquo; Phil asked, before Dan had any chance to say something himself, pulling on the fabric of his jumper a little.</p><p>&ldquo;You look great,&rdquo; Dan reassured.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this like&hellip; too pale?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I usually don&rsquo;t like wearing light colors, I&rsquo;m already too pale myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I really think it suits you.&rdquo; Dan let his hand trail from Phil&rsquo;s shoulder down his arm, linking their fingers when his hand found Phil&rsquo;s.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s face perked up, smiling big at Dan. &ldquo;Thank you! Cornelia bought me this jumper for Christmas, I&rsquo;ll tell her you approve,&rdquo; he said, swinging their linked hands from side to side. &ldquo;Oh, and you look really good too, by the way. Really really good,&rdquo; Phil added, smiling cheekily at Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, thank you,&rdquo; Dan smiled back at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Argh, you guys are disgusting, get out of here with your honeymoon phase,&rdquo; Martyn grumbled (even though Dan could clearly see from the corner of his eye that he was smiling), taking a pillow from the couch and throwing it at their direction.</p><p>Phil giggled, letting go of Dan&rsquo;s hand and sticking his tongue out at Martyn, making Martyn mirror the action. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; Phil said, adjusting his collar again. &ldquo;Wish Corn a happy new year for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Martyn let out a little whiny noise, stretching his arms out and making grabby hands towards Phil. &ldquo;What about me? Come give your brother a New Year&rsquo;s kiss,&rdquo; Martyn pouted exaggeratedly.</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes, but the smile on his face was big and fond. He walked towards the couch where Martyn was sitting, putting two hands on his shoulders and leaning down to give him a loud kiss on the forehead. &ldquo;Happy new year, I love you,&rdquo; he said, squeezing Martyn&rsquo;s shoulders before straightening up.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you too, little bro, have fun,&rdquo; Martyn said, and his voice was softer than Dan was used to hearing it, less teasing.</p><p>Dan found himself, not for the first time, a little jealous of Phil&rsquo;s and Martyn&rsquo;s relationship. Dan and his brother were never close. He used to blame it on their age difference, but at some point, when his brother grew up a bit, he knew it came down to a lack of effort on both sides. He loved his brother, the way a person has to love a family member, but they had no deeper connection than that.</p><p>Dan felt like, in the past, all the familial closeness he desired he got from his relationship with Oliver. And it wasn&rsquo;t like he and Oliver had a brotherly relationship, far from it (Dan felt uncomfortable even thinking about it in those terms), but he did provide Dan with all he craved for from his family &ndash; unconditional support, company, love and comfort. And somewhere along the way, he forgot that maybe his family, maybe Adrian, needed someone like that too. Needed an older brother like Martyn was to Phil.</p><p>He also knew that a big reason for Phil&rsquo;s and Martyn&rsquo;s closeness was their life circumstances. They went through a lot together, lost so much, and probably learned to appreciate each other more. And Martyn, Dan had to admit, was just a really good older brother. He took upon himself to care for Phil, to provide him stability (as much as was possible in their situation) and familial warmth. He felt responsible for Phil&rsquo;s well-being, even though Phil was an adult, and Dan admired that.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Phil said, after putting his puffy coat and mittens on (he didn&rsquo;t put on a hat, in spite of Dan&rsquo;s insistence, saying he didn&rsquo;t want to mess up his hair).</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Dan echoed, following Phil outside.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>They took the bus to PJ&rsquo;s place, sitting near the back, Dan next to the window and Phil next to him. Phil didn&rsquo;t waste any time, cuddling up to Dan as soon as they sat down, wrapping his arms around Dan&rsquo;s arm and putting his head in his shoulders.</p><p>The bus was surprisingly empty, only a few other people who didn&rsquo;t pay them any attention, (except one young woman, who caught Dan&rsquo;s eyes and smiled at him politely, nodding her head a little).</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you so much,&rdquo; Phil said, rubbing his cheek against Dan&rsquo;s coat.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too,&rdquo; Dan said, and he didn&rsquo;t even care how sincere he sounded. He did miss Phil, more than he thought was possible to miss someone in two days.</p><p>Phil lifted his head a little, looking at Dan with his big blue eyes and pursing his lips in a silent request. Dan didn&rsquo;t protest, leaning down and giving Phil a quick kiss, which seemed to leave Phil unsatisfied, letting out a whine, head-butting his shoulder and squeezing his arm.</p><p>Dan chuckled, reaching his hand up and pushing Phil&rsquo;s hair out of his face a little, kissing his forehead. &ldquo;Sorry, but we&rsquo;re on the bus,&rdquo; Dan said, letting his hand slide down from Phil&rsquo;s forehead to his cheek, pinching it a little and making Phil let out another protesting sound.</p><p>&ldquo;But I want to kiss you now!&rdquo; he whined.</p><p>&ldquo;Be patient baby.&rdquo;</p><p>At that Phil got quiet, lowering his head and burying it in Dan&rsquo;s shoulder again. Dan could feel the heat from Phil&rsquo;s face against the skin if his neck. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t call me that when you don&rsquo;t want me to kiss you. That&rsquo;s like&hellip; a rule. If you call me cute names I&rsquo;m going to snog your face off,&rdquo; Phil mumbled, muffled by Dan&rsquo;s skin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been warned.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan chuckled, trying to sound unaffected but failing miserably. &ldquo;Noted,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>_______________________</p><p>The drive took less than 30 minutes, and in that time Phil managed to doze off on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder, letting out little puffs of air against his neck. The young woman was still giving them little glances from her seat, but she was smiling a warm smile so Dan tried not to pay her too much attention.</p><p>When they got to their stop Dan woke Phil up with a little shake and dragged him off the bus quickly, earning himself a stream of barely audible mumbles.</p><p>Phil rubbed his eyes, yawning big and loud before attaching himself again to Dan&rsquo;s side, making it a little hard for Dan to walk.</p><p>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; Dan asked when Phil yawned for the third time.</p><p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to go to the party? We can always head back, have a night in,&rdquo; Dan suggested, feeling a little guilty for dragging Phil out when he clearly needed the rest. They stopped walking, and Dan turned to look at Phil, trying to convey that the suggestion was a genuine one.</p><p>Phil shook his head, looking at Dan with much more focused eyes. &ldquo;No, I want to go, I want you to have a fun night with your friends, and I want to meet them,&rdquo; he said, determined.</p><p>Phil looked sincere, and Dan could feel warmth spreading from his chest to the rest of his body. Here he was, spending his New Year&rsquo;s Eve with this adorable guy, who Dan knew was tired and spent and didn&rsquo;t even liked parties all that much, who still wanted to go and have fun for Dan&rsquo;s sake. To put it simply, Dan felt lucky. &ldquo;Yeah, okay,&rdquo; Dan said, smiling at Phil and starting to walk again.</p><p>But to his surprise, Phil stopped him, grabbing the sleeve of his coat and making him turn back to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s expression changed, looking a little sheepish, letting go of his sleeve and reaching up to play with the zipper of Dan&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;Just&hellip; do you remember? What I said?&rdquo; He asked, not meeting Dan&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Dan asked, feeling confused by the sudden change in the mood.</p><p>&ldquo;About&hellip; you know&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, sneaking one of his hands down Dan&rsquo;s body and taking hold of Dan&rsquo;s hand, squeezing tightly and finally lifting his eyes up to look at him.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Dan certainly remembered. Spent the last 2 nights thinking about the odd request, and about Phil&rsquo;s intense look when he told Dan his &ldquo;condition&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, of course,&rdquo; Dan said, squeezing back. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Promise?&rdquo; Phil asked, and to Dan&rsquo;s surprise he sounded a little nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dan answered, trying to smile reassuringly.</p><p>&ldquo;No matter what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil studied his eyes for a moment before he smiled, his expression changing into a sly one. &ldquo;Even if you need to pee?&rdquo; Phil asked, his tone joking.</p><p>Dan shrugged. &ldquo;We can leave a crack in the door. You&rsquo;ll reach as far as you can in and I&rsquo;ll reach as far as I can out, it&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil giggled, and Dan felt quite pleased with himself for making him relax. He let go of Dan&rsquo;s hand, covering his face with his hands and shaking his head. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do that,&rdquo; he said, tone a little whiny.</p><p>Dan grabbed Phil&rsquo;s wrists, pulling them away from his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever you want me to do, love,&rdquo; he said, taking a step closer to Phil.</p><p>Phil had an unreadable expression on his face, his intense eyes staring right at Dan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I warned you about the cute names,&rdquo; he said eventually, and before Dan had a chance to react, Phil launched himself forward, kissing him with force, wrapping his arms around his neck.</p><p>Dan felt like the wind got knocked out of his lungs, and it took his a moment to register what was going on. But the street was empty and Phil&rsquo;s lips were soft and eager, and really, Dan had no desire to protest.</p><p>______________________</p><p>When they finally reached PJ&rsquo;s and Sophie&rsquo;s place, Phil was pressed closely to Dan&rsquo;s side, his cool hand was clutching Dan&rsquo;s tightly. He looked calm, smiling big and bright at Dan when he looked to see how he was doing.</p><p>There was music and sounds of people talking coming from inside the flat, but they were faint, which made Dan feel some relief. He knew Phil definitely didn&rsquo;t want to spend his night at a loud, headache inducing party, and even though he knew PJ&rsquo;s party most likely wouldn&rsquo;t be like that, he was still a little nervous.</p><p>He knocked on the door, squeezing Phil&rsquo;s hand a few times while waiting for it to open. The door was opened less than a minute later by a redheaded girl Dan vaguely recognized as one of Sophie&rsquo;s friends, who smiled at them politely when they greeted her, telling them PJ was in the kitchen before leaving to get back to her friends.</p><p>They took off their winter coats (Phil was laughing at Dan when he determinedly tried to do so without letting go of Phil&rsquo;s hand, switching his hold to the other hand to take down each sleeve, making the process very complicated but absolutely worth the huge happy smile on Phil&rsquo;s face).</p><p>When they were done, Dan tugged on Phil&rsquo;s hand to follow him, leading them to the kitchen area where they were met with the sight of PJ, taking out bottles from the fridge. PJ lifted his head up when he heard them approaching, a friendly smile finding its way to his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Well hello there, long time no see,&rdquo; PJ said, putting the bottle in his hand on the counter and wiping his damp hand on his jeans before making his way to them.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Peej,&rdquo; Dan greeted back, patting PJ awkwardly on the shoulder, (after stepping forward for a hug and then changing his mind, remembering Phil&rsquo;s hand in his). If PJ was surprised by the strange greeting, he definitely didn&rsquo;t show it. &ldquo;This is Phil,&rdquo; Dan introduced, smiling at Phil with encouragement.</p><p>Phil was smiling big right back at PJ, but his cheeks were a little pink and his look a little distant, which made Dan feel alert. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said, waving his unoccupied hand, &ldquo;I think we actually know each other? Kind of.&rdquo;</p><p>PJ looked confused for a second, looking at Phil intently, before his eyes blew wide in realization. &ldquo;Oh! We do!&rdquo; He exclaimed, a genuine look of surprise on his face. &ldquo;Good to see you man, I like your new hair,&rdquo; PJ said, making Phil reach self-consciously to pet his black fringe.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you! I wasn&rsquo;t too sure about the length, but I like it black,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;No no, it&rsquo;s a good length, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; PJ reassured, leaving Dan feeling slightly confused, even if quite happy to see PJ and Phil seemed to get along.</p><p>PJ turned to look at Dan, his smile vaguely apologetic, as if he was saying sorry for confusing him. &ldquo;We went to sixth form together. Both did A level art,&rdquo; PJ explained, gesturing towards Phil with his thumb. &ldquo;This guy always had the strangest looking art, our teacher didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; She never did understand my creative mind,&rdquo; Phil said, shaking his head and making PJ laugh.</p><p>Dan laughed too. It wasn&rsquo;t hard for him to imagine that the art Phil produced probably wasn&rsquo;t the most conventional.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh man, this is such a small world. How did you guys meet?&rdquo; PJ asked, gesturing to their joint hands.</p><p>&ldquo;We had Greek mythology class together this semester,&rdquo; Dan answered, happy he could contribute something to the conversation.</p><p>PJ&rsquo;s eyes widened again, blinking in surprise. &ldquo;Are you in the same uni as us, Phil? I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo; PJ exclaimed.</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, yeah I am. But it&rsquo;s okay! I took two gap years, so it&rsquo;s understandable you never saw me. Also I&rsquo;m absent a lot,&rdquo; Dan could feel Phil getting flustered, and was just about to change the subject when PJ spoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;Right&rdquo; he said, and his face had an unreadable expression on it that made Dan a little agitated for some reason, but he pushed the feeling aside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I got to see you now mate, it&rsquo;s been a long time, we need to catch up&rsquo;&rdquo; Phil smiled at him, nodding a little. &ldquo;Grab yourself something to drink yeah? I&rsquo;ll go back to the lounge, rescue Sophie from hosting by herself,&rdquo; he said, taking the bottle he took out earlier, raising it in a &ldquo;cheers&rdquo; motion before leaving to join the rest of his guests.</p><p>When PJ was out of the room Dan turned to Phil, squeezing his hand tightly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s such a strange coincidence,&rdquo; Dan said, studying Phil&rsquo;s expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil said quietly, looking somewhere to the left of Dan&rsquo;s face, and Dan could feel an unexplainable pit of anxiety in his stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay? You looked a little uncomfortable,&rdquo; he asked. He needed Phil to say more. To explain why he looked so unreachable all of a sudden.</p><p>Phil shook his head in dismissal, finally focusing on Dan&rsquo;s eyes, making him relax a little. &ldquo;No no, it&rsquo;s okay, just wasn&rsquo;t expecting to see him after all these years,&rdquo; he said, his unoccupied hand moving to Dan&rsquo;s collar, smoothing the material between his fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you&hellip; Not get along or something?&rdquo; Dan asked carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;No, we actually did,&rdquo; Phil said, smiling. &ldquo;I told you I had&hellip; a bit of a reputation back in school. And people usually didn&rsquo;t really want to be my friends, at least if they weren&rsquo;t seeking&hellip; something else,&rdquo; Phil said, his eyes dropping to his own hand on Dan&rsquo;s collar, shrugging. And even though he tried to sound unbothered Dan knew he still was. &ldquo;But PJ was always nice to me, we weren&rsquo;t really friends but he used to sit next to me in art class and talk to me about like&hellip; regular silly things. I was always looking forward to that.&rdquo; Phil said, lifting his eyes and looking at Dan again, scrunching his nose in a way that really shouldn&rsquo;t be as adorable as it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Here I go again, making everything more complicated than it should be,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really okay. I just didn&rsquo;t expect to see him here, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Phil said, and Dan hated that Phil still felt the need to down play things he was feeling in front of him.</p><p>But he said nothing, squeezing Phil&rsquo;s hand and leaning down to kiss his lips softly for a moment. &ldquo;What do you want to drink?&rdquo; Dan asked when he pulled away, pulling on Phil&rsquo;s hand to follow him to the fridge.</p><p>Phil smiled a happy smile, even if it didn&rsquo;t quite reach his eyes like usual, squeezing Dan&rsquo;s hand back. &ldquo;Something sweet please.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan laughed, rolling his eyes but bringing Phil&rsquo;s hand up to his lips for a quick kiss, making Phil beam at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;s what you want.&rdquo;</p><p>_____________________________________</p><p>Dan found, quickly enough, that Phil&rsquo;s hand holding rule wasn&rsquo;t nearly as restricting as he thought it would be.</p><p>Sure, it was a little awkward greeting people, especially when he forgot about it a few times and ended up giving weird half gestures before remembering, getting some confused looks at the process.</p><p>But it was also nice, grounding.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s hand was extremely soft to touch, slightly smaller than Dan&rsquo;s and even after holding it for quite some time it still didn&rsquo;t feel too warm against his.</p><p>&ldquo;I moisturize,&rdquo; Phil said when Dan comment on the softness of his skin, his tongue getting a little loose after the 2 beers he had.</p><p>Phil also wasn&rsquo;t shy about cozying up to Dan, pressing closely and demanding attention. Usually, when they were in public, he did try to control Phil&rsquo;s clingy tendencies a little, as public displays of affection tended to get him unnecessarily flustered and a little embarrassed.</p><p>But this was a party, and PJ and Sophie were curled up together on the other sofa and so were a few other couples, and honestly, no one really seemed to care.</p><p>From time to time, people came over to talk to them. Dan knew most of the people there at least by face, introducing them to Phil and letting his strangely charming boyfriend lead the conversations, smiling fondly when he said something odd enough to make the other person look at Dan for guidance, earning only an amused shrug in return.</p><p>But for some reason, no one really stayed to talk to them for more them a few minutes, all making polite excuses to leave the conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;You just have an aura of a new, lovey dovey couple about you. Like you want to be left alone,&rdquo; PJ said to Dan. They were talking in the hallway, while Dan was waiting for Phil to come out of the bathroom. (Dan did suggest he&rsquo;d actually come and hold his hand while he peed, to which Phil whined loudly and covered his face again, making Dan feel like his heart might just explode out of his chest. He did, however, hover not far from the bathroom in the hallway, meeting PJ there when he went to take something from the other room).</p><p>&ldquo;I feel bad,&rdquo; Phil said later. They were sitting on a two seater sofa, their heads resting next to each other on the back cushions, face to face, hands linked together between them.</p><p>It was 3 minutes to midnight and all around them was a small buzz of excitement, people saying they should turn the TV on, to see the fireworks.</p><p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; Dan asked. He was studying Phil&rsquo;s face closely for the last 20 minutes, noting every freckle, every smile line and every mole, letting his fingers go over the parts that felt extra special in his hazy mind, memorizing them by touch and making Phil giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;We came here so you could have a fun night with your friends, but I ended up keeping you all to myself,&rdquo; he said, his blue eyes looking a little dark in the dim light of the room.</p><p>Dan smiled, closing his eyes when Phil&rsquo;s hand came up automatically, poking his dimple. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter. I think I mainly wanted to show you off a little anyway, let everyone see how lucky I am,&rdquo; he said, and while he said it, he realized how true his words were.</p><p>Sure, he wanted to see PJ, and spending the night with him and their university acquaintances was a nice way to spent New Year&rsquo;s Eve, but he realized that most of all he wanted everyone to see how happy he finally was, how happy Phil was making him.</p><p>How he wasn&rsquo;t really interested anymore in going to random pubs with them for the sole purpose of trying to meet new people, and going on one unsuccessful date after the other, looking for something he didn&rsquo;t actually think he&rsquo;ll get to find again after losing it once before.</p><p>He finally had what he was missing, and even though it made him feel a little bit childish, a little silly, he wanted everyone to see him like this; happy, content and with the greatest, most beautifully unique person by his side.</p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t say anything, but when people started the countdown leading to midnight, Dan opened his eyes and looked at him. He almost felt the need to close them again right after, because Phil&rsquo;s face was filled with so much emotion Dan wasn&rsquo;t quite sure how to take it all in.</p><p>There was softness in there, and something that looked like genuine awe and, dare he say, love, and Dan felt dizzy with it all.</p><p>It looked like Phil was about to say something, but the clock hit 12 and everyone cheered, and Phil just shook his head before letting go of Dan&rsquo;s hand and cupping his face, kissing him deep and slow, making Dan&rsquo;s breath hitch.</p><p>&ldquo;Take me home please,&rdquo; Phil said after pulling away, his face still only an inch away from Dan&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo; Dan asked. His mind felt foggy and slow, but the instinct to take care of Phil was still there, strong as ever.</p><p>Phil shook his head, smiling. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said, kissing Dan again. &ldquo;But I think we should really get home. I know how shy you are about PDA, and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to appreciate what I&rsquo;m about to do to you if we won&rsquo;t get to a privet place soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh.</p><hr /><p>Notes:</p><p>again, so sorry for the long wait guys, life was crazy, i&rsquo;ll try to update more often from now on :&rsquo;) <br />please please tell me what you thought</p>",
