I woke up several times,as I often do, and when I went back to sleep I started a new dream.</p><p>Dream the first:\u00a0</p><p>I was sitting outside on the patio of a sandwich shop eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It was a clear, sunny day with a slight breeze. A yellow awning stretched out above me, casting a shadow over the small seating area. I started looking at the buildings around me and I seemed to be alone. I turned to look behind me and again, there was no one. I could hear a bicycle bell chiming somewhere near but couldn\u2019t see it. I continued to eat my sandwich and reached for my bag to pull out a book to read. Of course, I had forgotten to pack one. (what a nightmare) I decided to seek out a bookstore, because what other logical solution is there? I strolled along the empty streets and searched the store fronts hoping to see some sort of bookstore reference. The signs were all in French. (I took French in high school, but I\u2019m far from fluent.) I stopped and tried to read a street sign, but it was too fuzzy. I needed my glasses. I patted down my pockets, no glasses. They must still be on my night stand&hellip;</p><p>I woke up and reached a hand out and put my glasses on, only to realize I was indeed awake. Ughh.</p><p>Dream the second:</p><p>I was looking at my feet, smooth pebbles peeked around my toes. Water washed up and carried me away to a cave situated on the mouth of a lake. I could hear music coming from the darkness. I wanted to walk further into the cave to find the source, but I couldn\u2019t move my feet. Instead, I just closed my eyes and began to sing the only song that would come to mind at the time.\u00a0\u201cBarbie Girl\u201d by Aqua. I got really into it, I started waving my hands, flipping my hair around, I got louder and louder. Part of me just wanted to participate in the music, another part of me just really felt like singing about barbie girl. A small seal waddled its way to the lighter part of the cave and gave me a very disapproving glare.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow dare you. How dare you open that ghastly hole in your face and screech that blasphemous horror in this sacred place. You, madam are a butcher.\u201d His haughty British accent got to me. I giggled, only a little. Then tried my best to apologize. He turned his nose up at me and waddled to the back of the cave. I tried to follow him but quickly got lost in the darkness and shook myself awake.<br/></p><p>Dream the third:</p><p>I was running through a maze. Similar to the one in the Triwizard Tournament. I panicked. I don\u2019t know any magic. I don\u2019t have a wand or any formal training as a witch! I decided my best option was to hide inside the hedges. I dug and pulled until I was certain I wouldn\u2019t be seen. I heard a whisper,\u00a0\u201cThis is my hiding spot, find your own!\u201d It was Fox, from the Hunger Games movie. I hopped out of the hedge and listened for footsteps. Hearing nothing, I moved to my right. Krum appeared with his cursed eyes and dream logic kicked in. I kissed him. Right on the mouth. He stumbled back and his eyes cleared.\u00a0\u201cLove kills ze demon.\u201d He croaked. I tried to run and he caught me by my arm and turned me to face him.\u00a0\u201cYou are a friend to Hermion-niny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fan, but I wouldn\u2019t say friend.\u201d He was holding me all scrunched up at the shoulders, I was just hoping that he wouldn\u2019t pop my head off. My eyes were already starting to bug.\u00a0\u201cIs there any chance I could get you to\u00a0 loosen your grip?\u201d My double chin was starting to impede my breathing. He dropped me and we decided to finish the race together. I wasn\u2019t a witch so I wasn\u2019t any competition to him. We darted through the maze and saw Harry and Cedric rushing to reach the cup across the clearing.\u00a0\u201c<i>accio</i> cup!!\u201d Viktor sent the cup flying to us and grasped it by the handles firmly. I grabbed a fistful of his jacket and we went soaring through the air.</p><p>We landed with a thud on solid ground. It smelled of death and still water. We saw movement through the thick fog and quickly ducked into an archway. I heard a husky voice in the darkness.\u00a0\u201cWhere have they gone Wormtail? Where is he!?\u201d The voice was getting angrier. A cowardly tone replied, unsteady and shaky.\u00a0\u201cI d-d-don\u2019t know master. I just d-don\u2019t know. It was all arranged most magnificently Dark Majesty. Most magnificently.\u201d The figure bowed and retreated.\u00a0\u201cthey are out there somewhere, Wormtail. Bring him to me.\u201d The voice had retreated to a low whisper. The shrouded figure began to head in the direction from which it came.</p><p>\u201cWho vas dat?\u201d Viktor looked to me for an answer but I didn\u2019t want to say it. I had to force the words out.\u00a0\u201cIt was Voldemort.\u201d I gulped. My mouth had suddenly gone so dry. We tip toed out of our hiding spot. I could see the large abandoned house, it was old and falling to pieces. I could make out the outline of Tom Riddle\u2019s paternal grave stone. The giant reaper with the scythe. Viktor drew out his wand and we faced the entrance of the once grand Riddle house. We approached a window and saw a still darkness inside. I gently pushed the window pain and it popped right out onto a carpeted floor. I opened the latch from the outside and lifted the pane. We climbed in and quietly crept along the floor.\u00a0<br/></p><p>We could hear them talking in an upstairs bedroom, so we started looking for stairs.

There was no way to contact the Golden Trio, so we just decided to go out in a blaze of glory.\u00a0</p><p>Viktor kicked in the door and I dove for Wormtail and took him down. I punched his fat ugly face and knocked him out cold. I grabbed his wand and tossed it in the fire. Voldemort had Viktor in his clutches. Before I could think, I ran over and kissed him.

I knelt down and crept forward&hellip;lifted his cloak and found a young boy.

I woke up several times,as I often do, and when I went back to sleep I started a new dream.</p><p>Dream the first:\u00a0</p><p>I was sitting outside on the patio of a sandwich shop eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It was a clear, sunny day with a slight breeze. A yellow awning stretched out above me, casting a shadow over the small seating area. I started looking at the buildings around me and I seemed to be alone. I turned to look behind me and again, there was no one. I could hear a bicycle bell chiming somewhere near but couldn\u2019t see it. I continued to eat my sandwich and reached for my bag to pull out a book to read. Of course, I had forgotten to pack one. (what a nightmare) I decided to seek out a bookstore, because what other logical solution is there? I strolled along the empty streets and searched the store fronts hoping to see some sort of bookstore reference. The signs were all in French. (I took French in high school, but I\u2019m far from fluent.) I stopped and tried to read a street sign, but it was too fuzzy. I needed my glasses. I patted down my pockets, no glasses. They must still be on my night stand\u2026</p><p>I woke up and reached a hand out and put my glasses on, only to realize I was indeed awake. Ughh.</p><p>Dream the second:</p><p>I was looking at my feet, smooth pebbles peeked around my toes. Water washed up and carried me away to a cave situated on the mouth of a lake. I could hear music coming from the darkness. I wanted to walk further into the cave to find the source, but I couldn\u2019t move my feet. Instead, I just closed my eyes and began to sing the only song that would come to mind at the time.\u00a0\u201cBarbie Girl\u201d by Aqua. I got really into it, I started waving my hands, flipping my hair around, I got louder and louder. Part of me just wanted to participate in the music, another part of me just really felt like singing about barbie girl. A small seal waddled its way to the lighter part of the cave and gave me a very disapproving glare.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow dare you. How dare you open that ghastly hole in your face and screech that blasphemous horror in this sacred place. You, madam are a butcher.\u201d His haughty British accent got to me. I giggled, only a little. Then tried my best to apologize. He turned his nose up at me and waddled to the back of the cave. I tried to follow him but quickly got lost in the darkness and shook myself awake.<br></p><p>Dream the third:</p><p>I was running through a maze. Similar to the one in the Triwizard Tournament. I panicked. I don\u2019t know any magic. I don\u2019t have a wand or any formal training as a witch! I decided my best option was to hide inside the hedges. I dug and pulled until I was certain I wouldn\u2019t be seen. I heard a whisper,\u00a0\u201cThis is my hiding spot, find your own!\u201d It was Fox, from the Hunger Games movie. I hopped out of the hedge and listened for footsteps. Hearing nothing, I moved to my right. Krum appeared with his cursed eyes and dream logic kicked in. I kissed him. Right on the mouth. He stumbled back and his eyes cleared.\u00a0\u201cLove kills ze demon.\u201d He croaked. I tried to run and he caught me by my arm and turned me to face him.\u00a0\u201cYou are a friend to Hermion-niny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fan, but I wouldn\u2019t say friend.\u201d He was holding me all scrunched up at the shoulders, I was just hoping that he wouldn\u2019t pop my head off. My eyes were already starting to bug.\u00a0\u201cIs there any chance I could get you to\u00a0 loosen your grip?\u201d My double chin was starting to impede my breathing. He dropped me and we decided to finish the race together. I wasn\u2019t a witch so I wasn\u2019t any competition to him. We darted through the maze and saw Harry and Cedric rushing to reach the cup across the clearing.\u00a0\u201c<i>accio</i> cup!!\u201d Viktor sent the cup flying to us and grasped it by the handles firmly. I grabbed a fistful of his jacket and we went soaring through the air.</p><p>We landed with a thud on solid ground. It smelled of death and still water. We saw movement through the thick fog and quickly ducked into an archway. I heard a husky voice in the darkness.\u00a0\u201cWhere have they gone Wormtail? Where is he!?\u201d The voice was getting angrier. A cowardly tone replied, unsteady and shaky.\u00a0\u201cI d-d-don\u2019t know master. I just d-don\u2019t know. It was all arranged most magnificently Dark Majesty. Most magnificently.\u201d The figure bowed and retreated.\u00a0\u201cthey are out there somewhere, Wormtail. Bring him to me.\u201d The voice had retreated to a low whisper. The shrouded figure began to head in the direction from which it came.</p><p>\u201cWho vas dat?\u201d Viktor looked to me for an answer but I didn\u2019t want to say it. I had to force the words out.\u00a0\u201cIt was Voldemort.\u201d I gulped. My mouth had suddenly gone so dry. We tip toed out of our hiding spot. I could see the large abandoned house, it was old and falling to pieces. I could make out the outline of Tom Riddle\u2019s paternal grave stone. The giant reaper with the scythe. Viktor drew out his wand and we faced the entrance of the once grand Riddle house. We approached a window and saw a still darkness inside. I gently pushed the window pain and it popped right out onto a carpeted floor. I opened the latch from the outside and lifted the pane. We climbed in and quietly crept along the floor.\u00a0<br></p><p>We could hear them talking in an upstairs bedroom, so we started looking for stairs. There was a pile of bones on the dining room table. Human and animal alike. So the snake was here somewhere. I motioned to the site so that Viktor would also be aware of the threat.\u00a0</p><p>We decided that the best course of action would be to rush the stairs before any of them had time to figure out what was happening. I would take down Wormtail with an old fashioned tackle, and Viktor would try and hold off Voldemort until we could figure out what to do. There was no way to contact the Golden Trio, so we just decided to go out in a blaze of glory.\u00a0</p><p>Viktor kicked in the door and I dove for Wormtail and took him down. I punched his fat ugly face and knocked him out cold. I grabbed his wand and tossed it in the fire. Voldemort had Viktor in his clutches. Before I could think, I ran over and kissed him. Voldemort, not Viktor. Just to clarify. When I pulled away from him, he had shrunk away, writhing in pain and agony. He fell into a crumpled heap in the corner. I knelt down and crept forward\u2026lifted his cloak and found a young boy. Baby faced and curled up in a ball.\u00a0\u201cLove kills the demon.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>That concludes my dream of how I defeated Voldemort with Viktor Krum and a kiss. The End.</p>",

Arriving out of nowhere would be rude.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked in surprise. \u201cBut I observed Vongola for a\nwhile. There\u2019s one super powerful guy there that everyone randomly attacks.\nIsn\u2019t he supposed to be the boss, if that\u2019s the case?\u201d</p><p>Since Harry\u2019s sense of normal had been skewed by having\nVoldemort as an enemy, Hermione was her only basis of comparison.</p><p>And judging by Hermione\u2019s face, she had failed.</p><p>\u201cHarry, people don\u2019t randomly attack their boss. That would\nbe suicidal.

He didn\u2019t even try to delegate his paperwork to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes him a nice boss!\u201d Hermione roared, finally fed\nup with the topic. \u201cUnlike you!

She <i>liked</i> the\nhat.</p><p>But&hellip;.she liked the man who owned the hat too. He had such\nlovely fingers.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Three days later, Reborn entered his room to find a package\nof coffee beans, a cup of espresso and his fedora perched on his bed.</p><p>While he slowly checked his precious hat for any damage of\ntampering, Leon investigated the coffee and the beans for any signs of poison\nor irregularities. </p><p>When the chameleon didn\u2019t react, he took one cautious sip\nand went still.</p><p>He had a very discerning palate and he knew where the coffee\ncame from. It was from his favourite coffee shop, in <i>Vienna.</i> He lived in the Vongola Mansion, in Italy. How on earth did\nshe keep it warm? It was still <i>steaming</i>\nwhen he arrived.</p><p>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d he mused.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t exactly know <i>what</i> she\u2019d done, but she knows that it must be something because\nHermione\u2019s smile was manic. And Ginny was right next to her, smile just as\nwide.</p><p>It worried her slightly. The last time she\u2019d seen them\ntogether and that happy, Malfoy Manor exploded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too happy,\u201d Harry told them bluntly - suspiciously.\n\u201cWhat happened now?\u201d</p><p>Ginny giggled. \u201cSuch an accusatory tone. You remember that\ndirty politician that kept asking us for bribes when we set up a factory in his\ndistrict? He gave us the green light to build our building, along with an\nadditional fifty hectares. I can now add a laboratory for George.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked several times just to parse through the words.\nBecause that man had been the definition of greedy and he\u2019d wanted them to pay\nhim a tithe for everything they earned. On top of the taxes they paid yearly.</p><p>\u201cNone of you blackmailed him, did you?\u201d she had to ask.</p><p>Hermione sniffed. \u201cNo. I\u2019m even a bit irritated that we\ndidn\u2019t think to do that first.\u201d</p><p>Ruthless, thy name was Hermione.</p><p>Harry gave a small smile at the thought. A ruthless Hermione\nwas a scarily efficient Hermione.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check it out,\u201d Harry murmured. Because <i>something</i> had happened and Harry didn\u2019t\naccept good fortune at face value anymore.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Tsuna was giving him a look, and if Reborn hadn\u2019t been so\ncurious, he would have shot him on principle. He was much too young and\ninexperienced to be giving Reborn <i>looks</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou asked to see me?\u201d Reborn asked.</p><p>The Vongola Decimo - and it was the Vongola Decimo in front\nof him now, not his student \u2013 handed him a folder, looking disturbed.</p><p>\u201cReborn, this was supposed to be your mark next week,\u201d Tsuna\nsaid, fingers massaging his temples in an effort to stave off the headache.\n\u201cBecause the Moretti were found doing human trafficking, targeting young\ntourists in airports. Except. Someone&hellip;I don\u2019t even know what to call it&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Hayato Gokudera peered by Reborn\u2019s shoulder and Reborn\nallowed it, if only to share the beauty he was seeing.</p><p>\u201cIs that&hellip;.art? Using blood spray?\u201d Gokudera asked. He\ndidn\u2019t look disturbed but fascinated. So was Reborn.</p><p>\u201cAnd they made the blood spray to resemble Leon,\u201d Reborn\nfinished. He didn\u2019t quite manage to hide the smile in his voice and Tsuna\ngroaned.</p><p>\u201cReborn,\u201d Tsuna said, voice going very near a whine. \u201cThe\ndisposal team was <i>disturbed</i>. They\nclean up after <i>Hibari </i>and they were\ndisturbed. Do you know what it takes to disturb the disposal team?\u201d</p><p>Reborn did know. But still, it took serious skill to\ncalculate the blood spray and the angle to make a Leon painting. And he could\ntell it was just blood spray, no extra smears. </p><p>It was a beautiful bloody painting, and they\u2019d done it for\nReborn.</p><p>So. Maybe blackmailing that politician was worth it. It\u2019s\nnot every day that he got to see art like this.</p><p> \u201cDo you know who it\nis?\u201d Tsuna asked.</p><p>An image of a redhead with a wicked smile appeared in his\nhead and he shook his head with a wry smile. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d he\nsmiled.</p><p>Tsuna and Gokudera exchanged alarmed glances. They had never\nseen Reborn smile like <i>that</i>.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>From Harry\u2019s office came loud, cackling laughter.</p><p>George, sitting beside Ginny and trying to parse through\ncomplicated and convoluted scientific reports, stiffened.</p><p>\u201cDo you know something I don\u2019t?\u201d he had to ask. Because the\nlast time he heard her laugh like that was years ago, when Ron was still alive.</p><p>Ginny smirked. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s almost like&hellip;well,\nit\u2019s either Harry\u2019s courting an assassin or she\u2019s being courted by an assassin.\nEither way, there\u2019s a very graphic exchange of gifts going on.\u201d</p><p>Graphic was a nice word for it. Ginny didn\u2019t even know you\ncould calculate blood pressure to make an arterial blood spray art. But Harry\ndid it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d Ginny murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll go check out what he\u2019s\ngot her this time.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Ginny came back looking bemused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d George asked, unable to take the suspense anymore.</p><p>Ginny shook her head, red strands that were lose from her\nbraid going everywhere. \u201cHe got her poetry. Using <i>viscera</i> as a writing medium.\u201d</p><p>George blinked. \u201cVisc \u2013 Ginny, you don\u2019t mean <i>intestines</i>, do you? Because that\u2019s just\nunhygienic.\u201d</p><p>Hermione, rushing past them with a longsuffering expression,\nstopped and groaned. \u201cGeorge, you\u2019re missing the point. You\u2019re supposed to say,\n\u2018It\u2019s creepy, it\u2019s disturbing, can we please get a restraining order?\u2019 instead\nof pointing out the lack of hygiene!\u201d</p><p>Ginny ignored Hermione. \u201cWhat intestines did he even use, is\nmy question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as bad as everyone else,\u201d Hermione huffed. \u201cI have\nto dispose of it now. The kids shouldn\u2019t see this.\u201d</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Reborn\u2019s delighted laughter when he saw the folder in Tsuna\u2019s\nhand was full of schadenfreude.</p><p>Gokudera, no fool, took one step back. Tsuna was just\ngrateful that he was sitting down, because in all the years he had been with\nReborn, he had never heard him laugh that happily unless there was mass\ndestruction involved.</p><p>\u201cHow did she do this?\u201d Reborn asked. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>Yamamoto, drawn in by the sound of laughter, wandered in and\nlooked over Reborn\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Yamamoto said in that oblivious tone that pissed off\nGokudera. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you could lock up the Beneventi! I thought they\nhad paid off all the judges, the police and the detectives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Tsuna answered dryly. \u201cI tried once, do you remember?\nThey just got out and wandered around again in a week. Those connections run\ndeep.\u201d</p><p>And the act itself was amazing, because she had gotten the\nwhole famiglia. Even the footmen, the errand boys and the scullery maids. </p><p>\u201cThe boss is under a life sentence, the guardians are\nserving for thirty years and the rest are serving for ten,\u201d Reborn read out,\nplain admiration in his voice. \u201cEven Viper would have a hard time doing this.\nShe must have gone straight to the Prime Minister of France himself.\u201d</p><p>Tsuna held out a hand and Gokudera slapped a bottle of sake\non it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a woman, of course it\u2019s a woman,\u201d Tsuna muttered.\n\u201cReborn, can you settle this? Your weird, non-flirting? What happened to\nletters, roses and sweets?\u201d</p><p>Reborn scoffed. \u201cBoring. Where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>Tsuna downed the entire bottle in one go, internally\nscreaming the whole time.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>\u201cHermione, we\u2019re pretty sure the assassin courting her is a <i>muggle</i>, right?\u201d Ginny asked.</p><p>Hermione didn\u2019t answer, pretty much transfixed on the\npainting of Voldemort being roasted alive on a stake. Harry was absolutely no\nhelp, giggling every time the moving painting restarted again, with Voldemort\nbeing dragged there by Grawp, tied to a stake and then lit on fire by a\ncackling redhead that vaguely resembled Ron. The silent screams as\npainting-Voldemort burned were an extra touch.</p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p>If Harry wasn\u2019t already invested in that man, Ginny would\nhave tried to have a go at him herself.</p><p>Harry turned to them; eyes alight with laughter and\nhappiness. It took Ginny\u2019s breath away. Moving to Italy and helping out a dozen\norphans in need had lightened the darkness in Harry\u2019s eyes but this was the\nfirst time that she had seen her friend smile again and smile like she meant\nit.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I don\u2019t know how he got this, but&hellip;\u201d she paused,\nlooking insecure and hesitant.</p><p>George swooped down and noogied her on the head. \u201cAw,\nscarface. If you want some time off so you can hunt down your assassin, you can\nalways say so! Just come back after a week, or else we\u2019ll hunt you down!\u201d</p><p>Hermione nodded. \u201cI approve. This is a tasteful gift.\u201d</p><p>Everybody tactfully ignored the tears that glistened down\nHermione\u2019s cheeks. </p><p>Ginny\u2019s smirk was wicked. \u201cTie him down, Potter. Tie him\ndown and drag him here. It\u2019s time for an introduction.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Harry, being Harry, took them all literally.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Reborn woke up with his wrists handcuffed to the bed posts\nand his body weighted down by another body.</p><p>\u201cYou made me wait,\u201d he announced.</p><p>The redhead napping on him blinked awake and smiled\nsleepily, \u201cIt took a while. Did you receive my gifts?\u201d</p><p> \u201cYou really went\nbeyond my expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you\u2019ve caught me.\u201d</p><p>Harry grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve caught you. It\u2019s your fault, teasing me\nlike that. Such lovely erotic poetry you sent me.\u201d</p><p>Catching her eyes, he nodded minutely and she laughed,\ndelighted and started to undo his shirt. With her mouth.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p><b>Bonus scene:</b></p><p>There was a perfectly preserved head among the fruit basket.\nSpecifically, the head of the Rivera family. </p><p>Tsuna only managed to refrain from sighing through sheer\nwillpower. That, and practice.</p><p>\u201cI thought the crazy gift giving would <i>stop</i> once she dragged him to bed?\u201d Gokudera muttered, saying out\nloud everything going on in Tsuna\u2019s head. </p><p>They were certainly loud enough at night; he really had to\nwonder where they got all their energy. Because he wanted to bottle it and put\nit for sale. He\u2019d be a billionaire in short order.</p><p>Then a thought wandered through Tsuna\u2019s brain that made him\nwant to cry.</p><p>He had to share it.</p><p>\u201cGokudera-kun,\u201d Tsuna said with trepidation. \u201cReborn is a\nhitman and she\u2019s an assassin, right? If they do courting like this, what does\nHibari-san do for courting?\u201d</p><p>Both of them went a bit blank at the thought. The only thing\nin mind was an island sinking to the sea.</p><p>Yamamoto, on Tsuna\u2019s other side, laughed cheerfully. \u201cI\nheard that when Squalo and Xanxus went courting, there was a mass grave being\ndug beside the Varia Mansion.\u201d</p><p>Gokudera leapt for Yamamoto\u2019s throat with his <i>teeth.</i></p><p>Tsuna buried his head in hands and started laughing. Either\nthat or sob hysterically.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p><b>Harry\u2019s gifts to\nReborn \u2013 Food (coffee), Art, the Beneventi.</b></p><p><b>Reborn\u2019s gifts to\nHarry \u2013 Additional land, Poetry and Art.</b></p><p><b>Like, lmao.

He was much too young and\ninexperienced to be giving Reborn <i>looks</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou asked to see me?\u201d Reborn asked.</p><p>The Vongola Decimo - and it was the Vongola Decimo in front\nof him now, not his student \u2013 handed him a folder, looking disturbed.</p><p>\u201cReborn, this was supposed to be your mark next week,\u201d Tsuna\nsaid, fingers massaging his temples in an effort to stave off the headache.\n\u201cBecause the Moretti were found doing human trafficking, targeting young\ntourists in airports. Except. Someone\u2026I don\u2019t even know what to call it\u2026\u201d</p><p>Hayato Gokudera peered by Reborn\u2019s shoulder and Reborn\nallowed it, if only to share the beauty he was seeing.</p><p>\u201cIs that\u2026.art? Using blood spray?\u201d Gokudera asked. He\ndidn\u2019t look disturbed but fascinated. So was Reborn.</p><p>\u201cAnd they made the blood spray to resemble Leon,\u201d Reborn\nfinished. He didn\u2019t quite manage to hide the smile in his voice and Tsuna\ngroaned.</p><p>\u201cReborn,\u201d Tsuna said, voice going very near a whine. \u201cThe\ndisposal team was <i>disturbed</i>. They\nclean up after <i>Hibari </i>and they were\ndisturbed. Do you know what it takes to disturb the disposal team?\u201d</p><p>Reborn did know. But still, it took serious skill to\ncalculate the blood spray and the angle to make a Leon painting. And he could\ntell it was just blood spray, no extra smears. </p><p>It was a beautiful bloody painting, and they\u2019d done it for\nReborn.</p><p>So. Maybe blackmailing that politician was worth it. It\u2019s\nnot every day that he got to see art like this.</p><p> \u201cDo you know who it\nis?\u201d Tsuna asked.</p><p>An image of a redhead with a wicked smile appeared in his\nhead and he shook his head with a wry smile. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d he\nsmiled.</p><p>Tsuna and Gokudera exchanged alarmed glances. They had never\nseen Reborn smile like <i>that</i>.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>From Harry\u2019s office came loud, cackling laughter.</p><p>George, sitting beside Ginny and trying to parse through\ncomplicated and convoluted scientific reports, stiffened.</p><p>\u201cDo you know something I don\u2019t?\u201d he had to ask. Because the\nlast time he heard her laugh like that was years ago, when Ron was still alive.</p><p>Ginny smirked. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s almost like\u2026well,\nit\u2019s either Harry\u2019s courting an assassin or she\u2019s being courted by an assassin.\nEither way, there\u2019s a very graphic exchange of gifts going on.\u201d</p><p>Graphic was a nice word for it. Ginny didn\u2019t even know you\ncould calculate blood pressure to make an arterial blood spray art. But Harry\ndid it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d Ginny murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll go check out what he\u2019s\ngot her this time.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Ginny came back looking bemused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d George asked, unable to take the suspense anymore.</p><p>Ginny shook her head, red strands that were lose from her\nbraid going everywhere. \u201cHe got her poetry. Using <i>viscera</i> as a writing medium.\u201d</p><p>George blinked. \u201cVisc \u2013 Ginny, you don\u2019t mean <i>intestines</i>, do you? Because that\u2019s just\nunhygienic.\u201d</p><p>Hermione, rushing past them with a longsuffering expression,\nstopped and groaned. \u201cGeorge, you\u2019re missing the point. You\u2019re supposed to say,\n\u2018It\u2019s creepy, it\u2019s disturbing, can we please get a restraining order?\u2019 instead\nof pointing out the lack of hygiene!\u201d</p><p>Ginny ignored Hermione. \u201cWhat intestines did he even use, is\nmy question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as bad as everyone else,\u201d Hermione huffed. \u201cI have\nto dispose of it now. The kids shouldn\u2019t see this.\u201d</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Reborn\u2019s delighted laughter when he saw the folder in Tsuna\u2019s\nhand was full of schadenfreude.</p><p>Gokudera, no fool, took one step back. Tsuna was just\ngrateful that he was sitting down, because in all the years he had been with\nReborn, he had never heard him laugh that happily unless there was mass\ndestruction involved.</p><p>\u201cHow did she do this?\u201d Reborn asked. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>Yamamoto, drawn in by the sound of laughter, wandered in and\nlooked over Reborn\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Yamamoto said in that oblivious tone that pissed off\nGokudera. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you could lock up the Beneventi! I thought they\nhad paid off all the judges, the police and the detectives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Tsuna answered dryly. \u201cI tried once, do you remember?\nThey just got out and wandered around again in a week. Those connections run\ndeep.\u201d</p><p>And the act itself was amazing, because she had gotten the\nwhole famiglia. Even the footmen, the errand boys and the scullery maids. </p><p>\u201cThe boss is under a life sentence, the guardians are\nserving for thirty years and the rest are serving for ten,\u201d Reborn read out,\nplain admiration in his voice. \u201cEven Viper would have a hard time doing this.\nShe must have gone straight to the Prime Minister of France himself.\u201d</p><p>Tsuna held out a hand and Gokudera slapped a bottle of sake\non it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a woman, of course it\u2019s a woman,\u201d Tsuna muttered.\n\u201cReborn, can you settle this? Your weird, non-flirting? What happened to\nletters, roses and sweets?\u201d</p><p>Reborn scoffed. \u201cBoring. Where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>Tsuna downed the entire bottle in one go, internally\nscreaming the whole time.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>\u201cHermione, we\u2019re pretty sure the assassin courting her is a <i>muggle</i>, right?\u201d Ginny asked.</p><p>Hermione didn\u2019t answer, pretty much transfixed on the\npainting of Voldemort being roasted alive on a stake. Harry was absolutely no\nhelp, giggling every time the moving painting restarted again, with Voldemort\nbeing dragged there by Grawp, tied to a stake and then lit on fire by a\ncackling redhead that vaguely resembled Ron. The silent screams as\npainting-Voldemort burned were an extra touch.</p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p>If Harry wasn\u2019t already invested in that man, Ginny would\nhave tried to have a go at him herself.</p><p>Harry turned to them; eyes alight with laughter and\nhappiness. It took Ginny\u2019s breath away. Moving to Italy and helping out a dozen\norphans in need had lightened the darkness in Harry\u2019s eyes but this was the\nfirst time that she had seen her friend smile again and smile like she meant\nit.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I don\u2019t know how he got this, but\u2026\u201d she paused,\nlooking insecure and hesitant.</p><p>George swooped down and noogied her on the head. \u201cAw,\nscarface. If you want some time off so you can hunt down your assassin, you can\nalways say so! Just come back after a week, or else we\u2019ll hunt you down!\u201d</p><p>Hermione nodded. \u201cI approve. This is a tasteful gift.\u201d</p><p>Everybody tactfully ignored the tears that glistened down\nHermione\u2019s cheeks. </p><p>Ginny\u2019s smirk was wicked. \u201cTie him down, Potter. Tie him\ndown and drag him here. It\u2019s time for an introduction.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Harry, being Harry, took them all literally.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Reborn woke up with his wrists handcuffed to the bed posts\nand his body weighted down by another body.</p><p>\u201cYou made me wait,\u201d he announced.</p><p>The redhead napping on him blinked awake and smiled\nsleepily, \u201cIt took a while. Did you receive my gifts?\u201d</p><p> \u201cYou really went\nbeyond my expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you\u2019ve caught me.\u201d</p><p>Harry grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve caught you. It\u2019s your fault, teasing me\nlike that. Such lovely erotic poetry you sent me.\u201d</p><p>Catching her eyes, he nodded minutely and she laughed,\ndelighted and started to undo his shirt. With her mouth.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p><b>Bonus scene:</b></p><p>There was a perfectly preserved head among the fruit basket.\nSpecifically, the head of the Rivera family. </p><p>Tsuna only managed to refrain from sighing through sheer\nwillpower. That, and practice.</p><p>\u201cI thought the crazy gift giving would <i>stop</i> once she dragged him to bed?\u201d Gokudera muttered, saying out\nloud everything going on in Tsuna\u2019s head. </p><p>They were certainly loud enough at night; he really had to\nwonder where they got all their energy. Because he wanted to bottle it and put\nit for sale. He\u2019d be a billionaire in short order.</p><p>Then a thought wandered through Tsuna\u2019s brain that made him\nwant to cry.</p><p>He had to share it.</p><p>\u201cGokudera-kun,\u201d Tsuna said with trepidation. \u201cReborn is a\nhitman and she\u2019s an assassin, right? If they do courting like this, what does\nHibari-san do for courting?\u201d</p><p>Both of them went a bit blank at the thought. The only thing\nin mind was an island sinking to the sea.</p><p>Yamamoto, on Tsuna\u2019s other side, laughed cheerfully. \u201cI\nheard that when Squalo and Xanxus went courting, there was a mass grave being\ndug beside the Varia Mansion.\u201d</p><p>Gokudera leapt for Yamamoto\u2019s throat with his <i>teeth.</i></p><p>Tsuna buried his head in hands and started laughing. Either\nthat or sob hysterically.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p><b>Harry\u2019s gifts to\nReborn \u2013 Food (coffee), Art, the Beneventi.</b></p><p><b>Reborn\u2019s gifts to\nHarry \u2013 Additional land, Poetry and Art.</b></p><p><b>Like, lmao.

That happened every other week or so and it happened\nwithout warning that Tsuna had gotten used to the sudden attacks. Being the\nWorld\u2019s Greatest Hitman wasn\u2019t just an empty boast and it meant that other assassins\nregularly came to test their mettle. </p><p>That was fine. It was fine! He was used to checking his food\nand his things and his bed and everywhere he stepped for traps. Watching Reborn\nreact was amazing, because the attacks didn\u2019t fall through. Reborn was immune\nto an amazing amount of poisons, he was fast and nimble enough to avoid traps\nand attacks were scoffed at. Even distance shots from snipers were dodged at\nthe last second.</p><p>No. The thing was, after testing themselves once on Reborn,\nassassins usually left.</p><p>And she did! Which was the usual.</p><p>Except, what was unusual was the pout on Reborn\u2019s face when\nhe found out that she\u2019d undone her bindings in the middle of the night and <i>stolen Reborn\u2019s fedora.</i></p><p>Reborn was usually very protective of his fedora and Tsuna\ncouldn\u2019t even move it without setting off a hundred traps. And Tsuna had <i>seen </i>Reborn kill and go on a rampage for\nhis fedora. That the assassin got away with just a pout.</p><p><i>That</i>. That was the\nproblem.</p><p>.</p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>.</p><p>\u201cHarriet Potter,\u201d Hermione sighed.</p><p>Harry smiled winningly, a black fedora with a yellow band\nperched on her red hair. \u201cYes, Hermione.\u201d</p><p>Hermione dropped the stacks of paper on Harry\u2019s desk and\nscowled. \u201cHarry, you made this organization to help orphaned children and to\npromote equality. You\u2019re hiring squibs and everything. You can\u2019t just hare off\nin the middle of the night and come back a week later! Where were you? I was\nworried sick!\u201d</p><p>She dropped the smile and hugged Hermione around the waist.\n\u201cSorry. I just had to introduce myself to the local powers. They\u2019re all nice\nand very reasonable people.\u201d</p><p>The brunette sat down and gave the impression of \u2018not\nbudging\u2019. \u00a0Harry resigned herself to\nexplaining.</p><p>\u201cVongola is cleaning up Italy, Hermione. One of the things\nthey don\u2019t tolerate is human trafficking. They have burned down organizations\nthat deal with human trafficking and human experimentation. So. I just had to\nexplain to them where our employees and orphans come from, so that they don\u2019t\nsend someone to kill us all.\u201d</p><p>Hermione shook her head. \u201cI think you\u2019re supposed to do an\nappointment when you do that, Harry. Arriving out of nowhere would be rude.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked in surprise. \u201cBut I observed Vongola for a\nwhile. There\u2019s one super powerful guy there that everyone randomly attacks.\nIsn\u2019t he supposed to be the boss, if that\u2019s the case?\u201d</p><p>Since Harry\u2019s sense of normal had been skewed by having\nVoldemort as an enemy, Hermione was her only basis of comparison.</p><p>And judging by Hermione\u2019s face, she had failed.</p><p>\u201cHarry, people don\u2019t randomly attack their boss. That would\nbe suicidal. Instead, you should have looked for the most protected person\nthere,\u201d she answered patiently.</p><p>Thinking back on it, aside from the women and children, the\nmost protected person who always had one person with him no matter the time of\nday was\u2026</p><p>\u201cThere was that wimpy looking person who had a nice smile,\u201d\nshe mused. \u201cI thought he might have been the assistant though, with how he\nwhined. He didn\u2019t even try to delegate his paperwork to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes him a nice boss!\u201d Hermione roared, finally fed\nup with the topic. \u201cUnlike you! Finish signing, we need those requisition\nforms!!\u201d</p><p>Harry sulked and resigned herself to signing paperwork for\nthe whole day.</p><p>Though\u2026if she got the wrong person\u2026does that mean she\nhad to return the hat? She <i>liked</i> the\nhat.</p><p>But\u2026.she liked the man who owned the hat too. He had such\nlovely fingers.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Three days later, Reborn entered his room to find a package\nof coffee beans, a cup of espresso and his fedora perched on his bed.</p><p>While he slowly checked his precious hat for any damage of\ntampering, Leon investigated the coffee and the beans for any signs of poison\nor irregularities. </p><p>When the chameleon didn\u2019t react, he took one cautious sip\nand went still.</p><p>He had a very discerning palate and he knew where the coffee\ncame from. It was from his favourite coffee shop, in <i>Vienna.</i> He lived in the Vongola Mansion, in Italy. How on earth did\nshe keep it warm? It was still <i>steaming</i>\nwhen he arrived.</p><p>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d he mused.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t exactly know <i>what</i> she\u2019d done, but she knows that it must be something because\nHermione\u2019s smile was manic. And Ginny was right next to her, smile just as\nwide.</p><p>It worried her slightly. The last time she\u2019d seen them\ntogether and that happy, Malfoy Manor exploded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too happy,\u201d Harry told them bluntly - suspiciously.\n\u201cWhat happened now?\u201d</p><p>Ginny giggled. \u201cSuch an accusatory tone. You remember that\ndirty politician that kept asking us for bribes when we set up a factory in his\ndistrict? He gave us the green light to build our building, along with an\nadditional fifty hectares. I can now add a laboratory for George.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked several times just to parse through the words.\nBecause that man had been the definition of greedy and he\u2019d wanted them to pay\nhim a tithe for everything they earned. On top of the taxes they paid yearly.</p><p>\u201cNone of you blackmailed him, did you?\u201d she had to ask.</p><p>Hermione sniffed. \u201cNo. I\u2019m even a bit irritated that we\ndidn\u2019t think to do that first.\u201d</p><p>Ruthless, thy name was Hermione.</p><p>Harry gave a small smile at the thought. A ruthless Hermione\nwas a scarily efficient Hermione.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check it out,\u201d Harry murmured. Because <i>something</i> had happened and Harry didn\u2019t\naccept good fortune at face value anymore.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Tsuna was giving him a look, and if Reborn hadn\u2019t been so\ncurious, he would have shot him on principle. He was much too young and\ninexperienced to be giving Reborn <i>looks</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou asked to see me?\u201d Reborn asked.</p><p>The Vongola Decimo - and it was the Vongola Decimo in front\nof him now, not his student \u2013 handed him a folder, looking disturbed.</p><p>\u201cReborn, this was supposed to be your mark next week,\u201d Tsuna\nsaid, fingers massaging his temples in an effort to stave off the headache.\n\u201cBecause the Moretti were found doing human trafficking, targeting young\ntourists in airports. Except.

Using blood spray?\u201d Gokudera asked. He\ndidn\u2019t look disturbed but fascinated. So was Reborn.</p><p>\u201cAnd they made the blood spray to resemble Leon,\u201d Reborn\nfinished. He didn\u2019t quite manage to hide the smile in his voice and Tsuna\ngroaned.</p><p>\u201cReborn,\u201d Tsuna said, voice going very near a whine. \u201cThe\ndisposal team was <i>disturbed</i>. They\nclean up after <i>Hibari </i>and they were\ndisturbed. Do you know what it takes to disturb the disposal team?\u201d</p><p>Reborn did know.

I thought they\nhad paid off all the judges, the police and the detectives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Tsuna answered dryly. \u201cI tried once, do you remember?\nThey just got out and wandered around again in a week. Those connections run\ndeep.\u201d</p><p>And the act itself was amazing, because she had gotten the\nwhole famiglia.

Where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>Tsuna downed the entire bottle in one go, internally\nscreaming the whole time.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>\u201cHermione, we\u2019re pretty sure the assassin courting her is a <i>muggle</i>, right?\u201d Ginny asked.</p><p>Hermione didn\u2019t answer, pretty much transfixed on the\npainting of Voldemort being roasted alive on a stake. Harry was absolutely no\nhelp, giggling every time the moving painting restarted again, with Voldemort\nbeing dragged there by Grawp, tied to a stake and then lit on fire by a\ncackling redhead that vaguely resembled Ron. The silent screams as\npainting-Voldemort burned were an extra touch.</p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p>If Harry wasn\u2019t already invested in that man, Ginny would\nhave tried to have a go at him herself.</p><p>Harry turned to them; eyes alight with laughter and\nhappiness. It took Ginny\u2019s breath away. Moving to Italy and helping out a dozen\norphans in need had lightened the darkness in Harry\u2019s eyes but this was the\nfirst time that she had seen her friend smile again and smile like she meant\nit.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I don\u2019t know how he got this, but\u2026\u201d she paused,\nlooking insecure and hesitant.</p><p>George swooped down and noogied her on the head. \u201cAw,\nscarface. If you want some time off so you can hunt down your assassin, you can\nalways say so! Just come back after a week, or else we\u2019ll hunt you down!\u201d</p><p>Hermione nodded. \u201cI approve. This is a tasteful gift.\u201d</p><p>Everybody tactfully ignored the tears that glistened down\nHermione\u2019s cheeks. </p><p>Ginny\u2019s smirk was wicked. \u201cTie him down, Potter. Tie him\ndown and drag him here. It\u2019s time for an introduction.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Harry, being Harry, took them all literally.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>Reborn woke up with his wrists handcuffed to the bed posts\nand his body weighted down by another body.</p><p>\u201cYou made me wait,\u201d he announced.</p><p>The redhead napping on him blinked awake and smiled\nsleepily, \u201cIt took a while.

It\u2019s your fault, teasing me\nlike that. Such lovely erotic poetry you sent me.\u201d</p><p>Catching her eyes, he nodded minutely and she laughed,\ndelighted and started to undo his shirt.

Because he wanted to bottle it and put\nit for sale. He\u2019d be a billionaire in short order.</p><p>Then a thought wandered through Tsuna\u2019s brain that made him\nwant to cry.</p><p>He had to share it.</p><p>\u201cGokudera-kun,\u201d Tsuna said with trepidation. \u201cReborn is a\nhitman and she\u2019s an assassin, right? If they do courting like this, what does\nHibari-san do for courting?\u201d</p><p>Both of them went a bit blank at the thought. The only thing\nin mind was an island sinking to the sea.</p><p>Yamamoto, on Tsuna\u2019s other side, laughed cheerfully. \u201cI\nheard that when Squalo and Xanxus went courting, there was a mass grave being\ndug beside the Varia Mansion.\u201d</p><p>Gokudera leapt for Yamamoto\u2019s throat with his <i>teeth.</i></p><p>Tsuna buried his head in hands and started laughing.

                "content": "<p><b>Or rather, Love at\nFirst Assassination Attempt</b><br /></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The problem <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i>\nthat someone tried to assassinate Reborn.</p><p>Nope. That happened every other week or so and it happened\nwithout warning that Tsuna had gotten used to the sudden attacks. Being the\nWorld&rsquo;s Greatest Hitman wasn&rsquo;t just an empty boast and it meant that other assassins\nregularly came to test their mettle. </p><p>That was fine. It was fine! He was used to checking his food\nand his things and his bed and everywhere he stepped for traps. Watching Reborn\nreact was amazing, because the attacks didn&rsquo;t fall through. Reborn was immune\nto an amazing amount of poisons, he was fast and nimble enough to avoid traps\nand attacks were scoffed at. Even distance shots from snipers were dodged at\nthe last second.</p><p>No. The thing was, after testing themselves once on Reborn,\nassassins usually left.</p><p>And she did! Which was the usual.</p><p>Except, what was unusual was the pout on Reborn&rsquo;s face when\nhe found out that she&rsquo;d undone her bindings in the middle of the night and <i>stolen Reborn&rsquo;s fedora.</i></p><p>Reborn was usually very protective of his fedora and Tsuna\ncouldn&rsquo;t even move it without setting off a hundred traps. And Tsuna had <i>seen </i>Reborn kill and go on a rampage for\nhis fedora. That the assassin got away with just a pout.</p><p><i>That</i>. That was the\nproblem.</p><p>.</p><hr /><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Harriet Potter,&rdquo; Hermione sighed.</p><p>Harry smiled winningly, a black fedora with a yellow band\nperched on her red hair. &ldquo;Yes, Hermione.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione dropped the stacks of paper on Harry&rsquo;s desk and\nscowled. &ldquo;Harry, you made this organization to help orphaned children and to\npromote equality. You&rsquo;re hiring squibs and everything. You can&rsquo;t just hare off\nin the middle of the night and come back a week later! Where were you? I was\nworried sick!&rdquo;</p><p>She dropped the smile and hugged Hermione around the waist.\n&ldquo;Sorry. I just had to introduce myself to the local powers. They&rsquo;re all nice\nand very reasonable people.&rdquo;</p><p>The brunette sat down and gave the impression of &lsquo;not\nbudging&rsquo;. &nbsp;Harry resigned herself to\nexplaining.</p><p>&ldquo;Vongola is cleaning up Italy, Hermione. One of the things\nthey don&rsquo;t tolerate is human trafficking. They have burned down organizations\nthat deal with human trafficking and human experimentation. So. I just had to\nexplain to them where our employees and orphans come from, so that they don&rsquo;t\nsend someone to kill us all.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione shook her head. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re supposed to do an\nappointment when you do that, Harry. Arriving out of nowhere would be rude.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry blinked in surprise. &ldquo;But I observed Vongola for a\nwhile. There&rsquo;s one super powerful guy there that everyone randomly attacks.\nIsn&rsquo;t he supposed to be the boss, if that&rsquo;s the case?&rdquo;</p><p>Since Harry&rsquo;s sense of normal had been skewed by having\nVoldemort as an enemy, Hermione was her only basis of comparison.</p><p>And judging by Hermione&rsquo;s face, she had failed.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, people don&rsquo;t randomly attack their boss. That would\nbe suicidal. Instead, you should have looked for the most protected person\nthere,&rdquo; she answered patiently.</p><p>Thinking back on it, aside from the women and children, the\nmost protected person who always had one person with him no matter the time of\nday was&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;There was that wimpy looking person who had a nice smile,&rdquo;\nshe mused. &ldquo;I thought he might have been the assistant though, with how he\nwhined. He didn&rsquo;t even try to delegate his paperwork to anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That makes him a nice boss!&rdquo; Hermione roared, finally fed\nup with the topic. &ldquo;Unlike you! Finish signing, we need those requisition\nforms!!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry sulked and resigned herself to signing paperwork for\nthe whole day.</p><p>Though&hellip;if she got the wrong person&hellip;does that mean she\nhad to return the hat? She <i>liked</i> the\nhat.</p><p>But&hellip;.she liked the man who owned the hat too. He had such\nlovely fingers.</p><p>.</p><hr /><p>.</p><p>Three days later, Reborn entered his room to find a package\nof coffee beans, a cup of espresso and his fedora perched on his bed.</p><p>While he slowly checked his precious hat for any damage of\ntampering, Leon investigated the coffee and the beans for any signs of poison\nor irregularities. </p><p>When the chameleon didn&rsquo;t react, he took one cautious sip\nand went still.</p><p>He had a very discerning palate and he knew where the coffee\ncame from. It was from his favourite coffee shop, in <i>Vienna.</i> He lived in the Vongola Mansion, in Italy. How on earth did\nshe keep it warm? It was still <i>steaming</i>\nwhen he arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;How interesting,&rdquo; he mused.</p><p>.</p><hr /><p>.</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t exactly know <i>what</i> she&rsquo;d done, but she knows that it must be something because\nHermione&rsquo;s smile was manic. And Ginny was right next to her, smile just as\nwide.</p><p>It worried her slightly. The last time she&rsquo;d seen them\ntogether and that happy, Malfoy Manor exploded.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too happy,&rdquo; Harry told them bluntly - suspiciously.\n&ldquo;What happened now?&rdquo;</p><p>Ginny giggled. &ldquo;Such an accusatory tone. You remember that\ndirty politician that kept asking us for bribes when we set up a factory in his\ndistrict? He gave us the green light to build our building, along with an\nadditional fifty hectares. I can now add a laboratory for George.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry blinked several times just to parse through the words.\nBecause that man had been the definition of greedy and he&rsquo;d wanted them to pay\nhim a tithe for everything they earned. On top of the taxes they paid yearly.</p><p>&ldquo;None of you blackmailed him, did you?&rdquo; she had to ask.</p><p>Hermione sniffed. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m even a bit irritated that we\ndidn&rsquo;t think to do that first.&rdquo;</p><p>Ruthless, thy name was Hermione.</p><p>Harry gave a small smile at the thought. A ruthless Hermione\nwas a scarily efficient Hermione.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check it out,&rdquo; Harry murmured. Because <i>something</i> had happened and Harry didn&rsquo;t\naccept good fortune at face value anymore.</p><p>.</p><hr /><p>.</p><p>Tsuna was giving him a look, and if Reborn hadn&rsquo;t been so\ncurious, he would have shot him on principle. He was much too young and\ninexperienced to be giving Reborn <i>looks</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;You asked to see me?&rdquo; Reborn asked.</p><p>The Vongola Decimo - and it was the Vongola Decimo in front\nof him now, not his student &ndash; handed him a folder, looking disturbed.</p><p>&ldquo;Reborn, this was supposed to be your mark next week,&rdquo; Tsuna\nsaid, fingers massaging his temples in an effort to stave off the headache.\n&ldquo;Because the Moretti were found doing human trafficking, targeting young\ntourists in airports. Except. Someone&hellip;I don&rsquo;t even know what to call it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Hayato Gokudera peered by Reborn&rsquo;s shoulder and Reborn\nallowed it, if only to share the beauty he was seeing.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that&hellip;.art? Using blood spray?&rdquo; Gokudera asked. He\ndidn&rsquo;t look disturbed but fascinated. So was Reborn.</p><p>&ldquo;And they made the blood spray to resemble Leon,&rdquo; Reborn\nfinished. He didn&rsquo;t quite manage to hide the smile in his voice and Tsuna\ngroaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Reborn,&rdquo; Tsuna said, voice going very near a whine. &ldquo;The\ndisposal team was <i>disturbed</i>. They\nclean up after <i>Hibari </i>and they were\ndisturbed. Do you know what it takes to disturb the disposal team?&rdquo;</p><p>Reborn did know. But still, it took serious skill to\ncalculate the blood spray and the angle to make a Leon painting. And he could\ntell it was just blood spray, no extra smears. </p><p>It was a beautiful bloody painting, and they&rsquo;d done it for\nReborn.</p><p>So. Maybe blackmailing that politician was worth it. It&rsquo;s\nnot every day that he got to see art like this.</p><p> &ldquo;Do you know who it\nis?&rdquo; Tsuna asked.</p><p>An image of a redhead with a wicked smile appeared in his\nhead and he shook his head with a wry smile. &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll deal with it,&rdquo; he\nsmiled.</p><p>Tsuna and Gokudera exchanged alarmed glances. They had never\nseen Reborn smile like <i>that</i>.</p><p>.</p><hr /><p>.</p><p>From Harry&rsquo;s office came loud, cackling laughter.</p><p>George, sitting beside Ginny and trying to parse through\ncomplicated and convoluted scientific reports, stiffened.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know something I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he had to ask. Because the\nlast time he heard her laugh like that was years ago, when Ron was still alive.</p><p>Ginny smirked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated. It&rsquo;s almost like&hellip;well,\nit&rsquo;s either Harry&rsquo;s courting an assassin or she&rsquo;s being courted by an assassin.\nEither way, there&rsquo;s a very graphic exchange of gifts going on.&rdquo;</p><p>Graphic was a nice word for it. Ginny didn&rsquo;t even know you\ncould calculate blood pressure to make an arterial blood spray art. But Harry\ndid it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious,&rdquo; Ginny murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go check out what he&rsquo;s\ngot her this time.&rdquo;</p><p>A moment later, Ginny came back looking bemused.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; George asked, unable to take the suspense anymore.</p><p>Ginny shook her head, red strands that were lose from her\nbraid going everywhere. &ldquo;He got her poetry. Using <i>viscera</i> as a writing medium.&rdquo;</p><p>George blinked. &ldquo;Visc &ndash; Ginny, you don&rsquo;t mean <i>intestines</i>, do you? Because that&rsquo;s just\nunhygienic.&rdquo;</p><p>Hermione, rushing past them with a longsuffering expression,\nstopped and groaned. &ldquo;George, you&rsquo;re missing the point. You&rsquo;re supposed to say,\n&lsquo;It&rsquo;s creepy, it&rsquo;s disturbing, can we please get a restraining order?&rsquo; instead\nof pointing out the lack of hygiene!&rdquo;</p><p>Ginny ignored Hermione. &ldquo;What intestines did he even use, is\nmy question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as bad as everyone else,&rdquo; Hermione huffed. &ldquo;I have\nto dispose of it now. The kids shouldn&rsquo;t see this.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><hr /><p>.</p><p>Reborn&rsquo;s delighted laughter when he saw the folder in Tsuna&rsquo;s\nhand was full of schadenfreude.</p><p>Gokudera, no fool, took one step back.

I thought they\nhad paid off all the judges, the police and the detectives?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tsuna answered dryly. &ldquo;I tried once, do you remember?\nThey just got out and wandered around again in a week.
