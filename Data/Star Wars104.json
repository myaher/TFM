George Lucas deserves some heavy-duty praise after all the well-deserved criticism he took for Episodes One and Two.</p><!-- more --><p>During Episodes One and Two, I had some distance; I enjoyed them, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop obsessing about what was wrong with them and they didn&rsquo;t stay with me. They never felt like real <i>Star Wars </i>to me. But not this time. I was hooked from the first moment, and stayed completely absorbed until the final credits. Lucas gave us every single moment that we needed to see, tied up every loose end, and made it riveting at the same time. No stupid pod races, no Jar Jar (well, one second of Jar Jar, which was about right). The effects were out of this world, but they were there to support the story, which was what they were supposed to do.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a fun ride. I felt dread almost immediately, and just kept feeling it. It grew throughout, as we watched that beautiful young man lose his soul out of fear of losing his love. I was surprised that I desperately didn&rsquo;t want Anakin to turn into Darth Vader, all the while knowing that it was inevitable. And I cried, twice. So did Dan, which almost never happens.</p><p>Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are big talents that were pretty much wasted in Episodes One and Two, but their talent certainly wasn&rsquo;t wasted here. McGregor was terrific, clearly channeling Alec Guinness, and carrying so much of the drama. And Hayden Christensen &ndash; it&rsquo;s really his movie more than anyone else&rsquo;s, and frankly, I thought he was awesome. My heart just bled for him. Ian McDarmid, as the Emperor, was also very good, as was pretty much everyone else. There were no bad performances, or at least I didn&rsquo;t notice any. The stilted Lucas dialogue was present, but it didn&rsquo;t bother me because this was <i>Star Wars.</i> It really was.</p><p>The most disturbing scene was so hard to watch that Dan actually looked away (this was his second time, my first). It was seeing Anakin dismembered and burned. Extremely graphic and very disturbing, pretty far out there for a <i>Star Wars</i> movie. But again, it had to be. We all knew that there wasn&rsquo;t much left that was human, after all. The parallel scenes of Padme&rsquo;s death and Anakin&rsquo;s rebirth as Darth Vader were exceptionally strong, too.</p><p>Anyway, I cried, and I really can&rsquo;t get it out of my head. Those are the two major signs of an outstanding movie, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. I even want to go see it again in the theater, and I honestly don&rsquo;t do that much any more. I can see the critics finding something wrong with it and they may even be right, but frankly, if people don&rsquo;t find this movie totally engrossing, then they probably never really liked <i>Star Wars</i> in the first place.</p><p><b>Bits and pieces:</b></p><p>&ndash; How long was the break between Episodes 2 and 3? Anakin was clearly older; his face was scarred. Obi-Wan had grey at his temples.</p><p>&ndash; Chancellor Palpatine was such a minor player in the first two episodes. His seduction of Anakin and slow transformation into the Emperor was very effective. This was not an easy part to play. Samuel L. Jackson, who looked amazingly distinguished totally bald, did a fine job portraying the ambiguity that Anakin saw in the leader of the Jedi Council.</p><p>&ndash; They did some obvious echoes of Leia in Padme. The first time we see her, she&rsquo;s wearing The Hair: the cinnamon buns over the ears Princess Leia do. Then she did Leia&rsquo;s beige and brown look with the braid, too.</p><p>&ndash; Again, Lucas inserted bits that set up the earlier trilogy: Chewbacca, and the Wookiee army we should have gotten in Episode 6; a brief glance of the surface of Alderan; a quick glimpse of Grand Moff Tarkin.</p><p>&ndash; Perhaps George Lucas should have spread out some of the goodness in this film into the first two.</p><p>&ndash; The mass slaughter of the Jedis really got to me.

Exspecially since if you look at these two particular characters and how in a way they&rsquo;ve impacted the world.

We know that it is canon that Han was gone for a lot of Ben&rsquo;s childhood. That was also the time where he was abused by Snoke and started to turn dark. Then Luke tried to kill him. If you really think about it Ben probably felt unloved, like any child in that situation would. He ended up full of raw emotions and seems pretty lost in everything. He has issues with socializing, doesn&rsquo;t know how to properly express his emotions, and wants to let go of the past so bad but it just doesn&rsquo;t work like that. I see myself in that. My dad was gone a lot as a child, and when he was home he was a fiery ball of drunk exspecially after my uncle and grandma died. All of that led to a lot of unhappy memories. Now after all that has ended my family is happier, but things still get emotional sometimes. I have social anxiety (this makes school really hard because sometimes I just can&rsquo;t handle a large class), I freak out over small things, I have broke a few things out of pure anger, I do cry (a lot), just because some days I really can&rsquo;t handle the feeling of the past and I want it to go away. I never talk about my feelings about it because that doesn&rsquo;t ever work in my favour.

There won\u2019t be any more Star Wars, so he\u2019ll never have a chance of coming back. Disney (Lucasfilms particularly) will definitely be under a lot of fire, but nothing will change. So are we just expected to let Ben be killed off? I guess that\u2019s what they\u2019re assuming. You know from a spoiler I heard both Rey and Ben are going to be killed off and if that happens a lot of people are going to be pissed. Exspecially since if you look at these two particular characters and how in a way they\u2019ve impacted the world. Rey has been an inspiration to young girls and gave a glimpse of hope to some kid out there who never had a role model who was abandoned and told to fight for theirself like Rey had. </p><p>Ben has shown the world quite a lot. He\u2019s a flaming ball of emo. I understand and I\u2019ll flat out say it I am a flaming ball of emo too. Honestly Ben has been a role model for me. We know that it is canon that Han was gone for a lot of Ben\u2019s childhood. That was also the time where he was abused by Snoke and started to turn dark. Then Luke tried to kill him. If you really think about it Ben probably felt unloved, like any child in that situation would. He ended up full of raw emotions and seems pretty lost in everything. He has issues with socializing, doesn\u2019t know how to properly express his emotions, and wants to let go of the past so bad but it just doesn\u2019t work like that. I see myself in that. My dad was gone a lot as a child, and when he was home he was a fiery ball of drunk exspecially after my uncle and grandma died. All of that led to a lot of unhappy memories. Now after all that has ended my family is happier, but things still get emotional sometimes. I have social anxiety (this makes school really hard because sometimes I just can\u2019t handle a large class), I freak out over small things, I have broke a few things out of pure anger, I do cry (a lot), just because some days I really can\u2019t handle the feeling of the past and I want it to go away. I never talk about my feelings about it because that doesn\u2019t ever work in my favour. It\u2019s left this emotional hole in my soul, and of course none other than Ben Solo aka Kylo Ren has been the character I\u2019ve used to fill it. </p><p>If he were to die I\u2019d never be able to cope because I\u2019ve filled all my insecurities with my love for a fictional character named Ben Solo. If he died it would feel like a loved one dying. </p><p>I\u2019m not the only one who feels that way, because I\u2019ve talked to people in the same boat. </p><p>So I\u2019d hope Disney would figure that out and not kill him off. </p><p>A lot of us would not be able to deal with Kylo and/or Rey dead. I get that it\u2019s \u201cjust a movie\u201d to most people, but to a lot of us in the fandom it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s our childhood, it\u2019s our reason to smile, it\u2019s our emotional \u201csecurity blanket\u201d, it\u2019s the reason we\u2019ve made friends, it\u2019s what we spend our time enjoying, it\u2019s much more than just a movie and it\u2019s characters are more than just characters, they\u2019re who we see ourselves in and what let\u2019s us know at night that it\u2019s going to be okay no matter how big or small the struggle is.</p>",
