All the servants, including yourself, had gathered into Bakugou\u2019s conference room. You were all seated along the length of the table with the exception of Bakugou who was standing at the front. A large map showing the expanse of all 4 kingdoms spread across the wall in the front of the room. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be discussing our plan of action for when we take down The All Mighty King. I have gathered most of our materials, such as the potions and tools for our men. The last of the items we need are currently being produced at the factories and will be ready in about a week or two depending how fast those dipshits work.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018He\u2019s still rude even when talking about something important\u2026gross\u2026\u2019 </i></p><p>To be honest you really didn\u2019t want to be there. But as you were the very important aspect &ndash; pretty much the main aspect &ndash; for his grand plan to succeed. You had no other choice but to attend and do what you were quite stubborn at. Listening.</p><!-- more --><p>Everyone else was sitting very quietly, very attentive and absorbing every word that came out of the king\u2019s mouth. So you saw it best to do the same. For now at least.</p><p>\u201cOnce we have all our supplies, we gather all our men, arm ourselves and the dragons. We will move in 3 units. Each unit armed with 3 dragons and 20 men.\u201d</p><p>He pins the map with a large blue button, right on the Ugajin Kingdom, another yellow button over Suijin Kingdom and a red one over Fujin Kingdom, \u201cOne unit will head west to Ugajin Kingdom and another east to Suijin Kingdom. They both have an alliance with The All Mighty King, so they would most likely try to come to the All Mighty King\u2019s aid if anything were to happen, so you will act as a decoy to keep them from coming towards Fujin Kingdom.\u201d</p><p>Pointing to the red button, \u201cI will be in the main unit going towards Fujin Kingdom to face The All Mighty King and bring him to his downfall. Now I\u2019ll be assigning the leaders of each unit so if you\u2019re chosen. <i>You better not fuck it up</i>.\u201d</p><p>You gulped. You knew you were most likely, <strike>no way in hell</strike>, not going to be chosen for such a position because Bakugou needed your power. But you felt nervousness for the rest of the men in the room. No one wanted to be assigned such a high and trustworthy position, especially if it were for Bakugou\u2019s fleet. The pressure of having to do so well was unnerving and made the inexperienced servants scared out of their lives.</p><p>Bakugou glowered at the men, studying each and everyone of their faces. Deciding just by looks and by pure opinion who would be most suited for the job.</p><p>\u201cThe Ugajin fleet\u2026 (y/n)\u2019s dear friend will lead.\u201d </p><p>Your dear friend?&hellip;.

All the servants, including yourself, had gathered into Bakugou&rsquo;s conference room. You were all seated along the length of the table with the exception of Bakugou who was standing at the front. A large map showing the expanse of all 4 kingdoms spread across the wall in the front of the room. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be discussing our plan of action for when we take down The All Mighty King. I have gathered most of our materials, such as the potions and tools for our men.

But as you were the very important aspect &ndash; pretty much the main aspect &ndash; for his grand plan to succeed. You had no other choice but to attend and do what you were quite stubborn at. Listening.</p><p>Everyone else was sitting very quietly, very attentive and absorbing every word that came out of the king&rsquo;s mouth. So you saw it best to do the same. For now at least.</p><p>&ldquo;Once we have all our supplies, we gather all our men, arm ourselves and the dragons. We will move in 3 units. Each unit armed with 3 dragons and 20 men.&rdquo;</p><p>He pins the map with a large blue button, right on the Ugajin Kingdom, another yellow button over Suijin Kingdom and a red one over Fujin Kingdom, &ldquo;One unit will head west to Ugajin Kingdom and another east to Suijin Kingdom. They both have an alliance with The All Mighty King, so they would most likely try to come to the All Mighty King&rsquo;s aid if anything were to happen, so you will act as a decoy to keep them from coming towards Fujin Kingdom.&rdquo;</p><p>Pointing to the red button, &ldquo;I will be in the main unit going towards Fujin Kingdom to face The All Mighty King and bring him to his downfall.

You knew you were most likely, <strike>no way in hell</strike>, not going to be chosen for such a position because Bakugou needed your power. But you felt nervousness for the rest of the men in the room. No one wanted to be assigned such a high and trustworthy position, especially if it were for Bakugou&rsquo;s fleet. The pressure of having to do so well was unnerving and made the inexperienced servants scared out of their lives.</p><p>Bakugou glowered at the men, studying each and everyone of their faces. Deciding just by looks and by pure opinion who would be most suited for the job.</p><p>&ldquo;The Ugajin fleet&hellip; (y/n)&rsquo;s dear friend will lead.&rdquo; </p><p>Your dear friend?&hellip;. Bernard!?<br />Your eyes widened and you turned to your friend seated next to you. He was just as shocked as you were.

He knew you were bound to say something and he knew exactly how to counter you. </p><p>&ldquo;Bernard here, volunteered himself as a lead position if one were ever needed.
