wanted to visit them at the dorm since they were on a break, he wanted to hang out with them. of course he was going to being you with him. you sat next to seokjin on the couch. you had just told them a story about something that seokjin did recently. but as you kept talking, it seemed as if everyone was growing antsy and bored during your story. so you quickly ended the story but that left everyone confused. they all glanced at seokjin as if asking what was wrong but seokjin shrugged. the members waved it off and continued to talk but you remained silent, hardly laughing at their stories or jokes, hardly reaction at all. seokjin was worried that something had happened. he gently grabbed your hand, stroking it a bit, and leaned closer to you in order to drown out the others.\u00a0\u201chey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cnothing. just listening.\u201d</p><p>he shook his head.\u00a0\u201cwhat happened with your story earlier? the boys were enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cthey weren\u2019t. they looked like they weren\u2019t even listening. i talk too much seokjin.\u201d<br/></p><p>seokjin sighed.\u00a0\u201cy/n, it was all in your head. they all were enjoying your story about me tripping on the rug, falling onto the bed only to roll onto the floor. they were waiting for the end.\u201d</p><p>you looked at him.\u00a0\u201creally? they weren\u2019t annoyed that i was talking too much.\u201d</p><p>seokjin shook his head, smiling at you.\u00a0\u201cyou don\u2019t talk too much and you don\u2019t annoy anyone. now, continue your embarrassing story about me.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p><b>min yoongi</b></p><p>the boys had just finished a long day of practice. you had been with them for moral support. honestly you wanted to go home after since you were tired from a long day of helping the staff and supporting the boys, but namjoon wanted to treat everyone to a nice late dinner for all the hard work. you were fine now because who could ever refuse food and you loved to hang out with the boys? but something felt off to you. the boys were all joking and calling each other out on things or talking about cats, and this caused you too feel more like an eighth wheel. so you decided that you should just be quiet for once, instead of arguing or talking with the others. yoongi immediately noticed your silence. normally you would argue with seokjin about food but this time you agreed with him. plus, you haven\u2019t said a word when normally you would\u2019ve recited an entire speech by now.\u00a0\u201cwhy aren\u2019t you talking?\u201d he asked while eating.</p><p>you shrugged.\u00a0\u201ci\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201ci know you better than that, babe.\u201d he put don his food to look at you.\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br/></p><p>you glanced at the other boys before turning back to yoongi.\u00a0\u201ci just feel like i\u2019m annoying. i\u2019m an eighth wheel.\u201d</p><p>yoongi laughed at you.\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re not an eighth wheel. we\u2019re all friends here.\u201d</p><p>you shook your head.\u00a0\u201cjust admit it, i\u2019m annoying as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cmaybe, but then that would mean we all are annoying as hell. we all talk a lot too, y/n, you\u2019re no different. you shouldn\u2019t feel like you annoy everyone just because you\u2019re talkative.\u201d<br/></p><p>you nodded, smiling at yoongi.\u00a0\u201cthanks, yoong.\u201d</p><p><b>jung hoseok</b></p><p>you had come to see hoseok and the boys while they were at the dorms. you had brought them some food you made them. they all thanked you and tried to spark a conversation with you but you seemed off. they felt awkward because they didn\u2019t know what else to do. hoseok, as your boyfriend, noticed your mood. you would smile at them and he could tell that you were about to say or wanted to say something, but held yourself back. he looked at you, an idea popping into your head.\u00a0\u201cy/n, tell them about the pun you came up with this morning.\u201d</p><p>your eyes lit up but then you shook your head, a small smile on your face.\u00a0\u201cyou tell them, hoseok. it would be much better for you too.\u201d that hurt hoseok, you were very proud of your joke and was telling him that you would come by to tell seokjin and the others. but now you didn\u2019t want to.\u00a0\u201cwell, it\u2019s not funny if you don\u2019t tell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201ctell me, y/n.\u201d seokjin said with anticipation.\u00a0<br/></p><p>you shook your head and then suddenly stood up.\u00a0\u201ci just remembered. i think i left my stove on.\u201d</p><p>hoseok jumped up.\u00a0\u201ci\u2019m going home with you.\u201d</p><p>now you and hoseok were walking. you didn\u2019t say much then. hoseok grabbed your hand.\u00a0\u201cwhy is my little ray of sunshine so down?\u201d he asked in an attempt to get you to smile.</p><p>\u201ci just feel like i\u2019ve been annoying everyone recently. i talk too much.\u201d<br/></p><p>hoseok\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cif anything i talk too much. y/n, if this is about the others, the boys love you. they don\u2019t think you talk too much. and you\u2019re not at all annoying.\u201d</p><p>you sighed,\u00a0\u201ci guess i have just been overthinking everything then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cobviously. now, let\u2019s turn off this stove of yours.\u201d wink, wink.<br/></p><p><b>kim namjoon</b></p><p>recently, you had a friend that wasn\u2019t actually your friend. she was your coworker and somehow found out that you were dating kim namjoon. you haven\u2019t told anybody or the fans yet because namjoon wanted to wait. you were suspicious when this girl was suddenly all over you but you thought she was just being friendly. then one day, she questioned if you were dating, if you had met anyone famous. not wanting to reveal anything, you said you were single and would never have a chance to meet a celebrity. but then she called you a liar and became super heated about you. she called you annoying, saying you talked too much, revealing that she knew of your relationship. that drastically changed your mood. so here you were sitting next to namjoon and the boys, only you were staring off into space and not paying attention.</p><p>\u201clove?\u201d namjoon whispered. you looked at him. \u201cwhat happened?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201ctaehyung asked you a question.\u201d he said.<br/></p><p>\u201coh sorry, taehyung.\u201d<br/></p><p>he smiled.\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s fine. i was just asking if you wanted to say something. you\u2019ve been quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201ci\u2019d rather not.\u201d<br/></p><p>namjoon looked at you as if he had seen a ghost.\u00a0\u201cjagi, you love talking.\u201d</p><p>you sighed.\u00a0\u201crecently a girl i used to be friends with, she knew we were dating and had become friends with me. she wanted to meet you guys but of course i wasn\u2019t going to let her. so she called me annoying and said i spoke too much.\u201d</p><p>everyone looked at you in surprise. namjoon spoke.\u00a0\u201cyou are not annoying, y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cyeah, we love when you talk. you\u2019re funny and tell amazing stories.\u201d all the other members chimed in. they definitely cheered you up.<br/></p><p><b>park jimin</b></p><p>you and the boys were on a road trip. namjoon suggested it when he saw an ad for a new vacation spot. he thought why not since they were on vacation. you sat in the very back with jimin on your right and yoongi on his right. you had talked a lot for the first hour but after it there was silence. it was because everyone wanted to nap or listen to music but you wanted to overthink and came to the conclusion that it was because everyone was annoyed by you. you had been excited about this trip and now you felt that you were a tag along. you decided to remain quiet and not talk. two hours into the trip, everyone started to get full of energy from the ride and began to talk. eventually, seokjin (who was driving) had to check in the rear-view mirror,\u00a0\u201cif y/n still alive?\u201d he joked.</p><p>jimin and the other laughed. jimin replied.\u00a0\u201cthey are, they\u2019re just being super quiet.\u201d he then looked at you with concern in his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>you smiled but looked away.\u00a0\u201cwhy aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201ci\u2019ve annoyed everyone enough for today.\u201d<br/></p><p>he stared at you and then the members.\u00a0\u201cwhen have you ever annoyed us?\u201d</p><p>seokjin spoke up,\u00a0\u201cjust a minute ago i thought you were dead you were so quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201ci don\u2019t like when y/n\u2019s quiet.\u201d jungkook commented.<br/></p><p>your eyes widened. you looked at jimin. he smiled at you and wrapped an arm around your shoulder.\u00a0\u201cplease talk, jagi.\u201d</p><p><b>kim taehyung</b></p><p>you were sitting on the couch minding your own business. the boys were around you doing their own thing. yoongi was on his laptop, jungkook and taehyung were playing games, seokjin was in the kitchen cooking lunch, etc. you sat next to taehyung as he payed attention to his game. but suddenly, he jumped up.\u00a0\u201ci\u2019m finally better than jungkook!!!!\u201d he announced proudly.</p><p>you smiled at him before he pulled you off the couch, wanting you to dance with him. you did and then he turned your around the face the members.\u00a0\u201ctell how amazing i am, jagi.\u201d</p><p>you looked at the members, smiling at you and taehyung. but you suddenly felt shy and nervous.\u00a0\u201ctaehyung is amazing.\u201d you said quietly.</p><p>taehyung looked at you and turned around.\u00a0\u201care you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cyes. why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cnormally you\u2019d tell me that you were rooting for jungkook or give a speech about how much better i am compared to the others.\u201d<br/></p><p>you shrugged.\u00a0\u201ci don\u2019t feel like annoying everyone with my voice today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cevery time i start to talk, i annoy everyone.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cyou don\u2019t annoy anyone. please stop thinking that.\u201d<br/></p><p><b>jeon jungkook</b></p><p>you and the boy were at an amusement park. you had been dying to go since summer was coming to an end and the colder weather was around the corner. but you decided that you weren\u2019t going to annoy anyone on this trip. you wanted everyone to have fun, even if you weren\u2019t going to be able to because you wouldn\u2019t let yourself talk too much. upon entering the park. the boys became excited and loud. you wanted to join them but you stayed behind the group, keeping out of their way. you got so concentrated on staying silent (because you wanted to talk so bad) that you didn\u2019t even notice that the boys were trying to talk to you. you looked at them and smiled. jungkook turned to you.\u00a0\u201cwhat ride do you want to go on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>you shrugged.\u00a0\u201cyou guys choose.\u201d</p><p>jungkook stared at you, noticing something was off.\u00a0\u201cyou guys go ahead. we can meet up later.\u201d</p><p>the boys nodded and left. then jungkook looked at you.\u00a0\u201cis something wrong? i thought you were excited to

written on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201ci talk a lot.\u201d you told him.<br/></p><p>\u201coh,\u201d jungkook said, everything coming together in his mind.\u00a0\u201cjagi, everyone thought something

talking about cats, and this caused you too feel more like an eighth wheel. so you decided that you should just be quiet for once, instead of arguing or talking with the others. yoongi immediately

talked a lot for the first hour but after it there was silence. it was because everyone wanted to nap or listen to music but you wanted to overthink and came to the conclusion that it was because everyone was annoyed by you. you had been excited about this trip and now you felt that you were a tag along. you decided to remain quiet and not talk. two hours into the trip, everyone started to get full of energy from the ride and began to talk. eventually, seokjin (who was driving) had to check in the rear-view mirror,\u00a0\u201cif y/n still alive?\u201d he joked.</p><p>jimin and the other laughed. jimin replied.\u00a0\u201cthey are, they\u2019re just being super quiet.\u201d he then looked at you with concern in his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>you smiled but looked away.\u00a0\u201cwhy

to go since summer was coming to an end and the colder weather was around the corner. but you decided that you weren\u2019t going to annoy anyone on this trip. you wanted everyone to have fun, even if you weren\u2019t going to be able to because you wouldn\u2019t let yourself talk too much. upon entering the park. the boys became excited and loud. you wanted to join them but you stayed behind the group, keeping out of their way. you got so concentrated on staying silent (because you wanted to talk so bad) that you didn\u2019t even notice that the boys were trying to talk to you. you looked at them and smiled. jungkook turned to you.\u00a0\u201cwhat ride do you want to go on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>you shrugged.\u00a0\u201cyou guys choose.\u201d</p><p>jungkook stared at you, noticing something

he asked while eating.</p><p>you shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;i&rsquo;m just tired.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;i know you better than that, babe.&rdquo; he put don his food to look at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>you glanced at the other boys before turning back to yoongi.&nbsp;&ldquo;i just feel like i&rsquo;m annoying. i&rsquo;m an eighth wheel.&rdquo;</p><p>yoongi laughed at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not an eighth wheel. we&rsquo;re all friends here.&rdquo;</p><p>you shook your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;just admit it, i&rsquo;m annoying as hell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;maybe, but then that would mean we all are annoying as hell. we all talk a lot too, y/n, you&rsquo;re no different. you shouldn&rsquo;t feel like you annoy everyone just because you&rsquo;re talkative.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>you nodded, smiling at yoongi.&nbsp;&ldquo;thanks, yoong.&rdquo;</p><p><b>jung hoseok</b></p><p>you had come to see hoseok and the boys while they were at the dorms. you had brought them some food you made them. they all thanked you and tried to spark a conversation with you but you seemed off. they felt awkward because they didn&rsquo;t know what else to do. hoseok, as your boyfriend, noticed your mood. you would smile at them and he could tell that you were about to say or wanted to say something, but held yourself back. he looked at you, an idea popping into your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;y/n, tell them about the pun you came up with this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>your eyes lit up but then you shook your head, a small smile on your face.&nbsp;&ldquo;you tell them, hoseok. it would be much better for you too.&rdquo; that hurt hoseok, you were very proud of your joke and was telling him that you would come by to tell seokjin and the others. but now you didn&rsquo;t want to.&nbsp;&ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s not funny if you don&rsquo;t tell it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;tell me, y/n.&rdquo; seokjin said with anticipation.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>you shook your head and then suddenly stood up.&nbsp;&ldquo;i just remembered. i think i left my stove on.&rdquo;</p><p>hoseok jumped up.&nbsp;&ldquo;i&rsquo;m going home with you.&rdquo;</p><p>now you and hoseok were walking. you didn&rsquo;t say much then. hoseok grabbed your hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;why is my little ray of sunshine so down?&rdquo;
