The little boy was making noises the whole time until his father got too invested in what type of oatmeal would be better for a sensitive stomach. Then he asked, \u201cWhat do you think, Chicken?\u201d which was his name for his son. He looked around and saw him talking to a teen dressed in loose pants and a gold chain.</p><p>Then he lost his balance and held on to the closest thing he could reach, the stranger\u2019s pants. It was a silent standoff. He looked from his kid to the hop-hop youth. Then to his exposed panties. A moment later, Jin picked up his little chick and apologized profusely on behalf of his son. The guy said it was an accident, but that didn\u2019t stop Jin from putting his child into the basket and zooming off to the next aisle.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"bangthebae:zaLuQjW5DUvh3DPV_AzTEQ:Zpk6ix2dVU6yV\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d343847e41ce7dcc63c2157711b95948/tumblr_phsuvlMrgB1qi5pj9o1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><h2>Yoongi</h2><p>Was a day off really a day off when you had twins? For Yoongi, the answer was yes, no matter how mischievous they were. He took the two to the park and told them to stay out of trouble as he went down the street to get some picnic foods for the three of them. With their cute angelic faces, they said, \u201cOkay, appa!\u201d and off the man went. He got some banana milk and fruit bowls for the kids, and for himself, a soda and a sandwich. Also, if they were good, they\u2019d get half a chocolate bar each.</p><p>When Yoongi got back to the park, his kids quickly ran behind him screaming. A Man furiously holding up his pants began to berate the kids and ask if he was the father. He talked about how he was helping his daughter on one of the poles to slide down then the two pulled down his pants without warning. Yoongi used his pinky to dig out his ear, \u201cYou should\u2019t have made your pants so easy to pull down. Let\u2019s go have lunch, kids!\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dimplesbybts:az3NrflHAaOB8XPaxzm5mQ:ZOYuKx2LrmPap\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e16a7fc4ec2f2bdb4f3a822d0e5722e/tumblr_oq87vwpPmd1qleh04o2_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><!-- more --><h2>Hoseok</h2><p>No one was more excited than Papa Hobi to have his 4 year old child come to practice. She had just learned to walk on her own and was going to take dance practice starting next year. That was the plan at least. For now, she joined her dad and six uncles. She loved to hide and surprise her uncles. Jin always said she was lucky she was cute and tickled her. Her high pitched squeals were music to his ears.</p><p>After she was set down for a nap, the men practiced a new dance one more time before doing it once on camera. Everyone was focusing on themselves in the mirror and the music as this run through was being recorded. This meant no one noticed the little girl creeping up behind Uncle Kookie and pulling down his gym shorts. Everyone was wearing them for a uniformed look since it was being recorded. Why did it have to be him? All of her uncles burst out laughing and JHope apologized to the youngest but was laughing too hard to tell his child to apologize.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t&ndash;pfft&ndash;do that again, ok?\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"287\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sweaterpawsjimin:VuMhgZIi3PV63CU38-pcpw:ZxfFqk2KSkicp\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1aa3768f7ddcd0e54681e7c62acf177d/tumblr_oo65my6VAh1usdpugo2_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"287\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><h2>Namjoon (RM)</h2><p>His 10 year old was going through a Bad Boy phase. Maybe he should\u2019ve spent more time with him instead of letting him watch all those old Greaser movies. The young boy wouldn\u2019t be seen without his leather jacket, even in school. His closet was full of white shirts and different light wash jeans. Namjoon was taking care of him when he got called in for work. He took the 10 year old with him.</p><p>As Papa Joon worked in the studio, his oldest manager took care of his kid. The kid didn\u2019t like how arrogant and strict he was so he waited for him to fall asleep before tying his shoes together and pantsing him within the span of thirty seconds. \u201cGet back here you brat!\u201d Namjoon gave his kid a stern look and set his jaw. With a raise of his brow, the kid was on the floor apologizing to the manager. \u201cNo leather jacket for a week.\u201d</p><p>The kid started to cry as Namjoon apologized for his kid and took his child home. He hated when his dad got mad at him because it meant he went too far. Namjoon didn\u2019t get mad often, so when he did it was a big deal.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"jjeongukks:c6DfU4KCj0JGhp3BSc-xRg:Z5ldYy2Nz1VI3\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41763bcc7b509d8bdea1db4bf0a73ab1/tumblr_otbht9ZNz61qza1k3o1_r1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><h2>Jimin</h2><p>Jimin\u2019s triplets ran away from him. He was playing the kissing monster, and chased his kids around the house. People warned him that if he gave his kids too much affection they wouldn\u2019t take him seriously once they grew up. Jimin didn\u2019t want any help other than from the person he married in raising the kids. They had some time before Uncle Yoongi showed up.</p><p>\u201cBora, Sora&hellip;now where is\u2026\u201d Jimin\u2019s demeanor changed when he heard his only son squealing with laughter. Uncle Yoongi was here.</p><p>As he went into the hall to greet his hyung, he saw him trying to pull his pants back up. Raon was laughing as he grabbed onto Yoongi\u2019s back. \u201cLooking for someone?\u201d The older asked and Jimin told him to get off of his hyung&hellip;only after taking a picture for Instagram.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"jins-kiss:EYR71ePVKBJuQKb4XlvW9Q:ZUWaob2WUb4Yj\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1dff9481b68b7bddf6b5993dbba8f545/tumblr_p69b1yXvwh1wkj3xho1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><h2>Taehyung (V)</h2><p>Now we all know he\u2019s amazing with kids. All of his children were Daddy\u2019s kids. They loved being with him and would listen to him more than their other parent. He told them to listen to the other, but that was easier said than done. Lately, one of the middle children (called \uae30\ub9b0 because she was tall for her age) have had a fixation with pockets and was always reaching into them, even ones belonging to strangers. Tae had a lot of apologizing to do.</p><p>Today\u2019s was the biggest apology he\u2019s ever had to do. Since his betrothed was busy all of a sudden, they dropped the kids off at the studio where V was shooting his newest drama series. Everyone was so well behaved and loved their actor noonas, hyungs, oppas, and unnies. Suddenly \uae30\ub9b0 was nowhere to be found. Then the director screamed, but it wasn\u2019t cut. Her pants were on the ground and \uae30\ub9b0 was going through her pockets. V quickly picked up his child as everyone else looked away. He got on the floor to bow and made his tall girl do the same.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"194\" data-orig-width=\"189\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"bts-is-best-bias:2Y5z33IQZ6Xv24DW0FYPog:Z55UZe2KGohb3\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21619f89fe243f6b351738a5884f2a28/tumblr_onwbqlFb8J1w6n5gwo2_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"194\" data-orig-width=\"189\"/></figure><h2>Jungkook</h2><p>Being a working single dad was hard for Kookie, but seeing the face of his little Byungwoo made everything better. He was very responsible and cared for his dad a lot. Jungkook had put him to nap a while ago, so he could get some practice done in the living room. Jimin and V came over to practice with him. During a break, Byungwoo gave his dad and uncles water bottles from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me, I have a treat for you, but it\u2019s in my back pocket.\u201d V teased. Byung-ie then chased his uncle around the house trying to get whatever treat was hidden in his back pocket. The 7 year old then began to pout and gave up for a bit. Well, everyone thought he had given up until Tae\u2019s shorts were pulled to the ground by the little boy in order to reach what turned out to be a chocolate bonbon. Jungkook apologized, but V said it was ok. He really was Kookie\u2019s kid.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"deliciousgoldenkookie:To9GoFqp7Yqp8SwWkR72gA:ZRlrzr2Tm85xG\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85ee2b91bdd31dd1e2f172da69a03fa6/tumblr_p252n5PJhG1ston01o1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure>",

He took the 10 year old with him.</p><p>As Papa Joon worked in the studio, his oldest manager took care of his kid.

He really was Kookie\u2019s kid.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"deliciousgoldenkookie:To9GoFqp7Yqp8SwWkR72gA:ZRlrzr2Tm85xG\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85ee2b91bdd31dd1e2f172da69a03fa6/tumblr_p252n5PJhG1ston01o1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure></p>",

The little boy was making noises the whole time until his father got too invested in what type of oatmeal would be better for a sensitive stomach. Then he asked, &ldquo;What do you think, Chicken?&rdquo; which was his name for his son. He looked around and saw him talking to a teen dressed in loose pants and a gold chain.</p><p>Then he lost his balance and held on to the closest thing he could reach, the stranger&rsquo;s pants. It was a silent standoff. He looked from his kid to the hop-hop youth. Then to his exposed panties. A moment later, Jin picked up his little chick and apologized profusely on behalf of his son. The guy said it was an accident, but that didn&rsquo;t stop Jin from putting his child into the basket and zooming off to the next aisle.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2>Yoongi</h2><p>Was a day off really a day off when you had twins? For Yoongi, the answer was yes, no matter how mischievous they were. He took the two to the park and told them to stay out of trouble as he went down the street to get some picnic foods for the three of them. With their cute angelic faces, they said, &ldquo;Okay, appa!&rdquo; and off the man went. He got some banana milk and fruit bowls for the kids, and for himself, a soda and a sandwich. Also, if they were good, they&rsquo;d get half a chocolate bar each.</p><p>When Yoongi got back to the park, his kids quickly ran behind him screaming. A Man furiously holding up his pants began to berate the kids and ask if he was the father. He talked about how he was helping his daughter on one of the poles to slide down then the two pulled down his pants without warning. Yoongi used his pinky to dig out his ear, &ldquo;You should&rsquo;t have made your pants so easy to pull down. Let&rsquo;s go have lunch, kids!&rdquo;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2>Hoseok</h2><p>No one was more excited than Papa Hobi to have his 4 year old child come to practice. She had just learned to walk on her own and was going to take dance practice starting next year. That was the plan at least. For now, she joined her dad and six uncles. She loved to hide and surprise her uncles. Jin always said she was lucky she was cute and tickled her. Her high pitched squeals were music to his ears.</p><p>After she was set down for a nap, the men practiced a new dance one more time before doing it once on camera. Everyone was focusing on themselves in the mirror and the music as this run through was being recorded. This meant no one noticed the little girl creeping up behind Uncle Kookie and pulling down his gym shorts. Everyone was wearing them for a uniformed look since it was being recorded. Why did it have to be him? All of her uncles burst out laughing and JHope apologized to the youngest but was laughing too hard to tell his child to apologize.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&ndash;pfft&ndash;do that again, ok?&rdquo;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2>Namjoon (RM)</h2><p>His 10 year old was going through a Bad Boy phase. Maybe he should&rsquo;ve spent more time with him instead of letting him watch all those old Greaser movies. The young boy wouldn&rsquo;t be seen without his leather jacket, even in school. His closet was full of white shirts and different light wash jeans. Namjoon was taking care of him when he got called in for work. He took the 10 year old with him.</p><p>As Papa Joon worked in the studio, his oldest manager took care of his kid. The kid didn&rsquo;t like how arrogant and strict he was so he waited for him to fall asleep before tying his shoes together and pantsing him within the span of thirty seconds. &ldquo;Get back here you brat!&rdquo; Namjoon gave his kid a stern look and set his jaw. With a raise of his brow, the kid was on the floor apologizing to the manager. &ldquo;No leather jacket for a week.&rdquo;</p><p>The kid started to cry as Namjoon apologized for his kid and took his child home. He hated when his dad got mad at him because it meant he went too far. Namjoon didn&rsquo;t get mad often, so when he did it was a big deal.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2>Jimin</h2><p>Jimin&rsquo;s triplets ran away from him. He was playing the kissing monster, and chased his kids around the house. People warned him that if he gave his kids too much affection they wouldn&rsquo;t take him seriously once they grew up. Jimin didn&rsquo;t want any help other than from the person he married in raising the kids. They had some time before Uncle Yoongi showed up.</p><p>&ldquo;Bora, Sora&hellip;now where is&hellip;&rdquo; Jimin&rsquo;s demeanor changed when he heard his only son squealing with laughter. Uncle Yoongi was here.</p><p>As he went into the hall to greet his hyung, he saw him trying to pull his pants back up. Raon was laughing as he grabbed onto Yoongi&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Looking for someone?&rdquo; The older asked and Jimin told him to get off of his hyung&hellip;only after taking a picture for Instagram.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2>Taehyung (V)</h2><p>Now we all know he&rsquo;s amazing with kids. All of his children were Daddy&rsquo;s kids. They loved being with him and would listen to him more than their other parent. He told them to listen to the other, but that was easier said than done. Lately, one of the middle children (called &#44592;&#47536; because she was tall for her age) have had a fixation with pockets and was always reaching into them, even ones belonging to strangers. Tae had a lot of apologizing to do.</p><p>Today&rsquo;s was the biggest apology he&rsquo;s ever had to do. Since his betrothed was busy all of a sudden, they dropped the kids off at the studio where V was shooting his newest drama series. Everyone was so well behaved and loved their actor noonas, hyungs, oppas, and unnies. Suddenly &#44592;&#47536; was nowhere to be found. Then the director screamed, but it wasn&rsquo;t cut. Her pants were on the ground and &#44592;&#47536; was going through her pockets. V quickly picked up his child as everyone else looked away. He got on the floor to bow and made his tall girl do the same.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2>Jungkook</h2><p>Being a working single dad was hard for Kookie, but seeing the face of his little Byungwoo made everything better. He was very responsible and cared for his dad a lot. Jungkook had put him to nap a while ago, so he could get some practice done in the living room. Jimin and V came over to practice with him. During a break, Byungwoo gave his dad and uncles water bottles from the fridge.</p><p>&ldquo;That reminds me, I have a treat for you, but it&rsquo;s in my back pocket.&rdquo; V teased. Byung-ie then chased his uncle around the house trying to get whatever treat was hidden in his back pocket. The 7 year old then began to pout and gave up for a bit. Well, everyone thought he had given up until Tae&rsquo;s shorts were pulled to the ground by the little boy in order to reach what turned out to be a chocolate bonbon. Jungkook apologized, but V said it was ok. He really was Kookie&rsquo;s kid.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",
