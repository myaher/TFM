In fact, not having to mantain two separate lives has actually been very<b> liberating</b>.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>Marvel Knights Spider-Man #2</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m very glad for you guys, but by this moment, one guy found out who I am and killed my girlfriend, faked his death while he became a boss of organized crime/assembled a cult around himself in Europe, but only once he was certain his son would follow his lead as a super-villain with a vendetta against me, a particular shitty situation to be in since he was also my best friend\n\n (did I mention his son knew who I was, too, and used this knowledge to torture me by getting another villain to create androids of my dead parents, get me to love them and trust them, only for that trust to be the very catalyst for them to reveal their true colors and give me up, only one of them actually grew a conscience, so while I had to fight one of them as an enemy, the other one was protecting me and telling me she loved me, and both of them died violently in front of me?), arranged an extremely complicated scheme to make me believe I was a clone at the exact moment that I was the happiest since I had more to lose, tried to set me up against my clone (who, remember, at that moment I thought was the original, because of this guy) and, when that failed and we started to see each other as brothers, made a plan which involved killing all my friends and my brother right in front of me, in the hopes that that would keep me busy so I couldn\u2019t be with my wife while she had the miscarriage that he had arranged, a plan which succeeded in everything except the killing all my friends part. After a while there, where I again thought he might have been dead (by my hand - you know my stance on killing, you know how all this must have upset me), he came back, blackmailed Jameson into selling him part of the Bugle and giving him a lot of authority over the paper, which not only made him my boss, it also gave him the power to manipulate the public\u2019s opinion of me, started a campaign to clear his name, which inlcuded telling me to my face that he was dedicating all of it to my dead girlfriend <i>who he killed remember that part from the beginning </i>and many other volleys of that nature, then going into my house, which I shared with my wife and her aunt and tearing it apart in order to provoke, which led to that funny little video that made the rounds around that time of me beating up a\u00a0\u201cdefenseless\u201d citizen, who had already accused me of threatening his life, that being the reason he faked his death to the public, or so he claimed. As the very resourceful individual I already described him as, he also got a doctor to kidnap me a torture me psychologically through drugs, got the Trapster to kill a guy and frame me for it, lied about the time I hepled save his grandson and made it seem like I was in with it with the kidnapper who, oh, was some kind of misshappen clone that he created to dress up as the Green Goblin cast away any remaining suspicions that it was him. Yeah, he engineered his grandson\u2019s kidnapping. He\u2019s a revolting being, but right now we\u2019re focusing on what he did because he knew my secret identity. Except for a few snide remarks at work and trying to force me to reveal my secret id when an elevator crashed with the both of us and two other people in it by not making any effort to save us and leaving it all to me because there was a risk that the security cameras hadn\u2019t been disabled, he didn\u2019t do much until he went through this ritual, the Gathering of The Five, which left him insane when he was actually looking for the power to destroy me, then he blew up the Bugle, my workplace. Oh, but before that I found out that my aunt, who had died in between all these events of natural causes, was alive because he had kidnapped her and replaced her with an actress, the woman I saw die thinking it was my aunt, to&hellip; well, make me think the woman who was a mother to me died. Then he drugged me (through my toothpaste) so I\u2019d take on the Green Goblin identity and attack the people I care about, kidnapped me and tortured me for a week to try to mold me into a fitting heir for him, lotsa drugs and lotsa electrocution. When I still refused, he released a video painting me as my girlfriend\u2019s murderer (including a nice little \u2018if I was her boyfriend, I would hate Spider-Man), kidnapped a friend of mine, a recovering alcoholic, force fed him whiskey, put him behing the wheels of a complany truck and made him crash the school I work at, specifically my classroom, you know, targetting a place where children spend most of their waking moments, even if it was during the night. My friend ended up in a coma, he\u2019s still barely responding to stimuli at this very moment. Although I won the ensuing fight, something seems to be wrong with him at the moment (idk, he\u2019s just ooc) and now he\u2019s killing innocent people, you might have seen him on TV today, with 18 hostages in a church demanding that I disembowel myself with a steak-knife.</p><p>His son, besides that lovely anecdote I just told you about making me think my parents were alive only to take them away from me, also rigged a bomb in our apartment, kidnapped two friends of ours and my aunt and put a bomb near one of them, making me have to guess as to which of them was in danger, then tried to fight me. A psychiatrist made him think my and his dad\u2019s secret identities were fake. When he remembered everything, he went off the deep end and tried to kill me again, also leaving funny little messages form him to the people I cared about, reinforcing how much damage he can do as someone who not only knows my secret, but also is so entrenched in my personal life.</p><p>This other guy, when he discovered who I was, kidnapped me and went after my wife, possibly almost raping her through deception, and tried to hurt her, then disguised himself as me again and let me know that he\u2019d fooled my aunt and she was defenseless against him.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Venom, who went into my house with the sole purpose of scaring my wife, and threatened my loved ones in order to play his game by his rules. There\u2019s also Daredevil. He might not be a villain but he keeps giving me supoenas to defend this guy who\u2019s tried to murder me and my loved ones and succeeding in killing other people.</p><p>Also, consider that, as I just told you, I\u2019m asking for help because my aunt has been kidnapped by someone who knows who I am.\u00a0</p><p>So can we&hellip; not?

Although I won the ensuing fight, something seems to be wrong with him at the moment (idk, he&rsquo;s just ooc) and now he&rsquo;s killing innocent people, you might have seen him on TV today, with 18 hostages in a church demanding that I disembowel myself with a steak-knife.</p><p>His son, besides that lovely anecdote I just told you about making me think my parents were alive only to take them away from me, also rigged a bomb in our apartment, kidnapped two friends of ours and my aunt and put a bomb near one of them, making me have to guess as to which of them was in danger, then tried to fight me. A psychiatrist made him think my and his dad&rsquo;s secret identities were fake. When he remembered everything, he went off the deep end and tried to kill me again, also leaving funny little messages form him to the people I cared about, reinforcing how much damage he can do as someone who not only knows my secret, but also is so entrenched in my personal life.</p><p>This other guy, when he discovered who I was, kidnapped me and went after my wife, possibly almost raping her through deception, and tried to hurt her, then disguised himself as me again and let me know that he&rsquo;d fooled my aunt and she was defenseless against him.</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s Venom, who went into my house with the sole purpose of scaring my wife, and threatened my loved ones in order to play his game by his rules. There&rsquo;s also Daredevil. He might not be a villain but he keeps giving me supoenas to defend this guy who&rsquo;s tried to murder me and my loved ones and succeeding in killing other people.</p><p>Also, consider that, as I just told you, I&rsquo;m asking for help because my aunt has been kidnapped by someone who knows who I am.&nbsp;</p><p>So can we&hellip; not? With the secret identity thing? Right now?&rdquo;</p>",
