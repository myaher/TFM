airplane after a little more than two hour flight from seoul. you were exhausted, more so after the flight and it didn\u2019t help that it was very late. as you stepped into the airport, you noticed it was slightly deserted, probably due to the fact of how late it was. it was nice. the airport wasn\u2019t bustling with people and you could get through with ease.</p><p>you walked for a bit, your bag from your shoulder. it was beginning to ache from all the things you packed. you headed towards the exit where all the taxis would be. as you walked, you pulled out your phone. you turned off airplane mode and waited for everything to sync. you grinned when you noticed a text from your older brother, taehyung.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018<i>good night, sis!!! tae-oppa loves you!</i>\u2019</p><p>you could imagine his goofy grin when he sent that. you weren\u2019t that much younger than taehyung, but his title of being your older brother made him treat you like a child sometimes. you didn\u2019t mind.\u00a0</p><p>you knew that taehyung and the rest of bts were on tour. you knew they were in tokyo, japan for their next concert. you hadn\u2019t seen your brother in a while and you missed him. this brought you to the idea to visit him and the others while they were on tour. although, it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise. you had to call namjoon and tell him your plan so that you could book a room in the hotel they were staying at. you had to know where they were.\u00a0</p><p>on top of it, you didn\u2019t know too much japanese. but, that didn\u2019t stop you from getting into the taxi and telling the driver the address to the hotel. it was a short drive, luckily for you. you almost passed out in the backseat of a taxi.\u00a0</p><p>after the taxi driver pulled up to the entrance of the hotel while announcing the price you had to pay, you sighed with an excited smile. you handed him the money before grabbing all your things and stepping out of the car. the air was different compared to seoul. it felt nice to be traveling, especially when it was to another country. it was something you wanted to do but never had a chance or reason to. plus, it scared you to be traveling alone, especially in a foreign place. but nonetheless, you finally did it.</p><p>you walked into the lobby, greeting the lady at the front desk. you told her you were checking in. while she clicked and typed around, you opened your phone and sent a quick text to namjoon, asking if he and the others were still awake. if he didn\u2019t reply, she would go to her room and sleep and just ask for their room number in the morning. you had to look away when the lady began talking. she confirmed your identity and then handed you a single room key. you thanked the nice woman and headed to the elevators. by then, namjoon texted back.</p><p>\u2018<i>we\u2019re awake. just watching a movie. we\u2019re split between two rooms. 717 and 719.</i>\u2019 he informed you.</p><p>you nodded, finding that you\u2019re room was below their\u2019s. instead of hitting the number six button on the elevator, you hit seven and made you way up. you were growing anxious by the minute, though more excited and anxious. you loved the boys. it was like having seven older siblings.\u00a0</p><p>eventually, you reached 717 and 719, which was the room across from 717. you didn\u2019t know which one to choose. with a shrug you knocked on 717. you waited a few seconds, hearing a bit of shuffling on the other side. then the door swung open, revealing namjoon. you smiled.\u00a0\u201cnamjoon!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>he smiled and opened the door wider to let you in. you noticed three of other people: seokjin, yoongi, and hoseok. they divided by hyung and maknae line. you greeted everybody and talked with all of them for a bit. though yoongi was half asleep, they all expressed their joy of seeing you again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cwell, i am going to see tae now. catch you guys later!\u201d<br/></p><p>they nodded and you turned and left. you walked across the hall to 719 and knocked. you waited until the door swung open, revealing jungkook. your eyes widened slightly.\u00a0\u201cj-jungkook.\u201d you prayed your weren\u2019t blushing too much.</p><p>you see, you had a slight crush on jungkook. you have had feelings for him for as long as you can remember, probably meaning since taehyung first introduced you to jungkook. you gulped.</p><p>jungkook grinned,\u00a0\u201cy/n? y/n\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>little did you know, jungkook\u2019s heart was beating rapidly. he was tired from the day\u2019s schedule, but as soon as he saw you, he felt a rush of adrenaline. you heard heavy footsteps, like a stampede, coming your way and you noticed jimin and taehyung peer around the corner.\u00a0\u201cy/n!\u201d taehyung yelled excited.</p><p>jungkook opened the door and you walked passed him. taehyung ran towards you and wrapped his arms around you. you laughed at his bear hug.\u00a0\u201ci missed you too, tae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat brought you here?\u201d jimin asked.<br/></p><p>taehyung set you down, bringing a hand up to push back the bangs that covered his eyes after he hugged you. you blushed, slightly embarrassed at your reasoning.\u00a0\u201ci missed you guys. i wanted to surprise you.\u201d</p><p>taehyung look at you.\u00a0\u201cyou came here alone?\u201d</p><p>jungkook\u2019s eyes met you suddenly. you blushed when you caught a hint of worry in them. you shrugged off the odd feeling in your stomach and looked up at your older brother.\u00a0\u201ci did. i went to the airport by myself, i went through security by myself, i flew on a plane by myself, i entered a foreign country by myself, i managed to get here by myself. i did have namjoon\u2019s help though. he told me where to go.\u201d</p><p>taehyung was surprised.\u00a0\u201cwow.\u201d</p><p>jungkook nodded.\u00a0\u201chow long are you staying?\u201d</p><p>you shrugged.\u00a0\u201cwell you guys are leaving in two days so i\u2019ll go back then too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cso you have a room then?\u201d taehyung asked.\u00a0\u201cif you don\u2019t, we can share a bed. just like old times.\u201d<br/></p><p>taehyung\u2019s smile was something you could never forget. you smiled and peered around your older brother to see two queen sized beds. looking around, you noticed how the room was slightly on the untidy side. the bed sheets were bundled up on the beds, there were cups on the tables and tv stand, a few pieces of clothing were on the floor. you shook your head.\u00a0\u201cno, i have a room. 602.\u201d you told him.</p><p>taehyung nodded,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>jimin nodded.\u00a0\u201cwell, i\u2019m going to shower and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>you looked at jimin and then pulled out your phone, glancing at the time.\u00a0\u201coh! it\u2019s 12:46.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwell, you should go back to your room, y/n.\u201d<br/></p><p>you nodded and looked up at taehyung to flash a smile, a smile that closely resembles taehyung\u2019s.\u00a0\u201cgood night, big brother.\u201d you said.</p><p>he nodded,\u00a0\u201cgood night.\u201d</p><p>you walked towards their door. before you could touch the handle, jungkook appeared next to you.\u00a0\u201ccan i walk you to your room? please?\u201d</p><p>you felt a little nervous hearing him say this. you glanced at taehyung but he was already getting into the bed, not noticing that jungkook wasn\u2019t doing the same. you nodded. perhaps this was your chance to spark something between the two of you. you didn\u2019t think jungkook had feelings for you though. everyone in bts were you older brothers.\u00a0</p><p>you and jungkook left the room together, you quietly closing the door behind you. the first few minutes were a bit awkward and quiet. you wanted to break the silence but you didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0</p><p>you and jungkook entered the elevator. you pressed the number six.\u00a0\u201cso,\u201d you began.</p><p>jungkook sighed.\u00a0\u201cso.\u201d</p><p>you smiled, a light blush in your cheeks. jungkook\u2019s laugh made you turn your head. you looked up at him. you felt like you were looking at up a clear night sky full of bright, shining stars. jungkook was beautiful as he smiled and chuckled to himself. the awkward aura around you and him must of got to him. you just felt like you were looking at the world when you looked at jungkook.</p><p>the bell that signaled the doors were opening brought you out of your chance. before jungkook could notice, you looked away and stepped out. you made sure jungkook followed you. then you and him began to walk once more. you noticed that your and his walking pace was slow, as if you were trying to stall. you didn\u2019t want these short minutes with jungkook to end. you could your heart beat and your cheeks blush as you thought about him. why did he want to walk you to your room?</p><p>it didn\u2019t take long for you to arrive at 602. you looked down into your bag and fished around for you single room key. as your hand was in your bag, jungkook called your name. it was quiet. you looked up and not even half a second later, jungkook was cupping your cheeks and pressing his plump lips onto your own. your eyes widen. you just froze, your hand still in your bag.\u00a0</p><p>but the feelings jungkook was addicting. you closed your eyes and kissed him back. the kiss was like the spark that ignited the fire in your heart. you were completely in love with jungkook. and judging by how he initiated this kiss, jungkook was in love with you too. you didn\u2019t want to pull away, but you also didn\u2019t want to make out with jungkook in the middle of a hallway. you pulled away, feeling the high temperature in your cheeks. you bit your bottom lip and you met jungkook\u2019s eyes. he smiled at you.\u00a0\u201ci couldn\u2019t hold back anymore.\u201d</p><p>you smiled.\u00a0\u201cdid you wait until taehyung couldn\u2019t catch us? is that why you wanted to come with me?\u201d</p><p>jungkook\u2019s cheeks were slowly turning pink. he looked so cute in this moment.\u00a0\u201cyes.\u201d he replied.</p><p>you grinned excitedly before finally finding your room key. you hurriedly unlocked your room and grabbed jungkook\u2019s hand, tugging him inside.\u00a0\u201cwait, y/n, what are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>you closed the door, the door locking automatically. you tossed your bag onto the single queen sized bed before facing jungkook.\u00a0\u201cjungkook, i\u2019m in love with you.\u201d you frankly said.</p><p>jungkook smiled.\u00a0\u201ci think i know that from that kiss we just shared.\u201d</p><p>you blushed before approaching him again and planting your lips onto his. you had been waiting for this moment for ages, you felt like you just couldn\u2019t get enough of jungkook. jungkook immediately kissed you back, his arms snaking around your waist and pulling you close.</p><p>jungkook pushed you down on the bed. you laid on your side, jungkook doing the same. his arms were still wrapped around you. he pulled away, silly grin of his lips as his nose brushed against yours.\u00a0\u201cwill you be my girlfriend, y/n?\u201d</p><p>you blushed,\u00a0\u201cof course.\u201d</p><p>now that you were laying on the bed, you realized just how tired you were.\u00a0\u201chey, jungkook. you don\u2019t have a room key with you, right?\u201d</p><p>jungkook shook his head, his eyes flashing a glint of realization.\u00a0\u201ci won\u2019t be able to get back into the room&hellip;unless i want to wake taehyung and jimin up. they were question while i was gone.\u201d</p><p>you looked at him an idea in your head.\u00a0\u201cwell, might as well stay here.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>you were woken up by rather urgent knocking on your door. you groaned as you slowly woke up. you slowly pried your eyes open, seeing jungkook\u2019s face right in front of yours. his face held a glare, his eyes still closed. he was awake you could tell, but he didn\u2019t want to be. your attention was pulled away from jungkook when the knocking sounding once again. at this point, might as well wake up the entirety of the sixth floor.</p><p>you were forced to leave jungkook\u2019s embrace, slipping out of the covers. you had changed into some pajamas the night before&hellip;in the bathroom of course. you glanced at jungkook, catching him tugging at the bed sheets. you smiled before walking towards the door. you opened it, squinting at the bright lights from the hallway.\u00a0</p><p>it was taehyung.\u00a0</p><p>you gulped and pulled the door closer to you, hiding jungkook from taehyung\u2019s view. as if that would do you any good.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cis jungkook with you?\u201d he asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cwhy?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201che wasn\u2019t in the hotel room when we woke up this morning. and i recall hearing some whispering as i was getting into bed last night.\u201d<br/></p><p>you blushed, suddenly remembering the previous night.\u00a0\u201cwell, you see, taehyung, my lovely older brother, jungkook did in fact walk me to my room last night.\u201d you pursed your lips.</p><p>taehyung narrowed his eyes.\u00a0\u201che\u2019s here, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>taehyung then pushed open the door and stepped inside. he saw jungkook sitting up in bed still half-asleep. your older brother whipped around, his facial expression telling you to spill the details. you felt your shoulders drop.\u00a0\u201cnothing happened, tae. he walked me to my room and he didn\u2019t have his room key to your room so he stayed with me.\u201d you met taehyung\u2019s eyes, he knew there was more to the story.\u00a0\u201cokay, and we may had kissed once or twice. but nothing more than that, i swear!\u201d</p><p>taehyung crossed his arms over his chest. his facial expression was intimidating, but it did nothing considering that he was still in his tata pajamas. jungkook met taehyung\u2019s eyes, standing up from the bed.\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s telling the truth, hyung. i simple walked her here, we kissed, i asked her to be my girlfriend, and because i couldn\u2019t get back into the room and i didn\u2019t want to wake anyone else up, and it was really late, y/n suggested that i stay in her room.\u201d</p><p>taehyung sighed.\u00a0\u201ci guess i can\u2019t do anything about your feelings.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>you and jungkook, standing next to each other, stared anxiously at taehyung. taehyung met your eyes. you could easily tell his was trying not to grin.\u00a0\u201cyou and jungkook really look good together.\u201d he admitted.</p><p>you grinned, jungkook blushed.\u00a0\u201calright, i will allow jeon jungkook to date my little sister, kim y/n. however, if you so much think about hurting her in any way, shape, or form, i won\u2019t hesitate to hurt you. i trust you won\u2019t, and it would be awkward since we are in a band together, but other than that, i\u2019m fine with it.\u201d</p><p>you ran over to your older brother and jumped into his arms.\u00a0\u201cthank you, taehyung, thank you. thank you!\u201d</p><p>he smiled into your shoulder as he hugged your back.\u00a0\u201canything to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>jungkook grinned.\u00a0\u201cthank you, hyung.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>you were pretty excited to start a new chapter in your life, especially one with jungkook now that he was your boyfriend. you couldn\u2019t help but think about how everything happened in japan, in a simple hotel. everything that marked the beginning of your and jungkook\u2019s relationship, all in room 602.</p>",

airplane after a little more than two hour flight from seoul. you were exhausted, more so after the flight and it didn\u2019t help that it was very late. as you stepped into the airport, you noticed it was slightly deserted, probably due to the fact of how late it was. it was nice. the airport wasn\u2019t bustling with people and you could get through with ease.</p><p>you walked for a bit, your bag from your shoulder. it was beginning to ache from all the things you packed. you headed towards the exit where all the taxis would be. as you walked, you pulled out your phone. you turned off airplane mode and waited for everything to sync. you grinned when you noticed a text from your older brother, taehyung.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018<i>good night, sis!!! tae-oppa loves you!</i>\u2019</p><p>you could imagine his goofy grin when he sent that. you weren\u2019t that much younger than taehyung, but his title of being your older brother made him treat you like a child sometimes. you didn\u2019t mind.\u00a0</p><p>you knew that taehyung and the rest of bts were on tour. you knew they were in tokyo, japan for their next concert. you hadn\u2019t seen your brother in a while and you missed him. this brought you to the idea to visit him and the others while they were on tour. although, it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise. you had to call namjoon and tell him your plan so that you could book a room in the hotel they were staying at. you had to know where they were.\u00a0</p><p>on top of it, you didn\u2019t know too much japanese. but, that didn\u2019t stop you from getting into the taxi and telling the driver the address to the hotel. it was a short drive, luckily for you. you almost passed out in the backseat of a taxi.\u00a0</p><p>after the taxi driver pulled up to the entrance of the hotel while announcing the price you had to pay, you sighed with an excited smile. you handed him the money before grabbing all your things and stepping out of the car. the air was different compared to seoul. it felt nice to be traveling, especially when it was to another country. it was something you wanted to do but never had a chance or reason to. plus, it scared you to be traveling alone, especially in a foreign place. but nonetheless, you finally did it.</p><p>you walked into the lobby, greeting the lady at the front desk. you told her you were checking in. while she clicked and typed around, you opened your phone and sent a quick text to namjoon, asking if he and the others were still awake. if he didn\u2019t reply, she would go to her room and sleep and just ask for their room number in the morning. you had to look away when the lady began talking. she confirmed your identity and then handed you a single room key. you thanked the nice woman and headed to the elevators. by then, namjoon texted back.</p><p>\u2018<i>we\u2019re awake. just watching a movie. we\u2019re split between two rooms. 717 and 719.</i>\u2019 he informed you.</p><p>you nodded, finding that you\u2019re room was below their\u2019s. instead of hitting the number six button on the elevator, you hit seven and made you way up. you were growing anxious by the minute, though more excited and anxious. you loved the boys. it was like having seven older siblings.\u00a0</p><p>eventually, you reached 717 and 719, which was the room across from 717. you didn\u2019t know which one to choose.

gone.\u201d</p><p>you looked at him an idea in your head.\u00a0\u201cwell, might as well stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>you were woken up by rather urgent knocking on your door. you groaned as you slowly woke up. you slowly pried your eyes open, seeing jungkook\u2019s face right in front of yours. his face held a glare, his eyes still closed. he was awake you could tell, but he didn\u2019t want to be. your attention was pulled away from jungkook when the knocking sounding once again. at this point, might as well wake up the entirety of the sixth floor.</p><p>you were forced to leave jungkook\u2019s embrace, slipping out of the covers. you had changed into some pajamas the night before\u2026in the bathroom of course. you glanced at jungkook, catching him tugging at the bed sheets. you smiled before walking towards the door. you opened it, squinting at the bright lights from the hallway.\u00a0</p><p>it was taehyung.\u00a0</p><p>you gulped and pulled the door closer to you, hiding jungkook from taehyung\u2019s view. as if that would do you any good.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cis jungkook with you?\u201d he asked.<br></p><p>\u201cwhy?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201che wasn\u2019t in the hotel room when we woke up this morning. and i recall hearing some whispering as i was getting into bed last night.\u201d<br></p><p>you blushed, suddenly remembering the previous night.\u00a0\u201cwell, you see, taehyung, my lovely older brother, jungkook did in fact walk me to my room last night.\u201d you pursed your lips.</p><p>taehyung narrowed his eyes.\u00a0\u201che\u2019s here, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>taehyung then pushed open the door and stepped inside. he saw jungkook sitting up in bed still half-asleep. your older brother whipped around, his facial expression telling you to spill the details. you felt your shoulders drop.\u00a0\u201cnothing happened, tae. he walked me to my room and he didn\u2019t have his room key to your room so he stayed with me.\u201d you met taehyung\u2019s eyes, he knew there was more to the story.\u00a0\u201cokay, and we may had kissed once or twice. but nothing more than that, i swear!\u201d</p><p>taehyung crossed his arms over his chest. his facial expression was intimidating, but it did nothing considering that he was still in his tata pajamas. jungkook met taehyung\u2019s eyes, standing up from the bed.\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s telling the truth, hyung. i simple walked her here, we kissed, i asked her to be my girlfriend, and because i couldn\u2019t get back into the room and i didn\u2019t want to wake anyone else up, and it was really late, y/n suggested that i stay in her room.\u201d</p><p>taehyung sighed.\u00a0\u201ci guess i can\u2019t do anything about your feelings.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>you and jungkook, standing next to each other, stared anxiously at taehyung. taehyung met your eyes. you could easily tell his was trying not to grin.\u00a0\u201cyou and jungkook really look good together.\u201d he admitted.</p><p>you grinned, jungkook blushed.\u00a0\u201calright, i will allow jeon jungkook to date my little sister, kim y/n. however, if you so much think about hurting her in any way, shape, or form, i won\u2019t hesitate to hurt you. i trust you won\u2019t, and it would be awkward since we are in a band together, but other than that, i\u2019m fine with it.\u201d</p><p>you ran over to your older brother and jumped into his arms.\u00a0\u201cthank you, taehyung, thank you. thank you!\u201d</p><p>he smiled into your shoulder as he hugged your back.\u00a0\u201canything to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>jungkook grinned.\u00a0\u201cthank you, hyung.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>you were pretty excited to start a new chapter in your life, especially one with jungkook now that he was your boyfriend. you couldn\u2019t help but think about how everything happened in japan, in a simple hotel. everything that marked the beginning of your and

off of the airplane after a little more than two hour flight from seoul. you were exhausted, more so after the flight and it didn\u2019t help that it was very late. as you stepped into the airport, you noticed it was slightly deserted, probably due to the fact of how late it was. it was nice. the airport wasn\u2019t bustling with people and you could get through with ease.</p><p>you walked for a bit, your bag from your shoulder. it was beginning to ache from all the things you packed. you headed towards the exit where all the taxis would be. as you walked, you pulled out your phone. you turned off airplane mode and waited for everything to sync. you grinned when you noticed a text from your older brother, taehyung.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018<i>good night, sis!!! tae-oppa loves you!</i>\u2019</p><p>you could imagine his goofy grin when he sent that. you weren\u2019t that much younger than taehyung, but his title of being your older brother made him treat you like a child sometimes. you didn\u2019t mind.\u00a0</p><p>you knew that taehyung and the rest of bts were on tour. you knew they were in tokyo, japan for their next concert. you hadn\u2019t seen your brother in a while and you missed him. this brought you to the idea to visit him and the others while they were on tour. although, it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise. you had to call namjoon and tell him your plan so that you could book a room in the hotel they were staying at. you had to know where they were.\u00a0</p><p>on top of it, you didn\u2019t know too much japanese. but, that didn\u2019t stop you from getting into the taxi and telling the driver the address to the hotel. it was a short drive, luckily for you. you almost passed out in the backseat of a taxi.\u00a0</p><p>after the taxi driver pulled up to the entrance of the hotel while announcing the price you had to pay, you sighed with an excited smile. you handed him the money before grabbing all your things and stepping out of the car. the air was different compared to seoul. it felt nice to be traveling, especially when it was to another country. it was something you wanted to do but never had a chance or reason to. plus, it scared you to be traveling alone, especially in a foreign place. but nonetheless, you finally did it.</p><p>you walked into the lobby, greeting the lady at the front desk. you told her you were checking in. while she clicked and typed around, you opened your phone and sent a quick text to namjoon, asking if he and the others were still awake. if he didn\u2019t reply, she would go to her room and sleep and just ask for their room number in the morning. you had to look away when the lady began talking. she confirmed your identity and then handed you a single room key. you thanked the nice woman and headed to the elevators. by then, namjoon texted back.</p><p>\u2018<i>we\u2019re awake. just watching a movie. we\u2019re split between two rooms. 717 and 719.</i>\u2019 he informed you.</p><p>you nodded, finding that you\u2019re room was below their\u2019s. instead of hitting the number six button on the elevator, you hit seven and made you way up. you were growing anxious by the minute, though more excited and anxious. you loved the boys. it was like having seven older siblings.\u00a0</p><p>eventually, you reached 717 and 719, which was the room across from 717. you didn\u2019t know which one to choose. with a shrug you knocked on 717. you waited a few seconds, hearing a bit of shuffling on the other side. then the door swung open, revealing namjoon. you smiled.\u00a0\u201cnamjoon!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>he smiled and opened the door wider to let you in. you noticed three of other people: seokjin, yoongi, and hoseok. they divided by hyung and maknae line. you greeted everybody and talked with all of them for a bit. though yoongi was half asleep, they all expressed their joy of seeing you again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cwell, i am going to see tae now. catch you guys later!\u201d<br></p><p>they nodded and you turned and left. you walked across the hall to 719 and knocked. you waited until the door swung open, revealing jungkook. your eyes widened slightly.\u00a0\u201cj-jungkook.\u201d you prayed your weren\u2019t blushing too much.</p><p>you see, you had a slight crush on jungkook. you have had feelings for him for as long as you can remember, probably meaning since taehyung first introduced you to jungkook. you gulped.</p><p>jungkook grinned,\u00a0\u201cy/n? y/n\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>little did you know, jungkook\u2019s heart was beating rapidly. he was tired from the day\u2019s schedule, but as soon as he saw you, he felt a rush of adrenaline. you heard heavy footsteps, like a stampede, coming your way and you noticed jimin and taehyung peer around the corner.\u00a0\u201cy/n!\u201d taehyung yelled excited.</p><p>jungkook opened the door and you walked passed him. taehyung ran towards you and wrapped his arms around you. you laughed at his bear hug.\u00a0\u201ci missed you too, tae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat brought you here?\u201d jimin asked.<br></p><p>taehyung set you down, bringing a hand up to push back the bangs that covered his eyes after he hugged you. you blushed, slightly embarrassed at your reasoning.\u00a0\u201ci missed you guys. i wanted to surprise you.\u201d</p><p>taehyung look at you.\u00a0\u201cyou came here alone?\u201d</p><p>jungkook\u2019s eyes met you suddenly. you blushed when you caught a hint of worry in them. you shrugged off the odd feeling in your stomach and looked up at your older brother.\u00a0\u201ci did. i went to the airport by myself, i went through security by myself, i flew on a plane by myself, i entered a foreign country by myself, i managed to get here by myself. i did have namjoon\u2019s help though. he told me where to go.\u201d</p><p>taehyung was surprised.\u00a0\u201cwow.\u201d</p><p>jungkook nodded.\u00a0\u201chow long are you staying?\u201d</p><p>you shrugged.\u00a0\u201cwell you guys are leaving in two days so i\u2019ll go back then too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cso you have a room then?\u201d taehyung asked.\u00a0\u201cif you don\u2019t, we can share a bed. just like old times.\u201d<br></p><p>taehyung\u2019s smile was something you could never forget. you smiled and peered around your older brother to see two queen sized beds. looking around, you noticed how the room was slightly on the untidy side. the bed sheets were bundled up on the beds, there were cups on the tables and tv stand, a few pieces of clothing were on the floor. you shook your head.\u00a0\u201cno, i have a room. 602.\u201d you told him.</p><p>taehyung nodded,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>jimin nodded.\u00a0\u201cwell, i\u2019m going to shower and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>you looked at jimin and then pulled out your phone, glancing at the time.\u00a0\u201coh! it\u2019s 12:46.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwell, you should go back to your room, y/n.\u201d<br></p><p>you nodded and looked up at taehyung to flash a smile, a smile that closely resembles taehyung\u2019s.\u00a0\u201cgood night, big brother.\u201d you said.</p><p>he nodded,\u00a0\u201cgood night.\u201d</p><p>you walked towards their door. before you could touch the handle, jungkook appeared next to you.\u00a0\u201ccan i walk you to your room? please?\u201d</p><p>you felt a little nervous hearing him say this. you glanced at taehyung but he was already getting into the bed, not noticing that jungkook wasn\u2019t doing the same. you nodded. perhaps this was your chance to spark something between the two of you. you didn\u2019t think jungkook had feelings for you though. everyone in bts were you older brothers.\u00a0</p><p>you and jungkook left the room together, you quietly closing the door behind you. the first few minutes were a bit awkward and quiet. you wanted to break the silence but you didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0</p><p>you and jungkook entered the elevator. you pressed the number six.\u00a0\u201cso,\u201d you began.</p><p>jungkook sighed.\u00a0\u201cso.\u201d</p><p>you smiled, a light blush in your cheeks. jungkook\u2019s laugh made you turn your head. you looked up at him. you felt like you were looking at up a clear night sky full of bright, shining stars. jungkook was beautiful as he smiled and chuckled to himself. the awkward aura around you and him must of got to him. you just felt like you were looking at the world when you looked at jungkook.</p><p>the bell that signaled the doors were opening brought you out of your chance. before jungkook could notice, you looked away and stepped out. you made sure jungkook followed you. then you and him began to walk once more. you noticed that your and his walking pace was slow, as if you were trying to stall. you didn\u2019t want these short minutes with jungkook to end. you could your heart beat and your cheeks blush as you thought about him. why did he want to walk you to your room?</p><p>it didn\u2019t take long for you to arrive at 602. you looked down into your bag and fished around for you single room key. as your hand was in your bag, jungkook called your name. it was quiet. you looked up and not even half a second later, jungkook was cupping your cheeks and pressing his plump lips onto your own. your eyes widen. you just froze, your hand still in your bag.\u00a0</p><p>but the feelings jungkook was addicting. you closed your eyes and kissed him back. the kiss was like the spark that ignited the fire in your heart. you were completely in love with jungkook. and judging by how he initiated this kiss, jungkook was in love with you too. you didn\u2019t want to pull away, but you also didn\u2019t want to make out with jungkook in the middle of a hallway. you pulled away, feeling the high temperature in your cheeks. you bit your bottom lip and you met jungkook\u2019s eyes. he smiled at you.\u00a0\u201ci couldn\u2019t hold back anymore.\u201d</p><p>you smiled.\u00a0\u201cdid you wait until taehyung couldn\u2019t catch us? is that why you wanted to come with me?\u201d</p><p>jungkook\u2019s cheeks were slowly turning pink. he looked so cute in this moment.\u00a0\u201cyes.\u201d he replied.</p><p>you grinned excitedly before finally finding your room key. you hurriedly unlocked your room and grabbed jungkook\u2019s hand, tugging him inside.\u00a0\u201cwait, y/n, what are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>you closed the door, the door locking automatically. you tossed your bag onto the single queen sized bed before facing jungkook.\u00a0\u201cjungkook, i\u2019m in love with you.\u201d you frankly said.</p><p>jungkook smiled.\u00a0\u201ci think i know that from that kiss we just shared.\u201d</p><p>you blushed before approaching him again and planting your lips onto his. you had been waiting for this moment for ages, you felt like you just couldn\u2019t get enough of jungkook. jungkook immediately kissed you back, his arms snaking around your waist and pulling you close.</p><p>jungkook pushed you down on the bed. you laid on your side, jungkook doing the same. his arms were still wrapped around you. he pulled away, silly grin of his lips as his nose brushed against yours.\u00a0\u201cwill you be my girlfriend, y/n?\u201d</p><p>you blushed,\u00a0\u201cof course.\u201d</p><p>now that you were laying on the bed, you realized just how tired you were.\u00a0\u201chey, jungkook. you don\u2019t have a room key with you, right?\u201d</p><p>jungkook shook his head, his eyes flashing a glint of realization.\u00a0\u201ci won\u2019t be able to get back into the room\u2026unless i want to wake taehyung and jimin up. they were question while i was gone.\u201d</p><p>you looked at him an idea in your head.\u00a0\u201cwell, might as well stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>you were woken up by rather urgent knocking on your door. you groaned as you slowly woke up. you slowly pried your eyes open, seeing jungkook\u2019s face right in front of yours. his face held a glare, his eyes still closed. he was awake you could tell, but he didn\u2019t want to be. your attention was pulled away from jungkook when the knocking sounding once again. at this point, might as well wake up the entirety of the sixth floor.</p><p>you were forced to leave jungkook\u2019s embrace, slipping out of the covers. you had changed into some pajamas the night before\u2026in the bathroom of course. you glanced at jungkook, catching him tugging at the bed sheets. you smiled before walking towards the door. you opened it, squinting at the bright lights from the hallway.\u00a0</p><p>it was taehyung.\u00a0</p><p>you gulped and pulled the door closer to you, hiding jungkook from taehyung\u2019s view. as if that would do you any good.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cis jungkook with you?\u201d he asked.<br></p><p>\u201cwhy?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201che wasn\u2019t in the

he informed you.</p><p>you nodded, finding that you&rsquo;re room was below their&rsquo;s. instead of hitting the number six button on the elevator, you hit seven and made you way up. you were growing anxious by the minute, though more excited and anxious. you loved the boys. it was like having seven older siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>eventually, you reached 717 and 719, which was the room across from 717. you didn&rsquo;t know which one to choose. with a shrug you knocked on 717. you waited a few seconds, hearing a bit of shuffling on the other side. then the door swung open, revealing namjoon. you smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;namjoon!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>he smiled and opened the door wider to let you in. you noticed three of other people: seokjin, yoongi, and hoseok. they divided by hyung and maknae line. you greeted everybody and talked with all of them for a bit. though yoongi was half asleep, they all expressed their joy of seeing you again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;well, i am going to see tae now. catch you guys later!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>they nodded and you turned and left. you walked across the hall to 719 and knocked. you waited until the door swung open, revealing jungkook. your eyes widened slightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;j-jungkook.&rdquo; you prayed your weren&rsquo;t blushing too much.</p><p>you see, you had a slight crush on jungkook. you have had feelings for him for as long as you can remember, probably meaning since taehyung first introduced you to jungkook. you gulped.</p><p>jungkook grinned,&nbsp;&ldquo;y/n? y/n&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p><p>little did you know, jungkook&rsquo;s heart was beating rapidly. he was tired from the day&rsquo;s schedule, but as soon as he saw you, he felt a rush of adrenaline. you heard heavy footsteps, like a stampede, coming your way and you noticed jimin and taehyung peer around the corner.&nbsp;&ldquo;y/n!&rdquo; taehyung yelled excited.</p><p>jungkook opened the door and you walked passed him. taehyung ran towards you and wrapped his arms around you. you laughed at his bear hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;i missed you too, tae.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;what brought you here?&rdquo; jimin asked.<br /></p><p>taehyung set you down, bringing a hand up to push back the bangs that covered his eyes after he hugged you. you blushed, slightly embarrassed at your reasoning.&nbsp;&ldquo;i missed you guys. i wanted to surprise you.&rdquo;</p><p>taehyung look at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;you came here alone?&rdquo;</p><p>jungkook&rsquo;s eyes met you suddenly. you blushed when you caught a hint of worry in them. you shrugged off the odd feeling in your stomach and looked up at your older brother.&nbsp;&ldquo;i did. i went to the airport by myself, i went through security by myself, i flew on a plane by myself, i entered a foreign country by myself, i managed to get here by myself. i did have namjoon&rsquo;s help though. he told me where to go.&rdquo;</p><p>taehyung was surprised.&nbsp;&ldquo;wow.&rdquo;</p><p>jungkook nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;how long are you staying?&rdquo;</p><p>you shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;well you guys are leaving in two days so i&rsquo;ll go back then too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;so you have a room then?&rdquo; taehyung asked.&nbsp;&ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t, we can share a bed. just like old times.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>taehyung&rsquo;s smile was something you could never forget. you smiled and peered around your older brother to see two queen sized beds. looking around, you noticed how the room was slightly on the untidy side. the bed sheets were bundled up on the beds, there were cups on the tables and tv stand, a few pieces of clothing were on the floor. you shook your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;no, i have a room. 602.&rdquo; you told him.</p><p>taehyung nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p><p>jimin nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;well, i&rsquo;m going to shower and go to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>you looked at jimin and then pulled out your phone, glancing at the time.&nbsp;&ldquo;oh! it&rsquo;s 12:46.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;well, you should go back to your room, y/n.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>you nodded and looked up at taehyung to flash a smile, a smile that closely resembles taehyung&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&ldquo;good night, big brother.&rdquo; you said.</p><p>he nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;good night.&rdquo;</p><p>you walked towards their door. before you could touch the handle, jungkook appeared next to you.&nbsp;&ldquo;can i walk you to your room? please?&rdquo;</p><p>you felt a little nervous hearing him say this. you glanced at taehyung but he was already getting into the bed, not noticing that jungkook wasn&rsquo;t doing the same. you nodded. perhaps this was your chance to spark something between the two of you. you didn&rsquo;t think jungkook had feelings for you though. everyone in bts were you older brothers.&nbsp;</p><p>you and jungkook left the room together, you quietly closing the door behind you. the first few minutes were a bit awkward and quiet. you wanted to break the silence but you didn&rsquo;t know what to say.&nbsp;</p><p>you and jungkook entered the elevator. you pressed the number six.&nbsp;&ldquo;so,&rdquo; you began.</p><p>jungkook sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;so.&rdquo;</p><p>you smiled, a light blush in your cheeks. jungkook&rsquo;s laugh made you turn your head. you looked up at him. you felt like you were looking at up a clear night sky full of bright, shining stars. jungkook was beautiful as he smiled and chuckled to himself. the awkward aura around you and him must of got to him. you just felt like you were looking at the world when you looked at jungkook.</p><p>the bell that signaled the doors were opening brought you out of your chance. before jungkook could notice, you looked away and stepped out. you made sure jungkook followed you. then you and him began to walk once more. you noticed that your and his walking pace was slow, as if you were trying to stall. you didn&rsquo;t want these short minutes with jungkook to end. you could your heart beat and your cheeks blush as you thought about him. why did he want to walk you to your room?</p><p>it didn&rsquo;t take long for you to arrive at 602. you looked down into your bag and fished around for you single room key. as your hand was in your bag, jungkook called your name. it was quiet. you looked up and not even half a second later, jungkook was cupping your cheeks and pressing his plump lips onto your own. your eyes widen. you just froze, your hand still in your bag.&nbsp;</p><p>but the feelings jungkook was addicting. you closed your eyes and kissed him back. the kiss was like the spark that ignited the fire in your heart. you were completely in love with jungkook. and judging by how he initiated this kiss, jungkook was in love with you too. you didn&rsquo;t want to pull away, but you also didn&rsquo;t want to make out with jungkook in the middle of a hallway. you pulled away, feeling the high temperature in your cheeks. you bit your bottom lip and you met jungkook&rsquo;s eyes. he smiled at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;i couldn&rsquo;t hold back anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>you smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;did you wait until taehyung couldn&rsquo;t catch us? is that why you wanted to come with me?&rdquo;</p><p>jungkook&rsquo;s cheeks were slowly turning pink. he looked so cute in this moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;yes.&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>you grinned excitedly before finally finding your room key. you hurriedly unlocked your room and grabbed jungkook&rsquo;s hand, tugging him inside.&nbsp;&ldquo;wait, y/n, what are you doing?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>you closed the door, the door locking automatically. you tossed your bag onto the single queen sized bed before facing jungkook.&nbsp;&ldquo;jungkook, i&rsquo;m in love with you.&rdquo; you frankly said.</p><p>jungkook smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;i think i know that from that kiss we just shared.&rdquo;</p><p>you blushed before approaching him again and planting your lips onto his. you had been waiting for this moment for ages, you felt like you just couldn&rsquo;t get enough of jungkook. jungkook immediately kissed you back, his arms snaking around your waist and pulling you close.</p><p>jungkook pushed you down on the bed. you laid on your side, jungkook doing the same. his arms were still wrapped around you. he pulled away, silly grin of his lips as his nose brushed against yours.&nbsp;&ldquo;will you be my girlfriend, y/n?&rdquo;</p><p>you blushed,&nbsp;&ldquo;of course.&rdquo;</p><p>now that you were laying on the bed, you realized just how tired you were.&nbsp;&ldquo;hey, jungkook. you don&rsquo;t have a room key with you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>jungkook shook his head, his eyes flashing a glint of realization.&nbsp;&ldquo;i won&rsquo;t be able to get back into the room&hellip;unless i want to wake taehyung and jimin up. they were question while i was gone.&rdquo;</p><p>you looked at him an idea in your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;well, might as well stay here.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>you were woken up by rather urgent knocking on your door. you groaned as you slowly woke up. you slowly pried your eyes open, seeing jungkook&rsquo;s face right in front of yours. his face held a glare, his eyes still closed. he was awake you could tell, but he didn&rsquo;t want to be. your attention was pulled away from jungkook when the knocking sounding once again. at this point, might as well wake up the entirety of the sixth floor.</p><p>you were forced to leave jungkook&rsquo;s embrace, slipping out of the covers. you had changed into some pajamas the night before&hellip;in the bathroom of course. you glanced at jungkook, catching him tugging at the bed sheets. you smiled before walking towards the door. you opened it, squinting at the bright lights from the hallway.&nbsp;</p><p>it was taehyung.&nbsp;</p><p>you gulped and pulled the door closer to you, hiding jungkook from taehyung&rsquo;s view. as if that would do you any good.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;is jungkook with you?&rdquo; he asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;why?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;he wasn&rsquo;t in the hotel room when we woke up this morning. and i recall hearing some whispering as i was getting into bed last night.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>you blushed, suddenly remembering the previous night.&nbsp;&ldquo;well, you see, taehyung, my lovely older brother, jungkook did in fact walk me to my room last night.&rdquo; you pursed your lips.</p><p>taehyung narrowed his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s here, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>taehyung then pushed open the door and stepped inside. he saw jungkook sitting up in bed still half-asleep. your older brother whipped around, his facial expression telling you to spill the details. you felt your shoulders drop.&nbsp;&ldquo;nothing happened, tae. he walked me to my room and he didn&rsquo;t have his room key to your room so he stayed with me.&rdquo; you met taehyung&rsquo;s eyes, he knew there was more to the story.&nbsp;&ldquo;okay, and we may had kissed once or twice. but nothing more than that, i swear!&rdquo;</p><p>taehyung crossed his arms over his chest. his facial expression was intimidating, but it did nothing considering that he was still in his tata pajamas. jungkook met taehyung&rsquo;s eyes, standing up from the bed.&nbsp;&ldquo;she&rsquo;s telling the truth, hyung. i simple walked her here, we kissed, i asked her to be my girlfriend, and because i couldn&rsquo;t get back into the room and i didn&rsquo;t want to wake anyone else up, and it was really late, y/n suggested that i stay in her room.&rdquo;</p><p>taehyung sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;i guess i can&rsquo;t do anything about your feelings.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>you and jungkook, standing next to each other, stared anxiously at taehyung. taehyung met your eyes. you could easily tell his was trying not to grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;you and jungkook really look good together.&rdquo; he admitted.</p><p>you grinned, jungkook blushed.&nbsp;&ldquo;alright, i will allow jeon jungkook to date my little sister, kim y/n. however, if you so much think about hurting her in any way, shape, or form, i won&rsquo;t hesitate to hurt you. i trust you won&rsquo;t, and it would be awkward since we are in a band together, but other than that, i&rsquo;m fine with it.&rdquo;</p><p>you ran over to your older brother and jumped into his arms.&nbsp;&ldquo;thank you, taehyung, thank you. thank you!&rdquo;</p><p>he smiled into your shoulder as he hugged your back.&nbsp;&ldquo;anything to make you happy.&rdquo;</p><p>jungkook grinned.&nbsp;&ldquo;thank you, hyung.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>you were pretty excited to start a new chapter in your life, especially one with jungkook now that he was your boyfriend. you couldn&rsquo;t help but think about how everything happened in japan, in a simple hotel. everything that marked the beginning of your and jungkook&rsquo;s relationship, all in room 602.</p></p>",
