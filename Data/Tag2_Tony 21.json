So he&rsquo;s not quitedone with surprises yet.</p><h2><b>Part Two: Simple</b></h2><p>Bigger did not always mean better when it came to Pepper Potts. That was a lesson that Tony had struggled with over the years. She ran Stark Industries and was engaged to him. That was more chaos than most people would be willing to put up with, so when she told him that she wanted a simple, quiet wedding Tony had done his best not to let his ever-active imagination run away with him. He liked flashy. He liked showy, but he&rsquo;d made a conscious effort to remember that it really wasn&rsquo;t about what he wanted or how he was used to doing things. This was about the woman he loved saying yes and being willing to put up with his shenanigans for the rest of their lives together. She hadn&rsquo;t asked for much, but she&rsquo;d been clear: close friends, no media, and simple. Had she stressed simple? If she hadn&rsquo;t, <i>simple</i>.</p><p>Then Thanos&rsquo; goons had shown up in the middle of New York - again - and Tony had hopped a ride to another galaxy to fight the demon that had haunted him for so long. He&rsquo;d fought and he&rsquo;d lost, and nothing seemed simple anymore. Everywhere he looked he saw the scars left behind, the lives snapped out of existence. Friends that would have made it onto their shortlist for the wedding were gone forever, all because they couldn&rsquo;t beat the Titan back. He&rsquo;d tried. He&rsquo;d nearly died for it, but he hadn&rsquo;t been strong enough. Not to beat Thanos and not to save the ones he had stolen away. He hadn&rsquo;t been strong enough to protect the kid.</p><p>The sound of the door opening behind him shook Tony out of his thoughts and he ran a hand through his hair. Not today. He couldn&rsquo;t let himself get caught up in that today. He pulled in a breath that he hoped would steady him and stood, turning to see what was left of their invite list entering the small space along with a few more recent additions. Danvers, Nebula, the raccoon that Tony still couldn&rsquo;t remember the name of, and Steve Rogers. The last had been a begrudging addition to the roster. He hadn&rsquo;t spoken to him since he&rsquo;d pushed the portable ARC reactor that stored his suit into Steve&rsquo;s hands and called him a liar.</p><p>&ldquo;You planning on yelling at him until you collapse again?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony turned to see Natasha Romanoff had broken away from the others. &ldquo;Thinking about it, just without the collapsing part.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>She looked him up and down. &ldquo;You look better, but not toe-to-toe with Cap kind of better.&rdquo;</p><p>He huffed and caught her smile. They both knew he was all talk on it. They&rsquo;d been down that road before and as good as it felt to take knock Captain America in his perfect teeth every now and again, it was his wedding day, and <i>technically</i> he&rsquo;d been invited. Pepper had said it would be cruel to leave him as the sole uninvited Avenger left, and it wasn&rsquo;t like either of them had thought Cap would show anyway. Apparently they&rsquo;d been wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;He does miss you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, because Wilson and Barnes got snapped away?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You two were friends once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Barely,&rdquo; Tony snapped and waved it off. &ldquo;Next topic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sooner or later you&rsquo;ll have to deal with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. Probably not. I&rsquo;m not coming back.&rdquo; He glanced back towards the group and wondered if Rogers had sent her in for this. No one else was joining them. &ldquo;C'mon, Nat. It&rsquo;s my wedding day. Pick pretty much anything else.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a flash of mischief in her eyes and he saw her lips quirk up at the corners. &ldquo;How about why you guys decided to jump on the wedding when last I heard you were barely leaving your bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me for taking some time to recover from near death.&rdquo; She quirked an eyebrow at him and he knew that wasn&rsquo;t what she was getting out. How she&rsquo;d gotten to the truth that he and Pepper hadn&rsquo;t let slip was beyond him though. He wasn&rsquo;t even sure she&rsquo;d seenPepper, not that she was showing yet. &ldquo;How -?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know all,&rdquo; she answered cheekily, finally pulling the smallest of smiles from him. &ldquo;Congratulations.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Keep it to yourself. If Happy or Rhodey either one don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re the first to know, I&rsquo;ll never hear the end of it. &lsquo;Specially Hap.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha flashed a grin. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it worth to you, Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Call it a wedding present,&rdquo; he huffed, coupled with what he hoped was a more intimidating look than it really felt. Maybe it would have been to anyone else. For Natasha Romanoff, it only seemed to amuse her more.</p><p>If she&rsquo;d planned on saying anymore more, though, she didn&rsquo;t get the chance. His friends - both former and current - had started to file in and find seats. The priest had taken his place at the front of the room and there was a shadow lingering just out of view of the doorway that Tony knew well.</p><p>&ldquo;You ready, buddy?&rdquo; Rhodey asked him, a hand on his shoulder and gently guiding him towards the front.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah\u2026 yeah. No. The ring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This ring?&rdquo; his best friend asked with a grin and held it up.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one.&rdquo; He sucked in a deep breath, shaking his hands out and trying to regain some control. He had been mostly fine just a moment before, but suddenly, as things started barreling forward, he felt overwhelmed. All of his thoughts and emotions folded in on each other and made it difficult to work through them, muchless think. &ldquo;Why am I so nervous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you know who&rsquo;s about to walk through that door,&rdquo; Rhodey answered, finally getting him positioned where he needed to go. &ldquo;And you know there ain&rsquo;t no way in the world you&rsquo;d ever deserve her.&rdquo; Tony shot him a look. He wasn&rsquo;t wrong, but he didn&rsquo;t have to say it. Rhodey grinned. &ldquo;But she loves you, and she said yes anyway. Gotta figure out how to do right by that now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; the younger man breathed softly as the shadow outside the door shortened and he saw Happy move to take Pepper&rsquo;s arm and escort her down the aisle. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did good, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper met his eyes and Tony Stark was at a loss for words. All he could do was stare, her smile contagious as he he felt his own turn into a goofy grin that grew with each step she took. She&rsquo;d said yes. Yes to marrying him. Yes to building a family with him. After Thanos he hadn&rsquo;t thought he would ever feel any sort of peace again, but it worked its way in and pushed the overwhelming grief aside at least for a moment. In that moment she was all he could see.</p><p>Pepper came to stand with him and the priest began speaking. Tony could hear the words, his brain processed them on a basic level, but his focus was locked on the beautiful woman in front of him. He saw her smile fade ever so slightly. &ldquo;Tony?&rdquo;</p><p>He blinked hard. Right. The priest had stopped and he was supposed to say something. He cleared his throat to try to find his voice to answer her. &ldquo;Wow. Just\u2026.. wow.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony loved that smile she gave him. Part teasing, part exasperated, but most amused. Usually she swatted him, but Pepper had always managed to keep herself composed for the situation at hand. Not that this crowd would blink an eye if she smacked him.</p><p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m supposed to have a whole thing prepared-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vows?&rdquo; she prompted and he heard Rhodey snort behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;And I swear I did,&rdquo; he promised and that smile returned. &ldquo;But right here, after everything they&rsquo;re just\u2026&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I love you, Pep. You&rsquo;ve put up with so much with me over the years, but\u2026 It&rsquo;s always been you and it&rsquo;s always gonna be you.&rdquo; He reached forward, his hand brushing hers and he pulled it up to press a kiss to her knuckles before slipping the ring into place. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t change your mind?&rdquo;</p><p>That pulled a laugh out of her. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She caught his hand as he dropped it and leaned forward, her forehead pressed against his. He closed his eyes. &ldquo;I love you, Tony Stark,&rdquo; she breathed, moving to slide his new ring onto his finger. &ldquo;For so long and through everything, I&rsquo;ve never stopped. I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s grin tugged back into place at the promise that had been a constant reminder since he&rsquo;d come home. No matter what happened, they would face it together. The nightmares, the fears. They couldn&rsquo;t change the past, but together they could fight in a whole new way for their future.</p><p>The priest barely got through his <i>you may now kiss the bride</i> before Tony ducked down, his arms around her waist and her hands sliding to the lapels on his jacket to pull him deeper into the kiss.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ________________________________</p><p>This had been the happiest she had seen him since he&rsquo;d come home to her. From the moment she had started down the aisle to the the ring exchange where any pre-written vows had been tossed to the side for words that meant even more. Promises. Commitment.</p><p>Any thought of a short after party was quickly brushed aside as Tony said that they had somewhere to be. Happy had taken a cue and all Pepper could do was quirk an eyebrow at her new husband who offered her one of his more mischievous smiles. &ldquo;One more surprise?&rdquo; he asked, motioning to the car as Happy pulled it around.</p><p>She swallowed the argument and climbed into the car. &ldquo;Will you tell me where we&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he answered, his voice strangely chipper as he scooted over so that he was sitting right next to her. She shook her head at the antics as he looped his arm through hers to pull her a little closer. She leaned in, pressing a kiss to his shoulder as they settled in for the ride.</p><p>Pepper watched the city fade to country and into a wooded area, Happy easily navigating the trip as if it wasn&rsquo;t his first time out to wherever it was they were heading. Finally they pulled to a stop at the bottom of a hill next to a lake and she shot Tony a questioning look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exactly dressed for this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine. Promise.&rdquo; He stepped out of the car and circled around. Pepper was already halfway out by the time he got there, but there was something sweet on the way he offered her a hand. Her finger brushed his wedding band and he didn&rsquo;t let go once she was out of the car.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you up to?&rdquo; she asked, her suspicion building on itself. A few years ago she might have thought he&rsquo;d taken her all the way out there for a late afternoon jump in the lake, but those had been different times and there would have been easier ways to do it if that had been the goal.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he urged, holding her hand to steady her on the dirt path that led to a cabin at the end of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, that&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; she warned softly.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t answer and she followed as well as she could in her heels, pulling the wedding dress up so she wouldn&rsquo;t snag it. There was a porch that wrapped around, newly remodeled, and Pepper&rsquo;s protests died as Tony led her up the steps. &ldquo;You told me your family had a lake house when you were a kid, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; she answered slowly, watching him tap a code into the lockbox on the door. &ldquo;Tony, what did you do\u2026.?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You told me it was the best memories you had with your family as a kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You listened?&rdquo; she teased.</p><p>&ldquo;I listen!&rdquo; he shot back, feigning hurt as he pushed the door open for her to walk in. &ldquo;Found this place. It needed some work. Still does, but in another month or so it should be ready.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper stepped inside, her gaze sweeping the beautiful woodwork. The stairs and the living room. The kitchen and the dining area. &ldquo;Did you buy it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We bought it,&rdquo; he countered.</p><p>&ldquo;You really want to move out of the city? And in this direction?&rdquo; They were nowhere near the Avengers compound. He&rsquo;d said he didn&rsquo;t want to go back, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time he&rsquo;d made a decision out of pain or fear and circled back around to the suit. She loved him, and she wouldn&rsquo;t make it an ultimatum, but she&rsquo;d nearly lost him too many times. If he kept pushing it, there&rsquo;d be a day that his luck ran out and she didn&rsquo;t want to lose him. He&rsquo;d given so much for the Avengers already.</p><p>He turned, blinking owlishly at her. &ldquo;You said you wanted to downgrade.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Simplify.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but you\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And in the chaos of your childhood, the lake house was a bright point. I thought we could, I don&rsquo;t know, start from there. Make it a launching pad for a really good home for our little guy. Or gal.&rdquo; He stopped and it took a moment for Pepper to turn and find that his gaze was locked on her. &ldquo;Maybe?&rdquo; he asked, his voice much more hesitant than it had been.</p><p>Pepper&rsquo;s lips tilted slowly and she moved towards him, ignoring the confused look he gave her as she reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out his phone. It took half a moment for her to find the music she wanted and she set the phone on a nearby counter as she held out a hand to him. &ldquo;We never got our first dance, Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think we can fix that, Mrs Stark,&rdquo; Tony answered with a grin. He took her hand and pulled her close, fingers ghosting down the backless dress as she leaned into him, swaying to the music.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For what? The house? It&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For coming home to me.&rdquo;</p><p>He stopped, whatever he was going to say lost to the moment, and she felt his hold tighten ever so slightly around her as they danced.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0__________________________________</p><p><b>Notes</b>: Have I mentioned that I love these two?

They both knew he was all talk on it. They\u2019d been down that road before and as good as it felt to take knock Captain America in his perfect teeth every now and again, it was his wedding day, and <i>technically</i> he\u2019d been invited. Pepper had said it would be cruel to leave him as the sole uninvited Avenger left, and it wasn\u2019t like either of them had thought Cap would show anyway. Apparently they\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cHe does miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, because Wilson and Barnes got snapped away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two were friends once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely,\u201d Tony snapped and waved it off. \u201cNext topic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooner or later you\u2019ll have to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Probably not. I\u2019m not coming back.\u201d He glanced back towards the group and wondered if Rogers had sent her in for this. No one else was joining them. \u201cC'mon, Nat. It\u2019s my wedding day. Pick pretty much anything else.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash of mischief in her eyes and he saw her lips quirk up at the corners. \u201cHow about why you guys decided to jump on the wedding when last I heard you were barely leaving your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for taking some time to recover from near death.\u201d She quirked an eyebrow at him and he knew that wasn\u2019t what she was getting out. How she\u2019d gotten to the truth that he and Pepper hadn\u2019t let slip was beyond him though. He wasn\u2019t even sure she\u2019d seenPepper, not that she was showing yet. \u201cHow -?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all,\u201d she answered cheekily, finally pulling the smallest of smiles from him. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it to yourself. If Happy or Rhodey either one don\u2019t think they\u2019re the first to know, I\u2019ll never hear the end of it. \u2018Specially Hap.\u201d</p><p>Natasha flashed a grin. \u201cWhat\u2019s it worth to you, Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it a wedding present,\u201d he huffed, coupled with what he hoped was a more intimidating look than it really felt. Maybe it would have been to anyone else. For Natasha Romanoff, it only seemed to amuse her more.</p><p>If she\u2019d planned on saying anymore more, though, she didn\u2019t get the chance. His friends - both former and current - had started to file in and find seats. The priest had taken his place at the front of the room and there was a shadow lingering just out of view of the doorway that Tony knew well.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, buddy?\u201d Rhodey asked him, a hand on his shoulder and gently guiding him towards the front.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 yeah. No. The ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ring?\u201d his best friend asked with a grin and held it up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d He sucked in a deep breath, shaking his hands out and trying to regain some control. He had been mostly fine just a moment before, but suddenly, as things started barreling forward, he felt overwhelmed. All of his thoughts and emotions folded in on each other and made it difficult to work through them, muchless think. \u201cWhy am I so nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you know who\u2019s about to walk through that door,\u201d Rhodey answered, finally getting him positioned where he needed to go. \u201cAnd you know there ain\u2019t no way in the world you\u2019d ever deserve her.\u201d Tony shot him a look. He wasn\u2019t wrong, but he didn\u2019t have to say it. Rhodey grinned. \u201cBut she loves you, and she said yes anyway. Gotta figure out how to do right by that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the younger man breathed softly as the shadow outside the door shortened and he saw Happy move to take Pepper\u2019s arm and escort her down the aisle. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did good, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Pepper met his eyes and Tony Stark was at a loss for words. All he could do was stare, her smile contagious as he he felt his own turn into a goofy grin that grew with each step she took. She\u2019d said yes. Yes to marrying him. Yes to building a family with him. After Thanos he hadn\u2019t thought he would ever feel any sort of peace again, but it worked its way in and pushed the overwhelming grief aside at least for a moment. In that moment she was all he could see.</p><p>Pepper came to stand with him and the priest began speaking. Tony could hear the words, his brain processed them on a basic level, but his focus was locked on the beautiful woman in front of him. He saw her smile fade ever so slightly. \u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>He blinked hard. Right. The priest had stopped and he was supposed to say something. He cleared his throat to try to find his voice to answer her. \u201cWow. Just\u2026.. wow.\u201d</p><p>Tony loved that smile she gave him. Part teasing, part exasperated, but most amused. Usually she swatted him, but Pepper had always managed to keep herself composed for the situation at hand. Not that this crowd would blink an eye if she smacked him.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m supposed to have a whole thing prepared-\u201d</p><p>\u201cVows?\u201d she prompted and he heard Rhodey snort behind him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I swear I did,\u201d he promised and that smile returned. \u201cBut right here, after everything they\u2019re just\u2026\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI love you, Pep. You\u2019ve put up with so much with me over the years, but\u2026 It\u2019s always been you and it\u2019s always gonna be you.\u201d He reached forward, his hand brushing hers and he pulled it up to press a kiss to her knuckles before slipping the ring into place. \u201cPlease don\u2019t change your mind?\u201d</p><p>That pulled a laugh out of her. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She caught his hand as he dropped it and leaned forward, her forehead pressed against his. He closed his eyes. \u201cI love you, Tony Stark,\u201d she breathed, moving to slide his new ring onto his finger. \u201cFor so long and through everything, I\u2019ve never stopped. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s grin tugged back into place at the promise that had been a constant reminder since he\u2019d come home. No matter what happened, they would face it together. The nightmares, the fears. They couldn\u2019t change the past, but together they could fight in a whole new way for their future.</p><p>The priest barely got through his <i>you may now kiss the bride</i> before Tony ducked down, his arms around her waist and her hands sliding to the lapels on his jacket to pull him deeper into the kiss.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ________________________________</p><p>This had been the happiest she had seen him since he\u2019d come home to her. From the moment she had started down the aisle to the the ring exchange where any pre-written vows had been tossed to the side for words that meant even more. Promises. Commitment.</p><p>Any thought of a short after party was quickly brushed aside as Tony said that they had somewhere to be. Happy had taken a cue and all Pepper could do was quirk an eyebrow at her new husband who offered her one of his more mischievous smiles. \u201cOne more surprise?\u201d he asked, motioning to the car as Happy pulled it around.</p><p>She swallowed the argument and climbed into the car. \u201cWill you tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he answered, his voice strangely chipper as he scooted over so that he was sitting right next to her. She shook her head at the antics as he looped his arm through hers to pull her a little closer. She leaned in, pressing a kiss to his shoulder as they settled in for the ride.</p><p>Pepper watched the city fade to country and into a wooded area, Happy easily navigating the trip as if it wasn\u2019t his first time out to wherever it was they were heading. Finally they pulled to a stop at the bottom of a hill next to a lake and she shot Tony a questioning look. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly dressed for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Promise.\u201d He stepped out of the car and circled around. Pepper was already halfway out by the time he got there, but there was something sweet on the way he offered her a hand. Her finger brushed his wedding band and he didn\u2019t let go once she was out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d she asked, her suspicion building on itself. A few years ago she might have thought he\u2019d taken her all the way out there for a late afternoon jump in the lake, but those had been different times and there would have been easier ways to do it if that had been the goal.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he urged, holding her hand to steady her on the dirt path that led to a cabin at the end of it.</p><p>\u201cTony, that\u2019s someone\u2019s house,\u201d she warned softly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer and she followed as well as she could in her heels, pulling the wedding dress up so she wouldn\u2019t snag it. There was a porch that wrapped around, newly remodeled, and Pepper\u2019s protests died as Tony led her up the steps. \u201cYou told me your family had a lake house when you were a kid, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d she answered slowly, watching him tap a code into the lockbox on the door. \u201cTony, what did you do\u2026.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me it was the best memories you had with your family as a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou listened?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI listen!\u201d he shot back, feigning hurt as he pushed the door open for her to walk in. \u201cFound this place. It needed some work. Still does, but in another month or so it should be ready.\u201d</p><p>Pepper stepped inside, her gaze sweeping the beautiful woodwork. The stairs and the living room. The kitchen and the dining area. \u201cDid you buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe bought it,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to move out of the city? And in this direction?\u201d They were nowhere near the Avengers compound. He\u2019d said he didn\u2019t want to go back, but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d made a decision out of pain or fear and circled back around to the suit. She loved him, and she wouldn\u2019t make it an ultimatum, but she\u2019d nearly lost him too many times. If he kept pushing it, there\u2019d be a day that his luck ran out and she didn\u2019t want to lose him. He\u2019d given so much for the Avengers already.</p><p>He turned, blinking owlishly at her. \u201cYou said you wanted to downgrade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimplify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in the chaos of your childhood, the lake house was a bright point. I thought we could, I don\u2019t know, start from there. Make it a launching pad for a really good home for our little guy. Or gal.\u201d He stopped and it took a moment for Pepper to turn and find that his gaze was locked on her. \u201cMaybe?\u201d he asked, his voice much more hesitant than it had been.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s lips tilted slowly and she moved towards him, ignoring the confused look he gave her as she reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out his phone. It took half a moment for her to find the music she wanted and she set the phone on a nearby counter as she held out a hand to him. \u201cWe never got our first dance, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can fix that, Mrs Stark,\u201d Tony answered with a grin. He took her hand and pulled her close, fingers ghosting down the backless dress as she leaned into him, swaying to the music.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? The house? It\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor coming home to me.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, whatever he was going to say lost to the moment, and she felt his hold tighten ever so slightly around her as they danced.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0__________________________________</p><p><b>Notes</b>: Have I mentioned that I love these two? Because I love these two.<br></p><p>If all goes well I think the next installment may be Tony getting to be the doting husband while they try to get everything packed up to move while Pepper\u2019s pregnant. The fact that my own apartment is in the process of getting packed up for a move may be what\u2019s sparking the move fic\u2026 but hey, it fits? Maybe I can even manage all fluff without angst? We\u2019ll see. Might be a first :P </p>",

Apparently they\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cHe does miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, because Wilson and Barnes got snapped away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two were friends once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely,\u201d Tony snapped and waved it off. \u201cNext topic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooner or later you\u2019ll have to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Probably not. I\u2019m not coming back.\u201d He glanced back towards the group and wondered if Rogers had sent her in for this. No one else was joining them. \u201cC'mon, Nat. It\u2019s my wedding day. Pick pretty much anything else.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash of mischief in her eyes and he saw her lips quirk up at the corners. \u201cHow about why you guys decided to jump on the wedding when last I heard you were barely leaving your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for taking some time to recover from near death.\u201d She quirked an eyebrow at him and he knew that wasn\u2019t what she was getting out. How she\u2019d gotten to the truth that he and Pepper hadn\u2019t let slip was beyond him though. He wasn\u2019t even sure she\u2019d seenPepper, not that she was showing yet. \u201cHow -?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all,\u201d she answered cheekily, finally pulling the smallest of smiles from him. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it to yourself. If Happy or Rhodey either one don\u2019t think they\u2019re the first to know, I\u2019ll never hear the end of it. \u2018Specially Hap.\u201d</p><p>Natasha flashed a grin. \u201cWhat\u2019s it worth to you, Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it a wedding present,\u201d he huffed, coupled with what he hoped was a more intimidating look than it really felt. Maybe it would have been to anyone else. For Natasha Romanoff, it only seemed to amuse her more.</p><p>If she\u2019d planned on saying anymore more, though, she didn\u2019t get the chance. His friends - both former and current - had started to file in and find seats. The priest had taken his place at the front of the room and there was a shadow lingering just out of view of the doorway that Tony knew well.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, buddy?\u201d Rhodey asked him, a hand on his shoulder and gently guiding him towards the front.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 yeah. No. The ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ring?\u201d his best friend asked with a grin and held it up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d He sucked in a deep breath, shaking his hands out and trying to regain some control. He had been mostly fine just a moment before, but suddenly, as things started barreling forward, he felt overwhelmed. All of his thoughts and emotions folded in on each other and made it difficult to work through them, muchless think. \u201cWhy am I so nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you know who\u2019s about to walk through that door,\u201d Rhodey answered, finally getting him positioned where he needed to go. \u201cAnd you know there ain\u2019t no way in the world you\u2019d ever deserve her.\u201d Tony shot him a look. He wasn\u2019t wrong, but he didn\u2019t have to say it. Rhodey grinned. \u201cBut she loves you, and she said yes anyway. Gotta figure out how to do right by that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the younger man breathed softly as the shadow outside the door shortened and he saw Happy move to take Pepper\u2019s arm and escort her down the aisle. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did good, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Pepper met his eyes and Tony Stark was at a loss for words. All he could do was stare, her smile contagious as he he felt his own turn into a goofy grin that grew with each step she took. She\u2019d said yes. Yes to marrying him. Yes to building a family with him. After Thanos he hadn\u2019t thought he would ever feel any sort of peace again, but it worked its way in and pushed the overwhelming grief aside at least for a moment. In that moment she was all he could see.</p><p>Pepper came to stand with him and the priest began speaking. Tony could hear the words, his brain processed them on a basic level, but his focus was locked on the beautiful woman in front of him. He saw her smile fade ever so slightly. \u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>He blinked hard. Right. The priest had stopped and he was supposed to say something. He cleared his throat to try to find his voice to answer her. \u201cWow. Just\u2026.. wow.\u201d</p><p>Tony loved that smile she gave him. Part teasing, part exasperated, but most amused. Usually she swatted him, but Pepper had always managed to keep herself composed for the situation at hand. Not that this crowd would blink an eye if she smacked him.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m supposed to have a whole thing prepared-\u201d</p><p>\u201cVows?\u201d she prompted and he heard Rhodey snort behind him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I swear I did,\u201d he promised and that smile returned. \u201cBut right here, after everything they\u2019re just\u2026\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI love you, Pep. You\u2019ve put up with so much with me over the years, but\u2026 It\u2019s always been you and it\u2019s always gonna be you.\u201d He reached forward, his hand brushing hers and he pulled it up to press a kiss to her knuckles before slipping the ring into place. \u201cPlease don\u2019t change your mind?\u201d</p><p>That pulled a laugh out of her. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She caught his hand as he dropped it and leaned forward, her forehead pressed against his. He closed his eyes. \u201cI love you, Tony Stark,\u201d she breathed, moving to slide his new ring onto his finger. \u201cFor so long and through everything, I\u2019ve never stopped. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s grin tugged back into place at the promise that had been a constant reminder since he\u2019d come home. No matter what happened, they would face it together. The nightmares, the fears. They couldn\u2019t change the past, but together they could fight in a whole new way for their future.</p><p>The priest barely got through his <i>you may now kiss the bride</i> before Tony ducked down, his arms around her waist and her hands sliding to the lapels on his jacket to pull him deeper into the kiss.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ________________________________</p><p>This had been the happiest she had seen him since he\u2019d come home to her. From the moment she had started down the aisle to the the ring exchange where any pre-written vows had been tossed to the side for words that meant even more. Promises. Commitment.</p><p>Any thought of a short after party was quickly brushed aside as Tony said that they had somewhere to be. Happy had taken a cue and all Pepper could do was quirk an eyebrow at her new husband who offered her one of his more mischievous smiles. \u201cOne more surprise?\u201d he asked, motioning to the car as Happy pulled it around.</p><p>She swallowed the argument and climbed into the car. \u201cWill you tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he answered, his voice strangely chipper as he scooted over so that he was sitting right next to her. She shook her head at the antics as he looped his arm through hers to pull her a little closer. She leaned in, pressing a kiss to his shoulder as they settled in for the ride.</p><p>Pepper watched the city fade to country and into a wooded area, Happy easily navigating the trip as if it wasn\u2019t his first time out to wherever it was they were heading. Finally they pulled to a stop at the bottom of a hill next to a lake and she shot Tony a questioning look. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly dressed for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Promise.\u201d He stepped out of the car and circled around. Pepper was already halfway out by the time he got there, but there was something sweet on the way he offered her a hand. Her finger brushed his wedding band and he didn\u2019t let go once she was out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d she asked, her suspicion building on itself. A few years ago she might have thought he\u2019d taken her all the way out there for a late afternoon jump in the lake, but those had been different times and there would have been easier ways to do it if that had been the goal.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he urged, holding her hand to steady her on the dirt path that led to a cabin at the end of it.</p><p>\u201cTony, that\u2019s someone\u2019s house,\u201d she warned softly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer and she followed as well as she could in her heels, pulling the wedding dress up so she wouldn\u2019t snag it. There was a porch that wrapped around, newly remodeled, and Pepper\u2019s protests died as Tony led her up the steps. \u201cYou told me your family had a lake house when you were a kid, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d she answered slowly, watching him tap a code into the lockbox on the door. \u201cTony, what did you do\u2026.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me it was the best memories you had with your family as a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou listened?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI listen!\u201d he shot back, feigning hurt as he pushed the door open for her to walk in. \u201cFound this place. It needed some work. Still does, but in another month or so it should be ready.\u201d</p><p>Pepper stepped inside, her gaze sweeping the beautiful woodwork. The stairs and the living room. The kitchen and the dining area. \u201cDid you buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe bought it,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to move out of the city? And in this direction?\u201d They were nowhere near the Avengers compound. He\u2019d said he didn\u2019t want to go back, but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d made a decision out of pain or fear and circled back around to the suit. She loved him, and she wouldn\u2019t make it an ultimatum, but she\u2019d nearly lost him too many times. If he kept pushing it, there\u2019d be a day that his luck ran out and she didn\u2019t want to lose him. He\u2019d given so much for the Avengers already.</p><p>He turned, blinking owlishly at her. \u201cYou said you wanted to downgrade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimplify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in the chaos of your childhood, the lake house was a bright point. I thought we could, I don\u2019t know, start from there. Make it a launching pad for a really good home for our little guy. Or gal.\u201d He stopped and it took a moment for Pepper to turn and find that his gaze was locked on her. \u201cMaybe?\u201d he asked, his voice much more hesitant than it had been.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s lips tilted slowly and she moved towards him, ignoring the confused look he gave her as she reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out his phone. It took half a moment for her to find the music she wanted and she set the phone on a nearby counter as she held out a hand to him. \u201cWe never got our first dance, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can fix that, Mrs Stark,\u201d Tony answered with a grin. He took her hand and pulled her close, fingers ghosting down the backless dress as she leaned into him, swaying to the music.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? The house? It\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor coming home to me.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, whatever he was going to say lost to the moment, and she felt his hold tighten ever so slightly around her as they danced.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0__________________________________</p><p><b>Notes</b>: Have I mentioned that I love these two?

So he&rsquo;s not quitedone with surprises yet.</p><h2><b>Part Two: Simple</b></h2><p>Bigger did not always mean better when it came to Pepper Potts. That was a lesson that Tony had struggled with over the years. She ran Stark Industries and was engaged to him. That was more chaos than most people would be willing to put up with, so when she told him that she wanted a simple, quiet wedding Tony had done his best not to let his ever-active imagination run away with him. He liked flashy. He liked showy, but he&rsquo;d made a conscious effort to remember that it really wasn&rsquo;t about what he wanted or how he was used to doing things. This was about the woman he loved saying yes and being willing to put up with his shenanigans for the rest of their lives together. She hadn&rsquo;t asked for much, but she&rsquo;d been clear: close friends, no media, and simple. Had she stressed simple? If she hadn&rsquo;t, <i>simple</i>.</p><p>Then Thanos&rsquo; goons had shown up in the middle of New York - again - and Tony had hopped a ride to another galaxy to fight the demon that had haunted him for so long. He&rsquo;d fought and he&rsquo;d lost, and nothing seemed simple anymore. Everywhere he looked he saw the scars left behind, the lives snapped out of existence. Friends that would have made it onto their shortlist for the wedding were gone forever, all because they couldn&rsquo;t beat the Titan back. He&rsquo;d tried. He&rsquo;d nearly died for it, but he hadn&rsquo;t been strong enough. Not to beat Thanos and not to save the ones he had stolen away. He hadn&rsquo;t been strong enough to protect the kid.</p><p>The sound of the door opening behind him shook Tony out of his thoughts and he ran a hand through his hair. Not today. He couldn&rsquo;t let himself get caught up in that today. He pulled in a breath that he hoped would steady him and stood, turning to see what was left of their invite list entering the small space along with a few more recent additions. Danvers, Nebula, the raccoon that Tony still couldn&rsquo;t remember the name of, and Steve Rogers. The last had been a begrudging addition to the roster. He hadn&rsquo;t spoken to him since he&rsquo;d pushed the portable ARC reactor that stored his suit into Steve&rsquo;s hands and called him a liar.</p><p>&ldquo;You planning on yelling at him until you collapse again?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony turned to see Natasha Romanoff had broken away from the others. &ldquo;Thinking about it, just without the collapsing part.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked him up and down. &ldquo;You look better, but not toe-to-toe with Cap kind of better.&rdquo;</p><p>He huffed and caught her smile. They both knew he was all talk on it. They&rsquo;d been down that road before and as good as it felt to take knock Captain America in his perfect teeth every now and again, it was his wedding day, and <i>technically</i> he&rsquo;d been invited. Pepper had said it would be cruel to leave him as the sole uninvited Avenger left, and it wasn&rsquo;t like either of them had thought Cap would show anyway. Apparently they&rsquo;d been wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;He does miss you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, because Wilson and Barnes got snapped away?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You two were friends once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Barely,&rdquo; Tony snapped and waved it off. &ldquo;Next topic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sooner or later you&rsquo;ll have to deal with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. Probably not. I&rsquo;m not coming back.&rdquo; He glanced back towards the group and wondered if Rogers had sent her in for this. No one else was joining them. &ldquo;C'mon, Nat.

It&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For coming home to me.&rdquo;</p><p>He stopped, whatever he was going to say lost to the moment, and she felt his hold tighten ever so slightly around her as they danced.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__________________________________</p><p><b>Notes</b>: Have I mentioned that I love these two?

So he&rsquo;s not quitedone with surprises yet.</p>\n<h2><b>Part Two: Simple</b></h2>\n<p>Bigger did not always mean better when it came to Pepper Potts. That was a lesson that Tony had struggled with over the years. She ran Stark Industries and was engaged to him. That was more chaos than most people would be willing to put up with, so when she told him that she wanted a simple, quiet wedding Tony had done his best not to let his ever-active imagination run away with him. He liked flashy. He liked showy, but he&rsquo;d made a conscious effort to remember that it really wasn&rsquo;t about what he wanted or how he was used to doing things. This was about the woman he loved saying yes and being willing to put up with his shenanigans for the rest of their lives together. She hadn&rsquo;t asked for much, but she&rsquo;d been clear: close friends, no media, and simple. Had she stressed simple? If she hadn&rsquo;t, <i>simple</i>.</p>\n<p>Then Thanos&rsquo; goons had shown up in the middle of New York - again - and Tony had hopped a ride to another galaxy to fight the demon that had haunted him for so long. He&rsquo;d fought and he&rsquo;d lost, and nothing seemed simple anymore. Everywhere he looked he saw the scars left behind, the lives snapped out of existence. Friends that would have made it onto their shortlist for the wedding were gone forever, all because they couldn&rsquo;t beat the Titan back. He&rsquo;d tried. He&rsquo;d nearly died for it, but he hadn&rsquo;t been strong enough. Not to beat Thanos and not to save the ones he had stolen away. He hadn&rsquo;t been strong enough to protect the kid.</p>\n<p>The sound of the door opening behind him shook Tony out of his thoughts and he ran a hand through his hair. Not today. He couldn&rsquo;t let himself get caught up in that today. He pulled in a breath that he hoped would steady him and stood, turning to see what was left of their invite list entering the small space along with a few more recent additions. Danvers, Nebula, the raccoon that Tony still couldn&rsquo;t remember the name of, and Steve Rogers. The last had been a begrudging addition to the roster. He hadn&rsquo;t spoken to him since he&rsquo;d pushed the portable ARC reactor that stored his suit into Steve&rsquo;s hands and called him a liar.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You planning on yelling at him until you collapse again?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony turned to see Natasha Romanoff had broken away from the others. &ldquo;Thinking about it, just without the collapsing part.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Sorry this is short &lt;3</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>Toni Stark is a bitch. She\u2019s a bitch, that\u2019s covered in ugly scars, stretch marks, cellulite, and other ugly marks.\u00a0</p><p>She\u2019s a bitch that can\u2019t have kids anymore\u2013or at least, give birth. She can technically get pregnant.\u00a0</p><p>And Toni Stark is completely and utterly in love with Peter Parker.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s way too young for her, he\u2019s not even 21 yet. He\u2019s only 20, he\u2019s in college, he\u2019s <i>young</i>. Peter Parker is smart and strong and hot as hell. He has no scars or blemishes, he\u2019s muscular and just\u2013so handsome. He can get any girl in the entire world, any <i>virgin</i> in the entire world.\u00a0</p><p>Toni is not a virgin. She\u2019s a borderline porn star, with how many sex tapes are out there with her in them.</p><p>(Not that she knew about all of them being filmed, but she figures that having sex with many people is a pretty big sign she doesn\u2019t care if people know.)</p><p>Toni has a pussy that\u2019s stretched and used and\u2013don\u2019t get her wrong, she knows her pussy is still hot and sexy. She still has men drooling and tripping over themselves to beg for her to let them lick her pussy and leave them hanging.</p><p>But she isn\u2019t a virgin, and Peter Parker deserves someone who is young and tight and perfect and not covered in scars and ugly marks.\u00a0</p><p>So she usually turns down Peter\u2019s advances, saying he should find someone his own age. He should be with someone who can give him kids. He should be with someone who isn\u2019t a slut.</p><p>But Peter keeps trying.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cMs. Stark, I really think you think I care about your age more than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, find someone who isn\u2019t ugly and covered in scars.\u201d She huffs angrily.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath hitches, and he walks closer, kissing her on the lips softly.\u00a0</p><p>Toni gasps and pulls back.\u00a0\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>Peter pushes her against the wall. He pulls her shirt slightly.\u00a0</p><p>Toni swallows thickly.\u00a0\u201cFine, but I warned you.\u201d She closes her eyes and tears her shirt off. She hasn\u2019t been able to war a real bra in years, due to the arc reactor, so there\u2019s no need to take that off. She keeps her eyes closed, not ready to see the look of disgust in his eyes, the horror in his face. She takes in sharp breaths, trying not to cry.\u00a0</p><p>So when Peter grabs her hips, her eyes fly open in surprise.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Ms. Stark.\u201d</p><p>Toni shakes her head, looking down at the reactor in her chest.\u00a0\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m covered in scars and ugly.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns and leans forward, kissing around the arc reactor in a circle. He feels her gasp against his lips, her chest fluttering too fast to not notice she\u2019s going to cry. He kisses down, to more scars and marks and ugly ugly parts of Toni.\u00a0</p><p>But\u2026 he isn\u2019t disgusted? Toni whimpers as he kisses her hips, falling to his knees.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re perfect, Toni.
