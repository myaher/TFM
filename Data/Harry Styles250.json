She went for her morning run with her best friend Rocky. He was a full blooded German Shepherd. He fur was jet black and shiny. </p><p>She was back by 8 to eat breakfast and get ready. Walking out of her apartment building promptly at 9 a.m she was met with the most handsome of faces. </p><p>He was dressed casually in a black tee and jeans. His guitar resting in a case beside him. </p><p>She gave him a bright smile as she made her way towards him. </p><p>&ldquo;Goodmorning,&rdquo; she said cheerfully. </p><p>&ldquo;Goodmorming,&rdquo; he said chuckling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a good mood this morning. Did you sleep well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did. However I&rsquo;m always in a good mood on saturdays. It&rsquo;s my favorite day. When I don&rsquo;t have to work that is.&rdquo; She started walking with him following beside her. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you do for work?&rdquo;</p><p>She was thoughtful for a minute. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely day isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She asked not answering his question. </p><p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer my question though, or is it another one of your mysteries?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; She said giving him a wink. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t have what you would call a normal job. It&rsquo;s highly classified so I try to limit the people who know about it.&rdquo;</p><p>This intrigued him even more. What kind of job did she have that she couldn&rsquo;t tell people about? </p><p>They walked in silence for a while. Harrys mind was racing. He was beyond curious about what she did for a living. He wanted to know more, but was sure she wouldn&rsquo;t give him any hints. He decided to drop it for now. </p><p>&ldquo;So where are we going?&rdquo; He asked finally. </p><p>&ldquo;I told you it&rsquo;s a secret. Trust me though, you&rsquo;ll enjoy it. We&rsquo;re not far now.&rdquo; </p><p>While they continued to walk down the street, he took the time to admire her. She too had opted for a casual attire. She wore a navy blue vee neck and jeans. She also carried a small backpack. She had her hair in a lose bun and very little makeup. She was stunning. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes off her. Her piercing eyes stared straight ahead. She was lost in thought so he could stare at her freely. Her lips were full and a bright shade of pink. He briefly wondered what it would be like to kiss them, causing him to bite his lip. His thoughts, however, were soon interrupted. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she said stopping in front of a tall building. </p><p>The sign read Saint Judes Children&rsquo;s Hospital. </p><p>He looked at her smiling face, as she started to walk in the building. He silently followed behind her, wondering what they were doing there. Walking into the elevator she pushed the button for the 8th floor. </p><p>&ldquo;What are we doing here?&rdquo; He asked when he could not longer stand not knowing. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; she told him. She gave him a bright smile that made his heart flutter and he lost his train of thought. </p><p>The elevators opened and she walked towards the front desk. </p><p>&ldquo;Adalyn! It&rsquo;s so good to see you! It feels like it&rsquo;s been forever!&rdquo; A short, young, and blonde girl called out. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Carla! I know it does! How was the vacation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was great! We had a blast! We need to get together for drinks, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it. Oh whose this?&rdquo; She asked when she noticed Harry behind her. </p><p>&ldquo;This is my friend Harry. He&rsquo;s come to help me out a bit today. Harry this is Carla.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry? As in THE Harry Styles?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Harry said with a slight chuckle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my word the kids are going to go nuts! It&rsquo;s so good to meet you! How did you manage this?!&rdquo; Carla asked turning back to Adalyn. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Where is everyone today?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in the rec room.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great! Thank you! I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Have fun!&rdquo; Carla called out.</p><p>Grabbing Harrys hand she started walking down a long hallway. Harry took his chance and intertwined his fingers with hers. He felt sparks, just by touching her skin. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still confused, why are we here?&rdquo;</p><p>She continued to walk without saying a word. At the end of hall, she stopped and turned to him. They stopped just outside of a long brown door. He could hear children laughing inside. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. So I volunteer here every weekend. Well I try to at least when I&rsquo;m not working. I like to come as much as I can though. There&rsquo;s not much to it really. We just entertain the kids. We try to take their minds off of everything that&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; She explained in a rush. </p><p>He looked at her in complete awe. She was so much more amazing than he had thought. She was so selfless and had a huge heart. This girl was incredible!</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this,&rdquo; he responded giving her a bright smile.</p><p>They walked in the room and all the kids instantly started running towards Adalyn. </p><p>They were all yelling at her. &ldquo;Addie!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Yayy Adalyns here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heyy everyone! Are we ready to have some fun?&rdquo; She called out giving them each a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeahh!!!&rdquo; The kids all cheered. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Well I have a surprise for you all. As some of you may already know, this is my friend Harry Styles. He&rsquo;s come to sing for us!&rdquo;</p><p>The kids all cheered and started to gather around Harry. He gave them a breathtaking smile and pulled out his guitar. He sat down with the kids and started singing for them. In between songs he would play around with them and ask them a ton of questions. Adalyn was having a good time just watching Harry interacting with the children. </p><p>She took a look around the room and frowned when she didn&rsquo;t see who she was searching for. Turning towards the nearest person she asked for help.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen Sophie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s in her room. Poor dear hasn&rsquo;t been feeling too well.&rdquo; An older women explained. </p><p>Frowning she went to Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Harry. I&rsquo;m gonna step out for a minute. There&rsquo;s someone I need to check on.&rdquo; </p><p>Taking in her worried expression, he stood up. &ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll join you.&rdquo;</p><p>She hesitated but to his suprise agreed. Without another word she started towards the door down the opposite side of the hall that had come earlier. She was radiating tention. </p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; He asked quietly. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; She frowned. </p><p>They stopped outside of room 309, and she took a deep settling breath. She put on a big smile, before entering the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello my dear. How are you feeling?&rdquo; She called out cheerfully. </p><p>&ldquo;Addie?&rdquo; A weak voice asked. </p><p>Harry walked in the dimly lite room. On the bed in the center of the room was a small girl. She looked to be around the age of 5 and had many tubs hooked up to her. She looked extremely fragile, and his heart broke instantly. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Adalyn told her gently. She went to her bed and slowly laid down beside her. &ldquo;How are you feeling&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know you are honey. Get you some rest.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Will you stay with me?&rdquo; She whimpered. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere,&rdquo; she promised. </p><p>Harry quietly took a seat beside the bed. He watched the two carefully. Adalyn started to softly hum, as the little girl closed her eyes. It wasn&rsquo;t long before her breathing became heavy and she started to quietly snore. Adalyn became quiet and her hold on Sophie became tighter. </p><p>There was a soft knock on the door and a man poked his head in. Taking in the scene, he quietly walked in. He looked to be in his early thirtys. He was tall with dark brown hair and wore a white coat. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Adalyn.&rdquo; The man greeted her. &ldquo;I was just coming to check in on Sophie here. How she doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She just went to sleep. I haven&rsquo;t been here long.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded taking a look at the monitors. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good is it?&rdquo; She whispered. </p><p>He looked pained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. Can we speak outside? I don&rsquo;t want her to overhear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said. She slowly got up, careful not to wake the sleeping girl. </p><p>Harry wasn&rsquo;t sure if he should follow them outside or not so he stayed put. It couldn&rsquo;t have been good news, and his heart broke for the poor girl. She looked so small and frail, laying on the hospital bed. </p><p>After waiting for fifteen minutes, Harry decided to go after them. No one had come back in the room since they&rsquo;d left, and he was starting to get worried. Opening the door, he found Adalyn in the hallway sitting on the floor. She had her knees bent up with her arms folded on top of them. Her head was down, hiding her face in her arms. </p><p>Harry quietly sat down beside her. He put his arms around her and brought her in close. </p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; He asked softly. </p><p>She looked up at him and wrapped her arms around him bringing them even closer. He noticed that she was crying and started to rub her back slowly. They sat like that in silence for a little while longer. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, pulling away and wiping her eyes. </p><p>Harry took her hand in his intertwining their fingers. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not fair!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;These kids, they don&rsquo;t deserve this. It kills me every time I come here, but I feel like I have to help in anyway I can.&rdquo; She cried.</p><p>Harry put his arms around her once more and held her as she cried. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to make it,&rdquo; she whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Sophie. Her cancer has spread everywhere. She&rsquo;s not responding to treatment so there&rsquo;s not much more they can do. She&rsquo;s going to die. Her doctor said it could be any moment now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; He tightened his grip on her. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only four and has been in this hospital her entire life. Her family abandoned her, when they were told she had cancer. She&rsquo;s been through so much and was finally getting better! I just don&rsquo;t understand. I was going to adopt her. I was going to give her the life she deserves and now this..&rdquo; she sobbed. </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart broke in two.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he said again stroking her hair. </p><p>He held her as she cried and rocked her softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I promised you a fun day. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to turn out this way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.. There&rsquo;s nothing to apologize for. I did have fun today, and I&rsquo;m glad I could be here for you.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked up at him smiling. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, giving him a kiss on the cheek. &ldquo;I should really try to contact her family though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Would you like me to help you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s alright. It will probably take a while, and I know you have a show tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>They slowly stood up. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I see you again?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she stated simply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tonight.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p><p><br/></p><p>Harry was back at the arena getting ready to put on his second and final show for this town. His mind was everywhere. He couldn\u2019t get the events that happened earlier in the day out of his mind. Adalyn had been so upset and it broke his heart. He was seriously starting to fall for this girl. She was such a good person, and he had never met anyone like her before. When she wasn\u2019t working, she spent her free time volunteering for a children\u2019s hospital. He didn\u2019t know very many people who were that selfless. She inspired him and he couldn\u2019t get her off of his mind.</p><p>All throughout the show, his mind was elsewhere. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder how Adalyn was and when he would see her again. He also couldn\u2019t get Sophie off of his mine. He didn\u2019t know the girl well, but no child deserved a life like that. He wondered how she was doing, and if she would pull through.</p><p>He was just stepping off of the stage when he saw her.</p><p>Confused, he called out to her, \u201cAdalyn?\u201d</p><p>Turning around she spotted Harry. \u201cOhh hey,\u201d she greeted him.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, but what are you doing here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell I told you I would see you tonight didn\u2019t I?\u201d She said shrugging.</p><p>\u201cYeah but I thought you meant dinner or..\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she interrupted him. \u201cGet down!\u201d she yelled pushing him to the floor.</p><p>He looked at her in first confusion and then horror.</p><p>Three gunshots were heard and then the world went silent\u2026</p>",

He put his arms around her and brought her in close. </p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d He asked softly. </p><p>She looked up at him and wrapped her arms around him bringing them even closer. He noticed that she was crying and started to rub her back slowly. They sat like that in silence for a little while longer. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, pulling away and wiping her eyes. </p><p>Harry took her hand in his intertwining their fingers. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not fair!\u201d she replied. \u201cThese kids, they don\u2019t deserve this. It kills me every time I come here, but I feel like I have to help in anyway I can.\u201d She cried.</p><p>Harry put his arms around her once more and held her as she cried. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to make it,\u201d she whispered. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cSophie. Her cancer has spread everywhere. She\u2019s not responding to treatment so there\u2019s not much more they can do. She\u2019s going to die. Her doctor said it could be any moment now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He tightened his grip on her. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only four and has been in this hospital her entire life. Her family abandoned her, when they were told she had cancer. She\u2019s been through so much and was finally getting better! I just don\u2019t understand. I was going to adopt her. I was going to give her the life she deserves and now this..\u201d she sobbed. </p><p>Harry\u2019s heart broke in two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said again stroking her hair. </p><p>He held her as she cried and rocked her softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I promised you a fun day. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to turn out this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.. There\u2019s nothing to apologize for. I did have fun today, and I\u2019m glad I could be here for you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him smiling. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, giving him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI should really try to contact her family though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Would you like me to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s alright. It will probably take a while, and I know you have a show tonight.\u201d</p><p>They slowly stood up. </p><p>\u201cCan I see you again?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she stated simply. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><p><br></p><p>Harry was back at the arena getting ready to put on his second and final show for this town. His mind was everywhere. He couldn\u2019t get the events that happened earlier in the day out of his mind. Adalyn had been so upset and it broke his heart. He was seriously starting to fall for this girl. She was such a good person, and he had never met anyone like her before. When she wasn\u2019t working, she spent her free time volunteering for a children\u2019s hospital. He didn\u2019t know very many people who were that selfless.

She went for her morning run with her best friend Rocky. He was a full blooded German Shepherd. He fur was jet black and shiny. </p><p>She was back by 8 to eat breakfast and get ready. Walking out of her apartment building promptly at 9 a.m she was met with the most handsome of faces. </p><p>He was dressed casually in a black tee and jeans. His guitar resting in a case beside him. </p><p>She gave him a bright smile as she made her way towards him. </p><p>\u201cGoodmorning,\u201d she said cheerfully. </p><p>\u201cGoodmorming,\u201d he said chuckling. \u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood this morning. Did you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. However I\u2019m always in a good mood on saturdays. It\u2019s my favorite day. When I don\u2019t have to work that is.\u201d She started walking with him following beside her. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you do for work?\u201d</p><p>She was thoughtful for a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day isn\u2019t it?\u201d She asked not answering his question. </p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question though, or is it another one of your mysteries?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She said giving him a wink. \u201cI just don\u2019t have what you would call a normal job. It\u2019s highly classified so I try to limit the people who know about it.\u201d</p><p>This intrigued him even more. What kind of job did she have that she couldn\u2019t tell people about? </p><p>They walked in silence for a while. Harrys mind was racing. He was beyond curious about what she did for a living. He wanted to know more, but was sure she wouldn\u2019t give him any hints. He decided to drop it for now. </p><p>\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d He asked finally. </p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019s a secret. Trust me though, you\u2019ll enjoy it. We\u2019re not far now.\u201d </p><p>While they continued to walk down the street, he took the time to admire her. She too had opted for a casual attire. She wore a navy blue vee neck and jeans. She also carried a small backpack. She had her hair in a lose bun and very little makeup. She was stunning. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her. Her piercing eyes stared straight ahead. She was lost in thought so he could stare at her freely. Her lips were full and a bright shade of pink. He briefly wondered what it would be like to kiss them, causing him to bite his lip. His thoughts, however, were soon interrupted. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d she said stopping in front of a tall building. </p><p>The sign read Saint Judes Children\u2019s Hospital. </p><p>He looked at her smiling face, as she started to walk in the building. He silently followed behind her, wondering what they were doing there. Walking into the elevator she pushed the button for the 8th floor. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d He asked when he could not longer stand not knowing. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d she told him. She gave him a bright smile that made his heart flutter and he lost his train of thought. </p><p>The elevators opened and she walked towards the front desk. </p><p>\u201cAdalyn! It\u2019s so good to see you! It feels like it\u2019s been forever!\u201d A short, young, and blonde girl called out. </p><p>\u201cHey Carla! I know it does! How was the vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great! We had a blast! We need to get together for drinks, and I\u2019ll tell you all about it. Oh whose this?\u201d She asked when she noticed Harry behind her. </p><p>\u201cThis is my friend Harry. He\u2019s come to help me out a bit today. Harry this is Carla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry? As in THE Harry Styles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Harry said with a slight chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my word the kids are going to go nuts! It\u2019s so good to meet you! How did you manage this?!\u201d Carla asked turning back to Adalyn. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWhere is everyone today?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all in the rec room.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat! Thank you! I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHave fun!\u201d Carla called out.</p><p>Grabbing Harrys hand she started walking down a long hallway. Harry took his chance and intertwined his fingers with hers. He felt sparks, just by touching her skin. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still confused, why are we here?\u201d</p><p>She continued to walk without saying a word. At the end of hall, she stopped and turned to him. They stopped just outside of a long brown door. He could hear children laughing inside. </p><p>\u201cOkay. So I volunteer here every weekend. Well I try to at least when I\u2019m not working. I like to come as much as I can though. There\u2019s not much to it really. We just entertain the kids. We try to take their minds off of everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d She explained in a rush. </p><p>He looked at her in complete awe. She was so much more amazing than he had thought. She was so selfless and had a huge heart. This girl was incredible!</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d he responded giving her a bright smile.</p><p>They walked in the room and all the kids instantly started running towards Adalyn. </p><p>They were all yelling at her. \u201cAddie!\u201d, \u201cYayy Adalyns here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeyy everyone! Are we ready to have some fun?\u201d She called out giving them each a hug.</p><p>\u201cYeahh!!!\u201d The kids all cheered. </p><p>\u201cAlright. Well I have a surprise for you all. As some of you may already know, this is my friend Harry Styles. He\u2019s come to sing for us!\u201d</p><p>The kids all cheered and started to gather around Harry. He gave them a breathtaking smile and pulled out his guitar. He sat down with the kids and started singing for them. In between songs he would play around with them and ask them a ton of questions. Adalyn was having a good time just watching Harry interacting with the children. </p><p>She took a look around the room and frowned when she didn\u2019t see who she was searching for. Turning towards the nearest person she asked for help.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s in her room. Poor dear hasn\u2019t been feeling too well.\u201d An older women explained. </p><p>Frowning she went to Harry. </p><p>\u201cHey Harry. I\u2019m gonna step out for a minute. There\u2019s someone I need to check on.\u201d </p><p>Taking in her worried expression, he stood up. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated but to his suprise agreed. Without another word she started towards the door down the opposite side of the hall that had come earlier. She was radiating tention. </p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d He asked quietly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d She frowned. </p><p>They stopped outside of room 309, and she took a deep settling breath. She put on a big smile, before entering the room. </p><p>\u201cHello my dear. How are you feeling?\u201d She called out cheerfully. </p><p>\u201cAddie?\u201d A weak voice asked. </p><p>Harry walked in the dimly lite room. On the bed in the center of the room was a small girl. She looked to be around the age of 5 and had many tubs hooked up to her. She looked extremely fragile, and his heart broke instantly. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Adalyn told her gently. She went to her bed and slowly laid down beside her. \u201cHow are you feeling\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know you are honey. Get you some rest.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWill you stay with me?\u201d She whimpered. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she promised. </p><p>Harry quietly took a seat beside the bed. He watched the two carefully. Adalyn started to softly hum, as the little girl closed her eyes. It wasn\u2019t long before her breathing became heavy and she started to quietly snore. Adalyn became quiet and her hold on Sophie became tighter. </p><p>There was a soft knock on the door and a man poked his head in. Taking in the scene, he quietly walked in. He looked to be in his early thirtys. He was tall with dark brown hair and wore a white coat. </p><p>\u201cHey Adalyn.\u201d The man greeted her. \u201cI was just coming to check in on Sophie here. How she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just went to sleep. I haven\u2019t been here long.\u201d</p><p>He nodded taking a look at the monitors. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good is it?\u201d She whispered. </p><p>He looked pained. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Can we speak outside? I don\u2019t want her to overhear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. She slowly got up, careful not to wake the sleeping girl. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t sure if he should follow them outside or not so he stayed put. It couldn\u2019t have been good news, and his heart broke for the poor girl. She looked so small and frail, laying on the hospital bed. </p><p>After waiting for fifteen minutes, Harry decided to go after them. No one had come back in the room since they\u2019d left, and he was starting to get worried. Opening the door, he found Adalyn in the hallway sitting on the floor. She had her knees bent up with her arms folded on top of them. Her head was down, hiding her face in her arms. </p><p>Harry quietly sat down beside her. He put his arms around her and brought her in close. </p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d He asked softly. </p><p>She looked up at him and wrapped her arms around him bringing them even closer. He noticed that she was crying and started to rub her back slowly. They sat like that in silence for a little while longer. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, pulling away and wiping her eyes. </p><p>Harry took her hand in his intertwining their fingers. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not fair!\u201d she replied. \u201cThese kids, they don\u2019t deserve this. It kills me every time I come here, but I feel like I have to help in anyway I can.\u201d She cried.</p><p>Harry put his arms around her once more and held her as she cried. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to make it,\u201d she whispered. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cSophie. Her cancer has spread everywhere. She\u2019s not responding to treatment so there\u2019s not much more they can do. She\u2019s going to die. Her doctor said it could be any moment now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He tightened his grip on her. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only four and has been in this hospital her entire life.

It&rsquo;s highly classified so I try to limit the people who know about it.&rdquo;</p><p>This intrigued him even more. What kind of job did she have that she couldn&rsquo;t tell people about? </p><p>They walked in silence for a while. Harrys mind was racing. He was beyond curious about what she did for a living. He wanted to know more, but was sure she wouldn&rsquo;t give him any hints. He decided to drop it for now. </p><p>&ldquo;So where are we going?&rdquo; He asked finally. </p><p>&ldquo;I told you it&rsquo;s a secret. Trust me though, you&rsquo;ll enjoy it. We&rsquo;re not far now.&rdquo; </p><p>While they continued to walk down the street, he took the time to admire her. She too had opted for a casual attire. She wore a navy blue vee neck and jeans. She also carried a small backpack. She had her hair in a lose bun and very little makeup. She was stunning. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes off her. Her piercing eyes stared straight ahead. She was lost in thought so he could stare at her freely. Her lips were full and a bright shade of pink. He briefly wondered what it would be like to kiss them, causing him to bite his lip. His thoughts, however, were soon interrupted. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she said stopping in front of a tall building. </p><p>The sign read Saint Judes Children&rsquo;s Hospital. </p><p>He looked at her smiling face, as she started to walk in the building. He silently followed behind her, wondering what they were doing there. Walking into the elevator she pushed the button for the 8th floor. </p><p>&ldquo;What are we doing here?&rdquo; He asked when he could not longer stand not knowing. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; she told him. She gave him a bright smile that made his heart flutter and he lost his train of thought. </p><p>The elevators opened and she walked towards the front desk. </p><p>&ldquo;Adalyn! It&rsquo;s so good to see you! It feels like it&rsquo;s been forever!&rdquo; A short, young, and blonde girl called out. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Carla! I know it does! How was the vacation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was great! We had a blast! We need to get together for drinks, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it. Oh whose this?&rdquo; She asked when she noticed Harry behind her. </p><p>&ldquo;This is my friend Harry. He&rsquo;s come to help me out a bit today. Harry this is Carla.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry? As in THE Harry Styles?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Harry said with a slight chuckle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my word the kids are going to go nuts! It&rsquo;s so good to meet you! How did you manage this?!&rdquo; Carla asked turning back to Adalyn. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Where is everyone today?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in the rec room.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great! Thank you! I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Have fun!&rdquo; Carla called out.</p><p>Grabbing Harrys hand she started walking down a long hallway. Harry took his chance and intertwined his fingers with hers. He felt sparks, just by touching her skin. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still confused, why are we here?&rdquo;</p><p>She continued to walk without saying a word. At the end of hall, she stopped and turned to him. They stopped just outside of a long brown door. He could hear children laughing inside. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. So I volunteer here every weekend. Well I try to at least when I&rsquo;m not working. I like to come as much as I can though. There&rsquo;s not much to it really. We just entertain the kids. We try to take their minds off of everything that&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; She explained in a rush. </p><p>He looked at her in complete awe. She was so much more amazing than he had thought. She was so selfless and had a huge heart. This girl was incredible!</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this,&rdquo; he responded giving her a bright smile.</p><p>They walked in the room and all the kids instantly started running towards Adalyn. </p><p>They were all yelling at her. &ldquo;Addie!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Yayy Adalyns here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heyy everyone! Are we ready to have some fun?&rdquo; She called out giving them each a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeahh!!!&rdquo; The kids all cheered. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Well I have a surprise for you all. As some of you may already know, this is my friend Harry Styles. He&rsquo;s come to sing for us!&rdquo;</p><p>The kids all cheered and started to gather around Harry. He gave them a breathtaking smile and pulled out his guitar. He sat down with the kids and started singing for them. In between songs he would play around with them and ask them a ton of questions. Adalyn was having a good time just watching Harry interacting with the children. </p><p>She took a look around the room and frowned when she didn&rsquo;t see who she was searching for. Turning towards the nearest person she asked for help.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen Sophie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s in her room. Poor dear hasn&rsquo;t been feeling too well.&rdquo; An older women explained. </p><p>Frowning she went to Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Harry. I&rsquo;m gonna step out for a minute. There&rsquo;s someone I need to check on.&rdquo; </p><p>Taking in her worried expression, he stood up. &ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll join you.&rdquo;</p><p>She hesitated but to his suprise agreed. Without another word she started towards the door down the opposite side of the hall that had come earlier. She was radiating tention. </p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; He asked quietly. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; She frowned. </p><p>They stopped outside of room 309, and she took a deep settling breath. She put on a big smile, before entering the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello my dear. How are you feeling?&rdquo; She called out cheerfully. </p><p>&ldquo;Addie?&rdquo; A weak voice asked. </p><p>Harry walked in the dimly lite room. On the bed in the center of the room was a small girl. She looked to be around the age of 5 and had many tubs hooked up to her. She looked extremely fragile, and his heart broke instantly. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Adalyn told her gently. She went to her bed and slowly laid down beside her. &ldquo;How are you feeling&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know you are honey. Get you some rest.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Will you stay with me?&rdquo; She whimpered. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere,&rdquo; she promised. </p><p>Harry quietly took a seat beside the bed. He watched the two carefully. Adalyn started to softly hum, as the little girl closed her eyes. It wasn&rsquo;t long before her breathing became heavy and she started to quietly snore. Adalyn became quiet and her hold on Sophie became tighter. </p><p>There was a soft knock on the door and a man poked his head in. Taking in the scene, he quietly walked in. He looked to be in his early thirtys. He was tall with dark brown hair and wore a white coat. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Adalyn.&rdquo; The man greeted her. &ldquo;I was just coming to check in on Sophie here. How she doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She just went to sleep. I haven&rsquo;t been here long.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded taking a look at the monitors. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good is it?&rdquo; She whispered. </p><p>He looked pained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. Can we speak outside? I don&rsquo;t want her to overhear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said. She slowly got up, careful not to wake the sleeping girl. </p><p>Harry wasn&rsquo;t sure if he should follow them outside or not so he stayed put. It couldn&rsquo;t have been good news, and his heart broke for the poor girl. She looked so small and frail, laying on the hospital bed. </p><p>After waiting for fifteen minutes, Harry decided to go after them. No one had come back in the room since they&rsquo;d left, and he was starting to get worried. Opening the door, he found Adalyn in the hallway sitting on the floor. She had her knees bent up with her arms folded on top of them. Her head was down, hiding her face in her arms. </p><p>Harry quietly sat down beside her. He put his arms around her and brought her in close. </p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; He asked softly. </p><p>She looked up at him and wrapped her arms around him bringing them even closer. He noticed that she was crying and started to rub her back slowly. They sat like that in silence for a little while longer. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, pulling away and wiping her eyes. </p><p>Harry took her hand in his intertwining their fingers. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not fair!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;These kids, they don&rsquo;t deserve this. It kills me every time I come here, but I feel like I have to help in anyway I can.&rdquo; She cried.</p><p>Harry put his arms around her once more and held her as she cried. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to make it,&rdquo; she whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Sophie. Her cancer has spread everywhere. She&rsquo;s not responding to treatment so there&rsquo;s not much more they can do. She&rsquo;s going to die. Her doctor said it could be any moment now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; He tightened his grip on her. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only four and has been in this hospital her entire life. Her family abandoned her, when they were told she had cancer. She&rsquo;s been through so much and was finally getting better! I just don&rsquo;t understand. I was going to adopt her. I was going to give her the life she deserves and now this..&rdquo; she sobbed. </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart broke in two.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he said again stroking her hair. </p><p>He held her as she cried and rocked her softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I promised you a fun day. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to turn out this way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.. There&rsquo;s nothing to apologize for. I did have fun today, and I&rsquo;m glad I could be here for you.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked up at him smiling. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, giving him a kiss on the cheek. &ldquo;I should really try to contact her family though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Would you like me to help you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s alright. It will probably take a while, and I know you have a show tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>They slowly stood up. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I see you again?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she stated simply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tonight.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p><p><br /></p><p>Harry was back at the arena getting ready to put on his second and final show for this town. His mind was everywhere. He couldn&rsquo;t get the events that happened earlier in the day out of his mind. Adalyn had been so upset and it broke his heart. He was seriously starting to fall for this girl. She was such a good person, and he had never met anyone like her before. When she wasn&rsquo;t working, she spent her free time volunteering for a children&rsquo;s hospital. He didn&rsquo;t know very many people who were that selfless. She inspired him and he couldn&rsquo;t get her off of his mind.</p><p>All throughout the show, his mind was elsewhere. He couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder how Adalyn was and when he would see her again. He also couldn&rsquo;t get Sophie off of his mine. He didn&rsquo;t know the girl well, but no child deserved a life like that. He wondered how she was doing, and if she would pull through.</p><p>He was just stepping off of the stage when he saw her.</p><p>Confused, he called out to her, &ldquo;Adalyn?&rdquo;</p><p>Turning around she spotted Harry. &ldquo;Ohh hey,&rdquo; she greeted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m complaining, but what are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I told you I would see you tonight didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; She said shrugging.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but I thought you meant dinner or..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; she interrupted him. &ldquo;Get down!&rdquo; she yelled pushing him to the floor.</p><p>He looked at her in first confusion and then horror.</p><p>Three gunshots were heard and then the world went silent&hellip;</p></p>",

Jacob was happily snoozing in his moses basket as you flicked through the rack of clothes. Looking down at yourself in the mirror, you could see your tummy was not as flat as it used to be, it had a few stretch marks on it to.\u00a0</p><p>Letting out a sigh, you pulled on your stretchy denim shorts and a vest top, before running a brush through your hair. Insecurities about your figure filled your mind. Yes, you&rsquo;d had a baby a month ago and were in some of your pre pregnancy clothes, but the way your body looked underneath them was something you loathed.</p><p>You thought back to the pictures of Harry with that girl, a tall leggy blonde with a ridiculous thigh gap. You&rsquo;d told yourself many times to never look at them again and you hadn&rsquo;t, but they were still embedded in your mind. How many times were they together when you and Harry were still a couple? Had he brought her to his house? When did it end? This was going to be a difficult conversation to have with him, but you knew you needed answers, otherwise you&rsquo;d always be wondering.</p><p>The buzzer to your flat went at noon and Harry was stood there with a small bag in his hand. &ldquo;Brought some things to make us lunch.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s ok?&rdquo; he quickly added, seeing your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, thanks.&rdquo; You said, turning your back to him and walking him the hallway.</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything ok?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; You replied and Harry raised his eyebrows at you. You knew that look; he didn&rsquo;t believe you at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been thinking about some stuff that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thinking about what? Anything I can help with?&rdquo; He asked as unpacked the bag. He&rsquo;d brought over bread rolls, salad, various sandwich fillers and fruits.</p><p>&ldquo;Did she stay at your house?&rdquo; You asked him suddenly.</p><!-- more --><p>He stopped what he was doing and looked up at you. He paused for a second before answering.</p><p>&ldquo;No, she didnt. Neither here or LA.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>His answer was sincere and you believed him.</p><p>&quot;We only met up twice in L.A. when we were still um&hellip;&hellip;together&hellip;&hellip;..we just kissed. Nothing more.&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Oh.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;I met her once when we broke up and once again we just kissed. I didn&rsquo;t want anything more from her. I&rsquo;ve um &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. Not been with anyone since you.&rdquo; He said nervously.</p><p>He looked over and you knew he could see your mind ticking over.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Is It over with her?&ldquo; You asked him nervously.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Yes&hellip;&hellip;.I&rsquo;ve not seen her in months and I don&rsquo;t intend to. I only want you, it&rsquo;s always been you.&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0You nodded and leant down to unload the washing machine.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m not the same as I &hellip;&hellip;.. as I was.&ldquo; You mumbled.</p><p>Silence filled the room.</p><p>He came over to you, picking up the basket from the floor and placing it on the kitchen counter.</p><p>&quot;What do you mean?&rdquo; He asked, his eyebrows furrowed with confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Mum now, my priorities aren&rsquo;t the same. I&rsquo;ve not been out in months, no one calls me anymore, I&rsquo;m not much fun anymore. And um&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.My body isn&rsquo;t the same.&rdquo; You said, wrapping your arms around your waist.</p><p>He moved closer and his hands fell on your hips, but you didn&rsquo;t look up at him. Bringing one of his hands up he used his fingers to guide your face up to his.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Don&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&ldquo; He whispered. &quot;Don&rsquo;t ever speak like that about yourself&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;ever. You understand?\u00a0You spent 9 months growing our son, that&rsquo;s an amazing thing to be able to do. And your body might not be the same, but it is still beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>His hand that was still on your hip began to move up your vest top till his fingers touched your bare skin. You shivered at his touch, his eyes never left yours as he knelt down in front of you. Moving your top up over your hips, he exposed your stomach, it was no longer flat like the last time he had seen it and it had a few faint red marks running vertically across it. Not many, but enough to cause you to be resentful of them. He moved his head forward and kissed across each one, his soft lips meeting your skin causing you to inhale deeply and run your fingers through hair.</p><p>Tears ran freely down your cheeks as Harry continued to kiss your stomach - a small sob escaped your lips and he looked up at you. A frown appeared on his face as he stood up and brushed your hair out of your face.\u00a0</p><p>Cupping your cheeks he paused, searching your eyes for permission before he leaned forward and brought his lips to yours. You melted into his arms, the sobs being replaced with soft moans; you&rsquo;d missed his touch so much. He didn&rsquo;t let up with the kiss, and he pushed himself against you as you stood with your back to the kitchen counter, his tongue seeking entrance to your mouth. Moving his hands away from your face to your hands, he moved them so you could wrap your arms around his neck.\u00a0</p><p>He squeezed at your hips, moving his hands down to squeeze at your bum, you kissed him deeper, hands running through his hair at the nape of his neck. It felt so good to be with him again, so good to feel his lips against yours.</p><p>You both pulled away breathless and he looked at you with a determined face.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Please&hellip;&hellip;.. Please&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Don&rsquo;t ever let me hear you say anything like that about yourself again.&ldquo;</p><p>You nodded and he wrapped you up in a hug, holding you close as kissed the top of your head.</p><p>&quot;Um&hellip;&hellip;we should probably eat now, Jacob is due a feed in an hour.&rdquo; You said as you wiped away your tears with a tissue from the box on the side.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure&hellip;&hellip;.um I got some crusty bread and some of that chicken pasta you love so much.&rdquo; he replied easing the thick tension that was the in the air.</p><p>You smiled at the fact that he still remembered what you liked after all this time. To be honest, it actually wasn&rsquo;t that long ago. You&rsquo;d been about four weeks pregnant when you broke up so it was only 9 months since you&rsquo;d been together.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, so how was your day yesterday?&rdquo; You asked trying to lighten the mood in the room. Harry hadn&rsquo;t come to see you both yesterday as he had a photo shoot in Manchester.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Busy, 14 hour day of changing clothes and posing constantly!&rdquo; He laughed.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your schedule like for the next few months?&rdquo; You asked, as you began to sort through the washing.</p><p>&ldquo;On a break - well sort of. Got a few photo shoots to do, couple of interviews that sort of thing. Then, possibly try to write here or in L.A.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good, especially after a long tour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be too busy for you both, I meant it when I said you would always be my priority.&rdquo; He said, and you looked up from where you hanging the washing on the clothes airer.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I believed you. I wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.I just wondered if we&rsquo;d keep being able to see you this often.&rdquo;</p><p>Since you&rsquo;d stumbled across each other in the supermarket Saturday afternoon, you&rsquo;d seen him everyday apart from yesterday. He&rsquo;d been over by lunchtime or early afternoon and you&rsquo;d spent time just chilling with eachother: watching films, cooking, playing board games and cards. It had been good to be in his company again. The kiss you&rsquo;d just shared had been the first time since you&rsquo;d broken up&hellip;.. and another step forward.\u00a0</p><p>You&rsquo;d shown him how to change Jacobs nappy, bathe him and he&rsquo;d quickly learnt how Jacob liked to be cradled close to your chest. The rhythm of your heartbeat soothing him. Seems Harry&rsquo;s heartbeat worked just as well, like Jacob knew who his Daddy was.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you travel with me to L.A.?&rdquo; He suddenly said. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a long flight, but I&rsquo;d like you both to be with me when I go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, if we are not going to be in the way&hellip;&hellip;I mean we could come, I suppose. Jacob has some immunizations he has to have over the next few months so as long as they don&rsquo;t effect them&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Then yeah.&rdquo; You rambled.</p><p>&ldquo;Was it ok that I kissed you just then?&rdquo; He asked, not looking up from the sandwiches he was preparing.</p><p>You ran your tongue across your lips and you could still taste him.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t stop you, did I?&rdquo; You smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you didnt. &rdquo; He smirked, his cute dimples showing.\u00a0</p><p>Jacob woke after you&rsquo;d finished your lunch, and Harry took the empty dishes to the sink and began washing them whilst you fed him.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;So, about tomorrow&hellip;&hellip;..are you ok with me picking you up or do you want to drive and meet me there? &rdquo; he asked, as he sat back down next to you on the sofa.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a car, I was just going to get the tube.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened to your car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I hardly used it, so just sold it.&rdquo; You replied not looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hardly used it?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yea, didn&rsquo;t see the point in keeping it. I put the money towards other things.&rdquo;</p><p>The realisation of what you said sank in, and you could tell from his face that he knew what you&rsquo;d done. You hadn&rsquo;t said it to make him feel guilty, but he knew how much you loved the freedom of having a car and how much you hated the tube.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you sell your car to buy stuff for Jacob?!&rdquo; He asked as he placed his head in his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Um yeah&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.and a deposit for here, and um &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; you know a moses basket, pushchair, sofa. I didn&rsquo;t have anything but bedroom stuff when I left Rachel&rsquo;s. I didn&rsquo;t even have one saucepan!&rdquo; You laughed, but Harry looked infuriated.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come to me. I can&rsquo;t believe you were struggling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t struggling! I had the money - it was just tied up in the car. I don&rsquo;t need it, I can use the tube.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could get shoved about if its busy on the tube! It&rsquo;s too risky with Jacob in his carrier. I&rsquo;ll get you a car.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No you wont!&rdquo; You replied firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Fliss, please&hellip;&hellip;.?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, honestly it&rsquo;s fine. Ok?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head and you knew it wasn&rsquo;t fine to him.</p><hr><p>Jacob was snoozing against Harry&rsquo;s chest for most of the afternoon, snuggled up on his tummy, his head tucked into the crook of Harry&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know how you get anything done.&rdquo; Harry said smiling. &ldquo;I could lie here cuddling him forever.&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Can I take a photo? You both look cute.&ldquo;</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Yeah, of course. Send it to me when you&rsquo;ve taken it, please.&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Sure.&ldquo; You replied as you got your phone and took the picture.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"198\" data-orig-height=\"222\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec0f63a6459f66ccb86867585da301a2/tumblr_inline_pf1kdo9NmR1vq615k_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"198\" data-orig-height=\"222\"/></figure><p>&quot;Do you and Jacob maybe want to stay at mine for a few days since Mum is coming down? I can set you both up in one the spare rooms - I don&rsquo;t want to rush anything. One step at a time yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Yeah, that would be nice, your Mum would get to spend some quality time with him then.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;And you to. She&rsquo;s excited to see you as well.&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Is she?&ldquo; You asked nervously.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Yeah of course, shes not angry.

He paused for a second before answering.</p><p>\u201cNo, she didnt. Neither here or LA.\"\u00a0</p><p>His answer was sincere and you believed him.</p><p>\"We only met up twice in L.A. when we were still um\u2026\u2026together\u2026\u2026..we just kissed. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\"Oh.\u201c</p><p>\"I met her once when we broke up and once again we just kissed. I didn\u2019t want anything more from her. I\u2019ve um \u2026\u2026\u2026. Not been with anyone since you.\u201d He said nervously.</p><p>He looked over and you knew he could see your mind ticking over.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\"Is It over with her?\u201c You asked him nervously.</p><p>\u00a0\"Yes\u2026\u2026.I\u2019ve not seen her in months and I don\u2019t intend to. I only want you, it\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0You nodded and leant down to unload the washing machine.</p><p>\u00a0\"I\u2019m not the same as I \u2026\u2026.. as I was.\u201c You mumbled.</p><p>Silence filled the room.</p><p>He came over to you, picking up the basket from the floor and placing it on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\u201d He asked, his eyebrows furrowed with confusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Mum now, my priorities aren\u2019t the same. I\u2019ve not been out in months, no one calls me anymore, I\u2019m not much fun anymore. And um\u2026\u2026\u2026.My body isn\u2019t the same.\u201d You said, wrapping your arms around your waist.</p><p>He moved closer and his hands fell on your hips, but you didn\u2019t look up at him. Bringing one of his hands up he used his fingers to guide your face up to his.</p><p>\u00a0\"Don\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201c He whispered. \"Don\u2019t ever speak like that about yourself\u2026\u2026\u2026ever. You understand?\u00a0You spent 9 months growing our son, that\u2019s an amazing thing to be able to do. And your body might not be the same, but it is still beautiful.\u201d</p><p>His hand that was still on your hip began to move up your vest top till his fingers touched your bare skin. You shivered at his touch, his eyes never left yours as he knelt down in front of you. Moving your top up over your hips, he exposed your stomach, it was no longer flat like the last time he had seen it and it had a few faint red marks running vertically across it. Not many, but enough to cause you to be resentful of them. He moved his head forward and kissed across each one, his soft lips meeting your skin causing you to inhale deeply and run your fingers through hair.</p><p>Tears ran freely down your cheeks as Harry continued to kiss your stomach - a small sob escaped your lips and he looked up at you. A frown appeared on his face as he stood up and brushed your hair out of your face.\u00a0</p><p>Cupping your cheeks he paused, searching your eyes for permission before he leaned forward and brought his lips to yours. You melted into his arms, the sobs being replaced with soft moans; you\u2019d missed his touch so much. He didn\u2019t let up with the kiss, and he pushed himself against you as you stood with your back to the kitchen counter, his tongue seeking entrance to your mouth. Moving his hands away from your face to your hands, he moved them so you could wrap your arms around his neck.\u00a0</p><p>He squeezed at your hips, moving his hands down to squeeze at your bum, you kissed him deeper, hands running through his hair at the nape of his neck. It felt so good to be with him again, so good to feel his lips against yours.</p><p>You both pulled away breathless and he looked at you with a determined face.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\"Please\u2026\u2026.. Please\u2026\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t ever let me hear you say anything like that about yourself again.\u201c</p><p>You nodded and he wrapped you up in a hug, holding you close as kissed the top of your head.</p><p>\"Um\u2026\u2026we should probably eat now, Jacob is due a feed in an hour.\u201d You said as you wiped away your tears with a tissue from the box on the side.</p><p>\u201cSure\u2026\u2026.um I got some crusty bread and some of that chicken pasta you love so much.\u201d he replied easing the thick tension that was the in the air.</p><p>You smiled at the fact that he still remembered what you liked after all this time. To be honest, it actually wasn\u2019t that long ago. You\u2019d been about four weeks pregnant when you broke up so it was only 9 months since you\u2019d been together.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks, so how was your day yesterday?\u201d You asked trying to lighten the mood in the room. Harry hadn\u2019t come to see you both yesterday as he had a photo shoot in Manchester.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBusy, 14 hour day of changing clothes and posing constantly!\u201d He laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your schedule like for the next few months?\u201d You asked, as you began to sort through the washing.</p><p>\u201cOn a break - well sort of. Got a few photo shoots to do, couple of interviews that sort of thing. Then, possibly try to write here or in L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good, especially after a long tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be too busy for you both, I meant it when I said you would always be my priority.\u201d He said, and you looked up from where you hanging the washing on the clothes airer.</p><p>\u201cI know. I believed you. I wasn\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u2026.I just wondered if we\u2019d keep being able to see you this often.\u201d</p><p>Since you\u2019d stumbled across each other in the supermarket Saturday afternoon, you\u2019d seen him everyday apart from yesterday. He\u2019d been over by lunchtime or early afternoon and you\u2019d spent time just chilling with eachother: watching films, cooking, playing board games and cards. It had been good to be in his company again. The kiss you\u2019d just shared had been the first time since you\u2019d broken up\u2026.. and another step forward.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d shown him how to change Jacobs nappy, bathe him and he\u2019d quickly learnt how Jacob liked to be cradled close to your chest. The rhythm of your heartbeat soothing him. Seems Harry\u2019s heartbeat worked just as well, like Jacob knew who his Daddy was.</p><p>\u201cWould you travel with me to L.A.?\u201d He suddenly said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a long flight, but I\u2019d like you both to be with me when I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, if we are not going to be in the way\u2026\u2026I mean we could come, I suppose. Jacob has some immunizations he has to have over the next few months so as long as they don\u2019t effect them\u2026\u2026\u2026 Then yeah.\u201d You rambled.</p><p>\u201cWas it ok that I kissed you just then?\u201d He asked, not looking up from the sandwiches he was preparing.</p><p>You ran your tongue across your lips and you could still taste him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stop you, did I?\u201d You smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didnt. \u201d He smirked, his cute dimples showing.\u00a0</p><p>Jacob woke after you\u2019d finished your lunch, and Harry took the empty dishes to the sink and began washing them whilst you fed him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, about tomorrow\u2026\u2026..are you ok with me picking you up or do you want to drive and meet me there? \u201d he asked, as he sat back down next to you on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a car, I was just going to get the tube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I hardly used it, so just sold it.\u201d You replied not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cHardly used it?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea, didn\u2019t see the point in keeping it. I put the money towards other things.\u201d</p><p>The realisation of what you said sank in, and you could tell from his face that he knew what you\u2019d done. You hadn\u2019t said it to make him feel guilty, but he knew how much you loved the freedom of having a car and how much you hated the tube.</p><p>\u201cDid you sell your car to buy stuff for Jacob?!\u201d He asked as he placed his head in his hands.</p><p>\u201cUm yeah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.and a deposit for here, and um \u2026\u2026\u2026 you know a moses basket, pushchair, sofa. I didn\u2019t have anything but bedroom stuff when I left Rachel\u2019s. I didn\u2019t even have one saucepan!\u201d You laughed, but Harry looked infuriated.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d come to me. I can\u2019t believe you were struggling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t struggling! I had the money - it was just tied up in the car. I don\u2019t need it, I can use the tube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could get shoved about if its busy on the tube! It\u2019s too risky with Jacob in his carrier. I\u2019ll get you a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you wont!\u201d You replied firmly.</p><p>\u201cFliss, please\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, honestly it\u2019s fine. Ok?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and you knew it wasn\u2019t fine to him.</p><hr><p>Jacob was snoozing against Harry\u2019s chest for most of the afternoon, snuggled up on his tummy, his head tucked into the crook of Harry\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how you get anything done.\u201d Harry said smiling. \u201cI could lie here cuddling him forever.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\"Can I take a photo? You both look cute.\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\"Yeah, of course. Send it to me when you\u2019ve taken it, please.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\"Sure.\u201c You replied as you got your phone and took the picture.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"198\" data-orig-height=\"222\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec0f63a6459f66ccb86867585da301a2/tumblr_inline_pf1kdo9NmR1vq615k_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"198\" data-orig-height=\"222\"></figure><p>\"Do you and Jacob maybe want to stay at mine for a few days since Mum is coming down?

She\u2019s excited to see you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\"Is she?\u201c You asked nervously.</p><p>\u00a0\"Yeah of course, shes not angry.

Jacob was happily snoozing in his moses basket as you flicked through the rack of clothes. Looking down at yourself in the mirror, you could see your tummy was not as flat as it used to be, it had a few stretch marks on it to.\u00a0</p><p>Letting out a sigh, you pulled on your stretchy denim shorts and a vest top, before running a brush through your hair. Insecurities about your figure filled your mind. Yes, you\u2019d had a baby a month ago and were in some of your pre pregnancy clothes, but the way your body looked underneath them was something you loathed.</p><p>You thought back to the pictures of Harry with that girl, a tall leggy blonde with a ridiculous thigh gap. You\u2019d told yourself many times to never look at them again and you hadn\u2019t, but they were still embedded in your mind. How many times were they together when you and Harry were still a couple? Had he brought her to his house? When did it end? This was going to be a difficult conversation to have with him, but you knew you needed answers, otherwise you\u2019d always be wondering.</p><p>The buzzer to your flat went at noon and Harry was stood there with a small bag in his hand. \u201cBrought some things to make us lunch.\u201d He said. \u201cIf that\u2019s ok?\u201d he quickly added, seeing your face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d You said, turning your back to him and walking him the hallway.</p><p>\u201cIs everything ok?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d You replied and Harry raised his eyebrows at you. You knew that look; he didn\u2019t believe you at all.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been thinking about some stuff that\u2019s all. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking about what? Anything I can help with?\u201d He asked as unpacked the bag. He\u2019d brought over bread rolls, salad, various sandwich fillers and fruits.</p><p>\u201cDid she stay at your house?\u201d You asked him suddenly.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He stopped what he was doing and looked up at you. He paused for a second before answering.</p><p>\u201cNo, she didnt. Neither here or LA.\"\u00a0</p><p>His answer was sincere and you believed him.</p><p>\"We only met up twice in L.A. when we were still um\u2026\u2026together\u2026\u2026..we just kissed. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\"Oh.\u201c</p><p>\"I met her once when we broke up and once again we just kissed. I didn\u2019t want anything more from her. I\u2019ve um \u2026\u2026\u2026. Not been with anyone since you.\u201d He said nervously.</p><p>He looked over and you knew he could see your mind ticking over.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\"Is It over with her?\u201c You asked him nervously.</p><p>\u00a0\"Yes\u2026\u2026.I\u2019ve not seen her in months and I don\u2019t intend to. I only want you, it\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0You nodded and leant down to unload the washing machine.</p><p>\u00a0\"I\u2019m not the same as I \u2026\u2026.. as I was.\u201c You mumbled.</p><p>Silence filled the room.</p><p>He came over to you, picking up the basket from the floor and placing it on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\u201d He asked, his eyebrows furrowed with confusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Mum now, my priorities aren\u2019t the same. I\u2019ve not been out in months, no one calls me anymore, I\u2019m not much fun anymore. And um\u2026\u2026\u2026.My body isn\u2019t the same.\u201d You said, wrapping your arms around your waist.</p><p>He moved closer and his hands fell on your hips, but you didn\u2019t look up at him. Bringing one of his hands up he used his fingers to guide your face up to his.</p><p>\u00a0\"Don\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201c He whispered. \"Don\u2019t ever speak like that about yourself\u2026\u2026\u2026ever. You understand?\u00a0You spent 9 months growing our son, that\u2019s an amazing thing to be able to do. And your body might not be the same, but it is still beautiful.\u201d</p><p>His hand that was still on your hip began to move up your vest top till his fingers touched your bare skin. You shivered at his touch, his eyes never left yours as he knelt down in front of you. Moving your top up over your hips, he exposed your stomach, it was no longer flat like the last time he had seen it and it had a few faint red marks running vertically across it. Not many, but enough to cause you to be resentful of them. He moved his head forward and kissed across each one, his soft lips meeting your skin causing you to inhale deeply and run your fingers through hair.</p><p>Tears ran freely down your cheeks as Harry continued to kiss your stomach - a small sob escaped your lips and he looked up at you. A frown appeared on his face as he stood up and brushed your hair out of your face.\u00a0</p><p>Cupping your cheeks he paused, searching your eyes for permission before he leaned forward and brought his lips to yours. You melted into his arms, the sobs being replaced with soft moans; you\u2019d missed his touch so much. He didn\u2019t let up with the kiss, and he pushed himself against you as you stood with your back to the kitchen counter, his tongue seeking entrance to your mouth. Moving his hands away from your face to your hands, he moved them so you could wrap your arms around his neck.\u00a0</p><p>He squeezed at your hips, moving his hands down to squeeze at your bum, you kissed him deeper, hands running through his hair at the nape of his neck. It felt so good to be with him again, so good to feel his lips against yours.</p><p>You both pulled away breathless and he looked at you with a determined face.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\"Please\u2026\u2026.. Please\u2026\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t ever let me hear you say anything like that about yourself again.\u201c</p><p>You nodded and he wrapped you up in a hug, holding you close as kissed the top of your head.</p><p>\"Um\u2026\u2026we should probably eat now, Jacob is due a feed in an hour.\u201d You said as you wiped away your tears with a tissue from the box on the side.</p><p>\u201cSure\u2026\u2026.um I got some crusty bread and some of that chicken pasta you love so much.\u201d he replied easing the thick tension that was the in the air.</p><p>You smiled at the fact that he still remembered what you liked after all this time. To be honest, it actually wasn\u2019t that long ago. You\u2019d been about four weeks pregnant when you broke up so it was only 9 months since you\u2019d been together.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks, so how was your day yesterday?\u201d You asked trying to lighten the mood in the room. Harry hadn\u2019t come to see you both yesterday as he had a photo shoot in Manchester.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBusy, 14 hour day of changing clothes and posing constantly!\u201d He laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your schedule like for the next few months?\u201d You asked, as you began to sort through the washing.</p><p>\u201cOn a break - well sort of. Got a few photo shoots to do, couple of interviews that sort of thing. Then, possibly try to write here or in L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good, especially after a long tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be too busy for you both, I meant it when I said you would always be my priority.\u201d He said, and you looked up from where you hanging the washing on the clothes airer.</p><p>\u201cI know. I believed you. I wasn\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u2026.I just wondered if we\u2019d keep being able to see you this often.\u201d</p><p>Since you\u2019d stumbled across each other in the supermarket Saturday afternoon, you\u2019d seen him everyday apart from yesterday. He\u2019d been over by lunchtime or early afternoon and you\u2019d spent time just chilling with eachother: watching films, cooking, playing board games and cards. It had been good to be in his company again. The kiss you\u2019d just shared had been the first time since you\u2019d broken up\u2026.. and another step forward.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d shown him how to change Jacobs nappy, bathe him and he\u2019d quickly learnt how Jacob liked to be cradled close to your chest. The rhythm of your heartbeat soothing him. Seems Harry\u2019s heartbeat worked just as well, like Jacob knew who his Daddy was.</p><p>\u201cWould you travel with me to L.A.?\u201d He suddenly said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a long flight, but I\u2019d like you both to be with me when I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, if we are not going to be in the way\u2026\u2026I mean we could come, I suppose. Jacob has some immunizations he has to have over the next few months so as long as they don\u2019t effect them\u2026\u2026\u2026 Then yeah.\u201d You rambled.</p><p>\u201cWas it ok that I kissed you just then?\u201d He asked, not looking up from the sandwiches he was preparing.</p><p>You ran your tongue across your lips and you could still taste him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stop you, did I?\u201d You smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didnt. \u201d He smirked, his cute dimples showing.\u00a0</p><p>Jacob woke after you\u2019d finished your lunch, and Harry took the empty dishes to the sink and began washing them whilst you fed him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, about tomorrow\u2026\u2026..are you ok with me picking you up or do you want to drive and meet me there? \u201d he asked, as he sat back down next to you on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a car, I was just going to get the tube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I hardly used it, so just sold it.\u201d You replied not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cHardly used it?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea, didn\u2019t see the point in keeping it. I put the money towards other things.\u201d</p><p>The realisation of what you said sank in, and you could tell from his face that he knew what you\u2019d done. You hadn\u2019t said it to make him feel guilty, but he knew how much you loved the freedom of having a car and how much you hated the tube.</p><p>\u201cDid you sell your car to buy stuff for Jacob?!\u201d He asked as he placed his head in his hands.</p><p>\u201cUm yeah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.and a deposit for here, and um \u2026\u2026\u2026 you know a moses basket, pushchair, sofa. I didn\u2019t have anything but bedroom stuff when I left Rachel\u2019s. I didn\u2019t even have one saucepan!\u201d You laughed, but Harry looked infuriated.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d come to me. I can\u2019t believe you were struggling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t struggling! I had the money - it was just tied up in the car. I don\u2019t need it, I can use the tube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could get shoved about if its busy on the tube! It\u2019s too risky with Jacob in his carrier. I\u2019ll get you a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you wont!\u201d You replied firmly.</p><p>\u201cFliss, please\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, honestly it\u2019s fine. Ok?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and you knew it wasn\u2019t fine to him.</p><hr><p>Jacob was snoozing against Harry\u2019s chest for most of the afternoon, snuggled up on his tummy, his head tucked into the crook of Harry\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how you get anything done.\u201d Harry said smiling. \u201cI could lie here cuddling him forever.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\"Can I take a photo? You both look cute.\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\"Yeah, of course. Send it to me when you\u2019ve taken it, please.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\"Sure.\u201c You replied as you got your phone and took the picture.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"198\" data-orig-height=\"222\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec0f63a6459f66ccb86867585da301a2/tumblr_inline_pf1kdo9NmR1vq615k_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"198\" data-orig-height=\"222\"></figure><p>\"Do you and Jacob maybe want to stay at mine for a few days since Mum is coming down? I can set you both up in one the spare rooms - I don\u2019t want to rush anything. One step at a time yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\"Yeah, that would be nice, your Mum would get to spend some quality time with him then.\u201c</p><p>\"And you to. She\u2019s excited to see you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\"Is she?\u201c You asked nervously.</p><p>\u00a0\"Yeah of course, shes not angry. Are you worried about seeing her still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit.\u201d You admitted.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t be.\u201d</p><hr><p>Harry helped you load the overnight bags and Jacobs moses basket into the boot of his Audi, before you showed him how to put Jacobs car seat in safely. After locking up your flat, you sat in the front passenger seat and put on your seat belt.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d He asked, a massive smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026 What\u2019s with the look?!\u201d You smiled back.</p><p>\u201cJust pleased to be bringing you both to mine, that\u2019s all. I hope it can be something we do a lot or for permanent.\u201d</p><p>You could feel the blush rise in your cheeks and Harry reached over and took your hand in his, bringing it up to his lips to place a soft kiss across your knuckles.</p><p>Pulling up outside Harry\u2019s, you waited until the gates closed behind you before getting out of the car. You didn\u2019t want yourself or Jacob to be seen going into his house. The news of Jacobs arrival was bound to come out sooner or later, but you wanted to protect your privacy for as long as you could.</p><p>It felt strange walking into Harry\u2019s house, nothing had changed in the months you\u2019d been apart. Harry had been touring for months on end, so he hadn\u2019t even been home much. The sofa still had the cream cushions you\u2019d picked out for him and the coffee table still had the candles that you\u2019d once lit. You stopped next to the side board in the living room and saw that it was still filled with the pictures of you both. Why did he still have these out?</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026um\u2026\u2026\u2026.never put them away.\u201d He said softly, as if he had read your thoughts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis was a great trip, wasn\u2019t it? \u201d you replied, pointing to the picture of you both in Barcelona. You\u2019d managed to spend three days there without the press finding out. Some fans had spotted you but had been really respectful and not posted pictures online of him so you could enjoy the trip. Fans had always been really kind to you, and had actually been speculating recently about whether you were still together as you hadn\u2019t been seen in months.</p><p>\u201cIt was, can\u2019t wait to show Jacob the world.\u201d He replied, and you felt your heart swell.</p><p>\u00a0\"Speaking of Jacob, he will probably need a feed soon.\u201c You said checking your watch.</p><p>\"That boy loves a bit of boobie time doesn\u2019t he?!\u201d Harry laughed, as he walked over to your bags.</p><p>\u201cJust like his father!\u201d You muttered under your breath, a smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not denying it!\u201d He said as he picked up your stuff and headed towards the stairs. \u201cAlways loved your boobs!\"\u00a0</p><p>For the last 5 days you\u2019d both been flirting with each other a bit, conscious though that you\u2019d been apart from each other a while, and that you needed to take little steps. What you really wanted to do was kiss him again. Since that kiss four hours ago, you\u2019d wanted nothing more than to do it again. You suspected maybe he wanted it to happen again to.</p><p>part three</p><p><a href=\"https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/183511843318/light-of-my-life-part-three\">https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/183511843318/light-of-my-life-part-three</a><br></p></p>",

I wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.I just wondered if we&rsquo;d keep being able to see you this often.&rdquo;</p><p>Since you&rsquo;d stumbled across each other in the supermarket Saturday afternoon, you&rsquo;d seen him everyday apart from yesterday. He&rsquo;d been over by lunchtime or early afternoon and you&rsquo;d spent time just chilling with eachother: watching films, cooking, playing board games and cards. It had been good to be in his company again. The kiss you&rsquo;d just shared had been the first time since you&rsquo;d broken up&hellip;.. and another step forward.&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;d shown him how to change Jacobs nappy, bathe him and he&rsquo;d quickly learnt how Jacob liked to be cradled close to your chest. The rhythm of your heartbeat soothing him. Seems Harry&rsquo;s heartbeat worked just as well, like Jacob knew who his Daddy was.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you travel with me to L.A.?&rdquo; He suddenly said. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a long flight, but I&rsquo;d like you both to be with me when I go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, if we are not going to be in the way&hellip;&hellip;I mean we could come, I suppose. Jacob has some immunizations he has to have over the next few months so as long as they don&rsquo;t effect them&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Then yeah.&rdquo; You rambled.</p><p>&ldquo;Was it ok that I kissed you just then?&rdquo; He asked, not looking up from the sandwiches he was preparing.</p><p>You ran your tongue across your lips and you could still taste him.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t stop you, did I?&rdquo; You smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you didnt. &rdquo; He smirked, his cute dimples showing.&nbsp;</p><p>Jacob woke after you&rsquo;d finished your lunch, and Harry took the empty dishes to the sink and began washing them whilst you fed him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So, about tomorrow&hellip;&hellip;..are you ok with me picking you up or do you want to drive and meet me there? &rdquo; he asked, as he sat back down next to you on the sofa.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a car, I was just going to get the tube.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened to your car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I hardly used it, so just sold it.&rdquo; You replied not looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hardly used it?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yea, didn&rsquo;t see the point in keeping it. I put the money towards other things.&rdquo;</p><p>The realisation of what you said sank in, and you could tell from his face that he knew what you&rsquo;d done. You hadn&rsquo;t said it to make him feel guilty, but he knew how much you loved the freedom of having a car and how much you hated the tube.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you sell your car to buy stuff for Jacob?!&rdquo; He asked as he placed his head in his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Um yeah&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.and a deposit for here, and um &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; you know a moses basket, pushchair, sofa. I didn&rsquo;t have anything but bedroom stuff when I left Rachel&rsquo;s. I didn&rsquo;t even have one saucepan!&rdquo; You laughed, but Harry looked infuriated.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come to me. I can&rsquo;t believe you were struggling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t struggling! I had the money - it was just tied up in the car. I don&rsquo;t need it, I can use the tube.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could get shoved about if its busy on the tube! It&rsquo;s too risky with Jacob in his carrier. I&rsquo;ll get you a car.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No you wont!&rdquo; You replied firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Fliss, please&hellip;&hellip;.?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, honestly it&rsquo;s fine. Ok?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head and you knew it wasn&rsquo;t fine to him.</p><hr /><p>Jacob was snoozing against Harry&rsquo;s chest for most of the afternoon, snuggled up on his tummy, his head tucked into the crook of Harry&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know how you get anything done.&rdquo; Harry said smiling. &ldquo;I could lie here cuddling him forever.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;\"Can I take a photo? You both look cute.&ldquo;</p><p>&nbsp;\"Yeah, of course. Send it to me when you&rsquo;ve taken it, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;\"Sure.&ldquo; You replied as you got your phone and took the picture.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec0f63a6459f66ccb86867585da301a2/tumblr_inline_pf1kdo9NmR1vq615k_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\"Do you and Jacob maybe want to stay at mine for a few days since Mum is coming down? I can set you both up in one the spare rooms - I don&rsquo;t want to rush anything. One step at a time yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;\"Yeah, that would be nice, your Mum would get to spend some quality time with him then.&ldquo;</p><p>\"And you to. She&rsquo;s excited to see you as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;\"Is she?&ldquo; You asked nervously.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Yeah of course, shes not angry. Are you worried about seeing her still?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A little bit.&rdquo; You admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Harry helped you load the overnight bags and Jacobs moses basket into the boot of his Audi, before you showed him how to put Jacobs car seat in safely. After locking up your flat, you sat in the front passenger seat and put on your seat belt.</p><p>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; He asked, a massive smirk on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&hellip; What&rsquo;s with the look?!&rdquo; You smiled back.</p><p>&ldquo;Just pleased to be bringing you both to mine, that&rsquo;s all. I hope it can be something we do a lot or for permanent.&rdquo;</p><p>You could feel the blush rise in your cheeks and Harry reached over and took your hand in his, bringing it up to his lips to place a soft kiss across your knuckles.</p><p>Pulling up outside Harry&rsquo;s, you waited until the gates closed behind you before getting out of the car. You didn&rsquo;t want yourself or Jacob to be seen going into his house. The news of Jacobs arrival was bound to come out sooner or later, but you wanted to protect your privacy for as long as you could.</p><p>It felt strange walking into Harry&rsquo;s house, nothing had changed in the months you&rsquo;d been apart. Harry had been touring for months on end, so he hadn&rsquo;t even been home much. The sofa still had the cream cushions you&rsquo;d picked out for him and the coffee table still had the candles that you&rsquo;d once lit. You stopped next to the side board in the living room and saw that it was still filled with the pictures of you both. Why did he still have these out?</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&hellip;um&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.never put them away.&rdquo; He said softly, as if he had read your thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This was a great trip, wasn&rsquo;t it? &rdquo; you replied, pointing to the picture of you both in Barcelona. You&rsquo;d managed to spend three days there without the press finding out. Some fans had spotted you but had been really respectful and not posted pictures online of him so you could enjoy the trip. Fans had always been really kind to you, and had actually been speculating recently about whether you were still together as you hadn&rsquo;t been seen in months.</p><p>&ldquo;It was, can&rsquo;t wait to show Jacob the world.&rdquo; He replied, and you felt your heart swell.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Speaking of Jacob, he will probably need a feed soon.&ldquo; You said checking your watch.</p><p>\"That boy loves a bit of boobie time doesn&rsquo;t he?!&rdquo; Harry laughed, as he walked over to your bags.</p><p>&ldquo;Just like his father!&rdquo; You muttered under your breath, a smile on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not denying it!&rdquo; He said as he picked up your stuff and headed towards the stairs. &ldquo;Always loved your boobs!\"&nbsp;</p><p>For the last 5 days you&rsquo;d both been flirting with each other a bit, conscious though that you&rsquo;d been apart from each other a while, and that you needed to take little steps. What you really wanted to do was kiss him again. Since that kiss four hours ago, you&rsquo;d wanted nothing more than to do it again. You suspected maybe he wanted it to happen again to.</p><p>part three</p><p><a href=\"https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/183511843318/light-of-my-life-part-three\">https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/183511843318/light-of-my-life-part-three</a><br /></p></p>",

Jacob was happily snoozing in his moses basket as you flicked through the rack of clothes. Looking down at yourself in the mirror, you could see your tummy was not as flat as it used to be, it had a few stretch marks on it to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Letting out a sigh, you pulled on your stretchy denim shorts and a vest top, before running a brush through your hair. Insecurities about your figure filled your mind. Yes, you&rsquo;d had a baby a month ago and were in some of your pre pregnancy clothes, but the way your body looked underneath them was something you loathed.</p>\n<p>You thought back to the pictures of Harry with that girl, a tall leggy blonde with a ridiculous thigh gap. You&rsquo;d told yourself many times to never look at them again and you hadn&rsquo;t, but they were still embedded in your mind. How many times were they together when you and Harry were still a couple? Had he brought her to his house? When did it end? This was going to be a difficult conversation to have with him, but you knew you needed answers, otherwise you&rsquo;d always be wondering.</p>\n<p>The buzzer to your flat went at noon and Harry was stood there with a small bag in his hand. &ldquo;Brought some things to make us lunch.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s ok?&rdquo; he quickly added, seeing your face.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, thanks.&rdquo; You said, turning your back to him and walking him the hallway.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is everything ok?&rdquo; He asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; You replied and Harry raised his eyebrows at you. You knew that look; he didn&rsquo;t believe you at all.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been thinking about some stuff that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thinking about what? Anything I can help with?&rdquo; He asked as unpacked the bag. He&rsquo;d brought over bread rolls, salad, various sandwich fillers and fruits.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Did she stay at your house?&rdquo; You asked him suddenly.</p>\n</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Mia <i>loves</i> dropping by to say hi to Harry or to have lunch together. Some days their schedules don\u2019t match up so they go hours without seeing each other, but with the time they have, they make do. His assistant knows Mia well and lets her in whenever she\u2019s there regardless if Harry\u2019s busy or not. Sometimes Mia hangs out in his room when he\u2019s at a meeting or something, just swirling around in her chair, watching the view he has since he\u2019s so many floors up. She finds it mesmerising that he gets to see this everyday.<br/></p><p>She uses his authority as a way of teasing him, often cracking Christian Grey jokes (and Harry really doesn\u2019t like that, so when he complains about it, she pulls out a ruler from his desk and smacks it against the desk hard until he flinches, saying,\u00a0\u201cWell, <i>I\u2019m</i> in charge now, mister.\u201d).</p><p>Sometimes she enters his office quietly when he\u2019s busy working on his laptop and he\u2019s so engrossed into it, he hasn\u2019t heard her slink in. She gently pushes his chair away from the desk and lays herself over his lap so her back touches his thighs and stares at the unflattering angle she gets of him, whispering,\u00a0\u201cHi, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>When it comes to business trips, if they are over the weekend, Harry\u2019ll try to convince Mia to come along if she doesn\u2019t have too much work to do herself. More often than not, she has to refuse because of how swamped she is. Of course he\u2019ll pout and try to bribe her with something like,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll buy you that purse you\u2019ve been trying to get\u201d or\u00a0\u201cMaybe sex feels better in a different city\u201d, but he\u2019ll always back down and respect her when she still refuses.\u00a0</p><p>On the rare occasion that she does come along, it\u2019s fair to say that Harry doesn\u2019t work as well as he would normally. This is because no matter how many boring meetings he\u2019s gone to and no matter how many times he\u2019s met with other executives, the thought of Mia wrapped up in their hotel room bed with nothing on but his shirt and cotton boy shorts with her face all scrunched up and hair a total mess has him in shambles all day. That\u2019s because when Harry\u2019s off working, Mia\u2019s in bed catching up on her sleep, sometimes getting up to take a shower and then settling back into his spare clothes with a book or her Kindle.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s nice when she\u2019s there, of course, but it\u2019s really hard for Harry to focus on his work when he knows she\u2019s going to be at the hotel when he returns, looking all pretty and ready to be loved on.\u00a0</p><p>When Harry has to travel to New York, however, it\u2019s sort of a mess. He only has to go about once every few weeks for 3 or 4 days, but that means being a whole ocean away from his girl. Not to mention the different time zones and he\u2019s unable to talk to her as much as he\u2019d like to. He\u2019s jetlagged and fatigue worn, still managing to work through his stupid meetings and send Mia a goodnight text before he knocks out.\u00a0</p><p>Mia\u2019s not a fan of when he goes either because the feeling of her cold bed leaves her restless and wide awake, and she can\u2019t even turn to Harry to talk to because even though she\u2019s five hours ahead, he\u2019s usually asleep before she is. It\u2019s safe to say that she dreads whenever he leaves her to go to New York, but that just means the reunion is twice as amazing as opposed to when he\u2019s off to some place outside of London. She dreams about the day he returns, hugging him fiercely, with him mumbling against her shoulder,\u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t breathe, darling,\u201d which causes her to clutch him a little tighter.</p><p>So, she doesn\u2019t accompany him on many business trips. However, both situations have their ups and downs, but what matters the most is when they reconnect and make up for time lost.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Mia <i>loves</i> dropping by to say hi to Harry or to have lunch together. Some days their schedules don&rsquo;t match up so they go hours without seeing each other, but with the time they have, they make do. His assistant knows Mia well and lets her in whenever she&rsquo;s there regardless if Harry&rsquo;s busy or not. Sometimes Mia hangs out in his room when he&rsquo;s at a meeting or something, just swirling around in her chair, watching the view he has since he&rsquo;s so many floors up. She finds it mesmerising that he gets to see this everyday.<br /></p><p>She uses his authority as a way of teasing him, often cracking Christian Grey jokes (and Harry really doesn&rsquo;t like that, so when he complains about it, she pulls out a ruler from his desk and smacks it against the desk hard until he flinches, saying,&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> in charge now, mister.&rdquo;).</p><p>Sometimes she enters his office quietly when he&rsquo;s busy working on his laptop and he&rsquo;s so engrossed into it, he hasn&rsquo;t heard her slink in. She gently pushes his chair away from the desk and lays herself over his lap so her back touches his thighs and stares at the unflattering angle she gets of him, whispering,&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>When it comes to business trips, if they are over the weekend, Harry&rsquo;ll try to convince Mia to come along if she doesn&rsquo;t have too much work to do herself. More often than not, she has to refuse because of how swamped she is. Of course he&rsquo;ll pout and try to bribe her with something like,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you that purse you&rsquo;ve been trying to get&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe sex feels better in a different city&rdquo;, but he&rsquo;ll always back down and respect her when she still refuses.&nbsp;</p><p>On the rare occasion that she does come along, it&rsquo;s fair to say that Harry doesn&rsquo;t work as well as he would normally. This is because no matter how many boring meetings he&rsquo;s gone to and no matter how many times he&rsquo;s met with other executives, the thought of Mia wrapped up in their hotel room bed with nothing on but his shirt and cotton boy shorts with her face all scrunched up and hair a total mess has him in shambles all day. That&rsquo;s because when Harry&rsquo;s off working, Mia&rsquo;s in bed catching up on her sleep, sometimes getting up to take a shower and then settling back into his spare clothes with a book or her Kindle.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s nice when she&rsquo;s there, of course, but it&rsquo;s really hard for Harry to focus on his work when he knows she&rsquo;s going to be at the hotel when he returns, looking all pretty and ready to be loved on.&nbsp;</p><p>When Harry has to travel to New York, however, it&rsquo;s sort of a mess. He only has to go about once every few weeks for 3 or 4 days, but that means being a whole ocean away from his girl. Not to mention the different time zones and he&rsquo;s unable to talk to her as much as he&rsquo;d like to. He&rsquo;s jetlagged and fatigue worn, still managing to work through his stupid meetings and send Mia a goodnight text before he knocks out.&nbsp;</p><p>Mia&rsquo;s not a fan of when he goes either because the feeling of her cold bed leaves her restless and wide awake, and she can&rsquo;t even turn to Harry to talk to because even though she&rsquo;s five hours ahead, he&rsquo;s usually asleep before she is.
