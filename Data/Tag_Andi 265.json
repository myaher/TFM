Cyrus springs out of bed and changes into some casual clothes and he was far too frantic to perfectly craft his outfit like he usually would. </p><p>Cyrus makes his way out of the house and even though it\u2019s only 5am, the sun has begun to rise since it\u2019s summer. Cyrus power walks down the street with no real destination in mind but somewhere along the way he becomes set on a single idea and with that crazed thought in mind, Cyrus makes his way to the Shadyside pier. </p><p>Once at the seaside, Cyrus marches down the old wooden pier on a mission. As the end of the pier got closer, Cyrus\u2019 strides became slower and shorter, even with fear and panic beginning to kick in, Cyrus forces himself to the edge. With a deep breath Cyrus leans forward to look at the water bellow. The water was calm, not at all mirroring how Cyrus currently felt. </p><p><i>Do it,</i> Cyrus internally yells at himself, <i>it\u2019s just a little jump&hellip; and then a whole lot of ocean&hellip;\u00a0</i>As Cyrus is leaning forward and staring into the ocean trying to force himself off the pier, his cell slips out of his pocket and splashes into water bellow. </p><p>\u201cNo no no!\u201d Cyrus whines as he watches it sink until it is no longer visible. \u201cJust my stinking luck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you talking to the fish, boy?\u201d A mans voice startles Cyrus and he was lucky he didn\u2019t fall off the edge of the pier when he jumped in fright. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI dropped my phone.\u201d Cyrus says defensively like he was in trouble. When Cyrus turns around he finds the man the voice belonged to. Just shy of the end of the pier was an old man fishing. Cyrus looks at him for a second and then realisation crosses his face, he knew this man. This was the old man Cyrus and TJ had spoken to at the beginning of summer, one half of the elderly couple TJ had asked to pick a number when they were beginning the list.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cI met you briefly at the beginning of summer.\u201d </p><p>The old man looks confused, \u201cI forget things a lot these days, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d Cyrus wears a sympathetic and sad smile, \u201cYou were with your wife of 60 years.\u201d </p><p>This makes the man grin from ear to ear. \u201cWould you like to sit down?\u201d He motions to the space beside him. Cyrus didn&rsquo;t know why but he accepts the mans invitation and very nervously sits himself down, although Cyrus was too frightened to let his feet dangle over the edge so instead he sits a small distance back to be safe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy name is William, what\u2019s yours?\u201d He introduces.</p><p>\u201cCyrus. Nice to officially meet you.\u201d Cyrus smiles politely. </p><p>\u201cWhat seems to be troubling you, Cyrus?\u201d William asks. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long and complicated story,\u201d Cyrus shakes his head, \u201cSo complicated I\u2019m\u00a0not sure I even understand it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got time,\u201d William gently shakes his fishing rod. </p><p>Cyrus is quiet for a second. Was he really going to open up to a complete stranger? Cyrus lets out a loud exhale and figures why not?\u00a0\u201cI think I have feelings for my friend..\u201d Cyrus chooses to be vague.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d William gives Cyrus a questioning look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll signs are pointing that way and I have no idea how it happened.\u201d Cyrus sighs, \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for the good part of a year now and somewhere along the way I \u2018allegedly\u2019,\u201d Cyrus dramatically uses are quotes,\u00a0\u201cdeveloped feelings for hi- them.\u201d </p><p>The old man pauses in thought like he was wracking his memories for something in particular, then he nods with a smile. </p><p>\u201cI remember you now.\u201d William says, \u201cYou and your friend were at the diner, playing with your food.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus laughs, \u201cYeah that&rsquo;s my friend TJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAn this is the same friend you have feelings for?\u201d William questions and Cyrus gives a sheepish nod as he had no idea how the man would react to Cyrus\u2019 feelings being for a boy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t like him back then?\u201d William asks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Cyrus sighs again,\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know I liked him until last night, who knows when these so called feelings developed?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd why are you out here on the pier so early in the morning and not talking to your friend about how you feel?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know how I feel.\u201d Cyrus stresses. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to ruin our friendship.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a good friendship there\u2019s nothing you could say to ruin it.\u201d William says like a wise old man.\u00a0\u201cEven putting feelings out in the open.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s a nice idea but Cyrus knew that unrequited feelings definitely could make things difficult between them. \u201cI want to talk to him but I\u2019m scared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow does being on the pier help that?\u201d William questions.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus quickly summarises the list and how they\u2019ve been working through it all summer. \u201cI came to the pier with the intent to jump off it. This is supposed to be the thing I\u2019m most scared of on the list\u2026 If I could do this maybe I could face what I\u2019m actually afraid of.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhich are your feelings for your friend?\u201d William asks.</p><p>\u201cMy feelings in general.\u201d Cyrus frowns, \u201cEver since I realised I was different I\u2019ve avoided thinking about it. I don\u2019t know what I am.\u201d </p><p>William is quiet for a moment.\u00a0\u201cYou like a boy?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI liked a boy, past tense, but even that was more of a weird infatuation.\u201d Cyrus knits his brows,\u00a0\u201cMy current feelings are to be determined. Maybe I\u2019m just having a break down and TJ is being roped into that&hellip; Not that TJ isn\u2019t likeable, I mean he\u2019s always been so kind and supportive and tall-\u201d Cyrus stops abruptly and shakes his head.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d William chuckles and his old man laugh was comforting to Cyrus in a weird way,\u00a0\u201cAre you worried about liking this boy or what liking two boys means?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d Cyrus shrugs.\u00a0\u201cI guess deep down, I know I\u00a0like boys&hellip; exclusively\u2026\u201d Cyrus says with a squinted expression that makes it sound more like a question he wanted answered.</p><p>\u201cI think they have a word for that, son.\u201d The old man says with a quiet laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so I\u2019m gay,\u201d Cyrus says out loud for the first time ever and it was honestly a such a relief to admit it to himself more than anything, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I like, TJ\u2026\u201d Cyrus folds his arms with a huff and this causes William to laugh again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, son.\u201d William says and for some reason that was extremely comforting to hear, even from a perfect stranger.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus stays with William for over an hour. Cyrus was still too stressed to entertain the idea of liking TJ so he instead asks William about his marriage. Eventually Cyrus parts ways with William, he thanks the man for their conversation and makes his way home and even though admitting he was gay out loud for the first time was quite the relief, he still was no more certain about his feelings for TJ than he was last night.</p><p>Cyrus enters his house and closes the front door beside himself.</p><p>\u201cCyrus is that you?\u201d Todd, Cyrus\u2019 stepfathers, voice calls out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d Cyrus calls back and makes his way to the kitchen where his voice was coming from. </p><p>\u201cYou disappeared early this morning and you weren\u2019t answering your phone.\u201d Todd frowns.</p><p>Cyrus lets out a groan, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I went for a walk and I lost my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost it?\u201d Todd looks a little upset by this. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cyrus frowns and he decides to not get into the full story.\u00a0</p><p>Todd softens after noticing Cyrus\u2019 glum expression, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just <i>really</i> missing my friends.\u201d Cyrus says and this was an honest answer, it might not have been the whole truth but now more than ever, Cyrus wished he had the comfort of his best friends.</p><p>\u201cWell there\u2019s a little something in your room that might cheer you up.\u201d Todd says with a smile. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll talk to your mom about the phone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cyrus mumbles and he was doubtful anything could change his current mood but still he forces a smile for his stepdad\u2019s benefit. Cyrus sulks down the hall towards his bedroom. He pushes open his bedroom door and is speechless at the surprise waiting on the other side of it. Standing in his room with cheerful expressions was Andi, Buffy and Jonah and they all shout a joyful, \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are back?\u201d Cyrus\u2019 mouth hangs agape, \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be back for three more days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came home early to surprise you.\u201d Buffy says through a smile.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stand there the whole time or can we have a hug?\u201d Andi asks with her arms out wide. A group embrace follows and Cyrus had to try very hard to stop himself from crying, having his best friends back at a time when he needed them most was absolutely overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cTell us about your summer,\u201d Andi says, \u201cI want to know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Buffy says, \u201cI need you to explain to me again how you ended up becoming best pals with Walker and Marty of all people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd TJ.\u201d Jonah adds.</p><p>\u201cWe all already knew he liked, TJ.\u201d Buffy chuckles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Cyrus asks frantically.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cyrus, you were friends before summer.\u201d Buffy laughs.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head. <i>She means as friends. Of course she does</i>. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about my summer, tell me about your summer, I\u2019ve missed you guys so much!\u201d Cyrus tries to avoid thinking about TJ or making anyone suspicious about what was going on. \u201cAndi how was the road trip? Buffy, Jonah, how was camp?\u201d Cyrus asks. </p><p>The three sit around and all get reaqiunted, although they had surprised Cyrus, they had <i>all</i> been separated from each other this summer.<br/> Even though Cyrus was ecstatic to have his friends home and genuinely interested in hearing about their adventures he couldn\u2019t help but let his mind wander back to his confusion over his feelings for TJ. </p><p>\u201cIs everything okay, Cy-Guy?\u201d Jonah questions. </p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d Cyrus nods. \u201cI just missed you guys so much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe missed you too.\u201d Andi says with a loving smile and she and\u00a0Cyrus exchange a lovey dovey look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go home and unpack my bag, hang out with my dad for a bit,\u201d Jonah gets up, \u201cI\u2019ll let the good hair crew catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave.\u201d Andi frowns.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You guys should talk.\u201d Jonah smiles, \u201cBut we should all go to The Spoon tomorrow?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed their baby taters and milkshakes so much.\u201d Buffy rubs her stomach. </p><p>\u201cCount me in.\u201d Andi says softly with a nod. </p><p>Once Jonah leaves, Cyrus could feel the mood in the room flip completely. Both girls were pointing quizzical looks at Cyrus and he felt like he was being interrogated. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell us what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Buffy asks. </p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head. </p><p>\u201cYou love talking about yourself,\u201d Buffy jokes with a soft laugh, \u201cHow come every time someone asked you about summer you\u2019ve deflected?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Andi questions, \u201cYou seemed to be having a blast with the \u2018bouncy boys\u2019-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not okay that you started a new crew.\u201d Buffy interjects.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Andi finishes her sentence.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus lets out a frustrated groan as he knew there was no hiding from his two best friends. \u201cI have a crush on TJ and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Cyrus folds his arms across his chest.</p><p>Buffy blinks with a blank expression for a moment whilst Andi is smiling. </p><p>\u201cYou two aren&rsquo;t acting surprised, why aren\u2019t you acting surprised?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised.\u201d Buffy states.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you you knew and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Cyrus is offended.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Andi laughs softly.\u00a0\u201cWe just thought you didn\u2019t want to tell us yet.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that I liked him.<i>\u00a0Allegedly.</i>\u201d Cyrus points his finger in the air.\u00a0\u201cI said I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about it.\u201d Andi says. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I want to talk about.\u201d Buffy agrees.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly sure you liked him, but hearing you talk about your summer over the phone made me think that maybe it was possible.\u201d Andi explains.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThe thought crossed my mind while we were still at school.\u201d Buffy shares.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cyrus questions.<br/></p><p>\u201cI thought you liked Jonah?\u201d Andi questions,\u00a0\u201cDo you like both of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, his crush on Jonah is gone.\u201d Buffy shakes her head and then an idea crosses her face, \u201cDid it go away because you like TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like Jonah anymore?\u201d Andi questions, \u201cWhy didnt you tell me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Cyrus says.\u00a0\u201cAnd I told you I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bring something up and then not talk about it.\u201d Buffy states, \u201cIt\u2019s a good hair crew rule.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou broke that rule when you refused to tell me who your secret crush was.\u201d Cyrus retorts. </p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d Buffy whines. </p><p>\u201cYou have a secret crush?\u201d Andi questions, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Buffy shrugs. </p><p>\u201cIs it someone I know?\u201d Andi continues her questioning. \u201cWould I be hurt by your crush?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Buffy insists. </p><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Andi frowns.\u00a0\u201cWhy do you guys not tell me stuff anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you because I didn\u2019t want you to tell me I told me so.\u201d Buffy huffs. </p><p>\u201cWhy would I say that?\u201d Andi asks. </p><p>\u201cBecause her crush is on Marty\u2026\u201d Cyrus says as it clicked in his brain. </p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d Andi asks. \u201cFrom the party? As in the Marty that you virtually dated but for real turned down?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee!\u201d Buffy says, \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI knew you liked him back when you fake dated.\u201d Andi eyes Buffy. </p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Buffy folds her arms, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now because Marty has a girlfriend and nothing is ever going to come of my stupid crush.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMarty broke up with his girlfriend at the end of the school year,\u201d Cyrus informs her, \u201cDid I forget to mention that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Buffy says, \u201cBut it still doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt definitely matters!\u201d Cyrus says excitedly, \u201cMarty st-\u201c Cyrus stops himself. As much as he wanted to speculate about Marty\u2019s obvious intrest in Buffy still, Cyrus didn\u2019t want to do that to a friend. </p><p>\u201cMarty what?\u201d Buffy questions. </p><p>\u201cMarty is a great guy.\u201d Cyrus smiles. </p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Andi?\u201d Buffy turns the attention on someone else. \u201cHow was it seeing Jonah again?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWeird?\u201d Andi shrugs, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m happy to see him but it\u2019s been so long apart.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stop by his house tonight and talk alone?\u201d Buffy suggests. </p><p>\u201cThat can wait until tomorrow.\u201d Andi says. \u201cI want to stay here with you guys.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I want to know how my sweet and innocent best friend could like a toad like TJ Kippen.\u201d Buffy turns her head Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cBuffy!\u201d Cyrus frowns. </p><p>\u201cFine, since we\u2019re friends now I can be nicer,\u201d Buffy sighs, \u201cHe\u2019s a total frog, how could you like him?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus jumps up from his desk chair with a groan, Andi and Buffy who are sitting at the end of Cyrus\u2019 bed eye him for this outburst.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Cyrus repeats.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m too confused. I have no idea when I began to like him&hellip; I thought maybe it was when he helped me with the muffin but then I\u2019m pretty sure I was just surprised that he was being nice to me because he was a scary guy.\u201d Cyrus begins pacing around the room whist the two girls follow him with their eyes, \u201cThen I thought it could have been our first time on the swings because that was a really nice moment, it was the first time we really talked but I\u2019m pretty sure I was just intrigued by his softer side, I don\u2019t know if I like liked him back then.\u201d Cyrus stops dead in his tracks and scrunches up his face, \u201cWas it his apology rap?\u201d Cyrus begins his pacing again, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be there rap, of all the moments we\u2019ve shared, it couldn\u2019t possibly be the rap.. Could it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t want to talk about it you sure have a lot to say.\u201d Andi lets out a quiet laugh and Buffy nods with a knowing smile too. </p><p>\u201cWhat I want and need are clearly two different things.\u201d Cyrus sighs and he flops down on the bed between them.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I have a crush on him at all. Maybe I just like how nice he\u2019s been to me this summer and I\u2019m misplacing my feelings,\u201d Cyrus stares at the ceiling as he talks. \u201cWhen I liked Jonah I was nervous around him all the time, I couldn\u2019t think straight, I was so obsessed with him liking me or thinking I was cool but it\u2019s not like that with TJ. Since the swings I\u2019ve only ever been comfortable with him\u2026 I mean sure there is my surface level anxiety present but that\u2019s always there\u2026 Other than that, being around TJ is easy. I\u2019m not worried about him liking me because he\u2019s only ever encouraged me to be myself\u2026\u201d</p><p>Andi and Buffy both lay back beside Cyrus, their shoulders all brushing together. </p><p>&quot;You totally like him.\u201d Andi says with a smile pointed to the ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou <i>like,</i> like him.\u201d Buffy nudges Cyrus with a giggle.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Cyrus exhales with a frown.\u00a0\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou could tell him how you feel?\u201d Andi suggests.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou could lay here and avoid your feelings forever?\u201d Buffy jokes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI like that idea, let\u2019s do that.\u201d Cyrus is hopeful.\u00a0</p><p>Buffy rolls onto her side and looks at Cyrus,\u00a0\u201cI think TJ could like you back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus sits up and gives her an \u2018are you crazy?\u2019 look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious, Cyrus. Maybe it\u2019s wrong for me to speculate but I think it\u2019s possible&hellip;\u201d Buffy says.\u00a0\u201cI could go see him and try and work it out-\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Cyrus shuts that idea down.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just suppress your feelings for the rest of your life, Cyrus.\u201d Buffy coaxes her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell Marty how you feel?\u201d Cyrus challenges.\u00a0\u201cOr Andi, are you going to face the awkwardness between you and Jonah?\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t drag me into this, I\u2019m not pressuring you.\u201d Andi is still laying down as she whines.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Buffy lays back down too,\u00a0\u201cProblem avoiding, party of three.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus rejoins them with a small smile,\u00a0\u201cI really missed you guys.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>The next day the four friends meet for an early lunch. Although Cyrus was still quietly obsessing over the TJ of it all, he was very much enjoying having Andi, Buffy and Jonah with him.\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019re still catching up about their individual summer escapades when the food arrives. Cyrus is only one baby tater in when the bell on the door chimes and the person entering sends him into a spiral. Both TJ and Marty enter.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, hi?\u201d TJ is surprised to see who Cyrus was seated with.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t think you got back for two days.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe missed each other so much we decided to come home early.\u201d Andi says with a sweet smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd I already beat everyone at everything at camp,\u201d Buffy wears a smug grin,\u00a0\u201cIt was boring.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Marty smiles at this but doesn\u2019t directly comment. Buffy notably grows sheepish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you guys going to sit down?\u201d Jonah asks as the two boys were just hovering by the table.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Marty pushes TJ to squish into the booth on Cyrus\u2019 side and he pulls over a chair and sits at the end of the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy\u00a0didn\u2019t you tell me they were back?\u201d TJ looks to Cyrus as he sits down. Cyrus can only offer up a shrug and goes back to eating his baby taters.\u00a0</p><p>As time passes things only got more awkward. Cyrus was closed off completely and not contributing to the conversation unless directly called upon. To make it worse he felt like he was being analysed by Buffy and Andi as they were interested to see the dynamic between Cyrus and TJ. Marty was acting strange like he had been for a few days now and Cyrus wanted nothing more than to bail.\u00a0</p><p>After everyone is finished eating they were all just lingering around to chat. Cyrus spent five minutes mentally trying to find an excuse to leave. Before he can offer up an obvious lie, Jonah says he\u2019s got to go and asked if Cyrus wanted to walk him home as his mother said she missed him. Cyrus jumps on the opportunity to escape and leaves without really saying goodbye properly.\u00a0</p><p>Once outside the two begin walking and Jonah appeared to be in thought, like he was trying to figure out what to say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t really say she missed you.\u201d Jonah says and Cyrus looks hurt by this, Jonah lets out nervous laugh,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure she does miss you, it just looked like you needed an excuse to leave.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWas it that obvious?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDid something happen between you guys?\u201d Jonah questions.\u00a0\u201cIs this why you seemed kinda down yesterday?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus frowns to himself, this conversation was flaring up his anxiety greatly. He couldn\u2019t talk to Jonah, not about this.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Cyrus shakes his head,\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you can,\u201d Jonah says,\u00a0\u201cIf you want&hellip;\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus felt Jonah\u2019s side stare and he stops in his tracks causing Jonah to as well. Cyrus studies Jonah\u2019s expression and knits his brows in response,\u00a0\u201cYou know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat you<i> like</i> TJ?\u201d Jonah asks softly.\u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d He nods.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201d Cyrus can\u2019t even finish his question, he just looks at Jonah in a state of shock.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m kind of oblivious sometimes,\u201d Jonah laughs at his own expense,\u00a0\u201cBut I roomed with this kid at camp, he opened my eyes up to a lot of stuff going on around me that I missed.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Cyrus asks nervously.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFor like three whole months I thought you had a crush on Buffy.\u201d Jonah laughs.\u00a0\u201cI was very wrong about that.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOn Buffy?\u201d Cyrus chokes on his own laugh.\u00a0\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you wanted to fix her TJ problem-\u201d Jonah shakes his head embarrassed,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking okay.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus laughs at this and he couldn\u2019t believe he was having a discussion with Jonah Beck about his feelings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen he suggested you might have wanted to fix things between them for another reason.\u201d Jonah says.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI think I need to meet his guy, it sounds like he\u2019s got\u00a0all my confusing feelings worked out,\u201d Cyrus jokes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can talk to me, if you want.\u201d Jonah says.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now, I kind of want to avoid my problems until it all blows up in my face.\u201d Cyrus says.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBut when it all blows up?\u201d Jonah asks in a lightly joking manner.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely take you up on that offer to talk.\u201d Cyrus smiles.\u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019re okay with me being gay?\u201d He said it out loud for the second time, it still felt strange but it was getting easier.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jonah says genuinely,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Cyrus, nothing could change that.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus can\u2019t help but smile at this, he was terrified of Jonah finding out his feelings in the past and he clearly had no reason to. Whilst Cyrus had no intention of bringing up his past crush with Jonah he did think that maybe one day he would be able to laugh about it with him.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus does stop by Jonah\u2019s house for a while to say hello to the Beck\u2019s before returning home. Cyrus\u2019 surprise chat with Jonah about his sexuality was enough for Cyrus to distract himself from obsessing over TJ.<br/></p><p>Cyrus returns to find his mom cooking dinner and he offers to help. Cyrus\u2019 mother hums along to the radio that\u2019s lightly playing in the background whilst Cyrus remains quiet in thought.\u00a0The door bell rings and interrupts them both.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on that pot on the stove while I get the door.\u201d Leslie quickly bounces off towards the front of their house.</p><p>Cyrus stops chopping the vegetables and goes over to stir the pot. As he pops the lid back over the pot on the stove he hears his mother greet someone at the door in very welcoming way.</p><p>\u201cTJ, honey, hello.\u201d Leslie says and Cyrus tenses up. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen you in while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been sick this past week but I\u2019m fine now.\u201d TJ replies and Cyrus is hiding in the kitchen in a panic.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, come in. Cy is in the kitchen helping me with dinner.\u201d Leslie invites him in.</p><p>Cyrus seriously considered bailing, just leaving out the back door and never returning but Leslie had accompanied TJ into the kitchen before Cyrus could execute his escape plan.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy.\u201d TJ says gently as he hovers by the kitchen counter.</p><p>Cyrus pretends he was still stirring the pot on the stove, \u201cHey, TJ.\u201d He says casually without turning around.</p><p>\u201cYou boys go off into your room, Cy. I\u2019ll finish up with dinner,\u201d Leslie says as she pries the wooden spoon from Cyrus\u2019 hand. \u201cTJ you\u2019re welcome to stay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d TJ smiles,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know I love your cooking.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>Great, he\u2019s being charming,</i> Cyrus thinks to himself with a frown.\u00a0Without a word Cyrus sets off down the hall in the direction of his room. TJ is a step behind him and playfully steps on the back of Cyrus\u2019 shoe because he knew it annoyed the shorter boy but instead of reacting with an amusing sulky expression like TJ had expected, Cyrus just ignores him and continues on.</p><p>Cyrus hovers in his room whilst TJ takes a seat at the edge of Cyrus\u2019 bed, he picks up the tiny stuffed frog Cyrus had won and twirls it in his hand. Cyrus plants himself in the desk chair in the opposite corner of the room.\u00a0An awkward second that felt like an eternity to Cyrus passes.</p><p>\u201cSo..\u201d Cyrus says nervously. \u201cIs something up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d TJ shrugs a shoulder \u201c I just thought we could hang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just saw each other for lunch at the Spoon.\u201d Cyrus states.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t hung out twice in a day before.\u201d TJ acknowledges. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to be weird about it, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go.\u201d Cyrus says unconvingly and TJ still gets up to leave.</p><p>\u201cThe real reason I came here was to ask why you\u2019re being so weird with me.\u201d TJ says</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being weird.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cYes you are, I was worried I did something at the carnival-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t don\u2019t anything wrong.\u201d Cyrus interrupts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo why does it feel like you\u2019ve been avoiding me the past two days?\u201d TJ frowns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not avoiding you.\u201d Cyrus tries to look casual and not as anxious as he felt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou bailed straight after fireworks, you ignored my texts all day yesterday, you didn\u2019t tell me that \u201cBuffy, Andi and Jonah were back and you clearly didn\u2019t want me at The Spoon\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true and\u00a0I dropped my phone off the pier so I couldn\u2019t message you.\u201d Cyrus explains.</p><p>TJ wears a confused look and Cyrus just sighs and says it\u2019s a long story.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we fighting? This is kind of stupid.\u201d TJ tries to defuse things with a laugh but it felt forced.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ve hung out so much this summer we\u2019ve started to annoy each other,\u201d Cyrus spins the desk chair slightly and starts fiddling with something on his desk, his body angled away from TJ as he says, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good thing if we hang out with other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I spend all summer helping you with your stupid list but the second your other friends come home you\u2019re ready to bail?\u201d TJ looks hurt by Cyrus\u2019 suggestion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo now my list is stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the sudden I\u2019m annoying for helping you?\u201d TJ retorts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Cyrus frowns.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it sounded like.\u201d TJ says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cyrus, I\u2019ll just do the pier jump with Walker and Marty instead. \u201cYou have fun with your real friends now they\u2019re home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus wanted to stop TJ and explain why he\u2019s being so weird but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to. He thought maybe it was best if TJ and him weren\u2019t as close anymore. He felt guilty for this whole summer and now that Cyrus was aware of his feelings, it just felt wrong for them to be so close without TJ knowing the truth. Cyrus felt like a bad person, how could they ever have a sleepover again, or even have a harmless piggyback without feeling like he was doing something wrong. Cyrus never felt like this with Jonah but they were also new friends at the peak of his crush, they weren\u2019t really best friends until his feelings went away.\u00a0</p><p>After TJ storms out in a huff,\u00a0Cyrus goes over to the bed and picks up his little frog from the carnival that TJ dropped before exiting. Cyrus holds it in his hands as he flops down on his back. A short moment later Leslie is in Cyrus\u2019 doorway with a concerned expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI saw TJ leave, he seemed upset,\u201d Leslie frowns,\u00a0\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus thought about brushing it off. Smiling and telling his mother that everything was great but even after all the comforting chats he\u2019s had the past two days all he wanted to do was talk to his mom about it. Especially after this fight with TJ.</p><p>Before Cyrus could get any words out he starts crying. Within a second Leslie is by her sons side on the bed and she wraps her arms around him with a comforting embrace.\u00a0</p><p>Eventually Cyrus manages to stifle his sobs long enough to tell his mom everything. About his crush on Jonah, his confusion about being gay, his new crush on TJ and how he\u2019s pushed him away because he feels like he\u2019s being a bad person.\u00a0Leslie wipes tears from her sons damp cheeks and assures him he\u00a0has nothing to feel guilty for.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ hates me now.\u201d Cyrus says sadly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh cookie, he\u00a0doesn\u2019t hate you, I can assure you of this much.\u201d Leslie says with a small smile,\u00a0\u201cYou obviously mean a lot to him too so pushing him away wouldn\u2019t feel the best. He\u2019s just upset and doesn\u2019t understand why.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even understand why.\u201d Cyrus frowns and he felt the urge to start crying again. Leslie comforted Cyrus as long as he wanted her to. She didn\u2019t say\u00a0\u201coh I already knew\u201d or anything that made him feel like she had pre diagnosed him, nor did she say or do anything that made Cyrus feel like he was currently being analysed. It didn\u2019t feel like a therapy session between a doctor and her patient, it felt like the comforting motherly love Cyrus didnt know he needed until she was giving it.\u00a0<br/></p><hr><p><b>End Notes:\u00a0</b>The next chapter is the<i> last one!!!! </i>There will be an epilogue and a bonus chapter after that.

When Cyrus turns around he finds the man the voice belonged to. Just shy of the end of the pier was an old man fishing. Cyrus looks at him for a second and then realisation crosses his face, he knew this man. This was the old man Cyrus and TJ had spoken to at the beginning of summer, one half of the elderly couple TJ had asked to pick a number when they were beginning the list.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cI met you briefly at the beginning of summer.\u201d </p><p>The old man looks confused, \u201cI forget things a lot these days, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d Cyrus wears a sympathetic and sad smile, \u201cYou were with your wife of 60 years.\u201d </p><p>This makes the man grin from ear to ear. \u201cWould you like to sit down?\u201d He motions to the space beside him. Cyrus didn\u2019t know why but he accepts the mans invitation and very nervously sits himself down, although Cyrus was too frightened to let his feet dangle over the edge so instead he sits a small distance back to be safe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy name is William, what\u2019s yours?\u201d He introduces.</p><p>\u201cCyrus. Nice to officially meet you.\u201d Cyrus smiles politely. </p><p>\u201cWhat seems to be troubling you, Cyrus?\u201d William asks. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long and complicated story,\u201d Cyrus shakes his head, \u201cSo complicated I\u2019m\u00a0not sure I even understand it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got time,\u201d William gently shakes his fishing rod. </p><p>Cyrus is quiet for a second. Was he really going to open up to a complete stranger? Cyrus lets out a loud exhale and figures why not?\u00a0\u201cI think I have feelings for my friend..\u201d Cyrus chooses to be vague.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d William gives Cyrus a questioning look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll signs are pointing that way and I have no idea how it happened.\u201d Cyrus sighs, \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for the good part of a year now and somewhere along the way I \u2018allegedly\u2019,\u201d Cyrus dramatically uses are quotes,\u00a0\u201cdeveloped feelings for hi- them.\u201d </p><p>The old man pauses in thought like he was wracking his memories for something in particular, then he nods with a smile. </p><p>\u201cI remember you now.\u201d William says, \u201cYou and your friend were at the diner, playing with your food.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus laughs, \u201cYeah that\u2019s my friend TJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAn this is the same friend you have feelings for?\u201d William questions and Cyrus gives a sheepish nod as he had no idea how the man would react to Cyrus\u2019 feelings being for a boy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t like him back then?\u201d William asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Cyrus sighs again,\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know I liked him until last night, who knows when these so called feelings developed?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd why are you out here on the pier so early in the morning and not talking to your friend about how you feel?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know how I feel.\u201d Cyrus stresses. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to ruin our friendship.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a good friendship there\u2019s nothing you could say to ruin it.\u201d William says like a wise old man.\u00a0\u201cEven putting feelings out in the open.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s a nice idea but Cyrus knew that unrequited feelings definitely could make things difficult between them. \u201cI want to talk to him but I\u2019m scared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow does being on the pier help that?\u201d William questions.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus quickly summarises the list and how they\u2019ve been working through it all summer. \u201cI came to the pier with the intent to jump off it. This is supposed to be the thing I\u2019m most scared of on the list\u2026 If I could do this maybe I could face what I\u2019m actually afraid of.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhich are your feelings for your friend?\u201d William asks.</p><p>\u201cMy feelings in general.\u201d Cyrus frowns, \u201cEver since I realised I was different I\u2019ve avoided thinking about it. I don\u2019t know what I am.\u201d </p><p>William is quiet for a moment.\u00a0\u201cYou like a boy?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI liked a boy, past tense, but even that was more of a weird infatuation.\u201d Cyrus knits his brows,\u00a0\u201cMy current feelings are to be determined. Maybe I\u2019m just having a break down and TJ is being roped into that\u2026 Not that TJ isn\u2019t likeable, I mean he\u2019s always been so kind and supportive and tall-\u201d Cyrus stops abruptly and shakes his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d William chuckles and his old man laugh was comforting to Cyrus in a weird way,\u00a0\u201cAre you worried about liking this boy or what liking two boys means?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d Cyrus shrugs.\u00a0\u201cI guess deep down, I know I\u00a0like boys\u2026 exclusively\u2026\u201d Cyrus says with a squinted expression that makes it sound more like a question he wanted answered.</p><p>\u201cI think they have a word for that, son.\u201d The old man says with a quiet laugh. </p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019m gay,\u201d Cyrus says out loud for the first time ever and it was honestly a such a relief to admit it to himself more than anything, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I like, TJ\u2026\u201d Cyrus folds his arms with a huff and this causes William to laugh again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, son.\u201d William says and for some reason that was extremely comforting to hear, even from a perfect stranger.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus stays with William for over an hour. Cyrus was still too stressed to entertain the idea of liking TJ so he instead asks William about his marriage. Eventually Cyrus parts ways with William, he thanks the man for their conversation and makes his way home and even though admitting he was gay out loud for the first time was quite the relief, he still was no more certain about his feelings for TJ than he was last night.</p><p>Cyrus enters his house and closes the front door beside himself.</p><p>\u201cCyrus is that you?\u201d Todd, Cyrus\u2019 stepfathers, voice calls out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d Cyrus calls back and makes his way to the kitchen where his voice was coming from. </p><p>\u201cYou disappeared early this morning and you weren\u2019t answering your phone.\u201d Todd frowns.</p><p>Cyrus lets out a groan, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I went for a walk and I lost my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost it?\u201d Todd looks a little upset by this. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cyrus frowns and he decides to not get into the full story.\u00a0</p><p>Todd softens after noticing Cyrus\u2019 glum expression, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just <i>really</i> missing my friends.\u201d Cyrus says and this was an honest answer, it might not have been the whole truth but now more than ever, Cyrus wished he had the comfort of his best friends.</p><p>\u201cWell there\u2019s a little something in your room that might cheer you up.\u201d Todd says with a smile. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll talk to your mom about the phone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cyrus mumbles and he was doubtful anything could change his current mood but still he forces a smile for his stepdad\u2019s benefit. Cyrus sulks down the hall towards his bedroom. He pushes open his bedroom door and is speechless at the surprise waiting on the other side of it. Standing in his room with cheerful expressions was Andi, Buffy and Jonah and they all shout a joyful, \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are back?\u201d Cyrus\u2019 mouth hangs agape, \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be back for three more days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came home early to surprise you.\u201d Buffy says through a smile.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stand there the whole time or can we have a hug?\u201d Andi asks with her arms out wide. A group embrace follows and Cyrus had to try very hard to stop himself from crying, having his best friends back at a time when he needed them most was absolutely overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cTell us about your summer,\u201d Andi says, \u201cI want to know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Buffy says, \u201cI need you to explain to me again how you ended up becoming best pals with Walker and Marty of all people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd TJ.\u201d Jonah adds.</p><p>\u201cWe all already knew he liked, TJ.\u201d Buffy chuckles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Cyrus asks frantically.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cyrus, you were friends before summer.\u201d Buffy laughs.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head. <i>She means as friends. Of course she does</i>. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about my summer, tell me about your summer, I\u2019ve missed you guys so much!\u201d Cyrus tries to avoid thinking about TJ or making anyone suspicious about what was going on. \u201cAndi how was the road trip? Buffy, Jonah, how was camp?\u201d Cyrus asks. </p><p>The three sit around and all get reaqiunted, although they had surprised Cyrus, they had <i>all</i> been separated from each other this summer.<br> Even though Cyrus was ecstatic to have his friends home and genuinely interested in hearing about their adventures he couldn\u2019t help but let his mind wander back to his confusion over his feelings for TJ. </p><p>\u201cIs everything okay, Cy-Guy?\u201d Jonah questions. </p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d Cyrus nods. \u201cI just missed you guys so much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe missed you too.\u201d Andi says with a loving smile and she and\u00a0Cyrus exchange a lovey dovey look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go home and unpack my bag, hang out with my dad for a bit,\u201d Jonah gets up, \u201cI\u2019ll let the good hair crew catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave.\u201d Andi frowns.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You guys should talk.\u201d Jonah smiles, \u201cBut we should all go to The Spoon tomorrow?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed their baby taters and milkshakes so much.\u201d Buffy rubs her stomach. </p><p>\u201cCount me in.\u201d Andi says softly with a nod. </p><p>Once Jonah leaves, Cyrus could feel the mood in the room flip completely. Both girls were pointing quizzical looks at Cyrus and he felt like he was being interrogated. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell us what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Buffy asks. </p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head. </p><p>\u201cYou love talking about yourself,\u201d Buffy jokes with a soft laugh, \u201cHow come every time someone asked you about summer you\u2019ve deflected?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Andi questions, \u201cYou seemed to be having a blast with the \u2018bouncy boys\u2019-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not okay that you started a new crew.\u201d Buffy interjects.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Andi finishes her sentence.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus lets out a frustrated groan as he knew there was no hiding from his two best friends. \u201cI have a crush on TJ and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Cyrus folds his arms across his chest.</p><p>Buffy blinks with a blank expression for a moment whilst Andi is smiling. </p><p>\u201cYou two aren\u2019t acting surprised, why aren\u2019t you acting surprised?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised.\u201d Buffy states.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you you knew and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Cyrus is offended.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Andi laughs softly.\u00a0\u201cWe just thought you didn\u2019t want to tell us yet.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that I liked him.<i>\u00a0Allegedly.</i>\u201d Cyrus points his finger in the air.\u00a0\u201cI said I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about it.\u201d Andi says. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I want to talk about.\u201d Buffy agrees.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly sure you liked him, but hearing you talk about your summer over the phone made me think that maybe it was possible.\u201d Andi explains.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThe thought crossed my mind while we were still at school.\u201d Buffy shares.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cyrus questions.<br></p><p>\u201cI thought you liked Jonah?\u201d Andi questions,\u00a0\u201cDo you like both of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, his crush on Jonah is gone.\u201d Buffy shakes her head and then an idea crosses her face, \u201cDid it go away because you like TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like Jonah anymore?\u201d Andi questions, \u201cWhy didnt you tell me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Cyrus says.\u00a0\u201cAnd I told you I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bring something up and then not talk about it.\u201d Buffy states, \u201cIt\u2019s a good hair crew rule.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou broke that rule when you refused to tell me who your secret crush was.\u201d Cyrus retorts. </p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d Buffy whines. </p><p>\u201cYou have a secret crush?\u201d Andi questions, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Buffy shrugs. </p><p>\u201cIs it someone I know?\u201d Andi continues her questioning. \u201cWould I be hurt by your crush?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Buffy insists. </p><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Andi frowns.\u00a0\u201cWhy do you guys not tell me stuff anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you because I didn\u2019t want you to tell me I told me so.\u201d Buffy huffs. </p><p>\u201cWhy would I say that?\u201d Andi asks. </p><p>\u201cBecause her crush is on Marty\u2026\u201d Cyrus says as it clicked in his brain. </p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d Andi asks. \u201cFrom the party? As in the Marty that you virtually dated but for real turned down?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee!\u201d Buffy says, \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI knew you liked him back when you fake dated.\u201d Andi eyes Buffy. </p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Buffy folds her arms, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now because Marty has a girlfriend and nothing is ever going to come of my stupid crush.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMarty broke up with his girlfriend at the end of the school year,\u201d Cyrus informs her, \u201cDid I forget to mention that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Buffy says, \u201cBut it still doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt definitely matters!\u201d Cyrus says excitedly, \u201cMarty st-\u201c Cyrus stops himself. As much as he wanted to speculate about Marty\u2019s obvious intrest in Buffy still, Cyrus didn\u2019t want to do that to a friend. </p><p>\u201cMarty what?\u201d Buffy questions. </p><p>\u201cMarty is a great guy.\u201d Cyrus smiles. </p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Andi?\u201d Buffy turns the attention on someone else. \u201cHow was it seeing Jonah again?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWeird?\u201d Andi shrugs, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m happy to see him but it\u2019s been so long apart.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stop by his house tonight and talk alone?\u201d Buffy suggests. </p><p>\u201cThat can wait until tomorrow.\u201d Andi says. \u201cI want to stay here with you guys.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I want to know how my sweet and innocent best friend could like a toad like TJ Kippen.\u201d Buffy turns her head Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cBuffy!\u201d Cyrus frowns. </p><p>\u201cFine, since we\u2019re friends now I can be nicer,\u201d Buffy sighs, \u201cHe\u2019s a total frog, how could you like him?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus jumps up from his desk chair with a groan, Andi and Buffy who are sitting at the end of Cyrus\u2019 bed eye him for this outburst.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Cyrus repeats.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m too confused. I have no idea when I began to like him\u2026 I thought maybe it was when he helped me with the muffin but then I\u2019m pretty sure I was just surprised that he was being nice to me because he was a scary guy.\u201d Cyrus begins pacing around the room whist the two girls follow him with their eyes, \u201cThen I thought it could have been our first time on the swings because that was a really nice moment, it was the first time we really talked but I\u2019m pretty sure I was just intrigued by his softer side, I don\u2019t know if I like liked him back then.\u201d Cyrus stops dead in his tracks and scrunches up his face, \u201cWas it his apology rap?\u201d Cyrus begins his pacing again, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be there rap, of all the moments we\u2019ve shared, it couldn\u2019t possibly be the rap.. Could it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t want to talk about it you sure have a lot to say.\u201d Andi lets out a quiet laugh and Buffy nods with a knowing smile too. </p><p>\u201cWhat I want and need are clearly two different things.\u201d Cyrus sighs and he flops down on the bed between them.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I have a crush on him at all. Maybe I just like how nice he\u2019s been to me this summer and I\u2019m misplacing my feelings,\u201d Cyrus stares at the ceiling as he talks. \u201cWhen I liked Jonah I was nervous around him all the time, I couldn\u2019t think straight, I was so obsessed with him liking me or thinking I was cool but it\u2019s not like that with TJ. Since the swings I\u2019ve only ever been comfortable with him\u2026 I mean sure there is my surface level anxiety present but that\u2019s always there\u2026 Other than that, being around TJ is easy. I\u2019m not worried about him liking me because he\u2019s only ever encouraged me to be myself\u2026\u201d</p><p>Andi and Buffy both lay back beside Cyrus, their shoulders all brushing together. </p><p>\"You totally like him.\u201d Andi says with a smile pointed to the ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou <i>like,</i> like him.\u201d Buffy nudges Cyrus with a giggle.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Cyrus exhales with a frown.\u00a0\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou could tell him how you feel?\u201d Andi suggests.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou could lay here and avoid your feelings forever?\u201d Buffy jokes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI like that idea, let\u2019s do that.\u201d Cyrus is hopeful.\u00a0</p><p>Buffy rolls onto her side and looks at Cyrus,\u00a0\u201cI think TJ could like you back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus sits up and gives her an \u2018are you crazy?\u2019 look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious, Cyrus. Maybe it\u2019s wrong for me to speculate but I think it\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d Buffy says.\u00a0\u201cI could go see him and try and work it out-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Cyrus shuts that idea down.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just suppress your feelings for the rest of your life, Cyrus.\u201d Buffy coaxes her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell Marty how you feel?\u201d Cyrus challenges.\u00a0\u201cOr Andi, are you going to face the awkwardness between you and Jonah?\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t drag me into this, I\u2019m not pressuring you.\u201d Andi is still laying down as she whines.\u00a0<br></p><p>Buffy lays back down too,\u00a0\u201cProblem avoiding, party of three.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus rejoins them with a small smile,\u00a0\u201cI really missed you guys.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>The next day the four friends meet for an early lunch. Although Cyrus was still quietly obsessing over the TJ of it all, he was very much enjoying having Andi, Buffy and Jonah with him.\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019re still catching up about their individual summer escapades when the food arrives. Cyrus is only one baby tater in when the bell on the door chimes and the person entering sends him into a spiral. Both TJ and Marty enter.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, hi?\u201d TJ is surprised to see who Cyrus was seated with.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t think you got back for two days.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe missed each other so much we decided to come home early.\u201d Andi says with a sweet smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I already beat everyone at everything at camp,\u201d Buffy wears a smug grin,\u00a0\u201cIt was boring.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Marty smiles at this but doesn\u2019t directly comment. Buffy notably grows sheepish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you guys going to sit down?\u201d Jonah asks as the two boys were just hovering by the table.\u00a0<br></p><p>Marty pushes TJ to squish into the booth on Cyrus\u2019 side and he pulls over a chair and sits at the end of the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy\u00a0didn\u2019t you tell me they were back?\u201d TJ looks to Cyrus as he sits down. Cyrus can only offer up a shrug and goes back to eating his baby taters.\u00a0</p><p>As time passes things only got more awkward. Cyrus was closed off completely and not contributing to the conversation unless directly called upon. To make it worse he felt like he was being analysed by Buffy and Andi as they were interested to see the dynamic between Cyrus and TJ. Marty was acting strange like he had been for a few days now and Cyrus wanted nothing more than to bail.\u00a0</p><p>After everyone is finished eating they were all just lingering around to chat. Cyrus spent five minutes mentally trying to find an excuse to leave. Before he can offer up an obvious lie, Jonah says he\u2019s got to go and asked if Cyrus wanted to walk him home as his mother said she missed him. Cyrus jumps on the opportunity to escape and leaves without really saying goodbye properly.\u00a0</p><p>Once outside the two begin walking and Jonah appeared to be in thought, like he was trying to figure out what to say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t really say she missed you.\u201d Jonah says and Cyrus looks hurt by this, Jonah lets out nervous laugh,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure she does miss you, it just looked like you needed an excuse to leave.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWas it that obvious?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid something happen between you guys?\u201d Jonah questions.\u00a0\u201cIs this why you seemed kinda down yesterday?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus frowns to himself, this conversation was flaring up his anxiety greatly. He couldn\u2019t talk to Jonah, not about this.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Cyrus shakes his head,\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you can,\u201d Jonah says,\u00a0\u201cIf you want\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus felt Jonah\u2019s side stare and he stops in his tracks causing Jonah to as well. Cyrus studies Jonah\u2019s expression and knits his brows in response,\u00a0\u201cYou know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat you<i> like</i> TJ?\u201d Jonah asks softly.\u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d He nods.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201d Cyrus can\u2019t even finish his question, he just looks at Jonah in a state of shock.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m kind of oblivious sometimes,\u201d Jonah laughs at his own expense,\u00a0\u201cBut I roomed with this kid at camp, he opened my eyes up to a lot of stuff going on around me that I missed.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Cyrus asks nervously.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFor like three whole months I thought you had a crush on Buffy.\u201d Jonah laughs.\u00a0\u201cI was very wrong about that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOn Buffy?\u201d Cyrus chokes on his own laugh.\u00a0\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you wanted to fix her TJ problem-\u201d Jonah shakes his head embarrassed,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking okay.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus laughs at this and he couldn\u2019t believe he was having a discussion with Jonah Beck about his feelings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen he suggested you might have wanted to fix things between them for another reason.\u201d Jonah says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI think I need to meet his guy, it sounds like he\u2019s got\u00a0all my confusing feelings worked out,\u201d Cyrus jokes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can talk to me, if you want.\u201d Jonah says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now, I kind of want to avoid my problems until it all blows up in my face.\u201d Cyrus says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut when it all blows up?\u201d Jonah asks in a lightly joking manner.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely take you up on that offer to talk.\u201d Cyrus smiles.\u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019re okay with me being gay?\u201d He said it out loud for the second time, it still felt strange but it was getting easier.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jonah says genuinely,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Cyrus, nothing could change that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus can\u2019t help but smile at this, he was terrified of Jonah finding out his feelings in the past and he clearly had no reason to. Whilst Cyrus had no intention of bringing up his past crush with Jonah he did think that maybe one day he would be able to laugh about it with him.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus does stop by Jonah\u2019s house for a while to say hello to the Beck\u2019s before returning home. Cyrus\u2019 surprise chat with Jonah about his sexuality was enough for Cyrus to distract himself from obsessing over TJ.<br></p><p>Cyrus returns to find his mom cooking dinner and he offers to help. Cyrus\u2019 mother hums along to the radio that\u2019s lightly playing in the background whilst Cyrus remains quiet in thought.\u00a0The door bell rings and interrupts them both.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on that pot on the stove while I get the door.\u201d Leslie quickly bounces off towards the front of their house.</p><p>Cyrus stops chopping the vegetables and goes over to stir the pot. As he pops the lid back over the pot on the stove he hears his mother greet someone at the door in very welcoming way.</p><p>\u201cTJ, honey, hello.\u201d Leslie says and Cyrus tenses up. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen you in while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been sick this past week but I\u2019m fine now.\u201d TJ replies and Cyrus is hiding in the kitchen in a panic.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, come in. Cy is in the kitchen helping me with dinner.\u201d Leslie invites him in.</p><p>Cyrus seriously considered bailing, just leaving out the back door and never returning but Leslie had accompanied TJ into the kitchen before Cyrus could execute his escape plan.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy.\u201d TJ says gently as he hovers by the kitchen counter.</p><p>Cyrus pretends he was still stirring the pot on the stove, \u201cHey, TJ.\u201d He says casually without turning around.</p><p>\u201cYou boys go off into your room, Cy. I\u2019ll finish up with dinner,\u201d Leslie says as she pries the wooden spoon from Cyrus\u2019 hand. \u201cTJ you\u2019re welcome to stay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d TJ smiles,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know I love your cooking.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>Great, he\u2019s being charming,</i> Cyrus thinks to himself with a frown.\u00a0Without a word Cyrus sets off down the hall in the direction of his room. TJ is a step behind him and playfully steps on the back of Cyrus\u2019 shoe because he knew it annoyed the shorter boy but instead of reacting with an amusing sulky expression like TJ had expected, Cyrus just ignores him and continues on.</p><p>Cyrus hovers in his room whilst TJ takes a seat at the edge of Cyrus\u2019 bed, he picks up the tiny stuffed frog Cyrus had won and twirls it in his hand. Cyrus plants himself in the desk chair in the opposite corner of the room.\u00a0An awkward second that felt like an eternity to Cyrus passes.</p><p>\u201cSo..\u201d Cyrus says nervously. \u201cIs something up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d TJ shrugs a shoulder \u201c I just thought we could hang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just saw each other for lunch at the Spoon.\u201d Cyrus states.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t hung out twice in a day before.\u201d TJ acknowledges. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to be weird about it, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go.\u201d Cyrus says unconvingly and TJ still gets up to leave.</p><p>\u201cThe real reason I came here was to ask why you\u2019re being so weird with me.\u201d TJ says</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being weird.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cYes you are, I was worried I did something at the carnival-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t don\u2019t anything wrong.\u201d Cyrus interrupts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo why does it feel like you\u2019ve been avoiding me the past two days?\u201d TJ frowns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not avoiding you.\u201d Cyrus tries to look casual and not as anxious as he felt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou bailed straight after fireworks, you ignored my texts all day yesterday, you didn\u2019t tell me that \u201cBuffy, Andi and Jonah were back and you clearly didn\u2019t want me at The Spoon\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true and\u00a0I dropped my phone off the pier so I couldn\u2019t message you.\u201d Cyrus explains.</p><p>TJ wears a confused look and Cyrus just sighs and says it\u2019s a long story.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we fighting? This is kind of stupid.\u201d TJ tries to defuse things with a laugh but it felt forced.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ve hung out so much this summer we\u2019ve started to annoy each other,\u201d Cyrus spins the desk chair slightly and starts fiddling with something on his desk, his body angled away from TJ as he says, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good thing if we hang out with other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I spend all summer helping you with your stupid list but the second your other friends come home you\u2019re ready to bail?\u201d TJ looks hurt by Cyrus\u2019 suggestion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo now my list is stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the sudden I\u2019m annoying for helping you?\u201d TJ retorts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Cyrus frowns.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it sounded like.\u201d TJ says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cyrus, I\u2019ll just do the pier jump with Walker and Marty instead. \u201cYou have fun with your real friends now they\u2019re home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus wanted to stop TJ and explain why he\u2019s being so weird but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to. He thought maybe it was best if TJ and him weren\u2019t as close anymore. He felt guilty for this whole summer and now that Cyrus was aware of his feelings, it just felt wrong for them to be so close without TJ knowing the truth. Cyrus felt like a bad person, how could they ever have a sleepover again, or even have a harmless piggyback without feeling like he was doing something wrong. Cyrus never felt like this with Jonah but they were also new friends at the peak of his crush, they weren\u2019t really best friends until his feelings went away.\u00a0</p><p>After TJ storms out in a huff,\u00a0Cyrus goes over to the bed and picks up his little frog from the carnival that TJ dropped before exiting. Cyrus holds it in his hands as he flops down on his back. A short moment later Leslie is in Cyrus\u2019 doorway with a concerned expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI saw TJ leave, he seemed upset,\u201d Leslie frowns,\u00a0\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus thought about brushing it off. Smiling and telling his mother that everything was great but even after all the comforting chats he\u2019s had the past two days all he wanted to do was talk to his mom about it. Especially after this fight with TJ.</p><p>Before Cyrus could get any words out he starts crying. Within a second Leslie is by her sons side on the bed and she wraps her arms around him with a comforting embrace.\u00a0</p><p>Eventually Cyrus manages to stifle his sobs long enough to tell his mom everything. About his crush on Jonah, his confusion about being gay, his new crush on TJ and how he\u2019s pushed him away because he feels like he\u2019s being a bad person.\u00a0Leslie wipes tears from her sons damp cheeks and assures him he\u00a0has nothing to feel guilty for.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ hates me now.\u201d Cyrus says sadly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh cookie, he\u00a0doesn\u2019t hate you, I can assure you of this much.\u201d Leslie says with a small smile,\u00a0\u201cYou obviously mean a lot to him too so pushing him away wouldn\u2019t feel the best. He\u2019s just upset and doesn\u2019t understand why.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even understand why.\u201d Cyrus frowns and he felt the urge to start crying again. Leslie comforted Cyrus as long as he wanted her to. She didn\u2019t say\u00a0\u201coh I already knew\u201d or anything that made him feel like she had pre diagnosed him, nor did she say or do anything that made Cyrus feel like he was currently being analysed. It didn\u2019t feel like a therapy session between a doctor and her patient, it felt like the comforting motherly love Cyrus didnt know he needed until she was giving it.\u00a0<br></p><hr><p><b>End Notes:\u00a0</b>The next chapter is the<i> last one!!!! </i>There will be an epilogue and a bonus chapter after that.

Cyrus lays awake trying to make sense of his crush on TJ. At quarter to five in the morning, Cyrus is still wide awake and the faint ticks of the second hand from his wall clock were slowly driving him insane. Cyrus springs out of bed and changes into some casual clothes and he was far too frantic to perfectly craft his outfit like he usually would. </p><p>Cyrus makes his way out of the house and even though it\u2019s only 5am, the sun has begun to rise since it\u2019s summer. Cyrus power walks down the street with no real destination in mind but somewhere along the way he becomes set on a single idea and with that crazed thought in mind, Cyrus makes his way to the Shadyside pier. </p><p>Once at the seaside, Cyrus marches down the old wooden pier on a mission. As the end of the pier got closer, Cyrus\u2019 strides became slower and shorter, even with fear and panic beginning to kick in, Cyrus forces himself to the edge. With a deep breath Cyrus leans forward to look at the water bellow. The water was calm, not at all mirroring how Cyrus currently felt. </p><p><i>Do it,</i> Cyrus internally yells at himself, <i>it\u2019s just a little jump\u2026 and then a whole lot of ocean\u2026\u00a0</i>As Cyrus is leaning forward and staring into the ocean trying to force himself off the pier, his cell slips out of his pocket and splashes into water bellow. </p><p>\u201cNo no no!\u201d Cyrus whines as he watches it sink until it is no longer visible. \u201cJust my stinking luck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you talking to the fish, boy?\u201d A mans voice startles Cyrus and he was lucky he didn\u2019t fall off the edge of the pier when he jumped in fright. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI dropped my phone.\u201d Cyrus says defensively like he was in trouble. When Cyrus turns around he finds the man the voice belonged to. Just shy of the end of the pier was an old man fishing. Cyrus looks at him for a second and then realisation crosses his face, he knew this man. This was the old man Cyrus and TJ had spoken to at the beginning of summer, one half of the elderly couple TJ had asked to pick a number when they were beginning the list.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cI met you briefly at the beginning of summer.\u201d </p><p>The old man looks confused, \u201cI forget things a lot these days, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d Cyrus wears a sympathetic and sad smile, \u201cYou were with your wife of 60 years.\u201d </p><p>This makes the man grin from ear to ear. \u201cWould you like to sit down?\u201d He motions to the space beside him. Cyrus didn\u2019t know why but he accepts the mans invitation and very nervously sits himself down, although Cyrus was too frightened to let his feet dangle over the edge so instead he sits a small distance back to be safe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy name is William, what\u2019s yours?\u201d He introduces.</p><p>\u201cCyrus. Nice to officially meet you.\u201d Cyrus smiles politely. </p><p>\u201cWhat seems to be troubling you, Cyrus?\u201d William asks. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long and complicated story,\u201d Cyrus shakes his head, \u201cSo complicated I\u2019m\u00a0not sure I even understand it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got time,\u201d William gently shakes his fishing rod. </p><p>Cyrus is quiet for a second. Was he really going to open up to a complete stranger? Cyrus lets out a loud exhale and figures why not?\u00a0\u201cI think I have feelings for my friend..\u201d Cyrus chooses to be vague.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d William gives Cyrus a questioning look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll signs are pointing that way and I have no idea how it happened.\u201d Cyrus sighs, \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for the good part of a year now and somewhere along the way I \u2018allegedly\u2019,\u201d Cyrus dramatically uses are quotes,\u00a0\u201cdeveloped feelings for hi- them.\u201d </p><p>The old man pauses in thought like he was wracking his memories for something in particular, then he nods with a smile. </p><p>\u201cI remember you now.\u201d William says, \u201cYou and your friend were at the diner, playing with your food.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus laughs, \u201cYeah that\u2019s my friend TJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAn this is the same friend you have feelings for?\u201d William questions and Cyrus gives a sheepish nod as he had no idea how the man would react to Cyrus\u2019 feelings being for a boy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t like him back then?\u201d William asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Cyrus sighs again,\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know I liked him until last night, who knows when these so called feelings developed?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd why are you out here on the pier so early in the morning and not talking to your friend about how you feel?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know how I feel.\u201d Cyrus stresses. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to ruin our friendship.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a good friendship there\u2019s nothing you could say to ruin it.\u201d William says like a wise old man.\u00a0\u201cEven putting feelings out in the open.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s a nice idea but Cyrus knew that unrequited feelings definitely could make things difficult between them. \u201cI want to talk to him but I\u2019m scared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow does being on the pier help that?\u201d William questions.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus quickly summarises the list and how they\u2019ve been working through it all summer. \u201cI came to the pier with the intent to jump off it. This is supposed to be the thing I\u2019m most scared of on the list\u2026 If I could do this maybe I could face what I\u2019m actually afraid of.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhich are your feelings for your friend?\u201d William asks.</p><p>\u201cMy feelings in general.\u201d Cyrus frowns, \u201cEver since I realised I was different I\u2019ve avoided thinking about it. I don\u2019t know what I am.\u201d </p><p>William is quiet for a moment.\u00a0\u201cYou like a boy?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI liked a boy, past tense, but even that was more of a weird infatuation.\u201d Cyrus knits his brows,\u00a0\u201cMy current feelings are to be determined. Maybe I\u2019m just having a break down and TJ is being roped into that\u2026 Not that TJ isn\u2019t likeable, I mean he\u2019s always been so kind and supportive and tall-\u201d Cyrus stops abruptly and shakes his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d William chuckles and his old man laugh was comforting to Cyrus in a weird way,\u00a0\u201cAre you worried about liking this boy or what liking two boys means?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d Cyrus shrugs.\u00a0\u201cI guess deep down, I know I\u00a0like boys\u2026 exclusively\u2026\u201d Cyrus says with a squinted expression that makes it sound more like a question he wanted answered.</p><p>\u201cI think they have a word for that, son.\u201d The old man says with a quiet laugh. </p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019m gay,\u201d Cyrus says out loud for the first time ever and it was honestly a such a relief to admit it to himself more than anything, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I like, TJ\u2026\u201d Cyrus folds his arms with a huff and this causes William to laugh again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, son.\u201d William says and for some reason that was extremely comforting to hear, even from a perfect stranger.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus stays with William for over an hour. Cyrus was still too stressed to entertain the idea of liking TJ so he instead asks William about his marriage. Eventually Cyrus parts ways with William, he thanks the man for their conversation and makes his way home and even though admitting he was gay out loud for the first time was quite the relief, he still was no more certain about his feelings for TJ than he was last night.</p><p>Cyrus enters his house and closes the front door beside himself.</p><p>\u201cCyrus is that you?\u201d Todd, Cyrus\u2019 stepfathers, voice calls out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d Cyrus calls back and makes his way to the kitchen where his voice was coming from. </p><p>\u201cYou disappeared early this morning and you weren\u2019t answering your phone.\u201d Todd frowns.</p><p>Cyrus lets out a groan, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I went for a walk and I lost my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost it?\u201d Todd looks a little upset by this. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cyrus frowns and he decides to not get into the full story.\u00a0</p><p>Todd softens after noticing Cyrus\u2019 glum expression, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just <i>really</i> missing my friends.\u201d Cyrus says and this was an honest answer, it might not have been the whole truth but now more than ever, Cyrus wished he had the comfort of his best friends.</p><p>\u201cWell there\u2019s a little something in your room that might cheer you up.\u201d Todd says with a smile. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll talk to your mom about the phone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cyrus mumbles and he was doubtful anything could change his current mood but still he forces a smile for his stepdad\u2019s benefit. Cyrus sulks down the hall towards his bedroom. He pushes open his bedroom door and is speechless at the surprise waiting on the other side of it. Standing in his room with cheerful expressions was Andi, Buffy and Jonah and they all shout a joyful, \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are back?\u201d Cyrus\u2019 mouth hangs agape, \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be back for three more days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came home early to surprise you.\u201d Buffy says through a smile.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stand there the whole time or can we have a hug?\u201d Andi asks with her arms out wide. A group embrace follows and Cyrus had to try very hard to stop himself from crying, having his best friends back at a time when he needed them most was absolutely overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cTell us about your summer,\u201d Andi says, \u201cI want to know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Buffy says, \u201cI need you to explain to me again how you ended up becoming best pals with Walker and Marty of all people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd TJ.\u201d Jonah adds.</p><p>\u201cWe all already knew he liked, TJ.\u201d Buffy chuckles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Cyrus asks frantically.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cyrus, you were friends before summer.\u201d Buffy laughs.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head. <i>She means as friends. Of course she does</i>. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about my summer, tell me about your summer, I\u2019ve missed you guys so much!\u201d Cyrus tries to avoid thinking about TJ or making anyone suspicious about what was going on. \u201cAndi how was the road trip? Buffy, Jonah, how was camp?\u201d Cyrus asks. </p><p>The three sit around and all get reaqiunted, although they had surprised Cyrus, they had <i>all</i> been separated from each other this summer.<br> Even though Cyrus was ecstatic to have his friends home and genuinely interested in hearing about their adventures he couldn\u2019t help but let his mind wander back to his confusion over his feelings for TJ. </p><p>\u201cIs everything okay, Cy-Guy?\u201d Jonah questions. </p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d Cyrus nods. \u201cI just missed you guys so much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe missed you too.\u201d Andi says with a loving smile and she and\u00a0Cyrus exchange a lovey dovey look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go home and unpack my bag, hang out with my dad for a bit,\u201d Jonah gets up, \u201cI\u2019ll let the good hair crew catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave.\u201d Andi frowns.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You guys should talk.\u201d Jonah smiles, \u201cBut we should all go to The Spoon tomorrow?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed their baby taters and milkshakes so much.\u201d Buffy rubs her stomach. </p><p>\u201cCount me in.\u201d Andi says softly with a nod. </p><p>Once Jonah leaves, Cyrus could feel the mood in the room flip completely. Both girls were pointing quizzical looks at Cyrus and he felt like he was being interrogated. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell us what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Buffy asks. </p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head. </p><p>\u201cYou love talking about yourself,\u201d Buffy jokes with a soft laugh, \u201cHow come every time someone asked you about summer you\u2019ve deflected?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Andi questions, \u201cYou seemed to be having a blast with the \u2018bouncy boys\u2019-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not okay that you started a new crew.\u201d Buffy interjects.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Andi finishes her sentence.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus lets out a frustrated groan as he knew there was no hiding from his two best friends. \u201cI have a crush on TJ and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Cyrus folds his arms across his chest.</p><p>Buffy blinks with a blank expression for a moment whilst Andi is smiling. </p><p>\u201cYou two aren\u2019t acting surprised, why aren\u2019t you acting surprised?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised.\u201d Buffy states.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you you knew and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Cyrus is offended.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Andi laughs softly.\u00a0\u201cWe just thought you didn\u2019t want to tell us yet.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that I liked him.<i>\u00a0Allegedly.</i>\u201d Cyrus points his finger in the air.\u00a0\u201cI said I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about it.\u201d Andi says. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I want to talk about.\u201d Buffy agrees.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly sure you liked him, but hearing you talk about your summer over the phone made me think that maybe it was possible.\u201d Andi explains.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThe thought crossed my mind while we were still at school.\u201d Buffy shares.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cyrus questions.<br></p><p>\u201cI thought you liked Jonah?\u201d Andi questions,\u00a0\u201cDo you like both of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, his crush on Jonah is gone.\u201d Buffy shakes her head and then an idea crosses her face, \u201cDid it go away because you like TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like Jonah anymore?\u201d Andi questions, \u201cWhy didnt you tell me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Cyrus says.\u00a0\u201cAnd I told you I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bring something up and then not talk about it.\u201d Buffy states, \u201cIt\u2019s a good hair crew rule.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou broke that rule when you refused to tell me who your secret crush was.\u201d Cyrus retorts. </p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d Buffy whines. </p><p>\u201cYou have a secret crush?\u201d Andi questions, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Buffy shrugs. </p><p>\u201cIs it someone I know?\u201d Andi continues her questioning. \u201cWould I be hurt by your crush?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Buffy insists. </p><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Andi frowns.\u00a0\u201cWhy do you guys not tell me stuff anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you because I didn\u2019t want you to tell me I told me so.\u201d Buffy huffs. </p><p>\u201cWhy would I say that?\u201d Andi asks. </p><p>\u201cBecause her crush is on Marty\u2026\u201d Cyrus says as it clicked in his brain. </p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d Andi asks. \u201cFrom the party? As in the Marty that you virtually dated but for real turned down?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee!\u201d Buffy says, \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI knew you liked him back when you fake dated.\u201d Andi eyes Buffy. </p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Buffy folds her arms, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now because Marty has a girlfriend and nothing is ever going to come of my stupid crush.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMarty broke up with his girlfriend at the end of the school year,\u201d Cyrus informs her, \u201cDid I forget to mention that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Buffy says, \u201cBut it still doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt definitely matters!\u201d Cyrus says excitedly, \u201cMarty st-\u201c Cyrus stops himself. As much as he wanted to speculate about Marty\u2019s obvious intrest in Buffy still, Cyrus didn\u2019t want to do that to a friend. </p><p>\u201cMarty what?\u201d Buffy questions. </p><p>\u201cMarty is a great guy.\u201d Cyrus smiles. </p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Andi?\u201d Buffy turns the attention on someone else. \u201cHow was it seeing Jonah again?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWeird?\u201d Andi shrugs, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m happy to see him but it\u2019s been so long apart.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stop by his house tonight and talk alone?\u201d Buffy suggests. </p><p>\u201cThat can wait until tomorrow.\u201d Andi says. \u201cI want to stay here with you guys.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I want to know how my sweet and innocent best friend could like a toad like TJ Kippen.\u201d Buffy turns her head Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cBuffy!\u201d Cyrus frowns. </p><p>\u201cFine, since we\u2019re friends now I can be nicer,\u201d Buffy sighs, \u201cHe\u2019s a total frog, how could you like him?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus jumps up from his desk chair with a groan, Andi and Buffy who are sitting at the end of Cyrus\u2019 bed eye him for this outburst.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Cyrus repeats.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m too confused. I have no idea when I began to like him\u2026 I thought maybe it was when he helped me with the muffin but then I\u2019m pretty sure I was just surprised that he was being nice to me because he was a scary guy.\u201d Cyrus begins pacing around the room whist the two girls follow him with their eyes, \u201cThen I thought it could have been our first time on the swings because that was a really nice moment, it was the first time we really talked but I\u2019m pretty sure I was just intrigued by his softer side, I don\u2019t know if I like liked him back then.\u201d Cyrus stops dead in his tracks and scrunches up his face, \u201cWas it his apology rap?\u201d Cyrus begins his pacing again, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be there rap, of all the moments we\u2019ve shared, it couldn\u2019t possibly be the rap.. Could it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t want to talk about it you sure have a lot to say.\u201d Andi lets out a quiet laugh and Buffy nods with a knowing smile too. </p><p>\u201cWhat I want and need are clearly two different things.\u201d Cyrus sighs and he flops down on the bed between them.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I have a crush on him at all. Maybe I just like how nice he\u2019s been to me this summer and I\u2019m misplacing my feelings,\u201d Cyrus stares at the ceiling as he talks. \u201cWhen I liked Jonah I was nervous around him all the time, I couldn\u2019t think straight, I was so obsessed with him liking me or thinking I was cool but it\u2019s not like that with TJ. Since the swings I\u2019ve only ever been comfortable with him\u2026 I mean sure there is my surface level anxiety present but that\u2019s always there\u2026 Other than that, being around TJ is easy. I\u2019m not worried about him liking me because he\u2019s only ever encouraged me to be myself\u2026\u201d</p><p>Andi and Buffy both lay back beside Cyrus, their shoulders all brushing together. </p><p>\"You totally like him.\u201d Andi says with a smile pointed to the ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou <i>like,</i> like him.\u201d Buffy nudges Cyrus with a giggle.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Cyrus exhales with a frown.\u00a0\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou could tell him how you feel?\u201d Andi suggests.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou could lay here and avoid your feelings forever?\u201d Buffy jokes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI like that idea, let\u2019s do that.\u201d Cyrus is hopeful.\u00a0</p><p>Buffy rolls onto her side and looks at Cyrus,\u00a0\u201cI think TJ could like you back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus sits up and gives her an \u2018are you crazy?\u2019 look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious, Cyrus. Maybe it\u2019s wrong for me to speculate but I think it\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d Buffy says.\u00a0\u201cI could go see him and try and work it out-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Cyrus shuts that idea down.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just suppress your feelings for the rest of your life, Cyrus.\u201d Buffy coaxes her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell Marty how you feel?\u201d Cyrus challenges.\u00a0\u201cOr Andi, are you going to face the awkwardness between you and Jonah?\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t drag me into this, I\u2019m not pressuring you.\u201d Andi is still laying down as she whines.\u00a0<br></p><p>Buffy lays back down too,\u00a0\u201cProblem avoiding, party of three.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus rejoins them with a small smile,\u00a0\u201cI really missed you guys.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>The next day the four friends meet for an early lunch. Although Cyrus was still quietly obsessing over the TJ of it all, he was very much enjoying having Andi, Buffy and Jonah with him.\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019re still catching up about their individual summer escapades when the food arrives. Cyrus is only one baby tater in when the bell on the door chimes and the person entering sends him into a spiral. Both TJ and Marty enter.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, hi?\u201d TJ is surprised to see who Cyrus was seated with.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t think you got back for two days.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe missed each other so much we decided to come home early.\u201d Andi says with a sweet smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I already beat everyone at everything at camp,\u201d Buffy wears a smug grin,\u00a0\u201cIt was boring.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Marty smiles at this but doesn\u2019t directly comment. Buffy notably grows sheepish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you guys going to sit down?\u201d Jonah asks as the two boys were just hovering by the table.\u00a0<br></p><p>Marty pushes TJ to squish into the booth on Cyrus\u2019 side and he pulls over a chair and sits at the end of the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy\u00a0didn\u2019t you tell me they were back?\u201d TJ looks to Cyrus as he sits down. Cyrus can only offer up a shrug and goes back to eating his baby taters.\u00a0</p><p>As time passes things only got more awkward. Cyrus was closed off completely and not contributing to the conversation unless directly called upon. To make it worse he felt like he was being analysed by Buffy and Andi as they were interested to see the dynamic between Cyrus and TJ. Marty was acting strange like he had been for a few days now and Cyrus wanted nothing more than to bail.\u00a0</p><p>After everyone is finished eating they were all just lingering around to chat. Cyrus spent five minutes mentally trying to find an excuse to leave. Before he can offer up an obvious lie, Jonah says he\u2019s got to go and asked if Cyrus wanted to walk him home as his mother said she missed him. Cyrus jumps on the opportunity to escape and leaves without really saying goodbye properly.\u00a0</p><p>Once outside the two begin walking and Jonah appeared to be in thought, like he was trying to figure out what to say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t really say she missed you.\u201d Jonah says and Cyrus looks hurt by this, Jonah lets out nervous laugh,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure she does miss you, it just looked like you needed an excuse to leave.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWas it that obvious?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid something happen between you guys?\u201d Jonah questions.\u00a0\u201cIs this why you seemed kinda down yesterday?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus frowns to himself, this conversation was flaring up his anxiety greatly. He couldn\u2019t talk to Jonah, not about this.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Cyrus shakes his head,\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you can,\u201d Jonah says,\u00a0\u201cIf you want\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus felt Jonah\u2019s side stare and he stops in his tracks causing Jonah to as well. Cyrus studies Jonah\u2019s expression and knits his brows in response,\u00a0\u201cYou know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat you<i> like</i> TJ?\u201d Jonah asks softly.\u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d He nods.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201d Cyrus can\u2019t even finish his question, he just looks at Jonah in a state of shock.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m kind of oblivious sometimes,\u201d Jonah laughs at his own expense,\u00a0\u201cBut I roomed with this kid at camp, he opened my eyes up to a lot of stuff going on around me that I missed.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Cyrus asks nervously.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFor like three whole months I thought you had a crush on Buffy.\u201d Jonah laughs.\u00a0\u201cI was very wrong about that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOn Buffy?\u201d Cyrus chokes on his own laugh.\u00a0\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you wanted to fix her TJ problem-\u201d Jonah shakes his head embarrassed,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking okay.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus laughs at this and he couldn\u2019t believe he was having a discussion with Jonah Beck about his feelings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen he suggested you might have wanted to fix things between them for another reason.\u201d Jonah says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI think I need to meet his guy, it sounds like he\u2019s got\u00a0all my confusing feelings worked out,\u201d Cyrus jokes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can talk to me, if you want.\u201d Jonah says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now, I kind of want to avoid my problems until it all blows up in my face.\u201d Cyrus says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut when it all blows up?\u201d Jonah asks in a lightly joking manner.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely take you up on that offer to talk.\u201d Cyrus smiles.\u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019re okay with me being gay?\u201d He said it out loud for the second time, it still felt strange but it was getting easier.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jonah says genuinely,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Cyrus, nothing could change that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus can\u2019t help but smile at this, he was terrified of Jonah finding out his feelings in the past and he clearly had no reason to. Whilst Cyrus had no intention of bringing up his past crush with Jonah he did think that maybe one day he would be able to laugh about it with him.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus does stop by Jonah\u2019s house for a while to say hello to the Beck\u2019s before returning home. Cyrus\u2019 surprise chat with Jonah about his sexuality was enough for Cyrus to distract himself from obsessing over TJ.<br></p><p>Cyrus returns to find his mom cooking dinner and he offers to help. Cyrus\u2019 mother hums along to the radio that\u2019s lightly playing in the background whilst Cyrus remains quiet in thought.\u00a0The door bell rings and interrupts them both.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on that pot on the stove while I get the door.\u201d Leslie quickly bounces off towards the front of their house.</p><p>Cyrus stops chopping the vegetables and goes over to stir the pot. As he pops the lid back over the pot on the stove he hears his mother greet someone at the door in very welcoming way.</p><p>\u201cTJ, honey, hello.\u201d Leslie says and Cyrus tenses up. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen you in while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been sick this past week but I\u2019m fine now.\u201d TJ replies and Cyrus is hiding in the kitchen in a panic.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, come in. Cy is in the kitchen helping me with dinner.\u201d Leslie invites him in.</p><p>Cyrus seriously considered bailing, just leaving out the back door and never returning but Leslie had accompanied TJ into the kitchen before Cyrus could execute his escape plan.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy.\u201d TJ says gently as he hovers by the kitchen counter.</p><p>Cyrus pretends he was still stirring the pot on the stove, \u201cHey, TJ.\u201d He says casually without turning around.</p><p>\u201cYou boys go off into your room, Cy. I\u2019ll finish up with dinner,\u201d Leslie says as she pries the wooden spoon from Cyrus\u2019 hand. \u201cTJ you\u2019re welcome to stay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d TJ smiles,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know I love your cooking.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>Great, he\u2019s being charming,</i> Cyrus thinks to himself with a frown.\u00a0Without a word Cyrus sets off down the hall in the direction of his room. TJ is a step behind him and playfully steps on the back of Cyrus\u2019 shoe because he knew it annoyed the shorter boy but instead of reacting with an amusing sulky expression like TJ had expected, Cyrus just ignores him and continues on.</p><p>Cyrus hovers in his room whilst TJ takes a seat at the edge of Cyrus\u2019 bed, he picks up the tiny stuffed frog Cyrus had won and twirls it in his hand. Cyrus plants himself in the desk chair in the opposite corner of the room.\u00a0An awkward second that felt like an eternity to Cyrus passes.</p><p>\u201cSo..\u201d Cyrus says nervously. \u201cIs something up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d TJ shrugs a shoulder \u201c I just thought we could hang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just saw each other for lunch at the Spoon.\u201d Cyrus states.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t hung out twice in a day before.\u201d TJ acknowledges. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to be weird about it, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go.\u201d Cyrus says unconvingly and TJ still gets up to leave.</p><p>\u201cThe real reason I came here was to ask why you\u2019re being so weird with me.\u201d TJ says</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being weird.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cYes you are, I was worried I did something at the carnival-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t don\u2019t anything wrong.\u201d Cyrus interrupts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo why does it feel like you\u2019ve been avoiding me the past two days?\u201d TJ frowns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not avoiding you.\u201d Cyrus tries to look casual and not as anxious as he felt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou bailed straight after fireworks, you ignored my texts all day yesterday, you didn\u2019t tell me that \u201cBuffy, Andi and Jonah were back and you clearly didn\u2019t want me at The Spoon\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true and\u00a0I dropped my phone off the pier so I couldn\u2019t message you.\u201d Cyrus explains.</p><p>TJ wears a confused look and Cyrus just sighs and says it\u2019s a long story.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we fighting? This is kind of stupid.\u201d TJ tries to defuse things with a laugh but it felt forced.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ve hung out so much this summer we\u2019ve started to annoy each other,\u201d Cyrus spins the desk chair slightly and starts fiddling with something on his desk, his body angled away from TJ as he says, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good thing if we hang out with other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I spend all summer helping you with your stupid list but the second your other friends come home you\u2019re ready to bail?\u201d TJ looks hurt by Cyrus\u2019 suggestion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo now my list is stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the sudden I\u2019m annoying for helping you?\u201d TJ retorts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Cyrus frowns.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it sounded like.\u201d TJ says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cyrus, I\u2019ll just do the pier jump with Walker and Marty instead. \u201cYou have fun with your real friends now they\u2019re home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus wanted to stop TJ and explain why he\u2019s being so weird but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to. He thought maybe it was best if TJ and him weren\u2019t as close anymore. He felt guilty for this whole summer and now that Cyrus was aware of his feelings, it just felt wrong for them to be so close without TJ knowing the truth. Cyrus felt like a bad person, how could they ever have a sleepover again, or even have a harmless piggyback without feeling like he was doing something wrong. Cyrus never felt like this with Jonah but they were also new friends at the peak of his crush, they weren\u2019t really best friends until his feelings went away.\u00a0</p><p>After TJ storms out in a huff,\u00a0Cyrus goes over to the bed and picks up his little frog from the carnival that TJ dropped before exiting. Cyrus holds it in his hands as he flops down on his back. A short moment later Leslie is in Cyrus\u2019 doorway with a concerned expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI saw TJ leave, he seemed upset,\u201d Leslie frowns,\u00a0\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus thought about brushing it off. Smiling and telling his mother that everything was great but even after all the comforting chats he\u2019s had the past two days all he wanted to do was talk to his mom about it. Especially after this fight with TJ.</p><p>Before Cyrus could get any words out he starts crying. Within a second Leslie is by her sons side on the bed and she wraps her arms around him with a comforting embrace.\u00a0</p><p>Eventually Cyrus manages to stifle his sobs long enough to tell his mom everything. About his crush on Jonah, his confusion about being gay, his new crush on TJ and how he\u2019s pushed him away because he feels like he\u2019s being a bad person.\u00a0Leslie wipes tears from her sons damp cheeks and assures him he\u00a0has nothing to feel guilty for.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ hates me now.\u201d Cyrus says sadly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh cookie, he\u00a0doesn\u2019t hate you, I can assure you of this much.\u201d Leslie says with a small smile,\u00a0\u201cYou obviously mean a lot to him too so pushing him away wouldn\u2019t feel the best. He\u2019s just upset and doesn\u2019t understand why.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even understand why.\u201d Cyrus frowns and he felt the urge to start crying again. Leslie comforted Cyrus as long as he wanted her to. She didn\u2019t say\u00a0\u201coh I already knew\u201d or anything that made him feel like she had pre diagnosed him, nor did she say or do anything that made Cyrus feel like he was currently being analysed. It didn\u2019t feel like a therapy session between a doctor and her patient, it felt like the comforting motherly love Cyrus didnt know he needed until she was giving it.\u00a0<br></p><hr><p><b>End Notes:\u00a0</b>The next chapter is the<i> last one!!!! </i>There will be an epilogue and a bonus chapter after that.

Cyrus lays awake trying to make sense of his crush on TJ. At quarter to five in the morning, Cyrus is still wide awake and the faint ticks of the second hand from his wall clock were slowly driving him insane. Cyrus springs out of bed and changes into some casual clothes and he was far too frantic to perfectly craft his outfit like he usually would. </p><p>Cyrus makes his way out of the house and even though it&rsquo;s only 5am, the sun has begun to rise since it&rsquo;s summer. Cyrus power walks down the street with no real destination in mind but somewhere along the way he becomes set on a single idea and with that crazed thought in mind, Cyrus makes his way to the Shadyside pier. </p><p>Once at the seaside, Cyrus marches down the old wooden pier on a mission. As the end of the pier got closer, Cyrus&rsquo; strides became slower and shorter, even with fear and panic beginning to kick in, Cyrus forces himself to the edge. With a deep breath Cyrus leans forward to look at the water bellow. The water was calm, not at all mirroring how Cyrus currently felt. </p><p><i>Do it,</i> Cyrus internally yells at himself, <i>it&rsquo;s just a little jump&hellip; and then a whole lot of ocean&hellip;&nbsp;</i>As Cyrus is leaning forward and staring into the ocean trying to force himself off the pier, his cell slips out of his pocket and splashes into water bellow. </p><p>&ldquo;No no no!&rdquo; Cyrus whines as he watches it sink until it is no longer visible. &ldquo;Just my stinking luck.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you talking to the fish, boy?&rdquo; A mans voice startles Cyrus and he was lucky he didn&rsquo;t fall off the edge of the pier when he jumped in fright. </p><p>&ldquo;I dropped my phone.&rdquo; Cyrus says defensively like he was in trouble. When Cyrus turns around he finds the man the voice belonged to. Just shy of the end of the pier was an old man fishing. Cyrus looks at him for a second and then realisation crosses his face, he knew this man. This was the old man Cyrus and TJ had spoken to at the beginning of summer, one half of the elderly couple TJ had asked to pick a number when they were beginning the list.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you.&rdquo; Cyrus says. &ldquo;I met you briefly at the beginning of summer.&rdquo; </p><p>The old man looks confused, &ldquo;I forget things a lot these days, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; Cyrus wears a sympathetic and sad smile, &ldquo;You were with your wife of 60 years.&rdquo; </p><p>This makes the man grin from ear to ear. &ldquo;Would you like to sit down?&rdquo; He motions to the space beside him. Cyrus didn&rsquo;t know why but he accepts the mans invitation and very nervously sits himself down, although Cyrus was too frightened to let his feet dangle over the edge so instead he sits a small distance back to be safe.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is William, what&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo; He introduces.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus. Nice to officially meet you.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles politely. </p><p>&ldquo;What seems to be troubling you, Cyrus?&rdquo; William asks. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long and complicated story,&rdquo; Cyrus shakes his head, &ldquo;So complicated I&rsquo;m&nbsp;not sure I even understand it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got time,&rdquo; William gently shakes his fishing rod. </p><p>Cyrus is quiet for a second. Was he really going to open up to a complete stranger? Cyrus lets out a loud exhale and figures why not?&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I have feelings for my friend..&rdquo; Cyrus chooses to be vague.</p><p>&ldquo;You think?&rdquo; William gives Cyrus a questioning look.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;All signs are pointing that way and I have no idea how it happened.&rdquo; Cyrus sighs, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been friends for the good part of a year now and somewhere along the way I &lsquo;allegedly&rsquo;,&rdquo; Cyrus dramatically uses are quotes,&nbsp;&ldquo;developed feelings for hi- them.&rdquo; </p><p>The old man pauses in thought like he was wracking his memories for something in particular, then he nods with a smile. </p><p>&ldquo;I remember you now.&rdquo; William says, &ldquo;You and your friend were at the diner, playing with your food.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus laughs, &ldquo;Yeah that&rsquo;s my friend TJ.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;An this is the same friend you have feelings for?&rdquo; William questions and Cyrus gives a sheepish nod as he had no idea how the man would react to Cyrus&rsquo; feelings being for a boy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t like him back then?&rdquo; William asks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point,&rdquo; Cyrus sighs again,&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I liked him until last night, who knows when these so called feelings developed?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And why are you out here on the pier so early in the morning and not talking to your friend about how you feel?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t know how I feel.&rdquo; Cyrus stresses. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want to ruin our friendship.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a good friendship there&rsquo;s nothing you could say to ruin it.&rdquo; William says like a wise old man.&nbsp;&ldquo;Even putting feelings out in the open.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s a nice idea but Cyrus knew that unrequited feelings definitely could make things difficult between them. &ldquo;I want to talk to him but I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How does being on the pier help that?&rdquo; William questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus quickly summarises the list and how they&rsquo;ve been working through it all summer. &ldquo;I came to the pier with the intent to jump off it. This is supposed to be the thing I&rsquo;m most scared of on the list&hellip; If I could do this maybe I could face what I&rsquo;m actually afraid of.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Which are your feelings for your friend?&rdquo; William asks.</p><p>&ldquo;My feelings in general.&rdquo; Cyrus frowns, &ldquo;Ever since I realised I was different I&rsquo;ve avoided thinking about it. I don&rsquo;t know what I am.&rdquo; </p><p>William is quiet for a moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;You like a boy?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I liked a boy, past tense, but even that was more of a weird infatuation.&rdquo; Cyrus knits his brows,&nbsp;&ldquo;My current feelings are to be determined. Maybe I&rsquo;m just having a break down and TJ is being roped into that&hellip; Not that TJ isn&rsquo;t likeable, I mean he&rsquo;s always been so kind and supportive and tall-&rdquo; Cyrus stops abruptly and shakes his head.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; William chuckles and his old man laugh was comforting to Cyrus in a weird way,&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you worried about liking this boy or what liking two boys means?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Both.&rdquo; Cyrus shrugs.&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess deep down, I know I&nbsp;like boys&hellip; exclusively&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus says with a squinted expression that makes it sound more like a question he wanted answered.</p><p>&ldquo;I think they have a word for that, son.&rdquo; The old man says with a quiet laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so I&rsquo;m gay,&rdquo; Cyrus says out loud for the first time ever and it was honestly a such a relief to admit it to himself more than anything, &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean I like, TJ&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus folds his arms with a huff and this causes William to laugh again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be okay, son.&rdquo; William says and for some reason that was extremely comforting to hear, even from a perfect stranger.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus stays with William for over an hour. Cyrus was still too stressed to entertain the idea of liking TJ so he instead asks William about his marriage. Eventually Cyrus parts ways with William, he thanks the man for their conversation and makes his way home and even though admitting he was gay out loud for the first time was quite the relief, he still was no more certain about his feelings for TJ than he was last night.</p><p>Cyrus enters his house and closes the front door beside himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus is that you?&rdquo; Todd, Cyrus&rsquo; stepfathers, voice calls out.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; Cyrus calls back and makes his way to the kitchen where his voice was coming from. </p><p>&ldquo;You disappeared early this morning and you weren&rsquo;t answering your phone.&rdquo; Todd frowns.</p><p>Cyrus lets out a groan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I went for a walk and I lost my phone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You lost it?&rdquo; Todd looks a little upset by this. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Cyrus frowns and he decides to not get into the full story.&nbsp;</p><p>Todd softens after noticing Cyrus&rsquo; glum expression, &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just <i>really</i> missing my friends.&rdquo; Cyrus says and this was an honest answer, it might not have been the whole truth but now more than ever, Cyrus wished he had the comfort of his best friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Well there&rsquo;s a little something in your room that might cheer you up.&rdquo; Todd says with a smile. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll talk to your mom about the phone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbles and he was doubtful anything could change his current mood but still he forces a smile for his stepdad&rsquo;s benefit. Cyrus sulks down the hall towards his bedroom. He pushes open his bedroom door and is speechless at the surprise waiting on the other side of it. Standing in his room with cheerful expressions was Andi, Buffy and Jonah and they all shout a joyful, &ldquo;Surprise!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You guys are back?&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo; mouth hangs agape, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to be back for three more days!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We came home early to surprise you.&rdquo; Buffy says through a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to stand there the whole time or can we have a hug?&rdquo; Andi asks with her arms out wide. A group embrace follows and Cyrus had to try very hard to stop himself from crying, having his best friends back at a time when he needed them most was absolutely overwhelming.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell us about your summer,&rdquo; Andi says, &ldquo;I want to know everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; Buffy says, &ldquo;I need you to explain to me again how you ended up becoming best pals with Walker and Marty of all people?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And TJ.&rdquo; Jonah adds.</p><p>&ldquo;We all already knew he liked, TJ.&rdquo; Buffy chuckles.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Cyrus asks frantically.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Cyrus, you were friends before summer.&rdquo; Buffy laughs.</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Cyrus shakes his head. <i>She means as friends. Of course she does</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about my summer, tell me about your summer, I&rsquo;ve missed you guys so much!&rdquo; Cyrus tries to avoid thinking about TJ or making anyone suspicious about what was going on. &ldquo;Andi how was the road trip? Buffy, Jonah, how was camp?&rdquo; Cyrus asks. </p><p>The three sit around and all get reaqiunted, although they had surprised Cyrus, they had <i>all</i> been separated from each other this summer.<br /> Even though Cyrus was ecstatic to have his friends home and genuinely interested in hearing about their adventures he couldn&rsquo;t help but let his mind wander back to his confusion over his feelings for TJ. </p><p>&ldquo;Is everything okay, Cy-Guy?&rdquo; Jonah questions. </p><p>&ldquo;Totally.&rdquo; Cyrus nods. &ldquo;I just missed you guys so much.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We missed you too.&rdquo; Andi says with a loving smile and she and&nbsp;Cyrus exchange a lovey dovey look.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to go home and unpack my bag, hang out with my dad for a bit,&rdquo; Jonah gets up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let the good hair crew catch up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to leave.&rdquo; Andi frowns.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. You guys should talk.&rdquo; Jonah smiles, &ldquo;But we should all go to The Spoon tomorrow?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed their baby taters and milkshakes so much.&rdquo; Buffy rubs her stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;Count me in.&rdquo; Andi says softly with a nod. </p><p>Once Jonah leaves, Cyrus could feel the mood in the room flip completely. Both girls were pointing quizzical looks at Cyrus and he felt like he was being interrogated. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell us what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Buffy asks. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing is wrong.&rdquo; Cyrus shakes his head. </p><p>&ldquo;You love talking about yourself,&rdquo; Buffy jokes with a soft laugh, &ldquo;How come every time someone asked you about summer you&rsquo;ve deflected?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Did something happen?&rdquo; Andi questions, &ldquo;You seemed to be having a blast with the &lsquo;bouncy boys&rsquo;-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still not okay that you started a new crew.&rdquo; Buffy interjects.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Andi finishes her sentence.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus lets out a frustrated groan as he knew there was no hiding from his two best friends. &ldquo;I have a crush on TJ and I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo; Cyrus folds his arms across his chest.</p><p>Buffy blinks with a blank expression for a moment whilst Andi is smiling. </p><p>&ldquo;You two aren&rsquo;t acting surprised, why aren&rsquo;t you acting surprised?&rdquo; Cyrus questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not surprised.&rdquo; Buffy states.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re telling me you you knew and didn&rsquo;t tell me?&rdquo; Cyrus is offended.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; Andi laughs softly.&nbsp;&ldquo;We just thought you didn&rsquo;t want to tell us yet.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know that I liked him.<i>&nbsp;Allegedly.</i>&rdquo; Cyrus points his finger in the air.&nbsp;&ldquo;I said I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to talk about it.&rdquo; Andi says. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I want to talk about.&rdquo; Buffy agrees.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure you liked him, but hearing you talk about your summer over the phone made me think that maybe it was possible.&rdquo; Andi explains.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The thought crossed my mind while we were still at school.&rdquo; Buffy shares.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Cyrus questions.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I thought you liked Jonah?&rdquo; Andi questions,&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you like both of them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, his crush on Jonah is gone.&rdquo; Buffy shakes her head and then an idea crosses her face, &ldquo;Did it go away because you like TJ?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Jonah anymore?&rdquo; Andi questions, &ldquo;Why didnt you tell me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Cyrus says.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I told you I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t bring something up and then not talk about it.&rdquo; Buffy states, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good hair crew rule.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You broke that rule when you refused to tell me who your secret crush was.&rdquo; Cyrus retorts. </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus!&rdquo; Buffy whines. </p><p>&ldquo;You have a secret crush?&rdquo; Andi questions, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Buffy shrugs. </p><p>&ldquo;Is it someone I know?&rdquo; Andi continues her questioning. &ldquo;Would I be hurt by your crush?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Buffy insists. </p><p>&ldquo;Then why can&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; Andi frowns.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why do you guys not tell me stuff anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you because I didn&rsquo;t want you to tell me I told me so.&rdquo; Buffy huffs. </p><p>&ldquo;Why would I say that?&rdquo; Andi asks. </p><p>&ldquo;Because her crush is on Marty&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus says as it clicked in his brain. </p><p>&ldquo;Marty?&rdquo; Andi asks. &ldquo;From the party? As in the Marty that you virtually dated but for real turned down?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Buffy says, &ldquo;This is why I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I knew you liked him back when you fake dated.&rdquo; Andi eyes Buffy. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; Buffy folds her arms, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter now because Marty has a girlfriend and nothing is ever going to come of my stupid crush.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Marty broke up with his girlfriend at the end of the school year,&rdquo; Cyrus informs her, &ldquo;Did I forget to mention that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Buffy says, &ldquo;But it still doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It definitely matters!&rdquo; Cyrus says excitedly, &ldquo;Marty st-&ldquo; Cyrus stops himself. As much as he wanted to speculate about Marty&rsquo;s obvious intrest in Buffy still, Cyrus didn&rsquo;t want to do that to a friend. </p><p>&ldquo;Marty what?&rdquo; Buffy questions. </p><p>&ldquo;Marty is a great guy.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles. </p><p>&ldquo;What about you, Andi?&rdquo; Buffy turns the attention on someone else. &ldquo;How was it seeing Jonah again?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Weird?&rdquo; Andi shrugs, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m happy to see him but it&rsquo;s been so long apart.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should stop by his house tonight and talk alone?&rdquo; Buffy suggests. </p><p>&ldquo;That can wait until tomorrow.&rdquo; Andi says. &ldquo;I want to stay here with you guys.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And I want to know how my sweet and innocent best friend could like a toad like TJ Kippen.&rdquo; Buffy turns her head Cyrus. </p><p>&ldquo;Buffy!&rdquo; Cyrus frowns. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine, since we&rsquo;re friends now I can be nicer,&rdquo; Buffy sighs, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a total frog, how could you like him?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus jumps up from his desk chair with a groan, Andi and Buffy who are sitting at the end of Cyrus&rsquo; bed eye him for this outburst.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo; Cyrus repeats.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too confused. I have no idea when I began to like him&hellip; I thought maybe it was when he helped me with the muffin but then I&rsquo;m pretty sure I was just surprised that he was being nice to me because he was a scary guy.&rdquo; Cyrus begins pacing around the room whist the two girls follow him with their eyes, &ldquo;Then I thought it could have been our first time on the swings because that was a really nice moment, it was the first time we really talked but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I was just intrigued by his softer side, I don&rsquo;t know if I like liked him back then.&rdquo; Cyrus stops dead in his tracks and scrunches up his face, &ldquo;Was it his apology rap?&rdquo; Cyrus begins his pacing again, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be there rap, of all the moments we&rsquo;ve shared, it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be the rap.. Could it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For someone who doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about it you sure have a lot to say.&rdquo; Andi lets out a quiet laugh and Buffy nods with a knowing smile too. </p><p>&ldquo;What I want and need are clearly two different things.&rdquo; Cyrus sighs and he flops down on the bed between them.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know if I have a crush on him at all. Maybe I just like how nice he&rsquo;s been to me this summer and I&rsquo;m misplacing my feelings,&rdquo; Cyrus stares at the ceiling as he talks. &ldquo;When I liked Jonah I was nervous around him all the time, I couldn&rsquo;t think straight, I was so obsessed with him liking me or thinking I was cool but it&rsquo;s not like that with TJ. Since the swings I&rsquo;ve only ever been comfortable with him&hellip; I mean sure there is my surface level anxiety present but that&rsquo;s always there&hellip; Other than that, being around TJ is easy. I&rsquo;m not worried about him liking me because he&rsquo;s only ever encouraged me to be myself&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Andi and Buffy both lay back beside Cyrus, their shoulders all brushing together. </p><p>\"You totally like him.&rdquo; Andi says with a smile pointed to the ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>like,</i> like him.&rdquo; Buffy nudges Cyrus with a giggle.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Cyrus exhales with a frown.&nbsp;&ldquo;What am I going to do?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You could tell him how you feel?&rdquo; Andi suggests.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not.&rdquo; Cyrus shakes his head.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You could lay here and avoid your feelings forever?&rdquo; Buffy jokes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I like that idea, let&rsquo;s do that.&rdquo; Cyrus is hopeful.&nbsp;</p><p>Buffy rolls onto her side and looks at Cyrus,&nbsp;&ldquo;I think TJ could like you back.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus sits up and gives her an &lsquo;are you crazy?&rsquo; look.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being serious, Cyrus. Maybe it&rsquo;s wrong for me to speculate but I think it&rsquo;s possible&hellip;&rdquo; Buffy says.&nbsp;&ldquo;I could go see him and try and work it out-&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No way.&rdquo; Cyrus shuts that idea down.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just suppress your feelings for the rest of your life, Cyrus.&rdquo; Buffy coaxes her head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell Marty how you feel?&rdquo; Cyrus challenges.&nbsp;&ldquo;Or Andi, are you going to face the awkwardness between you and Jonah?&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t drag me into this, I&rsquo;m not pressuring you.&rdquo; Andi is still laying down as she whines.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Buffy lays back down too,&nbsp;&ldquo;Problem avoiding, party of three.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus rejoins them with a small smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;I really missed you guys.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>The next day the four friends meet for an early lunch. Although Cyrus was still quietly obsessing over the TJ of it all, he was very much enjoying having Andi, Buffy and Jonah with him.&nbsp;</p><p>They&rsquo;re still catching up about their individual summer escapades when the food arrives. Cyrus is only one baby tater in when the bell on the door chimes and the person entering sends him into a spiral. Both TJ and Marty enter.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, hi?&rdquo; TJ is surprised to see who Cyrus was seated with.&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you got back for two days.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We missed each other so much we decided to come home early.&rdquo; Andi says with a sweet smile.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And I already beat everyone at everything at camp,&rdquo; Buffy wears a smug grin,&nbsp;&ldquo;It was boring.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Marty smiles at this but doesn&rsquo;t directly comment. Buffy notably grows sheepish.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you guys going to sit down?&rdquo; Jonah asks as the two boys were just hovering by the table.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Marty pushes TJ to squish into the booth on Cyrus&rsquo; side and he pulls over a chair and sits at the end of the table.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t you tell me they were back?&rdquo; TJ looks to Cyrus as he sits down. Cyrus can only offer up a shrug and goes back to eating his baby taters.&nbsp;</p><p>As time passes things only got more awkward. Cyrus was closed off completely and not contributing to the conversation unless directly called upon. To make it worse he felt like he was being analysed by Buffy and Andi as they were interested to see the dynamic between Cyrus and TJ. Marty was acting strange like he had been for a few days now and Cyrus wanted nothing more than to bail.&nbsp;</p><p>After everyone is finished eating they were all just lingering around to chat. Cyrus spent five minutes mentally trying to find an excuse to leave. Before he can offer up an obvious lie, Jonah says he&rsquo;s got to go and asked if Cyrus wanted to walk him home as his mother said she missed him. Cyrus jumps on the opportunity to escape and leaves without really saying goodbye properly.&nbsp;</p><p>Once outside the two begin walking and Jonah appeared to be in thought, like he was trying to figure out what to say.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My mom didn&rsquo;t really say she missed you.&rdquo; Jonah says and Cyrus looks hurt by this, Jonah lets out nervous laugh,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she does miss you, it just looked like you needed an excuse to leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Was it that obvious?&rdquo; Cyrus questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did something happen between you guys?&rdquo; Jonah questions.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is this why you seemed kinda down yesterday?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus frowns to himself, this conversation was flaring up his anxiety greatly. He couldn&rsquo;t talk to Jonah, not about this.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Cyrus shakes his head,&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But you can,&rdquo; Jonah says,&nbsp;&ldquo;If you want&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus felt Jonah&rsquo;s side stare and he stops in his tracks causing Jonah to as well. Cyrus studies Jonah&rsquo;s expression and knits his brows in response,&nbsp;&ldquo;You know?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That you<i> like</i> TJ?&rdquo; Jonah asks softly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He nods.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How did you-&rdquo; Cyrus can&rsquo;t even finish his question, he just looks at Jonah in a state of shock.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m kind of oblivious sometimes,&rdquo; Jonah laughs at his own expense,&nbsp;&ldquo;But I roomed with this kid at camp, he opened my eyes up to a lot of stuff going on around me that I missed.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He did?&rdquo; Cyrus asks nervously.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;For like three whole months I thought you had a crush on Buffy.&rdquo; Jonah laughs.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was very wrong about that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;On Buffy?&rdquo; Cyrus chokes on his own laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why would you think that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you wanted to fix her TJ problem-&rdquo; Jonah shakes his head embarrassed,&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking okay.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus laughs at this and he couldn&rsquo;t believe he was having a discussion with Jonah Beck about his feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Then he suggested you might have wanted to fix things between them for another reason.&rdquo; Jonah says.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think I need to meet his guy, it sounds like he&rsquo;s got&nbsp;all my confusing feelings worked out,&rdquo; Cyrus jokes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can talk to me, if you want.&rdquo; Jonah says.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk right now, I kind of want to avoid my problems until it all blows up in my face.&rdquo; Cyrus says.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But when it all blows up?&rdquo; Jonah asks in a lightly joking manner.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll definitely take you up on that offer to talk.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles.&nbsp;&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re okay with me being gay?&rdquo; He said it out loud for the second time, it still felt strange but it was getting easier.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Jonah says genuinely,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best, Cyrus, nothing could change that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus can&rsquo;t help but smile at this, he was terrified of Jonah finding out his feelings in the past and he clearly had no reason to. Whilst Cyrus had no intention of bringing up his past crush with Jonah he did think that maybe one day he would be able to laugh about it with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus does stop by Jonah&rsquo;s house for a while to say hello to the Beck&rsquo;s before returning home. Cyrus&rsquo; surprise chat with Jonah about his sexuality was enough for Cyrus to distract himself from obsessing over TJ.<br /></p><p>Cyrus returns to find his mom cooking dinner and he offers to help. Cyrus&rsquo; mother hums along to the radio that&rsquo;s lightly playing in the background whilst Cyrus remains quiet in thought.&nbsp;The door bell rings and interrupts them both.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Keep an eye on that pot on the stove while I get the door.&rdquo; Leslie quickly bounces off towards the front of their house.</p><p>Cyrus stops chopping the vegetables and goes over to stir the pot. As he pops the lid back over the pot on the stove he hears his mother greet someone at the door in very welcoming way.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, honey, hello.&rdquo; Leslie says and Cyrus tenses up. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen you in while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been sick this past week but I&rsquo;m fine now.&rdquo; TJ replies and Cyrus is hiding in the kitchen in a panic.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, come in. Cy is in the kitchen helping me with dinner.&rdquo; Leslie invites him in.</p><p>Cyrus seriously considered bailing, just leaving out the back door and never returning but Leslie had accompanied TJ into the kitchen before Cyrus could execute his escape plan.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Cy.&rdquo; TJ says gently as he hovers by the kitchen counter.</p><p>Cyrus pretends he was still stirring the pot on the stove, &ldquo;Hey, TJ.&rdquo; He says casually without turning around.</p><p>&ldquo;You boys go off into your room, Cy. I&rsquo;ll finish up with dinner,&rdquo; Leslie says as she pries the wooden spoon from Cyrus&rsquo; hand. &ldquo;TJ you&rsquo;re welcome to stay for dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; TJ smiles,&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know I love your cooking.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><i>Great, he&rsquo;s being charming,</i> Cyrus thinks to himself with a frown.&nbsp;Without a word Cyrus sets off down the hall in the direction of his room. TJ is a step behind him and playfully steps on the back of Cyrus&rsquo; shoe because he knew it annoyed the shorter boy but instead of reacting with an amusing sulky expression like TJ had expected, Cyrus just ignores him and continues on.</p><p>Cyrus hovers in his room whilst TJ takes a seat at the edge of Cyrus&rsquo; bed, he picks up the tiny stuffed frog Cyrus had won and twirls it in his hand. Cyrus plants himself in the desk chair in the opposite corner of the room.&nbsp;An awkward second that felt like an eternity to Cyrus passes.</p><p>&ldquo;So..&rdquo; Cyrus says nervously. &ldquo;Is something up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; TJ shrugs a shoulder &ldquo; I just thought we could hang.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We just saw each other for lunch at the Spoon.&rdquo; Cyrus states.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we haven&rsquo;t hung out twice in a day before.&rdquo; TJ acknowledges. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re going to be weird about it, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go.&rdquo; Cyrus says unconvingly and TJ still gets up to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;The real reason I came here was to ask why you&rsquo;re being so weird with me.&rdquo; TJ says</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being weird.&rdquo; Cyrus shakes his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes you are, I was worried I did something at the carnival-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t anything wrong.&rdquo; Cyrus interrupts.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So why does it feel like you&rsquo;ve been avoiding me the past two days?&rdquo; TJ frowns.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not avoiding you.&rdquo; Cyrus tries to look casual and not as anxious as he felt.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You bailed straight after fireworks, you ignored my texts all day yesterday, you didn&rsquo;t tell me that &ldquo;Buffy, Andi and Jonah were back and you clearly didn&rsquo;t want me at The Spoon&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true and&nbsp;I dropped my phone off the pier so I couldn&rsquo;t message you.&rdquo; Cyrus explains.</p><p>TJ wears a confused look and Cyrus just sighs and says it&rsquo;s a long story.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are we fighting? This is kind of stupid.&rdquo; TJ tries to defuse things with a laugh but it felt forced.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ve hung out so much this summer we&rsquo;ve started to annoy each other,&rdquo; Cyrus spins the desk chair slightly and starts fiddling with something on his desk, his body angled away from TJ as he says, &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing if we hang out with other people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I spend all summer helping you with your stupid list but the second your other friends come home you&rsquo;re ready to bail?&rdquo; TJ looks hurt by Cyrus&rsquo; suggestion.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So now my list is stupid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the sudden I&rsquo;m annoying for helping you?&rdquo; TJ retorts.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant.&rdquo; Cyrus frowns.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it sounded like.&rdquo; TJ says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Cyrus, I&rsquo;ll just do the pier jump with Walker and Marty instead. &ldquo;You have fun with your real friends now they&rsquo;re home.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus wanted to stop TJ and explain why he&rsquo;s being so weird but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to. He thought maybe it was best if TJ and him weren&rsquo;t as close anymore. He felt guilty for this whole summer and now that Cyrus was aware of his feelings, it just felt wrong for them to be so close without TJ knowing the truth. Cyrus felt like a bad person, how could they ever have a sleepover again, or even have a harmless piggyback without feeling like he was doing something wrong. Cyrus never felt like this with Jonah but they were also new friends at the peak of his crush, they weren&rsquo;t really best friends until his feelings went away.&nbsp;</p><p>After TJ storms out in a huff,&nbsp;Cyrus goes over to the bed and picks up his little frog from the carnival that TJ dropped before exiting. Cyrus holds it in his hands as he flops down on his back. A short moment later Leslie is in Cyrus&rsquo; doorway with a concerned expression.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I saw TJ leave, he seemed upset,&rdquo; Leslie frowns,&nbsp;&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus thought about brushing it off. Smiling and telling his mother that everything was great but even after all the comforting chats he&rsquo;s had the past two days all he wanted to do was talk to his mom about it. Especially after this fight with TJ.</p><p>Before Cyrus could get any words out he starts crying. Within a second Leslie is by her sons side on the bed and she wraps her arms around him with a comforting embrace.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually Cyrus manages to stifle his sobs long enough to tell his mom everything. About his crush on Jonah, his confusion about being gay, his new crush on TJ and how he&rsquo;s pushed him away because he feels like he&rsquo;s being a bad person.&nbsp;Leslie wipes tears from her sons damp cheeks and assures him he&nbsp;has nothing to feel guilty for.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ hates me now.&rdquo; Cyrus says sadly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh cookie, he&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t hate you, I can assure you of this much.&rdquo; Leslie says with a small smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;You obviously mean a lot to him too so pushing him away wouldn&rsquo;t feel the best. He&rsquo;s just upset and doesn&rsquo;t understand why.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even understand why.&rdquo; Cyrus frowns and he felt the urge to start crying again. Leslie comforted Cyrus as long as he wanted her to. She didn&rsquo;t say&nbsp;&ldquo;oh I already knew&rdquo; or anything that made him feel like she had pre diagnosed him, nor did she say or do anything that made Cyrus feel like he was currently being analysed. It didn&rsquo;t feel like a therapy session between a doctor and her patient, it felt like the comforting motherly love Cyrus didnt know he needed until she was giving it.&nbsp;<br /></p><hr /><p><b>End Notes:&nbsp;</b>The next chapter is the<i> last one!!!! </i>There will be an epilogue and a bonus chapter after that.

Cyrus lays awake trying to make sense of his crush on TJ. At quarter to five in the morning, Cyrus is still wide awake and the faint ticks of the second hand from his wall clock were slowly driving him insane. Cyrus springs out of bed and changes into some casual clothes and he was far too frantic to perfectly craft his outfit like he usually would. </p>\n<p>Cyrus makes his way out of the house and even though it&rsquo;s only 5am, the sun has begun to rise since it&rsquo;s summer. Cyrus power walks down the street with no real destination in mind but somewhere along the way he becomes set on a single idea and with that crazed thought in mind, Cyrus makes his way to the Shadyside pier. </p>\n<p>Once at the seaside, Cyrus marches down the old wooden pier on a mission. As the end of the pier got closer, Cyrus&rsquo; strides became slower and shorter, even with fear and panic beginning to kick in, Cyrus forces himself to the edge. With a deep breath Cyrus leans forward to look at the water bellow. The water was calm, not at all mirroring how Cyrus currently felt. </p>\n<p><i>Do it,</i> Cyrus internally yells at himself, <i>it&rsquo;s just a little jump&hellip; and then a whole lot of ocean&hellip;&nbsp;</i>As Cyrus is leaning forward and staring into the ocean trying to force himself off the pier, his cell slips out of his pocket and splashes into water bellow. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;No no no!&rdquo; Cyrus whines as he watches it sink until it is no longer visible. &ldquo;Just my stinking luck.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are you talking to the fish, boy?&rdquo; A mans voice startles Cyrus and he was lucky he didn&rsquo;t fall off the edge of the pier when he jumped in fright. </p>\n</p>",

She knows what she\u2019s saying.\u201d Andi assured him, giving Buffy a playful shove of her shoulder. \u201cBesides, have you seen the way he looks at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean with his eyes, like he does towards every other person ever?\u201d Cyrus grumbled, roughly scratching out the answer to a math problem he was working on. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe math problem or the TJ problem?\u201d Buffy jeered, her lips curling into a smile.</p><p>\u201cBoth. What\u2019s worse is that this project is just us! Why couldn\u2019t Mr. Lande have made this a group assignment of more people. Or better yet, just make it an individual project!\u201d Cyrus put his head in his hands. How was he going to survive?</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the best,\u201d Andi shrugged, shoving her notebook in her backpack, \u201cit probably makes sense for this to be just two people. It\u2019s too much work for one, and group projects with many people usually end up with one person doing all the work,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose.</p><p>Cyrus opened his mouth to say something, but the bell rang and cut him off. \u201cAnd that\u2018s the cue,\u201d he sighed, swinging his backpack onto his shoulders, \u201cI gotta go to chemistry,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah you do!\u201d Buffy snorted, high fiving Andi and then allowing her hands to trail back up to her hair.</p><p>\u201cI would say that I\u2019m gonna kill you, but with the amount of energy I possess right now, I probably couldn\u2019t kill an ant. See you guys later.\u201d Cyrus walked down the hallway, his conversation with the girls replaying in his head. It seemed fake, that TJ could like him back. Cyrus had been crushing on him since middle school, and there was no <i>way</i> that TJ could like him back because why would\u2013</p><p>\u201cUnderdog!\u201d a familiar voice approached him, and Cyrus\u2019 breath hitched. TJ was wearing glasses, and Cyrus was so weak for that. On top of that, his helmet-hair that he usually sported was nowhere to be seen, replaced by a whirlwind mess of hair. And Cyrus loved it.</p><p>\u201cTJ, always a pleasure,\u201d he greeted, taking a seat in his usual desk, while TJ chose the desk right next to him.</p><p><i>That\u2019s funny, TJ always sits behind me, </i>Cyrus noted, but shook the thoughts out of his head. This was no time to overanalyze TJ\u2019s behavior. Now he needed to focus on\u2026balancing equations. He stared up at the clock; two minutes had passed.</p><p>This was going to be a long day.</p><!-- more --><hr><p>Eons later, the bell rang, and Cyrus was the first one to shove his textbook and pencils into his bag, rushing out of the classroom.</p><p>\u201cAnd make sure that you work on your projects, class! They\u2019re due tomorrow,\u201d the teacher called, and Cyrus just groaned in response. On top of an essay and studying for a calculus test, he had to finish it by tomorrow?</p><p><i>Note to self, stop procrastinating,</i> he mentally scolded himself.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d TJ\u2019s voice startled him, as the basketball player walker alongside him.</p><p>\u201cBuy some ice cream and cry because I\u2019m going to fail chemistry,\u201d Cyrus replied, exhaustion lacing his voice.</p><p>\u201cHow about you just come over to my house after school and we can work on th project? I\u2019ll make sure we have snacks,\u201d he offered, blushing as he saw the smaller boy\u2019s face light up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then,\u201d Cyrus beamed, half-walking half-skipping to his next class. TJ watched him round the corner, the memory of his smile burned into his brain.</p><p>Yeah, he was whipped.</p><hr><p>Cyrus knocked on TJ\u2019s door, rocking back on his heels as his teeth chattered. Would it have been wise to bring a jacket? Yes. But Cyrus was worried that he was going to be late so he didn\u2019t bother to even check the weather because he didn\u2019t get a notification on his phone because he was busy\u2013</p><p>Footsteps from inside snapped Cyrus out his train of thoughts, absentmindedly fixing his hair and smoothing out his shirt. Not like he was wearing anything fancy, just a pair of jeans and a <a href=\"https://us.romwe.com/Rainbow-Striped-Print-Hooded-Sweatshirt-p-352694-cat-673.html\">shirt with a rainbow on it.</a> After a few moments, the door creaked open to reveal a stressed out TJ, donning a green tee and <a href=\"https://us.romwe.com/Black-Rainbow-Stripe-Side-Pants-p-193521-cat-681.html\">these sweatpants</a>. Cyrus had to smile; somehow they both got the gay memo.</p><p>\u201cNot So Scary Basketball Guy, looking gay as ever,\u201d Cyrus joked, stepping inside and being enveloped by the warmth.</p><p>\u201cRight back at you,\u201d TJ replied, his voice strained, \u201cokay, so are we gonna work on this project? We gotta get going because we need to do well so we can get a good grade so that I don\u2019t fail the class and when the colleges look at my grades they can-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ, you look like you\u2019re gonna pass out. Take a breath, sit down,\u201d Cyrus instructed him. He could practically hear his four shrink parents telling him what to do next. They took a seat on a few cushions that were sprawled on the shagged carpeting.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do fine on this project, TJ,\u201d Cyrus started, placing his hand on the other boy\u2019s knee, \u201cWe can finish it tonight, I know we can. Just..take a breath,\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded weakly, his hand absentmindedly trailing over to Cyrus\u2019, his fingers on top of the other boy\u2019s. \u201cI need a good grade in chemistry,\u201d he repeated, this time less frantic, \u201cMy parents are on my back about my grades, and I just\u2026I\u2019m gonna let them down,\u201d</p><p>As if Cyrus could hear TJ\u2019s heart breaking, he shifted closer. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. You\u2019re not gonna let them down. I promise I won\u2019t let that happen,\u201d he assured him, and a small smile ghosted TJ\u2019s lips. \u201cNow, let me just grab the assignment paper,\u201d he muttered, begrudgingly removing his hand from TJ\u2019s, and fishing through his backpack. He pulled out a wrinkled sheet of paper and scanned it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we need to research the history behind five of the elements that were man made, who \u2018invented\u2019 them, details regarding their reactivity, and why they were named the way they were,\u201d he read off the sheet, letting out a tired breath.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d TJ muttered under his breath; that sounded like a lot of work.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later,\u201d Cyrus replied nearly silently, but TJ\u2019s gaze showed that it wasn\u2019t that quiet. Both boys went red with embarrassment, and the air was thick with tension.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d TJ squeaked out his eyes searching Cyrus\u2019 for some sort of explanation.</p><p>\u201cNothing! It was\u2026nothing,\u201d Cyrus lied, and he knew his ears were burning an inhumane shade of red.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d TJ hummed in response, unconvinced, \u201cso back to\u2026chemistry,\u201d he snickered, raising his brows at Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cStop that, I feel attacked,\u201d he pouted, pushing out his lower lip and furrowing his brows.</p><p>\u201cAnd you almost look cute enough to make me stop,\u201d TJ blurted out, and now it was his turn to feel his ears burn with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Cyrus toyed with him, leaning on his hands and smirking, \u201cI\u2019m cute, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck you,\u201d TJ snorted, giving Cyrus a gentle push.</p><p>\u201cYou wish,\u201d Cyrus retorted, a deep blush dusting his cheeks as his arms gave out beneath him and he lay on his back.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d TJ cooed, crossing his arms playfully.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t?\u201d he shot back cleverly, his eyes flitting from TJ\u2019s eyes to his lips and back too his eyes\u2026then back to his lips.</p><p>TJ shrugged nonchalantly, his heart beating so loud he thought Cyrus could hear it. \u201cYou won\u2019t pass chemistry without my help,\u201d he commented, to which Cyrus smirked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d Cyrus grinned, tugging on TJ\u2019s shirt and pulling him down until their noses were touching, \u201chelp me pass chemistry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d TJ whispered, meeting Cyrus\u2019 lips and feeling his elbows weaken underneath him. It was messy, neither boy truly knowing what to do, but it was beautiful nonetheless.</p><p>And yes, both boys were doing great in chemistry.</p><p>tag list:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWsIkR1GJgSJuWbP-DN9ydA\"> @seanna313</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\"> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ghostswasp</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\"></a><a>@swingsetboys</a>\u200b <a>@ifellintotyrushell</a></p>",

She knows what she\u2019s saying.\u201d Andi assured him, giving Buffy a playful shove of her shoulder. \u201cBesides, have you seen the way he looks at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean with his eyes, like he does towards every other person ever?\u201d Cyrus grumbled, roughly scratching out the answer to a math problem he was working on. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe math problem or the TJ problem?\u201d Buffy jeered, her lips curling into a smile.</p><p>\u201cBoth. What\u2019s worse is that this project is just us! Why couldn\u2019t Mr. Lande have made this a group assignment of more people. Or better yet, just make it an individual project!\u201d Cyrus put his head in his hands. How was he going to survive?</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the best,\u201d Andi shrugged, shoving her notebook in her backpack, \u201cit probably makes sense for this to be just two people. It\u2019s too much work for one, and group projects with many people usually end up with one person doing all the work,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose.</p><p>Cyrus opened his mouth to say something, but the bell rang and cut him off. \u201cAnd that\u2018s the cue,\u201d he sighed, swinging his backpack onto his shoulders, \u201cI gotta go to chemistry,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah you do!\u201d Buffy snorted, high fiving Andi and then allowing her hands to trail back up to her hair.</p><p>\u201cI would say that I\u2019m gonna kill you, but with the amount of energy I possess right now, I probably couldn\u2019t kill an ant. See you guys later.\u201d Cyrus walked down the hallway, his conversation with the girls replaying in his head. It seemed fake, that TJ could like him back. Cyrus had been crushing on him since middle school, and there was no <i>way</i> that TJ could like him back because why would\u2013</p><p>\u201cUnderdog!\u201d a familiar voice approached him, and Cyrus\u2019 breath hitched. TJ was wearing glasses, and Cyrus was so weak for that. On top of that, his helmet-hair that he usually sported was nowhere to be seen, replaced by a whirlwind mess of hair. And Cyrus loved it.</p><p>\u201cTJ, always a pleasure,\u201d he greeted, taking a seat in his usual desk, while TJ chose the desk right next to him.</p><p><i>That\u2019s funny, TJ always sits behind me, </i>Cyrus noted, but shook the thoughts out of his head. This was no time to overanalyze TJ\u2019s behavior. Now he needed to focus on\u2026balancing equations. He stared up at the clock; two minutes had passed.</p><p>This was going to be a long day.</p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>Eons later, the bell rang, and Cyrus was the first one to shove his textbook and pencils into his bag, rushing out of the classroom.</p><p>\u201cAnd make sure that you work on your projects, class! They\u2019re due tomorrow,\u201d the teacher called, and Cyrus just groaned in response. On top of an essay and studying for a calculus test, he had to finish it by tomorrow?</p><p><i>Note to self, stop procrastinating,</i> he mentally scolded himself.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d TJ\u2019s voice startled him, as the basketball player walker alongside him.</p><p>\u201cBuy some ice cream and cry because I\u2019m going to fail chemistry,\u201d Cyrus replied, exhaustion lacing his voice.</p><p>\u201cHow about you just come over to my house after school and we can work on th project? I\u2019ll make sure we have snacks,\u201d he offered, blushing as he saw the smaller boy\u2019s face light up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then,\u201d Cyrus beamed, half-walking half-skipping to his next class. TJ watched him round the corner, the memory of his smile burned into his brain.</p><p>Yeah, he was whipped.</p><hr><p>Cyrus knocked on TJ\u2019s door, rocking back on his heels as his teeth chattered. Would it have been wise to bring a jacket? Yes. But Cyrus was worried that he was going to be late so he didn\u2019t bother to even check the weather because he didn\u2019t get a notification on his phone because he was busy\u2013</p><p>Footsteps from inside snapped Cyrus out his train of thoughts, absentmindedly fixing his hair and smoothing out his shirt. Not like he was wearing anything fancy, just a pair of jeans and a <a href=\"https://us.romwe.com/Rainbow-Striped-Print-Hooded-Sweatshirt-p-352694-cat-673.html\">shirt with a rainbow on it.</a> After a few moments, the door creaked open to reveal a stressed out TJ, donning a green tee and <a href=\"https://us.romwe.com/Black-Rainbow-Stripe-Side-Pants-p-193521-cat-681.html\">these sweatpants</a>. Cyrus had to smile; somehow they both got the gay memo.</p><p>\u201cNot So Scary Basketball Guy, looking gay as ever,\u201d Cyrus joked, stepping inside and being enveloped by the warmth.</p><p>\u201cRight back at you,\u201d TJ replied, his voice strained, \u201cokay, so are we gonna work on this project? We gotta get going because we need to do well so we can get a good grade so that I don\u2019t fail the class and when the colleges look at my grades they can-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ, you look like you\u2019re gonna pass out. Take a breath, sit down,\u201d Cyrus instructed him. He could practically hear his four shrink parents telling him what to do next. They took a seat on a few cushions that were sprawled on the shagged carpeting.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do fine on this project, TJ,\u201d Cyrus started, placing his hand on the other boy\u2019s knee, \u201cWe can finish it tonight, I know we can. Just..take a breath,\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded weakly, his hand absentmindedly trailing over to Cyrus\u2019, his fingers on top of the other boy\u2019s. \u201cI need a good grade in chemistry,\u201d he repeated, this time less frantic, \u201cMy parents are on my back about my grades, and I just\u2026I\u2019m gonna let them down,\u201d</p><p>As if Cyrus could hear TJ\u2019s heart breaking, he shifted closer. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. You\u2019re not gonna let them down. I promise I won\u2019t let that happen,\u201d he assured him, and a small smile ghosted TJ\u2019s lips. \u201cNow, let me just grab the assignment paper,\u201d he muttered, begrudgingly removing his hand from TJ\u2019s, and fishing through his backpack. He pulled out a wrinkled sheet of paper and scanned it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we need to research the history behind five of the elements that were man made, who \u2018invented\u2019 them, details regarding their reactivity, and why they were named the way they were,\u201d he read off the sheet, letting out a tired breath.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d TJ muttered under his breath; that sounded like a lot of work.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later,\u201d Cyrus replied nearly silently, but TJ\u2019s gaze showed that it wasn\u2019t that quiet. Both boys went red with embarrassment, and the air was thick with tension.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d TJ squeaked out his eyes searching Cyrus\u2019 for some sort of explanation.</p><p>\u201cNothing! It was\u2026nothing,\u201d Cyrus lied, and he knew his ears were burning an inhumane shade of red.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d TJ hummed in response, unconvinced, \u201cso back to\u2026chemistry,\u201d he snickered, raising his brows at Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cStop that, I feel attacked,\u201d he pouted, pushing out his lower lip and furrowing his brows.</p><p>\u201cAnd you almost look cute enough to make me stop,\u201d TJ blurted out, and now it was his turn to feel his ears burn with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Cyrus toyed with him, leaning on his hands and smirking, \u201cI\u2019m cute, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck you,\u201d TJ snorted, giving Cyrus a gentle push.</p><p>\u201cYou wish,\u201d Cyrus retorted, a deep blush dusting his cheeks as his arms gave out beneath him and he lay on his back.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d TJ cooed, crossing his arms playfully.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t?\u201d he shot back cleverly, his eyes flitting from TJ\u2019s eyes to his lips and back too his eyes\u2026then back to his lips.</p><p>TJ shrugged nonchalantly, his heart beating so loud he thought Cyrus could hear it. \u201cYou won\u2019t pass chemistry without my help,\u201d he commented, to which Cyrus smirked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d Cyrus grinned, tugging on TJ\u2019s shirt and pulling him down until their noses were touching, \u201chelp me pass chemistry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d TJ whispered, meeting Cyrus\u2019 lips and feeling his elbows weaken underneath him. It was messy, neither boy truly knowing what to do, but it was beautiful nonetheless.</p><p>And yes, both boys were doing great in chemistry.</p><p>tag list:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWsIkR1GJgSJuWbP-DN9ydA\"> @seanna313</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\"> </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ghostswasp</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\"></a><a>@swingsetboys</a>\u200b <a>@ifellintotyrushell</a></p>",

See you guys later.&rdquo; Cyrus walked down the hallway, his conversation with the girls replaying in his head. It seemed fake, that TJ could like him back. Cyrus had been crushing on him since middle school, and there was no <i>way</i> that TJ could like him back because why would&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Underdog!&rdquo; a familiar voice approached him, and Cyrus&rsquo; breath hitched. TJ was wearing glasses, and Cyrus was so weak for that. On top of that, his helmet-hair that he usually sported was nowhere to be seen, replaced by a whirlwind mess of hair. And Cyrus loved it.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, always a pleasure,&rdquo; he greeted, taking a seat in his usual desk, while TJ chose the desk right next to him.</p><p><i>That&rsquo;s funny, TJ always sits behind me, </i>Cyrus noted, but shook the thoughts out of his head. This was no time to overanalyze TJ&rsquo;s behavior. Now he needed to focus on&hellip;balancing equations. He stared up at the clock; two minutes had passed.</p><p>This was going to be a long day.</p><hr /><p>Eons later, the bell rang, and Cyrus was the first one to shove his textbook and pencils into his bag, rushing out of the classroom.</p><p>&ldquo;And make sure that you work on your projects, class! They&rsquo;re due tomorrow,&rdquo; the teacher called, and Cyrus just groaned in response. On top of an essay and studying for a calculus test, he had to finish it by tomorrow?</p><p><i>Note to self, stop procrastinating,</i> he mentally scolded himself.</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s voice startled him, as the basketball player walker alongside him.</p><p>&ldquo;Buy some ice cream and cry because I&rsquo;m going to fail chemistry,&rdquo; Cyrus replied, exhaustion lacing his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;How about you just come over to my house after school and we can work on th project? I&rsquo;ll make sure we have snacks,&rdquo; he offered, blushing as he saw the smaller boy&rsquo;s face light up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you then,&rdquo; Cyrus beamed, half-walking half-skipping to his next class. TJ watched him round the corner, the memory of his smile burned into his brain.</p><p>Yeah, he was whipped.</p><hr /><p>Cyrus knocked on TJ&rsquo;s door, rocking back on his heels as his teeth chattered. Would it have been wise to bring a jacket? Yes. But Cyrus was worried that he was going to be late so he didn&rsquo;t bother to even check the weather because he didn&rsquo;t get a notification on his phone because he was busy&ndash;</p><p>Footsteps from inside snapped Cyrus out his train of thoughts, absentmindedly fixing his hair and smoothing out his shirt. Not like he was wearing anything fancy, just a pair of jeans and a <a href=\"https://us.romwe.com/Rainbow-Striped-Print-Hooded-Sweatshirt-p-352694-cat-673.html\">shirt with a rainbow on it.</a> After a few moments, the door creaked open to reveal a stressed out TJ, donning a green tee and <a href=\"https://us.romwe.com/Black-Rainbow-Stripe-Side-Pants-p-193521-cat-681.html\">these sweatpants</a>. Cyrus had to smile; somehow they both got the gay memo.</p><p>&ldquo;Not So Scary Basketball Guy, looking gay as ever,&rdquo; Cyrus joked, stepping inside and being enveloped by the warmth.</p><p>&ldquo;Right back at you,&rdquo; TJ replied, his voice strained, &ldquo;okay, so are we gonna work on this project? We gotta get going because we need to do well so we can get a good grade so that I don&rsquo;t fail the class and when the colleges look at my grades they can-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, you look like you&rsquo;re gonna pass out. Take a breath, sit down,&rdquo; Cyrus instructed him. He could practically hear his four shrink parents telling him what to do next. They took a seat on a few cushions that were sprawled on the shagged carpeting.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do fine on this project, TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus started, placing his hand on the other boy&rsquo;s knee, &ldquo;We can finish it tonight, I know we can. Just..take a breath,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded weakly, his hand absentmindedly trailing over to Cyrus&rsquo;, his fingers on top of the other boy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I need a good grade in chemistry,&rdquo; he repeated, this time less frantic, &ldquo;My parents are on my back about my grades, and I just&hellip;I&rsquo;m gonna let them down,&rdquo;</p><p>As if Cyrus could hear TJ&rsquo;s heart breaking, he shifted closer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. You&rsquo;re not gonna let them down. I promise I won&rsquo;t let that happen,&rdquo; he assured him, and a small smile ghosted TJ&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Now, let me just grab the assignment paper,&rdquo; he muttered, begrudgingly removing his hand from TJ&rsquo;s, and fishing through his backpack. He pulled out a wrinkled sheet of paper and scanned it.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so we need to research the history behind five of the elements that were man made, who &lsquo;invented&rsquo; them, details regarding their reactivity, and why they were named the way they were,&rdquo; he read off the sheet, letting out a tired breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck me,&rdquo; TJ muttered under his breath; that sounded like a lot of work.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe later,&rdquo; Cyrus replied nearly silently, but TJ&rsquo;s gaze showed that it wasn&rsquo;t that quiet. Both boys went red with embarrassment, and the air was thick with tension.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; TJ squeaked out his eyes searching Cyrus&rsquo; for some sort of explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing!
