The weeks after were filled with laughter and goodnight kisses, and the first time Harry took her home and she stayed the night, writhing under him and moaning softly, him sweetly peppering kisses down her chest and gently pushing into her. Then she moved in with him, and it was the first time he\u2019d ever been so intimate with someone to have her clothes brushing his in the wardrobe, her lips moving against his chest as she talked in her sleep. </p><p>He\u2019s sure he can\u2019t be more in love with or endeared by her, but then Evie comes along, miaowing curiously in the little shoe box he\u2019s clutching close to his chest, grinning widely as he waves goodbye to Gemma with his free arm and coos softly at the baby paw sticking out from the box, testing the waters before a furry little head with the widest eyes he\u2019s ever seen besides y/n\u2019s follows. </p><p>Evie stays fairly quiet during the drive to their flat, but Harry is buzzing with excitement, keeping the little kitten as entertained as he can using his jumbled words while laughing in disbelief. She let out a few \u2018miaows\u2019 every now and then, but other than that, was content having her owner do the talking part for her. </p><p>By the time they\u2019re home, Harry\u2019s got her inside of that makeshift shoebox carrier, gently placing the holey top of the box onto the kitten\u2019s fluffy little head, indicating she should duck and curl up inside of the box, and the sweet little thing does, making him suppress another coo of wonder. He pushes the key into the keyhole with his ring clad fingers, twisting it before revealing a warm flat, holding the fragrance of his girlfriend\u2019s jasmine shampoo and the soft sound of her humming as she moved around the kitchen, probably putting together a sandwich for herself, and hopefully one for him, too. </p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he croons softly, still not over the voice he uses near the kitten. But how can he help it? Masculinity be damned, Evie was so small and soft, and her \u2018miaows\u2019 sounded more like \u2018mew\u2019s. \u201cCome look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re home,\u201d y/n says, her voice muffled as her cheeks are adorably filled with sandwich and puffing out as she moves towards him, extending her arms so they can wrap around his neck and so Harry can use his free arm to wrap around her waist in his T-shirt, showering his girlfriend with affection before he shows her what\u2019s he\u2019s gotten for the both of them. </p><p>\u201cWha\u2019s tha\u2019?\u201d She asks while she swallows, eyes flickering to the box keeping her from hugging her boyfriend properly. Harry smiles shyly at the question, his heart soft and hoping she would love Evie as much as he loved her already. </p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he hushes her voice down, urging her to be quieter, \u201cyou\u2019re about to be a mummy, gonna wake our baby up.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes widen at that, staring at him as if he\u2019d become a complete lunatic over the past few hours he\u2019s been out of the flat. </p><p>\u201cHave you gone mad? The pregnancy test we took last week came back negative,\u201d y/n reminds him, panic slowly swelling in her stomach as she begins to become skeptical of the test. Harry shakes his head, although a soft smile pulls at his lips as he fondly remembers how scared y/n was last week, because she had missed her period and was worried of the possibility she could be pregnant. The two of them had spent the evening taking the test and mustering the courage to look at it. Harry had reminded her that whatever happened, he would be there, and if there was a baby, he or she would be the most loved baby in the world. <i>Another time</i>,<i> </i>Harry thinks to himself. </p><p>\u201c\u2018S not that, lovie, \u2018s a-\u201c as Harry\u2019s about to explain just what, or <i>who</i> was inhabiting the shoe box, drawing y/n closer to the side of his chest, Evie had decided that was the exact moment she would bump the top of the shoe box off of her head and blink at Harry and y/n, miaowing softly before beginning to clean herself. </p><p>\u201c\u2018Ve brought you a kitten,\u201d Harry laughs nervously, waiting for y/n\u2019s reaction as she\u2019s gone stiff against his chest, making no movements or noises, simply staring at the domestic animal with unblinking eyes. </p><p>Evie lets out a pitched \u201cmew\u201d at the silence, feeling unsettled as all the attention and coos focused on her seemed to vanish. Not to mention, she wanted to be set on her feet and explore the flat, and know where her litter box was. Y/N is snapped out of her thoughts once the kitten she\u2019s looking at lets out the meek roar. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, Harry, she\u2019s so cute!\u201d y/n squeals, quieting down so she can stare at the cat in the shoe box with wide eyes filled with wonder, and Harry\u2019s heart thumps with joy and he presses a kiss to his girlfriend\u2019s forehead, arm slinging around her waist as he nudges the box right under her chest, onto her stomach, gesturing for her to hold it. But y/n seems to jerk away and Harry can <i>feel</i> the hesitation on her. </p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong, pretty girl?\u201d Harry asks, voice deep and slow enough to make her comfortable with answering. He looks at her with the kindest eyes and his intense gaze seems to figure her out instantly when he places the box onto the floor, helping the little kitten out and shaking his head softly in amusement when she moves her paws as fast as she can, immediately going for the crack under the sofa so she can hide. </p><p>\u201c\u2018s making you uncomfortable to touch her?\u201d he hums, crossing his warm arms over her stomach and pulling her in so his warm lips can rest at the nape of her neck. He feels her shuffle and nod embarrasedly in reply, and gives her a sympathetic kiss on the cheek, finding it oddly adorable at the same time. y/n didn\u2019t mind cats, she adored kittens and how soft and cute they were when they \u2018mew\u2019 or do anything, really. She just feared touching them, in fear of either hurting <i>them</i> , or them hurting <i>her. </i></p><p>\u201c\u2018S alright. Do you want me to give her back to Gemma?\u201d </p><p>As much as he had already grown deeply infatuated with the curious little thing, Harry knew y/n was more important and more of a priority than his fascination with cats. Besides, he couldn\u2019t just scare her like that on a daily basis, kittens had the tendency to wander up in places you wouldn\u2019t expect in a matter of seconds. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she quickly answered, cheeks flushing when Harry furrowed his eyebrows in confusion. y/n\u2019s own fingers met Harry\u2019s where they moved gently against her stomach. </p><p>\u201cI-i want to learn how to get close to them without being afraid. I want to get to the point where I can just pick her up and have a cuddle with her,\u201d she confesses, biting her lip. </p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll get you there,\u201d he promises, his chin resting on her forehead, their arms entwined on her waist as they sway back and forth, him leaning down occasionally to press a kiss to her forehead or cheek. </p><p>* * * </p><p>y/n\u2019s getting there. </p><p>Harry\u2019s been patient with her, incredibly patient. And it\u2019s wonderful, because everyone else seems to forget how the overcame the jitters a specific animal gave them, or forgot the jitters existed in the first place. Most people would play it off and tell y/n to get over it, simply dropping a squirming cat who could sense her panic onto her lap. Harry wasn\u2019t most people. He was incredibly gentle with her, never urging her to do anything she didn\u2019t want to, and he even offered to take the litter out on his own on a daily basis so it wouldn\u2019t cause the flat to waft with a deadly smell. </p><p>The kitten even had her own room, where Harry would rub that spot behind her ears until her eyes blinked at Harry, slowing down until they shut completely. <i>One day</i>, he figures, <i>Evie can snuggle between us at night. </i></p><p>y/n is always observing Harry when he picks up Evie, his large palms both first laying flat up against where her ribs end and thumbs holding her secure on her backside below her shoulders, so she can\u2019t scratch him. And if she\u2019s feeling uncomfortable, she\u2019ll squirm and her kitten claws will emerge from her soft paws. And that\u2019s another thing, her scratches and bites don\u2019t hurt. Harry figures she knows not to scratch deep into Harry or break any skin, only a gently tap will have her human understand she wants to be put down. The teeth might be, because she hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t grow adult teeth for quite a while. </p><p>y/n also notices Evie\u2019s stances, how she follows Harry around the flat, brushes up against him, and acts particularly affectionate when she\u2019s hungry. And she has a few favourite ones , too. y/n loves it when Evie wakes up, because she\u2019ll let out the cutest \u2018miaow\u2019 and then open her mouth wide open, stretching her head back and closing her eyes slightly as she yawns, her little pink tongue exposed. The first time y/n dared to pick the kitten up is when she wakes up, because she\u2019s particularly calm, after a well needed nap after playtime with Harry. She\u2019ll snuggle up against y/n\u2019s chest and maybe fall asleep, purring and meeping in her sleep. Or there\u2019s when she\u2019s eating her meals, she\u2019ll be immersed in the bowl of food that y/n can pet her as much as she\u2019s wanted to, and Evie won\u2019t care as long as she\u2019s being fed and looked after. And, of course, when Evie is served with a bowl of fresh water along with her meal and she\u2019ll lightly tap her paw into the bowl, testing of the water\u2019s temperature was up to par with her standards. </p><p>Pretty soon, y/n\u2019s washing her with \u2018no water\u2019 \u2018all natural\u2019 shampoo (which Evie takes calmly, because there\u2019s no water, and there are a lot of warm rubs from both of her owners) or giving her the very rare bath when she\u2019s particularly dirty, seeing as y/n and Harry don\u2019t want to stress the bright eyed kitten out. y/n even holds her on her lap while Harry cleans the litter box with a screwed up face, the reason being Evie gets pretty territorial when someone touches her litter box. </p><p>Evie loves y/n and Harry, too, despite the occasional moments when she thinks her owners are crazy when they press their limbs against each other when they shut the bedroom door, or when they\u2019re fighting over something silly. </p><p>* * * </p><p>One night, after a particularly long day at the studio, Harry comes home. He usually wouldn\u2019t have been this late, but he and y/n had gone to bed angry the last night after fighting over something that seemed so stupid now. Harry had left as early as possible the next morning, and now he could feel guilt running throughout him as he unlocked the door to their flat, stepping inside and expecting silence and darkness while his girlfriend slept. </p><p>Instead, Harry\u2019s eyebrows furrow and green eyes lighten in curiousity when he can hear deep rumbling purrs and \u2018mew\u2019s, mixed with the faint sounds of someone mumbling and sighing coming from the living room. Gently shutting the front door, Harry takes off his shoes and silently pads to the living room, cursing softly when he nearly steps on a squeaking rubber duck the kitten takes a particular interest in. Leaning over stepping into the room. </p><p>And there they are. y/n and Evie. </p><p>The faint sound of a Netflix show plays in the background, but all Harry can really focus on is his girlfriend, lying flat on her back on the couch, with the cat on her belly, purring contentedly. The both of them are talking in their sleep, mumbling nonsense that Harry just so happens to hold very dear to his heart. </p><p>He moves closer to the two of them, crouching down to first sponge a loving kiss onto y/n\u2019s soft and supple cheek, stroking it gently with her fingers, before taking his rings off and petting the cat resting on her belly, smirking softly as the kitten doesn\u2019t stop purring, but blinks her eyes wide open, letting out a yawn and soft meow before bumping her head against Harry\u2019s and then walking all over his girlfriend\u2019s belly, only to find that one spot and cuddle down once more. The movement, however, wakes y/n. </p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She hums, disoriented as she rubs her eyes, hand flying gently over the weight resting on her tummy. Her eyes flicker open and y/n gives Harry a smile that makes his heart skip a beat. </p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d he greets, his voice raspy and deep as he pushes his lips against hers tenderly while she scrapes her nails into his curls with her free hand, humming in sleepiness as Harry rests his head against her chest, enjoying the attention. The kitten suddenly lets out a small sneeze, and they\u2019re all frozen, y/n and Harry staring at the wide eyed kitten and beginning to chuckle and giggle at the look on Evie\u2019s face, seeing as she\u2019d scared herself with her own sneeze. </p><p>\u201cBless you, precious,\u201d y/n giggles, Harry following in suit as Evie settles down once more before letting out needy little cries that she just <i>knew </i>tugged at their heartstrings. </p><p>\u201cWhat are those \u2018miaows\u2019 for, hm, my love?\u201d y/n croons, \u201cis daddy home?\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s heart swells suddenly in his chest, his green eyes following every movement y/n made with the kitten, enlaced with love, affection and deep care. </p><p>\u201cBeen good for mumma, yeah?\u201d he can\u2019t help but ask in a tear filled, raspy voice, because he just loves the both of them so much, and if y/n can understand how emotional he is, she merely nods with a soft smile on her pretty face. </p><p>Harry thought it was impossible to fall deeper in love with y/n. But now that she\u2019s on his couch, sleepy and soft with a small, purring milky white and black kitten whose world revolves around y/n and him perched upon her belly snugly, Harry knows he\u2019s been proven wrong. </p><p>\u2022 </p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>The one where it\u2019s him, her, and Evie. </p><p><strike><i>wow trust me to create a series dedicated to harry, y/n and their cat. , idk i just decided to make a series of cat dad!harry and of them just being cat parents in general, bc i recently got a kitten on my birthday, and hArry got a kitten, too and i think life is better when you experience it with a kitten :,) </i></strike></p><p><a href=\"https://meet-me-in-the-kitchen.tumblr.com/post/176776998298/masterlist-yay-youve-reached-my-vault-of-things-i\"><b>MASTERLIST</b></a>|<b>Requests are open!</b></p>",

The weeks after were filled with laughter and goodnight kisses, and the first time Harry took her home and she stayed the night, writhing under him and moaning softly, him sweetly peppering kisses down her chest and gently pushing into her. Then she moved in with him, and it was the first time he\u2019d ever been so intimate with someone to have her clothes brushing his in the wardrobe, her lips moving against his chest as she talked in her sleep. </p><p>He\u2019s sure he can\u2019t be more in love with or endeared by her, but then Evie comes along, miaowing curiously in the little shoe box he\u2019s clutching close to his chest, grinning widely as he waves goodbye to Gemma with his free arm and coos softly at the baby paw sticking out from the box, testing the waters before a furry little head with the widest eyes he\u2019s ever seen besides y/n\u2019s follows. </p><p>Evie stays fairly quiet during the drive to their flat, but Harry is buzzing with excitement, keeping the little kitten as entertained as he can using his jumbled words while laughing in disbelief. She let out a few \u2018miaows\u2019 every now and then, but other than that, was content having her owner do the talking part for her. </p><p>By the time they\u2019re home, Harry\u2019s got her inside of that makeshift shoebox carrier, gently placing the holey top of the box onto the kitten\u2019s fluffy little head, indicating she should duck and curl up inside of the box, and the sweet little thing does, making him suppress another coo of wonder. He pushes the key into the keyhole with his ring clad fingers, twisting it before revealing a warm flat, holding the fragrance of his girlfriend\u2019s jasmine shampoo and the soft sound of her humming as she moved around the kitchen, probably putting together a sandwich for herself, and hopefully one for him, too. </p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he croons softly, still not over the voice he uses near the kitten. But how can he help it? Masculinity be damned, Evie was so small and soft, and her \u2018miaows\u2019 sounded more like \u2018mew\u2019s. \u201cCome look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re home,\u201d y/n says, her voice muffled as her cheeks are adorably filled with sandwich and puffing out as she moves towards him, extending her arms so they can wrap around his neck and so Harry can use his free arm to wrap around her waist in his T-shirt, showering his girlfriend with affection before he shows her what\u2019s he\u2019s gotten for the both of them. </p><p>\u201cWha\u2019s tha\u2019?\u201d She asks while she swallows, eyes flickering to the box keeping her from hugging her boyfriend properly. Harry smiles shyly at the question, his heart soft and hoping she would love Evie as much as he loved her already. </p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he hushes her voice down, urging her to be quieter, \u201cyou\u2019re about to be a mummy, gonna wake our baby up.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes widen at that, staring at him as if he\u2019d become a complete lunatic over the past few hours he\u2019s been out of the flat. </p><p>\u201cHave you gone mad? The pregnancy test we took last week came back negative,\u201d y/n reminds him, panic slowly swelling in her stomach as she begins to become skeptical of the test. Harry shakes his head, although a soft smile pulls at his lips as he fondly remembers how scared y/n was last week, because she had missed her period and was worried of the possibility she could be pregnant. The two of them had spent the evening taking the test and mustering the courage to look at it. Harry had reminded her that whatever happened, he would be there, and if there was a baby, he or she would be the most loved baby in the world. <i>Another time</i>,<i> </i>Harry thinks to himself. </p><p>\u201c\u2018S not that, lovie, \u2018s a-\u201c as Harry\u2019s about to explain just what, or <i>who</i> was inhabiting the shoe box, drawing y/n closer to the side of his chest, Evie had decided that was the exact moment she would bump the top of the shoe box off of her head and blink at Harry and y/n, miaowing softly before beginning to clean herself. </p><p>\u201c\u2018Ve brought you a kitten,\u201d Harry laughs nervously, waiting for y/n\u2019s reaction as she\u2019s gone stiff against his chest, making no movements or noises, simply staring at the domestic animal with unblinking eyes. </p><p>Evie lets out a pitched \u201cmew\u201d at the silence, feeling unsettled as all the attention and coos focused on her seemed to vanish. Not to mention, she wanted to be set on her feet and explore the flat, and know where her litter box was. Y/N is snapped out of her thoughts once the kitten she\u2019s looking at lets out the meek roar. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, Harry, she\u2019s so cute!\u201d y/n squeals, quieting down so she can stare at the cat in the shoe box with wide eyes filled with wonder, and Harry\u2019s heart thumps with joy and he presses a kiss to his girlfriend\u2019s forehead, arm slinging around her waist as he nudges the box right under her chest, onto her stomach, gesturing for her to hold it. But y/n seems to jerk away and Harry can <i>feel</i> the hesitation on her. </p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong, pretty girl?\u201d Harry asks, voice deep and slow enough to make her comfortable with answering. He looks at her with the kindest eyes and his intense gaze seems to figure her out instantly when he places the box onto the floor, helping the little kitten out and shaking his head softly in amusement when she moves her paws as fast as she can, immediately going for the crack under the sofa so she can hide. </p><p>\u201c\u2018s making you uncomfortable to touch her?\u201d he hums, crossing his warm arms over her stomach and pulling her in so his warm lips can rest at the nape of her neck. He feels her shuffle and nod embarrasedly in reply, and gives her a sympathetic kiss on the cheek, finding it oddly adorable at the same time. y/n didn\u2019t mind cats, she adored kittens and how soft and cute they were when they \u2018mew\u2019 or do anything, really. She just feared touching them, in fear of either hurting <i>them</i> , or them hurting <i>her. </i></p><p>\u201c\u2018S alright. Do you want me to give her back to Gemma?\u201d </p><p>As much as he had already grown deeply infatuated with the curious little thing, Harry knew y/n was more important and more of a priority than his fascination with cats. Besides, he couldn\u2019t just scare her like that on a daily basis, kittens had the tendency to wander up in places you wouldn\u2019t expect in a matter of seconds. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she quickly answered, cheeks flushing when Harry furrowed his eyebrows in confusion. y/n\u2019s own fingers met Harry\u2019s where they moved gently against her stomach. </p><p>\u201cI-i want to learn how to get close to them without being afraid.

The weeks after were filled with laughter and goodnight kisses, and the first time Harry took her home and she stayed the night, writhing under him and moaning softly, him sweetly peppering kisses down her chest and gently pushing into her. Then she moved in with him, and it was the first time he\u2019d ever been so intimate with someone to have her clothes brushing his in the wardrobe, her lips moving against his chest as she talked in her sleep. </p><p>He\u2019s sure he can\u2019t be more in love with or endeared by her, but then Evie comes along, miaowing curiously in the little shoe box he\u2019s clutching close to his chest, grinning widely as he waves goodbye to Gemma with his free arm and coos softly at the baby paw sticking out from the box, testing the waters before a furry little head with the widest eyes he\u2019s ever seen besides y/n\u2019s follows. </p><p>Evie stays fairly quiet during the drive to their flat, but Harry is buzzing with excitement, keeping the little kitten as entertained as he can using his jumbled words while laughing in disbelief. She let out a few \u2018miaows\u2019 every now and then, but other than that, was content having her owner do the talking part for her. </p><p>By the time they\u2019re home, Harry\u2019s got her inside of that makeshift shoebox carrier, gently placing the holey top of the box onto the kitten\u2019s fluffy little head, indicating she should duck and curl up inside of the box, and the sweet little thing does, making him suppress another coo of wonder. He pushes the key into the keyhole with his ring clad fingers, twisting it before revealing a warm flat, holding the fragrance of his girlfriend\u2019s jasmine shampoo and the soft sound of her humming as she moved around the kitchen, probably putting together a sandwich for herself, and hopefully one for him, too. </p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he croons softly, still not over the voice he uses near the kitten. But how can he help it? Masculinity be damned, Evie was so small and soft, and her \u2018miaows\u2019 sounded more like \u2018mew\u2019s. \u201cCome look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re home,\u201d y/n says, her voice muffled as her cheeks are adorably filled with sandwich and puffing out as she moves towards him, extending her arms so they can wrap around his neck and so Harry can use his free arm to wrap around her waist in his T-shirt, showering his girlfriend with affection before he shows her what\u2019s he\u2019s gotten for the both of them. </p><p>\u201cWha\u2019s tha\u2019?\u201d She asks while she swallows, eyes flickering to the box keeping her from hugging her boyfriend properly. Harry smiles shyly at the question, his heart soft and hoping she would love Evie as much as he loved her already. </p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he hushes her voice down, urging her to be quieter, \u201cyou\u2019re about to be a mummy, gonna wake our baby up.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes widen at that, staring at him as if he\u2019d become a complete lunatic over the past few hours he\u2019s been out of the flat. </p><p>\u201cHave you gone mad? The pregnancy test we took last week came back negative,\u201d y/n reminds him, panic slowly swelling in her stomach as she begins to become skeptical of the test. Harry shakes his head, although a soft smile pulls at his lips as he fondly remembers how scared y/n was last week, because she had missed her period and was worried of the possibility she could be pregnant. The two of them had spent the evening taking the test and mustering the courage to look at it. Harry had reminded her that whatever happened, he would be there, and if there was a baby, he or she would be the most loved baby in the world. <i>Another time</i>,<i> </i>Harry thinks to himself. </p><p>\u201c\u2018S not that, lovie, \u2018s a-\u201c as Harry\u2019s about to explain just what, or <i>who</i> was inhabiting the shoe box, drawing y/n closer to the side of his chest, Evie had decided that was the exact moment she would bump the top of the shoe box off of her head and blink at Harry and y/n, miaowing softly before beginning to clean herself. </p><p>\u201c\u2018Ve brought you a kitten,\u201d Harry laughs nervously, waiting for y/n\u2019s reaction as she\u2019s gone stiff against his chest, making no movements or noises, simply staring at the domestic animal with unblinking eyes. </p><p>Evie lets out a pitched \u201cmew\u201d at the silence, feeling unsettled as all the attention and coos focused on her seemed to vanish. Not to mention, she wanted to be set on her feet and explore the flat, and know where her litter box was. Y/N is snapped out of her thoughts once the kitten she\u2019s looking at lets out the meek roar. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, Harry, she\u2019s so cute!\u201d y/n squeals, quieting down so she can stare at the cat in the shoe box with wide eyes filled with wonder, and Harry\u2019s heart thumps with joy and he presses a kiss to his girlfriend\u2019s forehead, arm slinging around her waist as he nudges the box right under her chest, onto her stomach, gesturing for her to hold it. But y/n seems to jerk away and Harry can <i>feel</i> the hesitation on her. </p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong, pretty girl?\u201d Harry asks, voice deep and slow enough to make her comfortable with answering. He looks at her with the kindest eyes and his intense gaze seems to figure her out instantly when he places the box onto the floor, helping the little kitten out and shaking his head softly in amusement when she moves her paws as fast as she can, immediately going for the crack under the sofa so she can hide. </p><p>\u201c\u2018s making you uncomfortable to touch her?\u201d he hums, crossing his warm arms over her stomach and pulling her in so his warm lips can rest at the nape of her neck. He feels her shuffle and nod embarrasedly in reply, and gives her a sympathetic kiss on the cheek, finding it oddly adorable at the same time. y/n didn\u2019t mind cats, she adored kittens and how soft and cute they were when they \u2018mew\u2019 or do anything, really. She just feared touching them, in fear of either hurting <i>them</i> , or them hurting <i>her. </i></p><p>\u201c\u2018S alright. Do you want me to give her back to Gemma?\u201d </p><p>As much as he had already grown deeply infatuated with the curious little thing, Harry knew y/n was more important and more of a priority than his fascination with cats. Besides, he couldn\u2019t just scare her like that on a daily basis, kittens had the tendency to wander up in places you wouldn\u2019t expect in a matter of seconds. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she quickly answered, cheeks flushing when Harry furrowed his eyebrows in confusion. y/n\u2019s own fingers met Harry\u2019s where they moved gently against her stomach. </p><p>\u201cI-i want to learn how to get close to them without being afraid. I want to get to the point where I can just pick her up and have a cuddle with her,\u201d she confesses, biting her lip. </p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll get you there,\u201d he promises, his chin resting on her forehead, their arms entwined on her waist as they sway back and forth, him leaning down occasionally to press a kiss to her forehead or cheek. </p><p>* * * </p><p>y/n\u2019s getting there. </p><p>Harry\u2019s been patient with her, incredibly patient. And it\u2019s wonderful, because everyone else seems to forget how the overcame the jitters a specific animal gave them, or forgot the jitters existed in the first place. Most people would play it off and tell y/n to get over it, simply dropping a squirming cat who could sense her panic onto her lap. Harry wasn\u2019t most people. He was incredibly gentle with her, never urging her to do anything she didn\u2019t want to, and he even offered to take the litter out on his own on a daily basis so it wouldn\u2019t cause the flat to waft with a deadly smell. </p><p>The kitten even had her own room, where Harry would rub that spot behind her ears until her eyes blinked at Harry, slowing down until they shut completely. <i>One day</i>, he figures, <i>Evie can snuggle between us at night. </i></p><p>y/n is always observing Harry when he picks up Evie, his large palms both first laying flat up against where her ribs end and thumbs holding her secure on her backside below her shoulders, so she can\u2019t scratch him. And if she\u2019s feeling uncomfortable, she\u2019ll squirm and her kitten claws will emerge from her soft paws. And that\u2019s another thing, her scratches and bites don\u2019t hurt. Harry figures she knows not to scratch deep into Harry or break any skin, only a gently tap will have her human understand she wants to be put down. The teeth might be, because she hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t grow adult teeth for quite a while. </p><p>y/n also notices Evie\u2019s stances, how she follows Harry around the flat, brushes up against him, and acts particularly affectionate when she\u2019s hungry. And she has a few favourite ones , too. y/n loves it when Evie wakes up, because she\u2019ll let out the cutest \u2018miaow\u2019 and then open her mouth wide open, stretching her head back and closing her eyes slightly as she yawns, her little pink tongue exposed. The first time y/n dared to pick the kitten up is when she wakes up, because she\u2019s particularly calm, after a well needed nap after playtime with Harry. She\u2019ll snuggle up against y/n\u2019s chest and maybe fall asleep, purring and meeping in her sleep. Or there\u2019s when she\u2019s eating her meals, she\u2019ll be immersed in the bowl of food that y/n can pet her as much as she\u2019s wanted to, and Evie won\u2019t care as long as she\u2019s being fed and looked after. And, of course, when Evie is served with a bowl of fresh water along with her meal and she\u2019ll lightly tap her paw into the bowl, testing of the water\u2019s temperature was up to par with her standards. </p><p>Pretty soon, y/n\u2019s washing her with \u2018no water\u2019 \u2018all natural\u2019 shampoo (which Evie takes calmly, because there\u2019s no water, and there are a lot of warm rubs from both of her owners) or giving her the very rare bath when she\u2019s particularly dirty, seeing as y/n and Harry don\u2019t want to stress the bright eyed kitten out. y/n even holds her on her lap while Harry cleans the litter box with a screwed up face, the reason being Evie gets pretty territorial when someone touches her litter box. </p><p>Evie loves y/n and Harry, too, despite the occasional moments when she thinks her owners are crazy when they press their limbs against each other when they shut the bedroom door, or when they\u2019re fighting over something silly. </p><p>* * * </p><p>One night, after a particularly long day at the studio, Harry comes home. He usually wouldn\u2019t have been this late, but he and y/n had gone to bed angry the last night after fighting over something that seemed so stupid now. Harry had left as early as possible the next morning, and now he could feel guilt running throughout him as he unlocked the door to their flat, stepping inside and expecting silence and darkness while his girlfriend slept. </p><p>Instead, Harry\u2019s eyebrows furrow and green eyes lighten in curiousity when he can hear deep rumbling purrs and \u2018mew\u2019s, mixed with the faint sounds of someone mumbling and sighing coming from the living room. Gently shutting the front door, Harry takes off his shoes and silently pads to the living room, cursing softly when he nearly steps on a squeaking rubber duck the kitten takes a particular interest in. Leaning over stepping into the room. </p><p>And there they are. y/n and Evie. </p><p>The faint sound of a Netflix show plays in the background, but all Harry can really focus on is his girlfriend, lying flat on her back on the couch, with the cat on her belly, purring contentedly. The both of them are talking in their sleep, mumbling nonsense that Harry just so happens to hold very dear to his heart. </p><p>He moves closer to the two of them, crouching down to first sponge a loving kiss onto y/n\u2019s soft and supple cheek, stroking it gently with her fingers, before taking his rings off and petting the cat resting on her belly, smirking softly as the kitten doesn\u2019t stop purring, but blinks her eyes wide open, letting out a yawn and soft meow before bumping her head against Harry\u2019s and then walking all over his girlfriend\u2019s belly, only to find that one spot and cuddle down once more. The movement, however, wakes y/n. </p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She hums, disoriented as she rubs her eyes, hand flying gently over the weight resting on her tummy. Her eyes flicker open and y/n gives Harry a smile that makes his heart skip a beat. </p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d he greets, his voice raspy and deep as he pushes his lips against hers tenderly while she scrapes her nails into his curls with her free hand, humming in sleepiness as Harry rests his head against her chest, enjoying the attention. The kitten suddenly lets out a small sneeze, and they\u2019re all frozen, y/n and Harry staring at the wide eyed kitten and beginning to chuckle and giggle at the look on Evie\u2019s face, seeing as she\u2019d scared herself with her own sneeze. </p><p>\u201cBless you, precious,\u201d y/n giggles, Harry following in suit as Evie settles down once more before letting out needy little cries that she just <i>knew </i>tugged at their heartstrings. </p><p>\u201cWhat are those \u2018miaows\u2019 for, hm, my love?\u201d y/n croons, \u201cis daddy home?\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s heart swells suddenly in his chest, his green eyes following every movement y/n made with the kitten, enlaced with love, affection and deep care. </p><p>\u201cBeen good for mumma, yeah?\u201d he can\u2019t help but ask in a tear filled, raspy voice, because he just loves the both of them so much, and if y/n can understand how emotional he is, she merely nods with a soft smile on her pretty face. </p><p>Harry thought it was impossible to fall deeper in love with y/n. But now that she\u2019s on his couch, sleepy and soft with a small, purring milky white and black kitten whose world revolves around y/n and him perched upon her belly snugly, Harry knows he\u2019s been proven wrong. </p><p>\u2022 </p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>The one where it\u2019s him, her, and Evie. </p><p><strike><i>wow trust me to create a series dedicated to harry, y/n and their cat. , idk i just decided to make a series of cat dad!harry and of them just being cat parents in general, bc i recently got a kitten on my birthday, and hArry got a kitten, too and i think life is better when you experience it with a kitten :,) </i></strike></p><p><a href=\"https://meet-me-in-the-kitchen.tumblr.com/post/176776998298/masterlist-yay-youve-reached-my-vault-of-things-i\"><b>MASTERLIST</b></a>|<b>Requests are open!</b></p></p>",

The both of them are talking in their sleep, mumbling nonsense that Harry just so happens to hold very dear to his heart. </p><p>He moves closer to the two of them, crouching down to first sponge a loving kiss onto y/n&rsquo;s soft and supple cheek, stroking it gently with her fingers, before taking his rings off and petting the cat resting on her belly, smirking softly as the kitten doesn&rsquo;t stop purring, but blinks her eyes wide open, letting out a yawn and soft meow before bumping her head against Harry&rsquo;s and then walking all over his girlfriend&rsquo;s belly, only to find that one spot and cuddle down once more. The movement, however, wakes y/n. </p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; She hums, disoriented as she rubs her eyes, hand flying gently over the weight resting on her tummy. Her eyes flicker open and y/n gives Harry a smile that makes his heart skip a beat. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, baby,&rdquo; he greets, his voice raspy and deep as he pushes his lips against hers tenderly while she scrapes her nails into his curls with her free hand, humming in sleepiness as Harry rests his head against her chest, enjoying the attention. The kitten suddenly lets out a small sneeze, and they&rsquo;re all frozen, y/n and Harry staring at the wide eyed kitten and beginning to chuckle and giggle at the look on Evie&rsquo;s face, seeing as she&rsquo;d scared herself with her own sneeze. </p><p>&ldquo;Bless you, precious,&rdquo; y/n giggles, Harry following in suit as Evie settles down once more before letting out needy little cries that she just <i>knew </i>tugged at their heartstrings. </p><p>&ldquo;What are those &lsquo;miaows&rsquo; for, hm, my love?&rdquo; y/n croons, &ldquo;is daddy home?&rdquo; </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart swells suddenly in his chest, his green eyes following every movement y/n made with the kitten, enlaced with love, affection and deep care. </p><p>&ldquo;Been good for mumma, yeah?&rdquo; he can&rsquo;t help but ask in a tear filled, raspy voice, because he just loves the both of them so much, and if y/n can understand how emotional he is, she merely nods with a soft smile on her pretty face. </p><p>Harry thought it was impossible to fall deeper in love with y/n. But now that she&rsquo;s on his couch, sleepy and soft with a small, purring milky white and black kitten whose world revolves around y/n and him perched upon her belly snugly, Harry knows he&rsquo;s been proven wrong. </p><p>&bull; </p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\">The one where it&rsquo;s him, her, and Evie. </p><p><strike><i>wow trust me to create a series dedicated to harry, y/n and their cat. , idk i just decided to make a series of cat dad!harry and of them just being cat parents in general, bc i recently got a kitten on my birthday, and hArry got a kitten, too and i think life is better when you experience it with a kitten :,) </i></strike></p><p><a href=\"https://meet-me-in-the-kitchen.tumblr.com/post/176776998298/masterlist-yay-youve-reached-my-vault-of-things-i\"><b>MASTERLIST</b></a>|<b>Requests are open!</b></p></p>",
