(I\u2019m so sorry for the ending *hides*. There may be a part 2 to this, haven\u2019t decided yet) - also there\u2019s hints at Y/N having anxiety and even a bit of depression in this so if that makes you\u00a0uncomfortable I am not\u00a0offended if you decide to skip reading this. As someone who suffers from\u00a0both sometimes, I\u00a0totally\u00a0understand. If you are someone who relates in that aspect keep your heads up loves, make the world your bitch, and own it;\u00a0I\u00a0know how hard that can be to do sometimes but you GOT this\u00a0Travis. Please\u00a0don&rsquo;t doubt how awesome you truly are. Ok this is long, I\u2019m sorry&hellip; But as a final note, if any of you and\u00a0I mean ANY of you ever just need a friendly\u00a0message or words of\u00a0encouragement please do not hesitate to send me a message, my ask is always open, and I\u2019m always down for a chat. Ok, shut up Ken&hellip;\u00a0</i></p><p>Four years is a long time, right? Over 1460 days most definitely gives you enough time to get to know a person on different levels of intimacy, seeing as they\u2019ve been such a constant thing in your life for so long&hellip; It\u2019s a good amount of time to develop a strong relationship.\u00a0</p><p>However, relationships are hard. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are, who you\u2019re with, or how you go about it; thinking relationships are an easy aspect of life is just unrealistic. And as much as you hate it, this is a thought that has inevitably made it\u2019s way into your mind a lot recently when thinking about your relationship with Harry.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d think some big thing like a fight would\u2019ve had to happen in order to bring on thoughts that make you question everything you have with him, but no, it didn\u2019t, and oh do you wish it could\u2019ve been that simple.\u00a0</p><p>A soft sigh escapes your mouth as you glance down at the curly haired boy who\u2019s gently nuzzled against your chest; tiredly watching a Friends rerun on the television in the large master bedroom of his New York City home. He doesn&rsquo;t notice your gaze as he let\u2019s out a yawn, and you continue gently massaging his head with your fingertips; watching as his eyes get droopier by the minute.\u00a0</p><p>Things are peaceful. You struggle to remember the last time the two of you shared a carefree night in like this, and although you appreciate the fact that you are able to spend an evening with your loving boyfriend; you can\u2019t help but think about how these nights are few and far between. Is this his fault? Absolutely not, and that\u2019s why you feel the need to keep your worrisome thoughts to yourself.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ve been finding yourself doing this a lot lately, and hadn\u2019t been too sure as to why; but recently it\u2019s been one thing after another that has just about pushed you to your boiling point&hellip; And sadly Harry has no knowledge of any of it.\u00a0</p><p>As confusing as it sounds; he has nothing, and everything to do with how you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s not his fault he&rsquo;s away all the time. It\u2019s part of his job, and you\u2019ve fully accepted this after years of being with someone who constantly has a light shone on them; however, it\u2019s also this same light that can make him blind to what\u2019s really going on with you, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\u00a0</p><p>Your love for Harry is unconditional, and there\u2019s not a part of you that doesn&rsquo;t think he feels the same; but with being away from each other for so long, and so often all on top of everything else&hellip; It sometimes just gets to be too much when certain thoughts plague your mind, and you&rsquo;re left alone to suffer from the diseased ideas they bring.\u00a0</p><p>Saying things have been rough for you lately is an understatement, and you\u2019re even more frustrated with how you aren\u2019t able to even express why you\u2019re feeling this way; but all you do know is that you want it to stop. However, when those tiny things just keep building up, the thought of those feelings diminishing seem to be just a mere dream you hope to come true&hellip; Yet it doesn&rsquo;t.\u00a0</p><p>Whether it be the comments fans have said about you, or even just your general feeling of not being <i>enough</i> for Harry; you\u2019ve come to the point where you don&rsquo;t know how much more you can take, and that scares the hell out of you.\u00a0</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t made for this life in the spotlight. You never wanted any part of it, but you did it for Harry, and he\u2019s why it\u2019s been worth it&hellip; but fuck. Is that worth the price of loosing yourself along the way? The determination you have to be the perfect girlfriend has become exhausting, which is why you\u2019ve been considering taking a break to step back and rethink it all; but how does one do that when the other half of the relationship knows nothing about these thoughts and fears you have?</p><p>Your love for this man cuddled against your side has always been enough for you, but the feeling of you not being enough for him is a whole other thing that continuously eats away at you. Naturally, you find yourself thinking of this once again until a deep groggy voice snaps you out of your insinuating thoughts; breaking your silent suffering.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d You ask, and shake your head before glancing down at your boyfriend; pushing his curls back from his face as he looks up at you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas saying how you look deep in thought,\u201d he replies, and starts sitting up from his position.\u00a0\u201cSomething on your mind, petal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, nothing,\u201d you stammer, and his green irises look at you with concern; his eyebrows furrowing in disbelief. \u201cNo really H, I&rsquo;m fine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he starts, but you cut him off by placing your lips to his in a soft, delicate kiss; leaning your forehead against his once the kiss is done, and hoping he doesn&rsquo;t keep digging. After a couple moments of you two staring at each other he finally lets out a breath, and glances away from your eyes.\u00a0\u201cI-I, m\u2019not sure if I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don&rsquo;t believe me?\u201d You scoff, getting slightly defensive.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d he begins, and starts gently tracing his finger against the exposed skin of your hip affectionately.\u00a0\u201cI dunno, you just got into New York today, and kind of have been distant. Is there something bugging you? Any thing I can help with? You know you can talk to me about things, right love? Doesn\u2019t matter what it is.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you tell him honestly, because it is true - you know you can tell him anything, but you don\u2019t have it in you to burden him with your problems and doubts; especially with tomorrow being so extremely important&hellip; So you don\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s ok H, I\u2019m just tired. Let\u2019s get some rest, you&rsquo;ve got a big day coming up.\u201d</p><p>You can see in his eyes how badly he wants to keep pushing you to open up, but that\u2019s just it; he doesn\u2019t <i>want</i> to push you, he just deeply wants you to know he\u2019s here for you even though you&rsquo;re struggling in realizing that fact. So he drops it, and decides getting a good nights sleep may be beneficial.\u00a0\u201cOk,\u201d he sighs in defeat.\u00a0\u201cOne more episode of Friends, and then I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Once Harry falls asleep cuddled up beside you, you lay awake; allowing your overthinking mind to take over again, and keeping you up into late hours of the night.\u00a0</p><p>The next morning is rough, seeing as you have no desire to get out of bed and contribute to society in the slightest, and Harry easily picks up on it. However, just as he comes out of the washroom\u00a0with the towel wrapped loosely around his waist; he finds himself peppered with kisses from you, out of bed, and ready to start the day.\u00a0</p><p>Confused is an understatement of what he\u2019s feeling, but he also understands. He\u2019s known for a while now that you get times where anxiety and depression take so much control over you, and it breaks his heart seeing it affect you without knowing if he can do anything to help ease it for you&hellip;. So he lets you be, and hopes that maybe what he has planned for tonight can lighten your spirits a little bit.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you have a simple morning, that leads to some morning sex, which leads to Harry having to take another shower with you before actually getting ready. Your mood has shifted completely, which you couldn&rsquo;t be more glad about because you really want to be there for your boyfriend on such an special night; despite the nagging thoughts that still lurk in the back of your mind.\u00a0</p><p>As many people know by now, Harry is co-hosting this years Met Gala&hellip; And it\u2019s a really big deal. Sure, he didn\u2019t act like it was when he told you about it, or when he asked you to be his date there; but you knew deep down how excited he was for this night.\u00a0</p><p>When the time comes, you both prepare to leave the apartment and head to the event; so you can walk up the infamous MET steps in your fancy outfits, together&hellip; In front of all those other people. Great. \u00a0</p><p>Nervousness has creeped it\u2019s way back into your mind as you sit in the back of the car with H; your knee involuntarily bouncing up and down as you watch the streets of Manhattan whiz by you outside.\u00a0</p><p>Harry observes this, and bites down on his bottom lip unsurely.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d He asks; breaking the silence and causing you to snap your gaze to him.\u00a0\u201cY-You look absolutely breathtaking, love. Just like always, but wow.\u201d</p><p>You smile shyly as you feel the blush beginning to cover your face, and tuck a stray piece of hair behind you ear.\u00a0\u201cThanks, H. You do as well.\u201d</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t respond as he gently grabs ahold of your hand, and starts stroking the back of it with his thumb.\u00a0\u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d He questions after a moment, and you let out a breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you tell him with an unconvincing nod.\u00a0\u201cI mean, yes I want to be here for you&hellip; But I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to <i>be</i> here, you know? Would much rather be at home with you rather than at this major event, but I\u2019ll be ok. I have you there with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he replies, and leans in to meet your lips in a tender kiss. Neither of you break away, until you feel the car beginning to come to a stop, and know it\u2019s time to get this show on the road. Harry moves away slightly, and softly puts his hand under your chin so you\u2019ll meet his gaze.\u00a0\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d you state with a small smile.\u00a0\u201cSo much. Now go knock \u2018em dead.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He feels as if his heart is swelling out of his chest at your words, and leans in to place one last kiss to your cheek. The goofy grin he has on his mouth as he pulls away to climb out of the door that\u2019s just been open for him doesn&rsquo;t fade, and is the first thing the cameras capture when he steps foot onto the red carpet. He waves at the photographers, and his smile widens as he turns around to help you out of the car; subtly making sure the small boxed item he placed into his pocket remains there for when he plans on using it later, once he\u2019s alone with you again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d He asks as the car door gets shut behind the two of you, and you nod. One last soft peck is placed to your temple before the two of you start walking along the red carpet, making sure to pose for some pictures as you go. Both of you come to a stop at the base of the steps in front of the last group of photographers, and that\u2019s when you become tense again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, is it true you&rsquo;re only using Harry for his money?\u201d One of the reporters ask, and you physically stiffen. You can feel the panic raising in your chest, as Harry snakes his arm protectively around your waist, and scowls in the direction of the person.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you not start with this, please?\u201d Your boyfriend asks politely, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about that dress?\u201d Another reporter speaks up.\u00a0\u201cAs someone who has just finished university, that must\u2019ve cost quite a bit of money. Did Harry buy it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell uh, yes,\u201d you stammer, and try to blink back tears as this statement sends them into frenzy almost.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you <i>do</i> use him for his money,\u201d the first reporter states as she writes something down in her notebook.\u00a0\u201cWhat about you seeing him on tour, there\u2019s no way you paid for all those trips with your simple paying job. It was Harry wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with anything?\u201d Harry snaps, and you flinch slightly at his tone.\u00a0\u201cYou know nothing about our relationship, or just how hard Y/N works her ass off for everything she does. So what if I bought her a nice dress to wear tonight? She\u2019s my girlfriend and I\u2019m allowed to do things like that. Also, not that it\u2019s any of your business, but she wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to pay for those plane tickets to come visit me while on tour. Now please, back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if it isn&rsquo;t the money, she must be in it for the fame,\u201d someone else yells, and that\u2019s when a tear finally breaks free.\u00a0</p><p>You glance up at Harry, and can see his face visibly reddening.\u00a0\u201cHarry,\u201d you start softly, but it\u2019s no use as he continues glaring daggers at the paparazzi, while they continue taking jabs at you. With a gentle tug on his sleeve, he finally glances down at you, and his hard gaze instantly softens.\u00a0\u201cCan we go,\u00a0<i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>He nods in agreement to your pleas, and leads you away from the crowd of people still calling after the two of you. Without looking back, you both weave through the other celebrities attending the event, and you try not to make eye contact with some of their judgemental gazes.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the two of you are through the doors, you let go of Harry\u2019s hand and try to catch your breath. The panicky feeling you have doesn\u2019t subside, and the sight of you on the verge of hyperventilation crushes his heart.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d He asks softly, and reaches out to touch your arm; but you quickly move away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t do this anymore H,\u201d you tell him breathlessly as the tears continue streaming down your face; trying to take control of the panic attack you are having.\u00a0\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>You start to walk away, but he quickly runs around to be in front of you.\u00a0\u201cCan&rsquo;t do this anymore?\u201d He questions; the fear and worry of what\u2019s to come evident in his green orbs.\u00a0\u201cY/N, n-no. I know what they were saying out there was awful, and\u00a0I&rsquo;m sorry they were just so <i>mean</i> to you&hellip; But you\u2019ll be ok, right? We\u2019ll be ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll <i>pretend</i> to be ok&hellip; Just like I always do,\u201d you reply, and choke back a sob. The hurt and confusion that flashes in his eyes indicates that he truly doesn&rsquo;t know what\u2019s going on with you, so you decide it\u2019s time to let him know.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m tired, H. I\u2019m tired, and\u00a0I&rsquo;m hurt because it seems that whatever I do; it can never be enough. I\u2019ve tried so hard to not let any of those things people say get to me, but it\u2019s really hard when I have this constant thought nagging at me; telling me I\u2019m worthless, and never truly will be enough for someone as amazing as you. And that\u2019s ok. As much as it kills me to say, you will still succeed without me. You don\u2019t <i>need</i> me Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N you don\u2019t know what I need,\u201d he argues, and grabs ahold of your hand desperately.\u00a0\u201cBecause if you did, you\u2019d know the only thing I do need is you. I don\u2019t care about all of this. Sure it\u2019s nice, but I don&rsquo;t want any of it if you&rsquo;re not there to experience it with me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t see as he reaches into his pocket, and clutches the little box that resides there; rubbing his thumb over it\u2019s smooth felt material, as you start going off again.\u00a0\u201cDo you even hear yourself right now?\u201d You ask incredulously.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard for all of this, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you throw it away&hellip; So I\u2019m just going to go. I won&rsquo;t be back at the apartment when you return, don\u2019t worry if I leave things; I\u2019ll deal with them when I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so you\u2019re leaving me?\u201d He questions unsurely, as the tears are evidently welled up in his eyes at this point as well.\u00a0\u201cBabe, please don&rsquo;t say stuff like that. Y-You\u2019re my whole world, I-I really do need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I need a break,\u201d you explain, voice cracking as you do so.\u00a0\u201cThese last four years with you have been the best of my life, but they\u2019ve also been the most stressful Harry. I can\u2019t keep putting myself through constant worry and fear that I will never be worthy of being your girlfriend, let alone even knowing you. I know you\u2019re going to argue this, but please don\u2019t. I truly think I need a break, from everything really. I need time to find myself again, and not think about what the world is constantly saying about me; especially when it comes to my relationship with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn&rsquo;t the end, right?\u201d He asks desperately; ignoring the stares the two of you have earned from other event goers.\u00a0\u201cY/N, I don&rsquo;t know what you expect me to do after just telling me you want to break up out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you to keep going,\u201d you tell him softly.\u00a0\u201cGo on without me, Harry. Co-host this major event, keep amazing your fans with your incredible talent, keep&hellip; being you. You were this incredible person long before I came along, and will be after as well; it\u2019s what made me fall in love with you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it. You\u2019ve fallen out of love with me,\u201d he states monotonously. \u00a0\u201cI wish you would\u2019ve told me before it got this bad, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all,\u201d you reason with him, and gently cup his cheek with your hand.\u00a0\u201cI could never fall out of love with you, but\u00a0I&rsquo;ve fallen out of love with myself. My mind has been a dark place recently, and I really need to try and change that. Which is also why I didn\u2019t say anything. I need to deal with this,\u00a0alone.\u201d He glances away from you sadly; hurt by how he truly cannot help you in this situation, and that thought itself slowly kills him. You glance behind him at the people getting ready to start the event, and decide it\u2019s time that you go; but not without one final kiss.\u00a0\u201cI love you, H. With all my heart.\u201d</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t say anything else once your lips part from his, but wants nothing more than to savour the feeling of you here with him. You send him one last sad smile before wiping away some tears, and heading towards a separate exit so a security guard can escort you out.\u00a0</p><p>A couple minutes pass, and he still stands there shell-shocked until Jeff comes up to shake him out of it. He doesn\u2019t register anything his manager and close friend says as he pulls the small box out of his pocket, and flips it open; revealing a stunning diamond engagement ring inside of it that he\u2019s had purchased for months now, with the word\u00a0\u2018forever\u2019 engraved on the inside of the shiny gold band.\u00a0\u201cShe left,\u201d he whispers defeatedly to himself, but Jeff is quick picking up on what he&rsquo;s getting at as his friends tear filled eyes meets his own.\u00a0\u201cShe left me, and I didn&rsquo;t even get the chance to ask her&hellip; I was too late.\u201d</p>",

(I\u2019m so sorry for the ending *hides*. There may be a part 2 to this, haven\u2019t decided yet) - also there\u2019s hints at Y/N having anxiety and even a bit of depression in this so if that makes you\u00a0uncomfortable I am not\u00a0offended if you decide to skip reading this. As someone who suffers from\u00a0both sometimes, I\u00a0totally\u00a0understand. If you are someone who relates in that aspect keep your heads up loves, make the world your bitch, and own it;\u00a0I\u00a0know how hard that can be to do sometimes but you GOT this\u00a0Travis. Please\u00a0don\u2019t doubt how awesome you truly are. Ok this is long, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 But as a final note, if any of you and\u00a0I mean ANY of you ever just need a friendly\u00a0message or words of\u00a0encouragement please do not hesitate to send me a message, my ask is always open, and I\u2019m always down for a chat. Ok, shut up Ken\u2026\u00a0</i></p><p>Four years is a long time, right? Over 1460 days most definitely gives you enough time to get to know a person on different levels of intimacy, seeing as they\u2019ve been such a constant thing in your life for so long\u2026 It\u2019s a good amount of time to develop a strong relationship.\u00a0</p><p>However, relationships are hard. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, who you\u2019re with, or how you go about it; thinking relationships are an easy aspect of life is just unrealistic. And as much as you hate it, this is a thought that has inevitably made it\u2019s way into your mind a lot recently when thinking about your relationship with Harry.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d think some big thing like a fight would\u2019ve had to happen in order to bring on thoughts that make you question everything you have with him, but no, it didn\u2019t, and oh do you wish it could\u2019ve been that simple.\u00a0</p><p>A soft sigh escapes your mouth as you glance down at the curly haired boy who\u2019s gently nuzzled against your chest; tiredly watching a Friends rerun on the television in the large master bedroom of his New York City home. He doesn\u2019t notice your gaze as he let\u2019s out a yawn, and you continue gently massaging his head with your fingertips; watching as his eyes get droopier by the minute.\u00a0</p><p>Things are peaceful. You struggle to remember the last time the two of you shared a carefree night in like this, and although you appreciate the fact that you are able to spend an evening with your loving boyfriend; you can\u2019t help but think about how these nights are few and far between. Is this his fault? Absolutely not, and that\u2019s why you feel the need to keep your worrisome thoughts to yourself.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ve been finding yourself doing this a lot lately, and hadn\u2019t been too sure as to why; but recently it\u2019s been one thing after another that has just about pushed you to your boiling point\u2026 And sadly Harry has no knowledge of any of it.\u00a0</p><p>As confusing as it sounds; he has nothing, and everything to do with how you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s away all the time. It\u2019s part of his job, and you\u2019ve fully accepted this after years of being with someone who constantly has a light shone on them; however, it\u2019s also this same light that can make him blind to what\u2019s really going on with you, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\u00a0</p><p>Your love for Harry is unconditional, and there\u2019s not a part of you that doesn\u2019t think he feels the same; but with being away from each other for so long, and so often all on top of everything else\u2026 It sometimes just gets to be too much when certain thoughts plague your mind, and you\u2019re left alone to suffer from the diseased ideas they bring.\u00a0</p><p>Saying things have been rough for you lately is an understatement, and you\u2019re even more frustrated with how you aren\u2019t able to even express why you\u2019re feeling this way; but all you do know is that you want it to stop. However, when those tiny things just keep building up, the thought of those feelings diminishing seem to be just a mere dream you hope to come true\u2026 Yet it doesn\u2019t.\u00a0</p><p>Whether it be the comments fans have said about you, or even just your general feeling of not being <i>enough</i> for Harry; you\u2019ve come to the point where you don\u2019t know how much more you can take, and that scares the hell out of you.\u00a0</p><p>You weren\u2019t made for this life in the spotlight. You never wanted any part of it, but you did it for Harry, and he\u2019s why it\u2019s been worth it\u2026 but fuck. Is that worth the price of loosing yourself along the way? The determination you have to be the perfect girlfriend has become exhausting, which is why you\u2019ve been considering taking a break to step back and rethink it all; but how does one do that when the other half of the relationship knows nothing about these thoughts and fears you have?</p><p>Your love for this man cuddled against your side has always been enough for you, but the feeling of you not being enough for him is a whole other thing that continuously eats away at you. Naturally, you find yourself thinking of this once again until a deep groggy voice snaps you out of your insinuating thoughts; breaking your silent suffering.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d You ask, and shake your head before glancing down at your boyfriend; pushing his curls back from his face as he looks up at you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas saying how you look deep in thought,\u201d he replies, and starts sitting up from his position.\u00a0\u201cSomething on your mind, petal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, nothing,\u201d you stammer, and his green irises look at you with concern; his eyebrows furrowing in disbelief. \u201cNo really H, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he starts, but you cut him off by placing your lips to his in a soft, delicate kiss; leaning your forehead against his once the kiss is done, and hoping he doesn\u2019t keep digging. After a couple moments of you two staring at each other he finally lets out a breath, and glances away from your eyes.\u00a0\u201cI-I, m\u2019not sure if I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d You scoff, getting slightly defensive.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d he begins, and starts gently tracing his finger against the exposed skin of your hip affectionately.\u00a0\u201cI dunno, you just got into New York today, and kind of have been distant. Is there something bugging you? Any thing I can help with? You know you can talk to me about things, right love? Doesn\u2019t matter what it is.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you tell him honestly, because it is true - you know you can tell him anything, but you don\u2019t have it in you to burden him with your problems and doubts; especially with tomorrow being so extremely important\u2026 So you don\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s ok H, I\u2019m just tired. Let\u2019s get some rest, you\u2019ve got a big day coming up.\u201d</p><p>You can see in his eyes how badly he wants to keep pushing you to open up, but that\u2019s just it; he doesn\u2019t <i>want</i> to push you, he just deeply wants you to know he\u2019s here for you even though you\u2019re struggling in realizing that fact. So he drops it, and decides getting a good nights sleep may be beneficial.\u00a0\u201cOk,\u201d he sighs in defeat.\u00a0\u201cOne more episode of Friends, and then I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Once Harry falls asleep cuddled up beside you, you lay awake; allowing your overthinking mind to take over again, and keeping you up into late hours of the night.\u00a0</p><p>The next morning is rough, seeing as you have no desire to get out of bed and contribute to society in the slightest, and Harry easily picks up on it. However, just as he comes out of the washroom\u00a0with the towel wrapped loosely around his waist; he finds himself peppered with kisses from you, out of bed, and ready to start the day.\u00a0</p><p>Confused is an understatement of what he\u2019s feeling, but he also understands. He\u2019s known for a while now that you get times where anxiety and depression take so much control over you, and it breaks his heart seeing it affect you without knowing if he can do anything to help ease it for you\u2026. So he lets you be, and hopes that maybe what he has planned for tonight can lighten your spirits a little bit.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you have a simple morning, that leads to some morning sex, which leads to Harry having to take another shower with you before actually getting ready. Your mood has shifted completely, which you couldn\u2019t be more glad about because you really want to be there for your boyfriend on such an special night; despite the nagging thoughts that still lurk in the back of your mind.\u00a0</p><p>As many people know by now, Harry is co-hosting this years Met Gala\u2026 And it\u2019s a really big deal. Sure, he didn\u2019t act like it was when he told you about it, or when he asked you to be his date there; but you knew deep down how excited he was for this night.\u00a0</p><p>When the time comes, you both prepare to leave the apartment and head to the event; so you can walk up the infamous MET steps in your fancy outfits, together\u2026 In front of all those other people. Great. \u00a0</p><p>Nervousness has creeped it\u2019s way back into your mind as you sit in the back of the car with H; your knee involuntarily bouncing up and down as you watch the streets of Manhattan whiz by you outside.\u00a0</p><p>Harry observes this, and bites down on his bottom lip unsurely.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d He asks; breaking the silence and causing you to snap your gaze to him.\u00a0\u201cY-You look absolutely breathtaking, love. Just like always, but wow.\u201d</p><p>You smile shyly as you feel the blush beginning to cover your face, and tuck a stray piece of hair behind you ear.\u00a0\u201cThanks, H. You do as well.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond as he gently grabs ahold of your hand, and starts stroking the back of it with his thumb.\u00a0\u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d He questions after a moment, and you let out a breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you tell him with an unconvincing nod.\u00a0\u201cI mean, yes I want to be here for you\u2026 But I don\u2019t necessarily want to <i>be</i> here, you know? Would much rather be at home with you rather than at this major event, but I\u2019ll be ok. I have you there with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he replies, and leans in to meet your lips in a tender kiss. Neither of you break away, until you feel the car beginning to come to a stop, and know it\u2019s time to get this show on the road. Harry moves away slightly, and softly puts his hand under your chin so you\u2019ll meet his gaze.\u00a0\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d you state with a small smile.\u00a0\u201cSo much. Now go knock \u2018em dead.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He feels as if his heart is swelling out of his chest at your words, and leans in to place one last kiss to your cheek. The goofy grin he has on his mouth as he pulls away to climb out of the door that\u2019s just been open for him doesn\u2019t fade, and is the first thing the cameras capture when he steps foot onto the red carpet. He waves at the photographers, and his smile widens as he turns around to help you out of the car; subtly making sure the small boxed item he placed into his pocket remains there for when he plans on using it later, once he\u2019s alone with you again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d He asks as the car door gets shut behind the two of you, and you nod. One last soft peck is placed to your temple before the two of you start walking along the red carpet, making sure to pose for some pictures as you go. Both of you come to a stop at the base of the steps in front of the last group of photographers, and that\u2019s when you become tense again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, is it true you\u2019re only using Harry for his money?\u201d One of the reporters ask, and you physically stiffen. You can feel the panic raising in your chest, as Harry snakes his arm protectively around your waist, and scowls in the direction of the person.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you not start with this, please?\u201d Your boyfriend asks politely, but it doesn\u2019t stop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about that dress?\u201d Another reporter speaks up.\u00a0\u201cAs someone who has just finished university, that must\u2019ve cost quite a bit of money. Did Harry buy it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell uh, yes,\u201d you stammer, and try to blink back tears as this statement sends them into frenzy almost.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you <i>do</i> use him for his money,\u201d the first reporter states as she writes something down in her notebook.\u00a0\u201cWhat about you seeing him on tour, there\u2019s no way you paid for all those trips with your simple paying job. It was Harry wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with anything?\u201d Harry snaps, and you flinch slightly at his tone.\u00a0\u201cYou know nothing about our relationship, or just how hard Y/N works her ass off for everything she does. So what if I bought her a nice dress to wear tonight? She\u2019s my girlfriend and I\u2019m allowed to do things like that. Also, not that it\u2019s any of your business, but she wouldn\u2019t allow me to pay for those plane tickets to come visit me while on tour. Now please, back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if it isn\u2019t the money, she must be in it for the fame,\u201d someone else yells, and that\u2019s when a tear finally breaks free.\u00a0</p><p>You glance up at Harry, and can see his face visibly reddening.\u00a0\u201cHarry,\u201d you start softly, but it\u2019s no use as he continues glaring daggers at the paparazzi, while they continue taking jabs at you. With a gentle tug on his sleeve, he finally glances down at you, and his hard gaze instantly softens.\u00a0\u201cCan we go,\u00a0<i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>He nods in agreement to your pleas, and leads you away from the crowd of people still calling after the two of you. Without looking back, you both weave through the other celebrities attending the event, and you try not to make eye contact with some of their judgemental gazes.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the two of you are through the doors, you let go of Harry\u2019s hand and try to catch your breath. The panicky feeling you have doesn\u2019t subside, and the sight of you on the verge of hyperventilation crushes his heart.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d He asks softly, and reaches out to touch your arm; but you quickly move away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t do this anymore H,\u201d you tell him breathlessly as the tears continue streaming down your face; trying to take control of the panic attack you are having.\u00a0\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>You start to walk away, but he quickly runs around to be in front of you.\u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t do this anymore?\u201d He questions; the fear and worry of what\u2019s to come evident in his green orbs.\u00a0\u201cY/N, n-no. I know what they were saying out there was awful, and\u00a0I\u2019m sorry they were just so <i>mean</i> to you\u2026 But you\u2019ll be ok, right? We\u2019ll be ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll <i>pretend</i> to be ok\u2026 Just like I always do,\u201d you reply, and choke back a sob. The hurt and confusion that flashes in his eyes indicates that he truly doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you, so you decide it\u2019s time to let him know.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m tired, H. I\u2019m tired, and\u00a0I\u2019m hurt because it seems that whatever I do; it can never be enough. I\u2019ve tried so hard to not let any of those things people say get to me, but it\u2019s really hard when I have this constant thought nagging at me; telling me I\u2019m worthless, and never truly will be enough for someone as amazing as you. And that\u2019s ok. As much as it kills me to say, you will still succeed without me. You don\u2019t <i>need</i> me Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N you don\u2019t know what I need,\u201d he argues, and grabs ahold of your hand desperately.\u00a0\u201cBecause if you did, you\u2019d know the only thing I do need is you. I don\u2019t care about all of this. Sure it\u2019s nice, but I don\u2019t want any of it if you\u2019re not there to experience it with me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t see as he reaches into his pocket, and clutches the little box that resides there; rubbing his thumb over it\u2019s smooth felt material, as you start going off again.\u00a0\u201cDo you even hear yourself right now?\u201d You ask incredulously.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard for all of this, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you throw it away\u2026 So I\u2019m just going to go. I won\u2019t be back at the apartment when you return, don\u2019t worry if I leave things; I\u2019ll deal with them when I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so you\u2019re leaving me?\u201d He questions unsurely, as the tears are evidently welled up in his eyes at this point as well.\u00a0\u201cBabe, please don\u2019t say stuff like that. Y-You\u2019re my whole world, I-I really do need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I need a break,\u201d you explain, voice cracking as you do so.\u00a0\u201cThese last four years with you have been the best of my life, but they\u2019ve also been the most stressful Harry. I can\u2019t keep putting myself through constant worry and fear that I will never be worthy of being your girlfriend, let alone even knowing you. I know you\u2019re going to argue this, but please don\u2019t. I truly think I need a break, from everything really. I need time to find myself again, and not think about what the world is constantly saying about me; especially when it comes to my relationship with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t the end, right?\u201d He asks desperately; ignoring the stares the two of you have earned from other event goers.\u00a0\u201cY/N, I don\u2019t know what you expect me to do after just telling me you want to break up out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you to keep going,\u201d you tell him softly.\u00a0\u201cGo on without me, Harry. Co-host this major event, keep amazing your fans with your incredible talent, keep\u2026 being you. You were this incredible person long before I came along, and will be after as well; it\u2019s what made me fall in love with you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it. You\u2019ve fallen out of love with me,\u201d he states monotonously. \u00a0\u201cI wish you would\u2019ve told me before it got this bad, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all,\u201d you reason with him, and gently cup his cheek with your hand.\u00a0\u201cI could never fall out of love with you, but\u00a0I\u2019ve fallen out of love with myself. My mind has been a dark place recently, and I really need to try and change that. Which is also why I didn\u2019t say anything. I need to deal with this,\u00a0alone.\u201d He glances away from you sadly; hurt by how he truly cannot help you in this situation, and that thought itself slowly kills him. You glance behind him at the people getting ready to start the event, and decide it\u2019s time that you go; but not without one final kiss.\u00a0\u201cI love you, H. With all my heart.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else once your lips part from his, but wants nothing more than to savour the feeling of you here with him. You send him one last sad smile before wiping away some tears, and heading towards a separate exit so a security guard can escort you out.\u00a0</p><p>A couple minutes pass, and he still stands there shell-shocked until Jeff comes up to shake him out of it. He doesn\u2019t register anything his manager and close friend says as he pulls the small box out of his pocket, and flips it open; revealing a stunning diamond engagement ring inside of it that he\u2019s had purchased for months now, with the word\u00a0\u2018forever\u2019 engraved on the inside of the shiny gold band.\u00a0\u201cShe left,\u201d he whispers defeatedly to himself, but Jeff is quick picking up on what he\u2019s getting at as his friends tear filled eyes meets his own.\u00a0\u201cShe left me, and I didn\u2019t even get the chance to ask her\u2026 I was too late.\u201d</p></p>",

(I\u2019m so sorry for the ending *hides*. There may be a part 2 to this, haven\u2019t decided yet) - also there\u2019s hints at Y/N having anxiety and even a bit of depression in this so if that makes you\u00a0uncomfortable I am not\u00a0offended if you decide to skip reading this. As someone who suffers from\u00a0both sometimes, I\u00a0totally\u00a0understand. If you are someone who relates in that aspect keep your heads up loves, make the world your bitch, and own it;\u00a0I\u00a0know how hard that can be to do sometimes but you GOT this\u00a0Travis. Please\u00a0don\u2019t doubt how awesome you truly are. Ok this is long, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 But as a final note, if any of you and\u00a0I mean ANY of you ever just need a friendly\u00a0message or words of\u00a0encouragement please do not hesitate to send me a message, my ask is always open, and I\u2019m always down for a chat. Ok, shut up Ken\u2026\u00a0</i></p><p>Four years is a long time, right? Over 1460 days most definitely gives you enough time to get to know a person on different levels of intimacy, seeing as they\u2019ve been such a constant thing in your life for so long\u2026 It\u2019s a good amount of time to develop a strong relationship.\u00a0</p><p>However, relationships are hard. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, who you\u2019re with, or how you go about it; thinking relationships are an easy aspect of life is just unrealistic. And as much as you hate it, this is a thought that has inevitably made it\u2019s way into your mind a lot recently when thinking about your relationship with Harry.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d think some big thing like a fight would\u2019ve had to happen in order to bring on thoughts that make you question everything you have with him, but no, it didn\u2019t, and oh do you wish it could\u2019ve been that simple.\u00a0</p><p>A soft sigh escapes your mouth as you glance down at the curly haired boy who\u2019s gently nuzzled against your chest; tiredly watching a Friends rerun on the television in the large master bedroom of his New York City home. He doesn\u2019t notice your gaze as he let\u2019s out a yawn, and you continue gently massaging his head with your fingertips; watching as his eyes get droopier by the minute.\u00a0</p><p>Things are peaceful. You struggle to remember the last time the two of you shared a carefree night in like this, and although you appreciate the fact that you are able to spend an evening with your loving boyfriend; you can\u2019t help but think about how these nights are few and far between. Is this his fault? Absolutely not, and that\u2019s why you feel the need to keep your worrisome thoughts to yourself.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ve been finding yourself doing this a lot lately, and hadn\u2019t been too sure as to why; but recently it\u2019s been one thing after another that has just about pushed you to your boiling point\u2026 And sadly Harry has no knowledge of any of it.\u00a0</p><p>As confusing as it sounds; he has nothing, and everything to do with how you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s away all the time. It\u2019s part of his job, and you\u2019ve fully accepted this after years of being with someone who constantly has a light shone on them; however, it\u2019s also this same light that can make him blind to what\u2019s really going on with you, and that\u2019s the hardest part.\u00a0</p><p>Your love for Harry is unconditional, and there\u2019s not a part of you that doesn\u2019t think he feels the same; but with being away from each other for so long, and so often all on top of everything else\u2026 It sometimes just gets to be too much when certain thoughts plague your mind, and you\u2019re left alone to suffer from the diseased ideas they bring.\u00a0</p><p>Saying things have been rough for you lately is an understatement, and you\u2019re even more frustrated with how you aren\u2019t able to even express why you\u2019re feeling this way; but all you do know is that you want it to stop. However, when those tiny things just keep building up, the thought of those feelings diminishing seem to be just a mere dream you hope to come true\u2026 Yet it doesn\u2019t.\u00a0</p><p>Whether it be the comments fans have said about you, or even just your general feeling of not being <i>enough</i> for Harry; you\u2019ve come to the point where you don\u2019t know how much more you can take, and that scares the hell out of you.\u00a0</p><p>You weren\u2019t made for this life in the spotlight. You never wanted any part of it, but you did it for Harry, and he\u2019s why it\u2019s been worth it\u2026 but fuck. Is that worth the price of loosing yourself along the way? The determination you have to be the perfect girlfriend has become exhausting, which is why you\u2019ve been considering taking a break to step back and rethink it all; but how does one do that when the other half of the relationship knows nothing about these thoughts and fears you have?</p><p>Your love for this man cuddled against your side has always been enough for you, but the feeling of you not being enough for him is a whole other thing that continuously eats away at you. Naturally, you find yourself thinking of this once again until a deep groggy voice snaps you out of your insinuating thoughts; breaking your silent suffering.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d You ask, and shake your head before glancing down at your boyfriend; pushing his curls back from his face as he looks up at you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas saying how you look deep in thought,\u201d he replies, and starts sitting up from his position.\u00a0\u201cSomething on your mind, petal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, nothing,\u201d you stammer, and his green irises look at you with concern; his eyebrows furrowing in disbelief. \u201cNo really H, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he starts, but you cut him off by placing your lips to his in a soft, delicate kiss; leaning your forehead against his once the kiss is done, and hoping he doesn\u2019t keep digging. After a couple moments of you two staring at each other he finally lets out a breath, and glances away from your eyes.\u00a0\u201cI-I, m\u2019not sure if I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d You scoff, getting slightly defensive.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d he begins, and starts gently tracing his finger against the exposed skin of your hip affectionately.\u00a0\u201cI dunno, you just got into New York today, and kind of have been distant. Is there something bugging you? Any thing I can help with? You know you can talk to me about things, right love? Doesn\u2019t matter what it is.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you tell him honestly, because it is true - you know you can tell him anything, but you don\u2019t have it in you to burden him with your problems and doubts; especially with tomorrow being so extremely important\u2026 So you don\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s ok H, I\u2019m just tired. Let\u2019s get some rest, you\u2019ve got a big day coming up.\u201d</p><p>You can see in his eyes how badly he wants to keep pushing you to open up, but that\u2019s just it; he doesn\u2019t <i>want</i> to push you, he just deeply wants you to know he\u2019s here for you even though you\u2019re struggling in realizing that fact. So he drops it, and decides getting a good nights sleep may be beneficial.\u00a0\u201cOk,\u201d he sighs in defeat.\u00a0\u201cOne more episode of Friends, and then I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Once Harry falls asleep cuddled up beside you, you lay awake; allowing your overthinking mind to take over again, and keeping you up into late hours of the night.\u00a0</p><p>The next morning is rough, seeing as you have no desire to get out of bed and contribute to society in the slightest, and Harry easily picks up on it. However, just as he comes out of the washroom\u00a0with the towel wrapped loosely around his waist; he finds himself peppered with kisses from you, out of bed, and ready to start the day.\u00a0</p><p>Confused is an understatement of what he\u2019s feeling, but he also understands. He\u2019s known for a while now that you get times where anxiety and depression take so much control over you, and it breaks his heart seeing it affect you without knowing if he can do anything to help ease it for you\u2026. So he lets you be, and hopes that maybe what he has planned for tonight can lighten your spirits a little bit.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you have a simple morning, that leads to some morning sex, which leads to Harry having to take another shower with you before actually getting ready. Your mood has shifted completely, which you couldn\u2019t be more glad about because you really want to be there for your boyfriend on such an special night; despite the nagging thoughts that still lurk in the back of your mind.\u00a0</p><p>As many people know by now, Harry is co-hosting this years Met Gala\u2026 And it\u2019s a really big deal. Sure, he didn\u2019t act like it was when he told you about it, or when he asked you to be his date there; but you knew deep down how excited he was for this night.\u00a0</p><p>When the time comes, you both prepare to leave the apartment and head to the event; so you can walk up the infamous MET steps in your fancy outfits, together\u2026 In front of all those other people. Great. \u00a0</p><p>Nervousness has creeped it\u2019s way back into your mind as you sit in the back of the car with H; your knee involuntarily bouncing up and down as you watch the streets of Manhattan whiz by you outside.\u00a0</p><p>Harry observes this, and bites down on his bottom lip unsurely.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d He asks; breaking the silence and causing you to snap your gaze to him.\u00a0\u201cY-You look absolutely breathtaking, love. Just like always, but wow.\u201d</p><p>You smile shyly as you feel the blush beginning to cover your face, and tuck a stray piece of hair behind you ear.\u00a0\u201cThanks, H. You do as well.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond as he gently grabs ahold of your hand, and starts stroking the back of it with his thumb.\u00a0\u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d He questions after a moment, and you let out a breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you tell him with an unconvincing nod.\u00a0\u201cI mean, yes I want to be here for you\u2026 But I don\u2019t necessarily want to <i>be</i> here, you know? Would much rather be at home with you rather than at this major event, but I\u2019ll be ok. I have you there with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he replies, and leans in to meet your lips in a tender kiss. Neither of you break away, until you feel the car beginning to come to a stop, and know it\u2019s time to get this show on the road. Harry moves away slightly, and softly puts his hand under your chin so you\u2019ll meet his gaze.\u00a0\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d you state with a small smile.\u00a0\u201cSo much. Now go knock \u2018em dead.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He feels as if his heart is swelling out of his chest at your words, and leans in to place one last kiss to your cheek. The goofy grin he has on his mouth as he pulls away to climb out of the door that\u2019s just been open for him doesn\u2019t fade, and is the first thing the cameras capture when he steps foot onto the red carpet. He waves at the photographers, and his smile widens as he turns around to help you out of the car; subtly making sure the small boxed item he placed into his pocket remains there for when he plans on using it later, once he\u2019s alone with you again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d He asks as the car door gets shut behind the two of you, and you nod. One last soft peck is placed to your temple before the two of you start walking along the red carpet, making sure to pose for some pictures as you go. Both of you come to a stop at the base of the steps in front of the last group of photographers, and that\u2019s when you become tense again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, is it true you\u2019re only using Harry for his money?\u201d One of the reporters ask, and you physically stiffen. You can feel the panic raising in your chest, as Harry snakes his arm protectively around your waist, and scowls in the direction of the person.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you not start with this, please?\u201d Your boyfriend asks politely, but it doesn\u2019t stop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about that dress?\u201d Another reporter speaks up.\u00a0\u201cAs someone who has just finished university, that must\u2019ve cost quite a bit of money. Did Harry buy it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell uh, yes,\u201d you stammer, and try to blink back tears as this statement sends them into frenzy almost.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you <i>do</i> use him for his money,\u201d the first reporter states as she writes something down in her notebook.\u00a0\u201cWhat about you seeing him on tour, there\u2019s no way you paid for all those trips with your simple paying job. It was Harry wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with anything?\u201d Harry snaps, and you flinch slightly at his tone.\u00a0\u201cYou know nothing about our relationship, or just how hard Y/N works her ass off for everything she does. So what if I bought her a nice dress to wear tonight? She\u2019s my girlfriend and I\u2019m allowed to do things like that. Also, not that it\u2019s any of your business, but she wouldn\u2019t allow me to pay for those plane tickets to come visit me while on tour. Now please, back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if it isn\u2019t the money, she must be in it for the fame,\u201d someone else yells, and that\u2019s when a tear finally breaks free.\u00a0</p><p>You glance up at Harry, and can see his face visibly reddening.\u00a0\u201cHarry,\u201d you start softly, but it\u2019s no use as he continues glaring daggers at the paparazzi, while they continue taking jabs at you. With a gentle tug on his sleeve, he finally glances down at you, and his hard gaze instantly softens.\u00a0\u201cCan we go,\u00a0<i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>He nods in agreement to your pleas, and leads you away from the crowd of people still calling after the two of you. Without looking back, you both weave through the other celebrities attending the event, and you try not to make eye contact with some of their judgemental gazes.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the two of you are through the doors, you let go of Harry\u2019s hand and try to catch your breath. The panicky feeling you have doesn\u2019t subside, and the sight of you on the verge of hyperventilation crushes his heart.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d He asks softly, and reaches out to touch your arm; but you quickly move away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t do this anymore H,\u201d you tell him breathlessly as the tears continue streaming down your face; trying to take control of the panic attack you are having.\u00a0\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>You start to walk away, but he quickly runs around to be in front of you.\u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t do this anymore?\u201d He questions; the fear and worry of what\u2019s to come evident in his green orbs.\u00a0\u201cY/N, n-no. I know what they were saying out there was awful, and\u00a0I\u2019m sorry they were just so <i>mean</i> to you\u2026 But you\u2019ll be ok, right? We\u2019ll be ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll <i>pretend</i> to be ok\u2026 Just like I always do,\u201d you reply, and choke back a sob. The hurt and confusion that flashes in his eyes indicates that he truly doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you, so you decide it\u2019s time to let him know.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m tired, H. I\u2019m tired, and\u00a0I\u2019m hurt because it seems that whatever I do; it can never be enough. I\u2019ve tried so hard to not let any of those things people say get to me, but it\u2019s really hard when I have this constant thought nagging at me; telling me I\u2019m worthless, and never truly will be enough for someone as amazing as you. And that\u2019s ok. As much as it kills me to say, you will still succeed without me. You don\u2019t <i>need</i> me Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N you don\u2019t know what I need,\u201d he argues, and grabs ahold of your hand desperately.\u00a0\u201cBecause if you did, you\u2019d know the only thing I do need is you. I don\u2019t care about all of this. Sure it\u2019s nice, but I don\u2019t want any of it if you\u2019re not there to experience it with me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t see as he reaches into his pocket, and clutches the little box that resides there; rubbing his thumb over it\u2019s smooth felt material, as you start going off again.\u00a0\u201cDo you even hear yourself right now?\u201d You ask incredulously.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard for all of this, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you throw it away\u2026 So I\u2019m just going to go. I won\u2019t be back at the apartment when you return, don\u2019t worry if I leave things; I\u2019ll deal with them when I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so you\u2019re leaving me?\u201d He questions unsurely, as the tears are evidently welled up in his eyes at this point as well.\u00a0\u201cBabe, please don\u2019t say stuff like that. Y-You\u2019re my whole world, I-I really do need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I need a break,\u201d you explain, voice cracking as you do so.\u00a0\u201cThese last four years with you have been the best of my life, but they\u2019ve also been the most stressful Harry. I can\u2019t keep putting myself through constant worry and fear that I will never be worthy of being your girlfriend, let alone even knowing you. I know you\u2019re going to argue this, but please don\u2019t. I truly think I need a break, from everything really. I need time to find myself again, and not think about what the world is constantly saying about me; especially when it comes to my relationship with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t the end, right?\u201d He asks desperately; ignoring the stares the two of you have earned from other event goers.\u00a0\u201cY/N, I don\u2019t know what you expect me to do after just telling me you want to break up out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you to keep going,\u201d you tell him softly.\u00a0\u201cGo on without me, Harry. Co-host this major event, keep amazing your fans with your incredible talent, keep\u2026 being you. You were this incredible person long before I came along, and will be after as well; it\u2019s what made me fall in love with you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it. You\u2019ve fallen out of love with me,\u201d he states monotonously. \u00a0\u201cI wish you would\u2019ve told me before it got this bad, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all,\u201d you reason with him, and gently cup his cheek with your hand.\u00a0\u201cI could never fall out of love with you, but\u00a0I\u2019ve fallen out of love with myself. My mind has been a dark place recently, and I really need to try and change that. Which is also why I didn\u2019t say anything. I need to deal with this,\u00a0alone.\u201d He glances away from you sadly; hurt by how he truly cannot help you in this situation, and that thought itself slowly kills him. You glance behind him at the people getting ready to start the event, and decide it\u2019s time that you go; but not without one final kiss.\u00a0\u201cI love you, H. With all my heart.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else once your lips part from his, but wants nothing more than to savour the feeling of you here with him. You send him one last sad smile before wiping away some tears, and heading towards a separate exit so a security guard can escort you out.\u00a0</p><p>A couple minutes pass, and he still stands there shell-shocked until Jeff comes up to shake him out of it. He doesn\u2019t register anything his manager and close friend says as he pulls the small box out of his pocket, and flips it open; revealing a stunning diamond engagement ring inside of it that he\u2019s had purchased for months now, with the word\u00a0\u2018forever\u2019 engraved on the inside of the shiny gold band.\u00a0\u201cShe left,\u201d he whispers defeatedly to himself, but Jeff is quick picking up on what he\u2019s getting at as his friends tear filled eyes meets his own.\u00a0\u201cShe left me, and I didn\u2019t even get the chance to ask her\u2026 I was too late.\u201d</p></p>",

(I&rsquo;m so sorry for the ending *hides*. There may be a part 2 to this, haven&rsquo;t decided yet) - also there&rsquo;s hints at Y/N having anxiety and even a bit of depression in this so if that makes you&nbsp;uncomfortable I am not&nbsp;offended if you decide to skip reading this. As someone who suffers from&nbsp;both sometimes, I&nbsp;totally&nbsp;understand. If you are someone who relates in that aspect keep your heads up loves, make the world your bitch, and own it;&nbsp;I&nbsp;know how hard that can be to do sometimes but you GOT this&nbsp;Travis. Please&nbsp;don&rsquo;t doubt how awesome you truly are. Ok this is long, I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; But as a final note, if any of you and&nbsp;I mean ANY of you ever just need a friendly&nbsp;message or words of&nbsp;encouragement please do not hesitate to send me a message, my ask is always open, and I&rsquo;m always down for a chat. Ok, shut up Ken&hellip;&nbsp;</i></p><p>Four years is a long time, right? Over 1460 days most definitely gives you enough time to get to know a person on different levels of intimacy, seeing as they&rsquo;ve been such a constant thing in your life for so long&hellip; It&rsquo;s a good amount of time to develop a strong relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>However, relationships are hard. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are, who you&rsquo;re with, or how you go about it; thinking relationships are an easy aspect of life is just unrealistic. And as much as you hate it, this is a thought that has inevitably made it&rsquo;s way into your mind a lot recently when thinking about your relationship with Harry.&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;d think some big thing like a fight would&rsquo;ve had to happen in order to bring on thoughts that make you question everything you have with him, but no, it didn&rsquo;t, and oh do you wish it could&rsquo;ve been that simple.&nbsp;</p><p>A soft sigh escapes your mouth as you glance down at the curly haired boy who&rsquo;s gently nuzzled against your chest; tiredly watching a Friends rerun on the television in the large master bedroom of his New York City home. He doesn&rsquo;t notice your gaze as he let&rsquo;s out a yawn, and you continue gently massaging his head with your fingertips; watching as his eyes get droopier by the minute.&nbsp;</p><p>Things are peaceful. You struggle to remember the last time the two of you shared a carefree night in like this, and although you appreciate the fact that you are able to spend an evening with your loving boyfriend; you can&rsquo;t help but think about how these nights are few and far between. Is this his fault? Absolutely not, and that&rsquo;s why you feel the need to keep your worrisome thoughts to yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;ve been finding yourself doing this a lot lately, and hadn&rsquo;t been too sure as to why; but recently it&rsquo;s been one thing after another that has just about pushed you to your boiling point&hellip; And sadly Harry has no knowledge of any of it.&nbsp;</p><p>As confusing as it sounds; he has nothing, and everything to do with how you&rsquo;re feeling. It&rsquo;s not his fault he&rsquo;s away all the time. It&rsquo;s part of his job, and you&rsquo;ve fully accepted this after years of being with someone who constantly has a light shone on them; however, it&rsquo;s also this same light that can make him blind to what&rsquo;s really going on with you, and that&rsquo;s the hardest part.&nbsp;</p><p>Your love for Harry is unconditional, and there&rsquo;s not a part of you that doesn&rsquo;t think he feels the same; but with being away from each other for so long, and so often all on top of everything else&hellip; It sometimes just gets to be too much when certain thoughts plague your mind, and you&rsquo;re left alone to suffer from the diseased ideas they bring.&nbsp;</p><p>Saying things have been rough for you lately is an understatement, and you&rsquo;re even more frustrated with how you aren&rsquo;t able to even express why you&rsquo;re feeling this way; but all you do know is that you want it to stop. However, when those tiny things just keep building up, the thought of those feelings diminishing seem to be just a mere dream you hope to come true&hellip; Yet it doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it be the comments fans have said about you, or even just your general feeling of not being <i>enough</i> for Harry; you&rsquo;ve come to the point where you don&rsquo;t know how much more you can take, and that scares the hell out of you.&nbsp;</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t made for this life in the spotlight. You never wanted any part of it, but you did it for Harry, and he&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s been worth it&hellip; but fuck. Is that worth the price of loosing yourself along the way? The determination you have to be the perfect girlfriend has become exhausting, which is why you&rsquo;ve been considering taking a break to step back and rethink it all; but how does one do that when the other half of the relationship knows nothing about these thoughts and fears you have?</p><p>Your love for this man cuddled against your side has always been enough for you, but the feeling of you not being enough for him is a whole other thing that continuously eats away at you. Naturally, you find yourself thinking of this once again until a deep groggy voice snaps you out of your insinuating thoughts; breaking your silent suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; You ask, and shake your head before glancing down at your boyfriend; pushing his curls back from his face as he looks up at you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Was saying how you look deep in thought,&rdquo; he replies, and starts sitting up from his position.&nbsp;&ldquo;Something on your mind, petal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N-no, nothing,&rdquo; you stammer, and his green irises look at you with concern; his eyebrows furrowing in disbelief. &ldquo;No really H, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; he starts, but you cut him off by placing your lips to his in a soft, delicate kiss; leaning your forehead against his once the kiss is done, and hoping he doesn&rsquo;t keep digging. After a couple moments of you two staring at each other he finally lets out a breath, and glances away from your eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I-I, m&rsquo;not sure if I believe you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean you don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo; You scoff, getting slightly defensive.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I just,&rdquo; he begins, and starts gently tracing his finger against the exposed skin of your hip affectionately.&nbsp;&ldquo;I dunno, you just got into New York today, and kind of have been distant. Is there something bugging you? Any thing I can help with? You know you can talk to me about things, right love? Doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; you tell him honestly, because it is true - you know you can tell him anything, but you don&rsquo;t have it in you to burden him with your problems and doubts; especially with tomorrow being so extremely important&hellip; So you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok H, I&rsquo;m just tired. Let&rsquo;s get some rest, you&rsquo;ve got a big day coming up.&rdquo;</p><p>You can see in his eyes how badly he wants to keep pushing you to open up, but that&rsquo;s just it; he doesn&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to push you, he just deeply wants you to know he&rsquo;s here for you even though you&rsquo;re struggling in realizing that fact. So he drops it, and decides getting a good nights sleep may be beneficial.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; he sighs in defeat.&nbsp;&ldquo;One more episode of Friends, and then I&rsquo;ll go to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>Once Harry falls asleep cuddled up beside you, you lay awake; allowing your overthinking mind to take over again, and keeping you up into late hours of the night.&nbsp;</p><p>The next morning is rough, seeing as you have no desire to get out of bed and contribute to society in the slightest, and Harry easily picks up on it. However, just as he comes out of the washroom&nbsp;with the towel wrapped loosely around his waist; he finds himself peppered with kisses from you, out of bed, and ready to start the day.&nbsp;</p><p>Confused is an understatement of what he&rsquo;s feeling, but he also understands. He&rsquo;s known for a while now that you get times where anxiety and depression take so much control over you, and it breaks his heart seeing it affect you without knowing if he can do anything to help ease it for you&hellip;. So he lets you be, and hopes that maybe what he has planned for tonight can lighten your spirits a little bit.&nbsp;</p><p>The two of you have a simple morning, that leads to some morning sex, which leads to Harry having to take another shower with you before actually getting ready. Your mood has shifted completely, which you couldn&rsquo;t be more glad about because you really want to be there for your boyfriend on such an special night; despite the nagging thoughts that still lurk in the back of your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>As many people know by now, Harry is co-hosting this years Met Gala&hellip; And it&rsquo;s a really big deal. Sure, he didn&rsquo;t act like it was when he told you about it, or when he asked you to be his date there; but you knew deep down how excited he was for this night.&nbsp;</p><p>When the time comes, you both prepare to leave the apartment and head to the event; so you can walk up the infamous MET steps in your fancy outfits, together&hellip; In front of all those other people. Great. &nbsp;</p><p>Nervousness has creeped it&rsquo;s way back into your mind as you sit in the back of the car with H; your knee involuntarily bouncing up and down as you watch the streets of Manhattan whiz by you outside.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry observes this, and bites down on his bottom lip unsurely.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; He asks; breaking the silence and causing you to snap your gaze to him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y-You look absolutely breathtaking, love. Just like always, but wow.&rdquo;</p><p>You smile shyly as you feel the blush beginning to cover your face, and tuck a stray piece of hair behind you ear.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks, H. You do as well.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t respond as he gently grabs ahold of your hand, and starts stroking the back of it with his thumb.&nbsp;&ldquo;You sure you want to do this?&rdquo; He questions after a moment, and you let out a breath.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you tell him with an unconvincing nod.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, yes I want to be here for you&hellip; But I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to <i>be</i> here, you know? Would much rather be at home with you rather than at this major event, but I&rsquo;ll be ok. I have you there with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he replies, and leans in to meet your lips in a tender kiss. Neither of you break away, until you feel the car beginning to come to a stop, and know it&rsquo;s time to get this show on the road. Harry moves away slightly, and softly puts his hand under your chin so you&rsquo;ll meet his gaze.&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I love you,&rdquo; you state with a small smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;So much. Now go knock &lsquo;em dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He feels as if his heart is swelling out of his chest at your words, and leans in to place one last kiss to your cheek. The goofy grin he has on his mouth as he pulls away to climb out of the door that&rsquo;s just been open for him doesn&rsquo;t fade, and is the first thing the cameras capture when he steps foot onto the red carpet. He waves at the photographers, and his smile widens as he turns around to help you out of the car; subtly making sure the small boxed item he placed into his pocket remains there for when he plans on using it later, once he&rsquo;s alone with you again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; He asks as the car door gets shut behind the two of you, and you nod. One last soft peck is placed to your temple before the two of you start walking along the red carpet, making sure to pose for some pictures as you go. Both of you come to a stop at the base of the steps in front of the last group of photographers, and that&rsquo;s when you become tense again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, is it true you&rsquo;re only using Harry for his money?&rdquo; One of the reporters ask, and you physically stiffen. You can feel the panic raising in your chest, as Harry snakes his arm protectively around your waist, and scowls in the direction of the person.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you not start with this, please?&rdquo; Your boyfriend asks politely, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What about that dress?&rdquo; Another reporter speaks up.&nbsp;&ldquo;As someone who has just finished university, that must&rsquo;ve cost quite a bit of money. Did Harry buy it for you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well uh, yes,&rdquo; you stammer, and try to blink back tears as this statement sends them into frenzy almost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So you <i>do</i> use him for his money,&rdquo; the first reporter states as she writes something down in her notebook.&nbsp;&ldquo;What about you seeing him on tour, there&rsquo;s no way you paid for all those trips with your simple paying job. It was Harry wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does this have to do with anything?&rdquo; Harry snaps, and you flinch slightly at his tone.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know nothing about our relationship, or just how hard Y/N works her ass off for everything she does. So what if I bought her a nice dress to wear tonight? She&rsquo;s my girlfriend and I&rsquo;m allowed to do things like that. Also, not that it&rsquo;s any of your business, but she wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to pay for those plane tickets to come visit me while on tour. Now please, back off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So if it isn&rsquo;t the money, she must be in it for the fame,&rdquo; someone else yells, and that&rsquo;s when a tear finally breaks free.&nbsp;</p><p>You glance up at Harry, and can see his face visibly reddening.&nbsp;&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; you start softly, but it&rsquo;s no use as he continues glaring daggers at the paparazzi, while they continue taking jabs at you. With a gentle tug on his sleeve, he finally glances down at you, and his hard gaze instantly softens.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can we go,&nbsp;<i>please</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>He nods in agreement to your pleas, and leads you away from the crowd of people still calling after the two of you. Without looking back, you both weave through the other celebrities attending the event, and you try not to make eye contact with some of their judgemental gazes.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as the two of you are through the doors, you let go of Harry&rsquo;s hand and try to catch your breath. The panicky feeling you have doesn&rsquo;t subside, and the sight of you on the verge of hyperventilation crushes his heart.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; He asks softly, and reaches out to touch your arm; but you quickly move away.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t do this anymore H,&rdquo; you tell him breathlessly as the tears continue streaming down your face; trying to take control of the panic attack you are having.&nbsp;&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>You start to walk away, but he quickly runs around to be in front of you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do this anymore?&rdquo; He questions; the fear and worry of what&rsquo;s to come evident in his green orbs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N, n-no. I know what they were saying out there was awful, and&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry they were just so <i>mean</i> to you&hellip; But you&rsquo;ll be ok, right?

I won&rsquo;t be back at the apartment when you return, don&rsquo;t worry if I leave things; I&rsquo;ll deal with them when I have to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, so you&rsquo;re leaving me?&rdquo; He questions unsurely, as the tears are evidently welled up in his eyes at this point as well.&nbsp;&ldquo;Babe, please don&rsquo;t say stuff like that.
