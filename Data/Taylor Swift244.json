        "body": "<p>Gigi opened her mouth to say something but no sound came out. Taylor kept staring at her and she could feel herself getting warmer on the face which meant she was getting progressively redder. It took a lot of determination from her part not to bury her head in one of the couch\u2019s pillows.<br/>\n\u201cYou slept with him\u2026\u201d Gigi finally said, \u201cas in, you two fell asleep on the couch together or something?\u201d She asked very slowly, looking incredibly confused and unsure.<br/>\nTaylor looked at her incredulously and said \u201cNo Gigi, I slept with him as in we fucked on the living room floor.\u201d<br/>\nThey stared at each other for a few seconds, Taylor looking annoyed and Gigi looking the definition of speechless, until all of a sudden Gigi started laughing.<br/>\n\u201cOh my God, what the hell, this is a serious matter!\u201d Taylor exclaimed.<br/>\n\u201cOh God, I\u2019m sorry\u201d Gigi started in between laughter, \u201cbut I really wasn\u2019t expecting you to say that\u201d she said as she continued laughing.<br/>\n\u201cWill you stop?\u201d Taylor asked her, still annoyed.<br/>\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m okay\u201d Gigi told her while trying to calm her breathing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to laugh, I just really wasn\u2019t expecting it. I was kind of shocked. I\u2019m fine now. Oh God.\u201d Gigi took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, so, if I got this straight, you were just going to be friends but got drunk one night and had sex. Drunk sex. And now you\u2019re worried it might get awkward?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cOh God\u201d Taylor groaned. \u201cNot exactly\u2026\u201d<br/>\n\u201cTaylor\u201d Gigi said, trying really hard not to roll her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help, I really am, so will you please just tell me what it is that I still don\u2019t know?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just, I\u2019m so confused\u2026\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI can see that, trust me. Just tell me the rest.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cOkay\u2026 So, we slept together that night, right? And when I woke up the next morning I really thought it was going to be awkward, especially because we were a bit tipsy, but it wasn\u2019t. It was so\u2026 normal? I guess. And we said \u2018okay, this happened, we can still be friends, we\u2019re not letting it ruin everything\u2019 and we went on as usual\u201d she paused her ramble and Gigi tilted her head at her so she would continue, \u201cuntil it happened again. And we definitely weren\u2019t drunk the second time.\u201d<br/>\nGigi\u2019s eyes went wide, \u201cOhhh my God\u2026 so you-\u201c<br/>\n\u201cNo wait, just let me finish it\u201d Taylor interrupted. \u201cIt happened a third time, and then a fourth, and we decided why not have a bit of fun, you know, and so we said we\u2019d still be friends and if it happened that we had sex because we both wanted to, then, well, it did. But now I really like him, and I don\u2019t know how to tell him without messing it all up because we basically said we\u2019d only have casual sexy while being friends\u201d she finished and took a deep breath. She kind of forgot to breathe for a second there.<br/>\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Gigi said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll find a solution, yeah? It\u2019ll be okay. Come here\u201d she asked as she opened her arms.<br/>\nTaylor mover into Gigi\u2019s direction not having to worry about Olivia, who had moved from her lap a couple of minutes ago.<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so stressed about this, Gi\u201d Taylor said into her her friends\u2019s neck while they hugged.<br/>\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier? I would have tried to help you.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really tell anyone\u2026 it felt so good having someone just mine, you know. With no outside pressure.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWell, now I know and we\u2019ll figure something out, okay?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYeah\u2026 thanks Gi.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to thank me\u201d she said as she pulled back from the hug to look at Taylor. \u201cI want you to tell me everything about him. He was really nice when I met him, a perfect gentleman, great jokes, great hair.\u201d<br/>\nTaylor started laughing, \u201cHe really does have great hair, doesn\u2019t he? It\u2019s so soft.\u201d<br/>\nGigi smirked at her, \u201cWell I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s soft or not, only that it looked really good.\u201d<br/>\nTaylor bit her lip, \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d and she couldn\u2019t help it, she actually giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s really silky\u2026\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI bet\u201d her friend laughed. \u201cSo, he plays scrabble?\u201d Gigi asked her, wanting to hear more about the guy who had one of her best friends giggling like a school girl. She could feel Taylor\u2019s stress about the situation so she thought she probably needed to focus on the good things for a minute. Also she definitely needed some info to start planning her argument on this new subject. Gigi smirked.<br/>\n\u201cOh my God, yes!\u201d Gigi focused on Taylor again. If there was something that got this girl excited was scrabble. And cats, of course. \u201cHe knows all these uncommon words people I usually play with don\u2019t, and he\u2019s good with strategy too. Did you know he studied literature in college? Or uni, like he calls it. Like, we literally have conversations for hours, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Taylor, you deserve this.\u201d Gigi told her, smiling softly. \u201cSo\u201d she continued, a smirk growing on her face, \u201care you going to spill, or what?\u201d<br/>\nTaylor stared at her. \u201cOn what?\u201d\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cOn the sex, Taylor\u201d Gigi answered excitedly.<br/>\nTaylor groaned, starting to blush again. She was blushing an awful lot for just one afternoon. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about that, no way.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cAw, come on, baby, nothing too explicit.\u201d Gigi teased.<br/>\n\u201cPlease\u201d Taylor started, not look looking her friend in the eye. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t call me that\u2026\u201d<br/>\nThe other girl looked startled for a second but then smirked again. \u201cAw, does Joe call you \u2018baaaby\u2019\u201d she teased, prolonging the word.<br/>\n\u201cShut up, please.\u201d Taylor asked, cringing a bit. Just a bit.<br/>\n\u201cFine, just tell me if the sex\u2019s good and we\u2019ll talk about something else.\u201d<br/>\nTaylor didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds and then just started talking really fast. \u201cThe sex is really good, like, ridiculously good, amazing really, okay, do you want to go bake some cookies?\u201d<br/>\nGigi had started laughing but had to get up because Taylor was already going to the kitchen, still she managed to say \u201cGood for you, baby. Oh, wait, I can\u2019t call you that anymore\u201d she kept laughing as Taylor shot her a dirty look over the shoulder.<br/>\nA couple of hours later, they had chocolate chip cookies baking in the oven and were putting away the dishes from an early dinner because Gigi had to get up early the next day for a photo shoot.<br/>\n\u201cSo, I have to go to bed early tonight but what are you going to do?\u201d She asked Taylor.<br/>\n\u201cNothing much, really\u201d Taylor answered while wiping the counter, \u201cI\u2019ll probably binge some \u2018Friends\u2019 or something\u2026\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWell, you do have all these cookies to eat.\u201d\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cNo way, you\u2019re taking half of them with you.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWhat will I do with half of all of those?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWhat will I do with all of them?

Taylor kept staring at her and she could feel herself getting warmer on the face which meant she was getting progressively redder. It took a lot of determination from her part not to bury her head in one of the couch\u2019s pillows.<br>\n\u201cYou slept with him\u2026\u201d Gigi finally said, \u201cas in, you two fell asleep on the couch together or something?\u201d She asked very slowly, looking incredibly confused and unsure.<br>\nTaylor looked at her incredulously and said \u201cNo Gigi, I slept with him as in we fucked on the living room floor.\u201d<br>\nThey stared at each other for a few seconds, Taylor looking annoyed and Gigi looking the definition of speechless, until all of a sudden Gigi started laughing.<br>\n\u201cOh my God, what the hell, this is a serious matter!\u201d Taylor exclaimed.<br>\n\u201cOh God, I\u2019m sorry\u201d Gigi started in between laughter, \u201cbut I really wasn\u2019t expecting you to say that\u201d she said as she continued laughing.<br>\n\u201cWill you stop?\u201d Taylor asked her, still annoyed.<br>\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m okay\u201d Gigi told her while trying to calm her breathing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to laugh, I just really wasn\u2019t expecting it. I was kind of shocked. I\u2019m fine now. Oh God.\u201d Gigi took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, so, if I got this straight, you were just going to be friends but got drunk one night and had sex. Drunk sex. And now you\u2019re worried it might get awkward?\u201d<br>\n\u201cOh God\u201d Taylor groaned. \u201cNot exactly\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cTaylor\u201d Gigi said, trying really hard not to roll her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help, I really am, so will you please just tell me what it is that I still don\u2019t know?\u201d<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just, I\u2019m so confused\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cI can see that, trust me. Just tell me the rest.\u201d<br>\n\u201cOkay\u2026 So, we slept together that night, right? And when I woke up the next morning I really thought it was going to be awkward, especially because we were a bit tipsy, but it wasn\u2019t. It was so\u2026 normal? I guess. And we said \u2018okay, this happened, we can still be friends, we\u2019re not letting it ruin everything\u2019 and we went on as usual\u201d she paused her ramble and Gigi tilted her head at her so she would continue, \u201cuntil it happened again. And we definitely weren\u2019t drunk the second time.\u201d<br>\nGigi\u2019s eyes went wide, \u201cOhhh my God\u2026 so you-\u201c<br>\n\u201cNo wait, just let me finish it\u201d Taylor interrupted. \u201cIt happened a third time, and then a fourth, and we decided why not have a bit of fun, you know, and so we said we\u2019d still be friends and if it happened that we had sex because we both wanted to, then, well, it did. But now I really like him, and I don\u2019t know how to tell him without messing it all up because we basically said we\u2019d only have casual sexy while being friends\u201d she finished and took a deep breath. She kind of forgot to breathe for a second there.<br>\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Gigi said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll find a solution, yeah? It\u2019ll be okay. Come here\u201d she asked as she opened her arms.<br>\nTaylor mover into Gigi\u2019s direction not having to worry about Olivia, who had moved from her lap a couple of minutes ago.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so stressed about this, Gi\u201d Taylor said into her her friends\u2019s neck while they hugged.<br>\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier? I would have tried to help you.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really tell anyone\u2026 it felt so good having someone just mine, you know. With no outside pressure.\u201d<br>\n\u201cWell, now I know and we\u2019ll figure something out, okay?\u201d<br>\n\u201cYeah\u2026 thanks Gi.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to thank me\u201d she said as she pulled back from the hug to look at Taylor. \u201cI want you to tell me everything about him. He was really nice when I met him, a perfect gentleman, great jokes, great hair.\u201d<br>\nTaylor started laughing, \u201cHe really does have great hair, doesn\u2019t he? It\u2019s so soft.\u201d<br>\nGigi smirked at her, \u201cWell I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s soft or not, only that it looked really good.\u201d<br>\nTaylor bit her lip, \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d and she couldn\u2019t help it, she actually giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s really silky\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cI bet\u201d her friend laughed. \u201cSo, he plays scrabble?\u201d Gigi asked her, wanting to hear more about the guy who had one of her best friends giggling like a school girl. She could feel Taylor\u2019s stress about the situation so she thought she probably needed to focus on the good things for a minute. Also she definitely needed some info to start planning her argument on this new subject. Gigi smirked.<br>\n\u201cOh my God, yes!\u201d Gigi focused on Taylor again. If there was something that got this girl excited was scrabble. And cats, of course. \u201cHe knows all these uncommon words people I usually play with don\u2019t, and he\u2019s good with strategy too. Did you know he studied literature in college? Or uni, like he calls it. Like, we literally have conversations for hours, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Taylor, you deserve this.\u201d Gigi told her, smiling softly. \u201cSo\u201d she continued, a smirk growing on her face, \u201care you going to spill, or what?\u201d<br>\nTaylor stared at her. \u201cOn what?\u201d\u00a0<br>\n\u201cOn the sex, Taylor\u201d Gigi answered excitedly.<br>\nTaylor groaned, starting to blush again. She was blushing an awful lot for just one afternoon. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about that, no way.\u201d<br>\n\u201cAw, come on, baby, nothing too explicit.\u201d Gigi teased.<br>\n\u201cPlease\u201d Taylor started, not look looking her friend in the eye. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t call me that\u2026\u201d<br>\nThe other girl looked startled for a second but then smirked again. \u201cAw, does Joe call you \u2018baaaby\u2019\u201d she teased, prolonging the word.<br>\n\u201cShut up, please.\u201d Taylor asked, cringing a bit. Just a bit.<br>\n\u201cFine, just tell me if the sex\u2019s good and we\u2019ll talk about something else.\u201d<br>\nTaylor didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds and then just started talking really fast. \u201cThe sex is really good, like, ridiculously good, amazing really, okay, do you want to go bake some cookies?\u201d<br>\nGigi had started laughing but had to get up because Taylor was already going to the kitchen, still she managed to say \u201cGood for you, baby.

And cats, of course. \u201cHe knows all these uncommon words people I usually play with don\u2019t, and he\u2019s good with strategy too. Did you know he studied literature in college? Or uni, like he calls it. Like, we literally have conversations for hours, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Taylor, you deserve this.\u201d Gigi told her, smiling softly. \u201cSo\u201d she continued, a smirk growing on her face, \u201care you going to spill, or what?\u201d<br>\nTaylor stared at her. \u201cOn what?\u201d\u00a0<br>\n\u201cOn the sex, Taylor\u201d Gigi answered excitedly.<br>\nTaylor groaned, starting to blush again. She was blushing an awful lot for just one afternoon. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about that, no way.\u201d<br>\n\u201cAw, come on, baby, nothing too explicit.\u201d Gigi teased.<br>\n\u201cPlease\u201d Taylor started, not look looking her friend in the eye. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t call me that\u2026\u201d<br>\nThe other girl looked startled for a second but then smirked again. \u201cAw, does Joe call you \u2018baaaby\u2019\u201d she teased, prolonging the word.<br>\n\u201cShut up, please.\u201d Taylor asked, cringing a bit. Just a bit.<br>\n\u201cFine, just tell me if the sex\u2019s good and we\u2019ll talk about something else.\u201d<br>\nTaylor didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds and then just started talking really fast. \u201cThe sex is really good, like, ridiculously good, amazing really, okay, do you want to go bake some cookies?\u201d<br>\nGigi had started laughing but had to get up because Taylor was already going to the kitchen, still she managed to say \u201cGood for you, baby. Oh, wait, I can\u2019t call you that anymore\u201d she kept laughing as Taylor shot her a dirty look over the shoulder.<br>\nA couple of hours later, they had chocolate chip cookies baking in the oven and were putting away the dishes from an early dinner because Gigi had to get up early the next day for a photo shoot.<br>\n\u201cSo, I have to go to bed early tonight but what are you going to do?\u201d She asked Taylor.<br>\n\u201cNothing much, really\u201d Taylor answered while wiping the counter, \u201cI\u2019ll probably binge some \u2018Friends\u2019 or something\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cWell, you do have all these cookies to eat.\u201d\u00a0<br>\n\u201cNo way, you\u2019re taking half of them with you.\u201d<br>\n\u201cWhat will I do with half of all of those?\u201d<br>\n\u201cWhat will I do with all of them? You\u2019re taking half.\u201d<br>\n\u201cBut you might have guests\u201d Gigi smirked at the other girl. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to feed your guests.\u201d<br>\nTaylor narrowed her eyes at her. \u201cI\u2019m not having guests, you\u2019re taking half the cookies with you and this conversation is over.\u201d<br>\n\u201cTouchy\u201d her friend murmured, but Taylor pretended not to listen. \u201cI think these are ready, Taylor\u201d she said louder.<br>\nTaylor looked over at the oven. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll put them in a container for you, be careful with it because they\u2019re hot.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYes, mom.\u201d<br>\nTaylor rolled her eyes as she started putting the cookies in a plastic container and then in a bag.<br>\n\u201cThere you go, have fun tomorrow.\u201d<br>\n\u201cThank you, have fun binging \u2018Friends\u2019. Talk to you tomorrow?\u201d Gigi asked as they hugged.<br>\n\u201cYeah, goodnight.\u201d<br>\n\u201cNight, Taylor.\u201d<br>\nTaylor closed the door and noticed Meredith chilling on the carpet. \u201cShall we go to bed too?\u201d She asked as she bent down to pick up the cat. \u201cLet\u2019s take some cookies up and watch \u2018Friends\u2019. I\u2019ll bring some treats for you and Olivia too\u201d she told Meredith as she went back to the kitchen. She put the cat down and grabbed a plate with some cookies, grabbed a bag of cat treats and a bottle of water.<br>\n\u201cCome on, Mere. Where\u2019s Dibbles, hm? Is she upstairs already?\u201d She asked the cat as she left the kitchen.<br>\nAnd Olivia was, indeed, upstairs, having a nap in the middle of Taylor\u2019s bed. \u201cSometimes I wonder how the two of you can sleep so much\u2026 it\u2019s not like you have reasons to be tired, you literally do nothing all day.\u201d Taylor said out loud while putting the things she had brought upstairs on top of her bedside table.<br>\nAfter changing to a fresh pair of cat pyjamas and turning on the TV, she turned off the lights and lied under the covers while the cats cuddled together on the other pillow.\u00a0<br>\nShe had been watching TV for a while when she heard a buzz. She looked at her bedside table and noticed a new message on her phone\u2019s screen. She picked it up, her heart instantly picking up the pace once she saw who it was from.<br>\n\u2018Hey Taylor :) where you at?\u2019<br>\n-<br>\n(Hi! Like you might have just noticed from that last sentence, this whole thing was first inspired by \u2018Delicate\u2019, but I kind of wanted to add some background context.

                "content": "<p>Gigi opened her mouth to say something but no sound came out. Taylor kept staring at her and she could feel herself getting warmer on the face which meant she was getting progressively redder. It took a lot of determination from her part not to bury her head in one of the couch&rsquo;s pillows.<br />\n&ldquo;You slept with him&hellip;&rdquo; Gigi finally said, &ldquo;as in, you two fell asleep on the couch together or something?&rdquo; She asked very slowly, looking incredibly confused and unsure.<br />\nTaylor looked at her incredulously and said &ldquo;No Gigi, I slept with him as in we fucked on the living room floor.&rdquo;<br />\nThey stared at each other for a few seconds, Taylor looking annoyed and Gigi looking the definition of speechless, until all of a sudden Gigi started laughing.<br />\n&ldquo;Oh my God, what the hell, this is a serious matter!&rdquo; Taylor exclaimed.<br />\n&ldquo;Oh God, I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; Gigi started in between laughter, &ldquo;but I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting you to say that&rdquo; she said as she continued laughing.<br />\n&ldquo;Will you stop?&rdquo; Taylor asked her, still annoyed.<br />\n&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m okay&rdquo; Gigi told her while trying to calm her breathing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to laugh, I just really wasn&rsquo;t expecting it. I was kind of shocked. I&rsquo;m fine now. Oh God.&rdquo; Gigi took a deep breath. &ldquo;Okay, so, if I got this straight, you were just going to be friends but got drunk one night and had sex. Drunk sex. And now you&rsquo;re worried it might get awkward?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Oh God&rdquo; Taylor groaned. &ldquo;Not exactly&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Taylor&rdquo; Gigi said, trying really hard not to roll her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to help, I really am, so will you please just tell me what it is that I still don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;m so confused&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I can see that, trust me. Just tell me the rest.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Okay&hellip; So, we slept together that night, right? And when I woke up the next morning I really thought it was going to be awkward, especially because we were a bit tipsy, but it wasn&rsquo;t. It was so&hellip; normal? I guess. And we said &lsquo;okay, this happened, we can still be friends, we&rsquo;re not letting it ruin everything&rsquo; and we went on as usual&rdquo; she paused her ramble and Gigi tilted her head at her so she would continue, &ldquo;until it happened again. And we definitely weren&rsquo;t drunk the second time.&rdquo;<br />\nGigi&rsquo;s eyes went wide, &ldquo;Ohhh my God&hellip; so you-&ldquo;<br />\n&ldquo;No wait, just let me finish it&rdquo; Taylor interrupted. &ldquo;It happened a third time, and then a fourth, and we decided why not have a bit of fun, you know, and so we said we&rsquo;d still be friends and if it happened that we had sex because we both wanted to, then, well, it did. But now I really like him, and I don&rsquo;t know how to tell him without messing it all up because we basically said we&rsquo;d only have casual sexy while being friends&rdquo; she finished and took a deep breath. She kind of forgot to breathe for a second there.<br />\n&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; Gigi said, &ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;ll find a solution, yeah? It&rsquo;ll be okay. Come here&rdquo; she asked as she opened her arms.<br />\nTaylor mover into Gigi&rsquo;s direction not having to worry about Olivia, who had moved from her lap a couple of minutes ago.<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so stressed about this, Gi&rdquo; Taylor said into her her friends&rsquo;s neck while they hugged.<br />\n&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me earlier? I would have tried to help you.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really tell anyone&hellip; it felt so good having someone just mine, you know. With no outside pressure.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Well, now I know and we&rsquo;ll figure something out, okay?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; thanks Gi.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to thank me&rdquo; she said as she pulled back from the hug to look at Taylor. &ldquo;I want you to tell me everything about him. He was really nice when I met him, a perfect gentleman, great jokes, great hair.&rdquo;<br />\nTaylor started laughing, &ldquo;He really does have great hair, doesn&rsquo;t he? It&rsquo;s so soft.&rdquo;<br />\nGigi smirked at her, &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s soft or not, only that it looked really good.&rdquo;<br />\nTaylor bit her lip, &ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; and she couldn&rsquo;t help it, she actually giggled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really silky&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I bet&rdquo; her friend laughed. &ldquo;So, he plays scrabble?&rdquo; Gigi asked her, wanting to hear more about the guy who had one of her best friends giggling like a school girl. She could feel Taylor&rsquo;s stress about the situation so she thought she probably needed to focus on the good things for a minute. Also she definitely needed some info to start planning her argument on this new subject. Gigi smirked.<br />\n&ldquo;Oh my God, yes!&rdquo; Gigi focused on Taylor again. If there was something that got this girl excited was scrabble. And cats, of course. &ldquo;He knows all these uncommon words people I usually play with don&rsquo;t, and he&rsquo;s good with strategy too. Did you know he studied literature in college?

She was blushing an awful lot for just one afternoon. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not talking about that, no way.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Aw, come on, baby, nothing too explicit.&rdquo; Gigi teased.<br />\n&ldquo;Please&rdquo; Taylor started, not look looking her friend in the eye. &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t call me that&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\nThe other girl looked startled for a second but then smirked again. &ldquo;Aw, does Joe call you &lsquo;baaaby&rsquo;&rdquo; she teased, prolonging the word.<br />\n&ldquo;Shut up, please.&rdquo; Taylor asked, cringing a bit.
