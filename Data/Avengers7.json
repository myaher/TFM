                "content": "<p>I may not have actively shipped Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter together, but I damn well respected both of them as individuals and their potential together. </p><p><br /></p><p><i>Endgame</i> has forever soured their relationship to me. I can&rsquo;t watch <i>The First Avenger</i> again in the same way, nor<i> Winter Soldier</i> or even <i>Civil</i> <i>War</i>. Their relationship now, in my eyes at least, will forever represent abandonment, selfishness and regression. Not because of Peggy, who was unfortunately reduced to a prize and deserved better. But because of Steve Rogers, who, frankly, has become that creepy guy mooning through the window who won&rsquo;t leave a girl alone. </p><p>Also - do we really think that Peggy Carter, amazing woman and badass that she is, once she found out that Steve was from the future (because I mean, he&rsquo;s coming back looking 10 years older) and discovered he left behind a world that needed someone to help them rebuild wouldn&rsquo;t rage over him doing something so irrevocably irresponsible? Steve didn&rsquo;t need to be Captain America to help the world rebuild, he could&rsquo;ve retired and given the shield to Sam. He could&rsquo;ve helped the world in a far different way - with less punching this time. With no fight. He was running support groups. He knows more than anyone what it&rsquo;s like to have your world changed overnight. He could&rsquo;ve helped rehabilitation efforts without holding the mantle of Captain America. </p><p>Peggy Carter would not have condoned his actions nor his attitude. </p>",

Steve isn\u2019t there as captain America, Iron man never happened (because Steve would have made sure Howard raised his son right). So, Rikki fights with the remaining avegers who are still in that timeline, but of course they lose because they needed Tony and Steve to win. </li><li>In that reality they Earth is destroyed, but the tesseract (or a portal) opens up and that timelines Rikki falls from her world into the MCU timeline&hellip; which of course has her grandfather who she thinks is dead&hellip;.

                "content": "<p><h1>FANFICITON IDEA UP FOR ADOPTION </h1><h2>I had this fanfiction idea, but I really dont have the time to write it. So, here&rsquo;s the idea and its up for adoption if anyone wants it&hellip;</h2><ul><li>Starts off by dealing with the consequences of Steve&rsquo;s ending in Endgame - In my little universe, when Steve went back he DID create an alternate reality/timeline and the kids in CAWS aren&rsquo;t his, because ew. </li><li>So, Steve goes back to Peggy and lives his life under the alias of Richard Barnes, so as not to create hysteria by the fact that Captain America is back from the dead and only like a select few people know who he really is. </li><li>Steve does go on missions and he does save Bucky and prevent hydra from infiltrating SHIELD etc. But when alternate Bucky finds out about how Steve left MCU Bucky he can&rsquo;t forgive Steve, and the two fall out. </li><li>Steve and Peggy have kids and grandkids, but only ONE of them has the combination of genes that gives them superhuman powers&hellip; Rikki Barnes (Grandaughter of Peggy Carter and Richard Barnes in the comics). Steve teaches Rikki how to fight. The kids don&rsquo;t know that Steve is from the MCU, they just know him as Richard Barnes who is a secret super soldier (or whatever). </li><li>So, when it gets to around the time frozen Steve is going to be discovered, MCU Steve says bye to Peggy and goes back to the MCU timeline to hand back the shield to Sam&hellip; But he doesn&rsquo;t tell his kids and grandkids because they wouldn&rsquo;t have let him go, and they think he&rsquo;s past away </li><li>But when they go to defrost the Steve in that timeline&hellip; he doesn&rsquo;t wake up. Tony said &lsquo;You can only mess so much with time before it starts to mess with you back&rsquo;. And MCU!Steve being in the wrong timeline for so long basically fucked everything up. </li><li>So when the battle of New York happens in 2012, everything is different. Steve isn&rsquo;t there as captain America, Iron man never happened (because Steve would have made sure Howard raised his son right). So, Rikki fights with the remaining avegers who are still in that timeline, but of course they lose because they needed Tony and Steve to win. </li><li>In that reality they Earth is destroyed, but the tesseract (or a portal) opens up and that timelines Rikki falls from her world into the MCU timeline&hellip; which of course has her grandfather who she thinks is dead&hellip;. Thus she is the &lsquo;girl without a world&rsquo; from the comics.</li></ul><p>Now it goes to the MCU, with Sam and Bucky. </p><ul><li>Sam and Bucky are dealing with there feelings about what Steve has done - Anger at leaving them. Bucky feels worthless (my precious child), Sam is unsure about taking over as Captain America </li><li>Because the government are gross, they dont exonerate Bucky just because he fought for them in Endgame. So they put him in a psychiatric facility, for rehabilitation. </li><li>Plus, the government aren&rsquo;t just gonna be like &lsquo;Oh yeah, Sams the knew Captain America because Steve said so&rsquo;. So they create a new captain America who they see as the &lsquo;ideal&rsquo; soldier, and Sam has to go on the run with the shield so he doesnt get arrested for what happened with the ACCORDS.  </li><li>Sam breaks Bucky out of the psychiatric facility and they go undercover as spies, with the help of Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Sharon Carter (Who will be a badass woman, who is not reduced to be anyone&rsquo;s lover). They go on missions to prove this new Captain America is evil, and also to investigate these portals from the multiverse which have been opening up. </li><li>INSERT BUDDY COP HUMOUR </li><li>Eventually, they are going to run into Rikki Barnes whose gonna be super confused about who they are and where she is. They battle and she recognises Bucky from a photo in Steve&rsquo;s office from her world. And they take her to old!Steve who is out living the quiet life.</li><li>He is forced to tell her about how he left his world because he was so broken. She&rsquo;s really pissed off because technically she shouldn&rsquo;t have ever existed, plus she&rsquo;s really started to become pals with Bucky and can&rsquo;t understand why Steve could leave him. </li><li>Bucky always loved Steve, and Steve loved Bucky - but Steve thought they&rsquo;d be toxic for each other if they ever got together because they were so broken. </li><li>Rikki tells Bucky what happened to her world, but she refuses to tell Steve because no matter how much she hates him, she knows it would kill him if he knew what he had caused. </li><li>There&rsquo;s an epic final battle where Sam, Rikki and Bucky team up and share the shield to defeat the new Psycho cap</li><li>Everyone is so pleased that they exonerate Bucky and Sam is the New Captain America </li><li>Rikki decides to travel the multiverse under the alias of Nomad (from the comics) fighting crime.

I&rsquo;m Y/F/N Y/L/N.&rdquo; You responded with glee as you shake his hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recognize you. Are you a new student?&rdquo; You ask. &ldquo;Yeah, actually. You have a nice eye.&rdquo; &ldquo;I mean, not necessarily but thanks.&rdquo; </p><p><i>Oh dear. He&rsquo;s a really attractive new student and I&rsquo;m his first friend?&iquest; I&rsquo;ve just struck gold.</i></p><p>&mdash;</p><p>You walk Peter to the cafeteria where you two buy your lunch and go to your table with Ned and MJ. &ldquo;Hey guys. Sorry I wasn&rsquo;t able to come here at recess. I gave this guy a tour of this trashy place.&rdquo; You apologize to them as you and Peter sit down on the vacant seats. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter, by the way.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Michelle, call me MJ. This is Ned.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So Peter, tell us more about yourself. Why&rsquo;d you transfer? What&rsquo;s your take on the school so far?&rdquo; Ned asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I came from&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I have to go to the restroom real quick.&rdquo; You interrupt him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, me too. Just keep talking. We&rsquo;ll catch up.&rdquo; MJ says before the two of you walk to the restroom, leaving Peter and Ned.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; Peter, huh?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;MJ, what does that mean?&rdquo; As you two walk to the restroom, MJ brings up something she noticed. &ldquo;I see the way you look at him.&rdquo; &ldquo;MJ, I have no idea what you&rsquo;re getting at.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, sure you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>While MJ was accusing you of having a thing for Peter, you couldn&rsquo;t help but think. <i>Maybe, I do have a thing for him. Maybe. Just maybe.</i></p><p>&mdash;</p><p><b>Notes</b> : Eeeee. That&rsquo;s that. If you liked it, thanks! Anyways, once again: Good day! :)</p></p>",
