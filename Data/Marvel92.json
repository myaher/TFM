Sometimes creepy, but always beautiful. And this stretch of highway on this particular night is no exception. Few lights meant that stars filled the sky. Your headlights chase them, always losing them just over the horizon of the road. It was hypnotic, soothing. A game you could play forever if the stars stayed in the sky. Unfortunately, you had been driving for hours already and you know you have to pull off soon.</p><p>\u201cTell me again why you wanted to drive back from the mission instead of taking the jet? You know the rest of the team was back at the tower by lunch, right?\u201d Clint shifts his foot on the dashboard of your rental and lolls his head in your direction.</p><p>\u201cFeet off the dash,\u201d you grumble.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cFine fine&hellip; sheesh, you\u2019re about as much fun on a road trip as Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been on a road trip with Steve?\u201d You risk a glance over at him but flick your eyes back to the road almost immediately. There&rsquo;s no traffic. It&rsquo;s just too hard to look at Clint in the starlit confines of the car.</p><p>\u201cNope, but Natasha has. She loves to tell that story when Steve\u2019s been a particular pain in her ass.\u201d</p><p>You nod, already tuning his voice out. But Clint knows you well. Too well. He reads the exhaustion on your face even in the half-light.</p><p>\u201cSo c\u2019mon, tell me.\u201d He pokes your shoulder, once. Then again. And again. Finally, he sets up a steady rhythm of pokes, managing to skip a poke every time you try to slap his hand away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to crash and it\u2019ll be your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna crash.\u201d Clint rolls his eyes at you, but the poking stops all the same. \u201cBut the curiosity will kill me. Why are we on this road trip through the middle of nowhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here because you \u2018wouldn\u2019t hear\u2019 of me taking the trip on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraveling alone is dangerous! It makes you, like, the easiest mark around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an <b>Avenger</b>. I think that disqualifies me as an \u2018easy mark\u2019, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a risk I&rsquo;m willing to take.\u201d Clint shrugs. His shoulders are loose, relaxed, but his tone is hard. You glance over at him again. He pretends not to notice as he glances out his window and falls silent</p><p>Long minutes stretch by. More stars vanish over the horizon in an endless loop of gleaming pinpricks just out of reach. Clint leans forward and fiddles with the radio until you growl at him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a deal.\u201d Clint turns to lean against his door, one leg tucked up onto the seat as he slips an arm behind his headrest. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the radio alone and stop poking you if you tell me why you opted for land over air.\u201d</p><p>You glower at him but he only smiles at you with infuriating calm. A flash of light ahead draws your eyes back to the road and you sigh with relief as you round a bend and a truck stop flares into brilliant existence.</p><p>\u201cSalvation.\u201d You breathe the word and make your way off the highway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting out of this car until you tell me what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d Clint frowns and you don\u2019t even have to look over to confirm it. You can hear it in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d you snap. And you immediately feel bad. Clint doesn\u2019t know why you\u2019re as upset as you are. He has no idea what being around him does to you now. What it felt like to realize he nearly took a bullet for you today. That you&rsquo;d nearly lost him. Him and his stupid jokes and his lazy smile and that twinkle in his eyes that you wanted to believe only appeared when you were around.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d Clint leans toward you and the parking lot lights throw him into sharp relief.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me do this, {YN}.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo wh-\u201d Your words cut off with a yelp as a dart whistles past your chest and embeds in the door lock.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d You pull into a parking spot and kill the engine. You tug on the door handle and the door tries to unlock, but the dart is wedged in far enough that it can\u2019t disconnect the mechanism.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s electric too,\u201d Clint adds when you move to pull it from the door.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Clint, disengage the dart and let me out of the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not until you tell me what\u2019s going on. You\u2019ve been acting weird for like a month and then I save your ass on the mission and you get the urge to run off on a road trip. Something is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d you growl. \u201cYou don&rsquo;t usually catch bullets for anyone else, you didn&rsquo;t have to do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Confusion color\u2019s Clint\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you come to me instead of Wanda?\u201d You round on him, both hands back on the steering wheel and gripping hard for lack of anything better to do with them.</p><p>\u201cBecause&hellip; because you\u2019re you.\u201d Clint shrugs. Your mouth opens and closes, the answer so vague you don\u2019t even know how to respond.</p><p>For a moment you stare at one another. And then, in slow motion, you see some kind of understanding dawn in Clint\u2019s eyes. You curse yourself for not keeping your mouth shut, your face neutral. For trying to outrun the fear of losing him instead of just swallowing it long enough to stay on the jet.</p><p>\u201c{YN}-\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget I asked. It\u2019s worth a shock to get out of this muggy car.\u201d You flinch as you wrap your fingers around the dart but nothing happens. Clint starts to speak but you rip it from the door and throw it down the moment you\u2019re out of the car.</p><p>\u201c{YN}, wait!\u201d Clint jumps out of the car and calls for you, but you just wave him off and stalk towards the truck stop.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower and food. You do you and we\u2019ll meet back up in an hour.\u201d</p><p>The clerk behind the counter is star-struck the second you walk in the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re&hellip; you\u2019re&hellip;\u201d He stammers over the words and you force a smile.</p><p>\u201cYep, one and the same. Look, I know the showers are for truckers only but I could really use-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the house!\u201d He slides a key to you across the counter. This time you give him a genuine smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll pay. I just appreciate getting to use it. Do you guys run tabs here? There\u2019s a bunch of stuff I need to get before I head back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for a hero!\u201d The guy flushes and pushes a few buttons on his register. \u201cAll set, you just go ahead and enjoy yourself, then let me know when you\u2019re ready to cash out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. You just made my day.\u201d</p><p>You grab the key and follow the signs that point back to the showers, stopping along the way to grab a few pieces of clothing in nondescript black. Most of the showers are unoccupied and you slip into the one furthest from the register. A quick scan with one of Tony\u2019s devices ensures you\u2019re not being recorded - god only know what SHIELD would go through if a video like that leaked - and you almost groan as you shuck your battle gear. Stark did everything he could to make the stealth suits more comfortable but the materials only gave him so much room to work. After the strain of battle and several hours in the car, it was a relief to let your skin breathe.</p><p>The steam builds around you until it blurs the lines of the shower tiles and dulls the faint sounds from the restaurant on the other side of the wall. If you let your eyes slip out of focus the steam almost feels like a wall between you and the world. Between you and Clint. You can&rsquo;t hear him and you can&rsquo;t see him. But you know he&rsquo;s there. You glance at the door and, almost on cue, a faint knock thunk thunks into the steam.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about this.\u201d His voice is impossible to read through the heavy metal door.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don&rsquo;t.\u201d</p><p>You rinse the last of the soap from your skin and cut the water. Without the shower for white noise, you can suddenly hear everything. Conversations from the restaurant, beeps and rings from the arcade games scattered throughout the building. And Clint&rsquo;s lockpick in the door.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m naked in here!\u201d You snag a towel from the shelf just outside the shower stall and manage to get it wrapped around the important bits before the bathroom door cracks open.</p><p>Steam rushes out as Clint slips in and closes the door behind him. He clicks the lock back into place and leans against the door, his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cI brought you some clothes.\u201d He holds out a bulging plastic bag. Your scowl falters as he jiggles the bag in your general direction, his eyes still closed tight. You wait for a few more heartbeats to see if he peeks, then grab the bag from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you mumble.</p><p>Clint nods and leans his head back against the wall, arms folded over his chest. He keeps his eyes closed and you can&rsquo;t help but take the chance to sneak a few glances at him. Each one lodges your heart in your throat. He knows. He saw it on your face and he knows and there&rsquo;s no going back from that. You had opted to drive back to New York so that you would have time to get rid of the fear you&rsquo;d felt on the mission. Fear of losing Clint, of seeing him die. It might have been possible, even with Clint in the car. But there was no getting past the fear now. Not until Clint said what he wanted to say and you said whatever was necessary to get him back in the car and back to New York.</p><p>You zip up the hoodie and stuff the bag into one of its pockets as you drop onto a plastic chair in one corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cAlright, out with it Barton.\u201d You drag your boots over and start lacing them up. Nothing matches but it &rsquo;s clean and comfortable. That&rsquo;s all you need until you get back to New York.</p><p>Clint is silent and you glance up before starting in on your second boot. He&rsquo;s still leaning against the door, his arms across his chest. His eyes meet yours.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stomp off again? Or do I get to say my piece?\u201d Clint arches one brow. You have the grace to flush faintly as you go back to your boots.</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;ve got the only exit covered.\u201d</p><p>Clint lets loose something between a sigh and a groan.</p><p>\u201cI usually love your attitude, but sometimes you&rsquo;re a real pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight back at ya.\u201d You finish tying your boots and sit back in the chair, one foot bouncing lightly. Most of you wants to book it back to the car but Clint&rsquo;s in the way. And this isn&rsquo;t something you can outrun. Especially not when it involves Clint \u201cdog with a bone\u201d Barton.</p><p>\u201cIs this why you didn&rsquo;t want to fly back? Were you&hellip;were you trying to get away from me?\u201d Clint&rsquo;s arms tense across his chest as he puffs himself up and glowers. But for all his bravado he won&rsquo;t meet your eyes. And that twists your heart around until you almost can&rsquo;t answer him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you choke out. Clint glances at you, still scowling, and you sigh. \u201cWell, I mean&hellip;kinda. Yes? I&hellip;I&hellip;Look, it&rsquo;s not easy to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me. It&rsquo;s not like I haven&rsquo;t been trying to listen.\u201d</p><p>You had to give him that one and your cheeks flush again as you look down at your boots. The words are slow in coming, but you owe him an explanation.</p><p>\u201cYou are&hellip;were&hellip;are&hellip;oh hell.\u201d You rub one hand over your face, take a deep breath, and try again, forcing your eyes up to his. \u201cYou&rsquo;re my closest friend. Have been for a while. But after a while, I realized that it was&hellip;more. To me, at least.\u201d</p><p>Clint opens his mouth to speak and you shake your head.</p><p>\u201cJust&hellip;please, let me finish.\u201d</p><p>He closes his mouth, jaw tense. You take another deep breath and lace your hands together to stop the small trembles dancing up and down your fingers. Facing down a Hydra cell was nothing compared to this.</p><p>\u201cI didn&rsquo;t want to ruin things so I didn&rsquo;t tell you. But you&hellip;that bullet&hellip;\u201d You stop and close your eyes, heart hammering against your ribs as the memories flood through you once more. The sound of the gun, the blur of Clint&rsquo;s uniform as he launched himself at you. Both of you going down just barely behind some cover. The bleeding and burned mark across Clint&rsquo;s ribs where a bullet had grazed him. Close. Too close.</p><p>\u201cYou could have died saving me.\u201d You can barely manage a whisper and it sounds like nothing next to the bass kick of your heart.</p><p>Clint&rsquo;s hand close around yours. You jump, nearly throwing yourself out of the chair as your eyes snap open. But Clint drags you back into the seat and slips one arm around your waist. He crouches in front of you, jaw tight and eyes hard.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d He asks. \u201cHow long have you felt like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of months,\u201d you whisper. Clint nods and looks down, his fingers tight around yours.</p><p>\u201cAnd you&rsquo;re sure? You&rsquo;re sure you wanna put up with more of my shit? That this is a mess you want to be tangled up with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I&rsquo;m any better?\u201d You can&rsquo;t help but laugh under your breath. Your heart still rages against your ribs but the banter is so familiar \u2013 his touch is so familiar \u2013 that you can fake normalcy. At least for the moment.</p><p>\u201cYou know me, darlin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m a careful person. Can&rsquo;t go around being reckless.\u201d</p><p>Your laugh is so loud and so sudden that it shocks your heart into something closer to a normal rhythm.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>Clint takes your hands in his and laces his fingers through yours.</p><p>\u201cSince this is you we&rsquo;re talking about. Like I said in the car, I risked a bullet because you&rsquo;re you. If I lost you&hellip;\u201d Clint trails off, then shakes his head. \u201cIt&rsquo;s just not an option, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you&hellip;I mean&hellip;\u201d Your words fade away as Clint smiles up at you.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too darlin&rsquo;. For a while now. Nat was sure you felt the same but you seemed so happy as friends. I didn&rsquo;t want to risk that. Risk you.\u201d</p><p>A smile slowly blooms on your lips.</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling, Barton. Believe me, I know that feeling.\u201d You let Clint pull you up to your feet, his fingers still interlaced with yours. His gaze lingers on yours for a moment before he pulls you against his chest and releases your hands to wrap you in his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo more running away, alright? I&rsquo;d rather plan our next road trip together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Your throat feels thick like you&rsquo;re about to cry, and you bury your face against the cotton of Clint&rsquo;s shirt. His hands brush down your back as he rests his cheek against the side of your head. You can hear his heartbeat under your ear, feel it against your chest. It&rsquo;s so close, so loud, that it finally drives away the fear that has been eating at you all day.</p><p>He was okay. He was here. And he loved you.</p>",

There\u2019s no traffic. It\u2019s just too hard to look at Clint in the starlit confines of the car.</p><p>\u201cNope, but Natasha has. She loves to tell that story when Steve\u2019s been a particular pain in her ass.\u201d</p><p>You nod, already tuning his voice out. But Clint knows you well. Too well. He reads the exhaustion on your face even in the half-light.</p><p>\u201cSo c\u2019mon, tell me.\u201d He pokes your shoulder, once. Then again. And again. Finally, he sets up a steady rhythm of pokes, managing to skip a poke every time you try to slap his hand away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to crash and it\u2019ll be your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna crash.\u201d Clint rolls his eyes at you, but the poking stops all the same. \u201cBut the curiosity will kill me.

You had opted to drive back to New York so that you would have time to get rid of the fear you\u2019d felt on the mission. Fear of losing Clint, of seeing him die. It might have been possible, even with Clint in the car. But there was no getting past the fear now. Not until Clint said what he wanted to say and you said whatever was necessary to get him back in the car and back to New York.</p><p>You zip up the hoodie and stuff the bag into one of its pockets as you drop onto a plastic chair in one corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cAlright, out with it Barton.\u201d You drag your boots over and start lacing them up. Nothing matches but it \u2019s clean and comfortable. That\u2019s all you need until you get back to New York.</p><p>Clint is silent and you glance up before starting in on your second boot. He\u2019s still leaning against the door, his arms across his chest. His eyes meet yours.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stomp off again? Or do I get to say my piece?\u201d Clint arches one brow. You have the grace to flush faintly as you go back to your boots.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the only exit covered.\u201d</p><p>Clint lets loose something between a sigh and a groan.</p><p>\u201cI usually love your attitude, but sometimes you\u2019re a real pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight back at ya.\u201d You finish tying your boots and sit back in the chair, one foot bouncing lightly. Most of you wants to book it back to the car but Clint\u2019s in the way. And this isn\u2019t something you can outrun. Especially not when it involves Clint \u201cdog with a bone\u201d Barton.</p><p>\u201cIs this why you didn\u2019t want to fly back? Were you\u2026were you trying to get away from me?\u201d Clint\u2019s arms tense across his chest as he puffs himself up and glowers. But for all his bravado he won\u2019t meet your eyes. And that twists your heart around until you almost can\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you choke out. Clint glances at you, still scowling, and you sigh. \u201cWell, I mean\u2026kinda. Yes? I\u2026I\u2026Look, it\u2019s not easy to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been trying to listen.\u201d</p><p>You had to give him that one and your cheeks flush again as you look down at your boots. The words are slow in coming, but you owe him an explanation.</p><p>\u201cYou are\u2026were\u2026are\u2026oh hell.\u201d You rub one hand over your face, take a deep breath, and try again, forcing your eyes up to his. \u201cYou\u2019re my closest friend. Have been for a while. But after a while, I realized that it was\u2026more. To me, at least.\u201d</p><p>Clint opens his mouth to speak and you shake your head.</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026please, let me finish.\u201d</p><p>He closes his mouth, jaw tense. You take another deep breath and lace your hands together to stop the small trembles dancing up and down your fingers. Facing down a Hydra cell was nothing compared to this.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin things so I didn\u2019t tell you. But you\u2026that bullet\u2026\u201d You stop and close your eyes, heart hammering against your ribs as the memories flood through you once more. The sound of the gun, the blur of Clint\u2019s uniform as he launched himself at you. Both of you going down just barely behind some cover. The bleeding and burned mark across Clint\u2019s ribs where a bullet had grazed him. Close. Too close.</p><p>\u201cYou could have died saving me.\u201d You can barely manage a whisper and it sounds like nothing next to the bass kick of your heart.</p><p>Clint\u2019s hand close around yours. You jump, nearly throwing yourself out of the chair as your eyes snap open. But Clint drags you back into the seat and slips one arm around your waist. He crouches in front of you, jaw tight and eyes hard.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d He asks. \u201cHow long have you felt like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of months,\u201d you whisper. Clint nods and looks down, his fingers tight around yours.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure? You\u2019re sure you wanna put up with more of my shit? That this is a mess you want to be tangled up with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m any better?\u201d You can\u2019t help but laugh under your breath. Your heart still rages against your ribs but the banter is so familiar \u2013 his touch is so familiar \u2013 that you can fake normalcy. At least for the moment.</p><p>\u201cYou know me, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m a careful person. Can\u2019t go around being reckless.\u201d</p><p>Your laugh is so loud and so sudden that it shocks your heart into something closer to a normal rhythm.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>Clint takes your hands in his and laces his fingers through yours.</p><p>\u201cSince this is you we\u2019re talking about. Like I said in the car, I risked a bullet because you\u2019re you. If I lost you\u2026\u201d Clint trails off, then shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just not an option, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2026I mean\u2026\u201d Your words fade away as Clint smiles up at you.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too darlin\u2019. For a while now. Nat was sure you felt the same but you seemed so happy as friends. I didn\u2019t want to risk that. Risk you.\u201d</p><p>A smile slowly blooms on your lips.</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling, Barton. Believe me, I know that feeling.\u201d You let Clint pull you up to your feet, his fingers still interlaced with yours. His gaze lingers on yours for a moment before he pulls you against his chest and releases your hands to wrap you in his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo more running away, alright? I\u2019d rather plan our next road trip together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Your throat feels thick like you\u2019re about to cry, and you bury your face against the cotton of Clint\u2019s shirt. His hands brush down your back as he rests his cheek against the side of your head. You can hear his heartbeat under your ear, feel it against your chest. It\u2019s so close, so loud, that it finally drives away the fear that has been eating at you all day.</p><p>He was okay. He was here. And he loved you.</p></p>",

Sometimes creepy, but always beautiful. And this stretch of highway on this particular night is no exception. Few lights meant that stars filled the sky. Your headlights chase them, always losing them just over the horizon of the road. It was hypnotic, soothing. A game you could play forever if the stars stayed in the sky. Unfortunately, you had been driving for hours already and you know you have to pull off soon.</p><p>\u201cTell me again why you wanted to drive back from the mission instead of taking the jet? You know the rest of the team was back at the tower by lunch, right?\u201d Clint shifts his foot on the dashboard of your rental and lolls his head in your direction.</p><p>\u201cFeet off the dash,\u201d you grumble.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cFine fine\u2026 sheesh, you\u2019re about as much fun on a road trip as Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been on a road trip with Steve?\u201d You risk a glance over at him but flick your eyes back to the road almost immediately. There\u2019s no traffic. It\u2019s just too hard to look at Clint in the starlit confines of the car.</p><p>\u201cNope, but Natasha has. She loves to tell that story when Steve\u2019s been a particular pain in her ass.\u201d</p><p>You nod, already tuning his voice out. But Clint knows you well. Too well. He reads the exhaustion on your face even in the half-light.</p><p>\u201cSo c\u2019mon, tell me.\u201d He pokes your shoulder, once. Then again. And again. Finally, he sets up a steady rhythm of pokes, managing to skip a poke every time you try to slap his hand away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to crash and it\u2019ll be your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna crash.\u201d Clint rolls his eyes at you, but the poking stops all the same. \u201cBut the curiosity will kill me. Why are we on this road trip through the middle of nowhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here because you \u2018wouldn\u2019t hear\u2019 of me taking the trip on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraveling alone is dangerous! It makes you, like, the easiest mark around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an <b>Avenger</b>. I think that disqualifies me as an \u2018easy mark\u2019, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a risk I\u2019m willing to take.\u201d Clint shrugs. His shoulders are loose, relaxed, but his tone is hard. You glance over at him again. He pretends not to notice as he glances out his window and falls silent</p><p>Long minutes stretch by. More stars vanish over the horizon in an endless loop of gleaming pinpricks just out of reach. Clint leans forward and fiddles with the radio until you growl at him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a deal.\u201d Clint turns to lean against his door, one leg tucked up onto the seat as he slips an arm behind his headrest. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the radio alone and stop poking you if you tell me why you opted for land over air.\u201d</p><p>You glower at him but he only smiles at you with infuriating calm. A flash of light ahead draws your eyes back to the road and you sigh with relief as you round a bend and a truck stop flares into brilliant existence.</p><p>\u201cSalvation.\u201d You breathe the word and make your way off the highway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting out of this car until you tell me what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d Clint frowns and you don\u2019t even have to look over to confirm it. You can hear it in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d you snap. And you immediately feel bad. Clint doesn\u2019t know why you\u2019re as upset as you are. He has no idea what being around him does to you now. What it felt like to realize he nearly took a bullet for you today. That you\u2019d nearly lost him. Him and his stupid jokes and his lazy smile and that twinkle in his eyes that you wanted to believe only appeared when you were around.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d Clint leans toward you and the parking lot lights throw him into sharp relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me do this, {YN}.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo wh-\u201d Your words cut off with a yelp as a dart whistles past your chest and embeds in the door lock.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d You pull into a parking spot and kill the engine. You tug on the door handle and the door tries to unlock, but the dart is wedged in far enough that it can\u2019t disconnect the mechanism.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s electric too,\u201d Clint adds when you move to pull it from the door.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Clint, disengage the dart and let me out of the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not until you tell me what\u2019s going on. You\u2019ve been acting weird for like a month and then I save your ass on the mission and you get the urge to run off on a road trip. Something is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d you growl. \u201cYou don\u2019t usually catch bullets for anyone else, you didn\u2019t have to do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Confusion color\u2019s Clint\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you come to me instead of Wanda?\u201d You round on him, both hands back on the steering wheel and gripping hard for lack of anything better to do with them.</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2026 because you\u2019re you.\u201d Clint shrugs. Your mouth opens and closes, the answer so vague you don\u2019t even know how to respond.</p><p>For a moment you stare at one another. And then, in slow motion, you see some kind of understanding dawn in Clint\u2019s eyes. You curse yourself for not keeping your mouth shut, your face neutral. For trying to outrun the fear of losing him instead of just swallowing it long enough to stay on the jet.</p><p>\u201c{YN}-\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget I asked. It\u2019s worth a shock to get out of this muggy car.\u201d You flinch as you wrap your fingers around the dart but nothing happens. Clint starts to speak but you rip it from the door and throw it down the moment you\u2019re out of the car.</p><p>\u201c{YN}, wait!\u201d Clint jumps out of the car and calls for you, but you just wave him off and stalk towards the truck stop.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower and food. You do you and we\u2019ll meet back up in an hour.\u201d</p><p>The clerk behind the counter is star-struck the second you walk in the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re\u2026\u201d He stammers over the words and you force a smile.</p><p>\u201cYep, one and the same. Look, I know the showers are for truckers only but I could really use-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the house!\u201d He slides a key to you across the counter. This time you give him a genuine smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll pay. I just appreciate getting to use it. Do you guys run tabs here? There\u2019s a bunch of stuff I need to get before I head back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for a hero!\u201d The guy flushes and pushes a few buttons on his register. \u201cAll set, you just go ahead and enjoy yourself, then let me know when you\u2019re ready to cash out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. You just made my day.\u201d</p><p>You grab the key and follow the signs that point back to the showers, stopping along the way to grab a few pieces of clothing in nondescript black. Most of the showers are unoccupied and you slip into the one furthest from the register. A quick scan with one of Tony\u2019s devices ensures you\u2019re not being recorded - god only know what SHIELD would go through if a video like that leaked - and you almost groan as you shuck your battle gear. Stark did everything he could to make the stealth suits more comfortable but the materials only gave him so much room to work. After the strain of battle and several hours in the car, it was a relief to let your skin breathe.</p><p>The steam builds around you until it blurs the lines of the shower tiles and dulls the faint sounds from the restaurant on the other side of the wall. If you let your eyes slip out of focus the steam almost feels like a wall between you and the world. Between you and Clint. You can\u2019t hear him and you can\u2019t see him. But you know he\u2019s there. You glance at the door and, almost on cue, a faint knock thunk thunks into the steam.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about this.\u201d His voice is impossible to read through the heavy metal door.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>You rinse the last of the soap from your skin and cut the water. Without the shower for white noise, you can suddenly hear everything. Conversations from the restaurant, beeps and rings from the arcade games scattered throughout the building. And Clint\u2019s lockpick in the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naked in here!\u201d You snag a towel from the shelf just outside the shower stall and manage to get it wrapped around the important bits before the bathroom door cracks open.</p><p>Steam rushes out as Clint slips in and closes the door behind him. He clicks the lock back into place and leans against the door, his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cI brought you some clothes.\u201d He holds out a bulging plastic bag. Your scowl falters as he jiggles the bag in your general direction, his eyes still closed tight. You wait for a few more heartbeats to see if he peeks, then grab the bag from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you mumble.</p><p>Clint nods and leans his head back against the wall, arms folded over his chest. He keeps his eyes closed and you can\u2019t help but take the chance to sneak a few glances at him. Each one lodges your heart in your throat. He knows. He saw it on your face and he knows and there\u2019s no going back from that. You had opted to drive back to New York so that you would have time to get rid of the fear you\u2019d felt on the mission. Fear of losing Clint, of seeing him die. It might have been possible, even with Clint in the car. But there was no getting past the fear now. Not until Clint said what he wanted to say and you said whatever was necessary to get him back in the car and back to New York.</p><p>You zip up the hoodie and stuff the bag into one of its pockets as you drop onto a plastic chair in one corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cAlright, out with it Barton.\u201d You drag your boots over and start lacing them up. Nothing matches but it \u2019s clean and comfortable. That\u2019s all you need until you get back to New York.</p><p>Clint is silent and you glance up before starting in on your second boot. He\u2019s still leaning against the door, his arms across his chest. His eyes meet yours.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stomp off again? Or do I get to say my piece?\u201d Clint arches one brow. You have the grace to flush faintly as you go back to your boots.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the only exit covered.\u201d</p><p>Clint lets loose something between a sigh and a groan.</p><p>\u201cI usually love your attitude, but sometimes you\u2019re a real pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight back at ya.\u201d You finish tying your boots and sit back in the chair, one foot bouncing lightly. Most of you wants to book it back to the car but Clint\u2019s in the way. And this isn\u2019t something you can outrun. Especially not when it involves Clint \u201cdog with a bone\u201d Barton.</p><p>\u201cIs this why you didn\u2019t want to fly back? Were you\u2026were you trying to get away from me?\u201d Clint\u2019s arms tense across his chest as he puffs himself up and glowers. But for all his bravado he won\u2019t meet your eyes. And that twists your heart around until you almost can\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you choke out. Clint glances at you, still scowling, and you sigh. \u201cWell, I mean\u2026kinda. Yes? I\u2026I\u2026Look, it\u2019s not easy to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been trying to listen.\u201d</p><p>You had to give him that one and your cheeks flush again as you look down at your boots. The words are slow in coming, but you owe him an explanation.</p><p>\u201cYou are\u2026were\u2026are\u2026oh hell.\u201d You rub one hand over your face, take a deep breath, and try again, forcing your eyes up to his. \u201cYou\u2019re my closest friend. Have been for a while. But after a while, I realized that it was\u2026more. To me, at least.\u201d</p><p>Clint opens his mouth to speak and you shake your head.</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026please, let me finish.\u201d</p><p>He closes his mouth, jaw tense. You take another deep breath and lace your hands together to stop the small trembles dancing up and down your fingers. Facing down a Hydra cell was nothing compared to this.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin things so I didn\u2019t tell you. But you\u2026that bullet\u2026\u201d You stop and close your eyes, heart hammering against your ribs as the memories flood through you once more. The sound of the gun, the blur of Clint\u2019s uniform as he launched himself at you. Both of you going down just barely behind some cover. The bleeding and burned mark across Clint\u2019s ribs where a bullet had grazed him. Close. Too close.</p><p>\u201cYou could have died saving me.\u201d You can barely manage a whisper and it sounds like nothing next to the bass kick of your heart.</p><p>Clint\u2019s hand close around yours. You jump, nearly throwing yourself out of the chair as your eyes snap open. But Clint drags you back into the seat and slips one arm around your waist. He crouches in front of you, jaw tight and eyes hard.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d He asks. \u201cHow long have you felt like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of months,\u201d you whisper. Clint nods and looks down, his fingers tight around yours.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure? You\u2019re sure you wanna put up with more of my shit? That this is a mess you want to be tangled up with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m any better?\u201d You can\u2019t help but laugh under your breath. Your heart still rages against your ribs but the banter is so familiar \u2013 his touch is so familiar \u2013 that you can fake normalcy. At least for the moment.</p><p>\u201cYou know me, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m a careful person. Can\u2019t go around being reckless.\u201d</p><p>Your laugh is so loud and so sudden that it shocks your heart into something closer to a normal rhythm.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>Clint takes your hands in his and laces his fingers through yours.</p><p>\u201cSince this is you we\u2019re talking about. Like I said in the car, I risked a bullet because you\u2019re you. If I lost you\u2026\u201d Clint trails off, then shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just not an option, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2026I mean\u2026\u201d Your words fade away as Clint smiles up at you.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too darlin\u2019. For a while now. Nat was sure you felt the same but you seemed so happy as friends. I didn\u2019t want to risk that. Risk you.\u201d</p><p>A smile slowly blooms on your lips.</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling, Barton. Believe me, I know that feeling.\u201d You let Clint pull you up to your feet, his fingers still interlaced with yours. His gaze lingers on yours for a moment before he pulls you against his chest and releases your hands to wrap you in his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo more running away, alright? I\u2019d rather plan our next road trip together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Your throat feels thick like you\u2019re about to cry, and you bury your face against the cotton of Clint\u2019s shirt. His hands brush down your back as he rests his cheek against the side of your head. You can hear his heartbeat under your ear, feel it against your chest. It\u2019s so close, so loud, that it finally drives away the fear that has been eating at you all day.</p><p>He was okay. He was here. And he loved you.</p></p>",

Sometimes creepy, but always beautiful. And this stretch of highway on this particular night is no exception. Few lights meant that stars filled the sky. Your headlights chase them, always losing them just over the horizon of the road. It was hypnotic, soothing. A game you could play forever if the stars stayed in the sky. Unfortunately, you had been driving for hours already and you know you have to pull off soon.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me again why you wanted to drive back from the mission instead of taking the jet? You know the rest of the team was back at the tower by lunch, right?&rdquo; Clint shifts his foot on the dashboard of your rental and lolls his head in your direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Feet off the dash,&rdquo; you grumble.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine fine&hellip; sheesh, you&rsquo;re about as much fun on a road trip as Rogers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been on a road trip with Steve?&rdquo; You risk a glance over at him but flick your eyes back to the road almost immediately. There&rsquo;s no traffic. It&rsquo;s just too hard to look at Clint in the starlit confines of the car.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, but Natasha has. She loves to tell that story when Steve&rsquo;s been a particular pain in her ass.&rdquo;</p><p>You nod, already tuning his voice out. But Clint knows you well. Too well. He reads the exhaustion on your face even in the half-light.</p><p>&ldquo;So c&rsquo;mon, tell me.&rdquo; He pokes your shoulder, once. Then again. And again. Finally, he sets up a steady rhythm of pokes, managing to skip a poke every time you try to slap his hand away.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to crash and it&rsquo;ll be your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not gonna crash.&rdquo; Clint rolls his eyes at you, but the poking stops all the same. &ldquo;But the curiosity will kill me. Why are we on this road trip through the middle of nowhere?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here because you &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t hear&rsquo; of me taking the trip on my own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Traveling alone is dangerous! It makes you, like, the easiest mark around.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an <b>Avenger</b>. I think that disqualifies me as an &lsquo;easy mark&rsquo;, thank you very much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a risk I&rsquo;m willing to take.&rdquo; Clint shrugs. His shoulders are loose, relaxed, but his tone is hard. You glance over at him again. He pretends not to notice as he glances out his window and falls silent</p><p>Long minutes stretch by. More stars vanish over the horizon in an endless loop of gleaming pinpricks just out of reach. Clint leans forward and fiddles with the radio until you growl at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a deal.&rdquo; Clint turns to lean against his door, one leg tucked up onto the seat as he slips an arm behind his headrest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the radio alone and stop poking you if you tell me why you opted for land over air.&rdquo;</p><p>You glower at him but he only smiles at you with infuriating calm. A flash of light ahead draws your eyes back to the road and you sigh with relief as you round a bend and a truck stop flares into brilliant existence.</p><p>&ldquo;Salvation.&rdquo; You breathe the word and make your way off the highway.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting out of this car until you tell me what&rsquo;s going on with you.&rdquo; Clint frowns and you don&rsquo;t even have to look over to confirm it. You can hear it in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Watch me,&rdquo; you snap. And you immediately feel bad. Clint doesn&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re as upset as you are. He has no idea what being around him does to you now. What it felt like to realize he nearly took a bullet for you today. That you&rsquo;d nearly lost him. Him and his stupid jokes and his lazy smile and that twinkle in his eyes that you wanted to believe only appeared when you were around.</p><p>&ldquo;Talk to me.&rdquo; Clint leans toward you and the parking lot lights throw him into sharp relief.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me do this, {YN}.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do wh-&rdquo; Your words cut off with a yelp as a dart whistles past your chest and embeds in the door lock.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you fucking serious?&rdquo; You pull into a parking spot and kill the engine. You tug on the door handle and the door tries to unlock, but the dart is wedged in far enough that it can&rsquo;t disconnect the mechanism.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s electric too,&rdquo; Clint adds when you move to pull it from the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Damnit, Clint, disengage the dart and let me out of the car.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, not until you tell me what&rsquo;s going on. You&rsquo;ve been acting weird for like a month and then I save your ass on the mission and you get the urge to run off on a road trip. Something is wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to do that,&rdquo; you growl. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t usually catch bullets for anyone else, you didn&rsquo;t have to do it for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo; Confusion color&rsquo;s Clint&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? Why did you come to me instead of Wanda?&rdquo; You round on him, both hands back on the steering wheel and gripping hard for lack of anything better to do with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Because&hellip; because you&rsquo;re you.&rdquo; Clint shrugs. Your mouth opens and closes, the answer so vague you don&rsquo;t even know how to respond.</p><p>For a moment you stare at one another. And then, in slow motion, you see some kind of understanding dawn in Clint&rsquo;s eyes. You curse yourself for not keeping your mouth shut, your face neutral. For trying to outrun the fear of losing him instead of just swallowing it long enough to stay on the jet.</p><p>&ldquo;{YN}-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forget I asked. It&rsquo;s worth a shock to get out of this muggy car.&rdquo; You flinch as you wrap your fingers around the dart but nothing happens. Clint starts to speak but you rip it from the door and throw it down the moment you&rsquo;re out of the car.</p><p>&ldquo;{YN}, wait!&rdquo; Clint jumps out of the car and calls for you, but you just wave him off and stalk towards the truck stop.</p><p>&ldquo;I need a shower and food. You do you and we&rsquo;ll meet back up in an hour.&rdquo;</p><p>The clerk behind the counter is star-struck the second you walk in the door.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&hellip; you&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo; He stammers over the words and you force a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, one and the same. Look, I know the showers are for truckers only but I could really use-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the house!&rdquo; He slides a key to you across the counter. This time you give him a genuine smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll pay. I just appreciate getting to use it. Do you guys run tabs here? There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff I need to get before I head back out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything for a hero!&rdquo; The guy flushes and pushes a few buttons on his register. &ldquo;All set, you just go ahead and enjoy yourself, then let me know when you&rsquo;re ready to cash out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much. You just made my day.&rdquo;</p><p>You grab the key and follow the signs that point back to the showers, stopping along the way to grab a few pieces of clothing in nondescript black. Most of the showers are unoccupied and you slip into the one furthest from the register. A quick scan with one of Tony&rsquo;s devices ensures you&rsquo;re not being recorded - god only know what SHIELD would go through if a video like that leaked - and you almost groan as you shuck your battle gear. Stark did everything he could to make the stealth suits more comfortable but the materials only gave him so much room to work. After the strain of battle and several hours in the car, it was a relief to let your skin breathe.</p><p>The steam builds around you until it blurs the lines of the shower tiles and dulls the faint sounds from the restaurant on the other side of the wall. If you let your eyes slip out of focus the steam almost feels like a wall between you and the world. Between you and Clint. You can&rsquo;t hear him and you can&rsquo;t see him. But you know he&rsquo;s there. You glance at the door and, almost on cue, a faint knock thunk thunks into the steam.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk about this.&rdquo; His voice is impossible to read through the heavy metal door.</p><p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>You rinse the last of the soap from your skin and cut the water. Without the shower for white noise, you can suddenly hear everything. Conversations from the restaurant, beeps and rings from the arcade games scattered throughout the building. And Clint&rsquo;s lockpick in the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m naked in here!&rdquo; You snag a towel from the shelf just outside the shower stall and manage to get it wrapped around the important bits before the bathroom door cracks open.</p><p>Steam rushes out as Clint slips in and closes the door behind him. He clicks the lock back into place and leans against the door, his eyes closed.</p><p>&ldquo;I brought you some clothes.&rdquo; He holds out a bulging plastic bag. Your scowl falters as he jiggles the bag in your general direction, his eyes still closed tight. You wait for a few more heartbeats to see if he peeks, then grab the bag from his fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you mumble.</p><p>Clint nods and leans his head back against the wall, arms folded over his chest. He keeps his eyes closed and you can&rsquo;t help but take the chance to sneak a few glances at him. Each one lodges your heart in your throat. He knows. He saw it on your face and he knows and there&rsquo;s no going back from that. You had opted to drive back to New York so that you would have time to get rid of the fear you&rsquo;d felt on the mission. Fear of losing Clint, of seeing him die. It might have been possible, even with Clint in the car. But there was no getting past the fear now. Not until Clint said what he wanted to say and you said whatever was necessary to get him back in the car and back to New York.</p><p>You zip up the hoodie and stuff the bag into one of its pockets as you drop onto a plastic chair in one corner of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, out with it Barton.&rdquo; You drag your boots over and start lacing them up. Nothing matches but it &rsquo;s clean and comfortable. That&rsquo;s all you need until you get back to New York.</p><p>Clint is silent and you glance up before starting in on your second boot. He&rsquo;s still leaning against the door, his arms across his chest. His eyes meet yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to stomp off again? Or do I get to say my piece?&rdquo; Clint arches one brow. You have the grace to flush faintly as you go back to your boots.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the only exit covered.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint lets loose something between a sigh and a groan.</p><p>&ldquo;I usually love your attitude, but sometimes you&rsquo;re a real pain in the ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right back at ya.&rdquo; You finish tying your boots and sit back in the chair, one foot bouncing lightly. Most of you wants to book it back to the car but Clint&rsquo;s in the way. And this isn&rsquo;t something you can outrun. Especially not when it involves Clint &ldquo;dog with a bone&rdquo; Barton.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this why you didn&rsquo;t want to fly back? Were you&hellip;were you trying to get away from me?&rdquo; Clint&rsquo;s arms tense across his chest as he puffs himself up and glowers. But for all his bravado he won&rsquo;t meet your eyes. And that twists your heart around until you almost can&rsquo;t answer him.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you choke out. Clint glances at you, still scowling, and you sigh. &ldquo;Well, I mean&hellip;kinda. Yes? I&hellip;I&hellip;Look, it&rsquo;s not easy to explain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try me. It&rsquo;s not like I haven&rsquo;t been trying to listen.&rdquo;</p><p>You had to give him that one and your cheeks flush again as you look down at your boots. The words are slow in coming, but you owe him an explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;You are&hellip;were&hellip;are&hellip;oh hell.&rdquo; You rub one hand over your face, take a deep breath, and try again, forcing your eyes up to his. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my closest friend. Have been for a while. But after a while, I realized that it was&hellip;more. To me, at least.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint opens his mouth to speak and you shake your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip;please, let me finish.&rdquo;</p><p>He closes his mouth, jaw tense. You take another deep breath and lace your hands together to stop the small trembles dancing up and down your fingers. Facing down a Hydra cell was nothing compared to this.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin things so I didn&rsquo;t tell you. But you&hellip;that bullet&hellip;&rdquo; You stop and close your eyes, heart hammering against your ribs as the memories flood through you once more. The sound of the gun, the blur of Clint&rsquo;s uniform as he launched himself at you. Both of you going down just barely behind some cover. The bleeding and burned mark across Clint&rsquo;s ribs where a bullet had grazed him. Close. Too close.</p><p>&ldquo;You could have died saving me.&rdquo; You can barely manage a whisper and it sounds like nothing next to the bass kick of your heart.</p><p>Clint&rsquo;s hand close around yours. You jump, nearly throwing yourself out of the chair as your eyes snap open. But Clint drags you back into the seat and slips one arm around your waist. He crouches in front of you, jaw tight and eyes hard.</p><p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo; He asks. &ldquo;How long have you felt like this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A couple of months,&rdquo; you whisper. Clint nods and looks down, his fingers tight around yours.</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sure? You&rsquo;re sure you wanna put up with more of my shit? That this is a mess you want to be tangled up with?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like I&rsquo;m any better?&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t help but laugh under your breath. Your heart still rages against your ribs but the banter is so familiar &ndash; his touch is so familiar &ndash; that you can fake normalcy. At least for the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;You know me, darlin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m a careful person. Can&rsquo;t go around being reckless.&rdquo;</p><p>Your laugh is so loud and so sudden that it shocks your heart into something closer to a normal rhythm.</p><p>&ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;</p><p>Clint takes your hands in his and laces his fingers through yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Since this is you we&rsquo;re talking about. Like I said in the car, I risked a bullet because you&rsquo;re you. If I lost you&hellip;&rdquo; Clint trails off, then shakes his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not an option, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&hellip;I mean&hellip;&rdquo; Your words fade away as Clint smiles up at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, me too darlin&rsquo;. For a while now. Nat was sure you felt the same but you seemed so happy as friends. I didn&rsquo;t want to risk that. Risk you.&rdquo;</p><p>A smile slowly blooms on your lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I know that feeling, Barton. Believe me, I know that feeling.&rdquo; You let Clint pull you up to your feet, his fingers still interlaced with yours. His gaze lingers on yours for a moment before he pulls you against his chest and releases your hands to wrap you in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;No more running away, alright?
