Looking down, I could see backstage, and it was so fun to watch guitars getting tuned and people running around during Kacey\u2019s set. And when Harry came on? I\u2019ve thought about it and checked with Bander, and she agreed: Harry looked right at us with a giant grin. We definitely stood out in the section, and we were right up front. I\u2019m not kidding when I say that I think about it and can\u2019t stop smiling. Ugh.\u00a0</p><p>Every bit of energy was ramped up as compared with the previous show.

B stage was a long, low rumble of thunder, each song full of promise. When he stayed after IICF the room felt like it shook, we were all on edge wanting to know what was next (I was anyway, I guess some folks knew GC was coming). And gosh, Girl Crush was amazing. I never thought I\u2019d hear it live, and it felt so special. So honest and bare and bold. Like. My fuckin heart.

There was something about it that I didn\u2019t love. But seeing it live? FUCK. Transformative. Seeing it live three times in a row with Harry getting (impossibly) more amped at each go, running to B Stage and back to sing more in spite of having just done an astonishingly energetic 2 hr show and jumping and flailing all around the stage, falling to his knees, just letting fucking loose?

We celebrated her birthday today in the best of fashion\u2013swimming in the Pacific and eating her favorite kind of food (organic plant-based stuff, @ cafe gratitude) and just generally bopping around LA listening to music and laughing our asses off. It was fuckin great.\u00a0</p><p>But!! I need to write about the show.\u00a0</p><p>First of all, the show at the Forum was more magical than the show in San Jose, for me. The venue was perfect for Harry: the acoustics, the drama, the lighting, all of it. And somehow, though it really shouldn\u2019t have been possible, we ended up with the most amazing seats I could\u2019ve imagined. We were on the first row behind stage right. Looking down, I could see backstage, and it was so fun to watch guitars getting tuned and people running around during Kacey\u2019s set. And when Harry came on? I\u2019ve thought about it and checked with Bander, and she agreed: Harry looked right at us with a giant grin. We definitely stood out in the section, and we were right up front. I\u2019m not kidding when I say that I think about it and can\u2019t stop smiling. Ugh.\u00a0</p><p>Every bit of energy was ramped up as compared with the previous show. The room felt different, Harry felt different,\u00a0 it was all just so much more. Bigger. Like the moment right before a storm hits and the air changes and you know the rain is gonna pour any minute.\u00a0</p><p>Of course there was more than one storm. B stage was a long, low rumble of thunder, each song full of promise. When he stayed after IICF the room felt like it shook, we were all on edge wanting to know what was next (I was anyway, I guess some folks knew GC was coming). And gosh, Girl Crush was amazing. I never thought I\u2019d hear it live, and it felt so special. So honest and bare and bold. Like. My fuckin heart. Damn.\u00a0</p><p>And then there\u2019s the moment, which I don\u2019t see as a coming out any more than the multitude of other signals he\u2019s given. But when he said \u201cwe\u2019re all a little bit gay,\u201d I definitely had a moment of nodding along like\u2013okay then, yes, good, he keeps upping the ante and I see it and love it. The cheers from the crowd felt really good there, too. He really was making it a space for everyone to be free. And then WMYB, which has always been my problematic fave but which he\u2019s turned into a song of my heart: an anthem of self acceptance and queerness, of being the person who everyone sees is queer\u2013 weird and gay and just Not Like Everyone \u2013and seeing yourself as less than, only to have this fucking sweetheart up there saying,\u00a0\u201cno no no, you\u2019ve got it all wrong!! being a rainbow is what makes you beautiful! and i want you to know it!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>IT IS SO IMPORTANT AND IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY AND I WANT TO SHOUT ABOUT IT SO HERE\u2019S THAT FOR A MOMENT.\u00a0</p><p>Ahem. Anyway. KiwiKiwiKiwi!!!!! Y\u2019all, it\u2019s confession time: I wasn\u2019t hyped on Kiwi on the album. I mean, I like it. But sometimes it was just a little\u2026much? Not enough? IDK. There was something about it that I didn\u2019t love. But seeing it live? FUCK. Transformative. Seeing it live three times in a row with Harry getting (impossibly) more amped at each go, running to B Stage and back to sing more in spite of having just done an astonishingly energetic 2 hr show and jumping and flailing all around the stage, falling to his knees, just letting fucking loose? Damn.\u00a0</p><p>I have never screamed like I was screaming. Except that\u2019s a lie, because I have, but it\u2019s usually alone in my car, blasting Bikini Kill to induce cartharsis. No, the only thing I can equate with my feelings during Kiwi are the years when I was super religious in high school and really let loose at a Catholic youth event. It was that kind of euphoria\u2013 the sort that comes from the emotional high of releasing your worry and fear and letting another energy fill up all that space. Kiwi filled up that space with sound and exuberant joy. With love.\u00a0</p><p>Man, it was fucking beautiful.\u00a0</p><p>I still can\u2019t believe it was real. I can\u2019t believe I have to wait so long to see him again. I can\u2019t believe anything could be better (though I have a feeling that LT1 is going to match it, because if there\u2019s anyone I love as much as Harry, it\u2019s Louis.)</p>",

Are you&mdash;&ldquo; </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I wanna talk to Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; He croaked out. Himself didn&rsquo;t even understands his words that came out from his mouth, but he wants to talk to her so bad, so all his pain will go away. His driver quickly dialed her number, and gave it to Harry. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Her voice made him sigh in relief. He found his heart going back to it&rsquo;s natural phase and he couldn&rsquo;t ask for any better.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, angel.&rdquo; He whispered. She giggled a little bit, and Harry didn&rsquo;t paid any attention of his surroundings anymore, all of his attention was on hers. He missed her so much, not being to see her for months was killing him slowly inside. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You okay? Already saw some of your pictures here.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine now, just had a little panic attack &lsquo;s all.&rdquo; He heard her gasp at the other line, which made him look out of the window, already expecting her to freak out. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh my god, Harry, are you okay now?&rdquo; She was pacing around the room, full of worries in her voice. Harry sighed, and ran his hand through his hair. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine now, really, but it would be better if you were here.&rdquo; A smile were formed on her lips as he said those words, he never failed to make her feel loved and appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I know, but, I want you to stay safe there, alright?&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I will. Love you.&rdquo; He smirked against the phone, which made her smile on the other line. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p>",
