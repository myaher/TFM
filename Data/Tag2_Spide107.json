Spiderman becomes Spiderwoman. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of FTM Spiderman but not a lot (if any) MTF spiderwoman. </i></b></p><p><span class=\"npf_color_joey\"><b><i>Note: this is also published on my Wattpad account: Banana_Bus_Girl. </i></b></span></p><p>Peter was proud to be Spiderman, he was happy when people called out to him, he enjoyed being a superhero. But the problem was, he didn&rsquo;t want to be a spider man, but a spider woman. Okay spider girl maybe, but the same still applies. </p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t even want to be Peter anymore, he never had. He wanted to be Pandora Parker. He wanted to be a her. </p><p>She was confident and loved herself. She was still best friends with Ned, she still made lego sculptures, she still took science, and she was still a vigilante. So why was Pandora so scared to tell people about her? Why did she hide? </p><p>In all honesty, she didn&rsquo;t know. Ned and Mj accepted her when she had to stop pretending to be Peter. Mj had even given her makeup. If she was honest Aunt May probably figured it out. </p><p>Pandora did have underwear specifically used for tucking and some of the bras that went through the washer weren&rsquo;t May&rsquo;s size. May never brought it up and Pandora assumed that meant not to talk about it. She was fine with that. She was fine with hiding it from the Avengers, from school, from May. </p><p>She was fine with it, until she wasn&rsquo;t. </p><p>She wanted freedom, she wanted to be called Pandora, for people to look at her and use female pronouns. She more than wanted it, she was desperate for it. </p><p>Even after she had told May, after she had started showing up to school in Peter&rsquo;s place, there was one place where it couldn&rsquo;t happen. No matter how much she wanted to. </p><p>The thought of hiding it was illogical, really, May and her had gotten estrogen shots and seen a specialized therapist. It was on her medical records so there was a high chance Dr. Banner and Dr. Cho already knew. </p><p>There was even the chance that they&rsquo;d told Tony. How would Tony react to spiderman changing to a girl? Black Widow? Vision? Captain America himself? </p><p>What if they told her she couldn&rsquo;t be a superhero anymore? What if Tony took away her suit? She&rsquo;d have to go out in the homemade suit again and it ended so bad last time. Ned put a hand to his friend&rsquo;s face and brushed a lock of hair out of her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Pan?&rdquo; </p><p>Pandora startled at her nickname before sending her best friend a smile. &ldquo;Yeah, just thinking about&hellip; well&hellip; Spiderwoman.&rdquo; </p><p>Ned nodded. &ldquo;I understand that. It won&rsquo;t change who you are though, Pan. You&rsquo;re still going to be that selfless, no self-preservation, kid that sticks up for everyone else.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, except now you&rsquo;ll have tits,&rdquo; Flash said from in front of them. Ned and Pan scowled at the back of his seat. </p><p>&ldquo;Still gonna be a dork,&rdquo; Mj commented dryly from behind them. Pandora&rsquo;s eyes lit up with humor and she sent a mischievous glance at Ned. </p><p>&ldquo;Mj, I think you mean Pan-dork-a.&rdquo; </p><p>Ned barely got out the, &ldquo;Ba dum tss&rdquo; before laughing his eyes off. MJ didn&rsquo;t have a response and Pan assumed that meant she was laughing. Even Flash and Abe snorted at that. </p><p>That Saturday Pandora found herself walking into the tower and onto the private elevator. He waved hi to the staff that recognized him before the door slid shut. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Friday, penthouse please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Banner would like to see you in his office first, Ms. Parker.&rdquo; </p><p>Pandora froze. Ms. Ms. Not Mr., Of course, Karen had called him Pandora now and that information was sent to Friday. Of course, Friday would know, that didn&rsquo;t mean that Mr. Stark knew. Did it? She was his AI. </p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Parker? Ms. Parker? Pandora?&rdquo; The girl snapped out of her daze and looked up to where she knew Friday&rsquo;s speaker was. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Friday?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your heart rate is elevated, if you are concerned about your gender than let me assure you my instructions are to not call you female pronouns unless you are alone or with Dr. Banner. No other knows. Karen has told me it is imperative to your wellbeing to keep this a secret.&rdquo; </p><p>Pandora sagged at her words. &ldquo;Take me to doctor Banner then, Fri.&rdquo; The AI responded and they were off. </p><p>Bruce didn&rsquo;t tell Pandora off like she was expecting. Instead of insisting she stop her heroic behavior he had told her how to improve it for the new changes to her body. He also offered to research the surgery process and help her aunt and her go over it with someone they trusted in the medical field. </p><p>He also told her that Natasha knew. When Pandora looked like she was about to pee her pants Bruce laughed it off.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s kind of excited but she doesn&rsquo;t want to scare you off. She was talking about a girls night with you, her, Pepper, Clint&rsquo;s wife Laura, Wanda, and Dr. Helen. They normally go every few months and she was excited for you to go with Wanda since there&rsquo;ll be two teen girls now.&rdquo; </p><p>Pandora smiled at the thought. &ldquo;That would be cool. Maybe I could bring MJ too, her and Nat would probably get along really well.&rdquo; Pandora thought of all the qualities they shared and shivered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d definitely get along well.&rdquo; </p><p>Bruce chuckled, &ldquo;She sounds like quite the girl.&rdquo; Pandora laughed an nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is?&rdquo; Tony asked as he walked in. Pandora froze, no Peter froze. Tony was here she was Peter. She was spiderman. She was the man of spiders. MAN. </p><p>&ldquo;A friend of Peter&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Bruce said for her. Pandora looked at him in panic. She was gonna do it. She was going to say something. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay Pete?&rdquo; Tony asked. </p><p>Pandora looked up with wide eyes. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t call me that.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t have to look around to see Bruce give Tony the warning glance and Tony look at him, bewildered. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I always call you though, Kid?&rdquo; His voice was so confused and hurt that Pandora burst into tears. &ldquo;Oh shit, hey, no, Pe- Kid, come on, don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo; </p><p>Bruce was the one to walk over to Pandora and put a hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright Tony, it&rsquo;s best that she has time to let her emotions out.&rdquo; </p><p>Bruce had time to register what he said before Tony&rsquo;s monotone voice took over. &ldquo;She?&rdquo; </p><p>Pandora grabbed Bruce&rsquo;s hand, looked him in the eyes, and then she nodded. &ldquo;She.&rdquo; </p><p>The confirmation was all Tony needed. &ldquo;Fuck! Kid, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? There was so much I could&rsquo;ve done to make you more comfortable!&rdquo; </p><p>Pandora processed the anger first and flinched in on herself, then the words came through. She smiled at what he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not upset with me?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony looked at her in shock. &ldquo;Kid, why would I be upset with you?&rdquo; When Pandora didn&rsquo;t answer Tony&rsquo;s question he decided to continue. &ldquo;Kid, listen. Being transgender isn&rsquo;t bad, or a sin, or anything to be ashamed of.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What about&hellip; what about Spiderman.&rdquo; The emphasis on the word that Tony was beginning to hate told Tony all he needed to know. </p><p>&ldquo;Kid, no one gives two shits whether the person under the suit is a man or a woman or both or neither. Being a superhero isn&rsquo;t about your genitals or whether you identify with them or not. It&rsquo;s about being a good person and you have the biggest heart I have ever seen, so as long as you don&rsquo;t change that then we&rsquo;re good.&rdquo; </p><p>Pandora smiled and threw her arms around Tony and Bruce. The two men laughed as their new girl hugged them. </p><p>&ldquo;We love you, Kid. Don&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p>",

Spiderman becomes Spiderwoman. I\u2019ve seen a lot of FTM Spiderman but not a lot (if any) MTF spiderwoman. </i></b></p><p><span class=\"npf_color_joey\"><b><i>Note: this is also published on my Wattpad account: Banana_Bus_Girl. </i></b></span></p><p>Peter was proud to be Spiderman, he was happy when people called out to him, he enjoyed being a superhero. But the problem was, he didn\u2019t want to be a spider man, but a spider woman. Okay spider girl maybe, but the same still applies. </p><p>Peter didn\u2019t even want to be Peter anymore, he never had. He wanted to be Pandora Parker. He wanted to be a her. </p><p>She was confident and loved herself. She was still best friends with Ned, she still made lego sculptures, she still took science, and she was still a vigilante. So why was Pandora so scared to tell people about her? Why did she hide? </p><p>In all honesty, she didn\u2019t know. Ned and Mj accepted her when she had to stop pretending to be Peter. Mj had even given her makeup. If she was honest Aunt May probably figured it out. </p><p>Pandora did have underwear specifically used for tucking and some of the bras that went through the washer weren\u2019t May\u2019s size. May never brought it up and Pandora assumed that meant not to talk about it. She was fine with that. She was fine with hiding it from the Avengers, from school, from May. </p><p>She was fine with it, until she wasn\u2019t. </p><p>She wanted freedom, she wanted to be called Pandora, for people to look at her and use female pronouns. She more than wanted it, she was desperate for it. </p><p>Even after she had told May, after she had started showing up to school in Peter\u2019s place, there was one place where it couldn\u2019t happen. No matter how much she wanted to. </p><p>The thought of hiding it was illogical, really, May and her had gotten estrogen shots and seen a specialized therapist. It was on her medical records so there was a high chance Dr. Banner and Dr. Cho already knew. </p><p>There was even the chance that they\u2019d told Tony. How would Tony react to spiderman changing to a girl? Black Widow? Vision? Captain America himself? </p><p>What if they told her she couldn\u2019t be a superhero anymore? What if Tony took away her suit? She\u2019d have to go out in the homemade suit again and it ended so bad last time. Ned put a hand to his friend\u2019s face and brushed a lock of hair out of her eyes. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Pan?\u201d </p><p>Pandora startled at her nickname before sending her best friend a smile. \u201cYeah, just thinking about\u2026 well\u2026 Spiderwoman.\u201d </p><p>Ned nodded. \u201cI understand that. It won\u2019t change who you are though, Pan. You\u2019re still going to be that selfless, no self-preservation, kid that sticks up for everyone else.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, except now you\u2019ll have tits,\u201d Flash said from in front of them. Ned and Pan scowled at the back of his seat. </p><p>\u201cStill gonna be a dork,\u201d Mj commented dryly from behind them. Pandora\u2019s eyes lit up with humor and she sent a mischievous glance at Ned. </p><p>\u201cMj, I think you mean Pan-dork-a.\u201d </p><p>Ned barely got out the, \u201cBa dum tss\u201d before laughing his eyes off. MJ didn\u2019t have a response and Pan assumed that meant she was laughing. Even Flash and Abe snorted at that. </p><p>That Saturday Pandora found herself walking into the tower and onto the private elevator. He waved hi to the staff that recognized him before the door slid shut. </p><p>\u201cHey Friday, penthouse please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDr. Banner would like to see you in his office first, Ms. Parker.\u201d </p><p>Pandora froze. Ms. Ms. Not Mr., Of course, Karen had called him Pandora now and that information was sent to Friday. Of course, Friday would know, that didn\u2019t mean that Mr. Stark knew. Did it? She was his AI. </p><p>\u201cMs. Parker? Ms. Parker? Pandora?\u201d The girl snapped out of her daze and looked up to where she knew Friday\u2019s speaker was. </p><p>\u201cYeah, Friday?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour heart rate is elevated, if you are concerned about your gender than let me assure you my instructions are to not call you female pronouns unless you are alone or with Dr. Banner. No other knows. Karen has told me it is imperative to your wellbeing to keep this a secret.\u201d </p><p>Pandora sagged at her words. \u201cTake me to doctor Banner then, Fri.\u201d The AI responded and they were off. </p><p>Bruce didn\u2019t tell Pandora off like she was expecting. Instead of insisting she stop her heroic behavior he had told her how to improve it for the new changes to her body. He also offered to research the surgery process and help her aunt and her go over it with someone they trusted in the medical field. </p><p>He also told her that Natasha knew. When Pandora looked like she was about to pee her pants Bruce laughed it off.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s kind of excited but she doesn\u2019t want to scare you off. She was talking about a girls night with you, her, Pepper, Clint\u2019s wife Laura, Wanda, and Dr. Helen. They normally go every few months and she was excited for you to go with Wanda since there\u2019ll be two teen girls now.\u201d </p><p>Pandora smiled at the thought. \u201cThat would be cool. Maybe I could bring MJ too, her and Nat would probably get along really well.\u201d Pandora thought of all the qualities they shared and shivered. \u201cThey\u2019d definitely get along well.\u201d </p><p>Bruce chuckled, \u201cShe sounds like quite the girl.\u201d Pandora laughed an nodded.</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d Tony asked as he walked in. Pandora froze, no Peter froze. Tony was here she was Peter. She was spiderman. She was the man of spiders. MAN. </p><p>\u201cA friend of Peter\u2019s,\u201d Bruce said for her. Pandora looked at him in panic. She was gonna do it. She was going to say something. </p><p>\u201cYou okay Pete?\u201d Tony asked. </p><p>Pandora looked up with wide eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call me that.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to look around to see Bruce give Tony the warning glance and Tony look at him, bewildered. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I always call you though, Kid?\u201d His voice was so confused and hurt that Pandora burst into tears. \u201cOh shit, hey, no, Pe- Kid, come on, don\u2019t cry.\u201d </p><p>Bruce was the one to walk over to Pandora and put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s alright Tony, it\u2019s best that she has time to let her emotions out.\u201d </p><p>Bruce had time to register what he said before Tony\u2019s monotone voice took over. \u201cShe?\u201d </p><p>Pandora grabbed Bruce\u2019s hand, looked him in the eyes, and then she nodded. \u201cShe.\u201d </p><p>The confirmation was all Tony needed. \u201cFuck! Kid, why didn\u2019t you tell me? There was so much I could\u2019ve done to make you more comfortable!\u201d </p><p>Pandora processed the anger first and flinched in on herself, then the words came through. She smiled at what he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not upset with me?\u201d </p><p>Tony looked at her in shock. \u201cKid, why would I be upset with you?\u201d When Pandora didn\u2019t answer Tony\u2019s question he decided to continue. \u201cKid, listen. Being transgender isn\u2019t bad, or a sin, or anything to be ashamed of.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat about\u2026 what about Spiderman.\u201d The emphasis on the word that Tony was beginning to hate told Tony all he needed to know. </p><p>\u201cKid, no one gives two shits whether the person under the suit is a man or a woman or both or neither. Being a superhero isn\u2019t about your genitals or whether you identify with them or not. It\u2019s about being a good person and you have the biggest heart I have ever seen, so as long as you don\u2019t change that then we\u2019re good.\u201d </p><p>Pandora smiled and threw her arms around Tony and Bruce. The two men laughed as their new girl hugged them. </p><p>\u201cWe love you, Kid. Don\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p>",
