His mind was racing over everything that had taken place. Dan was little again after stressing himself too much about telling everyone he was a little, that much he knew. He\u2019d had a five-hour nap, Phil cuddling him the entire time. Nurses kept coming in, asking for updates. The answer was always the same: <i><b>\u201cHe\u2019s still sleeping.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</b></i> his mother asked, letting herself in through the door. He\u2019d given them the spare key so they\u2019d be able to get in whenever they needed. Phil had also called them in the car, telling them there was an emergency regarding Dan\u2014he hadn\u2019t known what was happening at the time.</p><p><b><i>\u201cHe slipped into little space. He was panicking \u2018cause I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cIs he okay now?\u201d</b></i> Phil\u2019s dad asked, taking a seat on the mildly comfortable sofa in the room.</p><p><i><b>\u201cAs good as he can be. He didn\u2019t want me to leave, but I had too.\u201d </b></i>Before either of his parents could continue the conversation, there was a knock at the door.</p><p>Assuming it was room service or something similar, he pulled open the door, a \u2018hello\u2019 in his lips. He never actually spoke though, stood completely still as two police officers jumped on him, cuffing his hands behind his back nearly as soon as his body hit the ground.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat on Earth is going on here?\u201d </b></i>his mother screamed, demanding answers as to why her son was lying on the ground, a police officer\u2019s knee pressed into his back.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>We need to bring Mr. Lester back to the station. We\u2019ve been given intel that he may be involved in Mr. Howell\u2019s kidnapping,\u201d t</b></i>he officer explained. \u201c<b><i>You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in court.\u201d</i></b> The officer said before roughly pulling Phil to his feet.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAre you bloody kidding me?!\u201d </i></b>his mother shouted, and for her to swear was a very rare occurrence. She must have really been pissed<i><b>. \u201cMy son loves Dan and would never do anything to hurt him. Who the fuck said he\u2019s involved?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThat is none of your concern, mam&rsquo;.\u201d</i></b> the officer said in reply. Passing Phil off to his partner and turning back to them.<b><i> \u201cIf this goes to court, you may speak for your son.\u201d</i></b></p><p>With that, the officers pulled Phil from the hotel, the man unhappily agreeing. He saw absolutely no point in fighting them even knowing he was innocent. Besides, he believed quite strongly that things would work out. Dan could testify explaining what happened when he was big again. Everything would be fine.</p><p>Phil was roughly shoved in the back of the police car. He panicked as he realized there was no seatbelt, but the officers didn\u2019t seem to care, judging by how they were treating him. He supposed he understood; I mean, you\u2019d get fed up with criminals pretty quickly. The only thing was that Phil was completely innocent. Well, as innocent as someone who carved words into his boyfriend could be. He hadn\u2019t had control at the time, his limbs moving completely without his will as Sir carved words into his boyfriend\u2019s stomach, Phil continuously telling him how good he was as he did so. He didn\u2019t want Dan thinking he was naughty when he was the best little in the world.</p><p>As Phil tumbled to the other side of the small cabin as the car turned, he suddenly realized what had happened back at the hospital. Phil had said \u201cgood boy.\u201d He realized Dan must associate those words with the pain of the blade carving into his skin and in his little mind, he didn\u2019t understand that Phil never did it of his own free will. Was that the intel they had spoken about?</p><p><i><b>\u201cOut you get,\u201d</b></i> the officer grumbled, grabbing Phil\u2019s arm and pulling him from the car. They pushed him inside the station, shoving him into one of the holding cells and locking the door behind him. <i><b>\u201cSomeone\u2019ll come to get your statement soon.\u201d</b></i> Phil\u2019s hands were uncuffed from between the bars and he rubbed his wrists, the metal having cut into them.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p><i><b>\u201cDanny, how are you feeling?\u201d </b></i>Eric asked, trying his best to act as if he was talking to a child. It was weird since Dan stilled looked like an adult\u2014he was an adult.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI want my daddy,\u201d</b></i> he mumbled around the thumb in his mouth. Remembering how Phil had treated Dan, he pulled it gently from his mouth, ignoring Dan\u2019s whine as he pushed a pacifier between his lips. He wasn\u2019t used to looking after kids, he himself being the baby of the family.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYour Daddy can\u2019t be here at the moment. But pooh-bear can look after you, can\u2019t they?\u201d</i></b> he asked, Kate, having told him not to refer to the teddy with \u2018he/him\u2019 pronouns. He didn\u2019t question it, assuming Dan would explain when he was bigger. For now, he maintained a caring nature as he looked after Dan as best he could. The nurses were trying their best too, but little Dan remembered him and Kate as his friends and had taken to them for support and love.</p><p>At first, Eric had refused, stating that Dan needed to just \u201cgrow up\u201d and \u201cact his age.\u201d He\u2019s learned pretty quickly though that raising his voice only forced Dan more into his little space, and after Lela had yelled at him and explained what was happening, he understood Dan had no control over his emotional state.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDanny, can you come with me, please?\u201d</i></b> Lela asked, standing in the doorway. It was time for his appointment and even though he was little, he still needed to have them.</p><p><b><i>\u201cOkay, Mummy!\u201d </i></b>he shouted, getting up from the bed and waddling over to her. Dan had clearly taken to calling her mummy and she just let him. If that made him feel safer than so be it. It wasn\u2019t hurting anyone.</p><p><i><b>\u201cSo, how have you been going?\u201d s</b></i>he asked, closing the door behind them as Dan ran straight to the toys in the room.</p><p><b><i>\u201cGood, mummy. When\u2019s daddy coming back?\u201d </i></b>he asked, pulling the lego box from the tub of toys.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI was hoping you could tell me about that day you and daddy went to the park?\u201d</i></b> she asked carefully, avoiding Dan\u2019s question. The station had called back, telling her Phil was in custody.</p><p>Dan looked up from his toys, confused as he\u2019d never been asked directly before. It was always carefully phrased questions to avoid possibly triggering him. He didn\u2019t really care though\u2014he had legos to play with.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSir said he had a puppy, he\u2019s Daddy\u2019s friend and daddy said we could get a puppy,\u201d </i></b>Dan explained simply.</p><p><b><i>\u201cHasn\u2019t your daddy ever told you not to go with strangers?\u201d</i></b> she continued.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a good daddy,\u201d </b></i>he mumbled to himself, seemingly remembering something. <i><b>&ldquo;Hey! Where\u2019s my daddy!?\u201d</b></i> he shouted, tears starting to collect in his eyes.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Danny. Your daddy can\u2019t be here right now,\u201d </i></b>she explained cautiously.</p><p><b><i>\u201cBut- but Daddy\u2019s always here when Pooh-Bear isn\u2019t! You- you\u2019re a bad mummy!\u201d</i></b> he shouted, running from the room.</p><p>Nurses found Dan in an abandoned corridor an hour later, tear stains on his flushed cheeks as he mumbled \u2018daddy\u2019 in his sleep.</p>",

His mind was racing over everything that had taken place. Dan was little again after stressing himself too much about telling everyone he was a little, that much he knew. He\u2019d had a five-hour nap, Phil cuddling him the entire time. Nurses kept coming in, asking for updates.

He supposed he understood; I mean, you\u2019d get fed up with criminals pretty quickly. The only thing was that Phil was completely innocent. Well, as innocent as someone who carved words into his boyfriend could be. He hadn\u2019t had control at the time, his limbs moving completely without his will as Sir carved words into his boyfriend\u2019s stomach, Phil continuously telling him how good he was as he did so.

His mind was racing over everything that had taken place. Dan was little again after stressing himself too much about telling everyone he was a little, that much he knew. He&rsquo;d had a five-hour nap, Phil cuddling him the entire time. Nurses kept coming in, asking for updates. The answer was always the same: <i><b>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still sleeping.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</b></i> his mother asked, letting herself in through the door. He&rsquo;d given them the spare key so they&rsquo;d be able to get in whenever they needed. Phil had also called them in the car, telling them there was an emergency regarding Dan&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t known what was happening at the time.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;He slipped into little space. He was panicking &lsquo;cause I wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Is he okay now?&rdquo;</b></i> Phil&rsquo;s dad asked, taking a seat on the mildly comfortable sofa in the room.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;As good as he can be. He didn&rsquo;t want me to leave, but I had too.&rdquo; </b></i>Before either of his parents could continue the conversation, there was a knock at the door.</p><p>Assuming it was room service or something similar, he pulled open the door, a &lsquo;hello&rsquo; in his lips. He never actually spoke though, stood completely still as two police officers jumped on him, cuffing his hands behind his back nearly as soon as his body hit the ground.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What on Earth is going on here?&rdquo; </b></i>his mother screamed, demanding answers as to why her son was lying on the ground, a police officer&rsquo;s knee pressed into his back.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>We need to bring Mr. Lester back to the station. We&rsquo;ve been given intel that he may be involved in Mr. Howell&rsquo;s kidnapping,&rdquo; t</b></i>he officer explained. &ldquo;<b><i>You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in court.&rdquo;</i></b> The officer said before roughly pulling Phil to his feet.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Are you bloody kidding me?!&rdquo; </i></b>his mother shouted, and for her to swear was a very rare occurrence. She must have really been pissed<i><b>. &ldquo;My son loves Dan and would never do anything to hurt him. Who the fuck said he&rsquo;s involved?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;That is none of your concern, mam&rsquo;.&rdquo;</i></b> the officer said in reply. Passing Phil off to his partner and turning back to them.<b><i> &ldquo;If this goes to court, you may speak for your son.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>With that, the officers pulled Phil from the hotel, the man unhappily agreeing. He saw absolutely no point in fighting them even knowing he was innocent. Besides, he believed quite strongly that things would work out. Dan could testify explaining what happened when he was big again. Everything would be fine.</p><p>Phil was roughly shoved in the back of the police car. He panicked as he realized there was no seatbelt, but the officers didn&rsquo;t seem to care, judging by how they were treating him. He supposed he understood; I mean, you&rsquo;d get fed up with criminals pretty quickly. The only thing was that Phil was completely innocent. Well, as innocent as someone who carved words into his boyfriend could be. He hadn&rsquo;t had control at the time, his limbs moving completely without his will as Sir carved words into his boyfriend&rsquo;s stomach, Phil continuously telling him how good he was as he did so. He didn&rsquo;t want Dan thinking he was naughty when he was the best little in the world.</p><p>As Phil tumbled to the other side of the small cabin as the car turned, he suddenly realized what had happened back at the hospital. Phil had said &ldquo;good boy.&rdquo; He realized Dan must associate those words with the pain of the blade carving into his skin and in his little mind, he didn&rsquo;t understand that Phil never did it of his own free will. Was that the intel they had spoken about?</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Out you get,&rdquo;</b></i> the officer grumbled, grabbing Phil&rsquo;s arm and pulling him from the car. They pushed him inside the station, shoving him into one of the holding cells and locking the door behind him. <i><b>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;ll come to get your statement soon.&rdquo;</b></i> Phil&rsquo;s hands were uncuffed from between the bars and he rubbed his wrists, the metal having cut into them.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Danny, how are you feeling?&rdquo; </b></i>Eric asked, trying his best to act as if he was talking to a child. It was weird since Dan stilled looked like an adult&mdash;he was an adult.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I want my daddy,&rdquo;</b></i> he mumbled around the thumb in his mouth. Remembering how Phil had treated Dan, he pulled it gently from his mouth, ignoring Dan&rsquo;s whine as he pushed a pacifier between his lips. He wasn&rsquo;t used to looking after kids, he himself being the baby of the family.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Your Daddy can&rsquo;t be here at the moment. But pooh-bear can look after you, can&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</i></b> he asked, Kate, having told him not to refer to the teddy with &lsquo;he/him&rsquo; pronouns. He didn&rsquo;t question it, assuming Dan would explain when he was bigger. For now, he maintained a caring nature as he looked after Dan as best he could. The nurses were trying their best too, but little Dan remembered him and Kate as his friends and had taken to them for support and love.</p><p>At first, Eric had refused, stating that Dan needed to just &ldquo;grow up&rdquo; and &ldquo;act his age.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s learned pretty quickly though that raising his voice only forced Dan more into his little space, and after Lela had yelled at him and explained what was happening, he understood Dan had no control over his emotional state.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Danny, can you come with me, please?&rdquo;</i></b> Lela asked, standing in the doorway. It was time for his appointment and even though he was little, he still needed to have them.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Okay, Mummy!&rdquo; </i></b>he shouted, getting up from the bed and waddling over to her. Dan had clearly taken to calling her mummy and she just let him. If that made him feel safer than so be it. It wasn&rsquo;t hurting anyone.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;So, how have you been going?&rdquo; s</b></i>he asked, closing the door behind them as Dan ran straight to the toys in the room.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Good, mummy. When&rsquo;s daddy coming back?&rdquo; </i></b>he asked, pulling the lego box from the tub of toys.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I was hoping you could tell me about that day you and daddy went to the park?&rdquo;</i></b> she asked carefully, avoiding Dan&rsquo;s question. The station had called back, telling her Phil was in custody.</p><p>Dan looked up from his toys, confused as he&rsquo;d never been asked directly before. It was always carefully phrased questions to avoid possibly triggering him. He didn&rsquo;t really care though&mdash;he had legos to play with.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Sir said he had a puppy, he&rsquo;s Daddy&rsquo;s friend and daddy said we could get a puppy,&rdquo; </i></b>Dan explained simply.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t your daddy ever told you not to go with strangers?&rdquo;</i></b> she continued.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s a good daddy,&rdquo; </b></i>he mumbled to himself, seemingly remembering something. <i><b>&ldquo;Hey! Where&rsquo;s my daddy!?&rdquo;</b></i> he shouted, tears starting to collect in his eyes.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Danny. Your daddy can&rsquo;t be here right now,&rdquo; </i></b>she explained cautiously.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;But- but Daddy&rsquo;s always here when Pooh-Bear isn&rsquo;t! You- you&rsquo;re a bad mummy!&rdquo;</i></b> he shouted, running from the room.</p><p>Nurses found Dan in an abandoned corridor an hour later, tear stains on his flushed cheeks as he mumbled &lsquo;daddy&rsquo; in his sleep.</p>",
