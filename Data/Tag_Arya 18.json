        "answer": "<p>I get where you\u2019re coming from, Anon, and I agree to some extent. However, the only POV that really feels <i>way</i> too old to me is Bran\u2019s. GRRM has said that he has trouble with Bran\u2019s POV the most because it\u2019s hard to write from the mind of someone that young, and yeah, it shows in his writing sometimes. Even with Bran, though, there are plenty of times when Bran sounds age appropriate (Like \u201cWhy would anyone kill Jory?\u201d or\u00a0\u201cHe sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them.\u201d)</p><p>But, you asked for examples, so here\u2019s my thoughts on it:</p><p>Jon\u2019s POV is age appropriate, to an extent. At the start of his story, he\u2019s an angsty, bratty teen with a good heart, and reads like it, for the most part.<br/></p><p>I think Sansa and Arya start off acting their age, for sure. Sansa\u2019s romanticism in the beginning of her arc is age appropriate, and written accordingly. I love that Arya calls everything and everyone \u201cstupid,\u201d and Sansa refers to her stomach as her \u201ctummy.\u201d Language like that definitely shows their age. Also, Sansa and Arya\u2019s sisterly beef with each other is written perfectly, considering their ages.</p><p>However, after Sansa goes through her trauma and has grown accustomed to being a prisoner, her POV matures in a way that, while fascinating to read, still feels a bit too\u00a0\u201cold\u201d sometimes in my opinion, if that makes sense. Like, she\u2019s just 13, but she tends to sound like someone in their later teens, and though that doesn\u2019t sound like a huge difference, the mind of someone who\u2019s 17-19 is far different from someone who just turned 13. I get why GRRM would do that, because trauma can definitely age a child, and it\u2019s beautiful writing, but I think sometimes it\u2019s just too old in how it reads. IIRC, though (correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m not a Sansa expert), she still calls her stomach her\u00a0\u201ctummy,\u201d so there\u2019s that. That word is associated with youth and innocence, so when Sansa starts saying\u00a0\u201cstomach\u201d or\u00a0\u201cbelly\u201d more than\u00a0\u201ctummy\u201d &hellip; I think it\u2019ll be kinda sad, because it will represent more of her lost/stolen innocence, due to her trauma.</p><p>I think George does a better job with making Arya still sound childish, even after she\u2019s traumatized. The way she thinks of her lost identity (\u201chad she dreamed Arya Stark?\u201d) gets the job done as far as storytelling and characterization goes, while saying it in a\u00a0\u201cchildish\u201d way.</p><p>Dany\u2019s POV is weird. Sometimes she sounds young \u2014 maybe not as young as 13, but considering her backstory, she\u2019s been forced to grow up long before the Stark children, so that makes sense. I think if her story started when she was 15 instead of 13, it would sound more\u00a0\u201cright,\u201d but honestly, with the whole dramatically written crush over Daario and the mistakes she makes as a ruler, I think you can tell that she\u2019s a teenager.</p><p>I think Theon\u2019s POV is age appropriate. He\u2019s college age, and acts like a particularly douchey frat boy. And when the Reek thing happens, he\u2019s old enough that the change in prose doesn\u2019t sound awkward. It\u2019s all written perfectly.</p><p>Also, if non-POV characters count, Tommen and Sweetrobin act pretty age appropriate. Myrcella feels like an intelligent child. I don\u2019t know, I think GRRM does a good job on this for the most part.\u00a0</p>",
