She made her way to the\nkitchen and placed the pizzas on the counter before making her way up the\nstairs to use the bathroom in Harry\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201c - I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just - she\u2019s clingy, ya know,\u201d Y/N stopped\ndead on her tracks as she heard her boyfriend talk negatively about someone.\nFor some reason, she felt like he was talking about her, but he couldn\u2019t talk\nabout her like that, could he?</p><p>As curiosity got the best of her, instead of going inside she stood outside,\neavesdropping. She knew it wasn\u2019t the best idea, but she felt like she had to\nknow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always holding my hand when we are outside, wearing my clothes,\nsleeping over every day, it\u2019s just annoying, I feel suffocated!\u201d Y/N by\nthen was quite sure, he was talking about her. Y/N did all of those things but\nshe didn\u2019t know she was being annoying or suffocating him.</p><p>She held hands with him whenever they were on street; it wasn\u2019t especially\nbecause he was her boyfriend but because it was her habit. She held hands with\nher brother, her sister, her cousins her best friend or whoever she was with\n(as long as they didn\u2019t have a bad relation) and whenever they were walking on\nstreets, it was just her habit. She definitely felt it was weird, but no one\never complained until Harry.</p><p>She did wear his clothes, but it was recently. It was just her way to show\nhim she loved him and it was her way to miss him a little less.</p><p>She was sleeping over, it was just because she knew he would be leaving in\nfew days and she won\u2019t be seeing him in another few weeks. She was just trying\nto make the best out of the time they had, for them.</p><p>Apparently Harry didn\u2019t like it. It was annoying for him; suffocating even.\nIt broke Y/N\u2019s heart, that Harry felt about her like that and it hurt her more\nthat instead of telling it to her he was telling it to one of his friends.\nHowever, Y/N still trusted him; she still believed he won\u2019t talk about her like\nthat behind her back; he could have been talking about anyone.</p><p>It was like; Harry read her thoughts as he replied in his phone. \u201cNo,\nY/N doesn\u2019t want attention or anything she\u2019s just clingy, anyway talk to later,\nshe\u2019s downstairs would come up if I take too long,\u201d Harry hung up\nlaughing.</p><p>Y/N quickly went in the bathroom she never used across Harry\u2019s room before\nhe could see her. She heard Harry\u2019s footsteps fade downstairs when she looked\nat the mirror over the sink.</p><p>Maybe she <i>was</i> clingy. Hell she knew she was clingy, she had known\nthat all her life, but she never thought it bothered him. Here was the thing\nabout Y/N, she either didn\u2019t care about her partners or she cared too much. And\nif she cared too much she could literally give her life to that person.\nHowever, that didn\u2019t happen much, she only had one relationship like that\nbefore (which ended up in a disaster) and Harry was the second person who ever\nmade her feel that way. Even though Harry was the second person Y/N never felt\nlike that for anyone. What that guy made her feel was nothing compared to what\nHarry made her feel. Y/N loved him more than anything.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes swelled up with tears as she kept looking at her reflection in\nthe mirror.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t cry,\u201d she whispered to herself as she rubbed her eyes\nmaking sure she didn\u2019t smudge the mascara she had applied in the morning.</p><p>\u201cThis is stupid, you are clingy,\u201d Y/N told herself. \u201cGive him\nsome space; of course you wouldn\u2019t like it either if he breathed down your neck\nlike you did.\u201d Y/N breathed steadily as she tried to calm herself down.</p><p>\u201cY/N, where are you?\u201d Harry yelled from downstairs making Y/N jolt\nand look at the door\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cCo- coming,\u201d Y/N broke, but she quickly recovered. She hastily\nlooked at herself in the mirror, to make sure there was no trace of tears or\nsadness in her face, she smiled to herself before making her way out of the\nbathroom to find a breathless Harry jog upstairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, just in the bathroom,\u201d Y/N pointed to her left at the white\nwooden door.</p><p>\u201cBut you never used it,\u201d Harry furrowed his brows.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that is why I decided to use it, I mean every bathroom wants to\nbe used\u2026.like dustbins, \u2018use me\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled at Y/N\u2019s joke. \u201cC'mere, you\u201d Harry wrapped his arms\naround Y/N\u2019s shoulder as he gave her temples quick kiss in the process.\n\u201cHow was uni?\u201d He asked as he guided her downstairs.</p><p>\u201cIt was good, I guess,\u201d Y/N replied trying to act as normal as\npossible. But, she was confused really, Harry acted like nothing happened- like\nhe didn\u2019t just complain how clingy she was a minute ago, like he didn\u2019t say she\nsuffocated him.</p><p>It had her thinking if Harry had done that before - acted &lsquo;normal\u2019 just\nafter insulting her to his friends. This made Y/N scoot away from him\nautomatically. Y/N was angry and sad the same time. Harry didn\u2019t have the right\nto talk about their problems to other, but maybe he just didn\u2019t want to hurt\nher feelings.</p><p>That moment she decided that she was going to give Harry what he wanted. She\nwas going to give him some space.</p><p>\u201cHey, earth to Y/N,\u201d Harry suddenly said with a chuckle. Y/N\nrealized they were already in the kitchen and Harry was saying something to\nher.</p><p>\u201cUm, sorry, what were you saying?\u201d Y/N asked.</p><p>\u201cI was saying, what film would you want to watch tonight?\u201d Harry\nasked. \u201cI was thinking of 'Despicable Me 3\u2019, I haven\u2019t watched that\nyet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh uh,\u201d Y/N stopped, she was going to give him space, she\ncouldn\u2019t just sleep over again, after she knew it bothered him. \u201cSorry\nHarry, can\u2019t stay tonight, I have this exam tomorrow I have to study for, I\njust came by to drop the pizzas and meet you for while,\u201d Y/N lied smiling\nsadly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d surprisingly Harry looked disappointed. \u201cYou can study\nhere, ya know, I won\u2019t disturb ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have all the books, I should be going home now,\u201d Y/N\nhurriedly looked at her watch in her wrist. \u201cProbably won\u2019t be able to\nfinish the chapters, if I don\u2019t.\u201d Y/N quickly gave a peck on Harry\u2019s cheek\nas she went towards the couch where her bag was.</p><p>\u201cAt least eat,\u201d Harry exclaimed catching up behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll grab something on my way, bye,\u201d Y/N shut the door behind\nher before Harry could say anything else.</p><p>She will do everything to give him what he wanted, even if she had to stay\naway from him.</p><p>____</p><p>It had been two weeks, two weeks since Y/N kissed him, two weeks since Y/N\nwent to his house, two weeks since she was distant from him. It was absolutely\nkilling her. Many times she had the urge to call him and just talk, like she\nused to but she stopped herself every time - it was for the best, she told\nherself.</p><p>Y/N typed away furiously on her laptop\u2019s keyboard. She had been working\nnon-stop just to keep her distracted and to get some work done on the process.\nY/N was working on one of her university projects, which wasn\u2019t due 'till next\nmonth, but she was certain to finish it that very day and submit it by the next\nday.</p><p>Y/N was writing the conclusion when her phone rang. It was Harry. At first\nshe thought of not picking it up, but she decided to pick up and listen what he\nwanted say, maybe lie if needed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Y/N muttered while pressing her phone on her ear.</p><p>\u201cHey, kitten, how are you? You sound tired,\u201d Harry cooed through\nthe other line.</p><p>\u201cBecause, I am,\u201d she replied. \u201cWorking on this project for\nuni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, catch a break, come over or I can come over if you want,\u201d\nHarry offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I need to finish it by today, later I also have a shift at the\ncafe, so I\u2019m busy, maybe tomorrow?\u201d Y/N lied - neither she had a shift at\nthe cafe nor she had to finish her project by that day. It was just her way to\nescape from him.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot,\u201d Harry said, Y/N could say by his voice he was hurt,\nvery hurt but -that was what he wanted, right? Some time for himself, away from\nher who was annoying and was suffocating him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Italy for two week tomorrow, remember?\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh yeah, yeah! I remember,\u201d sudden realization hit Y/N, she\nhad totally forgotten, she thought he was supposed to go to Italy the next\nweek. But, it made everything easier for her; she didn\u2019t have to lie to him\nthat much anymore, she hated that. \u201cWell, that\u2019s great isn\u2019t it, you were\nreally excited about it!\u201d Y/N exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry replied half-heartedly. \u201cSo, I just wanted to\nmeet you, 'cause I won\u2019t be able - for two weeks, in fact I haven\u2019t really met\nyou in past two weeks!\u201d Harry exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cHarry I\u2019m busy, talk to you later and we can obviously meet after you\ncome back,\u201d Y/N hung up. It hurt Y/N so - so much, but she obviously\ncouldn\u2019t go and meet him, not after what she heard.</p><p>After finishing her project Y/N decided to Netflix and chill, just so she\ncould get rid of the panging sadness in her stomach and try to actually relax\nfor a while, which she couldn\u2019t do for past 15 days.</p><p>Y/N took out her Vanilla ice cream box from the freeze along with a glass of\nwine before settling herself on the couch with a blanket and pillows around\nher. It reminded her life before meeting Harry, it was all she did when she\ndidn\u2019t have uni or work or just wanted to be lazy.</p><p>Y/N was in the middle of rewatching \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 season 2 when there\nwas a ring on the bell before she heard the door click open. Y/N\u2019s head whipped\ntowards the door as she could feel her heart beat out of her chest. Y/N thought\nit was a robber or a thief. Even though she knew no idiot of a robber or thief\nwould enter through the front door and obviously wouldn\u2019t ring a bell. But, her\ncommon sense didn\u2019t work, she paused the TV, got on her feet and took her wine bottle\nas a shield as she clutched on her blanket. Y/N anxiously waited to see who it\nwas behind the door. She was about scream, but then she saw who it was. It was\nhim.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes scanned Y/N\u2019s small but very cozy and well decorated house\nbefore his eyes landed on her. He was quite confused seeing Y/N in that\nposition but before he could question it, she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me to death Harry!! I thought it was some robber came to\nrob me and then kill me!\u201d Y/N flopped down on the couch as she heaved\nputting her hand over her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh c'mon, no robber would enter after ringing the bell,\u201d Harry\nsaid monotonously, he had more important thing in his mind. \u201cBesides,\nweren\u2019t you supposed to be at work?\u201d He asked as he sat at the small sofa\nplaced next to the couch.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s head shot up at him, as she could literally feel her face heat up. She\nwas caught lying, but she couldn\u2019t let it happen - so she said some more lies.\n\u201cI called in, I was really tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, I went to the cafe to pick you up, but Sofia told me you\ndidn\u2019t have a shift,\u201d Harry said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI - I -\u201d Y/N stuttered. She should have known, he picked her up\nfrom work every now and then, she should have thought something better.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me now, why have you been avoiding me?\u201d Harry said\nlooking intensely at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cWell, wasn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d Y/N breathed out, giving up.\nShe couldn\u2019t do it anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harry asked his eyebrows furrowed - clearly\nconfused.</p><p>\u201cThe other day, I heard you talking to someone, you said I was clingy\nand annoying and was suffocation you,\u201d Y/N said timidly looking down at\nher lap. \u201cAnd, I just didn\u2019t want to be those things, so I thought of\ngiving you some space.\u201d</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t say anything at first, then realization hit him like a truck as\nhe remembered the exact conversation he had with Jeff few weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cI promise I didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop, I just got curious and I\ncouldn\u2019t stop myself,\u201d Y/N finally looked up revealing her glossy eyes to\nHarry. It broke his heart seeing her like that, but his heart was shattered\ninto million pieces knowing it was his fault.</p><p>\u201cOh baby,\u201d Harry was quick to kneel down in front of her and grab\nboth of her knees. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry; I don\u2019t know why I said it. I guess I\nwas just not used to having you around me after being away from you for so\nlong.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBesides, after getting space from you, I really don\u2019t want it ever in my\nlife!\u201d He added after a while.</p><p>It made a small smile tug on Y/N\u2019s pouty lips and Harry understood he was\nforgiven. Harry got up and sat next to Y/N and hugged her tightly.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me next time if you feel anything like that,\u201d Y/N said,\nbut her voice was muffled as her face was pressed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely love,\u201d Harry whispered kissing her forehead before\nlooking down at her smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, you\u2019re coming with me to Italy, I have the ticket and it\u2019s\nfor two weeks so you can clearly take a small leave from uni too,\u201d Harry\nstated as he turned to the TV while casually resting his arm over his shoulder\nand pressed the play button on the remote after finding it behind his butt.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Y/N asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming to Italy with me, oh you need to pack your bag too, I\u2019ll\nhelp you after finish watching this episode,\u201d he said nonchalantly\nfocusing on the series, Y/N had once forced him to watch and with which he\nabsolutely fell in love with.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I have uni! I can\u2019t just go to Italy like that!\u201d Y/N\nexclaimed.</p><p>\u201cOh c'mon, I just told you it\u2019s for two weeks, you can definitely take\nsome days off, if not tell them you\u2019re sick!\u201d Harry said still not peeling\nhis eyes of the television screen. \u201cI just can\u2019t bear to stay another two weeks\naway from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBu-\u201d Y/N tried to reason again but was cut off by Harry.</p><p>\u201cNo 'buts\u2019 you\u2019re coming,\u201d Harry said as he bought Y/N closure to\nhim, so she could rest her head on his chest. At first she just sat straight\nthinking but after a while she nuzzled her head in his chest wrapping a hand\naround his waist and again paying attention to the series.</p><p>Harry kissed the top of her head, he knew that meant yes.</p>",

She hastily\nlooked at herself in the mirror, to make sure there was no trace of tears or\nsadness in her face, she smiled to herself before making her way out of the\nbathroom to find a breathless Harry jog upstairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, just in the bathroom,\u201d Y/N pointed to her left at the white\nwooden door.</p><p>\u201cBut you never used it,\u201d Harry furrowed his brows.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that is why I decided to use it, I mean every bathroom wants to\nbe used\u2026.like dustbins, \u2018use me\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled at Y/N\u2019s joke. \u201cC'mere, you\u201d Harry wrapped his arms\naround Y/N\u2019s shoulder as he gave her temples quick kiss in the process.\n\u201cHow was uni?\u201d He asked as he guided her downstairs.</p><p>\u201cIt was good, I guess,\u201d Y/N replied trying to act as normal as\npossible. But, she was confused really, Harry acted like nothing happened- like\nhe didn\u2019t just complain how clingy she was a minute ago, like he didn\u2019t say she\nsuffocated him.</p><p>It had her thinking if Harry had done that before - acted \u2018normal\u2019 just\nafter insulting her to his friends. This made Y/N scoot away from him\nautomatically. Y/N was angry and sad the same time. Harry didn\u2019t have the right\nto talk about their problems to other, but maybe he just didn\u2019t want to hurt\nher feelings.</p><p>That moment she decided that she was going to give Harry what he wanted. She\nwas going to give him some space.</p><p>\u201cHey, earth to Y/N,\u201d Harry suddenly said with a chuckle. Y/N\nrealized they were already in the kitchen and Harry was saying something to\nher.</p><p>\u201cUm, sorry, what were you saying?\u201d Y/N asked.</p><p>\u201cI was saying, what film would you want to watch tonight?\u201d Harry\nasked. \u201cI was thinking of 'Despicable Me 3\u2019, I haven\u2019t watched that\nyet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh uh,\u201d Y/N stopped, she was going to give him space, she\ncouldn\u2019t just sleep over again, after she knew it bothered him. \u201cSorry\nHarry, can\u2019t stay tonight, I have this exam tomorrow I have to study for, I\njust came by to drop the pizzas and meet you for while,\u201d Y/N lied smiling\nsadly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d surprisingly Harry looked disappointed. \u201cYou can study\nhere, ya know, I won\u2019t disturb ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have all the books, I should be going home now,\u201d Y/N\nhurriedly looked at her watch in her wrist. \u201cProbably won\u2019t be able to\nfinish the chapters, if I don\u2019t.\u201d Y/N quickly gave a peck on Harry\u2019s cheek\nas she went towards the couch where her bag was.</p><p>\u201cAt least eat,\u201d Harry exclaimed catching up behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll grab something on my way, bye,\u201d Y/N shut the door behind\nher before Harry could say anything else.</p><p>She will do everything to give him what he wanted, even if she had to stay\naway from him.</p><p>____</p><p>It had been two weeks, two weeks since Y/N kissed him, two weeks since Y/N\nwent to his house, two weeks since she was distant from him. It was absolutely\nkilling her. Many times she had the urge to call him and just talk, like she\nused to but she stopped herself every time - it was for the best, she told\nherself.</p><p>Y/N typed away furiously on her laptop\u2019s keyboard. She had been working\nnon-stop just to keep her distracted and to get some work done on the process.\nY/N was working on one of her university projects, which wasn\u2019t due 'till next\nmonth, but she was certain to finish it that very day and submit it by the next\nday.</p><p>Y/N was writing the conclusion when her phone rang. It was Harry. At first\nshe thought of not picking it up, but she decided to pick up and listen what he\nwanted say, maybe lie if needed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Y/N muttered while pressing her phone on her ear.</p><p>\u201cHey, kitten, how are you? You sound tired,\u201d Harry cooed through\nthe other line.</p><p>\u201cBecause, I am,\u201d she replied. \u201cWorking on this project for\nuni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, catch a break, come over or I can come over if you want,\u201d\nHarry offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I need to finish it by today, later I also have a shift at the\ncafe, so I\u2019m busy, maybe tomorrow?\u201d Y/N lied - neither she had a shift at\nthe cafe nor she had to finish her project by that day. It was just her way to\nescape from him.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot,\u201d Harry said, Y/N could say by his voice he was hurt,\nvery hurt but -that was what he wanted, right? Some time for himself, away from\nher who was annoying and was suffocating him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Italy for two week tomorrow, remember?\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh yeah, yeah! I remember,\u201d sudden realization hit Y/N, she\nhad totally forgotten, she thought he was supposed to go to Italy the next\nweek. But, it made everything easier for her; she didn\u2019t have to lie to him\nthat much anymore, she hated that. \u201cWell, that\u2019s great isn\u2019t it, you were\nreally excited about it!\u201d Y/N exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry replied half-heartedly. \u201cSo, I just wanted to\nmeet you, 'cause I won\u2019t be able - for two weeks, in fact I haven\u2019t really met\nyou in past two weeks!\u201d Harry exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cHarry I\u2019m busy, talk to you later and we can obviously meet after you\ncome back,\u201d Y/N hung up. It hurt Y/N so - so much, but she obviously\ncouldn\u2019t go and meet him, not after what she heard.</p><p>After finishing her project Y/N decided to Netflix and chill, just so she\ncould get rid of the panging sadness in her stomach and try to actually relax\nfor a while, which she couldn\u2019t do for past 15 days.</p><p>Y/N took out her Vanilla ice cream box from the freeze along with a glass of\nwine before settling herself on the couch with a blanket and pillows around\nher. It reminded her life before meeting Harry, it was all she did when she\ndidn\u2019t have uni or work or just wanted to be lazy.</p><p>Y/N was in the middle of rewatching \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 season 2 when there\nwas a ring on the bell before she heard the door click open. Y/N\u2019s head whipped\ntowards the door as she could feel her heart beat out of her chest. Y/N thought\nit was a robber or a thief. Even though she knew no idiot of a robber or thief\nwould enter through the front door and obviously wouldn\u2019t ring a bell. But, her\ncommon sense didn\u2019t work, she paused the TV, got on her feet and took her wine bottle\nas a shield as she clutched on her blanket. Y/N anxiously waited to see who it\nwas behind the door. She was about scream, but then she saw who it was. It was\nhim.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes scanned Y/N\u2019s small but very cozy and well decorated house\nbefore his eyes landed on her. He was quite confused seeing Y/N in that\nposition but before he could question it, she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me to death Harry!! I thought it was some robber came to\nrob me and then kill me!\u201d Y/N flopped down on the couch as she heaved\nputting her hand over her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh c'mon, no robber would enter after ringing the bell,\u201d Harry\nsaid monotonously, he had more important thing in his mind. \u201cBesides,\nweren\u2019t you supposed to be at work?\u201d He asked as he sat at the small sofa\nplaced next to the couch.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s head shot up at him, as she could literally feel her face heat up. She\nwas caught lying, but she couldn\u2019t let it happen - so she said some more lies.\n\u201cI called in, I was really tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, I went to the cafe to pick you up, but Sofia told me you\ndidn\u2019t have a shift,\u201d Harry said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI - I -\u201d Y/N stuttered. She should have known, he picked her up\nfrom work every now and then, she should have thought something better.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me now, why have you been avoiding me?\u201d Harry said\nlooking intensely at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cWell, wasn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d Y/N breathed out, giving up.\nShe couldn\u2019t do it anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harry asked his eyebrows furrowed - clearly\nconfused.</p><p>\u201cThe other day, I heard you talking to someone, you said I was clingy\nand annoying and was suffocation you,\u201d Y/N said timidly looking down at\nher lap. \u201cAnd, I just didn\u2019t want to be those things, so I thought of\ngiving you some space.\u201d</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t say anything at first, then realization hit him like a truck as\nhe remembered the exact conversation he had with Jeff few weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cI promise I didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop, I just got curious and I\ncouldn\u2019t stop myself,\u201d Y/N finally looked up revealing her glossy eyes to\nHarry. It broke his heart seeing her like that, but his heart was shattered\ninto million pieces knowing it was his fault.</p><p>\u201cOh baby,\u201d Harry was quick to kneel down in front of her and grab\nboth of her knees. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry; I don\u2019t know why I said it. I guess I\nwas just not used to having you around me after being away from you for so\nlong.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBesides, after getting space from you, I really don\u2019t want it ever in my\nlife!\u201d He added after a while.</p><p>It made a small smile tug on Y/N\u2019s pouty lips and Harry understood he was\nforgiven. Harry got up and sat next to Y/N and hugged her tightly.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me next time if you feel anything like that,\u201d Y/N said,\nbut her voice was muffled as her face was pressed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely love,\u201d Harry whispered kissing her forehead before\nlooking down at her smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, you\u2019re coming with me to Italy, I have the ticket and it\u2019s\nfor two weeks so you can clearly take a small leave from uni too,\u201d Harry\nstated as he turned to the TV while casually resting his arm over his shoulder\nand pressed the play button on the remote after finding it behind his butt.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Y/N asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming to Italy with me, oh you need to pack your bag too, I\u2019ll\nhelp you after finish watching this episode,\u201d he said nonchalantly\nfocusing on the series, Y/N had once forced him to watch and with which he\nabsolutely fell in love with.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I have uni! I can\u2019t just go to Italy like that!\u201d Y/N\nexclaimed.</p><p>\u201cOh c'mon, I just told you it\u2019s for two weeks, you can definitely take\nsome days off, if not tell them you\u2019re sick!\u201d Harry said still not peeling\nhis eyes of the television screen. \u201cI just can\u2019t bear to stay another two weeks\naway from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBu-\u201d Y/N tried to reason again but was cut off by Harry.</p><p>\u201cNo 'buts\u2019 you\u2019re coming,\u201d Harry said as he bought Y/N closure to\nhim, so she could rest her head on his chest. At first she just sat straight\nthinking but after a while she nuzzled her head in his chest wrapping a hand\naround his waist and again paying attention to the series.</p><p>Harry kissed the top of her head, he knew that meant yes.</p>",

She made her way to the\nkitchen and placed the pizzas on the counter before making her way up the\nstairs to use the bathroom in Harry\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201c - I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just - she\u2019s clingy, ya know,\u201d Y/N stopped\ndead on her tracks as she heard her boyfriend talk negatively about someone.\nFor some reason, she felt like he was talking about her, but he couldn\u2019t talk\nabout her like that, could he?</p><p>As curiosity got the best of her, instead of going inside she stood outside,\neavesdropping. She knew it wasn\u2019t the best idea, but she felt like she had to\nknow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always holding my hand when we are outside, wearing my clothes,\nsleeping over every day, it\u2019s just annoying, I feel suffocated!\u201d Y/N by\nthen was quite sure, he was talking about her. Y/N did all of those things but\nshe didn\u2019t know she was being annoying or suffocating him.</p><p>She held hands with him whenever they were on street; it wasn\u2019t especially\nbecause he was her boyfriend but because it was her habit. She held hands with\nher brother, her sister, her cousins her best friend or whoever she was with\n(as long as they didn\u2019t have a bad relation) and whenever they were walking on\nstreets, it was just her habit. She definitely felt it was weird, but no one\never complained until Harry.</p><p>She did wear his clothes, but it was recently. It was just her way to show\nhim she loved him and it was her way to miss him a little less.</p><p>She was sleeping over, it was just because she knew he would be leaving in\nfew days and she won\u2019t be seeing him in another few weeks. She was just trying\nto make the best out of the time they had, for them.</p><p>Apparently Harry didn\u2019t like it. It was annoying for him; suffocating even.\nIt broke Y/N\u2019s heart, that Harry felt about her like that and it hurt her more\nthat instead of telling it to her he was telling it to one of his friends.\nHowever, Y/N still trusted him; she still believed he won\u2019t talk about her like\nthat behind her back; he could have been talking about anyone.</p><p>It was like; Harry read her thoughts as he replied in his phone. \u201cNo,\nY/N doesn\u2019t want attention or anything she\u2019s just clingy, anyway talk to later,\nshe\u2019s downstairs would come up if I take too long,\u201d Harry hung up\nlaughing.</p><p>Y/N quickly went in the bathroom she never used across Harry\u2019s room before\nhe could see her. She heard Harry\u2019s footsteps fade downstairs when she looked\nat the mirror over the sink.</p><p>Maybe she <i>was</i> clingy. Hell she knew she was clingy, she had known\nthat all her life, but she never thought it bothered him. Here was the thing\nabout Y/N, she either didn\u2019t care about her partners or she cared too much. And\nif she cared too much she could literally give her life to that person.\nHowever, that didn\u2019t happen much, she only had one relationship like that\nbefore (which ended up in a disaster) and Harry was the second person who ever\nmade her feel that way. Even though Harry was the second person Y/N never felt\nlike that for anyone. What that guy made her feel was nothing compared to what\nHarry made her feel. Y/N loved him more than anything.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes swelled up with tears as she kept looking at her reflection in\nthe mirror.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t cry,\u201d she whispered to herself as she rubbed her eyes\nmaking sure she didn\u2019t smudge the mascara she had applied in the morning.</p><p>\u201cThis is stupid, you are clingy,\u201d Y/N told herself. \u201cGive him\nsome space; of course you wouldn\u2019t like it either if he breathed down your neck\nlike you did.\u201d Y/N breathed steadily as she tried to calm herself down.</p><p>\u201cY/N, where are you?\u201d Harry yelled from downstairs making Y/N jolt\nand look at the door\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cCo- coming,\u201d Y/N broke, but she quickly recovered. She hastily\nlooked at herself in the mirror, to make sure there was no trace of tears or\nsadness in her face, she smiled to herself before making her way out of the\nbathroom to find a breathless Harry jog upstairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, just in the bathroom,\u201d Y/N pointed to her left at the white\nwooden door.</p><p>\u201cBut you never used it,\u201d Harry furrowed his brows.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that is why I decided to use it, I mean every bathroom wants to\nbe used\u2026.like dustbins, \u2018use me\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled at Y/N\u2019s joke. \u201cC'mere, you\u201d Harry wrapped his arms\naround Y/N\u2019s shoulder as he gave her temples quick kiss in the process.\n\u201cHow was uni?\u201d He asked as he guided her downstairs.</p><p>\u201cIt was good, I guess,\u201d Y/N replied trying to act as normal as\npossible. But, she was confused really, Harry acted like nothing happened- like\nhe didn\u2019t just complain how clingy she was a minute ago, like he didn\u2019t say she\nsuffocated him.</p><p>It had her thinking if Harry had done that before - acted \u2018normal\u2019 just\nafter insulting her to his friends. This made Y/N scoot away from him\nautomatically. Y/N was angry and sad the same time. Harry didn\u2019t have the right\nto talk about their problems to other, but maybe he just didn\u2019t want to hurt\nher feelings.</p><p>That moment she decided that she was going to give Harry what he wanted. She\nwas going to give him some space.</p><p>\u201cHey, earth to Y/N,\u201d Harry suddenly said with a chuckle. Y/N\nrealized they were already in the kitchen and Harry was saying something to\nher.</p><p>\u201cUm, sorry, what were you saying?\u201d Y/N asked.</p><p>\u201cI was saying, what film would you want to watch tonight?\u201d Harry\nasked. \u201cI was thinking of 'Despicable Me 3\u2019, I haven\u2019t watched that\nyet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh uh,\u201d Y/N stopped, she was going to give him space, she\ncouldn\u2019t just sleep over again, after she knew it bothered him. \u201cSorry\nHarry, can\u2019t stay tonight, I have this exam tomorrow I have to study for, I\njust came by to drop the pizzas and meet you for while,\u201d Y/N lied smiling\nsadly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d surprisingly Harry looked disappointed. \u201cYou can study\nhere, ya know, I won\u2019t disturb ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have all the books, I should be going home now,\u201d Y/N\nhurriedly looked at her watch in her wrist. \u201cProbably won\u2019t be able to\nfinish the chapters, if I don\u2019t.\u201d Y/N quickly gave a peck on Harry\u2019s cheek\nas she went towards the couch where her bag was.</p><p>\u201cAt least eat,\u201d Harry exclaimed catching up behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll grab something on my way, bye,\u201d Y/N shut the door behind\nher before Harry could say anything else.</p><p>She will do everything to give him what he wanted, even if she had to stay\naway from him.</p><p>____</p><p>It had been two weeks, two weeks since Y/N kissed him, two weeks since Y/N\nwent to his house, two weeks since she was distant from him. It was absolutely\nkilling her. Many times she had the urge to call him and just talk, like she\nused to but she stopped herself every time - it was for the best, she told\nherself.</p><p>Y/N typed away furiously on her laptop\u2019s keyboard. She had been working\nnon-stop just to keep her distracted and to get some work done on the process.\nY/N was working on one of her university projects, which wasn\u2019t due 'till next\nmonth, but she was certain to finish it that very day and submit it by the next\nday.</p><p>Y/N was writing the conclusion when her phone rang. It was Harry. At first\nshe thought of not picking it up, but she decided to pick up and listen what he\nwanted say, maybe lie if needed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Y/N muttered while pressing her phone on her ear.</p><p>\u201cHey, kitten, how are you? You sound tired,\u201d Harry cooed through\nthe other line.</p><p>\u201cBecause, I am,\u201d she replied. \u201cWorking on this project for\nuni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, catch a break, come over or I can come over if you want,\u201d\nHarry offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I need to finish it by today, later I also have a shift at the\ncafe, so I\u2019m busy, maybe tomorrow?\u201d Y/N lied - neither she had a shift at\nthe cafe nor she had to finish her project by that day. It was just her way to\nescape from him.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot,\u201d Harry said, Y/N could say by his voice he was hurt,\nvery hurt but -that was what he wanted, right? Some time for himself, away from\nher who was annoying and was suffocating him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Italy for two week tomorrow, remember?\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh yeah, yeah! I remember,\u201d sudden realization hit Y/N, she\nhad totally forgotten, she thought he was supposed to go to Italy the next\nweek. But, it made everything easier for her; she didn\u2019t have to lie to him\nthat much anymore, she hated that. \u201cWell, that\u2019s great isn\u2019t it, you were\nreally excited about it!\u201d Y/N exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry replied half-heartedly. \u201cSo, I just wanted to\nmeet you, 'cause I won\u2019t be able - for two weeks, in fact I haven\u2019t really met\nyou in past two weeks!\u201d Harry exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cHarry I\u2019m busy, talk to you later and we can obviously meet after you\ncome back,\u201d Y/N hung up. It hurt Y/N so - so much, but she obviously\ncouldn\u2019t go and meet him, not after what she heard.</p><p>After finishing her project Y/N decided to Netflix and chill, just so she\ncould get rid of the panging sadness in her stomach and try to actually relax\nfor a while, which she couldn\u2019t do for past 15 days.</p><p>Y/N took out her Vanilla ice cream box from the freeze along with a glass of\nwine before settling herself on the couch with a blanket and pillows around\nher. It reminded her life before meeting Harry, it was all she did when she\ndidn\u2019t have uni or work or just wanted to be lazy.</p><p>Y/N was in the middle of rewatching \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 season 2 when there\nwas a ring on the bell before she heard the door click open. Y/N\u2019s head whipped\ntowards the door as she could feel her heart beat out of her chest. Y/N thought\nit was a robber or a thief. Even though she knew no idiot of a robber or thief\nwould enter through the front door and obviously wouldn\u2019t ring a bell. But, her\ncommon sense didn\u2019t work, she paused the TV, got on her feet and took her wine bottle\nas a shield as she clutched on her blanket. Y/N anxiously waited to see who it\nwas behind the door. She was about scream, but then she saw who it was. It was\nhim.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes scanned Y/N\u2019s small but very cozy and well decorated house\nbefore his eyes landed on her. He was quite confused seeing Y/N in that\nposition but before he could question it, she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me to death Harry!! I thought it was some robber came to\nrob me and then kill me!\u201d Y/N flopped down on the couch as she heaved\nputting her hand over her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh c'mon, no robber would enter after ringing the bell,\u201d Harry\nsaid monotonously, he had more important thing in his mind. \u201cBesides,\nweren\u2019t you supposed to be at work?\u201d He asked as he sat at the small sofa\nplaced next to the couch.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s head shot up at him, as she could literally feel her face heat up. She\nwas caught lying, but she couldn\u2019t let it happen - so she said some more lies.\n\u201cI called in, I was really tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, I went to the cafe to pick you up, but Sofia told me you\ndidn\u2019t have a shift,\u201d Harry said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI - I -\u201d Y/N stuttered. She should have known, he picked her up\nfrom work every now and then, she should have thought something better.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me now, why have you been avoiding me?\u201d Harry said\nlooking intensely at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cWell, wasn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d Y/N breathed out, giving up.\nShe couldn\u2019t do it anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harry asked his eyebrows furrowed - clearly\nconfused.</p><p>\u201cThe other day, I heard you talking to someone, you said I was clingy\nand annoying and was suffocation you,\u201d Y/N said timidly looking down at\nher lap. \u201cAnd, I just didn\u2019t want to be those things, so I thought of\ngiving you some space.\u201d</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t say anything at first, then realization hit him like a truck as\nhe remembered the exact conversation he had with Jeff few weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cI promise I didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop, I just got curious and I\ncouldn\u2019t stop myself,\u201d Y/N finally looked up revealing her glossy eyes to\nHarry. It broke his heart seeing her like that, but his heart was shattered\ninto million pieces knowing it was his fault.</p><p>\u201cOh baby,\u201d Harry was quick to kneel down in front of her and grab\nboth of her knees. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry; I don\u2019t know why I said it. I guess I\nwas just not used to having you around me after being away from you for so\nlong.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBesides, after getting space from you, I really don\u2019t want it ever in my\nlife!\u201d He added after a while.</p><p>It made a small smile tug on Y/N\u2019s pouty lips and Harry understood he was\nforgiven. Harry got up and sat next to Y/N and hugged her tightly.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me next time if you feel anything like that,\u201d Y/N said,\nbut her voice was muffled as her face was pressed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely love,\u201d Harry whispered kissing her forehead before\nlooking down at her smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, you\u2019re coming with me to Italy, I have the ticket and it\u2019s\nfor two weeks so you can clearly take a small leave from uni too,\u201d Harry\nstated as he turned to the TV while casually resting his arm over his shoulder\nand pressed the play button on the remote after finding it behind his butt.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Y/N asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming to Italy with me, oh you need to pack your bag too, I\u2019ll\nhelp you after finish watching this episode,\u201d he said nonchalantly\nfocusing on the series, Y/N had once forced him to watch and with which he\nabsolutely fell in love with.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I have uni! I can\u2019t just go to Italy like that!\u201d Y/N\nexclaimed.</p><p>\u201cOh c'mon, I just told you it\u2019s for two weeks, you can definitely take\nsome days off, if not tell them you\u2019re sick!\u201d Harry said still not peeling\nhis eyes of the television screen. \u201cI just can\u2019t bear to stay another two weeks\naway from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBu-\u201d Y/N tried to reason again but was cut off by Harry.</p><p>\u201cNo 'buts\u2019 you\u2019re coming,\u201d Harry said as he bought Y/N closure to\nhim, so she could rest her head on his chest. At first she just sat straight\nthinking but after a while she nuzzled her head in his chest wrapping a hand\naround his waist and again paying attention to the series.</p><p>Harry kissed the top of her head, he knew that meant yes.</p>",
                "content": "<p><i>- The one where Y/N over hears Harry talking negatively about her.</i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://itslikeipayforit.tumblr.com/post/171056296870/master-list\">Master List</a></b></p><p><i><b>Feedbacks are very much appreciated and requests are open!</b></i></p><p>Y/N slowly opened the door of Harry&rsquo;s apartment by the key he had given her.</p><p>Y/N had just returned from uni, but instead of going to her house she went\nto a pizza shop to grab two pizzas and went straight to Harry&rsquo;s house.</p><p>He had recently came back from his six months tour and to Y/N&rsquo;s dismay he\nwas going to Italy for a Gucci campaign by the end of the month, so she was\ntrying to spend as much time as possible with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Babe, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Y/N yelled entering the living room, as she\npeeled her backpack off from her shoulder and placing it on the sofa. &ldquo;I\nhave pizza!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; Y/N heard Harry yell back. She made her way to the\nkitchen and placed the pizzas on the counter before making her way up the\nstairs to use the bathroom in Harry&rsquo;s room.</p><p>&ldquo; - I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s just - she&rsquo;s clingy, ya know,&rdquo; Y/N stopped\ndead on her tracks as she heard her boyfriend talk negatively about someone.\nFor some reason, she felt like he was talking about her, but he couldn&rsquo;t talk\nabout her like that, could he?</p><p>As curiosity got the best of her, instead of going inside she stood outside,\neavesdropping. She knew it wasn&rsquo;t the best idea, but she felt like she had to\nknow.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always holding my hand when we are outside, wearing my clothes,\nsleeping over every day, it&rsquo;s just annoying, I feel suffocated!&rdquo; Y/N by\nthen was quite sure, he was talking about her. Y/N did all of those things but\nshe didn&rsquo;t know she was being annoying or suffocating him.</p><p>She held hands with him whenever they were on street; it wasn&rsquo;t especially\nbecause he was her boyfriend but because it was her habit. She held hands with\nher brother, her sister, her cousins her best friend or whoever she was with\n(as long as they didn&rsquo;t have a bad relation) and whenever they were walking on\nstreets, it was just her habit. She definitely felt it was weird, but no one\never complained until Harry.</p><p>She did wear his clothes, but it was recently. It was just her way to show\nhim she loved him and it was her way to miss him a little less.</p><p>She was sleeping over, it was just because she knew he would be leaving in\nfew days and she won&rsquo;t be seeing him in another few weeks. She was just trying\nto make the best out of the time they had, for them.</p><p>Apparently Harry didn&rsquo;t like it. It was annoying for him; suffocating even.\nIt broke Y/N&rsquo;s heart, that Harry felt about her like that and it hurt her more\nthat instead of telling it to her he was telling it to one of his friends.\nHowever, Y/N still trusted him; she still believed he won&rsquo;t talk about her like\nthat behind her back; he could have been talking about anyone.</p><p>It was like; Harry read her thoughts as he replied in his phone. &ldquo;No,\nY/N doesn&rsquo;t want attention or anything she&rsquo;s just clingy, anyway talk to later,\nshe&rsquo;s downstairs would come up if I take too long,&rdquo; Harry hung up\nlaughing.</p><p>Y/N quickly went in the bathroom she never used across Harry&rsquo;s room before\nhe could see her. She heard Harry&rsquo;s footsteps fade downstairs when she looked\nat the mirror over the sink.</p><p>Maybe she <i>was</i> clingy. Hell she knew she was clingy, she had known\nthat all her life, but she never thought it bothered him. Here was the thing\nabout Y/N, she either didn&rsquo;t care about her partners or she cared too much. And\nif she cared too much she could literally give her life to that person.\nHowever, that didn&rsquo;t happen much, she only had one relationship like that\nbefore (which ended up in a disaster) and Harry was the second person who ever\nmade her feel that way. Even though Harry was the second person Y/N never felt\nlike that for anyone. What that guy made her feel was nothing compared to what\nHarry made her feel. Y/N loved him more than anything.</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s eyes swelled up with tears as she kept looking at her reflection in\nthe mirror.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; she whispered to herself as she rubbed her eyes\nmaking sure she didn&rsquo;t smudge the mascara she had applied in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;This is stupid, you are clingy,&rdquo; Y/N told herself. &ldquo;Give him\nsome space; of course you wouldn&rsquo;t like it either if he breathed down your neck\nlike you did.&rdquo; Y/N breathed steadily as she tried to calm herself down.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, where are you?&rdquo; Harry yelled from downstairs making Y/N jolt\nand look at the door&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Co- coming,&rdquo; Y/N broke, but she quickly recovered. She hastily\nlooked at herself in the mirror, to make sure there was no trace of tears or\nsadness in her face, she smiled to herself before making her way out of the\nbathroom to find a breathless Harry jog upstairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, just in the bathroom,&rdquo; Y/N pointed to her left at the white\nwooden door.</p><p>&ldquo;But you never used it,&rdquo; Harry furrowed his brows.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that is why I decided to use it, I mean every bathroom wants to\nbe used&hellip;.like dustbins, &lsquo;use me&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry chuckled at Y/N&rsquo;s joke. &ldquo;C'mere, you&rdquo; Harry wrapped his arms\naround Y/N&rsquo;s shoulder as he gave her temples quick kiss in the process.\n&ldquo;How was uni?&rdquo; He asked as he guided her downstairs.</p><p>&ldquo;It was good, I guess,&rdquo; Y/N replied trying to act as normal as\npossible. But, she was confused really, Harry acted like nothing happened- like\nhe didn&rsquo;t just complain how clingy she was a minute ago, like he didn&rsquo;t say she\nsuffocated him.</p><p>It had her thinking if Harry had done that before - acted &lsquo;normal&rsquo; just\nafter insulting her to his friends. This made Y/N scoot away from him\nautomatically. Y/N was angry and sad the same time. Harry didn&rsquo;t have the right\nto talk about their problems to other, but maybe he just didn&rsquo;t want to hurt\nher feelings.</p><p>That moment she decided that she was going to give Harry what he wanted. She\nwas going to give him some space.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, earth to Y/N,&rdquo; Harry suddenly said with a chuckle. Y/N\nrealized they were already in the kitchen and Harry was saying something to\nher.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, sorry, what were you saying?&rdquo; Y/N asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I was saying, what film would you want to watch tonight?&rdquo; Harry\nasked. &ldquo;I was thinking of 'Despicable Me 3&rsquo;, I haven&rsquo;t watched that\nyet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh uh,&rdquo; Y/N stopped, she was going to give him space, she\ncouldn&rsquo;t just sleep over again, after she knew it bothered him. &ldquo;Sorry\nHarry, can&rsquo;t stay tonight, I have this exam tomorrow I have to study for, I\njust came by to drop the pizzas and meet you for while,&rdquo; Y/N lied smiling\nsadly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; surprisingly Harry looked disappointed. &ldquo;You can study\nhere, ya know, I won&rsquo;t disturb ya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have all the books, I should be going home now,&rdquo; Y/N\nhurriedly looked at her watch in her wrist. &ldquo;Probably won&rsquo;t be able to\nfinish the chapters, if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Y/N quickly gave a peck on Harry&rsquo;s cheek\nas she went towards the couch where her bag was.</p><p>&ldquo;At least eat,&rdquo; Harry exclaimed catching up behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll grab something on my way, bye,&rdquo; Y/N shut the door behind\nher before Harry could say anything else.</p><p>She will do everything to give him what he wanted, even if she had to stay\naway from him.</p><p>____</p><p>It had been two weeks, two weeks since Y/N kissed him, two weeks since Y/N\nwent to his house, two weeks since she was distant from him. It was absolutely\nkilling her. Many times she had the urge to call him and just talk, like she\nused to but she stopped herself every time - it was for the best, she told\nherself.</p><p>Y/N typed away furiously on her laptop&rsquo;s keyboard. She had been working\nnon-stop just to keep her distracted and to get some work done on the process.\nY/N was working on one of her university projects, which wasn&rsquo;t due 'till next\nmonth, but she was certain to finish it that very day and submit it by the next\nday.</p><p>Y/N was writing the conclusion when her phone rang.

It hurt Y/N so - so much, but she obviously\ncouldn&rsquo;t go and meet him, not after what she heard.</p><p>After finishing her project Y/N decided to Netflix and chill, just so she\ncould get rid of the panging sadness in her stomach and try to actually relax\nfor a while, which she couldn&rsquo;t do for past 15 days.</p><p>Y/N took out her Vanilla ice cream box from the freeze along with a glass of\nwine before settling herself on the couch with a blanket and pillows around\nher.

You weren\u2019t one to\ndiscuss your finances with him, feeling slightly insecure by his lavish\nlifestyle. Harry figured it wasn\u2019t his business as you two didn\u2019t live\ntogether, and that you\u2019d come to him when you felt the time was right. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been taking money from my savings to make ends meet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Harry started.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019ll figure it out. I\u2019ve already talked with\nmy manager about the hot water I\u2019m in, and she said she\u2019d do everything in her\npower to help with hours and pay cheques.\u201d You quickly cut him off, not wanting\nto hear the typical <i>\u201cI can lend you money\u201d\n</i>or <i>\u201cLet me help you out\u201d</i>. Mainly\nbecause you hated asking for help, and secondly because you didn\u2019t trust that\nyou\u2019d be able to pay back the funds in a timely manner while also meeting the\nbare minimum needs for yourself. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she responsible for giving out the cheques?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a franchised company, she has to put the hours in and\nwait for payroll to process it.\u201d </p><p>Harry scoffed. He wanted so bad to be able to help you, to\ntell you that he could make it all go away. \u201cIs there anything you need or want\nfrom me for help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m using you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI never would. Shit like this happens, and I\u2019m here with you\nto help through all of it.\u201d</p><p>He closed the laptop and it along with all the scattered\npaperwork onto the coffee table. Standing up, he stood in front of you, arms\ncrossed. Anyone would consider his body language to be cold and intimidating, but\nyou knew it was anything but. That look in his eye; it was one of pure concern\nand love for you. Sighing, you still tried to put up a fight, knowing it was\nfutile. \u201cHarry, I need to finish up here!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can do it later. You need sleep before you handle\nanything with your finances.\u201d He swiftly picked you up, carrying you to your\nbedroom. He laid out the pajamas that he knew were your favorite, and gently\nbegan getting you out of your day clothing. </p><p>There was no sexual feeling to that moment, only complete\nsoftness and care defined his actions. </p><p>A smile rose to your face at the sight of your boyfriend.\nHis curly hair was tousled and messy, but somehow still looked amazing. His\nbrows furrowed in concentration, trying to get the <i>\u201cdamned buttons up\u201d</i>; as he\u2019d always say. </p><p>You kissed his forehead as he leaned down. \u201cThank you, truly.\u201d\nHe smirked opening his mouth to make a jokingly smart-ass remark, but you were\nfaster. \u201cRemind me what I did to have you as my boyfriend?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou were just you, love.\u201d He finished up with the shirt,\nlifting your chin to kiss you. As you kissed him, you let all your worries\nfloat away for a while, only focusing on the feeling of being with <i>your person</i>.</p><p>He moved away, going to take his position on the soft bed. Mirroring\nhis actions, you moved to your side, getting under the covers and appreciating\nthe safety net the mattress provided. </p><p>Harry wrapped around your waist, pulling you in. \u201cI\u2019m always\ngoing to be here.\u201d He said, holding you to his chest. </p><p>Sighing contently, you bid him goodnight. \u201cI love you\u201d you\nmurmured sleepily, a yawn escaping your mouth. </p><p>\u201cAnd I you, Y/N.\u201d </p><hr><p style=\"\">Taglist for all the lovely hoes who like reading my stuff for some reason:\u00a0</p><p style=\"\"><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meN8rHJadTn5Z3eB_ShEuAw\" target=\"_blank\">@fics2readl8r</a></p><p><i>(Okay so it\u2019s not a list it\u2019s one blog leave me alone I am valid)</i></p>",

Harry figured it wasn\u2019t his business as you two didn\u2019t live\ntogether, and that you\u2019d come to him when you felt the time was right. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been taking money from my savings to make ends meet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Harry started.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019ll figure it out. I\u2019ve already talked with\nmy manager about the hot water I\u2019m in, and she said she\u2019d do everything in her\npower to help with hours and pay cheques.\u201d You quickly cut him off, not wanting\nto hear the typical <i>\u201cI can lend you money\u201d\n</i>or <i>\u201cLet me help you out\u201d</i>. Mainly\nbecause you hated asking for help, and secondly because you didn\u2019t trust that\nyou\u2019d be able to pay back the funds in a timely manner while also meeting the\nbare minimum needs for yourself. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she responsible for giving out the cheques?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a franchised company, she has to put the hours in and\nwait for payroll to process it.\u201d </p><p>Harry scoffed. He wanted so bad to be able to help you, to\ntell you that he could make it all go away. \u201cIs there anything you need or want\nfrom me for help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m using you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI never would. Shit like this happens, and I\u2019m here with you\nto help through all of it.\u201d</p><p>He closed the laptop and it along with all the scattered\npaperwork onto the coffee table. Standing up, he stood in front of you, arms\ncrossed. Anyone would consider his body language to be cold and intimidating, but\nyou knew it was anything but. That look in his eye; it was one of pure concern\nand love for you. Sighing, you still tried to put up a fight, knowing it was\nfutile. \u201cHarry, I need to finish up here!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can do it later. You need sleep before you handle\nanything with your finances.\u201d He swiftly picked you up, carrying you to your\nbedroom. He laid out the pajamas that he knew were your favorite, and gently\nbegan getting you out of your day clothing. </p><p>There was no sexual feeling to that moment, only complete\nsoftness and care defined his actions. </p><p>A smile rose to your face at the sight of your boyfriend.\nHis curly hair was tousled and messy, but somehow still looked amazing. His\nbrows furrowed in concentration, trying to get the <i>\u201cdamned buttons up\u201d</i>; as he\u2019d always say. </p><p>You kissed his forehead as he leaned down. \u201cThank you, truly.\u201d\nHe smirked opening his mouth to make a jokingly smart-ass remark, but you were\nfaster. \u201cRemind me what I did to have you as my boyfriend?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou were just you, love.\u201d He finished up with the shirt,\nlifting your chin to kiss you. As you kissed him, you let all your worries\nfloat away for a while, only focusing on the feeling of being with <i>your person</i>.</p><p>He moved away, going to take his position on the soft bed. Mirroring\nhis actions, you moved to your side, getting under the covers and appreciating\nthe safety net the mattress provided. </p><p>Harry wrapped around your waist, pulling you in. \u201cI\u2019m always\ngoing to be here.\u201d He said, holding you to his chest. </p><p>Sighing contently, you bid him goodnight. \u201cI love you\u201d you\nmurmured sleepily, a yawn escaping your mouth. </p><p>\u201cAnd I you, Y/N.\u201d </p><hr><p style=\"\">Taglist for all the lovely hoes who like reading my stuff for some reason:\u00a0</p><p style=\"\"><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meN8rHJadTn5Z3eB_ShEuAw\" target=\"_blank\">@fics2readl8r</a></p><p><i>(Okay so it\u2019s not a list it\u2019s one blog leave me alone I am valid)</i></p>",
