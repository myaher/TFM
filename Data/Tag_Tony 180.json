I don\u2019t have anymore of a creative name atm than \u2018animal bloods\u2019 but this shit is a work in progress.\u00a0</p><p>So like, this third race has both animal and human characteristics and how they are treated varies depending on the place. They\u2019re mostly human, only born to either animal blood parents or human parents as the transformation is caused by a faulty gene in their dna, so they\u2019re conscious of their actions and are able to control themselves.</p><p>(Though it is possible for them to go \u2018feral\u2019)\u00a0</p><p>However, their treatment in most first world countries are negative as people start to panic what these animal bloods can do. They have control over their own powers, but does that make them worse? Who\u2019s stopping them from transforming in a bank? In a school? What\u2019s stopping them from using their unharnessed powers for good?\u00a0</p><p>Unlike in Wakanda, where their royal family consistently consisted on a black panther blood line, America has a different policy. They put these animal bloods in special facilities, if they\u2019re lucky, where they\u2019re treated like they\u2019re things to be gawked at and are barely given any room to be either animal or human.\u00a0</p><p>These creatures have barely any laws to protect them, other than that the government can\u2019t kill them and must provide them with some sort of environment. They don\u2019t count under human rights or animal rights either. They\u2019re treated as subhuman.</p><p>These creatures can be kept by their parents, if they\u2019re human, until they\u2019re legally an adult \u2013 then they\u2019re taken away to one of the facilities \u2013 or if the parents choice so they can be taken away at birth. Parents also have the option to terminate the pregnancy, no matter how late, if they have evidence of the animal blood, and (Though it\u2019s no longer legal) used to be able to act the doctor to kill the child once it was born.</p><p><br/></p><h2>So like that\u2019s the background, here is the characters (which are all canine or feline btw):</h2><ul><li><b>Tony:</b> Tony is a tiger blood (yeah, Tony the Tiger, sue me) and he was born to two human parents. They kept him and raised him, ignoring his deformities and locking him away when he turned, and hoped that the laws may have changed enough that he\u2019d be his own person by the time he was eighteen. The same day he learned about their death at 17 was the same day he was taken to live at the facility. In fact, it was the same hour. He\u2019s lived there since then, watching animal bloods come and go as the only person that was still there from day one was his best friend, his now only friend, James Rhodes. Tony\u2019s markings included an orange colouring on his tan skin that stretched from the top of his neck, back of his forearms, down his back, and behind his legs, them all marked with tiger stripes. Some of the strips also stretched to his lower jaw. He also had pointed teeth, as most canine and feline bloods did, and his nails grew in sharper.</li><li><b>Rhodey: </b>Rhodey is a black jaguar blood. He\u2019s been in that facility only a few months longer than Tony had and had comforted the teenager when he\u2019d arrived since he was older and was more used to facilities. He took care of him, protected him from the humans, made sure he ate, and helped him become confident in the animal form he\u2019d been suppressing his whole life. He\u2019d defend his best friend to his last breath. His markings were simple dark spots that peppered his arms, legs, back, and stomach, barely visible against his dark skin unless you focused, and had the same teeth and nails as his friend.</li><li><b>Steve:</b> Steve is a lion blood, but not even that, he\u2019s a white lion blood. One of the rarer animal bloods out there. He was thrown in whilst in his thirties and was rather vocal in his hatred as he revealed that he\u2019d never been in a facility before, despite his age. This definitely made him a hero among the kids and with some of the adults too. Steve had made his own pack with friends and managed to lay low for years, helping other animal bloods in need, but only two of them were captured, him and his friend Bucky, a wolf blood that was put into the canine habitat. He had no marking, just skin a little paler than it could be and thick blonde hair as well as a beard to accompany it, giving him almost a mane even when he wasn\u2019t sulking around in his lion form. He also had the same teeth and nails.</li></ul><h2>The rest imma go in less detail for because I haven\u2019t completely thought them through yet</h2><ul><li><b>Bucky:</b> A wolf blood. Appearance is a black fairly intimidating wolf, contrasts his best friend wildly. Doesn\u2019t talk too much and transforms into human form rarely.</li><li><b>Peter and Aunt May</b>: both wolf bloods, dark brown in colour. Peter is only seven and has never See life outside in the facility, May adopted him when he came in as basically a new born infant. </li><li><b>Miles</b>: Black jaguar blood, like Rhodey. Is five and has taken to Rhodey and Tony like a fish takes to water, referring to them both as their uncles. They\u2019re unsure what happened to his actual family. Has same marks as Rhodey.</li><li><b>Scott</b>: a wolf blood. Has more of a reddish coat despite his dark coloured hair. Very excitable despite the circumstances. He also managed to avoid the facility for most of his life, and even had a daughter at one point before he was taken away. His ex-wife, their daughter, and new husband do come to see hi once a month, even if it\u2019s through zoo like bars.</li><li><b>Hope</b>: Coyote blood. Daughter of hank and was born in captivity. Doesn\u2019t socialise too much but Scott doesn\u2019t leave her alone. Admittedly, she does like to hear him tell her about the outside world.</li><li><b>Hank</b>: Coyote blood. Lost his mate after Hope was born due to the workers separating them to as they didn\u2019t want any more breeding between them. They left Hope to stay with her father and, though heartbroken, he did his best to keep her and look after her.</li><li><b>Pepper</b>: Red fox blood. Certain in herself and, though small, isn\u2019t to be messed with. Hangs out with Tony and Rhodey in the outdoor incloser and protective of her friends. </li><li><b>Bruce</b>: Euroasian lynx blood. Pretty shy and prefers solitude to company and can get snappy if you come into his part of the enclosure without permission. Tony helped him adjust to the facility and sometimes the two spend time with each other chilling outside, though there isn\u2019t a lot of talking. He has dark spots that peppers his light skin.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>There is probably more but that\u2019s all for right now. You guys interested? Might make it A/B/O dynamics too but I\u2019m not quite sure yet. If you are, I\u2019ll try to write something. And it\u2019ll probably be stony.</p><p><br/></p><p>But, if you like it, anyone has permission to use this au! Give me credit and tag me/message me because I\u2019d love to see/read what you guys so. Thanks!</p>",

They kept him and raised him, ignoring his deformities and locking him away when he turned, and hoped that the laws may have changed enough that he\u2019d be his own person by the time he was eighteen. The same day he learned about their death at 17 was the same day he was taken to live at the facility. In fact, it was the same hour. He\u2019s lived there since then, watching animal bloods come and go as the only person that was still there from day one was his best friend, his now only friend, James Rhodes. Tony\u2019s markings included an orange colouring on his tan skin that stretched from the top of his neck, back of his forearms, down his back, and behind his legs, them all marked with tiger stripes. Some of the strips also stretched to his lower jaw. He also had pointed teeth, as most canine and feline bloods did, and his nails grew in sharper.</li><li><b>Rhodey: </b>Rhodey is a black jaguar blood. He\u2019s been in that facility only a few months longer than Tony had and had comforted the teenager when he\u2019d arrived since he was older and was more used to facilities. He took care of him, protected him from the humans, made sure he ate, and helped him become confident in the animal form he\u2019d been suppressing his whole life. He\u2019d defend his best friend to his last breath. His markings were simple dark spots that peppered his arms, legs, back, and stomach, barely visible against his dark skin unless you focused, and had the same teeth and nails as his friend.</li><li><b>Steve:</b> Steve is a lion blood, but not even that, he\u2019s a white lion blood. One of the rarer animal bloods out there. He was thrown in whilst in his thirties and was rather vocal in his hatred as he revealed that he\u2019d never been in a facility before, despite his age. This definitely made him a hero among the kids and with some of the adults too. Steve had made his own pack with friends and managed to lay low for years, helping other animal bloods in need, but only two of them were captured, him and his friend Bucky, a wolf blood that was put into the canine habitat. He had no marking, just skin a little paler than it could be and thick blonde hair as well as a beard to accompany it, giving him almost a mane even when he wasn\u2019t sulking around in his lion form. He also had the same teeth and nails.</li></ul><h2>The rest imma go in less detail for because I haven\u2019t completely thought them through yet</h2><ul><li><b>Bucky:</b> A wolf blood. Appearance is a black fairly intimidating wolf, contrasts his best friend wildly. Doesn\u2019t talk too much and transforms into human form rarely.</li><li><b>Peter and Aunt May</b>: both wolf bloods, dark brown in colour. Peter is only seven and has never See life outside in the facility, May adopted him when he came in as basically a new born infant. </li><li><b>Miles</b>: Black jaguar blood, like Rhodey. Is five and has taken to Rhodey and Tony like a fish takes to water, referring to them both as their uncles. They\u2019re unsure what happened to his actual family. Has same marks as Rhodey.</li><li><b>Scott</b>: a wolf blood. Has more of a reddish coat despite his dark coloured hair. Very excitable despite the circumstances. He also managed to avoid the facility for most of his life, and even had a daughter at one point before he was taken away. His ex-wife, their daughter, and new husband do come to see hi once a month, even if it\u2019s through zoo like bars.</li><li><b>Hope</b>: Coyote blood. Daughter of hank and was born in captivity. Doesn\u2019t socialise too much but Scott doesn\u2019t leave her alone. Admittedly, she does like to hear him tell her about the outside world.</li><li><b>Hank</b>: Coyote blood. Lost his mate after Hope was born due to the workers separating them to as they didn\u2019t want any more breeding between them. They left Hope to stay with her father and, though heartbroken, he did his best to keep her and look after her.</li><li><b>Pepper</b>: Red fox blood. Certain in herself and, though small, isn\u2019t to be messed with. Hangs out with Tony and Rhodey in the outdoor incloser and protective of her friends. </li><li><b>Bruce</b>: Euroasian lynx blood. Pretty shy and prefers solitude to company and can get snappy if you come into his part of the enclosure without permission. Tony helped him adjust to the facility and sometimes the two spend time with each other chilling outside, though there isn\u2019t a lot of talking. He has dark spots that peppers his light skin.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>There is probably more but that\u2019s all for right now. You guys interested? Might make it A/B/O dynamics too but I\u2019m not quite sure yet. If you are, I\u2019ll try to write something. And it\u2019ll probably be stony.</p><p><br></p><p>But, if you like it, anyone has permission to use this au! Give me credit and tag me/message me because I\u2019d love to see/read what you guys so.

He listened as Tony showered and looked for clothes in the spare bedroom, then the rustling of the sofa blanket as he settled down. Peter\u2019s immediate thought was how Tony shouldn\u2019t be sleeping on the sofa; it was bad for his back, and he\u2019d be in pain when he woke up tomorrow, which in turn made Peter well up with tears at how frighteningly domestic they\u2019d become.\u00a0</p><p>Before he knew what he was doing, Peter was crawling out from under the covers, pulling on one of Tony\u2019s oversized band tees that had been thrown haphazardly over the back of a chair, and was making his way out of the bedroom and into the living room, following the dim blue glow of Tony\u2019s arc reactor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Peter whispered, not wanting to wake the older man.\u00a0\u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>There was a beat of silence, before the lump on the couch sighed, and Tony turned over so he was facing the boy.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter shook his head, wiping fiercely at the tears that tried to spill down his cheeks.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tony, you know I didn\u2019t mean it. I know you\u2019d never cheat on me, but<i> fuck</i> I love you so much and I\u2019m so scared you\u2019ll realise you can have so much better than me and just up and leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never leave you, Peter.\u201d Tony said firmly.\u00a0\u201cI love you too much, I\u2019m too selfish to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have better.\u201d Peter whispered, his voice breaking.\u00a0\u201cYou could have so much better than me\u2026 I\u2019m way too young, so inexperienced in everything, so na\u00efve, insanely paranoid-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Tony snapped.\u00a0\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, just shut up and come here.\u201d</p><p>Tony pulled back the blanket that was draped over him and opened his arms in invitation, and Peter didn\u2019t even think before he was falling into them, sobbing into Tony\u2019s chest as the older man ran soothing hands up and down his back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you for who you are, Peter.\u201d Tony murmured into Peter\u2019s hair.\u00a0\u201cWe just need to figure some things out, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Peter rasped.\u00a0\u201cAre we- are we okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we are, angel.\u201d Tony chuckled.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not happy, don\u2019t get me wrong, and I\u2019ll be moody about it for a while, but we\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes fluttered shut with relief, and before he could think about it, he was tilting his head up, blindly searching for comfort in the warmth of Tony\u2019s lips. Tony knew he should object, keep the kiss chaste and gently push the boy away, but couldn\u2019t resist leaning in, licking into Peter\u2019s soft mouth as the boy whined needily, letting him tangle long, slim fingers in his greying hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter, stop.\u201d Tony panted eventually, tracing gentle fingers down his boyfriend\u2019s soft cheek.\u00a0\u201cWe need to talk first, yeah baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s-.\u201d Peter swallowed, then nodded.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea.\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it the wrong way.\u201d Tony said carefully, assessing Peter\u2019s still teary eyes.\u00a0\u201cGod, it\u2019s so hard to resist you, I just- sex probably isn\u2019t the best way to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I get it Tony, really.\u201d Peter assured. \u201cWill you come back to bed with me?

Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t move, but stayed curled up in the centre of their giant king-sized bed, burying his face in Tony\u2019s cushion, looking for comfort in the lingering smell of his boyfriend. He listened as Tony showered and looked for clothes in the spare bedroom, then the rustling of the sofa blanket as he settled down. Peter\u2019s immediate thought was how Tony shouldn\u2019t be sleeping on the sofa; it was bad for his back, and he\u2019d be in pain when he woke up tomorrow, which in turn made Peter well up with tears at how frighteningly domestic they\u2019d become.\u00a0</p><p>Before he knew what he was doing, Peter was crawling out from under the covers, pulling on one of Tony\u2019s oversized band tees that had been thrown haphazardly over the back of a chair, and was making his way out of the bedroom and into the living room, following the dim blue glow of Tony\u2019s arc reactor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Peter whispered, not wanting to wake the older man.\u00a0\u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>There was a beat of silence, before the lump on the couch sighed, and Tony turned over so he was facing the boy.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter shook his head, wiping fiercely at the tears that tried to spill down his cheeks.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tony, you know I didn\u2019t mean it. I know you\u2019d never cheat on me, but<i> fuck</i> I love you so much and I\u2019m so scared you\u2019ll realise you can have so much better than me and just up and leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never leave you, Peter.\u201d Tony said firmly.\u00a0\u201cI love you too much, I\u2019m too selfish to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have better.\u201d Peter whispered, his voice breaking.\u00a0\u201cYou could have so much better than me\u2026 I\u2019m way too young, so inexperienced in everything, so na\u00efve, insanely paranoid-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Tony snapped.\u00a0\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, just shut up and come here.\u201d</p><p>Tony pulled back the blanket that was draped over him and opened his arms in invitation, and Peter didn\u2019t even think before he was falling into them, sobbing into Tony\u2019s chest as the older man ran soothing hands up and down his back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you for who you are, Peter.\u201d Tony murmured into Peter\u2019s hair.\u00a0\u201cWe just need to figure some things out, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Peter rasped.\u00a0\u201cAre we- are we okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we are, angel.\u201d Tony chuckled.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not happy, don\u2019t get me wrong, and I\u2019ll be moody about it for a while, but we\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes fluttered shut with relief, and before he could think about it, he was tilting his head up, blindly searching for comfort in the warmth of Tony\u2019s lips. Tony knew he should object, keep the kiss chaste and gently push the boy away, but couldn\u2019t resist leaning in, licking into Peter\u2019s soft mouth as the boy whined needily, letting him tangle long, slim fingers in his greying hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter, stop.\u201d Tony panted eventually, tracing gentle fingers down his boyfriend\u2019s soft cheek.\u00a0\u201cWe need to talk first, yeah baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s-.\u201d Peter swallowed, then nodded.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea.\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it the wrong way.\u201d Tony said carefully, assessing Peter\u2019s still teary eyes.\u00a0\u201cGod, it\u2019s so hard to resist you, I just- sex probably isn\u2019t the best way to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I get it Tony, really.\u201d Peter assured. \u201cWill you come back to bed with me? Just cuddle with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tony nodded, shifting slightly.\u00a0\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep without holding you in my arms.\u201d</p>",
