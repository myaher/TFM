For Dany, ash is also linked with sorrow and, first inverted trope, with the mother mourning her dead child:<br/></p><p><i>She could feel the heat inside her, a terrible burning in her womb.

Overall, Dany comes off as the anti-Cinderella of asoiaf. This becomes especially apparent in ADWD, where she\u2019s, essentially, a glorified slave to her duties who dreams of escapes with her \u201cprince charming\u201d, i.e. Daario. This all reach a culmination point when she goes to the \u201cball\u201d, i.e., the grand reopening of the Daznak\u2019s pit. Unlike Cinderella, who\u2019d give anything to attend the ball, Dany would give anything to skip it:<br/></p><p><i>\u201cEven if the pits must open, must Your Grace go yourself?\u201d asked Missandei as she was washing the queen\u2019s hair.</i></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p><i>She would rather have drifted in the fragrant pool all day, eating iced fruit off silver trays and dreaming of a house with a red door, but a queen belongs to her people, not to herself.</i> \u2013 Daenerys, ADWD<br/></p><p>Whereas the ball meant dreams and freedom for Cinderella, for Dany, it\u2019s the perpetuation of a nightmare. They both present themselves at the event under a veil: a literal one for Dany,</p><p><i>\u201cAnd over it, the long red veils.\u201d The veils would keep the wind from blowing sand into her mouth. </i>And the red will hide any blood spatters. \u2013 Daenerys, ADWD<br/></p><p>A metaphorical one for Cinderella, garbed so elegantly that her step mother and half sisters don\u2019t recognize her. This idea of disguise is interesting. For a start, it contrasts with Dany\u2019s refusal to put a veil between herself and Astapor in ASOS. To borrow Clapton\u2019s words on Dany\u2019s white garments in the show, the purpose of the veil is to \u201cremove herself (Dany)\u201d from the situation. Dany\u2019s choice of clothes is a mean of non-attendance, while Cinderella\u2019s costume allows her to go incognito and enjoy the moment. There is the contrasts of colors: Cinderella wears an immaculate, pure white dress (at least in the Disney version), whereas Dany wears yellow silk and a blood-colored veil. Finally, in some versions, the ball attended by Cinderella is a <i>masked </i>ball. This could be significant, since the reopening of the pits prove to be its own kind of masked \u201cball\u201d (and even more so in the show, where the sons of the Harpy creep inside the pits wearing literal masks):<br/></p><p><i>At the base of the Great Pyramid, Ser Barristan awaited them beside an ornate open palanquin, surrounded by Brazen Beasts. Ser Grandfather, Dany thought. Despite his age, he looked tall and handsome in the armor that she\u2019d given him. \u201cI would be happier if you had Unsullied guards about you today, Your Grace,\u201d the old knight said, as Hizdahr went to greet his cousin. \u201cHalf of these Brazen Beasts are untried freedmen.\u201d And the other half are Meereenese of doubtful loyalty, he left unsaid. Selmy mistrusted all the Meereenese, even shavepates.</i><br/></p><p><i><i>\u201cAnd untried they shall remain unless we try them.\u201d</i></i></p><p><i><b><i>\u201cA mask can hide many things, Your Grace. Is the man behind the owl mask the same owl who guarded you yesterday and the day before?</i></b><i> </i></i></p><p><i><i>How can we know?\u201d</i></i></p><p><i><i>\u201cHow should Meereen ever come to trust the Brazen Beasts if I do not? <b>There are good brave men beneath those masks.</b> I put my life into their hands.\u201d</i> - </i>Daenerys, ADWD<br/></p><p><i>Behind the drum marched Brazen Beasts four abreast. Some carried cudgels, others staves; all wore pleated skirts, leathern sandals, and patchwork cloaks sewn from squares of many colors to echo the many-colored bricks of Meereen. <b>Their masks gleamed in the sun: boars and bulls, hawks and herons, lions and tigers and bears, fork-tongued serpents and hideous basilisks</b></i>. \u2013 Daenerys, ADWD<br/></p><p>In fact, some descriptions of the event, when taken by themselves, almost make it sound like there\u2019s an actual ball happening inside the pit:<br/></p><p><i>Across the pit the Graces sat in <b>flowing robes of many colors</b>, clustered around the austere figure of Galazza Galare, who alone amongst them wore the green.</i> \u2013 Daenerys, ADWD<br/></p><p>We could even dig further: <i>dancing</i>, in asoiaf,<i> </i>is often used as a euphemism for <i>dying</i>, or is used in scenes going heavy on the death-related subtext. What do people do in a ball? They dance. What do people do in the pits? They die. <br/></p><p><i>\u201cBarsena is very quick,\u201d Reznak said. \u201c<b>She will dance with the boar, Magnificence, and slice him when he passes near her.</b> He will be awash in blood before he falls, you shall see.\u201d</i> \u2013 Daenerys, ADWD<br/></p><p>Cinderella\u2019s ball is a dream and Dany\u2019s \u201cball\u201d is a nightmare, but both are woken from it, for the twelfth stroke of midnight will lift the charm. Fun fact, if I\u2019m not mistaken, there were twelve fights planned that day: Khrazz, the Spotted Cat, a \u201cLysene youth with long blond hair\u201d, an elephant, a bull, a mock battle, a folly with dwarfs, Barsena, a folly with old women and \u201cthree more matches\u201d, according to Hzdahr\u2026 yup, that makes twelve. Each fight is a \u201cstroke of midnight\u201d for Dany, pulling her from the nightmare, urging her to wake up. At Barsena, she snaps. The charm falls, her carriage turns into a pumpkin and her gown into rags:<br/></p><p><b><i>She lifted her veil and let it flutter away. She took her tokar off as well. The pearls rattled softly against one another as she unwound the silk.</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cKhaleesi? \u201d Irri asked. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cTaking off my floppy ears.\u201d</i></b> \u2013 Daenerys, ADWD<br/></p><p>In her haste to flee, she loses a shoe:</p><p><i>\u201cLet me go!\u201d Dany twisted from his grasp. The world seemed to slow as she cleared the parapet. <b>When she landed in the pit she lost a sandal. Running, she could feel the sand between her toes</b>, hot and rough. Ser Barristan was calling after her.</i> \u2013 Daenerys, ADWD<br/></p><p>The aftermath finds her alone in the grass sea, wearing literal rags (again, not unlike Cinderella), in a dream-like state and wondering what just happened. Unlike Cinderella, Dany has no desire to relive the ball and would much rather stay where she is, with her rags and her animal companion. Both girls experience an unpleasant return to reality. Cinderella must go back to being a slave to her step-mother and half-sister, while Dany knows she must go back to Meereen (which doesn\u2019t quite work out, but). \u00a0 </p><figure data-orig-width=\"521\" data-orig-height=\"158\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac30ba2bd26e90046e67b6037880d1f3/tumblr_inline_pncjp3gCZ71vdv8tx_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"521\" data-orig-height=\"158\"/></figure><p>Yet for everything nightmarish about it, the reopening of the fighting pits meant something Dany deeply dreamed for and desired: peace. No more bloodshed in the streets of Meereen. The safety of her people. She wanted it and she got it, until the whole farce blew up in her face and the pit of Daznak turned into a pumpkin. I think that\u2019s when she realized it: that the peace was never real, that Hizdahr\u2019s \u201cpeace\u201d was an illusion (as many before me have pointed out), a veil that got lifted with the twelve death blows of the pit. </p>",

Dany\u2019s choice of clothes is a mean of non-attendance, while Cinderella\u2019s costume allows her to go incognito and enjoy the moment. There is the contrasts of colors: Cinderella wears an immaculate, pure white dress (at least in the Disney version), whereas Dany wears yellow silk and a blood-colored veil. Finally, in some versions, the ball attended by Cinderella is a <i>masked </i>ball. This could be significant, since the reopening of the pits prove to be its own kind of masked \u201cball\u201d (and even more so in the show, where the sons of the Harpy creep inside the pits wearing literal masks):<br></p><p><i>At the base of the Great Pyramid, Ser Barristan awaited them beside an ornate open palanquin, surrounded by Brazen Beasts.

Each fight is a \u201cstroke of midnight\u201d for Dany, pulling her from the nightmare, urging her to wake up. At Barsena, she snaps. The charm falls, her carriage turns into a pumpkin and her gown into rags:<br></p><p><b><i>She lifted her veil and let it flutter away. She took her tokar off as well.

Some carried cudgels, others staves; all wore pleated skirts, leathern sandals, and patchwork cloaks sewn from squares of many colors to echo the many-colored bricks of Meereen. <b>Their masks gleamed in the sun: boars and bulls, hawks and herons, lions and tigers and bears, fork-tongued serpents and hideous basilisks</b></i>. &ndash; Daenerys, ADWD<br /></p><p>In fact, some descriptions of the event, when taken by themselves, almost make it sound like there&rsquo;s an actual ball happening inside the pit:<br /></p><p><i>Across the pit the Graces sat in <b>flowing robes of many colors</b>, clustered around the austere figure of Galazza Galare, who alone amongst them wore the green.</i> &ndash; Daenerys, ADWD<br /></p><p>We could even dig further: <i>dancing</i>, in asoiaf,<i> </i>is often used as a euphemism for <i>dying</i>, or is used in scenes going heavy on the death-related subtext. What do people do in a ball? They dance. What do people do in the pits? They die. <br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Barsena is very quick,&rdquo; Reznak said. &ldquo;<b>She will dance with the boar, Magnificence, and slice him when he passes near her.</b> He will be awash in blood before he falls, you shall see.&rdquo;</i> &ndash; Daenerys, ADWD<br /></p><p>Cinderella&rsquo;s ball is a dream and Dany&rsquo;s &ldquo;ball&rdquo; is a nightmare, but both are woken from it, for the twelfth stroke of midnight will lift the charm. Fun fact, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, there were twelve fights planned that day: Khrazz, the Spotted Cat, a &ldquo;Lysene youth with long blond hair&rdquo;, an elephant, a bull, a mock battle, a folly with dwarfs, Barsena, a folly with old women and &ldquo;three more matches&rdquo;, according to Hzdahr&hellip; yup, that makes twelve. Each fight is a &ldquo;stroke of midnight&rdquo; for Dany, pulling her from the nightmare, urging her to wake up. At Barsena, she snaps. The charm falls, her carriage turns into a pumpkin and her gown into rags:<br /></p><p><b><i>She lifted her veil and let it flutter away. She took her tokar off as well. The pearls rattled softly against one another as she unwound the silk.</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Khaleesi? &rdquo; Irri asked. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Taking off my floppy ears.&rdquo;</i></b> &ndash; Daenerys, ADWD<br /></p><p>In her haste to flee, she loses a shoe:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; Dany twisted from his grasp. The world seemed to slow as she cleared the parapet. <b>When she landed in the pit she lost a sandal. Running, she could feel the sand between her toes</b>, hot and rough. Ser Barristan was calling after her.</i> &ndash; Daenerys, ADWD<br /></p><p>The aftermath finds her alone in the grass sea, wearing literal rags (again, not unlike Cinderella), in a dream-like state and wondering what just happened. Unlike Cinderella, Dany has no desire to relive the ball and would much rather stay where she is, with her rags and her animal companion. Both girls experience an unpleasant return to reality. Cinderella must go back to being a slave to her step-mother and half-sister, while Dany knows she must go back to Meereen (which doesn&rsquo;t quite work out, but). &nbsp; </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac30ba2bd26e90046e67b6037880d1f3/tumblr_inline_pncjp3gCZ71vdv8tx_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Yet for everything nightmarish about it, the reopening of the fighting pits meant something Dany deeply dreamed for and desired: peace. No more bloodshed in the streets of Meereen. The safety of her people. She wanted it and she got it, until the whole farce blew up in her face and the pit of Daznak turned into a pumpkin. I think that&rsquo;s when she realized it: that the peace was never real, that Hizdahr&rsquo;s &ldquo;peace&rdquo; was an illusion (as many before me have pointed out), a veil that got lifted with the twelve death blows of the pit. </p></p>",

        "body": "<p>Full disclosure I still kind of want Dany to be the last boss at the end of Game of Thrones but I have come to accept that this is highly unlikely to happen. This does make me sad because she would make a brilliant villain - what a twist it could have been. Oh well.</p><p>Episode 1.</p><p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t your sister like me&hellip;burn them all.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m kidding. Mostly. But is will find it hard to understand why no one in the north is willing to accept her. I think she genuinely thinks that it was just Jon&rsquo;s pride holding him back from accepting her and that once she is there the Northerners will come around. They really won&rsquo;t. If they do then we should congratulate on winning Mary Sue of the year award. But most of the first 2 episodes will be the North rejecting her in various subtle and less subtle ways. This will initially include both Stark sisters though they will warm up to her eventually. </p><p>It will be like a bucket of cold water over all her dreams as this will be the first time she will have been amongst the actual people she is trying to conquer without actively setting them on fire and they don&rsquo;t want her. To make matters worse she will then have to deal with the information that no she wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;born to rule the Seven Kingdoms&rdquo; as she will discover either at the end of episode 1 or the beginning of episode 2 that she just shagged her nephew and he is ahead of her\u00a0in the line of succession. Hard times ahead for the Mother of Dragons.</p><p>Episode 2.</p><p>Things are going to get worse before they get better as not only does she have the fall out of last episode to deal with but this is likely where she meets Arya. Who unlike Sansa is not going to hold back for political reasons. She will likely test her in some way not unlike how she tested Sansa last season. Lets hope Arya doesn&rsquo;t know at this point that Dany burned Sam&rsquo;s dad and brother as she is the kind of person who takes real offense when you harm her friends or Jon&rsquo;s friends. I don&rsquo;t believe she would threaten her (overtly) or hurt but she might very well be the sister who rejects her the most out of the 2. </p><p>This will also likely be where Dany learns she is pregnant if she is going to be preggers this season. This is hopefully going to be a point where we can get some really good character development for her as a character. She could be in one of her lowest points of the season. learn she valuable lessons and finally stop with this irritating divine right of kings crap which pisses me of to no end. Or she just shakes it off and learns nothing of value or merit like all of last seasons hardships. Mary Sue of the year 2 years in a row guys - this girl can&rsquo;t be stopped. I really hope they use the fact that they have 2 episodes before the first big battle to add all of this interesting character stuff - with 60 minute episodes and only 2 main locations what the hell else are they going to do. </p><p>Oh and blah blah they all prepare of the white walkers attacking - I am not saying this every time since so many of the characters overlap there is no point. </p><p>Anyway Jon will go to her and his BSOD has ended and confirm he isn&rsquo;t interested in the throne but he is not really going to understand why this information effects her so much. So much of her sense of worth is based on that belief in her destiny, in that list of extra names she has behind her own name and it is going to be very hard for her (hopefully) to come to terms with this. This is something she will have to do alone and effectively this is where her and Jons relationship ends (for now). The white walkers are attacking - quick someone erect the pillow fort.</p><p>Episode 3.</p><p>So normally this would be Dany giving aerial support while there is fighting on the ground. However I think she will be grounded during this fight for either 1 of 2 reasons. The first - she goes to fight and someone rats her out - pregnant women are not allowed to lead aerial assaults Dany (give her time) or 2 she begins to fight but due to how distracted she is she is injured and this takes her out of the fight. Hopefully neither of these scenarios lead to Drogons death. I highly doubt it as this is only\u00a0episode 3 but it can&rsquo;t be discounted remember everyone can die guys. She will have her moment of character arc culmination from the last episode where she is the one who suggests Jon ride Rhaegal and show him how\u00a0to do this. This will likely be where she and Sansa come to terms as well. Arya is warming up to her as well but as I mentioned in Arya&rsquo;s post her little strike force will be out trying to\u00a0save Winter Town.\u00a0I do want her to see Arya in a fight though because I feel these 2 will be able to fully appreciate each other when they both recognise the strengths and weaknesses of the other person. Again mirroring the Sansa/Arya bits from last season but we are on a time crunch guys. She will be very upset about not being able to help and so will likely be trying to do what she can from the ground much likely Sansa - again showing these 2 connecting. Eventually the battle concludes and oh no your princess was in another castle guys - the Night King wasn&rsquo;t there. But there were a lot of lost lives in this battle.</p><p>Episode 4.</p><p>No Jon you aren&rsquo;t going to King&rsquo;s Landing - that is a terrible idea. Aaaaannnndd captured. This is where I expect the full Arya/Dany stuff to kick in - I haven&rsquo;t mentioned before but there will also likely be a short time skip at this point - if Dany is pregnant this will be shown by a large lump suddenly being attached to the actresses stomach. Anyway he gets caught and Arya is obviously the one sent to save him. If Dany has seen her fight she will be fully on board with this - if not she will be sceptical but willing to do whatever it takes. This is also where Dany will be finally able to accept the truth about Jon and she and Sansa will now be the ones in charge of the army of the living each using their own strengths to lead them. Oh and Bran will hopefully still be there giving info.</p><p>Episode 5 and 6.</p><p>Big fight -\u00a0good guys win\u00a0- yay. Honestly I really can&rsquo;t figure out much about these 2 episodes as we learn more and the season progresses I think this will become more clear but for now it&rsquo;s just the same as the other 2 posts. Jon and Dany come to terms and marry. Politically no one will accept it and they have to add Arya into the mix - none of the 3 are happy but are willing to accept it. Dany is the most ok with it as, you know, Targaryen.\u00a0Everything ends\u00a0on\u00a0a reasonably happy note.</p><p>Or does it - alternate theory - humour me guys - I just really\u00a0wanted her to be a villain.</p><p>She is never fully able to accept Jon is the\u00a0heir slowly this knowledge eats away at\u00a0her sanity and eventually she snaps and \u00a0embracing the madness that haunts her family torches the Red Keep and everyone inside. Jon has to fight her dragon to dragon and they both plummet to their deaths. Instead of the Targaryens a new rule is created using the idea from the ancient Roman Triumvirates and 3 people are in charge. Arya, Sansa and Bran/Gendry/Jon (if he survives)/Tyrion/build your own adventure. You never know.</p>",

This does make me sad because she would make a brilliant villain - what a twist it could have been. Oh well.</p><p>Episode 1.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t your sister like me\u2026burn them all.\u201d I\u2019m kidding. Mostly. But is will find it hard to understand why no one in the north is willing to accept her. I think she genuinely thinks that it was just Jon\u2019s pride holding him back from accepting her and that once she is there the Northerners will come around. They really won\u2019t. If they do then we should congratulate on winning Mary Sue of the year award. But most of the first 2 episodes will be the North rejecting her in various subtle and less subtle ways. This will initially include both Stark sisters though they will warm up to her eventually. </p><p>It will be like a bucket of cold water over all her dreams as this will be the first time she will have been amongst the actual people she is trying to conquer without actively setting them on fire and they don\u2019t want her. To make matters worse she will then have to deal with the information that no she wasn\u2019t \u201cborn to rule the Seven Kingdoms\u201d as she will discover either at the end of episode 1 or the beginning of episode 2 that she just shagged her nephew and he is ahead of her\u00a0in the line of succession. Hard times ahead for the Mother of Dragons.</p><p>Episode 2.</p><p>Things are going to get worse before they get better as not only does she have the fall out of last episode to deal with but this is likely where she meets Arya. Who unlike Sansa is not going to hold back for political reasons. She will likely test her in some way not unlike how she tested Sansa last season. Lets hope Arya doesn\u2019t know at this point that Dany burned Sam\u2019s dad and brother as she is the kind of person who takes real offense when you harm her friends or Jon\u2019s friends. I don\u2019t believe she would threaten her (overtly) or hurt but she might very well be the sister who rejects her the most out of the 2. </p><p>This will also likely be where Dany learns she is pregnant if she is going to be preggers this season. This is hopefully going to be a point where we can get some really good character development for her as a character. She could be in one of her lowest points of the season. learn she valuable lessons and finally stop with this irritating divine right of kings crap which pisses me of to no end. Or she just shakes it off and learns nothing of value or merit like all of last seasons hardships. Mary Sue of the year 2 years in a row guys - this girl can\u2019t be stopped. I really hope they use the fact that they have 2 episodes before the first big battle to add all of this interesting character stuff - with 60 minute episodes and only 2 main locations what the hell else are they going to do. </p><p>Oh and blah blah they all prepare of the white walkers attacking - I am not saying this every time since so many of the characters overlap there is no point. </p><p>Anyway Jon will go to her and his BSOD has ended and confirm he isn\u2019t interested in the throne but he is not really going to understand why this information effects her so much. So much of her sense of worth is based on that belief in her destiny, in that list of extra names she has behind her own name and it is going to be very hard for her (hopefully) to come to terms with this. This is something she will have to do alone and effectively this is where her and Jons relationship ends (for now). The white walkers are attacking - quick someone erect the pillow fort.</p><p>Episode 3.</p><p>So normally this would be Dany giving aerial support while there is fighting on the ground. However I think she will be grounded during this fight for either 1 of 2 reasons. The first - she goes to fight and someone rats her out - pregnant women are not allowed to lead aerial assaults Dany (give her time) or 2 she begins to fight but due to how distracted she is she is injured and this takes her out of the fight. Hopefully neither of these scenarios lead to Drogons death. I highly doubt it as this is only\u00a0episode 3 but it can\u2019t be discounted remember everyone can die guys. She will have her moment of character arc culmination from the last episode where she is the one who suggests Jon ride Rhaegal and show him how\u00a0to do this. This will likely be where she and Sansa come to terms as well. Arya is warming up to her as well but as I mentioned in Arya\u2019s post her little strike force will be out trying to\u00a0save Winter Town.\u00a0I do want her to see Arya in a fight though because I feel these 2 will be able to fully appreciate each other when they both recognise the strengths and weaknesses of the other person. Again mirroring the Sansa/Arya bits from last season but we are on a time crunch guys. She will be very upset about not being able to help and so will likely be trying to do what she can from the ground much likely Sansa - again showing these 2 connecting. Eventually the battle concludes and oh no your princess was in another castle guys - the Night King wasn\u2019t there. But there were a lot of lost lives in this battle.</p><p>Episode 4.</p><p>No Jon you aren\u2019t going to King\u2019s Landing - that is a terrible idea. Aaaaannnndd captured. This is where I expect the full Arya/Dany stuff to kick in - I haven\u2019t mentioned before but there will also likely be a short time skip at this point - if Dany is pregnant this will be shown by a large lump suddenly being attached to the actresses stomach. Anyway he gets caught and Arya is obviously the one sent to save him. If Dany has seen her fight she will be fully on board with this - if not she will be sceptical but willing to do whatever it takes. This is also where Dany will be finally able to accept the truth about Jon and she and Sansa will now be the ones in charge of the army of the living each using their own strengths to lead them. Oh and Bran will hopefully still be there giving info.</p><p>Episode 5 and 6.</p><p>Big fight -\u00a0good guys win\u00a0- yay. Honestly I really can\u2019t figure out much about these 2 episodes as we learn more and the season progresses I think this will become more clear but for now it\u2019s just the same as the other 2 posts. Jon and Dany come to terms and marry. Politically no one will accept it and they have to add Arya into the mix - none of the 3 are happy but are willing to accept it. Dany is the most ok with it as, you know, Targaryen.\u00a0Everything ends\u00a0on\u00a0a reasonably happy note.</p><p>Or does it - alternate theory - humour me guys - I just really\u00a0wanted her to be a villain.</p><p>She is never fully able to accept Jon is the\u00a0heir slowly this knowledge eats away at\u00a0her sanity and eventually she snaps and \u00a0embracing the madness that haunts her family torches the Red Keep and everyone inside. Jon has to fight her dragon to dragon and they both plummet to their deaths. Instead of the Targaryens a new rule is created using the idea from the ancient Roman Triumvirates and 3 people are in charge. Arya, Sansa and Bran/Gendry/Jon (if he survives)/Tyrion/build your own adventure. You never know.</p>",

They would prefer a beheading over it for sure. </p><p>I just watched episode 1 of season 2 when one of the bloodrider&rsquo;s severed Head returns to Dany and one of the Dothraki cries and says that they&rsquo;ve killed his soul bc they butchered him like an animal and didn&rsquo;t burn the body. </p><p>So I&rsquo;m not saying burning people alive is okay, but for a long time I&rsquo;ve thought the Dothraki had a HUGE impact on Dany more than is talked about. She was raised with them practically - the first people she ever led and knew, the first home she had really. Some of her decisions that seem very cruel prob don&rsquo;t upset the Dothraki in fact they could be praised and seen as shows of strength by the Dothraki, who make up the majority of her forces unless I&rsquo;m incorrect. 100k? </p><p>The dragons, the fire are the reasons why they followed her to begin with, and her riding a dragon parallels a khal riding a horse nicely. Daenerys killing by fire is keeping souls intact to the Dothraki. </p><p>She promised the khalasar that they could conquer Westeros and with this comes rape, pillage, etc. Thats their way of life. Does she even have a long term plan for them? For how to give them a better life or are they just pawns in her play for the throne she&rsquo;s always wanted? </p><p>She should be a Khaleesi. She truly doesn&rsquo;t understand the Westerosi people she now wants to conquer. IMO she can&rsquo;t be both a good Khaleesi and a good Queen. </p></p>",

And when he said to Dany, they will see her for what she is, apparently he coming back to his senses after facing death once again, and he actually means that they will see her as a mad queen that she is. He only sleeps with her bc he cannot back off and tried to manipulate her instead. Guess from who s fandom",
