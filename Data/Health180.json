                "content": "<p>Adjust up your health.\n<br />\n  The cataloguing of suspected benefits is long: It can soothe infants and adults alike, trigger memories, equanimity pain, uphold sleep and make the heart beat faster or slower. &ldquo;it,&rdquo; of course, is music.  A growing body of inquire into has been making such suggestions for years <a href=\"http://malemix.icu/\">check this out</a>. Just why music seems to have these effects, though, remains elusive.\n<br /><br />\nThere&rsquo;s a lot to learn, said Robert Zatorre, a professor at McGill University in Montreal, where he studies the thesis at the Montreal Neurological Institute <a href=\"http://vigrxforce.men/sex-with-pregnancy-kesay-sahi-rhay-gi.html\" title=\"sex with pregnancy kesay sahi rhay gi\">sex with pregnancy kesay sahi rhay gi</a>. Music has been shown to balm with such things as pain and reminiscence but &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know for sure that it does improve our (overall) health&rdquo;.\n<br /><br />\nAnd though there are some indications that music can alter both the body and the mind, &ldquo;whether it translates to health benefits is still being studied&rdquo;. In one study, Zatorre and his colleagues found that commoners who rated music they listened to as pleasurable were more likely to report emotional arousal than those who didn&rsquo;t take pleasure in the music they were listening to <a href=\"http://extenders.us/mobile/\" title=\"mobile\">mobile</a>. Those findings were published in October in PLoS One.\n<br /><br />\nFrom the scientists&rsquo; point of view &ldquo;it&rsquo;s one thing if people say, &lsquo;When I listen to this music, I taste it.&rsquo; But it doesn&rsquo;t tell what&rsquo;s happening with their body.&rdquo; Researchers necessity to prove that music not only has an effect, but that the effect translates to health benefits long-term.\n<br /><br />\nOne suspect to be answered is whether emotions that are stirred up by music really affect people physiologically, said Dr. Michael Miller, a professor of medicament and director of the Center for Preventive Cardiology at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore.\n<br /><br />\nFor instance, Miller said he&rsquo;s found that listening to self-selected joyous music can uplift blood flow and perhaps promote vascular health. So, if it calms someone and improves their blood flow, will that transport to fewer heart attacks? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s yet to be studied&rdquo;.\n<br /><br />\nBut in a assignment published in the November issue of Medical Hypotheses, Miller suggested the way by which emotions - such as those triggered when listening to a favorite consonance - might influence the heart. &ldquo;Endorphins or endorphin-like compounds are released from the knowledge in response to pleasurable emotions&rdquo;.\n<br /><br />\nSo &ldquo;That directly activates the endorphins to manumission nitric oxide. It&rsquo;s a protective chemical, one of the important chemicals produced by the endothelium (the inner lining of the blood vessels).\n<br /><br />\nIt&rsquo;s well-connected in biological and physiological functions - it causes blood vessels to dilate, it reduces inflammation, it prevents platelets from sticking and cholesterol from being captivated up into plaque&rdquo;. But that might be just business of the story. C &ldquo;There are likely to be other effects that have been in great part unexplored&rdquo;.\n<br /><br />\nStress reduction that results from listening to good music might also explain the health benefits, said Aniruddh Patel, a ranking fellow at the Neuroscience Institute in San Diego. &ldquo;Music is known to modify people&rsquo;s stress and actually have physiological effects on the stress hormone cortisol&rdquo;.\n<br /><br />\nIn a think over in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, music was reported to help people who&rsquo;d had a mark recover their sight, and Patel said that makes sense. &ldquo;The brain is trying to put itself. The less stress hormone floating around up there, the better the brain can do its job&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s c why it worked.\n<br /><br />\nAnd as studies continue to find additional benefits from music, scientists continue to explore the underpinnings. &ldquo;We have a trickle of information now about how it works. I think this is a growing area.\n<br /><br />\nThat drip is going to become a stream, and that stream is going to become a river&rdquo; <a href=\"http://vitohealth.men/shopping/\" title=\"shopping\">shopping</a>.

I definitely didn\u2019t intend to step away from blogging for a full week but I didn\u2019t want to isolate myself on my laptop or look through my phone when I was surrounded by family so an unintended break ended up happening. I missed you guys but the break was good for me! It allowed me to feel fully present as a mom, daughter, sister and mother and I didn\u2019t realize how much I needed to disconnect.</p>\n<p>Since I missed blogging all week, today\u2019s Things I\u2019m Loving Friday post serves almost more as a catch up recap with a few favorites thrown in the mix. It\u2019s a little different than usual, but hopefully it works!</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking in today and I really hope these past few days were filled with friends, family, love, gratitude and good food for all of you. Also, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I hope that you all know just how grateful I am for each and every one of you. I am under no delusion that my blog would be anything without your support, your readership, your participation and your kindness. I\u2019m grateful for our friendship because that\u2019s truly what I feel from you when I read your comments, emails and messages. You\u2019ve lifted me up when I\u2019ve been down and cheered me on through some of the best moments of my life and that\u2019s not lost on me for one second.</p>\n<p>I am so thankful for YOU.</p>\n<h4>Things I\u2019m Loving Friday</h4>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>First Solo Flight with Chase and Ryder</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84362\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\"/></a></p>\n<p>First, I need to preface this\u00a0 bulletpoint by saying that travel with kids is far from stress-free! Going into my first solo flight with Chase and Ryder, I kept my expectations LOW. I wasn\u2019t sure how the experience would unfold but ended up feeling grateful we made it to Florida without too many hiccups.</p>\n<p>The best part of our travel south was the fact that Chase was in HEAVEN all morning. He\u2019s airplane-obsessed at the moment so everything from going through security and handing the TSA agent his very own ticket (and earning a sticker!) to the pilot of our flight inviting him into the cockpit absolutely made his day. He had a window seat on the plane\u2019s wing which blew his mind and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him ask more questions in my life. (We talked a lot about \u201cinside voices\u201d on this flight. Ha!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84361\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394.jpg 1512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Ryder fought his morning nap all through the airport but once I swaddled him up in my arms and nursed him on the flight, he slept most of the time which was a huge blessing. (The fact that the flight was only an hour long was another blessing.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5984.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84363 \" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5984-e1542935626233-769x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5984-e1542935626233-769x1024.jpg 769w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5984-e1542935626233-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5984-e1542935626233-768x1022.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5984-e1542935626233.jpg 1160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\"/></a></p>\n<p>I am crossing my fingers for a smooth flight home tomorrow as well!</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Callie Snuggles and Cousin Time</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6044.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84365\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6044.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"528\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6044.jpg 918w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6044-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6044-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6044-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6044-450x450.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\"/></a></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been living for the picture and video updates of Callie I receive all day every day from my sister and mother but nothing can even come close to seeing my sweet niece in person. Callie napped in my arms for a solid 40 minutes the first time I held her and I found myself studying her beautiful face and holding onto her teeny little legs and soaking up every bit of her sweetness. Our whole family is so glad she\u2019s home and so, so grateful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0175.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84354\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0175-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"508\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0175-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0175-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0175-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0175-768x767.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0175-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0175.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Chase was also really excited to finally meet his baby cousin and he\u2019s been very into her and wants to help with everything.

My sister actually snapped the below picture of me and the boys (Chase is playing with cars behind Ryan\u2019s chair) and it made me laugh when I saw it because it was about 30 minutes after our feast and Ryan and I were \u201cdigesting\u201d on the floor.

I definitely didn\u2019t intend to step away from blogging for a full week but I didn\u2019t want to isolate myself on my laptop or look through my phone when I was surrounded by family so an unintended break ended up happening. I missed you guys but the break was good for me! It allowed me to feel fully present as a mom, daughter, sister and mother and I didn\u2019t realize how much I needed to disconnect.</p>\n<p>Since I missed blogging all week, today\u2019s Things I\u2019m Loving Friday post serves almost more as a catch up recap with a few favorites thrown in the mix. It\u2019s a little different than usual, but hopefully it works!</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking in today and I really hope these past few days were filled with friends, family, love, gratitude and good food for all of you. Also, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I hope that you all know just how grateful I am for each and every one of you. I am under no delusion that my blog would be anything without your support, your readership, your participation and your kindness. I\u2019m grateful for our friendship because that\u2019s truly what I feel from you when I read your comments, emails and messages. You\u2019ve lifted me up when I\u2019ve been down and cheered me on through some of the best moments of my life and that\u2019s not lost on me for one second.</p>\n<p>I am so thankful for YOU.</p>\n<h4>Things I\u2019m Loving Friday</h4>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>First Solo Flight with Chase and Ryder</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84362\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\"></a></p>\n<p>First, I need to preface this\u00a0 bulletpoint by saying that travel with kids is far from stress-free! Going into my first solo flight with Chase and Ryder, I kept my expectations LOW. I wasn\u2019t sure how the experience would unfold but ended up feeling grateful we made it to Florida without too many hiccups.</p>\n<p>The best part of our travel south was the fact that Chase was in HEAVEN all morning. He\u2019s airplane-obsessed at the moment so everything from going through security and handing the TSA agent his very own ticket (and earning a sticker!) to the pilot of our flight inviting him into the cockpit absolutely made his day. He had a window seat on the plane\u2019s wing which blew his mind and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him ask more questions in my life. (We talked a lot about \u201cinside voices\u201d on this flight. Ha!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84361\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394.jpg 1512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\"></a></p>\n<p>Ryder fought his morning nap all through the airport but once I swaddled him up in my arms and nursed him on the flight, he slept most of the time which was a huge blessing.

I definitely didn\u2019t intend to step away from blogging for a full week but I didn\u2019t want to isolate myself on my laptop or look through my phone when I was surrounded by family so an unintended break ended up happening. I missed you guys but the break was good for me! It allowed me to feel fully present as a mom, daughter, sister and mother and I didn\u2019t realize how much I needed to disconnect.</p>\n<p>Since I missed blogging all week, today\u2019s Things I\u2019m Loving Friday post serves almost more as a catch up recap with a few favorites thrown in the mix. It\u2019s a little different than usual, but hopefully it works!</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking in today and I really hope these past few days were filled with friends, family, love, gratitude and good food for all of you. Also, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I hope that you all know just how grateful I am for each and every one of you. I am under no delusion that my blog would be anything without your support, your readership, your participation and your kindness. I\u2019m grateful for our friendship because that\u2019s truly what I feel from you when I read your comments, emails and messages. You\u2019ve lifted me up when I\u2019ve been down and cheered me on through some of the best moments of my life and that\u2019s not lost on me for one second.</p>\n<p>I am so thankful for YOU.</p>\n<h4>Things I\u2019m Loving Friday</h4>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>First Solo Flight with Chase and Ryder</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84362\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\"></a></p>\n<p>First, I need to preface this\u00a0 bulletpoint by saying that travel with kids is far from stress-free! Going into my first solo flight with Chase and Ryder, I kept my expectations LOW. I wasn\u2019t sure how the experience would unfold but ended up feeling grateful we made it to Florida without too many hiccups.</p>\n<p>The best part of our travel south was the fact that Chase was in HEAVEN all morning. He\u2019s airplane-obsessed at the moment so everything from going through security and handing the TSA agent his very own ticket (and earning a sticker!) to the pilot of our flight inviting him into the cockpit absolutely made his day. He had a window seat on the plane\u2019s wing which blew his mind and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him ask more questions in my life. (We talked a lot about \u201cinside voices\u201d on this flight. Ha!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84361\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394.jpg 1512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\"></a></p>\n<p>Ryder fought his morning nap all through the airport but once I swaddled him up in my arms and nursed him on the flight, he slept most of the time which was a huge blessing.

I definitely didn&rsquo;t intend to step away from blogging for a full week but I didn&rsquo;t want to isolate myself on my laptop or look through my phone when I was surrounded by family so an unintended break ended up happening. I missed you guys but the break was good for me! It allowed me to feel fully present as a mom, daughter, sister and mother and I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I needed to disconnect.</p>\n<p>Since I missed blogging all week, today&rsquo;s Things I&rsquo;m Loving Friday post serves almost more as a catch up recap with a few favorites thrown in the mix. It&rsquo;s a little different than usual, but hopefully it works!</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking in today and I really hope these past few days were filled with friends, family, love, gratitude and good food for all of you. Also, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I hope that you all know just how grateful I am for each and every one of you. I am under no delusion that my blog would be anything without your support, your readership, your participation and your kindness. I&rsquo;m grateful for our friendship because that&rsquo;s truly what I feel from you when I read your comments, emails and messages. You&rsquo;ve lifted me up when I&rsquo;ve been down and cheered me on through some of the best moments of my life and that&rsquo;s not lost on me for one second.</p>\n<p>I am so thankful for YOU.</p>\n<h4>Things I&rsquo;m Loving Friday</h4>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>First Solo Flight with Chase and Ryder</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5982-576x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>First, I need to preface this&nbsp; bulletpoint by saying that travel with kids is far from stress-free! Going into my first solo flight with Chase and Ryder, I kept my expectations LOW. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how the experience would unfold but ended up feeling grateful we made it to Florida without too many hiccups.</p>\n<p>The best part of our travel south was the fact that Chase was in HEAVEN all morning. He&rsquo;s airplane-obsessed at the moment so everything from going through security and handing the TSA agent his very own ticket (and earning a sticker!) to the pilot of our flight inviting him into the cockpit absolutely made his day. He had a window seat on the plane&rsquo;s wing which blew his mind and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard him ask more questions in my life. (We talked a lot about &ldquo;inside voices&rdquo; on this flight. Ha!)</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5973-e1542935408394-768x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Ryder fought his morning nap all through the airport but once I swaddled him up in my arms and nursed him on the flight, he slept most of the time which was a huge blessing. (The fact that the flight was only an hour long was another blessing.)</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5984-e1542935626233-769x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>I am crossing my fingers for a smooth flight home tomorrow as well!</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Callie Snuggles and Cousin Time</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_6044.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been living for the picture and video updates of Callie I receive all day every day from my sister and mother but nothing can even come close to seeing my sweet niece in person. Callie napped in my arms for a solid 40 minutes the first time I held her and I found myself studying her beautiful face and holding onto her teeny little legs and soaking up every bit of her sweetness. Our whole family is so glad she&rsquo;s home and so, so grateful.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0175-1024x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Chase was also really excited to finally meet his baby cousin and he&rsquo;s been very into her and wants to help with everything.
