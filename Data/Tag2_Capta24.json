It\u2019s just accepted as a male trait.</p><p>Then you have a female superhero/character like Carol Danvers, who HAS EARNED the right to be confident a thousand times over in her life. She carries herself with the cockiness and swagger of someone who has achieved greatness in everything she\u2019s ever set her mind to. Yeah, she\u2019s been told no A LOT. She\u2019s fallen down so many times but she always gets\u00a0up. And her first impulse is always to help people without considering how it would reflect on her. She makes fun of herself as much as she pokes fun at anyone else. She knows her worth, and it took her a while to get there&hellip; to know that she had to do things her own way because the world didn\u2019t want to see her succeed. But she succeeded anyway by learning how to trust in herself. So yeah, Carol is cocky and she deserves to be because she\u2019s EARNED IT. And even if she hadn\u2019t, would you question the cockiness of a male character in the same position? It reminds me of people calling Rey a Mary Sue despite the fact that there is loads of canon evidence to back up WHY she is so good at so many things. (Plus all it really takes is some critical thinking when you realize the girl had to learn these things in order to SURVIVE ON HER OWN ON A DESERT PLANET FOR OVER A DECADE!) Yet no one ever calls Anakin a Mary Sue. I mean, all of this might not be an issue if so many of you would stop being\u00a0\u201cfake fans\u201d and read the additional canon material that expands upon the characters but noooo. ;)</p>",

                "content": "<p>Hi anon! Thanks for the prompt! i&rsquo;m not entirely happy with this, but I hope you will like it :)</p><p><b>Carol x Maria</b>, Captain Marvel; on <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F19004671%2Fchapters%2F45363841%23workskin&amp;t=NjVlMzMyZTg3ODQwYTU1NTg4OGU4NGY2MjZlZjliOTM1ZGQyYWZlMixiZWI2NWNhYWRiMzkxMjcwODA3MDU2ZjI0OGE0MGI2NDQxMDExYWEw\">AO3</a></p><p>.</p><p>They&rsquo;re</p><p>sitting at the kitchen table and the emergency kit Maria always keeps around</p><p>has seen better days &ndash; they both use it much more than she would like.</p><p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo;</p><p>Carol yelps in surprise. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would sting that much&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes</p><p>well, you did fight a guy twice your size&rdquo; is the snarky reply she gets for her</p><p>suffering.</p><p>&ldquo;That</p><p>asshole called one of his buddy to overpower me&rdquo;, she grumbles, flinching away</p><p>when Maria reaches out to disinfect her wound.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes</p><p>I know love, but you gotta hold still. Wouldn&rsquo;t want the mighty Avenger to die</p><p>from infection, would we?&rdquo;</p><p>But</p><p>Carol won&rsquo;t &ndash; probably doesn&rsquo;t even <i>know</i></p><p>how to &ndash; stay still. Maria would gladly let her go if Carol hadn&rsquo;t several deep</p><p>cuts on her face that <i>definitely</i> need</p><p>to be tended to.</p><p>&ldquo;Not</p><p>much of an avenger when I get beaten up&rdquo; Carol answers bitterly, looking down &ndash;</p><p>once again moving her head.</p><p>Maria</p><p>has had enough, and catches Carol&rsquo;s chin to keep her in place.</p><p>But</p><p>in doing so, her thumb lands right besides Carol&rsquo;s lips, and they both stop</p><p>moving to stare at each other. She should move, she knows, but all she wants to</p><p>do is to caress those lips that have been tempting her for months. All she</p><p>wants to do is <i>kiss</i> Carol. She wishes</p><p>Carol would lean in, kiss her palm, kiss <i>her</i>.</p><p>She</p><p>manages to break the spell - breaking eye contact, and puts some more</p><p>disinfectant on the cotton she uses to dab Carol&rsquo;s cuts. She thinks back to</p><p>what she wanted to say before having a mini-meltdown while staring into her</p><p>best-friend&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>She</p><p>continues cleaning the cuts.</p><p>&ldquo;Carol,</p><p>I appreciate what you were trying to do, but don&rsquo;t do that again. Ever.</p><p>Please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People</p><p>are going to talk. You&rsquo;re only giving them more reason to talk when you punch</p><p>them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So</p><p>I&rsquo;m just supposed to let them talk?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Carol,</p><p>I&rsquo;m a black woman in America. I&rsquo;ve been called way worse than that. In the army</p><p>and elsewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol</p><p>catches her hand, the one still holding Carol&rsquo;s jaw, keeping it in place. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s</p><p>not fair.&rdquo;</p><p>Maria</p><p>sighs. &ldquo;Carol, do you remember what the doctor told us about stress during the</p><p>pregnancy?&rdquo;</p><p>The</p><p>blonde looks at her questioningly. &ldquo;To avoid it as much as possible, why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I</p><p>have enough stress sources in my life as it is. Please don&rsquo;t make me worry.&rdquo; So</p><p>yes, she&rsquo;s not above using the pregnancy card but she&rsquo;s not sure how she would</p><p>handle it if Carol got seriously hurt, pregnancy or not.</p><p>Carol</p><p>lowers her head in defeat.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,</p><p>if you don&rsquo;t want me to punch people who insult you, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p><p>She appreciates the gesture, truly, but she won&rsquo;t let Carol get into even more</p><p>trouble because she feels she has a duty to protect her.</p><p>&ldquo;But</p><p>I will give them the meanest stink-eye they&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo;.</p><p>She</p><p>bursts out laughing. That woman will be the end of her.</p><p>&ldquo;As</p><p>long as there&rsquo;s no punching, do what you want Danvers&rdquo;.</p><p>She</p><p>regrets that phrasing the second she says it, because Carol suddenly has a</p><p>mischievous look in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Does</p><p>that mean that I can kick them?&rdquo; the smartass asks with a smirk.</p><p>Maria</p><p>presses <i>a bit</i> too much on the cut</p><p>over Carol&rsquo;s eyebrow. &ldquo;Oow, what was that for?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For</p><p>being a pain in my ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You</p><p>love me anyway&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the whole problem isn&rsquo;t it? The blonde even has the <i>nerve</i> to look at her with her sweet,</p><p>loving &ndash; even if deeply amused &ndash; eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.</p><p>I do.&rdquo;</p>",
