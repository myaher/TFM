This is something I wrote before the recent\u00a0\u2018leaks\u2019***<br/></b></i><br/>Let\u2019s get into it, shall we? There is a possibility that Littlefinger was a red herring for the \u2018giant\u2019 that Sansa slays in the Ghost of High Heart\u2019s prophecy. The real giant could instead be Tyrion. There are clues in the book about this. Tyrion is referred to by Maester Aemon as a \u2018Giant Come Among Us\u2019. Jon comments on the size of Tyrion\u2019s shadow as do others later in the series.<br/></p><p>More over, Sansa\u2019s marriage to Tyrion is an outstanding issue. She thinks about this in her Alayne chapter in TWoW. The show so far has brushed this aside. Sansa is a high born lady with a very important claim to the North. Not to mention that she was married in the Sept in front a lot of people. Simple non-consummation isn\u2019t enough to end this marriage. She either needs an annulment or Tyrion\u2019s gotta die.</p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0If Daenerys and Tyrion are smart they would push for this marriage to be acknowledged. show!Sansa has effectively become Jon\u2019s heir. If he were to die in battle, Sansa gets the North. Tyrion claiming his marriage is valid gives him control over the North.</p><p>Sansa is not going to want this! Nor is Jon. She knows the risks. Another issue could arise once Jon\u2019s parentage is revealed. She may decide she wants to marry someone else. Her marrying Jon would give him a lot of support if he did want to make a play for the crown. Tyrion could try and prevent this on Daenerys\u2019 behalf by reasserting his marriage to Sansa. She can\u2019t marry Jon if she\u2019s already married. <br/><br/>OR as some have suggested, Tyrion may be in the process of betraying Dany and Jon by delivering Sansa to Cersei. Whether Cersei or Dany is Queen, as long as the marriage stands, Tyrion could attempt to get control of Winterfell. Cersei might be more likely to give him that. Dany under Jon\u2019s influence may be pressured to not acknowledge the marriage.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Sansa needs to get out of this marriage. It\u2019s too dangerous for her and her family. She could get an annulment but only if the High Septon grants her one. And Jon follows the Old Gods as does Sansa (she follows both the Old Gods and the seven). Not to mention Jon is pretty close to a lot of Rhllorists (Stannis, Mel, etc.). High Septon isn\u2019t going to have a very high incentive for granting her an annulment especially if he thinks she wants to marry Jon.</p><p>Again, Tyrion\u2019s gotta go for Sansa to be truly free to make her own decisions. Tyrion could try to consummate their marriage and Sansa would slay him. She\u2019s free. There are of course other ways she could slay him. For this post I took a look at the definition of a giant. It can be a someone of great physical OR intellectual strength. I tend to agree with the more literal interpretation of the prophecies happening albeit with a surprise or a twist. Meaning I prefer Sansa to physical slay Tyrion. It could be metaphorical and she could outwit Tyrion\u2019s giant intellect. In Tyrion\u2019s first show conversation with Jon on Dragonstone, he both mentions Sansa as his wife and her intelligence.\u00a0</p><p>There is one thing to note. book!Littlefinger could procure her annulment in order for her to marry Harry Hardying. I tend to think Littlefinger won\u2019t get around to doing this before Sansa makes a run for it. Her not having an annulment keeps her under his control. She can\u2019t run off and marry anyone else. So, he has little motivation to do this. Bringing us back to the original problem and solution, Sansa is still married. There are two ways to end it. One being Tyrion\u2019s downfall.<br/><br/>Honestly, I really hope that show does something with this Sansa-Tyrion marriage. It\u2019s an interesting political plot. It plays into Sansa\u2019s agency. Plus, she\u2019s had a role in the downfall of almost all her most serious suitors (Joffrey, Ramsey, Littlefinger&hellip;) Next up would be Tyrion.\u00a0</p>",

We see the Sun shining over the Red Keep and a welcome buzz around the city of King\u2019s Landing</p><p>\u2018A few years later\u2019, the screen says.\u00a0</p><p>The camera moves along a room inside the Red Keep and we hear a familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cCome on Ned, I know you know this one. You only learned it last week,\u201d Sam says.</p><p>Little Ned thinks for a second and then says,\u00a0\u201cHighgarden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well lad! Now, which is next house on your list of the Great House of Westeros that are now extinct?\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, we see a silhouette of a man behind Ned. Youthful, dark hair and a muscular build.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm, Lannister. Words- Hear me roar! Sigil- A Golden Lion on a field of crimson. The seat of power- Casterly Rock.\u201d</p><p>We hear someone clapping in a distance.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFather!\u201d Ned screams.\u00a0</p><p>We see Ned running into the arms of Jon as he embraces him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing good. I think Grand Maester would agree that today\u2019s class can be concluded now.\u201d</p><p>Sam nods.</p><p>\u201cGo on now. Your mother is looking for you,\u201d Jon says to Ned who then runs out of the room.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t your services required downstairs Grand Maester?\u201d Jon asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Grace,\u201d Sam replies.</p><p>They laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, will he come to me in 10 years and tell me he wants to be a maester?&rdquo; Jon asks.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Rubbish! He is Jon Snow&rsquo;s son. He won&rsquo;t enjoy that life. Boredom isn&rsquo;t in his blood.&rdquo; They laugh again.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d asks Sam.</p><p>\u201cShe is fine. Today wasn\u2019t a part of her schemes when she was little but her handmaidens tell me that she likes her dress. But Gendry is baffled,\u201d Jon laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs he? Doesn\u2019t know where to put it? Didn&rsquo;t you tell him where to put it?\u201d Sam smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about my sister. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologies, Your Grace.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Jon sighs.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been seven years, yet it hasn\u2019t grown on me. Seems like yesterday we went north of the wall and took our\u00a0vows. We swore to never own lands and take titles, to not take wives and have children. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve broken all of them,\u201d Jon says.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere were you? I was looking for you some hours ago,\u201d Sam asks.</p><p>\u201cThe entire capital knows where I was. And you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! You were riding Drogon. The beast needed some fresh air. He had been in the Dragonspit for a month.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Jon walks towards a window in front of him and looks out.</p><p>\u201cHe reminds me of her. He is the only one who can. It\u2019s been seven years since the war and sometimes I can\u2019t even remember her face.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Sam looks sad and moves forward to comfort Jon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMost of us were fighting for our lives. She was fighting for many lives. I know, it\u2019s a pity. Life is not fair but life goes on. You know that better than most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye! I guess I do.\u201d Jon smiles a little, just to show Sam that he is okay.</p><p>\u201cWill you ever tell Ned?\u201d Sam says after a pause.</p><p>\u201cTell him what?\u201d Jon asks.</p><p>\u201cAbout his real mother. About Daenerys. You didn\u2019t know about your real mother for a long time but it is a different situation for Ned. Unlike you, he won\u2019t be killed by the King for it.\u201d Sam says.</p><p>\u201cWhat good will that do? And he has a mother just like I had a father. The only father I knew, and the only one I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you will let him think his entire life that his real mother is Sansa? She was his aunt but you made her his mother when you married her after the war.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI married Sansa to unite the seven kingdoms. I am a Targaryen. And even though I was a Northman my entire life, the northern lords needed a better reason than that to give up their dream of independence and bend the knee to another Targaryen. I did it for the realm.\u201d Jon says softly.</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever happened is behind us. Today is a day of celebration. But I\u2019m warning ya. If someday he finds out that his mother is not Sansa and that you decided to keep it from him, he won\u2019t forgive you. Ned Stark is dead but would you have forgiven him had he lived?\u201d</p><p>We see Ghost approaching from behind with Ser Davos who is wearing the badge of The Hand of the King- the first crabber\u2019s son to wear the badge, as Stannis put it all those years ago.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, Your Grace. Lady Arya is waiting for you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Luck,\u201d Sam says as he leaves.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come too far from home Ser Davos,\u201d Jon says after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cThis your home now, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like home. I was never supposed to be here. I was never supposed to be King. I thought I would end my life on the wall, shivering for warmth. I have come way too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were supposed to be a bastard too. But suddenly you decided to become the true heir. You were supposed to be dead. But, you came back. Let\u2019s face it, Jon, you\u2019ve surprised life more than life has surprised you. Do you really think this is the biggest one?\u201d Davos says.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you put it on your list?\u201d Jon asks.</p><p>\u201cProbably at the bottom, Your Grace,\u201d Davos replies.</p><p>&ldquo;Aye! The bottom seems about right.&rdquo; </p><p>Ser Davos has a letter in his hand and he looks hesitant.</p><p>Finally, he begins,\u00a0\u201cThere was a raven, Your Grace, from Winterfell, from Lord Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that sounds like home. He still prefer being called Bran though.\u201d He smiles a little.\u00a0\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has had another vision,\u201d Ser Davos looks concerned.</p><p>Ser Davos hands him the letter. Jon sits down. Ghost beside him tries to take a look.</p><p>\u201cWinter is Coming,\u201d Jon says and starts laughing along with Ser Davos. </p><p>The camera zooms out and the screen turns black, the Stark theme runs in the background.\u00a0</p>",

We see the Sun shining over the Red Keep and a welcome buzz around the city of King\u2019s Landing</p><p>\u2018A few years later\u2019, the screen says.\u00a0</p><p>The camera moves along a room inside the Red Keep and we hear a familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cCome on Ned, I know you know this one. You only learned it last week,\u201d Sam says.</p><p>Little Ned thinks for a second and then says,\u00a0\u201cHighgarden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well lad! Now, which is next house on your list of the Great House of Westeros that are now extinct?\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, we see a silhouette of a man behind Ned. Youthful, dark hair and a muscular build.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm, Lannister. Words- Hear me roar! Sigil- A Golden Lion on a field of crimson. The seat of power- Casterly Rock.\u201d</p><p>We hear someone clapping in a distance.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFather!\u201d Ned screams.\u00a0</p><p>We see Ned running into the arms of Jon as he embraces him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing good. I think Grand Maester would agree that today\u2019s class can be concluded now.\u201d</p><p>Sam nods.</p><p>\u201cGo on now. Your mother is looking for you,\u201d Jon says to Ned who then runs out of the room.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t your services required downstairs Grand Maester?\u201d Jon asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Grace,\u201d Sam replies.</p><p>They laugh.</p><p>\u201cTell me, will he come to me in 10 years and tell me he wants to be a maester?\u201d Jon asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Rubbish! He is Jon Snow\u2019s son. He won\u2019t enjoy that life. Boredom isn\u2019t in his blood.\u201d They laugh again.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d asks Sam.</p><p>\u201cShe is fine. Today wasn\u2019t a part of her schemes when she was little but her handmaidens tell me that she likes her dress. But Gendry is baffled,\u201d Jon laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs he? Doesn\u2019t know where to put it? Didn\u2019t you tell him where to put it?\u201d Sam smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about my sister. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologies, Your Grace.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Jon sighs.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been seven years, yet it hasn\u2019t grown on me. Seems like yesterday we went north of the wall and took our\u00a0vows. We swore to never own lands and take titles, to not take wives and have children. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve broken all of them,\u201d Jon says.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere were you? I was looking for you some hours ago,\u201d Sam asks.</p><p>\u201cThe entire capital knows where I was. And you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! You were riding Drogon. The beast needed some fresh air. He had been in the Dragonspit for a month.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Jon walks towards a window in front of him and looks out.</p><p>\u201cHe reminds me of her. He is the only one who can. It\u2019s been seven years since the war and sometimes I can\u2019t even remember her face.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Sam looks sad and moves forward to comfort Jon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMost of us were fighting for our lives. She was fighting for many lives. I know, it\u2019s a pity. Life is not fair but life goes on. You know that better than most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye! I guess I do.\u201d Jon smiles a little, just to show Sam that he is okay.</p><p>\u201cWill you ever tell Ned?\u201d Sam says after a pause.</p><p>\u201cTell him what?\u201d Jon asks.</p><p>\u201cAbout his real mother. About Daenerys. You didn\u2019t know about your real mother for a long time but it is a different situation for Ned. Unlike you, he won\u2019t be killed by the King for it.\u201d Sam says.</p><p>\u201cWhat good will that do? And he has a mother just like I had a father. The only father I knew, and the only one I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you will let him think his entire life that his real mother is Sansa? She was his aunt but you made her his mother when you married her after the war.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI married Sansa to unite the seven kingdoms. I am a Targaryen. And even though I was a Northman my entire life, the northern lords needed a better reason than that to give up their dream of independence and bend the knee to another Targaryen. I did it for the realm.\u201d Jon says softly.</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever happened is behind us. Today is a day of celebration. But I\u2019m warning ya. If someday he finds out that his mother is not Sansa and that you decided to keep it from him, he won\u2019t forgive you. Ned Stark is dead but would you have forgiven him had he lived?\u201d</p><p>We see Ghost approaching from behind with Ser Davos who is wearing the badge of The Hand of the King- the first crabber\u2019s son to wear the badge, as Stannis put it all those years ago.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, Your Grace. Lady Arya is waiting for you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Luck,\u201d Sam says as he leaves.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come too far from home Ser Davos,\u201d Jon says after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cThis your home now, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like home. I was never supposed to be here. I was never supposed to be King. I thought I would end my life on the wall, shivering for warmth. I have come way too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were supposed to be a bastard too. But suddenly you decided to become the true heir. You were supposed to be dead. But, you came back. Let\u2019s face it, Jon, you\u2019ve surprised life more than life has surprised you. Do you really think this is the biggest one?\u201d Davos says.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you put it on your list?\u201d Jon asks.</p><p>\u201cProbably at the bottom, Your Grace,\u201d Davos replies.</p><p>\u201cAye! The bottom seems about right.\u201d </p><p>Ser Davos has a letter in his hand and he looks hesitant.</p><p>Finally, he begins,\u00a0\u201cThere was a raven, Your Grace, from Winterfell, from Lord Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that sounds like home. He still prefer being called Bran though.\u201d He smiles a little.\u00a0\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has had another vision,\u201d Ser Davos looks concerned.</p><p>Ser Davos hands him the letter. Jon sits down. Ghost beside him tries to take a look.</p><p>\u201cWinter is Coming,\u201d Jon says and starts laughing along with Ser Davos. </p><p>The camera zooms out and the screen turns black, the Stark theme runs in the background.\u00a0</p></p>",
