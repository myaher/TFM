He knew it\nthe moment he met her. He knew she would change the world one day. </p><p>And this was before he even heard her sing.</p><p>They had been together 3 months when he decided to\nsurprise her one evening once he had arrived home after travelling with the\nboys. </p><p>He had come home one day earlier then he had\noriginally planned. It wasn\u2019t late, so she should\u2019ve still been awake. He\nunlocked her front door with the key she had made for him before he climbed the\nstairs and heard the running water of her shower. And then, he heard her.</p><p>He paused for a moment to make sure he wasn\u2019t hearing\nthings, and when he realized it was in fact his beautiful girlfriend singing, he\ndropped his belongings on her bedroom floor and raced into the bathroom.</p><p>God, she was magnificent, so absolutely talented. \u201cNever\nknew you could sing, love!\u201d His sudden presence caused her to shriek out in\nfear. She quickly covered her naked body with her hands but relaxed when she\nsaw her boyfriend standing in the door way, staring at her in what seemed to be\ncomplete awe.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Jesus Christ! You scared the hell out of me!\u201d\nShe forced out a laugh, she was shaken up pretty good. Harry\u2019s jaw was on the\nfloor and his eyes were sparkling with complete adoration.</p><p>\u201cYou have a beautiful voice,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help the\nwide grin that spread across his face when he saw her shyly bow her head to\nlook at the tiled floor. She turned the taps off and stepped out of the shower.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really,\u201d she reached for the towel on\nthe rack, when he beat her to it, hiding it behind his back. \u201cHarry c\u2019mon,\u201d she\ngiggled.</p><p>\u201cHow come I never knew my girl was so talented hmm?\nWell, f\u2019course I know you\u2019re talented, but love, you truly have an amazing\nvoice.\u201d They were both smiling like idiots now. He stepped closer to her so\nthere was not as much distance between them, not even minding that he was\ngetting himself wet since she was still dripping wet from her shower, before he\nlooked into her eyes, she was so beautiful. He was about to lean in when she\nwhispered a soft, \u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d </p><p>With that he quickly wrapped her up in the towel he\nhad been keeping from her and picked her up and threw her over his shoulder causing\nher to squeal. Through cute giggles they both released, he carried her over to\nthe bed, putting her down onto her back, kissing down her neck and along her\nshoulder blades that were still soaking wet.</p><p>He was hovering above her, placing soft, innocent\nkisses all over her face, when he stopped and gazed into her eyes again,\npushing her wet hair off of her face. \u201cDo you have any idea how much I love you,\nbaby?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she gently grabbed his face in her hands and\nbrought his lips to hers. After a kiss that seemed to last forever, she\nwhispered back, \u201cnot nearly as much as I love you.\u201d With another kiss to her\nlips he looked down and in between their bodies, wagging his eyebrows up and\ndown suggestively, which caused her to giggle again, before he slowly pulled off\nthe towel that was loosely covering her figure and discarded it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>April 2016</i></p><p>Harry would not let Y/N forget about how he caught her\nsinging that night. He begged and begged for her to, \u201cPretty please sing for me\nangel. Want to hear you sing again, please.\u201d But she always refused. Y/N was\nalways shy when it came to Harry; he made her weak in the knees all the damn\ntime.</p><p>After ages of begging he would eventually give up only\nto ask her again later on.</p><p>Then on one fateful day, he managed to catch her\nsinging once again.</p><p>She was cleaning their now shared home, just a casual\ntidy to keep her entertained while Harry was running errands around town. She\nhad her earphones in and was singing her heart out, pouring all her emotion\ninto the song.</p><p>What she didn\u2019t realize however, was her sneaky\nboyfriend recording her. She turned herself and the vacuum she was using\naround, bumping smack bang into him.</p><p>\u201cOh! Hey baby. You just love sneaking up on me, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nY/N giggled, cheeks heating up at the thought of him hearing her belting out a Michael\nJackson song at the top of her lungs. She noticed him not-so-subtly exit out of\nhis camera app on his phone. She looked up to meet his eyes that clearly told\nher he was hiding something and she watched as he tried to get rid of the smile\nforming on his lips, that was when<i> </i>she\nclicked. \u201cNo! You didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he cheeks, dimples popping. She goes to snatch\nhis phone out of his hands but Harry bolts to the staircase, bounding up the\nstairs two at a time laughing his high-pitched hyena laugh with Y/N hot on his\nheels chasing after him and yelling, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get it Styles! I mean it!\u201d\nUsing his long legs as an advantage Harry makes it up the stairs with enough\ntime to hide before she catches up. He runs into their bedroom and tucks\nhimself in behind the door awaiting her arrival.</p><p>Not long after, Y/N comes running into the room only\nto be pounced on and knocked clean off her feet and onto the bed. He dives\nstraight in and tickles her sides until she\u2019s struggling to breathe and she\u2019s\nturning red. She thrashes underneath him and tries to shove him off ultimately\nfailing. Once he finally decides to stop she lets out a gargled moan as she\ntries to regain her breath. The sound however seems to go straight to his head,\nor more accurately, his cock, as it sounds rather similar to the noises she\nmakes while he\u2019s in between her legs.</p><p>Harry hovers over her, both of them panting like crazy\nas he shifts his thigh ever so slightly so it comes in contact with her core.\nShe lets out another slight moan and looks up to meet his now lust-filled gaze.</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to use sex as a way out of\nthis?\u201d she asks, sounding as firm as she can, trying to hide the fact that his\nprevious action has her a bit riled up.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he mumbles lowly, grinding his thigh against\nher once again, this time harder, causing her to moan loudly and he attaches his lips\nto her jaw, sucking on the skin.</p><p>\u201cWell get on with it then.\u201d And that he does, Harry\nhastily pulls of her clothing, discarding them all around the room in a quick\nattempt to get to her. Without warning he plunges two fingers into her tight, leaking hole, smirking to himself because she\u2019s completely soaked, and only\nfrom a grind of his thigh against her.</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh</i> <i>my-Harry!</i>\u201d She cries, hand flying down\nto clasp around his that is moving in and out of her at lightning speed. Using\nhis other hand, he grabs both of hers in one swift movement pinning them above\nher head. She\u2019s on the verge of tears, and she\u2019s never been so close to finishing so fast in her life.</p><p>\u201cNo touching,\u201d Harry growls, bending down so he can suck\non her clit, quite roughly. Once she alerts him that she\u2019s, \u201c<i>so close baby-uh-oh my god feels so good!\u201d </i>The\ncheeky shit bites down gently on her clit and she lets out a scream in pleasure.\nShe\u2019s letting go all over his fingers, shaking and crying and Harry loves it. Loves\nseeing her like this, she\u2019s so perfect he thinks.</p><p>He gives her no time to recover before he grabs her\nhips and flips her onto her stomach, causing her to let out a muffled huff.\nHarry is hard beyond belief, he\u2019s surprised his cock hasn\u2019t ripped through his\nshorts yet. He smacks her cute bum once before standing up to hastily rid\nhimself of his clothing.</p><p>Y/N is still out of breath, feeling out of this world,\nthe stars only just starting to disappear from her view. Harry crawls back on\nthe bed and lifts her butt in the air, leaving a wet kiss on the now red cheek.</p><p>\u201cReady baby? Gonna fill ya so good,\u201d he growls,\nvoice deep and husky, hands firmly on her hips, sure to leave bruises. She lets\nout an urgent, \u201c<i>yes! Oh god yes!\u201d </i>before\nhe slams into her so hard she falls forward. Head pushed back into the pillows\non their bed. Both groaning in utter pleasure. \u201cFuck Princess! You\u2019re so fuckin\ntight-how are you this tight baby? Suffocating Daddy\u2019s cock, feels so good and\nsnug-uh.\u201d</p><p>Y/N has tears streaming down her face now, she\u2019s on\ncloud nine. \u201cOh! You\u2019re so deep, how-uh! I\u2019m gonna cum! Oh my God! Oh my-!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far behind ya baby,\u201d with that he lets out a deep\nguttural moan and shoots his load in her tight pussy, her letting go also. Harry\npulls out with a groan from them both, before eating all of their juices from\ninside her, she shrieks at this, hand flying behind her to thread her fingers\nthrough his locks. Moaning so filthily she could put a pornstar to shame.</p><p>Once he\u2019s finally done, he pops off her licking his\nlips and muttering a quiet, \u201cyummy,\u201d before crawling beside her and bringing\nher limp body flushed against his.</p><p>\u201cThat was new,\u201d she manages to squeak out, causing him\nto giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say love? Your voice does things to me,\u201d\nhe smiles into her hair, kissing her neck, \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m off the hook?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s silent for a moment, thinking it over before letting\nout a quiet, \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Harry smirks.</p><p>***</p><p>It\u2019s nearing 9:00pm and boy, were they exhausted. You\nname any place in that house, they did it there. They would have done it at least\n6 more times after the first round, Harry on a mission to make her forget the\nvideo, and maybe even her own name.</p><p>He took her in the shower, bent her over the kitchen\nbench and even had his way with her on their balcony for the whole city to see.\nThey were recovering in the living room in the pillow fort they had built, the\nonly thing covering their bodies being a thin bed sheet.</p><p>She\u2019s resting her head on his chest, listening to his\nerratic heart-beat and drawing on the exposed skin of his tummy while he softly\nplays with her hair while whispering sweet nothings into her ear. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be the death of me one of these days,\u201d\nhe whispers and chuckles lightly, pressing a kiss to the crown of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d she smiles warmly up at him, shifting\nher head to look him in the eyes to see them full of love and admiration that\nshe surely mirrors.</p><p>\u201cMy God love, ya have no idea.\u201d She snuggles back\ninto his chest pressing small, open-mouthed kisses over his skin, receiving a\nhum of pleasure from him before she straddles his torso. She kisses all over\nhis beautiful stomach all the while grinding down onto him. The sounds he was\nmaking were like music to her ears.</p><p>He quickly grabs her wrists that were resting on his\nchest whilst she left marks on his abdomen, before flipping her over onto her\nback attacking her neck with his lips, capturing the skin between his teeth\nbefore muttering a quiet, \u201cAbsolutely no idea,\u201d before gripping her hips and filling\nher up for the 7<sup>th</sup> time in the last few hours.</p><p>***</p><p><i>July 2017</i></p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d Harry rejoices as he places his and Y/N\u2019s\nluggage onto the ground and proceeds to throw himself onto their living room\ncouch, sighing in appreciation of the familiar comfort. \u201cS\u2019good to be home.\u201d\nY/N follows suit and situates herself on the recliner humming in agreement,\nalmost instantly dozing off.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019cuse me miss, what do you think you\u2019re doin?\u201d Harry\nlaughs as he walks over to where she\u2019s now laying on the recliner.</p><p>\u201cTired,\u201d is all she can muster, Harry was hoping to\nget a bit of loving in since they were so restricted back in Jamaica, well they\ndid manage to sneak in a few rounds every now and then when his mates were\nasleep or out of the house, but he was excited to get inside of her in the\ncomfort of their own home without having to remind her to be, \u201cquiet for me\nbaby, you can do it,\u201d but seeing his girl so wrecked just makes his heart swell\nand fills him with a want and need to make her as comfortable as he possibly\ncan.</p><p>\u201cOkay pet,\u201d he replies quietly, kissing the top of her\nhead before pulling her into his arms. He carefully walked up the stairs to\ntheir bedroom where he laid her down gently and removed her shoes. After\ntucking her in, he gave her one last kiss on the forehead before leaving her to\nrest and recover from their crazy vacation, looking at her and smiling to\nhimself as he closes their bedroom door behind him.</p><p>Harry is still gob smacked after nearly 2 years as to\nhow the hell he managed to be the lucky man who got to call Y/N his own, the\nman who got to sleep next to her every night, the man who had the privilege of\nmaking love to her, the man who was able to proudly tell people that he and Y/N\nY/L/N were without a doubt, madly in love.</p><p>He obviously did something right to deserve her. Harry\ncan remember the exact moment he met her all those years ago. </p><p>***</p><p><i>September\n2015</i></p><p><i>One\nDirection is due to go on hiatus soon and the boys are out celebrating Niall\u2019s\n22<sup>nd</sup> birthday.

Niall thought clubbing with\nthe boys at his favorite club would be a simple yet fun way to celebrate the\nbig 2-2.</i></p><p><i>They\u2019re\nhaving a great night, taking shot after shot enjoying the music. Soon later, after\na few too many drinks the four of them are out on the dancefloor. Liam, Louis\nand Niall busting a groove all the while Harry \u2013 who is absolutely blind drunk at\nthis point - is going wild; showing off some horrid moves you could only tolerate\nif you knew and loved Harry like the boys did.</i></p><p><i>During one\nparticular wild move Harry accidently bumps someone resulting in that someone\nand Harry to fall clean on their arses. He registers that it is a woman he\u2019s\nknocked down once he hears what he presumes to be crying. After he blinks away\nthe dots temporarily restricting his vision he immediately turns to the\nstranger beside him and lets out a slur of sincere apologies, absolutely\nfreaking out, the last thing he planned for tonight was to injure some poor, innocent\nwoman who just minding her own business. He gently pulls her to face him, and\nto his relief, finds that she\u2019s laughing her head off and is in fact, not\ncrying.</i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019so so\nsorry,\u201d his voice is filled with genuine guilt as he stands up to then help her,\nwatching her closely in case she is injured, \u201cM\u2019such a dick, are you alright?\nDidn\u2019t hurt ya?\u201d When he pulls her back up onto her feet he sees her trying to\ncatch her breath, wiping away the tears that have formed from her manic\nlaughing. That\u2019s when he sees how beautiful she is for the first time.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, I\nshould be apologizing,\u201d she continues to laugh, \u201cthis is why I don\u2019t dance, the\none time I do, I knock some poor fellow off his bloody ends.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He laughs\nhard at this; realizing it\u2019s been a while since someone\u2019s made him laugh so\nhard, \u201cNo love, I knocked you. M\u2019sure your dancing was great.\u201d He tucks a piece\nof stray hair behind her ear, and looks into her bloodshot eyes, quickly\nnoticing she\u2019s just as drunk as he is.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh, well\nthat\u2019s good- Oh my God I love this song! Come with me!\u201d She grabs Harry\u2019s arm and\ntugs him to the middle of the dancefloor where they remain for the remainder of\nthe night, dancing horribly \u2013 turned out she was pretty bad at dancing and nearly\nas bad as he was, nearly though - and screaming their lungs out to the blaring\nmusic until the A.M. </i></p><p><i>Harry made\nsure not to leave that club without her number in his phone, and her safely in\na cab on her way home before leaving with the boys. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMade a new\ntonight did ya Harry?\u201d Liam laughs elbowing Harry in the ribs causing Louis and\nNiall let out a few snickers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah,\nactually. Think I did.\u201d</i></p><p>It\u2019s safe to say that Harry fell in love with her the\nmoment he laid eyes on Y/N, but that\u2019s something he will never admit to her\nbecause he knows she\u2019d give him a shove and tell him how cheesy it sounded. But\nit\u2019s true, and he did.</p><p>***</p><p>Harry was scrolling through his photos from Jamaica\nlater that night, as his girl was snuggled beside him, she\u2019d slept the whole\nafternoon only to get up to shower to freshen up from the long flight, before\nfalling back to asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow again.</p><p>He had taken many photos of the scenery in Jamaica -\nit is such a marvelous place, he promised to take Y/N there again sometime so\nthey can properly explore it since the majority of the time they were there he\nwas recording his new album - but most of his camera roll was filled with\npictures of her. She just looked so beautiful all the damn time; he couldn\u2019t help\nhimself he just had to take as many pictures as he could.</p><p>He\u2019s endlessly scrolling when he comes across a video\nhe doesn\u2019t remember recording, he turns down the volume before hitting the play\nbutton. He\u2019s not sure what he was expecting to watch but it definitely isn\u2019t\nwhat he sees or hears.</p><p>His love\u2019s voice comes out of his phone speakers beautifully\nas he watches the video on the screen. He and Y/N are clearly drunk and are out\non the beach. The moon hanging large in the sky behind her as she sings Sign of\nThe Times so incredibly he begins to tear up.</p><p>How the hell did he forget he took this? How the hell\ndid he manage to take this without Y/N getting mad at him and forcing him to\ndelete the footage?</p><p>He must have watched it 100 times. Harry\u2019s in awe that\nthis woman keeps her voice to herself, and he\u2019s almost disappointed that people\ndon\u2019t get to hear how beautifully she sings. Well, yeah it\u2019s nice to have some\nsecrets that you keep to yourself, but this kind of secret was one that should\ndefinitely not be kept private.</p><p>He knows he shouldn\u2019t, he knows very darn well that he\nshouldn\u2019t, but he\u2019s Harry he can\u2019t help himself, <i>her talent needs to be shared, people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing </i>is\nhow he justifies his next action.</p><p>With a press of a button, Y/N\u2019s video is out on the\ninternet for the entire world to see, captioned, \u2018My love. X\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s just an innocent post on his Instagram of his wonderful\ngirlfriend, right? No harm done. </p><p>No way could Harry have anticipated what would happen\nnext.</p>",

Gonna fill ya so good,\u201d he growls,\nvoice deep and husky, hands firmly on her hips, sure to leave bruises. She lets\nout an urgent, \u201c<i>yes! Oh god yes!\u201d </i>before\nhe slams into her so hard she falls forward. Head pushed back into the pillows\non their bed. Both groaning in utter pleasure. \u201cFuck Princess! You\u2019re so fuckin\ntight-how are you this tight baby? Suffocating Daddy\u2019s cock, feels so good and\nsnug-uh.\u201d</p><p>Y/N has tears streaming down her face now, she\u2019s on\ncloud nine. \u201cOh! You\u2019re so deep, how-uh! I\u2019m gonna cum! Oh my God! Oh my-!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far behind ya baby,\u201d with that he lets out a deep\nguttural moan and shoots his load in her tight pussy, her letting go also. Harry\npulls out with a groan from them both, before eating all of their juices from\ninside her, she shrieks at this, hand flying behind her to thread her fingers\nthrough his locks. Moaning so filthily she could put a pornstar to shame.</p><p>Once he\u2019s finally done, he pops off her licking his\nlips and muttering a quiet, \u201cyummy,\u201d before crawling beside her and bringing\nher limp body flushed against his.</p><p>\u201cThat was new,\u201d she manages to squeak out, causing him\nto giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say love? Your voice does things to me,\u201d\nhe smiles into her hair, kissing her neck, \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m off the hook?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s silent for a moment, thinking it over before letting\nout a quiet, \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Harry smirks.</p><p>***</p><p>It\u2019s nearing 9:00pm and boy, were they exhausted. You\nname any place in that house, they did it there. They would have done it at least\n6 more times after the first round, Harry on a mission to make her forget the\nvideo, and maybe even her own name.</p><p>He took her in the shower, bent her over the kitchen\nbench and even had his way with her on their balcony for the whole city to see.\nThey were recovering in the living room in the pillow fort they had built, the\nonly thing covering their bodies being a thin bed sheet.</p><p>She\u2019s resting her head on his chest, listening to his\nerratic heart-beat and drawing on the exposed skin of his tummy while he softly\nplays with her hair while whispering sweet nothings into her ear. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be the death of me one of these days,\u201d\nhe whispers and chuckles lightly, pressing a kiss to the crown of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d she smiles warmly up at him, shifting\nher head to look him in the eyes to see them full of love and admiration that\nshe surely mirrors.</p><p>\u201cMy God love, ya have no idea.\u201d She snuggles back\ninto his chest pressing small, open-mouthed kisses over his skin, receiving a\nhum of pleasure from him before she straddles his torso. She kisses all over\nhis beautiful stomach all the while grinding down onto him. The sounds he was\nmaking were like music to her ears.</p><p>He quickly grabs her wrists that were resting on his\nchest whilst she left marks on his abdomen, before flipping her over onto her\nback attacking her neck with his lips, capturing the skin between his teeth\nbefore muttering a quiet, \u201cAbsolutely no idea,\u201d before gripping her hips and filling\nher up for the 7<sup>th</sup> time in the last few hours.</p><p>***</p><p><i>July 2017</i></p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d Harry rejoices as he places his and Y/N\u2019s\nluggage onto the ground and proceeds to throw himself onto their living room\ncouch, sighing in appreciation of the familiar comfort. \u201cS\u2019good to be home.\u201d\nY/N follows suit and situates herself on the recliner humming in agreement,\nalmost instantly dozing off.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019cuse me miss, what do you think you\u2019re doin?\u201d Harry\nlaughs as he walks over to where she\u2019s now laying on the recliner.</p><p>\u201cTired,\u201d is all she can muster, Harry was hoping to\nget a bit of loving in since they were so restricted back in Jamaica, well they\ndid manage to sneak in a few rounds every now and then when his mates were\nasleep or out of the house, but he was excited to get inside of her in the\ncomfort of their own home without having to remind her to be, \u201cquiet for me\nbaby, you can do it,\u201d but seeing his girl so wrecked just makes his heart swell\nand fills him with a want and need to make her as comfortable as he possibly\ncan.</p><p>\u201cOkay pet,\u201d he replies quietly, kissing the top of her\nhead before pulling her into his arms. He carefully walked up the stairs to\ntheir bedroom where he laid her down gently and removed her shoes. After\ntucking her in, he gave her one last kiss on the forehead before leaving her to\nrest and recover from their crazy vacation, looking at her and smiling to\nhimself as he closes their bedroom door behind him.</p><p>Harry is still gob smacked after nearly 2 years as to\nhow the hell he managed to be the lucky man who got to call Y/N his own, the\nman who got to sleep next to her every night, the man who had the privilege of\nmaking love to her, the man who was able to proudly tell people that he and Y/N\nY/L/N were without a doubt, madly in love.</p><p>He obviously did something right to deserve her. Harry\ncan remember the exact moment he met her all those years ago. </p><p>***</p><p><i>September\n2015</i></p><p><i>One\nDirection is due to go on hiatus soon and the boys are out celebrating Niall\u2019s\n22<sup>nd</sup> birthday. He decided just to keep it casual instead of booking\nan entire venue for all of his friends and family. Niall thought clubbing with\nthe boys at his favorite club would be a simple yet fun way to celebrate the\nbig 2-2.</i></p><p><i>They\u2019re\nhaving a great night, taking shot after shot enjoying the music. Soon later, after\na few too many drinks the four of them are out on the dancefloor. Liam, Louis\nand Niall busting a groove all the while Harry \u2013 who is absolutely blind drunk at\nthis point - is going wild; showing off some horrid moves you could only tolerate\nif you knew and loved Harry like the boys did.</i></p><p><i>During one\nparticular wild move Harry accidently bumps someone resulting in that someone\nand Harry to fall clean on their arses. He registers that it is a woman he\u2019s\nknocked down once he hears what he presumes to be crying. After he blinks away\nthe dots temporarily restricting his vision he immediately turns to the\nstranger beside him and lets out a slur of sincere apologies, absolutely\nfreaking out, the last thing he planned for tonight was to injure some poor, innocent\nwoman who just minding her own business. He gently pulls her to face him, and\nto his relief, finds that she\u2019s laughing her head off and is in fact, not\ncrying.</i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019so so\nsorry,\u201d his voice is filled with genuine guilt as he stands up to then help her,\nwatching her closely in case she is injured, \u201cM\u2019such a dick, are you alright?\nDidn\u2019t hurt ya?\u201d When he pulls her back up onto her feet he sees her trying to\ncatch her breath, wiping away the tears that have formed from her manic\nlaughing. That\u2019s when he sees how beautiful she is for the first time.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, I\nshould be apologizing,\u201d she continues to laugh, \u201cthis is why I don\u2019t dance, the\none time I do, I knock some poor fellow off his bloody ends.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He laughs\nhard at this; realizing it\u2019s been a while since someone\u2019s made him laugh so\nhard, \u201cNo love, I knocked you. M\u2019sure your dancing was great.\u201d He tucks a piece\nof stray hair behind her ear, and looks into her bloodshot eyes, quickly\nnoticing she\u2019s just as drunk as he is.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh, well\nthat\u2019s good- Oh my God I love this song! Come with me!\u201d She grabs Harry\u2019s arm and\ntugs him to the middle of the dancefloor where they remain for the remainder of\nthe night, dancing horribly \u2013 turned out she was pretty bad at dancing and nearly\nas bad as he was, nearly though - and screaming their lungs out to the blaring\nmusic until the A.M. </i></p><p><i>Harry made\nsure not to leave that club without her number in his phone, and her safely in\na cab on her way home before leaving with the boys. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMade a new\ntonight did ya Harry?\u201d Liam laughs elbowing Harry in the ribs causing Louis and\nNiall let out a few snickers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah,\nactually. Think I did.\u201d</i></p><p>It\u2019s safe to say that Harry fell in love with her the\nmoment he laid eyes on Y/N, but that\u2019s something he will never admit to her\nbecause he knows she\u2019d give him a shove and tell him how cheesy it sounded. But\nit\u2019s true, and he did.</p><p>***</p><p>Harry was scrolling through his photos from Jamaica\nlater that night, as his girl was snuggled beside him, she\u2019d slept the whole\nafternoon only to get up to shower to freshen up from the long flight, before\nfalling back to asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow again.</p><p>He had taken many photos of the scenery in Jamaica -\nit is such a marvelous place, he promised to take Y/N there again sometime so\nthey can properly explore it since the majority of the time they were there he\nwas recording his new album - but most of his camera roll was filled with\npictures of her. She just looked so beautiful all the damn time; he couldn\u2019t help\nhimself he just had to take as many pictures as he could.</p><p>He\u2019s endlessly scrolling when he comes across a video\nhe doesn\u2019t remember recording, he turns down the volume before hitting the play\nbutton. He\u2019s not sure what he was expecting to watch but it definitely isn\u2019t\nwhat he sees or hears.</p><p>His love\u2019s voice comes out of his phone speakers beautifully\nas he watches the video on the screen. He and Y/N are clearly drunk and are out\non the beach. The moon hanging large in the sky behind her as she sings Sign of\nThe Times so incredibly he begins to tear up.</p><p>How the hell did he forget he took this? How the hell\ndid he manage to take this without Y/N getting mad at him and forcing him to\ndelete the footage?</p><p>He must have watched it 100 times. Harry\u2019s in awe that\nthis woman keeps her voice to herself, and he\u2019s almost disappointed that people\ndon\u2019t get to hear how beautifully she sings. Well, yeah it\u2019s nice to have some\nsecrets that you keep to yourself, but this kind of secret was one that should\ndefinitely not be kept private.</p><p>He knows he shouldn\u2019t, he knows very darn well that he\nshouldn\u2019t, but he\u2019s Harry he can\u2019t help himself, <i>her talent needs to be shared, people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing </i>is\nhow he justifies his next action.</p><p>With a press of a button, Y/N\u2019s video is out on the\ninternet for the entire world to see, captioned, \u2018My love. X\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s just an innocent post on his Instagram of his wonderful\ngirlfriend, right? No harm done. </p><p>No way could Harry have anticipated what would happen\nnext.</p>",

And I\u2019m happy with it, I hope you all like it, it\u2019s the only Harry-related thing I\u2019ve ever written. Let me know what you think!</i></b></p><p><b>Summary: Harry thinks Y/N has a voice of a God.</b></p><p><b>3k+ words</b></p><p><i><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b>DECEMBER\n2015</i></p><p>Harry knew Y/N was destined for greatness. He knew it\nthe moment he met her. He knew she would change the world one day. </p><p>And this was before he even heard her sing.</p><p>They had been together 3 months when he decided to\nsurprise her one evening once he had arrived home after travelling with the\nboys. </p><p>He had come home one day earlier then he had\noriginally planned. It wasn\u2019t late, so she should\u2019ve still been awake. He\nunlocked her front door with the key she had made for him before he climbed the\nstairs and heard the running water of her shower. And then, he heard her.</p><p>He paused for a moment to make sure he wasn\u2019t hearing\nthings, and when he realized it was in fact his beautiful girlfriend singing, he\ndropped his belongings on her bedroom floor and raced into the bathroom.</p><p>God, she was magnificent, so absolutely talented. \u201cNever\nknew you could sing, love!\u201d His sudden presence caused her to shriek out in\nfear. She quickly covered her naked body with her hands but relaxed when she\nsaw her boyfriend standing in the door way, staring at her in what seemed to be\ncomplete awe.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Jesus Christ! You scared the hell out of me!\u201d\nShe forced out a laugh, she was shaken up pretty good. Harry\u2019s jaw was on the\nfloor and his eyes were sparkling with complete adoration.</p><p>\u201cYou have a beautiful voice,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help the\nwide grin that spread across his face when he saw her shyly bow her head to\nlook at the tiled floor. She turned the taps off and stepped out of the shower.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really,\u201d she reached for the towel on\nthe rack, when he beat her to it, hiding it behind his back. \u201cHarry c\u2019mon,\u201d she\ngiggled.</p><p>\u201cHow come I never knew my girl was so talented hmm?\nWell, f\u2019course I know you\u2019re talented, but love, you truly have an amazing\nvoice.\u201d They were both smiling like idiots now. He stepped closer to her so\nthere was not as much distance between them, not even minding that he was\ngetting himself wet since she was still dripping wet from her shower, before he\nlooked into her eyes, she was so beautiful. He was about to lean in when she\nwhispered a soft, \u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d </p><p>With that he quickly wrapped her up in the towel he\nhad been keeping from her and picked her up and threw her over his shoulder causing\nher to squeal. Through cute giggles they both released, he carried her over to\nthe bed, putting her down onto her back, kissing down her neck and along her\nshoulder blades that were still soaking wet.</p><p>He was hovering above her, placing soft, innocent\nkisses all over her face, when he stopped and gazed into her eyes again,\npushing her wet hair off of her face. \u201cDo you have any idea how much I love you,\nbaby?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she gently grabbed his face in her hands and\nbrought his lips to hers. After a kiss that seemed to last forever, she\nwhispered back, \u201cnot nearly as much as I love you.\u201d With another kiss to her\nlips he looked down and in between their bodies, wagging his eyebrows up and\ndown suggestively, which caused her to giggle again, before he slowly pulled off\nthe towel that was loosely covering her figure and discarded it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>April 2016</i></p><p>Harry would not let Y/N forget about how he caught her\nsinging that night. He begged and begged for her to, \u201cPretty please sing for me\nangel. Want to hear you sing again, please.\u201d But she always refused. Y/N was\nalways shy when it came to Harry; he made her weak in the knees all the damn\ntime.</p><p>After ages of begging he would eventually give up only\nto ask her again later on.</p><p>Then on one fateful day, he managed to catch her\nsinging once again.</p><p>She was cleaning their now shared home, just a casual\ntidy to keep her entertained while Harry was running errands around town. She\nhad her earphones in and was singing her heart out, pouring all her emotion\ninto the song.</p><p>What she didn\u2019t realize however, was her sneaky\nboyfriend recording her. She turned herself and the vacuum she was using\naround, bumping smack bang into him.</p><p>\u201cOh! Hey baby. You just love sneaking up on me, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nY/N giggled, cheeks heating up at the thought of him hearing her belting out a Michael\nJackson song at the top of her lungs. She noticed him not-so-subtly exit out of\nhis camera app on his phone. She looked up to meet his eyes that clearly told\nher he was hiding something and she watched as he tried to get rid of the smile\nforming on his lips, that was when<i> </i>she\nclicked. \u201cNo! You didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he cheeks, dimples popping. She goes to snatch\nhis phone out of his hands but Harry bolts to the staircase, bounding up the\nstairs two at a time laughing his high-pitched hyena laugh with Y/N hot on his\nheels chasing after him and yelling, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get it Styles! I mean it!\u201d\nUsing his long legs as an advantage Harry makes it up the stairs with enough\ntime to hide before she catches up. He runs into their bedroom and tucks\nhimself in behind the door awaiting her arrival.</p><p>Not long after, Y/N comes running into the room only\nto be pounced on and knocked clean off her feet and onto the bed. He dives\nstraight in and tickles her sides until she\u2019s struggling to breathe and she\u2019s\nturning red. She thrashes underneath him and tries to shove him off ultimately\nfailing. Once he finally decides to stop she lets out a gargled moan as she\ntries to regain her breath. The sound however seems to go straight to his head,\nor more accurately, his cock, as it sounds rather similar to the noises she\nmakes while he\u2019s in between her legs.</p><p>Harry hovers over her, both of them panting like crazy\nas he shifts his thigh ever so slightly so it comes in contact with her core.\nShe lets out another slight moan and looks up to meet his now lust-filled gaze.</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to use sex as a way out of\nthis?\u201d she asks, sounding as firm as she can, trying to hide the fact that his\nprevious action has her a bit riled up.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he mumbles lowly, grinding his thigh against\nher once again, this time harder, causing her to moan loudly and he attaches his lips\nto her jaw, sucking on the skin.</p><p>\u201cWell get on with it then.\u201d And that he does, Harry\nhastily pulls of her clothing, discarding them all around the room in a quick\nattempt to get to her. Without warning he plunges two fingers into her tight, leaking hole, smirking to himself because she\u2019s completely soaked, and only\nfrom a grind of his thigh against her.</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh</i> <i>my-Harry!</i>\u201d She cries, hand flying down\nto clasp around his that is moving in and out of her at lightning speed. Using\nhis other hand, he grabs both of hers in one swift movement pinning them above\nher head. She\u2019s on the verge of tears, and she\u2019s never been so close to finishing so fast in her life.</p><p>\u201cNo touching,\u201d Harry growls, bending down so he can suck\non her clit, quite roughly. Once she alerts him that she\u2019s, \u201c<i>so close baby-uh-oh my god feels so good!\u201d </i>The\ncheeky shit bites down gently on her clit and she lets out a scream in pleasure.\nShe\u2019s letting go all over his fingers, shaking and crying and Harry loves it. Loves\nseeing her like this, she\u2019s so perfect he thinks.</p><p>He gives her no time to recover before he grabs her\nhips and flips her onto her stomach, causing her to let out a muffled huff.\nHarry is hard beyond belief, he\u2019s surprised his cock hasn\u2019t ripped through his\nshorts yet. He smacks her cute bum once before standing up to hastily rid\nhimself of his clothing.</p><p>Y/N is still out of breath, feeling out of this world,\nthe stars only just starting to disappear from her view. Harry crawls back on\nthe bed and lifts her butt in the air, leaving a wet kiss on the now red cheek.</p><p>\u201cReady baby? Gonna fill ya so good,\u201d he growls,\nvoice deep and husky, hands firmly on her hips, sure to leave bruises. She lets\nout an urgent, \u201c<i>yes! Oh god yes!\u201d </i>before\nhe slams into her so hard she falls forward. Head pushed back into the pillows\non their bed. Both groaning in utter pleasure. \u201cFuck Princess! You\u2019re so fuckin\ntight-how are you this tight baby? Suffocating Daddy\u2019s cock, feels so good and\nsnug-uh.\u201d</p><p>Y/N has tears streaming down her face now, she\u2019s on\ncloud nine. \u201cOh! You\u2019re so deep, how-uh! I\u2019m gonna cum! Oh my God! Oh my-!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far behind ya baby,\u201d with that he lets out a deep\nguttural moan and shoots his load in her tight pussy, her letting go also. Harry\npulls out with a groan from them both, before eating all of their juices from\ninside her, she shrieks at this, hand flying behind her to thread her fingers\nthrough his locks. Moaning so filthily she could put a pornstar to shame.</p><p>Once he\u2019s finally done, he pops off her licking his\nlips and muttering a quiet, \u201cyummy,\u201d before crawling beside her and bringing\nher limp body flushed against his.</p><p>\u201cThat was new,\u201d she manages to squeak out, causing him\nto giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say love?

                "content": "<p><b><i>So, I started writing this around this time last year and got halfway through and became completely uninterested and unmotivated and for whatever reason I felt like finishing it tonight. And I&rsquo;m happy with it, I hope you all like it, it&rsquo;s the only Harry-related thing I&rsquo;ve ever written. Let me know what you think!</i></b></p><p><b>Summary: Harry thinks Y/N has a voice of a God.</b></p><p><b>3k+ words</b></p><p><i><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b>DECEMBER\n2015</i></p><p>Harry knew Y/N was destined for greatness. He knew it\nthe moment he met her. He knew she would change the world one day. </p><p>And this was before he even heard her sing.</p><p>They had been together 3 months when he decided to\nsurprise her one evening once he had arrived home after travelling with the\nboys. </p><p>He had come home one day earlier then he had\noriginally planned. It wasn&rsquo;t late, so she should&rsquo;ve still been awake. He\nunlocked her front door with the key she had made for him before he climbed the\nstairs and heard the running water of her shower. And then, he heard her.</p><p>He paused for a moment to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t hearing\nthings, and when he realized it was in fact his beautiful girlfriend singing, he\ndropped his belongings on her bedroom floor and raced into the bathroom.</p><p>God, she was magnificent, so absolutely talented. &ldquo;Never\nknew you could sing, love!&rdquo; His sudden presence caused her to shriek out in\nfear. She quickly covered her naked body with her hands but relaxed when she\nsaw her boyfriend standing in the door way, staring at her in what seemed to be\ncomplete awe.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! Jesus Christ! You scared the hell out of me!&rdquo;\nShe forced out a laugh, she was shaken up pretty good. Harry&rsquo;s jaw was on the\nfloor and his eyes were sparkling with complete adoration.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a beautiful voice,&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t help the\nwide grin that spread across his face when he saw her shyly bow her head to\nlook at the tiled floor. She turned the taps off and stepped out of the shower.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing really,&rdquo; she reached for the towel on\nthe rack, when he beat her to it, hiding it behind his back. &ldquo;Harry c&rsquo;mon,&rdquo; she\ngiggled.</p><p>&ldquo;How come I never knew my girl was so talented hmm?\nWell, f&rsquo;course I know you&rsquo;re talented, but love, you truly have an amazing\nvoice.&rdquo; They were both smiling like idiots now. He stepped closer to her so\nthere was not as much distance between them, not even minding that he was\ngetting himself wet since she was still dripping wet from her shower, before he\nlooked into her eyes, she was so beautiful. He was about to lean in when she\nwhispered a soft, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold.&rdquo; </p><p>With that he quickly wrapped her up in the towel he\nhad been keeping from her and picked her up and threw her over his shoulder causing\nher to squeal. Through cute giggles they both released, he carried her over to\nthe bed, putting her down onto her back, kissing down her neck and along her\nshoulder blades that were still soaking wet.</p><p>He was hovering above her, placing soft, innocent\nkisses all over her face, when he stopped and gazed into her eyes again,\npushing her wet hair off of her face. &ldquo;Do you have any idea how much I love you,\nbaby?&rdquo;</p><p>Smiling, she gently grabbed his face in her hands and\nbrought his lips to hers. After a kiss that seemed to last forever, she\nwhispered back, &ldquo;not nearly as much as I love you.&rdquo; With another kiss to her\nlips he looked down and in between their bodies, wagging his eyebrows up and\ndown suggestively, which caused her to giggle again, before he slowly pulled off\nthe towel that was loosely covering her figure and discarded it on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>April 2016</i></p><p>Harry would not let Y/N forget about how he caught her\nsinging that night. He begged and begged for her to, &ldquo;Pretty please sing for me\nangel. Want to hear you sing again, please.&rdquo; But she always refused. Y/N was\nalways shy when it came to Harry; he made her weak in the knees all the damn\ntime.</p><p>After ages of begging he would eventually give up only\nto ask her again later on.</p><p>Then on one fateful day, he managed to catch her\nsinging once again.</p><p>She was cleaning their now shared home, just a casual\ntidy to keep her entertained while Harry was running errands around town. She\nhad her earphones in and was singing her heart out, pouring all her emotion\ninto the song.</p><p>What she didn&rsquo;t realize however, was her sneaky\nboyfriend recording her. She turned herself and the vacuum she was using\naround, bumping smack bang into him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Hey baby. You just love sneaking up on me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;\nY/N giggled, cheeks heating up at the thought of him hearing her belting out a Michael\nJackson song at the top of her lungs. She noticed him not-so-subtly exit out of\nhis camera app on his phone. She looked up to meet his eyes that clearly told\nher he was hiding something and she watched as he tried to get rid of the smile\nforming on his lips, that was when<i> </i>she\nclicked. &ldquo;No! You didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; he cheeks, dimples popping. She goes to snatch\nhis phone out of his hands but Harry bolts to the staircase, bounding up the\nstairs two at a time laughing his high-pitched hyena laugh with Y/N hot on his\nheels chasing after him and yelling, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna get it Styles! I mean it!&rdquo;\nUsing his long legs as an advantage Harry makes it up the stairs with enough\ntime to hide before she catches up. He runs into their bedroom and tucks\nhimself in behind the door awaiting her arrival.</p><p>Not long after, Y/N comes running into the room only\nto be pounced on and knocked clean off her feet and onto the bed. He dives\nstraight in and tickles her sides until she&rsquo;s struggling to breathe and she&rsquo;s\nturning red. She thrashes underneath him and tries to shove him off ultimately\nfailing. Once he finally decides to stop she lets out a gargled moan as she\ntries to regain her breath. The sound however seems to go straight to his head,\nor more accurately, his cock, as it sounds rather similar to the noises she\nmakes while he&rsquo;s in between her legs.</p><p>Harry hovers over her, both of them panting like crazy\nas he shifts his thigh ever so slightly so it comes in contact with her core.\nShe lets out another slight moan and looks up to meet his now lust-filled gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you really going to use sex as a way out of\nthis?&rdquo; she asks, sounding as firm as she can, trying to hide the fact that his\nprevious action has her a bit riled up.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he mumbles lowly, grinding his thigh against\nher once again, this time harder, causing her to moan loudly and he attaches his lips\nto her jaw, sucking on the skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Well get on with it then.&rdquo; And that he does, Harry\nhastily pulls of her clothing, discarding them all around the room in a quick\nattempt to get to her. Without warning he plunges two fingers into her tight, leaking hole, smirking to himself because she&rsquo;s completely soaked, and only\nfrom a grind of his thigh against her.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh</i> <i>my-Harry!</i>&rdquo; She cries, hand flying down\nto clasp around his that is moving in and out of her at lightning speed. Using\nhis other hand, he grabs both of hers in one swift movement pinning them above\nher head. She&rsquo;s on the verge of tears, and she&rsquo;s never been so close to finishing so fast in her life.</p><p>&ldquo;No touching,&rdquo; Harry growls, bending down so he can suck\non her clit, quite roughly. Once she alerts him that she&rsquo;s, &ldquo;<i>so close baby-uh-oh my god feels so good!&rdquo; </i>The\ncheeky shit bites down gently on her clit and she lets out a scream in pleasure.\nShe&rsquo;s letting go all over his fingers, shaking and crying and Harry loves it. Loves\nseeing her like this, she&rsquo;s so perfect he thinks.</p><p>He gives her no time to recover before he grabs her\nhips and flips her onto her stomach, causing her to let out a muffled huff.\nHarry is hard beyond belief, he&rsquo;s surprised his cock hasn&rsquo;t ripped through his\nshorts yet. He smacks her cute bum once before standing up to hastily rid\nhimself of his clothing.</p><p>Y/N is still out of breath, feeling out of this world,\nthe stars only just starting to disappear from her view. Harry crawls back on\nthe bed and lifts her butt in the air, leaving a wet kiss on the now red cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready baby? Gonna fill ya so good,&rdquo; he growls,\nvoice deep and husky, hands firmly on her hips, sure to leave bruises. She lets\nout an urgent, &ldquo;<i>yes! Oh god yes!&rdquo; </i>before\nhe slams into her so hard she falls forward. Head pushed back into the pillows\non their bed. Both groaning in utter pleasure. &ldquo;Fuck Princess! You&rsquo;re so fuckin\ntight-how are you this tight baby? Suffocating Daddy&rsquo;s cock, feels so good and\nsnug-uh.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N has tears streaming down her face now, she&rsquo;s on\ncloud nine. &ldquo;Oh! You&rsquo;re so deep, how-uh! I&rsquo;m gonna cum! Oh my God! Oh my-!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not far behind ya baby,&rdquo; with that he lets out a deep\nguttural moan and shoots his load in her tight pussy, her letting go also. Harry\npulls out with a groan from them both, before eating all of their juices from\ninside her, she shrieks at this, hand flying behind her to thread her fingers\nthrough his locks. Moaning so filthily she could put a pornstar to shame.</p><p>Once he&rsquo;s finally done, he pops off her licking his\nlips and muttering a quiet, &ldquo;yummy,&rdquo; before crawling beside her and bringing\nher limp body flushed against his.</p><p>&ldquo;That was new,&rdquo; she manages to squeak out, causing him\nto giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I say love? Your voice does things to me,&rdquo;\nhe smiles into her hair, kissing her neck, &ldquo;Does this mean I&rsquo;m off the hook?&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;s silent for a moment, thinking it over before letting\nout a quiet, &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry smirks.</p><p>***</p><p>It&rsquo;s nearing 9:00pm and boy, were they exhausted.

How the hell\ndid he manage to take this without Y/N getting mad at him and forcing him to\ndelete the footage?</p><p>He must have watched it 100 times. Harry&rsquo;s in awe that\nthis woman keeps her voice to herself, and he&rsquo;s almost disappointed that people\ndon&rsquo;t get to hear how beautifully she sings. Well, yeah it&rsquo;s nice to have some\nsecrets that you keep to yourself, but this kind of secret was one that should\ndefinitely not be kept private.</p><p>He knows he shouldn&rsquo;t, he knows very darn well that he\nshouldn&rsquo;t, but he&rsquo;s Harry he can&rsquo;t help himself, <i>her talent needs to be shared, people don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re missing </i>is\nhow he justifies his next action.</p><p>With a press of a button, Y/N&rsquo;s video is out on the\ninternet for the entire world to see, captioned, &lsquo;My love. X&rsquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s just an innocent post on his Instagram of his wonderful\ngirlfriend, right? No harm done. </p><p>No way could Harry have anticipated what would happen\nnext.</p>",
