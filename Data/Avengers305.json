He farts, he burps, he tells the most terrible jokes ever, he doesn\u2019t know how to cook a pizza properly and he has the worst pick up lines on the galaxy. <br/></p><p>The most best thing about him? His <i>unique </i>sense of humor. <br/></p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m telling you Y/N, I beat his ass as a giant pacman!\u201d Peter yelled at you while he laughed like an idiot holding onto his belly, you laughed instantly.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit!\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Baby</i>, I\u2019m not!\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop laughing just like you. There\u2019s something about his voice that isn\u2019t right, there\u2019s something about him that makes you laugh in he moment you hear something coming out of his mout. It\u2019s like a <i>click! </i>inside your head: As soon as you hear his voice you start laughing out of nowhere. \u201cHe was like this <i>huge </i>man made of rocks, you know? It was pretty&hellip; pretty awesome&hellip;\u201d He whispered the last words while his smile fade away, realization hitting you on the face almost immediately. <br/></p><p>\u201cHey, King <i>Q,\u201d </i>you tried the silly name you made up for him months ago while both of you played jenga, \u201cyou alright there?\u201d <br/></p><p>Peter remained silent. You knew he wasn\u2019t alright at all and that hurted you. Ever since the Guardians \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013with Peter included\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfought and defetead Ego, Peter\u2019s been acting really weird, but he refused to talk about it&hellip; or about Ego himself. \u201cI could <i>really </i>use a hug.\u201d A teasing smile covered his face and you threw yourself right into his chest, squeezing him strongly. \u201cThat\u2019s better, baby.\u201d He murmured in your hear. <br/></p><p>\u201cAm I interrumpint something?\u201d A manly voice said over your chuckles and Peter\u2019s soft words against your ear. <br/></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Both of you said at the same time. You pinched Peter\u2019s ribs with your elbow and then you smiled at the beautiful ex-assassin a few meters away from you. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rabbit is calling for you, Quill.\u201d Bucky said firmly while tensing his robotic arm. <br/></p><p>\u201cRaccon, little soldier, raccon. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t say that in front of Rocket, you know? He might cut that arm of yours while you sleep, <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, babe, I know.\u201d Quill said with a hand gesture and then he turned over his heels to face you. \u201cTo be continued, baby. Feeling like karaoke tonight?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cY/N and I have work to do, Quill. Unlike you, some of us have some responsabilities in here.\u201d <br/></p><p>Peter rolled his eyes to the sky and he gave a mischievously smile to you. \u201cSo? Karaoke? I\u2019m sure Groot would <i>love </i>some karaoke battles with the two of us.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cSorry, King <i>Q</i>, but as the soldier said I have work to do. But we\u2019ll do it soon! Groot included!\u201d You cheered him up and then you kissed his cheek, Peter grunted at Bucky on his way out and he whispered: <i>This is war, smartass</i>. <br/></p><p>The Winter Soldier stood still while he watched the light brown haired man get out of the room that him and you were right now. He couldn\u2019t believe you actually spent your time with that guy.

He farts, he burps, he tells the most terrible jokes ever, he doesn&rsquo;t know how to cook a pizza properly and he has the worst pick up lines on the galaxy. <br /></p><p>The most best thing about him? His <i>unique </i>sense of humor. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m telling you Y/N, I beat his ass as a giant pacman!&rdquo; Peter yelled at you while he laughed like an idiot holding onto his belly, you laughed instantly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so full of shit!&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Baby</i>, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing just like you. There&rsquo;s something about his voice that isn&rsquo;t right, there&rsquo;s something about him that makes you laugh in he moment you hear something coming out of his mout. It&rsquo;s like a <i>click! </i>inside your head: As soon as you hear his voice you start laughing out of nowhere. &ldquo;He was like this <i>huge </i>man made of rocks, you know? It was pretty&hellip; pretty awesome&hellip;&rdquo; He whispered the last words while his smile fade away, realization hitting you on the face almost immediately. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, King <i>Q,&rdquo; </i>you tried the silly name you made up for him months ago while both of you played jenga, &ldquo;you alright there?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Peter remained silent. You knew he wasn&rsquo;t alright at all and that hurted you. Ever since the Guardians \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&ndash;with Peter included&ndash;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfought and defetead Ego, Peter&rsquo;s been acting really weird, but he refused to talk about it&hellip; or about Ego himself. &ldquo;I could <i>really </i>use a hug.&rdquo; A teasing smile covered his face and you threw yourself right into his chest, squeezing him strongly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, baby.&rdquo; He murmured in your hear. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Am I interrumpint something?&rdquo; A manly voice said over your chuckles and Peter&rsquo;s soft words against your ear. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Both of you said at the same time. You pinched Peter&rsquo;s ribs with your elbow and then you smiled at the beautiful ex-assassin a few meters away from you. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The rabbit is calling for you, Quill.&rdquo; Bucky said firmly while tensing his robotic arm. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Raccon, little soldier, raccon. Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t say that in front of Rocket, you know? He might cut that arm of yours while you sleep, <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, babe, I know.&rdquo; Quill said with a hand gesture and then he turned over his heels to face you. &ldquo;To be continued, baby. Feeling like karaoke tonight?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N and I have work to do, Quill. Unlike you, some of us have some responsabilities in here.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Peter rolled his eyes to the sky and he gave a mischievously smile to you. &ldquo;So? Karaoke? I&rsquo;m sure Groot would <i>love </i>some karaoke battles with the two of us.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, King <i>Q</i>, but as the soldier said I have work to do. But we&rsquo;ll do it soon! Groot included!&rdquo; You cheered him up and then you kissed his cheek, Peter grunted at Bucky on his way out and he whispered: <i>This is war, smartass</i>. <br /></p><p>The Winter Soldier stood still while he watched the light brown haired man get out of the room that him and you were right now. He couldn&rsquo;t believe you actually spent your time with that guy. He couldn&rsquo;t understand why you liked him on the first place. <br /></p><p>Bucky doesn&rsquo;t feel too many things, not like other people do. He wish he could feel empathy for someone other than Steve and you, he really tries to build conversations with other people inside the Avengers and the Guardians but it&rsquo;s way too difficult for him to do so when every and last one of them still doubts of the kind of person he is. <br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s difficult when people judge you, even if they have the right motives to do so. </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; you said, &ldquo;wanna do something fun after we do the job? Or you&rsquo;re too busy to have fun, <i>Winter Soldier</i>?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>The blue eyed men breathed slowly while he placed his gaze on you. He felt tickles on his chest and his hearbeat razed right on time. Bucky hates when people calls him that, but when whose words came out of your mouth&hellip; he couldn&rsquo;t feel anything but joy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an assasian.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You <i>were </i>an assasin.&rdquo; You corrected his words, wishing you could erase all the bad things and thoughts out of his mind. &ldquo;Can I ask you something, Buck?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hhm-hm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think Quill and I would make a good couple?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; His voice came harsher than he wish.
