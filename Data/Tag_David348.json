What was I thinking?\u201d\nshe said. The ancient motor hicupped, then they rushed forward.<br/></p><p>\u201cThe\ndrill?\u201d her son said, rolling the <i>r </i>in his mild French accent.<br/></p><p>\u201cJohn\ndecided to build his house right by a bloody cliff, so-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cA\ncliff! A cliff! Is there a beach?\u201d he said, throwing his action\nfigure aside. The boy loved the water. He wiggled in his booster\nchair.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, sweetie, but you do realize it\u2019s September?\u201d Alex said,\nlooking at him in the rearview. \u201cThe water\u2019s very cold. Brrrr.\u201d\nShe shivered.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\ncan have a hot <i>bain</i>\nafterward,\u201d he said.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll\nsee,\u201d she said. The little car struggled to get up the hill road.\nShe floored the gas pedal and prayed as they inched to the top, and\nthey both gasped together as they saw the newly completed home, set\noff by the endless blue of the Clyde Waters.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nbloody huge!\u201d she said to her son as she turned into their\ndriveway, which curved up to the hill where the house stood. Beside\nit, nearer to the ocean, was a large barn \u2013 his workshop.<br/></p><p>\u201cLook,\nmama!\u201d he said, pointing to the barn.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\ncolor is it?\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cRouge.\n<i>Red</i>!\u201d\nhe said, and clapped his hands. \u201cAre there cows in it?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think so,\u201d Alex said. \u201cThat\u2019s were Uncle John makes his\nart.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOui. His tables and his chairs and his cabi \u2026 cabi \u2026\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHis\ncabinets,\u201d Alex said, and reached back to caress his fat cheek. \u201cHe\ngets a lot of money for his cabinets.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd\nthat\u2019s good?\u201d he said. His chubby fingers wriggled over the\nseatbelt button.<br/></p><p>\u201cFor\nhim, yes. When I stop the car, you are going to stay exactly where\nyou are, you hear?\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t know whether the cliff\nwas fenced, and her boy was a fast runner.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes,\nmam,\u201d she said, and gave her a twinkly grin. She squinted at the\ncars parked in the driveway by the house. There was Connie\u2019s blue\nSUV, John\u2019s little sports car, and a Beamer. Her heart beat faster\nas she pulled up. A lot of people had red Beamers. Not only <i>her</i>.\nAnd she might\u2019ve changed her car years ago\u2026<br/></p><p>\u201cAuntie\nAlex!\u201d John said, running up with open arms. Right behind him, two\nlittle girls ran up, with flapping coats and flowered galoshes. One\nof them had brown curls and round hazel eyes, and the other had\nflaming auburn hair and bright blue eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cAuntie\nAlex!\u201d they echoed, and hugged her legs.<br/></p><p>\u201cHello,\nyou!\u201d she said, and hugged and kissed John, then the girls. They\nlooked into the open car door and screamed again when they saw her\nson.<br/></p><p>\u201cCome\ninside. There\u2019s cake!\u201d Lily said. Her son undid the seat belt and\nwriggled out of the car.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhoa\nthere!\u201d she said, taking his hand.<br/></p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s\nperfectly safe. There\u2019s a fence,\u201d John said. Alex kissed him and\nlet go, and they ran into the house to announce her arrival.<br/></p><p>She\nlooked up at him and giggled. \u201cFuck a duck, you\u2019ve gone full L.L.\nBean mountain man,\u201d she said, referring to his full beard. He wore\na soft gray beanie at a jaunty angle on his head.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nL.L. Bean? Sounds tasty.\u201d He winked, then rubbed his beard. \u201cIt\nhelps me fit in with the locals.\u201d He straightened up and narrowed\nhis eyes as he looked toward the water. \u201cDo I look local?\u201d he\nsaid, nudging her.<br/></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nsaid. \u201cVery.\u201d<br/></p><p>He\nturned to her with his usual puppy dog enthusiasm. \u201cD\u2019you like\nit?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\n<i>big</i>,\u201d\nshe said, looking up at the second-story gingerbread eaves, then to\nthe wraparound veranda. An empty porch swing swung in the cool ocean\nbreeze.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nall me. Once I got to the planning stage, I kept adding elements. It\ndrove Connie crazy, since she wanted it to be done already,\u201d he\nsaid with a widening grin. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna shit a brick.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\nshe said. Again, her heart rushed. The girls came back out, with\nanother boy in tow. Just as soon as he saw her, he brightened and ran\nfaster.<br/></p><p>\u201cMonty!?\u201d\nAlex said as the boy slammed into her and hugged her.<br/></p><p>\u201cAlex!\u201d\nhe said, and petted her slick blonde bob. \u201cPretty.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks,\nlove,\u201d she said, taking his face into her trembling hands. His blue\neyes were almost violet in the bright afternoon light, and his face\nwas losing its baby chubbiness.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\nold are you now?\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nfive,\u201d he said, holding up his hand. \u201cI\u2019m in proper school, not\nbaby school anymore,\u201d he said, nodding proudly.<br/></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat so?\u201d Alex said. She couldn\u2019t say much more. She didn\u2019t\ncome prepared to see Olivia. But she was a bit &hellip; excited.<br/></p><p>John\npatted Monty\u2019s curly head. \u201cKeep an eye on the cake. You know the\ngirls are dying to get into it,\u201d he said. Monty saluted and ran\naway.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you tell me, man?\u201d she said, looking down at her rumpled\ncoat. She checked her makeup in the sideview mirror.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a surprise to me,\u201d he said, popping the trunk to get her bags.\n\u201cI came back from getting lumber, and here they were, big as life\nsitting at our kitchen table.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\nlong has she been here?\u201d she asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cA\nfew hours,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s staying for a while, though.\u201d\nAgain, he gave her that mysterious grin.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Alex said. \u201cYou look like a cat that\nswallowed the canary.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\nsee,\u201d he said, and walked toward the house. She didn\u2019t move, and\nhe stopped. \u201cCome on. It\u2019ll be painless, I swear.\u201d<br/></p><p>The\nhouse was deliciously warm, and smelled of food cooking.<br/></p><p>\u201cWow,\nmate, you outdid yourself,\u201d she said in awe as she peeled off her\ncoat. The floors gleamed a warm purple, and most of the furniture had\nhis signature touch. \u201cIt\u2019s like, a show house or something.\u201d\nShe kicked off her galoshes and touched the white pine entryway\ncabinet. \u201cWhere\u2019s Connie?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIn\nthe kitchen, honey!\u201d Connie yelled. \u201cDinner\u2019s almost ready!\u201d<br/></p><p>Alex\nran toward her voice, then nearly slid on her ass when she saw her.<br/></p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d\nConnie said. She was \u2026 huge with child. Enormous. Rampant.<br/></p><p>\u201cJohn,\nyou dog!\u201d she said, and gave Connie a hug. \u201cOh my God, how?\nWhen?\u201d She held Connie\u2019s belly in both hands.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nknow how,\u201d she said, and winked at her. \u201cAnd we got the surprise\nof our lives about 37 weeks ago.\u201d<br/></p><p>John\nran in behind Connie and gave her a loud, smacking kiss on her neck.\nHe rubbed her belly and knelt to talk to it.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s\nthe weather in there, buddy? Staying warm?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNooo,\u201d\nConnie said, but she didn\u2019t push him away. She put her hands on her\nhips and closed her eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cWatch,\u201d\nJohn said with glee, and lifted Connie\u2019s shirt. He kissed her\nbelly, which was stretched shiny. \u201cHow\u2019s my sweet little boy? Say\nhello, son.\u201d Connie sucked in breath as life stirred in her belly.\nFirst, perhaps a knee, but then, almost too clearly, a tiny hand.<br/></p><p>\u201cFuck,\nthat was a bloody hand!\u201d she said, pressing her hand over her own\nflat belly. Her son had been active when he was in the womb, but\nshe\u2019d never seen his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy! Congratulations, bruv!\u201d\nShe patted John\u2019s shoulder.<br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be a handful, if he\u2019s anything like his father,\u201d\na familiar voice said from the threshold. Olivia walked into the\nkitchen.<br/></p><p>Alex\nstared. Her usually fluffy blonde hair was\nat least three shades darker, and up in a carefree ponytail. She was\nas slim as she ever was, but she gave off a different vibe. Warmer.\nMore inviting. She walked with a confidence she didn\u2019t have before,\neither. Her eyes, which normally avoided contact, now sought it. She\nwas breathtaking.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\nare you?\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d\nshe said, smiling broadly.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd\nyour work with the old folks?\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\ndidn\u2019t pan out, obviously,\u201d Liv said, opening the oven to check\non the roast, since Connie couldn\u2019t bend anymore.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d\nshe said. Liv checked on a bubbling pot.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo\nworries though. I found my calling,\u201d Liv said. \u201cI thought I was\nmeant to help people at the last stages of their life. Turns out I\u2019m\nmeant to help mums and little ones through the first.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo,\nyou\u2019re a\u2026.\u201d Alex said. The situation began to make sense.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\na midwife,\u201d she said with an uncharacteristic giggle. \u201cNot quite\nan obstetrician, but I do some of the same things.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nAlex said, putting her hand over her mouth.<br/></p><p>\u201cAfter\nmy experience with Monty, I wondered whether there could be something\nbetter. A practitioner who was both knowledgeable, and warm.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLike,\nnot a weirdo like my old OB?\u201d Alex said, laughing.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nsomething like that,\u201d Liv said. \u201cHad I known about midwives then,\nthings might\u2019ve gone another way.\u201d She looked at Alex. \u201cYou\nlook different.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cD\u2019you\nlike it? It\u2019s my New York artist look,\u201d she said, stroking her\nplatinum bob.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\nabout the colors?\u201d Liv said.<br/></p><p>Alex\nsat down. \u201cEveryone over there has colors, and too many piercings and tattoos to count. It\u2019s not edgy anymore to have pink hair or ink,\u201d she said,\nshrugging. \u201cNormies in the art world? Hella edgy.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNormies?\u201d\nLiv said, sitting across from her.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nknow. Not doing the multicolored pincushion thing,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cDo\nyou miss it?\u201d Liv said.<br/></p><p>\u201cNot\nreally,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI get paid to draw pretty things for large\ncompanies. I\u2019m very happy as I am.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\nis that?\u201d Liv said. She never imagined Alex could settle enough to\nfinish a degree, much less become a graphic designer for one of the\nmost respected firms on the East Coast.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nstressful, but in a good way. My boss isn\u2019t a cow, and she\u2019s\nreally open-minded,\u201d she said, biting her lip. \u201cThe pay\u2019s\ngreat. I can actually afford to live in Manhattan. Alphie might\u2019ve\nhad a hand in that.\u201d He knew anyone and everyone, it seemed. And\nslept with half of them.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\nis he?\u201d Liv said.<br/></p><p>\u201cGood,\nI guess. Still haunting his gallery for fresh meat in London,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant father, though. Ollie adores him.\u201d<br/></p><p>Liv\ntipped her head. \u201cIs that his name? Ollie?\u201d<br/></p><p>Color\nrose to her cheeks. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s a junior, but his middle name is\nOliver.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\na good name, Oliver,\u201d Liv said, and wiggled her brow. Alex looked\naround. She didn\u2019t notice that John and Connie had slipped away\nquietly.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo,\nyou\u2019re here for the birth,\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nLiv said. And perhaps a little longer, to help.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\namazing,\u201d Alex said, shaking her head. \u201cOlivia the midwife. Do\nyou miss practicing law?\u201d<br/></p><p>Olivia\u2019s\neyes widened. \u201cNot at all. I was a bitter, miserable\ncow. I don\u2019t even like to think about it,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nwere alright,\u201d Alex said. \u201cBut you look so much happier now.\nHow\u2019s Maude?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMaude,\u201d\nshe said, and sucked her teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening anymore.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh\nno,\u201d Alex said sincerely.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely woman, but, um, she\u2019s one of those kind of lesbians\nthat prefer the quiet life,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d\nAlex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\ndoesn\u2019t like children,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI didn\u2019t know that when we started dating, but since I was at mum\u2019s, we could go and do things all the time without Monty. Mum\nloves looking after him. But when I moved out and it was Monty and I,\nshe began to show her true colors.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay,\u201d Liv said, and shrugged. \u201cIt was a strangely easy breakup.\nI don\u2019t even remember crying.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLucky\nyou,\u201d Alex said. When she found out Alphie was cheating, she was\ninconsolable for weeks. It was a horrible rough patch that nearly\nmade her drop out of school, but John and Connie helped her through\nit.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry about Alphonse,\u201d Liv said, reaching across the table to\nsqueeze her hands. \u201cJohn told me it wasn\u2019t easy, but not much\nelse. Out of respect.\u201d<br/></p><p>Alex\nshook her head. \u201cYou live, you learn,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a bit\nfoolish then. Impulsive.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\ntalk as if you\u2019re heavy with years now,\u201d Liv said. \u201cYou\u2019re\nstill young. In any case, we all do foolish things when we\u2019re young\nand stupid, like go to law school, or wear paisley unironically.\u201d<br/></p><p>Alex\ngiggled. \u201cYou seeing anyone now?\u201d she said. Liv smiled. Al was a\nbit wiser, but she hadn\u2019t lost her boldness.<br/></p><p>\u201cNope.\nI\u2019ve been too busy. Everyone\u2019s having babies, like, all the\ntime,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cMe\nneither,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit obnoxious over there. I\ncompletely get what Connie was talking about. Makes my fud slam shut\njust to think about it.\u201d<br/></p><p>Liv\nhooted. \u201cYour mouth,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\nIt\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s bizarre. There are loads of well-kept,\npretentious twats everywhere, yet I\u2019m dry as the goddamned\nKalahari,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse? Only ten percent of \u2018em\ncan draw worth a damn. It\u2019s mostly rich kids looking for an\nidentity. It\u2019s kind of sad.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cPoor\nrich art kids,\u201d Liv said.<br/></p><p>\u201cConnie\nmay have grown up with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she\u2019s\nnothin\u2019 like \u2018em. No wonder she was mad to get away,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\nthe best,\u201d Liv said.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\nis,\u201d Alex said. When her and Alphonse broke up, Connie flew to the\nStates to take care of her. She laid beside her on many nights, dried\nher tears, and helped her take care of Ollie. To her own surprise,\nshe ended up leaning more on her than on John. \u201cConnie sort of \u2026\nchanged my life.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\nweird like that,\u201d John said, and walked to the fob. \u201cIs the roast\ndone? I\u2019m bloody starving.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\nConnie?\u201d Liv asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nhelped her onto the porch swing,\u201d he said. \u201cOh! I came in here\nfor some juice,\u201d he said, and went into the refrigerator. \u201cMy\nbride thirsts.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ntake it out to her,\u201d Liv said, and stood up. She turned back to\nAlex. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d Alex said. \u201cGlad you\u2019re here, I mean.\u201d She blushed.<br/></p><p>Liv\nwalked out, and John squeezed her shoulders.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo\nwhat d\u2019you reckon, huh?\u201d he said excitedly. He looked out the\nwindow at Connie and the kids.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\noutdone yourself, mate,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI thought\nshe couldn\u2019t have any more children after Lily.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the doctor said. She had to go on\nhormone treatments to conceive,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey did a number\non her, messed with her moods and her health, but we had Lily.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThen\nhow did <i>that</i>\nhappen?\u201d Liv said, holding her hands over her belly.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas Liv,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said that Connie\u2019s particular issues\nhad a more holistic solution,\u201d he said, holding his hands up in air\nquotes. \u201cI thought it was a bit mad \u2013 after everything she went\nthrough, how could her hormone imbalance be fixed with diet and\nvitamins and things? But it bloody worked.\u201d He slapped the counter.<br/></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat why she\u2019s here? To make sure it took?\u201d she said, looking at\nJohn. He hugged her tight.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\nwas here earlier for that,\u201d he said into her hair. \u201cBut we\u2019re\nout of the danger zone, damn it. Manny\u2019s healthy and nearly busting\nout of Connie\u2019s belly.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cManny?\nInteresting name,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cTechnically,\nit\u2019s John Manuel.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo\nhe\u2019s gonna be a junior too?\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cManuel is her dad\u2019s name, and two Johns will get\nconfusing, so \u2026 Manny.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nso happy for you,\u201d she said, and hugged him tighter. \u201cYou two\nhave a sweet set up here. Oh,\u201d she said, looking up at him, \u201cHow\u2019s\nbusiness?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBooming!\u201d\nhe said. \u201cBetween Connie\u2019s connections and Alphie\u2019s, I\u2019m\nbacklogged for two years. Did you see the barn?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\nIt\u2019s really red,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just\nconnections. You\u2019re bloody talented.\u201d<br/></p><p>John\nsmiled. \u201cIt\u2019s too small,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to\nbuild another one. And I had to hire four apprentices to help me. I\u2019m\ninterviewing for three more.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cExcuse\nthe hell out of me,\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nknow,\u201d he said, wriggling.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nsuch a dork,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nreally happy, Al,\u201d he said, and sat up on the counter. \u201cTo be\nhonest, I sometimes pinch myself. It\u2019s unreal.\u201d She pinched his\nside, and he slapped her hand away. \u201cTo think I was in that little\nhouse in Bristol, resigned to my fate four years ago. I thought I was\nnever gonna get another chance at happiness. I gave up on it. I was a\ntotal fuckup.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nweren\u2019t. Never,\u201d Alex said. \u201cAnd it was comin\u2019, mate. You are\none of the kindest, most brilliant, smartest, funniest people I know.\nIt was inevitable.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh\nhush, you. You haven\u2019t done so bad yourself.\u201d He tugged gently on\nher earlobe.<br/></p><p>\u201cSeriously.\nYou and Connie deserve each other \u2013 it sounds ominous, but it\u2019s\ntrue. You\u2019re both amazing.\u201d John smiled. \u201cSpeaking of being\nresigned to your fate, how\u2019s Mara?\u201d<br/></p><p>He\nsighed. \u201cIn L.A. with her new boyfriend last I heard, and that was\nover a year ago.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cEh,\u201d\nAlex said, looking out the window at the children running after each\nother in the grass. The little girl with the red hair hugged Monty,\nand he ran away, screaming.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd\nAddie? How&rsquo;s she adjusting?\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\na delight, and her and Lily are like blood sisters at this point,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ask about Mara anymore. Connie and I don\u2019t\npush it because when we mention her, she gets the most heartbreaking,\nconfused look on her face.\u201d His face crumpled.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd\nhow are you?\u201d Alex said. \u201cShe\u2019s, like, a clone of her. Is it\nhard?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nthought it might be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s\nnot Mara, if that makes any sense. She\u2019s sweet, and unselfish, and\nkind. It was a bit weird at first,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know\nwhether it\u2019s all her, or maybe Connie\u2019s influence, but I don\u2019t\ncare either way. She\u2019s ours.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nhave to say, you surprised me when you told me about the adoption. It\u2019s\u00a0mad,\u201d Alex said. \u201cBut after a bit of thought, it\nmakes sense. Who better than you, right?\u201d<br/></p><p>He\njumped off the counter and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you a secret,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cIt was Connie who talked me into it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d\nAlex said, surprised.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cAt first, I wanted to move on. Start fresh. And when Mara\ncontacted us with the idea, I thought it was another attempt to wrap\nme up in her life again. I didn\u2019t want any part of it. But Connie\ntook over, and asked her all the difficult questions. I thought Mara\nwould disappear since I wasn\u2019t the one engaging with her, but she\nwas dead serious. She really wanted to give Addie away.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo\nConnie was never weirded out about the idea of adopting your\nex-wife\u2019s love child with someone else?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo.\nShe wanted to adopt right away, but she was more concerned about how\nI felt about it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was patient, and didn\u2019t force\nthe idea on me. But we were having so much trouble conceiving at the\ntime and she really wanted to be a mother. She has so much love to\ngive \u2013 we both did, and in the end, there was no reason the\ndaughter should have to pay for the sins of the mother.\u201d<br/></p><p>Alex\nsqueezed his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go outside and love on Connie,\u201d\nshe said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\njoin you,\u201d he said. When they walked through the dining room, they\nheard pattering footsteps and a giggle. There were a few sugar\nflowers missing from the cake on the table.<br/></p><p>\u201cLily.\nShe\u2019s like a little mouse, getting into things,\u201d he said with a\nsmile. They walked outside and Connie had her legs up on the porch\nswing. Liv was out in the yard, playing with Addie, and John ran out\nand started chasing after them both.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\nare you doin\u2019, love?\u201d Alex said, and pulled up a chair beside\nher.<br/></p><p>\u201cAbout\nto burst,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cMy ankles are swollen, I have\nto pee every 15 minutes, and he\u2019s jumping on my diaphragm like a\ntrampoline.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo,\necstatic?\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cCompletely,\u201d\nshe said, and sighed contentedly. They watched the kids playing for a\nminute or two.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh,\nyour little mouse got into the cake,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>Connie\nlaughed. \u201cWatch this,\u201d she said, and put a serious face on.\n\u201cLily, get over here this instant!\u201d she yelled.<br/></p><p>The\nlittle girl ran around John and up the steps in front of her.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes,\nmami?\u201d she said, holding her hands behind her. She was the spitting\nimage of her father.<br/></p><p>\u201cA\nlittle bird told me that <i>someone</i> was eating the sugar flowers off the\ncake, even though you pinky promised that you wouldn\u2019t touch it\nbefore dinner,\u201d she said. The girl licked pink frosting from the\ncorner of her mouth. \u201cDo you have any idea who did it?\u201d<br/></p><p>Lily\nlooked down at her galoshes, then dropped to the floor and pulled\nthem off. \u201cMami, one of my zoom boots is loose,\u201d she said, and held\nher small booted foot up for her to see. The screw had broken off one\nof her ankle braces. Alex\u2019s eyes widened.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh\nno,\u201d Connie said, and Lily repeated it softly. \u201cJohn!\u201d He ran\nup and gave her a kiss. \u201cCould you get me the repair kit? In the\ndrawer by the stove.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs\none of Lily\u2019s zoom boots out?\u201d he said, and picked her up and\nlifted her over his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that! How will she fly?\u201d<br/></p><p>The\nlittle girl whooped and giggled as he carried her inside.<br/></p><p>\u201cZoom\nboots?\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nforgot to mention it \u2013 her braces. When she was born, one of her\nfeet twisted inward. John wanted to blame himself, but I didn\u2019t\nallow it. We found the best pediatric orthopedic surgeon we could\nafford, and he did what he does best. As you can see, she can move\naround at almost 100%. By the time she starts primary school, she\nwon\u2019t need it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut\nwhy <i>zoom</i>\nboots?\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\ndidn\u2019t want her to feel to different from other children, so we\ngave the brace a cool name. They help her run like the wind,\u201d she\nsaid. Addie ran up, with Ollie right behind her.<br/></p><p>\u201cCan\nI say hello, mum?\u201d Addie said. Connie nodded, and kissed the top of\nher head as the girl rubbed her belly and whispered. Her auburn hair\nwas red at the root with sweat.<br/></p><p>\u201cGo\ninside and tell da to put a hat on you,\u201d she said. Addie poked her\nlittle lips out and made a face.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf\nyou don\u2019t put on a hat, then you might get a cold, and if you do,\nthen you won\u2019t be able to see Manny when he comes,\u201d Connie said,\nraising her brows.<br/></p><p>Addie\ngasped and ran inside, screaming for her dad.<br/></p><p>Liv\nwalked up with Monty and sat nearby. \u201cDid you finally finish the\nplans for your greenhouse?\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cGreenhouse?\nWhere?\u201d Alex said. Ollie crawled into her lap and played with her\nhair. He was long due for a nap.<br/></p><p>Connie\ngiggled. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna build a greenhouse. It\u2019ll connect to the\nhouse by the living room,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo\nit\u2019s going to get even bigger?\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nConnie said. \u201cWe\u2019re in nowhere Scotland, but eventually, we\u2019ll\nstill have fresh cut flowers\u00a0all year,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>Alex\nshook her head. \u201cHow\u2019s your clientele taking all this?\u201d she\nsaid, waving at her belly.<br/></p><p>\u201cThey\ncan take it how they like. My family comes first,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn?\nI hear silence from inside. I don\u2019t like silence!\u201d she yelled.\nShe settled into the porch swing. \u201cTo be fair, for the first time\nsince I broke up with my ex, I had to cancel some gigs. I just can\u2019t\ndo anything until this one\u2019s out, and settled.\u201d She rubbed her\nbelly. \u201cBut, something wild happened when I let one of my clients\nknow I couldn\u2019t do their wedding.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d\nAlex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cThey\npostponed it,\u201d she said with a giggle. \u201cThey said they\u2019d wait\non me, and that there was no hurry. They\u2019re already two kids in!\u201d<br/></p><p>They\nall laughed.<br/></p><p>\u201cWeddings\nare serious business, I guess,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNeither\nwould I,\u201d Liv said, looking out for Monty. He ran back and forth\nalong the fence, jumping occasionally to get a better view of the\nsea.<br/></p><p>\u201cYour\nday will come, if you just wait awhile,\u201d Connie sang softly, and\nlooked at them both affectionately. They had changed so much, but\nthey were still so similar. Liv sighed.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngonna go check on John. Knowing him, he\u2019s having a tickle fight\nwith the girls instead of watching the fob,\u201d she said. Just as she\nstood up, Addie ran out with a blue cap on, with Lily close behind.<br/></p><p>\u201cNyooom!\u201d\nJohn said, barreling past in hot pursuit. \u201cAll better, sweetie?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d\nLily said, and ran toward Monty, her arms outstretched. Ollie jumped\nout of Alex\u2019s lap and ran toward the excitement.<br/></p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re\ndying to go down to the beach,\u201d John said. \u201cI can take them after\ndinner, if it\u2019s okay with you ladies?\u201d He nodded at Alex and Liv.<br/></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nAlex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cMonty\u2019d\nlove it,\u201d Liv said.<br/></p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d Connie sighed. \u201cBut I can barely walk.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ntake you down,\u201d he said.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;How?\nYou gonna carry me over your shoulder?&rdquo; Connie said.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse not. I&rsquo;ll throw you in a wheelbarrow.\u201d He giggled.<br/></p><p>\u201cWit,\u201d Connie said. She made a face at him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nput a nice fluffy blanket down for comfort,\u201d he said, wiggling his\nfingers.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nhate you,\u201d she said, pouting.<br/></p><p>He\nnuzzled her temple and kissed her. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said,\nand rested his hand on her belly.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nright. I don\u2019t,\u201d she said, and pulled him in for a kiss.<br/></p><p>\u201cMam,\nlook, the water!\u201d Ollie said, running back. \u201cIs there sharks?\u201d<br/></p><p>Liv\nperked up and looked at Alex. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the time I\nnearly got eaten by a bull shark in Costa Rica?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat you get for going scuba diving with an open wound,\u201d Connie\nsaid, rolling her eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cSo it\u2019s you telling stories now?\u201d Her eyebrow rose.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\ngot loads, if you want to hear them. It\u2019ll help to pass the time in\nthis wilderness,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not all near-death\nexperiences either. There\u2019s some juicy bits too.\u201d Liv looked at\nConnie. \u201cAnd the wound wasn\u2019t open. I cut my ankle on some coral.\nI was wearing a plaster.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBloody\nhell! Can\u2019t sharks smell a drop of blood from, like, miles off or\nsomething like that?\u201d Alex said, leaning forward.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\na common misconception,\u201d John horned in from the steps. \u201cThey can\ndetect blood in the water at around 500 meters, furthest. Still, you\nobviously had a death wish, Olivia,\u201d he said, and kissed the top of\nLily\u2019s head, who sat on his lap to listen to the story. Addie sat\nat Connie\u2019s feet.<br/></p><p>\u201cBut\nI didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t going to pass up the chance to dive with one\nof the best instructors in the country over a tiny little flesh\nwound,\u201d Liv said.<br/></p><p>\u201cWas\nshe, though?&ldquo; Connie said. \u201cYou nearly made that instructor poo\nherself once he saw that monster circling,\u201d Connie said.<br/></p><p>\u201cPfft,\nit was tiny. Like, only 4 feet long, tops. A baby,\u201d she said,\nholding back a laugh.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nlaughing now, but you were on therapy for a year after that,\u201d\nConnie said.<br/></p><p>Liv\nshrugged. \u201cI was a bit tightly wound back then. It\u2019s not news.\u201d\nJohn snorted. Liv swatted in his direction, but he ducked away with a\ngiggle. \u201cNeedless to say, things have changed. And I\u2019m willing to\ngive it another go. Maybe Australia this time?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cRight.\nHave a nice visit to the home of everything that\u2019s trying its best\nto kill you,\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nsurvived an all-girl\u2019s public school, and being a lawyer in London\nfor a decade. I know how to deal with bird-eating spiders,\ncrocodiles, and poisonous snakes,\u201d she said. \u201cEasy peasy.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFuck\nme, who are you?\u201d Alex said, shaking her head.<br/></p><p>&quot;Language!&rdquo;\nJohn and Connie said in unison. Alex flushed.<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry\nfor not doing this before,\u201d she said, smiling at Alex. John stood\nup and helped Connie into the house, with the children in tow.<br/></p><p>\u201cDid\nJohn tell you about the time I beat up a tweaker trying to mug me in\nNew York?\u201d Alex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cLies!\u201d\nLiv said.\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nshit you not,\u201d Alex said, holding both hands up. \u201cI\u2019d had the\nworst day ever, and I swear my adrenaline took over and I dropped him\nlike a sack of shit.\u201d<br/></p><p>The\nwind picked up, and they shivered. Liv\u2019s eyes lingered on Alex\u2019s\nface. She was even more beautiful than she remembered. She wondered\nwhat was going on in her head. Maude was responsible and kind, but\nultimately boring. Despite the gloss, Alex was still the woman she\nfell in love with \u2013 impetuous, outspoken, and sweet. She missed\nsweetness. Alex noticed her looking, and didn&rsquo;t shy away from her\ngaze.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\nshould go inside,\u201d Liv said, and rose. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting cold.&rdquo;\nShe held out her hand.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d\nlove to,\u201d Alex said, took it, and followed her into the house.<br/></p><p>THE END<br/></p><hr><p>Note: Thanks to everyone who showed interest, liked, and reblogged - you make my heart sing with a click.

What was I thinking?\u201d\nshe said. The ancient motor hicupped, then they rushed forward.<br></p><p>\u201cThe\ndrill?\u201d her son said, rolling the <i>r </i>in his mild French accent.<br></p><p>\u201cJohn\ndecided to build his house right by a bloody cliff, so-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cA\ncliff! A cliff! Is there a beach?\u201d he said, throwing his action\nfigure aside. The boy loved the water. He wiggled in his booster\nchair.<br></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, sweetie, but you do realize it\u2019s September?\u201d Alex said,\nlooking at him in the rearview. \u201cThe water\u2019s very cold. Brrrr.\u201d\nShe shivered.<br></p><p>\u201cI\ncan have a hot <i>bain</i>\nafterward,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll\nsee,\u201d she said. The little car struggled to get up the hill road.\nShe floored the gas pedal and prayed as they inched to the top, and\nthey both gasped together as they saw the newly completed home, set\noff by the endless blue of the Clyde Waters.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nbloody huge!\u201d she said to her son as she turned into their\ndriveway, which curved up to the hill where the house stood. Beside\nit, nearer to the ocean, was a large barn \u2013 his workshop.<br></p><p>\u201cLook,\nmama!\u201d he said, pointing to the barn.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\ncolor is it?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cRouge.\n<i>Red</i>!\u201d\nhe said, and clapped his hands. \u201cAre there cows in it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think so,\u201d Alex said. \u201cThat\u2019s were Uncle John makes his\nart.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOui. His tables and his chairs and his cabi \u2026 cabi \u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHis\ncabinets,\u201d Alex said, and reached back to caress his fat cheek. \u201cHe\ngets a lot of money for his cabinets.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nthat\u2019s good?\u201d he said. His chubby fingers wriggled over the\nseatbelt button.<br></p><p>\u201cFor\nhim, yes. When I stop the car, you are going to stay exactly where\nyou are, you hear?\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t know whether the cliff\nwas fenced, and her boy was a fast runner.<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\nmam,\u201d she said, and gave her a twinkly grin. She squinted at the\ncars parked in the driveway by the house. There was Connie\u2019s blue\nSUV, John\u2019s little sports car, and a Beamer. Her heart beat faster\nas she pulled up. A lot of people had red Beamers. Not only <i>her</i>.\nAnd she might\u2019ve changed her car years ago\u2026<br></p><p>\u201cAuntie\nAlex!\u201d John said, running up with open arms. Right behind him, two\nlittle girls ran up, with flapping coats and flowered galoshes. One\nof them had brown curls and round hazel eyes, and the other had\nflaming auburn hair and bright blue eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cAuntie\nAlex!\u201d they echoed, and hugged her legs.<br></p><p>\u201cHello,\nyou!\u201d she said, and hugged and kissed John, then the girls. They\nlooked into the open car door and screamed again when they saw her\nson.<br></p><p>\u201cCome\ninside. There\u2019s cake!\u201d Lily said. Her son undid the seat belt and\nwriggled out of the car.<br></p><p>\u201cWhoa\nthere!\u201d she said, taking his hand.<br></p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s\nperfectly safe. There\u2019s a fence,\u201d John said. Alex kissed him and\nlet go, and they ran into the house to announce her arrival.<br></p><p>She\nlooked up at him and giggled. \u201cFuck a duck, you\u2019ve gone full L.L.\nBean mountain man,\u201d she said, referring to his full beard. He wore\na soft gray beanie at a jaunty angle on his head.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nL.L. Bean? Sounds tasty.\u201d He winked, then rubbed his beard. \u201cIt\nhelps me fit in with the locals.\u201d He straightened up and narrowed\nhis eyes as he looked toward the water. \u201cDo I look local?\u201d he\nsaid, nudging her.<br></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nsaid. \u201cVery.\u201d<br></p><p>He\nturned to her with his usual puppy dog enthusiasm. \u201cD\u2019you like\nit?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\n<i>big</i>,\u201d\nshe said, looking up at the second-story gingerbread eaves, then to\nthe wraparound veranda. An empty porch swing swung in the cool ocean\nbreeze.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nall me. Once I got to the planning stage, I kept adding elements. It\ndrove Connie crazy, since she wanted it to be done already,\u201d he\nsaid with a widening grin. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna shit a brick.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\nshe said. Again, her heart rushed. The girls came back out, with\nanother boy in tow. Just as soon as he saw her, he brightened and ran\nfaster.<br></p><p>\u201cMonty!?\u201d\nAlex said as the boy slammed into her and hugged her.<br></p><p>\u201cAlex!\u201d\nhe said, and petted her slick blonde bob. \u201cPretty.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks,\nlove,\u201d she said, taking his face into her trembling hands. His blue\neyes were almost violet in the bright afternoon light, and his face\nwas losing its baby chubbiness.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nold are you now?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nfive,\u201d he said, holding up his hand. \u201cI\u2019m in proper school, not\nbaby school anymore,\u201d he said, nodding proudly.<br></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat so?\u201d Alex said. She couldn\u2019t say much more. She didn\u2019t\ncome prepared to see Olivia. But she was a bit \u2026 excited.<br></p><p>John\npatted Monty\u2019s curly head. \u201cKeep an eye on the cake. You know the\ngirls are dying to get into it,\u201d he said. Monty saluted and ran\naway.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you tell me, man?\u201d she said, looking down at her rumpled\ncoat. She checked her makeup in the sideview mirror.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a surprise to me,\u201d he said, popping the trunk to get her bags.\n\u201cI came back from getting lumber, and here they were, big as life\nsitting at our kitchen table.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nlong has she been here?\u201d she asked.<br></p><p>\u201cA\nfew hours,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s staying for a while, though.\u201d\nAgain, he gave her that mysterious grin.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Alex said. \u201cYou look like a cat that\nswallowed the canary.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\nsee,\u201d he said, and walked toward the house. She didn\u2019t move, and\nhe stopped. \u201cCome on. It\u2019ll be painless, I swear.\u201d<br></p><p>The\nhouse was deliciously warm, and smelled of food cooking.<br></p><p>\u201cWow,\nmate, you outdid yourself,\u201d she said in awe as she peeled off her\ncoat. The floors gleamed a warm purple, and most of the furniture had\nhis signature touch. \u201cIt\u2019s like, a show house or something.\u201d\nShe kicked off her galoshes and touched the white pine entryway\ncabinet. \u201cWhere\u2019s Connie?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIn\nthe kitchen, honey!\u201d Connie yelled. \u201cDinner\u2019s almost ready!\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\nran toward her voice, then nearly slid on her ass when she saw her.<br></p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d\nConnie said. She was \u2026 huge with child. Enormous. Rampant.<br></p><p>\u201cJohn,\nyou dog!\u201d she said, and gave Connie a hug. \u201cOh my God, how?\nWhen?\u201d She held Connie\u2019s belly in both hands.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nknow how,\u201d she said, and winked at her. \u201cAnd we got the surprise\nof our lives about 37 weeks ago.\u201d<br></p><p>John\nran in behind Connie and gave her a loud, smacking kiss on her neck.\nHe rubbed her belly and knelt to talk to it.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s\nthe weather in there, buddy? Staying warm?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNooo,\u201d\nConnie said, but she didn\u2019t push him away. She put her hands on her\nhips and closed her eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cWatch,\u201d\nJohn said with glee, and lifted Connie\u2019s shirt. He kissed her\nbelly, which was stretched shiny. \u201cHow\u2019s my sweet little boy? Say\nhello, son.\u201d Connie sucked in breath as life stirred in her belly.\nFirst, perhaps a knee, but then, almost too clearly, a tiny hand.<br></p><p>\u201cFuck,\nthat was a bloody hand!\u201d she said, pressing her hand over her own\nflat belly. Her son had been active when he was in the womb, but\nshe\u2019d never seen his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy! Congratulations, bruv!\u201d\nShe patted John\u2019s shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be a handful, if he\u2019s anything like his father,\u201d\na familiar voice said from the threshold. Olivia walked into the\nkitchen.<br></p><p>Alex\nstared. Her usually fluffy blonde hair was\nat least three shades darker, and up in a carefree ponytail. She was\nas slim as she ever was, but she gave off a different vibe. Warmer.\nMore inviting. She walked with a confidence she didn\u2019t have before,\neither. Her eyes, which normally avoided contact, now sought it. She\nwas breathtaking.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nare you?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d\nshe said, smiling broadly.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nyour work with the old folks?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\ndidn\u2019t pan out, obviously,\u201d Liv said, opening the oven to check\non the roast, since Connie couldn\u2019t bend anymore.<br></p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d\nshe said. Liv checked on a bubbling pot.<br></p><p>\u201cNo\nworries though. I found my calling,\u201d Liv said. \u201cI thought I was\nmeant to help people at the last stages of their life. Turns out I\u2019m\nmeant to help mums and little ones through the first.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\nyou\u2019re a\u2026.\u201d Alex said. The situation began to make sense.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\na midwife,\u201d she said with an uncharacteristic giggle. \u201cNot quite\nan obstetrician, but I do some of the same things.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nAlex said, putting her hand over her mouth.<br></p><p>\u201cAfter\nmy experience with Monty, I wondered whether there could be something\nbetter. A practitioner who was both knowledgeable, and warm.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike,\nnot a weirdo like my old OB?\u201d Alex said, laughing.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nsomething like that,\u201d Liv said. \u201cHad I known about midwives then,\nthings might\u2019ve gone another way.\u201d She looked at Alex. \u201cYou\nlook different.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cD\u2019you\nlike it? It\u2019s my New York artist look,\u201d she said, stroking her\nplatinum bob.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nabout the colors?\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>Alex\nsat down. \u201cEveryone over there has colors, and too many piercings and tattoos to count. It\u2019s not edgy anymore to have pink hair or ink,\u201d she said,\nshrugging. \u201cNormies in the art world? Hella edgy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNormies?\u201d\nLiv said, sitting across from her.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nknow. Not doing the multicolored pincushion thing,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cDo\nyou miss it?\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cNot\nreally,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI get paid to draw pretty things for large\ncompanies. I\u2019m very happy as I am.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nis that?\u201d Liv said. She never imagined Alex could settle enough to\nfinish a degree, much less become a graphic designer for one of the\nmost respected firms on the East Coast.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nstressful, but in a good way. My boss isn\u2019t a cow, and she\u2019s\nreally open-minded,\u201d she said, biting her lip. \u201cThe pay\u2019s\ngreat. I can actually afford to live in Manhattan. Alphie might\u2019ve\nhad a hand in that.\u201d He knew anyone and everyone, it seemed. And\nslept with half of them.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nis he?\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cGood,\nI guess. Still haunting his gallery for fresh meat in London,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant father, though. Ollie adores him.\u201d<br></p><p>Liv\ntipped her head. \u201cIs that his name? Ollie?\u201d<br></p><p>Color\nrose to her cheeks. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s a junior, but his middle name is\nOliver.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\na good name, Oliver,\u201d Liv said, and wiggled her brow. Alex looked\naround. She didn\u2019t notice that John and Connie had slipped away\nquietly.<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\nyou\u2019re here for the birth,\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nLiv said. And perhaps a little longer, to help.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\namazing,\u201d Alex said, shaking her head. \u201cOlivia the midwife. Do\nyou miss practicing law?\u201d<br></p><p>Olivia\u2019s\neyes widened. \u201cNot at all. I was a bitter, miserable\ncow. I don\u2019t even like to think about it,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nwere alright,\u201d Alex said. \u201cBut you look so much happier now.\nHow\u2019s Maude?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMaude,\u201d\nshe said, and sucked her teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening anymore.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh\nno,\u201d Alex said sincerely.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely woman, but, um, she\u2019s one of those kind of lesbians\nthat prefer the quiet life,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d\nAlex said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\ndoesn\u2019t like children,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI didn\u2019t know that when we started dating, but since I was at mum\u2019s, we could go and do things all the time without Monty. Mum\nloves looking after him. But when I moved out and it was Monty and I,\nshe began to show her true colors.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay,\u201d Liv said, and shrugged. \u201cIt was a strangely easy breakup.\nI don\u2019t even remember crying.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLucky\nyou,\u201d Alex said. When she found out Alphie was cheating, she was\ninconsolable for weeks. It was a horrible rough patch that nearly\nmade her drop out of school, but John and Connie helped her through\nit.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry about Alphonse,\u201d Liv said, reaching across the table to\nsqueeze her hands. \u201cJohn told me it wasn\u2019t easy, but not much\nelse. Out of respect.\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\nshook her head. \u201cYou live, you learn,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a bit\nfoolish then. Impulsive.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\ntalk as if you\u2019re heavy with years now,\u201d Liv said. \u201cYou\u2019re\nstill young. In any case, we all do foolish things when we\u2019re young\nand stupid, like go to law school, or wear paisley unironically.\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\ngiggled. \u201cYou seeing anyone now?\u201d she said. Liv smiled. Al was a\nbit wiser, but she hadn\u2019t lost her boldness.<br></p><p>\u201cNope.\nI\u2019ve been too busy. Everyone\u2019s having babies, like, all the\ntime,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cMe\nneither,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit obnoxious over there. I\ncompletely get what Connie was talking about. Makes my fud slam shut\njust to think about it.\u201d<br></p><p>Liv\nhooted. \u201cYour mouth,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\nIt\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s bizarre. There are loads of well-kept,\npretentious twats everywhere, yet I\u2019m dry as the goddamned\nKalahari,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse? Only ten percent of \u2018em\ncan draw worth a damn. It\u2019s mostly rich kids looking for an\nidentity. It\u2019s kind of sad.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cPoor\nrich art kids,\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cConnie\nmay have grown up with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she\u2019s\nnothin\u2019 like \u2018em. No wonder she was mad to get away,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\nthe best,\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\nis,\u201d Alex said. When her and Alphonse broke up, Connie flew to the\nStates to take care of her. She laid beside her on many nights, dried\nher tears, and helped her take care of Ollie. To her own surprise,\nshe ended up leaning more on her than on John. \u201cConnie sort of \u2026\nchanged my life.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\nweird like that,\u201d John said, and walked to the fob. \u201cIs the roast\ndone? I\u2019m bloody starving.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\nConnie?\u201d Liv asked.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nhelped her onto the porch swing,\u201d he said. \u201cOh! I came in here\nfor some juice,\u201d he said, and went into the refrigerator. \u201cMy\nbride thirsts.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ntake it out to her,\u201d Liv said, and stood up. She turned back to\nAlex. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d Alex said. \u201cGlad you\u2019re here, I mean.\u201d She blushed.<br></p><p>Liv\nwalked out, and John squeezed her shoulders.<br></p><p>\u201cSo\nwhat d\u2019you reckon, huh?\u201d he said excitedly. He looked out the\nwindow at Connie and the kids.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\noutdone yourself, mate,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI thought\nshe couldn\u2019t have any more children after Lily.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the doctor said. She had to go on\nhormone treatments to conceive,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey did a number\non her, messed with her moods and her health, but we had Lily.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThen\nhow did <i>that</i>\nhappen?\u201d Liv said, holding her hands over her belly.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas Liv,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said that Connie\u2019s particular issues\nhad a more holistic solution,\u201d he said, holding his hands up in air\nquotes. \u201cI thought it was a bit mad \u2013 after everything she went\nthrough, how could her hormone imbalance be fixed with diet and\nvitamins and things? But it bloody worked.\u201d He slapped the counter.<br></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat why she\u2019s here? To make sure it took?\u201d she said, looking at\nJohn. He hugged her tight.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\nwas here earlier for that,\u201d he said into her hair. \u201cBut we\u2019re\nout of the danger zone, damn it. Manny\u2019s healthy and nearly busting\nout of Connie\u2019s belly.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cManny?\nInteresting name,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cTechnically,\nit\u2019s John Manuel.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo\nhe\u2019s gonna be a junior too?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cManuel is her dad\u2019s name, and two Johns will get\nconfusing, so \u2026 Manny.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nso happy for you,\u201d she said, and hugged him tighter. \u201cYou two\nhave a sweet set up here. Oh,\u201d she said, looking up at him, \u201cHow\u2019s\nbusiness?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBooming!\u201d\nhe said. \u201cBetween Connie\u2019s connections and Alphie\u2019s, I\u2019m\nbacklogged for two years. Did you see the barn?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\nIt\u2019s really red,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just\nconnections. You\u2019re bloody talented.\u201d<br></p><p>John\nsmiled. \u201cIt\u2019s too small,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to\nbuild another one. And I had to hire four apprentices to help me. I\u2019m\ninterviewing for three more.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cExcuse\nthe hell out of me,\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nknow,\u201d he said, wriggling.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nsuch a dork,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nreally happy, Al,\u201d he said, and sat up on the counter. \u201cTo be\nhonest, I sometimes pinch myself. It\u2019s unreal.\u201d She pinched his\nside, and he slapped her hand away. \u201cTo think I was in that little\nhouse in Bristol, resigned to my fate four years ago. I thought I was\nnever gonna get another chance at happiness. I gave up on it. I was a\ntotal fuckup.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nweren\u2019t. Never,\u201d Alex said. \u201cAnd it was comin\u2019, mate. You are\none of the kindest, most brilliant, smartest, funniest people I know.\nIt was inevitable.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh\nhush, you. You haven\u2019t done so bad yourself.\u201d He tugged gently on\nher earlobe.<br></p><p>\u201cSeriously.\nYou and Connie deserve each other \u2013 it sounds ominous, but it\u2019s\ntrue. You\u2019re both amazing.\u201d John smiled. \u201cSpeaking of being\nresigned to your fate, how\u2019s Mara?\u201d<br></p><p>He\nsighed. \u201cIn L.A. with her new boyfriend last I heard, and that was\nover a year ago.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cEh,\u201d\nAlex said, looking out the window at the children running after each\nother in the grass. The little girl with the red hair hugged Monty,\nand he ran away, screaming.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nAddie? How\u2019s she adjusting?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\na delight, and her and Lily are like blood sisters at this point,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ask about Mara anymore. Connie and I don\u2019t\npush it because when we mention her, she gets the most heartbreaking,\nconfused look on her face.\u201d His face crumpled.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nhow are you?\u201d Alex said. \u201cShe\u2019s, like, a clone of her. Is it\nhard?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nthought it might be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s\nnot Mara, if that makes any sense. She\u2019s sweet, and unselfish, and\nkind. It was a bit weird at first,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know\nwhether it\u2019s all her, or maybe Connie\u2019s influence, but I don\u2019t\ncare either way. She\u2019s ours.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nhave to say, you surprised me when you told me about the adoption. It\u2019s\u00a0mad,\u201d Alex said. \u201cBut after a bit of thought, it\nmakes sense. Who better than you, right?\u201d<br></p><p>He\njumped off the counter and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you a secret,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cIt was Connie who talked me into it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d\nAlex said, surprised.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cAt first, I wanted to move on. Start fresh. And when Mara\ncontacted us with the idea, I thought it was another attempt to wrap\nme up in her life again. I didn\u2019t want any part of it. But Connie\ntook over, and asked her all the difficult questions. I thought Mara\nwould disappear since I wasn\u2019t the one engaging with her, but she\nwas dead serious. She really wanted to give Addie away.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo\nConnie was never weirded out about the idea of adopting your\nex-wife\u2019s love child with someone else?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\nShe wanted to adopt right away, but she was more concerned about how\nI felt about it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was patient, and didn\u2019t force\nthe idea on me. But we were having so much trouble conceiving at the\ntime and she really wanted to be a mother. She has so much love to\ngive \u2013 we both did, and in the end, there was no reason the\ndaughter should have to pay for the sins of the mother.\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\nsqueezed his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go outside and love on Connie,\u201d\nshe said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\njoin you,\u201d he said. When they walked through the dining room, they\nheard pattering footsteps and a giggle. There were a few sugar\nflowers missing from the cake on the table.<br></p><p>\u201cLily.\nShe\u2019s like a little mouse, getting into things,\u201d he said with a\nsmile. They walked outside and Connie had her legs up on the porch\nswing. Liv was out in the yard, playing with Addie, and John ran out\nand started chasing after them both.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nare you doin\u2019, love?\u201d Alex said, and pulled up a chair beside\nher.<br></p><p>\u201cAbout\nto burst,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cMy ankles are swollen, I have\nto pee every 15 minutes, and he\u2019s jumping on my diaphragm like a\ntrampoline.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\necstatic?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cCompletely,\u201d\nshe said, and sighed contentedly. They watched the kids playing for a\nminute or two.<br></p><p>\u201cOh,\nyour little mouse got into the cake,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>Connie\nlaughed. \u201cWatch this,\u201d she said, and put a serious face on.\n\u201cLily, get over here this instant!\u201d she yelled.<br></p><p>The\nlittle girl ran around John and up the steps in front of her.<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\nmami?\u201d she said, holding her hands behind her. She was the spitting\nimage of her father.<br></p><p>\u201cA\nlittle bird told me that <i>someone</i> was eating the sugar flowers off the\ncake, even though you pinky promised that you wouldn\u2019t touch it\nbefore dinner,\u201d she said. The girl licked pink frosting from the\ncorner of her mouth. \u201cDo you have any idea who did it?\u201d<br></p><p>Lily\nlooked down at her galoshes, then dropped to the floor and pulled\nthem off. \u201cMami, one of my zoom boots is loose,\u201d she said, and held\nher small booted foot up for her to see. The screw had broken off one\nof her ankle braces. Alex\u2019s eyes widened.<br></p><p>\u201cOh\nno,\u201d Connie said, and Lily repeated it softly. \u201cJohn!\u201d He ran\nup and gave her a kiss. \u201cCould you get me the repair kit? In the\ndrawer by the stove.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs\none of Lily\u2019s zoom boots out?\u201d he said, and picked her up and\nlifted her over his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that! How will she fly?\u201d<br></p><p>The\nlittle girl whooped and giggled as he carried her inside.<br></p><p>\u201cZoom\nboots?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nforgot to mention it \u2013 her braces. When she was born, one of her\nfeet twisted inward. John wanted to blame himself, but I didn\u2019t\nallow it. We found the best pediatric orthopedic surgeon we could\nafford, and he did what he does best. As you can see, she can move\naround at almost 100%. By the time she starts primary school, she\nwon\u2019t need it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut\nwhy <i>zoom</i>\nboots?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\ndidn\u2019t want her to feel to different from other children, so we\ngave the brace a cool name. They help her run like the wind,\u201d she\nsaid. Addie ran up, with Ollie right behind her.<br></p><p>\u201cCan\nI say hello, mum?\u201d Addie said. Connie nodded, and kissed the top of\nher head as the girl rubbed her belly and whispered. Her auburn hair\nwas red at the root with sweat.<br></p><p>\u201cGo\ninside and tell da to put a hat on you,\u201d she said. Addie poked her\nlittle lips out and made a face.<br></p><p>\u201cIf\nyou don\u2019t put on a hat, then you might get a cold, and if you do,\nthen you won\u2019t be able to see Manny when he comes,\u201d Connie said,\nraising her brows.<br></p><p>Addie\ngasped and ran inside, screaming for her dad.<br></p><p>Liv\nwalked up with Monty and sat nearby. \u201cDid you finally finish the\nplans for your greenhouse?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cGreenhouse?\nWhere?\u201d Alex said. Ollie crawled into her lap and played with her\nhair. He was long due for a nap.<br></p><p>Connie\ngiggled. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna build a greenhouse. It\u2019ll connect to the\nhouse by the living room,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cSo\nit\u2019s going to get even bigger?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nConnie said. \u201cWe\u2019re in nowhere Scotland, but eventually, we\u2019ll\nstill have fresh cut flowers\u00a0all year,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>Alex\nshook her head. \u201cHow\u2019s your clientele taking all this?\u201d she\nsaid, waving at her belly.<br></p><p>\u201cThey\ncan take it how they like. My family comes first,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn?\nI hear silence from inside. I don\u2019t like silence!\u201d she yelled.\nShe settled into the porch swing. \u201cTo be fair, for the first time\nsince I broke up with my ex, I had to cancel some gigs. I just can\u2019t\ndo anything until this one\u2019s out, and settled.\u201d She rubbed her\nbelly. \u201cBut, something wild happened when I let one of my clients\nknow I couldn\u2019t do their wedding.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d\nAlex said.<br></p><p>\u201cThey\npostponed it,\u201d she said with a giggle. \u201cThey said they\u2019d wait\non me, and that there was no hurry. They\u2019re already two kids in!\u201d<br></p><p>They\nall laughed.<br></p><p>\u201cWeddings\nare serious business, I guess,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNeither\nwould I,\u201d Liv said, looking out for Monty. He ran back and forth\nalong the fence, jumping occasionally to get a better view of the\nsea.<br></p><p>\u201cYour\nday will come, if you just wait awhile,\u201d Connie sang softly, and\nlooked at them both affectionately. They had changed so much, but\nthey were still so similar. Liv sighed.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngonna go check on John. Knowing him, he\u2019s having a tickle fight\nwith the girls instead of watching the fob,\u201d she said. Just as she\nstood up, Addie ran out with a blue cap on, with Lily close behind.<br></p><p>\u201cNyooom!\u201d\nJohn said, barreling past in hot pursuit. \u201cAll better, sweetie?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d\nLily said, and ran toward Monty, her arms outstretched. Ollie jumped\nout of Alex\u2019s lap and ran toward the excitement.<br></p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re\ndying to go down to the beach,\u201d John said. \u201cI can take them after\ndinner, if it\u2019s okay with you ladies?\u201d He nodded at Alex and Liv.<br></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nAlex said.<br></p><p>\u201cMonty\u2019d\nlove it,\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d Connie sighed. \u201cBut I can barely walk.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ntake you down,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>\u201cHow?\nYou gonna carry me over your shoulder?\u201d Connie said.<br></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse not. I\u2019ll throw you in a wheelbarrow.\u201d He giggled.<br></p><p>\u201cWit,\u201d Connie said. She made a face at him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nput a nice fluffy blanket down for comfort,\u201d he said, wiggling his\nfingers.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nhate you,\u201d she said, pouting.<br></p><p>He\nnuzzled her temple and kissed her. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said,\nand rested his hand on her belly.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nright. I don\u2019t,\u201d she said, and pulled him in for a kiss.<br></p><p>\u201cMam,\nlook, the water!\u201d Ollie said, running back. \u201cIs there sharks?\u201d<br></p><p>Liv\nperked up and looked at Alex. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the time I\nnearly got eaten by a bull shark in Costa Rica?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat you get for going scuba diving with an open wound,\u201d Connie\nsaid, rolling her eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cSo it\u2019s you telling stories now?\u201d Her eyebrow rose.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\ngot loads, if you want to hear them. It\u2019ll help to pass the time in\nthis wilderness,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not all near-death\nexperiences either. There\u2019s some juicy bits too.\u201d Liv looked at\nConnie. \u201cAnd the wound wasn\u2019t open. I cut my ankle on some coral.\nI was wearing a plaster.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBloody\nhell! Can\u2019t sharks smell a drop of blood from, like, miles off or\nsomething like that?\u201d Alex said, leaning forward.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\na common misconception,\u201d John horned in from the steps. \u201cThey can\ndetect blood in the water at around 500 meters, furthest. Still, you\nobviously had a death wish, Olivia,\u201d he said, and kissed the top of\nLily\u2019s head, who sat on his lap to listen to the story. Addie sat\nat Connie\u2019s feet.<br></p><p>\u201cBut\nI didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t going to pass up the chance to dive with one\nof the best instructors in the country over a tiny little flesh\nwound,\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cWas\nshe, though?\u201c Connie said. \u201cYou nearly made that instructor poo\nherself once he saw that monster circling,\u201d Connie said.<br></p><p>\u201cPfft,\nit was tiny. Like, only 4 feet long, tops. A baby,\u201d she said,\nholding back a laugh.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nlaughing now, but you were on therapy for a year after that,\u201d\nConnie said.<br></p><p>Liv\nshrugged. \u201cI was a bit tightly wound back then. It\u2019s not news.\u201d\nJohn snorted. Liv swatted in his direction, but he ducked away with a\ngiggle. \u201cNeedless to say, things have changed. And I\u2019m willing to\ngive it another go. Maybe Australia this time?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRight.\nHave a nice visit to the home of everything that\u2019s trying its best\nto kill you,\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nsurvived an all-girl\u2019s public school, and being a lawyer in London\nfor a decade. I know how to deal with bird-eating spiders,\ncrocodiles, and poisonous snakes,\u201d she said. \u201cEasy peasy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFuck\nme, who are you?\u201d Alex said, shaking her head.<br></p><p>\"Language!\u201d\nJohn and Connie said in unison. Alex flushed.<br></p><p>\u201cSorry\nfor not doing this before,\u201d she said, smiling at Alex. John stood\nup and helped Connie into the house, with the children in tow.<br></p><p>\u201cDid\nJohn tell you about the time I beat up a tweaker trying to mug me in\nNew York?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cLies!\u201d\nLiv said.\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nshit you not,\u201d Alex said, holding both hands up. \u201cI\u2019d had the\nworst day ever, and I swear my adrenaline took over and I dropped him\nlike a sack of shit.\u201d<br></p><p>The\nwind picked up, and they shivered. Liv\u2019s eyes lingered on Alex\u2019s\nface. She was even more beautiful than she remembered. She wondered\nwhat was going on in her head. Maude was responsible and kind, but\nultimately boring. Despite the gloss, Alex was still the woman she\nfell in love with \u2013 impetuous, outspoken, and sweet. She missed\nsweetness. Alex noticed her looking, and didn\u2019t shy away from her\ngaze.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe\nshould go inside,\u201d Liv said, and rose. \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold.\u201d\nShe held out her hand.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d\nlove to,\u201d Alex said, took it, and followed her into the house.<br></p><p>THE END<br></p><hr><p>Note: Thanks to everyone who showed interest, liked, and reblogged - you make my heart sing with a click.

What was I thinking?\u201d\nshe said. The ancient motor hicupped, then they rushed forward.<br></p><p>\u201cThe\ndrill?\u201d her son said, rolling the <i>r </i>in his mild French accent.<br></p><p>\u201cJohn\ndecided to build his house right by a bloody cliff, so-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cA\ncliff! A cliff! Is there a beach?\u201d he said, throwing his action\nfigure aside. The boy loved the water. He wiggled in his booster\nchair.<br></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, sweetie, but you do realize it\u2019s September?\u201d Alex said,\nlooking at him in the rearview. \u201cThe water\u2019s very cold. Brrrr.\u201d\nShe shivered.<br></p><p>\u201cI\ncan have a hot <i>bain</i>\nafterward,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll\nsee,\u201d she said. The little car struggled to get up the hill road.\nShe floored the gas pedal and prayed as they inched to the top, and\nthey both gasped together as they saw the newly completed home, set\noff by the endless blue of the Clyde Waters.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nbloody huge!\u201d she said to her son as she turned into their\ndriveway, which curved up to the hill where the house stood. Beside\nit, nearer to the ocean, was a large barn \u2013 his workshop.<br></p><p>\u201cLook,\nmama!\u201d he said, pointing to the barn.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\ncolor is it?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cRouge.\n<i>Red</i>!\u201d\nhe said, and clapped his hands. \u201cAre there cows in it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think so,\u201d Alex said. \u201cThat\u2019s were Uncle John makes his\nart.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOui. His tables and his chairs and his cabi \u2026 cabi \u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHis\ncabinets,\u201d Alex said, and reached back to caress his fat cheek. \u201cHe\ngets a lot of money for his cabinets.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nthat\u2019s good?\u201d he said. His chubby fingers wriggled over the\nseatbelt button.<br></p><p>\u201cFor\nhim, yes. When I stop the car, you are going to stay exactly where\nyou are, you hear?\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t know whether the cliff\nwas fenced, and her boy was a fast runner.<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\nmam,\u201d she said, and gave her a twinkly grin. She squinted at the\ncars parked in the driveway by the house. There was Connie\u2019s blue\nSUV, John\u2019s little sports car, and a Beamer. Her heart beat faster\nas she pulled up. A lot of people had red Beamers. Not only <i>her</i>.\nAnd she might\u2019ve changed her car years ago\u2026<br></p><p>\u201cAuntie\nAlex!\u201d John said, running up with open arms. Right behind him, two\nlittle girls ran up, with flapping coats and flowered galoshes. One\nof them had brown curls and round hazel eyes, and the other had\nflaming auburn hair and bright blue eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cAuntie\nAlex!\u201d they echoed, and hugged her legs.<br></p><p>\u201cHello,\nyou!\u201d she said, and hugged and kissed John, then the girls. They\nlooked into the open car door and screamed again when they saw her\nson.<br></p><p>\u201cCome\ninside. There\u2019s cake!\u201d Lily said. Her son undid the seat belt and\nwriggled out of the car.<br></p><p>\u201cWhoa\nthere!\u201d she said, taking his hand.<br></p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s\nperfectly safe. There\u2019s a fence,\u201d John said. Alex kissed him and\nlet go, and they ran into the house to announce her arrival.<br></p><p>She\nlooked up at him and giggled. \u201cFuck a duck, you\u2019ve gone full L.L.\nBean mountain man,\u201d she said, referring to his full beard. He wore\na soft gray beanie at a jaunty angle on his head.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nL.L. Bean? Sounds tasty.\u201d He winked, then rubbed his beard. \u201cIt\nhelps me fit in with the locals.\u201d He straightened up and narrowed\nhis eyes as he looked toward the water. \u201cDo I look local?\u201d he\nsaid, nudging her.<br></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nsaid. \u201cVery.\u201d<br></p><p>He\nturned to her with his usual puppy dog enthusiasm. \u201cD\u2019you like\nit?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\n<i>big</i>,\u201d\nshe said, looking up at the second-story gingerbread eaves, then to\nthe wraparound veranda. An empty porch swing swung in the cool ocean\nbreeze.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nall me. Once I got to the planning stage, I kept adding elements. It\ndrove Connie crazy, since she wanted it to be done already,\u201d he\nsaid with a widening grin. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna shit a brick.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\nshe said. Again, her heart rushed. The girls came back out, with\nanother boy in tow. Just as soon as he saw her, he brightened and ran\nfaster.<br></p><p>\u201cMonty!?\u201d\nAlex said as the boy slammed into her and hugged her.<br></p><p>\u201cAlex!\u201d\nhe said, and petted her slick blonde bob. \u201cPretty.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks,\nlove,\u201d she said, taking his face into her trembling hands. His blue\neyes were almost violet in the bright afternoon light, and his face\nwas losing its baby chubbiness.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nold are you now?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nfive,\u201d he said, holding up his hand. \u201cI\u2019m in proper school, not\nbaby school anymore,\u201d he said, nodding proudly.<br></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat so?\u201d Alex said. She couldn\u2019t say much more. She didn\u2019t\ncome prepared to see Olivia. But she was a bit \u2026 excited.<br></p><p>John\npatted Monty\u2019s curly head. \u201cKeep an eye on the cake. You know the\ngirls are dying to get into it,\u201d he said. Monty saluted and ran\naway.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you tell me, man?\u201d she said, looking down at her rumpled\ncoat. She checked her makeup in the sideview mirror.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a surprise to me,\u201d he said, popping the trunk to get her bags.\n\u201cI came back from getting lumber, and here they were, big as life\nsitting at our kitchen table.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nlong has she been here?\u201d she asked.<br></p><p>\u201cA\nfew hours,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s staying for a while, though.\u201d\nAgain, he gave her that mysterious grin.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Alex said. \u201cYou look like a cat that\nswallowed the canary.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\nsee,\u201d he said, and walked toward the house. She didn\u2019t move, and\nhe stopped. \u201cCome on. It\u2019ll be painless, I swear.\u201d<br></p><p>The\nhouse was deliciously warm, and smelled of food cooking.<br></p><p>\u201cWow,\nmate, you outdid yourself,\u201d she said in awe as she peeled off her\ncoat. The floors gleamed a warm purple, and most of the furniture had\nhis signature touch. \u201cIt\u2019s like, a show house or something.\u201d\nShe kicked off her galoshes and touched the white pine entryway\ncabinet. \u201cWhere\u2019s Connie?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIn\nthe kitchen, honey!\u201d Connie yelled. \u201cDinner\u2019s almost ready!\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\nran toward her voice, then nearly slid on her ass when she saw her.<br></p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d\nConnie said. She was \u2026 huge with child. Enormous. Rampant.<br></p><p>\u201cJohn,\nyou dog!\u201d she said, and gave Connie a hug. \u201cOh my God, how?\nWhen?\u201d She held Connie\u2019s belly in both hands.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nknow how,\u201d she said, and winked at her. \u201cAnd we got the surprise\nof our lives about 37 weeks ago.\u201d<br></p><p>John\nran in behind Connie and gave her a loud, smacking kiss on her neck.\nHe rubbed her belly and knelt to talk to it.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s\nthe weather in there, buddy? Staying warm?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNooo,\u201d\nConnie said, but she didn\u2019t push him away. She put her hands on her\nhips and closed her eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cWatch,\u201d\nJohn said with glee, and lifted Connie\u2019s shirt. He kissed her\nbelly, which was stretched shiny. \u201cHow\u2019s my sweet little boy? Say\nhello, son.\u201d Connie sucked in breath as life stirred in her belly.\nFirst, perhaps a knee, but then, almost too clearly, a tiny hand.<br></p><p>\u201cFuck,\nthat was a bloody hand!\u201d she said, pressing her hand over her own\nflat belly. Her son had been active when he was in the womb, but\nshe\u2019d never seen his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy! Congratulations, bruv!\u201d\nShe patted John\u2019s shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be a handful, if he\u2019s anything like his father,\u201d\na familiar voice said from the threshold. Olivia walked into the\nkitchen.<br></p><p>Alex\nstared. Her usually fluffy blonde hair was\nat least three shades darker, and up in a carefree ponytail. She was\nas slim as she ever was, but she gave off a different vibe. Warmer.\nMore inviting. She walked with a confidence she didn\u2019t have before,\neither. Her eyes, which normally avoided contact, now sought it. She\nwas breathtaking.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nare you?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d\nshe said, smiling broadly.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nyour work with the old folks?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\ndidn\u2019t pan out, obviously,\u201d Liv said, opening the oven to check\non the roast, since Connie couldn\u2019t bend anymore.<br></p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d\nshe said. Liv checked on a bubbling pot.<br></p><p>\u201cNo\nworries though. I found my calling,\u201d Liv said. \u201cI thought I was\nmeant to help people at the last stages of their life. Turns out I\u2019m\nmeant to help mums and little ones through the first.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\nyou\u2019re a\u2026.\u201d Alex said. The situation began to make sense.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\na midwife,\u201d she said with an uncharacteristic giggle. \u201cNot quite\nan obstetrician, but I do some of the same things.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nAlex said, putting her hand over her mouth.<br></p><p>\u201cAfter\nmy experience with Monty, I wondered whether there could be something\nbetter. A practitioner who was both knowledgeable, and warm.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike,\nnot a weirdo like my old OB?\u201d Alex said, laughing.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nsomething like that,\u201d Liv said. \u201cHad I known about midwives then,\nthings might\u2019ve gone another way.\u201d She looked at Alex. \u201cYou\nlook different.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cD\u2019you\nlike it? It\u2019s my New York artist look,\u201d she said, stroking her\nplatinum bob.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nabout the colors?\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>Alex\nsat down. \u201cEveryone over there has colors, and too many piercings and tattoos to count. It\u2019s not edgy anymore to have pink hair or ink,\u201d she said,\nshrugging. \u201cNormies in the art world? Hella edgy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNormies?\u201d\nLiv said, sitting across from her.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nknow. Not doing the multicolored pincushion thing,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cDo\nyou miss it?\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cNot\nreally,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI get paid to draw pretty things for large\ncompanies. I\u2019m very happy as I am.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nis that?\u201d Liv said. She never imagined Alex could settle enough to\nfinish a degree, much less become a graphic designer for one of the\nmost respected firms on the East Coast.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nstressful, but in a good way. My boss isn\u2019t a cow, and she\u2019s\nreally open-minded,\u201d she said, biting her lip. \u201cThe pay\u2019s\ngreat. I can actually afford to live in Manhattan. Alphie might\u2019ve\nhad a hand in that.\u201d He knew anyone and everyone, it seemed. And\nslept with half of them.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nis he?\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cGood,\nI guess. Still haunting his gallery for fresh meat in London,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant father, though. Ollie adores him.\u201d<br></p><p>Liv\ntipped her head. \u201cIs that his name? Ollie?\u201d<br></p><p>Color\nrose to her cheeks. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s a junior, but his middle name is\nOliver.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\na good name, Oliver,\u201d Liv said, and wiggled her brow. Alex looked\naround. She didn\u2019t notice that John and Connie had slipped away\nquietly.<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\nyou\u2019re here for the birth,\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nLiv said. And perhaps a little longer, to help.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\namazing,\u201d Alex said, shaking her head. \u201cOlivia the midwife. Do\nyou miss practicing law?\u201d<br></p><p>Olivia\u2019s\neyes widened. \u201cNot at all. I was a bitter, miserable\ncow. I don\u2019t even like to think about it,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nwere alright,\u201d Alex said. \u201cBut you look so much happier now.\nHow\u2019s Maude?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMaude,\u201d\nshe said, and sucked her teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening anymore.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh\nno,\u201d Alex said sincerely.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely woman, but, um, she\u2019s one of those kind of lesbians\nthat prefer the quiet life,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d\nAlex said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\ndoesn\u2019t like children,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI didn\u2019t know that when we started dating, but since I was at mum\u2019s, we could go and do things all the time without Monty. Mum\nloves looking after him. But when I moved out and it was Monty and I,\nshe began to show her true colors.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay,\u201d Liv said, and shrugged. \u201cIt was a strangely easy breakup.\nI don\u2019t even remember crying.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLucky\nyou,\u201d Alex said. When she found out Alphie was cheating, she was\ninconsolable for weeks. It was a horrible rough patch that nearly\nmade her drop out of school, but John and Connie helped her through\nit.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry about Alphonse,\u201d Liv said, reaching across the table to\nsqueeze her hands. \u201cJohn told me it wasn\u2019t easy, but not much\nelse. Out of respect.\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\nshook her head. \u201cYou live, you learn,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a bit\nfoolish then. Impulsive.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\ntalk as if you\u2019re heavy with years now,\u201d Liv said. \u201cYou\u2019re\nstill young. In any case, we all do foolish things when we\u2019re young\nand stupid, like go to law school, or wear paisley unironically.\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\ngiggled. \u201cYou seeing anyone now?\u201d she said. Liv smiled. Al was a\nbit wiser, but she hadn\u2019t lost her boldness.<br></p><p>\u201cNope.\nI\u2019ve been too busy. Everyone\u2019s having babies, like, all the\ntime,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cMe\nneither,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit obnoxious over there. I\ncompletely get what Connie was talking about. Makes my fud slam shut\njust to think about it.\u201d<br></p><p>Liv\nhooted. \u201cYour mouth,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\nIt\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s bizarre. There are loads of well-kept,\npretentious twats everywhere, yet I\u2019m dry as the goddamned\nKalahari,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse? Only ten percent of \u2018em\ncan draw worth a damn. It\u2019s mostly rich kids looking for an\nidentity. It\u2019s kind of sad.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cPoor\nrich art kids,\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cConnie\nmay have grown up with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she\u2019s\nnothin\u2019 like \u2018em. No wonder she was mad to get away,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\nthe best,\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\nis,\u201d Alex said. When her and Alphonse broke up, Connie flew to the\nStates to take care of her. She laid beside her on many nights, dried\nher tears, and helped her take care of Ollie. To her own surprise,\nshe ended up leaning more on her than on John. \u201cConnie sort of \u2026\nchanged my life.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\nweird like that,\u201d John said, and walked to the fob. \u201cIs the roast\ndone? I\u2019m bloody starving.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\nConnie?\u201d Liv asked.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nhelped her onto the porch swing,\u201d he said. \u201cOh! I came in here\nfor some juice,\u201d he said, and went into the refrigerator. \u201cMy\nbride thirsts.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ntake it out to her,\u201d Liv said, and stood up. She turned back to\nAlex. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d Alex said. \u201cGlad you\u2019re here, I mean.\u201d She blushed.<br></p><p>Liv\nwalked out, and John squeezed her shoulders.<br></p><p>\u201cSo\nwhat d\u2019you reckon, huh?\u201d he said excitedly. He looked out the\nwindow at Connie and the kids.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\noutdone yourself, mate,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI thought\nshe couldn\u2019t have any more children after Lily.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the doctor said. She had to go on\nhormone treatments to conceive,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey did a number\non her, messed with her moods and her health, but we had Lily.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThen\nhow did <i>that</i>\nhappen?\u201d Liv said, holding her hands over her belly.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas Liv,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said that Connie\u2019s particular issues\nhad a more holistic solution,\u201d he said, holding his hands up in air\nquotes. \u201cI thought it was a bit mad \u2013 after everything she went\nthrough, how could her hormone imbalance be fixed with diet and\nvitamins and things? But it bloody worked.\u201d He slapped the counter.<br></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat why she\u2019s here? To make sure it took?\u201d she said, looking at\nJohn. He hugged her tight.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\nwas here earlier for that,\u201d he said into her hair. \u201cBut we\u2019re\nout of the danger zone, damn it. Manny\u2019s healthy and nearly busting\nout of Connie\u2019s belly.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cManny?\nInteresting name,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cTechnically,\nit\u2019s John Manuel.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo\nhe\u2019s gonna be a junior too?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cManuel is her dad\u2019s name, and two Johns will get\nconfusing, so \u2026 Manny.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nso happy for you,\u201d she said, and hugged him tighter. \u201cYou two\nhave a sweet set up here. Oh,\u201d she said, looking up at him, \u201cHow\u2019s\nbusiness?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBooming!\u201d\nhe said. \u201cBetween Connie\u2019s connections and Alphie\u2019s, I\u2019m\nbacklogged for two years. Did you see the barn?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\nIt\u2019s really red,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just\nconnections. You\u2019re bloody talented.\u201d<br></p><p>John\nsmiled. \u201cIt\u2019s too small,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to\nbuild another one. And I had to hire four apprentices to help me. I\u2019m\ninterviewing for three more.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cExcuse\nthe hell out of me,\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nknow,\u201d he said, wriggling.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nsuch a dork,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nreally happy, Al,\u201d he said, and sat up on the counter. \u201cTo be\nhonest, I sometimes pinch myself. It\u2019s unreal.\u201d She pinched his\nside, and he slapped her hand away. \u201cTo think I was in that little\nhouse in Bristol, resigned to my fate four years ago. I thought I was\nnever gonna get another chance at happiness. I gave up on it. I was a\ntotal fuckup.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nweren\u2019t. Never,\u201d Alex said. \u201cAnd it was comin\u2019, mate. You are\none of the kindest, most brilliant, smartest, funniest people I know.\nIt was inevitable.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh\nhush, you. You haven\u2019t done so bad yourself.\u201d He tugged gently on\nher earlobe.<br></p><p>\u201cSeriously.\nYou and Connie deserve each other \u2013 it sounds ominous, but it\u2019s\ntrue. You\u2019re both amazing.\u201d John smiled. \u201cSpeaking of being\nresigned to your fate, how\u2019s Mara?\u201d<br></p><p>He\nsighed. \u201cIn L.A. with her new boyfriend last I heard, and that was\nover a year ago.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cEh,\u201d\nAlex said, looking out the window at the children running after each\nother in the grass. The little girl with the red hair hugged Monty,\nand he ran away, screaming.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nAddie? How\u2019s she adjusting?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\na delight, and her and Lily are like blood sisters at this point,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ask about Mara anymore. Connie and I don\u2019t\npush it because when we mention her, she gets the most heartbreaking,\nconfused look on her face.\u201d His face crumpled.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nhow are you?\u201d Alex said. \u201cShe\u2019s, like, a clone of her. Is it\nhard?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nthought it might be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s\nnot Mara, if that makes any sense. She\u2019s sweet, and unselfish, and\nkind. It was a bit weird at first,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know\nwhether it\u2019s all her, or maybe Connie\u2019s influence, but I don\u2019t\ncare either way. She\u2019s ours.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nhave to say, you surprised me when you told me about the adoption. It\u2019s\u00a0mad,\u201d Alex said. \u201cBut after a bit of thought, it\nmakes sense. Who better than you, right?\u201d<br></p><p>He\njumped off the counter and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you a secret,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cIt was Connie who talked me into it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d\nAlex said, surprised.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cAt first, I wanted to move on. Start fresh. And when Mara\ncontacted us with the idea, I thought it was another attempt to wrap\nme up in her life again. I didn\u2019t want any part of it. But Connie\ntook over, and asked her all the difficult questions. I thought Mara\nwould disappear since I wasn\u2019t the one engaging with her, but she\nwas dead serious. She really wanted to give Addie away.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo\nConnie was never weirded out about the idea of adopting your\nex-wife\u2019s love child with someone else?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\nShe wanted to adopt right away, but she was more concerned about how\nI felt about it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was patient, and didn\u2019t force\nthe idea on me. But we were having so much trouble conceiving at the\ntime and she really wanted to be a mother. She has so much love to\ngive \u2013 we both did, and in the end, there was no reason the\ndaughter should have to pay for the sins of the mother.\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\nsqueezed his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go outside and love on Connie,\u201d\nshe said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\njoin you,\u201d he said. When they walked through the dining room, they\nheard pattering footsteps and a giggle. There were a few sugar\nflowers missing from the cake on the table.<br></p><p>\u201cLily.\nShe\u2019s like a little mouse, getting into things,\u201d he said with a\nsmile. They walked outside and Connie had her legs up on the porch\nswing. Liv was out in the yard, playing with Addie, and John ran out\nand started chasing after them both.<br></p><p>\u201cHow\nare you doin\u2019, love?\u201d Alex said, and pulled up a chair beside\nher.<br></p><p>\u201cAbout\nto burst,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cMy ankles are swollen, I have\nto pee every 15 minutes, and he\u2019s jumping on my diaphragm like a\ntrampoline.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\necstatic?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cCompletely,\u201d\nshe said, and sighed contentedly. They watched the kids playing for a\nminute or two.<br></p><p>\u201cOh,\nyour little mouse got into the cake,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>Connie\nlaughed. \u201cWatch this,\u201d she said, and put a serious face on.\n\u201cLily, get over here this instant!\u201d she yelled.<br></p><p>The\nlittle girl ran around John and up the steps in front of her.<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\nmami?\u201d she said, holding her hands behind her. She was the spitting\nimage of her father.<br></p><p>\u201cA\nlittle bird told me that <i>someone</i> was eating the sugar flowers off the\ncake, even though you pinky promised that you wouldn\u2019t touch it\nbefore dinner,\u201d she said. The girl licked pink frosting from the\ncorner of her mouth. \u201cDo you have any idea who did it?\u201d<br></p><p>Lily\nlooked down at her galoshes, then dropped to the floor and pulled\nthem off. \u201cMami, one of my zoom boots is loose,\u201d she said, and held\nher small booted foot up for her to see. The screw had broken off one\nof her ankle braces. Alex\u2019s eyes widened.<br></p><p>\u201cOh\nno,\u201d Connie said, and Lily repeated it softly. \u201cJohn!\u201d He ran\nup and gave her a kiss. \u201cCould you get me the repair kit? In the\ndrawer by the stove.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs\none of Lily\u2019s zoom boots out?\u201d he said, and picked her up and\nlifted her over his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that! How will she fly?\u201d<br></p><p>The\nlittle girl whooped and giggled as he carried her inside.<br></p><p>\u201cZoom\nboots?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nforgot to mention it \u2013 her braces. When she was born, one of her\nfeet twisted inward. John wanted to blame himself, but I didn\u2019t\nallow it. We found the best pediatric orthopedic surgeon we could\nafford, and he did what he does best. As you can see, she can move\naround at almost 100%. By the time she starts primary school, she\nwon\u2019t need it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut\nwhy <i>zoom</i>\nboots?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\ndidn\u2019t want her to feel to different from other children, so we\ngave the brace a cool name. They help her run like the wind,\u201d she\nsaid. Addie ran up, with Ollie right behind her.<br></p><p>\u201cCan\nI say hello, mum?\u201d Addie said. Connie nodded, and kissed the top of\nher head as the girl rubbed her belly and whispered. Her auburn hair\nwas red at the root with sweat.<br></p><p>\u201cGo\ninside and tell da to put a hat on you,\u201d she said. Addie poked her\nlittle lips out and made a face.<br></p><p>\u201cIf\nyou don\u2019t put on a hat, then you might get a cold, and if you do,\nthen you won\u2019t be able to see Manny when he comes,\u201d Connie said,\nraising her brows.<br></p><p>Addie\ngasped and ran inside, screaming for her dad.<br></p><p>Liv\nwalked up with Monty and sat nearby. \u201cDid you finally finish the\nplans for your greenhouse?\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cGreenhouse?\nWhere?\u201d Alex said. Ollie crawled into her lap and played with her\nhair. He was long due for a nap.<br></p><p>Connie\ngiggled. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna build a greenhouse. It\u2019ll connect to the\nhouse by the living room,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cSo\nit\u2019s going to get even bigger?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nConnie said. \u201cWe\u2019re in nowhere Scotland, but eventually, we\u2019ll\nstill have fresh cut flowers\u00a0all year,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>Alex\nshook her head. \u201cHow\u2019s your clientele taking all this?\u201d she\nsaid, waving at her belly.<br></p><p>\u201cThey\ncan take it how they like. My family comes first,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn?\nI hear silence from inside. I don\u2019t like silence!\u201d she yelled.\nShe settled into the porch swing. \u201cTo be fair, for the first time\nsince I broke up with my ex, I had to cancel some gigs. I just can\u2019t\ndo anything until this one\u2019s out, and settled.\u201d She rubbed her\nbelly. \u201cBut, something wild happened when I let one of my clients\nknow I couldn\u2019t do their wedding.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d\nAlex said.<br></p><p>\u201cThey\npostponed it,\u201d she said with a giggle. \u201cThey said they\u2019d wait\non me, and that there was no hurry. They\u2019re already two kids in!\u201d<br></p><p>They\nall laughed.<br></p><p>\u201cWeddings\nare serious business, I guess,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNeither\nwould I,\u201d Liv said, looking out for Monty. He ran back and forth\nalong the fence, jumping occasionally to get a better view of the\nsea.<br></p><p>\u201cYour\nday will come, if you just wait awhile,\u201d Connie sang softly, and\nlooked at them both affectionately. They had changed so much, but\nthey were still so similar. Liv sighed.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngonna go check on John. Knowing him, he\u2019s having a tickle fight\nwith the girls instead of watching the fob,\u201d she said. Just as she\nstood up, Addie ran out with a blue cap on, with Lily close behind.<br></p><p>\u201cNyooom!\u201d\nJohn said, barreling past in hot pursuit. \u201cAll better, sweetie?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d\nLily said, and ran toward Monty, her arms outstretched. Ollie jumped\nout of Alex\u2019s lap and ran toward the excitement.<br></p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re\ndying to go down to the beach,\u201d John said. \u201cI can take them after\ndinner, if it\u2019s okay with you ladies?\u201d He nodded at Alex and Liv.<br></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nAlex said.<br></p><p>\u201cMonty\u2019d\nlove it,\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d Connie sighed. \u201cBut I can barely walk.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ntake you down,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>\u201cHow?\nYou gonna carry me over your shoulder?\u201d Connie said.<br></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse not. I\u2019ll throw you in a wheelbarrow.\u201d He giggled.<br></p><p>\u201cWit,\u201d Connie said. She made a face at him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nput a nice fluffy blanket down for comfort,\u201d he said, wiggling his\nfingers.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nhate you,\u201d she said, pouting.<br></p><p>He\nnuzzled her temple and kissed her. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said,\nand rested his hand on her belly.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nright. I don\u2019t,\u201d she said, and pulled him in for a kiss.<br></p><p>\u201cMam,\nlook, the water!\u201d Ollie said, running back. \u201cIs there sharks?\u201d<br></p><p>Liv\nperked up and looked at Alex. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the time I\nnearly got eaten by a bull shark in Costa Rica?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat you get for going scuba diving with an open wound,\u201d Connie\nsaid, rolling her eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cSo it\u2019s you telling stories now?\u201d Her eyebrow rose.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\ngot loads, if you want to hear them. It\u2019ll help to pass the time in\nthis wilderness,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not all near-death\nexperiences either. There\u2019s some juicy bits too.\u201d Liv looked at\nConnie. \u201cAnd the wound wasn\u2019t open. I cut my ankle on some coral.\nI was wearing a plaster.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBloody\nhell! Can\u2019t sharks smell a drop of blood from, like, miles off or\nsomething like that?\u201d Alex said, leaning forward.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\na common misconception,\u201d John horned in from the steps. \u201cThey can\ndetect blood in the water at around 500 meters, furthest. Still, you\nobviously had a death wish, Olivia,\u201d he said, and kissed the top of\nLily\u2019s head, who sat on his lap to listen to the story. Addie sat\nat Connie\u2019s feet.<br></p><p>\u201cBut\nI didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t going to pass up the chance to dive with one\nof the best instructors in the country over a tiny little flesh\nwound,\u201d Liv said.<br></p><p>\u201cWas\nshe, though?\u201c Connie said. \u201cYou nearly made that instructor poo\nherself once he saw that monster circling,\u201d Connie said.<br></p><p>\u201cPfft,\nit was tiny. Like, only 4 feet long, tops. A baby,\u201d she said,\nholding back a laugh.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nlaughing now, but you were on therapy for a year after that,\u201d\nConnie said.<br></p><p>Liv\nshrugged. \u201cI was a bit tightly wound back then. It\u2019s not news.\u201d\nJohn snorted. Liv swatted in his direction, but he ducked away with a\ngiggle. \u201cNeedless to say, things have changed. And I\u2019m willing to\ngive it another go. Maybe Australia this time?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRight.\nHave a nice visit to the home of everything that\u2019s trying its best\nto kill you,\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nsurvived an all-girl\u2019s public school, and being a lawyer in London\nfor a decade. I know how to deal with bird-eating spiders,\ncrocodiles, and poisonous snakes,\u201d she said. \u201cEasy peasy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFuck\nme, who are you?\u201d Alex said, shaking her head.<br></p><p>\"Language!\u201d\nJohn and Connie said in unison. Alex flushed.<br></p><p>\u201cSorry\nfor not doing this before,\u201d she said, smiling at Alex. John stood\nup and helped Connie into the house, with the children in tow.<br></p><p>\u201cDid\nJohn tell you about the time I beat up a tweaker trying to mug me in\nNew York?\u201d Alex said.<br></p><p>\u201cLies!\u201d\nLiv said.\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nshit you not,\u201d Alex said, holding both hands up. \u201cI\u2019d had the\nworst day ever, and I swear my adrenaline took over and I dropped him\nlike a sack of shit.\u201d<br></p><p>The\nwind picked up, and they shivered. Liv\u2019s eyes lingered on Alex\u2019s\nface. She was even more beautiful than she remembered. She wondered\nwhat was going on in her head. Maude was responsible and kind, but\nultimately boring. Despite the gloss, Alex was still the woman she\nfell in love with \u2013 impetuous, outspoken, and sweet. She missed\nsweetness. Alex noticed her looking, and didn\u2019t shy away from her\ngaze.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe\nshould go inside,\u201d Liv said, and rose. \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold.\u201d\nShe held out her hand.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d\nlove to,\u201d Alex said, took it, and followed her into the house.<br></p><p>THE END<br></p><hr><p>Note: Thanks to everyone who showed interest, liked, and reblogged - you make my heart sing with a click.

The ancient motor hicupped, then they rushed forward.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The\ndrill?&rdquo; her son said, rolling the <i>r </i>in his mild French accent.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;John\ndecided to build his house right by a bloody cliff, so-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A\ncliff! A cliff! Is there a beach?&rdquo; he said, throwing his action\nfigure aside. The boy loved the water.

Brrrr.&rdquo;\nShe shivered.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\ncan have a hot <i>bain</i>\nafterward,&rdquo; he said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll\nsee,&rdquo; she said. The little car struggled to get up the hill road.\nShe floored the gas pedal and prayed as they inched to the top, and\nthey both gasped together as they saw the newly completed home, set\noff by the endless blue of the Clyde Waters.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nbloody huge!&rdquo; she said to her son as she turned into their\ndriveway, which curved up to the hill where the house stood. Beside\nit, nearer to the ocean, was a large barn &ndash; his workshop.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Look,\nmama!&rdquo; he said, pointing to the barn.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\ncolor is it?&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Rouge.\n<i>Red</i>!&rdquo;\nhe said, and clapped his hands. &ldquo;Are there cows in it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s were Uncle John makes his\nart.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oui.

His chubby fingers wriggled over the\nseatbelt button.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;For\nhim, yes. When I stop the car, you are going to stay exactly where\nyou are, you hear?&rdquo; she said. She didn&rsquo;t know whether the cliff\nwas fenced, and her boy was a fast runner.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nmam,&rdquo; she said, and gave her a twinkly grin. She squinted at the\ncars parked in the driveway by the house. There was Connie&rsquo;s blue\nSUV, John&rsquo;s little sports car, and a Beamer. Her heart beat faster\nas she pulled up. A lot of people had red Beamers. Not only <i>her</i>.\nAnd she might&rsquo;ve changed her car years ago&hellip;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Auntie\nAlex!&rdquo; John said, running up with open arms.

Her son undid the seat belt and\nwriggled out of the car.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Whoa\nthere!&rdquo; she said, taking his hand.<br /></p><p>&rdquo;It&rsquo;s\nperfectly safe. There&rsquo;s a fence,&rdquo; John said. Alex kissed him and\nlet go, and they ran into the house to announce her arrival.<br /></p><p>She\nlooked up at him and giggled. &ldquo;Fuck a duck, you&rsquo;ve gone full L.L.\nBean mountain man,&rdquo; she said, referring to his full beard. He wore\na soft gray beanie at a jaunty angle on his head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nL.L. Bean? Sounds tasty.&rdquo; He winked, then rubbed his beard. &ldquo;It\nhelps me fit in with the locals.&rdquo; He straightened up and narrowed\nhis eyes as he looked toward the water. &ldquo;Do I look local?&rdquo; he\nsaid, nudging her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nsaid. &ldquo;Very.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He\nturned to her with his usual puppy dog enthusiasm. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you like\nit?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\n<i>big</i>,&rdquo;\nshe said, looking up at the second-story gingerbread eaves, then to\nthe wraparound veranda. An empty porch swing swung in the cool ocean\nbreeze.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nall me. Once I got to the planning stage, I kept adding elements. It\ndrove Connie crazy, since she wanted it to be done already,&rdquo; he\nsaid with a widening grin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna shit a brick.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;\nshe said. Again, her heart rushed. The girls came back out, with\nanother boy in tow. Just as soon as he saw her, he brightened and ran\nfaster.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Monty!?&rdquo;\nAlex said as the boy slammed into her and hugged her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alex!&rdquo;\nhe said, and petted her slick blonde bob. &ldquo;Pretty.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,\nlove,&rdquo; she said, taking his face into her trembling hands. His blue\neyes were almost violet in the bright afternoon light, and his face\nwas losing its baby chubbiness.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How\nold are you now?&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nfive,&rdquo; he said, holding up his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in proper school, not\nbaby school anymore,&rdquo; he said, nodding proudly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is\nthat so?&rdquo; Alex said. She couldn&rsquo;t say much more. She didn&rsquo;t\ncome prepared to see Olivia. But she was a bit &hellip; excited.<br /></p><p>John\npatted Monty&rsquo;s curly head. &ldquo;Keep an eye on the cake. You know the\ngirls are dying to get into it,&rdquo; he said. Monty saluted and ran\naway.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why\ndidn&rsquo;t you tell me, man?&rdquo; she said, looking down at her rumpled\ncoat. She checked her makeup in the sideview mirror.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas a surprise to me,&rdquo; he said, popping the trunk to get her bags.\n&ldquo;I came back from getting lumber, and here they were, big as life\nsitting at our kitchen table.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How\nlong has she been here?&rdquo; she asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A\nfew hours,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s staying for a while, though.&rdquo;\nAgain, he gave her that mysterious grin.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay,\nwhat&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;You look like a cat that\nswallowed the canary.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll\nsee,&rdquo; he said, and walked toward the house. She didn&rsquo;t move, and\nhe stopped. &ldquo;Come on. It&rsquo;ll be painless, I swear.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The\nhouse was deliciously warm, and smelled of food cooking.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow,\nmate, you outdid yourself,&rdquo; she said in awe as she peeled off her\ncoat. The floors gleamed a warm purple, and most of the furniture had\nhis signature touch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, a show house or something.&rdquo;\nShe kicked off her galoshes and touched the white pine entryway\ncabinet. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Connie?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;In\nthe kitchen, honey!&rdquo; Connie yelled. &ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s almost ready!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Alex\nran toward her voice, then nearly slid on her ass when she saw her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Surprise,&rdquo;\nConnie said. She was &hellip; huge with child. Enormous. Rampant.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;John,\nyou dog!&rdquo; she said, and gave Connie a hug. &ldquo;Oh my God, how?\nWhen?&rdquo; She held Connie&rsquo;s belly in both hands.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nknow how,&rdquo; she said, and winked at her. &ldquo;And we got the surprise\nof our lives about 37 weeks ago.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>John\nran in behind Connie and gave her a loud, smacking kiss on her neck.\nHe rubbed her belly and knelt to talk to it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s\nthe weather in there, buddy? Staying warm?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nooo,&rdquo;\nConnie said, but she didn&rsquo;t push him away. She put her hands on her\nhips and closed her eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Watch,&rdquo;\nJohn said with glee, and lifted Connie&rsquo;s shirt. He kissed her\nbelly, which was stretched shiny. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s my sweet little boy? Say\nhello, son.&rdquo; Connie sucked in breath as life stirred in her belly.\nFirst, perhaps a knee, but then, almost too clearly, a tiny hand.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,\nthat was a bloody hand!&rdquo; she said, pressing her hand over her own\nflat belly. Her son had been active when he was in the womb, but\nshe&rsquo;d never seen his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy! Congratulations, bruv!&rdquo;\nShe patted John&rsquo;s shoulder.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a handful, if he&rsquo;s anything like his father,&rdquo;\na familiar voice said from the threshold. Olivia walked into the\nkitchen.<br /></p><p>Alex\nstared. Her usually fluffy blonde hair was\nat least three shades darker, and up in a carefree ponytail. She was\nas slim as she ever was, but she gave off a different vibe. Warmer.\nMore inviting. She walked with a confidence she didn&rsquo;t have before,\neither. Her eyes, which normally avoided contact, now sought it. She\nwas breathtaking.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How\nare you?&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;\nshe said, smiling broadly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And\nyour work with the old folks?&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That\ndidn&rsquo;t pan out, obviously,&rdquo; Liv said, opening the oven to check\non the roast, since Connie couldn&rsquo;t bend anymore.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;\nshe said. Liv checked on a bubbling pot.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No\nworries though. I found my calling,&rdquo; Liv said. &ldquo;I thought I was\nmeant to help people at the last stages of their life. Turns out I&rsquo;m\nmeant to help mums and little ones through the first.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So,\nyou&rsquo;re a&hellip;.&rdquo; Alex said. The situation began to make sense.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\na midwife,&rdquo; she said with an uncharacteristic giggle. &ldquo;Not quite\nan obstetrician, but I do some of the same things.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo;\nAlex said, putting her hand over her mouth.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;After\nmy experience with Monty, I wondered whether there could be something\nbetter. A practitioner who was both knowledgeable, and warm.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like,\nnot a weirdo like my old OB?&rdquo; Alex said, laughing.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nsomething like that,&rdquo; Liv said. &ldquo;Had I known about midwives then,\nthings might&rsquo;ve gone another way.&rdquo; She looked at Alex. &ldquo;You\nlook different.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you\nlike it? It&rsquo;s my New York artist look,&rdquo; she said, stroking her\nplatinum bob.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\nabout the colors?&rdquo; Liv said.<br /></p><p>Alex\nsat down. &ldquo;Everyone over there has colors, and too many piercings and tattoos to count. It&rsquo;s not edgy anymore to have pink hair or ink,&rdquo; she said,\nshrugging. &ldquo;Normies in the art world? Hella edgy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Normies?&rdquo;\nLiv said, sitting across from her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nknow. Not doing the multicolored pincushion thing,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do\nyou miss it?&rdquo; Liv said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not\nreally,&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;I get paid to draw pretty things for large\ncompanies. I&rsquo;m very happy as I am.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How\nis that?&rdquo; Liv said. She never imagined Alex could settle enough to\nfinish a degree, much less become a graphic designer for one of the\nmost respected firms on the East Coast.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nstressful, but in a good way. My boss isn&rsquo;t a cow, and she&rsquo;s\nreally open-minded,&rdquo; she said, biting her lip. &ldquo;The pay&rsquo;s\ngreat. I can actually afford to live in Manhattan. Alphie might&rsquo;ve\nhad a hand in that.&rdquo; He knew anyone and everyone, it seemed. And\nslept with half of them.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How\nis he?&rdquo; Liv said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good,\nI guess. Still haunting his gallery for fresh meat in London,&rdquo; she\nsaid. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a brilliant father, though. Ollie adores him.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Liv\ntipped her head. &ldquo;Is that his name? Ollie?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Color\nrose to her cheeks. &ldquo;Yeah. He&rsquo;s a junior, but his middle name is\nOliver.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\na good name, Oliver,&rdquo; Liv said, and wiggled her brow. Alex looked\naround. She didn&rsquo;t notice that John and Connie had slipped away\nquietly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So,\nyou&rsquo;re here for the birth,&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;\nLiv said. And perhaps a little longer, to help.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\namazing,&rdquo; Alex said, shaking her head. &ldquo;Olivia the midwife. Do\nyou miss practicing law?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Olivia&rsquo;s\neyes widened. &ldquo;Not at all. I was a bitter, miserable\ncow. I don&rsquo;t even like to think about it,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nwere alright,&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;But you look so much happier now.\nHow&rsquo;s Maude?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maude,&rdquo;\nshe said, and sucked her teeth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not happening anymore.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nno,&rdquo; Alex said sincerely.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a lovely woman, but, um, she&rsquo;s one of those kind of lesbians\nthat prefer the quiet life,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;\nAlex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She\ndoesn&rsquo;t like children,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo;\nAlex said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nI didn&rsquo;t know that when we started dating, but since I was at mum&rsquo;s, we could go and do things all the time without Monty. Mum\nloves looking after him. But when I moved out and it was Monty and I,\nshe began to show her true colors.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo;\nAlex said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nokay,&rdquo; Liv said, and shrugged. &ldquo;It was a strangely easy breakup.\nI don&rsquo;t even remember crying.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lucky\nyou,&rdquo; Alex said. When she found out Alphie was cheating, she was\ninconsolable for weeks. It was a horrible rough patch that nearly\nmade her drop out of school, but John and Connie helped her through\nit.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry about Alphonse,&rdquo; Liv said, reaching across the table to\nsqueeze her hands. &ldquo;John told me it wasn&rsquo;t easy, but not much\nelse. Out of respect.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Alex\nshook her head. &ldquo;You live, you learn,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was a bit\nfoolish then. Impulsive.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\ntalk as if you&rsquo;re heavy with years now,&rdquo; Liv said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nstill young. In any case, we all do foolish things when we&rsquo;re young\nand stupid, like go to law school, or wear paisley unironically.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Alex\ngiggled. &ldquo;You seeing anyone now?&rdquo; she said. Liv smiled. Al was a\nbit wiser, but she hadn&rsquo;t lost her boldness.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nope.\nI&rsquo;ve been too busy. Everyone&rsquo;s having babies, like, all the\ntime,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me\nneither,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit obnoxious over there. I\ncompletely get what Connie was talking about. Makes my fud slam shut\njust to think about it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Liv\nhooted. &ldquo;Your mouth,&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?\nIt&rsquo;s the truth. It&rsquo;s bizarre. There are loads of well-kept,\npretentious twats everywhere, yet I&rsquo;m dry as the goddamned\nKalahari,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s worse? Only ten percent of &lsquo;em\ncan draw worth a damn. It&rsquo;s mostly rich kids looking for an\nidentity. It&rsquo;s kind of sad.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Poor\nrich art kids,&rdquo; Liv said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Connie\nmay have grown up with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she&rsquo;s\nnothin&rsquo; like &lsquo;em. No wonder she was mad to get away,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s\nthe best,&rdquo; Liv said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She\nis,&rdquo; Alex said. When her and Alphonse broke up, Connie flew to the\nStates to take care of her. She laid beside her on many nights, dried\nher tears, and helped her take care of Ollie. To her own surprise,\nshe ended up leaning more on her than on John. &ldquo;Connie sort of &hellip;\nchanged my life.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s\nweird like that,&rdquo; John said, and walked to the fob. &ldquo;Is the roast\ndone? I&rsquo;m bloody starving.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s\nConnie?&rdquo; Liv asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nhelped her onto the porch swing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh! I came in here\nfor some juice,&rdquo; he said, and went into the refrigerator. &ldquo;My\nbride thirsts.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\ntake it out to her,&rdquo; Liv said, and stood up. She turned back to\nAlex. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me\ntoo,&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re here, I mean.&rdquo; She blushed.<br /></p><p>Liv\nwalked out, and John squeezed her shoulders.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So\nwhat d&rsquo;you reckon, huh?&rdquo; he said excitedly. He looked out the\nwindow at Connie and the kids.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\noutdone yourself, mate,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head. &ldquo;I thought\nshe couldn&rsquo;t have any more children after Lily.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me\ntoo,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the doctor said. She had to go on\nhormone treatments to conceive,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;They did a number\non her, messed with her moods and her health, but we had Lily.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then\nhow did <i>that</i>\nhappen?&rdquo; Liv said, holding her hands over her belly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas Liv,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She said that Connie&rsquo;s particular issues\nhad a more holistic solution,&rdquo; he said, holding his hands up in air\nquotes. &ldquo;I thought it was a bit mad &ndash; after everything she went\nthrough, how could her hormone imbalance be fixed with diet and\nvitamins and things? But it bloody worked.&rdquo; He slapped the counter.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is\nthat why she&rsquo;s here? To make sure it took?&rdquo; she said, looking at\nJohn. He hugged her tight.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She\nwas here earlier for that,&rdquo; he said into her hair. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re\nout of the danger zone, damn it. Manny&rsquo;s healthy and nearly busting\nout of Connie&rsquo;s belly.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Manny?\nInteresting name,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Technically,\nit&rsquo;s John Manuel.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So\nhe&rsquo;s gonna be a junior too?&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nhe said. &ldquo;Manuel is her dad&rsquo;s name, and two Johns will get\nconfusing, so &hellip; Manny.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nso happy for you,&rdquo; she said, and hugged him tighter. &ldquo;You two\nhave a sweet set up here. Oh,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s\nbusiness?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Booming!&rdquo;\nhe said. &ldquo;Between Connie&rsquo;s connections and Alphie&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m\nbacklogged for two years. Did you see the barn?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.\nIt&rsquo;s really red,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just\nconnections. You&rsquo;re bloody talented.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>John\nsmiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too small,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to\nbuild another one. And I had to hire four apprentices to help me. I&rsquo;m\ninterviewing for three more.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Excuse\nthe hell out of me,&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow,&rdquo; he said, wriggling.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nsuch a dork,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nreally happy, Al,&rdquo; he said, and sat up on the counter. &ldquo;To be\nhonest, I sometimes pinch myself. It&rsquo;s unreal.&rdquo; She pinched his\nside, and he slapped her hand away. &ldquo;To think I was in that little\nhouse in Bristol, resigned to my fate four years ago. I thought I was\nnever gonna get another chance at happiness. I gave up on it. I was a\ntotal fuckup.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nweren&rsquo;t. Never,&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;And it was comin&rsquo;, mate. You are\none of the kindest, most brilliant, smartest, funniest people I know.\nIt was inevitable.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nhush, you. You haven&rsquo;t done so bad yourself.&rdquo; He tugged gently on\nher earlobe.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Seriously.\nYou and Connie deserve each other &ndash; it sounds ominous, but it&rsquo;s\ntrue. You&rsquo;re both amazing.&rdquo; John smiled. &ldquo;Speaking of being\nresigned to your fate, how&rsquo;s Mara?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He\nsighed. &ldquo;In L.A. with her new boyfriend last I heard, and that was\nover a year ago.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Eh,&rdquo;\nAlex said, looking out the window at the children running after each\nother in the grass. The little girl with the red hair hugged Monty,\nand he ran away, screaming.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And\nAddie? How&rsquo;s she adjusting?&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s\na delight, and her and Lily are like blood sisters at this point,&rdquo;\nhe said. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t ask about Mara anymore. Connie and I don&rsquo;t\npush it because when we mention her, she gets the most heartbreaking,\nconfused look on her face.&rdquo; His face crumpled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And\nhow are you?&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s, like, a clone of her. Is it\nhard?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nthought it might be,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But, I don&rsquo;t know, she&rsquo;s\nnot Mara, if that makes any sense. She&rsquo;s sweet, and unselfish, and\nkind. It was a bit weird at first,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know\nwhether it&rsquo;s all her, or maybe Connie&rsquo;s influence, but I don&rsquo;t\ncare either way. She&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nhave to say, you surprised me when you told me about the adoption. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;mad,&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;But after a bit of thought, it\nmakes sense. Who better than you, right?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He\njumped off the counter and sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a secret,&rdquo;\nhe said. &ldquo;It was Connie who talked me into it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;\nAlex said, surprised.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nhe said. &ldquo;At first, I wanted to move on. Start fresh. And when Mara\ncontacted us with the idea, I thought it was another attempt to wrap\nme up in her life again. I didn&rsquo;t want any part of it. But Connie\ntook over, and asked her all the difficult questions. I thought Mara\nwould disappear since I wasn&rsquo;t the one engaging with her, but she\nwas dead serious. She really wanted to give Addie away.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So\nConnie was never weirded out about the idea of adopting your\nex-wife&rsquo;s love child with someone else?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No.\nShe wanted to adopt right away, but she was more concerned about how\nI felt about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She was patient, and didn&rsquo;t force\nthe idea on me. But we were having so much trouble conceiving at the\ntime and she really wanted to be a mother. She has so much love to\ngive &ndash; we both did, and in the end, there was no reason the\ndaughter should have to pay for the sins of the mother.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Alex\nsqueezed his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go outside and love on Connie,&rdquo;\nshe said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\njoin you,&rdquo; he said. When they walked through the dining room, they\nheard pattering footsteps and a giggle. There were a few sugar\nflowers missing from the cake on the table.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lily.\nShe&rsquo;s like a little mouse, getting into things,&rdquo; he said with a\nsmile. They walked outside and Connie had her legs up on the porch\nswing. Liv was out in the yard, playing with Addie, and John ran out\nand started chasing after them both.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How\nare you doin&rsquo;, love?&rdquo; Alex said, and pulled up a chair beside\nher.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;About\nto burst,&rdquo; she said with a sigh. &ldquo;My ankles are swollen, I have\nto pee every 15 minutes, and he&rsquo;s jumping on my diaphragm like a\ntrampoline.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So,\necstatic?&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Completely,&rdquo;\nshe said, and sighed contentedly. They watched the kids playing for a\nminute or two.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nyour little mouse got into the cake,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>Connie\nlaughed. &ldquo;Watch this,&rdquo; she said, and put a serious face on.\n&ldquo;Lily, get over here this instant!&rdquo; she yelled.<br /></p><p>The\nlittle girl ran around John and up the steps in front of her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nmami?&rdquo; she said, holding her hands behind her. She was the spitting\nimage of her father.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A\nlittle bird told me that <i>someone</i> was eating the sugar flowers off the\ncake, even though you pinky promised that you wouldn&rsquo;t touch it\nbefore dinner,&rdquo; she said. The girl licked pink frosting from the\ncorner of her mouth. &ldquo;Do you have any idea who did it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Lily\nlooked down at her galoshes, then dropped to the floor and pulled\nthem off. &ldquo;Mami, one of my zoom boots is loose,&rdquo; she said, and held\nher small booted foot up for her to see. The screw had broken off one\nof her ankle braces. Alex&rsquo;s eyes widened.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nno,&rdquo; Connie said, and Lily repeated it softly. &ldquo;John!&rdquo; He ran\nup and gave her a kiss. &ldquo;Could you get me the repair kit? In the\ndrawer by the stove.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is\none of Lily&rsquo;s zoom boots out?&rdquo; he said, and picked her up and\nlifted her over his head. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have that! How will she fly?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The\nlittle girl whooped and giggled as he carried her inside.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Zoom\nboots?&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nforgot to mention it &ndash; her braces. When she was born, one of her\nfeet twisted inward. John wanted to blame himself, but I didn&rsquo;t\nallow it. We found the best pediatric orthopedic surgeon we could\nafford, and he did what he does best. As you can see, she can move\naround at almost 100%. By the time she starts primary school, she\nwon&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But\nwhy <i>zoom</i>\nboots?&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We\ndidn&rsquo;t want her to feel to different from other children, so we\ngave the brace a cool name. They help her run like the wind,&rdquo; she\nsaid. Addie ran up, with Ollie right behind her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can\nI say hello, mum?&rdquo; Addie said. Connie nodded, and kissed the top of\nher head as the girl rubbed her belly and whispered. Her auburn hair\nwas red at the root with sweat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Go\ninside and tell da to put a hat on you,&rdquo; she said. Addie poked her\nlittle lips out and made a face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If\nyou don&rsquo;t put on a hat, then you might get a cold, and if you do,\nthen you won&rsquo;t be able to see Manny when he comes,&rdquo; Connie said,\nraising her brows.<br /></p><p>Addie\ngasped and ran inside, screaming for her dad.<br /></p><p>Liv\nwalked up with Monty and sat nearby. &ldquo;Did you finally finish the\nplans for your greenhouse?&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Greenhouse?\nWhere?&rdquo; Alex said. Ollie crawled into her lap and played with her\nhair. He was long due for a nap.<br /></p><p>Connie\ngiggled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna build a greenhouse. It&rsquo;ll connect to the\nhouse by the living room,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So\nit&rsquo;s going to get even bigger?&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nConnie said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in nowhere Scotland, but eventually, we&rsquo;ll\nstill have fresh cut flowers&nbsp;all year,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>Alex\nshook her head. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your clientele taking all this?&rdquo; she\nsaid, waving at her belly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They\ncan take it how they like. My family comes first,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;John?\nI hear silence from inside. I don&rsquo;t like silence!&rdquo; she yelled.\nShe settled into the porch swing. &ldquo;To be fair, for the first time\nsince I broke up with my ex, I had to cancel some gigs. I just can&rsquo;t\ndo anything until this one&rsquo;s out, and settled.&rdquo; She rubbed her\nbelly. &ldquo;But, something wild happened when I let one of my clients\nknow I couldn&rsquo;t do their wedding.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;\nAlex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They\npostponed it,&rdquo; she said with a giggle. &ldquo;They said they&rsquo;d wait\non me, and that there was no hurry. They&rsquo;re already two kids in!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>They\nall laughed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Weddings\nare serious business, I guess,&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Neither\nwould I,&rdquo; Liv said, looking out for Monty. He ran back and forth\nalong the fence, jumping occasionally to get a better view of the\nsea.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your\nday will come, if you just wait awhile,&rdquo; Connie sang softly, and\nlooked at them both affectionately. They had changed so much, but\nthey were still so similar. Liv sighed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngonna go check on John. Knowing him, he&rsquo;s having a tickle fight\nwith the girls instead of watching the fob,&rdquo; she said. Just as she\nstood up, Addie ran out with a blue cap on, with Lily close behind.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nyooom!&rdquo;\nJohn said, barreling past in hot pursuit. &ldquo;All better, sweetie?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;\nLily said, and ran toward Monty, her arms outstretched. Ollie jumped\nout of Alex&rsquo;s lap and ran toward the excitement.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re\ndying to go down to the beach,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;I can take them after\ndinner, if it&rsquo;s okay with you ladies?&rdquo; He nodded at Alex and Liv.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nAlex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Monty&rsquo;d\nlove it,&rdquo; Liv said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me\ntoo,&rdquo; Connie sighed. &ldquo;But I can barely walk.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\ntake you down,&rdquo; he said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How?\nYou gonna carry me over your shoulder?&rdquo; Connie said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse not. I&rsquo;ll throw you in a wheelbarrow.&rdquo; He giggled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wit,&rdquo; Connie said. She made a face at him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nput a nice fluffy blanket down for comfort,&rdquo; he said, wiggling his\nfingers.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nhate you,&rdquo; she said, pouting.<br /></p><p>He\nnuzzled her temple and kissed her. &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said,\nand rested his hand on her belly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nright. I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, and pulled him in for a kiss.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mam,\nlook, the water!&rdquo; Ollie said, running back. &ldquo;Is there sharks?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Liv\nperked up and looked at Alex. &ldquo;Did I ever tell you about the time I\nnearly got eaten by a bull shark in Costa Rica?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nwhat you get for going scuba diving with an open wound,&rdquo; Connie\nsaid, rolling her eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nAlex said. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s you telling stories now?&rdquo; Her eyebrow rose.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\ngot loads, if you want to hear them. It&rsquo;ll help to pass the time in\nthis wilderness,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not all near-death\nexperiences either. There&rsquo;s some juicy bits too.&rdquo; Liv looked at\nConnie. &ldquo;And the wound wasn&rsquo;t open. I cut my ankle on some coral.\nI was wearing a plaster.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bloody\nhell! Can&rsquo;t sharks smell a drop of blood from, like, miles off or\nsomething like that?&rdquo; Alex said, leaning forward.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\na common misconception,&rdquo; John horned in from the steps. &ldquo;They can\ndetect blood in the water at around 500 meters, furthest. Still, you\nobviously had a death wish, Olivia,&rdquo; he said, and kissed the top of\nLily&rsquo;s head, who sat on his lap to listen to the story. Addie sat\nat Connie&rsquo;s feet.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But\nI didn&rsquo;t. I wasn&rsquo;t going to pass up the chance to dive with one\nof the best instructors in the country over a tiny little flesh\nwound,&rdquo; Liv said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Was\nshe, though?&ldquo; Connie said. &ldquo;You nearly made that instructor poo\nherself once he saw that monster circling,&rdquo; Connie said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Pfft,\nit was tiny. Like, only 4 feet long, tops. A baby,&rdquo; she said,\nholding back a laugh.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nlaughing now, but you were on therapy for a year after that,&rdquo;\nConnie said.<br /></p><p>Liv\nshrugged. &ldquo;I was a bit tightly wound back then. It&rsquo;s not news.&rdquo;\nJohn snorted. Liv swatted in his direction, but he ducked away with a\ngiggle. &ldquo;Needless to say, things have changed. And I&rsquo;m willing to\ngive it another go. Maybe Australia this time?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Right.\nHave a nice visit to the home of everything that&rsquo;s trying its best\nto kill you,&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nsurvived an all-girl&rsquo;s public school, and being a lawyer in London\nfor a decade. I know how to deal with bird-eating spiders,\ncrocodiles, and poisonous snakes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Easy peasy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck\nme, who are you?&rdquo; Alex said, shaking her head.<br /></p><p>\"Language!&rdquo;\nJohn and Connie said in unison. Alex flushed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry\nfor not doing this before,&rdquo; she said, smiling at Alex. John stood\nup and helped Connie into the house, with the children in tow.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did\nJohn tell you about the time I beat up a tweaker trying to mug me in\nNew York?&rdquo; Alex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lies!&rdquo;\nLiv said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nshit you not,&rdquo; Alex said, holding both hands up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d had the\nworst day ever, and I swear my adrenaline took over and I dropped him\nlike a sack of shit.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The\nwind picked up, and they shivered. Liv&rsquo;s eyes lingered on Alex&rsquo;s\nface. She was even more beautiful than she remembered. She wondered\nwhat was going on in her head. Maude was responsible and kind, but\nultimately boring. Despite the gloss, Alex was still the woman she\nfell in love with &ndash; impetuous, outspoken, and sweet. She missed\nsweetness. Alex noticed her looking, and didn&rsquo;t shy away from her\ngaze.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We\nshould go inside,&rdquo; Liv said, and rose. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting cold.&rdquo;\nShe held out her hand.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d\nlove to,&rdquo; Alex said, took it, and followed her into the house.<br /></p><p>THE END<br /></p><hr /><p>Note: Thanks to everyone who showed interest, liked, and reblogged - you make my heart sing with a click.
