The sunshine in the gloomy days, the star that shines in the lone sky. The lifesaver when times were dark, the person to pick up her pieces when she broke apart. He glowed like the sun, and she swore he was an actual angel from heaven. She loved him, and gave her heart and soul to him.</p><p><i><b>I got a habit of seeing what isn&rsquo;t there</b></i></p><p>But Peter Parker is not who she thinks he is. Sure, he is the friendly crime-fighting Spider-Man, but there is something deeper than that. Though she gives him everything she has, he gave nothing. Their relationship is a fa\u00e7ade, a fake attachment built on lies.</p><p>Of course, to her oblivious self, she didn&rsquo;t notice this. Blinded by love and attention, unable to see what really lies beneath those honeyed eyes. </p><p>There, under the surface of the crinkled smiles and gazing eyes, are lies. Deceiving lies that she doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize because she&rsquo;s fallen so deep and can&rsquo;t get back up.

                "content": "<p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\">fa&ccedil;ade</p><p><i>summary: Peter Parker is not what you think he is.</i></p><p>listen to &ldquo;in my head&rdquo; by ariana grande</p><p><i><b>a/n : have fun with this one :)) i&rsquo;m actually gonna try to use proper capitalization here lol. pete is very ooc so please do not slap me &mdash; note that pete is aged up!  happy reading :D. yes i will never stop writing angst. (this is only verse 1, sorry ajsjdjjd)</b></i></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><i><b><span style=\"color: #000000\">painted a picture, I thought I knew you well</span></b></i></p><p>Peter Parker in her eyes was an angel. The sunshine in the gloomy days, the star that shines in the lone sky. The lifesaver when times were dark, the person to pick up her pieces when she broke apart. He glowed like the sun, and she swore he was an actual angel from heaven. She loved him, and gave her heart and soul to him.</p><p><i><b>I got a habit of seeing what isn&rsquo;t there</b></i></p><p>But Peter Parker is not who she thinks he is. Sure, he is the friendly crime-fighting Spider-Man, but there is something deeper than that. Though she gives him everything she has, he gave nothing. Their relationship is a fa&ccedil;ade, a fake attachment built on lies.</p><p>Of course, to her oblivious self, she didn&rsquo;t notice this. Blinded by love and attention, unable to see what really lies beneath those honeyed eyes. </p><p>There, under the surface of the crinkled smiles and gazing eyes, are lies. Deceiving lies that she doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize because she&rsquo;s fallen so deep and can&rsquo;t get back up. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt any of them, so why bother telling her his secrets?</p><p><i><b>caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets</b></i></p><p>Sometimes she does get suspicious of his actions; the late-night visits out of their house, the weight of the bed lifting when she&rsquo;s asleep. Instead of confronting him, she shrugs it off. Didn&rsquo;t think too much of it. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, her love is unrequited. He&rsquo;s not cheating, he cares too much for her to do that. Peter is simply, <i><span style=\"color: #000000\">not</span></i> in love.</p><p><i><b>when you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me</b></i></p><p>She wishes she hadn&rsquo;t overheard the conversation between Peter and Ned. If she didn&rsquo;t, she could carry on with holding the relationship on a tightrope. Sadly, curiosity killed the cat. She wished satisfaction brought her back.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Ned. She&rsquo;s just.. not my type. She&rsquo;s pretty and kind and all, but, I don&rsquo;t like her that way. I don&rsquo;t love her. I wish I could tell her that.&rdquo;</i> </p><p><i>She peered from the corner, eavesdropping on their conversation. She was aware it was a bad idea, but the quote &ldquo;curiousity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back,&rdquo; was stamped in her head.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You should tell her Pete. Be honest. Don&rsquo;t go breaking her heart like that.&rdquo; The last words Ned said before he walked away, waving goodbye and going back to his own home. </i></p><p><i>She fought back tears, choking on her breath as she composed herself. So it was all a lie. </i></p><p>Ever since that bright afternoon, she&rsquo;d have to deal with the fact that every kiss, every hug, every embrace was forced and fake.</p><p><b><i>my imagination&rsquo;s too creative &mdash; they see demon, I see angel &mdash; without a halo, wingless angel</i></b></p><p>While she was faking oblivion to his antics, Peter&rsquo;s friends obviously knew the truth. Every time the couple hung out with Ned and MJ, they could see the fa&ccedil;ade of Peter. They knew, he knew, she knew. They see through their fake relationship built with unrequited love.</p><p><b><i>falling, falling, but I&rsquo;d never thought you&rsquo;d leave me</i></b></p><p>She&rsquo;s too lost in him to remember that he&rsquo;s fake. It eventually slipped her mind, but every time he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;<i>I love you</i>&rdquo; back she&rsquo;s reminded of it.</p><p><b><i>falling, falling, needed something to believe in</i></b></p><p>She wished it was real, so she believed it. It was better than admitting the truth to herself. She wanted this relationship, it&rsquo;s just that Peter doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Tonight she&rsquo;s cooking dinner, spaghetti with a side salad. The plates collide with the table, setting up the food for dinner. </p><p>She takes off her apron, sits down at the table and picks at her food. The light above the dinner table feels blinding, and waiting for Peter to come home feels like forever.</p><p>Eventually the front door opens and closes. Keys are thrown to the counter, his coat shuffles off to the side. Peter slips off his shoes and walks to the dinner table.</p><p>He goes for a kiss on the forehead as a greeting, but she flinches. </p><p>Hesitantly, he sits down, glancing at the plate filled with food. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, honey, how are you?&rdquo; He starts off their nightly conversation, lightly anxious by her previous actions.</p><p>She says with a monotone voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Picking at her food, she spins a fork of noodles and plops it in her mouth. He does the same.</p><p>She gulps, blurting, &ldquo;Peter, can we talk?&rdquo;</p><p>He nods, while chewing some of the spaghetti she made. Peter assumes it&rsquo;s something minor, but not what she was about to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you ever love me? At all? In the three years we&rsquo;ve been together?&rdquo;</p><p>He basks in silence.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s answer makes the moon dim a little more. The stars shine a little less, the plants and flowers outside wither. The waves by the beach seem to crash harder. The once blinding light above the dinner table feels like it&rsquo;s not even on.</p><p>Her fork drops on the plate with a clatter. She cries into the table softly, her tears seeping out one by one until it&rsquo;s too much to handle. Her efforts to muffle her whimpers and cries fails.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew it. I knew it, I knew it-&rdquo;</p><p>She sinks into the chair, repeating the phrase like a mantra. He&rsquo;s overwhelmed with gallons of guilt, looking at her image with pity.</p><p>&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve just said something. Anything. Something that screamed &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want this relationship&rsquo; instead of dealing with me.&rdquo; She chokes out, sitting up, her head feeling heavy. Her head is carried by her hands. </p><p>He has tears in his eyes, but he&rsquo;s not the one hurting here. It&rsquo;s just out of pity. Peter glances down at the plate in shame, he can&rsquo;t bring himself to look at hee heartbroken face.</p><p><b><i>I thought you were the one</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;You were everything I wanted, Peter. I just wished you wanted me like that too.&rdquo; She looks up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d grow, start a family, have kids, all that clich&egrave; shit. I guess it&rsquo;s just my imagination.&rdquo;</p><p>He avoids her gaze, avoiding tears, biting his lip. </p><p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b><i>but it was all in my head.</i></b></span></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He says, looking straight at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;</p><p>She left that night.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>Here&rsquo;s the thing; You&rsquo;re in love with a version of a person that you&rsquo;ve created in your head.

It was the only color orange, no plants or trees or earth of any kind anywhere.</p><p>After, what seemed like forever, he saw a figure in the pigmented distance. He stopped walking suddenly, trying to make out who the figure was. The snap would have dusted literally half of the universe so the figure could be anyone.

He held tight to the nozzle of the firearm, his heart suddenly starting to pound once again.</p><p>Once he was close enough to get a good look at the person, he dropped his gun to his waist. It was the spider-kid from Germany. The one that Tony brought along with him. He remembered the kid catching his fist with almost zero effort.

Guilt and shame ping-ponged in his brain, kicking him for staying on that spaceship in the first place.

He stopped walking suddenly, trying to make out who the figure was. The snap would have dusted literally half of the universe so the figure could be anyone.

I just want you to relax.\u201d His voice eased your muscles alone. </p><p>You knew it wasn\u2019t going to end any other way. Peter knew all the tricks to get you in the mood and it was working. You hated it but at the same time you didn\u2019t stop him.
