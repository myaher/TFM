Dammit. Was he too loud? He got so caught up in his project that he forgot he wasn&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>With big eyes, T2 noticed that everyone was looking at him, concerned by the pained yelp from seconds ago. T1 paused his work, furrowing his eyebrows, some car grease stain on his cheek and already crazy hair from rubbing the strands in frustration. Steves had been sitting the old couch in the corner, S1 keeping his book open but not following the text focused on T2, while his Steve still had a pencil pressed to his sketchbook but didn&rsquo;t continue, just like S1 sending him a calculating look.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;What- Nothing is wrong,&rdquo; T2 replied immediately, trying to shrug the problem off.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you holding your hand pressed to your right cheek?&rdquo; T1 asked, squinting more at him.</p><p>Nice. T2 immediately lowered his hand, realizing that he was giving himself away. Smooth.</p><p>&ldquo;Helps me think,&rdquo; more lies. &ldquo;It is a quirk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it is not,&rdquo; Steve said loudly from the couch. &ldquo;You both stick out tongues while working, that is your quirk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People change, okay?&rdquo; T2 exclaimed impatiently. Why they were still on this topic? He was perfectly fine. Fine fine fine.</p><p>&ldquo;Babe, do your teeth hurt?&rdquo; S2 asked, not breaking eye contact with his boyfriend.</p><p>Another twitch. That was pretty confirmative. Damn his Steve for reading him so fast.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so that is why you were chewing only with your left side of the jaw today,&rdquo; Tony said, pointing to the left side of his own face.</p><p>&ldquo;And you asked me for an ice pack, saying that your head hurt,&rdquo; Steve continued.</p><p>T2&rsquo;s mouth opened in surprise. Seemed that his Steve wasn&rsquo;t the only one who could read his behavior correctly. Still, he needed to deny everything. &ldquo;Teeth are technically head area, so I wasn&rsquo;t really lying-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have to go to the dentist,&rdquo; S2 ended the discussion.</p><p>Another twitch. This time the twitch was followed by a sudden turn and running out of the workshop in panic. Steves were faster, but Tony was closer and he was the one who leaped first to the escaping brunet, holding him back.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah ah ah!&rdquo; Tony tugged the other him closer, ignoring the whining and struggling. &ldquo;Why are you running?&rdquo; Tony asked, trying to sound innocent and failing, an evilly gleeful smile giving him away. Jerk.</p><p>&ldquo;You know why,&rdquo; T2 grunted, trying to push himself away from the other him. Despite everything, Tony had some good upper body strength, and T2 was struggling.</p><p>&ldquo;I really have no idea-&rdquo;</p><p>A loud sigh, when Steves walked the distance and stood near their boyfriends. Enough of this.</p><p>&ldquo;I am guessing your Tony is afraid of the dentist too?&rdquo; Steve asked the other him, sounding somehow tired.</p><p>&ldquo;Terrified,&rdquo; S2 confirmed, and both Tonys voiced out their protests at being humiliated like that. Tony let his guard down and got elbowed by T2, who leaped to his Steve for protection. &ldquo;Hey, you are fine, babe,&rdquo; S2 said, wrapping arms around his boyfriend when T2 crashed into his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna go,&rdquo; T2 said, doing his best wounded doe impression and trembling. His Steve was kind. He won&rsquo;t let them hurt him.</p><p>&ldquo;Too bad, you are going,&rdquo; S2 said, sounding sorry but firm. It was the only way.</p><p>Immediately, T2 pushed himself away and took a step in Steve&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Steve-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Steve said, sounding even firmer than S2. T2 stopped in his tracks. All three of them betrayed him.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big deal, anyway?&rdquo; Tony made a comment, shrugging his arms. &ldquo;I will just call my dentist and we will zip over to New York for a quick check-up-&rdquo;</p><p>T2 wrapped arms around himself, feeling betrayed and abandoned. He really, really didn&rsquo;t want to go.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo; S2 wrapped an arm around his boyfriend and pulled him, placing a reassuring kiss on the top of his head. Tony was blowing this situation way out of proportions. &ldquo;Maybe it is just your wisdom teeth coming out, but we still have to check it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T2 doesn&rsquo;t have wisdom teeth?&rdquo; Steve asked, and Tony stopped with a phone in his hand, just about to make an appointment.</p><p>&ldquo;No, they never came out,&rdquo; S2 answered, looking puzzled at the other couple.</p><p>Steve and Tony exchanged worried looks.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we have a problem,&rdquo; Tony said, putting his phone away.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony already had his wisdom teeth removed. All four of them,&rdquo; Steve said, cringing at the memory of that day. It wasn&rsquo;t a fun experience for neither Tony or Steve. &ldquo;As for someone who has such a big mouth, his jaw couldn&rsquo;t fit four extra teeth,&rdquo; he tried to joke to loosen the atmosphere, but only Tony laughed, while S2 cracked a smile and T2 didn&rsquo;t react at all, busy with hiding into his boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess we have to call some clinic here and make an emergency appointment,&rdquo; Tony decided, asking Friday to find a one and book a visit today.</p><p>T2 lifted his head up, hearing the news. He was supposed to go to an unknown dentist who didn&rsquo;t have any of his dental records and just trust them like that?</p><p>Heck no.</p><p>&ldquo;Ow, Tony!&rdquo; S2 called in protest when without any warning T2 tried to claw his way out of his arms and run to freedom. Maybe to Canada.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;You will be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 sniffled, hearing the words being repeated time after time. He was in the backseat with T1 who kept holding his hand and caressing his knuckles with a thumb in hopes of calming him down. Steves were in the front, S1 driving, orientating himself better around California. If T2 had to go to the dentist, he made sure everyone would accompany him. Except for T2&rsquo;s comforting and his quiet sniffling, the ride was pretty quiet, until they reached their destination.</p><p>&ldquo;We are here,&rdquo; Steve said, parking the car in front of the clinic. It was one of the newest kind, promising quick service, even for most complicated procedures and zero pain.</p><p>T2 glanced up, seeing the white building and neon with the clinic&rsquo;s name. He lowered his head down again and didn&rsquo;t move while Steves got out of the car and T1 unbuckled their seat belts. The door opened from his side, and T2 remained still.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; S2 said, taking T2&rsquo;s hand and gently pulling him out. Before he could do that, Tony scooted closer and placed a kiss on T2&rsquo;s temple.</p><p>&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; T1 said with a smile and T2 widened his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not going with us?&rdquo; Steve asked, frowning at his boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it would be suspicious if we walk in there, looking like clones? It is enough that you two look the same,&rdquo; Tony made an excuse, pointing from Steve to Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Steve quickly protested, safely hidden under sunglasses and a baseball cap on his head, while S2 pulled a hoodie over his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s not a very good disguise,&rdquo; Tony pointed out, crossing his legs with a grin. &ldquo;I am gonna wait for you all here,&rdquo; he decided, waving goodbye to them.</p><p>S2 pursed his lips but didn&rsquo;t say anything, managing to take T2 out of the car, who was still looking with wide, betrayed eyes at his counterpart. When they stepped away, Steve leaned in, looking irritated.</p><p>&ldquo;We will discuss this later, Tony,&rdquo; he hissed, closing the door.</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t seem affected. He watched the three of them walking into the clinic and when the coast was clear, he curled and wrapped arms around himself, letting out a long time held in shudder.</p><p>There was no way he was going in there. Godspeed, T2.</p><p>***</p><p>The waiting room was bright and inviting, with many chairs, magazines and even some corner for kids with paper and crayons. T2 was handed a form he had filled in in silence and then a receptionist collected it from him, asking the three of them to wait. They were sitting under a wall, away from everyone else waiting, Tony between Steves. He was looking cautiously from one patient to the other, seeing calm faces and nothing like his worried one. The time was flying and soon they reached an hour mark of waiting, and while T2 barely said anything during that time, Steves kept talking as if trying to fill in for him.</p><p>&ldquo;This clinic has great reviews-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will go really fast, Tony, promise-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are in good hands-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to go to the bathroom,&rdquo; T2 said, spotting the door around the corner and standing up.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Just come back soon, we don&rsquo;t know when it will be your turn.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 nodded and started walking. After a few steps and a quick exchange behind his back, he heard someone standing up and walking behind him. T2 turned around and saw S1.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to go to the bathroom too?&rdquo; T2 asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; S1 replied, smiling broadly. &ldquo;Just making sure you won&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am already here, why would I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony once tried to squeeze out through the bathroom window. I am not taking any chances for that to happen with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Plan failed. Still, he had to roll with it.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not planning to - stop it!&rdquo; T2 ordered, resuming walking and seeing S1 closely following. &ldquo;I said stop it! Steve, tell him to not follow me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead and follow him,&rdquo; S2 said calmly, reaching for one of the colorful magazines.</p><p>&ldquo;No! I - Steve!&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t embarrassing at all when T2 started running, S1 right after him, until T2 true to his words zoomed into the bathroom and closed the door with a loud bang.</p><p>***</p><p>Just a little bit more. Come on. Almost -</p><p>Who was he kidding.</p><p>T2 wriggled away from the window with an impatient huff. There was no way he could squeeze through it. He could put out his arm or leg, but not the rest of his body. Windows were probably designed to not let any kids escape. Little snots. If the window was any bigger, he could escape easily, but because the clinic was childproofed, he was stuck. It didn&rsquo;t help that through the window he could see their car, knowing that T1 was inside, safe and without any worries. Bastard would pay for leaving him with those harpies.</p><p>Giving up, T2 washed his hands and made a face at himself in the mirror. He stretched his lips and tried to take a look inside his mouth wondering what was happening, but besides an exploding pain in his lower jaw, he couldn&rsquo;t say. His teeth looked fine, clean and sparkling. If something was happening it had to be in the roots or in the gums. Great.</p><p>T2 peaked his head out of the bathroom and narrowed his eyes at S1 standing leaned over a wall, waiting for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you still here?&rdquo; T2 asked, sounding offended.</p><p>Non taken and S1 only smiled. &ldquo;Come on. Your turn isn&rsquo;t yet, but S2 is working on that.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony frowned at the words and as they began to walk back to their seats. He saw his Steve leaning over the counter and conversing with a receptionist, a different one than the one that handed him the form. Much younger and flintier. T2 didn&rsquo;t like S2&rsquo;s smile even a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is he flirting?&rdquo; Tony asked, stopping halfway and staring at his fiance.</p><p>&ldquo;He is?&rdquo; Steve asked back, also looking at S2. Huh. The other him seemed relaxed and was smiling charmingly, giving all his attention to the receptionist who was smiling and laughing a bit too much as for a professional conversation. So, that&rsquo;s how he looked while flirting\u2026 &ldquo;I am sure he is not, he is just trying to bump you in the line,&rdquo; he said, remembering S2&rsquo;s mouthed out words while he was standing and looking after T2.</p><p>&ldquo;He is flirting,&rdquo; T2 said, sounding indignant. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he grabbed S1&rsquo;s hand and changed the direction, going to the reception desk, planning to give his boyfriend a piece of his mind. He was stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; S1 shook his head, and took T2 by the arms instead, sitting him down on a nearby chair. &ldquo;You are staying here and I will get S2.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?!&rdquo; T2 called after Steve, fingers curling into fists out of frustration.</p><p>&ldquo;Too close to the door, not risking it!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony just sunk into the chair, his irritation level rising. The pulsating pain in his lower jaw was not helping either. He didn&rsquo;t hear much of the conversation when S1 walked closer and S2 straightened up and they exchanged some words, but he saw clearly as the receptionist looked from one sexy blond to the other sexy blond and brightened even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you guys twins?&rdquo; she asked, purring out the words, and batting her long eyelashes.</p><p>That did it.</p><p>T2 leaped half of the room and just as S1 blushed, and S2 opened his mouth to confirm or deny or whatever he planned, T2 stood between both of them and wrapped each arm around Steves&rsquo; necks, pulling them closer to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;No, they are not,&rdquo; T2 said in a sunny voice, smiling beautifully, despite the aching pain. &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t they both gorgeous? I am up for some nice threesome action today,&rdquo; he said, ignoring that S1 stiffened in panic, while S2 was clearly uncomfortable too, just not so visibly as the other him.</p><p>The receptionist instead of being taken aback by such blatant display, brightened ever more, eyeing Tony up and down. She crossed palms under her chin and leaned in closer. &ldquo;Maybe even some foursome,&rdquo; she purred back.</p><p>For a second, T2&rsquo;s face gave away how the unexpected offer surprised him, but soon it morphed into his trained charming smile and faked laughter, which to an unskilled eye looked very real and honest. &ldquo;Yeah, maybe,&rdquo; he decided on behalf of three of them and added even a small wink. He turned around with flustered Steves, walking back to their seats. &ldquo;I forgot this was California\u2026&rdquo; he grunted quietly, so only Steves could hear him. That got uncomfortable very quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell were you doing?&rdquo; S2 demanded answers in a quiet voice when all of them sat down.</p><p>&ldquo;And what were you doing?&rdquo; T2 hissed back, eyes narrowing in anger. &ldquo;I just walked away for few minutes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, I was just trying to quicken your appointment!&rdquo; S2 hissed back, both men turned to each other, faces just inches apart.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sure, you seemed like having a ton of fun while doing that -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Guys, calm down,&rdquo; Steve said, putting his hand on T2&rsquo;s shoulder and pushing him to the back. They were waiting already for nearly two hours, despite having an appointment, it was getting on everyone&rsquo;s nerves. &ldquo;Taking your frustration on each other won&rsquo;t resolve anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Both T2 and S2 eyed each other for a while longer, before their gazes softened. It was true, and the pain was dulling T2&rsquo;s mind and he was becoming increasingly irritated, while S2 felt hopeless, not able to ease his lover&rsquo;s pain. \u00a0It was a tough situation for all of them.</p><p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; T2 admitted. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said to S2, knowing that in no world Steve would flirt with someone else and mean it. Well, maybe except T1 and S1.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry too,&rdquo; S2 said, corners of his lips turning down as he gently cupped Tony&rsquo;s face, the side where the pain was located. He was really sorry he couldn&rsquo;t relieve the pain and he hated to see his boyfriend suffering and scared. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just hope it won&rsquo;t take much longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it won&rsquo;t, you are a charmer,&rdquo; T2 smiled, quickly nuzzling into S2&rsquo;s palm and kissing it. &ldquo;Unlike you, from what I heard,&rdquo; he turned to face Steve and booped him on the nose.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T1 told me. He said you were fumbling a lot before you gathered the courage to ask him out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; S2 grinned, that annoying, smug grin, Steve disliked so much as he leaned over his Tony&rsquo;s back and put his chin on his shoulder. &ldquo;Tell me more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, I bet you had the same problems as I did,&rdquo; Steve grunted, not liking the way both men were looking at him. Fine, he wasn&rsquo;t the master of flirting. But in the end, he was with Tony so he couldn&rsquo;t be that hopeless, right?</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; S2 shrugged, &ldquo;but might be also because my Tony is easy.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 scoffed and turned his head to look at his lover, mouth grimaced into a scowl and not because of pain. &ldquo;Did you just call me fucking easy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You kinda are,&rdquo; S2 said, winking to Steve, &ldquo;I just needed to touch you in the right place to make you all mine.&rdquo;</p><p>There it was. Five fingers brushing his side. T2 jerked and squealed in surprise and bumped into S1 to get away.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that kind of easy,&rdquo; S1 quickly caught on, repeating the slow movement, while S2 moved in closer, not leaving T2 enough space to move. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good kind of easy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No - you can&rsquo;t - nooo,&rdquo; T2 squirmed, trying to keep his voice down to not attract any attention to them, but four hands were already all over his waist and sneaking underneath his jacket to remain unnoticed. &ldquo;D - don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just be quiet and no one will see,&rdquo; S2 advised, rubbing small circles with his thumbs into T2&rsquo;s sides.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it can&rsquo;t be that bad, can it?&rdquo; S1 teased in a sweet voice, using his whole palms to glide over T2&rsquo;s belly, slowly, using just enough pressure.</p><p>T2 huffed his cheeks out, trying to stop the upcoming wave of laughter. He tried to catch Steves hands with his, but he was severely outnumbered. In the privacy of their home he would be extremely delighted, but being tickled in public was something that made him feel very vulnerable. His breath was becoming shorter, and any second he felt that he would burst into laughter and probably die of embarrassment -</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhodes! James Rhodes!&rdquo; came a voice calling the next patient.</p><p>Hearing the pilot&rsquo;s name, Steves stopped the teasing touches and T2 jumped out of his seat, escaping from intrusive hands, taking in some deep, calming breaths.</p><p>&ldquo;Rhodey is here?&rdquo; Steve asked, looking around the waiting room, but not seeing any familiar faces.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; S2 drew his eyebrows together. Strange. If Rhodey was back in the country, wouldn&rsquo;t he inform Tony? &ldquo;Hey, where are you going?&rdquo; he called, seeing that Tony moved forward and away from them.</p><p>&ldquo;I was called,&rdquo; T2 explained, turning around to face his boyfriends, smiling in humor at the confused faces, &ldquo;well, I couldn&rsquo;t give them my real name, right?&rdquo; he explained with a laugh, walking through the door he was pointed to and closing them behind himself. Safe. Safe from teasing and fingers wiggling against his skin. There was still some tingling around his waist, and he felt his face cooling down. That was an embarrassing experience.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhodes, please sit down.&rdquo;</p><p>T2&rsquo;s blood turned cold. He was so focused on getting away, that he didn&rsquo;t notice that he willingly walked into a much worse situation. Much, much worse.</p><p>When the door leading to the dentist&rsquo;s office flung open and T2 screamed &rsquo;<i>GET IN HERE!</i>&rsquo; in sheer panic, Steves didn&rsquo;t question it, just sprinted inside the room.</p><p>***</p><p>Tony glanced at the hour displayed on his phone. Why it was taking so long? He saw people walking out of the clinic, but no luck with his partners. He was getting bored and if he knew that it would take so long he would take his tablet - and then a nasty thought appeared in his mind, causing him to become nervous.</p><p>What was happening in there that T2&rsquo;s appointment was taking so long? Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t just an ordinary toothache, able to fix during one visit. Maybe the problem ran deeper, happening in the roots, maybe even deeper in the bones of the jaw -</p><p>Bones. Bones cracking with a sickening, almost unreal sound but so vivid in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait-&rdquo; Tony gasped to himself, his mind bringing memories from the past he thought he had pushed deep into his subconsciousness. &ldquo;No-&rdquo;</p><p>Remove the bones. Remove the flesh. A sound of dull tools. Deeper and deeper, drilling into him.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Tony closed his eyes, pain flooding his brain and making his muscles ache. He didn&rsquo;t realize but he pressed a hand to his chest, just in the middle. It felt like bones, but it was all fake. Just the pain was real.</p><p>Cold weight smothering him. Blood spilling. Screaming. Someone was screaming. Soon he realized that it was his own screaming. Way in the past, in the darkness, struggling to breathe on a makeshift operating table in a cave.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; Tony yelled, bending in half and covering his ears, trying to mute out the sound of metal, the screaming, the whirring of electric machines.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;I think it went well,&rdquo; S2 praised.</p><p>&ldquo;You did good,&rdquo; S1 praised more, leaning in to place a kiss on top of T2&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhhhhmm,&rdquo; T2 whined quietly, the anesthesia in his jaw numbing his gums and tongue and making his speech a bit drawled out. It would soon pass, but for the time being, he preferred not to talk and just held Steves hands as the three of them left the dentist&rsquo;s office. He felt really tired after all this stress, but at least he would be able to sleep tonight, without being woken up by the pain every hour or so. They could go back home.</p><p>The three of them walked down the corridor when something caught S1&rsquo;s attention. In the kids&rsquo; corner, sat at a small plastic, round table on bright, yellow puff was Tony, surrounded by kids and their mothers. He was holding a red crayon in his hand and drawing something on paper, kids making their way to look at it, while Tony was chatting with the mothers and with the kids, all at the same time. It was somehow heartwarming to see.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Steve called, and Tony turned around, smiling at the three of them. He excused himself and said goodbye to the kids, taking the piece of paper from the table and skipping to his lovers.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Why it was taking so long? You okay?&rdquo; he asked, looking from one person to the other, but finally stopping on T2&rsquo;s shocked face.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, yeah, but what - what are you doing here?&rdquo; S1 asked, sounding pleasantly surprised. The smile was dulled, when he noticed that Tony looked a bit pale and his lower lip was trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;I was getting worried. You were gone for a long time,&rdquo; T1 said, looking at S2 for a change. &ldquo;Is Tony okay?&rdquo; he asked, alarmed by his counterpart&rsquo;s stillness and quietness.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; S2 confirmed, sounding a bit in shock himself with seeing T1, &ldquo;just had some bad cavity between his molars, but it is fine now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ouch,&rdquo; T1 grimaced involuntarily. That had to involve a lot of work. &ldquo;Oh, I have something for you,&rdquo; he said, lifting the piece of paper and focusing back on T2. &ldquo;One of the kids advised I make it for you,&rdquo; he smiled, somehow clumsily, letting them see what was on the paper. In red and yellow crayon was something they could only describe as a stick figure in Iron Man colors. It was signed with a &lsquo;get well soon!&rsquo; in Tony&rsquo;s chaotic print. &ldquo;I know it is not that great, and Steves could draw something more beautiful for you -&rdquo;</p><p>T2 kept looking at the picture, feeling some warm emotions brewing in him. He loosened the hold with Steves&rsquo; hands and instead hugged Tony, embracing him with all the strength he had left.</p><p>&ldquo;Oof,&rdquo; T1 grunted at the bear hug but hugged back. &ldquo;Glad you like it,&rdquo; he laughed in humor. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p><p>Steves exchanged warm looks, when both Tonys turned around and walked out of the clinic, the two of them following. There would come a time, Steve would ask Tony about this day and what exactly made him leave the car, but for the time being, he decided to stay quiet.</p><p>***</p><p>The ride back home was much more cheerful and in a merrier atmosphere. The anesthesia was slowly wearing off, and except some numb feeling and pain when he clinked his teeth too strong together, T2 was feeling fine and was ready to take a part in the ongoing discussion. And boy, he wanted to take part in it.</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Tony called loudly in disbelief. &ldquo;You went easy on him!&rdquo; he accused after hearing how S2 and T2 had been playing with Steve a few nights ago.</p><p>&ldquo;We still had to work harder on him. He is tougher than you are,&rdquo; S2 replied in a teasing voice, trading places with S1 and riding them back home. S1 grinned proudly after hearing the comment. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly a praise, but he would take it.</p><p>&ldquo;No blindfold, no ink brush, no two toothbrushes!&rdquo; Tony listed all things that were used on him, but not on his fiance, sounding angry. &ldquo;Not fair!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you still enjoyed it, right?&rdquo; S2 asked, looking at Tony&rsquo;s reflection in the rear-view mirror, seeing his pouting face. &ldquo;Besides, we had to blindfold you, otherwise you would come in seconds and that would end our evening quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony groaned in embarrassment, while T2 chuckled quietly. Not their fault that being tied down and teased and having their belly buttons played with was always a big turn on for them both.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, I thought I took two toothbrushes with me,&rdquo; T2 said, frowning at the memory. Using one toothbrush on Steve was already rewarding, but imagine the possibilities if he had two.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, me too,&rdquo; S2 agreed, sure that his lover took two. Maybe his memory was a bit wonky on that.</p><p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; Steve laughed, pointing attention to himself and smirking proudly, &ldquo;just when you were handcuffing me to the bed, I kicked the second toothbrush down. It is probably still under our bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, come on!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cheater!&rdquo;</p><p>At Tonys loud whining, both Steves laughed. Just from two different reasons.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess that means we now have to repeat everything. All three of us. Right, guys?&rdquo; S2 asked, hearing Tonys agreeing with him from the backseat.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; S1 grinned, sporting a different point of view. &ldquo;And when it will be finally your turn, huh?&rdquo; he asked the other him, seeing a nervous muscle jump in S2&rsquo;s jaw. Steve grinned wider and turned to Tonys. &ldquo;What do you say that instead of getting me, I will help you get S2?&rdquo;</p><p>There was no answer, but the car suddenly became really, really quiet and there were some tension and planning in the air. Involuntarily, S2 started to slow down, prolonging their way back home, feeling three intense stares on himself.</p><p>***</p><p>S2 could feel it. They were following him, not letting eyes off of him. And he barely walked inside the house and just took his shoes off. Maybe if he kept ignoring them, they would go away.</p><p>&ldquo;You had to put it in their heads?!&rdquo; S2 groaned, noticing Steve making his way past him.</p><p>Steve blinked and smiled innocently. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You chicken?&rdquo; he asked, showing all teeth in a wide grin.</p><p>&ldquo;No, just -&rdquo; S2 started, sitting on the couch. As soon as he did that, Tonys jumped to him, sitting on opposite sides and having him between. Steve couldn&rsquo;t help but to laugh at the nervous jump the other him did, his blue eyes widening almost comically as he looked from one Tony to the other.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you ready?&rdquo; T1 asked enthusiastically, firm on going with the plan.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, that will really make me feel better,&rdquo; T2 decided to go with the innocent card, trying to use his bad day as an excuse.</p><p>Slowly, S2 was giving up. He knew that both Starks could be stubborn and maybe the sooner this experience would be behind him, the better. For sure, he wouldn&rsquo;t stand the tension with both Tonys following him everywhere and planning a surprise attack.</p><p>&ldquo;I will regret this, right?&rdquo; S2 asked, meeting S1&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;We will see,&rdquo; S1 replied with a laugh. Totally unhelpful.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay then,&rdquo; S2 agreed, leaning into the couch and putting arms on the backrest, leaving his torso exposed. &ldquo;Do your worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act as if it is a punishment,&rdquo; T2 scolded his boyfriend, not appreciating the dramatic attitude. He was supposed to be the dramatic half in this relationship.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, think of it as a bonding experience,&rdquo; T1 added, being the first one who reached to S2&rsquo;s side and softly wiggled his fingertips over the flank.</p><p>The reaction wasn&rsquo;t instant, and S2 remained still, an only small twitch of his lips giving him away. He won&rsquo;t go down easily.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you want to play it tough?&rdquo; T1 asked, keeping the touch slow and just brushing his fingertips. Up and down.</p><p>&ldquo;He always wants to play it tough,&rdquo; T2 confirmed, repeating the same kind of touch, just on the side closer to him. &ldquo;He is just mean like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like a challenge. We will have fun with you,&rdquo; T1 said in a pleasant voice, scooting in closer and placing a scratchy kiss on S2&rsquo;s neck. That got them a better reaction and some muffled sound as the blond scrunched his shoulders up.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good idea,&rdquo; T2 brightened and moved closer too, placing his kiss on S2&rsquo;s ear. More curling and another held back sound, that did resemble a giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on. We know you want to laugh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be easier if you do.&rdquo;</p><p>S2 was breathing heavily, his chest heaving. He didn&rsquo;t want to give Tonys satisfaction. Not when two hands traced his abdomen muscles, not when ten fingers wriggled against his ribs, digging in softly into the spaces between the bones. It wasn&rsquo;t immediate gratification like with Tonys, where all it took was a wiggle of fingers an inch away from the ticklish spot and that was enough to have them giggling helplessly, or like with Steve who was more open and relaxed when it came to tickling and didn&rsquo;t hold back. S2 felt better in a ler role, but maybe being a lee for once won&rsquo;t be bad. Tonys looked like having fun, testing him and trying to make him crack.</p><p>&ldquo;HA!&rdquo; S2 tossed his head back, and it was the loudest sound from his so far, when hands grazed the top of his thighs, leaving a tingly feeling behind. &ldquo;Oh, my g-gosh\u2026&rdquo; S2 grunted out when nails were involved and it became particularly bad when he felt light brushing around his kneecaps. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t laughing yet, but the spasming of the muscles told Tonys enough.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get to tickle him here often enough,&rdquo; T2 smiled, using both hands to draw light patterns into the thigh closer to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Me neither with my Steve,&rdquo; Tony replied casually, using his fingertips to brush the thigh on his side. &ldquo;We should get them side by side and test which one has more ticklish spots!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You two forgot that I am here?&rdquo; Steve asked, lifting his eyes up for a second from the sketchbook. He decided to stick around and sat on the armchair, sketching the special moment between his lovers into his notebook. S2 trying to hold back, Tonys&rsquo;s mischievous smile - it would be a good drawing.</p><p>&ldquo;We never said when,&rdquo; T1 grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;So beware,&rdquo; T2 added with an identical grin.</p><p>&ldquo;I will sleep with one eye open,&rdquo; Steve decided to humor his boyfriends, eyes focusing back on the drawing.</p><p>&ldquo;HA-HA!&rdquo;</p><p>The sound made him stop temporarily. Figures. It was expected that from thigh tickling Tonys would soon move up to the hips, and Steve knew how sensitive that area was. Just watching Tonys lightly pushing their fingers into the joint, already made his skin crawl. Both brunets were clearly delighted with watching T2 huffing his cheeks out and trying not to laugh and decided to focus on that spot for a while. It wasn&rsquo;t until T2 started to squeeze the hip between his thumb and pointer finger when S2 finally cracked.</p><p>&ldquo;PHHH-HAHAHA!&rdquo;</p><p>Before Tonys could properly gloat because of breaking the soldier, S2 yanked his hands back to himself and wrapped around both Tonys, drawing them close.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for today!&rdquo; S2 decided, voice cracking with laughter. There was even more laughter, but not from him, when he pinned his fingers into brunets&rsquo;s sides, tickling wild. Seemed that S2&rsquo;s reaction to tickling was to retaliate, while Tonys curled in his lap and started to laugh their hearts out. Steve felt like laughing too, deciding that he already had a good outline of the previous scene and turned the page to a clean one, having a new picture to sketch.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait-wait-ahahaha! Steheheve!&rdquo; T2 called, trying to wriggle away from the tickling hand, but S2 was holding him good. &ldquo;I cahahahan&rsquo;t laugh! Hurts!&rdquo; he continued to protest and giggle, meaning his still hurting jaw. Laughing made him clink his teeth together abruptly, and it wasn&rsquo;t good for his freshly made dental filling. After hearing the words, S2 let go of his Tony, keeping his other hand buried into T1&rsquo;s side. T2, being the helpful one, decided to team up with his boyfriend and reached over for T1, yanking on his hands and making him fall into S2&rsquo;s lap, belly first.</p><p>S2 grinned, wide and delighted, receiving such a nice present. &ldquo;Thanks, babe,&rdquo; he said, meaning T2, using both hands to scratch over T1&rsquo;s back and sides.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; T2 chirped happily, enjoying his counterpart&rsquo;s panicked shrills and a lot of kicking.</p><p>&ldquo;The heheheheck! Stahahap ihihiht!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. I can stop it on your back, but you will turn and give me your tummy,&rdquo; S2 bargained, wriggling his fingers along the spine, paying a lot of attention to the patch of skin just above Tony&rsquo;s bubble butt.</p><p>&ldquo;N-no ahahaha!&rdquo; Tony called in panic, managing to push himself up, and trying to crawl away. S2 followed immediately after him, and pinned him down to the couch with his body, despite the screaming, screaming soon changing into laughter when S2&rsquo;s hands were back on him, squeezing his sides and lips nuzzling into his neck. T2 giggled sweetly but decided to not get involved anymore and sat in the far corner of the couch. Steve would love to continue to sketch, putting his memories on paper to have them for longer, but then he looked at T2, feeling that it wasn&rsquo;t fair to leave him like that, while his Tony was getting his dose of affection. Sketching could wait.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; Steve said, plopping down on the couch next to the brunet and pulling him into himself.</p><p>&ldquo;No! Steve, no!&rdquo; T2 protested, curling and already batting on S1&rsquo;s hands on his tummy, &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t laugh!&rdquo; he reminded, but he was already smiling and laughing. Just a cute reaction he and Tony shared when they were threatened with tickling.</p><p>&ldquo;I will be gentle. Promise,&rdquo; Steve said, meaning it and thinking that T2 deserved some sweet time for himself after the exhausting day.</p><p>&ldquo;O-okay\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>Ah, there it was. Whole palms pressed to his skin and rubbing circles into his belly. A perfectly measured pressure, one that told his brain that he was getting a massage and there was no need to run, but also the one that tingled his skin with ticklish sensations. S2 had tried, but so far he wasn&rsquo;t able to achieve that perfect balance and his touch ended ticklish more often than not. Once it would be over, T2 would have to talk with S1 about giving his boyfriend some pointers.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, watch this,&rdquo; there was a whisper in his ear and T2 fluttered his eyes open, not really knowing when they closed from utter delight. He saw S1&rsquo;s foot inching closer to where his Steve was still tickling T1 and the two of them were making a lot of noise. T2 watched through half-lidded eyes and what happened made his dreamy smile much wider. Using his toes, S1 started to tickle S2&rsquo;s socked sole, right away causing him to laugh and jerk his foot.</p><p>&ldquo;STAHAHP IHIT!&rdquo; S2 called in protest, torn between fully collapsing on Tony in a ticklish heap, and continuing to get the other Tony. &ldquo;Whoeheheher is doing thahaht STAHAP!&rdquo; he demanded, trying to tug his tickled foot underneath himself.</p><p>S1 and T2 laughed, the sound getting lost in T1 and S2&rsquo;s louder laughter, but Steve complied. It was supposed to be just a short break and the main prize was in his lap. He continued the tummy rub, feeling T2 melting in his arms and listening to his Tony&rsquo;s panicked laughter.</p><p>Until&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;ACHOO!&rdquo;</p><p>The laughter stopped and Steve stilled his hand, blinking at the man in his lap. T2 sniffled and wrinkled his nose, feeling another itch.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh oh\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ahh-choo!&rdquo;</p><p>S2 jumped away when this time it was Tony who sneezed, not as strongly as T2 did, but still. Tony looked surprised himself, his eyes widening.</p><p>Steves exchanged worried looks. Seemed that while they averted one crisis, a new one started. <br/></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/180700178794/double-trouble-reunion-part-8\">&lt;\u2013</a> previous part // next part <a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/182609719634/double-trouble-reunion-part-10\">\u2014&gt;\u00a0</a></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br/></p><p><b>OPENING A TAG LIST FOR DTR!</b> If you want to be noted about updates for this series, leave a comment below or send me an ask!

Dammit. Was he too loud? He got so caught up in his project that he forgot he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>With big eyes, T2 noticed that everyone was looking at him, concerned by the pained yelp from seconds ago. T1 paused his work, furrowing his eyebrows, some car grease stain on his cheek and already crazy hair from rubbing the strands in frustration. Steves had been sitting the old couch in the corner, S1 keeping his book open but not following the text focused on T2, while his Steve still had a pencil pressed to his sketchbook but didn\u2019t continue, just like S1 sending him a calculating look.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWhat- Nothing is wrong,\u201d T2 replied immediately, trying to shrug the problem off.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you holding your hand pressed to your right cheek?\u201d T1 asked, squinting more at him.</p><p>Nice. T2 immediately lowered his hand, realizing that he was giving himself away. Smooth.</p><p>\u201cHelps me think,\u201d more lies. \u201cIt is a quirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is not,\u201d Steve said loudly from the couch. \u201cYou both stick out tongues while working, that is your quirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople change, okay?\u201d T2 exclaimed impatiently. Why they were still on this topic? He was perfectly fine. Fine fine fine.</p><p>\u201cBabe, do your teeth hurt?\u201d S2 asked, not breaking eye contact with his boyfriend.</p><p>Another twitch. That was pretty confirmative. Damn his Steve for reading him so fast.</p><p>\u201cOh, so that is why you were chewing only with your left side of the jaw today,\u201d Tony said, pointing to the left side of his own face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you asked me for an ice pack, saying that your head hurt,\u201d Steve continued.</p><p>T2\u2019s mouth opened in surprise. Seemed that his Steve wasn\u2019t the only one who could read his behavior correctly. Still, he needed to deny everything. \u201cTeeth are technically head area, so I wasn\u2019t really lying-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go to the dentist,\u201d S2 ended the discussion.</p><p>Another twitch. This time the twitch was followed by a sudden turn and running out of the workshop in panic. Steves were faster, but Tony was closer and he was the one who leaped first to the escaping brunet, holding him back.</p><p>\u201cAh ah ah!\u201d Tony tugged the other him closer, ignoring the whining and struggling. \u201cWhy are you running?\u201d Tony asked, trying to sound innocent and failing, an evilly gleeful smile giving him away. Jerk.</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d T2 grunted, trying to push himself away from the other him. Despite everything, Tony had some good upper body strength, and T2 was struggling.</p><p>\u201cI really have no idea-\u201d</p><p>A loud sigh, when Steves walked the distance and stood near their boyfriends. Enough of this.</p><p>\u201cI am guessing your Tony is afraid of the dentist too?\u201d Steve asked the other him, sounding somehow tired.</p><p>\u201cTerrified,\u201d S2 confirmed, and both Tonys voiced out their protests at being humiliated like that. Tony let his guard down and got elbowed by T2, who leaped to his Steve for protection. \u201cHey, you are fine, babe,\u201d S2 said, wrapping arms around his boyfriend when T2 crashed into his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go,\u201d T2 said, doing his best wounded doe impression and trembling. His Steve was kind. He won\u2019t let them hurt him.</p><p>\u201cToo bad, you are going,\u201d S2 said, sounding sorry but firm. It was the only way.</p><p>Immediately, T2 pushed himself away and took a step in Steve\u2019s direction. \u201cSteve-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said, sounding even firmer than S2. T2 stopped in his tracks. All three of them betrayed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, anyway?\u201d Tony made a comment, shrugging his arms. \u201cI will just call my dentist and we will zip over to New York for a quick check-up-\u201d</p><p>T2 wrapped arms around himself, feeling betrayed and abandoned. He really, really didn\u2019t want to go.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d S2 wrapped an arm around his boyfriend and pulled him, placing a reassuring kiss on the top of his head. Tony was blowing this situation way out of proportions. \u201cMaybe it is just your wisdom teeth coming out, but we still have to check it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT2 doesn\u2019t have wisdom teeth?\u201d Steve asked, and Tony stopped with a phone in his hand, just about to make an appointment.</p><p>\u201cNo, they never came out,\u201d S2 answered, looking puzzled at the other couple.</p><p>Steve and Tony exchanged worried looks.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have a problem,\u201d Tony said, putting his phone away.</p><p>\u201cTony already had his wisdom teeth removed. All four of them,\u201d Steve said, cringing at the memory of that day. It wasn\u2019t a fun experience for neither Tony or Steve. \u201cAs for someone who has such a big mouth, his jaw couldn\u2019t fit four extra teeth,\u201d he tried to joke to loosen the atmosphere, but only Tony laughed, while S2 cracked a smile and T2 didn\u2019t react at all, busy with hiding into his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cI guess we have to call some clinic here and make an emergency appointment,\u201d Tony decided, asking Friday to find a one and book a visit today.</p><p>T2 lifted his head up, hearing the news. He was supposed to go to an unknown dentist who didn\u2019t have any of his dental records and just trust them like that?</p><p>Heck no.</p><p>\u201cOw, Tony!\u201d S2 called in protest when without any warning T2 tried to claw his way out of his arms and run to freedom. Maybe to Canada.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYou will be fine.\u201d</p><p>T2 sniffled, hearing the words being repeated time after time. He was in the backseat with T1 who kept holding his hand and caressing his knuckles with a thumb in hopes of calming him down. Steves were in the front, S1 driving, orientating himself better around California. If T2 had to go to the dentist, he made sure everyone would accompany him. Except for T2\u2019s comforting and his quiet sniffling, the ride was pretty quiet, until they reached their destination.</p><p>\u201cWe are here,\u201d Steve said, parking the car in front of the clinic. It was one of the newest kind, promising quick service, even for most complicated procedures and zero pain.</p><p>T2 glanced up, seeing the white building and neon with the clinic\u2019s name. He lowered his head down again and didn\u2019t move while Steves got out of the car and T1 unbuckled their seat belts. The door opened from his side, and T2 remained still.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d S2 said, taking T2\u2019s hand and gently pulling him out. Before he could do that, Tony scooted closer and placed a kiss on T2\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d T1 said with a smile and T2 widened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going with us?\u201d Steve asked, frowning at his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it would be suspicious if we walk in there, looking like clones? It is enough that you two look the same,\u201d Tony made an excuse, pointing from Steve to Steve.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d Steve quickly protested, safely hidden under sunglasses and a baseball cap on his head, while S2 pulled a hoodie over his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not a very good disguise,\u201d Tony pointed out, crossing his legs with a grin. \u201cI am gonna wait for you all here,\u201d he decided, waving goodbye to them.</p><p>S2 pursed his lips but didn\u2019t say anything, managing to take T2 out of the car, who was still looking with wide, betrayed eyes at his counterpart. When they stepped away, Steve leaned in, looking irritated.</p><p>\u201cWe will discuss this later, Tony,\u201d he hissed, closing the door.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t seem affected. He watched the three of them walking into the clinic and when the coast was clear, he curled and wrapped arms around himself, letting out a long time held in shudder.</p><p>There was no way he was going in there. Godspeed, T2.</p><p>***</p><p>The waiting room was bright and inviting, with many chairs, magazines and even some corner for kids with paper and crayons. T2 was handed a form he had filled in in silence and then a receptionist collected it from him, asking the three of them to wait. They were sitting under a wall, away from everyone else waiting, Tony between Steves. He was looking cautiously from one patient to the other, seeing calm faces and nothing like his worried one. The time was flying and soon they reached an hour mark of waiting, and while T2 barely said anything during that time, Steves kept talking as if trying to fill in for him.</p><p>\u201cThis clinic has great reviews-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will go really fast, Tony, promise-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are in good hands-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go to the bathroom,\u201d T2 said, spotting the door around the corner and standing up.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Just come back soon, we don\u2019t know when it will be your turn.\u201d</p><p>T2 nodded and started walking. After a few steps and a quick exchange behind his back, he heard someone standing up and walking behind him. T2 turned around and saw S1.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go to the bathroom too?\u201d T2 asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d S1 replied, smiling broadly. \u201cJust making sure you won\u2019t escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am already here, why would I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony once tried to squeeze out through the bathroom window. I am not taking any chances for that to happen with you.\u201d</p><p>Plan failed. Still, he had to roll with it.</p><p>\u201cI am not planning to - stop it!\u201d T2 ordered, resuming walking and seeing S1 closely following. \u201cI said stop it! Steve, tell him to not follow me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and follow him,\u201d S2 said calmly, reaching for one of the colorful magazines.</p><p>\u201cNo! I - Steve!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all when T2 started running, S1 right after him, until T2 true to his words zoomed into the bathroom and closed the door with a loud bang.</p><p>***</p><p>Just a little bit more. Come on. Almost -</p><p>Who was he kidding.</p><p>T2 wriggled away from the window with an impatient huff. There was no way he could squeeze through it. He could put out his arm or leg, but not the rest of his body. Windows were probably designed to not let any kids escape. Little snots. If the window was any bigger, he could escape easily, but because the clinic was childproofed, he was stuck. It didn\u2019t help that through the window he could see their car, knowing that T1 was inside, safe and without any worries. Bastard would pay for leaving him with those harpies.</p><p>Giving up, T2 washed his hands and made a face at himself in the mirror. He stretched his lips and tried to take a look inside his mouth wondering what was happening, but besides an exploding pain in his lower jaw, he couldn\u2019t say. His teeth looked fine, clean and sparkling. If something was happening it had to be in the roots or in the gums. Great.</p><p>T2 peaked his head out of the bathroom and narrowed his eyes at S1 standing leaned over a wall, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cOh, you still here?\u201d T2 asked, sounding offended.</p><p>Non taken and S1 only smiled. \u201cCome on. Your turn isn\u2019t yet, but S2 is working on that.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned at the words and as they began to walk back to their seats. He saw his Steve leaning over the counter and conversing with a receptionist, a different one than the one that handed him the form. Much younger and flintier. T2 didn\u2019t like S2\u2019s smile even a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he flirting?\u201d Tony asked, stopping halfway and staring at his fiance.</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Steve asked back, also looking at S2. Huh. The other him seemed relaxed and was smiling charmingly, giving all his attention to the receptionist who was smiling and laughing a bit too much as for a professional conversation. So, that\u2019s how he looked while flirting\u2026 \u201cI am sure he is not, he is just trying to bump you in the line,\u201d he said, remembering S2\u2019s mouthed out words while he was standing and looking after T2.</p><p>\u201cHe is flirting,\u201d T2 said, sounding indignant. \u201cCome on,\u201d he grabbed S1\u2019s hand and changed the direction, going to the reception desk, planning to give his boyfriend a piece of his mind. He was stopped.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d S1 shook his head, and took T2 by the arms instead, sitting him down on a nearby chair. \u201cYou are staying here and I will get S2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?!\u201d T2 called after Steve, fingers curling into fists out of frustration.</p><p>\u201cToo close to the door, not risking it!\u201d</p><p>Tony just sunk into the chair, his irritation level rising. The pulsating pain in his lower jaw was not helping either. He didn\u2019t hear much of the conversation when S1 walked closer and S2 straightened up and they exchanged some words, but he saw clearly as the receptionist looked from one sexy blond to the other sexy blond and brightened even more.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys twins?\u201d she asked, purring out the words, and batting her long eyelashes.</p><p>That did it.</p><p>T2 leaped half of the room and just as S1 blushed, and S2 opened his mouth to confirm or deny or whatever he planned, T2 stood between both of them and wrapped each arm around Steves\u2019 necks, pulling them closer to himself.</p><p>\u201cNo, they are not,\u201d T2 said in a sunny voice, smiling beautifully, despite the aching pain. \u201cBut aren\u2019t they both gorgeous? I am up for some nice threesome action today,\u201d he said, ignoring that S1 stiffened in panic, while S2 was clearly uncomfortable too, just not so visibly as the other him.</p><p>The receptionist instead of being taken aback by such blatant display, brightened ever more, eyeing Tony up and down. She crossed palms under her chin and leaned in closer. \u201cMaybe even some foursome,\u201d she purred back.</p><p>For a second, T2\u2019s face gave away how the unexpected offer surprised him, but soon it morphed into his trained charming smile and faked laughter, which to an unskilled eye looked very real and honest. \u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d he decided on behalf of three of them and added even a small wink. He turned around with flustered Steves, walking back to their seats. \u201cI forgot this was California\u2026\u201d he grunted quietly, so only Steves could hear him. That got uncomfortable very quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you doing?\u201d S2 demanded answers in a quiet voice when all of them sat down.</p><p>\u201cAnd what were you doing?\u201d T2 hissed back, eyes narrowing in anger. \u201cI just walked away for few minutes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, I was just trying to quicken your appointment!\u201d S2 hissed back, both men turned to each other, faces just inches apart.</p><p>\u201cOh sure, you seemed like having a ton of fun while doing that -\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys, calm down,\u201d Steve said, putting his hand on T2\u2019s shoulder and pushing him to the back. They were waiting already for nearly two hours, despite having an appointment, it was getting on everyone\u2019s nerves. \u201cTaking your frustration on each other won\u2019t resolve anything.\u201d</p><p>Both T2 and S2 eyed each other for a while longer, before their gazes softened. It was true, and the pain was dulling T2\u2019s mind and he was becoming increasingly irritated, while S2 felt hopeless, not able to ease his lover\u2019s pain. \u00a0It was a tough situation for all of them.</p><p>\u201cYou are right,\u201d T2 admitted. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said to S2, knowing that in no world Steve would flirt with someone else and mean it. Well, maybe except T1 and S1.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry too,\u201d S2 said, corners of his lips turning down as he gently cupped Tony\u2019s face, the side where the pain was located. He was really sorry he couldn\u2019t relieve the pain and he hated to see his boyfriend suffering and scared. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope it won\u2019t take much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t, you are a charmer,\u201d T2 smiled, quickly nuzzling into S2\u2019s palm and kissing it. \u201cUnlike you, from what I heard,\u201d he turned to face Steve and booped him on the nose.</p><p>\u201cUh, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cT1 told me. He said you were fumbling a lot before you gathered the courage to ask him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d S2 grinned, that annoying, smug grin, Steve disliked so much as he leaned over his Tony\u2019s back and put his chin on his shoulder. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, I bet you had the same problems as I did,\u201d Steve grunted, not liking the way both men were looking at him. Fine, he wasn\u2019t the master of flirting. But in the end, he was with Tony so he couldn\u2019t be that hopeless, right?</p><p>\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t,\u201d S2 shrugged, \u201cbut might be also because my Tony is easy.\u201d</p><p>T2 scoffed and turned his head to look at his lover, mouth grimaced into a scowl and not because of pain. \u201cDid you just call me fucking easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kinda are,\u201d S2 said, winking to Steve, \u201cI just needed to touch you in the right place to make you all mine.\u201d</p><p>There it was. Five fingers brushing his side. T2 jerked and squealed in surprise and bumped into S1 to get away.</p><p>\u201cOh, that kind of easy,\u201d S1 quickly caught on, repeating the slow movement, while S2 moved in closer, not leaving T2 enough space to move. \u201cThat\u2019s a good kind of easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo - you can\u2019t - nooo,\u201d T2 squirmed, trying to keep his voice down to not attract any attention to them, but four hands were already all over his waist and sneaking underneath his jacket to remain unnoticed. \u201cD - don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be quiet and no one will see,\u201d S2 advised, rubbing small circles with his thumbs into T2\u2019s sides.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it can\u2019t be that bad, can it?\u201d S1 teased in a sweet voice, using his whole palms to glide over T2\u2019s belly, slowly, using just enough pressure.</p><p>T2 huffed his cheeks out, trying to stop the upcoming wave of laughter. He tried to catch Steves hands with his, but he was severely outnumbered. In the privacy of their home he would be extremely delighted, but being tickled in public was something that made him feel very vulnerable. His breath was becoming shorter, and any second he felt that he would burst into laughter and probably die of embarrassment -</p><p>\u201cMr. Rhodes! James Rhodes!\u201d came a voice calling the next patient.</p><p>Hearing the pilot\u2019s name, Steves stopped the teasing touches and T2 jumped out of his seat, escaping from intrusive hands, taking in some deep, calming breaths.</p><p>\u201cRhodey is here?\u201d Steve asked, looking around the waiting room, but not seeing any familiar faces.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see him,\u201d S2 drew his eyebrows together. Strange. If Rhodey was back in the country, wouldn\u2019t he inform Tony? \u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d he called, seeing that Tony moved forward and away from them.</p><p>\u201cI was called,\u201d T2 explained, turning around to face his boyfriends, smiling in humor at the confused faces, \u201cwell, I couldn\u2019t give them my real name, right?\u201d he explained with a laugh, walking through the door he was pointed to and closing them behind himself. Safe. Safe from teasing and fingers wiggling against his skin. There was still some tingling around his waist, and he felt his face cooling down. That was an embarrassing experience.</p><p>\u201cMr. Rhodes, please sit down.\u201d</p><p>T2\u2019s blood turned cold. He was so focused on getting away, that he didn\u2019t notice that he willingly walked into a much worse situation. Much, much worse.</p><p>When the door leading to the dentist\u2019s office flung open and T2 screamed \u2019<i>GET IN HERE!</i>\u2019 in sheer panic, Steves didn\u2019t question it, just sprinted inside the room.</p><p>***</p><p>Tony glanced at the hour displayed on his phone. Why it was taking so long? He saw people walking out of the clinic, but no luck with his partners. He was getting bored and if he knew that it would take so long he would take his tablet - and then a nasty thought appeared in his mind, causing him to become nervous.</p><p>What was happening in there that T2\u2019s appointment was taking so long? Maybe it wasn\u2019t just an ordinary toothache, able to fix during one visit. Maybe the problem ran deeper, happening in the roots, maybe even deeper in the bones of the jaw -</p><p>Bones. Bones cracking with a sickening, almost unreal sound but so vivid in his head.</p><p>\u201cWait-\u201d Tony gasped to himself, his mind bringing memories from the past he thought he had pushed deep into his subconsciousness. \u201cNo-\u201d</p><p>Remove the bones. Remove the flesh. A sound of dull tools. Deeper and deeper, drilling into him.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Tony closed his eyes, pain flooding his brain and making his muscles ache. He didn\u2019t realize but he pressed a hand to his chest, just in the middle. It felt like bones, but it was all fake. Just the pain was real.</p><p>Cold weight smothering him. Blood spilling. Screaming. Someone was screaming. Soon he realized that it was his own screaming. Way in the past, in the darkness, struggling to breathe on a makeshift operating table in a cave.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Tony yelled, bending in half and covering his ears, trying to mute out the sound of metal, the screaming, the whirring of electric machines.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cI think it went well,\u201d S2 praised.</p><p>\u201cYou did good,\u201d S1 praised more, leaning in to place a kiss on top of T2\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cMhhhhmm,\u201d T2 whined quietly, the anesthesia in his jaw numbing his gums and tongue and making his speech a bit drawled out. It would soon pass, but for the time being, he preferred not to talk and just held Steves hands as the three of them left the dentist\u2019s office. He felt really tired after all this stress, but at least he would be able to sleep tonight, without being woken up by the pain every hour or so. They could go back home.</p><p>The three of them walked down the corridor when something caught S1\u2019s attention. In the kids\u2019 corner, sat at a small plastic, round table on bright, yellow puff was Tony, surrounded by kids and their mothers. He was holding a red crayon in his hand and drawing something on paper, kids making their way to look at it, while Tony was chatting with the mothers and with the kids, all at the same time. It was somehow heartwarming to see.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Steve called, and Tony turned around, smiling at the three of them. He excused himself and said goodbye to the kids, taking the piece of paper from the table and skipping to his lovers.</p><p>\u201cHey! Why it was taking so long? You okay?\u201d he asked, looking from one person to the other, but finally stopping on T2\u2019s shocked face.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, but what - what are you doing here?\u201d S1 asked, sounding pleasantly surprised. The smile was dulled, when he noticed that Tony looked a bit pale and his lower lip was trembling.</p><p>\u201cI was getting worried. You were gone for a long time,\u201d T1 said, looking at S2 for a change. \u201cIs Tony okay?\u201d he asked, alarmed by his counterpart\u2019s stillness and quietness.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d S2 confirmed, sounding a bit in shock himself with seeing T1, \u201cjust had some bad cavity between his molars, but it is fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d T1 grimaced involuntarily. That had to involve a lot of work. \u201cOh, I have something for you,\u201d he said, lifting the piece of paper and focusing back on T2. \u201cOne of the kids advised I make it for you,\u201d he smiled, somehow clumsily, letting them see what was on the paper. In red and yellow crayon was something they could only describe as a stick figure in Iron Man colors. It was signed with a \u2018get well soon!\u2019 in Tony\u2019s chaotic print. \u201cI know it is not that great, and Steves could draw something more beautiful for you -\u201d</p><p>T2 kept looking at the picture, feeling some warm emotions brewing in him. He loosened the hold with Steves\u2019 hands and instead hugged Tony, embracing him with all the strength he had left.</p><p>\u201cOof,\u201d T1 grunted at the bear hug but hugged back. \u201cGlad you like it,\u201d he laughed in humor. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Steves exchanged warm looks, when both Tonys turned around and walked out of the clinic, the two of them following. There would come a time, Steve would ask Tony about this day and what exactly made him leave the car, but for the time being, he decided to stay quiet.</p><p>***</p><p>The ride back home was much more cheerful and in a merrier atmosphere. The anesthesia was slowly wearing off, and except some numb feeling and pain when he clinked his teeth too strong together, T2 was feeling fine and was ready to take a part in the ongoing discussion. And boy, he wanted to take part in it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Tony called loudly in disbelief. \u201cYou went easy on him!\u201d he accused after hearing how S2 and T2 had been playing with Steve a few nights ago.</p><p>\u201cWe still had to work harder on him. He is tougher than you are,\u201d S2 replied in a teasing voice, trading places with S1 and riding them back home. S1 grinned proudly after hearing the comment. It wasn\u2019t exactly a praise, but he would take it.</p><p>\u201cNo blindfold, no ink brush, no two toothbrushes!\u201d Tony listed all things that were used on him, but not on his fiance, sounding angry. \u201cNot fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you still enjoyed it, right?\u201d S2 asked, looking at Tony\u2019s reflection in the rear-view mirror, seeing his pouting face. \u201cBesides, we had to blindfold you, otherwise you would come in seconds and that would end our evening quickly.\u201d</p><p>Tony groaned in embarrassment, while T2 chuckled quietly. Not their fault that being tied down and teased and having their belly buttons played with was always a big turn on for them both.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I thought I took two toothbrushes with me,\u201d T2 said, frowning at the memory. Using one toothbrush on Steve was already rewarding, but imagine the possibilities if he had two.</p><p>\u201cYou know, me too,\u201d S2 agreed, sure that his lover took two. Maybe his memory was a bit wonky on that.</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Steve laughed, pointing attention to himself and smirking proudly, \u201cjust when you were handcuffing me to the bed, I kicked the second toothbrush down. It is probably still under our bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheater!\u201d</p><p>At Tonys loud whining, both Steves laughed. Just from two different reasons.</p><p>\u201cI guess that means we now have to repeat everything. All three of us. Right, guys?\u201d S2 asked, hearing Tonys agreeing with him from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d S1 grinned, sporting a different point of view. \u201cAnd when it will be finally your turn, huh?\u201d he asked the other him, seeing a nervous muscle jump in S2\u2019s jaw. Steve grinned wider and turned to Tonys. \u201cWhat do you say that instead of getting me, I will help you get S2?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer, but the car suddenly became really, really quiet and there were some tension and planning in the air. Involuntarily, S2 started to slow down, prolonging their way back home, feeling three intense stares on himself.</p><p>***</p><p>S2 could feel it. They were following him, not letting eyes off of him. And he barely walked inside the house and just took his shoes off. Maybe if he kept ignoring them, they would go away.</p><p>\u201cYou had to put it in their heads?!\u201d S2 groaned, noticing Steve making his way past him.</p><p>Steve blinked and smiled innocently. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You chicken?\u201d he asked, showing all teeth in a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cNo, just -\u201d S2 started, sitting on the couch. As soon as he did that, Tonys jumped to him, sitting on opposite sides and having him between. Steve couldn\u2019t help but to laugh at the nervous jump the other him did, his blue eyes widening almost comically as he looked from one Tony to the other.</p><p>\u201cSo, you ready?\u201d T1 asked enthusiastically, firm on going with the plan.</p><p>\u201cYou know, that will really make me feel better,\u201d T2 decided to go with the innocent card, trying to use his bad day as an excuse.</p><p>Slowly, S2 was giving up. He knew that both Starks could be stubborn and maybe the sooner this experience would be behind him, the better. For sure, he wouldn\u2019t stand the tension with both Tonys following him everywhere and planning a surprise attack.</p><p>\u201cI will regret this, right?\u201d S2 asked, meeting S1\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cWe will see,\u201d S1 replied with a laugh. Totally unhelpful.</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d S2 agreed, leaning into the couch and putting arms on the backrest, leaving his torso exposed. \u201cDo your worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act as if it is a punishment,\u201d T2 scolded his boyfriend, not appreciating the dramatic attitude. He was supposed to be the dramatic half in this relationship.</p><p>\u201cYeah, think of it as a bonding experience,\u201d T1 added, being the first one who reached to S2\u2019s side and softly wiggled his fingertips over the flank.</p><p>The reaction wasn\u2019t instant, and S2 remained still, an only small twitch of his lips giving him away. He won\u2019t go down easily.</p><p>\u201cOh, you want to play it tough?\u201d T1 asked, keeping the touch slow and just brushing his fingertips. Up and down.</p><p>\u201cHe always wants to play it tough,\u201d T2 confirmed, repeating the same kind of touch, just on the side closer to him. \u201cHe is just mean like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like a challenge. We will have fun with you,\u201d T1 said in a pleasant voice, scooting in closer and placing a scratchy kiss on S2\u2019s neck. That got them a better reaction and some muffled sound as the blond scrunched his shoulders up.</p><p>\u201cOh, good idea,\u201d T2 brightened and moved closer too, placing his kiss on S2\u2019s ear. More curling and another held back sound, that did resemble a giggle.</p><p>\u201cCome on. We know you want to laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be easier if you do.\u201d</p><p>S2 was breathing heavily, his chest heaving. He didn\u2019t want to give Tonys satisfaction. Not when two hands traced his abdomen muscles, not when ten fingers wriggled against his ribs, digging in softly into the spaces between the bones. It wasn\u2019t immediate gratification like with Tonys, where all it took was a wiggle of fingers an inch away from the ticklish spot and that was enough to have them giggling helplessly, or like with Steve who was more open and relaxed when it came to tickling and didn\u2019t hold back. S2 felt better in a ler role, but maybe being a lee for once won\u2019t be bad. Tonys looked like having fun, testing him and trying to make him crack.</p><p>\u201cHA!\u201d S2 tossed his head back, and it was the loudest sound from his so far, when hands grazed the top of his thighs, leaving a tingly feeling behind. \u201cOh, my g-gosh\u2026\u201d S2 grunted out when nails were involved and it became particularly bad when he felt light brushing around his kneecaps. Maybe he wasn\u2019t laughing yet, but the spasming of the muscles told Tonys enough.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get to tickle him here often enough,\u201d T2 smiled, using both hands to draw light patterns into the thigh closer to him.</p><p>\u201cMe neither with my Steve,\u201d Tony replied casually, using his fingertips to brush the thigh on his side. \u201cWe should get them side by side and test which one has more ticklish spots!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two forgot that I am here?\u201d Steve asked, lifting his eyes up for a second from the sketchbook. He decided to stick around and sat on the armchair, sketching the special moment between his lovers into his notebook. S2 trying to hold back, Tonys\u2019s mischievous smile - it would be a good drawing.</p><p>\u201cWe never said when,\u201d T1 grinned.</p><p>\u201cSo beware,\u201d T2 added with an identical grin.</p><p>\u201cI will sleep with one eye open,\u201d Steve decided to humor his boyfriends, eyes focusing back on the drawing.</p><p>\u201cHA-HA!\u201d</p><p>The sound made him stop temporarily. Figures. It was expected that from thigh tickling Tonys would soon move up to the hips, and Steve knew how sensitive that area was. Just watching Tonys lightly pushing their fingers into the joint, already made his skin crawl. Both brunets were clearly delighted with watching T2 huffing his cheeks out and trying not to laugh and decided to focus on that spot for a while. It wasn\u2019t until T2 started to squeeze the hip between his thumb and pointer finger when S2 finally cracked.</p><p>\u201cPHHH-HAHAHA!\u201d</p><p>Before Tonys could properly gloat because of breaking the soldier, S2 yanked his hands back to himself and wrapped around both Tonys, drawing them close.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough for today!\u201d S2 decided, voice cracking with laughter. There was even more laughter, but not from him, when he pinned his fingers into brunets\u2019s sides, tickling wild. Seemed that S2\u2019s reaction to tickling was to retaliate, while Tonys curled in his lap and started to laugh their hearts out. Steve felt like laughing too, deciding that he already had a good outline of the previous scene and turned the page to a clean one, having a new picture to sketch.</p><p>\u201cWait-wait-ahahaha! Steheheve!\u201d T2 called, trying to wriggle away from the tickling hand, but S2 was holding him good. \u201cI cahahahan\u2019t laugh! Hurts!\u201d he continued to protest and giggle, meaning his still hurting jaw. Laughing made him clink his teeth together abruptly, and it wasn\u2019t good for his freshly made dental filling. After hearing the words, S2 let go of his Tony, keeping his other hand buried into T1\u2019s side. T2, being the helpful one, decided to team up with his boyfriend and reached over for T1, yanking on his hands and making him fall into S2\u2019s lap, belly first.</p><p>S2 grinned, wide and delighted, receiving such a nice present. \u201cThanks, babe,\u201d he said, meaning T2, using both hands to scratch over T1\u2019s back and sides.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d T2 chirped happily, enjoying his counterpart\u2019s panicked shrills and a lot of kicking.</p><p>\u201cThe heheheheck! Stahahap ihihiht!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I can stop it on your back, but you will turn and give me your tummy,\u201d S2 bargained, wriggling his fingers along the spine, paying a lot of attention to the patch of skin just above Tony\u2019s bubble butt.</p><p>\u201cN-no ahahaha!\u201d Tony called in panic, managing to push himself up, and trying to crawl away. S2 followed immediately after him, and pinned him down to the couch with his body, despite the screaming, screaming soon changing into laughter when S2\u2019s hands were back on him, squeezing his sides and lips nuzzling into his neck. T2 giggled sweetly but decided to not get involved anymore and sat in the far corner of the couch. Steve would love to continue to sketch, putting his memories on paper to have them for longer, but then he looked at T2, feeling that it wasn\u2019t fair to leave him like that, while his Tony was getting his dose of affection. Sketching could wait.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Steve said, plopping down on the couch next to the brunet and pulling him into himself.</p><p>\u201cNo! Steve, no!\u201d T2 protested, curling and already batting on S1\u2019s hands on his tummy, \u201cI really can\u2019t laugh!\u201d he reminded, but he was already smiling and laughing. Just a cute reaction he and Tony shared when they were threatened with tickling.</p><p>\u201cI will be gentle. Promise,\u201d Steve said, meaning it and thinking that T2 deserved some sweet time for himself after the exhausting day.</p><p>\u201cO-okay\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ah, there it was. Whole palms pressed to his skin and rubbing circles into his belly. A perfectly measured pressure, one that told his brain that he was getting a massage and there was no need to run, but also the one that tingled his skin with ticklish sensations. S2 had tried, but so far he wasn\u2019t able to achieve that perfect balance and his touch ended ticklish more often than not. Once it would be over, T2 would have to talk with S1 about giving his boyfriend some pointers.</p><p>\u201cHey, watch this,\u201d there was a whisper in his ear and T2 fluttered his eyes open, not really knowing when they closed from utter delight. He saw S1\u2019s foot inching closer to where his Steve was still tickling T1 and the two of them were making a lot of noise. T2 watched through half-lidded eyes and what happened made his dreamy smile much wider. Using his toes, S1 started to tickle S2\u2019s socked sole, right away causing him to laugh and jerk his foot.</p><p>\u201cSTAHAHP IHIT!\u201d S2 called in protest, torn between fully collapsing on Tony in a ticklish heap, and continuing to get the other Tony. \u201cWhoeheheher is doing thahaht STAHAP!\u201d he demanded, trying to tug his tickled foot underneath himself.</p><p>S1 and T2 laughed, the sound getting lost in T1 and S2\u2019s louder laughter, but Steve complied. It was supposed to be just a short break and the main prize was in his lap. He continued the tummy rub, feeling T2 melting in his arms and listening to his Tony\u2019s panicked laughter.</p><p>Until\u2026</p><p>\u201cACHOO!\u201d</p><p>The laughter stopped and Steve stilled his hand, blinking at the man in his lap. T2 sniffled and wrinkled his nose, feeling another itch.</p><p>\u201cUh oh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh-choo!\u201d</p><p>S2 jumped away when this time it was Tony who sneezed, not as strongly as T2 did, but still. Tony looked surprised himself, his eyes widening.</p><p>Steves exchanged worried looks. Seemed that while they averted one crisis, a new one started. <br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/180700178794/double-trouble-reunion-part-8\">&lt;\u2013</a> previous part // next part <a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/182609719634/double-trouble-reunion-part-10\">\u2014&gt;\u00a0</a></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br></p><p><b>OPENING A TAG LIST FOR DTR!</b> If you want to be noted about updates for this series, leave a comment below or send me an ask!

Dammit. Was he too loud? He got so caught up in his project that he forgot he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>With big eyes, T2 noticed that everyone was looking at him, concerned by the pained yelp from seconds ago. T1 paused his work, furrowing his eyebrows, some car grease stain on his cheek and already crazy hair from rubbing the strands in frustration. Steves had been sitting the old couch in the corner, S1 keeping his book open but not following the text focused on T2, while his Steve still had a pencil pressed to his sketchbook but didn\u2019t continue, just like S1 sending him a calculating look.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWhat- Nothing is wrong,\u201d T2 replied immediately, trying to shrug the problem off.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you holding your hand pressed to your right cheek?\u201d T1 asked, squinting more at him.</p><p>Nice. T2 immediately lowered his hand, realizing that he was giving himself away. Smooth.</p><p>\u201cHelps me think,\u201d more lies. \u201cIt is a quirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is not,\u201d Steve said loudly from the couch. \u201cYou both stick out tongues while working, that is your quirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople change, okay?\u201d T2 exclaimed impatiently. Why they were still on this topic? He was perfectly fine. Fine fine fine.</p><p>\u201cBabe, do your teeth hurt?\u201d S2 asked, not breaking eye contact with his boyfriend.</p><p>Another twitch. That was pretty confirmative. Damn his Steve for reading him so fast.</p><p>\u201cOh, so that is why you were chewing only with your left side of the jaw today,\u201d Tony said, pointing to the left side of his own face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you asked me for an ice pack, saying that your head hurt,\u201d Steve continued.</p><p>T2\u2019s mouth opened in surprise. Seemed that his Steve wasn\u2019t the only one who could read his behavior correctly. Still, he needed to deny everything. \u201cTeeth are technically head area, so I wasn\u2019t really lying-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go to the dentist,\u201d S2 ended the discussion.</p><p>Another twitch. This time the twitch was followed by a sudden turn and running out of the workshop in panic. Steves were faster, but Tony was closer and he was the one who leaped first to the escaping brunet, holding him back.</p><p>\u201cAh ah ah!\u201d Tony tugged the other him closer, ignoring the whining and struggling. \u201cWhy are you running?\u201d Tony asked, trying to sound innocent and failing, an evilly gleeful smile giving him away. Jerk.</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d T2 grunted, trying to push himself away from the other him. Despite everything, Tony had some good upper body strength, and T2 was struggling.</p><p>\u201cI really have no idea-\u201d</p><p>A loud sigh, when Steves walked the distance and stood near their boyfriends. Enough of this.</p><p>\u201cI am guessing your Tony is afraid of the dentist too?\u201d Steve asked the other him, sounding somehow tired.</p><p>\u201cTerrified,\u201d S2 confirmed, and both Tonys voiced out their protests at being humiliated like that. Tony let his guard down and got elbowed by T2, who leaped to his Steve for protection. \u201cHey, you are fine, babe,\u201d S2 said, wrapping arms around his boyfriend when T2 crashed into his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go,\u201d T2 said, doing his best wounded doe impression and trembling. His Steve was kind. He won\u2019t let them hurt him.</p><p>\u201cToo bad, you are going,\u201d S2 said, sounding sorry but firm. It was the only way.</p><p>Immediately, T2 pushed himself away and took a step in Steve\u2019s direction. \u201cSteve-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said, sounding even firmer than S2. T2 stopped in his tracks. All three of them betrayed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, anyway?\u201d Tony made a comment, shrugging his arms. \u201cI will just call my dentist and we will zip over to New York for a quick check-up-\u201d</p><p>T2 wrapped arms around himself, feeling betrayed and abandoned. He really, really didn\u2019t want to go.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d S2 wrapped an arm around his boyfriend and pulled him, placing a reassuring kiss on the top of his head. Tony was blowing this situation way out of proportions. \u201cMaybe it is just your wisdom teeth coming out, but we still have to check it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT2 doesn\u2019t have wisdom teeth?\u201d Steve asked, and Tony stopped with a phone in his hand, just about to make an appointment.</p><p>\u201cNo, they never came out,\u201d S2 answered, looking puzzled at the other couple.</p><p>Steve and Tony exchanged worried looks.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have a problem,\u201d Tony said, putting his phone away.</p><p>\u201cTony already had his wisdom teeth removed. All four of them,\u201d Steve said, cringing at the memory of that day. It wasn\u2019t a fun experience for neither Tony or Steve. \u201cAs for someone who has such a big mouth, his jaw couldn\u2019t fit four extra teeth,\u201d he tried to joke to loosen the atmosphere, but only Tony laughed, while S2 cracked a smile and T2 didn\u2019t react at all, busy with hiding into his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cI guess we have to call some clinic here and make an emergency appointment,\u201d Tony decided, asking Friday to find a one and book a visit today.</p><p>T2 lifted his head up, hearing the news. He was supposed to go to an unknown dentist who didn\u2019t have any of his dental records and just trust them like that?</p><p>Heck no.</p><p>\u201cOw, Tony!\u201d S2 called in protest when without any warning T2 tried to claw his way out of his arms and run to freedom. Maybe to Canada.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYou will be fine.\u201d</p><p>T2 sniffled, hearing the words being repeated time after time. He was in the backseat with T1 who kept holding his hand and caressing his knuckles with a thumb in hopes of calming him down. Steves were in the front, S1 driving, orientating himself better around California. If T2 had to go to the dentist, he made sure everyone would accompany him. Except for T2\u2019s comforting and his quiet sniffling, the ride was pretty quiet, until they reached their destination.</p><p>\u201cWe are here,\u201d Steve said, parking the car in front of the clinic. It was one of the newest kind, promising quick service, even for most complicated procedures and zero pain.</p><p>T2 glanced up, seeing the white building and neon with the clinic\u2019s name. He lowered his head down again and didn\u2019t move while Steves got out of the car and T1 unbuckled their seat belts. The door opened from his side, and T2 remained still.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d S2 said, taking T2\u2019s hand and gently pulling him out. Before he could do that, Tony scooted closer and placed a kiss on T2\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d T1 said with a smile and T2 widened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going with us?\u201d Steve asked, frowning at his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it would be suspicious if we walk in there, looking like clones? It is enough that you two look the same,\u201d Tony made an excuse, pointing from Steve to Steve.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d Steve quickly protested, safely hidden under sunglasses and a baseball cap on his head, while S2 pulled a hoodie over his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not a very good disguise,\u201d Tony pointed out, crossing his legs with a grin. \u201cI am gonna wait for you all here,\u201d he decided, waving goodbye to them.</p><p>S2 pursed his lips but didn\u2019t say anything, managing to take T2 out of the car, who was still looking with wide, betrayed eyes at his counterpart. When they stepped away, Steve leaned in, looking irritated.</p><p>\u201cWe will discuss this later, Tony,\u201d he hissed, closing the door.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t seem affected. He watched the three of them walking into the clinic and when the coast was clear, he curled and wrapped arms around himself, letting out a long time held in shudder.</p><p>There was no way he was going in there. Godspeed, T2.</p><p>***</p><p>The waiting room was bright and inviting, with many chairs, magazines and even some corner for kids with paper and crayons. T2 was handed a form he had filled in in silence and then a receptionist collected it from him, asking the three of them to wait. They were sitting under a wall, away from everyone else waiting, Tony between Steves. He was looking cautiously from one patient to the other, seeing calm faces and nothing like his worried one. The time was flying and soon they reached an hour mark of waiting, and while T2 barely said anything during that time, Steves kept talking as if trying to fill in for him.</p><p>\u201cThis clinic has great reviews-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will go really fast, Tony, promise-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are in good hands-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go to the bathroom,\u201d T2 said, spotting the door around the corner and standing up.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Just come back soon, we don\u2019t know when it will be your turn.\u201d</p><p>T2 nodded and started walking. After a few steps and a quick exchange behind his back, he heard someone standing up and walking behind him. T2 turned around and saw S1.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go to the bathroom too?\u201d T2 asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d S1 replied, smiling broadly. \u201cJust making sure you won\u2019t escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am already here, why would I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony once tried to squeeze out through the bathroom window. I am not taking any chances for that to happen with you.\u201d</p><p>Plan failed. Still, he had to roll with it.</p><p>\u201cI am not planning to - stop it!\u201d T2 ordered, resuming walking and seeing S1 closely following. \u201cI said stop it! Steve, tell him to not follow me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and follow him,\u201d S2 said calmly, reaching for one of the colorful magazines.</p><p>\u201cNo! I - Steve!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all when T2 started running, S1 right after him, until T2 true to his words zoomed into the bathroom and closed the door with a loud bang.</p><p>***</p><p>Just a little bit more. Come on. Almost -</p><p>Who was he kidding.</p><p>T2 wriggled away from the window with an impatient huff. There was no way he could squeeze through it. He could put out his arm or leg, but not the rest of his body. Windows were probably designed to not let any kids escape. Little snots. If the window was any bigger, he could escape easily, but because the clinic was childproofed, he was stuck. It didn\u2019t help that through the window he could see their car, knowing that T1 was inside, safe and without any worries. Bastard would pay for leaving him with those harpies.</p><p>Giving up, T2 washed his hands and made a face at himself in the mirror. He stretched his lips and tried to take a look inside his mouth wondering what was happening, but besides an exploding pain in his lower jaw, he couldn\u2019t say. His teeth looked fine, clean and sparkling. If something was happening it had to be in the roots or in the gums. Great.</p><p>T2 peaked his head out of the bathroom and narrowed his eyes at S1 standing leaned over a wall, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cOh, you still here?\u201d T2 asked, sounding offended.</p><p>Non taken and S1 only smiled. \u201cCome on. Your turn isn\u2019t yet, but S2 is working on that.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned at the words and as they began to walk back to their seats. He saw his Steve leaning over the counter and conversing with a receptionist, a different one than the one that handed him the form. Much younger and flintier. T2 didn\u2019t like S2\u2019s smile even a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he flirting?\u201d Tony asked, stopping halfway and staring at his fiance.</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Steve asked back, also looking at S2. Huh. The other him seemed relaxed and was smiling charmingly, giving all his attention to the receptionist who was smiling and laughing a bit too much as for a professional conversation. So, that\u2019s how he looked while flirting\u2026 \u201cI am sure he is not, he is just trying to bump you in the line,\u201d he said, remembering S2\u2019s mouthed out words while he was standing and looking after T2.</p><p>\u201cHe is flirting,\u201d T2 said, sounding indignant. \u201cCome on,\u201d he grabbed S1\u2019s hand and changed the direction, going to the reception desk, planning to give his boyfriend a piece of his mind. He was stopped.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d S1 shook his head, and took T2 by the arms instead, sitting him down on a nearby chair. \u201cYou are staying here and I will get S2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?!\u201d T2 called after Steve, fingers curling into fists out of frustration.</p><p>\u201cToo close to the door, not risking it!\u201d</p><p>Tony just sunk into the chair, his irritation level rising. The pulsating pain in his lower jaw was not helping either. He didn\u2019t hear much of the conversation when S1 walked closer and S2 straightened up and they exchanged some words, but he saw clearly as the receptionist looked from one sexy blond to the other sexy blond and brightened even more.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys twins?\u201d she asked, purring out the words, and batting her long eyelashes.</p><p>That did it.</p><p>T2 leaped half of the room and just as S1 blushed, and S2 opened his mouth to confirm or deny or whatever he planned, T2 stood between both of them and wrapped each arm around Steves\u2019 necks, pulling them closer to himself.</p><p>\u201cNo, they are not,\u201d T2 said in a sunny voice, smiling beautifully, despite the aching pain. \u201cBut aren\u2019t they both gorgeous? I am up for some nice threesome action today,\u201d he said, ignoring that S1 stiffened in panic, while S2 was clearly uncomfortable too, just not so visibly as the other him.</p><p>The receptionist instead of being taken aback by such blatant display, brightened ever more, eyeing Tony up and down. She crossed palms under her chin and leaned in closer. \u201cMaybe even some foursome,\u201d she purred back.</p><p>For a second, T2\u2019s face gave away how the unexpected offer surprised him, but soon it morphed into his trained charming smile and faked laughter, which to an unskilled eye looked very real and honest. \u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d he decided on behalf of three of them and added even a small wink. He turned around with flustered Steves, walking back to their seats. \u201cI forgot this was California\u2026\u201d he grunted quietly, so only Steves could hear him. That got uncomfortable very quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you doing?\u201d S2 demanded answers in a quiet voice when all of them sat down.</p><p>\u201cAnd what were you doing?\u201d T2 hissed back, eyes narrowing in anger. \u201cI just walked away for few minutes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, I was just trying to quicken your appointment!\u201d S2 hissed back, both men turned to each other, faces just inches apart.</p><p>\u201cOh sure, you seemed like having a ton of fun while doing that -\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys, calm down,\u201d Steve said, putting his hand on T2\u2019s shoulder and pushing him to the back. They were waiting already for nearly two hours, despite having an appointment, it was getting on everyone\u2019s nerves. \u201cTaking your frustration on each other won\u2019t resolve anything.\u201d</p><p>Both T2 and S2 eyed each other for a while longer, before their gazes softened. It was true, and the pain was dulling T2\u2019s mind and he was becoming increasingly irritated, while S2 felt hopeless, not able to ease his lover\u2019s pain. \u00a0It was a tough situation for all of them.</p><p>\u201cYou are right,\u201d T2 admitted. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said to S2, knowing that in no world Steve would flirt with someone else and mean it. Well, maybe except T1 and S1.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry too,\u201d S2 said, corners of his lips turning down as he gently cupped Tony\u2019s face, the side where the pain was located. He was really sorry he couldn\u2019t relieve the pain and he hated to see his boyfriend suffering and scared. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope it won\u2019t take much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t, you are a charmer,\u201d T2 smiled, quickly nuzzling into S2\u2019s palm and kissing it. \u201cUnlike you, from what I heard,\u201d he turned to face Steve and booped him on the nose.</p><p>\u201cUh, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cT1 told me. He said you were fumbling a lot before you gathered the courage to ask him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d S2 grinned, that annoying, smug grin, Steve disliked so much as he leaned over his Tony\u2019s back and put his chin on his shoulder. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, I bet you had the same problems as I did,\u201d Steve grunted, not liking the way both men were looking at him. Fine, he wasn\u2019t the master of flirting. But in the end, he was with Tony so he couldn\u2019t be that hopeless, right?</p><p>\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t,\u201d S2 shrugged, \u201cbut might be also because my Tony is easy.\u201d</p><p>T2 scoffed and turned his head to look at his lover, mouth grimaced into a scowl and not because of pain. \u201cDid you just call me fucking easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kinda are,\u201d S2 said, winking to Steve, \u201cI just needed to touch you in the right place to make you all mine.\u201d</p><p>There it was. Five fingers brushing his side. T2 jerked and squealed in surprise and bumped into S1 to get away.</p><p>\u201cOh, that kind of easy,\u201d S1 quickly caught on, repeating the slow movement, while S2 moved in closer, not leaving T2 enough space to move. \u201cThat\u2019s a good kind of easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo - you can\u2019t - nooo,\u201d T2 squirmed, trying to keep his voice down to not attract any attention to them, but four hands were already all over his waist and sneaking underneath his jacket to remain unnoticed. \u201cD - don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be quiet and no one will see,\u201d S2 advised, rubbing small circles with his thumbs into T2\u2019s sides.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it can\u2019t be that bad, can it?\u201d S1 teased in a sweet voice, using his whole palms to glide over T2\u2019s belly, slowly, using just enough pressure.</p><p>T2 huffed his cheeks out, trying to stop the upcoming wave of laughter. He tried to catch Steves hands with his, but he was severely outnumbered. In the privacy of their home he would be extremely delighted, but being tickled in public was something that made him feel very vulnerable. His breath was becoming shorter, and any second he felt that he would burst into laughter and probably die of embarrassment -</p><p>\u201cMr. Rhodes! James Rhodes!\u201d came a voice calling the next patient.</p><p>Hearing the pilot\u2019s name, Steves stopped the teasing touches and T2 jumped out of his seat, escaping from intrusive hands, taking in some deep, calming breaths.</p><p>\u201cRhodey is here?\u201d Steve asked, looking around the waiting room, but not seeing any familiar faces.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see him,\u201d S2 drew his eyebrows together. Strange. If Rhodey was back in the country, wouldn\u2019t he inform Tony? \u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d he called, seeing that Tony moved forward and away from them.</p><p>\u201cI was called,\u201d T2 explained, turning around to face his boyfriends, smiling in humor at the confused faces, \u201cwell, I couldn\u2019t give them my real name, right?\u201d he explained with a laugh, walking through the door he was pointed to and closing them behind himself. Safe. Safe from teasing and fingers wiggling against his skin. There was still some tingling around his waist, and he felt his face cooling down. That was an embarrassing experience.</p><p>\u201cMr. Rhodes, please sit down.\u201d</p><p>T2\u2019s blood turned cold. He was so focused on getting away, that he didn\u2019t notice that he willingly walked into a much worse situation. Much, much worse.</p><p>When the door leading to the dentist\u2019s office flung open and T2 screamed \u2019<i>GET IN HERE!</i>\u2019 in sheer panic, Steves didn\u2019t question it, just sprinted inside the room.</p><p>***</p><p>Tony glanced at the hour displayed on his phone. Why it was taking so long? He saw people walking out of the clinic, but no luck with his partners. He was getting bored and if he knew that it would take so long he would take his tablet - and then a nasty thought appeared in his mind, causing him to become nervous.</p><p>What was happening in there that T2\u2019s appointment was taking so long? Maybe it wasn\u2019t just an ordinary toothache, able to fix during one visit. Maybe the problem ran deeper, happening in the roots, maybe even deeper in the bones of the jaw -</p><p>Bones. Bones cracking with a sickening, almost unreal sound but so vivid in his head.</p><p>\u201cWait-\u201d Tony gasped to himself, his mind bringing memories from the past he thought he had pushed deep into his subconsciousness. \u201cNo-\u201d</p><p>Remove the bones. Remove the flesh. A sound of dull tools. Deeper and deeper, drilling into him.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Tony closed his eyes, pain flooding his brain and making his muscles ache. He didn\u2019t realize but he pressed a hand to his chest, just in the middle. It felt like bones, but it was all fake. Just the pain was real.</p><p>Cold weight smothering him. Blood spilling. Screaming. Someone was screaming. Soon he realized that it was his own screaming. Way in the past, in the darkness, struggling to breathe on a makeshift operating table in a cave.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Tony yelled, bending in half and covering his ears, trying to mute out the sound of metal, the screaming, the whirring of electric machines.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cI think it went well,\u201d S2 praised.</p><p>\u201cYou did good,\u201d S1 praised more, leaning in to place a kiss on top of T2\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cMhhhhmm,\u201d T2 whined quietly, the anesthesia in his jaw numbing his gums and tongue and making his speech a bit drawled out. It would soon pass, but for the time being, he preferred not to talk and just held Steves hands as the three of them left the dentist\u2019s office. He felt really tired after all this stress, but at least he would be able to sleep tonight, without being woken up by the pain every hour or so. They could go back home.</p><p>The three of them walked down the corridor when something caught S1\u2019s attention. In the kids\u2019 corner, sat at a small plastic, round table on bright, yellow puff was Tony, surrounded by kids and their mothers. He was holding a red crayon in his hand and drawing something on paper, kids making their way to look at it, while Tony was chatting with the mothers and with the kids, all at the same time. It was somehow heartwarming to see.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Steve called, and Tony turned around, smiling at the three of them. He excused himself and said goodbye to the kids, taking the piece of paper from the table and skipping to his lovers.</p><p>\u201cHey! Why it was taking so long? You okay?\u201d he asked, looking from one person to the other, but finally stopping on T2\u2019s shocked face.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, but what - what are you doing here?\u201d S1 asked, sounding pleasantly surprised. The smile was dulled, when he noticed that Tony looked a bit pale and his lower lip was trembling.</p><p>\u201cI was getting worried. You were gone for a long time,\u201d T1 said, looking at S2 for a change. \u201cIs Tony okay?\u201d he asked, alarmed by his counterpart\u2019s stillness and quietness.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d S2 confirmed, sounding a bit in shock himself with seeing T1, \u201cjust had some bad cavity between his molars, but it is fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d T1 grimaced involuntarily. That had to involve a lot of work. \u201cOh, I have something for you,\u201d he said, lifting the piece of paper and focusing back on T2. \u201cOne of the kids advised I make it for you,\u201d he smiled, somehow clumsily, letting them see what was on the paper. In red and yellow crayon was something they could only describe as a stick figure in Iron Man colors. It was signed with a \u2018get well soon!\u2019 in Tony\u2019s chaotic print. \u201cI know it is not that great, and Steves could draw something more beautiful for you -\u201d</p><p>T2 kept looking at the picture, feeling some warm emotions brewing in him. He loosened the hold with Steves\u2019 hands and instead hugged Tony, embracing him with all the strength he had left.</p><p>\u201cOof,\u201d T1 grunted at the bear hug but hugged back. \u201cGlad you like it,\u201d he laughed in humor. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Steves exchanged warm looks, when both Tonys turned around and walked out of the clinic, the two of them following. There would come a time, Steve would ask Tony about this day and what exactly made him leave the car, but for the time being, he decided to stay quiet.</p><p>***</p><p>The ride back home was much more cheerful and in a merrier atmosphere. The anesthesia was slowly wearing off, and except some numb feeling and pain when he clinked his teeth too strong together, T2 was feeling fine and was ready to take a part in the ongoing discussion. And boy, he wanted to take part in it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Tony called loudly in disbelief. \u201cYou went easy on him!\u201d he accused after hearing how S2 and T2 had been playing with Steve a few nights ago.</p><p>\u201cWe still had to work harder on him. He is tougher than you are,\u201d S2 replied in a teasing voice, trading places with S1 and riding them back home. S1 grinned proudly after hearing the comment. It wasn\u2019t exactly a praise, but he would take it.</p><p>\u201cNo blindfold, no ink brush, no two toothbrushes!\u201d Tony listed all things that were used on him, but not on his fiance, sounding angry. \u201cNot fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you still enjoyed it, right?\u201d S2 asked, looking at Tony\u2019s reflection in the rear-view mirror, seeing his pouting face. \u201cBesides, we had to blindfold you, otherwise you would come in seconds and that would end our evening quickly.\u201d</p><p>Tony groaned in embarrassment, while T2 chuckled quietly. Not their fault that being tied down and teased and having their belly buttons played with was always a big turn on for them both.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I thought I took two toothbrushes with me,\u201d T2 said, frowning at the memory. Using one toothbrush on Steve was already rewarding, but imagine the possibilities if he had two.</p><p>\u201cYou know, me too,\u201d S2 agreed, sure that his lover took two. Maybe his memory was a bit wonky on that.</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Steve laughed, pointing attention to himself and smirking proudly, \u201cjust when you were handcuffing me to the bed, I kicked the second toothbrush down. It is probably still under our bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheater!\u201d</p><p>At Tonys loud whining, both Steves laughed. Just from two different reasons.</p><p>\u201cI guess that means we now have to repeat everything. All three of us. Right, guys?\u201d S2 asked, hearing Tonys agreeing with him from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d S1 grinned, sporting a different point of view. \u201cAnd when it will be finally your turn, huh?\u201d he asked the other him, seeing a nervous muscle jump in S2\u2019s jaw. Steve grinned wider and turned to Tonys. \u201cWhat do you say that instead of getting me, I will help you get S2?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer, but the car suddenly became really, really quiet and there were some tension and planning in the air. Involuntarily, S2 started to slow down, prolonging their way back home, feeling three intense stares on himself.</p><p>***</p><p>S2 could feel it. They were following him, not letting eyes off of him. And he barely walked inside the house and just took his shoes off. Maybe if he kept ignoring them, they would go away.</p><p>\u201cYou had to put it in their heads?!\u201d S2 groaned, noticing Steve making his way past him.</p><p>Steve blinked and smiled innocently. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You chicken?\u201d he asked, showing all teeth in a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cNo, just -\u201d S2 started, sitting on the couch. As soon as he did that, Tonys jumped to him, sitting on opposite sides and having him between. Steve couldn\u2019t help but to laugh at the nervous jump the other him did, his blue eyes widening almost comically as he looked from one Tony to the other.</p><p>\u201cSo, you ready?\u201d T1 asked enthusiastically, firm on going with the plan.</p><p>\u201cYou know, that will really make me feel better,\u201d T2 decided to go with the innocent card, trying to use his bad day as an excuse.</p><p>Slowly, S2 was giving up. He knew that both Starks could be stubborn and maybe the sooner this experience would be behind him, the better. For sure, he wouldn\u2019t stand the tension with both Tonys following him everywhere and planning a surprise attack.</p><p>\u201cI will regret this, right?\u201d S2 asked, meeting S1\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cWe will see,\u201d S1 replied with a laugh. Totally unhelpful.</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d S2 agreed, leaning into the couch and putting arms on the backrest, leaving his torso exposed. \u201cDo your worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act as if it is a punishment,\u201d T2 scolded his boyfriend, not appreciating the dramatic attitude. He was supposed to be the dramatic half in this relationship.</p><p>\u201cYeah, think of it as a bonding experience,\u201d T1 added, being the first one who reached to S2\u2019s side and softly wiggled his fingertips over the flank.</p><p>The reaction wasn\u2019t instant, and S2 remained still, an only small twitch of his lips giving him away. He won\u2019t go down easily.</p><p>\u201cOh, you want to play it tough?\u201d T1 asked, keeping the touch slow and just brushing his fingertips. Up and down.</p><p>\u201cHe always wants to play it tough,\u201d T2 confirmed, repeating the same kind of touch, just on the side closer to him. \u201cHe is just mean like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like a challenge. We will have fun with you,\u201d T1 said in a pleasant voice, scooting in closer and placing a scratchy kiss on S2\u2019s neck. That got them a better reaction and some muffled sound as the blond scrunched his shoulders up.</p><p>\u201cOh, good idea,\u201d T2 brightened and moved closer too, placing his kiss on S2\u2019s ear. More curling and another held back sound, that did resemble a giggle.</p><p>\u201cCome on. We know you want to laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be easier if you do.\u201d</p><p>S2 was breathing heavily, his chest heaving. He didn\u2019t want to give Tonys satisfaction. Not when two hands traced his abdomen muscles, not when ten fingers wriggled against his ribs, digging in softly into the spaces between the bones. It wasn\u2019t immediate gratification like with Tonys, where all it took was a wiggle of fingers an inch away from the ticklish spot and that was enough to have them giggling helplessly, or like with Steve who was more open and relaxed when it came to tickling and didn\u2019t hold back. S2 felt better in a ler role, but maybe being a lee for once won\u2019t be bad. Tonys looked like having fun, testing him and trying to make him crack.</p><p>\u201cHA!\u201d S2 tossed his head back, and it was the loudest sound from his so far, when hands grazed the top of his thighs, leaving a tingly feeling behind. \u201cOh, my g-gosh\u2026\u201d S2 grunted out when nails were involved and it became particularly bad when he felt light brushing around his kneecaps. Maybe he wasn\u2019t laughing yet, but the spasming of the muscles told Tonys enough.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get to tickle him here often enough,\u201d T2 smiled, using both hands to draw light patterns into the thigh closer to him.</p><p>\u201cMe neither with my Steve,\u201d Tony replied casually, using his fingertips to brush the thigh on his side. \u201cWe should get them side by side and test which one has more ticklish spots!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two forgot that I am here?\u201d Steve asked, lifting his eyes up for a second from the sketchbook. He decided to stick around and sat on the armchair, sketching the special moment between his lovers into his notebook. S2 trying to hold back, Tonys\u2019s mischievous smile - it would be a good drawing.</p><p>\u201cWe never said when,\u201d T1 grinned.</p><p>\u201cSo beware,\u201d T2 added with an identical grin.</p><p>\u201cI will sleep with one eye open,\u201d Steve decided to humor his boyfriends, eyes focusing back on the drawing.</p><p>\u201cHA-HA!\u201d</p><p>The sound made him stop temporarily. Figures. It was expected that from thigh tickling Tonys would soon move up to the hips, and Steve knew how sensitive that area was. Just watching Tonys lightly pushing their fingers into the joint, already made his skin crawl. Both brunets were clearly delighted with watching T2 huffing his cheeks out and trying not to laugh and decided to focus on that spot for a while. It wasn\u2019t until T2 started to squeeze the hip between his thumb and pointer finger when S2 finally cracked.</p><p>\u201cPHHH-HAHAHA!\u201d</p><p>Before Tonys could properly gloat because of breaking the soldier, S2 yanked his hands back to himself and wrapped around both Tonys, drawing them close.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough for today!\u201d S2 decided, voice cracking with laughter. There was even more laughter, but not from him, when he pinned his fingers into brunets\u2019s sides, tickling wild. Seemed that S2\u2019s reaction to tickling was to retaliate, while Tonys curled in his lap and started to laugh their hearts out. Steve felt like laughing too, deciding that he already had a good outline of the previous scene and turned the page to a clean one, having a new picture to sketch.</p><p>\u201cWait-wait-ahahaha! Steheheve!\u201d T2 called, trying to wriggle away from the tickling hand, but S2 was holding him good. \u201cI cahahahan\u2019t laugh! Hurts!\u201d he continued to protest and giggle, meaning his still hurting jaw. Laughing made him clink his teeth together abruptly, and it wasn\u2019t good for his freshly made dental filling. After hearing the words, S2 let go of his Tony, keeping his other hand buried into T1\u2019s side. T2, being the helpful one, decided to team up with his boyfriend and reached over for T1, yanking on his hands and making him fall into S2\u2019s lap, belly first.</p><p>S2 grinned, wide and delighted, receiving such a nice present. \u201cThanks, babe,\u201d he said, meaning T2, using both hands to scratch over T1\u2019s back and sides.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d T2 chirped happily, enjoying his counterpart\u2019s panicked shrills and a lot of kicking.</p><p>\u201cThe heheheheck! Stahahap ihihiht!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I can stop it on your back, but you will turn and give me your tummy,\u201d S2 bargained, wriggling his fingers along the spine, paying a lot of attention to the patch of skin just above Tony\u2019s bubble butt.</p><p>\u201cN-no ahahaha!\u201d Tony called in panic, managing to push himself up, and trying to crawl away. S2 followed immediately after him, and pinned him down to the couch with his body, despite the screaming, screaming soon changing into laughter when S2\u2019s hands were back on him, squeezing his sides and lips nuzzling into his neck. T2 giggled sweetly but decided to not get involved anymore and sat in the far corner of the couch. Steve would love to continue to sketch, putting his memories on paper to have them for longer, but then he looked at T2, feeling that it wasn\u2019t fair to leave him like that, while his Tony was getting his dose of affection. Sketching could wait.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Steve said, plopping down on the couch next to the brunet and pulling him into himself.</p><p>\u201cNo! Steve, no!\u201d T2 protested, curling and already batting on S1\u2019s hands on his tummy, \u201cI really can\u2019t laugh!\u201d he reminded, but he was already smiling and laughing. Just a cute reaction he and Tony shared when they were threatened with tickling.</p><p>\u201cI will be gentle. Promise,\u201d Steve said, meaning it and thinking that T2 deserved some sweet time for himself after the exhausting day.</p><p>\u201cO-okay\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ah, there it was. Whole palms pressed to his skin and rubbing circles into his belly. A perfectly measured pressure, one that told his brain that he was getting a massage and there was no need to run, but also the one that tingled his skin with ticklish sensations. S2 had tried, but so far he wasn\u2019t able to achieve that perfect balance and his touch ended ticklish more often than not. Once it would be over, T2 would have to talk with S1 about giving his boyfriend some pointers.</p><p>\u201cHey, watch this,\u201d there was a whisper in his ear and T2 fluttered his eyes open, not really knowing when they closed from utter delight. He saw S1\u2019s foot inching closer to where his Steve was still tickling T1 and the two of them were making a lot of noise. T2 watched through half-lidded eyes and what happened made his dreamy smile much wider. Using his toes, S1 started to tickle S2\u2019s socked sole, right away causing him to laugh and jerk his foot.</p><p>\u201cSTAHAHP IHIT!\u201d S2 called in protest, torn between fully collapsing on Tony in a ticklish heap, and continuing to get the other Tony. \u201cWhoeheheher is doing thahaht STAHAP!\u201d he demanded, trying to tug his tickled foot underneath himself.</p><p>S1 and T2 laughed, the sound getting lost in T1 and S2\u2019s louder laughter, but Steve complied. It was supposed to be just a short break and the main prize was in his lap. He continued the tummy rub, feeling T2 melting in his arms and listening to his Tony\u2019s panicked laughter.</p><p>Until\u2026</p><p>\u201cACHOO!\u201d</p><p>The laughter stopped and Steve stilled his hand, blinking at the man in his lap. T2 sniffled and wrinkled his nose, feeling another itch.</p><p>\u201cUh oh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh-choo!\u201d</p><p>S2 jumped away when this time it was Tony who sneezed, not as strongly as T2 did, but still. Tony looked surprised himself, his eyes widening.</p><p>Steves exchanged worried looks. Seemed that while they averted one crisis, a new one started. <br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/180700178794/double-trouble-reunion-part-8\">&lt;\u2013</a> previous part // next part <a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/182609719634/double-trouble-reunion-part-10\">\u2014&gt;\u00a0</a></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br></p><p><b>OPENING A TAG LIST FOR DTR!</b> If you want to be noted about updates for this series, leave a comment below or send me an ask!

Dammit. Was he too loud? He got so caught up in his project that he forgot he wasn&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>With big eyes, T2 noticed that everyone was looking at him, concerned by the pained yelp from seconds ago. T1 paused his work, furrowing his eyebrows, some car grease stain on his cheek and already crazy hair from rubbing the strands in frustration. Steves had been sitting the old couch in the corner, S1 keeping his book open but not following the text focused on T2, while his Steve still had a pencil pressed to his sketchbook but didn&rsquo;t continue, just like S1 sending him a calculating look.</p><p>&ldquo;What- Nothing is wrong,&rdquo; T2 replied immediately, trying to shrug the problem off.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you holding your hand pressed to your right cheek?&rdquo; T1 asked, squinting more at him.</p><p>Nice. T2 immediately lowered his hand, realizing that he was giving himself away. Smooth.</p><p>&ldquo;Helps me think,&rdquo; more lies. &ldquo;It is a quirk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it is not,&rdquo; Steve said loudly from the couch. &ldquo;You both stick out tongues while working, that is your quirk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People change, okay?&rdquo; T2 exclaimed impatiently. Why they were still on this topic? He was perfectly fine. Fine fine fine.</p><p>&ldquo;Babe, do your teeth hurt?&rdquo; S2 asked, not breaking eye contact with his boyfriend.</p><p>Another twitch. That was pretty confirmative. Damn his Steve for reading him so fast.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so that is why you were chewing only with your left side of the jaw today,&rdquo; Tony said, pointing to the left side of his own face.</p><p>&ldquo;And you asked me for an ice pack, saying that your head hurt,&rdquo; Steve continued.</p><p>T2&rsquo;s mouth opened in surprise. Seemed that his Steve wasn&rsquo;t the only one who could read his behavior correctly. Still, he needed to deny everything. &ldquo;Teeth are technically head area, so I wasn&rsquo;t really lying-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have to go to the dentist,&rdquo; S2 ended the discussion.</p><p>Another twitch. This time the twitch was followed by a sudden turn and running out of the workshop in panic. Steves were faster, but Tony was closer and he was the one who leaped first to the escaping brunet, holding him back.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah ah ah!&rdquo; Tony tugged the other him closer, ignoring the whining and struggling. &ldquo;Why are you running?&rdquo; Tony asked, trying to sound innocent and failing, an evilly gleeful smile giving him away. Jerk.</p><p>&ldquo;You know why,&rdquo; T2 grunted, trying to push himself away from the other him. Despite everything, Tony had some good upper body strength, and T2 was struggling.</p><p>&ldquo;I really have no idea-&rdquo;</p><p>A loud sigh, when Steves walked the distance and stood near their boyfriends. Enough of this.</p><p>&ldquo;I am guessing your Tony is afraid of the dentist too?&rdquo; Steve asked the other him, sounding somehow tired.</p><p>&ldquo;Terrified,&rdquo; S2 confirmed, and both Tonys voiced out their protests at being humiliated like that. Tony let his guard down and got elbowed by T2, who leaped to his Steve for protection. &ldquo;Hey, you are fine, babe,&rdquo; S2 said, wrapping arms around his boyfriend when T2 crashed into his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna go,&rdquo; T2 said, doing his best wounded doe impression and trembling. His Steve was kind. He won&rsquo;t let them hurt him.</p><p>&ldquo;Too bad, you are going,&rdquo; S2 said, sounding sorry but firm. It was the only way.</p><p>Immediately, T2 pushed himself away and took a step in Steve&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Steve-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Steve said, sounding even firmer than S2. T2 stopped in his tracks. All three of them betrayed him.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big deal, anyway?&rdquo; Tony made a comment, shrugging his arms. &ldquo;I will just call my dentist and we will zip over to New York for a quick check-up-&rdquo;</p><p>T2 wrapped arms around himself, feeling betrayed and abandoned. He really, really didn&rsquo;t want to go.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo; S2 wrapped an arm around his boyfriend and pulled him, placing a reassuring kiss on the top of his head. Tony was blowing this situation way out of proportions. &ldquo;Maybe it is just your wisdom teeth coming out, but we still have to check it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T2 doesn&rsquo;t have wisdom teeth?&rdquo; Steve asked, and Tony stopped with a phone in his hand, just about to make an appointment.</p><p>&ldquo;No, they never came out,&rdquo; S2 answered, looking puzzled at the other couple.</p><p>Steve and Tony exchanged worried looks.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we have a problem,&rdquo; Tony said, putting his phone away.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony already had his wisdom teeth removed. All four of them,&rdquo; Steve said, cringing at the memory of that day. It wasn&rsquo;t a fun experience for neither Tony or Steve. &ldquo;As for someone who has such a big mouth, his jaw couldn&rsquo;t fit four extra teeth,&rdquo; he tried to joke to loosen the atmosphere, but only Tony laughed, while S2 cracked a smile and T2 didn&rsquo;t react at all, busy with hiding into his boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess we have to call some clinic here and make an emergency appointment,&rdquo; Tony decided, asking Friday to find a one and book a visit today.</p><p>T2 lifted his head up, hearing the news. He was supposed to go to an unknown dentist who didn&rsquo;t have any of his dental records and just trust them like that?</p><p>Heck no.</p><p>&ldquo;Ow, Tony!&rdquo; S2 called in protest when without any warning T2 tried to claw his way out of his arms and run to freedom. Maybe to Canada.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;You will be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 sniffled, hearing the words being repeated time after time. He was in the backseat with T1 who kept holding his hand and caressing his knuckles with a thumb in hopes of calming him down. Steves were in the front, S1 driving, orientating himself better around California. If T2 had to go to the dentist, he made sure everyone would accompany him. Except for T2&rsquo;s comforting and his quiet sniffling, the ride was pretty quiet, until they reached their destination.</p><p>&ldquo;We are here,&rdquo; Steve said, parking the car in front of the clinic. It was one of the newest kind, promising quick service, even for most complicated procedures and zero pain.</p><p>T2 glanced up, seeing the white building and neon with the clinic&rsquo;s name. He lowered his head down again and didn&rsquo;t move while Steves got out of the car and T1 unbuckled their seat belts. The door opened from his side, and T2 remained still.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; S2 said, taking T2&rsquo;s hand and gently pulling him out. Before he could do that, Tony scooted closer and placed a kiss on T2&rsquo;s temple.</p><p>&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; T1 said with a smile and T2 widened his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not going with us?&rdquo; Steve asked, frowning at his boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it would be suspicious if we walk in there, looking like clones? It is enough that you two look the same,&rdquo; Tony made an excuse, pointing from Steve to Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Steve quickly protested, safely hidden under sunglasses and a baseball cap on his head, while S2 pulled a hoodie over his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s not a very good disguise,&rdquo; Tony pointed out, crossing his legs with a grin. &ldquo;I am gonna wait for you all here,&rdquo; he decided, waving goodbye to them.</p><p>S2 pursed his lips but didn&rsquo;t say anything, managing to take T2 out of the car, who was still looking with wide, betrayed eyes at his counterpart. When they stepped away, Steve leaned in, looking irritated.</p><p>&ldquo;We will discuss this later, Tony,&rdquo; he hissed, closing the door.</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t seem affected. He watched the three of them walking into the clinic and when the coast was clear, he curled and wrapped arms around himself, letting out a long time held in shudder.</p><p>There was no way he was going in there. Godspeed, T2.</p><p>***</p><p>The waiting room was bright and inviting, with many chairs, magazines and even some corner for kids with paper and crayons. T2 was handed a form he had filled in in silence and then a receptionist collected it from him, asking the three of them to wait. They were sitting under a wall, away from everyone else waiting, Tony between Steves. He was looking cautiously from one patient to the other, seeing calm faces and nothing like his worried one. The time was flying and soon they reached an hour mark of waiting, and while T2 barely said anything during that time, Steves kept talking as if trying to fill in for him.</p><p>&ldquo;This clinic has great reviews-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will go really fast, Tony, promise-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are in good hands-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to go to the bathroom,&rdquo; T2 said, spotting the door around the corner and standing up.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Just come back soon, we don&rsquo;t know when it will be your turn.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 nodded and started walking. After a few steps and a quick exchange behind his back, he heard someone standing up and walking behind him. T2 turned around and saw S1.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to go to the bathroom too?&rdquo; T2 asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; S1 replied, smiling broadly. &ldquo;Just making sure you won&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am already here, why would I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony once tried to squeeze out through the bathroom window. I am not taking any chances for that to happen with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Plan failed. Still, he had to roll with it.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not planning to - stop it!&rdquo; T2 ordered, resuming walking and seeing S1 closely following. &ldquo;I said stop it! Steve, tell him to not follow me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead and follow him,&rdquo; S2 said calmly, reaching for one of the colorful magazines.</p><p>&ldquo;No! I - Steve!&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t embarrassing at all when T2 started running, S1 right after him, until T2 true to his words zoomed into the bathroom and closed the door with a loud bang.</p><p>***</p><p>Just a little bit more. Come on. Almost -</p><p>Who was he kidding.</p><p>T2 wriggled away from the window with an impatient huff. There was no way he could squeeze through it. He could put out his arm or leg, but not the rest of his body. Windows were probably designed to not let any kids escape. Little snots. If the window was any bigger, he could escape easily, but because the clinic was childproofed, he was stuck. It didn&rsquo;t help that through the window he could see their car, knowing that T1 was inside, safe and without any worries. Bastard would pay for leaving him with those harpies.</p><p>Giving up, T2 washed his hands and made a face at himself in the mirror. He stretched his lips and tried to take a look inside his mouth wondering what was happening, but besides an exploding pain in his lower jaw, he couldn&rsquo;t say. His teeth looked fine, clean and sparkling. If something was happening it had to be in the roots or in the gums. Great.</p><p>T2 peaked his head out of the bathroom and narrowed his eyes at S1 standing leaned over a wall, waiting for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you still here?&rdquo; T2 asked, sounding offended.</p><p>Non taken and S1 only smiled. &ldquo;Come on. Your turn isn&rsquo;t yet, but S2 is working on that.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony frowned at the words and as they began to walk back to their seats. He saw his Steve leaning over the counter and conversing with a receptionist, a different one than the one that handed him the form. Much younger and flintier. T2 didn&rsquo;t like S2&rsquo;s smile even a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is he flirting?&rdquo; Tony asked, stopping halfway and staring at his fiance.</p><p>&ldquo;He is?&rdquo; Steve asked back, also looking at S2. Huh. The other him seemed relaxed and was smiling charmingly, giving all his attention to the receptionist who was smiling and laughing a bit too much as for a professional conversation. So, that&rsquo;s how he looked while flirting&hellip; &ldquo;I am sure he is not, he is just trying to bump you in the line,&rdquo; he said, remembering S2&rsquo;s mouthed out words while he was standing and looking after T2.</p><p>&ldquo;He is flirting,&rdquo; T2 said, sounding indignant. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he grabbed S1&rsquo;s hand and changed the direction, going to the reception desk, planning to give his boyfriend a piece of his mind. He was stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; S1 shook his head, and took T2 by the arms instead, sitting him down on a nearby chair. &ldquo;You are staying here and I will get S2.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?!&rdquo; T2 called after Steve, fingers curling into fists out of frustration.</p><p>&ldquo;Too close to the door, not risking it!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony just sunk into the chair, his irritation level rising. The pulsating pain in his lower jaw was not helping either. He didn&rsquo;t hear much of the conversation when S1 walked closer and S2 straightened up and they exchanged some words, but he saw clearly as the receptionist looked from one sexy blond to the other sexy blond and brightened even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you guys twins?&rdquo; she asked, purring out the words, and batting her long eyelashes.</p><p>That did it.</p><p>T2 leaped half of the room and just as S1 blushed, and S2 opened his mouth to confirm or deny or whatever he planned, T2 stood between both of them and wrapped each arm around Steves&rsquo; necks, pulling them closer to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;No, they are not,&rdquo; T2 said in a sunny voice, smiling beautifully, despite the aching pain. &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t they both gorgeous? I am up for some nice threesome action today,&rdquo; he said, ignoring that S1 stiffened in panic, while S2 was clearly uncomfortable too, just not so visibly as the other him.</p><p>The receptionist instead of being taken aback by such blatant display, brightened ever more, eyeing Tony up and down. She crossed palms under her chin and leaned in closer. &ldquo;Maybe even some foursome,&rdquo; she purred back.</p><p>For a second, T2&rsquo;s face gave away how the unexpected offer surprised him, but soon it morphed into his trained charming smile and faked laughter, which to an unskilled eye looked very real and honest. &ldquo;Yeah, maybe,&rdquo; he decided on behalf of three of them and added even a small wink. He turned around with flustered Steves, walking back to their seats. &ldquo;I forgot this was California&hellip;&rdquo; he grunted quietly, so only Steves could hear him. That got uncomfortable very quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell were you doing?&rdquo; S2 demanded answers in a quiet voice when all of them sat down.</p><p>&ldquo;And what were you doing?&rdquo; T2 hissed back, eyes narrowing in anger. &ldquo;I just walked away for few minutes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, I was just trying to quicken your appointment!&rdquo; S2 hissed back, both men turned to each other, faces just inches apart.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sure, you seemed like having a ton of fun while doing that -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Guys, calm down,&rdquo; Steve said, putting his hand on T2&rsquo;s shoulder and pushing him to the back. They were waiting already for nearly two hours, despite having an appointment, it was getting on everyone&rsquo;s nerves. &ldquo;Taking your frustration on each other won&rsquo;t resolve anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Both T2 and S2 eyed each other for a while longer, before their gazes softened. It was true, and the pain was dulling T2&rsquo;s mind and he was becoming increasingly irritated, while S2 felt hopeless, not able to ease his lover&rsquo;s pain. &nbsp;It was a tough situation for all of them.</p><p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; T2 admitted. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said to S2, knowing that in no world Steve would flirt with someone else and mean it. Well, maybe except T1 and S1.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry too,&rdquo; S2 said, corners of his lips turning down as he gently cupped Tony&rsquo;s face, the side where the pain was located. He was really sorry he couldn&rsquo;t relieve the pain and he hated to see his boyfriend suffering and scared. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just hope it won&rsquo;t take much longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it won&rsquo;t, you are a charmer,&rdquo; T2 smiled, quickly nuzzling into S2&rsquo;s palm and kissing it. &ldquo;Unlike you, from what I heard,&rdquo; he turned to face Steve and booped him on the nose.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T1 told me. He said you were fumbling a lot before you gathered the courage to ask him out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; S2 grinned, that annoying, smug grin, Steve disliked so much as he leaned over his Tony&rsquo;s back and put his chin on his shoulder. &ldquo;Tell me more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, I bet you had the same problems as I did,&rdquo; Steve grunted, not liking the way both men were looking at him. Fine, he wasn&rsquo;t the master of flirting. But in the end, he was with Tony so he couldn&rsquo;t be that hopeless, right?</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; S2 shrugged, &ldquo;but might be also because my Tony is easy.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 scoffed and turned his head to look at his lover, mouth grimaced into a scowl and not because of pain. &ldquo;Did you just call me fucking easy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You kinda are,&rdquo; S2 said, winking to Steve, &ldquo;I just needed to touch you in the right place to make you all mine.&rdquo;</p><p>There it was. Five fingers brushing his side. T2 jerked and squealed in surprise and bumped into S1 to get away.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that kind of easy,&rdquo; S1 quickly caught on, repeating the slow movement, while S2 moved in closer, not leaving T2 enough space to move. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good kind of easy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No - you can&rsquo;t - nooo,&rdquo; T2 squirmed, trying to keep his voice down to not attract any attention to them, but four hands were already all over his waist and sneaking underneath his jacket to remain unnoticed. &ldquo;D - don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just be quiet and no one will see,&rdquo; S2 advised, rubbing small circles with his thumbs into T2&rsquo;s sides.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it can&rsquo;t be that bad, can it?&rdquo; S1 teased in a sweet voice, using his whole palms to glide over T2&rsquo;s belly, slowly, using just enough pressure.</p><p>T2 huffed his cheeks out, trying to stop the upcoming wave of laughter. He tried to catch Steves hands with his, but he was severely outnumbered. In the privacy of their home he would be extremely delighted, but being tickled in public was something that made him feel very vulnerable. His breath was becoming shorter, and any second he felt that he would burst into laughter and probably die of embarrassment -</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhodes! James Rhodes!&rdquo; came a voice calling the next patient.</p><p>Hearing the pilot&rsquo;s name, Steves stopped the teasing touches and T2 jumped out of his seat, escaping from intrusive hands, taking in some deep, calming breaths.</p><p>&ldquo;Rhodey is here?&rdquo; Steve asked, looking around the waiting room, but not seeing any familiar faces.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; S2 drew his eyebrows together. Strange. If Rhodey was back in the country, wouldn&rsquo;t he inform Tony? &ldquo;Hey, where are you going?&rdquo; he called, seeing that Tony moved forward and away from them.</p><p>&ldquo;I was called,&rdquo; T2 explained, turning around to face his boyfriends, smiling in humor at the confused faces, &ldquo;well, I couldn&rsquo;t give them my real name, right?&rdquo; he explained with a laugh, walking through the door he was pointed to and closing them behind himself. Safe. Safe from teasing and fingers wiggling against his skin. There was still some tingling around his waist, and he felt his face cooling down. That was an embarrassing experience.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhodes, please sit down.&rdquo;</p><p>T2&rsquo;s blood turned cold. He was so focused on getting away, that he didn&rsquo;t notice that he willingly walked into a much worse situation. Much, much worse.</p><p>When the door leading to the dentist&rsquo;s office flung open and T2 screamed &rsquo;<i>GET IN HERE!</i>&rsquo; in sheer panic, Steves didn&rsquo;t question it, just sprinted inside the room.</p><p>***</p><p>Tony glanced at the hour displayed on his phone. Why it was taking so long? He saw people walking out of the clinic, but no luck with his partners. He was getting bored and if he knew that it would take so long he would take his tablet - and then a nasty thought appeared in his mind, causing him to become nervous.</p><p>What was happening in there that T2&rsquo;s appointment was taking so long? Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t just an ordinary toothache, able to fix during one visit. Maybe the problem ran deeper, happening in the roots, maybe even deeper in the bones of the jaw -</p><p>Bones. Bones cracking with a sickening, almost unreal sound but so vivid in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait-&rdquo; Tony gasped to himself, his mind bringing memories from the past he thought he had pushed deep into his subconsciousness. &ldquo;No-&rdquo;</p><p>Remove the bones. Remove the flesh. A sound of dull tools. Deeper and deeper, drilling into him.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Tony closed his eyes, pain flooding his brain and making his muscles ache. He didn&rsquo;t realize but he pressed a hand to his chest, just in the middle. It felt like bones, but it was all fake. Just the pain was real.</p><p>Cold weight smothering him. Blood spilling. Screaming. Someone was screaming. Soon he realized that it was his own screaming. Way in the past, in the darkness, struggling to breathe on a makeshift operating table in a cave.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; Tony yelled, bending in half and covering his ears, trying to mute out the sound of metal, the screaming, the whirring of electric machines.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;I think it went well,&rdquo; S2 praised.</p><p>&ldquo;You did good,&rdquo; S1 praised more, leaning in to place a kiss on top of T2&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhhhhmm,&rdquo; T2 whined quietly, the anesthesia in his jaw numbing his gums and tongue and making his speech a bit drawled out. It would soon pass, but for the time being, he preferred not to talk and just held Steves hands as the three of them left the dentist&rsquo;s office. He felt really tired after all this stress, but at least he would be able to sleep tonight, without being woken up by the pain every hour or so. They could go back home.</p><p>The three of them walked down the corridor when something caught S1&rsquo;s attention. In the kids&rsquo; corner, sat at a small plastic, round table on bright, yellow puff was Tony, surrounded by kids and their mothers. He was holding a red crayon in his hand and drawing something on paper, kids making their way to look at it, while Tony was chatting with the mothers and with the kids, all at the same time. It was somehow heartwarming to see.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Steve called, and Tony turned around, smiling at the three of them. He excused himself and said goodbye to the kids, taking the piece of paper from the table and skipping to his lovers.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Why it was taking so long? You okay?&rdquo; he asked, looking from one person to the other, but finally stopping on T2&rsquo;s shocked face.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, yeah, but what - what are you doing here?&rdquo; S1 asked, sounding pleasantly surprised. The smile was dulled, when he noticed that Tony looked a bit pale and his lower lip was trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;I was getting worried. You were gone for a long time,&rdquo; T1 said, looking at S2 for a change. &ldquo;Is Tony okay?&rdquo; he asked, alarmed by his counterpart&rsquo;s stillness and quietness.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; S2 confirmed, sounding a bit in shock himself with seeing T1, &ldquo;just had some bad cavity between his molars, but it is fine now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ouch,&rdquo; T1 grimaced involuntarily. That had to involve a lot of work. &ldquo;Oh, I have something for you,&rdquo; he said, lifting the piece of paper and focusing back on T2. &ldquo;One of the kids advised I make it for you,&rdquo; he smiled, somehow clumsily, letting them see what was on the paper. In red and yellow crayon was something they could only describe as a stick figure in Iron Man colors. It was signed with a &lsquo;get well soon!&rsquo; in Tony&rsquo;s chaotic print. &ldquo;I know it is not that great, and Steves could draw something more beautiful for you -&rdquo;</p><p>T2 kept looking at the picture, feeling some warm emotions brewing in him. He loosened the hold with Steves&rsquo; hands and instead hugged Tony, embracing him with all the strength he had left.</p><p>&ldquo;Oof,&rdquo; T1 grunted at the bear hug but hugged back. &ldquo;Glad you like it,&rdquo; he laughed in humor. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p><p>Steves exchanged warm looks, when both Tonys turned around and walked out of the clinic, the two of them following. There would come a time, Steve would ask Tony about this day and what exactly made him leave the car, but for the time being, he decided to stay quiet.</p><p>***</p><p>The ride back home was much more cheerful and in a merrier atmosphere. The anesthesia was slowly wearing off, and except some numb feeling and pain when he clinked his teeth too strong together, T2 was feeling fine and was ready to take a part in the ongoing discussion. And boy, he wanted to take part in it.</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Tony called loudly in disbelief. &ldquo;You went easy on him!&rdquo; he accused after hearing how S2 and T2 had been playing with Steve a few nights ago.</p><p>&ldquo;We still had to work harder on him. He is tougher than you are,&rdquo; S2 replied in a teasing voice, trading places with S1 and riding them back home. S1 grinned proudly after hearing the comment. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly a praise, but he would take it.</p><p>&ldquo;No blindfold, no ink brush, no two toothbrushes!&rdquo; Tony listed all things that were used on him, but not on his fiance, sounding angry. &ldquo;Not fair!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you still enjoyed it, right?&rdquo; S2 asked, looking at Tony&rsquo;s reflection in the rear-view mirror, seeing his pouting face. &ldquo;Besides, we had to blindfold you, otherwise you would come in seconds and that would end our evening quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony groaned in embarrassment, while T2 chuckled quietly. Not their fault that being tied down and teased and having their belly buttons played with was always a big turn on for them both.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, I thought I took two toothbrushes with me,&rdquo; T2 said, frowning at the memory. Using one toothbrush on Steve was already rewarding, but imagine the possibilities if he had two.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, me too,&rdquo; S2 agreed, sure that his lover took two. Maybe his memory was a bit wonky on that.</p><p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; Steve laughed, pointing attention to himself and smirking proudly, &ldquo;just when you were handcuffing me to the bed, I kicked the second toothbrush down. It is probably still under our bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, come on!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cheater!&rdquo;</p><p>At Tonys loud whining, both Steves laughed. Just from two different reasons.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess that means we now have to repeat everything. All three of us. Right, guys?&rdquo; S2 asked, hearing Tonys agreeing with him from the backseat.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; S1 grinned, sporting a different point of view. &ldquo;And when it will be finally your turn, huh?&rdquo; he asked the other him, seeing a nervous muscle jump in S2&rsquo;s jaw. Steve grinned wider and turned to Tonys. &ldquo;What do you say that instead of getting me, I will help you get S2?&rdquo;</p><p>There was no answer, but the car suddenly became really, really quiet and there were some tension and planning in the air. Involuntarily, S2 started to slow down, prolonging their way back home, feeling three intense stares on himself.</p><p>***</p><p>S2 could feel it. They were following him, not letting eyes off of him. And he barely walked inside the house and just took his shoes off. Maybe if he kept ignoring them, they would go away.</p><p>&ldquo;You had to put it in their heads?!&rdquo; S2 groaned, noticing Steve making his way past him.</p><p>Steve blinked and smiled innocently. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You chicken?&rdquo; he asked, showing all teeth in a wide grin.</p><p>&ldquo;No, just -&rdquo; S2 started, sitting on the couch. As soon as he did that, Tonys jumped to him, sitting on opposite sides and having him between. Steve couldn&rsquo;t help but to laugh at the nervous jump the other him did, his blue eyes widening almost comically as he looked from one Tony to the other.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you ready?&rdquo; T1 asked enthusiastically, firm on going with the plan.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, that will really make me feel better,&rdquo; T2 decided to go with the innocent card, trying to use his bad day as an excuse.</p><p>Slowly, S2 was giving up. He knew that both Starks could be stubborn and maybe the sooner this experience would be behind him, the better. For sure, he wouldn&rsquo;t stand the tension with both Tonys following him everywhere and planning a surprise attack.</p><p>&ldquo;I will regret this, right?&rdquo; S2 asked, meeting S1&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;We will see,&rdquo; S1 replied with a laugh. Totally unhelpful.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay then,&rdquo; S2 agreed, leaning into the couch and putting arms on the backrest, leaving his torso exposed. &ldquo;Do your worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act as if it is a punishment,&rdquo; T2 scolded his boyfriend, not appreciating the dramatic attitude. He was supposed to be the dramatic half in this relationship.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, think of it as a bonding experience,&rdquo; T1 added, being the first one who reached to S2&rsquo;s side and softly wiggled his fingertips over the flank.</p><p>The reaction wasn&rsquo;t instant, and S2 remained still, an only small twitch of his lips giving him away. He won&rsquo;t go down easily.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you want to play it tough?&rdquo; T1 asked, keeping the touch slow and just brushing his fingertips. Up and down.</p><p>&ldquo;He always wants to play it tough,&rdquo; T2 confirmed, repeating the same kind of touch, just on the side closer to him. &ldquo;He is just mean like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like a challenge. We will have fun with you,&rdquo; T1 said in a pleasant voice, scooting in closer and placing a scratchy kiss on S2&rsquo;s neck. That got them a better reaction and some muffled sound as the blond scrunched his shoulders up.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good idea,&rdquo; T2 brightened and moved closer too, placing his kiss on S2&rsquo;s ear. More curling and another held back sound, that did resemble a giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on. We know you want to laugh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be easier if you do.&rdquo;</p><p>S2 was breathing heavily, his chest heaving. He didn&rsquo;t want to give Tonys satisfaction. Not when two hands traced his abdomen muscles, not when ten fingers wriggled against his ribs, digging in softly into the spaces between the bones. It wasn&rsquo;t immediate gratification like with Tonys, where all it took was a wiggle of fingers an inch away from the ticklish spot and that was enough to have them giggling helplessly, or like with Steve who was more open and relaxed when it came to tickling and didn&rsquo;t hold back. S2 felt better in a ler role, but maybe being a lee for once won&rsquo;t be bad. Tonys looked like having fun, testing him and trying to make him crack.</p><p>&ldquo;HA!&rdquo; S2 tossed his head back, and it was the loudest sound from his so far, when hands grazed the top of his thighs, leaving a tingly feeling behind. &ldquo;Oh, my g-gosh&hellip;&rdquo; S2 grunted out when nails were involved and it became particularly bad when he felt light brushing around his kneecaps. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t laughing yet, but the spasming of the muscles told Tonys enough.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get to tickle him here often enough,&rdquo; T2 smiled, using both hands to draw light patterns into the thigh closer to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Me neither with my Steve,&rdquo; Tony replied casually, using his fingertips to brush the thigh on his side. &ldquo;We should get them side by side and test which one has more ticklish spots!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You two forgot that I am here?&rdquo; Steve asked, lifting his eyes up for a second from the sketchbook. He decided to stick around and sat on the armchair, sketching the special moment between his lovers into his notebook. S2 trying to hold back, Tonys&rsquo;s mischievous smile - it would be a good drawing.</p><p>&ldquo;We never said when,&rdquo; T1 grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;So beware,&rdquo; T2 added with an identical grin.</p><p>&ldquo;I will sleep with one eye open,&rdquo; Steve decided to humor his boyfriends, eyes focusing back on the drawing.</p><p>&ldquo;HA-HA!&rdquo;</p><p>The sound made him stop temporarily. Figures. It was expected that from thigh tickling Tonys would soon move up to the hips, and Steve knew how sensitive that area was. Just watching Tonys lightly pushing their fingers into the joint, already made his skin crawl. Both brunets were clearly delighted with watching T2 huffing his cheeks out and trying not to laugh and decided to focus on that spot for a while. It wasn&rsquo;t until T2 started to squeeze the hip between his thumb and pointer finger when S2 finally cracked.</p><p>&ldquo;PHHH-HAHAHA!&rdquo;</p><p>Before Tonys could properly gloat because of breaking the soldier, S2 yanked his hands back to himself and wrapped around both Tonys, drawing them close.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for today!&rdquo; S2 decided, voice cracking with laughter. There was even more laughter, but not from him, when he pinned his fingers into brunets&rsquo;s sides, tickling wild. Seemed that S2&rsquo;s reaction to tickling was to retaliate, while Tonys curled in his lap and started to laugh their hearts out. Steve felt like laughing too, deciding that he already had a good outline of the previous scene and turned the page to a clean one, having a new picture to sketch.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait-wait-ahahaha! Steheheve!&rdquo; T2 called, trying to wriggle away from the tickling hand, but S2 was holding him good. &ldquo;I cahahahan&rsquo;t laugh! Hurts!&rdquo; he continued to protest and giggle, meaning his still hurting jaw. Laughing made him clink his teeth together abruptly, and it wasn&rsquo;t good for his freshly made dental filling. After hearing the words, S2 let go of his Tony, keeping his other hand buried into T1&rsquo;s side. T2, being the helpful one, decided to team up with his boyfriend and reached over for T1, yanking on his hands and making him fall into S2&rsquo;s lap, belly first.</p><p>S2 grinned, wide and delighted, receiving such a nice present. &ldquo;Thanks, babe,&rdquo; he said, meaning T2, using both hands to scratch over T1&rsquo;s back and sides.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; T2 chirped happily, enjoying his counterpart&rsquo;s panicked shrills and a lot of kicking.</p><p>&ldquo;The heheheheck! Stahahap ihihiht!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. I can stop it on your back, but you will turn and give me your tummy,&rdquo; S2 bargained, wriggling his fingers along the spine, paying a lot of attention to the patch of skin just above Tony&rsquo;s bubble butt.</p><p>&ldquo;N-no ahahaha!&rdquo; Tony called in panic, managing to push himself up, and trying to crawl away. S2 followed immediately after him, and pinned him down to the couch with his body, despite the screaming, screaming soon changing into laughter when S2&rsquo;s hands were back on him, squeezing his sides and lips nuzzling into his neck. T2 giggled sweetly but decided to not get involved anymore and sat in the far corner of the couch. Steve would love to continue to sketch, putting his memories on paper to have them for longer, but then he looked at T2, feeling that it wasn&rsquo;t fair to leave him like that, while his Tony was getting his dose of affection. Sketching could wait.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; Steve said, plopping down on the couch next to the brunet and pulling him into himself.</p><p>&ldquo;No! Steve, no!&rdquo; T2 protested, curling and already batting on S1&rsquo;s hands on his tummy, &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t laugh!&rdquo; he reminded, but he was already smiling and laughing. Just a cute reaction he and Tony shared when they were threatened with tickling.</p><p>&ldquo;I will be gentle. Promise,&rdquo; Steve said, meaning it and thinking that T2 deserved some sweet time for himself after the exhausting day.</p><p>&ldquo;O-okay&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Ah, there it was. Whole palms pressed to his skin and rubbing circles into his belly. A perfectly measured pressure, one that told his brain that he was getting a massage and there was no need to run, but also the one that tingled his skin with ticklish sensations. S2 had tried, but so far he wasn&rsquo;t able to achieve that perfect balance and his touch ended ticklish more often than not. Once it would be over, T2 would have to talk with S1 about giving his boyfriend some pointers.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, watch this,&rdquo; there was a whisper in his ear and T2 fluttered his eyes open, not really knowing when they closed from utter delight. He saw S1&rsquo;s foot inching closer to where his Steve was still tickling T1 and the two of them were making a lot of noise. T2 watched through half-lidded eyes and what happened made his dreamy smile much wider. Using his toes, S1 started to tickle S2&rsquo;s socked sole, right away causing him to laugh and jerk his foot.</p><p>&ldquo;STAHAHP IHIT!&rdquo; S2 called in protest, torn between fully collapsing on Tony in a ticklish heap, and continuing to get the other Tony. &ldquo;Whoeheheher is doing thahaht STAHAP!&rdquo; he demanded, trying to tug his tickled foot underneath himself.</p><p>S1 and T2 laughed, the sound getting lost in T1 and S2&rsquo;s louder laughter, but Steve complied. It was supposed to be just a short break and the main prize was in his lap. He continued the tummy rub, feeling T2 melting in his arms and listening to his Tony&rsquo;s panicked laughter.</p><p>Until&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;ACHOO!&rdquo;</p><p>The laughter stopped and Steve stilled his hand, blinking at the man in his lap. T2 sniffled and wrinkled his nose, feeling another itch.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh oh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ahh-choo!&rdquo;</p><p>S2 jumped away when this time it was Tony who sneezed, not as strongly as T2 did, but still. Tony looked surprised himself, his eyes widening.</p><p>Steves exchanged worried looks. Seemed that while they averted one crisis, a new one started. <br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/180700178794/double-trouble-reunion-part-8\">&lt;&ndash;</a> previous part // next part <a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/182609719634/double-trouble-reunion-part-10\">&mdash;&gt;&nbsp;</a></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br /></p><p><b>OPENING A TAG LIST FOR DTR!</b> If you want to be noted about updates for this series, leave a comment below or send me an ask!
