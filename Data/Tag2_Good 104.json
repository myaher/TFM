The sun was shining, the people were happy, and Anathema felt like everything and everyone hated her. First, her bus to the train station had been late, then she had missed her train, and then the strap of her bag had torn and everything had landed on the ground. The cupcake she had backed yesterday in a sheer endless battle in her kitchen had all but one landed on the ground.</p><p>Into a puddle, to make it even worse.</p><!-- more --><p>She had known that the day was going to be bad when she was getting dressed after her morning shower and the wire of her bra decided to poke its head out to get some fresh air.</p><p>She should have gone back to bed.</p><p>But no, here she was, trying to get a ticket for the Tube, struggling with a ticket machine which just didn\u2019t want to take her money.</p><p>Little did she know that the note was Scottish and not English and the ticket machine just hate the Scots.</p><p>She only admitted defeat to herself to buy an apple in the next best shop.</p><p>\u201cFinally some proper English money,\u201d thought the ticket machine as it was giving Anathema her ticket for her new money. \u201cStupid Scottish lass!\u201d But Anathema wasn\u2019t Scottish, only this one note was. The ticket machine didn\u2019t care. Every fleshling who had Scottish money was a Scot in its eyes.</p><p>Anathema\u2019s next struggle was the Tube itself. As someone who only came to London on an occasional visit, the system made no sense. It was overly complicated and to make it even worse, there were too many people knowing where they wanted to go. Anathema had no chance of stopping and checking if she was right. She had to follow the masses. She got into the wrong train. Well, it was the right train but in the wrong direction.</p><p>Once again, Anathema has reinforced her opinion that it was much better to live in Oxfordshire with a bike than in London with an Oyster Card.</p><p>Anathema hated every minute of her visit to London so far, but despite everything, she was getting where she wanted. It was a plain house in a plain <g class=\"gr_ gr_105 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"105\" data-gr-id=\"105\">neighbourhood</g>. Under normal circumstances, she\u2019d never have looked twice at the building, but today she was pressing on the doorbell. The door opened almost immediately and Anathema went to the lift, only to find it out of order. She almost cried as she was in front of the door on the fifth floor.</p><p>This really wasn\u2019t her day.</p><p>She rang the doorbell. Newt opened immediately. \u201cThere you are!\u201d He said as he hugged her. \u201cI already thought you got lost. You should really get a phone. Come in.\u201d Anathema smiled. \u201cWhy? I can\u2019t call you, you\u2019re always breaking your phones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting better. But come in!\u201d</p><p>Anathema followed Newt into his apartment. It was a nice apartment but that was it. A normal apartment which a quite normal and average man and his boyfriend shared.</p><p>Newt had known his boyfriend long before he had known Anathema. They had met at work, even though Newt was just a wages clerk (and witchfinder private on most afternoons) and Brian Potter was in accounting (and since recently witchfinder in training on most afternoons).</p><p>One day, Newt had called Anathema to inform her that he had realized that he was gay and was now officially in a relationship with a guy, he had no idea how this had happened himself, but they both were happy.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t had the time to meet up in person since, Newt having too much to do with his two jobs and Brian, Anathema with selling self-made witch stuff on the Internet and edit papers, and Sarah, her own lover she had found shortly after their breakup.</p><p>But they had always stayed in good contact. And it had been Newt\u2019s thirtieth birthday last week. It was finally time to meet up again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made some cupcakes for you as a present,\u201d Anathema said. \u201cBut there was an accident with my bag, and they fell into a puddle. All except one. But I ate it in my frustration, I have to admit. You won\u2019t believe what kind of day I had!\u201d</p><p>She told him.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I wouldn\u2019t mind picking you up in Tadfield,\u201d Newt told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s forty miles from here!\u201d Anathema insisted. Truth be told, she didn\u2019t like being in Newt\u2019s car. She trusted it only as far as she could throw it. Which she wasn\u2019t able to do at all, but she was able to knock it over to the side.</p><p>But, despite everything that had happened, she was here now and she couldn\u2019t deny that she enjoyed the rest of the day. Later, she couldn\u2019t tell who had the idea to go karaoke, but they had fun.</p><p>Newt sang the worst version of \u201cMy heart will go on\u201d by Celine Dion ever to be heard, while Anathema tried and failed singing \u201cI never meant to hurt you\u201d by Laura Nyro. Together they scared at least five people out of the karaoke bar by singing \u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart\u201d by Bonnie Tyler and with \u201cRasputin\u201d by Boney M., but they had fun together and that was the most important thing of all.</p>",

They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well&hellip;</p><!-- more --><p>&mdash;</p><p>It was a bright chilly morning in\nlower Tadfield. Adam was giving Dog one last pat down before cycling off to\nschool when he heard someone calling his name.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d</p><p>The boy turned, watching a\nharassed looking Aziraphale land at the foot of the driveway, wings out and\nmessy. The angel took a moment to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cHullo Aziraphale,\u201d he greeted\ncheerfully. \u201cHow\u2019s the dating going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s\u2014erm. Look.\u201d There was\nsomething desperate in his eyes. \u201cAbout this match. It\u2019s\u2026I don\u2019t. I really <i>really</i> don\u2019t think this will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s\n<i>Gabriel!</i> I can\u2019t\u2014this must be a joke,\nthere\u2019s no way I could have matched with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nyou did match with him,\u201d said Adam innocently.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014I\u2014I\ncan\u2019t have! He\u2019s awful. And have you seen what he <i>wears?</i>* Ghastly!\u201d The angel looked wretched at the thought of it.</p><p>*Gabriel\ndressed like he was on the cover of a glossy, highly conservative fashion\nmagazine featuring lean, muscular men in dull neutral-coloured business attire,\nand radiating an almost tangible air of <i>no\nhomo</i> in a mile radius around. It made Aziraphale want to clutch at his\nbright paisley bow-tie in horror.</p><p>Adam\ntook pity on him. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m sorry. You were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d</p><p>Adam\ngrinned sheepishly. \u201cJust wanted to see if you really didn\u2019t get along or if\nyou just liked fighting.\u201d Aziraphale gaped at him. \u201cI would have gone through\nwith it, but Gabriel\u2019s already come by to complain, and ugh. Yeah, I can see\nwhy you don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s a right tosser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh thank you. So, I don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo\nno. He\u2019s been matched with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nthank goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d\nAdam waved his hand. Aziraphale caught the pink booklet as it materialized and\nfluttered down towards him. \u201cThere\u2019s the real results. But you have to go with\nwhoever you get this time, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nyes of course,\u201d agreed Aziaphale, so relieved he would have agreed to just\nabout anything.</p><p>\u201cCheer\nup! Only two more to go!\u201d Adam picked up his bike and slung a leg over it,\nhoisting himself onto the seat.</p><p>\u201cRight.\nThank you, dear boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee\nyou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nwatched the boy turn onto the road and cycle off into the town.</p><p>He\nlet out a long breath, the new results of the quiz held in his hand.</p><p>Last\nnight he had dared to hope he would be matched with Crowley. The more he\nthought on it, the more he felt terribly foolish for not thinking of it before.\nOf <i>course</i> he should be matched with\nCrowley. Hadn\u2019t they already chosen each other, in so many little ways throughout all\ntheir long history together?</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas in love with him. </p><p>He\nhad never wanted for a romantic relationship because just being in Crowley\u2019s\ncompany had been everything he had wanted.</p><p>Or\nso he had thought.</p><p>But\nnow the subject had been brought up, now that romance and candles and such\nunspeakable intimacies as <i>hand holding</i>\nand <i>snuggling</i> had been brought into\nlight\u2026oh, to have <i>that</i> with Crowley?</p><p>It\nwas dizzying to think of how badly he wanted it.</p><p>The\ntrouble was, he wasn\u2019t sure if Crowley felt the same. He had\u2026something of a\nhunch. He dearly hoped he was correct and that he hadn\u2019t been reading his\ndearest friend wrong these last few days.</p><p>It\nwas absolutely ridiculous they hadn\u2019t matched before, come to think of it. He\nand Crowley were\u2026it just felt so <i>right</i>.\nSurely they would match now?</p><p>Aziraphale\nlooked down at the quiz.</p><p>Even\nif it wasn\u2019t Crowley, it couldn\u2019t be worse than Gabriel, he reasoned.</p><p>Then\nhe saw who he had matched with.</p><p>He\nspluttered.</p><p>Maybe,\njust maybe, it could be worse than Gabriel.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nlay face-down on his sofa, bemoaning his woes incoherently to his plants. His\nsoul music collection was blasting loud enough to shake the walls and disturb\nthe neighbors. As he didn\u2019t feel like having upset neighbours banging on\nhis door, they simply didn\u2019t hear it.</p><p>The\npink quiz lay crumpled on the floor where it had been banished some hours\nearlier.</p><p>He\nhadn\u2019t got Aziraphale.</p><p>Of\nbloody course he hadn\u2019t. That was just how things went, didn\u2019t they, he thought\nbitterly, in an uncharacteristic bout of pessimism. </p><p>The\nmore reasonable voice in his head (which sounded suspiciously like Aziraphale)\nsaid that of <i>course</i> he had Aziraphale\n(<i>dear boy</i>). They\u2019d had each other for\na very long time, hadn\u2019t they? </p><p>It\nwas just all this dating toss up had blown something loose, rattled up their\nold routine and put things properly in perspective.</p><p>He\nwas in love with Aziraphale. </p><p>Had\nbeen, likely, for centuries, millennia even, little by little, sauntering into it\nas gradually and as naturally as breathing*.</p><p>*Which wasn\u2019t natural at all to occult and ethereal beings. It was a choice, a habit they had picked up and adopted so thoroughly that stopping it felt <i>bad</i> and wrong instinctively.<br/></p><p>He\nhad good reason to believe it may be reciprocated.</p><p>What\nCrowley wanted right now was to call Aziraphale up, go over and just <i>be</i> with the angel. Or at least spend the\nday sprawled around his apartment processing everything and getting\nincreasingly giddy with the force of his epiphany.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>What\nhe had to do was go on a date with an archangel.</p><p>It\nmade him want to crawl under his couch cushions and curl up into a ball for a good week.</p><p>Adam\nhad been very clear that there was to be no fighting or discorportaing\nwhatsoever over the course of the dates.</p><p>Easy\nfor him to say. Crowley didn\u2019t think it would count as a fight if an archangel wanted\nto do away with him. It would be like an ant getting blasted with a laser\ntorpedo. Not much of a fight at all.</p><p>He\ngroaned into the cushioned padding of the couch.</p><p>Maybe\nit wouldn\u2019t be so bad? <br/></p><p>He\nwould bloody<i> </i>well survive it just to see Aziraphale again at the other side.</p><p>Crowley\nwanted to see Aziraphale <i>now</i>. <br/></p><p>He didn\u2019t\nwant to wait for two days, didn\u2019t want to hazard through two more dates when he\ncould be spending time with his angel. Maybe even confessing his feelings and\nbeing confessed to in return\u2026</p><p>With\na dramatic sigh he heaved himself off the couch, slumping over to his closet.</p><p>At\nleast he was getting dinner out of this one. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>It was one of the very best and\nmost expensive sushi restaurants in London. Aziraphale had insisted on the\nlocation this time. If things went badly, he at least wanted to get a nice meal\nout of it.</p><p>So far the food had not\ndisappointed. Aziraphale wore his favourite tweed coat and warmest tartan scarf\nas emotional armour. The green carnation Crowley had given him last night had\nbeen tucked safely into his button hole, migrating to the pocket of his shirt\nnow he was inside.</p><p>Its presence was a great comfort\nto him as he tried his best not to make eye contact with the form across from\nhim, valiantly focusing on eating pieces of maki spider roll as precisely and\nas viciously as he could.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let his guard down.</p><p>\u201cMore zake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said the angel,\nstiffly.</p><p>His date watched him, something\nlow and dangerous in his eyes like hellfire. The demon was eating food, or at\nleast putting it in his mouth. What exactly happened after that was anyone\u2019s\nguess, but there was a faint sound of buzzing and wailing at a register just\nunder what any human could hear.</p><p>\u201cZo. You\u2019re looking well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could say the same.\u201d He\nwouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s nails rapped against\nthe table.</p><p>\u201cYou were a Cherub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, revealing too many rows\nof too long teeth. \u201cI\ndo remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d\nAziraphale took a calculated sip of his sake. \u201cFrom the apocalypse. Yes. Not so\nlong ago, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom\nbefore,\u201d said Beelzebub.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nafraid you\u2019ll have to be a bit more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Before</i>.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nblinked. \u201cBefore\u2014the <i>Fall?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuzt\nzo.\u201d </p><p>The\nangel froze.</p><p>Something\nstrange crept into Beelzebub\u2019s eyes. Stranger than whatever it was they\nnormally did. \u201cYou were kind to me. Not many were.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly,\nthe angel felt the sake going to his head in a dizzying rush of panic and\nconfusion. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwaz only a lowly Power at the time,\u201d Beelzebub continued, voice soft. \u201cNot many\ncared about how I felt. There waz only Luzifer.\u201d His eyes sharpened. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared a little desperately. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYez.\nYou did not know me. But you ztopped to talk. To cheer me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh</i>.\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\nfelt as if his life were flashing before his eyes. It was such a long time ago.\nBut he did remember. Oh yes, little bits and pieces, coming back as he tried to\ngrasp at them. </p><p>A\nPower, downtrodden and ridiculed for believing that angels shouldn\u2019t be cast\naside in favour of humans. He had seemed so brokenhearted, sitting there all\nalone. Aziraphale remembered coming over to him, telling him gently that he\ndidn\u2019t really understand why God thought humans were so important either, but\nthere must be something to it. </p><p>And\nthen\u2026oh. </p><p>Oh\ndear. </p><p>He\nremembered saying some unsavory things about Gabriel, about how he and Michael\nwere a bit vicious when expressing their opinions, weren\u2019t they? There was no\nneed for all that holier-than-thou attitude, it was ridiculous! It had made the\npoor Power laugh, which is what he had been going for, and then Aziraphale had\npatted him on the back and told him to take care, and hadn\u2019t thought on it\nsince. </p><p>Thousands\nof years later, Aziraphale clutched his napkin in his lap desperately and\nstared at Beelzebub across from him.</p><p>The\narch-demon was smiling, sharp teeth flashing as his mouth stretched unnaturally\nwide.</p><p>\u201cI\nwas mozt dizzapointed when you did not join uz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nwould have done well az a demon. I would have zeen to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\nSorry to disappoint.\u201d</p><p>Something\nsoftened in the arch-demon\u2019s gaze, something nearly vulnerable stealing across his\nfeatures. \u201cI looked for you. After the Fall.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nlaughed nervously. Then he stopped. Silently, he lowered his emphatic\nshielding. </p><p>This\nwas not something he did often. On earth there were so many emotions\neverywhere, so many people feeling so many things, everywhere you turned was a\nnew crisis, another injustice, another soul in torment. It was simply too much\nto feel all the time. No angel could ever hope to help every soul in need,\nnever mind non-interference orders from Above. </p><p>Aziraphale\nhad been on earth for six-thousand years. It was shield himself or go mad from\nit. He sometimes suspected he went too far, could be too impassive to those in\nneed, too quick to turn away. But he\u2019d bloody well like to see any of them give\nit a go without developing unconventional coping mechanisms*.</p><p>*Like\nlocking himself in his bookshop for a week and re-reading the entire <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i> until he\u2019d\nblocked out the latest atrocity he hadn\u2019t the slightest chance of stopping. It\nwas a delicate game of guilt, avoidance and planned ignorance, all for the cause\nof warding off any creeping despair.</p><p>Bracing\nhimself, he reached out with his aura and allowed himself to feel what was\ncoming off of Beelzebub.</p><p>He\nchoked.</p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t exactly affection. It wasn\u2019t <i>not</i>\naffection either. There was respect, even admiration. Something else, something\nmuch more complicated hovering between pride and frustration and just a touch\nof smug avarice.</p><p>Beelzebub\u2019s\nsmile widened.</p><p>Aziraphale\nwithdrew his aura as if it he had been burned. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nserous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\noffer ztandz. You could do very well for yourzelf in Hell.\u201d</p><p>The\nangel drew himself up importantly. \u201cI rather think I have done well for\nmyself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhave a backbone. Not many do. We need more of them in Hell.\u201d He grinned. \u201cNot\njuzt the onez we rip out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\nThat sounds like your problem right there? Counter productive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\nZee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\nhas their own set of principals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\ndizobeyed direct orderz from Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nfrowned. \u201cAh yez. Crawly.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley</i>, thank you.\u201d He glared at the\ndemon. \u201cReally, what kind of arch-demon can\u2019t remember the names of those\nworking for them?</p><p>\n\u201cI do not pretend to underztand your attraction to him. You could do zo much\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re offering,\u201d said Azirphale, something sharp and\nflaming and furious glinting behind his eyes. \u201cBut if you ever even <i>think</i> of hurting Crowley you will be\nvery sorry.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nsat back in his seat, a deep buzzing laugh rumbling inside his chest, like a\nnest of bees that had been hit with a stick. \u201cAh, they don\u2019t know what they\nhave in you Upztairs. I can offer you zo much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\nthank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBothersome,\nisn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\nnize offize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nquite fond of my own, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll\nthe bookz you could ever want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\nthat all you have to offer?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cLook. I don\u2019t want power. I don\u2019t\nwant an office, and certainly not one in Hell. And books?\u201d The angel gestured.\n\u201cWhat better place to get them than on earth? And anyway, half the fun is in\ncollecting them. No, you\u2019ve nothing to offer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhave potential as a demon. You could be <i>zo</i>\npowerful. Ruthlezz. Zelfizh. Gluttonuz. You know you have theze qualitiez.\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\ngaze didn\u2019t waver. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cI\u2019m not the most\nvirtuous angel. But if I\u2019ve learned anything from earth, it\u2019s that knowing and\ndoing are very different things. I have potential for doing terrible things,\nyes. But so does everyone. It comes down to what we choose to do. And I will\nmake my own choices.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nsat back in his chair. He crossed his arms, a deeply pensive look coming into\nhis eyes. \u201cHmm.\u201d The faint buzzing sound got louder.</p><p>Aziraphale\ntook advantage of this to polish off the last of the unagi rolls, smearing them\nwith wasabi and dipping them liberally in soy sauce. He was carting off most of\nthe dragon roll to his own plate when Beelzebub stirred.</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\n</p><p>Azirphale\nlooked up sharply. Beelzebub was watching him, a smile oozing across his face. <br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019z\nit. That\u2019z what you want, izn\u2019t it?\u201d The demon leaned forward. \u201cI can give him\nto you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley\ncould be yourz. For all eternity. No one could contezt it. <br/></p><p>Aziraphale\nlowered his chopsticks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you say you would <i>give</i> me Crowley?\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nopened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou mean that you think Crowley is something you can just <i>give</i> me, and I\u2019d be happy with that?\u201d Aziraphale demanded,\nploughing right over him. \u201cYou are absolutely wrong! There is nothing\u2014\u201c he\njabbed a chopstick at the demon\u2014 \u201c<i>nothing</i>,\nI want from Crowley that you can <i>make</i>\nhim give me. What I want from Crowley is only what he is willing to\ngive\u2014freely! Of his own accord! No blackmail, no threatening, nothing! Do you\nunderstand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\n<i>hmm</i>. And don\u2019t you go threatening him\nin my presence! Don\u2019t threaten him at all! In fact you\u2019d better back right\noff\u2014and have your lackeys do so as well\u2014I won\u2019t have any of you bothering him\nand forcing him to do things he hates! You\u2019ll leave him well enough alone, do you\nhear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\nreally doez make you zo happy?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\npaused in his angry tirade. \u201cYes. Oh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cVery much.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nBeelzebub grumbled unhappily. \u201cZo long az he makez you happy Hell will leave\nhim alone.\u201d The arch-demon held his hand out across that table. The fingers\nended in claw-like nails. \u201cA favour for a favour. For what you did for me before.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cYe\u2014hang\non.\u201d Aziraphale glared. \u201cOho. <i>No</i>. I\ndon\u2019t <i>think</i> so. Nice try. As long as\nhe makes me happy, you say.\u201d The angel sat back and crossed his arms. \u201cNo. I\u2019m\nafraid that won\u2019t do at all. You do not bother Crowley <i>whatsoever</i>.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\ngrowled. \u201cBut if he doezn\u2019t make you happy\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter if he makes me miserable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo!\nNo buts! I don\u2019t care what terrible deeds he does in any hypothetical\nsituation, you are to leave him well and alone, you understand?\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nstared at him. Aziraphale felt his aura being sized up, examined, checked\nthoroughly for any resistance or weakness of will. There was none. Aziraphale\nhad realized exactly how much Crowley meant to him, everything had clicked\nfully into place.</p><p>His\nwill was as stone.</p><p>The\narch-demon pulled back, something about his expression softening. A small smile\ntugged at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHell\nwill not bother or punizh Crowley,\u201d he said. </p><p>Beelzebub\nheld out his hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nyou won\u2019t get any humans to do it either,\u201d said Aziraphale suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\nany danger does befall him, it\u2019s <i>me</i>\nwho\u2019ll come looking for names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwould expect no lezz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\nWell then. We have an understanding.\u201d</p><p>He\ngrasped Beelzebub\u2019s hand.</p><p>The\narch-demon\u2019s hand clasped about his own, hard, vice-like, but careful not to\nhurt.</p><p>\u201cCrowley\ncomes to no harm from the forzes of Hell or from our influenzes,\u201d said the\ndemon.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Unlezz</i>,\u201d Beelzebub stressed, angry\nbuzzing rising from deep in his chest. \u201cUnlezz,\u201d he continued before Aziraphale\ncould object, \u201cYou perzonally azk me to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwould <i>never!</i> Unless\u2014<i>ohh</i>, don\u2019t you go and try to get me\npossessed. It won\u2019t work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder\nyour own power. No pozzezzion. No coerzing. No blackmail. And no Heavenly\ninterfearenze. Only your own will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\nis not going to happen!\u201d cried the angel, trying to twist his hand out of the\ndemon\u2019s grasp. It was held too firmly.</p><p>\u201cThen\nit zhouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwon\u2019t be a problem because I won\u2019t agree to it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nthere iz no deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\n<i>bugger</i> you then!

Oddly sincere. It caught him off guard. He\nhuffed angrily, giving his hand one last petulant pull. He glared at the demon,\nquietly trying to set him aflame with his Will. The slight amusement in\nBeelzebub\u2019s eyes told him he was severely outclassed in that endeavor. Bugger.</p><p>\u201cLet\ngo of me,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cThiz\nfirzt.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nhuffed again. He stopped trying to extract his hand and just focused on getting\nhis breathing under control. \u201cI\u2019m not agreeing to anything if it puts Crowley in\ndanger,\u201d he said, emotion choking his voice. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nam not azking you to,\u201d said the arch-demon quietly. \u201cAz much az it painz me to\nzay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cLet\nme do thiz.

Do you think you can truzt me?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nsent out his aura, raked the demon with it, searching for any trace of treachery,\nany loophole sniggering at him from the shadows. He found none. He pulled back,\nstaring at the demon warily.</p><p>\u201cI\n<i>damn</i> well hope you\u2019re not lying. For\nyour sake. You would do well to remember that I am a Guardian. I was made to\nprotect. And I can promise you I <i>will</i>.\u201d <br/></p><p>Beelzebub\nsmiled widely, all his long, sharp teeth gleaming in the lamplight. \u201cYou are\nwazted on Heaven,\u201d he said warmly.</p><p>Aziraphale\nsniffed. \u201cI\u2019m done with Heaven. I want nothing to do with either side.\u201d He\nwriggled his fingers in the demon\u2019s hold. \u201cA favour for a favour then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\nit iz done.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nshook his hand, then released it. Aziraphale snatched it back, rubbing his\nwrist mistrustfully. It wasn\u2019t bruised at all, to his surprise. Not even reddened.\n</p><p>He\nsniffed. \u201cYes.

Then he waved his chopstick at the demon. \u201cThough it <i>won\u2019t</i> come up, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourze not,\u201d Beelzebub said indulgently. \u201cBut juzt in caze.\u201d </p><p>The\ndemon smiled at him across the table, no hint of malice in his eyes at all.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSo,\ner\u2026\u201d </p><p>Crowley\nwas floundering. He was in one of the higher end Italian restaurants of London.\nHe\u2019d been here before. Home turf advantage was his, and for that he was\ngrateful. </p><p>He felt woefully unprepared.</p><p>He\u2019d\nput on his favourite sleek button-down shirt, forgone any shoes (just his very\nown scales would do) and shrugged into one of Aziraphale\u2019s cardigans he had\nswiped from the angel and hidden away in his closet. It was a warm, chunky\nknit, soft from decades of wear, and patterned with argyle. A row of knitted\nducks made their way around its middle. It was far too big on him. Crowley\nloved it.</p><p>Even\nwith his angel\u2019s cardigan, he still struggled to make eye contact with the\narchangel across from him. </p><p>\u201cYou\nrun Heaven\u2019s infirmary, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nRaphael sat calmly across the table from him, taking even bites of their Capesante.\n\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nhad never bothered with the concept of genders and seemed quite at home in an\nambiguous body, wearing a long cream-coloured shift tied round the waist. They\nlooked a bit like an elf, with the long, elegant limbs and flowing, silvery\nhair. And elf, or a vampire that never got the goth memo.</p><p>\u201cRight.\nAnd, uh,\u201d Crowley cast about for something to say. \u201cHow\u2019s that been working\nout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ncan\u2019t complain. I\u2019m largely left alone to do as I please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d\nsaid Crowley desperately. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014nice.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nwas staring at him. They had been since they\u2019d met, in a slow, thoughtful sort\nof way of a person trying to place something. On a human it might have been a\nbit odd, but not unnerving. On an <i>archangel</i>\u2026\n</p><p>Crowley\nrubbed his feet together under the table and grabbed up his wine glass, taking\na sip and wondering how quickly he could shovel his gnocchi into his mouth and\nrun off without insulting them.</p><p>You\ndid <i>not</i> want to insult an archangel*.</p><p>*Unless\nyou were Aziraphale and the archangel was Gabriel. Because Gabriel was a\nbastard and deserved what he got.</p><p>\u201cYou\nworked in the garden.\u201d </p><p>Raphael\u2019s\nvoice was smooth and melodious. If you listened very carefully you could hear\nit threaded with the sound of tiny silvery bells and what may have been a\nbamboo flute, calming and soothing like a stream.</p><p>The\neffect was lost on Crowley, who choked on his wine, managing to lower his glass\nwithout spilling as he spluttered. \u201cMngk?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nwas unruffled. \u201cYou tended the gardens in the fourth sphere.\u201d They sat back in\ntheir seat, features softening in satisfaction. \u201cI remember now.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nblinked behind his sunglasses. Bless <i>someone</i>.\nThe gardens. That was a very long time ago. He hadn\u2019t thought about his pre-Fall\ndays in ages.</p><p>\u201cEh\nheh.\u201d He tried to surreptitiously wipe his mouth. \u201cYe-yeah.\u201d</p><p>A\ngentle smiled crossed Raphael\u2019s face. \u201cYou grew the most beautiful flowers. I\nwas especially fond of the orchids. Do you still keep it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\nIt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing\nthings. Plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMnn\u2026yeah.\nHah. A bit. I\u2019ve\u2026got a few plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you any pictures of them?\u201d asked Raphael, looking very interested.</p><p>\u201cOh\nyeah, loads.\u201d Crowley dug out his phone hastily, nearly dropping it in his\nnervousness. He opened one of his favourite plant albums and leaned over the\ntable with it. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\npeered down at the screen eagerly. They swiped from picture to picture, delight\nshining in their eyes. \u201cWonderful! They\u2019re so lush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nI know how to handle them,\u201d said Crowley, feeling very proud of himself. \u201cHave\nto keep them on their little grassy toes. Can\u2019t have them getting sloppy.\u201d He\ntucked his phone back in his pocket. \u201cI\u2019d like to have a greenhouse one day,\u201d\nhe offered.</p><p>\u201cMarvelous.\u201d\nRaphael smiled. \u201cYour compassion does you credit.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, getting horrible flashbacks from his second date. </p><p>\u201cOh,\nI don\u2019t mean to make you uncomfortable,\u201d said the archangel quickly. \u201cOnly it\nmust have been difficult to keep it after all you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfelt something soft and warm stretch out towards him. It was their aura, he realized\nwith a jolt. Raphael was reaching out with their aura. To offer\u2026comfort. To a\ndemon.</p><p>\u201cIt\ncan\u2019t image it\u2019s been easy for you,\u201d they said, voice low and soft.</p><p>Crowley\nfelt his mouth go dry. Something suspiciously like tears pricked at the back of\nhis eyes. \u201cNgk. I\u2019ve\u2014er.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cHeard good things about you.\u201d He flashed\nthe angel a nervous grin. \u201cI remember you were one of the reasonable ones.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nlaughed, a light airy sound like a wind chime. \u201cThank you. That is high\npraise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale\nspeaks highly of you,\u201d said Crowley carefully. He watched the angel\u2019s face,\nwaiting to see if any expression of annoyance or disgust would cross it. That\nwas his cue to manifest a purse and start shoving bread sticks into it.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s\neyes were fond. \u201cDid he? It\u2019s most kind of him. He speaks very highly of you as\nwell.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, his fork halfway to his mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s talked about me?\u201d</p><p>The\nangel seemed to misinterpret his tone. \u201cCrowley, you have nothing to fear.\nAziraphale would not betray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\u2014of\nbloody <i>course</i> not!\u201d spluttered the\ndemon, insulted. \u201cHe\u2019s my <i>friend!</i> He\nwould never\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\nknow. I know, Crowley,\u201d soothed Raphael. Crowley settled down, sending the\nangel an unfriendly look. \u201cI should explain myself. I am\u2026\u201d The archangel traced\nthe rim of their wine glass with slender fingers. \u201cSomething of a neutral force\nin Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\neyed them across the table. \u201cHow\u2019s that work then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nhumans started it. The Hippocratic oath. Commendable I thought. I devote myself\nto the care of my patients and to their keeping. It\u2019s not my business what they\nget up to. Or even what side they\u2019re on, as far as I care. I <i>heal</i>. I am not made for destruction, nor\ndo I have any desire to turn my hands to it. The normal rules of Heaven do not\napply in my infirmary. It would not be fair.\u201d Raphael smiled. \u201cI suppose you\ncould say, what happens in the infirmary <i>stays</i>\nin the infirmary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nMichael and all them are alright with it?\u201d</p><p>Something\nmischievous flashed in their eyes. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d </p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\nnot much they can do about it.\u201d Raphael\u2019s tone was almost smug. \u201cThe infirmary\nis <i>my</i> domain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice\none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\nthank you.\u201d</p><p>The\nsilence was more comfortable than it had been this time. Crowley ate his\ngnocchi, trying to savor the taste. A thought nagged at him, stealing away his\nappetite. He lowered his fork. </p><p>\u201cYou\nsaid Aziraphale spoke of me,\u201d he began slowly. Raphael nodded. \u201cSo. He was\u2014he\nwas in the infirmary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt\nthe time, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201c\nCrowley swallowed. \u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>It\nwas possible sometimes, that an angel or demon would sustain enough damage that\nthey had to go back Up (or Down) to recover from it. Occasionally the act of\ndiscorporation and the circumstances surrounding it would be damaging enough to\nleave them out of commission for some time. </p><p>Crowley\nhad <i>never</i> tried to harm Aziraphale.\nBut sometimes, early on\u2026there had been accidents. One hadn\u2019t known the other\nwas there, an angel getting caught off guard in a demon\u2019s wiles, a demon catching\nthe wrong end of a divine thwarting, simply by unlucky chance at being in the\nwrong place at the wrong time. It had happened. It was a large part of their\nmaking the Arrangement. If they knew where the other was, there wouldn\u2019t be any\nmore accidents. No one would get <i>hurt.</i></p><p>A\ncool hand covered his own, thin and long. Utterly unlike Aziraphale\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\nBe at peace. You were not responsible. Knowingly or otherwise.\u201d Crowley let out\na long breath. \u201cAziraphale had a brush with a place of particularly strong\ninfernal taint some two-thousand years ago. It took him some weeks to recover.\nAll he spoke of was how sorry he was to miss out on dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed a little shakily. \u201cYeah. Yeah, that\u2019s my angel. Never would pass up a\ngood meal.\u201d</p><p>The\nangel withdrew their hand. They gave him a significant look. \u201cI suspect it was\nthe company, if I may be so bold to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGossipy,\naren\u2019t you angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\nhave to get up to something. Outright violence isn\u2019t really an option to us.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. </p><p>\u201cHe\ncares for you very much,\u201d continued Raphael. \u201cAziraphale. All the while he was\nin my care, it wasn\u2019t anything I was doing that helped him recover. It was\ntalking about <i>you</i>, and doing\neverything he could to get better so he could back and see you again.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfelt his face heating up in a wild blush. \u201cThat\u2019s the most cheesy thing I\u2019ve\never heard. You\u2019re making that up!\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nsmiled. \u201cPerhaps I exaggerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nthinking of you brought him such comfort. I know this. It\u2019s what I am made\nfor.\u201d</p><p>While\na large part of Crowley was happy to roll about insensibly in happiness, a\nsmaller more suspicious part was asking the important questions. </p><p>\u201cWhy\nare you telling me this?\u201d He watched the angel carefully. \u201cAre you\u2026<i>tempting</i> me into a relationship with\nhim?<i> I</i> am the expert at temptation.\nYou can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith\nall due respect, I don\u2019t think I need to.\u201d Crowley made an offended sound. They\nwere right though, <i>bless</i> them. \u201cIt\u2019s\nvery clear to me that you both care for each other a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nadmitted Crowley after a moment. Then he took off his sunglasses and met the\narchangel\u2019s gaze directly. \u201cIf we do this, if he and I are together\u2014<i>properly</i>\u2014will he\u2026\u201d he took a breath. \u201cWill\nhe be Punished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\nhas made it very clear\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cThis\nisn\u2019t about Adam,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen when and if\nAdam dies\u2014this is about Heaven. <i>Please</i>.\nI have to know. Will being with me cause him harm? I won\u2019t&hellip;\u201d he swallowed, a\nlump forming in his throat. \u201cI won\u2019t have that.\u201d<br/></p><p>Oh\nhe <i>wanted</i> Aziraphale, he wanted to be\nnear him, to make him laugh and scoff, to wake up next to him every day and\nmake a nuisance of himself while he was trying to read. But if his affection\nwould be the cause of punishment, then\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo\nCrowley.\u201d Raphael looked at him solemnly across the table. \u201cHe won\u2019t. Heaven\nhas decided to leave Aziraphale alone.\u201d</p><p>He\nshot Raphael a hard look. \u201cAnd if they change their minds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\nwould be a trial, and a vote, and I can promise you enough of us either don\u2019t\ncare what Aziraphale does, or will side in his favor simply to annoy Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlet out a shaky breath. \u201cPromise me you will speak up for him if it happens. <i>Please.</i> If there\u2019s anything I can do,\nanything I can offer you, I will, just\u2014please. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse,\u201d said Raphael, brow creasing. \u201cCrowley, of <i>course</i> I\u2019ll look out for him. You need give me nothing.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfelt as if a great weight had been taken off his shoulders. He took a moment to\ncompose himself. \u201cThank you,\u201d he managed, dizzy from it.</p><p>Raphael\nwatched him, respect and admiration clear on their face.\u201cI am glad to have met\nyou, Crowley. You are truly a remarkable soul. Such compassion. Such love&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nyeah.\u201d Like he\u2019d never heard that before. Crowley crossed his legs, slouching\ndown in his seat more comfortably. \u201cDon\u2019t spread it around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nwould have made a remarkable angel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nsniffed, wiping a speck of lint off his shirt*.\u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a\nremarkable demon.\u201d</p><p>*It\nwasn\u2019t there before, but he had wanted it to be, and so it had.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s\neyes were very fond. \u201cYes. That too. But you would have made quite the healer.\nShould you ever need help, should Hell ever set their wiles against you, know\nthat you can call for me. I will look out for you.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, his wine glass half way to his mouth. He took a large gulp, hand shaking\nslightly. He put it down heavily. \u201cUrm. Ye..ah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa\nha. Ha.\u201d He picked up his glass and took a large gulp.</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\nThe archangel leaned in. \u201cI am in earnest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa?\nUgh\u2026ngk. Why?\u201d Crowley asked in a small confused voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause\nyou have so much love in you. Because you have been so loyal for so long to the\none you love. And because I can see the damage Hell has caused you.\u201d They\nsmiled sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s rent across the fabric of your soul in a terrible scar. Yet\nyou still have such compassion. It\u2019s remarkable.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s\nmind was racing, a dizzying feeling of embarrassment, indignity and panic at\nbeing picked apart washing over him. A part of him was flattered and welcomed\nthe praise. Another part was simply very, very tired.</p><p>Why\ncouldn\u2019t he just be accepted as himself?</p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d\ncontinued Raphael gently. \u201cShould you ever decide to return to Heaven, know\nthat I will speak for you. No harm will befall you, should you wish to return.\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon was still for a long moment. Then he let out a breath, only a little bit\nshaky. He put his sunglasses back on, and gave Raphael a winning smile, only a\nlittle bit wobbly. \u201cNot really my scene. Heaven. Never could follow orders very\nwell. Besides,\u201d he shrugged, feeling more himself again. \u201cIt cramped my style.\u201d</p><p>A\nslow smile stretched across the archangel\u2019s face. \u201cA terrible thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nis.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\ndo seem happy down here. On earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\nno where I\u2019d rather be,\u201d said Crowley honestly. </p><p>Raphael\nstared at him. \u201cYou really mean that.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nflushed and fidgeted with his napkin. \u201cEr. Yeah. Where else can I drive my\nBentley anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nI am glad for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nleaned back, a pensive look coming into their eyes. \u201cI admire earth, but can\u2019t\nreally say I care for it. Not in the way you do. Happily my interests have always\nbeen more contained to my practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\nGlad that worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\nBut should things ever change, my offer still stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\nThanks.\u201d Crowley squirmed at the sincerity. \u201cNo really, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\npleasure.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>The\nstreets of Soho were busy tonight, people bustling about, the thin layer of\nsnow laying over the rooftops and streets adding a serene look to the place.</p><p>Aziraphale\nwalked briskly, mind racing.</p><p>A\npart of him that had enjoyed that. Aziraphale didn\u2019t want to dwell on it, nor\ndid he want to think about the small part of him that was flattered at the\nattention.</p><p>He\nfilled the information away under \u2018Just In Case\u2019, shut the metaphorical drawer\nand locked it, and focused on the epiphany looming ahead of him.</p><p>The\nbookshop door closed behind Aziraphale. He heaved a deep sigh and held out his\nhand, catching the new quiz as it materialized before him.</p><p>The\nlast one.</p><p>A\nfeeling of indignity rose up in him.</p><p>He\ndidn\u2019t want to wait another day to see Crowley. They <i>deserved</i> to matched.</p><p>And\nAziraphale was going to see to it that they did.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nstepped into his flat, too preoccupied to notice how his plants straightened up at\nhis presence. </p><p>Raphael\nhad been understanding. Alarmingly so. But he was tired, so tired of everyone\ncalling him an anomaly, pointing out how different he was, how good of an angel\nhe <i>could</i> have been. As if there was something tragic about him as he was. As if\nhe were incomplete.</p><p>He\njust wanted to be with the one person who cared for him as he was, who knew\nevery part of him and liked him for it.</p><p>Maybe\neven <i>loved</i> him.</p><p>With\na flash, the quiz materialized in front of him. He caught it, glaring down at\nthe pink pages.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nplayed by your rules,\u201d he told it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m done with that.\u201d</p><p>Adam\nwanted them to answer this thing honestly, right?</p><p>He\u2019d\nbloody well give it honesty. He\u2019d tell it <i>exactly</i>\nwhat he wanted and wouldn\u2019t leave room for it to give him anything less.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\ntapped his pen against the paper, reading over the quiz.</p><p>\u201cPreferences,\nhere we go.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to put down some deal breakers.\nLet\u2019s see\u2026must own a car. That\u2019s important\u2026a vintage one, let\u2019s say. Oh, how\nabout a black 1926 Bentley. Custom made. With a cassette player.\u201d He underlined the next\npart. \u201c<i>Only</i> plays Queen&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll\nneed to be well read.\u201d Crowley scribbled it down on the answer sheet. \u201cIt\u2019s all\nright if they don\u2019t know all their media but they\u2019ve got to know their books.\nAnd own a bookshop in Soho, London. Have owned it for over three hundred years. Erratic opening hours. Refuses to let anyone buy anything&hellip;\u201d <br/></p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cMust\nhave an affinity with snakes, I really can\u2019t stand someone who doesn\u2019t\nappreciate them! Dresses sharply, sunglasses I think. Owns a sketch of the Mona\nLisa\u2026and an embarrassing statue of an angel and demon \u2018wrestling\u2019, can\u2019t forget\nthat. Has many fancy appliances, <i>none</i>\nof them plugged in. And a terrified yet very lush collection of houseplants.\u201d Aziraphale smiled. \u201cA gentle soul, but a sharp wit and\njust the right kind of humor. I want someone that makes me think, but respects\nme for who I am\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cMust\ndress like an outdated professor.\u201d A grin split Crowley\u2019s face. \u201cA <i>gay </i>professor, with flamboyant cravats\nand terrible tartan everywhere&hellip; Must have experience with a sword. Knows how\nto gavotte. Owns a complete collection of the infamous bibles, and a signed\nfirst edition of <i>The Portrait of Dorian\nGrey</i>, with a long personal note from the author addressed to them, specifically.\u201d </p><p>He\npaused and really thought for a moment. \u201cI won\u2019t have anyone unkind. They have\nto mean well, even if they\u2019re a little absent minded. I want someone strong and\nsoft, someone that will let me blather on at four in the morning when I\u2019m off\nmy head. Someone patient and understanding\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nwho won\u2019t take my introversion as disinterest. Someone I can just <i>be</i> with, without having to be anything,\nor do anything. Someone who can see past my faults but won\u2019t hesitate to tell\nme when I\u2019m being obtuse&hellip;\u201d Aziraphale trailed off. \u201cSomeone who won\u2019t let me\nfall,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t judge me if I did.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nwho will be my friend, no matter what form I take. Someone who\u2019s never been\nafraid of me, who can see my worth and not want me to be anything else.\u201d Crowley\nfilled out his quiz, ticking off boxes without mind for how he came off. \u201cI\nneed someone I can talk to.

Adam was giving Dog one last pat down before cycling off to\nschool when he heard someone calling his name.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d</p><p>The boy turned, watching a\nharassed looking Aziraphale land at the foot of the driveway, wings out and\nmessy. The angel took a moment to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cHullo Aziraphale,\u201d he greeted\ncheerfully. \u201cHow\u2019s the dating going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s\u2014erm. Look.\u201d There was\nsomething desperate in his eyes. \u201cAbout this match. It\u2019s\u2026I don\u2019t. I really <i>really</i> don\u2019t think this will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s\n<i>Gabriel!</i> I can\u2019t\u2014this must be a joke,\nthere\u2019s no way I could have matched with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nyou did match with him,\u201d said Adam innocently.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014I\u2014I\ncan\u2019t have! He\u2019s awful. And have you seen what he <i>wears?</i>* Ghastly!\u201d The angel looked wretched at the thought of it.</p><p>*Gabriel\ndressed like he was on the cover of a glossy, highly conservative fashion\nmagazine featuring lean, muscular men in dull neutral-coloured business attire,\nand radiating an almost tangible air of <i>no\nhomo</i> in a mile radius around. It made Aziraphale want to clutch at his\nbright paisley bow-tie in horror.</p><p>Adam\ntook pity on him. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m sorry. You were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d</p><p>Adam\ngrinned sheepishly. \u201cJust wanted to see if you really didn\u2019t get along or if\nyou just liked fighting.\u201d Aziraphale gaped at him. \u201cI would have gone through\nwith it, but Gabriel\u2019s already come by to complain, and ugh. Yeah, I can see\nwhy you don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s a right tosser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh thank you. So, I don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo\nno. He\u2019s been matched with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nthank goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d\nAdam waved his hand. Aziraphale caught the pink booklet as it materialized and\nfluttered down towards him. \u201cThere\u2019s the real results. But you have to go with\nwhoever you get this time, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nyes of course,\u201d agreed Aziaphale, so relieved he would have agreed to just\nabout anything.</p><p>\u201cCheer\nup! Only two more to go!\u201d Adam picked up his bike and slung a leg over it,\nhoisting himself onto the seat.</p><p>\u201cRight.\nThank you, dear boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee\nyou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nwatched the boy turn onto the road and cycle off into the town.</p><p>He\nlet out a long breath, the new results of the quiz held in his hand.</p><p>Last\nnight he had dared to hope he would be matched with Crowley. The more he\nthought on it, the more he felt terribly foolish for not thinking of it before.\nOf <i>course</i> he should be matched with\nCrowley. Hadn\u2019t they already chosen each other, in so many little ways throughout all\ntheir long history together?</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas in love with him. </p><p>He\nhad never wanted for a romantic relationship because just being in Crowley\u2019s\ncompany had been everything he had wanted.</p><p>Or\nso he had thought.</p><p>But\nnow the subject had been brought up, now that romance and candles and such\nunspeakable intimacies as <i>hand holding</i>\nand <i>snuggling</i> had been brought into\nlight\u2026oh, to have <i>that</i> with Crowley?</p><p>It\nwas dizzying to think of how badly he wanted it.</p><p>The\ntrouble was, he wasn\u2019t sure if Crowley felt the same. He had\u2026something of a\nhunch. He dearly hoped he was correct and that he hadn\u2019t been reading his\ndearest friend wrong these last few days.</p><p>It\nwas absolutely ridiculous they hadn\u2019t matched before, come to think of it. He\nand Crowley were\u2026it just felt so <i>right</i>.\nSurely they would match now?</p><p>Aziraphale\nlooked down at the quiz.</p><p>Even\nif it wasn\u2019t Crowley, it couldn\u2019t be worse than Gabriel, he reasoned.</p><p>Then\nhe saw who he had matched with.</p><p>He\nspluttered.</p><p>Maybe,\njust maybe, it could be worse than Gabriel.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nlay face-down on his sofa, bemoaning his woes incoherently to his plants. His\nsoul music collection was blasting loud enough to shake the walls and disturb\nthe neighbors. As he didn\u2019t feel like having upset neighbours banging on\nhis door, they simply didn\u2019t hear it.</p><p>The\npink quiz lay crumpled on the floor where it had been banished some hours\nearlier.</p><p>He\nhadn\u2019t got Aziraphale.</p><p>Of\nbloody course he hadn\u2019t. That was just how things went, didn\u2019t they, he thought\nbitterly, in an uncharacteristic bout of pessimism. </p><p>The\nmore reasonable voice in his head (which sounded suspiciously like Aziraphale)\nsaid that of <i>course</i> he had Aziraphale\n(<i>dear boy</i>). They\u2019d had each other for\na very long time, hadn\u2019t they? </p><p>It\nwas just all this dating toss up had blown something loose, rattled up their\nold routine and put things properly in perspective.</p><p>He\nwas in love with Aziraphale. </p><p>Had\nbeen, likely, for centuries, millennia even, little by little, sauntering into it\nas gradually and as naturally as breathing*.</p><p>*Which wasn\u2019t natural at all to occult and ethereal beings. It was a choice, a habit they had picked up and adopted so thoroughly that stopping it felt <i>bad</i> and wrong instinctively.<br></p><p>He\nhad good reason to believe it may be reciprocated.</p><p>What\nCrowley wanted right now was to call Aziraphale up, go over and just <i>be</i> with the angel. Or at least spend the\nday sprawled around his apartment processing everything and getting\nincreasingly giddy with the force of his epiphany.\u00a0 <br></p><p>What\nhe had to do was go on a date with an archangel.</p><p>It\nmade him want to crawl under his couch cushions and curl up into a ball for a good week.</p><p>Adam\nhad been very clear that there was to be no fighting or discorportaing\nwhatsoever over the course of the dates.</p><p>Easy\nfor him to say. Crowley didn\u2019t think it would count as a fight if an archangel wanted\nto do away with him. It would be like an ant getting blasted with a laser\ntorpedo. Not much of a fight at all.</p><p>He\ngroaned into the cushioned padding of the couch.</p><p>Maybe\nit wouldn\u2019t be so bad? <br></p><p>He\nwould bloody<i> </i>well survive it just to see Aziraphale again at the other side.</p><p>Crowley\nwanted to see Aziraphale <i>now</i>. <br></p><p>He didn\u2019t\nwant to wait for two days, didn\u2019t want to hazard through two more dates when he\ncould be spending time with his angel. Maybe even confessing his feelings and\nbeing confessed to in return\u2026</p><p>With\na dramatic sigh he heaved himself off the couch, slumping over to his closet.</p><p>At\nleast he was getting dinner out of this one. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>It was one of the very best and\nmost expensive sushi restaurants in London. Aziraphale had insisted on the\nlocation this time. If things went badly, he at least wanted to get a nice meal\nout of it.</p><p>So far the food had not\ndisappointed. Aziraphale wore his favourite tweed coat and warmest tartan scarf\nas emotional armour. The green carnation Crowley had given him last night had\nbeen tucked safely into his button hole, migrating to the pocket of his shirt\nnow he was inside.</p><p>Its presence was a great comfort\nto him as he tried his best not to make eye contact with the form across from\nhim, valiantly focusing on eating pieces of maki spider roll as precisely and\nas viciously as he could.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let his guard down.</p><p>\u201cMore zake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said the angel,\nstiffly.</p><p>His date watched him, something\nlow and dangerous in his eyes like hellfire. The demon was eating food, or at\nleast putting it in his mouth. What exactly happened after that was anyone\u2019s\nguess, but there was a faint sound of buzzing and wailing at a register just\nunder what any human could hear.</p><p>\u201cZo. You\u2019re looking well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could say the same.\u201d He\nwouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s nails rapped against\nthe table.</p><p>\u201cYou were a Cherub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, revealing too many rows\nof too long teeth. \u201cI\ndo remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d\nAziraphale took a calculated sip of his sake. \u201cFrom the apocalypse. Yes. Not so\nlong ago, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom\nbefore,\u201d said Beelzebub.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nafraid you\u2019ll have to be a bit more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Before</i>.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nblinked. \u201cBefore\u2014the <i>Fall?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuzt\nzo.\u201d </p><p>The\nangel froze.</p><p>Something\nstrange crept into Beelzebub\u2019s eyes. Stranger than whatever it was they\nnormally did. \u201cYou were kind to me. Not many were.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly,\nthe angel felt the sake going to his head in a dizzying rush of panic and\nconfusion. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwaz only a lowly Power at the time,\u201d Beelzebub continued, voice soft. \u201cNot many\ncared about how I felt. There waz only Luzifer.\u201d His eyes sharpened. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared a little desperately. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYez.\nYou did not know me. But you ztopped to talk. To cheer me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh</i>.\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\nfelt as if his life were flashing before his eyes. It was such a long time ago.\nBut he did remember. Oh yes, little bits and pieces, coming back as he tried to\ngrasp at them. </p><p>A\nPower, downtrodden and ridiculed for believing that angels shouldn\u2019t be cast\naside in favour of humans. He had seemed so brokenhearted, sitting there all\nalone. Aziraphale remembered coming over to him, telling him gently that he\ndidn\u2019t really understand why God thought humans were so important either, but\nthere must be something to it. </p><p>And\nthen\u2026oh. </p><p>Oh\ndear. </p><p>He\nremembered saying some unsavory things about Gabriel, about how he and Michael\nwere a bit vicious when expressing their opinions, weren\u2019t they? There was no\nneed for all that holier-than-thou attitude, it was ridiculous! It had made the\npoor Power laugh, which is what he had been going for, and then Aziraphale had\npatted him on the back and told him to take care, and hadn\u2019t thought on it\nsince. </p><p>Thousands\nof years later, Aziraphale clutched his napkin in his lap desperately and\nstared at Beelzebub across from him.</p><p>The\narch-demon was smiling, sharp teeth flashing as his mouth stretched unnaturally\nwide.</p><p>\u201cI\nwas mozt dizzapointed when you did not join uz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nwould have done well az a demon. I would have zeen to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\nSorry to disappoint.\u201d</p><p>Something\nsoftened in the arch-demon\u2019s gaze, something nearly vulnerable stealing across his\nfeatures. \u201cI looked for you. After the Fall.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nlaughed nervously. Then he stopped. Silently, he lowered his emphatic\nshielding. </p><p>This\nwas not something he did often. On earth there were so many emotions\neverywhere, so many people feeling so many things, everywhere you turned was a\nnew crisis, another injustice, another soul in torment. It was simply too much\nto feel all the time. No angel could ever hope to help every soul in need,\nnever mind non-interference orders from Above. </p><p>Aziraphale\nhad been on earth for six-thousand years. It was shield himself or go mad from\nit. He sometimes suspected he went too far, could be too impassive to those in\nneed, too quick to turn away. But he\u2019d bloody well like to see any of them give\nit a go without developing unconventional coping mechanisms*.</p><p>*Like\nlocking himself in his bookshop for a week and re-reading the entire <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i> until he\u2019d\nblocked out the latest atrocity he hadn\u2019t the slightest chance of stopping. It\nwas a delicate game of guilt, avoidance and planned ignorance, all for the cause\nof warding off any creeping despair.</p><p>Bracing\nhimself, he reached out with his aura and allowed himself to feel what was\ncoming off of Beelzebub.</p><p>He\nchoked.</p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t exactly affection. It wasn\u2019t <i>not</i>\naffection either. There was respect, even admiration. Something else, something\nmuch more complicated hovering between pride and frustration and just a touch\nof smug avarice.</p><p>Beelzebub\u2019s\nsmile widened.</p><p>Aziraphale\nwithdrew his aura as if it he had been burned. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nserous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\noffer ztandz. You could do very well for yourzelf in Hell.\u201d</p><p>The\nangel drew himself up importantly. \u201cI rather think I have done well for\nmyself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhave a backbone. Not many do. We need more of them in Hell.\u201d He grinned. \u201cNot\njuzt the onez we rip out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\nThat sounds like your problem right there? Counter productive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\nZee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\nhas their own set of principals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\ndizobeyed direct orderz from Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nfrowned. \u201cAh yez. Crawly.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley</i>, thank you.\u201d He glared at the\ndemon. \u201cReally, what kind of arch-demon can\u2019t remember the names of those\nworking for them?</p><p>\n\u201cI do not pretend to underztand your attraction to him. You could do zo much\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re offering,\u201d said Azirphale, something sharp and\nflaming and furious glinting behind his eyes. \u201cBut if you ever even <i>think</i> of hurting Crowley you will be\nvery sorry.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nsat back in his seat, a deep buzzing laugh rumbling inside his chest, like a\nnest of bees that had been hit with a stick. \u201cAh, they don\u2019t know what they\nhave in you Upztairs. I can offer you zo much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\nthank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBothersome,\nisn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\nnize offize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nquite fond of my own, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll\nthe bookz you could ever want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\nthat all you have to offer?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cLook. I don\u2019t want power. I don\u2019t\nwant an office, and certainly not one in Hell. And books?\u201d The angel gestured.\n\u201cWhat better place to get them than on earth? And anyway, half the fun is in\ncollecting them. No, you\u2019ve nothing to offer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhave potential as a demon. You could be <i>zo</i>\npowerful. Ruthlezz. Zelfizh. Gluttonuz. You know you have theze qualitiez.\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\ngaze didn\u2019t waver. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cI\u2019m not the most\nvirtuous angel. But if I\u2019ve learned anything from earth, it\u2019s that knowing and\ndoing are very different things. I have potential for doing terrible things,\nyes. But so does everyone. It comes down to what we choose to do. And I will\nmake my own choices.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nsat back in his chair. He crossed his arms, a deeply pensive look coming into\nhis eyes. \u201cHmm.\u201d The faint buzzing sound got louder.</p><p>Aziraphale\ntook advantage of this to polish off the last of the unagi rolls, smearing them\nwith wasabi and dipping them liberally in soy sauce. He was carting off most of\nthe dragon roll to his own plate when Beelzebub stirred.</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\n</p><p>Azirphale\nlooked up sharply. Beelzebub was watching him, a smile oozing across his face. <br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019z\nit. That\u2019z what you want, izn\u2019t it?\u201d The demon leaned forward. \u201cI can give him\nto you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley\ncould be yourz. For all eternity. No one could contezt it. <br></p><p>Aziraphale\nlowered his chopsticks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you say you would <i>give</i> me Crowley?\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nopened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou mean that you think Crowley is something you can just <i>give</i> me, and I\u2019d be happy with that?\u201d Aziraphale demanded,\nploughing right over him. \u201cYou are absolutely wrong! There is nothing\u2014\u201c he\njabbed a chopstick at the demon\u2014 \u201c<i>nothing</i>,\nI want from Crowley that you can <i>make</i>\nhim give me. What I want from Crowley is only what he is willing to\ngive\u2014freely! Of his own accord! No blackmail, no threatening, nothing! Do you\nunderstand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\n<i>hmm</i>. And don\u2019t you go threatening him\nin my presence! Don\u2019t threaten him at all! In fact you\u2019d better back right\noff\u2014and have your lackeys do so as well\u2014I won\u2019t have any of you bothering him\nand forcing him to do things he hates! You\u2019ll leave him well enough alone, do you\nhear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\nreally doez make you zo happy?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\npaused in his angry tirade. \u201cYes. Oh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cVery much.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nBeelzebub grumbled unhappily. \u201cZo long az he makez you happy Hell will leave\nhim alone.\u201d The arch-demon held his hand out across that table. The fingers\nended in claw-like nails. \u201cA favour for a favour. For what you did for me before.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cYe\u2014hang\non.\u201d Aziraphale glared. \u201cOho. <i>No</i>. I\ndon\u2019t <i>think</i> so. Nice try. As long as\nhe makes me happy, you say.\u201d The angel sat back and crossed his arms. \u201cNo. I\u2019m\nafraid that won\u2019t do at all. You do not bother Crowley <i>whatsoever</i>.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\ngrowled. \u201cBut if he doezn\u2019t make you happy\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter if he makes me miserable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo!\nNo buts! I don\u2019t care what terrible deeds he does in any hypothetical\nsituation, you are to leave him well and alone, you understand?\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nstared at him. Aziraphale felt his aura being sized up, examined, checked\nthoroughly for any resistance or weakness of will. There was none. Aziraphale\nhad realized exactly how much Crowley meant to him, everything had clicked\nfully into place.</p><p>His\nwill was as stone.</p><p>The\narch-demon pulled back, something about his expression softening. A small smile\ntugged at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHell\nwill not bother or punizh Crowley,\u201d he said. </p><p>Beelzebub\nheld out his hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nyou won\u2019t get any humans to do it either,\u201d said Aziraphale suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\nany danger does befall him, it\u2019s <i>me</i>\nwho\u2019ll come looking for names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwould expect no lezz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\nWell then. We have an understanding.\u201d</p><p>He\ngrasped Beelzebub\u2019s hand.</p><p>The\narch-demon\u2019s hand clasped about his own, hard, vice-like, but careful not to\nhurt.</p><p>\u201cCrowley\ncomes to no harm from the forzes of Hell or from our influenzes,\u201d said the\ndemon.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Unlezz</i>,\u201d Beelzebub stressed, angry\nbuzzing rising from deep in his chest. \u201cUnlezz,\u201d he continued before Aziraphale\ncould object, \u201cYou perzonally azk me to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwould <i>never!</i> Unless\u2014<i>ohh</i>, don\u2019t you go and try to get me\npossessed. It won\u2019t work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder\nyour own power. No pozzezzion. No coerzing. No blackmail. And no Heavenly\ninterfearenze. Only your own will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\nis not going to happen!\u201d cried the angel, trying to twist his hand out of the\ndemon\u2019s grasp. It was held too firmly.</p><p>\u201cThen\nit zhouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwon\u2019t be a problem because I won\u2019t agree to it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nthere iz no deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\n<i>bugger</i> you then!

Oddly sincere. It caught him off guard. He\nhuffed angrily, giving his hand one last petulant pull. He glared at the demon,\nquietly trying to set him aflame with his Will. The slight amusement in\nBeelzebub\u2019s eyes told him he was severely outclassed in that endeavor. Bugger.</p><p>\u201cLet\ngo of me,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cThiz\nfirzt.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nhuffed again. He stopped trying to extract his hand and just focused on getting\nhis breathing under control. \u201cI\u2019m not agreeing to anything if it puts Crowley in\ndanger,\u201d he said, emotion choking his voice. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nam not azking you to,\u201d said the arch-demon quietly. \u201cAz much az it painz me to\nzay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cLet\nme do thiz. Crowley will only come to harm if you exprezzively tell me you want\nhim to be. That iz the only condition. He will be zafe otherwize. Thiz I\nzwear.\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\nglared at him. \u201cHow do I know I can trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t. I zupoze. Do you think you can truzt me?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nsent out his aura, raked the demon with it, searching for any trace of treachery,\nany loophole sniggering at him from the shadows. He found none. He pulled back,\nstaring at the demon warily.</p><p>\u201cI\n<i>damn</i> well hope you\u2019re not lying. For\nyour sake. You would do well to remember that I am a Guardian. I was made to\nprotect. And I can promise you I <i>will</i>.\u201d <br></p><p>Beelzebub\nsmiled widely, all his long, sharp teeth gleaming in the lamplight. \u201cYou are\nwazted on Heaven,\u201d he said warmly.</p><p>Aziraphale\nsniffed. \u201cI\u2019m done with Heaven. I want nothing to do with either side.\u201d He\nwriggled his fingers in the demon\u2019s hold. \u201cA favour for a favour then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\nit iz done.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nshook his hand, then released it. Aziraphale snatched it back, rubbing his\nwrist mistrustfully. It wasn\u2019t bruised at all, to his surprise. Not even reddened.\n</p><p>He\nsniffed. \u201cYes. Well.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDezzert?\u201d\noozed the demon.</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know that I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\nhave fried ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\nMaybe a taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\niz on me.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\neyes narrowed. \u201cOh no.

And you are no\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d Aziraphale\nresisted the urge to stick his tongue out at the demon. He was\u2026being\nsurprisingly sincere. It was jarring. \u201cThank\nyou,\u201d he said stiffly. Then he waved his chopstick at the demon. \u201cThough it <i>won\u2019t</i> come up, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourze not,\u201d Beelzebub said indulgently. \u201cBut juzt in caze.\u201d </p><p>The\ndemon smiled at him across the table, no hint of malice in his eyes at all.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSo,\ner\u2026\u201d </p><p>Crowley\nwas floundering. He was in one of the higher end Italian restaurants of London.\nHe\u2019d been here before. Home turf advantage was his, and for that he was\ngrateful. </p><p>He felt woefully unprepared.</p><p>He\u2019d\nput on his favourite sleek button-down shirt, forgone any shoes (just his very\nown scales would do) and shrugged into one of Aziraphale\u2019s cardigans he had\nswiped from the angel and hidden away in his closet. It was a warm, chunky\nknit, soft from decades of wear, and patterned with argyle. A row of knitted\nducks made their way around its middle. It was far too big on him. Crowley\nloved it.</p><p>Even\nwith his angel\u2019s cardigan, he still struggled to make eye contact with the\narchangel across from him. </p><p>\u201cYou\nrun Heaven\u2019s infirmary, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nRaphael sat calmly across the table from him, taking even bites of their Capesante.\n\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nhad never bothered with the concept of genders and seemed quite at home in an\nambiguous body, wearing a long cream-coloured shift tied round the waist. They\nlooked a bit like an elf, with the long, elegant limbs and flowing, silvery\nhair. And elf, or a vampire that never got the goth memo.</p><p>\u201cRight.\nAnd, uh,\u201d Crowley cast about for something to say. \u201cHow\u2019s that been working\nout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ncan\u2019t complain. I\u2019m largely left alone to do as I please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d\nsaid Crowley desperately. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014nice.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nwas staring at him. They had been since they\u2019d met, in a slow, thoughtful sort\nof way of a person trying to place something. On a human it might have been a\nbit odd, but not unnerving. On an <i>archangel</i>\u2026\n</p><p>Crowley\nrubbed his feet together under the table and grabbed up his wine glass, taking\na sip and wondering how quickly he could shovel his gnocchi into his mouth and\nrun off without insulting them.</p><p>You\ndid <i>not</i> want to insult an archangel*.</p><p>*Unless\nyou were Aziraphale and the archangel was Gabriel. Because Gabriel was a\nbastard and deserved what he got.</p><p>\u201cYou\nworked in the garden.\u201d </p><p>Raphael\u2019s\nvoice was smooth and melodious. If you listened very carefully you could hear\nit threaded with the sound of tiny silvery bells and what may have been a\nbamboo flute, calming and soothing like a stream.</p><p>The\neffect was lost on Crowley, who choked on his wine, managing to lower his glass\nwithout spilling as he spluttered. \u201cMngk?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nwas unruffled. \u201cYou tended the gardens in the fourth sphere.\u201d They sat back in\ntheir seat, features softening in satisfaction. \u201cI remember now.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nblinked behind his sunglasses. Bless <i>someone</i>.\nThe gardens. That was a very long time ago. He hadn\u2019t thought about his pre-Fall\ndays in ages.</p><p>\u201cEh\nheh.\u201d He tried to surreptitiously wipe his mouth. \u201cYe-yeah.\u201d</p><p>A\ngentle smiled crossed Raphael\u2019s face. \u201cYou grew the most beautiful flowers. I\nwas especially fond of the orchids. Do you still keep it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\nIt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing\nthings. Plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMnn\u2026yeah.\nHah. A bit. I\u2019ve\u2026got a few plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you any pictures of them?\u201d asked Raphael, looking very interested.</p><p>\u201cOh\nyeah, loads.\u201d Crowley dug out his phone hastily, nearly dropping it in his\nnervousness. He opened one of his favourite plant albums and leaned over the\ntable with it. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\npeered down at the screen eagerly. They swiped from picture to picture, delight\nshining in their eyes. \u201cWonderful! They\u2019re so lush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nI know how to handle them,\u201d said Crowley, feeling very proud of himself. \u201cHave\nto keep them on their little grassy toes. Can\u2019t have them getting sloppy.\u201d He\ntucked his phone back in his pocket. \u201cI\u2019d like to have a greenhouse one day,\u201d\nhe offered.</p><p>\u201cMarvelous.\u201d\nRaphael smiled. \u201cYour compassion does you credit.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, getting horrible flashbacks from his second date. </p><p>\u201cOh,\nI don\u2019t mean to make you uncomfortable,\u201d said the archangel quickly. \u201cOnly it\nmust have been difficult to keep it after all you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfelt something soft and warm stretch out towards him. It was their aura, he realized\nwith a jolt. Raphael was reaching out with their aura. To offer\u2026comfort. To a\ndemon.</p><p>\u201cIt\ncan\u2019t image it\u2019s been easy for you,\u201d they said, voice low and soft.</p><p>Crowley\nfelt his mouth go dry. Something suspiciously like tears pricked at the back of\nhis eyes. \u201cNgk. I\u2019ve\u2014er.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cHeard good things about you.\u201d He flashed\nthe angel a nervous grin. \u201cI remember you were one of the reasonable ones.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nlaughed, a light airy sound like a wind chime. \u201cThank you. That is high\npraise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale\nspeaks highly of you,\u201d said Crowley carefully. He watched the angel\u2019s face,\nwaiting to see if any expression of annoyance or disgust would cross it. That\nwas his cue to manifest a purse and start shoving bread sticks into it.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s\neyes were fond. \u201cDid he? It\u2019s most kind of him. He speaks very highly of you as\nwell.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, his fork halfway to his mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s talked about me?\u201d</p><p>The\nangel seemed to misinterpret his tone. \u201cCrowley, you have nothing to fear.\nAziraphale would not betray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\u2014of\nbloody <i>course</i> not!\u201d spluttered the\ndemon, insulted. \u201cHe\u2019s my <i>friend!</i> He\nwould never\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\nknow. I know, Crowley,\u201d soothed Raphael. Crowley settled down, sending the\nangel an unfriendly look. \u201cI should explain myself. I am\u2026\u201d The archangel traced\nthe rim of their wine glass with slender fingers. \u201cSomething of a neutral force\nin Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\neyed them across the table. \u201cHow\u2019s that work then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nhumans started it. The Hippocratic oath. Commendable I thought. I devote myself\nto the care of my patients and to their keeping. It\u2019s not my business what they\nget up to. Or even what side they\u2019re on, as far as I care. I <i>heal</i>. I am not made for destruction, nor\ndo I have any desire to turn my hands to it. The normal rules of Heaven do not\napply in my infirmary. It would not be fair.\u201d Raphael smiled. \u201cI suppose you\ncould say, what happens in the infirmary <i>stays</i>\nin the infirmary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nMichael and all them are alright with it?\u201d</p><p>Something\nmischievous flashed in their eyes. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d </p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\nnot much they can do about it.\u201d Raphael\u2019s tone was almost smug. \u201cThe infirmary\nis <i>my</i> domain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice\none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\nthank you.\u201d</p><p>The\nsilence was more comfortable than it had been this time. Crowley ate his\ngnocchi, trying to savor the taste. A thought nagged at him, stealing away his\nappetite. He lowered his fork. </p><p>\u201cYou\nsaid Aziraphale spoke of me,\u201d he began slowly. Raphael nodded. \u201cSo. He was\u2014he\nwas in the infirmary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt\nthe time, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201c\nCrowley swallowed. \u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>It\nwas possible sometimes, that an angel or demon would sustain enough damage that\nthey had to go back Up (or Down) to recover from it. Occasionally the act of\ndiscorporation and the circumstances surrounding it would be damaging enough to\nleave them out of commission for some time. </p><p>Crowley\nhad <i>never</i> tried to harm Aziraphale.\nBut sometimes, early on\u2026there had been accidents. One hadn\u2019t known the other\nwas there, an angel getting caught off guard in a demon\u2019s wiles, a demon catching\nthe wrong end of a divine thwarting, simply by unlucky chance at being in the\nwrong place at the wrong time. It had happened. It was a large part of their\nmaking the Arrangement. If they knew where the other was, there wouldn\u2019t be any\nmore accidents. No one would get <i>hurt.</i></p><p>A\ncool hand covered his own, thin and long. Utterly unlike Aziraphale\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\nBe at peace. You were not responsible. Knowingly or otherwise.\u201d Crowley let out\na long breath. \u201cAziraphale had a brush with a place of particularly strong\ninfernal taint some two-thousand years ago. It took him some weeks to recover.\nAll he spoke of was how sorry he was to miss out on dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed a little shakily. \u201cYeah. Yeah, that\u2019s my angel. Never would pass up a\ngood meal.\u201d</p><p>The\nangel withdrew their hand. They gave him a significant look. \u201cI suspect it was\nthe company, if I may be so bold to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGossipy,\naren\u2019t you angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\nhave to get up to something. Outright violence isn\u2019t really an option to us.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. </p><p>\u201cHe\ncares for you very much,\u201d continued Raphael. \u201cAziraphale. All the while he was\nin my care, it wasn\u2019t anything I was doing that helped him recover. It was\ntalking about <i>you</i>, and doing\neverything he could to get better so he could back and see you again.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfelt his face heating up in a wild blush. \u201cThat\u2019s the most cheesy thing I\u2019ve\never heard. You\u2019re making that up!\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nsmiled. \u201cPerhaps I exaggerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nthinking of you brought him such comfort. I know this. It\u2019s what I am made\nfor.\u201d</p><p>While\na large part of Crowley was happy to roll about insensibly in happiness, a\nsmaller more suspicious part was asking the important questions. </p><p>\u201cWhy\nare you telling me this?\u201d He watched the angel carefully. \u201cAre you\u2026<i>tempting</i> me into a relationship with\nhim?<i> I</i> am the expert at temptation.\nYou can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith\nall due respect, I don\u2019t think I need to.\u201d Crowley made an offended sound. They\nwere right though, <i>bless</i> them. \u201cIt\u2019s\nvery clear to me that you both care for each other a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nadmitted Crowley after a moment. Then he took off his sunglasses and met the\narchangel\u2019s gaze directly. \u201cIf we do this, if he and I are together\u2014<i>properly</i>\u2014will he\u2026\u201d he took a breath. \u201cWill\nhe be Punished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\nhas made it very clear\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cThis\nisn\u2019t about Adam,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen when and if\nAdam dies\u2014this is about Heaven. <i>Please</i>.\nI have to know. Will being with me cause him harm? I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d he swallowed, a\nlump forming in his throat. \u201cI won\u2019t have that.\u201d<br></p><p>Oh\nhe <i>wanted</i> Aziraphale, he wanted to be\nnear him, to make him laugh and scoff, to wake up next to him every day and\nmake a nuisance of himself while he was trying to read. But if his affection\nwould be the cause of punishment, then\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo\nCrowley.\u201d Raphael looked at him solemnly across the table. \u201cHe won\u2019t. Heaven\nhas decided to leave Aziraphale alone.\u201d</p><p>He\nshot Raphael a hard look. \u201cAnd if they change their minds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\nwould be a trial, and a vote, and I can promise you enough of us either don\u2019t\ncare what Aziraphale does, or will side in his favor simply to annoy Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlet out a shaky breath. \u201cPromise me you will speak up for him if it happens. <i>Please.</i> If there\u2019s anything I can do,\nanything I can offer you, I will, just\u2014please. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse,\u201d said Raphael, brow creasing. \u201cCrowley, of <i>course</i> I\u2019ll look out for him. You need give me nothing.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfelt as if a great weight had been taken off his shoulders. He took a moment to\ncompose himself. \u201cThank you,\u201d he managed, dizzy from it.</p><p>Raphael\nwatched him, respect and admiration clear on their face.\u201cI am glad to have met\nyou, Crowley. You are truly a remarkable soul. Such compassion. Such love\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nyeah.\u201d Like he\u2019d never heard that before. Crowley crossed his legs, slouching\ndown in his seat more comfortably. \u201cDon\u2019t spread it around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nwould have made a remarkable angel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nsniffed, wiping a speck of lint off his shirt*.\u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a\nremarkable demon.\u201d</p><p>*It\nwasn\u2019t there before, but he had wanted it to be, and so it had.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s\neyes were very fond. \u201cYes. That too. But you would have made quite the healer.\nShould you ever need help, should Hell ever set their wiles against you, know\nthat you can call for me. I will look out for you.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, his wine glass half way to his mouth. He took a large gulp, hand shaking\nslightly. He put it down heavily. \u201cUrm. Ye..ah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa\nha. Ha.\u201d He picked up his glass and took a large gulp.</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\nThe archangel leaned in. \u201cI am in earnest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa?\nUgh\u2026ngk. Why?\u201d Crowley asked in a small confused voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause\nyou have so much love in you. Because you have been so loyal for so long to the\none you love. And because I can see the damage Hell has caused you.\u201d They\nsmiled sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s rent across the fabric of your soul in a terrible scar. Yet\nyou still have such compassion. It\u2019s remarkable.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s\nmind was racing, a dizzying feeling of embarrassment, indignity and panic at\nbeing picked apart washing over him. A part of him was flattered and welcomed\nthe praise. Another part was simply very, very tired.</p><p>Why\ncouldn\u2019t he just be accepted as himself?</p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d\ncontinued Raphael gently. \u201cShould you ever decide to return to Heaven, know\nthat I will speak for you. No harm will befall you, should you wish to return.\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon was still for a long moment. Then he let out a breath, only a little bit\nshaky. He put his sunglasses back on, and gave Raphael a winning smile, only a\nlittle bit wobbly. \u201cNot really my scene. Heaven. Never could follow orders very\nwell. Besides,\u201d he shrugged, feeling more himself again. \u201cIt cramped my style.\u201d</p><p>A\nslow smile stretched across the archangel\u2019s face. \u201cA terrible thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nis.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\ndo seem happy down here. On earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\nno where I\u2019d rather be,\u201d said Crowley honestly. </p><p>Raphael\nstared at him. \u201cYou really mean that.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nflushed and fidgeted with his napkin. \u201cEr. Yeah. Where else can I drive my\nBentley anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nI am glad for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nleaned back, a pensive look coming into their eyes. \u201cI admire earth, but can\u2019t\nreally say I care for it. Not in the way you do. Happily my interests have always\nbeen more contained to my practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\nGlad that worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\nBut should things ever change, my offer still stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\nThanks.\u201d Crowley squirmed at the sincerity. \u201cNo really, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\npleasure.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>The\nstreets of Soho were busy tonight, people bustling about, the thin layer of\nsnow laying over the rooftops and streets adding a serene look to the place.</p><p>Aziraphale\nwalked briskly, mind racing.</p><p>A\npart of him that had enjoyed that. Aziraphale didn\u2019t want to dwell on it, nor\ndid he want to think about the small part of him that was flattered at the\nattention.</p><p>He\nfilled the information away under \u2018Just In Case\u2019, shut the metaphorical drawer\nand locked it, and focused on the epiphany looming ahead of him.</p><p>The\nbookshop door closed behind Aziraphale. He heaved a deep sigh and held out his\nhand, catching the new quiz as it materialized before him.</p><p>The\nlast one.</p><p>A\nfeeling of indignity rose up in him.</p><p>He\ndidn\u2019t want to wait another day to see Crowley. They <i>deserved</i> to matched.</p><p>And\nAziraphale was going to see to it that they did.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nstepped into his flat, too preoccupied to notice how his plants straightened up at\nhis presence. </p><p>Raphael\nhad been understanding. Alarmingly so. But he was tired, so tired of everyone\ncalling him an anomaly, pointing out how different he was, how good of an angel\nhe <i>could</i> have been. As if there was something tragic about him as he was. As if\nhe were incomplete.</p><p>He\njust wanted to be with the one person who cared for him as he was, who knew\nevery part of him and liked him for it.</p><p>Maybe\neven <i>loved</i> him.</p><p>With\na flash, the quiz materialized in front of him. He caught it, glaring down at\nthe pink pages.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nplayed by your rules,\u201d he told it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m done with that.\u201d</p><p>Adam\nwanted them to answer this thing honestly, right?</p><p>He\u2019d\nbloody well give it honesty. He\u2019d tell it <i>exactly</i>\nwhat he wanted and wouldn\u2019t leave room for it to give him anything less.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\ntapped his pen against the paper, reading over the quiz.</p><p>\u201cPreferences,\nhere we go.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to put down some deal breakers.\nLet\u2019s see\u2026must own a car. That\u2019s important\u2026a vintage one, let\u2019s say. Oh, how\nabout a black 1926 Bentley. Custom made. With a cassette player.\u201d He underlined the next\npart. \u201c<i>Only</i> plays Queen\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll\nneed to be well read.\u201d Crowley scribbled it down on the answer sheet. \u201cIt\u2019s all\nright if they don\u2019t know all their media but they\u2019ve got to know their books.\nAnd own a bookshop in Soho, London. Have owned it for over three hundred years. Erratic opening hours. Refuses to let anyone buy anything\u2026\u201d <br></p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cMust\nhave an affinity with snakes, I really can\u2019t stand someone who doesn\u2019t\nappreciate them! Dresses sharply, sunglasses I think. Owns a sketch of the Mona\nLisa\u2026and an embarrassing statue of an angel and demon \u2018wrestling\u2019, can\u2019t forget\nthat. Has many fancy appliances, <i>none</i>\nof them plugged in. And a terrified yet very lush collection of houseplants.\u201d Aziraphale smiled. \u201cA gentle soul, but a sharp wit and\njust the right kind of humor. I want someone that makes me think, but respects\nme for who I am\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cMust\ndress like an outdated professor.\u201d A grin split Crowley\u2019s face. \u201cA <i>gay </i>professor, with flamboyant cravats\nand terrible tartan everywhere\u2026 Must have experience with a sword. Knows how\nto gavotte. Owns a complete collection of the infamous bibles, and a signed\nfirst edition of <i>The Portrait of Dorian\nGrey</i>, with a long personal note from the author addressed to them, specifically.\u201d </p><p>He\npaused and really thought for a moment. \u201cI won\u2019t have anyone unkind. They have\nto mean well, even if they\u2019re a little absent minded. I want someone strong and\nsoft, someone that will let me blather on at four in the morning when I\u2019m off\nmy head. Someone patient and understanding\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nwho won\u2019t take my introversion as disinterest. Someone I can just <i>be</i> with, without having to be anything,\nor do anything. Someone who can see past my faults but won\u2019t hesitate to tell\nme when I\u2019m being obtuse\u2026\u201d Aziraphale trailed off. \u201cSomeone who won\u2019t let me\nfall,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t judge me if I did.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nwho will be my friend, no matter what form I take. Someone who\u2019s never been\nafraid of me, who can see my worth and not want me to be anything else.\u201d Crowley\nfilled out his quiz, ticking off boxes without mind for how he came off. \u201cI\nneed someone I can talk to. Someone I can relate to. That\u2019s what really\nmatters. So I think the big deal breaker here\u2014\u201c</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis an absolute Must, with No Exceptions, is\u2014\u201c</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cThat\nthey must\u2014\u201c</p><p>xxx</p><p>\u201cLove\u2014\u201c</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cEarth.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cEarth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Aziraphale looked over his answers. \u201cYes, that should do nicely.\u201d</p><p>He\nsat back and smiled to himself.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nI <i>wonder</i> who I\u2019ll be matched with?\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cAnd\nthat\u2019s my final word on the matter!\u201d said Crowley grandly, finishing the quiz\nwith a flourish.</p><p>He\nhad a feeling he would enjoy his next date immensely. </p><p><i>Whoever</i> he got, of course. <br></p>",

They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2014</p><p>It was a bright chilly morning in\nlower Tadfield. Adam was giving Dog one last pat down before cycling off to\nschool when he heard someone calling his name.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d</p><p>The boy turned, watching a\nharassed looking Aziraphale land at the foot of the driveway, wings out and\nmessy. The angel took a moment to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cHullo Aziraphale,\u201d he greeted\ncheerfully. \u201cHow\u2019s the dating going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s\u2014erm. Look.\u201d There was\nsomething desperate in his eyes. \u201cAbout this match. It\u2019s\u2026I don\u2019t. I really <i>really</i> don\u2019t think this will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s\n<i>Gabriel!</i> I can\u2019t\u2014this must be a joke,\nthere\u2019s no way I could have matched with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nyou did match with him,\u201d said Adam innocently.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014I\u2014I\ncan\u2019t have! He\u2019s awful. And have you seen what he <i>wears?</i>* Ghastly!\u201d The angel looked wretched at the thought of it.</p><p>*Gabriel\ndressed like he was on the cover of a glossy, highly conservative fashion\nmagazine featuring lean, muscular men in dull neutral-coloured business attire,\nand radiating an almost tangible air of <i>no\nhomo</i> in a mile radius around. It made Aziraphale want to clutch at his\nbright paisley bow-tie in horror.</p><p>Adam\ntook pity on him. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m sorry. You were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d</p><p>Adam\ngrinned sheepishly. \u201cJust wanted to see if you really didn\u2019t get along or if\nyou just liked fighting.\u201d Aziraphale gaped at him. \u201cI would have gone through\nwith it, but Gabriel\u2019s already come by to complain, and ugh. Yeah, I can see\nwhy you don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s a right tosser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh thank you. So, I don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo\nno. He\u2019s been matched with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nthank goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d\nAdam waved his hand. Aziraphale caught the pink booklet as it materialized and\nfluttered down towards him. \u201cThere\u2019s the real results. But you have to go with\nwhoever you get this time, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nyes of course,\u201d agreed Aziaphale, so relieved he would have agreed to just\nabout anything.</p><p>\u201cCheer\nup! Only two more to go!\u201d Adam picked up his bike and slung a leg over it,\nhoisting himself onto the seat.</p><p>\u201cRight.\nThank you, dear boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee\nyou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nwatched the boy turn onto the road and cycle off into the town.</p><p>He\nlet out a long breath, the new results of the quiz held in his hand.</p><p>Last\nnight he had dared to hope he would be matched with Crowley. The more he\nthought on it, the more he felt terribly foolish for not thinking of it before.\nOf <i>course</i> he should be matched with\nCrowley. Hadn\u2019t they already chosen each other, in so many little ways throughout all\ntheir long history together?</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas in love with him. </p><p>He\nhad never wanted for a romantic relationship because just being in Crowley\u2019s\ncompany had been everything he had wanted.</p><p>Or\nso he had thought.</p><p>But\nnow the subject had been brought up, now that romance and candles and such\nunspeakable intimacies as <i>hand holding</i>\nand <i>snuggling</i> had been brought into\nlight\u2026oh, to have <i>that</i> with Crowley?</p><p>It\nwas dizzying to think of how badly he wanted it.</p><p>The\ntrouble was, he wasn\u2019t sure if Crowley felt the same. He had\u2026something of a\nhunch. He dearly hoped he was correct and that he hadn\u2019t been reading his\ndearest friend wrong these last few days.</p><p>It\nwas absolutely ridiculous they hadn\u2019t matched before, come to think of it. He\nand Crowley were\u2026it just felt so <i>right</i>.\nSurely they would match now?</p><p>Aziraphale\nlooked down at the quiz.</p><p>Even\nif it wasn\u2019t Crowley, it couldn\u2019t be worse than Gabriel, he reasoned.</p><p>Then\nhe saw who he had matched with.</p><p>He\nspluttered.</p><p>Maybe,\njust maybe, it could be worse than Gabriel.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nlay face-down on his sofa, bemoaning his woes incoherently to his plants. His\nsoul music collection was blasting loud enough to shake the walls and disturb\nthe neighbors. As he didn\u2019t feel like having upset neighbours banging on\nhis door, they simply didn\u2019t hear it.</p><p>The\npink quiz lay crumpled on the floor where it had been banished some hours\nearlier.</p><p>He\nhadn\u2019t got Aziraphale.</p><p>Of\nbloody course he hadn\u2019t. That was just how things went, didn\u2019t they, he thought\nbitterly, in an uncharacteristic bout of pessimism. </p><p>The\nmore reasonable voice in his head (which sounded suspiciously like Aziraphale)\nsaid that of <i>course</i> he had Aziraphale\n(<i>dear boy</i>). They\u2019d had each other for\na very long time, hadn\u2019t they? </p><p>It\nwas just all this dating toss up had blown something loose, rattled up their\nold routine and put things properly in perspective.</p><p>He\nwas in love with Aziraphale. </p><p>Had\nbeen, likely, for centuries, millennia even, little by little, sauntering into it\nas gradually and as naturally as breathing*.</p><p>*Which wasn\u2019t natural at all to occult and ethereal beings. It was a choice, a habit they had picked up and adopted so thoroughly that stopping it felt <i>bad</i> and wrong instinctively.<br></p><p>He\nhad good reason to believe it may be reciprocated.</p><p>What\nCrowley wanted right now was to call Aziraphale up, go over and just <i>be</i> with the angel. Or at least spend the\nday sprawled around his apartment processing everything and getting\nincreasingly giddy with the force of his epiphany.\u00a0 <br></p><p>What\nhe had to do was go on a date with an archangel.</p><p>It\nmade him want to crawl under his couch cushions and curl up into a ball for a good week.</p><p>Adam\nhad been very clear that there was to be no fighting or discorportaing\nwhatsoever over the course of the dates.</p><p>Easy\nfor him to say. Crowley didn\u2019t think it would count as a fight if an archangel wanted\nto do away with him. It would be like an ant getting blasted with a laser\ntorpedo. Not much of a fight at all.</p><p>He\ngroaned into the cushioned padding of the couch.</p><p>Maybe\nit wouldn\u2019t be so bad? <br></p><p>He\nwould bloody<i> </i>well survive it just to see Aziraphale again at the other side.</p><p>Crowley\nwanted to see Aziraphale <i>now</i>. <br></p><p>He didn\u2019t\nwant to wait for two days, didn\u2019t want to hazard through two more dates when he\ncould be spending time with his angel. Maybe even confessing his feelings and\nbeing confessed to in return\u2026</p><p>With\na dramatic sigh he heaved himself off the couch, slumping over to his closet.</p><p>At\nleast he was getting dinner out of this one. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>It was one of the very best and\nmost expensive sushi restaurants in London. Aziraphale had insisted on the\nlocation this time. If things went badly, he at least wanted to get a nice meal\nout of it.</p><p>So far the food had not\ndisappointed. Aziraphale wore his favourite tweed coat and warmest tartan scarf\nas emotional armour. The green carnation Crowley had given him last night had\nbeen tucked safely into his button hole, migrating to the pocket of his shirt\nnow he was inside.</p><p>Its presence was a great comfort\nto him as he tried his best not to make eye contact with the form across from\nhim, valiantly focusing on eating pieces of maki spider roll as precisely and\nas viciously as he could.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let his guard down.</p><p>\u201cMore zake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said the angel,\nstiffly.</p><p>His date watched him, something\nlow and dangerous in his eyes like hellfire. The demon was eating food, or at\nleast putting it in his mouth. What exactly happened after that was anyone\u2019s\nguess, but there was a faint sound of buzzing and wailing at a register just\nunder what any human could hear.</p><p>\u201cZo. You\u2019re looking well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could say the same.\u201d He\nwouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s nails rapped against\nthe table.</p><p>\u201cYou were a Cherub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, revealing too many rows\nof too long teeth. \u201cI\ndo remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d\nAziraphale took a calculated sip of his sake. \u201cFrom the apocalypse. Yes. Not so\nlong ago, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom\nbefore,\u201d said Beelzebub.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nafraid you\u2019ll have to be a bit more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Before</i>.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nblinked. \u201cBefore\u2014the <i>Fall?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuzt\nzo.\u201d </p><p>The\nangel froze.</p><p>Something\nstrange crept into Beelzebub\u2019s eyes. Stranger than whatever it was they\nnormally did. \u201cYou were kind to me. Not many were.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly,\nthe angel felt the sake going to his head in a dizzying rush of panic and\nconfusion. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwaz only a lowly Power at the time,\u201d Beelzebub continued, voice soft. \u201cNot many\ncared about how I felt. There waz only Luzifer.\u201d His eyes sharpened. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared a little desperately. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYez.\nYou did not know me. But you ztopped to talk. To cheer me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh</i>.\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\nfelt as if his life were flashing before his eyes. It was such a long time ago.\nBut he did remember. Oh yes, little bits and pieces, coming back as he tried to\ngrasp at them. </p><p>A\nPower, downtrodden and ridiculed for believing that angels shouldn\u2019t be cast\naside in favour of humans. He had seemed so brokenhearted, sitting there all\nalone. Aziraphale remembered coming over to him, telling him gently that he\ndidn\u2019t really understand why God thought humans were so important either, but\nthere must be something to it. </p><p>And\nthen\u2026oh. </p><p>Oh\ndear. </p><p>He\nremembered saying some unsavory things about Gabriel, about how he and Michael\nwere a bit vicious when expressing their opinions, weren\u2019t they? There was no\nneed for all that holier-than-thou attitude, it was ridiculous! It had made the\npoor Power laugh, which is what he had been going for, and then Aziraphale had\npatted him on the back and told him to take care, and hadn\u2019t thought on it\nsince. </p><p>Thousands\nof years later, Aziraphale clutched his napkin in his lap desperately and\nstared at Beelzebub across from him.</p><p>The\narch-demon was smiling, sharp teeth flashing as his mouth stretched unnaturally\nwide.</p><p>\u201cI\nwas mozt dizzapointed when you did not join uz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nwould have done well az a demon. I would have zeen to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\nSorry to disappoint.\u201d</p><p>Something\nsoftened in the arch-demon\u2019s gaze, something nearly vulnerable stealing across his\nfeatures. \u201cI looked for you. After the Fall.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nlaughed nervously. Then he stopped. Silently, he lowered his emphatic\nshielding. </p><p>This\nwas not something he did often. On earth there were so many emotions\neverywhere, so many people feeling so many things, everywhere you turned was a\nnew crisis, another injustice, another soul in torment. It was simply too much\nto feel all the time. No angel could ever hope to help every soul in need,\nnever mind non-interference orders from Above. </p><p>Aziraphale\nhad been on earth for six-thousand years. It was shield himself or go mad from\nit. He sometimes suspected he went too far, could be too impassive to those in\nneed, too quick to turn away. But he\u2019d bloody well like to see any of them give\nit a go without developing unconventional coping mechanisms*.</p><p>*Like\nlocking himself in his bookshop for a week and re-reading the entire <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i> until he\u2019d\nblocked out the latest atrocity he hadn\u2019t the slightest chance of stopping. It\nwas a delicate game of guilt, avoidance and planned ignorance, all for the cause\nof warding off any creeping despair.</p><p>Bracing\nhimself, he reached out with his aura and allowed himself to feel what was\ncoming off of Beelzebub.</p><p>He\nchoked.</p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t exactly affection. It wasn\u2019t <i>not</i>\naffection either. There was respect, even admiration. Something else, something\nmuch more complicated hovering between pride and frustration and just a touch\nof smug avarice.</p><p>Beelzebub\u2019s\nsmile widened.</p><p>Aziraphale\nwithdrew his aura as if it he had been burned. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nserous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\noffer ztandz. You could do very well for yourzelf in Hell.\u201d</p><p>The\nangel drew himself up importantly. \u201cI rather think I have done well for\nmyself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhave a backbone. Not many do. We need more of them in Hell.\u201d He grinned. \u201cNot\njuzt the onez we rip out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\nThat sounds like your problem right there? Counter productive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\nZee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\nhas their own set of principals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\ndizobeyed direct orderz from Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nfrowned. \u201cAh yez. Crawly.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley</i>, thank you.\u201d He glared at the\ndemon. \u201cReally, what kind of arch-demon can\u2019t remember the names of those\nworking for them?</p><p>\n\u201cI do not pretend to underztand your attraction to him. You could do zo much\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re offering,\u201d said Azirphale, something sharp and\nflaming and furious glinting behind his eyes. \u201cBut if you ever even <i>think</i> of hurting Crowley you will be\nvery sorry.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nsat back in his seat, a deep buzzing laugh rumbling inside his chest, like a\nnest of bees that had been hit with a stick. \u201cAh, they don\u2019t know what they\nhave in you Upztairs. I can offer you zo much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\nthank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBothersome,\nisn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\nnize offize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nquite fond of my own, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll\nthe bookz you could ever want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\nthat all you have to offer?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cLook. I don\u2019t want power. I don\u2019t\nwant an office, and certainly not one in Hell. And books?\u201d The angel gestured.\n\u201cWhat better place to get them than on earth? And anyway, half the fun is in\ncollecting them. No, you\u2019ve nothing to offer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhave potential as a demon. You could be <i>zo</i>\npowerful. Ruthlezz. Zelfizh. Gluttonuz. You know you have theze qualitiez.\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\ngaze didn\u2019t waver. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cI\u2019m not the most\nvirtuous angel. But if I\u2019ve learned anything from earth, it\u2019s that knowing and\ndoing are very different things. I have potential for doing terrible things,\nyes. But so does everyone. It comes down to what we choose to do. And I will\nmake my own choices.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nsat back in his chair. He crossed his arms, a deeply pensive look coming into\nhis eyes. \u201cHmm.\u201d The faint buzzing sound got louder.</p><p>Aziraphale\ntook advantage of this to polish off the last of the unagi rolls, smearing them\nwith wasabi and dipping them liberally in soy sauce. He was carting off most of\nthe dragon roll to his own plate when Beelzebub stirred.</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\n</p><p>Azirphale\nlooked up sharply. Beelzebub was watching him, a smile oozing across his face. <br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019z\nit. That\u2019z what you want, izn\u2019t it?\u201d The demon leaned forward. \u201cI can give him\nto you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley\ncould be yourz. For all eternity. No one could contezt it. <br></p><p>Aziraphale\nlowered his chopsticks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you say you would <i>give</i> me Crowley?\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nopened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou mean that you think Crowley is something you can just <i>give</i> me, and I\u2019d be happy with that?\u201d Aziraphale demanded,\nploughing right over him. \u201cYou are absolutely wrong! There is nothing\u2014\u201c he\njabbed a chopstick at the demon\u2014 \u201c<i>nothing</i>,\nI want from Crowley that you can <i>make</i>\nhim give me. What I want from Crowley is only what he is willing to\ngive\u2014freely! Of his own accord! No blackmail, no threatening, nothing! Do you\nunderstand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\n<i>hmm</i>. And don\u2019t you go threatening him\nin my presence! Don\u2019t threaten him at all! In fact you\u2019d better back right\noff\u2014and have your lackeys do so as well\u2014I won\u2019t have any of you bothering him\nand forcing him to do things he hates! You\u2019ll leave him well enough alone, do you\nhear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\nreally doez make you zo happy?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\npaused in his angry tirade. \u201cYes. Oh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cVery much.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nBeelzebub grumbled unhappily. \u201cZo long az he makez you happy Hell will leave\nhim alone.\u201d The arch-demon held his hand out across that table. The fingers\nended in claw-like nails. \u201cA favour for a favour. For what you did for me before.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cYe\u2014hang\non.\u201d Aziraphale glared. \u201cOho. <i>No</i>. I\ndon\u2019t <i>think</i> so. Nice try. As long as\nhe makes me happy, you say.\u201d The angel sat back and crossed his arms. \u201cNo. I\u2019m\nafraid that won\u2019t do at all. You do not bother Crowley <i>whatsoever</i>.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\ngrowled. \u201cBut if he doezn\u2019t make you happy\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter if he makes me miserable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo!\nNo buts! I don\u2019t care what terrible deeds he does in any hypothetical\nsituation, you are to leave him well and alone, you understand?\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nstared at him. Aziraphale felt his aura being sized up, examined, checked\nthoroughly for any resistance or weakness of will. There was none. Aziraphale\nhad realized exactly how much Crowley meant to him, everything had clicked\nfully into place.</p><p>His\nwill was as stone.</p><p>The\narch-demon pulled back, something about his expression softening. A small smile\ntugged at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHell\nwill not bother or punizh Crowley,\u201d he said. </p><p>Beelzebub\nheld out his hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nyou won\u2019t get any humans to do it either,\u201d said Aziraphale suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\nany danger does befall him, it\u2019s <i>me</i>\nwho\u2019ll come looking for names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwould expect no lezz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\nWell then. We have an understanding.\u201d</p><p>He\ngrasped Beelzebub\u2019s hand.</p><p>The\narch-demon\u2019s hand clasped about his own, hard, vice-like, but careful not to\nhurt.</p><p>\u201cCrowley\ncomes to no harm from the forzes of Hell or from our influenzes,\u201d said the\ndemon.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Unlezz</i>,\u201d Beelzebub stressed, angry\nbuzzing rising from deep in his chest. \u201cUnlezz,\u201d he continued before Aziraphale\ncould object, \u201cYou perzonally azk me to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwould <i>never!</i> Unless\u2014<i>ohh</i>, don\u2019t you go and try to get me\npossessed. It won\u2019t work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder\nyour own power. No pozzezzion. No coerzing. No blackmail. And no Heavenly\ninterfearenze. Only your own will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\nis not going to happen!\u201d cried the angel, trying to twist his hand out of the\ndemon\u2019s grasp. It was held too firmly.</p><p>\u201cThen\nit zhouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwon\u2019t be a problem because I won\u2019t agree to it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nthere iz no deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\n<i>bugger</i> you then! Let go of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill\nyou lizten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill\nyou let go of my hand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\nZtop.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizten.\nPleaze.\u201d</p><p>It\nwas the please that did him in. Oddly sincere. It caught him off guard. He\nhuffed angrily, giving his hand one last petulant pull. He glared at the demon,\nquietly trying to set him aflame with his Will. The slight amusement in\nBeelzebub\u2019s eyes told him he was severely outclassed in that endeavor. Bugger.</p><p>\u201cLet\ngo of me,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cThiz\nfirzt.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nhuffed again. He stopped trying to extract his hand and just focused on getting\nhis breathing under control. \u201cI\u2019m not agreeing to anything if it puts Crowley in\ndanger,\u201d he said, emotion choking his voice. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nam not azking you to,\u201d said the arch-demon quietly. \u201cAz much az it painz me to\nzay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cLet\nme do thiz. Crowley will only come to harm if you exprezzively tell me you want\nhim to be. That iz the only condition. He will be zafe otherwize. Thiz I\nzwear.\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\nglared at him. \u201cHow do I know I can trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t. I zupoze. Do you think you can truzt me?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nsent out his aura, raked the demon with it, searching for any trace of treachery,\nany loophole sniggering at him from the shadows. He found none. He pulled back,\nstaring at the demon warily.</p><p>\u201cI\n<i>damn</i> well hope you\u2019re not lying. For\nyour sake. You would do well to remember that I am a Guardian. I was made to\nprotect. And I can promise you I <i>will</i>.\u201d <br></p><p>Beelzebub\nsmiled widely, all his long, sharp teeth gleaming in the lamplight. \u201cYou are\nwazted on Heaven,\u201d he said warmly.</p><p>Aziraphale\nsniffed. \u201cI\u2019m done with Heaven. I want nothing to do with either side.\u201d He\nwriggled his fingers in the demon\u2019s hold. \u201cA favour for a favour then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\nit iz done.\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nshook his hand, then released it. Aziraphale snatched it back, rubbing his\nwrist mistrustfully. It wasn\u2019t bruised at all, to his surprise. Not even reddened.\n</p><p>He\nsniffed. \u201cYes. Well.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDezzert?\u201d\noozed the demon.</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know that I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\nhave fried ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\nMaybe a taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\niz on me.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\neyes narrowed. \u201cOh no. We\u2019re even now. I won\u2019t have myself falling into your\ndebt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleaze.\nAllow me. For the enjoyable converzation. It iz not everyday zomeone talkz back\nto me.

I do not forget favourz.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\nnarrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\nyou ever tire of earth or need zhelter from Heaven\u2026azk for me. I will zee you\nare comfortable.\u201d</p><p>He\nstiffened. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuzt\nthe zame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare stubborn, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Amusement\nglowed in Beelzebub\u2019s eyes. \u201cI am uzed to getting my way, yez. And you are no\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d Aziraphale\nresisted the urge to stick his tongue out at the demon. He was\u2026being\nsurprisingly sincere. It was jarring. \u201cThank\nyou,\u201d he said stiffly. Then he waved his chopstick at the demon. \u201cThough it <i>won\u2019t</i> come up, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourze not,\u201d Beelzebub said indulgently. \u201cBut juzt in caze.\u201d </p><p>The\ndemon smiled at him across the table, no hint of malice in his eyes at all.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSo,\ner\u2026\u201d </p><p>Crowley\nwas floundering. He was in one of the higher end Italian restaurants of London.\nHe\u2019d been here before. Home turf advantage was his, and for that he was\ngrateful. </p><p>He felt woefully unprepared.</p><p>He\u2019d\nput on his favourite sleek button-down shirt, forgone any shoes (just his very\nown scales would do) and shrugged into one of Aziraphale\u2019s cardigans he had\nswiped from the angel and hidden away in his closet. It was a warm, chunky\nknit, soft from decades of wear, and patterned with argyle. A row of knitted\nducks made their way around its middle. It was far too big on him. Crowley\nloved it.</p><p>Even\nwith his angel\u2019s cardigan, he still struggled to make eye contact with the\narchangel across from him. </p><p>\u201cYou\nrun Heaven\u2019s infirmary, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nRaphael sat calmly across the table from him, taking even bites of their Capesante.\n\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nhad never bothered with the concept of genders and seemed quite at home in an\nambiguous body, wearing a long cream-coloured shift tied round the waist. They\nlooked a bit like an elf, with the long, elegant limbs and flowing, silvery\nhair. And elf, or a vampire that never got the goth memo.</p><p>\u201cRight.\nAnd, uh,\u201d Crowley cast about for something to say. \u201cHow\u2019s that been working\nout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ncan\u2019t complain. I\u2019m largely left alone to do as I please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d\nsaid Crowley desperately. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014nice.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nwas staring at him. They had been since they\u2019d met, in a slow, thoughtful sort\nof way of a person trying to place something. On a human it might have been a\nbit odd, but not unnerving. On an <i>archangel</i>\u2026\n</p><p>Crowley\nrubbed his feet together under the table and grabbed up his wine glass, taking\na sip and wondering how quickly he could shovel his gnocchi into his mouth and\nrun off without insulting them.</p><p>You\ndid <i>not</i> want to insult an archangel*.</p><p>*Unless\nyou were Aziraphale and the archangel was Gabriel. Because Gabriel was a\nbastard and deserved what he got.</p><p>\u201cYou\nworked in the garden.\u201d </p><p>Raphael\u2019s\nvoice was smooth and melodious. If you listened very carefully you could hear\nit threaded with the sound of tiny silvery bells and what may have been a\nbamboo flute, calming and soothing like a stream.</p><p>The\neffect was lost on Crowley, who choked on his wine, managing to lower his glass\nwithout spilling as he spluttered. \u201cMngk?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nwas unruffled. \u201cYou tended the gardens in the fourth sphere.\u201d They sat back in\ntheir seat, features softening in satisfaction. \u201cI remember now.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nblinked behind his sunglasses. Bless <i>someone</i>.\nThe gardens. That was a very long time ago. He hadn\u2019t thought about his pre-Fall\ndays in ages.</p><p>\u201cEh\nheh.\u201d He tried to surreptitiously wipe his mouth. \u201cYe-yeah.\u201d</p><p>A\ngentle smiled crossed Raphael\u2019s face. \u201cYou grew the most beautiful flowers. I\nwas especially fond of the orchids. Do you still keep it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\nIt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing\nthings. Plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMnn\u2026yeah.\nHah. A bit. I\u2019ve\u2026got a few plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you any pictures of them?\u201d asked Raphael, looking very interested.</p><p>\u201cOh\nyeah, loads.\u201d Crowley dug out his phone hastily, nearly dropping it in his\nnervousness. He opened one of his favourite plant albums and leaned over the\ntable with it. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\npeered down at the screen eagerly. They swiped from picture to picture, delight\nshining in their eyes. \u201cWonderful! They\u2019re so lush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nI know how to handle them,\u201d said Crowley, feeling very proud of himself. \u201cHave\nto keep them on their little grassy toes. Can\u2019t have them getting sloppy.\u201d He\ntucked his phone back in his pocket. \u201cI\u2019d like to have a greenhouse one day,\u201d\nhe offered.</p><p>\u201cMarvelous.\u201d\nRaphael smiled. \u201cYour compassion does you credit.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, getting horrible flashbacks from his second date. </p><p>\u201cOh,\nI don\u2019t mean to make you uncomfortable,\u201d said the archangel quickly. \u201cOnly it\nmust have been difficult to keep it after all you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfelt something soft and warm stretch out towards him. It was their aura, he realized\nwith a jolt. Raphael was reaching out with their aura. To offer\u2026comfort. To a\ndemon.</p><p>\u201cIt\ncan\u2019t image it\u2019s been easy for you,\u201d they said, voice low and soft.</p><p>Crowley\nfelt his mouth go dry. Something suspiciously like tears pricked at the back of\nhis eyes. \u201cNgk. I\u2019ve\u2014er.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cHeard good things about you.\u201d He flashed\nthe angel a nervous grin. \u201cI remember you were one of the reasonable ones.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nlaughed, a light airy sound like a wind chime. \u201cThank you. That is high\npraise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale\nspeaks highly of you,\u201d said Crowley carefully. He watched the angel\u2019s face,\nwaiting to see if any expression of annoyance or disgust would cross it. That\nwas his cue to manifest a purse and start shoving bread sticks into it.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s\neyes were fond. \u201cDid he? It\u2019s most kind of him. He speaks very highly of you as\nwell.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, his fork halfway to his mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s talked about me?\u201d</p><p>The\nangel seemed to misinterpret his tone. \u201cCrowley, you have nothing to fear.\nAziraphale would not betray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\u2014of\nbloody <i>course</i> not!\u201d spluttered the\ndemon, insulted. \u201cHe\u2019s my <i>friend!</i> He\nwould never\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\nknow. I know, Crowley,\u201d soothed Raphael. Crowley settled down, sending the\nangel an unfriendly look. \u201cI should explain myself. I am\u2026\u201d The archangel traced\nthe rim of their wine glass with slender fingers. \u201cSomething of a neutral force\nin Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\neyed them across the table. \u201cHow\u2019s that work then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nhumans started it. The Hippocratic oath. Commendable I thought. I devote myself\nto the care of my patients and to their keeping. It\u2019s not my business what they\nget up to. Or even what side they\u2019re on, as far as I care. I <i>heal</i>. I am not made for destruction, nor\ndo I have any desire to turn my hands to it. The normal rules of Heaven do not\napply in my infirmary. It would not be fair.\u201d Raphael smiled. \u201cI suppose you\ncould say, what happens in the infirmary <i>stays</i>\nin the infirmary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nMichael and all them are alright with it?\u201d</p><p>Something\nmischievous flashed in their eyes. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d </p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\nnot much they can do about it.\u201d Raphael\u2019s tone was almost smug. \u201cThe infirmary\nis <i>my</i> domain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice\none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\nthank you.\u201d</p><p>The\nsilence was more comfortable than it had been this time. Crowley ate his\ngnocchi, trying to savor the taste. A thought nagged at him, stealing away his\nappetite. He lowered his fork. </p><p>\u201cYou\nsaid Aziraphale spoke of me,\u201d he began slowly. Raphael nodded. \u201cSo. He was\u2014he\nwas in the infirmary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt\nthe time, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201c\nCrowley swallowed. \u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>It\nwas possible sometimes, that an angel or demon would sustain enough damage that\nthey had to go back Up (or Down) to recover from it. Occasionally the act of\ndiscorporation and the circumstances surrounding it would be damaging enough to\nleave them out of commission for some time. </p><p>Crowley\nhad <i>never</i> tried to harm Aziraphale.\nBut sometimes, early on\u2026there had been accidents. One hadn\u2019t known the other\nwas there, an angel getting caught off guard in a demon\u2019s wiles, a demon catching\nthe wrong end of a divine thwarting, simply by unlucky chance at being in the\nwrong place at the wrong time. It had happened. It was a large part of their\nmaking the Arrangement. If they knew where the other was, there wouldn\u2019t be any\nmore accidents. No one would get <i>hurt.</i></p><p>A\ncool hand covered his own, thin and long. Utterly unlike Aziraphale\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\nBe at peace. You were not responsible. Knowingly or otherwise.\u201d Crowley let out\na long breath. \u201cAziraphale had a brush with a place of particularly strong\ninfernal taint some two-thousand years ago. It took him some weeks to recover.\nAll he spoke of was how sorry he was to miss out on dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed a little shakily. \u201cYeah. Yeah, that\u2019s my angel. Never would pass up a\ngood meal.\u201d</p><p>The\nangel withdrew their hand. They gave him a significant look. \u201cI suspect it was\nthe company, if I may be so bold to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGossipy,\naren\u2019t you angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\nhave to get up to something. Outright violence isn\u2019t really an option to us.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. </p><p>\u201cHe\ncares for you very much,\u201d continued Raphael. \u201cAziraphale. All the while he was\nin my care, it wasn\u2019t anything I was doing that helped him recover. It was\ntalking about <i>you</i>, and doing\neverything he could to get better so he could back and see you again.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfelt his face heating up in a wild blush. \u201cThat\u2019s the most cheesy thing I\u2019ve\never heard. You\u2019re making that up!\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nsmiled. \u201cPerhaps I exaggerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nthinking of you brought him such comfort. I know this. It\u2019s what I am made\nfor.\u201d</p><p>While\na large part of Crowley was happy to roll about insensibly in happiness, a\nsmaller more suspicious part was asking the important questions. </p><p>\u201cWhy\nare you telling me this?\u201d He watched the angel carefully. \u201cAre you\u2026<i>tempting</i> me into a relationship with\nhim?<i> I</i> am the expert at temptation.\nYou can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith\nall due respect, I don\u2019t think I need to.\u201d Crowley made an offended sound. They\nwere right though, <i>bless</i> them. \u201cIt\u2019s\nvery clear to me that you both care for each other a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nadmitted Crowley after a moment. Then he took off his sunglasses and met the\narchangel\u2019s gaze directly. \u201cIf we do this, if he and I are together\u2014<i>properly</i>\u2014will he\u2026\u201d he took a breath. \u201cWill\nhe be Punished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\nhas made it very clear\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cThis\nisn\u2019t about Adam,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen when and if\nAdam dies\u2014this is about Heaven. <i>Please</i>.\nI have to know. Will being with me cause him harm? I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d he swallowed, a\nlump forming in his throat. \u201cI won\u2019t have that.\u201d<br></p><p>Oh\nhe <i>wanted</i> Aziraphale, he wanted to be\nnear him, to make him laugh and scoff, to wake up next to him every day and\nmake a nuisance of himself while he was trying to read. But if his affection\nwould be the cause of punishment, then\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo\nCrowley.\u201d Raphael looked at him solemnly across the table. \u201cHe won\u2019t. Heaven\nhas decided to leave Aziraphale alone.\u201d</p><p>He\nshot Raphael a hard look. \u201cAnd if they change their minds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\nwould be a trial, and a vote, and I can promise you enough of us either don\u2019t\ncare what Aziraphale does, or will side in his favor simply to annoy Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlet out a shaky breath. \u201cPromise me you will speak up for him if it happens. <i>Please.</i> If there\u2019s anything I can do,\nanything I can offer you, I will, just\u2014please. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse,\u201d said Raphael, brow creasing. \u201cCrowley, of <i>course</i> I\u2019ll look out for him. You need give me nothing.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfelt as if a great weight had been taken off his shoulders. He took a moment to\ncompose himself. \u201cThank you,\u201d he managed, dizzy from it.</p><p>Raphael\nwatched him, respect and admiration clear on their face.\u201cI am glad to have met\nyou, Crowley. You are truly a remarkable soul. Such compassion. Such love\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nyeah.\u201d Like he\u2019d never heard that before. Crowley crossed his legs, slouching\ndown in his seat more comfortably. \u201cDon\u2019t spread it around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nwould have made a remarkable angel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nsniffed, wiping a speck of lint off his shirt*.\u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a\nremarkable demon.\u201d</p><p>*It\nwasn\u2019t there before, but he had wanted it to be, and so it had.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s\neyes were very fond. \u201cYes. That too. But you would have made quite the healer.\nShould you ever need help, should Hell ever set their wiles against you, know\nthat you can call for me. I will look out for you.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, his wine glass half way to his mouth. He took a large gulp, hand shaking\nslightly. He put it down heavily. \u201cUrm. Ye..ah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa\nha. Ha.\u201d He picked up his glass and took a large gulp.</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\nThe archangel leaned in. \u201cI am in earnest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa?\nUgh\u2026ngk. Why?\u201d Crowley asked in a small confused voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause\nyou have so much love in you. Because you have been so loyal for so long to the\none you love. And because I can see the damage Hell has caused you.\u201d They\nsmiled sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s rent across the fabric of your soul in a terrible scar. Yet\nyou still have such compassion. It\u2019s remarkable.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s\nmind was racing, a dizzying feeling of embarrassment, indignity and panic at\nbeing picked apart washing over him. A part of him was flattered and welcomed\nthe praise. Another part was simply very, very tired.</p><p>Why\ncouldn\u2019t he just be accepted as himself?</p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d\ncontinued Raphael gently. \u201cShould you ever decide to return to Heaven, know\nthat I will speak for you. No harm will befall you, should you wish to return.\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon was still for a long moment. Then he let out a breath, only a little bit\nshaky. He put his sunglasses back on, and gave Raphael a winning smile, only a\nlittle bit wobbly. \u201cNot really my scene. Heaven. Never could follow orders very\nwell. Besides,\u201d he shrugged, feeling more himself again. \u201cIt cramped my style.\u201d</p><p>A\nslow smile stretched across the archangel\u2019s face. \u201cA terrible thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nis.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\ndo seem happy down here. On earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\nno where I\u2019d rather be,\u201d said Crowley honestly. </p><p>Raphael\nstared at him. \u201cYou really mean that.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nflushed and fidgeted with his napkin. \u201cEr. Yeah. Where else can I drive my\nBentley anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\nI am glad for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\nleaned back, a pensive look coming into their eyes. \u201cI admire earth, but can\u2019t\nreally say I care for it. Not in the way you do. Happily my interests have always\nbeen more contained to my practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\nGlad that worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\nBut should things ever change, my offer still stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\nThanks.\u201d Crowley squirmed at the sincerity. \u201cNo really, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\npleasure.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>The\nstreets of Soho were busy tonight, people bustling about, the thin layer of\nsnow laying over the rooftops and streets adding a serene look to the place.</p><p>Aziraphale\nwalked briskly, mind racing.</p><p>A\npart of him that had enjoyed that. Aziraphale didn\u2019t want to dwell on it, nor\ndid he want to think about the small part of him that was flattered at the\nattention.</p><p>He\nfilled the information away under \u2018Just In Case\u2019, shut the metaphorical drawer\nand locked it, and focused on the epiphany looming ahead of him.</p><p>The\nbookshop door closed behind Aziraphale. He heaved a deep sigh and held out his\nhand, catching the new quiz as it materialized before him.</p><p>The\nlast one.</p><p>A\nfeeling of indignity rose up in him.</p><p>He\ndidn\u2019t want to wait another day to see Crowley. They <i>deserved</i> to matched.</p><p>And\nAziraphale was going to see to it that they did.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nstepped into his flat, too preoccupied to notice how his plants straightened up at\nhis presence. </p><p>Raphael\nhad been understanding. Alarmingly so. But he was tired, so tired of everyone\ncalling him an anomaly, pointing out how different he was, how good of an angel\nhe <i>could</i> have been. As if there was something tragic about him as he was. As if\nhe were incomplete.</p><p>He\njust wanted to be with the one person who cared for him as he was, who knew\nevery part of him and liked him for it.</p><p>Maybe\neven <i>loved</i> him.</p><p>With\na flash, the quiz materialized in front of him. He caught it, glaring down at\nthe pink pages.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nplayed by your rules,\u201d he told it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m done with that.\u201d</p><p>Adam\nwanted them to answer this thing honestly, right?</p><p>He\u2019d\nbloody well give it honesty. He\u2019d tell it <i>exactly</i>\nwhat he wanted and wouldn\u2019t leave room for it to give him anything less.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\ntapped his pen against the paper, reading over the quiz.</p><p>\u201cPreferences,\nhere we go.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to put down some deal breakers.\nLet\u2019s see\u2026must own a car. That\u2019s important\u2026a vintage one, let\u2019s say. Oh, how\nabout a black 1926 Bentley. Custom made. With a cassette player.\u201d He underlined the next\npart. \u201c<i>Only</i> plays Queen\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll\nneed to be well read.\u201d Crowley scribbled it down on the answer sheet. \u201cIt\u2019s all\nright if they don\u2019t know all their media but they\u2019ve got to know their books.\nAnd own a bookshop in Soho, London. Have owned it for over three hundred years. Erratic opening hours. Refuses to let anyone buy anything\u2026\u201d <br></p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cMust\nhave an affinity with snakes, I really can\u2019t stand someone who doesn\u2019t\nappreciate them! Dresses sharply, sunglasses I think. Owns a sketch of the Mona\nLisa\u2026and an embarrassing statue of an angel and demon \u2018wrestling\u2019, can\u2019t forget\nthat. Has many fancy appliances, <i>none</i>\nof them plugged in. And a terrified yet very lush collection of houseplants.\u201d Aziraphale smiled. \u201cA gentle soul, but a sharp wit and\njust the right kind of humor. I want someone that makes me think, but respects\nme for who I am\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cMust\ndress like an outdated professor.\u201d A grin split Crowley\u2019s face. \u201cA <i>gay </i>professor, with flamboyant cravats\nand terrible tartan everywhere\u2026 Must have experience with a sword. Knows how\nto gavotte. Owns a complete collection of the infamous bibles, and a signed\nfirst edition of <i>The Portrait of Dorian\nGrey</i>, with a long personal note from the author addressed to them, specifically.\u201d </p><p>He\npaused and really thought for a moment. \u201cI won\u2019t have anyone unkind. They have\nto mean well, even if they\u2019re a little absent minded. I want someone strong and\nsoft, someone that will let me blather on at four in the morning when I\u2019m off\nmy head. Someone patient and understanding\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nwho won\u2019t take my introversion as disinterest. Someone I can just <i>be</i> with, without having to be anything,\nor do anything. Someone who can see past my faults but won\u2019t hesitate to tell\nme when I\u2019m being obtuse\u2026\u201d Aziraphale trailed off. \u201cSomeone who won\u2019t let me\nfall,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t judge me if I did.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nwho will be my friend, no matter what form I take. Someone who\u2019s never been\nafraid of me, who can see my worth and not want me to be anything else.\u201d Crowley\nfilled out his quiz, ticking off boxes without mind for how he came off. \u201cI\nneed someone I can talk to. Someone I can relate to. That\u2019s what really\nmatters. So I think the big deal breaker here\u2014\u201c</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis an absolute Must, with No Exceptions, is\u2014\u201c</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cThat\nthey must\u2014\u201c</p><p>xxx</p><p>\u201cLove\u2014\u201c</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cEarth.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cEarth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Aziraphale looked over his answers. \u201cYes, that should do nicely.\u201d</p><p>He\nsat back and smiled to himself.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nI <i>wonder</i> who I\u2019ll be matched with?\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cAnd\nthat\u2019s my final word on the matter!\u201d said Crowley grandly, finishing the quiz\nwith a flourish.</p><p>He\nhad a feeling he would enjoy his next date immensely. </p><p><i>Whoever</i> he got, of course. <br></p>",
                "content": "<p>Chapter 4/5</p><p>Realtionships: Aziraphale/Crowley</p><p>Words: 6797<br /></p><p>Adam reasons that if Heaven and Hell just got to know each other a bit \nbetter, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so keen to start another Apocalypse. They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well&hellip;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>It was a bright chilly morning in\nlower Tadfield. Adam was giving Dog one last pat down before cycling off to\nschool when he heard someone calling his name.</p><p>&ldquo;Adam!&rdquo;</p><p>The boy turned, watching a\nharassed looking Aziraphale land at the foot of the driveway, wings out and\nmessy. The angel took a moment to catch his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo Aziraphale,&rdquo; he greeted\ncheerfully. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the dating going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s&mdash;erm. Look.&rdquo; There was\nsomething desperate in his eyes. &ldquo;About this match. It&rsquo;s&hellip;I don&rsquo;t. I really <i>really</i> don&rsquo;t think this will work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s\n<i>Gabriel!</i> I can&rsquo;t&mdash;this must be a joke,\nthere&rsquo;s no way I could have matched with him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But\nyou did match with him,&rdquo; said Adam innocently.</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I&mdash;I\ncan&rsquo;t have! He&rsquo;s awful. And have you seen what he <i>wears?</i>* Ghastly!&rdquo; The angel looked wretched at the thought of it.</p><p>*Gabriel\ndressed like he was on the cover of a glossy, highly conservative fashion\nmagazine featuring lean, muscular men in dull neutral-coloured business attire,\nand radiating an almost tangible air of <i>no\nhomo</i> in a mile radius around. It made Aziraphale want to clutch at his\nbright paisley bow-tie in horror.</p><p>Adam\ntook pity on him. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m sorry. You were right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas a joke.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Adam\ngrinned sheepishly. &ldquo;Just wanted to see if you really didn&rsquo;t get along or if\nyou just liked fighting.&rdquo; Aziraphale gaped at him. &ldquo;I would have gone through\nwith it, but Gabriel&rsquo;s already come by to complain, and ugh. Yeah, I can see\nwhy you don&rsquo;t like him. He&rsquo;s a right tosser.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.\nOh thank you. So, I don&rsquo;t have to&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No\nno. He&rsquo;s been matched with someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nthank goodness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo;\nAdam waved his hand. Aziraphale caught the pink booklet as it materialized and\nfluttered down towards him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the real results. But you have to go with\nwhoever you get this time, ok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nyes of course,&rdquo; agreed Aziaphale, so relieved he would have agreed to just\nabout anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Cheer\nup! Only two more to go!&rdquo; Adam picked up his bike and slung a leg over it,\nhoisting himself onto the seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Right.\nThank you, dear boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See\nyou!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nwatched the boy turn onto the road and cycle off into the town.</p><p>He\nlet out a long breath, the new results of the quiz held in his hand.</p><p>Last\nnight he had dared to hope he would be matched with Crowley. The more he\nthought on it, the more he felt terribly foolish for not thinking of it before.\nOf <i>course</i> he should be matched with\nCrowley. Hadn&rsquo;t they already chosen each other, in so many little ways throughout all\ntheir long history together?</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas in love with him. </p><p>He\nhad never wanted for a romantic relationship because just being in Crowley&rsquo;s\ncompany had been everything he had wanted.</p><p>Or\nso he had thought.</p><p>But\nnow the subject had been brought up, now that romance and candles and such\nunspeakable intimacies as <i>hand holding</i>\nand <i>snuggling</i> had been brought into\nlight&hellip;oh, to have <i>that</i> with Crowley?</p><p>It\nwas dizzying to think of how badly he wanted it.</p><p>The\ntrouble was, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if Crowley felt the same. He had&hellip;something of a\nhunch. He dearly hoped he was correct and that he hadn&rsquo;t been reading his\ndearest friend wrong these last few days.</p><p>It\nwas absolutely ridiculous they hadn&rsquo;t matched before, come to think of it. He\nand Crowley were&hellip;it just felt so <i>right</i>.\nSurely they would match now?</p><p>Aziraphale\nlooked down at the quiz.</p><p>Even\nif it wasn&rsquo;t Crowley, it couldn&rsquo;t be worse than Gabriel, he reasoned.</p><p>Then\nhe saw who he had matched with.</p><p>He\nspluttered.</p><p>Maybe,\njust maybe, it could be worse than Gabriel.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nlay face-down on his sofa, bemoaning his woes incoherently to his plants. His\nsoul music collection was blasting loud enough to shake the walls and disturb\nthe neighbors. As he didn&rsquo;t feel like having upset neighbours banging on\nhis door, they simply didn&rsquo;t hear it.</p><p>The\npink quiz lay crumpled on the floor where it had been banished some hours\nearlier.</p><p>He\nhadn&rsquo;t got Aziraphale.</p><p>Of\nbloody course he hadn&rsquo;t. That was just how things went, didn&rsquo;t they, he thought\nbitterly, in an uncharacteristic bout of pessimism. </p><p>The\nmore reasonable voice in his head (which sounded suspiciously like Aziraphale)\nsaid that of <i>course</i> he had Aziraphale\n(<i>dear boy</i>). They&rsquo;d had each other for\na very long time, hadn&rsquo;t they? </p><p>It\nwas just all this dating toss up had blown something loose, rattled up their\nold routine and put things properly in perspective.</p><p>He\nwas in love with Aziraphale. </p><p>Had\nbeen, likely, for centuries, millennia even, little by little, sauntering into it\nas gradually and as naturally as breathing*.</p><p>*Which wasn&rsquo;t natural at all to occult and ethereal beings. It was a choice, a habit they had picked up and adopted so thoroughly that stopping it felt <i>bad</i> and wrong instinctively.<br /></p><p>He\nhad good reason to believe it may be reciprocated.</p><p>What\nCrowley wanted right now was to call Aziraphale up, go over and just <i>be</i> with the angel. Or at least spend the\nday sprawled around his apartment processing everything and getting\nincreasingly giddy with the force of his epiphany.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>What\nhe had to do was go on a date with an archangel.</p><p>It\nmade him want to crawl under his couch cushions and curl up into a ball for a good week.</p><p>Adam\nhad been very clear that there was to be no fighting or discorportaing\nwhatsoever over the course of the dates.</p><p>Easy\nfor him to say. Crowley didn&rsquo;t think it would count as a fight if an archangel wanted\nto do away with him. It would be like an ant getting blasted with a laser\ntorpedo. Not much of a fight at all.</p><p>He\ngroaned into the cushioned padding of the couch.</p><p>Maybe\nit wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad? <br /></p><p>He\nwould bloody<i> </i>well survive it just to see Aziraphale again at the other side.</p><p>Crowley\nwanted to see Aziraphale <i>now</i>. <br /></p><p>He didn&rsquo;t\nwant to wait for two days, didn&rsquo;t want to hazard through two more dates when he\ncould be spending time with his angel. Maybe even confessing his feelings and\nbeing confessed to in return&hellip;</p><p>With\na dramatic sigh he heaved himself off the couch, slumping over to his closet.</p><p>At\nleast he was getting dinner out of this one. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>It was one of the very best and\nmost expensive sushi restaurants in London. Aziraphale had insisted on the\nlocation this time. If things went badly, he at least wanted to get a nice meal\nout of it.</p><p>So far the food had not\ndisappointed. Aziraphale wore his favourite tweed coat and warmest tartan scarf\nas emotional armour. The green carnation Crowley had given him last night had\nbeen tucked safely into his button hole, migrating to the pocket of his shirt\nnow he was inside.</p><p>Its presence was a great comfort\nto him as he tried his best not to make eye contact with the form across from\nhim, valiantly focusing on eating pieces of maki spider roll as precisely and\nas viciously as he could.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t let his guard down.</p><p>&ldquo;More zake?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the angel,\nstiffly.</p><p>His date watched him, something\nlow and dangerous in his eyes like hellfire. The demon was eating food, or at\nleast putting it in his mouth. What exactly happened after that was anyone&rsquo;s\nguess, but there was a faint sound of buzzing and wailing at a register just\nunder what any human could hear.</p><p>&ldquo;Zo. You&rsquo;re looking well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could say the same.&rdquo; He\nwouldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;</p><p>The demon&rsquo;s nails rapped against\nthe table.</p><p>&ldquo;You were a Cherub.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled, revealing too many rows\nof too long teeth. &ldquo;I\ndo remember you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;\nAziraphale took a calculated sip of his sake. &ldquo;From the apocalypse. Yes. Not so\nlong ago, was it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From\nbefore,&rdquo; said Beelzebub.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nafraid you&rsquo;ll have to be a bit more specific.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Before</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nblinked. &ldquo;Before&mdash;the <i>Fall?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Juzt\nzo.&rdquo; </p><p>The\nangel froze.</p><p>Something\nstrange crept into Beelzebub&rsquo;s eyes. Stranger than whatever it was they\nnormally did. &ldquo;You were kind to me. Not many were.&rdquo;</p><p>Abruptly,\nthe angel felt the sake going to his head in a dizzying rush of panic and\nconfusion. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nwaz only a lowly Power at the time,&rdquo; Beelzebub continued, voice soft. &ldquo;Not many\ncared about how I felt. There waz only Luzifer.&rdquo; His eyes sharpened. &ldquo;And you.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nstared a little desperately. &ldquo;Me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yez.\nYou did not know me. But you ztopped to talk. To cheer me up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Aziraphale\nfelt as if his life were flashing before his eyes. It was such a long time ago.\nBut he did remember. Oh yes, little bits and pieces, coming back as he tried to\ngrasp at them. </p><p>A\nPower, downtrodden and ridiculed for believing that angels shouldn&rsquo;t be cast\naside in favour of humans. He had seemed so brokenhearted, sitting there all\nalone. Aziraphale remembered coming over to him, telling him gently that he\ndidn&rsquo;t really understand why God thought humans were so important either, but\nthere must be something to it. </p><p>And\nthen&hellip;oh. </p><p>Oh\ndear. </p><p>He\nremembered saying some unsavory things about Gabriel, about how he and Michael\nwere a bit vicious when expressing their opinions, weren&rsquo;t they? There was no\nneed for all that holier-than-thou attitude, it was ridiculous! It had made the\npoor Power laugh, which is what he had been going for, and then Aziraphale had\npatted him on the back and told him to take care, and hadn&rsquo;t thought on it\nsince. </p><p>Thousands\nof years later, Aziraphale clutched his napkin in his lap desperately and\nstared at Beelzebub across from him.</p><p>The\narch-demon was smiling, sharp teeth flashing as his mouth stretched unnaturally\nwide.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nwas mozt dizzapointed when you did not join uz.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.\nOh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nwould have done well az a demon. I would have zeen to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er.\nSorry to disappoint.&rdquo;</p><p>Something\nsoftened in the arch-demon&rsquo;s gaze, something nearly vulnerable stealing across his\nfeatures. &ldquo;I looked for you. After the Fall.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nlaughed nervously. Then he stopped. Silently, he lowered his emphatic\nshielding. </p><p>This\nwas not something he did often. On earth there were so many emotions\neverywhere, so many people feeling so many things, everywhere you turned was a\nnew crisis, another injustice, another soul in torment. It was simply too much\nto feel all the time. No angel could ever hope to help every soul in need,\nnever mind non-interference orders from Above. </p><p>Aziraphale\nhad been on earth for six-thousand years. It was shield himself or go mad from\nit. He sometimes suspected he went too far, could be too impassive to those in\nneed, too quick to turn away. But he&rsquo;d bloody well like to see any of them give\nit a go without developing unconventional coping mechanisms*.</p><p>*Like\nlocking himself in his bookshop for a week and re-reading the entire <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i> until he&rsquo;d\nblocked out the latest atrocity he hadn&rsquo;t the slightest chance of stopping. It\nwas a delicate game of guilt, avoidance and planned ignorance, all for the cause\nof warding off any creeping despair.</p><p>Bracing\nhimself, he reached out with his aura and allowed himself to feel what was\ncoming off of Beelzebub.</p><p>He\nchoked.</p><p>It\nwasn&rsquo;t exactly affection. It wasn&rsquo;t <i>not</i>\naffection either. There was respect, even admiration. Something else, something\nmuch more complicated hovering between pride and frustration and just a touch\nof smug avarice.</p><p>Beelzebub&rsquo;s\nsmile widened.</p><p>Aziraphale\nwithdrew his aura as if it he had been burned. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nserous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yez.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The\noffer ztandz. You could do very well for yourzelf in Hell.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nangel drew himself up importantly. &ldquo;I rather think I have done well for\nmyself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nhave a backbone. Not many do. We need more of them in Hell.&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;Not\njuzt the onez we rip out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well!\nThat sounds like your problem right there? Counter productive, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hah!\nZee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone\nhas their own set of principals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\ndizobeyed direct orderz from Heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nwasn&rsquo;t alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Beelzebub\nfrowned. &ldquo;Ah yez. Crawly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Crowley</i>, thank you.&rdquo; He glared at the\ndemon. &ldquo;Really, what kind of arch-demon can&rsquo;t remember the names of those\nworking for them?</p><p>\n&ldquo;I do not pretend to underztand your attraction to him. You could do zo much\nbetter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t know what you think you&rsquo;re offering,&rdquo; said Azirphale, something sharp and\nflaming and furious glinting behind his eyes. &ldquo;But if you ever even <i>think</i> of hurting Crowley you will be\nvery sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Beelzebub\nsat back in his seat, a deep buzzing laugh rumbling inside his chest, like a\nnest of bees that had been hit with a stick. &ldquo;Ah, they don&rsquo;t know what they\nhave in you Upztairs. I can offer you zo much more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No\nthank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Power?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bothersome,\nisn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A\nnize offize?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nquite fond of my own, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All\nthe bookz you could ever want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This\nthat all you have to offer?&rdquo; He scoffed. &ldquo;Look. I don&rsquo;t want power. I don&rsquo;t\nwant an office, and certainly not one in Hell. And books?&rdquo; The angel gestured.\n&ldquo;What better place to get them than on earth? And anyway, half the fun is in\ncollecting them. No, you&rsquo;ve nothing to offer me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nhave potential as a demon. You could be <i>zo</i>\npowerful. Ruthlezz. Zelfizh. Gluttonuz. You know you have theze qualitiez.&rdquo; </p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s\ngaze didn&rsquo;t waver. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said evenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the most\nvirtuous angel. But if I&rsquo;ve learned anything from earth, it&rsquo;s that knowing and\ndoing are very different things. I have potential for doing terrible things,\nyes. But so does everyone. It comes down to what we choose to do. And I will\nmake my own choices.&rdquo;</p><p>Beelzebub\nsat back in his chair. He crossed his arms, a deeply pensive look coming into\nhis eyes. &ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; The faint buzzing sound got louder.</p><p>Aziraphale\ntook advantage of this to polish off the last of the unagi rolls, smearing them\nwith wasabi and dipping them liberally in soy sauce. He was carting off most of\nthe dragon roll to his own plate when Beelzebub stirred.</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley.&rdquo;\n</p><p>Azirphale\nlooked up sharply. Beelzebub was watching him, a smile oozing across his face. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;z\nit. That&rsquo;z what you want, izn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; The demon leaned forward. &ldquo;I can give him\nto you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse\nme?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley\ncould be yourz. For all eternity. No one could contezt it. <br /></p><p>Aziraphale\nlowered his chopsticks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, did you say you would <i>give</i> me Crowley?&rdquo;</p><p>Beelzebub\nopened his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Do\nyou mean that you think Crowley is something you can just <i>give</i> me, and I&rsquo;d be happy with that?&rdquo; Aziraphale demanded,\nploughing right over him. &ldquo;You are absolutely wrong! There is nothing&mdash;&ldquo; he\njabbed a chopstick at the demon&mdash; &ldquo;<i>nothing</i>,\nI want from Crowley that you can <i>make</i>\nhim give me. What I want from Crowley is only what he is willing to\ngive&mdash;freely! Of his own accord! No blackmail, no threatening, nothing! Do you\nunderstand me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\n<i>hmm</i>. And don&rsquo;t you go threatening him\nin my presence! Don&rsquo;t threaten him at all! In fact you&rsquo;d better back right\noff&mdash;and have your lackeys do so as well&mdash;I won&rsquo;t have any of you bothering him\nand forcing him to do things he hates! You&rsquo;ll leave him well enough alone, do you\nhear me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He\nreally doez make you zo happy?&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\npaused in his angry tirade. &ldquo;Yes. Oh yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Very much.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;\nBeelzebub grumbled unhappily. &ldquo;Zo long az he makez you happy Hell will leave\nhim alone.&rdquo; The arch-demon held his hand out across that table. The fingers\nended in claw-like nails. &ldquo;A favour for a favour. For what you did for me before.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;hang\non.&rdquo; Aziraphale glared. &ldquo;Oho. <i>No</i>. I\ndon&rsquo;t <i>think</i> so. Nice try. As long as\nhe makes me happy, you say.&rdquo; The angel sat back and crossed his arms. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m\nafraid that won&rsquo;t do at all. You do not bother Crowley <i>whatsoever</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Beelzebub\ngrowled. &ldquo;But if he doezn&rsquo;t make you happy&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\ndoesn&rsquo;t matter if he makes me miserable!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!\nNo buts! I don&rsquo;t care what terrible deeds he does in any hypothetical\nsituation, you are to leave him well and alone, you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>Beelzebub\nstared at him. Aziraphale felt his aura being sized up, examined, checked\nthoroughly for any resistance or weakness of will. There was none. Aziraphale\nhad realized exactly how much Crowley meant to him, everything had clicked\nfully into place.</p><p>His\nwill was as stone.</p><p>The\narch-demon pulled back, something about his expression softening. A small smile\ntugged at his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Hell\nwill not bother or punizh Crowley,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>Beelzebub\nheld out his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;And\nyou won&rsquo;t get any humans to do it either,&rdquo; said Aziraphale suspiciously.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If\nany danger does befall him, it&rsquo;s <i>me</i>\nwho&rsquo;ll come looking for names.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nwould expect no lezz.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.\nWell then. We have an understanding.&rdquo;</p><p>He\ngrasped Beelzebub&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>The\narch-demon&rsquo;s hand clasped about his own, hard, vice-like, but careful not to\nhurt.</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley\ncomes to no harm from the forzes of Hell or from our influenzes,&rdquo; said the\ndemon.</p><p>&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Unlezz</i>,&rdquo; Beelzebub stressed, angry\nbuzzing rising from deep in his chest. &ldquo;Unlezz,&rdquo; he continued before Aziraphale\ncould object, &ldquo;You perzonally azk me to hurt him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nwould <i>never!</i> Unless&mdash;<i>ohh</i>, don&rsquo;t you go and try to get me\npossessed. It won&rsquo;t work!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Under\nyour own power. No pozzezzion. No coerzing. No blackmail. And no Heavenly\ninterfearenze. Only your own will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That\nis not going to happen!&rdquo; cried the angel, trying to twist his hand out of the\ndemon&rsquo;s grasp. It was held too firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Then\nit zhouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwon&rsquo;t be a problem because I won&rsquo;t agree to it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then\nthere iz no deal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well\n<i>bugger</i> you then! Let go of me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will\nyou lizten?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will\nyou let go of my hand!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale.\nZtop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> stop!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lizten.\nPleaze.&rdquo;</p><p>It\nwas the please that did him in. Oddly sincere. It caught him off guard. He\nhuffed angrily, giving his hand one last petulant pull. He glared at the demon,\nquietly trying to set him aflame with his Will. The slight amusement in\nBeelzebub&rsquo;s eyes told him he was severely outclassed in that endeavor. Bugger.</p><p>&ldquo;Let\ngo of me,&rdquo; he ground out.</p><p>&ldquo;Thiz\nfirzt.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nhuffed again. He stopped trying to extract his hand and just focused on getting\nhis breathing under control. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not agreeing to anything if it puts Crowley in\ndanger,&rdquo; he said, emotion choking his voice. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nam not azking you to,&rdquo; said the arch-demon quietly. &ldquo;Az much az it painz me to\nzay it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let\nme do thiz. Crowley will only come to harm if you exprezzively tell me you want\nhim to be. That iz the only condition. He will be zafe otherwize. Thiz I\nzwear.&rdquo; </p><p>Aziraphale\nglared at him. &ldquo;How do I know I can trust you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t. I zupoze. Do you think you can truzt me?&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\nsent out his aura, raked the demon with it, searching for any trace of treachery,\nany loophole sniggering at him from the shadows. He found none. He pulled back,\nstaring at the demon warily.</p><p>&ldquo;I\n<i>damn</i> well hope you&rsquo;re not lying. For\nyour sake. You would do well to remember that I am a Guardian. I was made to\nprotect. And I can promise you I <i>will</i>.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Beelzebub\nsmiled widely, all his long, sharp teeth gleaming in the lamplight. &ldquo;You are\nwazted on Heaven,&rdquo; he said warmly.</p><p>Aziraphale\nsniffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done with Heaven. I want nothing to do with either side.&rdquo; He\nwriggled his fingers in the demon&rsquo;s hold. &ldquo;A favour for a favour then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So\nit iz done.&rdquo;</p><p>Beelzebub\nshook his hand, then released it. Aziraphale snatched it back, rubbing his\nwrist mistrustfully. It wasn&rsquo;t bruised at all, to his surprise. Not even reddened.\n</p><p>He\nsniffed. &ldquo;Yes. Well.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dezzert?&rdquo;\noozed the demon.</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t know that I should.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They\nhave fried ice cream.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm.\nMaybe a taste.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\niz on me.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s\neyes narrowed. &ldquo;Oh no. We&rsquo;re even now. I won&rsquo;t have myself falling into your\ndebt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pleaze.\nAllow me. For the enjoyable converzation. It iz not everyday zomeone talkz back\nto me.

I will zee you\nare comfortable.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nstiffened. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Juzt\nthe zame.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nare stubborn, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Amusement\nglowed in Beelzebub&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I am uzed to getting my way, yez. And you are no\nbetter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; Aziraphale\nresisted the urge to stick his tongue out at the demon. He was&hellip;being\nsurprisingly sincere. It was jarring. &ldquo;Thank\nyou,&rdquo; he said stiffly. Then he waved his chopstick at the demon. &ldquo;Though it <i>won&rsquo;t</i> come up, I tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourze not,&rdquo; Beelzebub said indulgently. &ldquo;But juzt in caze.&rdquo; </p><p>The\ndemon smiled at him across the table, no hint of malice in his eyes at all.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;So,\ner&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Crowley\nwas floundering. He was in one of the higher end Italian restaurants of London.\nHe&rsquo;d been here before. Home turf advantage was his, and for that he was\ngrateful. </p><p>He felt woefully unprepared.</p><p>He&rsquo;d\nput on his favourite sleek button-down shirt, forgone any shoes (just his very\nown scales would do) and shrugged into one of Aziraphale&rsquo;s cardigans he had\nswiped from the angel and hidden away in his closet. It was a warm, chunky\nknit, soft from decades of wear, and patterned with argyle. A row of knitted\nducks made their way around its middle. It was far too big on him. Crowley\nloved it.</p><p>Even\nwith his angel&rsquo;s cardigan, he still struggled to make eye contact with the\narchangel across from him. </p><p>&ldquo;You\nrun Heaven&rsquo;s infirmary, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;\nRaphael sat calmly across the table from him, taking even bites of their Capesante.\n&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael\nhad never bothered with the concept of genders and seemed quite at home in an\nambiguous body, wearing a long cream-coloured shift tied round the waist. They\nlooked a bit like an elf, with the long, elegant limbs and flowing, silvery\nhair. And elf, or a vampire that never got the goth memo.</p><p>&ldquo;Right.\nAnd, uh,&rdquo; Crowley cast about for something to say. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that been working\nout?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ncan&rsquo;t complain. I&rsquo;m largely left alone to do as I please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nice,&rdquo;\nsaid Crowley desperately. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&mdash;nice.&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael\nwas staring at him. They had been since they&rsquo;d met, in a slow, thoughtful sort\nof way of a person trying to place something. On a human it might have been a\nbit odd, but not unnerving. On an <i>archangel</i>&hellip;\n</p><p>Crowley\nrubbed his feet together under the table and grabbed up his wine glass, taking\na sip and wondering how quickly he could shovel his gnocchi into his mouth and\nrun off without insulting them.</p><p>You\ndid <i>not</i> want to insult an archangel*.</p><p>*Unless\nyou were Aziraphale and the archangel was Gabriel. Because Gabriel was a\nbastard and deserved what he got.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nworked in the garden.&rdquo; </p><p>Raphael&rsquo;s\nvoice was smooth and melodious. If you listened very carefully you could hear\nit threaded with the sound of tiny silvery bells and what may have been a\nbamboo flute, calming and soothing like a stream.</p><p>The\neffect was lost on Crowley, who choked on his wine, managing to lower his glass\nwithout spilling as he spluttered. &ldquo;Mngk?&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael\nwas unruffled. &ldquo;You tended the gardens in the fourth sphere.&rdquo; They sat back in\ntheir seat, features softening in satisfaction. &ldquo;I remember now.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nblinked behind his sunglasses. Bless <i>someone</i>.\nThe gardens. That was a very long time ago. He hadn&rsquo;t thought about his pre-Fall\ndays in ages.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh\nheh.&rdquo; He tried to surreptitiously wipe his mouth. &ldquo;Ye-yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>A\ngentle smiled crossed Raphael&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You grew the most beautiful flowers. I\nwas especially fond of the orchids. Do you still keep it up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er.\nIt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Growing\nthings. Plants.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mnn&hellip;yeah.\nHah. A bit. I&rsquo;ve&hellip;got a few plants.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you any pictures of them?&rdquo; asked Raphael, looking very interested.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nyeah, loads.&rdquo; Crowley dug out his phone hastily, nearly dropping it in his\nnervousness. He opened one of his favourite plant albums and leaned over the\ntable with it. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael\npeered down at the screen eagerly. They swiped from picture to picture, delight\nshining in their eyes. &ldquo;Wonderful! They&rsquo;re so lush.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nI know how to handle them,&rdquo; said Crowley, feeling very proud of himself. &ldquo;Have\nto keep them on their little grassy toes. Can&rsquo;t have them getting sloppy.&rdquo; He\ntucked his phone back in his pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a greenhouse one day,&rdquo;\nhe offered.</p><p>&ldquo;Marvelous.&rdquo;\nRaphael smiled. &ldquo;Your compassion does you credit.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, getting horrible flashbacks from his second date. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nI don&rsquo;t mean to make you uncomfortable,&rdquo; said the archangel quickly. &ldquo;Only it\nmust have been difficult to keep it after all you&rsquo;ve been through.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nfelt something soft and warm stretch out towards him. It was their aura, he realized\nwith a jolt. Raphael was reaching out with their aura. To offer&hellip;comfort. To a\ndemon.</p><p>&ldquo;It\ncan&rsquo;t image it&rsquo;s been easy for you,&rdquo; they said, voice low and soft.</p><p>Crowley\nfelt his mouth go dry. Something suspiciously like tears pricked at the back of\nhis eyes. &ldquo;Ngk. I&rsquo;ve&mdash;er.&rdquo; He sniffed. &ldquo;Heard good things about you.&rdquo; He flashed\nthe angel a nervous grin. &ldquo;I remember you were one of the reasonable ones.&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael\nlaughed, a light airy sound like a wind chime. &ldquo;Thank you. That is high\npraise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale\nspeaks highly of you,&rdquo; said Crowley carefully. He watched the angel&rsquo;s face,\nwaiting to see if any expression of annoyance or disgust would cross it. That\nwas his cue to manifest a purse and start shoving bread sticks into it.</p><p>Raphael&rsquo;s\neyes were fond. &ldquo;Did he? It&rsquo;s most kind of him. He speaks very highly of you as\nwell.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, his fork halfway to his mouth. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s talked about me?&rdquo;</p><p>The\nangel seemed to misinterpret his tone. &ldquo;Crowley, you have nothing to fear.\nAziraphale would not betray you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of&mdash;of\nbloody <i>course</i> not!&rdquo; spluttered the\ndemon, insulted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my <i>friend!</i> He\nwould never&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow. I know, Crowley,&rdquo; soothed Raphael. Crowley settled down, sending the\nangel an unfriendly look. &ldquo;I should explain myself. I am&hellip;&rdquo; The archangel traced\nthe rim of their wine glass with slender fingers. &ldquo;Something of a neutral force\nin Heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\neyed them across the table. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that work then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The\nhumans started it. The Hippocratic oath. Commendable I thought. I devote myself\nto the care of my patients and to their keeping. It&rsquo;s not my business what they\nget up to. Or even what side they&rsquo;re on, as far as I care. I <i>heal</i>. I am not made for destruction, nor\ndo I have any desire to turn my hands to it. The normal rules of Heaven do not\napply in my infirmary. It would not be fair.&rdquo; Raphael smiled. &ldquo;I suppose you\ncould say, what happens in the infirmary <i>stays</i>\nin the infirmary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And\nMichael and all them are alright with it?&rdquo;</p><p>Something\nmischievous flashed in their eyes. &ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s\nnot much they can do about it.&rdquo; Raphael&rsquo;s tone was almost smug. &ldquo;The infirmary\nis <i>my</i> domain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice\none.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why\nthank you.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nsilence was more comfortable than it had been this time. Crowley ate his\ngnocchi, trying to savor the taste. A thought nagged at him, stealing away his\nappetite. He lowered his fork. </p><p>&ldquo;You\nsaid Aziraphale spoke of me,&rdquo; he began slowly. Raphael nodded. &ldquo;So. He was&mdash;he\nwas in the infirmary?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At\nthe time, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&mdash;&ldquo;\nCrowley swallowed. &ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p><p>It\nwas possible sometimes, that an angel or demon would sustain enough damage that\nthey had to go back Up (or Down) to recover from it. Occasionally the act of\ndiscorporation and the circumstances surrounding it would be damaging enough to\nleave them out of commission for some time. </p><p>Crowley\nhad <i>never</i> tried to harm Aziraphale.\nBut sometimes, early on&hellip;there had been accidents. One hadn&rsquo;t known the other\nwas there, an angel getting caught off guard in a demon&rsquo;s wiles, a demon catching\nthe wrong end of a divine thwarting, simply by unlucky chance at being in the\nwrong place at the wrong time. It had happened. It was a large part of their\nmaking the Arrangement. If they knew where the other was, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any\nmore accidents. No one would get <i>hurt.</i></p><p>A\ncool hand covered his own, thin and long. Utterly unlike Aziraphale&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley.\nBe at peace. You were not responsible. Knowingly or otherwise.&rdquo; Crowley let out\na long breath. &ldquo;Aziraphale had a brush with a place of particularly strong\ninfernal taint some two-thousand years ago. It took him some weeks to recover.\nAll he spoke of was how sorry he was to miss out on dinner with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed a little shakily. &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, that&rsquo;s my angel. Never would pass up a\ngood meal.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nangel withdrew their hand. They gave him a significant look. &ldquo;I suspect it was\nthe company, if I may be so bold to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gossipy,\naren&rsquo;t you angels?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We\nhave to get up to something. Outright violence isn&rsquo;t really an option to us.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. </p><p>&ldquo;He\ncares for you very much,&rdquo; continued Raphael. &ldquo;Aziraphale. All the while he was\nin my care, it wasn&rsquo;t anything I was doing that helped him recover. It was\ntalking about <i>you</i>, and doing\neverything he could to get better so he could back and see you again.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nfelt his face heating up in a wild blush. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most cheesy thing I&rsquo;ve\never heard. You&rsquo;re making that up!&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael\nsmiled. &ldquo;Perhaps I exaggerate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But\nthinking of you brought him such comfort. I know this. It&rsquo;s what I am made\nfor.&rdquo;</p><p>While\na large part of Crowley was happy to roll about insensibly in happiness, a\nsmaller more suspicious part was asking the important questions. </p><p>&ldquo;Why\nare you telling me this?&rdquo; He watched the angel carefully. &ldquo;Are you&hellip;<i>tempting</i> me into a relationship with\nhim?<i> I</i> am the expert at temptation.\nYou can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With\nall due respect, I don&rsquo;t think I need to.&rdquo; Crowley made an offended sound. They\nwere right though, <i>bless</i> them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nvery clear to me that you both care for each other a great deal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;\nadmitted Crowley after a moment. Then he took off his sunglasses and met the\narchangel&rsquo;s gaze directly. &ldquo;If we do this, if he and I are together&mdash;<i>properly</i>&mdash;will he&hellip;&rdquo; he took a breath. &ldquo;Will\nhe be Punished?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Adam\nhas made it very clear&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This\nisn&rsquo;t about Adam,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what will happen when and if\nAdam dies&mdash;this is about Heaven. <i>Please</i>.\nI have to know. Will being with me cause him harm? I won&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; he swallowed, a\nlump forming in his throat. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Oh\nhe <i>wanted</i> Aziraphale, he wanted to be\nnear him, to make him laugh and scoff, to wake up next to him every day and\nmake a nuisance of himself while he was trying to read. But if his affection\nwould be the cause of punishment, then&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;No\nCrowley.&rdquo; Raphael looked at him solemnly across the table. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t. Heaven\nhas decided to leave Aziraphale alone.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nshot Raphael a hard look. &ldquo;And if they change their minds?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There\nwould be a trial, and a vote, and I can promise you enough of us either don&rsquo;t\ncare what Aziraphale does, or will side in his favor simply to annoy Gabriel.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nlet out a shaky breath. &ldquo;Promise me you will speak up for him if it happens. <i>Please.</i> If there&rsquo;s anything I can do,\nanything I can offer you, I will, just&mdash;please. Promise me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse,&rdquo; said Raphael, brow creasing. &ldquo;Crowley, of <i>course</i> I&rsquo;ll look out for him. You need give me nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nfelt as if a great weight had been taken off his shoulders. He took a moment to\ncompose himself. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he managed, dizzy from it.</p><p>Raphael\nwatched him, respect and admiration clear on their face.&ldquo;I am glad to have met\nyou, Crowley. You are truly a remarkable soul. Such compassion. Such love&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nyeah.&rdquo; Like he&rsquo;d never heard that before. Crowley crossed his legs, slouching\ndown in his seat more comfortably. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spread it around.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nwould have made a remarkable angel.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nsniffed, wiping a speck of lint off his shirt*.&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;m a\nremarkable demon.&rdquo;</p><p>*It\nwasn&rsquo;t there before, but he had wanted it to be, and so it had.</p><p>Raphael&rsquo;s\neyes were very fond. &ldquo;Yes. That too. But you would have made quite the healer.\nShould you ever need help, should Hell ever set their wiles against you, know\nthat you can call for me. I will look out for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nfroze, his wine glass half way to his mouth. He took a large gulp, hand shaking\nslightly. He put it down heavily. &ldquo;Urm. Ye..ah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha\nha. Ha.&rdquo; He picked up his glass and took a large gulp.</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley.&rdquo;\nThe archangel leaned in. &ldquo;I am in earnest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha?\nUgh&hellip;ngk. Why?&rdquo; Crowley asked in a small confused voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Because\nyou have so much love in you. Because you have been so loyal for so long to the\none you love. And because I can see the damage Hell has caused you.&rdquo; They\nsmiled sadly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rent across the fabric of your soul in a terrible scar. Yet\nyou still have such compassion. It&rsquo;s remarkable.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley&rsquo;s\nmind was racing, a dizzying feeling of embarrassment, indignity and panic at\nbeing picked apart washing over him. A part of him was flattered and welcomed\nthe praise. Another part was simply very, very tired.</p><p>Why\ncouldn&rsquo;t he just be accepted as himself?</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley,&rdquo;\ncontinued Raphael gently. &ldquo;Should you ever decide to return to Heaven, know\nthat I will speak for you. No harm will befall you, should you wish to return.&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndemon was still for a long moment. Then he let out a breath, only a little bit\nshaky. He put his sunglasses back on, and gave Raphael a winning smile, only a\nlittle bit wobbly. &ldquo;Not really my scene. Heaven. Never could follow orders very\nwell. Besides,&rdquo; he shrugged, feeling more himself again. &ldquo;It cramped my style.&rdquo;</p><p>A\nslow smile stretched across the archangel&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;A terrible thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nis.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You\ndo seem happy down here. On earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s\nno where I&rsquo;d rather be,&rdquo; said Crowley honestly. </p><p>Raphael\nstared at him. &ldquo;You really mean that.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nflushed and fidgeted with his napkin. &ldquo;Er. Yeah. Where else can I drive my\nBentley anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then\nI am glad for you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Me\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael\nleaned back, a pensive look coming into their eyes. &ldquo;I admire earth, but can&rsquo;t\nreally say I care for it. Not in the way you do. Happily my interests have always\nbeen more contained to my practice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice.\nGlad that worked out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed.\nBut should things ever change, my offer still stands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er.\nThanks.&rdquo; Crowley squirmed at the sincerity. &ldquo;No really, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My\npleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>The\nstreets of Soho were busy tonight, people bustling about, the thin layer of\nsnow laying over the rooftops and streets adding a serene look to the place.</p><p>Aziraphale\nwalked briskly, mind racing.</p><p>A\npart of him that had enjoyed that. Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t want to dwell on it, nor\ndid he want to think about the small part of him that was flattered at the\nattention.</p><p>He\nfilled the information away under &lsquo;Just In Case&rsquo;, shut the metaphorical drawer\nand locked it, and focused on the epiphany looming ahead of him.</p><p>The\nbookshop door closed behind Aziraphale. He heaved a deep sigh and held out his\nhand, catching the new quiz as it materialized before him.</p><p>The\nlast one.</p><p>A\nfeeling of indignity rose up in him.</p><p>He\ndidn&rsquo;t want to wait another day to see Crowley. They <i>deserved</i> to matched.</p><p>And\nAziraphale was going to see to it that they did.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nstepped into his flat, too preoccupied to notice how his plants straightened up at\nhis presence. </p><p>Raphael\nhad been understanding. Alarmingly so. But he was tired, so tired of everyone\ncalling him an anomaly, pointing out how different he was, how good of an angel\nhe <i>could</i> have been. As if there was something tragic about him as he was. As if\nhe were incomplete.</p><p>He\njust wanted to be with the one person who cared for him as he was, who knew\nevery part of him and liked him for it.</p><p>Maybe\neven <i>loved</i> him.</p><p>With\na flash, the quiz materialized in front of him. He caught it, glaring down at\nthe pink pages.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nplayed by your rules,&rdquo; he told it. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m done with that.&rdquo;</p><p>Adam\nwanted them to answer this thing honestly, right?</p><p>He&rsquo;d\nbloody well give it honesty. He&rsquo;d tell it <i>exactly</i>\nwhat he wanted and wouldn&rsquo;t leave room for it to give him anything less.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\ntapped his pen against the paper, reading over the quiz.</p><p>&ldquo;Preferences,\nhere we go.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to put down some deal breakers.\nLet&rsquo;s see&hellip;must own a car. That&rsquo;s important&hellip;a vintage one, let&rsquo;s say. Oh, how\nabout a black 1926 Bentley. Custom made. With a cassette player.&rdquo; He underlined the next\npart. &ldquo;<i>Only</i> plays Queen&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll\nneed to be well read.&rdquo; Crowley scribbled it down on the answer sheet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all\nright if they don&rsquo;t know all their media but they&rsquo;ve got to know their books.\nAnd own a bookshop in Soho, London. Have owned it for over three hundred years. Erratic opening hours. Refuses to let anyone buy anything&hellip;&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;Must\nhave an affinity with snakes, I really can&rsquo;t stand someone who doesn&rsquo;t\nappreciate them! Dresses sharply, sunglasses I think. Owns a sketch of the Mona\nLisa&hellip;and an embarrassing statue of an angel and demon &lsquo;wrestling&rsquo;, can&rsquo;t forget\nthat. Has many fancy appliances, <i>none</i>\nof them plugged in. And a terrified yet very lush collection of houseplants.&rdquo; Aziraphale smiled. &ldquo;A gentle soul, but a sharp wit and\njust the right kind of humor. I want someone that makes me think, but respects\nme for who I am&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;Must\ndress like an outdated professor.&rdquo; A grin split Crowley&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;A <i>gay </i>professor, with flamboyant cravats\nand terrible tartan everywhere&hellip; Must have experience with a sword. Knows how\nto gavotte. Owns a complete collection of the infamous bibles, and a signed\nfirst edition of <i>The Portrait of Dorian\nGrey</i>, with a long personal note from the author addressed to them, specifically.&rdquo; </p><p>He\npaused and really thought for a moment. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have anyone unkind. They have\nto mean well, even if they&rsquo;re a little absent minded. I want someone strong and\nsoft, someone that will let me blather on at four in the morning when I&rsquo;m off\nmy head. Someone patient and understanding&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;Someone\nwho won&rsquo;t take my introversion as disinterest. Someone I can just <i>be</i> with, without having to be anything,\nor do anything. Someone who can see past my faults but won&rsquo;t hesitate to tell\nme when I&rsquo;m being obtuse&hellip;&rdquo; Aziraphale trailed off. &ldquo;Someone who won&rsquo;t let me\nfall,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t judge me if I did.&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;Someone\nwho will be my friend, no matter what form I take. Someone who&rsquo;s never been\nafraid of me, who can see my worth and not want me to be anything else.&rdquo; Crowley\nfilled out his quiz, ticking off boxes without mind for how he came off. &ldquo;I\nneed someone I can talk to. Someone I can relate to. That&rsquo;s what really\nmatters. So I think the big deal breaker here&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;What\nis an absolute Must, with No Exceptions, is&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;That\nthey must&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>xxx</p><p>&ldquo;Love&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;Earth.&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;Earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Aziraphale looked over his answers. &ldquo;Yes, that should do nicely.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nsat back and smiled to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nI <i>wonder</i> who I&rsquo;ll be matched with?&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;And\nthat&rsquo;s my final word on the matter!&rdquo; said Crowley grandly, finishing the quiz\nwith a flourish.</p><p>He\nhad a feeling he would enjoy his next date immensely. </p><p><i>Whoever</i> he got, of course. <br /></p>",
