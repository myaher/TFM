I nervously fingered my lapiz lazuli pendant, a gift my grandmother had given me 17 years ago on my first birthday it was beautiful- the blue stone set in a delicate silver oval with little tendrils of silver on the edges. Then the door opened to admit in two large muscled winged males both with hazel eyes and shoulder length hair, they were both extremely handsome but then all the fae are. Before I could observe them properly my attention was caught by the two females entering the room one of them with long golden curls and brown eyes the color of freshly tilled soil was the most beautiful woman- or rather female- I had ever seen and beside her was a short petite femlae with poker straight, chin length inky black hair and quicksilver eyes, a chill went down my spine when I spotted her some deep, intrinsic part of me screaming at me to be wary of her, of the power I could see glimmering in her eyes. Before I could think about the scary and if I was being honest fascinating female the last member of their part entered the room and my heart stopped as I as gazed at devastatingly perfect features of the male I knew by the power roiling of him in waves by the wisps of dark emanating from him that was the high Lord. He looked at me with those remarkable violet eyes glimmering with what looked like stars, a few strands of his blue black hair brushing his eyebrows and smirked.</p>",

Before I could think about the scary and if I was being honest fascinating female the last member of their part entered the room and my heart stopped as I as gazed at devastatingly perfect features of the male I knew by the power roiling of him in waves by the wisps of dark emanating from him that was the high Lord.
