        "answer": "<p><b>Billy Batson</b>. The Champion of the Wizard SHAZAM, 13 years old, formally homeless he\u2019s picked up from streets by CPS and sent to a foster home. After being granted the power Billy develops limited magic outside of being the Captain. He uses a mix of his powers and a little help from Bruce Wayne to remove himself from the system and rent a small apartment which becomes the hub for the loose grouping of young heroes known as Super Sons. The Captain (Captain Thunder) is on the JSA and a reverse member of the Justice League. Often teaming with Superman, Batman (awkward) and Wonder Woman (fanboying!)\u00a0</p><p><b>Mary Bromfield/Batson</b>. Billy\u2019s 14 year old sister, given away for adoption at birth, her adoptive parents (the Bromfields) died when she was young and she ends up in Foster care system. The first of the\u00a0Vasquez\u2019s foster kids. Builds a close relationship with Billy when he first arrives at the Vazquez\u2019s. When Billy gets his powers he first chooses to share them with Mary and Freddy Freedman, and the lighting reveals that Mary and Billy are biological siblings. Mary splits her time between the\u00a0Vasquez\u2019s and Billy\u2019s apartment. She has a budding relationship with Freddy which Billy disapproves of. She heroes under the name Mary Marvel, a some time member of the loose female hero team Birds of Pray and a reserve member of the Teen Titans she often heroes along side Freddy, and sometimes with Billy and sometimes the 3 of them together as at the Marvels.\u00a0<br/></p><p><b>Freddy</b>\u00a0<b>Freeman</b>. Born with\u00a0cerebral palsy Freddy needs two crutches to help him walk and talks with slur to his speech. Bounced around the foster care system till eating at the Vazquez house about a year before Billy. Freddy is 13 years old and has a massive helpless crush on Mary which he was sure she couldn\u2019t feel back due to his disability. Freddy and Billy bond nearly at once and force a close friendship thanks to Freddy\u2019s prankster sense of humor and Billy\u2019s willingness to help Freddy with anything without comment. When first granted powers it\u2019s Freddy who names Mary saying she looks\u00a0\u201cMarvelous\u201d. Freddy takes the name Captain Marvel to emulate Mary but thanks to his short height and boyish face the press takes to jokingly calling him Captain Marvel\u00a0\u201cJr\u201d a name he can\u2019t shake no matter how hard he tries. Freddy is a Teen Titan and often teams up with Billy or Mary or both, and often with one or more of the\u00a0Lieutenants Marvel. Freddy mostly lives with Billy in his apartment having used the same magic/Wayne help to get out of the system.\u00a0</p><p><b>Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, Pedro Pe\u00f1a</b>. the\u00a0Vazquez\u2019s other foster children, In his first fight with Black Adam Billy grants all of his foster siblings powers transforming them into what Freddy jokingly calls the\u00a0Lieutenants Marvel. Unlike Freddy or Mary who got exact copies of Billy\u2019s powers for unclear reasons Eugene, Darla, and Pedro ended up with versions that emphasized one of the SHAZAM powers. Eugene age 15\u2032s powers emphasize\u00a0the Wisdom of Solomon, meaning when transformed he is super smart, has limited abilities to see the future can speak any language and has limited mind control powers (he can talk people into doing things if they\u2019re weak willed and he has enough time). Darla age 9\u2032s powers\u00a0emphasize\u00a0the Speed of Mercury, which means she has near flash levels of speed both while running and while flying and can teleport short distances, never out of sight. Pedro age 16\u2032s powers\u00a0emphasize\u00a0the Strength of Hercules which makes him one of the strongest beings on earth, stronger than Captain Thunder. While they each have the other SHAZAM powers these powers are lesser than they are with Billy, Mary or Freddy. the Lieutenants are only semi-active heroes, some times pairing up with Billy, Freddy or Mary, or in major crisis, otherwise it\u2019s school and home with the\u00a0Vazquez\u2019s<br/></p><p><b>Tawky Tawny</b>. the animal familiar of the Wizard SHAZAM, he looks like a large tiger, but his true nature is unclear. He generally hangs around sleeping at Billy\u2019s apartment, it\u2019s known he is highly magical though it\u2019s rare he shows it, he can speak and also transform into a house cat both of which he seems not to like doing. He often appears in Billy\u2019s dreams as a humanoid Tiger in a white suit often with a drink in hand to give messages from the Wizard or other warnings.<br/></p><p><b>Black Adam</b>: The first Champion of SHAZAM in Egypt over 4,000 years ago. Much like Billy a pure hearted boy with very little\u00a0Teth-Adam was corrupted by spending more and more time as Black Adam. Having lost his humanity he goes mad. SHAZAM is unable to take the Egyptian lighting from him and they war for many centuries till new gods, the Greeks, rise and SHAZAM can call forth a new champion who fights and seals Black Adam away but dies doing so. For close to 2,500 years Black Adam is sealed in an Egyptian grave till he\u2019s unearthed in the 1920s. He becomes a problem for Golden then Sliver and on forward heroes, till he\u2019s faced by a new modern Champion of SHAZAM who manages to force him to say\u00a0\u201cShazam\u201d Teth-Adam is reveled, a teenager the same age as Billy. Teth had been locked away in Black Adam\u2019s mind for so long his return to humanity undoes a lot of the corruption and when he becomes Black Adam he is guilty and looking for ways to make up for what he did. Black Adam joins the JSA and while he tries to do good the corruption and the hard edges are still there and Billy keeps a close eye on him and tries to get him to let Theo (his new name) out more often sure that will do him good.\u00a0</p>",
