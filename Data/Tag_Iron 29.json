You now have the job of collecting intel before missions on your own now, a task you have done four times now. Along with this lengthening of your leash, you have been thrillingly sneaking around with Tony. Anywhere you guys would pass each other a kiss would be shared, the occasional make-out session would also occur, time permitting. When you would attend Avengers meetings, sultry looks would be shared between you two across the room, but dispelling any suspicion by sharing snarky remarks. Even though the familiarity of your relationship was comfortable, today seemed like a day where things would take a turn. Your heels rhythmically tap along the floor as you walk to the board room where your presence was requested. You enter the door but stay in the door frame, holding your hands in front of you. Your greeted by the eyes of Nat, Wanda, and Vision. Steve was also in the room but his focus stayed on whatever was in front of him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou summoned me?\u201d You smirk at Steve and slowly head towards where he is seated.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI need you to bring this to Tony.\u201d Steve hands you a file then looks up, shock in his eyes for a brief moment. He quickly scanned your outfit, the sheer pink top with material that wasn\u2019t see-through but thin enough that flowed with the slightest of movement, the black pencil skirt the hits just above your knee and hugs your curves beautifully, and how your new bobbed twists frame your face perfectly. \u201cYou look\u2026different.\u201d You grab the file from his hand and hug it close to your chest.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d You grin and turn to walk out of the room. \u201cI\u2019ll get this to Tony right away.\u201d You wave the file in the air as you exit the still silent room, stunned by your new display of confidence. You continue through the compound, head to the elevator and press the button for the lower level. It makes its way down and as it moves, you mess with your hair and fix the way your shirt was tucked into your skirt. The elevator stops and opens and you take a deep breath before exiting and making your way down the stairs. Once you get to the door you knock on the glass and wave when you see Tony lookup. A second later the door opens up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWelcome, Ms. Fury.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y greets you as you walk in. You smile at her soothing voice as you make your way over to Tony who was focusing on something at his workbench. You peck his cheek but garner no attention.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve wanted me to give you these.\u201d You toss the file on the workbench and work your arms around Tony\u2019s torso, setting your chin on his shoulder. You move your hands up to feel his chest through his shirt. \u201cYou know, all work and no play makes Tony a dull boy.\u201d You trace your finger over his collarbone and kiss his earlobe, lips tracing down his neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been working on this for three days now. I\u2019m on the verge of figuring it out and I hit a wall.\u201d Tony reaches back to your head and gently runs his hand over your twists then lean his head on yours. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can distract you for a moment. Maybe relieve your mental block.\u201d You begin to slowly move your hands down but Tony lightly grasps your wrists and turns so he\u2019s facing you. He still held his grip on your wrists as he drapes your arms over his neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI would like that a lot, Ms. Fury.\u201d Tony wraps his arms around your waist to pull you into a passionate heated kiss. The level of passion that was so quickly achieved seemed almost automatic due to the number of make-out sessions that proceeded this. But this was different, this felt different. Tony\u2019s hands began to roam your back, one had docking on your butt and the other pulling you closer via your upper back. You two turn around so your back was now toward the workbench. Tony walks you backwards until your butt hits the workbench and, in what seemed to be unison, you jumped onto the workbench just as Tony went to lift you onto it. He separates your legs and steps forward, bringing himself closer to you, causing your skirt to move up. You two pull away for a moment to catch your breath, and you watch Tony\u2019s face as his eyes wander down your body. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d Tony points at your light pink thong then places his hand on your now exposed thigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot exactly. I wanted every part of my fit to be poppin\u2019 today and these just so happened to be included. Your love for it is just a bonus.\u201d You smile and bite your lip as you run your fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that the pop factor of your outfit won\u2019t be affected if you lost these\u2026\u201d He walks his fingers up your thigh, hooks his index finger on the waistband of your thong and pulls it down. You shift slightly in assistance then settle onto the cold workbench, the cool air of the lab hitting your pussy. He steps forward again and begins to kiss you again but push him away and smirk at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou see, I have a policy. Piece of clothing for a piece of clothing.\u201d You tug at the hem of his shirt. \u201cTake it off.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can make this pretty sexy, you know?\u201d He jirates his body as he slowly pulls off his shirt, making you belly laugh. He finally pulls it off and attempts to get close to you again, but you hold your arms out so you can admire his shirtless form. He didn\u2019t have the typical hard chiseled abs, but the tone that graced his abdomen was just as sexy. You ran your hands over his chest hair then place your arms around his neck again, allowing him to get close to you. His steps bring him closer this time, closer than the last two moments of kissing, and begins to devour your neck, making you moan and throw your head back. Your hands absentmindedly move up the back of his head, simultaneously pulling his head closer. Once he reaches your collarbone, he pulls back and begins to unbutton your blouse but not having enough patience to untuck it from your skirt. He then reaches around and unhooks your light pink bra that purposefully matched your underwear, letting the bra fall but not come completely off. He leans back and looked at you, making his mildly satisfied head shake that he does when he creates something extraordinary and tries to downplay it for his own ego. You smack his arm and laugh as he came back in, kissing your collarbone and continuing to move down until he catches your nipple. He takes the nub in his mouth, sucking it and swirling his tongue around it, then moves to the other one. While he worked on your breast, one of his hands roamed down to your pussy, running his index finger up your wet slit to your clit, rubbing circles and then removing his finger. He leaves your breast and looks into your eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know I made you feel this way.\u201d He smirks then places his index finger in his mouth, tasting your juices. He kisses you hard, making you taste yourself on his tongue.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPolicy.\u201d You sing, reminding him when he pulls away. He lowers his hand to you slit again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow about you remove it, but you have to do it while I make you squirm.\u201d He rubs your clit, then inserts a finger inside you. You gasp, but accept his challenge, running your hands down his abdomen to his belt buckle. He begins to move his finger in and out, getting enough lubrication then adding another finger. You moan as he moves his fingers but continue with his buckle, unlatching it and pulling it apart. He begins to circle your clit with his thumb as he continues to pump his fingers in and out of you. You stop at the sudden flow of pleasure, grabbing onto him and clawing into his back. After taking a few deep breaths, you continue with his pants, unbuttoning them and undoing the zipper. He shifts the motion of his fingers to long and slow, making you involuntarily grind your hips for a moment, but you gain enough sanity back to push down his pants and underwear enough for his dick to spring out. You look up into his eyes and give him a sultry smirk.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI win.\u201d You wrap your hand around him begin to move your hand up and down, slowly. \u201cIn more ways than one. Very well endowed, I see\u2026\u201d You move your hand a bit faster for a moment then stop, still holding on. He gives you a devilish smirk and begins to move his fingers faster, realizing that he fingers were stopped the moment before that. His thumb seems to rub circles on your clit at a similar speed, earning a loud moan, but you quickly respond by jerking Tony faster. His groan is deep, almost growl like, but the way it came out showed that he was surprised at the sudden feeling of pleasure. This competition to bring each other closer to their climax continued until Tony pulls his fingers from you, making you moan from the change of feeling. He grabs your wrist and removes your hand from his dick. You look up into his eyes, biting your lip as you watch him slowly lick your taste from his fingers. He then reaches to a drawer in the workbench that you didn\u2019t seem to notice, pulling out a condom.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy do you have a condom in there.\u201d You laugh, stroking his facial hair. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou never know what fun you\u2019ll catch yourself in.\u201d He opens it and slips it onto himself. \u201cThere are at least three in every drawer in here, and I change them regularly.\u201d He slips your shirt off your shoulder a bit more and pepper kisses along it. You copy his mildly satisfied face making Tony laugh and beam at you. His smile makes his eyes crinkle, and you match his loving smile with your own. He runs his hand up your thigh taking your skirt with it, lifting it to the point where your butt really touched the cold metal of the workbench. His hand finally makes its way to your lower back, pulling you closer to him. He slowly leans in and kisses you, soft but filled with passion. He pulls away and looks down to line himself up with your slit, pushing in slowly, making you whimper. He places his forehead on yours and once all the way in, he slowly pulls out, this action making you lowly gasp. He continues this motion, speeding up with each thrust, and subsequently filling the lab with louder sultry moans and groans. You reach down and rub your clit for a minute, enhancing your pleasure ten fold, but Tony reaches down and removes it, placing it back on the table. You look up at him, ecstasy and betrayal on your face and not even a second later, Tony replaces your hand with his own, rubbing your clit at varying speeds.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAhhh, yes! Fuck, Mr. Stark!\u201d You throw your head back and grasp on two him, scratching his back with full knowledge and anticipation for the scars that will be left. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou like that? Well, I like it when you call me Mr. Stark.\u201d He whisper and bites your shoulder, continuing to thrust and rub, the sound of his belt buckle rattling fading in with the whimpers dripping from your mouth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The room continued to be filled with moans, groans, cursing, and the occasional \u201cMr. Stark\u201d which would then be followed by another hearty groan as you two headed to your climaxes. His thrusts got faster and wilder as your grip on his back intensified. The rubbing he was doing on your clit increased in speed in reaction to him getting closer and losing all control of his body movements. In no time your reached your screaming point, grateful that you were far away from anyone that could hear you two. Tony continued to rub and thrust, reassuring you that he was close as you shook into your orgasm. Soon after he thrusted one final thrust, groaning as he came in the condom, he gradually slows his hand to stop on your clit but leaves it there for a moment longer. He lays his head on your shoulder as both of your breath heavily, trying to catch your breath, and then removes himself from you, taking the condom off and throwing it away. You can feel him smiling into your shoulder, making you smile as you lean your head on his. Suddenly there was a knock on the glass door, making you both jump. Tony quickly looks up then pulls you down to the floor from the workbench.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOw! What the fuck?!\u201d You curse, then follow Tony\u2019s gaze to the door, only peeking your head above the table. Out the door you see Steve, who was turned around and seemed to be blushing down his arms, and Nat, who simply smirked and waved at you two. You slowly turn your head to Tony to look at him with concern.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, at least we had fun.\u201d He grins, making you laugh and hit his arm.</p><p>_____</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You guys make your way up to the open living room/kitchen area where everyone seemed to be gathered, following Tony to the couch where he sat in the last available spot then pats his lap to prompt you to sit, and you do so. You wrap your arms around his neck and watch as everyone except for Clint seems to hand Nat a twenty dollar bill, which she hands half of the collection to Clint. You tilt your head at her and what for an answer for your seemingly obvious, unspoken question.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou seemed like his type.\u201d She shrugs and smiles at you, then hands you one of her twenties. You accept it with a straight face and stuff it your bra, then grin at the somber mood that fell over the room for a moment. Everyone begins to chat again and you turn your head to look at Tony, giving him one last small kiss before engaging in the conversation.</p>",

You now have the job of collecting intel before missions on your own now, a task you have done four times now. Along with this lengthening of your leash, you have been thrillingly sneaking around with Tony. Anywhere you guys would pass each other a kiss would be shared, the occasional make-out session would also occur, time permitting. When you would attend Avengers meetings, sultry looks would be shared between you two across the room, but dispelling any suspicion by sharing snarky remarks. Even though the familiarity of your relationship was comfortable, today seemed like a day where things would take a turn. Your heels rhythmically tap along the floor as you walk to the board room where your presence was requested. You enter the door but stay in the door frame, holding your hands in front of you. Your greeted by the eyes of Nat, Wanda, and Vision. Steve was also in the room but his focus stayed on whatever was in front of him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou summoned me?\u201d You smirk at Steve and slowly head towards where he is seated.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI need you to bring this to Tony.\u201d Steve hands you a file then looks up, shock in his eyes for a brief moment. He quickly scanned your outfit, the sheer pink top with material that wasn\u2019t see-through but thin enough that flowed with the slightest of movement, the black pencil skirt the hits just above your knee and hugs your curves beautifully, and how your new bobbed twists frame your face perfectly. \u201cYou look\u2026different.\u201d You grab the file from his hand and hug it close to your chest.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d You grin and turn to walk out of the room. \u201cI\u2019ll get this to Tony right away.\u201d You wave the file in the air as you exit the still silent room, stunned by your new display of confidence. You continue through the compound, head to the elevator and press the button for the lower level. It makes its way down and as it moves, you mess with your hair and fix the way your shirt was tucked into your skirt. The elevator stops and opens and you take a deep breath before exiting and making your way down the stairs. Once you get to the door you knock on the glass and wave when you see Tony lookup. A second later the door opens up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWelcome, Ms. Fury.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y greets you as you walk in. You smile at her soothing voice as you make your way over to Tony who was focusing on something at his workbench. You peck his cheek but garner no attention.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve wanted me to give you these.\u201d You toss the file on the workbench and work your arms around Tony\u2019s torso, setting your chin on his shoulder. You move your hands up to feel his chest through his shirt. \u201cYou know, all work and no play makes Tony a dull boy.\u201d You trace your finger over his collarbone and kiss his earlobe, lips tracing down his neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been working on this for three days now. I\u2019m on the verge of figuring it out and I hit a wall.\u201d Tony reaches back to your head and gently runs his hand over your twists then lean his head on yours. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can distract you for a moment. Maybe relieve your mental block.\u201d You begin to slowly move your hands down but Tony lightly grasps your wrists and turns so he\u2019s facing you. He still held his grip on your wrists as he drapes your arms over his neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI would like that a lot, Ms. Fury.\u201d Tony wraps his arms around your waist to pull you into a passionate heated kiss. The level of passion that was so quickly achieved seemed almost automatic due to the number of make-out sessions that proceeded this. But this was different, this felt different. Tony\u2019s hands began to roam your back, one had docking on your butt and the other pulling you closer via your upper back. You two turn around so your back was now toward the workbench. Tony walks you backwards until your butt hits the workbench and, in what seemed to be unison, you jumped onto the workbench just as Tony went to lift you onto it. He separates your legs and steps forward, bringing himself closer to you, causing your skirt to move up. You two pull away for a moment to catch your breath, and you watch Tony\u2019s face as his eyes wander down your body. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d Tony points at your light pink thong then places his hand on your now exposed thigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot exactly. I wanted every part of my fit to be poppin\u2019 today and these just so happened to be included. Your love for it is just a bonus.\u201d You smile and bite your lip as you run your fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that the pop factor of your outfit won\u2019t be affected if you lost these\u2026\u201d He walks his fingers up your thigh, hooks his index finger on the waistband of your thong and pulls it down. You shift slightly in assistance then settle onto the cold workbench, the cool air of the lab hitting your pussy. He steps forward again and begins to kiss you again but push him away and smirk at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou see, I have a policy. Piece of clothing for a piece of clothing.\u201d You tug at the hem of his shirt. \u201cTake it off.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can make this pretty sexy, you know?\u201d He jirates his body as he slowly pulls off his shirt, making you belly laugh. He finally pulls it off and attempts to get close to you again, but you hold your arms out so you can admire his shirtless form. He didn\u2019t have the typical hard chiseled abs, but the tone that graced his abdomen was just as sexy. You ran your hands over his chest hair then place your arms around his neck again, allowing him to get close to you. His steps bring him closer this time, closer than the last two moments of kissing, and begins to devour your neck, making you moan and throw your head back. Your hands absentmindedly move up the back of his head, simultaneously pulling his head closer. Once he reaches your collarbone, he pulls back and begins to unbutton your blouse but not having enough patience to untuck it from your skirt. He then reaches around and unhooks your light pink bra that purposefully matched your underwear, letting the bra fall but not come completely off. He leans back and looked at you, making his mildly satisfied head shake that he does when he creates something extraordinary and tries to downplay it for his own ego. You smack his arm and laugh as he came back in, kissing your collarbone and continuing to move down until he catches your nipple. He takes the nub in his mouth, sucking it and swirling his tongue around it, then moves to the other one. While he worked on your breast, one of his hands roamed down to your pussy, running his index finger up your wet slit to your clit, rubbing circles and then removing his finger. He leaves your breast and looks into your eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know I made you feel this way.\u201d He smirks then places his index finger in his mouth, tasting your juices. He kisses you hard, making you taste yourself on his tongue.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPolicy.\u201d You sing, reminding him when he pulls away. He lowers his hand to you slit again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow about you remove it, but you have to do it while I make you squirm.\u201d He rubs your clit, then inserts a finger inside you. You gasp, but accept his challenge, running your hands down his abdomen to his belt buckle. He begins to move his finger in and out, getting enough lubrication then adding another finger. You moan as he moves his fingers but continue with his buckle, unlatching it and pulling it apart. He begins to circle your clit with his thumb as he continues to pump his fingers in and out of you. You stop at the sudden flow of pleasure, grabbing onto him and clawing into his back. After taking a few deep breaths, you continue with his pants, unbuttoning them and undoing the zipper. He shifts the motion of his fingers to long and slow, making you involuntarily grind your hips for a moment, but you gain enough sanity back to push down his pants and underwear enough for his dick to spring out. You look up into his eyes and give him a sultry smirk.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI win.\u201d You wrap your hand around him begin to move your hand up and down, slowly. \u201cIn more ways than one. Very well endowed, I see\u2026\u201d You move your hand a bit faster for a moment then stop, still holding on. He gives you a devilish smirk and begins to move his fingers faster, realizing that he fingers were stopped the moment before that. His thumb seems to rub circles on your clit at a similar speed, earning a loud moan, but you quickly respond by jerking Tony faster. His groan is deep, almost growl like, but the way it came out showed that he was surprised at the sudden feeling of pleasure. This competition to bring each other closer to their climax continued until Tony pulls his fingers from you, making you moan from the change of feeling. He grabs your wrist and removes your hand from his dick. You look up into his eyes, biting your lip as you watch him slowly lick your taste from his fingers. He then reaches to a drawer in the workbench that you didn\u2019t seem to notice, pulling out a condom.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy do you have a condom in there.\u201d You laugh, stroking his facial hair. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou never know what fun you\u2019ll catch yourself in.\u201d He opens it and slips it onto himself. \u201cThere are at least three in every drawer in here, and I change them regularly.\u201d He slips your shirt off your shoulder a bit more and pepper kisses along it. You copy his mildly satisfied face making Tony laugh and beam at you. His smile makes his eyes crinkle, and you match his loving smile with your own. He runs his hand up your thigh taking your skirt with it, lifting it to the point where your butt really touched the cold metal of the workbench. His hand finally makes its way to your lower back, pulling you closer to him. He slowly leans in and kisses you, soft but filled with passion. He pulls away and looks down to line himself up with your slit, pushing in slowly, making you whimper. He places his forehead on yours and once all the way in, he slowly pulls out, this action making you lowly gasp. He continues this motion, speeding up with each thrust, and subsequently filling the lab with louder sultry moans and groans. You reach down and rub your clit for a minute, enhancing your pleasure ten fold, but Tony reaches down and removes it, placing it back on the table. You look up at him, ecstasy and betrayal on your face and not even a second later, Tony replaces your hand with his own, rubbing your clit at varying speeds.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAhhh, yes! Fuck, Mr. Stark!\u201d You throw your head back and grasp on two him, scratching his back with full knowledge and anticipation for the scars that will be left. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou like that? Well, I like it when you call me Mr. Stark.\u201d He whisper and bites your shoulder, continuing to thrust and rub, the sound of his belt buckle rattling fading in with the whimpers dripping from your mouth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The room continued to be filled with moans, groans, cursing, and the occasional \u201cMr. Stark\u201d which would then be followed by another hearty groan as you two headed to your climaxes. His thrusts got faster and wilder as your grip on his back intensified. The rubbing he was doing on your clit increased in speed in reaction to him getting closer and losing all control of his body movements. In no time your reached your screaming point, grateful that you were far away from anyone that could hear you two. Tony continued to rub and thrust, reassuring you that he was close as you shook into your orgasm. Soon after he thrusted one final thrust, groaning as he came in the condom, he gradually slows his hand to stop on your clit but leaves it there for a moment longer. He lays his head on your shoulder as both of your breath heavily, trying to catch your breath, and then removes himself from you, taking the condom off and throwing it away. You can feel him smiling into your shoulder, making you smile as you lean your head on his. Suddenly there was a knock on the glass door, making you both jump. Tony quickly looks up then pulls you down to the floor from the workbench.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOw! What the fuck?!\u201d You curse, then follow Tony\u2019s gaze to the door, only peeking your head above the table. Out the door you see Steve, who was turned around and seemed to be blushing down his arms, and Nat, who simply smirked and waved at you two. You slowly turn your head to Tony to look at him with concern.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, at least we had fun.\u201d He grins, making you laugh and hit his arm.</p><p>_____</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You guys make your way up to the open living room/kitchen area where everyone seemed to be gathered, following Tony to the couch where he sat in the last available spot then pats his lap to prompt you to sit, and you do so. You wrap your arms around his neck and watch as everyone except for Clint seems to hand Nat a twenty dollar bill, which she hands half of the collection to Clint. You tilt your head at her and what for an answer for your seemingly obvious, unspoken question.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou seemed like his type.\u201d She shrugs and smiles at you, then hands you one of her twenties. You accept it with a straight face and stuff it your bra, then grin at the somber mood that fell over the room for a moment. Everyone begins to chat again and you turn your head to look at Tony, giving him one last small kiss before engaging in the conversation.</p></p>",

I wanted every part of my fit to be poppin\u2019 today and these just so happened to be included. Your love for it is just a bonus.\u201d You smile and bite your lip as you run your fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that the pop factor of your outfit won\u2019t be affected if you lost these\u2026\u201d He walks his fingers up your thigh, hooks his index finger on the waistband of your thong and pulls it down. You shift slightly in assistance then settle onto the cold workbench, the cool air of the lab hitting your pussy. He steps forward again and begins to kiss you again but push him away and smirk at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou see, I have a policy. Piece of clothing for a piece of clothing.\u201d You tug at the hem of his shirt. \u201cTake it off.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can make this pretty sexy, you know?\u201d He jirates his body as he slowly pulls off his shirt, making you belly laugh. He finally pulls it off and attempts to get close to you again, but you hold your arms out so you can admire his shirtless form. He didn\u2019t have the typical hard chiseled abs, but the tone that graced his abdomen was just as sexy. You ran your hands over his chest hair then place your arms around his neck again, allowing him to get close to you. His steps bring him closer this time, closer than the last two moments of kissing, and begins to devour your neck, making you moan and throw your head back. Your hands absentmindedly move up the back of his head, simultaneously pulling his head closer. Once he reaches your collarbone, he pulls back and begins to unbutton your blouse but not having enough patience to untuck it from your skirt. He then reaches around and unhooks your light pink bra that purposefully matched your underwear, letting the bra fall but not come completely off. He leans back and looked at you, making his mildly satisfied head shake that he does when he creates something extraordinary and tries to downplay it for his own ego. You smack his arm and laugh as he came back in, kissing your collarbone and continuing to move down until he catches your nipple. He takes the nub in his mouth, sucking it and swirling his tongue around it, then moves to the other one. While he worked on your breast, one of his hands roamed down to your pussy, running his index finger up your wet slit to your clit, rubbing circles and then removing his finger. He leaves your breast and looks into your eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know I made you feel this way.\u201d He smirks then places his index finger in his mouth, tasting your juices. He kisses you hard, making you taste yourself on his tongue.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPolicy.\u201d You sing, reminding him when he pulls away. He lowers his hand to you slit again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow about you remove it, but you have to do it while I make you squirm.\u201d He rubs your clit, then inserts a finger inside you. You gasp, but accept his challenge, running your hands down his abdomen to his belt buckle. He begins to move his finger in and out, getting enough lubrication then adding another finger. You moan as he moves his fingers but continue with his buckle, unlatching it and pulling it apart. He begins to circle your clit with his thumb as he continues to pump his fingers in and out of you. You stop at the sudden flow of pleasure, grabbing onto him and clawing into his back. After taking a few deep breaths, you continue with his pants, unbuttoning them and undoing the zipper. He shifts the motion of his fingers to long and slow, making you involuntarily grind your hips for a moment, but you gain enough sanity back to push down his pants and underwear enough for his dick to spring out. You look up into his eyes and give him a sultry smirk.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI win.\u201d You wrap your hand around him begin to move your hand up and down, slowly. \u201cIn more ways than one. Very well endowed, I see\u2026\u201d You move your hand a bit faster for a moment then stop, still holding on. He gives you a devilish smirk and begins to move his fingers faster, realizing that he fingers were stopped the moment before that. His thumb seems to rub circles on your clit at a similar speed, earning a loud moan, but you quickly respond by jerking Tony faster. His groan is deep, almost growl like, but the way it came out showed that he was surprised at the sudden feeling of pleasure. This competition to bring each other closer to their climax continued until Tony pulls his fingers from you, making you moan from the change of feeling. He grabs your wrist and removes your hand from his dick. You look up into his eyes, biting your lip as you watch him slowly lick your taste from his fingers. He then reaches to a drawer in the workbench that you didn\u2019t seem to notice, pulling out a condom.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy do you have a condom in there.\u201d You laugh, stroking his facial hair. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou never know what fun you\u2019ll catch yourself in.\u201d He opens it and slips it onto himself. \u201cThere are at least three in every drawer in here, and I change them regularly.\u201d He slips your shirt off your shoulder a bit more and pepper kisses along it. You copy his mildly satisfied face making Tony laugh and beam at you. His smile makes his eyes crinkle, and you match his loving smile with your own. He runs his hand up your thigh taking your skirt with it, lifting it to the point where your butt really touched the cold metal of the workbench. His hand finally makes its way to your lower back, pulling you closer to him. He slowly leans in and kisses you, soft but filled with passion. He pulls away and looks down to line himself up with your slit, pushing in slowly, making you whimper. He places his forehead on yours and once all the way in, he slowly pulls out, this action making you lowly gasp. He continues this motion, speeding up with each thrust, and subsequently filling the lab with louder sultry moans and groans. You reach down and rub your clit for a minute, enhancing your pleasure ten fold, but Tony reaches down and removes it, placing it back on the table. You look up at him, ecstasy and betrayal on your face and not even a second later, Tony replaces your hand with his own, rubbing your clit at varying speeds.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAhhh, yes! Fuck, Mr. Stark!\u201d You throw your head back and grasp on two him, scratching his back with full knowledge and anticipation for the scars that will be left. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou like that? Well, I like it when you call me Mr. Stark.\u201d He whisper and bites your shoulder, continuing to thrust and rub, the sound of his belt buckle rattling fading in with the whimpers dripping from your mouth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The room continued to be filled with moans, groans, cursing, and the occasional \u201cMr. Stark\u201d which would then be followed by another hearty groan as you two headed to your climaxes. His thrusts got faster and wilder as your grip on his back intensified. The rubbing he was doing on your clit increased in speed in reaction to him getting closer and losing all control of his body movements. In no time your reached your screaming point, grateful that you were far away from anyone that could hear you two. Tony continued to rub and thrust, reassuring you that he was close as you shook into your orgasm. Soon after he thrusted one final thrust, groaning as he came in the condom, he gradually slows his hand to stop on your clit but leaves it there for a moment longer. He lays his head on your shoulder as both of your breath heavily, trying to catch your breath, and then removes himself from you, taking the condom off and throwing it away. You can feel him smiling into your shoulder, making you smile as you lean your head on his. Suddenly there was a knock on the glass door, making you both jump. Tony quickly looks up then pulls you down to the floor from the workbench.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOw! What the fuck?!\u201d You curse, then follow Tony\u2019s gaze to the door, only peeking your head above the table. Out the door you see Steve, who was turned around and seemed to be blushing down his arms, and Nat, who simply smirked and waved at you two. You slowly turn your head to Tony to look at him with concern.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, at least we had fun.\u201d He grins, making you laugh and hit his arm.</p><p>_____</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You guys make your way up to the open living room/kitchen area where everyone seemed to be gathered, following Tony to the couch where he sat in the last available spot then pats his lap to prompt you to sit, and you do so. You wrap your arms around his neck and watch as everyone except for Clint seems to hand Nat a twenty dollar bill, which she hands half of the collection to Clint. You tilt your head at her and what for an answer for your seemingly obvious, unspoken question.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou seemed like his type.\u201d She shrugs and smiles at you, then hands you one of her twenties. You accept it with a straight face and stuff it your bra, then grin at the somber mood that fell over the room for a moment. Everyone begins to chat again and you turn your head to look at Tony, giving him one last small kiss before engaging in the conversation.</p></p>",

You now have the job of collecting intel before missions on your own now, a task you have done four times now. Along with this lengthening of your leash, you have been thrillingly sneaking around with Tony. Anywhere you guys would pass each other a kiss would be shared, the occasional make-out session would also occur, time permitting. When you would attend Avengers meetings, sultry looks would be shared between you two across the room, but dispelling any suspicion by sharing snarky remarks. Even though the familiarity of your relationship was comfortable, today seemed like a day where things would take a turn. Your heels rhythmically tap along the floor as you walk to the board room where your presence was requested. You enter the door but stay in the door frame, holding your hands in front of you. Your greeted by the eyes of Nat, Wanda, and Vision. Steve was also in the room but his focus stayed on whatever was in front of him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You summoned me?&rdquo; You smirk at Steve and slowly head towards where he is seated.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I need you to bring this to Tony.&rdquo; Steve hands you a file then looks up, shock in his eyes for a brief moment. He quickly scanned your outfit, the sheer pink top with material that wasn&rsquo;t see-through but thin enough that flowed with the slightest of movement, the black pencil skirt the hits just above your knee and hugs your curves beautifully, and how your new bobbed twists frame your face perfectly. &ldquo;You look&hellip;different.&rdquo; You grab the file from his hand and hug it close to your chest.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; You grin and turn to walk out of the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get this to Tony right away.&rdquo; You wave the file in the air as you exit the still silent room, stunned by your new display of confidence. You continue through the compound, head to the elevator and press the button for the lower level. It makes its way down and as it moves, you mess with your hair and fix the way your shirt was tucked into your skirt. The elevator stops and opens and you take a deep breath before exiting and making your way down the stairs. Once you get to the door you knock on the glass and wave when you see Tony lookup. A second later the door opens up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome, Ms. Fury.&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y greets you as you walk in. You smile at her soothing voice as you make your way over to Tony who was focusing on something at his workbench. You peck his cheek but garner no attention.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Steve wanted me to give you these.&rdquo; You toss the file on the workbench and work your arms around Tony&rsquo;s torso, setting your chin on his shoulder. You move your hands up to feel his chest through his shirt. &ldquo;You know, all work and no play makes Tony a dull boy.&rdquo; You trace your finger over his collarbone and kiss his earlobe, lips tracing down his neck.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working on this for three days now. I&rsquo;m on the verge of figuring it out and I hit a wall.&rdquo; Tony reaches back to your head and gently runs his hand over your twists then lean his head on yours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can distract you for a moment. Maybe relieve your mental block.&rdquo; You begin to slowly move your hands down but Tony lightly grasps your wrists and turns so he&rsquo;s facing you. He still held his grip on your wrists as he drapes your arms over his neck.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I would like that a lot, Ms. Fury.&rdquo; Tony wraps his arms around your waist to pull you into a passionate heated kiss. The level of passion that was so quickly achieved seemed almost automatic due to the number of make-out sessions that proceeded this. But this was different, this felt different. Tony&rsquo;s hands began to roam your back, one had docking on your butt and the other pulling you closer via your upper back. You two turn around so your back was now toward the workbench. Tony walks you backwards until your butt hits the workbench and, in what seemed to be unison, you jumped onto the workbench just as Tony went to lift you onto it. He separates your legs and steps forward, bringing himself closer to you, causing your skirt to move up. You two pull away for a moment to catch your breath, and you watch Tony&rsquo;s face as his eyes wander down your body. &ldquo;Are those for me?&rdquo; Tony points at your light pink thong then places his hand on your now exposed thigh.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not exactly. I wanted every part of my fit to be poppin&rsquo; today and these just so happened to be included. Your love for it is just a bonus.&rdquo; You smile and bite your lip as you run your fingers through his hair.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure that the pop factor of your outfit won&rsquo;t be affected if you lost these&hellip;&rdquo; He walks his fingers up your thigh, hooks his index finger on the waistband of your thong and pulls it down. You shift slightly in assistance then settle onto the cold workbench, the cool air of the lab hitting your pussy. He steps forward again and begins to kiss you again but push him away and smirk at him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You see, I have a policy. Piece of clothing for a piece of clothing.&rdquo; You tug at the hem of his shirt. &ldquo;Take it off.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can make this pretty sexy, you know?&rdquo; He jirates his body as he slowly pulls off his shirt, making you belly laugh. He finally pulls it off and attempts to get close to you again, but you hold your arms out so you can admire his shirtless form. He didn&rsquo;t have the typical hard chiseled abs, but the tone that graced his abdomen was just as sexy. You ran your hands over his chest hair then place your arms around his neck again, allowing him to get close to you. His steps bring him closer this time, closer than the last two moments of kissing, and begins to devour your neck, making you moan and throw your head back.

He gives you a devilish smirk and begins to move his fingers faster, realizing that he fingers were stopped the moment before that. His thumb seems to rub circles on your clit at a similar speed, earning a loud moan, but you quickly respond by jerking Tony faster. His groan is deep, almost growl like, but the way it came out showed that he was surprised at the sudden feeling of pleasure. This competition to bring each other closer to their climax continued until Tony pulls his fingers from you, making you moan from the change of feeling. He grabs your wrist and removes your hand from his dick. You look up into his eyes, biting your lip as you watch him slowly lick your taste from his fingers.

I know you&rsquo;ll do me proud. Love you.&rdquo; You can hear the sentiment of his words through the phone, making you smile one last time as you respond.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you, too.&rdquo; You hang up your phone and place it in your purse as you continue down the hall into a lounge area that also contained a small dining table. You look around for some sign of life that was supposed to greet you, jumping and turning around when you hear a firm voice behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, if we startled you. You must be Ms. Fury.&rdquo; The blonde man smiles and sticks his hand out and you promptly shake it, then shift your gaze to the redhead that was standing to his left and holding out her hand, which you also shake. You step back and nod, giving them both polite smiles. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but you can call me Y/N. You must be Captain Rogers and Agent Romanoff. Nice to meet both of you. &rdquo; You adjust your purse on your shoulder and clasp your hands in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you too, Y/N.&rdquo; Agent Romanoff grins at you. This action seems to be to most joy she could muster up at the moment. &ldquo;I guess we should show you around.&rdquo; She chuckles then leads you to where you assume they came into the room from.</p><p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll debrief you on your duties as we walk. Welcome to the team.&rdquo; Captain Rogers pats you on the should and also gives you a warm grin.</p><p>As you walked up and down halls and take a number of elevator rides, Steve and Natasha, as they have ask you to call them, explained what you will do as an intern as well as where certain rooms are and explaining to me members that I will regularly be seeing. At this point you guys were in the elevator headed to the lower level which was where the lab was located for none other that Tony Stark. Growing up, your uncle decided that it would be best for you to not know what was going on at his job, but when he began dealing with Tony he couldn&rsquo;t help but vent about this reckless Avengers recruit. Once the elevator comes to a halt, you follow Steve and Nat out the elevator and down the flight of steps to what you can only assume to be the lab. The entrance had a window and a glass door, allowing you to see Tony pointing at machines that then promptly perform tasks. As you watch him work, Steve types in a code that open the door, letting you and Nat enter first then closely following suit. He coughs subtly to get Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cAh, Star Spangled Spandex. Who do we have here?\u201d Tony meets eyes with you and gives you a snide grin. His eyes seem to roam down your body for a moment before making eye contact again. </p><p>\u201cThis is Y/N. She\u2019s the new intern.\u201d Steve rolls his eyes then places his hand on your shoulder, shaking you a bit.</p><p>\u201cFury has good taste.\u201d Tony now blatantly leans back slightly and looking you up and down again, bring in his bottom lip slightly while smiling. Typically this behavior would have ticked you off, and sure there was a part of you right now that wanted to smack that smug grin right off his face, but the main part of you enjoyed the fact that this genius billionaire fuckboy that your Uncle despises was attracted to you. \u201cI remember when he brought me you, Natalie\u2026\u201d He stands up straight again and tilts his head toward Natasha. You look between the two as you question for a moment whether Nat\u2019s name is Natasha or Natalie.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, he&rsquo;s not always an ass. Sometimes he&rsquo;s asleep.\u201d Steve comments, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cTony, Y/N is Fury\u2019s niece.\u201d Nat says with an even more smug grin. Tony looks back at you, shock in his eyes as a large sinister smirk grew on his face.</p><p>&quot;Hmm\u2026 Well, welcome to the team. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll enjoy every moment.&rdquo; He sticks out his hand which you lightly grab and shake. The firmness of your grasp would typically be unacceptable, but somehow it seemed fitting. You give Tony a small smile, observing his peppered facial hair and kind eyes. Your breath hitches for a moment and your heartbeat speeds up when he flashes a larger smile at you.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have a bit more to see so we should get going.\u201d Steve says then turns to leave, Nat following his motions. You begin to follow but stop and turn your head back to Tony.</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice to meet you, Mr. Stark.\u201d You give him a sweet grin. If you were able to read his mind you would\u2019ve known the shock that he felt when he heard you speak for what he realized to be the first time. The way your voice moved to his ears and how its naturally sultry sound did something to him that he wasn\u2019t used to.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, too. And please, call me Tony.\u201d He responds, crossing his arms by placing one arm over the other across his body instead of through each other.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Tony.\u201d You nod and follow behind Nat.</p><p>_____</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since you started your internship and already the work was piling up. Along with the occasional coffee and lunch runs, your main work has been to look over mission briefings and taking and analyzing data from meetings, so you\u2019ve already gotten accustomed to staying late at the compound. So much so that you have a couple of comfy shirts and pants tucked away in Nat\u2019s dresser. So there you were, cuddled up on the couch in the open living room/kitchen area underneath the fluffy blanket that you secretly kept in Steve\u2019s room, thumbing through pages of data three hours past the time you were supposed to go home for the second time this week. You were so engrossed in your work that you didn&rsquo;t hear someone enter the kitchen and open the fridge, but you did jump when you heard the fridge close. You turn to your left to see Tony smirking at you with a large pizza box on the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Working late again?&rdquo; He opens the box and takes out a slice. &ldquo;Pizza?&rdquo; He lift his slice towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes and\u2026 sure.&rdquo; You close the file that you had and put it on the coffee table, then move a braid that didn&rsquo;t make it in your quick bun behind your ear. You stand, still wrapped in your blanket, and head to the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, there is such thing as working too hard. And I think your five steps past that. &rdquo; Tony says as you grab a plate. He places a slice on it then turns to the microwave to take his piece out, turning back to you to grab your plate and place it in the microwave.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. But it just feels natural, like I&rsquo;m supposed to do all of this.&rdquo; The microwave beeps and you take out your piece, closing the door with your head. You walk over to the fridge and grab the ranch, pouring some on your plate then putting it back. \u201cWith my uncle as the executive head of S.H.I.E.L.D, it feels like everyone expects me to be great and it gets to me. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been my entire life, trying to hard to live up to the expectations that people set for me, sometimes burning myself out\u2026\u201d You shake your head and dip your pizza in ranch then take a bite.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you doing all of this?\u201d Tony motions around you then around the couch. He picks up his pizza and takes a bite, lifting an eyebrow in anticipation for your answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working my way up. I want to make my uncle proud. Trust me, Imma be runnin this place in no time.\u201d You smirk and do an exaggerated head flip, making Tony laugh and soon after you join him.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I better stay in your good graces if your gonna be my boss one day.\u201d Tony leans on the counter and grins at you. As you look into his eyes you realize that they\u2019re the reason you didn\u2019t smack him into last week down in his lab. No matter how he acted, his eyes gave his real emotions away everytime. The way he looked at you was filled with such admiration, such wonder for how someone as wonderful as you could stroll into his life. He may act like an ass but you could tell through the way he looked at you that he would do anything for you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don&rsquo;t think you\u2019ll ever fall from my good graces.\u201d You copy his position and lean against the counter, letting a small smile grow on your face.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d He asks, taking a step toward you and stooping his head slightly to compensate for the two inches he has on you.</p><p>\u201cBecause I like you, Tony. You\u2019re a likeable man. It\u2019s hard not to like you.\u201d You shrug and smile at him. He takes another step toward you and your chest raises as an involuntary response to his movements.</p><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026 I don\u2019t think your uncle would agree.\u201d Tony wraps his arm around you and pulls you flush against him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I care.\u201d As you finish your remark, Tony brings his face towards your and you bring your face towards his in response.You raise your hands to his chest as your lips finally connect with his and begin to move in time. It started off with just your lips fighting for dominance but once the time was right Tony slips in his tongue and that fight begins. You wrap your arms around his neck as one of your hands start to run up his black and grey peppered hair. The blanket that was previously hanging on your shoulders was now on the the floor as Tony\u2019s hands roamed slowly up and down your back, every once in a while touching your butt and giving it a small squeeze, making you smile into the kiss. Eventually you both have a need to take a breath and pull away, heaving deeply for a moment then both airily laughing. Tony looks over your face for a moment longer then, lifting his hand to move your rouge braid back behind your ear.</p><p>\u201cYou should get home. Sleep in your own bed. I heard that such practices are done by all aspiring heads of superhero organizations.\u201d He caresses your cheek then pulls away from you, running his fingers along your sides then fully pulling away to, first, hand you your blanket, then, moving around you, to put the pizza box back into the fridge. The loss of contact saddens your mood slightly but you soon begin to clean too, throwing away the plates that you two used then rolling up your blanket so it wasn\u2019t touching the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I would want to do as the greats did.\u201d You head over to the coffee table and gather up the file that was thrown on top.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride home? I can get Happy to drive you.\u201d You hug your items tight to your chest as Tony struts to you then runs his fingers along your hip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Happy would be very happy with me if you called him at midnight. I can get a cab.\u201d You step closer to him, craving the touch of his lips on yours one last time. You partially get your wish, receiving a quick, parting kiss from Tony.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d He backs his upper body away so he can get a better look at your face.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d You respond then leave his grip. You turn and move toward the elevator, pressing the button then turning your head back to him and grinning. The elevator beeps and you walk in, waving at Tony as the door closes.</p><p><a href=\"https://non-stop-imagines.tumblr.com/post/185257658676/heres-part-1-pairing-tony-stark-x\">Part 2</a></p>",

I heard that such practices are done by all aspiring heads of superhero organizations.\u201d He caresses your cheek then pulls away from you, running his fingers along your sides then fully pulling away to, first, hand you your blanket, then, moving around you, to put the pizza box back into the fridge. The loss of contact saddens your mood slightly but you soon begin to clean too, throwing away the plates that you two used then rolling up your blanket so it wasn\u2019t touching the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I would want to do as the greats did.\u201d You head over to the coffee table and gather up the file that was thrown on top.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride home? I can get Happy to drive you.\u201d You hug your items tight to your chest as Tony struts to you then runs his fingers along your hip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Happy would be very happy with me if you called him at midnight. I can get a cab.\u201d You step closer to him, craving the touch of his lips on yours one last time. You partially get your wish, receiving a quick, parting kiss from Tony.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d He backs his upper body away so he can get a better look at your face.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d You respond then leave his grip. You turn and move toward the elevator, pressing the button then turning your head back to him and grinning. The elevator beeps and you walk in, waving at Tony as the door closes.</p><p><a href=\"https://non-stop-imagines.tumblr.com/post/185257658676/heres-part-1-pairing-tony-stark-x\">Part 2</a></p></p>",

You turn around to the mirror behind you and fix your braids, defining the part by flipping braids to their corresponding sides and fixing the gold braid cuffs latched around a select few.</p><p>\u201cSteve should be there to greet you.

I\u2019m at the floor. Everything will be fine. I\u2019ll call you after my first day. Thank you again, by the way.\u201d You smile into the phone and step out the elevator then turn right towards what seems to be an opening.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, ladybug. I know you\u2019ll do me proud. Love you.\u201d You can hear the sentiment of his words through the phone, making you smile one last time as you respond.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d You hang up your phone and place it in your purse as you continue down the hall into a lounge area that also contained a small dining table. You look around for some sign of life that was supposed to greet you, jumping and turning around when you hear a firm voice behind you.</p><p>\u201cSorry, if we startled you. You must be Ms. Fury.\u201d The blonde man smiles and sticks his hand out and you promptly shake it, then shift your gaze to the redhead that was standing to his left and holding out her hand, which you also shake. You step back and nod, giving them both polite smiles. </p><p>\u201cYes, but you can call me Y/N. You must be Captain Rogers and Agent Romanoff. Nice to meet both of you. \u201d You adjust your purse on your shoulder and clasp your hands in front of you.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too, Y/N.\u201d Agent Romanoff grins at you. This action seems to be to most joy she could muster up at the moment. \u201cI guess we should show you around.\u201d She chuckles then leads you to where you assume they came into the room from.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll debrief you on your duties as we walk. Welcome to the team.\u201d Captain Rogers pats you on the should and also gives you a warm grin.</p><p>As you walked up and down halls and take a number of elevator rides, Steve and Natasha, as they have ask you to call them, explained what you will do as an intern as well as where certain rooms are and explaining to me members that I will regularly be seeing. At this point you guys were in the elevator headed to the lower level which was where the lab was located for none other that Tony Stark. Growing up, your uncle decided that it would be best for you to not know what was going on at his job, but when he began dealing with Tony he couldn\u2019t help but vent about this reckless Avengers recruit. Once the elevator comes to a halt, you follow Steve and Nat out the elevator and down the flight of steps to what you can only assume to be the lab. The entrance had a window and a glass door, allowing you to see Tony pointing at machines that then promptly perform tasks. As you watch him work, Steve types in a code that open the door, letting you and Nat enter first then closely following suit. He coughs subtly to get Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cAh, Star Spangled Spandex. Who do we have here?\u201d Tony meets eyes with you and gives you a snide grin. His eyes seem to roam down your body for a moment before making eye contact again. </p><p>\u201cThis is Y/N. She\u2019s the new intern.\u201d Steve rolls his eyes then places his hand on your shoulder, shaking you a bit.</p><p>\u201cFury has good taste.\u201d Tony now blatantly leans back slightly and looking you up and down again, bring in his bottom lip slightly while smiling. Typically this behavior would have ticked you off, and sure there was a part of you right now that wanted to smack that smug grin right off his face, but the main part of you enjoyed the fact that this genius billionaire fuckboy that your Uncle despises was attracted to you. \u201cI remember when he brought me you, Natalie\u2026\u201d He stands up straight again and tilts his head toward Natasha. You look between the two as you question for a moment whether Nat\u2019s name is Natasha or Natalie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not always an ass. Sometimes he\u2019s asleep.\u201d Steve comments, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cTony, Y/N is Fury\u2019s niece.\u201d Nat says with an even more smug grin. Tony looks back at you, shock in his eyes as a large sinister smirk grew on his face.</p><p>\"Hmm\u2026 Well, welcome to the team. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy every moment.\u201d He sticks out his hand which you lightly grab and shake. The firmness of your grasp would typically be unacceptable, but somehow it seemed fitting. You give Tony a small smile, observing his peppered facial hair and kind eyes. Your breath hitches for a moment and your heartbeat speeds up when he flashes a larger smile at you.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have a bit more to see so we should get going.\u201d Steve says then turns to leave, Nat following his motions. You begin to follow but stop and turn your head back to Tony.</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice to meet you, Mr. Stark.\u201d You give him a sweet grin. If you were able to read his mind you would\u2019ve known the shock that he felt when he heard you speak for what he realized to be the first time. The way your voice moved to his ears and how its naturally sultry sound did something to him that he wasn\u2019t used to.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, too. And please, call me Tony.\u201d He responds, crossing his arms by placing one arm over the other across his body instead of through each other.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Tony.\u201d You nod and follow behind Nat.</p><p>_____</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since you started your internship and already the work was piling up. Along with the occasional coffee and lunch runs, your main work has been to look over mission briefings and taking and analyzing data from meetings, so you\u2019ve already gotten accustomed to staying late at the compound. So much so that you have a couple of comfy shirts and pants tucked away in Nat\u2019s dresser. So there you were, cuddled up on the couch in the open living room/kitchen area underneath the fluffy blanket that you secretly kept in Steve\u2019s room, thumbing through pages of data three hours past the time you were supposed to go home for the second time this week. You were so engrossed in your work that you didn\u2019t hear someone enter the kitchen and open the fridge, but you did jump when you heard the fridge close. You turn to your left to see Tony smirking at you with a large pizza box on the counter.</p><p>\u201cWorking late again?\u201d He opens the box and takes out a slice. \u201cPizza?\u201d He lift his slice towards you.</p><p>\u201cYes and\u2026 sure.\u201d You close the file that you had and put it on the coffee table, then move a braid that didn\u2019t make it in your quick bun behind your ear. You stand, still wrapped in your blanket, and head to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou know, there is such thing as working too hard. And I think your five steps past that. \u201d Tony says as you grab a plate. He places a slice on it then turns to the microwave to take his piece out, turning back to you to grab your plate and place it in the microwave.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. But it just feels natural, like I\u2019m supposed to do all of this.\u201d The microwave beeps and you take out your piece, closing the door with your head. You walk over to the fridge and grab the ranch, pouring some on your plate then putting it back. \u201cWith my uncle as the executive head of S.H.I.E.L.D, it feels like everyone expects me to be great and it gets to me. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been my entire life, trying to hard to live up to the expectations that people set for me, sometimes burning myself out\u2026\u201d You shake your head and dip your pizza in ranch then take a bite.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you doing all of this?\u201d Tony motions around you then around the couch. He picks up his pizza and takes a bite, lifting an eyebrow in anticipation for your answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working my way up. I want to make my uncle proud. Trust me, Imma be runnin this place in no time.\u201d You smirk and do an exaggerated head flip, making Tony laugh and soon after you join him.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I better stay in your good graces if your gonna be my boss one day.\u201d Tony leans on the counter and grins at you. As you look into his eyes you realize that they\u2019re the reason you didn\u2019t smack him into last week down in his lab. No matter how he acted, his eyes gave his real emotions away everytime. The way he looked at you was filled with such admiration, such wonder for how someone as wonderful as you could stroll into his life. He may act like an ass but you could tell through the way he looked at you that he would do anything for you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever fall from my good graces.\u201d You copy his position and lean against the counter, letting a small smile grow on your face.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d He asks, taking a step toward you and stooping his head slightly to compensate for the two inches he has on you.</p><p>\u201cBecause I like you, Tony. You\u2019re a likeable man. It\u2019s hard not to like you.\u201d You shrug and smile at him. He takes another step toward you and your chest raises as an involuntary response to his movements.</p><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026 I don\u2019t think your uncle would agree.\u201d Tony wraps his arm around you and pulls you flush against him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I care.\u201d As you finish your remark, Tony brings his face towards your and you bring your face towards his in response.You raise your hands to his chest as your lips finally connect with his and begin to move in time. It started off with just your lips fighting for dominance but once the time was right Tony slips in his tongue and that fight begins. You wrap your arms around his neck as one of your hands start to run up his black and grey peppered hair. The blanket that was previously hanging on your shoulders was now on the the floor as Tony\u2019s hands roamed slowly up and down your back, every once in a while touching your butt and giving it a small squeeze, making you smile into the kiss. Eventually you both have a need to take a breath and pull away, heaving deeply for a moment then both airily laughing. Tony looks over your face for a moment longer then, lifting his hand to move your rouge braid back behind your ear.</p><p>\u201cYou should get home. Sleep in your own bed. I heard that such practices are done by all aspiring heads of superhero organizations.\u201d He caresses your cheek then pulls away from you, running his fingers along your sides then fully pulling away to, first, hand you your blanket, then, moving around you, to put the pizza box back into the fridge. The loss of contact saddens your mood slightly but you soon begin to clean too, throwing away the plates that you two used then rolling up your blanket so it wasn\u2019t touching the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I would want to do as the greats did.\u201d You head over to the coffee table and gather up the file that was thrown on top.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride home? I can get Happy to drive you.\u201d You hug your items tight to your chest as Tony struts to you then runs his fingers along your hip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Happy would be very happy with me if you called him at midnight. I can get a cab.\u201d You step closer to him, craving the touch of his lips on yours one last time. You partially get your wish, receiving a quick, parting kiss from Tony.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d He backs his upper body away so he can get a better look at your face.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d You respond then leave his grip. You turn and move toward the elevator, pressing the button then turning your head back to him and grinning.

Along with the occasional coffee and lunch runs, your main work has been to look over mission briefings and taking and analyzing data from meetings, so you&rsquo;ve already gotten accustomed to staying late at the compound. So much so that you have a couple of comfy shirts and pants tucked away in Nat&rsquo;s dresser. So there you were, cuddled up on the couch in the open living room/kitchen area underneath the fluffy blanket that you secretly kept in Steve&rsquo;s room, thumbing through pages of data three hours past the time you were supposed to go home for the second time this week. You were so engrossed in your work that you didn&rsquo;t hear someone enter the kitchen and open the fridge, but you did jump when you heard the fridge close. You turn to your left to see Tony smirking at you with a large pizza box on the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Working late again?&rdquo; He opens the box and takes out a slice. &ldquo;Pizza?&rdquo; He lift his slice towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes and&hellip; sure.&rdquo; You close the file that you had and put it on the coffee table, then move a braid that didn&rsquo;t make it in your quick bun behind your ear. You stand, still wrapped in your blanket, and head to the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, there is such thing as working too hard. And I think your five steps past that. &rdquo; Tony says as you grab a plate. He places a slice on it then turns to the microwave to take his piece out, turning back to you to grab your plate and place it in the microwave.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. But it just feels natural, like I&rsquo;m supposed to do all of this.&rdquo; The microwave beeps and you take out your piece, closing the door with your head. You walk over to the fridge and grab the ranch, pouring some on your plate then putting it back. &ldquo;With my uncle as the executive head of S.H.I.E.L.D, it feels like everyone expects me to be great and it gets to me. That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve been my entire life, trying to hard to live up to the expectations that people set for me, sometimes burning myself out&hellip;&rdquo; You shake your head and dip your pizza in ranch then take a bite.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you doing all of this?&rdquo; Tony motions around you then around the couch. He picks up his pizza and takes a bite, lifting an eyebrow in anticipation for your answer.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working my way up. I want to make my uncle proud. Trust me, Imma be runnin this place in no time.&rdquo; You smirk and do an exaggerated head flip, making Tony laugh and soon after you join him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I guess I better stay in your good graces if your gonna be my boss one day.&rdquo; Tony leans on the counter and grins at you. As you look into his eyes you realize that they&rsquo;re the reason you didn&rsquo;t smack him into last week down in his lab. No matter how he acted, his eyes gave his real emotions away everytime. The way he looked at you was filled with such admiration, such wonder for how someone as wonderful as you could stroll into his life. He may act like an ass but you could tell through the way he looked at you that he would do anything for you.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll ever fall from my good graces.&rdquo; You copy his position and lean against the counter, letting a small smile grow on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;And why is that?&rdquo; He asks, taking a step toward you and stooping his head slightly to compensate for the two inches he has on you.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I like you, Tony. You&rsquo;re a likeable man. It&rsquo;s hard not to like you.&rdquo; You shrug and smile at him. He takes another step toward you and your chest raises as an involuntary response to his movements.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think your uncle would agree.&rdquo; Tony wraps his arm around you and pulls you flush against him.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I care.&rdquo; As you finish your remark, Tony brings his face towards your and you bring your face towards his in response.You raise your hands to his chest as your lips finally connect with his and begin to move in time. It started off with just your lips fighting for dominance but once the time was right Tony slips in his tongue and that fight begins. You wrap your arms around his neck as one of your hands start to run up his black and grey peppered hair. The blanket that was previously hanging on your shoulders was now on the the floor as Tony&rsquo;s hands roamed slowly up and down your back, every once in a while touching your butt and giving it a small squeeze, making you smile into the kiss. Eventually you both have a need to take a breath and pull away, heaving deeply for a moment then both airily laughing. Tony looks over your face for a moment longer then, lifting his hand to move your rouge braid back behind your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;You should get home. Sleep in your own bed. I heard that such practices are done by all aspiring heads of superhero organizations.&rdquo; He caresses your cheek then pulls away from you, running his fingers along your sides then fully pulling away to, first, hand you your blanket, then, moving around you, to put the pizza box back into the fridge. The loss of contact saddens your mood slightly but you soon begin to clean too, throwing away the plates that you two used then rolling up your blanket so it wasn&rsquo;t touching the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I guess I would want to do as the greats did.&rdquo; You head over to the coffee table and gather up the file that was thrown on top.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you need a ride home? I can get Happy to drive you.&rdquo; You hug your items tight to your chest as Tony struts to you then runs his fingers along your hip.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Happy would be very happy with me if you called him at midnight. I can get a cab.&rdquo; You step closer to him, craving the touch of his lips on yours one last time. You partially get your wish, receiving a quick, parting kiss from Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;See you tomorrow.&rdquo; He backs his upper body away so he can get a better look at your face.</p><p>&ldquo;See you tomorrow.&rdquo; You respond then leave his grip. You turn and move toward the elevator, pressing the button then turning your head back to him and grinning. The elevator beeps and you walk in, waving at Tony as the door closes.</p><p><a href=\"https://non-stop-imagines.tumblr.com/post/185257658676/heres-part-1-pairing-tony-stark-x\">Part 2</a></p></p>",

        "title": "The Origin Story",
        "body": "<p>(an AU short story about what I think Peter telling Tony his origin story would be like)</p><p><b></b></p><p>Tony woke up in a cold sweat. He saw some light coming out from the crack in the bedroom door and realized someone was awake. Trying not to wake Pepper, who came to the Compound to manage the property for the weekend, Tony slowly slid out from the sheets and tiptoed to the door. Quietly, he turned the knob and opened the door slightly. He breathed a sigh of relief. It was just Peter, sitting on the living room couch, eating Pop Tarts from the large crate they had stored in the kitchen, which sat next to him. He then realized that something wasn\u2019t right, and quietly snuck up on him. Peter swiftly turned around and grabbed both of Tony\u2019s arms, but then let them go, realizing it wasn\u2019t dangerous. Tony knew that wouldn&rsquo;t work because Peter\u2019s heightened senses allowed him to sense oncoming threats or scares. He softly chuckled. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d He plopped down on the couch next to him, and rummaged through the Pop Tart crate, finally finding a frosted strawberry pack. He ripped it open and offered one to Peter. \u201cNo thanks, Mr. Stark. I\u2019m not in the mood for strawberry,\u201d he said. Peter miserably took a large bite of the chocolate fudge one he was holding. He sighed and said, \u201cSorry about your Pop Tart supply. I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain my metabolism, and I skipped dinner.\u201d Tony realized that Peter had been crying, evidenced by his red eyes and a small pile of tissues he was trying to conceal underneath the mound of Pop Tart wrappers. He rubbed his back and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Looks like you\u2019re stress-eating, and trust me, I know what that looks like. So, tell me, why are you mowing through my Pop Tart crate?\u201d Peter slouched and looked at the crumbs on his hands. \u201cYesterday was Uncle Ben\u2019s birthday, and&hellip;I missed it. I always bring a gift for May, but today I was out on my \u2018Stark Internship\u2019, so I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d Tony knew everything about Peter, except for this \u201cUncle Ben\u201d that he kept mentioning. He decided to let down his walls of ego, and ask for once, \u201cWho\u2019s Uncle Ben? You\u2019ve never told me about him.\u201d Peter sat up and eagerly looked at him. He realized that something had sparked in the kid. Peter took a deep breath and said, \u201cUncle Ben was&hellip;well&hellip;my uncle, as well as May\u2019s husband. When my parents died, they took care of me. I was specifically close to him because he raised me to be the person that I am today, with good morals and life lessons that made me more mature. When I first got my powers, I decided to try them out in a wrestling ring. I won the match, but that same night, my uncle was shot&hellip;by a rogue robber.\u201d Peter started to tear up. Tony realized that he needed to console him, be the father figure in this situation. He pulled Peter closer to his chest, and he comfortably snuggled. He continued, \u201cThat day was when I needed to realize that my powers were meant to be used for good and that my uncle needed to be avenged. So, after a long time of investigating, I caught the robber that killed my uncle. I decided to follow one of my uncle\u2019s best lessons: \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019 That was the day that I took up the mantle of Spider-Man. That is my origin story. Since his death, May and I celebrate his birthday every year to remember him. So, I got really emotional when I missed the celebration.\u201d Tony felt horrible that this high schooler has gone through so much at such a young age. \u201cY\u2019know, kid, I was in university when my parents died. I didn\u2019t love them enough to say goodbye to them before they left for the last time. I had no one else, so my butler and my selection of nannies took care of me. You, on the other hand, lost so much at such a young age. You\u2019re just a kid. I know how it feels to not properly grieve, but it\u2019s okay. You loved him enough to remember him, fight for him, cry for him. So you can rest knowing that you\u2019ll always celebrate ol\u2019 Uncle Ben.\u201d Peter wiped the dripping tears from his face and blew into a tissue. For the first time in 20 minutes, he grinned at Tony and suddenly lurched close for a tight hug. He was surprised, but then put his arms around Peter and rubbed his back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid. I know.\u201d Peter let go after a few minutes and stood up from the couch. \u201cThanks, Mr. Stark. That really helped.\u201d He then hastily gathered all the wrappers and the tissues and hurried over to the trash can. Tony whispered, \u201cFriday, what\u2019s the time right now?\u201d Friday whispered back through his smartwatch, \u201cIt\u2019s 4:45 a.m. right now, with the weather at 28 degrees, cloudy.\u201d Tony turned around and saw Peter trying to push all the snack crates back in without messing them up. He then got up and looked back at him, questioning, \u201cMr. Stark? What\u2019s wrong? Did I do something?\u201d Tony faked a disapproving look and replied, \u201cWow, staying up \u2018till almost 5 a.m.? Save it for your finals. You\u2019ll need it then. Now go get some rest. The \u2018internship\u2019 isn\u2019t over yet!\u201d Peter chuckled and \u201cwalked\u201d back to his room by climbing on the ceiling. Tony thought it was kinda creepy without the suit, but he never pointed it out. He then realized that Pepper would panic if he wasn\u2019t next to her, so he snuck back into the bedroom and slipped into the sheets. He stared at the ceiling for a while, but his growing cloud of thoughts was interrupted by a voice. \u201cSo, what did he tell you?\u201d Tony looked around the room, but no one was there. The voice said, \u201cLook to you right.\u201d He looked right and saw Pepper was awake. \u201cWh-why aren\u2019t you asleep? It\u2019s 5 a.m., and work starts at 6,\u201d he said. She replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday tomorrow, so I thought I\u2019d sleep in. Anyways, what did Peter say?\u201d Tony explained everything, in detail. Pepper intently listened, staring at him as he talked. After the explanation, Tony said, \u201cThe kid\u2019s been through a lot, but I didn\u2019t think that it was this serious. He\u2019s lost two father figures, his actual father, and his uncle, who he trusted would be there to raise him.\u201d Pepper sighed. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t lose a third.\u201d She turned over and fell asleep.

            "comment": "<p>(an AU short story about what I think Peter telling Tony his origin story would be like)</p><p><b></b></p><p>Tony woke up in a cold sweat. He saw some light coming out from the crack in the bedroom door and realized someone was awake. Trying not to wake Pepper, who came to the Compound to manage the property for the weekend, Tony slowly slid out from the sheets and tiptoed to the door. Quietly, he turned the knob and opened the door slightly. He breathed a sigh of relief. It was just Peter, sitting on the living room couch, eating Pop Tarts from the large crate they had stored in the kitchen, which sat next to him. He then realized that something wasn\u2019t right, and quietly snuck up on him. Peter swiftly turned around and grabbed both of Tony\u2019s arms, but then let them go, realizing it wasn\u2019t dangerous. Tony knew that wouldn\u2019t work because Peter\u2019s heightened senses allowed him to sense oncoming threats or scares. He softly chuckled. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d He plopped down on the couch next to him, and rummaged through the Pop Tart crate, finally finding a frosted strawberry pack. He ripped it open and offered one to Peter. \u201cNo thanks, Mr. Stark. I\u2019m not in the mood for strawberry,\u201d he said. Peter miserably took a large bite of the chocolate fudge one he was holding. He sighed and said, \u201cSorry about your Pop Tart supply. I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain my metabolism, and I skipped dinner.\u201d Tony realized that Peter had been crying, evidenced by his red eyes and a small pile of tissues he was trying to conceal underneath the mound of Pop Tart wrappers. He rubbed his back and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Looks like you\u2019re stress-eating, and trust me, I know what that looks like. So, tell me, why are you mowing through my Pop Tart crate?\u201d Peter slouched and looked at the crumbs on his hands. \u201cYesterday was Uncle Ben\u2019s birthday, and\u2026I missed it. I always bring a gift for May, but today I was out on my \u2018Stark Internship\u2019, so I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d Tony knew everything about Peter, except for this \u201cUncle Ben\u201d that he kept mentioning. He decided to let down his walls of ego, and ask for once, \u201cWho\u2019s Uncle Ben? You\u2019ve never told me about him.\u201d Peter sat up and eagerly looked at him. He realized that something had sparked in the kid. Peter took a deep breath and said, \u201cUncle Ben was\u2026well\u2026my uncle, as well as May\u2019s husband. When my parents died, they took care of me. I was specifically close to him because he raised me to be the person that I am today, with good morals and life lessons that made me more mature.

So you can rest knowing that you&rsquo;ll always celebrate ol&rsquo; Uncle Ben.&rdquo; Peter wiped the dripping tears from his face and blew into a tissue. For the first time in 20 minutes, he grinned at Tony and suddenly lurched close for a tight hug. He was surprised, but then put his arms around Peter and rubbed his back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, kid. I know.&rdquo; Peter let go after a few minutes and stood up from the couch. &ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Stark. That really helped.&rdquo; He then hastily gathered all the wrappers and the tissues and hurried over to the trash can. Tony whispered, &ldquo;Friday, what&rsquo;s the time right now?&rdquo; Friday whispered back through his smartwatch, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 4:45 a.m. right now, with the weather at 28 degrees, cloudy.&rdquo; Tony turned around and saw Peter trying to push all the snack crates back in without messing them up. He then got up and looked back at him, questioning, &ldquo;Mr. Stark? What&rsquo;s wrong? Did I do something?&rdquo; Tony faked a disapproving look and replied, &ldquo;Wow, staying up &lsquo;till almost 5 a.m.? Save it for your finals. You&rsquo;ll need it then. Now go get some rest. The &lsquo;internship&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t over yet!&rdquo; Peter chuckled and &ldquo;walked&rdquo; back to his room by climbing on the ceiling. Tony thought it was kinda creepy without the suit, but he never pointed it out. He then realized that Pepper would panic if he wasn&rsquo;t next to her, so he snuck back into the bedroom and slipped into the sheets. He stared at the ceiling for a while, but his growing cloud of thoughts was interrupted by a voice. &ldquo;So, what did he tell you?&rdquo; Tony looked around the room, but no one was there. The voice said, &ldquo;Look to you right.&rdquo; He looked right and saw Pepper was awake. &ldquo;Wh-why aren&rsquo;t you asleep? It&rsquo;s 5 a.m., and work starts at 6,&rdquo; he said. She replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Saturday tomorrow, so I thought I&rsquo;d sleep in. Anyways, what did Peter say?&rdquo; Tony explained everything, in detail. Pepper intently listened, staring at him as he talked. After the explanation, Tony said, &ldquo;The kid&rsquo;s been through a lot, but I didn&rsquo;t think that it was this serious. He&rsquo;s lost two father figures, his actual father, and his uncle, who he trusted would be there to raise him.&rdquo; Pepper sighed. &ldquo;Make sure he doesn&rsquo;t lose a third.&rdquo; She turned over and fell asleep. Tony thought about that for a moment and settled in, sleeping contently. He now had another reason to wake up in the morning, another responsibility&hellip;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i></p><p><i><b>The End</b></i></p><p>(it may be cringe, so sorry if it is, but I really like to write stories and thought that this situation was perfect to tell)</p>",
