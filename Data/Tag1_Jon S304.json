        "body": "<p>Yesterday HBO put up a small video about the upcoming series and new seasons of various other series on their youtube channel.\u00a0</p><p>After 70 seconds of a 100-second video, we see Jon Snow at Winterfell. At the 71st second, we see Sansa hugging Jon and at the 72nd, we see Sansa giving an\u00a0\u2018aggressive death-stare\u2019, in my opinion, to whoever it is standing some distance behind Jon.\u00a0</p><p>That stare has made me curious.\u00a0</p><p>That hug has made me curious.</p><p>Today I\u2019m going to tell you my theory behind that stare that has quickly taken the social media by a storm.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Now I\u2019ve a couple of theories, while one is pretty conservative, the other might seem radical to some.</p><p>Before going any further, I must tell you that one part of my <i>theories</i> will be the same. It\u2019s this- Sansa is staring at Dany and Bran and Sam will tell Sansa about Jon\u2019s true lineage before Jon arrives at Winterfell.</p><h2><b><i>1. Long Live the King!</i></b></h2><p>My first theory goes like this- Sansa will come to know about Jon\u2019s true parentage and how he\u2019s her cousin, Aunt Lyanna\u2019s and Rhaegar Targaryen\u2019s son, which makes him the true heir to the Iron Throne.\u00a0<b><i>An opposition to Dany\u2019s claim!</i></b></p><p>Let\u2019s think about what the North, and especially Sansa must think of the Targaryens- conquerers, dangerous, dragon-riders, not trustworthy, unkind, MAD! and KILLERS! We also know that the Northerners weren&rsquo;t really supportive of Jon&rsquo;s decision to go to Dragonstone.</p><p>Sansa, like everyone else, knows about what the Mad King was saying before he died,\u00a0<b><i>\u201cBurn them all!\u201d</i></b> and while different people have different theories about\u00a0<b>\u2018all\u2019,</b> most of Westeros, like the Kingslayer Jamie Lannister, believes he was referring to the normal people. I also believe that Sansa and the North must know about Randall Tarly\u2019s and his son Dickon\u2019s execution. Execution by Dragonfire. Executed by Dany.</p><p>I believe that Sansa must think of them as people who,</p><ol><li>do anything they want to do; (because, well, dragons) and</li>\n <li>kill anyone who stands in their way i.e The Starks before and the Tarlys now.</li>\n</ol><p>According to my first theory, once Sansa will realise\u00a0who Jon really is, she will be happy. I mean, why not? Her cousin may become the King when the dust settles. But, given the past and recent history of the Targaryens, she will also be concerned about Jon\u2019s well being. \u2018Who\u2019s to say Dany won\u2019t kill him off to get the throne she\u2019s always wanted?\u2019 is what she may think.</p><p>Sansa has already said that she considers Jon a Stark, once she realises that he is, in fact, a half-Stark, her affection for him can only grow, just like her concerns for him.\u00a0</p><p>So my first theory gives the conclusion that that stare, is a look a sister will most likely give to someone who might want to kill her brother.\u00a0</p><h2><b><i>2. Ice and Fire?</i></b></h2><p>For this theory, we have to go back to when we first heard about the original script and story by GRRM. In the original story, there was supposed to be a love-triangle between Jon, Tyrion and Arya. It didn\u2019t happen on the show. I don\u2019t think Arya and Tyrion have ever even had any conversations on the show, let alone love.</p><p>But Sansa has had conversations with Tyrion. Sansa was even married to Tyrion. And Tyrion liked and respected Sansa for the little girl she was at the time.\u00a0</p><p>Are you paying attention? Stay with me, this will get more interesting as you read ahead.</p><p>My question is, what if D&amp;D made a slight change to the original script? What if they replaced Arya with Sansa.</p><p>Ask yourself, what has Sansa always wanted? <b><i>To rule.</i></b></p><p>Can she ever rule the seven kingdoms under the present circumstances? Can she become queen?</p><p>Under normal circumstances, probably not.</p><p>I think most of Westeros believes that either Cersei will continue to rule or Dany or Jon will take the iron throne in the future once the Great War ends. Sansa has an outside shot if everyone else dies.</p><p>But at that moment, the moment when she hugged Jon, something that has only happened once before and under completely different circumstances, she may have something different in mind.\u00a0</p><p>Think about it this, what reason could Sansa have to initiate a hug? She was kept in the dark about the whole &lsquo;knee-bending&rsquo; thing and she didn&rsquo;t like the fact that she wasn&rsquo;t consulted on it. You could say that it was just out of some sibling-love or maybe 'half&rsquo;-sibling.</p><p>But can there be another reason?</p><p>What if when Sam and Bran tell her about Jon, she sees an opportunity? An opportunity to be Queen. Sansa, along with her mother, was the only Stark who cared nothing for Jon back in S1. She even apologised to him for her behaviour when they met in S6 back at Castle Black.\u00a0</p><p>So we can admit that Sansa\u2019s and Jon\u2019s brother-sister relationship was and has never been the same as Jon\u2019s and Arya\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>My theory is when Sansa will realise the Jon is a Targaryen, she would try and woo him afterwards. Now I\u2019m not sure if cousin-cousin marriage is accepted in Westeros but it sure won\u2019t be as radical and controversial as the Cersei-Jamie relationship.\u00a0</p><p>A Stark and a Targaryen! Oh, we have seen this before! That\u2019s how it started and that is how it may end. We think of Jon as Ice and Dany as Fire but now we know that Jon is a Targaryen, so shouldn\u2019t he be Fire too?\u00a0What if Jon is Fire and Sansa is Ice?</p><p>Also, remember all the parallels being drawn between Sansa and Cersei? Their personalities among other things? She admits to Jon in S7 that she has learned a lot from Cersei.\u00a0Jon even thinks that Sansa admires her.</p><p>What if she is like her in more than some ways?</p><p>Do you remember whom Cersei wanted to marry? <b><i>Rheagar Targaryen.</i></b></p><p>Who is Jon? <b><i>Rhaegar\u2019s son.</i></b></p><p>There are also speculations about Dany\u2019s death and how she will fulfil the Nissa Nissa prophesy. If Dany dies and Cersei dies, Jon will become King, one way or the other. But what I want to point out is this, the last time the throne changed hands as a result of a war was when Robert Baratheon became King of the Seven Kingdoms- and he married a woman whom he didn\u2019t love because the woman he did love had already died. Robert, just like Jon was a warrior, and some believe he didn\u2019t even want to be King. His rebellion was for revenge and not the Throne. Well, Jon doesn\u2019t want to be King. And his war is for survival and not the Throne. But could we see history repeat itself? And if Jon does become King, he would have to marry someone. Well, who would be left? Dany? Dead. Cersei? Probably dead. Yara? Probably dead too. Merra? I can\u2019t see it happening. Margery? Dead. The Sand Snakes? Can\u2019t see that happening too.\u00a0</p><p>Given Sansa survives, she will be the best choice.\u00a0</p><p>So, my second theory concludes that that look, a sudden and aggressive look, while hugging a\u00a0\u2018loved\u2019 one at the same time, was a look of jealousy and competitiveness.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa will know that Dany, the beautiful Dany, may be the only obstacle between her and the throne room.\u00a0</p><p>Littlefinger did tell Sansa about Dany&rsquo;s beauty and how Jon may want to form an alliance by marrying her. Sansa will surely remember that.</p><p>P.S- This all may seem ridiculous but I just wanted some thoughts as I couldn&rsquo;t get that scene out of my head.</p>",

Ice and Fire?</i></b></h2><p>For this theory, we have to go back to when we first heard about the original script and story by GRRM. In the original story, there was supposed to be a love-triangle between Jon, Tyrion and Arya. It didn\u2019t happen on the show. I don\u2019t think Arya and Tyrion have ever even had any conversations on the show, let alone love.</p><p>But Sansa has had conversations with Tyrion. Sansa was even married to Tyrion. And Tyrion liked and respected Sansa for the little girl she was at the time.\u00a0</p><p>Are you paying attention? Stay with me, this will get more interesting as you read ahead.</p><p>My question is, what if D&amp;D made a slight change to the original script? What if they replaced Arya with Sansa.</p><p>Ask yourself, what has Sansa always wanted? <b><i>To rule.</i></b></p><p>Can she ever rule the seven kingdoms under the present circumstances? Can she become queen?</p><p>Under normal circumstances, probably not.</p><p>I think most of Westeros believes that either Cersei will continue to rule or Dany or Jon will take the iron throne in the future once the Great War ends. Sansa has an outside shot if everyone else dies.</p><p>But at that moment, the moment when she hugged Jon, something that has only happened once before and under completely different circumstances, she may have something different in mind.\u00a0</p><p>Think about it this, what reason could Sansa have to initiate a hug? She was kept in the dark about the whole \u2018knee-bending\u2019 thing and she didn\u2019t like the fact that she wasn\u2019t consulted on it. You could say that it was just out of some sibling-love or maybe 'half\u2019-sibling.</p><p>But can there be another reason?</p><p>What if when Sam and Bran tell her about Jon, she sees an opportunity? An opportunity to be Queen. Sansa, along with her mother, was the only Stark who cared nothing for Jon back in S1. She even apologised to him for her behaviour when they met in S6 back at Castle Black.\u00a0</p><p>So we can admit that Sansa\u2019s and Jon\u2019s brother-sister relationship was and has never been the same as Jon\u2019s and Arya\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>My theory is when Sansa will realise the Jon is a Targaryen, she would try and woo him afterwards. Now I\u2019m not sure if cousin-cousin marriage is accepted in Westeros but it sure won\u2019t be as radical and controversial as the Cersei-Jamie relationship.\u00a0</p><p>A Stark and a Targaryen! Oh, we have seen this before! That\u2019s how it started and that is how it may end. We think of Jon as Ice and Dany as Fire but now we know that Jon is a Targaryen, so shouldn\u2019t he be Fire too?\u00a0What if Jon is Fire and Sansa is Ice?</p><p>Also, remember all the parallels being drawn between Sansa and Cersei? Their personalities among other things? She admits to Jon in S7 that she has learned a lot from Cersei.\u00a0Jon even thinks that Sansa admires her.</p><p>What if she is like her in more than some ways?</p><p>Do you remember whom Cersei wanted to marry? <b><i>Rheagar Targaryen.</i></b></p><p>Who is Jon? <b><i>Rhaegar\u2019s son.</i></b></p><p>There are also speculations about Dany\u2019s death and how she will fulfil the Nissa Nissa prophesy. If Dany dies and Cersei dies, Jon will become King, one way or the other. But what I want to point out is this, the last time the throne changed hands as a result of a war was when Robert Baratheon became King of the Seven Kingdoms- and he married a woman whom he didn\u2019t love because the woman he did love had already died. Robert, just like Jon was a warrior, and some believe he didn\u2019t even want to be King. His rebellion was for revenge and not the Throne. Well, Jon doesn\u2019t want to be King. And his war is for survival and not the Throne. But could we see history repeat itself? And if Jon does become King, he would have to marry someone. Well, who would be left? Dany? Dead. Cersei? Probably dead. Yara? Probably dead too. Merra? I can\u2019t see it happening. Margery? Dead. The Sand Snakes? Can\u2019t see that happening too.\u00a0</p><p>Given Sansa survives, she will be the best choice.\u00a0</p><p>So, my second theory concludes that that look, a sudden and aggressive look, while hugging a\u00a0\u2018loved\u2019 one at the same time, was a look of jealousy and competitiveness.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa will know that Dany, the beautiful Dany, may be the only obstacle between her and the throne room.\u00a0</p><p>Littlefinger did tell Sansa about Dany\u2019s beauty and how Jon may want to form an alliance by marrying her. Sansa will surely remember that.</p><p>P.S- This all may seem ridiculous but I just wanted some thoughts as I couldn\u2019t get that scene out of my head.</p>",

At the 71st second, we see Sansa hugging Jon and at the 72nd, we see Sansa giving an\u00a0\u2018aggressive death-stare\u2019, in my opinion, to whoever it is standing some distance behind Jon.\u00a0</p><p>That stare has made me curious.\u00a0</p><p>That hug has made me curious.</p><p>Today I\u2019m going to tell you my theory behind that stare that has quickly taken the social media by a storm.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Now I\u2019ve a couple of theories, while one is pretty conservative, the other might seem radical to some.</p><p>Before going any further, I must tell you that one part of my <i>theories</i> will be the same. It\u2019s this- Sansa is staring at Dany and Bran and Sam will tell Sansa about Jon\u2019s true lineage before Jon arrives at Winterfell.</p><h2><b><i>1. Long Live the King!</i></b></h2><p>My first theory goes like this- Sansa will come to know about Jon\u2019s true parentage and how he\u2019s her cousin, Aunt Lyanna\u2019s and Rhaegar Targaryen\u2019s son, which makes him the true heir to the Iron Throne.\u00a0<b><i>An opposition to Dany\u2019s claim!</i></b></p><p>Let\u2019s think about what the North, and especially Sansa must think of the Targaryens- conquerers, dangerous, dragon-riders, not trustworthy, unkind, MAD! and KILLERS! We also know that the Northerners weren\u2019t really supportive of Jon\u2019s decision to go to Dragonstone.</p><p>Sansa, like everyone else, knows about what the Mad King was saying before he died,\u00a0<b><i>\u201cBurn them all!\u201d</i></b> and while different people have different theories about\u00a0<b>\u2018all\u2019,</b> most of Westeros, like the Kingslayer Jamie Lannister, believes he was referring to the normal people. I also believe that Sansa and the North must know about Randall Tarly\u2019s and his son Dickon\u2019s execution. Execution by Dragonfire. Executed by Dany.</p><p>I believe that Sansa must think of them as people who,</p><ol><li>do anything they want to do; (because, well, dragons) and</li>\n <li>kill anyone who stands in their way i.e The Starks before and the Tarlys now.</li>\n</ol><p>According to my first theory, once Sansa will realise\u00a0who Jon really is, she will be happy.

He sighed and laid down on the bed beside her, pulling her towards him so she could lean on his chest.</p><p>Before he started the story, he heard Daenerys over the baby monitor &ldquo;Rhaenys you should be asleep already.&quot;she chided their daughter for being up later than they had expected.</p><p>&quot;But mommy, daddy was going to read me a story&hellip;&rdquo; she pouted even though her mother was not in the room with her.</p><p>&ldquo;Only one. And then you will go to sleep. Daddy has to be up early for work.&rdquo; Dany said and then left them to their story.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay daddy, you can begin.&rdquo; She said making herself comfortable on Jon&rsquo;s chest, pulling her doll closer to her, cuddled up under his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I met your mom when I stole her taxi.&rdquo; Jon started </p><p>*<i><b>Flashback</b></i>*</p><p><i>Jon walked out of the shower, tying the towel around his waist, as he walked to the basin where a mirror hung over it. Taking his shaving material out, he decided to trim his beard just a little as his father&rsquo;s wife complained about his being homeless looking to their clients, which his father didn&rsquo;t agree with, Ned Stark had said that Jon looked more matured just like his older brother by two years Robb.</i></p><p><i>This is why he decided to shave, tonight was a big night for Robb and his girlfriend Maergery. They had a big announcement to make, which Jon guessed that either Robb had asked her to marry him or they were expecting. Hopefully they engaged if the other thing happened.</i></p><p><i>Jon has been single for a year now, his family kept trying to set him up, but he didn&rsquo;t want to end up in another failed relationship.</i></p><p><i>Beard trimmed, he walked back into his bedroom to the closet and checked out what to wear. He took out a black pollar neck jersey long sleeve top, with black jeans. He decided to wear his briefs, knowing full well that he would end up at home and alone, no need to wear his fancy boxers.</i></p><p><i>Jon dried his hair and himself and dressed as quickly as he could, when he realised that his phone was on silent and probably had lots of messages. </i></p><p>The first one was from Arya.</p><p><b>Jon, Get your ass here now.</b></p><p><b>Robb is freaking out.</b></p><p>XA</p><p>The second one was from Sansa who rarely texted him, she usually emailed him, her being a very busy fashion designer.</p><p><b>Brother.

Get your butt here.</b></p><p><b>Now!!!!</b></p><p>He shook his head as he read the texts, Robb had tried calling him and was probably just nervous and needed Jon there for moral support against his mother who would see fault in everything.</p><p>Jon tied his hair into a bun and grabbed his wallet and coat from the bed and walked downstairs to get his dog some water and food.</p><p>&ldquo;Ghost, buddy. You better behave okay. Sam and Gilly will be here soon. So you better not try your luck. No laying on the couch.&rdquo; Jon said reprimanding his dog who just sat on his haunches glaring at him michieviously.</p><p>Finally Sam and his wife Gilly arrived, Jon didn&rsquo;t have time for small talk he had to rush to get to the restaurant as his family kept blowing up his phone to notify him that he needed to hurry up or they would be eating without him.</p><p>*end of flashback.*</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy, this is getting boring, skip to the good parts, when do you meet mommy.&rdquo; Rhaenys asked as she played with the buttons of his shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;In a few minutes. Hold your horses.&rdquo; Jon huffed, preparing to continue the story.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have horses daddy.&rdquo; She said looking around the room.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a figure of speech honey. Let&rsquo;s continue huh.&rdquo; He said. She nodded her head agreeing with him.</p><p><b><i>*Start of flashback*</i></b></p><p>Jon rushed out of his apartment and took the elevator downstairs, he waited as he arrived on ground floor and rushed outside to get a cab, as a cab pulled up, he jumped into the car closing the door fast.</p><p>He saw a silver haired women standing by the car, in a black strappy dress and a red coat.</p><p>&ldquo;Heeeeeeey!&rdquo; She shreaked hitting the window. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my cab you moron. Get out now.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon refused to get out. He looked at the driver and said &ldquo;I will add an extra 50 dollars to the bill if you take me to The Reach.&rdquo; </p><p>The cab driver looked at the women and shrugged. &ldquo;Are you kidding me? I called ahead for this cab. How dare you? It&rsquo;s about to rain.&rdquo; The women said.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry lady. But that tip is going to my kids college tuition. Wait for the next one.&rdquo; The cab driver replied and strapped his seatbelt and drove off, leaving the women standing behind on the curb as it started to rain.</p><p>The cab driver looked in the review mirror at Jon who had just shrugged and said &ldquo; She&rsquo;s probably going out on a date, she can wait for the next one. I am late to a family dinner, my brother who is going to tell the familg that he either proposed to his girlfriend or they expecting or both.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, let me step on it then. Get you there.&rdquo; They arrived in twenty minutes tops as the cab driver drove as if the police were after him. Jon thanked the man and as promised paid him the extra money he said he was going to pay.</p><p>He rushed into the restaurant called The Reach. Maergerys family owned the place, a whole chain of food restaurants. The place had amazing interior and was know for it&rsquo;s famous outdoor vibes epecially in spring time where the roses would bloom and it was the perfect place to bring a date of you wanted to impress.</p><p>Jon walked up to the hostess and said &ldquo;Table for Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>The hostess nodded and handed him a menu and requested for him to follow her to a private dining area where his family awaited him. When he entered through the curtains, his whole family clapped hands even Robb looked up and clapped his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;My brother. You are finally on time.&rdquo; He said as he got up from his seat and hugged Jon patting him on the back. &ldquo;Come inside. Have a beer and food. I&rsquo;m about to tell the family.&rdquo; They walked to the table and Robb handed him a beer. Jon said his hello&rsquo;s to his family members who hasn&rsquo;t seen him in a while. Especially Caitlyn Stark his father&rsquo;s wife who didn&rsquo;t like him and hardly ever talked to him since she was glad he moved far from home.</p><p>&ldquo;Father. Cat. How are you this evening?&rdquo; Jon extended to his father a hug and just a cordial hello to his wife.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine son.&rdquo; When they heard the glass being tapped with the fork he said &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go hear this big news Robb wants to tell us.&rdquo;</p><p>Good evening family and friends. Maergery and I have some big news to share with you.&ldquo; Robb said holding out his hand to his girlfriend &quot;Maerg. Come up here darling.&rdquo; She giggled and handed her glass over to her grandmother who just smiled and winked at Robb.</p><p>&ldquo;So here&rsquo;s the deal. Robb asked and after some much needed persuasion, I said yes.&rdquo; Maergery said and held up her left hand showing off the ring.Everyone was excited for them, cheering and congratulating them gor their upcoming nuptials. Jon smiled and welcomed Maergery to the family, telling her that he would tell her all Robbs stories from when he was a child. He headed out to the bar, to get some more champagne when he ran into a women rushing his way.</p><p>&ldquo;Watch where you going lady!&rdquo; He said </p><p>&ldquo;Me! You walked into me&hellip; I&rsquo;ll have you&hellip;&rdquo; when she looked up she saw Jon and he knew in that instant that she was the women whose cab he had stolen.</p><p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; She shreaked.</p><p>&ldquo;Me.&rdquo; He said sarcastically.</p>",

                "content": "<p><h1>Against All Odds </h1><h2>Chapter Text</h2><p>&ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo; Rhaenys asked as she laid in her bed, while her father checked her bookshelf for a story to read.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Princess?&rdquo; He responded as he returned to her side with &lsquo;The Princess and The Pea&rsquo; story book. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me the story of how you and mommy met.&rdquo; She asked taking the book from his hands placing it on her bed side table. He sighed and laid down on the bed beside her, pulling her towards him so she could lean on his chest.</p><p>Before he started the story, he heard Daenerys over the baby monitor &ldquo;Rhaenys you should be asleep already.\"she chided their daughter for being up later than they had expected.</p><p>\"But mommy, daddy was going to read me a story&hellip;&rdquo; she pouted even though her mother was not in the room with her.</p><p>&ldquo;Only one. And then you will go to sleep. Daddy has to be up early for work.&rdquo; Dany said and then left them to their story.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay daddy, you can begin.&rdquo; She said making herself comfortable on Jon&rsquo;s chest, pulling her doll closer to her, cuddled up under his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I met your mom when I stole her taxi.&rdquo; Jon started </p><p>*<i><b>Flashback</b></i>*</p><p><i>Jon walked out of the shower, tying the towel around his waist, as he walked to the basin where a mirror hung over it. Taking his shaving material out, he decided to trim his beard just a little as his father&rsquo;s wife complained about his being homeless looking to their clients, which his father didn&rsquo;t agree with, Ned Stark had said that Jon looked more matured just like his older brother by two years Robb.</i></p><p><i>This is why he decided to shave, tonight was a big night for Robb and his girlfriend Maergery. They had a big announcement to make, which Jon guessed that either Robb had asked her to marry him or they were expecting. Hopefully they engaged if the other thing happened.</i></p><p><i>Jon has been single for a year now, his family kept trying to set him up, but he didn&rsquo;t want to end up in another failed relationship.</i></p><p><i>Beard trimmed, he walked back into his bedroom to the closet and checked out what to wear. He took out a black pollar neck jersey long sleeve top, with black jeans. He decided to wear his briefs, knowing full well that he would end up at home and alone, no need to wear his fancy boxers.</i></p><p><i>Jon dried his hair and himself and dressed as quickly as he could, when he realised that his phone was on silent and probably had lots of messages. </i></p><p>The first one was from Arya.</p><p><b>Jon, Get your ass here now.</b></p><p><b>Robb is freaking out.</b></p><p>XA</p><p>The second one was from Sansa who rarely texted him, she usually emailed him, her being a very busy fashion designer.</p><p><b>Brother. Hurry up. Robb is turning blue. Hurry!!!!!! </b></p><p><b>Sans</b></p><p>The third one was from his father.</p><p><b>Seriously Jon. Get your butt here.</b></p><p><b>Now!!!!</b></p><p>He shook his head as he read the texts, Robb had tried calling him and was probably just nervous and needed Jon there for moral support against his mother who would see fault in everything.</p><p>Jon tied his hair into a bun and grabbed his wallet and coat from the bed and walked downstairs to get his dog some water and food.</p><p>&ldquo;Ghost, buddy. You better behave okay. Sam and Gilly will be here soon. So you better not try your luck. No laying on the couch.&rdquo; Jon said reprimanding his dog who just sat on his haunches glaring at him michieviously.</p><p>Finally Sam and his wife Gilly arrived, Jon didn&rsquo;t have time for small talk he had to rush to get to the restaurant as his family kept blowing up his phone to notify him that he needed to hurry up or they would be eating without him.</p><p>*end of flashback.*</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy, this is getting boring, skip to the good parts, when do you meet mommy.&rdquo; Rhaenys asked as she played with the buttons of his shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;In a few minutes. Hold your horses.&rdquo; Jon huffed, preparing to continue the story.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have horses daddy.&rdquo; She said looking around the room.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a figure of speech honey. Let&rsquo;s continue huh.&rdquo; He said. She nodded her head agreeing with him.</p><p><b><i>*Start of flashback*</i></b></p><p>Jon rushed out of his apartment and took the elevator downstairs, he waited as he arrived on ground floor and rushed outside to get a cab, as a cab pulled up, he jumped into the car closing the door fast.</p><p>He saw a silver haired women standing by the car, in a black strappy dress and a red coat.</p><p>&ldquo;Heeeeeeey!&rdquo; She shreaked hitting the window. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my cab you moron. Get out now.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon refused to get out. He looked at the driver and said &ldquo;I will add an extra 50 dollars to the bill if you take me to The Reach.&rdquo; </p><p>The cab driver looked at the women and shrugged. &ldquo;Are you kidding me? I called ahead for this cab. How dare you? It&rsquo;s about to rain.&rdquo; The women said.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry lady. But that tip is going to my kids college tuition. Wait for the next one.&rdquo; The cab driver replied and strapped his seatbelt and drove off, leaving the women standing behind on the curb as it started to rain.</p><p>The cab driver looked in the review mirror at Jon who had just shrugged and said &ldquo; She&rsquo;s probably going out on a date, she can wait for the next one. I am late to a family dinner, my brother who is going to tell the familg that he either proposed to his girlfriend or they expecting or both.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, let me step on it then. Get you there.&rdquo; They arrived in twenty minutes tops as the cab driver drove as if the police were after him. Jon thanked the man and as promised paid him the extra money he said he was going to pay.</p><p>He rushed into the restaurant called The Reach. Maergerys family owned the place, a whole chain of food restaurants. The place had amazing interior and was know for it&rsquo;s famous outdoor vibes epecially in spring time where the roses would bloom and it was the perfect place to bring a date of you wanted to impress.</p><p>Jon walked up to the hostess and said &ldquo;Table for Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>The hostess nodded and handed him a menu and requested for him to follow her to a private dining area where his family awaited him. When he entered through the curtains, his whole family clapped hands even Robb looked up and clapped his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;My brother. You are finally on time.&rdquo; He said as he got up from his seat and hugged Jon patting him on the back. &ldquo;Come inside. Have a beer and food. I&rsquo;m about to tell the family.&rdquo; They walked to the table and Robb handed him a beer. Jon said his hello&rsquo;s to his family members who hasn&rsquo;t seen him in a while. Especially Caitlyn Stark his father&rsquo;s wife who didn&rsquo;t like him and hardly ever talked to him since she was glad he moved far from home.</p><p>&ldquo;Father. Cat.
