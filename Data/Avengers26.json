Clint\u2019s scene with his family holy fuck it was so beautiful and so well done and got me so ready for the tone of the film to be dark and real and dealing with loss and denial, and for a while it was going down that path and then we had a weird hour of dumb fortnite jokes crammed in for no reason. BUT Tony coming home and his anger and guilt killed me and Nat\u2019s refusal to move on holy shit so good!\u00a0</p><p>And then they made what I think was a big mistake in killing Thanos immediately. Because the Avengers are all built on hope, and this decimates that hope, this gives them no other options. What I wish had happened was that they couldnt find Thanos and they spend 5 years slowly getting jaded and bitter as they try and try and try to find him, and to fix this and they try THEY TRY SO HARD to make the world better for those left behind in the mean time. I mean all the 5 years later stuff was great, and I think you can have all that stuff still in the movie and Thanos just not be dead yet and they cant find him. Because killing Thanos so early just feels like you devalue all the great work of Inifinity War\u2019s ending? Like if it was that easy to find him and get him do that in the last movie? idk man why not have them spend 5 years losing all hope slowly and then ant man comes back and bang the fire is reignited? That way we skip all the time we had to spend getting the band back together and go straight into time travel world&hellip;.which leads me to MY\u00a0MAIN PROBLEM WITH THE MOVIE WAS THIS FUCKING LONG ASS SECTION OF TIME TRAVEL SHENANIGANS AND STUPID FAT THOR JOKES. I get it, we\u2019re reliving the glory days, we\u2019re remembering all the fun we had with these movies. But i remember those movies just fine on my own and I\u2019m here to see a new one. Idk I feel like they could have done this section faster? And tbh the bits in the past werent even my main problem it was all the preamble to that just took too long?t I just think if youre gonna make a 3 hour long film then that amount of time should be justified and for me it wasnt.\u00a0</p><p>Also Thor was funny as fuck in Ragnarok and INfinity War. He doesnt need a fat suit - he is funny in the writing. The fat jokes were cliche and overdone and I was not here for them.\u00a0<br/></p><p>So yeah most of the time travel set up section was just irritating to me and then I was sitting there being so irritated I couldnt enjoy the gold that was amongst it. Like Nat and Clint on Vormir was exceptional. Tony and Howard was fantastic. Even the stuff in New York 2012 I liked I just wish the lead up had been faster and the pay off a bit better? And also the fact that there were no consequences to their actions in the past was kinda annoying? Like idk it felt like lazy writing a little bit like\u00a0\u201cwe want time travel to save us but dont want to deal with all those pesky rules of time travel so we are going to have Bruce say a line that makes no sense about pasts and presents and pretend that fixes the huge problem that is Nebula shooting her past self\u201d\u00a0</p><p>But then&hellip;.Once we get to the battle HOLY FUCK THIS IS THE MCU\u2019s FINEST HOUR. THE BATTLE WAS EXCEPPPPPTIONAL. And this is why the long ass preamble at the beginning frustrates me so much looking back, because the battle was amazing and I wanted more. Like this is the battle of all battles right now and I wanted it to go longer. Tony\u2019s snap though, and then Tony\u2019s death and funeral was in my opinion some of the finest work done ever in any marvel movie. It was stunning and emotional and amazing. I am a Tony stan and Im just so happy with how he was sent off. BRAVO to this section.\u00a0</p><p>Steve\u2019s ending I was less happy with but mostly because I just felt rushed by it. Give him the same amount of time given to Tony? or alternatively do it more poeticaly and have Bucky and Sam just find the shield and a letter sitting on that bench - and let us see Peggy and Steve dancing? One or the other idk it felt too fast and too\u00a0\u2018fuck we gotta move steve on how do we do that uh uh uh time travel save us one more time!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>BASICALLY I JUST WISH THAT THE MOVIE WAS THE EXACT SAME BUT WITH THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE STONES BEING DESTROYED TAKEN OUT BECAUSE THEN WE GET THE SAME MOVIE BUT WITH ALL THE LONG ASS BEGINNING BIT TAKEN OUT AND MORE TIME LEFT FOR THE BATTLE.\u00a0 Thanos is still alive, realises what they\u2019re doing when the ramifications of their actions in the past fucking alert the time stone or something (its the MCU im sure we can find a very easy way for Thanos to know what theyre doing) and Thanos comes to stop them ruining his new amazing universe. We still get the time travel, we still get the grit and the battle, but now we dont have to run around for close to an hour organising shit that had already been in place but we dismantled for some unknown reason.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>And no fat thor.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>The end.\u00a0</p>",

                "content": "<p>Spoilers below so dont click because you dont wanna be spoiled for this boi&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m really disappointed in some of this movie, and some of this movie I thought was the MCU&rsquo;s finest work and i need to vent so I&rsquo;m writing this thing to get it outta my system.&nbsp;</p><p>THEY OPENED SO STRONG!! Clint&rsquo;s scene with his family holy fuck it was so beautiful and so well done and got me so ready for the tone of the film to be dark and real and dealing with loss and denial, and for a while it was going down that path and then we had a weird hour of dumb fortnite jokes crammed in for no reason. BUT Tony coming home and his anger and guilt killed me and Nat&rsquo;s refusal to move on holy shit so good!&nbsp;</p><p>And then they made what I think was a big mistake in killing Thanos immediately. Because the Avengers are all built on hope, and this decimates that hope, this gives them no other options. What I wish had happened was that they couldnt find Thanos and they spend 5 years slowly getting jaded and bitter as they try and try and try to find him, and to fix this and they try THEY TRY SO HARD to make the world better for those left behind in the mean time. I mean all the 5 years later stuff was great, and I think you can have all that stuff still in the movie and Thanos just not be dead yet and they cant find him. Because killing Thanos so early just feels like you devalue all the great work of Inifinity War&rsquo;s ending? Like if it was that easy to find him and get him do that in the last movie? idk man why not have them spend 5 years losing all hope slowly and then ant man comes back and bang the fire is reignited? That way we skip all the time we had to spend getting the band back together and go straight into time travel world&hellip;.which leads me to MY&nbsp;MAIN PROBLEM WITH THE MOVIE WAS THIS FUCKING LONG ASS SECTION OF TIME TRAVEL SHENANIGANS AND STUPID FAT THOR JOKES. I get it, we&rsquo;re reliving the glory days, we&rsquo;re remembering all the fun we had with these movies. But i remember those movies just fine on my own and I&rsquo;m here to see a new one. Idk I feel like they could have done this section faster? And tbh the bits in the past werent even my main problem it was all the preamble to that just took too long?t I just think if youre gonna make a 3 hour long film then that amount of time should be justified and for me it wasnt.&nbsp;</p><p>Also Thor was funny as fuck in Ragnarok and INfinity War. He doesnt need a fat suit - he is funny in the writing. The fat jokes were cliche and overdone and I was not here for them.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>So yeah most of the time travel set up section was just irritating to me and then I was sitting there being so irritated I couldnt enjoy the gold that was amongst it. Like Nat and Clint on Vormir was exceptional. Tony and Howard was fantastic. Even the stuff in New York 2012 I liked I just wish the lead up had been faster and the pay off a bit better? And also the fact that there were no consequences to their actions in the past was kinda annoying? Like idk it felt like lazy writing a little bit like&nbsp;&ldquo;we want time travel to save us but dont want to deal with all those pesky rules of time travel so we are going to have Bruce say a line that makes no sense about pasts and presents and pretend that fixes the huge problem that is Nebula shooting her past self&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>But then&hellip;.Once we get to the battle HOLY FUCK THIS IS THE MCU&rsquo;s FINEST HOUR. THE BATTLE WAS EXCEPPPPPTIONAL. And this is why the long ass preamble at the beginning frustrates me so much looking back, because the battle was amazing and I wanted more. Like this is the battle of all battles right now and I wanted it to go longer. Tony&rsquo;s snap though, and then Tony&rsquo;s death and funeral was in my opinion some of the finest work done ever in any marvel movie. It was stunning and emotional and amazing. I am a Tony stan and Im just so happy with how he was sent off. BRAVO to this section.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s ending I was less happy with but mostly because I just felt rushed by it.
