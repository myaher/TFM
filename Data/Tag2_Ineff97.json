Miles just smiled.</small></p><p><small>\u201cBecause, my<i> dear </i>Anthony, you\u2019re everyone\u2019s favourite subject. The mysterious Mr. Crowley, with his secret fortune and private Mayfair flat that no one has ever stepped foot in; you\u2019re positively a local fascination.\u201d</small></p><p><small>The look in Miles\u2019 eyes was entirely coquettish; it was no coincidence that he mentioned that no one had ever stepped foot in Crowley\u2019s flat. He was fishing for an invitation, hoping to be the first to break into his secret little world. Unfortunately, no invitation came; instead, Crowley just smirked and asked, \u201cAm I <i>your</i> favourite subject?\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cOnly in the most confidential of company,\u201d Miles hemmed (<i>meaning Agatha</i>).</small></p><p><small>\u201cAnd do you find me fascinating?\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cOh, <i>exceedingly</i>.\u201d</small></p><p><small>Smiling, Miles tossed Crowley a wink as the valet pulled up with the Bentley, allowing the two of them to slide into the car\u2019s warmth and out of London\u2019s late-winter dampness.</small></p><p><small>As they drove, Miles found himself watching from the corner of his eye as Crowley tugged his white gloves off with his teeth before tossing each one in turn into the backseat. Not exactly the most <i>refined</i> way of doing things, but it <i>was </i>the most enrapturing. Delicately plucking his own off one finger at a time, Miles let his gaze properly settle on Crowley when the redhaired gentleman asked, \u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cSorry?\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cYou said you find me exceedingly fascinating,\u201d Crowley clarified, tapping his fingers against the Bentley\u2019s steering wheel as he drove, the gold of his ruby ring clicking against the mahogany as he did so. \u201cI assume that means you\u2019re curious.\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cWell, yes. Obviously,\u201d Miles agreed, his cheeks turning slightly pink as he added, \u201cBut I\u2019m not <i>presumptuous</i>. I know you like having your secrets. What right have I to them?\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cI do like having my secrets&hellip; but maybe I\u2019d also like having a confidant,\u201d Crowley mused, pausing the tapping of his ring to peek over at Miles, his lips quirking upwards at the way the other gentleman\u2019s jaw dropped ever-so-slightly. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re that infamous Mr. Chatterbox, eh? I\u2019m sure I can trust you.\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d Miles breathed, the words coming out rather like a squeak.</small></p><p><small>\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask you again: what would you like to know?\u201d</small></p><blockquote><p><small><i><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18050798/chapters/43038884\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full chapter on AO3</a></b></i></small></p></blockquote>",

He\u2019d made sure to brace\nthe bookshelves when he\u2019d set them up, so they couldn\u2019t fall down one way or\nthe other \u2013 he recalled a library in Venice, in\u2026 What was it, \u201975, maybe \u201977,\nof the 18<sup>th</sup> century? The shelves in <i>that</i> library had really toppled like dominos, and Aziraphale hadn\u2019t\nspoken to him for a decade after that, although it had been funny.<br/></p><p>These shelves were <i>not</i> at risk: they were pinned to the floor with steel braces, with\nribbing running between them and caging them against the ceiling, just in case.\n</p><p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley said again, a little more loudly this time.</p><p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t look up, didn\u2019t so much\nas stir or show a sign of hearing him. He was absolutely <i>engrossed</i> in some thick philosophy text, one Crowley had never read\nhimself and had no desire to.</p><p>\u201cAziraphale,\u201d Crowley said, \u201cI would love\nto draw your attention to the fact that I am wearing nothing but a lace thong.\u201d\nThis was true. It was black, and <i>tight</i>,\nand he had picked it up in town before driving back, had delighted the whole\ndrive in the idea of coming home and getting Aziraphale to take him to bed.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t accounted for Aziraphale being in\none of his <i>moods</i>, where he focused so\nentirely on a book the world could explode around him, and didn\u2019t take in\nanything else at all. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, dear,\u201d the angel muttered tonelessly,\nobviously not hearing him. He turned a page.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAngel, make love to me,\u201d Crowley said,\nslowly walking forward, his bare feet padding soundlessly on the wooden boards until\nthey met the rug in Aziraphale\u2019s reading nook, and Aziraphale didn\u2019t look at\nhim, didn\u2019t even blink as his gaze flickering over the page. \u201cAngel, won\u2019t you <i>take</i> me? Won\u2019t you <i>know</i> me? Won\u2019t you\u2014 Oh, for Go\u2014 for <i>someone\u2019s</i> sake, Aziraphale, would you listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear,\u201d Aziraphale said blandly. He\nturned another page.</p><p>Crowley gritted his teeth, and he leaned\nforward, sliding his hands onto Aziraphale\u2019s knees and leaning forward, his\nfingers drawing over Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, his fingers pressing down on the fat,\npillowy flesh beneath the cream-coloured fabric of his trousers, his heart\nleaping at how <i>warm</i> he was, how soft\u2014</p><p>Aziraphale leaned back slightly in his\nseat, and Crowley\u2019s heart jumped in his chest, but he was just slightly\nadjusting his position.</p><p>\u201c<i>Aziraphale</i>,\u201d\nCrowley said plaintively. </p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Crowley clambered into the angel\u2019s lap,\nslinking forward with an inhumanly flexible spine and putting his head underneath\nAziraphale\u2019s arms where they came around to grasp at the book, sliding his\nnaked body up against the soft, yellow wool of Aziraphale\u2019s knitted vest,\nfeeling Aziraphale\u2019s <i>belly</i>, his\nchest, his thighs underneath Crowley\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201c<i>Aziraphale</i>,\u201d\nCrowley whispered, putting his hands up against Aziraphale\u2019s cheeks and winding\nthem through the soft, downy white-blond of his hair. It was awful hair,\nCrowley had always thought. It suited Aziraphale, that much was true, but it always\nhad a sickly air to it \u2013 curly in a limp sort of way, like pondweed hung up to\ndry. It <i>felt </i>nice, though.

It was too intense, dragging right\ninto the core of him, and Aziraphale just wouldn\u2019t stopped, rubbed his fingers\nin a slow and deliberate circle as lightning crackled through him, and he choked,\nkeened\u2014</p><p>Came.</p><p>His cock was pulsing, <i>ruining</i> the skimpy little thong, his bollocks drawn up tight, and Aziraphale\ndidn\u2019t stop, working away on autopilot: he was fucking Crowley with his fingers,\nletting Crowley ride his way through it, and then <i>past</i> it.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley mumbled, as Aziraphale\nshifted his wrist, twisting his fingers, and he heard the turn of a page. \u201cAziraphale,\nyou can stop, you can stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>And Crowley could have <i>stopped</i> him, could have climbed down, but\u2014</p><p>But it was <i>sexy</i>.</p><p><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654</b></p><p>Crowley stirred, later on, as Aziraphale\ntook him up in his arms, carrying him gently, bundled up against his chest.

He\nliked it, when Aziraphale was condescending and pretended he didn&rsquo;t care, when\nhe talked down to Crowley and put on his &ldquo;I know best, my dear,&rdquo; tone, acted\nlike Crowley was some pretty little idiot he could do whatever he liked to, but\nthis, this was&mdash;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t even paying <i>attention</i> to him, was sliding his finger into Crowley&rsquo;s arse and\nnot even looking up from his book, like he didn&rsquo;t even <i>care</i>, and Crowley&rsquo;s cock was hard in the lace fabric of the stupid\nlittle thong, pressed right up against the swell of Aziraphale&rsquo;s belly. </p><p>Aziraphale put another finger forward, pressing\ndown <i>hard</i> against Crowley&rsquo;s prostate,\nand Crowley yelped, his hips jumping: his cock thrust against the soft curve of\nAziraphale&rsquo;s gut, the lace a tantalising play against his prick, his cockhead,\nand he was <i>wet</i>, he <i>wanted</i>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck me,&rdquo; Crowley begged, his hips shifting\nforward, grinding against Aziraphale as Aziraphale scissored his fingers,\nstretching him wider, and Crowley hissed, his thighs spreading right apart. &ldquo;Aziraphale,\nangel, please, let me just get your cock out, let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale pressed down harder, too hard, <i>too hard</i>, and Crowley heaved in a\ndesperate gasp, his head tipping back as <i>fireworks</i>\nburst behind his eyes, and his fingers were tipped with claws as he grabbed at\nAziraphale&rsquo;s shoulders, his hips lurching. It was too intense, dragging right\ninto the core of him, and Aziraphale just wouldn&rsquo;t stopped, rubbed his fingers\nin a slow and deliberate circle as lightning crackled through him, and he choked,\nkeened&mdash;</p><p>Came.</p><p>His cock was pulsing, <i>ruining</i> the skimpy little thong, his bollocks drawn up tight, and Aziraphale\ndidn&rsquo;t stop, working away on autopilot: he was fucking Crowley with his fingers,\nletting Crowley ride his way through it, and then <i>past</i> it.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; Crowley mumbled, as Aziraphale\nshifted his wrist, twisting his fingers, and he heard the turn of a page. &ldquo;Aziraphale,\nyou can stop, you can stop&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p>And Crowley could have <i>stopped</i> him, could have climbed down, but&mdash;</p><p>But it was <i>sexy</i>.</p><p><b>&#9812; </b><b>&#9769; </b><b>&#9812; </b><b>&#9769; </b><b>&#9812; </b><b>&#9769; </b><b>&#9812;</b></p><p>Crowley stirred, later on, as Aziraphale\ntook him up in his arms, carrying him gently, bundled up against his chest. He&rsquo;d\ntaken off the thong, and washed Crowley off with a cloth: the sticky slickness\nwas gone from his cock and his arse, although his thighs ached, his stomach\nached, his arse <i>ached</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;You fell asleep,&rdquo; Aziraphale murmured,\npursing his lips together and looking forward instead of down at Crowley. He\nwas smug.</p><p>&ldquo;I fainted, you mean,&rdquo; Crowley complained,\nwithout real rancour. &ldquo;From exhaustion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dissolute and wanton thing,&rdquo; Aziraphale\nscolded. Crowley shivered: his cock gave the ghost of a twitch of interest.\nAziraphale laid him down on the bed, and he settled down on the bed beside him,\nhis clothes disappearing with a little <i>swish</i>\nof power, and Crowley was on top of him immediately, nuzzling the soft hair on\nAziraphale&rsquo;s chest, grasping eagerly at his belly.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t any less tired.</p><p>He meant to grumble and complain, meant to\nsay it was nasty and unfair, meant to say that he would very much like for\nAziraphale to do that again, possibly forever.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t do that.</p><p>He fell asleep. </p></p>",

He&rsquo;d made sure to brace\nthe bookshelves when he&rsquo;d set them up, so they couldn&rsquo;t fall down one way or\nthe other &ndash; he recalled a library in Venice, in&hellip; What was it, &rsquo;75, maybe &rsquo;77,\nof the 18<sup>th</sup> century? The shelves in <i>that</i> library had really toppled like dominos, and Aziraphale hadn&rsquo;t\nspoken to him for a decade after that, although it had been funny.<br /></p>\n<p>These shelves were <i>not</i> at risk: they were pinned to the floor with steel braces, with\nribbing running between them and caging them against the ceiling, just in case.\n</p>\n<p>Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t look up.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Angel</i>,&rdquo;\nCrowley said again, a little more loudly this time.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t look up, didn&rsquo;t so much\nas stir or show a sign of hearing him. He was absolutely <i>engrossed</i> in some thick philosophy text, one Crowley had never read\nhimself and had no desire to.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Aziraphale,&rdquo; Crowley said, &ldquo;I would love\nto draw your attention to the fact that I am wearing nothing but a lace thong.&rdquo;\nThis was true. It was black, and <i>tight</i>,\nand he had picked it up in town before driving back, had delighted the whole\ndrive in the idea of coming home and getting Aziraphale to take him to bed.</p>\n<p>He hadn&rsquo;t accounted for Aziraphale being in\none of his <i>moods</i>, where he focused so\nentirely on a book the world could explode around him, and didn&rsquo;t take in\nanything else at all. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice, dear,&rdquo; the angel muttered tonelessly,\nobviously not hearing him. He turned a page.</p>\n</p>",
