Drogon would have rained hell down on everyone inside the pit before he died. One only needs to read about the dragons of the Dance to get an understanding of the level of devastation even an injured dragon is capable of. Remember that \u201cmore stayed in their seats\u201d, so there was <i>a lot</i> of people in that pit for Drogon to savage. It\u2019s also possible that Drogon might have tried to fly away at one point during the attack anyway, as Dreamfyre tried to do when the dragonpit was stormed during the Dance of the Dragons.

Who can say that he wouldn\u2019t have tried to fly away and killed all those people anyway?</p><p>The main point here is that Dany had no control over the situation or over Drogon. But she tried. She tried to stop the spearmen from rushing Drogon. She attracted Drogon\u2019s attention away from them and onto herself after he started killing them. She tried to control him and take him out of the pit completely. This wasn\u2019t a situation where Dany chose Drogon\u2019s life over her people\u2019s.

Drogon would have rained hell down on everyone inside the pit before he died. One only needs to read about the dragons of the Dance to get an understanding of the level of devastation even an injured dragon is capable of.

Who can say that he wouldn\u2019t have tried to fly away and killed all those people anyway?</p><p>The main point here is that Dany had no control over the situation or over Drogon. But she tried. She tried to stop the spearmen from rushing Drogon. She attracted Drogon\u2019s attention away from them and onto herself after he started killing them. She tried to control him and take him out of the pit completely. This wasn\u2019t a situation where Dany chose Drogon\u2019s life over her people\u2019s. It was one where Dany had no good options and trying to get Drogon away from Daznak\u2019s Pit looked like the best one.<br></p>",
