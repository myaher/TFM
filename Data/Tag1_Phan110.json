The affectionate feeling dissipated when the words Cameron uttered sent Dan spiraling headfirst into a memory.</p><p><i>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Phil kissed Dan on the cheek tenderly before he continued to cook the pancakes on the stove. Dan had his arms wrapped around his boyfriend\u2019s waist with his chin rested gently against Phil\u2019s shoulder to watch the pancake batter solidify.</i><i>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I got so lucky to have an amazing boyfriend who\u2019s willing to wake up earlier to make pancakes,\u201d</i></p><p><i> Dan watched Phil\u2019s pale cheeks take on a tinge of rosy pink at the compliment. At that moment, he knew he would never stop loving Phil until the day he died. And he wasn\u2019t wrong.</i></p><p><b>\u2018And I, I know how to play. I know this game. It\u2019s all the same\u2019</b></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want for dinner, my love?\u201d The sweet nickname only added to the tornado of turmoil building up inside Dan\u2019s body as memories began flashing in his head like strobe lights.</p><p>\u201cChinese would be perfect,\u201d Dan suggested, unconsciously holding in a breath he released when Cameron left the bedroom to call the restaurant. He had promised himself to not dwell on the past; yet here he was, thinking about his ex while sitting in his lover\u2019s bedroom. The sour irony of the appearance of memories created a bitter taste in Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p><i>\u201cWe never eat at restaurants anymore. We always get take-out. Can we please go to a restaurant just this one time? Please?\u201d Dan begged, hoping that Phil would consider his request instead of immediately turning it down like he always did.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t\u2026 handle all the people,\u201d Phil squeezed his eyes shut, the corners of his lips tugging into a frown. Normally Dan would have agreed with Phil about dealing with people but lately, they had been so pent up in their apartment that Dan wanted to try something new. He seemed frustrated at himself rather than annoyed at Dan so Dan decided not to continue asking. As Dan swallowed his protests, his once stable relationship slowly began to seem evanescent with every small argument that followed.</i></p><p><i><b>\u2018Would\u2019ve gave it all for you, cared for you so tell me where it went wrong\u2019</b></i></p><p>Dan flipped through the movies that were available on demand as he listened to Cameron place the order. His eyes landed on movies he knew he and Phil would\u2019ve watched together at the theatre, giggling at plot inconsistencies and sharing warm, buttery popcorn that would\u2019ve left a lingering taste on their fingertips. Trying to repress the memories further back into his brain was clearly not working so he allowed himself to silently suffer through the memories.</p><p><i>Dan was grateful for these little moments where he and Phil were content with each other. Here they were, nestled closely under the blanket finding comfort in each other\u2019s warmth.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo, American Horror Story as usual?\u201d Phil asked, his finger hovering over the select button on the TV remote. Dan nodded eagerly, inching closer to Phil even though their bodies were already pressed together tightly. Dan was close enough to take a deep inhale of Phil\u2019s unique scent of cinnamon and lazy Sunday afternoons. He shut his eyes to implant the exact image of this moment in his memory down to the pile of tinsel left from the Christmas. Dan knew that the moment was too perfect to be true and the fallout proved his point to be correct.</i></p><p><i><b>\u2018Would\u2019ve trade it all for you, there for you so tell me how to move on. Would\u2019ve trade it all for you, cared for you\u2019</b></i></p><p>From the first date Dan went on after he and Phil separated, he had a feeling the Phil-shaped hole in his life would be difficult to fill. He went on several dates with a handful of different people that left his disappointed. When Dan met Cameron, he instantly developed a liking for him.</p><p>Maybe it was because Cameron\u2019s laughs didn\u2019t sound as forced as those of other people or maybe it was how passionate Cameron was about animals that drove Dan to bring up a possibility of a second date. Fast forward a few months and Dan now was in a relationship only six months after his last.</p><p><i><b>\u2018Now if I keep my eyes closed he looks just like you but he\u2019ll never stay, they never do\u2019</b></i></p><p>Dan\u2019s longest relationship had lasted eight months. That was the record before he met Phil. His relationship with Phil lasted about four years and he felt like nobody else would be able to beat that record.</p><p>Dan was too afraid to admit how the name \u201cPhil\u201d still rested on his lips every morning when he woke up. Those same lips were now kissed by Cameron, who Dan\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t seem to provide enough love for. Everyday with Cameron was a movie on a never-ending loop. The experiences Dan had with Phil were frighteningly similar to those he had with Cameron.</p><p>Dan\u2019s brain seemed to always reroute back to old habits and unfortunately, on of those habits happened to be a person. It would be so much easier to move on if Dan could just wipe all memories of Phil, the joyous ones included.</p><p><i><b>\u2018They don\u2019t realize that I\u2019m thinking about you. It\u2019s nothing new, it\u2019s nothing new\u2019</b></i></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, sweetheart? You seem awfully distracted,\u201d Cameron gently nudged Dan, causing him to promptly snap back into reality. He hoped he seemed convincing enough as he curled up to properly ensconce himself into Cameron\u2019s warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t notice how much colder it\u2019s getting now that winter\u2019s coming.\u201dLying was almost second nature for Dan. As his and Phil\u2019s relationship deteriorated, he learned how to smoothly lie to others about how he and Phil were doing. Dan even began to lie to Phil, assuring his boyfriend that everything was going to work out. That was, of course, when they were able to calmly communicate. Talking to each other rarely appeared to be an option later on as all they seemed to do was yell or ignore each other.</p><p>Dan had finally decided to be the more responsible one to end the restless act of normality and ignorance they participated in for the past weeks. He could recall the promptness of Phil\u2019s departure, the muffled clanging din of packed objects thrown into boxes, and silent sobs in the dead of the night. The morning after Dan lacerated Phil with soft-spoken words, not a single trace of Phil was left in Dan\u2019s apartment. All he had to hold on of Phil were memories that were one day going to disappear too. So, Dan now had to force himself to enjoy the present with Cameron because after all, living in the past was too easy with your eyes closed.</p><p><i><b>\u2018Now if I keep my eyes closed he feels just like you but you\u2019ve been replaced I\u2019m face to face with someone new\u2019</b></i></p><p>~</p><p>read the rest of the fics in my songfic series under the tag <b>#sam\u2019s songfic series</b></p><p>want to read more phanfics? check out my phanfiction page on my blog!</p>",

Dan had his arms wrapped around his boyfriend\u2019s waist with his chin rested gently against Phil\u2019s shoulder to watch the pancake batter solidify.</i><i>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I got so lucky to have an amazing boyfriend who\u2019s willing to wake up earlier to make pancakes,\u201d</i></p><p><i> Dan watched Phil\u2019s pale cheeks take on a tinge of rosy pink at the compliment. At that moment, he knew he would never stop loving Phil until the day he died. And he wasn\u2019t wrong.</i></p><p><b>\u2018And I, I know how to play. I know this game. It\u2019s all the same\u2019</b></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want for dinner, my love?\u201d The sweet nickname only added to the tornado of turmoil building up inside Dan\u2019s body as memories began flashing in his head like strobe lights.</p><p>\u201cChinese would be perfect,\u201d Dan suggested, unconsciously holding in a breath he released when Cameron left the bedroom to call the restaurant. He had promised himself to not dwell on the past; yet here he was, thinking about his ex while sitting in his lover\u2019s bedroom. The sour irony of the appearance of memories created a bitter taste in Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p><i>\u201cWe never eat at restaurants anymore. We always get take-out. Can we please go to a restaurant just this one time? Please?\u201d Dan begged, hoping that Phil would consider his request instead of immediately turning it down like he always did.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t\u2026 handle all the people,\u201d Phil squeezed his eyes shut, the corners of his lips tugging into a frown. Normally Dan would have agreed with Phil about dealing with people but lately, they had been so pent up in their apartment that Dan wanted to try something new. He seemed frustrated at himself rather than annoyed at Dan so Dan decided not to continue asking. As Dan swallowed his protests, his once stable relationship slowly began to seem evanescent with every small argument that followed.</i></p><p><i><b>\u2018Would\u2019ve gave it all for you, cared for you so tell me where it went wrong\u2019</b></i></p><p>Dan flipped through the movies that were available on demand as he listened to Cameron place the order. His eyes landed on movies he knew he and Phil would\u2019ve watched together at the theatre, giggling at plot inconsistencies and sharing warm, buttery popcorn that would\u2019ve left a lingering taste on their fingertips. Trying to repress the memories further back into his brain was clearly not working so he allowed himself to silently suffer through the memories.</p><p><i>Dan was grateful for these little moments where he and Phil were content with each other. Here they were, nestled closely under the blanket finding comfort in each other\u2019s warmth.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo, American Horror Story as usual?\u201d Phil asked, his finger hovering over the select button on the TV remote. Dan nodded eagerly, inching closer to Phil even though their bodies were already pressed together tightly. Dan was close enough to take a deep inhale of Phil\u2019s unique scent of cinnamon and lazy Sunday afternoons. He shut his eyes to implant the exact image of this moment in his memory down to the pile of tinsel left from the Christmas. Dan knew that the moment was too perfect to be true and the fallout proved his point to be correct.</i></p><p><i><b>\u2018Would\u2019ve trade it all for you, there for you so tell me how to move on. Would\u2019ve trade it all for you, cared for you\u2019</b></i></p><p>From the first date Dan went on after he and Phil separated, he had a feeling the Phil-shaped hole in his life would be difficult to fill. He went on several dates with a handful of different people that left his disappointed. When Dan met Cameron, he instantly developed a liking for him.</p><p>Maybe it was because Cameron\u2019s laughs didn\u2019t sound as forced as those of other people or maybe it was how passionate Cameron was about animals that drove Dan to bring up a possibility of a second date. Fast forward a few months and Dan now was in a relationship only six months after his last.</p><p><i><b>\u2018Now if I keep my eyes closed he looks just like you but he\u2019ll never stay, they never do\u2019</b></i></p><p>Dan\u2019s longest relationship had lasted eight months. That was the record before he met Phil. His relationship with Phil lasted about four years and he felt like nobody else would be able to beat that record.</p><p>Dan was too afraid to admit how the name \u201cPhil\u201d still rested on his lips every morning when he woke up. Those same lips were now kissed by Cameron, who Dan\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t seem to provide enough love for. Everyday with Cameron was a movie on a never-ending loop. The experiences Dan had with Phil were frighteningly similar to those he had with Cameron.</p><p>Dan\u2019s brain seemed to always reroute back to old habits and unfortunately, on of those habits happened to be a person. It would be so much easier to move on if Dan could just wipe all memories of Phil, the joyous ones included.</p><p><i><b>\u2018They don\u2019t realize that I\u2019m thinking about you. It\u2019s nothing new, it\u2019s nothing new\u2019</b></i></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, sweetheart? You seem awfully distracted,\u201d Cameron gently nudged Dan, causing him to promptly snap back into reality. He hoped he seemed convincing enough as he curled up to properly ensconce himself into Cameron\u2019s warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t notice how much colder it\u2019s getting now that winter\u2019s coming.\u201dLying was almost second nature for Dan. As his and Phil\u2019s relationship deteriorated, he learned how to smoothly lie to others about how he and Phil were doing. Dan even began to lie to Phil, assuring his boyfriend that everything was going to work out. That was, of course, when they were able to calmly communicate. Talking to each other rarely appeared to be an option later on as all they seemed to do was yell or ignore each other.</p><p>Dan had finally decided to be the more responsible one to end the restless act of normality and ignorance they participated in for the past weeks. He could recall the promptness of Phil\u2019s departure, the muffled clanging din of packed objects thrown into boxes, and silent sobs in the dead of the night. The morning after Dan lacerated Phil with soft-spoken words, not a single trace of Phil was left in Dan\u2019s apartment. All he had to hold on of Phil were memories that were one day going to disappear too. So, Dan now had to force himself to enjoy the present with Cameron because after all, living in the past was too easy with your eyes closed.</p><p><i><b>\u2018Now if I keep my eyes closed he feels just like you but you\u2019ve been replaced I\u2019m face to face with someone new\u2019</b></i></p><p>~</p><p>read the rest of the fics in my songfic series under the tag <b>#sam\u2019s songfic series</b></p><p>want to read more phanfics? check out my phanfiction page on my blog!</p>",

Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br/></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 1.9k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and light smut\u00a0</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit (from this point on)\u00a0</p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday at 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/42692918\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a>**</b></p><p><b>A/N: </b>Updates are going to be every Sunday now until I get back ahead of myself writing!

Sorry!\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>It was hard for Phil to watch Dan leave the next morning, that he will admit. He never expected to feel such a gutted sensation in his chest to see Dan get into the black cab and drive off into the distance.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe got used to having another person in his life, living at his flat even if it was just for three days. So to go from hearing Dan to having radio silence again was hard. He even thought for a moment that Spike felt the same way with the way he whimpered for minutes after Dan left.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe fell asleep, not long after. And he tried his best to sleep in before he had to go back to the BBC for his next shift. By 10am, he was already catching the tube to the BBC and he was already missing the last few days.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ was already in the office before him, sitting at his laptop and scribbling on a piece of blank paper. \u201cMorning.\u201d Phil says, setting down his bag at his desk and plopping into the chair. \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cQuite eventful actually.\u201d PJ answered, looking from his laptop and leaning back in his seat. \u201cSophie and I went to visit her parents in Brighton.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlthough, I don\u2019t think our weekend was quite as eventful as yours. When were you gonna tell me that you and Daniel Howell were shacking up in your flat?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s eyes widened and he immediately stood up, walked over to the door of their office, and shut it before returning back to his desk. \u201cOkay, listen.\u201d Phil began. \u201cDan wanted to come back to London without being noticed so he stayed at my flat this weekend.

But I\u2019m just telling you what every single story is about. Your video is the product of every entertainment news source out there. Everybody who watched your video is commenting about how you and Dan acted in it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his body tense but then relax. PJ wasn\u2019t trying to be rude or even aggressive, he was just looking out for Phil. He had to remember that. That\u2019s exactly why PJ was showing Phil these headlines now and not letting Phil discover them for himself.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Phil said, letting out a breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been on edge about the entire thing. The video was Dan\u2019s idea but I also agreed to it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ nodded and reached down, turning his laptop back to face him again, the headline no longer glaring Phil in the face.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, can I ask you something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his stomach drop, and his heart pick up speed.

He could say any number of responses from no to I want to. But he doesn\u2019t know the correct response.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo.\u201d Phil says finally. \u201cDan and I are not dating.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere is a lull in the air, his words hanging like a string in front of them. PJ looks down at his desk and then back up at Phil. \u201cYou\u2019d tell me if you two were together right? Like you wouldn\u2019t let me find it out over some stupid headline?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded. \u201cIf Dan and I ever date, then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ flashed him a smile and Phil flashed one back.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe room remained silent as they worked on their own assignments, and when it came time for them to leave, they both took the same tube train and went out to coffee and dinner at a local cafe.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tPhil found it hard to go back onto social media. He found it incredibly difficult to even open up his Twitter app or even his Facebook. The worst part yet was that his brother and even his mum had texted him as well, talking about the video and asking all sorts of questions. He particularly didn\u2019t want to answer anyone.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis afternoon found himself sitting on his couch with Spike between his feet on the floor, chewing on a new toy Phil had found in his closet, still in the packaging. Spike didn\u2019t ruin toys easily so Phil never bought him anything. So for Spike, even though it was only February, it was Christmas.\u00a0</p><p>\t Speaking of February, Valentine\u2019s Day was in two days and Phil was feeling the soft pit in his stomach at, once again, not having anyone to share it with. Last year, he had opted for a sad hook up via Grindr that he regretted almost as soon as it was over\u2015which granted, it only lasted around five minutes.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut this year, he didn\u2019t have any plans besides sitting at home with Spike and thinking of Dan. It\u2019s hitting him pretty hard now, he\u2019s decided. This crush has turned into more and he\u2019s definitely seeing that now as he lets out a loud sigh, causing Spike to look up at him before he returning to his gnawing.\u00a0</p><p>\t He supposes that it\u2019ll be just as pathetic this year, eating chocolate alone (even though he\u2019s allergic but not bad enough where he\u2019ll willingly give it up) and indulging in some self-love that night.\u00a0</p><p>\tThinking about it now, he doesn\u2019t even remember the last time he got himself off. It\u2019s kind of sad really. He\u2019s been so preoccupied with Dan that he hasn\u2019t even had time to really think about his own needs.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe shakes his head. He shouldn\u2019t be ashamed about getting himself off in his own time. And maybe, deep down, he\u2019s not. But he is ashamed about the fact that he\u2019s currently thinking about Dan and about getting himself off all in the same thought.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut surely he\u2019s not alone in this right? It\u2019s not entirely a bad thing to think of someone so attractive that you could get off to their image? Isn\u2019t that just porn? Phil\u2019s gotten off to a lot of porn over his teenage and adult year.\u00a0</p><p>\tThis is dumb. And worst of all, his pants are feeling tighter as he continues to think about porn and other images in his head. And even worse yet, he\u2019s imaging Dan\u2019s face, the way his dimples sunk into his skin as he spoke or even smiled. How would they look as Dan was in the throes of pleasure?\u00a0</p><p>\tHeat begins to course in his stomach and he finds himself feeling the urges of arousal. He stood up from the couch, leaving Spike behind as he walked to his bedroom and shut the door, not particularly feeling like he was willing to jerk off with Spike watching him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil unlocked his phone and goes into Safari, clicking on incognito mode as he types in his favorite porn site into the search bar. He\u2019s nearly clicking on the link to the site, his left hand already palming himself through his pajama pants when he gets possibly the worst thought in his head.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe suddenly finds himself googling \u201cDan Howell sex scene\u201d. Dan had mentioned that he did an indie film with his ex-boyfriend that involved a sex scene. God, why is he trying to find this? This has to be wrong?\u00a0</p><p>\tBut yet, he\u2019s clicking on a link to it and the video comes up on his phone screen and there is Dan, shirtless on a bed kissing some hunky blonde. He looks younger than the Dan he knows now. For one, his hair is longer and pin-straight. Not even a curl in site. And his body is less defined, much skinnier than he is now. His heart races and he sees the name of the movie credited by the video. Rain of Colorado. He quickly googles the name of the film and finds out that it was filmed in 2014 and that makes him feel a lot less guilty over getting off on it considering Dan would be 23.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe goes back to the original tab with the video and presses play and instantly, his senses are overloaded. Dan\u2019s moans coming from the kisses are actually pornographic. His body language and his shirtless torso is\u2026breathtaking. Phil feels his body let out a little moan as he reaches down into his pants and takes himself into his hold, stroking slowly to get himself to full hardness.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe video continues and suddenly Dan is underneath this guy, the camera is showing them moving together are one, the bed moving with them. The headboard is hitting the wall and banging like a drum to Phil\u2019s ears.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe scene ends just as both Dan and his ex appear to orgasm. And of course it is all fake but Phil still feels his breath shorten and his cock leak in his palm as he strokes faster and faster. He reaches down, the phone tossed to the side, and pulls his pants down under hardened cock, letting it hit his stomach with a wet smack. He spits into his hand for some extra leverage and picks up his pace, stroking himself with more and more eagerness.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt feels amazing, despite it being only his hand. \u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s imagining Dan\u2019s face as he orgasmed on film. His mind flashed to how amazing Dan would look under him as Phil thrusts into him and over and over again as they chase their high. Or maybe it would be Dan thrusting into Phil. He\u2019s likes both sides.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe heat coils in his stomach way too fast for his liking and he cups his left hand over the head of his cock just in time to catch his release, streaking white over his fingers.

Sorry!\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>It was hard for Phil to watch Dan leave the next morning, that he will admit. He never expected to feel such a gutted sensation in his chest to see Dan get into the black cab and drive off into the distance.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe got used to having another person in his life, living at his flat even if it was just for three days. So to go from hearing Dan to having radio silence again was hard. He even thought for a moment that Spike felt the same way with the way he whimpered for minutes after Dan left.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe fell asleep, not long after. And he tried his best to sleep in before he had to go back to the BBC for his next shift. By 10am, he was already catching the tube to the BBC and he was already missing the last few days.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ was already in the office before him, sitting at his laptop and scribbling on a piece of blank paper. \u201cMorning.\u201d Phil says, setting down his bag at his desk and plopping into the chair. \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cQuite eventful actually.\u201d PJ answered, looking from his laptop and leaning back in his seat. \u201cSophie and I went to visit her parents in Brighton.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlthough, I don\u2019t think our weekend was quite as eventful as yours. When were you gonna tell me that you and Daniel Howell were shacking up in your flat?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s eyes widened and he immediately stood up, walked over to the door of their office, and shut it before returning back to his desk. \u201cOkay, listen.\u201d Phil began. \u201cDan wanted to come back to London without being noticed so he stayed at my flat this weekend.

He never expected to feel such a gutted sensation in his chest to see Dan get into the black cab and drive off into the distance.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe got used to having another person in his life, living at his flat even if it was just for three days. So to go from hearing Dan to having radio silence again was hard. He even thought for a moment that Spike felt the same way with the way he whimpered for minutes after Dan left.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe fell asleep, not long after. And he tried his best to sleep in before he had to go back to the BBC for his next shift. By 10am, he was already catching the tube to the BBC and he was already missing the last few days.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ was already in the office before him, sitting at his laptop and scribbling on a piece of blank paper. \u201cMorning.\u201d Phil says, setting down his bag at his desk and plopping into the chair. \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cQuite eventful actually.\u201d PJ answered, looking from his laptop and leaning back in his seat. \u201cSophie and I went to visit her parents in Brighton.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlthough, I don\u2019t think our weekend was quite as eventful as yours. When were you gonna tell me that you and Daniel Howell were shacking up in your flat?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s eyes widened and he immediately stood up, walked over to the door of their office, and shut it before returning back to his desk. \u201cOkay, listen.\u201d Phil began. \u201cDan wanted to come back to London without being noticed so he stayed at my flat this weekend. It was nothing more.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, you two certainly made a mark with that video you posted.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Phil questioned. \u201cIt was just a harmless video.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHave you even been on social media since you posted it?\u201d PJ asked, suddenly turning his laptop around to show Phil the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gulped, and read the first headline.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHEART EYES HOWELL? IS THIS THE NEW MYSTERIOUS MAN IN DANIEL HOWELL\u2019S LIFE\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPJ, you know that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d Phil cried, pointing at the screen. \u201cDan and I are just friends!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ threw his hands up. \u201cCalm down, mate.\u201d He said, his voice soft. \u201cI know that. But I\u2019m just telling you what every single story is about. Your video is the product of every entertainment news source out there. Everybody who watched your video is commenting about how you and Dan acted in it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his body tense but then relax. PJ wasn\u2019t trying to be rude or even aggressive, he was just looking out for Phil. He had to remember that. That\u2019s exactly why PJ was showing Phil these headlines now and not letting Phil discover them for himself.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Phil said, letting out a breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been on edge about the entire thing. The video was Dan\u2019s idea but I also agreed to it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ nodded and reached down, turning his laptop back to face him again, the headline no longer glaring Phil in the face.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, can I ask you something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his stomach drop, and his heart pick up speed. Looking closely, one could probably see the way Phil\u2019s chest was beating so hard through his jumper.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you and Dan dating?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil knew the question was coming and even though the answer was, without a doubt, no, he still felt a multitude of answers go through his head as he began to process it. He could say any number of responses from no to I want to. But he doesn\u2019t know the correct response.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo.\u201d Phil says finally. \u201cDan and I are not dating.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere is a lull in the air, his words hanging like a string in front of them. PJ looks down at his desk and then back up at Phil. \u201cYou\u2019d tell me if you two were together right? Like you wouldn\u2019t let me find it out over some stupid headline?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded. \u201cIf Dan and I ever date, then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ flashed him a smile and Phil flashed one back.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe room remained silent as they worked on their own assignments, and when it came time for them to leave, they both took the same tube train and went out to coffee and dinner at a local cafe.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tPhil found it hard to go back onto social media. He found it incredibly difficult to even open up his Twitter app or even his Facebook. The worst part yet was that his brother and even his mum had texted him as well, talking about the video and asking all sorts of questions. He particularly didn\u2019t want to answer anyone.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis afternoon found himself sitting on his couch with Spike between his feet on the floor, chewing on a new toy Phil had found in his closet, still in the packaging. Spike didn\u2019t ruin toys easily so Phil never bought him anything. So for Spike, even though it was only February, it was Christmas.\u00a0</p><p>\t Speaking of February, Valentine\u2019s Day was in two days and Phil was feeling the soft pit in his stomach at, once again, not having anyone to share it with. Last year, he had opted for a sad hook up via Grindr that he regretted almost as soon as it was over\u2015which granted, it only lasted around five minutes.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut this year, he didn\u2019t have any plans besides sitting at home with Spike and thinking of Dan. It\u2019s hitting him pretty hard now, he\u2019s decided. This crush has turned into more and he\u2019s definitely seeing that now as he lets out a loud sigh, causing Spike to look up at him before he returning to his gnawing.\u00a0</p><p>\t He supposes that it\u2019ll be just as pathetic this year, eating chocolate alone (even though he\u2019s allergic but not bad enough where he\u2019ll willingly give it up) and indulging in some self-love that night.\u00a0</p><p>\tThinking about it now, he doesn\u2019t even remember the last time he got himself off. It\u2019s kind of sad really. He\u2019s been so preoccupied with Dan that he hasn\u2019t even had time to really think about his own needs.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe shakes his head. He shouldn\u2019t be ashamed about getting himself off in his own time. And maybe, deep down, he\u2019s not. But he is ashamed about the fact that he\u2019s currently thinking about Dan and about getting himself off all in the same thought.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut surely he\u2019s not alone in this right? It\u2019s not entirely a bad thing to think of someone so attractive that you could get off to their image? Isn\u2019t that just porn? Phil\u2019s gotten off to a lot of porn over his teenage and adult year.\u00a0</p><p>\tThis is dumb. And worst of all, his pants are feeling tighter as he continues to think about porn and other images in his head. And even worse yet, he\u2019s imaging Dan\u2019s face, the way his dimples sunk into his skin as he spoke or even smiled. How would they look as Dan was in the throes of pleasure?\u00a0</p><p>\tHeat begins to course in his stomach and he finds himself feeling the urges of arousal. He stood up from the couch, leaving Spike behind as he walked to his bedroom and shut the door, not particularly feeling like he was willing to jerk off with Spike watching him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil unlocked his phone and goes into Safari, clicking on incognito mode as he types in his favorite porn site into the search bar. He\u2019s nearly clicking on the link to the site, his left hand already palming himself through his pajama pants when he gets possibly the worst thought in his head.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe suddenly finds himself googling \u201cDan Howell sex scene\u201d. Dan had mentioned that he did an indie film with his ex-boyfriend that involved a sex scene. God, why is he trying to find this? This has to be wrong?\u00a0</p><p>\tBut yet, he\u2019s clicking on a link to it and the video comes up on his phone screen and there is Dan, shirtless on a bed kissing some hunky blonde. He looks younger than the Dan he knows now. For one, his hair is longer and pin-straight. Not even a curl in site. And his body is less defined, much skinnier than he is now. His heart races and he sees the name of the movie credited by the video. Rain of Colorado. He quickly googles the name of the film and finds out that it was filmed in 2014 and that makes him feel a lot less guilty over getting off on it considering Dan would be 23.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe goes back to the original tab with the video and presses play and instantly, his senses are overloaded. Dan\u2019s moans coming from the kisses are actually pornographic. His body language and his shirtless torso is\u2026breathtaking. Phil feels his body let out a little moan as he reaches down into his pants and takes himself into his hold, stroking slowly to get himself to full hardness.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe video continues and suddenly Dan is underneath this guy, the camera is showing them moving together are one, the bed moving with them. The headboard is hitting the wall and banging like a drum to Phil\u2019s ears.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe scene ends just as both Dan and his ex appear to orgasm. And of course it is all fake but Phil still feels his breath shorten and his cock leak in his palm as he strokes faster and faster. He reaches down, the phone tossed to the side, and pulls his pants down under hardened cock, letting it hit his stomach with a wet smack. He spits into his hand for some extra leverage and picks up his pace, stroking himself with more and more eagerness.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt feels amazing, despite it being only his hand. \u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s imagining Dan\u2019s face as he orgasmed on film. His mind flashed to how amazing Dan would look under him as Phil thrusts into him and over and over again as they chase their high. Or maybe it would be Dan thrusting into Phil. He\u2019s likes both sides.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe heat coils in his stomach way too fast for his liking and he cups his left hand over the head of his cock just in time to catch his release, streaking white over his fingers. His body is heaving and he\u2019s breathing way too hard but the release was enough to rest his tired and tense muscles and his constantly overthinking brain.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reaches to his nightstand and grabs a wad of tissues as he wipes off his hand and then tosses the tissues in his waste bin. He should get up and wash off, even take a shower, but he\u2019s feeling too much like jelly to stand.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tucks himself back into his pants and then grabs his phone, closing the video and closing out of the tab. He goes back to his home screen and notices a little red bubble next to his messages app and he opens it, reading the message.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>That was the worst scene I\u2019ve ever filmed and I actually feel a bit humiliated are you able to talk?\u00a0</p><p>\tHis heart falls out of his chest and he suddenly feels like he\u2019s going to be sick.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he answers anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>Of course! Call whenever you\u2019re ready!\u00a0</p>",
