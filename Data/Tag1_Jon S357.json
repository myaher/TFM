I won&rsquo;t let them set us apart.&rdquo; You only nodded and sent him a reassuring smile but couldn&rsquo;t but notice a sting of unease in your stomach. Suddenly, the door sprung open and you flinched, half expecting wights. But it was just Olly, the boy rescued from the wildlings. Jon, still standing in front of you and shielding you with his body out of instinct, raised an eyebrow at him. &ldquo;Sorry Lord Commander&rdquo;, he gasped out with a red face. &ldquo;They say your uncle&rsquo;s back&rdquo;. Wordlessly, Jon followed him out of the door quickly. You went to the window and looked outside into the snowy night. Ghost let out a low growl. &ldquo;Ghost?&rdquo;, you questioned, squatting down in front of him and stroked his fur. &ldquo;Jon will be back any time soon&rdquo;, you told him. Ghost only ran outside, now fully growling. You decided to follow him. &ldquo;Jon?&rdquo;, you called, growing a bit concerned. What could possibly make Ghost behave so aggressive? You hurried down the stairs and quickly spotted a group of shadows and ran over them with a relieved laugh. &ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; And there was Olly too - stabbing - a knife - into Jon&rsquo;s - chest? You dropped to the ground and let out a blood-freezing scream. No. Not him. He looked at you for the last time before his eyes lost their light-for ever. You watched him die in disbelief, tears streaming down your face and not even feeling the hands carrying you back inside.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>The next five years had made your heart cold. Shortly after his death, you had escaped with Ghost from Castle Black. Although you saw no sense in living, you saw none in dying either. You had hunted in the woods behind the wall. A year ago, you had to hide from wildlings who seemingly wanted to attack the castle. You didn&rsquo;t care if they succeeded or not. You lived without any joy and spent your days distracting yourself from thinking too much about.. him. Until that one night.. You were skinning rabbits, Ghost was hunting and you had just decided to go farther north to eventually meet up with wildlings. Living on your own was though, and winter was coming, after all. Suddenly, you noticed a shadow standing near you. You gasped out in shock and grabbed your bow, aiming it at a - woman? &ldquo;Do not fear me, Y/N&rdquo;, she said gently, looking directly into my eyes. Her hair was fiery red and she wore a ruby necklace that had to be worth more than all your propertaties. You eyed her suspiciously, but slowly lowered the bow. &ldquo;How do you know my name?&rdquo;, you asked, your voice raw from not speaking so long. She smiled and began to walk around. &ldquo;Azor Ahai is thinking about you all the time. In his sleep, in his dreams I can see you clear as the day. He misses you. He still loves you.&rdquo; Loves me? Still loves me? &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re talking about. I know no man of this name and neither do I have any one I once loved.&rdquo; She sighed, piercing me with her red gaze. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know him under the name of a bastard. Jon Snow.&rdquo; Tears welled up in your eyes and you gripped your bow tighter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying. He died before my eyes, betrayed by his man and murdered as a traitor.&rdquo; You wouldn&rsquo;t cry. &ldquo;I know, darling&rdquo;, she said soothingly. &ldquo;But I also saw him return from the dead, in fact&rdquo; - she looked at her hands - &ldquo;brought these hands him back.&rdquo; You laughed. &ldquo;Have you been drinking too much? Leave now.&rdquo; &ldquo;But it is true, he&rsquo;s still Commander and yearning for you.&rdquo; &ldquo;How do I know you&rsquo;re not lying?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you know who Arya is?&rdquo; Your breathing hitched. He used to talk about her so often. &ldquo;She has arrived a few days ago, accompanied by a rather big woman and a little warrior boy.&rdquo; Without saying anything, you stormed outside and ignored the smirk on the weirds woman face. It was too early have hope, you constantly told yourself. But if it WAS true..Ghost would pick on your tracks easily, you told yourself. And then you were there. The memories were overwhelming. Kissing Jon and inhaling his scent, riding and fighting and eating food from Three - Finger- Hobbs. The gate creaked open and you rode in nervously. And there he was. Taller and more serious than you remembered, but-alive. You gasped out when he stormed towards you. &ldquo;Y/N&rdquo;, he whispered and you felt a tingle when hearing his voice. With tears in your eyes, you nodded to allow him to put you down your horse. As his strong arms wrapped around you, he spun you and you screamed out in delight. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever leave me again&rdquo;, you whispered, bumping your forehead against his. He looked at you so desperately and happy and adoring you felt your heart melt again. And when he slowly lowered you to crush his mouth against yours, you couldn&rsquo;t help but moan because you had craved this for so long. The kiss was a promise and you felt like you could trust in yourself again. </p><h2>You would be happy again.</h2>",

You hurried down the stairs and quickly spotted a group of shadows and ran over them with a relieved laugh. \u201cJon!\u201d And there was Olly too - stabbing - a knife - into Jon\u2019s - chest? You dropped to the ground and let out a blood-freezing scream. No. Not him. He looked at you for the last time before his eyes lost their light-for ever.

You were skinning rabbits, Ghost was hunting and you had just decided to go farther north to eventually meet up with wildlings. Living on your own was though, and winter was coming, after all. Suddenly, you noticed a shadow standing near you. You gasped out in shock and grabbed your bow, aiming it at a - woman? \u201cDo not fear me, Y/N\u201d, she said gently, looking directly into my eyes. Her hair was fiery red and she wore a ruby necklace that had to be worth more than all your propertaties. You eyed her suspiciously, but slowly lowered the bow. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d, you asked, your voice raw from not speaking so long. She smiled and began to walk around. \u201cAzor Ahai is thinking about you all the time. In his sleep, in his dreams I can see you clear as the day. He misses you. He still loves you.\u201d Loves me? Still loves me? \u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about. I know no man of this name and neither do I have any one I once loved.\u201d She sighed, piercing me with her red gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ll know him under the name of a bastard. Jon Snow.\u201d Tears welled up in your eyes and you gripped your bow tighter. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. He died before my eyes, betrayed by his man and murdered as a traitor.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t cry. \u201cI know, darling\u201d, she said soothingly. \u201cBut I also saw him return from the dead, in fact\u201d - she looked at her hands - \u201cbrought these hands him back.\u201d You laughed. \u201cHave you been drinking too much? Leave now.\u201d \u201cBut it is true, he\u2019s still Commander and yearning for you.\u201d \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not lying?\u201d \u201cDo you know who Arya is?\u201d Your breathing hitched.

Kissing Jon and inhaling his scent, riding and fighting and eating food from Three - Finger- Hobbs. The gate creaked open and you rode in nervously. And there he was. Taller and more serious than you remembered, but-alive. You gasped out when he stormed towards you. \u201cY/N\u201d, he whispered and you felt a tingle when hearing his voice.

        "body": "<p>As some of you may know, I subscribe to the theory that dragons and the fire associated Azor Ahai reborn <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168655191984/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">may not be effective</a> in the war against the Others in the Long Night. People generally assume this means inverting the enemy from the Others to the dragons, and I\u2019ve made <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/166317300627/fantasy-antagonists-of-asoiaf-who-are-the-orcs-in#notes\" target=\"_blank\">that mistake too</a> momentarily, but it seems more probable that <i>both</i> extreme fire and extreme ice <a href=\"https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/135888-the-long-night-and-the-great-summer/\" target=\"_blank\">can be harmful</a> to Westeros. There is of course, the apocalyptic implications of the two extremes in Robert Frost\u2019s poem <i><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice\" target=\"_blank\">Fire &amp; Ice</a></i>, that Martin <a href=\"http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html\" target=\"_blank\">admits</a> to have influenced his title, but apart from that the author may have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=273&amp;v=GaPZGDlm2F4\" target=\"_blank\">hinted</a> the Others and Dany\u2019s dragons being two apocalyptic threats to Westeros.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>[&hellip;]\u00a0<b>the two outlying ones \u2014 the things going on north of the Wall, and then there is Targaryen on the other continent with her dragons \u2014 are of course the ice and fire of the title, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d</b> The central stuff \u2014 the stuff that\u2019s happening in the middle, in King\u2019s Landing, the capital of the seven kingdoms \u2014 is much more based on historical events, historical fiction. It\u2019s loosely drawn from the Wars of the Roses and some of the other conflicts around the 100 Years\u2019 War, although, of course, with a fantasy twist. You know, one of the dynamics I started with, there was the sense of people being so consumed by their petty struggles for power within the seven kingdoms, within King\u2019s Landing that <b>they\u2019re blind to the much greater and more dangerous threats that are happening far away on the periphery of their kingdoms.</b><br/></p></blockquote><p>People tend to assume that in this equation, Dany is the political threat to Westeros corruption, but considering GRRM has equated <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">dragons to nuclear power</a>, a destructive force rather than a constructive one (\u201dDragons plant no trees\u201d), this may as well embody the theme of Robert Frost\u2019s <i>Fire &amp; Ice. </i>Both can be<i>\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168471722944/the-ice-and-the-fire-of-the-song-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">equally destructive</a> to human life.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Fire is a cruel way to die</b>. Dalla died to give this child life, but you have nourished him, cherished him. <b>You saved your own boy from the ice. Now save hers from the fire.</b>\u201d \u2014Jon II, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Of course, a number of characters see the return of dragons as a boon with the interpretations of prophecies like Azor Ahai reborn, the Prince That Was Promised, and the presence of Others and the susceptibility of wights to fire and Jon wishing for dragons as weapons of defence at the Wall. That said,\u00a0\u201cProphecy is a sword without a hilt\u201d, and what may seem like a boon may <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">actually be a nightmare</a>. This is a device that has been used by authors like Tolkien in <i><a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/175569556368/the-azor-ahaismaug-connection\" target=\"_blank\">The Hobbit</a></i>\u00a0regarding the Esgaroth prophecy and Tad Williams in<i> <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172113783619/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">Memory, Sorrow, Thorn</a>\u00a0</i>regarding the three<i>\u00a0</i>magical swords from the title and the prophecy about Paris upon his birth from <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/174047973477/trojan-war-literature-influence-on-grrm\" target=\"_blank\">Trojan War cycle</a><i>,</i> <a href=\"https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/08/george-r-r-martin-i-revere-the-lord-of-the-rings/\" target=\"_blank\">all of</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/17/tropes-trolls-and-trump-meet-one-of-george-rr-martins-favourite-fantasy-writers-tad-williams\" target=\"_blank\">whom</a> Martin has admitted to draw inspiration from in his series.\u00a0</p><p>With all this serving as a framing context, lets get into the main topic of this post without much further ado.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Given Dorne is the southern extreme of Westeros, I\u2019ve often found despite its differences from the North, it shares many similarities and thus, many warnings too. Through the connected timeline of AFFC and ADWD, Doran and Jon make political decisions behind the back of the Lannisters and the Night\u2019s Watch respectively risking treason or breaking a solemn oath in order to in fulfil their goals.\u00a0It is striking how similar Doran\u2019s\u00a0plans to enlist Dany\u2019s help through Quentyn and later to do a check up on f!Aegon through Arianne are with Jon sending Val to convince Tormund to bring his people to the Wall as well as using Mel and Dance to save f!Arya. But the connections go even further.\u00a0<br/></p><h2><b>Doran, House Martell and Vengeance for lost family</b></h2><p>The history of House Martell and Dorne with the Targaryen dynasty and their loss of Elia and her children in Robert\u2019s Rebellion due to House Lannister\u00a0becomes increasingly important to Dany\u2019s arc in ADWD. It is something she doesn\u2019t completely realize when refusing Quentyn\u2019s proposal as he doesn\u2019t offer her the swords and ships she desires to conquer Westeros and it is also in part what leads to Quentyn\u2019s death by Dany\u2019s dragons. This political mishap shifts the political dynamics, of course, but more so it also shifts the perspective of Doran\u2019s long coming revenge plot against the Lannisters with the help of Targaryens, which <i>Meereenese Blot</i> has dedicated a number of <a href=\"https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/water-gardens-and-blood-oranges-part-i-the-viper-and-the-grass/\" target=\"_blank\">essays</a> on.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhat is our heart\u2019s desire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVengeance.\u201d His voice was soft, as if he were afraid that someone might be listening. \u201cJustice.\u201d Prince Doran pressed the onyx dragon into her palm with his swollen, gouty fingers, and whispered, \u201c<i>Fire and blood</i>.\u201d - Arianne II, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>Doran\u2019s\u00a0plan to help Dany in her war in conquering back Westeros is fuelled by personal reasons of vengeance against Tywin. But he doesn\u2019t seem to drop this plan even after Tywin is murdered. His desire for vengeance goes much deeper in trying to strip the Lannisters of their legacy, so Tywin couldn\u2019t have left anything behind. At the same time,\u00a0he doesn\u2019t want too much destruction of human life to Dorne in this war knowing the impact of the Sack of King\u2019s Landing that took Elia and her children\u2019s lives. So instead of his own spears, he turns to dragons.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt is an easy thing for a prince to call the spears, but in the end the children pay the price. For their sake, the wise prince will wage no war without good cause, nor any war he cannot hope to win.\u201d - Areo I, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>He doesn\u2019t send for Viserys despite the pact because he wanted him to get an army first that would ensure he was entering a war he could win.\u00a0The Meereenese Blot talks a lot about the thematic criticism of <a href=\"https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2014/03/23/water-gardens-and-blood-oranges-part-iv-it-ends-in-blood/\" target=\"_blank\">vengeance</a> as a motivating factor in Doran\u2019s plan, which definitely fits with the larger themes of the series. Where does that vengeance stop? Ellaria voices this in front of Doran and the Sand Snakes.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Obara bristled. \u201cI never did and never shall.\u201d She gave the skull a mocking kiss. \u201cThis is a start, I\u2019ll grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA start?\u201d said Ellaria Sand, incredulous. \u201cGods forbid. I would it were a finish. Tywin Lannister is dead. So are Robert Baratheon, Amory Lorch, and now Gregor Clegane, all those who had a hand in murdering Elia and her children. Even Joffrey, who was not yet born when Elia died. I saw the boy perish with mine own eyes, clawing at his throat as he tried to draw a breath. <b>Who else is there to kill? Do Myrcella and Tommen need to die so the shades of Rhaenys and Aegon can be at rest?</b> <b>Where does it end?</b>\u201d - Areo I, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>All of their perpetrators are gone. So is this cause just anymore? Doran and the Sand Snakes seem to have channelled their grief into this quest for revenge by killing everyone that wronged them and making them feel what loss truly feels like. But their perpetrators have died either without much of their hand in it or with additional loss of Oberyn. The spectrum of revenge and justice and the pitfalls of mistaking one for the others is a defining theme in Arya\u2019s arc, and going by her journey and Lady Stoneheart\u2019s the reader is pulled back to question if this revenge is more damaging to oneself and others.\u00a0</p><p>Ellaria\u2019s questions can, of course, be stretched to Dany as well. Robert\u2019s Rebellion may have been justified against Aerys but what happened in the Sack of King\u2019s Landing and the attempts on Viserys and Dany\u2019s lives were not. However, her belief in needing to go back to Westeros to\u00a0\u201ctake back what is [hers]\u201d for the sake of her family and the life on the run she was subjected to falls flat because Robert is dead; Tywin is dead; and while he never supported Robert\u2019s and Tywin\u2019s actions in going after mothers and children, Ned is dead too. And beyond that, there is only the fact that Robert\u2019s Rebellion happened not just because Rhaegar abducted Lyanna, but because Aerys wrongfully executed Rickard and Brandon Stark, Jon Arryn\u2019s nephew and heir, bannermen of Hoster Tully, and demanded Jon Arryn to deliver him both Ned and Robert. Beyond those war crimes that Tywin and Robert committed, the rebellion to overthrow the Targaryen dynasty was justified. So what is Dany coming to exact? Where has her impulsive vengeful conquering of Slaver\u2019s Bay led her? She committed a number of war crimes too, no matter how just her cause.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace. Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort. King Quentyn. Why did that sound so silly? Almost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.\u201d - Arianne I, TWOW<br/></p></blockquote><p>The Water Gardens as a symbol of peace stand in stark contrast with Doran and Dany\u2019s larger goals. Its history linked the Targaryens and the Martells in peaceful union and Daenerys I made people realise the beauty and fragility of children. Rhaegar put a dent in that peace when he passed by Elia and crowned Lyanna at the Tourney of Harrenhal and even entered into a war that costed Elia and her children their lives. But the final blow was delivered by Dany\u2019s rejection of Quentyn\u2019s proposal. She does it in part due to her duty to Meereen, but also because she wanted an army and ships, not a marriage alliance and one overlooked fact, because of Quaithe\u2019s warning.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>His friends had lost sight of his true purpose here. The road leads through her, not to her. Daenerys is the means to the prize, not the prize itself. &ldquo; &rsquo;<b>The dragon has three heads</b>,&rsquo; she said to me. &rsquo;<b>My marriage need not be the end of all your hopes,&rsquo; she said.</b> &lsquo;I know why you are here. For fire and blood.&rsquo; <b>I have Targaryen blood in me, you know that</b>. I can trace my lineage back\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck your lineage,&rdquo; said Gerris. &ldquo;The dragons won&rsquo;t care about your blood, except maybe how it tastes.<b> You cannot tame a dragon with a history lesson. They&rsquo;re monsters</b>, not maesters - Daenerys VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>With this rejection two Targaryen siblings have slighted two Martells and caused their deaths inadvertently, where two Targaryen siblings of the past, Daeron II and Daenerys I sealed peace with Dorne by marrying into House Martell.\u00a0Doran is too vengeful to let this slide, especially when he lost Oberyn so recently. Remember that Arianne\u2019s one mistake causes the\u00a0disfigurement of Myrcella\u2019s face and Arys Oakheart\u2019s death and Cersei is already planning for war.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Only if we lost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If? The word is when. <b>Dorne is the least populous of the Seven Kingdoms. </b>It pleased the Young Dragon to make all our armies larger when he wrote that book of his, so as to make his conquest that much more glorious, and it has pleased us to water the seed he planted and let our foes think us more powerful than we are, but a princess ought to know the truth. Valor is a poor substitute for numbers. <b>Dorne cannot hope to win a war against the Iron Throne, not alone</b>. <b>And yet that may well be what you have given us</b>.\u201d \u00a0- The Princess in the Tower, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>And Dany may have doomed herself by baiting Quentyn with the fact that he needn\u2019t marry her and his journey to her for \u201cfire and blood\u201d\u00a0may not be for nothing with the words \u201cthe dragon has three heads\u201d.\u00a0The fact that f!Aegon has landed in the Stormlands with an army, that Doran was waiting on also gives him more of a chance to go against Dany as the Dornish have fought away the dragons before.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Send a raven whenever you have news,&rdquo; Prince Doran told her, &ldquo;but report only what you know to be true. We are lost in fog here, besieged by rumors, falsehoods, and traveler&rsquo;s tales.<b> I dare not act until I know for a certainty what is happening</b>.&rdquo;</p><p><b>War is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be spared. </b>&ldquo;Doom and death are coming,&rdquo; Ellaria Sand had warned them, before she took her own leave from Prince Doran. - Arianne I, TWOW<br/></p></blockquote><p>Ultimately, if Doran\u2019s own plans haven\u2019t already backfired on him, choosing to enter this war for revenge over his lost family will only bring more tragedy to his House and perhaps, the very Water Gardens that he wants to protect.\u00a0</p><p>Apart from the motive that drives Doran\u2019s plan that comes back to bite him, there is the <i>method</i> to consider. Is\u00a0\u201cFire and Blood\u201d a \u201ccleaner method\u201d? Quentyn, Hazzea and the destruction and loss of life at Astapor and the fighting pits of Meereen would say otherwise.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Frog would be glad to put Astapor behind him. The Red City was the closest thing to hell he ever hoped to know.</b> The Yunkai'i had sealed the broken gates to keep the dead and dying inside the city, but the sights that he had seen riding down those red brick streets would haunt Quentyn Martell forever. A river choked with corpses. The priestess in her torn robes, impaled upon a stake and attended by a cloud of glistening green flies. Dying men staggering through the streets, bloody and befouled. Children fighting over half-cooked puppies. The last free king of Astapor, screaming naked in the pit as he was set on by a score of starving dogs.<b> And fires, fires everywhere. He could close his eyes and see them still: flames whirling from brick pyramids larger than any castle he had ever seen</b>, plumes of greasy smoke coiling upward like great black snakes.\u201d - The Windblown, ADWD<br/></p></blockquote><p>That Dany wanted to stop slavery or at least punish slavers for their cruel treatment is admirable, but the method by which she does it destroys cities and shatters the economy without replacing it with something else. Thereby causing harm to the very people she wants to help and bringing the cost of more compromises to hold the peace when she does settle down to rule in Meereen. Her fragile peace is the cost of her impulsive approach, that she doesn\u2019t start to question until after she storms through three cities. Having settled down, she is revealed as an ineffective ruler because of her temperament despite her intentions and this would be what she would be bringing to Westeros as well.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>[&hellip;] when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, &ldquo;Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.&rdquo; - Bran I, ACOK</p></blockquote><h2><b>Jon, the Night\u2019s Watch &amp; Weapons of Defence</b></h2><p>A number of people believe that even if Dany\u2019s conquest may be misguided, her true goal is to go north of the Wall and fight the Others to protect the realm with the help of her dragons, particularly because of that first instance when Jon killed a wight in AGOT with a brand of fire.\u00a0<br/></p><blockquote><p>Truly, the gods had heard Jon&rsquo;s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man&rsquo;s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood. Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames. It was the face that haunted him most; <b>surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw</b>, the <b>dead flesh melting away</b> and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath.<b>Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames</b>; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than<b> cooked meat and charred bone</b>. - Jon VIII, AGOT<br/></p></blockquote><p>And, of course, Jon\u2019s thoughts when the free folk are about to invade the realm:</p><blockquote><p>We should have twenty trebuchets, not two, and they should be mounted on sledges and turntables so we could move them. It was a futile thought. He might as well wish for another thousand men, and <b>maybe a dragon or three</b>. - Jon VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Unlike Doran\u2019s quest for revenge, Jon is trying to mobilise forces and would be willing to use dragons for the defence of the realm. But would it have different results merely because of a less negative intent? So far Jon has actively gone out to seek dragons, but Melisandre claims Stannis is a prophecised prince and he can\u00a0\u201cwake dragons out of stone\u201d.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Burning dead children had ceased to trouble Jon Snow; live ones were another matter. <b>Two kings to wake the dragon</b>. The father first and then the son, so both die kings. The words had been murmured by one of the queen&rsquo;s men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds. Jon had tried to dismiss them as his fever talking. Aemon had demurred. &ldquo;There is power in a king&rsquo;s blood,&rdquo; the old maester had warned, &ldquo;and better men than Stannis have done worse things than this.&rdquo; The king can be harsh and unforgiving, aye,<b> but a babe still on the breast? Only a monster would give a living child to the flames.</b> - Jon I, ASOS<br/></p></blockquote><p>That said, he is skeptical about their entire PR because it involves human sacrifice, even children. But given we do have a character with dragons already and no sacrifice need be involved, he would be more open to seeking out her help.

Sam felt a moment&rsquo;s relief, until he saw the horse. Hoarfrost covered it like a <b>sheen of frozen sweat</b>, and a nest of stiff black entrails dragged from its open belly. <b>On its back was a rider pale as ice</b>. Sam made a whimpery sound deep in his throat. He was so scared he might have pissed himself all over again, but the cold was in him, a cold so savage that his bladder felt frozen solid.<b> The Other slid gracefully from the saddle to stand upon the snow. Sword-slim it was, and milky white.</b> Its armor rippled and shifted as it moved, and its feet did not break the crust of the new-fallen snow. - Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[Othor\u2019s]\u00a0flesh was <b>blanched white as milk</b>, everywhere but his hands. <b>His hands were black like Jafer&rsquo;s</b>.

They stared up at the sky,<b> blue as sapphires</b>. - Jon VII, AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWhen he opened his mouth to scream,<b> the wight jammed its black corpse fingers</b> into Jon&rsquo;s mouth. Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was too heavy. Its hand forced itself farther down his throat,<b> icy cold</b>, choking him. Its face was against his own, filling the world. <b>Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue</b>.\u201d - Jon VII, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Unlike wights, they can snuff out flames.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Get away!&rdquo; Grenn took a step, thrusting the torch out before him. &ldquo;Away, or you burn.&rdquo; He poked at it with the flames.</p><p>The Other&rsquo;s sword gleamed with a faint blue glow. It moved toward Grenn, lightning quick, slashing. When the ice blue blade brushed the flames, a screech stabbed Sam&rsquo;s ears sharp as a needle. The head of the torch tumbled sideways to vanish beneath a deep drift of snow, the fire snuffed out at once. - Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>So is fire really the solution against them?\u00a0</p><h2><b>I. False Dawn</b></h2><p>What does work on the Others, however, is dragonglass that the Jon finds at the Fist of First Men. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnd then he was stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, closing his eyes and shoving the dagger blindly out before him with both hands. He heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when it breaks beneath a man&rsquo;s foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that he went staggering backward with his hands over his muffled ears, and fell hard on his arse. When he opened his eyes the Other&rsquo;s armor was running down its legs in rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass dagger in its throat. It reached down with two bone-white hands to pull out the knife, but where its fingers touched the obsidian they smoked. Sam rolled onto his side, eyes wide as the Other shrank and puddled, dissolving away. In twenty heartbeats its flesh was gone, swirling away in a fine white mist. Beneath were bones like milkglass, pale and shiny, and they were melting too. Finally only the dragonglass dagger remained, wreathed in steam as if it were alive and sweating. Grenn bent to scoop it up and flung it down again at once. &ldquo;Mother, that&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Obsidian.&rdquo; Sam struggled to his knees. &ldquo;Dragonglass, they call it. Dragonglass. Dragon glass.&rdquo; \u00a0- Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>The COTF, who are the species most associated with nature, were said to have employed it themselves instead of swords. Incidentally, dragonglass is called \u201cfrozen fire\u201d, which in many ways seems to be a combination of ice and fire - not fire by itself. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<b>Dragonglass</b>.&rdquo; The red woman&rsquo;s laugh was music. &ldquo;<b>Frozen</b> <b>fire, in the tongue of old Valyria</b>.

People also forget the last Long Night was won without dragons and rather with the help of COTF.</p><p>One could ask why would the author go through the ruse of framing ice and fire in opposition? Perhaps, because they\u2019re both meant to be seen as threats and there\u2019s a lot of blanks left unanswered and the R\u2019hllor cult seems to give them more, whether correct or incorrect, than the COTF, Bloodraven or any Northerner.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMy lord father used to tell me that a man must know his enemies. <b>We understand little of the wights and less about the Others</b>. We need to learn.&ldquo; - Jon III, ADWD\u00a0<br/></p></blockquote><p>It is R\u2019hllorism that frames this dichotomy of one good side and one bad side.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The war?&rdquo; asked Davos.</p><p>&ldquo;The war,&rdquo; she affirmed. &ldquo;There are two, Onion Knight.

The war has been waged since time began, and before it is done, all men must choose where they will stand.<b> On one side is R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror</b>. Ours is not a choice between Baratheon and Lannister, between Greyjoy and Stark. <b>It is death we choose, or life. Darkness, or light.</b>&rdquo; \u00a0- Davos III, ASOS<br/></p></blockquote><p>This is a very black and white view of thinking and considering the tropes of conventional fantasy, readers assume Melisandre is wrong about <i>who</i> Azor Ahai reborn is, but not about what he/she is or what the war is about because we\u2019ve seen the Others; they\u2019re ice zombies and there\u2019s close to nothing to sympathise there. Except isn\u2019t the author\u2019s goal to deal with\u00a0\u201cconflict in the human heart?\u201d How do you deal with that if your greatest antagonist is just non-thinking, out to kill the living? People would faster believe they\u2019re controlled by Bloodraven, which they may or may not be, and he\u2019s the actual enemy. But is that enough?\u00a0</p><p>The talk of Daenerys and her dragons hasn&rsquo;t completely reached the Wall as Aemon and Sam find out about her in Braavos, but before dying Aemon held Sam to oath to research all he can about the prince that was promised prophecy in order to help Daenerys. It won\u2019t be long before Sam writes to Jon about her or more news gets to Jon at the Wall after his resurrection and upon her arrival to Dragonstone, because of the dragonglass also present there he would have double the reason to approach her. However,\u00a0Jon knows about Hardhome and once again it serves as a warning.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night six hundred years ago when hell had swallowed it. Its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, <b>their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north</b>. Afterward <b>ashes rained down on haunted forest</b> and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year. Traders reported finding only <b>nightmarish devastation </b>where Hardhome had stood, a <b>landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses</b>, blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement.\u201d - Jon VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Similar wording is used for the Dragonpit burning atop Rhaenys\u2019 Hill during the Dance of Dragons.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[The]\u00a0queen\u2019s own dragon remained alive and free \u2026 and as the burned and bloody survivors of the carnage in the pit came stumbling from the smoking ruins, Syrax descended upon them from above. <b>A thousand shrieks and shouts echoed across the city, mingling with the dragon\u2019s roar</b>. Atop the Hill of Rhaenys,<b> the Dragonpit wore a crown of yellow fire, burning so bright it seemed as if the sun was rising</b>. Even the queen trembled as she watched, the tears glistening on her cheeks. Many of the queen\u2019s companions on the rooftop fled, fearing that the fires would soon engulf the entire city, even the Red Keep atop Aegon\u2019s High Hill. Others took themselves to the castle sept to pray for deliverance.\u201d - Princess and the Queen<br/></p></blockquote><p>A false dawn, again. The state of Hardhome sounds a bit like that of <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173044283669/when-the-land-is-cursed-catastrophe-and-magical\" target=\"_blank\">Valyria after the Doom and Asshai</a>, which is struck by magical pollution. It was attacked once by fire and in ADWD it was attacked once by ice. Both had devastating effects.\u00a0</p><h2><b>II. Dragons Plant No Trees</b></h2><p>Regarding\u00a0the credibility of the notion of \u201cice = death\u201d and \u201cfire = life\u201d, much of Melisandre and Davos\u2019s arguments on darkness and light shows how the lines blur and one becomes the other. Darkness is shown to cloak and protect and this is most shown through Bran\u2019s chapters as he hides in the crypts and in the cities of the COTF below the ground, even if Bloodraven might be taking advantage of Bran\u2019s innocence. Not to mention there are Saladhor Saan\u2019s words of warning.\u00a0<br/></p><blockquote><p>\u201cBe glad that it is just a burnt sword that His Grace pulled from that fire.<b> Too much light can hurt the eyes, my friend, and fire burns</b>.&ldquo; - Davos I, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Fire in limited amount might help but the idea that dragons as weapons of mass destruction could save humankind seems unlikely to me because they are \u201cfire made flesh\u201d to the Others\u2019 \u201cice made flesh\u201d. If ice can freeze, too much fire can burn. We also get characters like Beric and Lady Stoneheart resurrected through R\u2019hllor\u2019s fire magic and that doesn\u2019t seem like a good thing either. Beric is drained and loses his memories each time he gets back, and Catelyn has lost her humanity. Both of them driven by their last goal before dying, and not much else. Is that truly living? GRRM even calls them \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">wights animated by fire</a>\u201d.\u00a0<br/></p><h2><b>II.A: Deconstruction of the fantasy hero</b></h2><p>Then of course, one is left to wonder if fire wights are not good, what does it say about Jon since Martin also claimed that bookwise, Beric is foreshadowing for Jon being drained after coming back from death. </p><blockquote><p><b>And Jon Snow, too, is drained by the experience of coming back from the dead on the show.<br/></b>GRRM: Right. And poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this, every time he\u2019s a little less Beric. His memories are fading, he\u2019s got all these scars, he\u2019s becoming more and more physically hideous, because he\u2019s not a living human being anymore. His heart isn\u2019t beating, his blood isn\u2019t flowing in his veins, he\u2019s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we\u2019re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing.</p></blockquote><p>Many people assume this means Jon will come back as a fire wight himself. But he does warg into Ghost when he dies, so in a sense his soul is preserved by COTF magic - more than Beric\u2019s at least. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a> has written her own meta on why Jon <a href=\"https://occupyvenus.tumblr.com/post/171202759768/jon-wont-be-a-firewight\" target=\"_blank\">won\u2019t come back as a fire wight</a> because of a mixture of magic used to resurrect him (COTF, fire, blood and shadowbinding) - even if some may not be intended by Melisandre. This would prevent Jon from becoming a complete slave to one element, driven by one thought. He still would be drained, and will come back greyer, darker (as Martin has <a href=\"http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/george-r-r-martin-author-song-ice-and-fire-series-interview-sound-young-america#transcript\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> in comparison to his issues with Gandalf) and probably more wolfish from his time in Ghost after having tried to reject his wolf side; probably even his memories will start to fade.</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>I do think that if you\u2019re bringing a character back, that a character has gone through death, that\u2019s a transformative experience.</b> [&hellip;] My characters who come back from death are<b> worse for wear.</b> In some ways, they\u2019re not even the same characters anymore.

And as I got older and considered it more, it also seemed to me that <b>death doesn\u2019t make you more powerful</b>. That\u2019s, in some ways, me talking to Tolkien in the dialogue, saying, \u2019<b>Yeah, if someone comes back from being dead, especially if they suffer a violent, traumatic death,</b> <b>they\u2019re not going to come back as nice as ever</b>.\u2019 That\u2019s what I was trying to do, and am still trying to do, with the Lady Stoneheart character.\u201d - <a href=\"http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM, TIME interview</a><br/></p></blockquote><p>I have often wondered why he made Jon go through such a plot if he hates resurrection plots so much (<a href=\"https://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/08/14/maybe-stan-lee-is-my-biggest-literary-influence-george-rr-martin/\" target=\"_blank\">a problem he had with Wonderman</a> when he was younger as well, despite being inspired by his complexity). I dubbed this problem the \u201cResurrection Problem\u201d and while thinking on it, I realised Jon wasn&rsquo;t supposed to come back \u201cimproved\u201d as a prophecised hero, but <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173274672792/the-resurrection-problem\" target=\"_blank\">lesser than he was</a>. </p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Death is a pretty serious business.</b> I remember when I was on a TV show in 80s \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u201d and Linda Hamilton was the star and after two seasons she left. It was more dramatic to write her out and bring on a new Beauty [then to end the show].<b> The network supported us in killing her but wanted us to get past it very quickly. We had a big fight with them about it.

He wanted Jon\u2019s death to shake him, traumatise him instead of just making him go into deep sleep and getting up. What he might&rsquo;ve been going for emotionally was Buffy\u2019s resurrection in BtVS that leaves her traumatised, apathetic and resentful towards her friends for pulling her out of heaven to return to the job of trying to save the world. From a hero she turns into an anti hero, and Jon was already getting there from ASOS to ADWD. Buffy\u2019s resurrection was one that was done well because it didn\u2019t brush away the seriousness of death. But like his time on \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d, I guess D&amp;D didn\u2019t want to really spend the remaining episodes/seasons on Jon\u2019s emotional transformation of that complexity, as they skipped it with Beric and skipped Lady Stoneheart altogether. What I do think they kept to is that Jon would be so scarred that he would not want to be brought back a second time, unlike Beric and this might be possible because the mixture of magic that bring him back after his time in Ghost don\u2019t make him fixate on one goal.\u00a0</p><p>One could then ask what was the <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist?from=Main.Watsonian\" target=\"_blank\">Watsonian</a> purpose of Jon being resurrected if he isn\u2019t some prophecised hero or messiah? I think that so much fantasy fiction writes Messianic characters resurrections \u201cfor a reason\u201d that Jon not having that role, and rather affecting the politics more in a way unrelated to it would be subversive.\u00a0I keep revisiting this topic of Jon\u2019s resurrection because I find that it deserves looking at more closely because as <a>@thewesterwoman</a>\u200b has written, Jon is the <a href=\"https://thewesterwoman.tumblr.com/post/164495254493/fantasy-tropes-in-asoiaf-the-lord-of-the-rings\" target=\"_blank\">only candidate</a>, who can answer \u201cWhat was Aragorn\u2019s tax policy?\u201d and this isn\u2019t based on character preference, but looking at which character is best trained in daily governance and is trying to bring about change through policy work. Of course, he can\u2019t do it alone and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173200586467/i-was-writing-a-long-post-on-how-probably-the#notes\" target=\"_blank\">he does need other people\u2019s skills, insights and connections</a> and that\u2019s part of why he died after isolating himself from his friends as Lord Commander and it goes back to the \u201cthe lone wolf dies, but the pack survives\u201d. It stands on the notion that a government shouldn\u2019t be built on the concept of an ideal ruler, but a collaborative government that doesn\u2019t cover for the king, but serves the realm.\u00a0<br/></p><p>One might also ask who would save the day then if not Jon or Dany and if <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173833000269/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">Azor Ahai reborn/PTWP is a <i>destroyer</i></a> rather than a<i> </i>saviour? Somehow everyone forgets Bran and how he\u2019s actually Dany\u2019s equivalent in his potency of magic and visions and he is associated with earth magic and trees.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The godswood.&rdquo; Meera Reed ran after the direwolf, her shield and frog spear to hand. The rest of them trailed after, threading their way through smoke and fallen stones. The air was sweeter under the trees. A few pines along the edge of the wood had been scorched, but deeper in the damp soil and green wood had defeated the flames. &ldquo;There is a power in living wood,&rdquo; said Jojen Reed, almost as if he knew what Bran was thinking, &ldquo;a power strong as fire.&rdquo; - Bran VII, ACOK<br/></p></blockquote><p>The Lost Hero sought out the COTF from their secret cities and Bran the Builder helped build the Wall with the COTF\u2019s help, so perhaps the answer lies with a more \u201cliving\u201d\u00a0element of nature as they are put in opposition to ice and fire. If the Others are related to death, so is Dany called\u00a0\u201cDaughter of Death\u201d in the HOTU, and it does become a trend in hindsight that she leaves a trail of death and instability behind no matter where she goes. In that sense, earth magic that is not a pure magic unlike the Others and Valyrian dragons because the land is a mixture of a number of elements.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be both?\u201d Meera reached up to pinch his nose. </i>&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re different,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Like night and day, or ice and fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>If ice can burn</b>,&rdquo; said Jojen in his solemn voice, &ldquo;<b>then love and hate can mate</b>. <b>Mountain or marsh, it makes no matter. The land is one</b>.&quot;\u00a0- Bran II, ASOS<br/></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168551631589/the-ice-and-the-fire-of-the-song-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">trinuviel</a> has elaborated on this synthesis being a sign of impurity, which is positive in Martin\u2019s world that approaches purity negatively, like the Targaryens marrying their siblings to \u201ckeep the bloodline pure\u201d.\u00a0If the books follow the show about the COTF creating the Others as weapons against the First Men, even then the fact that they are able to separate themselves from the Others, <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172039010439/the-lost-wisdom-of-septon-barth-clues-to-the\" target=\"_blank\">unlike the Valyrians attachment to dragons</a>,\u00a0shows hope. \u00a0</p><h2><b>II.B: A Dragon is not a Slave</b></h2><p>If Jon\u2019s role is more political so would his employment of Dany\u2019s help with dragons. Ironically, within Jon\u2019s chapters itself Tycho Nestoris from the Iron Bank gives Jon a warning when he talks about dragons flippantly. </p><blockquote><p>&quot;Salladhor Saan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Lysene pirate? Some say he has returned to his old haunts, this is so. And Lord Redwyne&rsquo;s war fleet creeps through the Broken Arm as well. On its way home, no doubt. But these men and their ships are well-known to us. No, these other sails \u2026 from farther east, perhaps \u2026 <b>one hears queer talk of dragons</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Would that we had one here. </b>A dragon might warm things up a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My lord jests. You will forgive me if I do not laugh. <b>We Braavosi are descended from those who fled Valyria and the wroth of its dragonlords. We do not jape of dragons</b>.&rdquo; - Jon IX, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Jon doesn\u2019t take this warning very seriously perhaps because he doesn\u2019t expect to run into a dragon any time soon or because the Targaryen dynasty to his mind is a thing of the past and only a topic of songs in Westeros. But when Dany does land in Westeros, he might be more keen and when he does approach Dany for her dragons, army and dragonglass on Dragonstone (which Stannis has already lost to the Tyrells and he may perish in the North), he would be approaching her for utilitarian reasons. Perhaps, he even has to act as Quentyn\u2019s foil and <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/167743010258/amuse-the-queen-in-the-bedchamber\" target=\"_blank\">do what he cannot</a> and even what <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/166934623318/jon-snow-is-playing-cyvasse\" target=\"_blank\">f!Aegon cannot</a>, thinking he has more limitations because he doesn\u2019t know his own parentage - making his goal in the end prove futile.\u00a0Like Doran or perhaps more than him considering he would be meeting Dany during her campaign of conquest, he would probably know there might be a risk. But he\u2019d be willing to take it and try to minimise collateral damage. But the question again is, can dragons truly be controlled? Can nuclear power truly be controlled, if used for selfless reasons? </p><blockquote><p><b>Dragons are the nuclear deterrent, and only Daenerys has them, which in some ways makes her the most powerful person in the world</b>,\u201d Martin said in 2011. \u201cBut is that sufficient? These are the kind of issues I\u2019m trying to explore. The United States right now has the ability to destroy the world with our nuclear arsenal, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can achieve specific geopolitical goals. Power is more subtle than that. <b>You can have the power to destroy, but it doesn\u2019t give you the power to reform, or improve, or build</b>. - <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a></p></blockquote><p>In this event, Jon\u2019s first experience with\u00a0Othor\u2019s wight comes to mind.\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a>\u00a0often says,\u00a0\u201c<i>Jon tries to use fire to fight ice and burns his fingers</i>\u201d as foreshadowing for the future. He didn\u2019t come out of that experience untouched as his sword hand got burnt, and that was just a make shift torch he made on instinct. The impact of seeking out Dany and her dragons and trying to control her impulses will only work to a certain extent, until like Doran, what he is trying to protect burns too.\u00a0Essentially, trying to fight the Others, who represent climate change, with dragons, is like trying to fight them with an atom bomb. It\u2019s playing with fire because not only are dragons unpredictable, Dany is unpredictable.\u00a0</p><p>The theme of home has a huge significance in the story for a number of characters, who are seeking a place to belong. Where Dany is concerned, because she has lived her life on the run and because she has internalised Viserys\u2019 belief that the only place she can feel at home is Westeros in King\u2019s Landing and Dragonstone, that becomes her tragedy as she fails to set up roots anywhere she settles, as she looks West. Dany has no roots and therefore, she uproots people wherever she goes, intentionally or not. Theon seems to share this trend initially as he struggles between wanting to hate the Starks for uprooting him from Pyke and his family as a Greyjoy, but he also loves them and wants to be part of them, but cannot be as a ward. As Martin has said, although in a similar situation as Theon as part of the Starks and yet not part of it, Jon avoids becoming like him and acting on his negative feelings. Sansa, Arya and Bran, who despite their varying reasons of feeling out of place in Winterfell, find themselves longing to go back to it as they realise they had more than they realised. Moreover, the Starks\u2019\u00a0connection to Winterfell is through family and it serves as a tether to hold onto humanity and their identity. For Dany, after losing all her family, she grasps onto her dragon eggs and walks into the funeral pyre to hatch them, and when they do, she considers them her children. That unhealthy attachment to something so disastrous to human life is what ultimately could be the final straw in driving Dany to put them before humanity, as this starts from AGOT itself when she asks for her dragon eggs, rather than Rhaego in between her fevered dreams. That is foreboding in hindsight. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>Under the influence of a dragon rider, dragons can affect far larger masses than on their own.\u00a0Whether wanting to use it on the offensive, like Doran, or on the defensive, like Jon, a dragon still cannot be tamed.\u00a0 The North will not be spared as much as he\u2019d like, as Dorne will not be. There is even foreshadowing for <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/169075626529/are-dragons-going-to-burn-winterfell\" target=\"_blank\">Dany\u2019s dragons burning Winterfell</a> when Summer looks up in the sky during the Sack of Winterfell and considering the line \u201cDragons plant no trees\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Dany\u2019s dragons try to\u00a0<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/166285886062/the-heart-tree-of-winterfell-tolkien-influences\" target=\"_blank\">burn Winterfell\u2019s heart tree</a> to drive the point home. Perhaps because living wood has \u201cpower as strong as fire\u201d, the heart tree and part of the godswood may be spared, but a large part of Winterfell may not.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Interviewer: The number one question people ask me about the series is whether I think everyone will lose\u2014whether it will end in some horrible apocalypse. I know you can\u2019t speak to that specifically, but as a revisionist of epic fantasy\u2014\u2028</p><p>I haven\u2019t written the ending yet, so I don\u2019t know, but no. That\u2019s certainly not my intent. <b>I\u2019ve said before that the tone of the ending that I\u2019m going for is bittersweet.</b> I mean, it\u2019s no secret that Tolkien has been a huge influence on me, and I love the way he ended Lord of the Rings. <b>It ends with victory, but it\u2019s a bittersweet victory. </b>Frodo is never whole again, and he goes away to the Undying Lands, and the other people live their lives. <b>And the scouring of the Shire\u2014brilliant piece of work, which I didn\u2019t understand when I was 13 years old: \u201cWhy is this here? The story\u2019s over?\u201d But every time I read it I understand the brilliance of that segment more and more.</b> All I can say is that\u2019s the kind of tone I will be aiming for. - <a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/08/george-r-r-martins-ending-for-game-of-thrones-will-not-be-as-brutal-as-you-think/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a>\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The author has voiced his love for the Scouring of Shire in LOTR a number of times, and said that is the kind of end he is hoping for. The world isn\u2019t destroyed, but the Hobbits\u2019 world is.\u00a0Winterfell is the most Shire-like place in Westeros, and it has already had the Library Tower burning as part of the attack on Bran, and the Sack of Winterfell. Keeping with <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/175442849800/hi-how-are-you-i-love-your-blog-and-as-you-i\" target=\"_blank\">the pattern of threes</a>\u00a0in significant locations, it may have to burn once more.\u00a0It may be that like the Hobbits, the Starks may save the realm, but may not be able to save their home.\u00a0There would be a kind of symmetry to the Water Gardens and the Glass Gardens being destroyed indirectly because Doran and Jon weaponise dragons for a cause.\u00a0</p><p>This might be Jon\u2019s tragedy as he tries to be the hero (even when he\u2019s too tired to be), tries to protect his homeland and the realm, making sacrifices and playing the game, he\u00a0<i>still </i>fails because he doesn\u2019t have enough context and overestimates his ability to keep Dany in check. It may be that despite his resurrection, he isn\u2019t some promised hero nor is Dany for hatching her dragons after walking into a funeral pyre. Death doesn\u2019t make Jon more powerful, but rather weaker and less of a hero - despite his attempts.\u00a0</p><p>That said, the ending is meant to be bittersweet it may be upon the Starks and their allies to rebuild Westeros from its shambles.\u00a0Perhaps, the irony would be that Jon, who is a hybrid of a dragon and a wolf, would in fact plant trees in contrast to Dany because he has roots connecting him to people and the land, even after it may be destroyed.\u00a0</p>",

Through the connected timeline of AFFC and ADWD, Doran and Jon make political decisions behind the back of the Lannisters and the Night\u2019s Watch respectively risking treason or breaking a solemn oath in order to in fulfil their goals.\u00a0It is striking how similar Doran\u2019s\u00a0plans to enlist Dany\u2019s help through Quentyn and later to do a check up on f!Aegon through Arianne are with Jon sending Val to convince Tormund to bring his people to the Wall as well as using Mel and Dance to save f!Arya. But the connections go even further.\u00a0<br></p><h2><b>Doran, House Martell and Vengeance for lost family</b></h2><p>The history of House Martell and Dorne with the Targaryen dynasty and their loss of Elia and her children in Robert\u2019s Rebellion due to House Lannister\u00a0becomes increasingly important to Dany\u2019s arc in ADWD. It is something she doesn\u2019t completely realize when refusing Quentyn\u2019s proposal as he doesn\u2019t offer her the swords and ships she desires to conquer Westeros and it is also in part what leads to Quentyn\u2019s death by Dany\u2019s dragons. This political mishap shifts the political dynamics, of course, but more so it also shifts the perspective of Doran\u2019s long coming revenge plot against the Lannisters with the help of Targaryens, which <i>Meereenese Blot</i> has dedicated a number of <a href=\"https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/water-gardens-and-blood-oranges-part-i-the-viper-and-the-grass/\" target=\"_blank\">essays</a> on.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhat is our heart\u2019s desire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVengeance.\u201d His voice was soft, as if he were afraid that someone might be listening. \u201cJustice.\u201d Prince Doran pressed the onyx dragon into her palm with his swollen, gouty fingers, and whispered, \u201c<i>Fire and blood</i>.\u201d - Arianne II, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>Doran\u2019s\u00a0plan to help Dany in her war in conquering back Westeros is fuelled by personal reasons of vengeance against Tywin. But he doesn\u2019t seem to drop this plan even after Tywin is murdered. His desire for vengeance goes much deeper in trying to strip the Lannisters of their legacy, so Tywin couldn\u2019t have left anything behind. At the same time,\u00a0he doesn\u2019t want too much destruction of human life to Dorne in this war knowing the impact of the Sack of King\u2019s Landing that took Elia and her children\u2019s lives. So instead of his own spears, he turns to dragons.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt is an easy thing for a prince to call the spears, but in the end the children pay the price. For their sake, the wise prince will wage no war without good cause, nor any war he cannot hope to win.\u201d - Areo I, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>He doesn\u2019t send for Viserys despite the pact because he wanted him to get an army first that would ensure he was entering a war he could win.\u00a0The Meereenese Blot talks a lot about the thematic criticism of <a href=\"https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2014/03/23/water-gardens-and-blood-oranges-part-iv-it-ends-in-blood/\" target=\"_blank\">vengeance</a> as a motivating factor in Doran\u2019s plan, which definitely fits with the larger themes of the series. Where does that vengeance stop? Ellaria voices this in front of Doran and the Sand Snakes.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Obara bristled. \u201cI never did and never shall.\u201d She gave the skull a mocking kiss. \u201cThis is a start, I\u2019ll grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA start?\u201d said Ellaria Sand, incredulous. \u201cGods forbid. I would it were a finish. Tywin Lannister is dead. So are Robert Baratheon, Amory Lorch, and now Gregor Clegane, all those who had a hand in murdering Elia and her children. Even Joffrey, who was not yet born when Elia died. I saw the boy perish with mine own eyes, clawing at his throat as he tried to draw a breath. <b>Who else is there to kill? Do Myrcella and Tommen need to die so the shades of Rhaenys and Aegon can be at rest?</b> <b>Where does it end?</b>\u201d - Areo I, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>All of their perpetrators are gone. So is this cause just anymore? Doran and the Sand Snakes seem to have channelled their grief into this quest for revenge by killing everyone that wronged them and making them feel what loss truly feels like. But their perpetrators have died either without much of their hand in it or with additional loss of Oberyn. The spectrum of revenge and justice and the pitfalls of mistaking one for the others is a defining theme in Arya\u2019s arc, and going by her journey and Lady Stoneheart\u2019s the reader is pulled back to question if this revenge is more damaging to oneself and others.\u00a0</p><p>Ellaria\u2019s questions can, of course, be stretched to Dany as well. Robert\u2019s Rebellion may have been justified against Aerys but what happened in the Sack of King\u2019s Landing and the attempts on Viserys and Dany\u2019s lives were not. However, her belief in needing to go back to Westeros to\u00a0\u201ctake back what is [hers]\u201d for the sake of her family and the life on the run she was subjected to falls flat because Robert is dead; Tywin is dead; and while he never supported Robert\u2019s and Tywin\u2019s actions in going after mothers and children, Ned is dead too. And beyond that, there is only the fact that Robert\u2019s Rebellion happened not just because Rhaegar abducted Lyanna, but because Aerys wrongfully executed Rickard and Brandon Stark, Jon Arryn\u2019s nephew and heir, bannermen of Hoster Tully, and demanded Jon Arryn to deliver him both Ned and Robert. Beyond those war crimes that Tywin and Robert committed, the rebellion to overthrow the Targaryen dynasty was justified. So what is Dany coming to exact? Where has her impulsive vengeful conquering of Slaver\u2019s Bay led her? She committed a number of war crimes too, no matter how just her cause.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace. Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort. King Quentyn. Why did that sound so silly? Almost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.\u201d - Arianne I, TWOW<br></p></blockquote><p>The Water Gardens as a symbol of peace stand in stark contrast with Doran and Dany\u2019s larger goals. Its history linked the Targaryens and the Martells in peaceful union and Daenerys I made people realise the beauty and fragility of children. Rhaegar put a dent in that peace when he passed by Elia and crowned Lyanna at the Tourney of Harrenhal and even entered into a war that costed Elia and her children their lives. But the final blow was delivered by Dany\u2019s rejection of Quentyn\u2019s proposal. She does it in part due to her duty to Meereen, but also because she wanted an army and ships, not a marriage alliance and one overlooked fact, because of Quaithe\u2019s warning.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>His friends had lost sight of his true purpose here. The road leads through her, not to her. Daenerys is the means to the prize, not the prize itself. \u201c \u2019<b>The dragon has three heads</b>,\u2019 she said to me. \u2019<b>My marriage need not be the end of all your hopes,\u2019 she said.</b> \u2018I know why you are here. For fire and blood.\u2019 <b>I have Targaryen blood in me, you know that</b>. I can trace my lineage back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck your lineage,\u201d said Gerris. \u201cThe dragons won\u2019t care about your blood, except maybe how it tastes.<b> You cannot tame a dragon with a history lesson. They\u2019re monsters</b>, not maesters - Daenerys VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>With this rejection two Targaryen siblings have slighted two Martells and caused their deaths inadvertently, where two Targaryen siblings of the past, Daeron II and Daenerys I sealed peace with Dorne by marrying into House Martell.\u00a0Doran is too vengeful to let this slide, especially when he lost Oberyn so recently. Remember that Arianne\u2019s one mistake causes the\u00a0disfigurement of Myrcella\u2019s face and Arys Oakheart\u2019s death and Cersei is already planning for war.</p><blockquote><p>\"Only if we lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf? The word is when. <b>Dorne is the least populous of the Seven Kingdoms. </b>It pleased the Young Dragon to make all our armies larger when he wrote that book of his, so as to make his conquest that much more glorious, and it has pleased us to water the seed he planted and let our foes think us more powerful than we are, but a princess ought to know the truth. Valor is a poor substitute for numbers. <b>Dorne cannot hope to win a war against the Iron Throne, not alone</b>. <b>And yet that may well be what you have given us</b>.\u201d \u00a0- The Princess in the Tower, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>And Dany may have doomed herself by baiting Quentyn with the fact that he needn\u2019t marry her and his journey to her for \u201cfire and blood\u201d\u00a0may not be for nothing with the words \u201cthe dragon has three heads\u201d.\u00a0The fact that f!Aegon has landed in the Stormlands with an army, that Doran was waiting on also gives him more of a chance to go against Dany as the Dornish have fought away the dragons before.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\"Send a raven whenever you have news,\u201d Prince Doran told her, \u201cbut report only what you know to be true. We are lost in fog here, besieged by rumors, falsehoods, and traveler\u2019s tales.<b> I dare not act until I know for a certainty what is happening</b>.\u201d</p><p><b>War is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be spared. </b>\u201cDoom and death are coming,\u201d Ellaria Sand had warned them, before she took her own leave from Prince Doran. - Arianne I, TWOW<br></p></blockquote><p>Ultimately, if Doran\u2019s own plans haven\u2019t already backfired on him, choosing to enter this war for revenge over his lost family will only bring more tragedy to his House and perhaps, the very Water Gardens that he wants to protect.\u00a0</p><p>Apart from the motive that drives Doran\u2019s plan that comes back to bite him, there is the <i>method</i> to consider. Is\u00a0\u201cFire and Blood\u201d a \u201ccleaner method\u201d? Quentyn, Hazzea and the destruction and loss of life at Astapor and the fighting pits of Meereen would say otherwise.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Frog would be glad to put Astapor behind him. The Red City was the closest thing to hell he ever hoped to know.</b> The Yunkai'i had sealed the broken gates to keep the dead and dying inside the city, but the sights that he had seen riding down those red brick streets would haunt Quentyn Martell forever. A river choked with corpses. The priestess in her torn robes, impaled upon a stake and attended by a cloud of glistening green flies. Dying men staggering through the streets, bloody and befouled. Children fighting over half-cooked puppies. The last free king of Astapor, screaming naked in the pit as he was set on by a score of starving dogs.<b> And fires, fires everywhere. He could close his eyes and see them still: flames whirling from brick pyramids larger than any castle he had ever seen</b>, plumes of greasy smoke coiling upward like great black snakes.\u201d - The Windblown, ADWD<br></p></blockquote><p>That Dany wanted to stop slavery or at least punish slavers for their cruel treatment is admirable, but the method by which she does it destroys cities and shatters the economy without replacing it with something else. Thereby causing harm to the very people she wants to help and bringing the cost of more compromises to hold the peace when she does settle down to rule in Meereen. Her fragile peace is the cost of her impulsive approach, that she doesn\u2019t start to question until after she storms through three cities. Having settled down, she is revealed as an ineffective ruler because of her temperament despite her intentions and this would be what she would be bringing to Westeros as well.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>[\u2026] when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, \u201cBlood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.\u201d - Bran I, ACOK</p></blockquote><h2><b>Jon, the Night\u2019s Watch &amp; Weapons of Defence</b></h2><p>A number of people believe that even if Dany\u2019s conquest may be misguided, her true goal is to go north of the Wall and fight the Others to protect the realm with the help of her dragons, particularly because of that first instance when Jon killed a wight in AGOT with a brand of fire.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p>Truly, the gods had heard Jon\u2019s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man\u2019s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood. Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames. It was the face that haunted him most; <b>surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw</b>, the <b>dead flesh melting away</b> and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath.<b>Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames</b>; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than<b> cooked meat and charred bone</b>. - Jon VIII, AGOT<br></p></blockquote><p>And, of course, Jon\u2019s thoughts when the free folk are about to invade the realm:</p><blockquote><p>We should have twenty trebuchets, not two, and they should be mounted on sledges and turntables so we could move them. It was a futile thought. He might as well wish for another thousand men, and <b>maybe a dragon or three</b>. - Jon VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Unlike Doran\u2019s quest for revenge, Jon is trying to mobilise forces and would be willing to use dragons for the defence of the realm. But would it have different results merely because of a less negative intent? So far Jon has actively gone out to seek dragons, but Melisandre claims Stannis is a prophecised prince and he can\u00a0\u201cwake dragons out of stone\u201d.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Burning dead children had ceased to trouble Jon Snow; live ones were another matter. <b>Two kings to wake the dragon</b>. The father first and then the son, so both die kings. The words had been murmured by one of the queen\u2019s men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds. Jon had tried to dismiss them as his fever talking. Aemon had demurred. \u201cThere is power in a king\u2019s blood,\u201d the old maester had warned, \u201cand better men than Stannis have done worse things than this.\u201d The king can be harsh and unforgiving, aye,<b> but a babe still on the breast? Only a monster would give a living child to the flames.</b> - Jon I, ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>That said, he is skeptical about their entire PR because it involves human sacrifice, even children. But given we do have a character with dragons already and no sacrifice need be involved, he would be more open to seeking out her help. But would that still be a good thing?\u00a0</p><p>A point many forget is the Others\u00a0aren\u2019t the same as wights.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe wights had been slow clumsy things, but the Other was light as snow on the wind.\u201d - Samwell I, ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>Wights are dead men are raised and controlled by the Others, and are a different race altogether.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWho goes there?\u201c A horse\u2019s head emerged from the darkness. Sam felt a moment\u2019s relief, until he saw the horse. Hoarfrost covered it like a <b>sheen of frozen sweat</b>, and a nest of stiff black entrails dragged from its open belly. <b>On its back was a rider pale as ice</b>. Sam made a whimpery sound deep in his throat. He was so scared he might have pissed himself all over again, but the cold was in him, a cold so savage that his bladder felt frozen solid.<b> The Other slid gracefully from the saddle to stand upon the snow. Sword-slim it was, and milky white.</b> Its armor rippled and shifted as it moved, and its feet did not break the crust of the new-fallen snow. - Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[Othor\u2019s]\u00a0flesh was <b>blanched white as milk</b>, everywhere but his hands. <b>His hands were black like Jafer\u2019s</b>. Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash, breast and groin and throat. <b>Yet his eyes</b> <b>were still open</b>. They stared up at the sky,<b> blue as sapphires</b>. - Jon VII, AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWhen he opened his mouth to scream,<b> the wight jammed its black corpse fingers</b> into Jon\u2019s mouth. Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was too heavy. Its hand forced itself farther down his throat,<b> icy cold</b>, choking him. Its face was against his own, filling the world. <b>Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue</b>.\u201d - Jon VII, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Unlike wights, they can snuff out flames.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\"Get away!\u201d Grenn took a step, thrusting the torch out before him. \u201cAway, or you burn.\u201d He poked at it with the flames.</p><p>The Other\u2019s sword gleamed with a faint blue glow. It moved toward Grenn, lightning quick, slashing. When the ice blue blade brushed the flames, a screech stabbed Sam\u2019s ears sharp as a needle. The head of the torch tumbled sideways to vanish beneath a deep drift of snow, the fire snuffed out at once. - Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>So is fire really the solution against them?\u00a0</p><h2><b>I. False Dawn</b></h2><p>What does work on the Others, however, is dragonglass that the Jon finds at the Fist of First Men. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnd then he was stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, closing his eyes and shoving the dagger blindly out before him with both hands. He heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when it breaks beneath a man\u2019s foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that he went staggering backward with his hands over his muffled ears, and fell hard on his arse. When he opened his eyes the Other\u2019s armor was running down its legs in rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass dagger in its throat. It reached down with two bone-white hands to pull out the knife, but where its fingers touched the obsidian they smoked. Sam rolled onto his side, eyes wide as the Other shrank and puddled, dissolving away. In twenty heartbeats its flesh was gone, swirling away in a fine white mist. Beneath were bones like milkglass, pale and shiny, and they were melting too. Finally only the dragonglass dagger remained, wreathed in steam as if it were alive and sweating. Grenn bent to scoop it up and flung it down again at once. \u201cMother, that\u2019s cold.\u201d </p><p>\u201cObsidian.\u201d Sam struggled to his knees. \u201cDragonglass, they call it. Dragonglass. Dragon glass.\u201d \u00a0- Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>The COTF, who are the species most associated with nature, were said to have employed it themselves instead of swords. Incidentally, dragonglass is called \u201cfrozen fire\u201d, which in many ways seems to be a combination of ice and fire - not fire by itself. </p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Dragonglass</b>.\u201d The red woman\u2019s laugh was music. \u201c<b>Frozen</b> <b>fire, in the tongue of old Valyria</b>. Small wonder it is anathema to these cold children of the Other.\u201d - Samwell V, ASOS </p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> has elaborated a lot more on this linking it to the COTF and the Last Hero <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168405569689/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and how it could be that the legend of the forging of Lightbringer is the forging of <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172374892064/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">any</a> Valyrian steel sword because it is linked with magic, and how valyrian swords could be used as weapons as well.\u00a0By comparing the North\u2019s Long Night with legends around a similar phenomenon in parts of Essos like Yi-ti or Rhoyne that the answer may lie <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173271319764/the-long-night-myth-and-mystery\" target=\"_blank\">elsewhere</a> and not in fire magic by itself. People also forget the last Long Night was won without dragons and rather with the help of COTF.</p><p>One could ask why would the author go through the ruse of framing ice and fire in opposition? Perhaps, because they\u2019re both meant to be seen as threats and there\u2019s a lot of blanks left unanswered and the R\u2019hllor cult seems to give them more, whether correct or incorrect, than the COTF, Bloodraven or any Northerner.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMy lord father used to tell me that a man must know his enemies. <b>We understand little of the wights and less about the Others</b>. We need to learn.\u201c - Jon III, ADWD\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>It is R\u2019hllorism that frames this dichotomy of one good side and one bad side.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\"The war?\u201d asked Davos.</p><p>\u201cThe war,\u201d she affirmed. \u201cThere are two, Onion Knight. Not seven, not one, not a hundred or a thousand. Two! Do you think I crossed half the world to put yet another vain king on yet another empty throne? The war has been waged since time began, and before it is done, all men must choose where they will stand.<b> On one side is R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror</b>. Ours is not a choice between Baratheon and Lannister, between Greyjoy and Stark. <b>It is death we choose, or life. Darkness, or light.</b>\u201d \u00a0- Davos III, ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>This is a very black and white view of thinking and considering the tropes of conventional fantasy, readers assume Melisandre is wrong about <i>who</i> Azor Ahai reborn is, but not about what he/she is or what the war is about because we\u2019ve seen the Others; they\u2019re ice zombies and there\u2019s close to nothing to sympathise there. Except isn\u2019t the author\u2019s goal to deal with\u00a0\u201cconflict in the human heart?\u201d How do you deal with that if your greatest antagonist is just non-thinking, out to kill the living? People would faster believe they\u2019re controlled by Bloodraven, which they may or may not be, and he\u2019s the actual enemy. But is that enough?\u00a0</p><p>The talk of Daenerys and her dragons hasn\u2019t completely reached the Wall as Aemon and Sam find out about her in Braavos, but before dying Aemon held Sam to oath to research all he can about the prince that was promised prophecy in order to help Daenerys. It won\u2019t be long before Sam writes to Jon about her or more news gets to Jon at the Wall after his resurrection and upon her arrival to Dragonstone, because of the dragonglass also present there he would have double the reason to approach her. However,\u00a0Jon knows about Hardhome and once again it serves as a warning.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night six hundred years ago when hell had swallowed it. Its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, <b>their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north</b>. Afterward <b>ashes rained down on haunted forest</b> and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year. Traders reported finding only <b>nightmarish devastation </b>where Hardhome had stood, a <b>landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses</b>, blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement.\u201d - Jon VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Similar wording is used for the Dragonpit burning atop Rhaenys\u2019 Hill during the Dance of Dragons.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[The]\u00a0queen\u2019s own dragon remained alive and free \u2026 and as the burned and bloody survivors of the carnage in the pit came stumbling from the smoking ruins, Syrax descended upon them from above. <b>A thousand shrieks and shouts echoed across the city, mingling with the dragon\u2019s roar</b>. Atop the Hill of Rhaenys,<b> the Dragonpit wore a crown of yellow fire, burning so bright it seemed as if the sun was rising</b>. Even the queen trembled as she watched, the tears glistening on her cheeks. Many of the queen\u2019s companions on the rooftop fled, fearing that the fires would soon engulf the entire city, even the Red Keep atop Aegon\u2019s High Hill. Others took themselves to the castle sept to pray for deliverance.\u201d - Princess and the Queen<br></p></blockquote><p>A false dawn, again. The state of Hardhome sounds a bit like that of <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173044283669/when-the-land-is-cursed-catastrophe-and-magical\" target=\"_blank\">Valyria after the Doom and Asshai</a>, which is struck by magical pollution. It was attacked once by fire and in ADWD it was attacked once by ice. Both had devastating effects.\u00a0</p><h2><b>II. Dragons Plant No Trees</b></h2><p>Regarding\u00a0the credibility of the notion of \u201cice = death\u201d and \u201cfire = life\u201d, much of Melisandre and Davos\u2019s arguments on darkness and light shows how the lines blur and one becomes the other. Darkness is shown to cloak and protect and this is most shown through Bran\u2019s chapters as he hides in the crypts and in the cities of the COTF below the ground, even if Bloodraven might be taking advantage of Bran\u2019s innocence. Not to mention there are Saladhor Saan\u2019s words of warning.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cBe glad that it is just a burnt sword that His Grace pulled from that fire.<b> Too much light can hurt the eyes, my friend, and fire burns</b>.\u201c - Davos I, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Fire in limited amount might help but the idea that dragons as weapons of mass destruction could save humankind seems unlikely to me because they are \u201cfire made flesh\u201d to the Others\u2019 \u201cice made flesh\u201d. If ice can freeze, too much fire can burn. We also get characters like Beric and Lady Stoneheart resurrected through R\u2019hllor\u2019s fire magic and that doesn\u2019t seem like a good thing either. Beric is drained and loses his memories each time he gets back, and Catelyn has lost her humanity. Both of them driven by their last goal before dying, and not much else. Is that truly living? GRRM even calls them \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">wights animated by fire</a>\u201d.\u00a0<br></p><h2><b>II.A: Deconstruction of the fantasy hero</b></h2><p>Then of course, one is left to wonder if fire wights are not good, what does it say about Jon since Martin also claimed that bookwise, Beric is foreshadowing for Jon being drained after coming back from death. </p><blockquote><p><b>And Jon Snow, too, is drained by the experience of coming back from the dead on the show.<br></b>GRRM: Right. And poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this, every time he\u2019s a little less Beric. His memories are fading, he\u2019s got all these scars, he\u2019s becoming more and more physically hideous, because he\u2019s not a living human being anymore. His heart isn\u2019t beating, his blood isn\u2019t flowing in his veins, he\u2019s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we\u2019re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing.</p></blockquote><p>Many people assume this means Jon will come back as a fire wight himself. But he does warg into Ghost when he dies, so in a sense his soul is preserved by COTF magic - more than Beric\u2019s at least. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a> has written her own meta on why Jon <a href=\"https://occupyvenus.tumblr.com/post/171202759768/jon-wont-be-a-firewight\" target=\"_blank\">won\u2019t come back as a fire wight</a> because of a mixture of magic used to resurrect him (COTF, fire, blood and shadowbinding) - even if some may not be intended by Melisandre. This would prevent Jon from becoming a complete slave to one element, driven by one thought. He still would be drained, and will come back greyer, darker (as Martin has <a href=\"http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/george-r-r-martin-author-song-ice-and-fire-series-interview-sound-young-america#transcript\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> in comparison to his issues with Gandalf) and probably more wolfish from his time in Ghost after having tried to reject his wolf side; probably even his memories will start to fade.</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>I do think that if you\u2019re bringing a character back, that a character has gone through death, that\u2019s a transformative experience.</b> [\u2026] My characters who come back from death are<b> worse for wear.</b> In some ways, they\u2019re not even the same characters anymore.

And as I got older and considered it more, it also seemed to me that <b>death doesn\u2019t make you more powerful</b>. That\u2019s, in some ways, me talking to Tolkien in the dialogue, saying, \u2019<b>Yeah, if someone comes back from being dead, especially if they suffer a violent, traumatic death,</b> <b>they\u2019re not going to come back as nice as ever</b>.\u2019 That\u2019s what I was trying to do, and am still trying to do, with the Lady Stoneheart character.\u201d - <a href=\"http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM, TIME interview</a><br></p></blockquote><p>I have often wondered why he made Jon go through such a plot if he hates resurrection plots so much (<a href=\"https://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/08/14/maybe-stan-lee-is-my-biggest-literary-influence-george-rr-martin/\" target=\"_blank\">a problem he had with Wonderman</a> when he was younger as well, despite being inspired by his complexity). I dubbed this problem the \u201cResurrection Problem\u201d and while thinking on it, I realised Jon wasn\u2019t supposed to come back \u201cimproved\u201d as a prophecised hero, but <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173274672792/the-resurrection-problem\" target=\"_blank\">lesser than he was</a>. </p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Death is a pretty serious business.</b> I remember when I was on a TV show in 80s \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u201d and Linda Hamilton was the star and after two seasons she left.

He wanted Jon\u2019s death to shake him, traumatise him instead of just making him go into deep sleep and getting up. What he might\u2019ve been going for emotionally was Buffy\u2019s resurrection in BtVS that leaves her traumatised, apathetic and resentful towards her friends for pulling her out of heaven to return to the job of trying to save the world. From a hero she turns into an anti hero, and Jon was already getting there from ASOS to ADWD. Buffy\u2019s resurrection was one that was done well because it didn\u2019t brush away the seriousness of death. But like his time on \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d, I guess D&amp;D didn\u2019t want to really spend the remaining episodes/seasons on Jon\u2019s emotional transformation of that complexity, as they skipped it with Beric and skipped Lady Stoneheart altogether. What I do think they kept to is that Jon would be so scarred that he would not want to be brought back a second time, unlike Beric and this might be possible because the mixture of magic that bring him back after his time in Ghost don\u2019t make him fixate on one goal.\u00a0</p><p>One could then ask what was the <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist?from=Main.Watsonian\" target=\"_blank\">Watsonian</a> purpose of Jon being resurrected if he isn\u2019t some prophecised hero or messiah? I think that so much fantasy fiction writes Messianic characters resurrections \u201cfor a reason\u201d that Jon not having that role, and rather affecting the politics more in a way unrelated to it would be subversive.\u00a0I keep revisiting this topic of Jon\u2019s resurrection because I find that it deserves looking at more closely because as <a>@thewesterwoman</a>\u200b has written, Jon is the <a href=\"https://thewesterwoman.tumblr.com/post/164495254493/fantasy-tropes-in-asoiaf-the-lord-of-the-rings\" target=\"_blank\">only candidate</a>, who can answer \u201cWhat was Aragorn\u2019s tax policy?\u201d and this isn\u2019t based on character preference, but looking at which character is best trained in daily governance and is trying to bring about change through policy work. Of course, he can\u2019t do it alone and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173200586467/i-was-writing-a-long-post-on-how-probably-the#notes\" target=\"_blank\">he does need other people\u2019s skills, insights and connections</a> and that\u2019s part of why he died after isolating himself from his friends as Lord Commander and it goes back to the \u201cthe lone wolf dies, but the pack survives\u201d. It stands on the notion that a government shouldn\u2019t be built on the concept of an ideal ruler, but a collaborative government that doesn\u2019t cover for the king, but serves the realm.\u00a0<br></p><p>One might also ask who would save the day then if not Jon or Dany and if <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173833000269/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">Azor Ahai reborn/PTWP is a <i>destroyer</i></a> rather than a<i> </i>saviour? Somehow everyone forgets Bran and how he\u2019s actually Dany\u2019s equivalent in his potency of magic and visions and he is associated with earth magic and trees.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\"The godswood.\u201d Meera Reed ran after the direwolf, her shield and frog spear to hand.

If the Others are related to death, so is Dany called\u00a0\u201cDaughter of Death\u201d in the HOTU, and it does become a trend in hindsight that she leaves a trail of death and instability behind no matter where she goes. In that sense, earth magic that is not a pure magic unlike the Others and Valyrian dragons because the land is a mixture of a number of elements.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be both?\u201d Meera reached up to pinch his nose. </i>\u201cBecause they\u2019re different,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLike night and day, or ice and fire.\u201d \u201c<b>If ice can burn</b>,\u201d said Jojen in his solemn voice, \u201c<b>then love and hate can mate</b>. <b>Mountain or marsh, it makes no matter.

Ironically, within Jon\u2019s chapters itself Tycho Nestoris from the Iron Bank gives Jon a warning when he talks about dragons flippantly. </p><blockquote><p>\"Salladhor Saan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lysene pirate? Some say he has returned to his old haunts, this is so. And Lord Redwyne\u2019s war fleet creeps through the Broken Arm as well. On its way home, no doubt. But these men and their ships are well-known to us. No, these other sails \u2026 from farther east, perhaps \u2026 <b>one hears queer talk of dragons</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>Would that we had one here. </b>A dragon might warm things up a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord jests. You will forgive me if I do not laugh. <b>We Braavosi are descended from those who fled Valyria and the wroth of its dragonlords. We do not jape of dragons</b>.\u201d - Jon IX, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Jon doesn\u2019t take this warning very seriously perhaps because he doesn\u2019t expect to run into a dragon any time soon or because the Targaryen dynasty to his mind is a thing of the past and only a topic of songs in Westeros. But when Dany does land in Westeros, he might be more keen and when he does approach Dany for her dragons, army and dragonglass on Dragonstone (which Stannis has already lost to the Tyrells and he may perish in the North), he would be approaching her for utilitarian reasons. Perhaps, he even has to act as Quentyn\u2019s foil and <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/167743010258/amuse-the-queen-in-the-bedchamber\" target=\"_blank\">do what he cannot</a> and even what <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/166934623318/jon-snow-is-playing-cyvasse\" target=\"_blank\">f!Aegon cannot</a>, thinking he has more limitations because he doesn\u2019t know his own parentage - making his goal in the end prove futile.\u00a0Like Doran or perhaps more than him considering he would be meeting Dany during her campaign of conquest, he would probably know there might be a risk. But he\u2019d be willing to take it and try to minimise collateral damage. But the question again is, can dragons truly be controlled? Can nuclear power truly be controlled, if used for selfless reasons? </p><blockquote><p><b>Dragons are the nuclear deterrent, and only Daenerys has them, which in some ways makes her the most powerful person in the world</b>,\u201d Martin said in 2011. \u201cBut is that sufficient? These are the kind of issues I\u2019m trying to explore. The United States right now has the ability to destroy the world with our nuclear arsenal, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can achieve specific geopolitical goals. Power is more subtle than that. <b>You can have the power to destroy, but it doesn\u2019t give you the power to reform, or improve, or build</b>. - <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a></p></blockquote><p>In this event, Jon\u2019s first experience with\u00a0Othor\u2019s wight comes to mind.\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a>\u00a0often says,\u00a0\u201c<i>Jon tries to use fire to fight ice and burns his fingers</i>\u201d as foreshadowing for the future. He didn\u2019t come out of that experience untouched as his sword hand got burnt, and that was just a make shift torch he made on instinct. The impact of seeking out Dany and her dragons and trying to control her impulses will only work to a certain extent, until like Doran, what he is trying to protect burns too.\u00a0Essentially, trying to fight the Others, who represent climate change, with dragons, is like trying to fight them with an atom bomb. It\u2019s playing with fire because not only are dragons unpredictable, Dany is unpredictable.\u00a0</p><p>The theme of home has a huge significance in the story for a number of characters, who are seeking a place to belong. Where Dany is concerned, because she has lived her life on the run and because she has internalised Viserys\u2019 belief that the only place she can feel at home is Westeros in King\u2019s Landing and Dragonstone, that becomes her tragedy as she fails to set up roots anywhere she settles, as she looks West. Dany has no roots and therefore, she uproots people wherever she goes, intentionally or not. Theon seems to share this trend initially as he struggles between wanting to hate the Starks for uprooting him from Pyke and his family as a Greyjoy, but he also loves them and wants to be part of them, but cannot be as a ward. As Martin has said, although in a similar situation as Theon as part of the Starks and yet not part of it, Jon avoids becoming like him and acting on his negative feelings. Sansa, Arya and Bran, who despite their varying reasons of feeling out of place in Winterfell, find themselves longing to go back to it as they realise they had more than they realised. Moreover, the Starks\u2019\u00a0connection to Winterfell is through family and it serves as a tether to hold onto humanity and their identity. For Dany, after losing all her family, she grasps onto her dragon eggs and walks into the funeral pyre to hatch them, and when they do, she considers them her children. That unhealthy attachment to something so disastrous to human life is what ultimately could be the final straw in driving Dany to put them before humanity, as this starts from AGOT itself when she asks for her dragon eggs, rather than Rhaego in between her fevered dreams. That is foreboding in hindsight. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>Under the influence of a dragon rider, dragons can affect far larger masses than on their own.\u00a0Whether wanting to use it on the offensive, like Doran, or on the defensive, like Jon, a dragon still cannot be tamed.\u00a0 The North will not be spared as much as he\u2019d like, as Dorne will not be. There is even foreshadowing for <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/169075626529/are-dragons-going-to-burn-winterfell\" target=\"_blank\">Dany\u2019s dragons burning Winterfell</a> when Summer looks up in the sky during the Sack of Winterfell and considering the line \u201cDragons plant no trees\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Dany\u2019s dragons try to\u00a0<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/166285886062/the-heart-tree-of-winterfell-tolkien-influences\" target=\"_blank\">burn Winterfell\u2019s heart tree</a> to drive the point home. Perhaps because living wood has \u201cpower as strong as fire\u201d, the heart tree and part of the godswood may be spared, but a large part of Winterfell may not.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Interviewer: The number one question people ask me about the series is whether I think everyone will lose\u2014whether it will end in some horrible apocalypse. I know you can\u2019t speak to that specifically, but as a revisionist of epic fantasy\u2014\u2028</p><p>I haven\u2019t written the ending yet, so I don\u2019t know, but no. That\u2019s certainly not my intent. <b>I\u2019ve said before that the tone of the ending that I\u2019m going for is bittersweet.</b> I mean, it\u2019s no secret that Tolkien has been a huge influence on me, and I love the way he ended Lord of the Rings. <b>It ends with victory, but it\u2019s a bittersweet victory. </b>Frodo is never whole again, and he goes away to the Undying Lands, and the other people live their lives. <b>And the scouring of the Shire\u2014brilliant piece of work, which I didn\u2019t understand when I was 13 years old: \u201cWhy is this here? The story\u2019s over?\u201d But every time I read it I understand the brilliance of that segment more and more.</b> All I can say is that\u2019s the kind of tone I will be aiming for. - <a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/08/george-r-r-martins-ending-for-game-of-thrones-will-not-be-as-brutal-as-you-think/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a>\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The author has voiced his love for the Scouring of Shire in LOTR a number of times, and said that is the kind of end he is hoping for. The world isn\u2019t destroyed, but the Hobbits\u2019 world is.\u00a0Winterfell is the most Shire-like place in Westeros, and it has already had the Library Tower burning as part of the attack on Bran, and the Sack of Winterfell. Keeping with <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/175442849800/hi-how-are-you-i-love-your-blog-and-as-you-i\" target=\"_blank\">the pattern of threes</a>\u00a0in significant locations, it may have to burn once more.\u00a0It may be that like the Hobbits, the Starks may save the realm, but may not be able to save their home.\u00a0There would be a kind of symmetry to the Water Gardens and the Glass Gardens being destroyed indirectly because Doran and Jon weaponise dragons for a cause.\u00a0</p><p>This might be Jon\u2019s tragedy as he tries to be the hero (even when he\u2019s too tired to be), tries to protect his homeland and the realm, making sacrifices and playing the game, he\u00a0<i>still </i>fails because he doesn\u2019t have enough context and overestimates his ability to keep Dany in check. It may be that despite his resurrection, he isn\u2019t some promised hero nor is Dany for hatching her dragons after walking into a funeral pyre. Death doesn\u2019t make Jon more powerful, but rather weaker and less of a hero - despite his attempts.\u00a0</p><p>That said, the ending is meant to be bittersweet it may be upon the Starks and their allies to rebuild Westeros from its shambles.\u00a0Perhaps, the irony would be that Jon, who is a hybrid of a dragon and a wolf, would in fact plant trees in contrast to Dany because he has roots connecting him to people and the land, even after it may be destroyed.\u00a0</p>",

People generally assume this means inverting the enemy from the Others to the dragons, and I\u2019ve made <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/166317300627/fantasy-antagonists-of-asoiaf-who-are-the-orcs-in#notes\" target=\"_blank\">that mistake too</a> momentarily, but it seems more probable that <i>both</i> extreme fire and extreme ice <a href=\"https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/135888-the-long-night-and-the-great-summer/\" target=\"_blank\">can be harmful</a> to Westeros. There is of course, the apocalyptic implications of the two extremes in Robert Frost\u2019s poem <i><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice\" target=\"_blank\">Fire &amp; Ice</a></i>, that Martin <a href=\"http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html\" target=\"_blank\">admits</a> to have influenced his title, but apart from that the author may have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=273&amp;v=GaPZGDlm2F4\" target=\"_blank\">hinted</a> the Others and Dany\u2019s dragons being two apocalyptic threats to Westeros.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>[\u2026]\u00a0<b>the two outlying ones \u2014 the things going on north of the Wall, and then there is Targaryen on the other continent with her dragons \u2014 are of course the ice and fire of the title, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d</b> The central stuff \u2014 the stuff that\u2019s happening in the middle, in King\u2019s Landing, the capital of the seven kingdoms \u2014 is much more based on historical events, historical fiction. It\u2019s loosely drawn from the Wars of the Roses and some of the other conflicts around the 100 Years\u2019 War, although, of course, with a fantasy twist. You know, one of the dynamics I started with, there was the sense of people being so consumed by their petty struggles for power within the seven kingdoms, within King\u2019s Landing that <b>they\u2019re blind to the much greater and more dangerous threats that are happening far away on the periphery of their kingdoms.</b><br></p></blockquote><p>People tend to assume that in this equation, Dany is the political threat to Westeros corruption, but considering GRRM has equated <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">dragons to nuclear power</a>, a destructive force rather than a constructive one (\u201dDragons plant no trees\u201d), this may as well embody the theme of Robert Frost\u2019s <i>Fire &amp; Ice. </i>Both can be<i>\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168471722944/the-ice-and-the-fire-of-the-song-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">equally destructive</a> to human life.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Fire is a cruel way to die</b>. Dalla died to give this child life, but you have nourished him, cherished him. <b>You saved your own boy from the ice. Now save hers from the fire.</b>\u201d \u2014Jon II, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Of course, a number of characters see the return of dragons as a boon with the interpretations of prophecies like Azor Ahai reborn, the Prince That Was Promised, and the presence of Others and the susceptibility of wights to fire and Jon wishing for dragons as weapons of defence at the Wall. That said,\u00a0\u201cProphecy is a sword without a hilt\u201d, and what may seem like a boon may <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">actually be a nightmare</a>. This is a device that has been used by authors like Tolkien in <i><a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/175569556368/the-azor-ahaismaug-connection\" target=\"_blank\">The Hobbit</a></i>\u00a0regarding the Esgaroth prophecy and Tad Williams in<i> <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172113783619/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">Memory, Sorrow, Thorn</a>\u00a0</i>regarding the three<i>\u00a0</i>magical swords from the title and the prophecy about Paris upon his birth from <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/174047973477/trojan-war-literature-influence-on-grrm\" target=\"_blank\">Trojan War cycle</a><i>,</i> <a href=\"https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/08/george-r-r-martin-i-revere-the-lord-of-the-rings/\" target=\"_blank\">all of</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/17/tropes-trolls-and-trump-meet-one-of-george-rr-martins-favourite-fantasy-writers-tad-williams\" target=\"_blank\">whom</a> Martin has admitted to draw inspiration from in his series.\u00a0</p><p>With all this serving as a framing context, lets get into the main topic of this post without much further ado.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Given Dorne is the southern extreme of Westeros, I\u2019ve often found despite its differences from the North, it shares many similarities and thus, many warnings too. Through the connected timeline of AFFC and ADWD, Doran and Jon make political decisions behind the back of the Lannisters and the Night\u2019s Watch respectively risking treason or breaking a solemn oath in order to in fulfil their goals.\u00a0It is striking how similar Doran\u2019s\u00a0plans to enlist Dany\u2019s help through Quentyn and later to do a check up on f!Aegon through Arianne are with Jon sending Val to convince Tormund to bring his people to the Wall as well as using Mel and Dance to save f!Arya. But the connections go even further.\u00a0<br></p><h2><b>Doran, House Martell and Vengeance for lost family</b></h2><p>The history of House Martell and Dorne with the Targaryen dynasty and their loss of Elia and her children in Robert\u2019s Rebellion due to House Lannister\u00a0becomes increasingly important to Dany\u2019s arc in ADWD. It is something she doesn\u2019t completely realize when refusing Quentyn\u2019s proposal as he doesn\u2019t offer her the swords and ships she desires to conquer Westeros and it is also in part what leads to Quentyn\u2019s death by Dany\u2019s dragons. This political mishap shifts the political dynamics, of course, but more so it also shifts the perspective of Doran\u2019s long coming revenge plot against the Lannisters with the help of Targaryens, which <i>Meereenese Blot</i> has dedicated a number of <a href=\"https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/water-gardens-and-blood-oranges-part-i-the-viper-and-the-grass/\" target=\"_blank\">essays</a> on.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhat is our heart\u2019s desire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVengeance.\u201d His voice was soft, as if he were afraid that someone might be listening. \u201cJustice.\u201d Prince Doran pressed the onyx dragon into her palm with his swollen, gouty fingers, and whispered, \u201c<i>Fire and blood</i>.\u201d - Arianne II, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>Doran\u2019s\u00a0plan to help Dany in her war in conquering back Westeros is fuelled by personal reasons of vengeance against Tywin. But he doesn\u2019t seem to drop this plan even after Tywin is murdered. His desire for vengeance goes much deeper in trying to strip the Lannisters of their legacy, so Tywin couldn\u2019t have left anything behind. At the same time,\u00a0he doesn\u2019t want too much destruction of human life to Dorne in this war knowing the impact of the Sack of King\u2019s Landing that took Elia and her children\u2019s lives. So instead of his own spears, he turns to dragons.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt is an easy thing for a prince to call the spears, but in the end the children pay the price. For their sake, the wise prince will wage no war without good cause, nor any war he cannot hope to win.\u201d - Areo I, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>He doesn\u2019t send for Viserys despite the pact because he wanted him to get an army first that would ensure he was entering a war he could win.\u00a0The Meereenese Blot talks a lot about the thematic criticism of <a href=\"https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2014/03/23/water-gardens-and-blood-oranges-part-iv-it-ends-in-blood/\" target=\"_blank\">vengeance</a> as a motivating factor in Doran\u2019s plan, which definitely fits with the larger themes of the series. Where does that vengeance stop? Ellaria voices this in front of Doran and the Sand Snakes.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Obara bristled. \u201cI never did and never shall.\u201d She gave the skull a mocking kiss. \u201cThis is a start, I\u2019ll grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA start?\u201d said Ellaria Sand, incredulous. \u201cGods forbid. I would it were a finish. Tywin Lannister is dead. So are Robert Baratheon, Amory Lorch, and now Gregor Clegane, all those who had a hand in murdering Elia and her children. Even Joffrey, who was not yet born when Elia died. I saw the boy perish with mine own eyes, clawing at his throat as he tried to draw a breath. <b>Who else is there to kill? Do Myrcella and Tommen need to die so the shades of Rhaenys and Aegon can be at rest?</b> <b>Where does it end?</b>\u201d - Areo I, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>All of their perpetrators are gone. So is this cause just anymore? Doran and the Sand Snakes seem to have channelled their grief into this quest for revenge by killing everyone that wronged them and making them feel what loss truly feels like. But their perpetrators have died either without much of their hand in it or with additional loss of Oberyn. The spectrum of revenge and justice and the pitfalls of mistaking one for the others is a defining theme in Arya\u2019s arc, and going by her journey and Lady Stoneheart\u2019s the reader is pulled back to question if this revenge is more damaging to oneself and others.\u00a0</p><p>Ellaria\u2019s questions can, of course, be stretched to Dany as well. Robert\u2019s Rebellion may have been justified against Aerys but what happened in the Sack of King\u2019s Landing and the attempts on Viserys and Dany\u2019s lives were not. However, her belief in needing to go back to Westeros to\u00a0\u201ctake back what is [hers]\u201d for the sake of her family and the life on the run she was subjected to falls flat because Robert is dead; Tywin is dead; and while he never supported Robert\u2019s and Tywin\u2019s actions in going after mothers and children, Ned is dead too. And beyond that, there is only the fact that Robert\u2019s Rebellion happened not just because Rhaegar abducted Lyanna, but because Aerys wrongfully executed Rickard and Brandon Stark, Jon Arryn\u2019s nephew and heir, bannermen of Hoster Tully, and demanded Jon Arryn to deliver him both Ned and Robert. Beyond those war crimes that Tywin and Robert committed, the rebellion to overthrow the Targaryen dynasty was justified. So what is Dany coming to exact? Where has her impulsive vengeful conquering of Slaver\u2019s Bay led her? She committed a number of war crimes too, no matter how just her cause.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace. Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort. King Quentyn. Why did that sound so silly? Almost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.\u201d - Arianne I, TWOW<br></p></blockquote><p>The Water Gardens as a symbol of peace stand in stark contrast with Doran and Dany\u2019s larger goals. Its history linked the Targaryens and the Martells in peaceful union and Daenerys I made people realise the beauty and fragility of children. Rhaegar put a dent in that peace when he passed by Elia and crowned Lyanna at the Tourney of Harrenhal and even entered into a war that costed Elia and her children their lives. But the final blow was delivered by Dany\u2019s rejection of Quentyn\u2019s proposal. She does it in part due to her duty to Meereen, but also because she wanted an army and ships, not a marriage alliance and one overlooked fact, because of Quaithe\u2019s warning.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>His friends had lost sight of his true purpose here. The road leads through her, not to her. Daenerys is the means to the prize, not the prize itself. \u201c \u2019<b>The dragon has three heads</b>,\u2019 she said to me. \u2019<b>My marriage need not be the end of all your hopes,\u2019 she said.</b> \u2018I know why you are here. For fire and blood.\u2019 <b>I have Targaryen blood in me, you know that</b>.

They\u2019re monsters</b>, not maesters - Daenerys VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>With this rejection two Targaryen siblings have slighted two Martells and caused their deaths inadvertently, where two Targaryen siblings of the past, Daeron II and Daenerys I sealed peace with Dorne by marrying into House Martell.\u00a0Doran is too vengeful to let this slide, especially when he lost Oberyn so recently. Remember that Arianne\u2019s one mistake causes the\u00a0disfigurement of Myrcella\u2019s face and Arys Oakheart\u2019s death and Cersei is already planning for war.</p><blockquote><p>\"Only if we lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf? The word is when. <b>Dorne is the least populous of the Seven Kingdoms. </b>It pleased the Young Dragon to make all our armies larger when he wrote that book of his, so as to make his conquest that much more glorious, and it has pleased us to water the seed he planted and let our foes think us more powerful than we are, but a princess ought to know the truth. Valor is a poor substitute for numbers. <b>Dorne cannot hope to win a war against the Iron Throne, not alone</b>. <b>And yet that may well be what you have given us</b>.\u201d \u00a0- The Princess in the Tower, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>And Dany may have doomed herself by baiting Quentyn with the fact that he needn\u2019t marry her and his journey to her for \u201cfire and blood\u201d\u00a0may not be for nothing with the words \u201cthe dragon has three heads\u201d.\u00a0The fact that f!Aegon has landed in the Stormlands with an army, that Doran was waiting on also gives him more of a chance to go against Dany as the Dornish have fought away the dragons before.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\"Send a raven whenever you have news,\u201d Prince Doran told her, \u201cbut report only what you know to be true. We are lost in fog here, besieged by rumors, falsehoods, and traveler\u2019s tales.<b> I dare not act until I know for a certainty what is happening</b>.\u201d</p><p><b>War is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be spared. </b>\u201cDoom and death are coming,\u201d Ellaria Sand had warned them, before she took her own leave from Prince Doran. - Arianne I, TWOW<br></p></blockquote><p>Ultimately, if Doran\u2019s own plans haven\u2019t already backfired on him, choosing to enter this war for revenge over his lost family will only bring more tragedy to his House and perhaps, the very Water Gardens that he wants to protect.\u00a0</p><p>Apart from the motive that drives Doran\u2019s plan that comes back to bite him, there is the <i>method</i> to consider. Is\u00a0\u201cFire and Blood\u201d a \u201ccleaner method\u201d? Quentyn, Hazzea and the destruction and loss of life at Astapor and the fighting pits of Meereen would say otherwise.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Frog would be glad to put Astapor behind him. The Red City was the closest thing to hell he ever hoped to know.</b> The Yunkai'i had sealed the broken gates to keep the dead and dying inside the city, but the sights that he had seen riding down those red brick streets would haunt Quentyn Martell forever. A river choked with corpses. The priestess in her torn robes, impaled upon a stake and attended by a cloud of glistening green flies. Dying men staggering through the streets, bloody and befouled. Children fighting over half-cooked puppies. The last free king of Astapor, screaming naked in the pit as he was set on by a score of starving dogs.<b> And fires, fires everywhere. He could close his eyes and see them still: flames whirling from brick pyramids larger than any castle he had ever seen</b>, plumes of greasy smoke coiling upward like great black snakes.\u201d - The Windblown, ADWD<br></p></blockquote><p>That Dany wanted to stop slavery or at least punish slavers for their cruel treatment is admirable, but the method by which she does it destroys cities and shatters the economy without replacing it with something else. Thereby causing harm to the very people she wants to help and bringing the cost of more compromises to hold the peace when she does settle down to rule in Meereen. Her fragile peace is the cost of her impulsive approach, that she doesn\u2019t start to question until after she storms through three cities. Having settled down, she is revealed as an ineffective ruler because of her temperament despite her intentions and this would be what she would be bringing to Westeros as well.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>[\u2026] when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, \u201cBlood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.\u201d - Bran I, ACOK</p></blockquote><h2><b>Jon, the Night\u2019s Watch &amp; Weapons of Defence</b></h2><p>A number of people believe that even if Dany\u2019s conquest may be misguided, her true goal is to go north of the Wall and fight the Others to protect the realm with the help of her dragons, particularly because of that first instance when Jon killed a wight in AGOT with a brand of fire.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p>Truly, the gods had heard Jon\u2019s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man\u2019s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood. Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames. It was the face that haunted him most; <b>surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw</b>, the <b>dead flesh melting away</b> and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath.<b>Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames</b>; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than<b> cooked meat and charred bone</b>. - Jon VIII, AGOT<br></p></blockquote><p>And, of course, Jon\u2019s thoughts when the free folk are about to invade the realm:</p><blockquote><p>We should have twenty trebuchets, not two, and they should be mounted on sledges and turntables so we could move them. It was a futile thought. He might as well wish for another thousand men, and <b>maybe a dragon or three</b>. - Jon VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Unlike Doran\u2019s quest for revenge, Jon is trying to mobilise forces and would be willing to use dragons for the defence of the realm. But would it have different results merely because of a less negative intent? So far Jon has actively gone out to seek dragons, but Melisandre claims Stannis is a prophecised prince and he can\u00a0\u201cwake dragons out of stone\u201d.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Burning dead children had ceased to trouble Jon Snow; live ones were another matter. <b>Two kings to wake the dragon</b>. The father first and then the son, so both die kings. The words had been murmured by one of the queen\u2019s men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds. Jon had tried to dismiss them as his fever talking. Aemon had demurred. \u201cThere is power in a king\u2019s blood,\u201d the old maester had warned, \u201cand better men than Stannis have done worse things than this.\u201d The king can be harsh and unforgiving, aye,<b> but a babe still on the breast? Only a monster would give a living child to the flames.</b> - Jon I, ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>That said, he is skeptical about their entire PR because it involves human sacrifice, even children. But given we do have a character with dragons already and no sacrifice need be involved, he would be more open to seeking out her help. But would that still be a good thing?\u00a0</p><p>A point many forget is the Others\u00a0aren\u2019t the same as wights.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe wights had been slow clumsy things, but the Other was light as snow on the wind.\u201d - Samwell I, ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>Wights are dead men are raised and controlled by the Others, and are a different race altogether.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWho goes there?\u201c A horse\u2019s head emerged from the darkness. Sam felt a moment\u2019s relief, until he saw the horse. Hoarfrost covered it like a <b>sheen of frozen sweat</b>, and a nest of stiff black entrails dragged from its open belly. <b>On its back was a rider pale as ice</b>. Sam made a whimpery sound deep in his throat. He was so scared he might have pissed himself all over again, but the cold was in him, a cold so savage that his bladder felt frozen solid.<b> The Other slid gracefully from the saddle to stand upon the snow. Sword-slim it was, and milky white.</b> Its armor rippled and shifted as it moved, and its feet did not break the crust of the new-fallen snow. - Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[Othor\u2019s]\u00a0flesh was <b>blanched white as milk</b>, everywhere but his hands. <b>His hands were black like Jafer\u2019s</b>. Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash, breast and groin and throat. <b>Yet his eyes</b> <b>were still open</b>. They stared up at the sky,<b> blue as sapphires</b>. - Jon VII, AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWhen he opened his mouth to scream,<b> the wight jammed its black corpse fingers</b> into Jon\u2019s mouth. Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was too heavy. Its hand forced itself farther down his throat,<b> icy cold</b>, choking him. Its face was against his own, filling the world. <b>Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue</b>.\u201d - Jon VII, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Unlike wights, they can snuff out flames.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\"Get away!\u201d Grenn took a step, thrusting the torch out before him. \u201cAway, or you burn.\u201d He poked at it with the flames.</p><p>The Other\u2019s sword gleamed with a faint blue glow. It moved toward Grenn, lightning quick, slashing. When the ice blue blade brushed the flames, a screech stabbed Sam\u2019s ears sharp as a needle. The head of the torch tumbled sideways to vanish beneath a deep drift of snow, the fire snuffed out at once. - Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>So is fire really the solution against them?\u00a0</p><h2><b>I. False Dawn</b></h2><p>What does work on the Others, however, is dragonglass that the Jon finds at the Fist of First Men. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnd then he was stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, closing his eyes and shoving the dagger blindly out before him with both hands. He heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when it breaks beneath a man\u2019s foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that he went staggering backward with his hands over his muffled ears, and fell hard on his arse. When he opened his eyes the Other\u2019s armor was running down its legs in rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass dagger in its throat. It reached down with two bone-white hands to pull out the knife, but where its fingers touched the obsidian they smoked. Sam rolled onto his side, eyes wide as the Other shrank and puddled, dissolving away. In twenty heartbeats its flesh was gone, swirling away in a fine white mist. Beneath were bones like milkglass, pale and shiny, and they were melting too. Finally only the dragonglass dagger remained, wreathed in steam as if it were alive and sweating. Grenn bent to scoop it up and flung it down again at once. \u201cMother, that\u2019s cold.\u201d </p><p>\u201cObsidian.\u201d Sam struggled to his knees. \u201cDragonglass, they call it. Dragonglass. Dragon glass.\u201d \u00a0- Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>The COTF, who are the species most associated with nature, were said to have employed it themselves instead of swords. Incidentally, dragonglass is called \u201cfrozen fire\u201d, which in many ways seems to be a combination of ice and fire - not fire by itself. </p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Dragonglass</b>.\u201d The red woman\u2019s laugh was music. \u201c<b>Frozen</b> <b>fire, in the tongue of old Valyria</b>. Small wonder it is anathema to these cold children of the Other.\u201d - Samwell V, ASOS </p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> has elaborated a lot more on this linking it to the COTF and the Last Hero <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168405569689/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and how it could be that the legend of the forging of Lightbringer is the forging of <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172374892064/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">any</a> Valyrian steel sword because it is linked with magic, and how valyrian swords could be used as weapons as well.\u00a0By comparing the North\u2019s Long Night with legends around a similar phenomenon in parts of Essos like Yi-ti or Rhoyne that the answer may lie <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173271319764/the-long-night-myth-and-mystery\" target=\"_blank\">elsewhere</a> and not in fire magic by itself. People also forget the last Long Night was won without dragons and rather with the help of COTF.</p><p>One could ask why would the author go through the ruse of framing ice and fire in opposition? Perhaps, because they\u2019re both meant to be seen as threats and there\u2019s a lot of blanks left unanswered and the R\u2019hllor cult seems to give them more, whether correct or incorrect, than the COTF, Bloodraven or any Northerner.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMy lord father used to tell me that a man must know his enemies. <b>We understand little of the wights and less about the Others</b>. We need to learn.\u201c - Jon III, ADWD\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>It is R\u2019hllorism that frames this dichotomy of one good side and one bad side.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\"The war?\u201d asked Davos.</p><p>\u201cThe war,\u201d she affirmed. \u201cThere are two, Onion Knight.

The war has been waged since time began, and before it is done, all men must choose where they will stand.<b> On one side is R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror</b>. Ours is not a choice between Baratheon and Lannister, between Greyjoy and Stark. <b>It is death we choose, or life. Darkness, or light.</b>\u201d \u00a0- Davos III, ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>This is a very black and white view of thinking and considering the tropes of conventional fantasy, readers assume Melisandre is wrong about <i>who</i> Azor Ahai reborn is, but not about what he/she is or what the war is about because we\u2019ve seen the Others; they\u2019re ice zombies and there\u2019s close to nothing to sympathise there. Except isn\u2019t the author\u2019s goal to deal with\u00a0\u201cconflict in the human heart?\u201d How do you deal with that if your greatest antagonist is just non-thinking, out to kill the living? People would faster believe they\u2019re controlled by Bloodraven, which they may or may not be, and he\u2019s the actual enemy. But is that enough?\u00a0</p><p>The talk of Daenerys and her dragons hasn\u2019t completely reached the Wall as Aemon and Sam find out about her in Braavos, but before dying Aemon held Sam to oath to research all he can about the prince that was promised prophecy in order to help Daenerys. It won\u2019t be long before Sam writes to Jon about her or more news gets to Jon at the Wall after his resurrection and upon her arrival to Dragonstone, because of the dragonglass also present there he would have double the reason to approach her. However,\u00a0Jon knows about Hardhome and once again it serves as a warning.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night six hundred years ago when hell had swallowed it. Its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, <b>their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north</b>. Afterward <b>ashes rained down on haunted forest</b> and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year. Traders reported finding only <b>nightmarish devastation </b>where Hardhome had stood, a <b>landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses</b>, blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement.\u201d - Jon VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Similar wording is used for the Dragonpit burning atop Rhaenys\u2019 Hill during the Dance of Dragons.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[The]\u00a0queen\u2019s own dragon remained alive and free \u2026 and as the burned and bloody survivors of the carnage in the pit came stumbling from the smoking ruins, Syrax descended upon them from above. <b>A thousand shrieks and shouts echoed across the city, mingling with the dragon\u2019s roar</b>. Atop the Hill of Rhaenys,<b> the Dragonpit wore a crown of yellow fire, burning so bright it seemed as if the sun was rising</b>. Even the queen trembled as she watched, the tears glistening on her cheeks. Many of the queen\u2019s companions on the rooftop fled, fearing that the fires would soon engulf the entire city, even the Red Keep atop Aegon\u2019s High Hill. Others took themselves to the castle sept to pray for deliverance.\u201d - Princess and the Queen<br></p></blockquote><p>A false dawn, again. The state of Hardhome sounds a bit like that of <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173044283669/when-the-land-is-cursed-catastrophe-and-magical\" target=\"_blank\">Valyria after the Doom and Asshai</a>, which is struck by magical pollution. It was attacked once by fire and in ADWD it was attacked once by ice. Both had devastating effects.\u00a0</p><h2><b>II. Dragons Plant No Trees</b></h2><p>Regarding\u00a0the credibility of the notion of \u201cice = death\u201d and \u201cfire = life\u201d, much of Melisandre and Davos\u2019s arguments on darkness and light shows how the lines blur and one becomes the other. Darkness is shown to cloak and protect and this is most shown through Bran\u2019s chapters as he hides in the crypts and in the cities of the COTF below the ground, even if Bloodraven might be taking advantage of Bran\u2019s innocence. Not to mention there are Saladhor Saan\u2019s words of warning.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cBe glad that it is just a burnt sword that His Grace pulled from that fire.<b> Too much light can hurt the eyes, my friend, and fire burns</b>.\u201c - Davos I, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Fire in limited amount might help but the idea that dragons as weapons of mass destruction could save humankind seems unlikely to me because they are \u201cfire made flesh\u201d to the Others\u2019 \u201cice made flesh\u201d. If ice can freeze, too much fire can burn. We also get characters like Beric and Lady Stoneheart resurrected through R\u2019hllor\u2019s fire magic and that doesn\u2019t seem like a good thing either. Beric is drained and loses his memories each time he gets back, and Catelyn has lost her humanity. Both of them driven by their last goal before dying, and not much else. Is that truly living? GRRM even calls them \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">wights animated by fire</a>\u201d.\u00a0<br></p><h2><b>II.A: Deconstruction of the fantasy hero</b></h2><p>Then of course, one is left to wonder if fire wights are not good, what does it say about Jon since Martin also claimed that bookwise, Beric is foreshadowing for Jon being drained after coming back from death. </p><blockquote><p><b>And Jon Snow, too, is drained by the experience of coming back from the dead on the show.<br></b>GRRM: Right. And poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this, every time he\u2019s a little less Beric. His memories are fading, he\u2019s got all these scars, he\u2019s becoming more and more physically hideous, because he\u2019s not a living human being anymore. His heart isn\u2019t beating, his blood isn\u2019t flowing in his veins, he\u2019s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we\u2019re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing.</p></blockquote><p>Many people assume this means Jon will come back as a fire wight himself. But he does warg into Ghost when he dies, so in a sense his soul is preserved by COTF magic - more than Beric\u2019s at least. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a> has written her own meta on why Jon <a href=\"https://occupyvenus.tumblr.com/post/171202759768/jon-wont-be-a-firewight\" target=\"_blank\">won\u2019t come back as a fire wight</a> because of a mixture of magic used to resurrect him (COTF, fire, blood and shadowbinding) - even if some may not be intended by Melisandre. This would prevent Jon from becoming a complete slave to one element, driven by one thought. He still would be drained, and will come back greyer, darker (as Martin has <a href=\"http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/george-r-r-martin-author-song-ice-and-fire-series-interview-sound-young-america#transcript\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> in comparison to his issues with Gandalf) and probably more wolfish from his time in Ghost after having tried to reject his wolf side; probably even his memories will start to fade.</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>I do think that if you\u2019re bringing a character back, that a character has gone through death, that\u2019s a transformative experience.</b> [\u2026] My characters who come back from death are<b> worse for wear.</b> In some ways, they\u2019re not even the same characters anymore.

He wanted Jon\u2019s death to shake him, traumatise him instead of just making him go into deep sleep and getting up. What he might\u2019ve been going for emotionally was Buffy\u2019s resurrection in BtVS that leaves her traumatised, apathetic and resentful towards her friends for pulling her out of heaven to return to the job of trying to save the world. From a hero she turns into an anti hero, and Jon was already getting there from ASOS to ADWD. Buffy\u2019s resurrection was one that was done well because it didn\u2019t brush away the seriousness of death. But like his time on \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d, I guess D&amp;D didn\u2019t want to really spend the remaining episodes/seasons on Jon\u2019s emotional transformation of that complexity, as they skipped it with Beric and skipped Lady Stoneheart altogether. What I do think they kept to is that Jon would be so scarred that he would not want to be brought back a second time, unlike Beric and this might be possible because the mixture of magic that bring him back after his time in Ghost don\u2019t make him fixate on one goal.\u00a0</p><p>One could then ask what was the <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist?from=Main.Watsonian\" target=\"_blank\">Watsonian</a> purpose of Jon being resurrected if he isn\u2019t some prophecised hero or messiah? I think that so much fantasy fiction writes Messianic characters resurrections \u201cfor a reason\u201d that Jon not having that role, and rather affecting the politics more in a way unrelated to it would be subversive.\u00a0I keep revisiting this topic of Jon\u2019s resurrection because I find that it deserves looking at more closely because as <a>@thewesterwoman</a>\u200b has written, Jon is the <a href=\"https://thewesterwoman.tumblr.com/post/164495254493/fantasy-tropes-in-asoiaf-the-lord-of-the-rings\" target=\"_blank\">only candidate</a>, who can answer \u201cWhat was Aragorn\u2019s tax policy?\u201d and this isn\u2019t based on character preference, but looking at which character is best trained in daily governance and is trying to bring about change through policy work. Of course, he can\u2019t do it alone and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173200586467/i-was-writing-a-long-post-on-how-probably-the#notes\" target=\"_blank\">he does need other people\u2019s skills, insights and connections</a> and that\u2019s part of why he died after isolating himself from his friends as Lord Commander and it goes back to the \u201cthe lone wolf dies, but the pack survives\u201d. It stands on the notion that a government shouldn\u2019t be built on the concept of an ideal ruler, but a collaborative government that doesn\u2019t cover for the king, but serves the realm.\u00a0<br></p><p>One might also ask who would save the day then if not Jon or Dany and if <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173833000269/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">Azor Ahai reborn/PTWP is a <i>destroyer</i></a> rather than a<i> </i>saviour? Somehow everyone forgets Bran and how he\u2019s actually Dany\u2019s equivalent in his potency of magic and visions and he is associated with earth magic and trees.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\"The godswood.\u201d Meera Reed ran after the direwolf, her shield and frog spear to hand. The rest of them trailed after, threading their way through smoke and fallen stones. The air was sweeter under the trees. A few pines along the edge of the wood had been scorched, but deeper in the damp soil and green wood had defeated the flames. \u201cThere is a power in living wood,\u201d said Jojen Reed, almost as if he knew what Bran was thinking, \u201ca power strong as fire.\u201d - Bran VII, ACOK<br></p></blockquote><p>The Lost Hero sought out the COTF from their secret cities and Bran the Builder helped build the Wall with the COTF\u2019s help, so perhaps the answer lies with a more \u201cliving\u201d\u00a0element of nature as they are put in opposition to ice and fire. If the Others are related to death, so is Dany called\u00a0\u201cDaughter of Death\u201d in the HOTU, and it does become a trend in hindsight that she leaves a trail of death and instability behind no matter where she goes. In that sense, earth magic that is not a pure magic unlike the Others and Valyrian dragons because the land is a mixture of a number of elements.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be both?\u201d Meera reached up to pinch his nose. </i>\u201cBecause they\u2019re different,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLike night and day, or ice and fire.\u201d \u201c<b>If ice can burn</b>,\u201d said Jojen in his solemn voice, \u201c<b>then love and hate can mate</b>. <b>Mountain or marsh, it makes no matter. The land is one</b>.\"\u00a0- Bran II, ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168551631589/the-ice-and-the-fire-of-the-song-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">trinuviel</a> has elaborated on this synthesis being a sign of impurity, which is positive in Martin\u2019s world that approaches purity negatively, like the Targaryens marrying their siblings to \u201ckeep the bloodline pure\u201d.\u00a0If the books follow the show about the COTF creating the Others as weapons against the First Men, even then the fact that they are able to separate themselves from the Others, <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172039010439/the-lost-wisdom-of-septon-barth-clues-to-the\" target=\"_blank\">unlike the Valyrians attachment to dragons</a>,\u00a0shows hope. \u00a0</p><h2><b>II.B: A Dragon is not a Slave</b></h2><p>If Jon\u2019s role is more political so would his employment of Dany\u2019s help with dragons. Ironically, within Jon\u2019s chapters itself Tycho Nestoris from the Iron Bank gives Jon a warning when he talks about dragons flippantly. </p><blockquote><p>\"Salladhor Saan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lysene pirate? Some say he has returned to his old haunts, this is so. And Lord Redwyne\u2019s war fleet creeps through the Broken Arm as well. On its way home, no doubt. But these men and their ships are well-known to us. No, these other sails \u2026 from farther east, perhaps \u2026 <b>one hears queer talk of dragons</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>Would that we had one here. </b>A dragon might warm things up a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord jests. You will forgive me if I do not laugh. <b>We Braavosi are descended from those who fled Valyria and the wroth of its dragonlords. We do not jape of dragons</b>.\u201d - Jon IX, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Jon doesn\u2019t take this warning very seriously perhaps because he doesn\u2019t expect to run into a dragon any time soon or because the Targaryen dynasty to his mind is a thing of the past and only a topic of songs in Westeros. But when Dany does land in Westeros, he might be more keen and when he does approach Dany for her dragons, army and dragonglass on Dragonstone (which Stannis has already lost to the Tyrells and he may perish in the North), he would be approaching her for utilitarian reasons. Perhaps, he even has to act as Quentyn\u2019s foil and <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/167743010258/amuse-the-queen-in-the-bedchamber\" target=\"_blank\">do what he cannot</a> and even what <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/166934623318/jon-snow-is-playing-cyvasse\" target=\"_blank\">f!Aegon cannot</a>, thinking he has more limitations because he doesn\u2019t know his own parentage - making his goal in the end prove futile.\u00a0Like Doran or perhaps more than him considering he would be meeting Dany during her campaign of conquest, he would probably know there might be a risk. But he\u2019d be willing to take it and try to minimise collateral damage. But the question again is, can dragons truly be controlled? Can nuclear power truly be controlled, if used for selfless reasons? </p><blockquote><p><b>Dragons are the nuclear deterrent, and only Daenerys has them, which in some ways makes her the most powerful person in the world</b>,\u201d Martin said in 2011. \u201cBut is that sufficient? These are the kind of issues I\u2019m trying to explore. The United States right now has the ability to destroy the world with our nuclear arsenal, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can achieve specific geopolitical goals. Power is more subtle than that. <b>You can have the power to destroy, but it doesn\u2019t give you the power to reform, or improve, or build</b>. - <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a></p></blockquote><p>In this event, Jon\u2019s first experience with\u00a0Othor\u2019s wight comes to mind.\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a>\u00a0often says,\u00a0\u201c<i>Jon tries to use fire to fight ice and burns his fingers</i>\u201d as foreshadowing for the future. He didn\u2019t come out of that experience untouched as his sword hand got burnt, and that was just a make shift torch he made on instinct. The impact of seeking out Dany and her dragons and trying to control her impulses will only work to a certain extent, until like Doran, what he is trying to protect burns too.\u00a0Essentially, trying to fight the Others, who represent climate change, with dragons, is like trying to fight them with an atom bomb. It\u2019s playing with fire because not only are dragons unpredictable, Dany is unpredictable.\u00a0</p><p>The theme of home has a huge significance in the story for a number of characters, who are seeking a place to belong. Where Dany is concerned, because she has lived her life on the run and because she has internalised Viserys\u2019 belief that the only place she can feel at home is Westeros in King\u2019s Landing and Dragonstone, that becomes her tragedy as she fails to set up roots anywhere she settles, as she looks West. Dany has no roots and therefore, she uproots people wherever she goes, intentionally or not. Theon seems to share this trend initially as he struggles between wanting to hate the Starks for uprooting him from Pyke and his family as a Greyjoy, but he also loves them and wants to be part of them, but cannot be as a ward. As Martin has said, although in a similar situation as Theon as part of the Starks and yet not part of it, Jon avoids becoming like him and acting on his negative feelings. Sansa, Arya and Bran, who despite their varying reasons of feeling out of place in Winterfell, find themselves longing to go back to it as they realise they had more than they realised. Moreover, the Starks\u2019\u00a0connection to Winterfell is through family and it serves as a tether to hold onto humanity and their identity. For Dany, after losing all her family, she grasps onto her dragon eggs and walks into the funeral pyre to hatch them, and when they do, she considers them her children. That unhealthy attachment to something so disastrous to human life is what ultimately could be the final straw in driving Dany to put them before humanity, as this starts from AGOT itself when she asks for her dragon eggs, rather than Rhaego in between her fevered dreams. That is foreboding in hindsight. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>Under the influence of a dragon rider, dragons can affect far larger masses than on their own.\u00a0Whether wanting to use it on the offensive, like Doran, or on the defensive, like Jon, a dragon still cannot be tamed.\u00a0 The North will not be spared as much as he\u2019d like, as Dorne will not be. There is even foreshadowing for <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/169075626529/are-dragons-going-to-burn-winterfell\" target=\"_blank\">Dany\u2019s dragons burning Winterfell</a> when Summer looks up in the sky during the Sack of Winterfell and considering the line \u201cDragons plant no trees\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Dany\u2019s dragons try to\u00a0<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/166285886062/the-heart-tree-of-winterfell-tolkien-influences\" target=\"_blank\">burn Winterfell\u2019s heart tree</a> to drive the point home. Perhaps because living wood has \u201cpower as strong as fire\u201d, the heart tree and part of the godswood may be spared, but a large part of Winterfell may not.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Interviewer: The number one question people ask me about the series is whether I think everyone will lose\u2014whether it will end in some horrible apocalypse.

That\u2019s certainly not my intent. <b>I\u2019ve said before that the tone of the ending that I\u2019m going for is bittersweet.</b> I mean, it\u2019s no secret that Tolkien has been a huge influence on me, and I love the way he ended Lord of the Rings. <b>It ends with victory, but it\u2019s a bittersweet victory. </b>Frodo is never whole again, and he goes away to the Undying Lands, and the other people live their lives. <b>And the scouring of the Shire\u2014brilliant piece of work, which I didn\u2019t understand when I was 13 years old: \u201cWhy is this here?

The world isn\u2019t destroyed, but the Hobbits\u2019 world is.\u00a0Winterfell is the most Shire-like place in Westeros, and it has already had the Library Tower burning as part of the attack on Bran, and the Sack of Winterfell. Keeping with <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/175442849800/hi-how-are-you-i-love-your-blog-and-as-you-i\" target=\"_blank\">the pattern of threes</a>\u00a0in significant locations, it may have to burn once more.\u00a0It may be that like the Hobbits, the Starks may save the realm, but may not be able to save their home.\u00a0There would be a kind of symmetry to the Water Gardens and the Glass Gardens being destroyed indirectly because Doran and Jon weaponise dragons for a cause.\u00a0</p><p>This might be Jon\u2019s tragedy as he tries to be the hero (even when he\u2019s too tired to be), tries to protect his homeland and the realm, making sacrifices and playing the game, he\u00a0<i>still </i>fails because he doesn\u2019t have enough context and overestimates his ability to keep Dany in check. It may be that despite his resurrection, he isn\u2019t some promised hero nor is Dany for hatching her dragons after walking into a funeral pyre. Death doesn\u2019t make Jon more powerful, but rather weaker and less of a hero - despite his attempts.\u00a0</p><p>That said, the ending is meant to be bittersweet it may be upon the Starks and their allies to rebuild Westeros from its shambles.\u00a0Perhaps, the irony would be that Jon, who is a hybrid of a dragon and a wolf, would in fact plant trees in contrast to Dany because he has roots connecting him to people and the land, even after it may be destroyed.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>As some of you may know, I subscribe to the theory that dragons and the fire associated Azor Ahai reborn <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168655191984/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">may not be effective</a> in the war against the Others in the Long Night. People generally assume this means inverting the enemy from the Others to the dragons, and I&rsquo;ve made <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/166317300627/fantasy-antagonists-of-asoiaf-who-are-the-orcs-in#notes\" target=\"_blank\">that mistake too</a> momentarily, but it seems more probable that <i>both</i> extreme fire and extreme ice <a href=\"https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/135888-the-long-night-and-the-great-summer/\" target=\"_blank\">can be harmful</a> to Westeros. There is of course, the apocalyptic implications of the two extremes in Robert Frost&rsquo;s poem <i><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice\" target=\"_blank\">Fire &amp; Ice</a></i>, that Martin <a href=\"http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html\" target=\"_blank\">admits</a> to have influenced his title, but apart from that the author may have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=273&amp;v=GaPZGDlm2F4\" target=\"_blank\">hinted</a> the Others and Dany&rsquo;s dragons being two apocalyptic threats to Westeros.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>[&hellip;]&nbsp;<b>the two outlying ones &mdash; the things going on north of the Wall, and then there is Targaryen on the other continent with her dragons &mdash; are of course the ice and fire of the title, &ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire.&rdquo;</b> The central stuff &mdash; the stuff that&rsquo;s happening in the middle, in King&rsquo;s Landing, the capital of the seven kingdoms &mdash; is much more based on historical events, historical fiction. It&rsquo;s loosely drawn from the Wars of the Roses and some of the other conflicts around the 100 Years&rsquo; War, although, of course, with a fantasy twist. You know, one of the dynamics I started with, there was the sense of people being so consumed by their petty struggles for power within the seven kingdoms, within King&rsquo;s Landing that <b>they&rsquo;re blind to the much greater and more dangerous threats that are happening far away on the periphery of their kingdoms.</b><br /></p></blockquote><p>People tend to assume that in this equation, Dany is the political threat to Westeros corruption, but considering GRRM has equated <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">dragons to nuclear power</a>, a destructive force rather than a constructive one (&rdquo;Dragons plant no trees&rdquo;), this may as well embody the theme of Robert Frost&rsquo;s <i>Fire &amp; Ice. </i>Both can be<i>&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168471722944/the-ice-and-the-fire-of-the-song-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">equally destructive</a> to human life.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<b>Fire is a cruel way to die</b>. Dalla died to give this child life, but you have nourished him, cherished him. <b>You saved your own boy from the ice. Now save hers from the fire.</b>&rdquo; &mdash;Jon II, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Of course, a number of characters see the return of dragons as a boon with the interpretations of prophecies like Azor Ahai reborn, the Prince That Was Promised, and the presence of Others and the susceptibility of wights to fire and Jon wishing for dragons as weapons of defence at the Wall. That said,&nbsp;&ldquo;Prophecy is a sword without a hilt&rdquo;, and what may seem like a boon may <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">actually be a nightmare</a>. This is a device that has been used by authors like Tolkien in <i><a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/175569556368/the-azor-ahaismaug-connection\" target=\"_blank\">The Hobbit</a></i>&nbsp;regarding the Esgaroth prophecy and Tad Williams in<i> <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172113783619/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">Memory, Sorrow, Thorn</a>&nbsp;</i>regarding the three<i>&nbsp;</i>magical swords from the title and the prophecy about Paris upon his birth from <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/174047973477/trojan-war-literature-influence-on-grrm\" target=\"_blank\">Trojan War cycle</a><i>,</i> <a href=\"https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/08/george-r-r-martin-i-revere-the-lord-of-the-rings/\" target=\"_blank\">all of</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/17/tropes-trolls-and-trump-meet-one-of-george-rr-martins-favourite-fantasy-writers-tad-williams\" target=\"_blank\">whom</a> Martin has admitted to draw inspiration from in his series.&nbsp;</p><p>With all this serving as a framing context, lets get into the main topic of this post without much further ado.&nbsp;</p><p>Given Dorne is the southern extreme of Westeros, I&rsquo;ve often found despite its differences from the North, it shares many similarities and thus, many warnings too. Through the connected timeline of AFFC and ADWD, Doran and Jon make political decisions behind the back of the Lannisters and the Night&rsquo;s Watch respectively risking treason or breaking a solemn oath in order to in fulfil their goals.&nbsp;It is striking how similar Doran&rsquo;s&nbsp;plans to enlist Dany&rsquo;s help through Quentyn and later to do a check up on f!Aegon through Arianne are with Jon sending Val to convince Tormund to bring his people to the Wall as well as using Mel and Dance to save f!Arya. But the connections go even further.&nbsp;<br /></p><h2><b>Doran, House Martell and Vengeance for lost family</b></h2><p>The history of House Martell and Dorne with the Targaryen dynasty and their loss of Elia and her children in Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion due to House Lannister&nbsp;becomes increasingly important to Dany&rsquo;s arc in ADWD. It is something she doesn&rsquo;t completely realize when refusing Quentyn&rsquo;s proposal as he doesn&rsquo;t offer her the swords and ships she desires to conquer Westeros and it is also in part what leads to Quentyn&rsquo;s death by Dany&rsquo;s dragons. This political mishap shifts the political dynamics, of course, but more so it also shifts the perspective of Doran&rsquo;s long coming revenge plot against the Lannisters with the help of Targaryens, which <i>Meereenese Blot</i> has dedicated a number of <a href=\"https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/water-gardens-and-blood-oranges-part-i-the-viper-and-the-grass/\" target=\"_blank\">essays</a> on.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>She narrowed her eyes. &ldquo;What is our heart&rsquo;s desire?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vengeance.&rdquo; His voice was soft, as if he were afraid that someone might be listening. &ldquo;Justice.&rdquo; Prince Doran pressed the onyx dragon into her palm with his swollen, gouty fingers, and whispered, &ldquo;<i>Fire and blood</i>.&rdquo; - Arianne II, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>Doran&rsquo;s&nbsp;plan to help Dany in her war in conquering back Westeros is fuelled by personal reasons of vengeance against Tywin. But he doesn&rsquo;t seem to drop this plan even after Tywin is murdered. His desire for vengeance goes much deeper in trying to strip the Lannisters of their legacy, so Tywin couldn&rsquo;t have left anything behind. At the same time,&nbsp;he doesn&rsquo;t want too much destruction of human life to Dorne in this war knowing the impact of the Sack of King&rsquo;s Landing that took Elia and her children&rsquo;s lives. So instead of his own spears, he turns to dragons.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is an easy thing for a prince to call the spears, but in the end the children pay the price. For their sake, the wise prince will wage no war without good cause, nor any war he cannot hope to win.&rdquo; - Areo I, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>He doesn&rsquo;t send for Viserys despite the pact because he wanted him to get an army first that would ensure he was entering a war he could win.&nbsp;The Meereenese Blot talks a lot about the thematic criticism of <a href=\"https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2014/03/23/water-gardens-and-blood-oranges-part-iv-it-ends-in-blood/\" target=\"_blank\">vengeance</a> as a motivating factor in Doran&rsquo;s plan, which definitely fits with the larger themes of the series. Where does that vengeance stop? Ellaria voices this in front of Doran and the Sand Snakes.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Obara bristled. &ldquo;I never did and never shall.&rdquo; She gave the skull a mocking kiss. &ldquo;This is a start, I&rsquo;ll grant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A start?&rdquo; said Ellaria Sand, incredulous. &ldquo;Gods forbid. I would it were a finish. Tywin Lannister is dead. So are Robert Baratheon, Amory Lorch, and now Gregor Clegane, all those who had a hand in murdering Elia and her children. Even Joffrey, who was not yet born when Elia died. I saw the boy perish with mine own eyes, clawing at his throat as he tried to draw a breath. <b>Who else is there to kill? Do Myrcella and Tommen need to die so the shades of Rhaenys and Aegon can be at rest?</b> <b>Where does it end?</b>&rdquo; - Areo I, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>All of their perpetrators are gone. So is this cause just anymore? Doran and the Sand Snakes seem to have channelled their grief into this quest for revenge by killing everyone that wronged them and making them feel what loss truly feels like. But their perpetrators have died either without much of their hand in it or with additional loss of Oberyn. The spectrum of revenge and justice and the pitfalls of mistaking one for the others is a defining theme in Arya&rsquo;s arc, and going by her journey and Lady Stoneheart&rsquo;s the reader is pulled back to question if this revenge is more damaging to oneself and others.&nbsp;</p><p>Ellaria&rsquo;s questions can, of course, be stretched to Dany as well. Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion may have been justified against Aerys but what happened in the Sack of King&rsquo;s Landing and the attempts on Viserys and Dany&rsquo;s lives were not. However, her belief in needing to go back to Westeros to&nbsp;&ldquo;take back what is [hers]&rdquo; for the sake of her family and the life on the run she was subjected to falls flat because Robert is dead; Tywin is dead; and while he never supported Robert&rsquo;s and Tywin&rsquo;s actions in going after mothers and children, Ned is dead too. And beyond that, there is only the fact that Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion happened not just because Rhaegar abducted Lyanna, but because Aerys wrongfully executed Rickard and Brandon Stark, Jon Arryn&rsquo;s nephew and heir, bannermen of Hoster Tully, and demanded Jon Arryn to deliver him both Ned and Robert. Beyond those war crimes that Tywin and Robert committed, the rebellion to overthrow the Targaryen dynasty was justified. So what is Dany coming to exact? Where has her impulsive vengeful conquering of Slaver&rsquo;s Bay led her? She committed a number of war crimes too, no matter how just her cause.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace. Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort. King Quentyn. Why did that sound so silly? Almost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.&rdquo; - Arianne I, TWOW<br /></p></blockquote><p>The Water Gardens as a symbol of peace stand in stark contrast with Doran and Dany&rsquo;s larger goals. Its history linked the Targaryens and the Martells in peaceful union and Daenerys I made people realise the beauty and fragility of children. Rhaegar put a dent in that peace when he passed by Elia and crowned Lyanna at the Tourney of Harrenhal and even entered into a war that costed Elia and her children their lives. But the final blow was delivered by Dany&rsquo;s rejection of Quentyn&rsquo;s proposal. She does it in part due to her duty to Meereen, but also because she wanted an army and ships, not a marriage alliance and one overlooked fact, because of Quaithe&rsquo;s warning.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>His friends had lost sight of his true purpose here. The road leads through her, not to her. Daenerys is the means to the prize, not the prize itself. &ldquo; &rsquo;<b>The dragon has three heads</b>,&rsquo; she said to me. &rsquo;<b>My marriage need not be the end of all your hopes,&rsquo; she said.</b> &lsquo;I know why you are here. For fire and blood.&rsquo; <b>I have Targaryen blood in me, you know that</b>. I can trace my lineage back&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck your lineage,&rdquo; said Gerris. &ldquo;The dragons won&rsquo;t care about your blood, except maybe how it tastes.<b> You cannot tame a dragon with a history lesson. They&rsquo;re monsters</b>, not maesters - Daenerys VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>With this rejection two Targaryen siblings have slighted two Martells and caused their deaths inadvertently, where two Targaryen siblings of the past, Daeron II and Daenerys I sealed peace with Dorne by marrying into House Martell.&nbsp;Doran is too vengeful to let this slide, especially when he lost Oberyn so recently. Remember that Arianne&rsquo;s one mistake causes the&nbsp;disfigurement of Myrcella&rsquo;s face and Arys Oakheart&rsquo;s death and Cersei is already planning for war.</p><blockquote><p>\"Only if we lost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If? The word is when. <b>Dorne is the least populous of the Seven Kingdoms. </b>It pleased the Young Dragon to make all our armies larger when he wrote that book of his, so as to make his conquest that much more glorious, and it has pleased us to water the seed he planted and let our foes think us more powerful than we are, but a princess ought to know the truth. Valor is a poor substitute for numbers. <b>Dorne cannot hope to win a war against the Iron Throne, not alone</b>. <b>And yet that may well be what you have given us</b>.&rdquo; &nbsp;- The Princess in the Tower, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>And Dany may have doomed herself by baiting Quentyn with the fact that he needn&rsquo;t marry her and his journey to her for &ldquo;fire and blood&rdquo;&nbsp;may not be for nothing with the words &ldquo;the dragon has three heads&rdquo;.&nbsp;The fact that f!Aegon has landed in the Stormlands with an army, that Doran was waiting on also gives him more of a chance to go against Dany as the Dornish have fought away the dragons before.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"Send a raven whenever you have news,&rdquo; Prince Doran told her, &ldquo;but report only what you know to be true. We are lost in fog here, besieged by rumors, falsehoods, and traveler&rsquo;s tales.<b> I dare not act until I know for a certainty what is happening</b>.&rdquo;</p><p><b>War is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be spared. </b>&ldquo;Doom and death are coming,&rdquo; Ellaria Sand had warned them, before she took her own leave from Prince Doran. - Arianne I, TWOW<br /></p></blockquote><p>Ultimately, if Doran&rsquo;s own plans haven&rsquo;t already backfired on him, choosing to enter this war for revenge over his lost family will only bring more tragedy to his House and perhaps, the very Water Gardens that he wants to protect.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from the motive that drives Doran&rsquo;s plan that comes back to bite him, there is the <i>method</i> to consider. Is&nbsp;&ldquo;Fire and Blood&rdquo; a &ldquo;cleaner method&rdquo;? Quentyn, Hazzea and the destruction and loss of life at Astapor and the fighting pits of Meereen would say otherwise.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<b>Frog would be glad to put Astapor behind him. The Red City was the closest thing to hell he ever hoped to know.</b> The Yunkai'i had sealed the broken gates to keep the dead and dying inside the city, but the sights that he had seen riding down those red brick streets would haunt Quentyn Martell forever. A river choked with corpses. The priestess in her torn robes, impaled upon a stake and attended by a cloud of glistening green flies. Dying men staggering through the streets, bloody and befouled. Children fighting over half-cooked puppies. The last free king of Astapor, screaming naked in the pit as he was set on by a score of starving dogs.<b> And fires, fires everywhere. He could close his eyes and see them still: flames whirling from brick pyramids larger than any castle he had ever seen</b>, plumes of greasy smoke coiling upward like great black snakes.&rdquo; - The Windblown, ADWD<br /></p></blockquote><p>That Dany wanted to stop slavery or at least punish slavers for their cruel treatment is admirable, but the method by which she does it destroys cities and shatters the economy without replacing it with something else. Thereby causing harm to the very people she wants to help and bringing the cost of more compromises to hold the peace when she does settle down to rule in Meereen. Her fragile peace is the cost of her impulsive approach, that she doesn&rsquo;t start to question until after she storms through three cities. Having settled down, she is revealed as an ineffective ruler because of her temperament despite her intentions and this would be what she would be bringing to Westeros as well.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>[&hellip;] when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, &ldquo;Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.&rdquo; - Bran I, ACOK</p></blockquote><h2><b>Jon, the Night&rsquo;s Watch &amp; Weapons of Defence</b></h2><p>A number of people believe that even if Dany&rsquo;s conquest may be misguided, her true goal is to go north of the Wall and fight the Others to protect the realm with the help of her dragons, particularly because of that first instance when Jon killed a wight in AGOT with a brand of fire.&nbsp;<br /></p><blockquote><p>Truly, the gods had heard Jon&rsquo;s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man&rsquo;s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood. Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames. It was the face that haunted him most; <b>surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw</b>, the <b>dead flesh melting away</b> and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath.<b>Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames</b>; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than<b> cooked meat and charred bone</b>. - Jon VIII, AGOT<br /></p></blockquote><p>And, of course, Jon&rsquo;s thoughts when the free folk are about to invade the realm:</p><blockquote><p>We should have twenty trebuchets, not two, and they should be mounted on sledges and turntables so we could move them. It was a futile thought. He might as well wish for another thousand men, and <b>maybe a dragon or three</b>. - Jon VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Unlike Doran&rsquo;s quest for revenge, Jon is trying to mobilise forces and would be willing to use dragons for the defence of the realm. But would it have different results merely because of a less negative intent? So far Jon has actively gone out to seek dragons, but Melisandre claims Stannis is a prophecised prince and he can&nbsp;&ldquo;wake dragons out of stone&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Burning dead children had ceased to trouble Jon Snow; live ones were another matter. <b>Two kings to wake the dragon</b>. The father first and then the son, so both die kings. The words had been murmured by one of the queen&rsquo;s men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds. Jon had tried to dismiss them as his fever talking. Aemon had demurred. &ldquo;There is power in a king&rsquo;s blood,&rdquo; the old maester had warned, &ldquo;and better men than Stannis have done worse things than this.&rdquo; The king can be harsh and unforgiving, aye,<b> but a babe still on the breast? Only a monster would give a living child to the flames.</b> - Jon I, ASOS<br /></p></blockquote><p>That said, he is skeptical about their entire PR because it involves human sacrifice, even children. But given we do have a character with dragons already and no sacrifice need be involved, he would be more open to seeking out her help. But would that still be a good thing?&nbsp;</p><p>A point many forget is the Others&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t the same as wights.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The wights had been slow clumsy things, but the Other was light as snow on the wind.&rdquo; - Samwell I, ASOS<br /></p></blockquote><p>Wights are dead men are raised and controlled by the Others, and are a different race altogether.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&ldquo; A horse&rsquo;s head emerged from the darkness. Sam felt a moment&rsquo;s relief, until he saw the horse. Hoarfrost covered it like a <b>sheen of frozen sweat</b>, and a nest of stiff black entrails dragged from its open belly. <b>On its back was a rider pale as ice</b>. Sam made a whimpery sound deep in his throat. He was so scared he might have pissed himself all over again, but the cold was in him, a cold so savage that his bladder felt frozen solid.<b> The Other slid gracefully from the saddle to stand upon the snow. Sword-slim it was, and milky white.</b> Its armor rippled and shifted as it moved, and its feet did not break the crust of the new-fallen snow. - Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[Othor&rsquo;s]&nbsp;flesh was <b>blanched white as milk</b>, everywhere but his hands. <b>His hands were black like Jafer&rsquo;s</b>. Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash, breast and groin and throat. <b>Yet his eyes</b> <b>were still open</b>. They stared up at the sky,<b> blue as sapphires</b>. - Jon VII, AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;When he opened his mouth to scream,<b> the wight jammed its black corpse fingers</b> into Jon&rsquo;s mouth. Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was too heavy. Its hand forced itself farther down his throat,<b> icy cold</b>, choking him. Its face was against his own, filling the world. <b>Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue</b>.&rdquo; - Jon VII, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Unlike wights, they can snuff out flames.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"Get away!&rdquo; Grenn took a step, thrusting the torch out before him. &ldquo;Away, or you burn.&rdquo; He poked at it with the flames.</p><p>The Other&rsquo;s sword gleamed with a faint blue glow. It moved toward Grenn, lightning quick, slashing. When the ice blue blade brushed the flames, a screech stabbed Sam&rsquo;s ears sharp as a needle. The head of the torch tumbled sideways to vanish beneath a deep drift of snow, the fire snuffed out at once. - Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>So is fire really the solution against them?&nbsp;</p><h2><b>I. False Dawn</b></h2><p>What does work on the Others, however, is dragonglass that the Jon finds at the Fist of First Men. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;And then he was stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, closing his eyes and shoving the dagger blindly out before him with both hands. He heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when it breaks beneath a man&rsquo;s foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that he went staggering backward with his hands over his muffled ears, and fell hard on his arse. When he opened his eyes the Other&rsquo;s armor was running down its legs in rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass dagger in its throat. It reached down with two bone-white hands to pull out the knife, but where its fingers touched the obsidian they smoked. Sam rolled onto his side, eyes wide as the Other shrank and puddled, dissolving away. In twenty heartbeats its flesh was gone, swirling away in a fine white mist. Beneath were bones like milkglass, pale and shiny, and they were melting too. Finally only the dragonglass dagger remained, wreathed in steam as if it were alive and sweating. Grenn bent to scoop it up and flung it down again at once. &ldquo;Mother, that&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Obsidian.&rdquo; Sam struggled to his knees. &ldquo;Dragonglass, they call it. Dragonglass. Dragon glass.&rdquo; &nbsp;- Samwell I, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>The COTF, who are the species most associated with nature, were said to have employed it themselves instead of swords. Incidentally, dragonglass is called &ldquo;frozen fire&rdquo;, which in many ways seems to be a combination of ice and fire - not fire by itself. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<b>Dragonglass</b>.&rdquo; The red woman&rsquo;s laugh was music. &ldquo;<b>Frozen</b> <b>fire, in the tongue of old Valyria</b>. Small wonder it is anathema to these cold children of the Other.&rdquo; - Samwell V, ASOS </p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> has elaborated a lot more on this linking it to the COTF and the Last Hero <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168405569689/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and how it could be that the legend of the forging of Lightbringer is the forging of <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172374892064/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">any</a> Valyrian steel sword because it is linked with magic, and how valyrian swords could be used as weapons as well.&nbsp;By comparing the North&rsquo;s Long Night with legends around a similar phenomenon in parts of Essos like Yi-ti or Rhoyne that the answer may lie <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173271319764/the-long-night-myth-and-mystery\" target=\"_blank\">elsewhere</a> and not in fire magic by itself. People also forget the last Long Night was won without dragons and rather with the help of COTF.</p><p>One could ask why would the author go through the ruse of framing ice and fire in opposition? Perhaps, because they&rsquo;re both meant to be seen as threats and there&rsquo;s a lot of blanks left unanswered and the R&rsquo;hllor cult seems to give them more, whether correct or incorrect, than the COTF, Bloodraven or any Northerner.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;My lord father used to tell me that a man must know his enemies. <b>We understand little of the wights and less about the Others</b>. We need to learn.&ldquo; - Jon III, ADWD&nbsp;<br /></p></blockquote><p>It is R&rsquo;hllorism that frames this dichotomy of one good side and one bad side.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"The war?&rdquo; asked Davos.</p><p>&ldquo;The war,&rdquo; she affirmed. &ldquo;There are two, Onion Knight. Not seven, not one, not a hundred or a thousand. Two! Do you think I crossed half the world to put yet another vain king on yet another empty throne? The war has been waged since time began, and before it is done, all men must choose where they will stand.<b> On one side is R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror</b>. Ours is not a choice between Baratheon and Lannister, between Greyjoy and Stark. <b>It is death we choose, or life. Darkness, or light.</b>&rdquo; &nbsp;- Davos III, ASOS<br /></p></blockquote><p>This is a very black and white view of thinking and considering the tropes of conventional fantasy, readers assume Melisandre is wrong about <i>who</i> Azor Ahai reborn is, but not about what he/she is or what the war is about because we&rsquo;ve seen the Others; they&rsquo;re ice zombies and there&rsquo;s close to nothing to sympathise there. Except isn&rsquo;t the author&rsquo;s goal to deal with&nbsp;&ldquo;conflict in the human heart?&rdquo; How do you deal with that if your greatest antagonist is just non-thinking, out to kill the living? People would faster believe they&rsquo;re controlled by Bloodraven, which they may or may not be, and he&rsquo;s the actual enemy. But is that enough?&nbsp;</p><p>The talk of Daenerys and her dragons hasn&rsquo;t completely reached the Wall as Aemon and Sam find out about her in Braavos, but before dying Aemon held Sam to oath to research all he can about the prince that was promised prophecy in order to help Daenerys. It won&rsquo;t be long before Sam writes to Jon about her or more news gets to Jon at the Wall after his resurrection and upon her arrival to Dragonstone, because of the dragonglass also present there he would have double the reason to approach her. However,&nbsp;Jon knows about Hardhome and once again it serves as a warning.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night six hundred years ago when hell had swallowed it. Its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, <b>their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north</b>. Afterward <b>ashes rained down on haunted forest</b> and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year. Traders reported finding only <b>nightmarish devastation </b>where Hardhome had stood, a <b>landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses</b>, blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement.&rdquo; - Jon VIII, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Similar wording is used for the Dragonpit burning atop Rhaenys&rsquo; Hill during the Dance of Dragons.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[The]&nbsp;queen&rsquo;s own dragon remained alive and free &hellip; and as the burned and bloody survivors of the carnage in the pit came stumbling from the smoking ruins, Syrax descended upon them from above. <b>A thousand shrieks and shouts echoed across the city, mingling with the dragon&rsquo;s roar</b>. Atop the Hill of Rhaenys,<b> the Dragonpit wore a crown of yellow fire, burning so bright it seemed as if the sun was rising</b>. Even the queen trembled as she watched, the tears glistening on her cheeks. Many of the queen&rsquo;s companions on the rooftop fled, fearing that the fires would soon engulf the entire city, even the Red Keep atop Aegon&rsquo;s High Hill. Others took themselves to the castle sept to pray for deliverance.&rdquo; - Princess and the Queen<br /></p></blockquote><p>A false dawn, again. The state of Hardhome sounds a bit like that of <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173044283669/when-the-land-is-cursed-catastrophe-and-magical\" target=\"_blank\">Valyria after the Doom and Asshai</a>, which is struck by magical pollution. It was attacked once by fire and in ADWD it was attacked once by ice. Both had devastating effects.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>II. Dragons Plant No Trees</b></h2><p>Regarding&nbsp;the credibility of the notion of &ldquo;ice = death&rdquo; and &ldquo;fire = life&rdquo;, much of Melisandre and Davos&rsquo;s arguments on darkness and light shows how the lines blur and one becomes the other. Darkness is shown to cloak and protect and this is most shown through Bran&rsquo;s chapters as he hides in the crypts and in the cities of the COTF below the ground, even if Bloodraven might be taking advantage of Bran&rsquo;s innocence. Not to mention there are Saladhor Saan&rsquo;s words of warning.&nbsp;<br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be glad that it is just a burnt sword that His Grace pulled from that fire.<b> Too much light can hurt the eyes, my friend, and fire burns</b>.&ldquo; - Davos I, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Fire in limited amount might help but the idea that dragons as weapons of mass destruction could save humankind seems unlikely to me because they are &ldquo;fire made flesh&rdquo; to the Others&rsquo; &ldquo;ice made flesh&rdquo;. If ice can freeze, too much fire can burn. We also get characters like Beric and Lady Stoneheart resurrected through R&rsquo;hllor&rsquo;s fire magic and that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good thing either. Beric is drained and loses his memories each time he gets back, and Catelyn has lost her humanity. Both of them driven by their last goal before dying, and not much else. Is that truly living? GRRM even calls them &ldquo;<a href=\"http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">wights animated by fire</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br /></p><h2><b>II.A: Deconstruction of the fantasy hero</b></h2><p>Then of course, one is left to wonder if fire wights are not good, what does it say about Jon since Martin also claimed that bookwise, Beric is foreshadowing for Jon being drained after coming back from death. </p><blockquote><p><b>And Jon Snow, too, is drained by the experience of coming back from the dead on the show.<br /></b>GRRM: Right. And poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this, every time he&rsquo;s a little less Beric. His memories are fading, he&rsquo;s got all these scars, he&rsquo;s becoming more and more physically hideous, because he&rsquo;s not a living human being anymore. His heart isn&rsquo;t beating, his blood isn&rsquo;t flowing in his veins, he&rsquo;s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we&rsquo;re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing.</p></blockquote><p>Many people assume this means Jon will come back as a fire wight himself. But he does warg into Ghost when he dies, so in a sense his soul is preserved by COTF magic - more than Beric&rsquo;s at least. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a> has written her own meta on why Jon <a href=\"https://occupyvenus.tumblr.com/post/171202759768/jon-wont-be-a-firewight\" target=\"_blank\">won&rsquo;t come back as a fire wight</a> because of a mixture of magic used to resurrect him (COTF, fire, blood and shadowbinding) - even if some may not be intended by Melisandre. This would prevent Jon from becoming a complete slave to one element, driven by one thought. He still would be drained, and will come back greyer, darker (as Martin has <a href=\"http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/george-r-r-martin-author-song-ice-and-fire-series-interview-sound-young-america#transcript\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> in comparison to his issues with Gandalf) and probably more wolfish from his time in Ghost after having tried to reject his wolf side; probably even his memories will start to fade.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<b>I do think that if you&rsquo;re bringing a character back, that a character has gone through death, that&rsquo;s a transformative experience.</b> [&hellip;] My characters who come back from death are<b> worse for wear.</b> In some ways, they&rsquo;re not even the same characters anymore.

And as I got older and considered it more, it also seemed to me that <b>death doesn&rsquo;t make you more powerful</b>. That&rsquo;s, in some ways, me talking to Tolkien in the dialogue, saying, &rsquo;<b>Yeah, if someone comes back from being dead, especially if they suffer a violent, traumatic death,</b> <b>they&rsquo;re not going to come back as nice as ever</b>.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I was trying to do, and am still trying to do, with the Lady Stoneheart character.&rdquo; - <a href=\"http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM, TIME interview</a><br /></p></blockquote><p>I have often wondered why he made Jon go through such a plot if he hates resurrection plots so much (<a href=\"https://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/08/14/maybe-stan-lee-is-my-biggest-literary-influence-george-rr-martin/\" target=\"_blank\">a problem he had with Wonderman</a> when he was younger as well, despite being inspired by his complexity). I dubbed this problem the &ldquo;Resurrection Problem&rdquo; and while thinking on it, I realised Jon wasn&rsquo;t supposed to come back &ldquo;improved&rdquo; as a prophecised hero, but <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173274672792/the-resurrection-problem\" target=\"_blank\">lesser than he was</a>. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<b>Death is a pretty serious business.</b> I remember when I was on a TV show in 80s &lsquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; and Linda Hamilton was the star and after two seasons she left. It was more dramatic to write her out and bring on a new Beauty [then to end the show].<b> The network supported us in killing her but wanted us to get past it very quickly. We had a big fight with them about it. The next episode was her funeral and the next 12 episodes was the search for her murderer and Beast&rsquo;s vengeance</b> but the network was like &lsquo;people don&rsquo;t want to be sad.&rdquo; Kill her and never mention her again. <b>Death should hurt just like it does when death happens to us in real life.</b> It&rsquo;s a gut-wrenching event we can&rsquo;t easily shrug it aside.</p><p><b>I want my readers to feel emotions. Fiction is about emotion.</b> I want you guys to read my books and laugh and cry and be scared and if the character is in jeopardy I want you to be afraid to turn the next page. <b>And not all the emotions are good ones</b>.&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/hitfix/george-rr-martin-talks-about-how-comic-books-influenced-his-work/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM, UPROXX</a></p></blockquote><p>I think the show might&rsquo;ve just not grasped Martin&rsquo;s complexity here. He wanted Jon&rsquo;s death to shake him, traumatise him instead of just making him go into deep sleep and getting up. What he might&rsquo;ve been going for emotionally was Buffy&rsquo;s resurrection in BtVS that leaves her traumatised, apathetic and resentful towards her friends for pulling her out of heaven to return to the job of trying to save the world. From a hero she turns into an anti hero, and Jon was already getting there from ASOS to ADWD. Buffy&rsquo;s resurrection was one that was done well because it didn&rsquo;t brush away the seriousness of death. But like his time on &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo;, I guess D&amp;D didn&rsquo;t want to really spend the remaining episodes/seasons on Jon&rsquo;s emotional transformation of that complexity, as they skipped it with Beric and skipped Lady Stoneheart altogether. What I do think they kept to is that Jon would be so scarred that he would not want to be brought back a second time, unlike Beric and this might be possible because the mixture of magic that bring him back after his time in Ghost don&rsquo;t make him fixate on one goal.&nbsp;</p><p>One could then ask what was the <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist?from=Main.Watsonian\" target=\"_blank\">Watsonian</a> purpose of Jon being resurrected if he isn&rsquo;t some prophecised hero or messiah? I think that so much fantasy fiction writes Messianic characters resurrections &ldquo;for a reason&rdquo; that Jon not having that role, and rather affecting the politics more in a way unrelated to it would be subversive.&nbsp;I keep revisiting this topic of Jon&rsquo;s resurrection because I find that it deserves looking at more closely because as <a>@thewesterwoman</a>&#8203; has written, Jon is the <a href=\"https://thewesterwoman.tumblr.com/post/164495254493/fantasy-tropes-in-asoiaf-the-lord-of-the-rings\" target=\"_blank\">only candidate</a>, who can answer &ldquo;What was Aragorn&rsquo;s tax policy?&rdquo; and this isn&rsquo;t based on character preference, but looking at which character is best trained in daily governance and is trying to bring about change through policy work. Of course, he can&rsquo;t do it alone and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173200586467/i-was-writing-a-long-post-on-how-probably-the#notes\" target=\"_blank\">he does need other people&rsquo;s skills, insights and connections</a> and that&rsquo;s part of why he died after isolating himself from his friends as Lord Commander and it goes back to the &ldquo;the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives&rdquo;. It stands on the notion that a government shouldn&rsquo;t be built on the concept of an ideal ruler, but a collaborative government that doesn&rsquo;t cover for the king, but serves the realm.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>One might also ask who would save the day then if not Jon or Dany and if <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173833000269/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">Azor Ahai reborn/PTWP is a <i>destroyer</i></a> rather than a<i> </i>saviour? Somehow everyone forgets Bran and how he&rsquo;s actually Dany&rsquo;s equivalent in his potency of magic and visions and he is associated with earth magic and trees.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"The godswood.&rdquo; Meera Reed ran after the direwolf, her shield and frog spear to hand. The rest of them trailed after, threading their way through smoke and fallen stones. The air was sweeter under the trees. A few pines along the edge of the wood had been scorched, but deeper in the damp soil and green wood had defeated the flames. &ldquo;There is a power in living wood,&rdquo; said Jojen Reed, almost as if he knew what Bran was thinking, &ldquo;a power strong as fire.&rdquo; - Bran VII, ACOK<br /></p></blockquote><p>The Lost Hero sought out the COTF from their secret cities and Bran the Builder helped build the Wall with the COTF&rsquo;s help, so perhaps the answer lies with a more &ldquo;living&rdquo;&nbsp;element of nature as they are put in opposition to ice and fire. If the Others are related to death, so is Dany called&nbsp;&ldquo;Daughter of Death&rdquo; in the HOTU, and it does become a trend in hindsight that she leaves a trail of death and instability behind no matter where she goes. In that sense, earth magic that is not a pure magic unlike the Others and Valyrian dragons because the land is a mixture of a number of elements.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t it be both?&rdquo; Meera reached up to pinch his nose. </i>&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re different,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Like night and day, or ice and fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>If ice can burn</b>,&rdquo; said Jojen in his solemn voice, &ldquo;<b>then love and hate can mate</b>. <b>Mountain or marsh, it makes no matter.

Ironically, within Jon&rsquo;s chapters itself Tycho Nestoris from the Iron Bank gives Jon a warning when he talks about dragons flippantly. </p><blockquote><p>\"Salladhor Saan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Lysene pirate? Some say he has returned to his old haunts, this is so. And Lord Redwyne&rsquo;s war fleet creeps through the Broken Arm as well. On its way home, no doubt. But these men and their ships are well-known to us. No, these other sails &hellip; from farther east, perhaps &hellip; <b>one hears queer talk of dragons</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Would that we had one here. </b>A dragon might warm things up a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My lord jests. You will forgive me if I do not laugh. <b>We Braavosi are descended from those who fled Valyria and the wroth of its dragonlords. We do not jape of dragons</b>.&rdquo; - Jon IX, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Jon doesn&rsquo;t take this warning very seriously perhaps because he doesn&rsquo;t expect to run into a dragon any time soon or because the Targaryen dynasty to his mind is a thing of the past and only a topic of songs in Westeros. But when Dany does land in Westeros, he might be more keen and when he does approach Dany for her dragons, army and dragonglass on Dragonstone (which Stannis has already lost to the Tyrells and he may perish in the North), he would be approaching her for utilitarian reasons. Perhaps, he even has to act as Quentyn&rsquo;s foil and <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/167743010258/amuse-the-queen-in-the-bedchamber\" target=\"_blank\">do what he cannot</a> and even what <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/166934623318/jon-snow-is-playing-cyvasse\" target=\"_blank\">f!Aegon cannot</a>, thinking he has more limitations because he doesn&rsquo;t know his own parentage - making his goal in the end prove futile.&nbsp;Like Doran or perhaps more than him considering he would be meeting Dany during her campaign of conquest, he would probably know there might be a risk. But he&rsquo;d be willing to take it and try to minimise collateral damage. But the question again is, can dragons truly be controlled? Can nuclear power truly be controlled, if used for selfless reasons? </p><blockquote><p><b>Dragons are the nuclear deterrent, and only Daenerys has them, which in some ways makes her the most powerful person in the world</b>,&rdquo; Martin said in 2011. &ldquo;But is that sufficient? These are the kind of issues I&rsquo;m trying to explore. The United States right now has the ability to destroy the world with our nuclear arsenal, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can achieve specific geopolitical goals. Power is more subtle than that. <b>You can have the power to destroy, but it doesn&rsquo;t give you the power to reform, or improve, or build</b>. - <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a></p></blockquote><p>In this event, Jon&rsquo;s first experience with&nbsp;Othor&rsquo;s wight comes to mind.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\" target=\"_blank\">@occupyvenus</a>&nbsp;often says,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Jon tries to use fire to fight ice and burns his fingers</i>&rdquo; as foreshadowing for the future. He didn&rsquo;t come out of that experience untouched as his sword hand got burnt, and that was just a make shift torch he made on instinct. The impact of seeking out Dany and her dragons and trying to control her impulses will only work to a certain extent, until like Doran, what he is trying to protect burns too.&nbsp;Essentially, trying to fight the Others, who represent climate change, with dragons, is like trying to fight them with an atom bomb. It&rsquo;s playing with fire because not only are dragons unpredictable, Dany is unpredictable.&nbsp;</p><p>The theme of home has a huge significance in the story for a number of characters, who are seeking a place to belong. Where Dany is concerned, because she has lived her life on the run and because she has internalised Viserys&rsquo; belief that the only place she can feel at home is Westeros in King&rsquo;s Landing and Dragonstone, that becomes her tragedy as she fails to set up roots anywhere she settles, as she looks West. Dany has no roots and therefore, she uproots people wherever she goes, intentionally or not. Theon seems to share this trend initially as he struggles between wanting to hate the Starks for uprooting him from Pyke and his family as a Greyjoy, but he also loves them and wants to be part of them, but cannot be as a ward. As Martin has said, although in a similar situation as Theon as part of the Starks and yet not part of it, Jon avoids becoming like him and acting on his negative feelings. Sansa, Arya and Bran, who despite their varying reasons of feeling out of place in Winterfell, find themselves longing to go back to it as they realise they had more than they realised. Moreover, the Starks&rsquo;&nbsp;connection to Winterfell is through family and it serves as a tether to hold onto humanity and their identity. For Dany, after losing all her family, she grasps onto her dragon eggs and walks into the funeral pyre to hatch them, and when they do, she considers them her children. That unhealthy attachment to something so disastrous to human life is what ultimately could be the final straw in driving Dany to put them before humanity, as this starts from AGOT itself when she asks for her dragon eggs, rather than Rhaego in between her fevered dreams. That is foreboding in hindsight. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Under the influence of a dragon rider, dragons can affect far larger masses than on their own.&nbsp;Whether wanting to use it on the offensive, like Doran, or on the defensive, like Jon, a dragon still cannot be tamed.&nbsp; The North will not be spared as much as he&rsquo;d like, as Dorne will not be. There is even foreshadowing for <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/169075626529/are-dragons-going-to-burn-winterfell\" target=\"_blank\">Dany&rsquo;s dragons burning Winterfell</a> when Summer looks up in the sky during the Sack of Winterfell and considering the line &ldquo;Dragons plant no trees&rdquo;, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Dany&rsquo;s dragons try to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/166285886062/the-heart-tree-of-winterfell-tolkien-influences\" target=\"_blank\">burn Winterfell&rsquo;s heart tree</a> to drive the point home. Perhaps because living wood has &ldquo;power as strong as fire&rdquo;, the heart tree and part of the godswood may be spared, but a large part of Winterfell may not.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Interviewer: The number one question people ask me about the series is whether I think everyone will lose&mdash;whether it will end in some horrible apocalypse. I know you can&rsquo;t speak to that specifically, but as a revisionist of epic fantasy&mdash;&#8232;</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t written the ending yet, so I don&rsquo;t know, but no. That&rsquo;s certainly not my intent. <b>I&rsquo;ve said before that the tone of the ending that I&rsquo;m going for is bittersweet.</b> I mean, it&rsquo;s no secret that Tolkien has been a huge influence on me, and I love the way he ended Lord of the Rings. <b>It ends with victory, but it&rsquo;s a bittersweet victory. </b>Frodo is never whole again, and he goes away to the Undying Lands, and the other people live their lives. <b>And the scouring of the Shire&mdash;brilliant piece of work, which I didn&rsquo;t understand when I was 13 years old: &ldquo;Why is this here? The story&rsquo;s over?&rdquo; But every time I read it I understand the brilliance of that segment more and more.</b> All I can say is that&rsquo;s the kind of tone I will be aiming for. - <a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/08/george-r-r-martins-ending-for-game-of-thrones-will-not-be-as-brutal-as-you-think/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The author has voiced his love for the Scouring of Shire in LOTR a number of times, and said that is the kind of end he is hoping for. The world isn&rsquo;t destroyed, but the Hobbits&rsquo; world is.&nbsp;Winterfell is the most Shire-like place in Westeros, and it has already had the Library Tower burning as part of the attack on Bran, and the Sack of Winterfell. Keeping with <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/175442849800/hi-how-are-you-i-love-your-blog-and-as-you-i\" target=\"_blank\">the pattern of threes</a>&nbsp;in significant locations, it may have to burn once more.&nbsp;It may be that like the Hobbits, the Starks may save the realm, but may not be able to save their home.&nbsp;There would be a kind of symmetry to the Water Gardens and the Glass Gardens being destroyed indirectly because Doran and Jon weaponise dragons for a cause.&nbsp;</p><p>This might be Jon&rsquo;s tragedy as he tries to be the hero (even when he&rsquo;s too tired to be), tries to protect his homeland and the realm, making sacrifices and playing the game, he&nbsp;<i>still </i>fails because he doesn&rsquo;t have enough context and overestimates his ability to keep Dany in check. It may be that despite his resurrection, he isn&rsquo;t some promised hero nor is Dany for hatching her dragons after walking into a funeral pyre. Death doesn&rsquo;t make Jon more powerful, but rather weaker and less of a hero - despite his attempts.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the ending is meant to be bittersweet it may be upon the Starks and their allies to rebuild Westeros from its shambles.&nbsp;Perhaps, the irony would be that Jon, who is a hybrid of a dragon and a wolf, would in fact plant trees in contrast to Dany because he has roots connecting him to people and the land, even after it may be destroyed.&nbsp;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>As some of you may know, I subscribe to the theory that dragons and the fire associated Azor Ahai reborn <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168655191984/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">may not be effective</a> in the war against the Others in the Long Night. People generally assume this means inverting the enemy from the Others to the dragons, and I&rsquo;ve made <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/166317300627/fantasy-antagonists-of-asoiaf-who-are-the-orcs-in#notes\" target=\"_blank\">that mistake too</a> momentarily, but it seems more probable that <i>both</i> extreme fire and extreme ice <a href=\"https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/135888-the-long-night-and-the-great-summer/\" target=\"_blank\">can be harmful</a> to Westeros. There is of course, the apocalyptic implications of the two extremes in Robert Frost&rsquo;s poem <i><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice\" target=\"_blank\">Fire &amp; Ice</a></i>, that Martin <a href=\"http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html\" target=\"_blank\">admits</a> to have influenced his title, but apart from that the author may have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=273&amp;v=GaPZGDlm2F4\" target=\"_blank\">hinted</a> the Others and Dany&rsquo;s dragons being two apocalyptic threats to Westeros.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>[&hellip;]&nbsp;<b>the two outlying ones &mdash; the things going on north of the Wall, and then there is Targaryen on the other continent with her dragons &mdash; are of course the ice and fire of the title, &ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire.&rdquo;</b> The central stuff &mdash; the stuff that&rsquo;s happening in the middle, in King&rsquo;s Landing, the capital of the seven kingdoms &mdash; is much more based on historical events, historical fiction. It&rsquo;s loosely drawn from the Wars of the Roses and some of the other conflicts around the 100 Years&rsquo; War, although, of course, with a fantasy twist. You know, one of the dynamics I started with, there was the sense of people being so consumed by their petty struggles for power within the seven kingdoms, within King&rsquo;s Landing that <b>they&rsquo;re blind to the much greater and more dangerous threats that are happening far away on the periphery of their kingdoms.</b><br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>People tend to assume that in this equation, Dany is the political threat to Westeros corruption, but considering GRRM has equated <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">dragons to nuclear power</a>, a destructive force rather than a constructive one (&rdquo;Dragons plant no trees&rdquo;), this may as well embody the theme of Robert Frost&rsquo;s <i>Fire &amp; Ice. </i>Both can be<i>&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168471722944/the-ice-and-the-fire-of-the-song-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">equally destructive</a> to human life.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<b>Fire is a cruel way to die</b>. Dalla died to give this child life, but you have nourished him, cherished him. <b>You saved your own boy from the ice. Now save hers from the fire.</b>&rdquo; &mdash;Jon II, ADWD</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, a number of characters see the return of dragons as a boon with the interpretations of prophecies like Azor Ahai reborn, the Prince That Was Promised, and the presence of Others and the susceptibility of wights to fire and Jon wishing for dragons as weapons of defence at the Wall. That said,&nbsp;&ldquo;Prophecy is a sword without a hilt&rdquo;, and what may seem like a boon may <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">actually be a nightmare</a>. This is a device that has been used by authors like Tolkien in <i><a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/175569556368/the-azor-ahaismaug-connection\" target=\"_blank\">The Hobbit</a></i>&nbsp;regarding the Esgaroth prophecy and Tad Williams in<i> <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172113783619/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">Memory, Sorrow, Thorn</a>&nbsp;</i>regarding the three<i>&nbsp;</i>magical swords from the title and the prophecy about Paris upon his birth from <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/174047973477/trojan-war-literature-influence-on-grrm\" target=\"_blank\">Trojan War cycle</a><i>,</i> <a href=\"https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/08/george-r-r-martin-i-revere-the-lord-of-the-rings/\" target=\"_blank\">all of</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/17/tropes-trolls-and-trump-meet-one-of-george-rr-martins-favourite-fantasy-writers-tad-williams\" target=\"_blank\">whom</a> Martin has admitted to draw inspiration from in his series.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With all this serving as a framing context, lets get into the main topic of this post without much further ado.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",

He will go down as the man who saved the King and this will be what&rsquo;s written about him in the Kingsguard book.</p><p>All of the remaining members of the Nights Watch will be killed almost immediately and Castle Black will be overtaken. The Night King will make this his first base of operations. The Nights Watch will be no more.</p><p>Daario will lead his sellswords and join Cersei only to turn on her in the name of Dany and attack her forces, but the wights attack while this is happening and Daario and his forces are overtaken, as is King&rsquo;s Landing. </p><p>Cersei will burn down most of King&rsquo;s Landing to kill the invading wights in an act of desperation.</p><p>Arya Stark will kill Cersei Lannister while wearing Jaime Lannister&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Sansa Stark will be killed and raised by the Night King to become his queen.

He will be there to take the child to safety, though.</p><p>Sam and Bran together will tell Jon Snow the truth about his birth and who his real parents are, and he will say that it doesn&rsquo;t change anything.

Missandei and Davos are also members of the new court. Theon is master of ships. Samwell is the Grand Maestor and Bran is an important adviser.  Arya is the King\u2019s Justice.  Drogon and Rhaegal survive and are kept at King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Bronn, who somehow manages to survive all of this in Kings Landing, becomes leader of the gold cloaks.</p><p>The story ends with Bran relating the entire story to Samwell, who is writing it down to be kept in the library in Old Town.</p><p>Did I miss anything?</p><p>So this isn&rsquo;t spoilers or anything. It&rsquo;s just what I think could go down based on what we know. A lot of this probably will happen, or at least something similar. I think this story will be cool regardless. Definitely bittersweet, like GRRM said it would be.</p><p>It&rsquo;s obviously missing a lot of details. For instance, I think Bran is going to learn some huge secret about the Night King and the Others that will help Jon defeat them. I also think that the Children of the Forest will make a return and we may learn more about the history of Westeros and the Targaryens. There&rsquo;s also going to be something in the Winterfell crypts that somehow impacts the story.

I don\u2019t have any inside information or anything. There are no spoilers for people who\u2019ve seen up through the current season.</p><p>Dany will get pregnant and die in childbirth, so it will be Jon Snow who rides Drogon in the final showdown with the Night King. Bran will ride Rhaegal on a saddle designed by Tyrion. The showdown has to be between Jon and Bran against the Night King. A good writer will always make the climax involve characters who have history together fighting. Jon and Bran both have history with the Night King, so they will be the ones there to fight him in the end, on the backs of dragons.</p><p>Jaime Lannister will die sacrificing himself to save Jon Snow. He will go down as the man who saved the King and this will be what\u2019s written about him in the Kingsguard book.</p><p>All of the remaining members of the Nights Watch will be killed almost immediately and Castle Black will be overtaken. The Night King will make this his first base of operations. The Nights Watch will be no more.</p><p>Daario will lead his sellswords and join Cersei only to turn on her in the name of Dany and attack her forces, but the wights attack while this is happening and Daario and his forces are overtaken, as is King\u2019s Landing. </p><p>Cersei will burn down most of King\u2019s Landing to kill the invading wights in an act of desperation.</p><p>Arya Stark will kill Cersei Lannister while wearing Jaime Lannister\u2019s face.</p><p>Sansa Stark will be killed and raised by the Night King to become his queen. Jon Snow will have to kill her.</p><p>The Mountain and the Hound will fight and they will kill each other.</p><p>Brienne of Tarth and Tormund will die fighting together on the battlefield against the Others and the wights. Beric and his men will also die in this battle.</p><p>Jorah Mormont will be at Dany\u2019s side when she dies of childbirth, saddened that he can do nothing to help her. He will be there to take the child to safety, though.</p><p>Sam and Bran together will tell Jon Snow the truth about his birth and who his real parents are, and he will say that it doesn\u2019t change anything. He\u2019s still the King in the North fighting for Dany and she is his Queen.</p><p>Greywater Watch will put up a good fight, but the castle, along with Howland and Meera, will go down against the Others and their hoards.</p><p>Theon will kill Euron, but not before Euron kills Yara. Theon becomes the new king of the Iron Islands.</p><p>Melisandre burns Gendry alive to increase Jon Snow\u2019s power. Jon finds out about it and beheads Melisandre on Dragonstone. From this moment on, his sword burns with flames.</p><p>Jon also beheads Varys on Dragonstone because he helps Melisandre capture Gendry. He is convinced it will give Jon great power when she shows him a vision in the flames. </p><p>Davos is tasked with helping keep Jon and Dany\u2019s baby safe, he travels with Tyrion, Jorah, and Missandei to Essos to stay with Illyrio until the fighting is over. They decide that if anything happens to Jon, Tyrion, who is hand of the queen, will be the child\u2019s regent.</p><p>Jon Snow defeats the Night King with Bran\u2019s help, but Jon is mortally wounded and dies. The Army of the Undead is defeated and gone from Westeros forever.</p><p>Tyrion, Davos, Jorah, and Missandei return to what\u2019s left of King\u2019s Landing with the baby King. Tyrion rules as regent in the child\u2019s stead until the baby is old enough. Jorah is the leader of his Kingsguard, honoring Dany\u2019s memory by protecting her son. Missandei and Davos are also members of the new court. Theon is master of ships. Samwell is the Grand Maestor and Bran is an important adviser.  Arya is the King\u2019s Justice.  Drogon and Rhaegal survive and are kept at King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Bronn, who somehow manages to survive all of this in Kings Landing, becomes leader of the gold cloaks.</p><p>The story ends with Bran relating the entire story to Samwell, who is writing it down to be kept in the library in Old Town.</p><p>Did I miss anything?</p><p>So this isn\u2019t spoilers or anything.

It&rsquo;s his lips, swollen from kisses and whispered words of passionate encouragement still resonating like an unfinished symphony in the aftermath of their consummation.</p><p>It&rsquo;s in lashes that seem to flutter before lifting slowly to reveal eyes of deepest grey &ndash; like lurking thunderstorm skies &ndash; eventually morphing into orbs of warm recognition.</p><p>She holds her breath, pencil poised in mid-flight to its destination. She wonders if she can conjure up a suitable excuse, of why she chooses to sketch him in such a state, barely covered by her favorite quilt while she sits crossed-legged as nude as her name day studying him in silence.</p><p>However, coherent thought becomes elusive when the low raspy words rumble off his chest, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m in love with you, Dany&hellip; and I&rsquo;m terrified.&rdquo;</p><p>She forgets to breathe.</p><p>And he smiles. Shy. Hopeful. Wondering&hellip;perhaps&hellip;maybe&hellip;while her heart soars and the world seems to tilt on its axis and a choir of angels begin to sing somewhere in the back-</p><p>But she blinks and reality returns with the ragged sound of a light snore and a repose still unbroken.</p><p>It had all been in her head, those whispered words a reflection of what she can never say out loud. She places a hand upon her chest in which a quivering heart continues to beat in rhythm to what should have been. He isn&rsquo;t hers, she knows. He belongs to many, and her time is limited. It is foolhardy to feel this way, yes, <i>terrifying</i> to know he affects her this much.</p><p>But -</p><p><i>Perhaps someday,</i> she muses as she adds a finishing stroke to her most precious work yet, tucks the sketchbook aside, and curls into his sinewy warmth again. With a finger, she traces the broad expanse of his chest before drawing a large heart around his right breast. It is punctuated with her name scribbled within the invisible shape, and she blushes at her silly antics.</p><p>She knows her limitations and struggles against them every day, a fight she is no longer willing to give up. For someday, those words <i>will</i> break free from their internal prison to serenade him with a truth no longer capable of remaining hidden in her veil of tormented silence.</p><p><i>Someday.</i></p></p>",
