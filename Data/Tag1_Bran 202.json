He told Sansa she looked beautiful at her wedding after all - and unless he was talking about a possible future wedding - this was a very inconsiderate thing to do. This emotional detachment is quite different from BookBran by the way and I miss BookBran very much.

                "content": "<p>Please note: this is <i>not</i> a criticism of Bran in any way. </p><p>Re-reading Bran&rsquo;s ACOK POV chapters, I came to wonder\nif the author wasn&rsquo;t slipping some subtle criticism of the feudal &ldquo;wheel&rdquo;\neveryone seems to be talking about. Anyway, there&rsquo;s two things I&rsquo;d like to talk\nabout here: the distribution of resources and characterization of the peasant\nclass.</p><p><b>The distribution of resources</b></p><p><i>The serving men brought every dish to Bran first, that he might take the\nlord&rsquo;s portion if he chose. By the time they reached the ducks, he could eat no\nmore. After that he nodded approval at each course in turn, and waved it away.\nIf the dish smelled especially choice, he would send it to one of the lords on\nthe dais, a gesture of friendship and favor that Maester Luwin told him he must\nmake. He sent some salmon down to poor sad Lady Hornwood, the boar to the\nboisterous Umbers, a dish of goose-in-berries to Cley Cerwyn, and a huge\nlobster to Joseth the master of horse, who was neither lord nor guest, but had\nseen to Dancer&rsquo;s training and made it possible for Bran to ride. He sent sweets\nto Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them.

But for me, I felt Bran may very well have seen what Sansa went through, and he tells her he's sorry she had to go through such horrors in their own home. His emotional senses are very dulled now and his sense of propriety has gone down too (like how he dismissed Meera the way he did), yet he still had enough to let Sansa know he understands she went through hell and empathized with her plight.",

Did Sansa express a need to hear someone tell her they empathised with her because of that? If they had written that scene it would have at least shown Bran trying to reach out through the wall of incalculable knowledge he has acquired. At least because of that scene no one can accuse Sansa of stealing his inheritance or anything and despite the show barely featuring Bran I did like the other scenes that they shared. Hopefully S8 will bring more Sansa and Bran because he\u2019s her favourite brother.</p>",
