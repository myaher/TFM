        "answer": "<p>Interesting that it\u2019s still the only nomination Andi Mack received, meanwhile Raven\u2019s Home and Bunk\u2019d got nominations in both the favorite actor categories (alongside Peyton) as well as favorite show categories, which Andi Mack did not get nominated for. Also interesting that Karan Brar would be the only male Disney Channel star nominated for favorite actor when Asher Angel exists. Looks very much like Disney could be prioritizing the focus toward the shows that are already confirmed for renewal (Bunk\u2019d, Raven\u2019s Home) but they haven\u2019t completely let go of AM yet either so. Yeah. I don\u2019t know what, if anything, it means, but it\u2019s still interesting.</p><p>I mean, like I\u2019ve said before - Kids Choice Awards are bullshit. The nominees and winners are mostly based on who agrees to be a part of the show, or whose management is willing to pay for the award. Since she is nominated alongside Raven, Millie, and Zendaya - it\u2019s safe to assume that if any of them attend the awards, Peyton probably will not win. But at the very least hopefully she will still attend the awards (she has in the past without being nominated so) and maybe some of the other cast members will come along just because so that\u2019ll be fun because content. I think it\u2019s around the same time as the GLAAD Awards so hopefully we\u2019ll be well fed that week.</p>",

The earrings were painted to look like the lesbian flag and Amber\u2019s smile grew two sizes.

It was the first place the hung out without anything major happened. It was where Amber had taken Andi on their first date, and it was where they had their first kiss.

It consisted of Caprese sandwiches, potato salad, strawberry yogurt salad cups, strawberry lemon cookies, a bottle of sparkling grape cider, and Cookie\u2019s name cookies(via the overnight postal service in honor of the girls\u2019 six month anniversary). It was the first homemade meal either of them had had in a while, Andi\u2019s family usually too lazy and Amber usually out with her friends or Andi, so they both thoroughly enjoyed the meal. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>After that, they lay together on the blanket Andi had knitted when she was first learning and watched a bunch of cheesy rom-coms on Amber\u2019s computer. They weren\u2019t really watching them though, more invested in talking about Andi\u2019s newest project. The younger girl was working on a mural that she and Walker had gotten permission to paint on one of the school\u2019s walls. </p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do\u201d, the girl was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s like I have too many ideas in my head, you know?\u2019</p><p>Amber nodded her head as she watched her girlfriend ramble on, a twinkle in her eye that only appeared when she was talking about art. Amber remembered the first craft Andi had made her after they had started dating. Amber had been walking to her locker, kept up the night before by her parent\u2019s insistent arguing. Coffee seemed to have no effect and she had at least two tests that day. She was screwed.</p><p>When she opened her locker, she saw a small box sitting on the middle shelf, a post-it note stuck on top. Amber had pulled it out slowly and examined the note. It said: Happy two weeks, babe. ~Andi. Amber smiled as she opened the small box to see to round glass earrings. The earrings were painted to look like the lesbian flag and Amber\u2019s smile grew two sizes. She had been telling Andi how she had been trying to find more LGBT+ jewelry, but the two stores in this town were punk and preppy, so Amber had resigned herself to scouring the internet. Who knew they had such good shipping? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Amber took out the small gold hoops she had put in that day and traded them for her girlfriend\u2019s considerate gift. After checking herself once in the small magnet mirror in her locker, she grabbed her books and headed to class. She aced all THREE of her tests that day, empowered by pure lesbian energy and love pouring from her earrings. </p><p>Amber smiled softly at the memory. They were the first of many pride jewelry as more and more of their friends came out, but they were the only ones that Amber knew of that seemed to have magical powers. She reached up to rub the smooth glass of them now as Andi looked at her expectantly. Oh, she had missed something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d, Amber asked, coming out of her trance. Andi huffed but repeated the question.\u201cDo you want to start heading back? It\u2019s getting kind of dark. And cold\u201d, Andi added with a shiver. Amber grinned and pulled her girlfriend closer, wrapping her and her in her arms. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Bambi, I\u2019ll keep you warm\u201d, she answered pressing a kiss to the younger girls lips. They continued to trade kisses as the moon rose over them and shone down on the lake.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you\u201d, Andi murmured against Amber\u2019s lips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d, Amber breathed, surprised. It took a moment for Andi to realize what she said, but when she remembered, a blush spread across her chicks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry\u201d, she stuttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say that out loud, I\u2019ve just been thinking about it a lot recently and I really like you I-I, I love you.\u201d Andi raised her eyes hesitantly to Amber\u2019s scared of what she might see. But Amber was beaming. She had been wanting to hear, wanted to say, those words for months now. She gave the shy girl another deep kiss.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Andi. So much.\u201d The girl broke out into a huge smile and Amber knew that she had never seen anything she loved more.\u00a0</p>",
