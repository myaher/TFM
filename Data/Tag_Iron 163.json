I am so so so sorry for how late I am but finally my gift for you for the Pepperony gift exchange  is here! I hope you\u2019re well and having a great start to the new year! And I really hope you like the story \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"peppperpotts:hLljeDGRB5hUNJRZu3VYug:Z1EhGt2eXmnBK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2229b08fcf09d7a0de0cf7e7d9a1aa87/tumblr_pjg8dnnq3M1s3qhcao2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i><b>Together</b></i> (A Pepperony Fan Fic)</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you off to Stark?&rdquo; Natasha quirked a brow having followed her billionaire as he attempted to sneak away unnoticed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you to shy from a celebration,&rdquo; she remarked, genuinely curious about how Tony intended to spend the evening if not with the rest of the team. The Avengers had just succeeded with another mission and were taking the time to mark their achievements at the insistence of Thor.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you succumbed to stalking me now Romanoff?&rdquo; Tony rolled his eyes, stopping mid-step and turned on his heel in the direction of the woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Sorry to disappoint, but there&rsquo;s another red head who&rsquo;s waiting for me at home,&rdquo; he explained with a shrug, putting on one of his many signature sunglasses as he prepared to leave. Noticing the impressed smirk on Natasha&rsquo;s expression. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, look who&rsquo;s becoming domesticated,&rdquo; the spy quipped in manner that convinced Tony she was congratulating him on his decision not to join the festivities.</p><p>The billionaire sighed and couldn&rsquo;t help the small smile that graced his handsome features as his mind was filled with thoughts about his fianc\u00e9e. He deemed himself the luckiest man alive that Pepper was soon to be his wife and he her husband. There was no one like Pepper in Tony&rsquo;s life and he didn&rsquo;t want anyone else but her. She was the light and happiness in his oh so complicated life. </p><p><i>It&rsquo;s always been her</i>.</p><p>However, like a lot of things in Tony&rsquo;s life, their love story wasn&rsquo;t without it&rsquo;s problems. &ldquo;I suppose, but that&rsquo;s not a bad thing,&rdquo; he chuckled as he left to his car outside. Pepper was worth it. Tony would do anything for the love of his life, he had proven just that many times. Like getting rid of all his suits - albeit for a period of time - and signing the Accords. The only reason he signed was to try and make things right with Pepper. It had broken him when they split up, like a knife to the gut.</p><p>But now wasn&rsquo;t the time to think about what happened. It was in the past and the couple were in a better place now, heck they were about to get married in a matter of months after deciding that a summer wedding would be perfect. </p><p>It took about an hour for Tony to drive home to the Malibu mansion he made sure to get rebuilt\u00a0 after the incident with the Mandarin. &ldquo;Pep?&rdquo; he called, wearing a sweet smile on his expression when he spotted the love of his life asleep on the couch. It was a moment that didn&rsquo;t happen often which made it all the more sweeter. </p><p>&rsquo;<i>She&rsquo;s so adorable when she&rsquo;s asleep</i>&rsquo; </p><p>Tony gently ran his fingers through Pepper&rsquo;s gorgeous strawberry blonde hair, his hand lightly brushing against her cheek as he crouched down beside the couch. Admiring her. At his touch to her cheek, Pepper&rsquo;s blue eyes fluttered open, her soft gaze meeting the caramel eyes she grew to love. The eyes of the man she hoped to spend the rest of her life with. &ldquo;Hmm.. you&rsquo;re late,&rdquo; she greeted, placing a soft but loving kiss to Tony&rsquo;s lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry honey, I got caught up at work,&rdquo; Tony replied with a silent chuckle. &ldquo;But tonight I&rsquo;m all yours, and I intend to make it up to you,&rdquo; he whispered near Pepper&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; she laughed, leaning her head onto Tony&rsquo;s, lightly letting out a giggle when he nuzzled his nose against hers. &ldquo;But first.. we need to talk, it&rsquo;s important,&rdquo; she pointed, nervously biting her bottom lip in anticipation.</p><p>The billionaire&rsquo;s puppy dog gaze lit up with curiosity. A small pout of disappointment in response to Pepper&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learnt Whenever a woman says that I&rsquo;m rarely in for a good time,&rdquo; he added jokingly, tilting his head as he searched for answers. What could she want to talk about that made her come across as nervous?</p><p>&ldquo;What if I said this time it&rsquo;s going to be different?&rdquo; Pepper offered, quirking a brow. She always did enjoy the loving banter the two shared.</p><p>&ldquo;In which case, all I can say to that is, surprise me,&rdquo; Tony smirked lightheartedly, still crouched down by the couch. His fingers getting lost in his fianc\u00e9e&rsquo;s locks. &ldquo;What is it Pep?&rdquo; he asked, trying to encourage Pepper to open up. Needing to know what she was planning to tell him.</p><p>Pepper knew life was never going to be normal being in a relationship with Tony. But they were deeply in love, and anyway, what exactly was normal? She loved Tony and quite frankly life wouldn&rsquo;t be so eventful if he was any different. But how would he react to the news? &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s certainly a way we can surprise you,&rdquo; she replied in the hope that the genius would pick up on her choice of words. Her heart quickening as she waited for his reaction. Especially after how often Tony had been talking about them having a family of their own recently and she wanted him to be the first person she told. As the father, he deserved that. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh really? What did you have-..&rdquo; Tony began, letting his words trail off in realisation and looked at Pepper as he deduced what she was trying to say. He was both shocked and undeniably amazed. &ldquo;Are you.. Pepper.. are we going to have a baby?&rdquo; </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t need even need to say a word for Tony to read the answer from Pepper&rsquo;s wide smile and teary eyes of elation, a reflection of his own expression as he leaned forward, closing the gap between them with a searing kiss. For years, after losing his parents, Tony had been alone, going from women to women in nothing more than one night stands. Until he fell in love with Pepper. He had no other family and never thought he ever would, but now Pepper was giving him love and a family of their own. &ldquo;I love you, Miss Potts,&rdquo; Tony whispered breathlessly when the two needed to break the kiss for air. His hand moving down to stroke Pepper&rsquo;s flat stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Mr Stark,&rdquo; she added coyly, kissing him again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be a mother and father to little kid..&rdquo;</p><p>Tony couldn&rsquo;t help at that moment but to lower his gaze as a wave of insecurity wash over him. What if he wasn&rsquo;t cut out to be father? What if he let his son or daughter down?  Especially since Howard was the only example he had to follow off from about how to be a father. That wasn&rsquo;t the sort of life Tony wanted to be for his child. &ldquo;Pep I want this, truly I do,&rdquo; he began, knowing he could always open up to Pepper. She was the only he could. She was honestly the only one to understand him and see the real Tony Stark, the side of him behind the front he put on. The side that no one else saw. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just scared.. Scared that I won&rsquo;t be a good father, or even worse that I&rsquo;ll end up like my dad..&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Anthony Edward Stark, it&rsquo;s okay to be nervous, don&rsquo;t you think I am? We&rsquo;re going to be parents for the first time, it&rsquo;s rather daunting,&rdquo; Pepper cupped Tony&rsquo;s cheeks, getting him to look at her again. She understood his concerns, given his childhood. But she needed him to know she believed in him. In them. &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t have to worry about following in your father&rsquo;s footsteps, because you&rsquo;re not like him at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re the only one who thinks that,&rdquo; Tony sighed with a downcast look, he may have been an armoured superhero but what if he failed the kid? His own flesh and blood?</p><p>&ldquo;That means my opinion should be the only one that matters to you,&rdquo; Pepper offered, kissing Tony&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;And I know you&rsquo;ll be a great father, because you can deny it all you want but you are kind, caring, loyal to the ones you loves and not to mention you&rsquo;ll do anything to protect everyone all around the world, you&rsquo;re a brilliant role model. And I love you.&rdquo; Truthfully, Pepper couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better father for her child than the man who stole her heart.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do this together alright..?&rdquo; Tony whispered, a hand sliding back down to Pepper&rsquo;s stomach. &ldquo;You, me&hellip;and the baby..&rdquo; He exhaled deeply, the nerves threatening to take over him.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Our</i> baby,&rdquo; Pepper corrected sweetly.</p><p>As the months went by, Tony had been eager to start work on making the nursery for their little Baby Stark. That day, Pepper was just over twenty weeks pregnant and her bump was very much showing, much to the happiness of the proud expectant parents. They had recently discovered the gender of baby which only made Tony and Pepper more excited for the arrival of their darling Tori Maria Stark. </p><p>After being invited by Tony, Peter Parker was staying over at the mansion with May in tow for the weekend. While the older Parker was partaking in a sightseeing tour while the teenager and Tony worked on repairing an old car and it\u2019s engine together. To someone who didn\u2019t know any better, one would think without a doubt that the pair were father and son.</p><p>\u201cPete, can you pass me the wrench?\u201d He called to Peter, sliding out from beneath the car where he had been trying to fix an oil leak and wiped his forehead which only made the oil smudge across it worse. Not that Tony cared right now as he and his \u2018prot\u00e9g\u00e9e\u2019 tinkered on a new project together. </p><p>\u201cOf course Mr Stark,\u201d Peter nodded and handed Tony the tool he needed before quickly getting back to the repair he was almost finished on. \u201cThe cylinders don\u2019t seem to be blocked anymore sir, I\u2019m just going to make sure they\u2019re well lubricated,\u201d he explained, using the car lubricant onto the the cylinder walls and piston-pin bearings by the rotating crankshaft of the engine.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a plan kid, and once I\u2019ve finished up on this remaining leak, what do you say we test the fruits of our labours?\u201d Tony suggested, taking the wrench before he went back underneath the car to continue the repair. He always enjoyed working like this with the kid and Tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder what it was going to be like with his daughter. Just because Tori was a girl didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t going to teach her everything he knew when she was older and figured Pepper wouldn\u2019t mind. </p><p>Soon the duo had completed all the required tasks for the car and it was time to test whether the engine would run. \u201cWe did it Mr Stark, we fixed it, this is so cool!\u201d Peter cheered, he couldn\u2019t wait to tell his aunt of his and Tony\u2019s achievement when she returned later that day.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so surprised kid, after all, we make a great team,\u201d Tony smiled with pride akin to that of a father as he patted Peter on the back which made the teenager beam happily. The boy really was like a son to Tony. \u201cYou and I should next work on a new suit for you, I think you\u2019re ready,\u201d the genius nodded as if already having decided their next project and Peter couldn\u2019t be more excited for it. To have the chance to work on making his own Spider-Man suit with Tony Stark.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah.. er, wow, Mr Stark that would be great,\u201d Peter mentally scolded himself for stammering when he was taken by surprise at hearing his role model\u2019s offer. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d </p><p>Neither of the two noticed how Pepper had joined Tony and Peter in the workshop. Watching them by the door as they worked. She smiled fondly at how they interacted with one another and closed her eyes for a moment. Picturing in her mind\u2019s eye Tony and Tori in the workshop together in the years to come. The very thought bought a heartwarming smile to her face. \u201cThe two of you look like you\u2019re having fun,\u201d she spoke out, deciding to finally announce her presence. </p><p>\u201cOh Pep hey, Pete and I have just finished repairing the car,\u201d Tony grinned and held his arm out for Pepper, nothing but admiration for her in his expression. </p><p>\u201cReally? And you managed to get it to work?\u201d She teased lightheartedly and stepped closer to the man she loved unconditionally, letting him hug her as she leaned into him. </p><p>\u201cOf course, we were going to take it out for a test drive later,\u201d Tony confirmed, quickly picking up on Pepper\u2019s teasing tone. \u201cI\u2019m never wrong when it comes to things like this,\u201d he winked. </p><p>Peter looked between the two, not wanting to intrude in the moment. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go call Ned, he\u2019s going to want to know about the car,\u201d he suggested with his usual teenage awkwardness and went upstairs, taking out his phone once Tony assured him he\u2019ll come up and check on Peter shortly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re great with him Tony,\u201d Pepper complimented, resting her head onto his shoulder. Smiling softly at his touch to her baby bump. \u201cPeter really looks up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I told you before he\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Tony replied with a content sigh and was about to say something else before feeling  their little girl kick against Pepper\u2019s stomach. \u201cOh hey there, is our little girl awake?\u201d He asked in a sincerely sweet tone and knelt down to speak to the baby and smiled more when Tori kicked again. \u201cYes, your mommy is amazing isn\u2019t she? And I know for a fact you\u2019re going to be just as amazing.\u201d he continued, having a conversation with the unborn baby. Tony truly loved Pepper and had no doubt Tori would be just as perfect. His love for their baby was unconditional and always growing and it was clear for anyone to see.</p><p>It made Pepper\u2019s heart swell as she heard Tony talk to their child and the baby kicking to his voice. This was more than what she could have ever dreamed of or wanted. After all the ups and downs they had been through together, it was all worth it for them to be in the perfect situation they now had. Seeing Tony with Peter earlier and now how he treated the baby, she had no doubt that he would be a great father and it only made her love for him grow tenfold. One thing was for sure, their future was truly looking bright for the three of them. </p>",

The Avengers had just succeeded with another mission and were taking the time to mark their achievements at the insistence of Thor.</p><p>\u201cHave you succumbed to stalking me now Romanoff?\u201d Tony rolled his eyes, stopping mid-step and turned on his heel in the direction of the woman\u2019s voice. \u201cSorry to disappoint, but there\u2019s another red head who\u2019s waiting for me at home,\u201d he explained with a shrug, putting on one of his many signature sunglasses as he prepared to leave. Noticing the impressed smirk on Natasha\u2019s expression. </p><p>\u201cWell, well, look who\u2019s becoming domesticated,\u201d the spy quipped in manner that convinced Tony she was congratulating him on his decision not to join the festivities.</p><p>The billionaire sighed and couldn\u2019t help the small smile that graced his handsome features as his mind was filled with thoughts about his fianc\u00e9e. He deemed himself the luckiest man alive that Pepper was soon to be his wife and he her husband. There was no one like Pepper in Tony\u2019s life and he didn\u2019t want anyone else but her. She was the light and happiness in his oh so complicated life. </p><p><i>It\u2019s always been her</i>.</p><p>However, like a lot of things in Tony\u2019s life, their love story wasn\u2019t without it\u2019s problems. \u201cI suppose, but that\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d he chuckled as he left to his car outside. Pepper was worth it. Tony would do anything for the love of his life, he had proven just that many times. Like getting rid of all his suits - albeit for a period of time - and signing the Accords. The only reason he signed was to try and make things right with Pepper. It had broken him when they split up, like a knife to the gut.</p><p>But now wasn\u2019t the time to think about what happened. It was in the past and the couple were in a better place now, heck they were about to get married in a matter of months after deciding that a summer wedding would be perfect. </p><p>It took about an hour for Tony to drive home to the Malibu mansion he made sure to get rebuilt\u00a0 after the incident with the Mandarin. \u201cPep?\u201d he called, wearing a sweet smile on his expression when he spotted the love of his life asleep on the couch. It was a moment that didn\u2019t happen often which made it all the more sweeter. </p><p>\u2019<i>She\u2019s so adorable when she\u2019s asleep</i>\u2019 </p><p>Tony gently ran his fingers through Pepper\u2019s gorgeous strawberry blonde hair, his hand lightly brushing against her cheek as he crouched down beside the couch. Admiring her. At his touch to her cheek, Pepper\u2019s blue eyes fluttered open, her soft gaze meeting the caramel eyes she grew to love. The eyes of the man she hoped to spend the rest of her life with. \u201cHmm.. you\u2019re late,\u201d she greeted, placing a soft but loving kiss to Tony\u2019s lips. </p><p>\u201cSorry honey, I got caught up at work,\u201d Tony replied with a silent chuckle. \u201cBut tonight I\u2019m all yours, and I intend to make it up to you,\u201d he whispered near Pepper\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it,\u201d she laughed, leaning her head onto Tony\u2019s, lightly letting out a giggle when he nuzzled his nose against hers. \u201cBut first.. we need to talk, it\u2019s important,\u201d she pointed, nervously biting her bottom lip in anticipation.</p><p>The billionaire\u2019s puppy dog gaze lit up with curiosity. A small pout of disappointment in response to Pepper\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt Whenever a woman says that I\u2019m rarely in for a good time,\u201d he added jokingly, tilting his head as he searched for answers. What could she want to talk about that made her come across as nervous?</p><p>\u201cWhat if I said this time it\u2019s going to be different?\u201d Pepper offered, quirking a brow. She always did enjoy the loving banter the two shared.</p><p>\u201cIn which case, all I can say to that is, surprise me,\u201d Tony smirked lightheartedly, still crouched down by the couch. His fingers getting lost in his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s locks. \u201cWhat is it Pep?\u201d he asked, trying to encourage Pepper to open up. Needing to know what she was planning to tell him.</p><p>Pepper knew life was never going to be normal being in a relationship with Tony. But they were deeply in love, and anyway, what exactly was normal? She loved Tony and quite frankly life wouldn\u2019t be so eventful if he was any different. But how would he react to the news? \u201cWell I\u2019m sure there\u2019s certainly a way we can surprise you,\u201d she replied in the hope that the genius would pick up on her choice of words. Her heart quickening as she waited for his reaction. Especially after how often Tony had been talking about them having a family of their own recently and she wanted him to be the first person she told. As the father, he deserved that. </p><p>\u201cOh really? What did you have-..\u201d Tony began, letting his words trail off in realisation and looked at Pepper as he deduced what she was trying to say. He was both shocked and undeniably amazed. \u201cAre you.. Pepper.. are we going to have a baby?\u201d </p><p>She didn\u2019t need even need to say a word for Tony to read the answer from Pepper\u2019s wide smile and teary eyes of elation, a reflection of his own expression as he leaned forward, closing the gap between them with a searing kiss. For years, after losing his parents, Tony had been alone, going from women to women in nothing more than one night stands. Until he fell in love with Pepper. He had no other family and never thought he ever would, but now Pepper was giving him love and a family of their own. \u201cI love you, Miss Potts,\u201d Tony whispered breathlessly when the two needed to break the kiss for air. His hand moving down to stroke Pepper\u2019s flat stomach. </p><p>\u201cI love you too Mr Stark,\u201d she added coyly, kissing him again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a mother and father to little kid..\u201d</p><p>Tony couldn\u2019t help at that moment but to lower his gaze as a wave of insecurity wash over him. What if he wasn\u2019t cut out to be father? What if he let his son or daughter down?  Especially since Howard was the only example he had to follow off from about how to be a father. That wasn\u2019t the sort of life Tony wanted to be for his child. \u201cPep I want this, truly I do,\u201d he began, knowing he could always open up to Pepper. She was the only he could. She was honestly the only one to understand him and see the real Tony Stark, the side of him behind the front he put on. The side that no one else saw. \u201cI\u2019m just scared.. Scared that I won\u2019t be a good father, or even worse that I\u2019ll end up like my dad..\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnthony Edward Stark, it\u2019s okay to be nervous, don\u2019t you think I am? We\u2019re going to be parents for the first time, it\u2019s rather daunting,\u201d Pepper cupped Tony\u2019s cheeks, getting him to look at her again. She understood his concerns, given his childhood. But she needed him to know she believed in him. In them. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t have to worry about following in your father\u2019s footsteps, because you\u2019re not like him at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re the only one who thinks that,\u201d Tony sighed with a downcast look, he may have been an armoured superhero but what if he failed the kid? His own flesh and blood?</p><p>\u201cThat means my opinion should be the only one that matters to you,\u201d Pepper offered, kissing Tony\u2019s cheek. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019ll be a great father, because you can deny it all you want but you are kind, caring, loyal to the ones you loves and not to mention you\u2019ll do anything to protect everyone all around the world, you\u2019re a brilliant role model. And I love you.\u201d Truthfully, Pepper couldn\u2019t ask for a better father for her child than the man who stole her heart.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do this together alright..?\u201d Tony whispered, a hand sliding back down to Pepper\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou, me\u2026and the baby..\u201d He exhaled deeply, the nerves threatening to take over him.</p><p>\u201c<i>Our</i> baby,\u201d Pepper corrected sweetly.</p><p>As the months went by, Tony had been eager to start work on making the nursery for their little Baby Stark. That day, Pepper was just over twenty weeks pregnant and her bump was very much showing, much to the happiness of the proud expectant parents. They had recently discovered the gender of baby which only made Tony and Pepper more excited for the arrival of their darling Tori Maria Stark. </p><p>After being invited by Tony, Peter Parker was staying over at the mansion with May in tow for the weekend. While the older Parker was partaking in a sightseeing tour while the teenager and Tony worked on repairing an old car and it\u2019s engine together. To someone who didn\u2019t know any better, one would think without a doubt that the pair were father and son.</p><p>\u201cPete, can you pass me the wrench?\u201d He called to Peter, sliding out from beneath the car where he had been trying to fix an oil leak and wiped his forehead which only made the oil smudge across it worse. Not that Tony cared right now as he and his \u2018prot\u00e9g\u00e9e\u2019 tinkered on a new project together. </p><p>\u201cOf course Mr Stark,\u201d Peter nodded and handed Tony the tool he needed before quickly getting back to the repair he was almost finished on. \u201cThe cylinders don\u2019t seem to be blocked anymore sir, I\u2019m just going to make sure they\u2019re well lubricated,\u201d he explained, using the car lubricant onto the the cylinder walls and piston-pin bearings by the rotating crankshaft of the engine.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a plan kid, and once I\u2019ve finished up on this remaining leak, what do you say we test the fruits of our labours?\u201d Tony suggested, taking the wrench before he went back underneath the car to continue the repair. He always enjoyed working like this with the kid and Tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder what it was going to be like with his daughter. Just because Tori was a girl didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t going to teach her everything he knew when she was older and figured Pepper wouldn\u2019t mind. </p><p>Soon the duo had completed all the required tasks for the car and it was time to test whether the engine would run. \u201cWe did it Mr Stark, we fixed it, this is so cool!\u201d Peter cheered, he couldn\u2019t wait to tell his aunt of his and Tony\u2019s achievement when she returned later that day.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so surprised kid, after all, we make a great team,\u201d Tony smiled with pride akin to that of a father as he patted Peter on the back which made the teenager beam happily. The boy really was like a son to Tony. \u201cYou and I should next work on a new suit for you, I think you\u2019re ready,\u201d the genius nodded as if already having decided their next project and Peter couldn\u2019t be more excited for it. To have the chance to work on making his own Spider-Man suit with Tony Stark.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah.. er, wow, Mr Stark that would be great,\u201d Peter mentally scolded himself for stammering when he was taken by surprise at hearing his role model\u2019s offer. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d </p><p>Neither of the two noticed how Pepper had joined Tony and Peter in the workshop. Watching them by the door as they worked. She smiled fondly at how they interacted with one another and closed her eyes for a moment. Picturing in her mind\u2019s eye Tony and Tori in the workshop together in the years to come. The very thought bought a heartwarming smile to her face. \u201cThe two of you look like you\u2019re having fun,\u201d she spoke out, deciding to finally announce her presence. </p><p>\u201cOh Pep hey, Pete and I have just finished repairing the car,\u201d Tony grinned and held his arm out for Pepper, nothing but admiration for her in his expression. </p><p>\u201cReally? And you managed to get it to work?\u201d She teased lightheartedly and stepped closer to the man she loved unconditionally, letting him hug her as she leaned into him. </p><p>\u201cOf course, we were going to take it out for a test drive later,\u201d Tony confirmed, quickly picking up on Pepper\u2019s teasing tone. \u201cI\u2019m never wrong when it comes to things like this,\u201d he winked. </p><p>Peter looked between the two, not wanting to intrude in the moment. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go call Ned, he\u2019s going to want to know about the car,\u201d he suggested with his usual teenage awkwardness and went upstairs, taking out his phone once Tony assured him he\u2019ll come up and check on Peter shortly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re great with him Tony,\u201d Pepper complimented, resting her head onto his shoulder. Smiling softly at his touch to her baby bump. \u201cPeter really looks up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I told you before he\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Tony replied with a content sigh and was about to say something else before feeling  their little girl kick against Pepper\u2019s stomach. \u201cOh hey there, is our little girl awake?\u201d He asked in a sincerely sweet tone and knelt down to speak to the baby and smiled more when Tori kicked again. \u201cYes, your mommy is amazing isn\u2019t she? And I know for a fact you\u2019re going to be just as amazing.\u201d he continued, having a conversation with the unborn baby. Tony truly loved Pepper and had no doubt Tori would be just as perfect. His love for their baby was unconditional and always growing and it was clear for anyone to see.</p><p>It made Pepper\u2019s heart swell as she heard Tony talk to their child and the baby kicking to his voice. This was more than what she could have ever dreamed of or wanted. After all the ups and downs they had been through together, it was all worth it for them to be in the perfect situation they now had. Seeing Tony with Peter earlier and now how he treated the baby, she had no doubt that he would be a great father and it only made her love for him grow tenfold. One thing was for sure, their future was truly looking bright for the three of them. </p></p>",

His hand moving down to stroke Pepper\u2019s flat stomach. </p><p>\u201cI love you too Mr Stark,\u201d she added coyly, kissing him again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a mother and father to little kid..\u201d</p><p>Tony couldn\u2019t help at that moment but to lower his gaze as a wave of insecurity wash over him. What if he wasn\u2019t cut out to be father? What if he let his son or daughter down?  Especially since Howard was the only example he had to follow off from about how to be a father. That wasn\u2019t the sort of life Tony wanted to be for his child. \u201cPep I want this, truly I do,\u201d he began, knowing he could always open up to Pepper. She was the only he could. She was honestly the only one to understand him and see the real Tony Stark, the side of him behind the front he put on. The side that no one else saw. \u201cI\u2019m just scared.. Scared that I won\u2019t be a good father, or even worse that I\u2019ll end up like my dad..\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnthony Edward Stark, it\u2019s okay to be nervous, don\u2019t you think I am? We\u2019re going to be parents for the first time, it\u2019s rather daunting,\u201d Pepper cupped Tony\u2019s cheeks, getting him to look at her again. She understood his concerns, given his childhood. But she needed him to know she believed in him. In them. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t have to worry about following in your father\u2019s footsteps, because you\u2019re not like him at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re the only one who thinks that,\u201d Tony sighed with a downcast look, he may have been an armoured superhero but what if he failed the kid? His own flesh and blood?</p><p>\u201cThat means my opinion should be the only one that matters to you,\u201d Pepper offered, kissing Tony\u2019s cheek. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019ll be a great father, because you can deny it all you want but you are kind, caring, loyal to the ones you loves and not to mention you\u2019ll do anything to protect everyone all around the world, you\u2019re a brilliant role model. And I love you.\u201d Truthfully, Pepper couldn\u2019t ask for a better father for her child than the man who stole her heart.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do this together alright..?\u201d Tony whispered, a hand sliding back down to Pepper\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou, me\u2026and the baby..\u201d He exhaled deeply, the nerves threatening to take over him.</p><p>\u201c<i>Our</i> baby,\u201d Pepper corrected sweetly.</p><p>As the months went by, Tony had been eager to start work on making the nursery for their little Baby Stark. That day, Pepper was just over twenty weeks pregnant and her bump was very much showing, much to the happiness of the proud expectant parents. They had recently discovered the gender of baby which only made Tony and Pepper more excited for the arrival of their darling Tori Maria Stark. </p><p>After being invited by Tony, Peter Parker was staying over at the mansion with May in tow for the weekend. While the older Parker was partaking in a sightseeing tour while the teenager and Tony worked on repairing an old car and it\u2019s engine together. To someone who didn\u2019t know any better, one would think without a doubt that the pair were father and son.</p><p>\u201cPete, can you pass me the wrench?\u201d He called to Peter, sliding out from beneath the car where he had been trying to fix an oil leak and wiped his forehead which only made the oil smudge across it worse. Not that Tony cared right now as he and his \u2018prot\u00e9g\u00e9e\u2019 tinkered on a new project together. </p><p>\u201cOf course Mr Stark,\u201d Peter nodded and handed Tony the tool he needed before quickly getting back to the repair he was almost finished on. \u201cThe cylinders don\u2019t seem to be blocked anymore sir, I\u2019m just going to make sure they\u2019re well lubricated,\u201d he explained, using the car lubricant onto the the cylinder walls and piston-pin bearings by the rotating crankshaft of the engine.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a plan kid, and once I\u2019ve finished up on this remaining leak, what do you say we test the fruits of our labours?\u201d Tony suggested, taking the wrench before he went back underneath the car to continue the repair. He always enjoyed working like this with the kid and Tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder what it was going to be like with his daughter. Just because Tori was a girl didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t going to teach her everything he knew when she was older and figured Pepper wouldn\u2019t mind. </p><p>Soon the duo had completed all the required tasks for the car and it was time to test whether the engine would run. \u201cWe did it Mr Stark, we fixed it, this is so cool!\u201d Peter cheered, he couldn\u2019t wait to tell his aunt of his and Tony\u2019s achievement when she returned later that day.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so surprised kid, after all, we make a great team,\u201d Tony smiled with pride akin to that of a father as he patted Peter on the back which made the teenager beam happily. The boy really was like a son to Tony. \u201cYou and I should next work on a new suit for you, I think you\u2019re ready,\u201d the genius nodded as if already having decided their next project and Peter couldn\u2019t be more excited for it. To have the chance to work on making his own Spider-Man suit with Tony Stark.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah.. er, wow, Mr Stark that would be great,\u201d Peter mentally scolded himself for stammering when he was taken by surprise at hearing his role model\u2019s offer. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d </p><p>Neither of the two noticed how Pepper had joined Tony and Peter in the workshop. Watching them by the door as they worked. She smiled fondly at how they interacted with one another and closed her eyes for a moment. Picturing in her mind\u2019s eye Tony and Tori in the workshop together in the years to come. The very thought bought a heartwarming smile to her face. \u201cThe two of you look like you\u2019re having fun,\u201d she spoke out, deciding to finally announce her presence. </p><p>\u201cOh Pep hey, Pete and I have just finished repairing the car,\u201d Tony grinned and held his arm out for Pepper, nothing but admiration for her in his expression. </p><p>\u201cReally? And you managed to get it to work?\u201d She teased lightheartedly and stepped closer to the man she loved unconditionally, letting him hug her as she leaned into him. </p><p>\u201cOf course, we were going to take it out for a test drive later,\u201d Tony confirmed, quickly picking up on Pepper\u2019s teasing tone. \u201cI\u2019m never wrong when it comes to things like this,\u201d he winked. </p><p>Peter looked between the two, not wanting to intrude in the moment. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go call Ned, he\u2019s going to want to know about the car,\u201d he suggested with his usual teenage awkwardness and went upstairs, taking out his phone once Tony assured him he\u2019ll come up and check on Peter shortly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re great with him Tony,\u201d Pepper complimented, resting her head onto his shoulder. Smiling softly at his touch to her baby bump. \u201cPeter really looks up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I told you before he\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Tony replied with a content sigh and was about to say something else before feeling  their little girl kick against Pepper\u2019s stomach. \u201cOh hey there, is our little girl awake?\u201d He asked in a sincerely sweet tone and knelt down to speak to the baby and smiled more when Tori kicked again. \u201cYes, your mommy is amazing isn\u2019t she? And I know for a fact you\u2019re going to be just as amazing.\u201d he continued, having a conversation with the unborn baby. Tony truly loved Pepper and had no doubt Tori would be just as perfect. His love for their baby was unconditional and always growing and it was clear for anyone to see.</p><p>It made Pepper\u2019s heart swell as she heard Tony talk to their child and the baby kicking to his voice. This was more than what she could have ever dreamed of or wanted. After all the ups and downs they had been through together, it was all worth it for them to be in the perfect situation they now had. Seeing Tony with Peter earlier and now how he treated the baby, she had no doubt that he would be a great father and it only made her love for him grow tenfold. One thing was for sure, their future was truly looking bright for the three of them. </p></p>",

I am so so so sorry for how late I am but finally my gift for you for the Pepperony gift exchange  is here! I hope you&rsquo;re well and having a great start to the new year! And I really hope you like the story &#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039; </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><i><b>Together</b></i> (A Pepperony Fan Fic)</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you off to Stark?&rdquo; Natasha quirked a brow having followed her billionaire as he attempted to sneak away unnoticed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you to shy from a celebration,&rdquo; she remarked, genuinely curious about how Tony intended to spend the evening if not with the rest of the team. The Avengers had just succeeded with another mission and were taking the time to mark their achievements at the insistence of Thor.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you succumbed to stalking me now Romanoff?&rdquo; Tony rolled his eyes, stopping mid-step and turned on his heel in the direction of the woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Sorry to disappoint, but there&rsquo;s another red head who&rsquo;s waiting for me at home,&rdquo; he explained with a shrug, putting on one of his many signature sunglasses as he prepared to leave. Noticing the impressed smirk on Natasha&rsquo;s expression. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, look who&rsquo;s becoming domesticated,&rdquo; the spy quipped in manner that convinced Tony she was congratulating him on his decision not to join the festivities.</p><p>The billionaire sighed and couldn&rsquo;t help the small smile that graced his handsome features as his mind was filled with thoughts about his fianc&eacute;e. He deemed himself the luckiest man alive that Pepper was soon to be his wife and he her husband. There was no one like Pepper in Tony&rsquo;s life and he didn&rsquo;t want anyone else but her. She was the light and happiness in his oh so complicated life. </p><p><i>It&rsquo;s always been her</i>.</p><p>However, like a lot of things in Tony&rsquo;s life, their love story wasn&rsquo;t without it&rsquo;s problems. &ldquo;I suppose, but that&rsquo;s not a bad thing,&rdquo; he chuckled as he left to his car outside. Pepper was worth it. Tony would do anything for the love of his life, he had proven just that many times. Like getting rid of all his suits - albeit for a period of time - and signing the Accords. The only reason he signed was to try and make things right with Pepper. It had broken him when they split up, like a knife to the gut.</p><p>But now wasn&rsquo;t the time to think about what happened. It was in the past and the couple were in a better place now, heck they were about to get married in a matter of months after deciding that a summer wedding would be perfect. </p><p>It took about an hour for Tony to drive home to the Malibu mansion he made sure to get rebuilt&nbsp; after the incident with the Mandarin. &ldquo;Pep?&rdquo; he called, wearing a sweet smile on his expression when he spotted the love of his life asleep on the couch. It was a moment that didn&rsquo;t happen often which made it all the more sweeter. </p><p>&rsquo;<i>She&rsquo;s so adorable when she&rsquo;s asleep</i>&rsquo; </p><p>Tony gently ran his fingers through Pepper&rsquo;s gorgeous strawberry blonde hair, his hand lightly brushing against her cheek as he crouched down beside the couch. Admiring her. At his touch to her cheek, Pepper&rsquo;s blue eyes fluttered open, her soft gaze meeting the caramel eyes she grew to love. The eyes of the man she hoped to spend the rest of her life with. &ldquo;Hmm.. you&rsquo;re late,&rdquo; she greeted, placing a soft but loving kiss to Tony&rsquo;s lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry honey, I got caught up at work,&rdquo; Tony replied with a silent chuckle. &ldquo;But tonight I&rsquo;m all yours, and I intend to make it up to you,&rdquo; he whispered near Pepper&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; she laughed, leaning her head onto Tony&rsquo;s, lightly letting out a giggle when he nuzzled his nose against hers. &ldquo;But first.. we need to talk, it&rsquo;s important,&rdquo; she pointed, nervously biting her bottom lip in anticipation.</p><p>The billionaire&rsquo;s puppy dog gaze lit up with curiosity. A small pout of disappointment in response to Pepper&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learnt Whenever a woman says that I&rsquo;m rarely in for a good time,&rdquo; he added jokingly, tilting his head as he searched for answers. What could she want to talk about that made her come across as nervous?</p><p>&ldquo;What if I said this time it&rsquo;s going to be different?&rdquo; Pepper offered, quirking a brow. She always did enjoy the loving banter the two shared.</p><p>&ldquo;In which case, all I can say to that is, surprise me,&rdquo; Tony smirked lightheartedly, still crouched down by the couch. His fingers getting lost in his fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s locks. &ldquo;What is it Pep?&rdquo; he asked, trying to encourage Pepper to open up. Needing to know what she was planning to tell him.</p><p>Pepper knew life was never going to be normal being in a relationship with Tony. But they were deeply in love, and anyway, what exactly was normal? She loved Tony and quite frankly life wouldn&rsquo;t be so eventful if he was any different. But how would he react to the news? &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s certainly a way we can surprise you,&rdquo; she replied in the hope that the genius would pick up on her choice of words. Her heart quickening as she waited for his reaction. Especially after how often Tony had been talking about them having a family of their own recently and she wanted him to be the first person she told. As the father, he deserved that. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh really? What did you have-..&rdquo; Tony began, letting his words trail off in realisation and looked at Pepper as he deduced what she was trying to say. He was both shocked and undeniably amazed. &ldquo;Are you.. Pepper.. are we going to have a baby?&rdquo; </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t need even need to say a word for Tony to read the answer from Pepper&rsquo;s wide smile and teary eyes of elation, a reflection of his own expression as he leaned forward, closing the gap between them with a searing kiss. For years, after losing his parents, Tony had been alone, going from women to women in nothing more than one night stands. Until he fell in love with Pepper. He had no other family and never thought he ever would, but now Pepper was giving him love and a family of their own. &ldquo;I love you, Miss Potts,&rdquo; Tony whispered breathlessly when the two needed to break the kiss for air. His hand moving down to stroke Pepper&rsquo;s flat stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Mr Stark,&rdquo; she added coyly, kissing him again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be a mother and father to little kid..&rdquo;</p><p>Tony couldn&rsquo;t help at that moment but to lower his gaze as a wave of insecurity wash over him.
