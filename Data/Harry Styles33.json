Needless to say, James was ecstatic and completely on board to help them.</p><p>Their plan was set into motion the day before Harry was due to appear on James\u2019 show.

We think we should actually tell everyone what that was about.\u201d<br/>\u201cSo Harry, do you want to come over here and spill the beans?\u201d James gestured for Harry to join him and Greta. The air in the room was tense as everyone wanted to know what was going on. Harry walked from the performance stage to stand next to Greta, his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNow Harry\u2019s not mic\u2019d so you all at home won\u2019t be able to hear him-\u201d James started.</p><p>\u201cUh, unless I get uncomfortably close to Greta,\u201d Harry interrupted while leaning into Greta. The audience laughed, as did Greta, Harry and James.</p><p>\u201cRight so, are you two going to clue everyone here in?\u201d James asked, bursting with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to say it or should I?\u201d Greta whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Harry replied.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Me and Harry met about 3 and a half years ago and since then we\u2019ve been making something very special to both of us. And around 4 months ago we created something even more special. Just watch\u2026\u201d She smiled towards the camera as the video started playing to the audience.</p><p>It opened on a shot of a park in Holmes Chapel, Harry was holding the camera in one hand while the other clasped Greta\u2019s as she was smiling at Harry behind the camera. </p><p>Greta\u2019s voice was overlayed, \u201cI remember once I got the flu and it was only a few months after we started dating and you came over and took care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when you knew you loved me?\u201d Harry asked as more shots of them in Holmes Chapel were shown.</p><p>\u201cWell I didn\u2019t exactly know then but later on I realised that was when I first fell in love with you,\u201d Greta said, to which Harry just \u2018awwed\u2019. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>New shots flashed of Harry and Greta in different locations, Italy, New York, Sydney Harbour.</p><p>\u201cWhen I went to Jamaica and I noticed how much I missed you and how much I just wanted you to be there with me.\u201d<br/>\u201cThat\u2019s really sweet, darling\u2026\u201d</p><p>More shots flashed, sweet kisses, nights by the fireplace, a diamond ring being slipped on to Greta\u2019s ring finger. And finally, the sound of a heartbeat, followed by a clip on an ultrasound scan, a clear outline of a baby. Then Harry and Greta\u2019s voices chimed in.</p><p>\u201cOn the 14th of November, you proposed to me in Japan-\u201d Greta said.</p><p>\u201cYes and I was a model boyfriend and it was super romantic and you had no idea and you wept for about an hour afterwards..\u201d Harry joked.</p><p>\u201cSh, its my turn to speak!\u201d There was an even louder laugh from Harry. \u201cAnd we found out we were going to have a baby in April, actually it was Easter and we were in LA at the time.\u201d<br/>\u201cAnd that\u2019s when I wept for hours-happy tears.\u201d</p><p>Soon enough the clips stopped and the screen faded to black, and back to James, and Greta and Harry, who were now holding hands.</p><p>\u201cWell, there you have it, folks!\u201d James announced as the audience\u2019s cheers had finally died down. \u201cNow do you two lovebirds want to perform?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re going to perform a song that means a lot to both of us, and we\u2019ve reworked it into a duet..\u201d Harry answered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to sing Your Song by Elton John.\u201d Greta finished.</p><p>\u201cWell get over there you two!\u201d James jokingly, and lightly, shoved them out of the shot for them both to go to the performance area. \u201cOnce again, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time as a couple, Greta Hamburg and Harry Styles!\u201d</p>",
