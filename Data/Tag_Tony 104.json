He knew the media liked\nto portray him as cold, heartless, and detached, but there was\nnothing he loved more than driving to that children&rsquo;s home in Queens\nand bringing something fun for the kids; books, toys, games,\nwhatever. He had a list of things he either could tell they\ndesperately needed, like new clothes when they started to outgrow the\nones they had or they started falling apart, or things he had\noverheard the kids talking about that they wanted, but couldn&rsquo;t ask\nfor because of budget.<br/></p><p>Well,\nTony Stark had no budget, and he was more than happy to play Santa Claus in April, just to see those kids light up like the 4<sup>th</sup>\nof July.<br/></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s\nfavorite part of his visits, however, was just spending time with the\nkids. They were full of hope and excitement, and they didn&rsquo;t care\nthat he was famous, as long as he was willing to sit down on the\nfloor with them and play, with LEGOS, Barbies, blocks, puzzles, or\nanything else the kids could find to make a game out of. He had\nplayed hopscotch on the sidewalk of a busy New York street more than\nonce, and he knew for a fact that people had taken photos and written\narticles about that, and he couldn&rsquo;t care less. Especially since the\npublicity had gotten more than a few of those kids fostered or\nadopted.<br/></p><p>After\nhe had spent a sufficient amount of time with the older kids, Tony\nliked going upstairs to the nursery and holding some of the babies.\nThere were so many crowded into one room, and there wasn&rsquo;t enough\nstaff to give them quite as much attention as they needed, so Tony\ntried to get around to cuddling as many as he could in an afternoon,\njust so those precious little babies could get even a fraction of the\nlove and attention they deserved.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>A\ncouple of babies came into the nursery a few days apart from each\nother sometime in early 2002, two boys, and the staff put both of\nthem in one crib, because there was no room for them to each have\ntheir own. The next time Tony visited, he saw them huddled together,\none of them with an arm flung across the other one&rsquo;s tummy, in an\nalmost protective manner.<br/></p><p>The\nattendant said their names were Harley and Peter. Plastic protected\nsigns on the end of the crib indicated that Harley was nine months\nold, Peter six. That seemed odd, to Tony; Harley looked like a normal\nsize, but Peter seemed far too small to be six months old.<br/></p><p>\u201cDoes\nPeter have any health problems?\u201d Tony asked the attendant.<br/></p><p>She\nrolled her eyes. \u201cI think the folks who dropped him off said he was\npremature. He&rsquo;s not sick, he&rsquo;s just a runt. Deaf, too, barely reacts\nto anything. Good thing, at that, because the other one kicks up a\nhell of a fuss whenever we get near him.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony\npeered into the crib at the two boys. Harley stared back; Peter was\nasleep. \u201cHi, there,\u201d he said to Harley. \u201cI&rsquo;m Tony. Looks like\nyou&rsquo;ve made a friend, in there. That&rsquo;s good.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harley\nkept staring at Tony. Tony was used to babies not blinking, otherwise\nhe might be a little unnerved. Next to him, Peter stirred and started\nto blink his eyes open, yawning widely in an adorable puppy-like\nmanner. Then he started to do an odd hand motion, cupping his hand\nand dragging it down his chest toward his belly. He did it a few\ntimes, looking directly at Tony, then seemed to realize Tony didn&rsquo;t\nknow what he was doing. His face crumpled and he let out a pitiful\nwhimper. Harley looked over at him and patted at Peter&rsquo;s tummy\nclumsily, like he was trying to comfort him.<br/></p><p>Tony\nreached into the crib, watching Harley carefully for any negative\nreactions like the attendant had warned. He picked Peter up and held\nhim to his chest. He knew Peter wouldn&rsquo;t be able to understand him if\nhe spoke, but he thought that a gentle touch might be soothing.<br/></p><p>Peter\ndid the hand motion a few more times, almost half-heartedly, like he\nwasn&rsquo;t expecting anything to come of it. It was sort of\nheartbreaking, how resigned he already was to the fact that nobody\nknew what he needed.<br/></p><p>Tony\nthought he remembered reading somewhere that babies could communicate\nin sign language even before they could talk, if their parents taught\nthem how to sign the words for their basic needs. Maybe that&rsquo;s what\nPeter was doing. Tony watched Peter do it again, paying more\nattention this time.<br/></p><p>\u201cLooks like he wants something,\u201d Tony said to the attendant.<br/></p><p>She\nscoffed. \u201cHe never wants anything, he&rsquo;s impossible to look after,\nhe never makes any indication that he might want something, and we\nhave to guess.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony\nshook his head. \u201cI think he does try to tell you, and you just\ncan&rsquo;t see it,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLook at him.\u201d<br/></p><p>She\nlooked critically at the little baby in Tony&rsquo;s arms, still doing the\nhand motion. \u201cWhat&rsquo;s he doing?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nthink it&rsquo;s sign language,\u201d Tony said.<br/></p><p>She\nfixed him with an unimpressed look. \u201cHe&rsquo;s a baby.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBabies\ncan use sign language,\u201d Tony pointed out. \u201cHe might be hungry.\u201d\nHe rubbed Peter&rsquo;s tummy gently with two fingers. \u201cAre you hungry,\nbuddy? Yeah?\u201d<br/></p><p>The\nattendant looked like she wanted to point out that Peter couldn&rsquo;t\nhear him, but she decided against it.<br/></p><p>Peter\nlooked up at Tony in reaction to the rubbing with big, sad brown\neyes, and patted the fingers on his tummy with his whole, tiny hand.\nHe did the motion again.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere\ndo you keep the bottles and formula?\u201d Tony asked. He didn&rsquo;t usually\nfeed the babies when he visited; most of them were either already fed\nor could easily communicate when they needed to be, but Peter\nobviously couldn&rsquo;t. Tony was worried that he might end up becoming\nmalnourished if the staff continued the way they were currently going\nabout his care.<br/></p><p>The\nattendant pointed to the side of the room that had two wall cabinets,\na sink, and some empty counter space with three bottle warmers\nsitting on top of it. Tony went over to it, holding Peter securely\nagainst his chest, and started rummaging through the cupboards for\nthe formula powder and a bottle. He followed the directions\ncarefully, and after a few minutes he had successfully mixed and\nwarmed a bottle, which he offered to Peter.<br/></p><p>The\nlittle baby reached for the bottle with both hands, his eyes\nbrightening, and opened his mouth. Tony guided the bottle in and let\nPeter hold onto it as he drank greedily. Tony looked over at the\nattendant, triumphant and smug. She shrugged passively and went to\ncheck on another baby that had started screaming.<br/></p><p>Tony\ncarried Peter back over to the crib where Harley was still being held\nprisoner. He looked down at Harley, who had sat up in his absence and\nstarted fiddling with a little stuffed bunny that had apparently been\nleft in the crib. \u201cLook, buddy, I figured out what your friend\nneeded,\u201d Tony said. He looked back at Peter, who was still sucking\nfervently on the bottle Tony had given him. \u201cHey, slow down, champ,\nor that&rsquo;s all going to come right back up,\u201d he added, tilting the\nbottle down ever so slightly to attempt to slow Peter&rsquo;s drinking\nspeed.

The next time Tony visited, he saw them huddled together,\none of them with an arm flung across the other one\u2019s tummy, in an\nalmost protective manner.<br></p><p>The\nattendant said their names were Harley and Peter. Plastic protected\nsigns on the end of the crib indicated that Harley was nine months\nold, Peter six. That seemed odd, to Tony; Harley looked like a normal\nsize, but Peter seemed far too small to be six months old.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes\nPeter have any health problems?\u201d Tony asked the attendant.<br></p><p>She\nrolled her eyes. \u201cI think the folks who dropped him off said he was\npremature. He\u2019s not sick, he\u2019s just a runt. Deaf, too, barely reacts\nto anything. Good thing, at that, because the other one kicks up a\nhell of a fuss whenever we get near him.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony\npeered into the crib at the two boys. Harley stared back; Peter was\nasleep. \u201cHi, there,\u201d he said to Harley. \u201cI\u2019m Tony. Looks like\nyou\u2019ve made a friend, in there. That\u2019s good.\u201d<br></p><p>Harley\nkept staring at Tony. Tony was used to babies not blinking, otherwise\nhe might be a little unnerved. Next to him, Peter stirred and started\nto blink his eyes open, yawning widely in an adorable puppy-like\nmanner. Then he started to do an odd hand motion, cupping his hand\nand dragging it down his chest toward his belly. He did it a few\ntimes, looking directly at Tony, then seemed to realize Tony didn\u2019t\nknow what he was doing. His face crumpled and he let out a pitiful\nwhimper. Harley looked over at him and patted at Peter\u2019s tummy\nclumsily, like he was trying to comfort him.<br></p><p>Tony\nreached into the crib, watching Harley carefully for any negative\nreactions like the attendant had warned. He picked Peter up and held\nhim to his chest. He knew Peter wouldn\u2019t be able to understand him if\nhe spoke, but he thought that a gentle touch might be soothing.<br></p><p>Peter\ndid the hand motion a few more times, almost half-heartedly, like he\nwasn\u2019t expecting anything to come of it. It was sort of\nheartbreaking, how resigned he already was to the fact that nobody\nknew what he needed.<br></p><p>Tony\nthought he remembered reading somewhere that babies could communicate\nin sign language even before they could talk, if their parents taught\nthem how to sign the words for their basic needs. Maybe that\u2019s what\nPeter was doing. Tony watched Peter do it again, paying more\nattention this time.<br></p><p>\u201cLooks like he wants something,\u201d Tony said to the attendant.<br></p><p>She\nscoffed. \u201cHe never wants anything, he\u2019s impossible to look after,\nhe never makes any indication that he might want something, and we\nhave to guess.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony\nshook his head. \u201cI think he does try to tell you, and you just\ncan\u2019t see it,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLook at him.\u201d<br></p><p>She\nlooked critically at the little baby in Tony\u2019s arms, still doing the\nhand motion. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nthink it\u2019s sign language,\u201d Tony said.<br></p><p>She\nfixed him with an unimpressed look. \u201cHe\u2019s a baby.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBabies\ncan use sign language,\u201d Tony pointed out. \u201cHe might be hungry.\u201d\nHe rubbed Peter\u2019s tummy gently with two fingers. \u201cAre you hungry,\nbuddy? Yeah?\u201d<br></p><p>The\nattendant looked like she wanted to point out that Peter couldn\u2019t\nhear him, but she decided against it.<br></p><p>Peter\nlooked up at Tony in reaction to the rubbing with big, sad brown\neyes, and patted the fingers on his tummy with his whole, tiny hand.\nHe did the motion again.<br></p><p>\u201cWhere\ndo you keep the bottles and formula?\u201d Tony asked. He didn\u2019t usually\nfeed the babies when he visited; most of them were either already fed\nor could easily communicate when they needed to be, but Peter\nobviously couldn\u2019t. Tony was worried that he might end up becoming\nmalnourished if the staff continued the way they were currently going\nabout his care.<br></p><p>The\nattendant pointed to the side of the room that had two wall cabinets,\na sink, and some empty counter space with three bottle warmers\nsitting on top of it. Tony went over to it, holding Peter securely\nagainst his chest, and started rummaging through the cupboards for\nthe formula powder and a bottle. He followed the directions\ncarefully, and after a few minutes he had successfully mixed and\nwarmed a bottle, which he offered to Peter.<br></p><p>The\nlittle baby reached for the bottle with both hands, his eyes\nbrightening, and opened his mouth. Tony guided the bottle in and let\nPeter hold onto it as he drank greedily. Tony looked over at the\nattendant, triumphant and smug. She shrugged passively and went to\ncheck on another baby that had started screaming.<br></p><p>Tony\ncarried Peter back over to the crib where Harley was still being held\nprisoner. He looked down at Harley, who had sat up in his absence and\nstarted fiddling with a little stuffed bunny that had apparently been\nleft in the crib. \u201cLook, buddy, I figured out what your friend\nneeded,\u201d Tony said. He looked back at Peter, who was still sucking\nfervently on the bottle Tony had given him. \u201cHey, slow down, champ,\nor that\u2019s all going to come right back up,\u201d he added, tilting the\nbottle down ever so slightly to attempt to slow Peter\u2019s drinking\nspeed. Peter fussed a bit until he realized Tony wasn\u2019t trying to\ntake the bottle away, then accepted the new angle and kept sucking.\nHis eyes were half-lidded, like he was blissed out from finally being\nable to fill his belly.<br></p><p>Harley\nwatched Peter with his wide-eyed stare, then looked up and Tony and\noffered him a small, half-toothy smile.<br></p><p>Tony\u2019s\nheart melted a little bit.

The next time Tony visited, he saw them huddled together,\none of them with an arm flung across the other one\u2019s tummy, in an\nalmost protective manner.<br></p><p>The\nattendant said their names were Harley and Peter. Plastic protected\nsigns on the end of the crib indicated that Harley was nine months\nold, Peter six. That seemed odd, to Tony; Harley looked like a normal\nsize, but Peter seemed far too small to be six months old.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes\nPeter have any health problems?\u201d Tony asked the attendant.<br></p><p>She\nrolled her eyes. \u201cI think the folks who dropped him off said he was\npremature. He\u2019s not sick, he\u2019s just a runt. Deaf, too, barely reacts\nto anything. Good thing, at that, because the other one kicks up a\nhell of a fuss whenever we get near him.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony\npeered into the crib at the two boys. Harley stared back; Peter was\nasleep. \u201cHi, there,\u201d he said to Harley. \u201cI\u2019m Tony. Looks like\nyou\u2019ve made a friend, in there. That\u2019s good.\u201d<br></p><p>Harley\nkept staring at Tony. Tony was used to babies not blinking, otherwise\nhe might be a little unnerved. Next to him, Peter stirred and started\nto blink his eyes open, yawning widely in an adorable puppy-like\nmanner. Then he started to do an odd hand motion, cupping his hand\nand dragging it down his chest toward his belly. He did it a few\ntimes, looking directly at Tony, then seemed to realize Tony didn\u2019t\nknow what he was doing. His face crumpled and he let out a pitiful\nwhimper. Harley looked over at him and patted at Peter\u2019s tummy\nclumsily, like he was trying to comfort him.<br></p><p>Tony\nreached into the crib, watching Harley carefully for any negative\nreactions like the attendant had warned. He picked Peter up and held\nhim to his chest. He knew Peter wouldn\u2019t be able to understand him if\nhe spoke, but he thought that a gentle touch might be soothing.<br></p><p>Peter\ndid the hand motion a few more times, almost half-heartedly, like he\nwasn\u2019t expecting anything to come of it. It was sort of\nheartbreaking, how resigned he already was to the fact that nobody\nknew what he needed.<br></p><p>Tony\nthought he remembered reading somewhere that babies could communicate\nin sign language even before they could talk, if their parents taught\nthem how to sign the words for their basic needs. Maybe that\u2019s what\nPeter was doing. Tony watched Peter do it again, paying more\nattention this time.<br></p><p>\u201cLooks like he wants something,\u201d Tony said to the attendant.<br></p><p>She\nscoffed. \u201cHe never wants anything, he\u2019s impossible to look after,\nhe never makes any indication that he might want something, and we\nhave to guess.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony\nshook his head. \u201cI think he does try to tell you, and you just\ncan\u2019t see it,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLook at him.\u201d<br></p><p>She\nlooked critically at the little baby in Tony\u2019s arms, still doing the\nhand motion. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nthink it\u2019s sign language,\u201d Tony said.<br></p><p>She\nfixed him with an unimpressed look. \u201cHe\u2019s a baby.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBabies\ncan use sign language,\u201d Tony pointed out. \u201cHe might be hungry.\u201d\nHe rubbed Peter\u2019s tummy gently with two fingers. \u201cAre you hungry,\nbuddy? Yeah?\u201d<br></p><p>The\nattendant looked like she wanted to point out that Peter couldn\u2019t\nhear him, but she decided against it.<br></p><p>Peter\nlooked up at Tony in reaction to the rubbing with big, sad brown\neyes, and patted the fingers on his tummy with his whole, tiny hand.\nHe did the motion again.<br></p><p>\u201cWhere\ndo you keep the bottles and formula?\u201d Tony asked. He didn\u2019t usually\nfeed the babies when he visited; most of them were either already fed\nor could easily communicate when they needed to be, but Peter\nobviously couldn\u2019t. Tony was worried that he might end up becoming\nmalnourished if the staff continued the way they were currently going\nabout his care.<br></p><p>The\nattendant pointed to the side of the room that had two wall cabinets,\na sink, and some empty counter space with three bottle warmers\nsitting on top of it. Tony went over to it, holding Peter securely\nagainst his chest, and started rummaging through the cupboards for\nthe formula powder and a bottle. He followed the directions\ncarefully, and after a few minutes he had successfully mixed and\nwarmed a bottle, which he offered to Peter.<br></p><p>The\nlittle baby reached for the bottle with both hands, his eyes\nbrightening, and opened his mouth. Tony guided the bottle in and let\nPeter hold onto it as he drank greedily. Tony looked over at the\nattendant, triumphant and smug. She shrugged passively and went to\ncheck on another baby that had started screaming.<br></p><p>Tony\ncarried Peter back over to the crib where Harley was still being held\nprisoner. He looked down at Harley, who had sat up in his absence and\nstarted fiddling with a little stuffed bunny that had apparently been\nleft in the crib. \u201cLook, buddy, I figured out what your friend\nneeded,\u201d Tony said. He looked back at Peter, who was still sucking\nfervently on the bottle Tony had given him. \u201cHey, slow down, champ,\nor that\u2019s all going to come right back up,\u201d he added, tilting the\nbottle down ever so slightly to attempt to slow Peter\u2019s drinking\nspeed. Peter fussed a bit until he realized Tony wasn\u2019t trying to\ntake the bottle away, then accepted the new angle and kept sucking.\nHis eyes were half-lidded, like he was blissed out from finally being\nable to fill his belly.<br></p><p>Harley\nwatched Peter with his wide-eyed stare, then looked up and Tony and\noffered him a small, half-toothy smile.<br></p><p>Tony\u2019s\nheart melted a little bit.
