Why does Sansa want to see Daenerys fail?\u201d</b><br/></p><p>Dany\u2019s actions in King\u2019s Landing are wildly misinterpreted. Dany is obsessed with urban planning, and this was step one of implementing her plans for a better KL.<br/></p><p>Step 1: burn everything to hell for the good of the people <br/><br/> Step 2: continue step 1 until it doesn&rsquo;t feel good anymore<br/><br/> Step 3: when you run out of shit to burn, find a new city!</p><p>Maybe there\u2019s a missing element in her process, but you get the idea.

Ok, let&rsquo;s find someone else to blame. Ah! Cersei! Yes, she tricked Dany into burning the city by&hellip;ringing the bells? Surrendering? Making burning the city unnecessary? Darn. That leaves us with Sansa. And therefore I will have to reintroduce the theory that Sansa is a warg who took control of Drogon and burned KL against Dany&rsquo;s will. That&rsquo;s not a real theory? Now it is!</p><p>Fine! No dragon warging for Sansa. But, don&rsquo;t worry. We <i>will</i> blame Sansa for this. Let me find a way&hellip;ah, ok! If Sansa had never whispered the idea of a bonfire in Dany&rsquo;s ear, if she had never secured the dragons to make it possible, if she had never convinced Dany that the Iron Throne was hers and had been stolen from her family, if Sansa had never told Dany to take what is hers with &ldquo;fire and blood&rdquo;, if Sansa had never amassed an army for the sole purpose of conquering a continent, if Sansa had never worshiped Dany, feeding into her savior complex (like Jorah, Tyrion, every man Dany ever encounters&hellip;), if Sansa had never tried to use Dany as a means of revenge and wanted her to be ruthless and vicious (Olenna, Yara, Ellaria), than Dany would have <i>never</i> done anything morally ambiguous, objectionable, or cruel. Wait, what&rsquo;s this now? Dany has been burning people alive since s1? WTH Sansa?! Damn. My girl&rsquo;s power is unparalleled!</p><p>Do I really think that Sansa spreading the truth about Jon&rsquo;s identity is the reason Dany burned KL? No. She wanted to do this for seasons. She mentioned this before she ever met Sansa. Back in s7 Dany said she was going to burn the Red Keep and Tyrion said &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve discussed this.&rdquo; What did he mean? Why was he worried? Scroll back up to those quotes from s6. Burning any part of KL had the potential to set off the wildfire caches that he told her about. Not only that, he warned her about burning cities at all. As in, maybe, she shouldn&rsquo;t do it at all. Tyrion and Jon both work to make her behave in a humane manner in s7 and s8, but to no avail. This is who Dany has always warned us she was. The dragons just gave her the power to follow her natural instinct. Why do I say that? In s2 Dany said that when her dragons were grown she would &ldquo;lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground.&rdquo;<br /><br />So yes, in 8x05 Dany blames Sansa for her burning Varys, but you know who she blames next? Jon. She can tell Jon doesn&rsquo;t love her anymore so she says, &ldquo;fear it is&rdquo; and then she goes and burns King&rsquo;s Landing. Is it Jon&rsquo;s fault? NO. Dany can blame anyone she wants, but just because she tries to pin mass murder on other people doesn&rsquo;t mean we need to buy it, especially when other people have been fighting to preserve life all along.</p><p>I mean, I get it. We all have that instinctive &ldquo;but is burning people alive really <i>bad</i>?&rdquo; reaction, but yeah, it&rsquo;s always been bad, Dany has always done it, and no matter how Dany rationalizes it, it&rsquo;s still evil. It&rsquo;s still Dany&rsquo;s fault. How do I know? Cuz Dany is on the dragon roasting people, not Sansa.</p><p>And Sansa wants to see Dany &ldquo;fail&rdquo; because Dany is a tyrant. That&rsquo;s a fair name for someone who thinks she needs to kill everyone who doesn&rsquo;t agree with her. Dany claimed to be a liberator, but the only thing she consistently offered was death. Wanting someone like that to fail makes you the good guy.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>&ldquo;Did Daenerys Targaryen fall under ploy of Sansa Stark by taking extreme measures against people of King&rsquo;s Landing? Why does Sansa want to see Daenerys fail?&rdquo;</b><br /></p>\n<p>Dany&rsquo;s actions in King&rsquo;s Landing are wildly misinterpreted. Dany is obsessed with urban planning, and this was step one of implementing her plans for a better KL.<br /></p>\n<p>Step 1: burn everything to hell for the good of the people <br /><br /> Step 2: continue step 1 until it doesn&rsquo;t feel good anymore<br /><br /> Step 3: when you run out of shit to burn, find a new city!</p>\n<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a missing element in her process, but you get the idea. She had good intentions and that&rsquo;s all that matters. I meant that as a joke, and yet, it&rsquo;s a pretty good way to describe her actions everywhere she goes. She disrupts and destroys what is, but, she never has a plan, a way to move past the destruction and build something good or lasting. Dany doesn&rsquo;t have foresight. She has (what she believes to be) righteous anger.</p>\n</p>",

She was alone, which sucks.<br/><br/>Dany should have died in the fight at Winterfell to preserve her character and so all those people in Kings Landing wouldn\u2019t have died. Anyone who has been watching this show since S1 had to have seen she was becoming the villian. Like it wasn\u2019t subtle at all LoL. They dropped massive hits from S3 onward but the fandom likes to forget all that - which again is fine. Perspectives and opinions are subjective.<br/><br/>But yeah, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the ending. I\u2019m glad my favs survived but I expected more of something they spent eons shooting. The acting was good - the writing though was terrible. It is what it is. At least we still have the books? [ Which I just started on Audible btw. ] So I\u2019m only on the first book lol.

They were the ones who were willing to bend that honor and ideology of the stark house in order to survive. Sansa lied and faked loyalty to the lannisters, their greatest enemy, because she knew that they would kill her if she didn\u2019t.  She even went as far to learn from the worst people she knew, littlefinger and Cersei. Ned, cat, Robb, Jon-none of the would\u2019ve done that, their sense of honor wa too great. Arya learned to train and fight as an assassin to kill everyone on her list of names because that was what was keeping her will to live alive, vengeance.  Again, no other stark would\u2019ve been vengeful like that, but it was Arya\u2019s trait, and it kept her going. Vengeance and dishonesty-two traits that are not what starks are known for. But what kept Sansa and Arya alive in their respective positions was special to both of them. If Sansa had been in Arya\u2019s situation, she would have died very fast, and if Arya had been in sansa\u2019s, she wouldn\u2019t have made it beyond season 2, because neither of them were designed for the other\u2019s circumstances. Granted, no one is really designed for what Sansa went through, but she did because she endured. Jon Snow could\u2019ve never lied like that. Sansa has said herself that she is a terrible liar. But here\u2019s the thing. She lied convincingly enough to stay alive and not be murdered to send a message. She lied convincingly for Littlefinger because she knew it would keep her alive. Sansa adapted better than almost anyone would, and she sacrificed honor and honesty because how else would she stay alive long enough to regain them?  No starks were ruthless and terrifying or murderous in the series beginning. But that\u2019s what Arya became. She had to become that to survive, to complete her list. She can fight better than almost anyone now, able to match brienne with her immense speed and agility. Arya didn\u2019t kill the night king for nothing. She was absolutely terrifying after murdering House frey, and she was terrifying once more when she threatened Sansa with wearing her face. Arya and Sansa managed to survive because they bent the stark ideals, but also because their experience in the word had made them smarter and harder. They were now much more suspicious of people, of everyone, than Jon Snow ever was. They didn\u2019t trust dany, and rightfully so; look what happened to king\u2019s landing in season eight. The stark sisters survived because they knew to think with their minds, not with their honor or House loyalty. </p><p>The starks who died died because their enemies took their greatest strength-honor-and turned it against them, into their detrimental flaw. Robb and Catelyn died honoring the wishes of someone they had wronged, but he hadn\u2019t forgiven them. Robb thought with his heart instead of his mind when he got married, and it got him stabbed. Ned retained his honor to Robert and the other Baratheons as the true heirs to the throne, and when trying to expose the truth, he was murdered. Jon believed in honor and honesty just like the man who raised him. He honored the wishes of the wildlings, and the others killed him for it. Even later, the reason why Cersei\u2019s army doesn\u2019t fight in the long night is because he couldn\u2019t feasibly lie to her about his allegiances. Arya and Sansa would\u2019ve lied in an instant, and even Tyrion and dany call him out on it.</p><p>If any dead starks (plus Jon) had been in sansas situation, they wouldn\u2019t have survived because the dishonesty of it all would\u2019ve been too great for them. If they had been in Arya\u2019s situation, they would not have been able to stand the dishonor of traveling with thieves and lowborns and learning to fight from a man who wears other people\u2019s faces. </p><p>The stark ideals are good ones, but in a world as bad as the GOT universe, people would use it against them, and it would be the catalyst of their eventual downfall. The ability to fight and murder for vengeance and survival reasons, and the ability to read peoples intentions and lie and forgo loyalty in the face of imminent death is what keeps people alive in a world as bad as GOT. Arya and Sansa developed those traits over the seasons, and it is what kept them alive over ned, cat, Robb, and, for a time, Jon </p>",
