I had done research and made an entire PowerPoint presentation to convince my parents to let me get one. I got the hamster back home and decided to honor iron Man and named my hamster Tony Stark. I loved this little guy and was taking care of him. According to where I got him, he was 3 weeks old. I thought I had a few years with him because they don&rsquo;t live that long but no. Six days after getting him he dies. It was very sudden, too. I woke up, checked on him, fed him and he was running around and nothing seemed wrong. I didn&rsquo;t have anywhere to go for the day so I went back to bed and 3 hours later I decide to get up for the day. I go to check on him because he is usually up at this point and I find out he&rsquo;s dead. I&rsquo;m balling by this point because I had just got him hand trained and we had bonded. I had made videos about him and I&rsquo;m still upset. And now I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about how no Tony Stark is apparently allowed in my life this year and it sucks. </p>",

I had done research and made an entire PowerPoint presentation to convince my parents to let me get one. I got the hamster back home and decided to honor iron Man and named my hamster Tony Stark. I loved this little guy and was taking care of him. According to where I got him, he was 3 weeks old. I thought I had a few years with him because they don\u2019t live that long but no. Six days after getting him he dies. It was very sudden, too. I woke up, checked on him, fed him and he was running around and nothing seemed wrong. I didn\u2019t have anywhere to go for the day so I went back to bed and 3 hours later I decide to get up for the day. I go to check on him because he is usually up at this point and I find out he\u2019s dead. I\u2019m balling by this point because I had just got him hand trained and we had bonded. I had made videos about him and I\u2019m still upset. And now I can\u2019t stop thinking about how no Tony Stark is apparently allowed in my life this year and it sucks. </p></p>",

Remember Batman Begins and its subsequent movies? Those ended in 2012, yet people still make Bane references. People still love Batman Begins, even though it came out in 2005.

Growing up, I came to love the old Superman movies and Batman movies (and the 60\u2032s TV show, lol) and even The Indian and the Cupboard, along with several other books and movies, because my parents had them and sat and watched them with me.

I remember dreaming the OUAT catch phrase \u201cI\u2019ll always find you\u201d. Yeah, my mind is a mix of fantasy series. Anyway, Steve had always seen Howard with those women, but he didn\u2019t investigat, he had a lot of other things to do, I mean war, plus he trusted his friend and the women didn\u2019t seem hurt or in danger, they even returned with their offsprings to meet Howard. Steve himself met some of the children too, when he was around, playing with them a little or something like this. When he asked questions, Howard always had good, satisfying answers.</p><p>Then Steve wake up ~70 years later, and he worked at SHIELD with the children or even the grandchildren of those babies. Good people, bad people, of every ethnicity and so on&hellip; he maybe noticed that they seemed to have something in common, like the way they talked or moved.

Until they became a couple and Tony told him what Howard did (he discovered it in Iron Man 2 as said before) and they decided to track down all the people involved, because even if they weren\u2019t half-brothers and half-sisters by blood, or half-cousins, they were artificially related.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I return looking at Tony, Steve and at the screens again. All the faces were the people Tony was related to. The same people Howard experimented on, plus their own children and grandchildren. You can imagine my shock when I saw Rhodey\u2019s face and&hellip; do you remember the little spider/genius? Yep, Peter\u2019s face was also present.</p><p>It\u2019s a bad thing, Steve knows it, a very terrific one&hellip; a man who experimented on women and babies, manipulating their genes(?? My dream, my rules) but at the same times, he finds it romantic in a twisted way, because that means he\u2019s always been sorrounded by Tonys, since his first days as Cap. And he also found his own.</p><p>Okay, I swear it seemed more romantic when I first wake up this morning.

His son was one of the successfully ended experiment, and Howard didn&rsquo;t know how to be a father for a child, even less for an experiment.</p><p>The Stony part? I remember dreaming the OUAT catch phrase &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always find you&rdquo;. Yeah, my mind is a mix of fantasy series. Anyway, Steve had always seen Howard with those women, but he didn&rsquo;t investigat, he had a lot of other things to do, I mean war, plus he trusted his friend and the women didn&rsquo;t seem hurt or in danger, they even returned with their offsprings to meet Howard. Steve himself met some of the children too, when he was around, playing with them a little or something like this. When he asked questions, Howard always had good, satisfying answers.</p><p>Then Steve wake up ~70 years later, and he worked at SHIELD with the children or even the grandchildren of those babies. Good people, bad people, of every ethnicity and so on&hellip; he maybe noticed that they seemed to have something in common, like the way they talked or moved. I precisely remember a night scene on a deck(?)or a roof(?) somewhere high and open under the night sky, where Steve was talking with this FBI agent, good looking and smart, who was waving both hands a bit too much.</p><p>When <i>Tony</i> happened in Steve&rsquo;s life, the soldier didn&rsquo;t make a link among those people and the greatest genius, even if he couldn&rsquo;t avoid to find some similarities in the back of his mind. Until they became a couple and Tony told him what Howard did (he discovered it in Iron Man 2 as said before) and they decided to track down all the people involved, because even if they weren&rsquo;t half-brothers and half-sisters by blood, or half-cousins, they were artificially related.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s when I return looking at Tony, Steve and at the screens again. All the faces were the people Tony was related to. The same people Howard experimented on, plus their own children and grandchildren. You can imagine my shock when I saw Rhodey&rsquo;s face and&hellip; do you remember the little spider/genius? Yep, Peter&rsquo;s face was also present.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a bad thing, Steve knows it, a very terrific one&hellip; a man who experimented on women and babies, manipulating their genes(?? My dream, my rules) but at the same times, he finds it romantic in a twisted way, because that means he&rsquo;s always been sorrounded by Tonys, since his first days as Cap. And he also found his own.</p><p>Okay, I swear it seemed more romantic when I first wake up this morning. I read a lot of posts saying that Tony and Steve are always a constant in all the universe, that there cannot be one without the other, and they always find each other eventually. So my brain came up with this,,,&nbsp;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>I had an incredible dream and it was about Tony Stark and <i>Stony, </i>so I&rsquo;m proud of myself:</p>\n<p>there were my cousin and myself, and I was explaining her who Tony Stark is. I remember we were watching him and Steve, that where looking at the holographic screens in the lab. Do you remember in Endgame, when the avengers were looking at all the dusted people on the screens? It was the same thing, but the faces where different, some of them where old and others were very young.</p>\n<p>Then I don&rsquo;t know how, someone else started telling the story about what we were looking at, and Howard Stark appeared.</p>\n</p>",
