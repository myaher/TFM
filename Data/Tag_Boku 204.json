        "body": "<p>It\u2019ll probably be no surprise to anyone that I\u2019ve got a soft spot for Present Mic. \u00a0But the more I get into BNHA the more I keep thinking about his hair. \u00a0As a teen it was styled, but it was relatively short. \u00a0And that mane is not something you handle without serious commitment, ESPECIALLY if you\u2019re going to wear it up the way he does. \u00a0The weight alone would probably require training to avoid neck injury (and if you think I\u2019m exaggerating, ask any cosplayer or actor that\u2019s needed to wear a heavy wig).<br/></p><p>So, I wondered if there might be a reason a hero, who has 3 jobs and really does NOT need a huge heavy weight causing him headaches and neck strain whenever he\u2019s working. \u00a0And then&hellip;well, an Aizawa/Yamada theory popped into my head and made me laugh.</p><p>- The reason Present Mic has hair half the length of his body is because of a bet.<br/></p><p>- It started after he and Shouta graduated. \u00a0In the world of heroes, image is important, and Hizashi started to tease his friend about his messy mop. \u00a0At some point, Hizashi tells him that he should just cut it short if he doesn\u2019t want to care about it.</p><p>- Shouta argues that having it long means he can just tie it back, while having it short means it\u2019s completely uncontrollable. \u00a0It might not look great, but he\u2019s used to it.</p><p>- Hizashi, probably running high on graduation, suggests that Shouta\u2019s just too lazy to get it cut, because hair that long can\u2019t possible be comfortable. \u00a0Shouta, feeling snarky, argues that Hizashi would never be able to handle long hair. \u00a0</p><p>- So the bet is cast. \u00a0Hizashi loses if he cuts his hair.</p><p>- Aizawa immediately has an edge. \u00a0Hizashi\u2019s entire knowledge of hair care consists of \u2018run some gel through until it spikes up\u2019 which isn\u2019t really going to be effective once it gets past a few inches.</p><p>- As expected, Hizashi becomes the butt of a lot of jokes for being unable to manage his hair, while Aizawa, an underground hero, gets no comments for his unruly mop. \u00a0It hides his features, and he can tie it back when he needs to look professional. \u00a0Hizashi still has to endure the \u2018too long to leave alone but too short to tie back stage\u2019</p><p>- At some point, Hizashi leaves for a hero exchange in America. \u00a0Aizawa fully expects him to come back with a cropped skull, because his hair is almost shoulder length at this point and he still hasn\u2019t figured out how to style it. \u00a0He\u2019s still spiking it straight up, and it looks ridiculous. \u00a0American heroes who aren\u2019t used to Hizashi will no doubt torment him for it even more than his Japanese co-workers.</p><p>- When he gets back, Aizawa is looking forward to seeing him. \u00a0Not only because he hasn\u2019t seen his best friend/crush in person for almost a year, but because he own hair is getting a tad longer than he likes to have it, and he\u2019s looking forward to the vindication before he goes to the barbers himself.</p><p>- However, Nemuri sees Hizashi first and warns Aizawa not to celebrate. Hizashi\u2019s \u2018crown\u2019 is now 2 foot long and makes him look like a cockatoo. \u00a0Aizawa wonders why the hell he\u2019s in love with this idiot.</p><p>- He visits him that evening to catch up, and arrives to find Hizashi blow drying his hair. Apparently his time in the US helped him figure out how to use one, and now his mane is lying flat against his back. There are also a dozen products in the bathroom, and Hizashi moans to Aizawa about how much effort his mother must have gone to when her hair was this long.-</p><p>- Aizawa however, isn\u2019t saying a word. \u00a0Because his brain is too busy looping \u2018humana, humana, humana\u2019 on repeat.</p><p>- Turns out, Hizashi with long hair is hot. \u00a0True, Aizawa\u2019s been in love with his former classmate for years, but long haired Yamada is going to be the star of just about every dream he has for the next five years. \u00a0Because, HELLO! kink he didn\u2019t know he had. \u00a0Aizawa silently vows to never let it be cut.</p><p>- Of course this has issues, because that\u2019s A LOT of hair, especially the way Hizashi wears it. He\u2019s even had to start taking ballet lessons because the weight of his hair was starting to effect his neck and balance. \u00a0The man is committed to his bets.</p><p>- Resulting in Aizawa\u2019s next new kink. \u00a0Long haired Hizashi on a bar wearing leg warmers.</p><p>- Nemuri has started recommending different styles for Yamada to try. \u00a0The man is determined to master every type of braid by his next birthday.
