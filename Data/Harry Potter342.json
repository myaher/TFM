He groaned at the name and then playfully swatted your hips which were swaying along the tunes of some upbeat music you didn\u2019t know the name of.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cYou may want to go and sit on the dining table and stop disturbing me, unless you want burnt breakfast\u201d you said turning around and hitting him lightly on the shoulder with the spatula. \u201cOh! Spare the burnt food, I may even eat poison if it meant I got to see your annoyed face and swaying hips together on the same morning.\u201d He said cheekily, chuckling as you gave him the finger.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  It was a comparatively normal morning, given the lives you and your husband led. It was domestic and mellow and perfect. Exactly how you wanted the day to be in order for the future events to unfold properly. You served the breakfast and tried to enjoy the silence and calm while it lasted because you knew that the day was going to turn upside down soon enough.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But your jittery nerves didn\u2019t even let you eat. But you were not so sure. There may be other reasons why you may experience a loss of appetite given the current circumstances. He got up, picking up his empty plate and looked funnily at you. You were never the one to eat slowly or pick at your food. You just smiled sheepishly at him and tried to eat whatever was on your plate. He probably brushed it off and started to head towards the washroom to shower and get ready for the day. He was heading exactly where you had put a little surprise gift for him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You started feeling overly nervous and unsure about the \u2018surprise\u2019. Maybe you should\u2019ve waited a bit more. You were trying to think of ways you could use to prevent him from discovering the secret surprise, when you heard a loud and shaky, shocked \u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d coming from the washroom. You let out a shaky gasp. He had found out. You started walking towards the washroom, getting ready and preparing yourself for a confrontation you were stupidly scared about.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N, there is a lizard in the shower! Make it go away. It\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d A lizard? That\u2019s not what he was supposed to fin\u2026\u2026You realized that he hadn\u2019t seen your surprise yet and you didn\u2019t know whether to sigh in relief or to smack your husband upside down on his head. Such a big grown up man and given the life and everything it consists of plus the big responsibility that\u2019s going to arrive on his head, he still wants you to get the lizard away. As if that little reptile is going to have his head off. You still went in there, all nervousness thrown out of the window when you saw him crouching behind the toilet seat, pointing towards a little lizard that was busy minding its own business.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You huffed and went ahead to caressingly get the little reptile on your palm. You turned around to show him that the lizard meant no harm, only see a sight that made all air leave your lungs. Y/H was standing there holding the little surprise in his hand checking it out carefully and you saw his eyes widen as he realized what he was holding. A soft, almost silent \u201cOh god\u201d left his lips, his face contorted in an expression you didn\u2019t recognize what it was. He lifted his head, eyes watery \u201cIs it true?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A little nod was all that was needed to make him come to you and engulf you into his warm embrace. The positive pregnancy test forgotten on the sink counter. You felt tears running down your eyes as an elated laughter bubbled out of his throat. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to be parents!!?!!!?!?!\u201d he asked, rather exclaimed. It made you burrow your head further into his neck, a soft whisper of yes escaping your mouth, all fear and jittery nerves vanished. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIs it inside you? The baby? Of course it is. What even am I asking? But when did you know? Do you have a bump? I don\u2019t feel a bump.\u201d You laughed at his excitement.

He groaned at the name and then playfully swatted your hips which were swaying along the tunes of some upbeat music you didn\u2019t know the name of.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cYou may want to go and sit on the dining table and stop disturbing me, unless you want burnt breakfast\u201d you said turning around and hitting him lightly on the shoulder with the spatula. \u201cOh! Spare the burnt food, I may even eat poison if it meant I got to see your annoyed face and swaying hips together on the same morning.\u201d He said cheekily, chuckling as you gave him the finger.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  It was a comparatively normal morning, given the lives you and your husband led. It was domestic and mellow and perfect. Exactly how you wanted the day to be in order for the future events to unfold properly. You served the breakfast and tried to enjoy the silence and calm while it lasted because you knew that the day was going to turn upside down soon enough.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But your jittery nerves didn\u2019t even let you eat. But you were not so sure. There may be other reasons why you may experience a loss of appetite given the current circumstances. He got up, picking up his empty plate and looked funnily at you. You were never the one to eat slowly or pick at your food. You just smiled sheepishly at him and tried to eat whatever was on your plate. He probably brushed it off and started to head towards the washroom to shower and get ready for the day. He was heading exactly where you had put a little surprise gift for him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You started feeling overly nervous and unsure about the \u2018surprise\u2019. Maybe you should\u2019ve waited a bit more. You were trying to think of ways you could use to prevent him from discovering the secret surprise, when you heard a loud and shaky, shocked \u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d coming from the washroom. You let out a shaky gasp. He had found out. You started walking towards the washroom, getting ready and preparing yourself for a confrontation you were stupidly scared about.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N, there is a lizard in the shower! Make it go away. It\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d A lizard? That\u2019s not what he was supposed to fin\u2026\u2026You realized that he hadn\u2019t seen your surprise yet and you didn\u2019t know whether to sigh in relief or to smack your husband upside down on his head. Such a big grown up man and given the life and everything it consists of plus the big responsibility that\u2019s going to arrive on his head, he still wants you to get the lizard away. As if that little reptile is going to have his head off. You still went in there, all nervousness thrown out of the window when you saw him crouching behind the toilet seat, pointing towards a little lizard that was busy minding its own business.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You huffed and went ahead to caressingly get the little reptile on your palm. You turned around to show him that the lizard meant no harm, only see a sight that made all air leave your lungs. Y/H was standing there holding the little surprise in his hand checking it out carefully and you saw his eyes widen as he realized what he was holding. A soft, almost silent \u201cOh god\u201d left his lips, his face contorted in an expression you didn\u2019t recognize what it was. He lifted his head, eyes watery \u201cIs it true?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A little nod was all that was needed to make him come to you and engulf you into his warm embrace. The positive pregnancy test forgotten on the sink counter. You felt tears running down your eyes as an elated laughter bubbled out of his throat. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to be parents!!?!!!?!?!\u201d he asked, rather exclaimed. It made you burrow your head further into his neck, a soft whisper of yes escaping your mouth, all fear and jittery nerves vanished. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIs it inside you? The baby? Of course it is. What even am I asking? But when did you know? Do you have a bump? I don\u2019t feel a bump.\u201d You laughed at his excitement. Any other time you would\u2019ve rolled your eyes or scoffed at him, but this time around you knew how exciting it was and hence you answered his queries. \u201cWell it\u2019s not a baby yet.

But all you could do is imagine how wonderful of a family you would be after the entry of your little baby.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><h2>TAGS:</h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mugoacriUvZH87TUXE-HXcg\">@wehaveabucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mibC2DhWExoUAmd20xLWBcA\">@samingtonwilson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDhavbBsQjVlM4_JmHG3ESQ\">@softlybarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrUIMqKGOBCo0jtMze7Mx1Q\">@irndad</a> @dragoncreek319 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Il4i2ckyN0vzjX5N6fQHw\">@jurassicbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpUm_O12UcL9lOu2aIfeMUg\">@thewnchstrs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msZ-KeCsMbH-YFsWSdG4OZA\">@whyisbuckyso</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX4DwaXdEzM7NzDPLalwb1Q\">@babylevines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muAIH7bv13MuZ6fSfzbvPbA\">@papi-chulo-bucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mI_x5WFb-_drDGQeiPCm5dg\">@captainrogerss</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPO9WoK2WIqVG-ukY8g9T_g\">@violentlybarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md6cldVDbkTC0macMNr_KmA\">@carryonmywaywardcaptain</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0rXN9za17Im2tlmbraQYPQ\">@sumafamouxx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLi-IOxjBYfuvDleHfjL2Rg\">@221bshrlocked</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkr8sCpcWeZefu7q1NmUERw\">@buckynasty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxhqK0MWNUsbuvQBcEFAlbA\">@petalstofish</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgbfMROt5QE8eARgB9yjXtA\">@viktorkrumn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMQv5fkEjjXHgUT2OuLHOzw\">@radstiel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvXfqMRlwHLhGe48d2k-YFA\">@dont-you-dare-say-misha</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnaj7CQ9ULFmMYHnZhk-isg\">@jay-the-red</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPKqzroTvATbvDzRUdO6djw\">@winchesterwolf30</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOr3-9zBFw_IN2dV_3C2A9g\">@sophieasaurus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRen0IzNTE2YK0n-PpnQXIA\">@4narniand4aslan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m682edBqvp0Fufy-WxxaLmA\">@lupihn-s</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF--azoQrXosqbbZkpYrPnA\">@shawnmendesimagines0</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPKDb_WJVrnuj4tO3fBViCw\">@supernaturalimagine</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQisk0MVc_qslGVtcGSkx8w\">@castiel-winchester-of-the-lord</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9DhdQq1AXv4ggBupnn5LOA\">@luciousmalefoy</a></p></p>",

I'm an 18 year old teen who loves to draw, watch (and obsess over) movies, loves pipe and theater organs and enjoys stand-up comedy. Also I'm very hyperfixated on 'Animal Crossing: New Leaf,\u2019 \u2019The Nightmare Before Christmas,' 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show,' and my own characters. The Mayor of Halloween Town, Mr. Resetti and Dr. Shrunk are my top favorite characters, but I absolutely adore my own characters and stories. Talk and send me asks, I love it when that happens. (Boy I sure do love my characters, Animal Crossing, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Steam Powered Giraffe, The Love Bug movie series, Captain Underpants, Harry Potter, Inside Out and much more that I can't remember at the moment.) I tag all of my art with \u201cMoffitt.\u201d</p>",
