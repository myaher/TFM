The previous event that you saw with your own\neyes flashed on the ceiling like a play in the theatre. You remember going into\na caf\u00e9 earlier this morning, after submitting your manuscript to your team. It\nturns out to be Jin\u2019s caf\u00e9 and you saw with your own eyes, Jin, your neighbour\nwas \u2018caught in act\u2019 while pushing the strand of a woman hair to the back of her\near. He looks like he was having fun; laughing, feeding each other and gazing\nat each other with love. He looks&hellip; <i>happy</i>.</p><p>You let out a sigh. No\nwonder he hasn\u2019t been at home much lately and stop texting you after a while. </p><p>You felt your heart\nclenched at the thought but heck, you can no longer conceal your own feeling.\nYou miss Jin. For these past few weeks, you have officially become a zombie,\nwalking around as if you\u2019re lifeless and it almost had you into trouble because\nyou almost missed your deadline but you strive your best to get out of it last\nminute before the deadline and saved yourself from an eternity of trouble of\ngetting yourself fired from your beloved publishing team. It\u2019ll be a pain to\nfind another publishing team.</p><!-- more --><p>There is an\nindescribable ache that lingers around your heart but vanish like a miracle\nwhen you saw his face, hear his voice or just merely reading goodnight messages\nfrom Jin. His existence himself made you feel all giddy and refreshed but it\nhas been about a month since you last heard from him. You yearned to hear\nsomething from him again, even if it\u2019s a simple <i>\u2018hi\u2019</i> like he did the moment you first met him. </p><p>Days feel like years.\nYou began to lost focus and you don\u2019t even find drawing \u2013 your sole hobby \u2013 to\nbe enjoying enough. You even spent sleepless nights thinking about him and\nhoping that he would appear in your dreams but it was all vain. Sometimes you\neven found yourself waiting for him to come out to the balcony and have a chat\nwhile drinking hot chocolate that he made. No matter what you do, what you say,\nthere is not a single moment when you don\u2019t think of him.</p><p>You find this as a\ntorture. It is tormenting you physically and mentally. You never know that\nmissing for someone would be this <i>bad</i>.\nThese is the first time you\u2019ve ever felt like this, and you dare to say that\nyou miss him more than you missed your parent who you lived with only a year\nbefore they passed away. This feeling hurts you so much. </p><p>Then, you first saw\nhim again this morning and it wasn\u2019t that pleasing to see from your point of\nview. You are not saying that Jin is not allowed to date because he is a free\nman. He can date all he want. It is you who are so stupid, thinking that you\nmight have a chance with him merely by a few exchanged conversations.</p><p>This is crazy, missing\nfor someone who you knew was thinking of someone else other than you. You\ndidn\u2019t realise that you\u2019re crying, wetting your pillow in the process.</p><p>You tried to throw\naway the image of him from your mind and you went to sleep with the pain hammering\nagainst your head and trace of tears on your cheeks.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDdung!\u201d\nyou recognize the voice. You turned to your right and saw him. Jin walked over\nto you with two cup of drinks. He had this huge and bright smile on his face. Probably\nsomething good happened. Whatever, you don\u2019t want to care so you faked a smile.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d you greeted.</p><p>\u201cI was about to go to\nyour house.\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d he handed you\none of the cup on his hand. </p><p>You took it and\nthanked him. He let his eyes settle on you for a while. You suddenly feel\nconscious about your appearance. You did your best trying to conceal the\nterrible dark circle under your eyes with your poor make up skills. Hope he\ndidn\u2019t notice it.</p><p>\u201cYou look great.\u201d he\ncompliment and you secretly sigh in relief. He didn\u2019t catch it. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the\nbookstore.\u201d </p><p>Your book has been\npublished and you\u2019re on your way to check it to see if there are any sales or\nnot because you\u2019re not that confident with this one. You got caught up with too\nmany troubles along the way.</p><p>\u201cOh, want me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeokjin oppa!\u201d a\nwoman voice interrupts you. Both turned to look at the <i>culprit</i> and you found yourself hard to breathe when it is the same\ngirl you saw at his caf\u00e9 the other day, approaching both of you \u2013 or just Jin.</p><p>\u201cOh, what are you\ndoing here?\u201d Jin asked, his face glowing.</p><p>\u201cWhy bother asking,\noppa\u2026Of course I\u2019m here for you.\u201d she lightly hit his chest and you wish you\nwere invisible rather than witnessing their moment.</p><p>You want to run away\nwhich you did, excusing yourself and ran towards the elevator, ignoring Jin\u2019s\ncalling for your name. This is it. You\u2019re done with Kim Seokjin. You will erase\nyour feelings for him and just like he said before, you will find someone who\nreally meant for you. </p>",

You\ndidn&rsquo;t realise that you&rsquo;re crying, wetting your pillow in the process.</p><p>You tried to throw\naway the image of him from your mind and you went to sleep with the pain hammering\nagainst your head and trace of tears on your cheeks.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ddung!&rdquo;\nyou recognize the voice. You turned to your right and saw him. Jin walked over\nto you with two cup of drinks. He had this huge and bright smile on his face. Probably\nsomething good happened. Whatever, you don&rsquo;t want to care so you faked a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; you greeted.</p><p>&ldquo;I was about to go to\nyour house.&rdquo; he said. </p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This.&rdquo; he handed you\none of the cup on his hand. </p><p>You took it and\nthanked him. He let his eyes settle on you for a while. You suddenly feel\nconscious about your appearance. You did your best trying to conceal the\nterrible dark circle under your eyes with your poor make up skills. Hope he\ndidn&rsquo;t notice it.</p><p>&ldquo;You look great.&rdquo; he\ncompliment and you secretly sigh in relief. He didn&rsquo;t catch it. </p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the\nbookstore.&rdquo; </p><p>Your book has been\npublished and you&rsquo;re on your way to check it to see if there are any sales or\nnot because you&rsquo;re not that confident with this one. You got caught up with too\nmany troubles along the way.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, want me to&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seokjin oppa!&rdquo; a\nwoman voice interrupts you. Both turned to look at the <i>culprit</i> and you found yourself hard to breathe when it is the same\ngirl you saw at his caf&eacute; the other day, approaching both of you &ndash; or just Jin.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, what are you\ndoing here?&rdquo; Jin asked, his face glowing.</p><p>&ldquo;Why bother asking,\noppa&hellip;Of course I&rsquo;m here for you.&rdquo; she lightly hit his chest and you wish you\nwere invisible rather than witnessing their moment.</p><p>You want to run away\nwhich you did, excusing yourself and ran towards the elevator, ignoring Jin&rsquo;s\ncalling for your name. This is it. You&rsquo;re done with Kim Seokjin. You will erase\nyour feelings for him and just like he said before, you will find someone who\nreally meant for you. </p></p>",

It\nturns out to be Jin&rsquo;s caf&eacute; and you saw with your own eyes, Jin, your neighbour\nwas &lsquo;caught in act&rsquo; while pushing the strand of a woman hair to the back of her\near.
