He ventures a look up, going back to his phone when he fails to spot the shock of chestnut curls he\u2019s looking for. It\u2019s a few minutes later when he hears the chirp of a bright \u201chi!\u201d in front of him.</p><p>He looks up, smile inadvertently tugging at his lips when he sees the beanie, light pink pom-pom hanging off the back only adding to the cuteness of the boy\u2019s cold-flushed cheeks and red tipped nose, bundled adorably in an oversized parka that swallows him whole. \u201cPete! Finally, \u2018m freezing my ass off out here,\u201d he complains, depositing the cigarette in a nearby ashtray.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe if you didn\u2019t wear leather jackets in the winter while it\u2019s snowing, you wouldn\u2019t be cold!\u201d Peter exclaims, cheerful as ever, and Tony chuckles, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cSmartass. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go.\u201d Tony leads the way to his car, opening Peter\u2019s door for him, resisting the urge to tilt his head and go for the boy\u2019s lips when Peter places a kiss on his cheek in thanks. He shuts the door and jogs around to the other side, rubbing his hands together for warmth after he gets inside and turns on the heater.</p><p>Movement catches his attentions, and Tony turns to see Peter pull off his hat, running a hand through his hair, shaking the curls out and the snow off. Tony can\u2019t help himself, reaching out to tug lightly on the ear closest to him. \u201cAlways forget how pointy your ears are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeyyy,\u201d Peter whines, slapping Tony\u2019s hand away. \u201cI told you, all fairies have pointy ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, you\u2019re still on that? Fuck, you\u2019re lucky you\u2019re pretty, otherwise you\u2019d be at the bottom of the social ladder. I\u2019d be annihilated for just looking at you.\u201d Tony starts the car, turning over his shoulder to reverse out of the parking space. </p><p>Peter rolls his eyes, mouth pursing in distaste. \u201cYou humans. So petty.\u201d</p><p>Tony chooses not to comment on Peter\u2019s identical nature completely human. They spend the rest of the ride talking about anything and everything, jokes and banter coming quick and easy. Peter makes Tony laugh, Tony makes Peter giggle, and by the time they get home, he forgets all about Peter\u2019s \u2018eccentricities\u2019.</p><p>They make it home and up to Peter\u2019s room, skipping past the kitchen once they realize no one\u2019s home. They peel off their wet outer layers, Tony with just his leather jacket, Peter with his parka, a light jacket, a hoodie, and a sweater under that.</p><p>\u201cJesus, trynna get a heat stroke in negative ten degree weather?\u201d Tony questions from the corner, laughing.</p><p>Peter rounds on him with a pout, putting away his clothes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this, fairies get colder, quicker. It\u2019s warmer where we live.\u201d</p><p>Before Tony can respond, Peter pulls off his last sweater, light pink wings extending out behind his back. \u201cChrist, Pete, you still wear those? You should really give \u2018em back to whichever poor little girl you stole them from.\u201d</p><p>Peter takes the high road, sticking his tongue out before reaching for his laptop, the two of them beginning their work on their assignment. They research, write, and edit for hours, the sky gradually darkening as they work away. Its hours later when Tony looks up from his computer screen, cracking his neck and stretching his arms.</p><p>\u201cFuck, it\u2019s pretty dark outside, and the snow is still coming down pretty hard. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit, you\u2019re right.\u201d Peter helps Tony pack up, putting his stuff into his bag while the older boy pulls on his jacket. They walk to the front door together, Peter giving Tony a small peck on his cheek as he walks out of the door, a soft \u201cdrive safe\u201d whispered in his ear.</p><p>Tony smirks. \u201cAlways. \u2018Night, sweetheart. Sweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cText me when you get home!\u201d Peter calls, watching him get into the car and start it up. \u201cEven though I\u2019ll know,\u201d he mutters under his breath, shutting the door.</p><p>**</p><p>The first thing Tony sees when he manages to crack an eye open is pink. Endless amounts of pink that stretch as far as he can see, mixed in with what look like clouds of white. He sits up, doing a double take when his feet don\u2019t hit solid ground. He looks down, realizes he\u2019s <i>on </i>one of those floating cloud thingies.

                "content": "<p><h1><b>It&rsquo;s a Fairytale</b></h1><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLuB1phawTp9uDN0rRxoabw\">@marvelousgay</a> asked for&nbsp;&ldquo;fairy Peter like 5 foot nothing and slender and adorable with wings and pointy ears and Tony who&rsquo;s got feelings for this adorable dude but is like you&rsquo;re not a fucking fairy you&rsquo;re just a weirdo and makes Peter prove it somehow?&rdquo; took it in a slightly different direction, hope you like it nonetheless babes! sorry it took me a few days to get to it, hope you&rsquo;re feeling better now&nbsp;&#128149;</b></p><p>Tony leans against the wall, flicking through his phone, cigarette hanging loosely from the fingertips of his unoccupied hand. He ventures a look up, going back to his phone when he fails to spot the shock of chestnut curls he&rsquo;s looking for. It&rsquo;s a few minutes later when he hears the chirp of a bright &ldquo;hi!&rdquo; in front of him.</p><p>He looks up, smile inadvertently tugging at his lips when he sees the beanie, light pink pom-pom hanging off the back only adding to the cuteness of the boy&rsquo;s cold-flushed cheeks and red tipped nose, bundled adorably in an oversized parka that swallows him whole. &ldquo;Pete! Finally, &lsquo;m freezing my ass off out here,&rdquo; he complains, depositing the cigarette in a nearby ashtray.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, maybe if you didn&rsquo;t wear leather jackets in the winter while it&rsquo;s snowing, you wouldn&rsquo;t be cold!&rdquo; Peter exclaims, cheerful as ever, and Tony chuckles, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Smartass. C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Tony leads the way to his car, opening Peter&rsquo;s door for him, resisting the urge to tilt his head and go for the boy&rsquo;s lips when Peter places a kiss on his cheek in thanks. He shuts the door and jogs around to the other side, rubbing his hands together for warmth after he gets inside and turns on the heater.</p><p>Movement catches his attentions, and Tony turns to see Peter pull off his hat, running a hand through his hair, shaking the curls out and the snow off. Tony can&rsquo;t help himself, reaching out to tug lightly on the ear closest to him. &ldquo;Always forget how pointy your ears are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heyyy,&rdquo; Peter whines, slapping Tony&rsquo;s hand away. &ldquo;I told you, all fairies have pointy ears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jeez, you&rsquo;re still on that? Fuck, you&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;re pretty, otherwise you&rsquo;d be at the bottom of the social ladder. I&rsquo;d be annihilated for just looking at you.&rdquo; Tony starts the car, turning over his shoulder to reverse out of the parking space. </p><p>Peter rolls his eyes, mouth pursing in distaste. &ldquo;You humans. So petty.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chooses not to comment on Peter&rsquo;s identical nature completely human. They spend the rest of the ride talking about anything and everything, jokes and banter coming quick and easy. Peter makes Tony laugh, Tony makes Peter giggle, and by the time they get home, he forgets all about Peter&rsquo;s &lsquo;eccentricities&rsquo;.</p><p>They make it home and up to Peter&rsquo;s room, skipping past the kitchen once they realize no one&rsquo;s home. They peel off their wet outer layers, Tony with just his leather jacket, Peter with his parka, a light jacket, a hoodie, and a sweater under that.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, trynna get a heat stroke in negative ten degree weather?&rdquo; Tony questions from the corner, laughing.</p><p>Peter rounds on him with a pout, putting away his clothes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been over this, fairies get colder, quicker. It&rsquo;s warmer where we live.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Tony can respond, Peter pulls off his last sweater, light pink wings extending out behind his back. &ldquo;Christ, Pete, you still wear those? You should really give &lsquo;em back to whichever poor little girl you stole them from.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter takes the high road, sticking his tongue out before reaching for his laptop, the two of them beginning their work on their assignment. They research, write, and edit for hours, the sky gradually darkening as they work away. Its hours later when Tony looks up from his computer screen, cracking his neck and stretching his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, it&rsquo;s pretty dark outside, and the snow is still coming down pretty hard. I should go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Peter helps Tony pack up, putting his stuff into his bag while the older boy pulls on his jacket. They walk to the front door together, Peter giving Tony a small peck on his cheek as he walks out of the door, a soft &ldquo;drive safe&rdquo; whispered in his ear.</p><p>Tony smirks. &ldquo;Always. &lsquo;Night, sweetheart. Sweet dreams.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Text me when you get home!&rdquo; Peter calls, watching him get into the car and start it up. &ldquo;Even though I&rsquo;ll know,&rdquo; he mutters under his breath, shutting the door.</p><p>**</p><p>The first thing Tony sees when he manages to crack an eye open is pink. Endless amounts of pink that stretch as far as he can see, mixed in with what look like clouds of white. He sits up, doing a double take when his feet don&rsquo;t hit solid ground. He looks down, realizes he&rsquo;s <i>on </i>one of those floating cloud thingies. He looks closer to see what looks like blue grass and purple dirt and what the <i>fuck</i> is happening?!</p><p>&ldquo;Tony! You&rsquo;re awake!&rdquo; Tony whips around to see Peter fluttering over to him, pink wings flapping behind him as he hovers a few meters off the ground. Tony blinks a few times, because he doesn&rsquo;t remember getting high at Peter&rsquo;s house, and he&rsquo;s never hallucinated at this level, regardless of whatever drug he&rsquo;s been on.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, what the fuck did we take?&rdquo; It comes out harsher than intended but Tony&rsquo;s mildly concerned, wants to know how fast this high is going to wear off.</p><p>Peter comes closer, cupping Tony&rsquo;s cheek and running a thumb across the older boy&rsquo;s cheekbone, eyebrows creased in confusion. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Last thing I remember is being at your house, so I&rsquo;m assuming we took something, which is why I&rsquo;m high as fuck and hallucinating.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hallucinating what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god, don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t see it too!&rdquo; Tony cries, panicking.</p><p>&ldquo;See what, Tony?&rdquo; Peter looks more and more concerned with each passing minute, watching Tony morph from panicked to borderline hysterical.</p><p>&ldquo;This!&rdquo; Tony gestures wildly with his hand &ldquo;The pink sky and the floating cloud and all the fucked up colours and how <i>fucking hot it is.</i>&rdquo; His eyes widen further when he hears Peter&rsquo;s airy giggle, confounded that he finds anything about the situation remotely amusing.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hallucinating, silly. You got into an accident on the way home and your injuries were too severe, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to save you on Earth. So I brought you here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okayyyy,&rdquo; Tony intones, more than mildly concerned now that Peter had taken an even higher dose of whatever they&rsquo;d had than he had. &ldquo;And, for conversation&rsquo;s sake, where exactly is <i>here</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where the fairies are from!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; The bright and chipper and slightly manic smile on Peter&rsquo;s face is ringing all of Tony&rsquo;s warning bells and he just wants to get out of whatever fucking nightmare he&rsquo;s having. And then he&rsquo;s never hanging out with this kid again; honestly, the whole fairy thing should&rsquo;ve tipped him off. </p><p>&ldquo;Thinking about how long it&rsquo;s going to take for your high to wear off? When you&rsquo;re going to wake up in the real world?&rdquo; Peter questions, breaking Tony&rsquo;s train of thought.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, nothing like that. I believe this place is real&rdquo; &ndash; <i>sure he does</i> &ndash; &ldquo;Just wondering when you&rsquo;re gonna take me home,&rdquo; Tony finishes with a bright smile, hoping to sound convincing.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Well, that&rsquo;s easy enough to answer. Never!&rdquo; Peter exclaims, clapping his hands like he&rsquo;s just delivered the best news in the world.</p><p><i>Christ, this kid has fully lost it</i>. &ldquo;What do you mean, never?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The accident was so scary, I thought I was going to lose you for good,&rdquo; Peter says seriously, cupping Tony&rsquo;s face in his hands. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;re staying here, where I can keep you safe forever and ever.&rdquo;</p><p><i>The more time that passes, the more Tony realizes this isn&rsquo;t a nightmare he&rsquo;s waking up from.</i></p></p>",

It was an old photo booth, the kind to spit out a column of\nphotos when you were done. You doubted it worked, but as Peter pulled back the\ncurtain to sit inside, you saw the screen was on.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Want to give it a go?&rdquo; said Peter, grinning at you from\nthe small space. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck it,&rdquo; you say, climbing inside. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give her a\nshot!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He smiled at you, your legs almost flush against his in\nthe booth. It was smaller on the inside. His heart was racing, and as he\nwatched you press the buttons and toss in a few quarters, he hatched a small\nplan. His palms sweat at the thought, but he steeled his thoughts.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You sat back, and felt Peter sling his arm around your\nshoulder. You raised an eyebrow at him but didn&rsquo;t complain. A little heat rose to\nyour cheeks. He probably just did it for the photos.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the booth counts down to the first photo, you smile\nbrightly. The booth screen flashes, and the next countdown appears. 5 seconds.\nYou feel Peter tug at your shoulder, and you lean onto his, still smiling. You\nclose your eyes, and the next photo is taken.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You sit up, and as you open your eyes you see a flash of\nskin. Peter reached his free arm towards your face, tilting you gently towards\nhim. His eyes flitted around your face, and as he leaned towards you the booth\ntook a photo. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When your lips met his, you closed your eyes again. Your\nhand found its way into his hair, and you leaned into the kiss. Peter&rsquo;s lips\nwere soft, and he tasted vaguely of the soft pretzel you had shared minutes ago.\nThe booth took it&rsquo;s last photo and began talking loudly.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You pulled away, startled, then looked back at Peter.

I\u2019m gonna\u2026 I have to. I mean. Bye.\u201d Peter ran out of the building to Mr. Rhodes laughter and Mr Starks shocked expression.</p><p>Next thing he did was to call Ned. \u201cNed I will kill you. I will kill you painfully and slowly. You won\u2019t see it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve singlehandedly ruined my life. Oh god I have to move. I\u2019m gonna move to Canada, change my name, live underground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter you have to breathe, whatever I did I will fix it. Is this about telling MJ you like her?

But back to the topic at hand. What. Did. I. Do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Mr. Stark Dad.\u201d</p><p> \u201cOnly that? You had me scared there, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me? I called Mr. Stark Dad. I\u2019m gonna die. He\u2019s gonna kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that. And how is this my fault anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe playlists? The father comments?

He was probably just some guilt case and now he had scared Mr. Stark away because he was incapable of controlling his emotions. He walked out of the school on Friday, wondering what excuse he would make up to May for not going to the compound over the weekend like usual, only to find Happy waiting for him in the parking lot.

We really, really don\u2019t have to talk about it. I\u2019m sorry, it won\u2019t happen again, I promise -.\u201d</p><p>\u201c- you do know I love you right?\u201d</p><p>\u201c- again, I\u2019m sorry and you know what I\u2019ll just leave\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete, did you hear what I said? I love you. I don\u2019t mind you calling me dad. I really don\u2019t. I mean the amount of times I\u2019ve called you my kid in front of Rhodey is quite frankly embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is.\u201d Mr. Rhodes suddenly turned up. \u201cAt this point I\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t applied for adoption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhodey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Peter, after you ran out of the building after calling Tony Dad, he cried. I have never seen him so happy. Well, until he started panicking about you not meaning it and it being a mistake. It took three hours to calm him down and then he called Pepper about it to panic some more.\u201d</p><p>Peter stared at Mr. Rhodes completely floored. This had to be a joke.
