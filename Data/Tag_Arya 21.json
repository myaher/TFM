Arya Stark was supposed to be going on a roadtrip with her adoptive brother Jon Snow. One moment they were on the road laughing and talking about what they would hunt. Who would get the most kills and what they hoped to hunt. The next became a whirlwind as a car slammed into Jon&rsquo;s truck causing the vehicle roll across the road. When she awoke, her head ached, Jon was gone and she was alone. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; She called out in a raspy voice.</p><p>Nothing but silence. Feeling a running warmth on her face she knew it was blood. That would explain her head aching terribly. Arya wiggled and writhed making her way through the broken window of the passenger door. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Fuck!&rdquo; Grasping onto the frame a shard of glass cut deeply into her flesh. Arya clasped her hand scooting away from the truck, wincing as she removed the large shard from her palm. A deep red scarlet trickled down her arm staining her black leather jacket. Pulling out her pocket knife Arya cut a piece of her olive green shirt. Taking the piece of fabric she wrapped it tightly around her palm. Within her seconds it became soaked in blood. At least the head injury stopped bleeding. </p><p>Her grey eyes scanned the area desperately looking for someone. Anyone. Glancing in the truck she saw her Iphone, completley shattered. Fucking great. It was all dead silence. Just her, an autumn chill, and the smell of&hellip;decay? gasoline? Gagging at the putrid smell in the air she pulled her leather jacket upwards covering the bottom half of her face. With the blood loss now the smell she felt nauseous and dizzy. Arya slowly stood up when she felt a sudden pain in chest.</p><p><i>Broken ribs, </i> she thought.</p><p>Clutching her ribs she pressed on. The only sounds to be heard where her black combat boots crunching sticks and dried leaves in various colors of brown, red, and orange. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon! Jon! Where are you?&rdquo; Arya called out every few feet, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t funny! I don&rsquo;t like this prank. Where are you Jon?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.  She had no clue how long she walking. The pain, hunger, exhaustion helped fuel her anger.</p><p>&ldquo;JON! THIS ISN&rsquo;T FUCKING FUNNY!&rdquo; She screamed until her voice was hoarse. It didn&rsquo;t take long to hear a low, moaning in the distance. There was something about the moan and how it seemed to multiply didnt sit well. Her and Jon have seen enough zombie movies to know what that sound was. That was all fictional. It could never happen&hellip;could it?</p><p>Swallowing hard, she turned slowly to the left, to the right and behind her when the form of the moans came into view. Her eyes grew with fear. Not one, not two, it must have been at least ten. They moved slowly from between the trees. She could see the decaying corpses moving towards her. Smell the rotting flesh as they crept nearer. Arya bit her lip, channeling her breathing through her nostrils. All she had was a pocket knife. What would that do. Still she grabbed the knife popping out the blade. Her coal colored eyes looked frantically around her as she slowly walked backwards away from the dead.</p><p><i>I can do this</i>, she thought, <i>I can do this. Gods Jon where are you?</i></p><p>She worried for him now. He would never leave her. Maybe he went for help. Maybe he&hellip;maybe he.. No. He isn&rsquo;t dead. If anyone was prepared for an apocalypse, it was Jon. Arya continued walking slowly when her boot fell onto a branch. With a loud snap it was over. The Living Dead infront of moved a little faster closing in on her. To her left then her right more and more came into view. Blocking the pain in her body she turned and ran. She ran faster than any marathon she ever competed in. A hoard of zombies on her tail. She ran through in between the trees, branches sticking out scratching her face and grabbing at her clothes.  Sweat pouring down her face as moved fast as a wolf, praying to any god. Old or new to hear her cry of help. Making it to the road looking over all the empty cars for a sign of life. For Jon. A greying hand reached out from under a Honda Civic grabbing her ankle. </p><p>&ldquo;Get off!&rsquo; Slamming her opposite foot down on the exposed bone on the corpse. The arm pulled away from the hand. The corpse&rsquo;s head appeared attempting to bite at her leg. Jerking backwards Arya clasped her pocket knife shoving it into the head. The corpse finally laid motionless. </p><p>&quot;Behind you!&rdquo; A deep voice called. </p><p>Arya whirled behind her. The living dead she ran from were now reaching the road.</p><p>&ldquo;Seven hells&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rdquo; said the voice. Throwing her two daggers, &ldquo;s'all I got.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya took the daggers looking up at him curiously. He was taller than her by at least foot. Wearing dark blue jeans, black boots, a black jacket and red colored shirt. If the shirt was originally red or because of killing these damn things she wasn&rsquo;t sure. Hair black as night, under his sweaty brows, a piercing blue gaze holding her eyes. He was broad shouldered and she could tell he was physically fit. He looked strong like a bull. Now isn&rsquo;t the time for those thoughts. </p><p>&ldquo;Gendry.&rdquo; He said.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you asking or telling me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Telling. Why would I be asking if you&rsquo;re Gendry? I don&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo; </p><p>She scoffed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who raised you but, usually when you introduce yourself you say I&rsquo;m first. Like this, I&rsquo;m Arya.&rdquo; His eyes narrowed down on her.</p><p>&ldquo;You do know there&rsquo;s a hoarde of zombies coming right? The last thing you want to do is argue with a stranger on introductions? A stranger who is trying to help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes when they say it rudely <i>Gendry</i>.&rdquo; He noticed her bloodied bandage when she gripped the dagger.</p><p>&ldquo;You bitten?&rdquo; He asked. His tone changed from sarcastic to caution.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I cut myself looking for my brother, Jon Snow.&rdquo; She said sharply. He didn&rsquo;t need to know the whole story. Besides they had no time.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell you what Miss proper introductions-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Arya!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Arya. We get out of this alive and you can tell me all about introductions. If you can fight good, maybe I&rsquo;ll even help find your brother. I&rsquo;m looking for people too.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Deal&rdquo; she replied. Both of them stood ready to fight. Gendry held a machete in his hands, a bull ready to charge. Arya held the daggers ready to strike the dead, like a wolf waiting to strike its prey.</p>",

Arya Stark was supposed to be going on a roadtrip with her adoptive brother Jon Snow. One moment they were on the road laughing and talking about what they would hunt. Who would get the most kills and what they hoped to hunt. The next became a whirlwind as a car slammed into Jon\u2019s truck causing the vehicle roll across the road. When she awoke, her head ached, Jon was gone and she was alone. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d She called out in a raspy voice.</p><p>Nothing but silence. Feeling a running warmth on her face she knew it was blood. That would explain her head aching terribly. Arya wiggled and writhed making her way through the broken window of the passenger door. </p><p>\u201cAh! Fuck!\u201d Grasping onto the frame a shard of glass cut deeply into her flesh. Arya clasped her hand scooting away from the truck, wincing as she removed the large shard from her palm. A deep red scarlet trickled down her arm staining her black leather jacket. Pulling out her pocket knife Arya cut a piece of her olive green shirt. Taking the piece of fabric she wrapped it tightly around her palm. Within her seconds it became soaked in blood. At least the head injury stopped bleeding. </p><p>Her grey eyes scanned the area desperately looking for someone. Anyone. Glancing in the truck she saw her Iphone, completley shattered. Fucking great. It was all dead silence. Just her, an autumn chill, and the smell of\u2026decay? gasoline? Gagging at the putrid smell in the air she pulled her leather jacket upwards covering the bottom half of her face. With the blood loss now the smell she felt nauseous and dizzy. Arya slowly stood up when she felt a sudden pain in chest.</p><p><i>Broken ribs, </i> she thought.</p><p>Clutching her ribs she pressed on. The only sounds to be heard where her black combat boots crunching sticks and dried leaves in various colors of brown, red, and orange. </p><p>\u201cJon! Jon! Where are you?\u201d Arya called out every few feet, \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny! I don\u2019t like this prank. Where are you Jon?\u201d</p><p>Silence.  She had no clue how long she walking. The pain, hunger, exhaustion helped fuel her anger.</p><p>\u201cJON! THIS ISN\u2019T FUCKING FUNNY!\u201d She screamed until her voice was hoarse. It didn\u2019t take long to hear a low, moaning in the distance. There was something about the moan and how it seemed to multiply didnt sit well. Her and Jon have seen enough zombie movies to know what that sound was. That was all fictional. It could never happen\u2026could it?</p><p>Swallowing hard, she turned slowly to the left, to the right and behind her when the form of the moans came into view. Her eyes grew with fear. Not one, not two, it must have been at least ten. They moved slowly from between the trees. She could see the decaying corpses moving towards her. Smell the rotting flesh as they crept nearer. Arya bit her lip, channeling her breathing through her nostrils. All she had was a pocket knife. What would that do. Still she grabbed the knife popping out the blade. Her coal colored eyes looked frantically around her as she slowly walked backwards away from the dead.</p><p><i>I can do this</i>, she thought, <i>I can do this. Gods Jon where are you?</i></p><p>She worried for him now. He would never leave her. Maybe he went for help. Maybe he\u2026maybe he.. No. He isn\u2019t dead. If anyone was prepared for an apocalypse, it was Jon. Arya continued walking slowly when her boot fell onto a branch. With a loud snap it was over. The Living Dead infront of moved a little faster closing in on her. To her left then her right more and more came into view. Blocking the pain in her body she turned and ran. She ran faster than any marathon she ever competed in. A hoard of zombies on her tail. She ran through in between the trees, branches sticking out scratching her face and grabbing at her clothes.  Sweat pouring down her face as moved fast as a wolf, praying to any god. Old or new to hear her cry of help. Making it to the road looking over all the empty cars for a sign of life. For Jon. A greying hand reached out from under a Honda Civic grabbing her ankle. </p><p>\u201cGet off!\u2019 Slamming her opposite foot down on the exposed bone on the corpse. The arm pulled away from the hand. The corpse\u2019s head appeared attempting to bite at her leg. Jerking backwards Arya clasped her pocket knife shoving it into the head. The corpse finally laid motionless. </p><p>\"Behind you!\u201d A deep voice called. </p><p>Arya whirled behind her. The living dead she ran from were now reaching the road.</p><p>\u201cSeven hells\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHere\u201d said the voice. Throwing her two daggers, \u201cs'all I got.\u201d </p><p>Arya took the daggers looking up at him curiously. He was taller than her by at least foot. Wearing dark blue jeans, black boots, a black jacket and red colored shirt. If the shirt was originally red or because of killing these damn things she wasn\u2019t sure. Hair black as night, under his sweaty brows, a piercing blue gaze holding her eyes. He was broad shouldered and she could tell he was physically fit. He looked strong like a bull. Now isn\u2019t the time for those thoughts. </p><p>\u201cGendry.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking or telling me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTelling. Why would I be asking if you\u2019re Gendry? I don\u2019t know you.\u201d </p><p>She scoffed, \u201cI don\u2019t know who raised you but, usually when you introduce yourself you say I\u2019m first. Like this, I\u2019m Arya.\u201d His eyes narrowed down on her.</p><p>\u201cYou do know there\u2019s a hoarde of zombies coming right? The last thing you want to do is argue with a stranger on introductions? A stranger who is trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes when they say it rudely <i>Gendry</i>.\u201d He noticed her bloodied bandage when she gripped the dagger.</p><p>\u201cYou bitten?\u201d He asked. His tone changed from sarcastic to caution.</p><p>\u201cNo. I cut myself looking for my brother, Jon Snow.\u201d She said sharply. He didn\u2019t need to know the whole story. Besides they had no time.</p><p>\u201cTell you what Miss proper introductions-\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya!\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya. We get out of this alive and you can tell me all about introductions. If you can fight good, maybe I\u2019ll even help find your brother. I\u2019m looking for people too.\u201d</p><p> \u201cDeal\u201d she replied. Both of them stood ready to fight. Gendry held a machete in his hands, a bull ready to charge. Arya held the daggers ready to strike the dead, like a wolf waiting to strike its prey.</p></p>",
