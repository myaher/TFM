It\u2019s seriously the cutest thing ever. Also, I\u00a0highly recommend listening to the music from Paperman<b> </b>while you read this.\u00a0</i></p><p>He\u2019s standing on the train platform waiting for his usual morning train when it happens. The wind is blowing lightly against his face, and a chilly morning bite is present in the air. He\u2019s wearing his usual dress suit, complete with a black tie and messenger bag. A train zooms by behind him on one side of the platform as he\u2019s waiting for his on the other.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s holding a folder of financial forms in his left hand when he\u2019s suddenly hit by a flying piece of paper. Moments later, a young woman runs past him, chasing the paper like a game of tag that she\u2019s losing. He feels his eyes follow her down the platform as she catches up to the loose paper flying in the wind.\u00a0</p><p>Moments later, tucking the flyaway page into the folder in her hands, she joins him on the train platform, with an earnest smile on her face. He sends her a grin, feeling his eyes widen slightly at the sight of her. He\u2019s never quite seen a woman like her. Perhaps it\u2019s the red hair blowing in the wind, or maybe it\u2019s the emerald shade of her eyes that reminds him of the forest. But he can\u2019t quite tear his eyes away from her as she stands beside him on the platform.\u00a0</p><p>He hears another train pulling into the platform behind him, bringing a subsequent gust of wind in with it, and dislodging one of the papers from his folder. It blows into the woman\u2019s face, and her nose scrunches up in surprise at the offending paper. He blushes embarrassedly, plucking the flyaway page from her visage, and she laughs at the sight of a lipstick smudge right at the bottom of his financial statement form. For a moment, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever heard such a lovely sound. He glances down at the lipstick mark on his paper, before glancing up, only to find her gone. Looking around in a panic, he notices that she\u2019s boarded the train behind him, and he feels his heart sink slightly that he didn\u2019t catch her name. They smile at one another before her train pulls away.\u00a0</p><p>Twenty-five minutes later, he arrives at work, still staring at the lipstick smudge on the bottom of the paper, and thinking of the green-eyed woman. She\u2019s stuck with him somehow, despite the fact that he had only seen her for a matter of minutes, and he didn\u2019t even know her name.\u00a0</p><p>He looks out the window and is surprised to find her in the building across the street, working in an office with an open window. He tries waving his arms to get her attention, but she\u2019s too focussed on the papers in front of her to notice him. It\u2019s too loud to shout across the traffic zooming by below, but there\u2019s something in him that\u2019s intent on getting her to notice him.\u00a0</p><p>Determined to gain her attention, he eyes the stack of papers on his desk, and begins folding them into paper airplanes, and throwing them out the window one by one in an attempt to get her to notice him. One after another each airplane fails, some never making it two feet out the window, and others hitting the side of the building just inches away from their target. Back in his office, his boss is sending him varying degrees of disparaging looks as he hurls airplanes out the window in a panic, the pile dwindling rapidly.\u00a0</p><p>In desperation, having used all of the paper on his desk to no success, he uses the lipstick-marked paper, only to frown in disappointment when the wind carries the paper down towards the street below him. Across the street, the woman leaves the office, and he feels his heart sink at the prospect of losing the woman once more. In a split decision, he leaps from his desk and he dashes from his office in a panic to catch her before she disappears.\u00a0</p><p>Rushing across a busy street of traffic, nearly getting hit in the process, he fails to see which direction she went, and finds only the final airplane marked with lipstick, sitting on the pavement beneath his feet. Angered and frustrated, he picks up the offending page and throws it hard, soaring into the sky above the buildings.\u00a0</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, it travels two streets over and lands in an alleyway, joining many of the other paper airplanes that he had thrown. They all clutter the street, laying in sadness in the dark alley. Moments go by, and then, as if by magic, they begin to stir and fly from the ground. Travelling as if they are alive, the airplanes make their way a few streets over, and hit him like a gust of wind. Looking down at his body, he\u2019s covered in airplanes, and he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s ever been in such a strange situation in his life.\u00a0</p><p>Moving as if they have a mind of their own, a cloud of airplanes force him toward a nearby train station and onto a train, much to his confusion. Meanwhile, several blocks away, the lipstick-marked paper finds a red-haired woman at a flower stand and lands directly in front of her hand.\u00a0</p><p>Recognizing the lipstick-marked paper, she chases the airplane to another train station and aboard another train. She doesn\u2019t really know why she\u2019s following it. It is just a paper after all. But something about the man from the train platform that morning stuck with her, and she wants to know where the airplane is taking her. She\u2019s hoping it\u2019s to him.\u00a0</p><p>As the two trains converge at a station several stops later, the two are finally brought together; him still covered in paper airplanes and her holding his lipstick-marked paper airplane. Her eyes widen at the sight of him, amazed that they managed to find one another again. They step off of the trains at the same time and towards one another, both wearing equally relieved grins as they stare at each other.\u00a0</p><p>His black hair is ten times messier than it was when she saw him that morning, sticking up in ever which direction, and his hazel eyes are glowing in the sun from beneath his round spectacles. He\u2019s no longer holding a folder of papers, but his messenger bag is still slung over his right shoulder. She\u2019s certain she\u2019s never seen a more wonderful sight.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m James,\u201d he finally says, shaking the remaining airplanes off of his body and sticking his hand in her direction. She takes his hand in hers and smiles at the lipstick-marked paper airplane that remains in her left hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lily,\u201d she introduces herself, and she\u2019s certain that if magic was real, the feeling between them must have been it.\u00a0</p><p><i>Thank you for reading &amp; please feel free to come scream at me in my ask!</i></p>",

She&rsquo;s stuck with him somehow, despite the fact that he had only seen her for a matter of minutes, and he didn&rsquo;t even know her name.&nbsp;</p><p>He looks out the window and is surprised to find her in the building across the street, working in an office with an open window. He tries waving his arms to get her attention, but she&rsquo;s too focussed on the papers in front of her to notice him. It&rsquo;s too loud to shout across the traffic zooming by below, but there&rsquo;s something in him that&rsquo;s intent on getting her to notice him.&nbsp;</p><p>Determined to gain her attention, he eyes the stack of papers on his desk, and begins folding them into paper airplanes, and throwing them out the window one by one in an attempt to get her to notice him. One after another each airplane fails, some never making it two feet out the window, and others hitting the side of the building just inches away from their target. Back in his office, his boss is sending him varying degrees of disparaging looks as he hurls airplanes out the window in a panic, the pile dwindling rapidly.&nbsp;</p><p>In desperation, having used all of the paper on his desk to no success, he uses the lipstick-marked paper, only to frown in disappointment when the wind carries the paper down towards the street below him. Across the street, the woman leaves the office, and he feels his heart sink at the prospect of losing the woman once more. In a split decision, he leaps from his desk and he dashes from his office in a panic to catch her before she disappears.&nbsp;</p><p>Rushing across a busy street of traffic, nearly getting hit in the process, he fails to see which direction she went, and finds only the final airplane marked with lipstick, sitting on the pavement beneath his feet. Angered and frustrated, he picks up the offending page and throws it hard, soaring into the sky above the buildings.&nbsp;</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, it travels two streets over and lands in an alleyway, joining many of the other paper airplanes that he had thrown. They all clutter the street, laying in sadness in the dark alley. Moments go by, and then, as if by magic, they begin to stir and fly from the ground. Travelling as if they are alive, the airplanes make their way a few streets over, and hit him like a gust of wind. Looking down at his body, he&rsquo;s covered in airplanes, and he&rsquo;s not sure he&rsquo;s ever been in such a strange situation in his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving as if they have a mind of their own, a cloud of airplanes force him toward a nearby train station and onto a train, much to his confusion. Meanwhile, several blocks away, the lipstick-marked paper finds a red-haired woman at a flower stand and lands directly in front of her hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Recognizing the lipstick-marked paper, she chases the airplane to another train station and aboard another train. She doesn&rsquo;t really know why she&rsquo;s following it. It is just a paper after all. But something about the man from the train platform that morning stuck with her, and she wants to know where the airplane is taking her. She&rsquo;s hoping it&rsquo;s to him.&nbsp;</p><p>As the two trains converge at a station several stops later, the two are finally brought together; him still covered in paper airplanes and her holding his lipstick-marked paper airplane. Her eyes widen at the sight of him, amazed that they managed to find one another again. They step off of the trains at the same time and towards one another, both wearing equally relieved grins as they stare at each other.&nbsp;</p><p>His black hair is ten times messier than it was when she saw him that morning, sticking up in ever which direction, and his hazel eyes are glowing in the sun from beneath his round spectacles. He&rsquo;s no longer holding a folder of papers, but his messenger bag is still slung over his right shoulder. She&rsquo;s certain she&rsquo;s never seen a more wonderful sight.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m James,&rdquo; he finally says, shaking the remaining airplanes off of his body and sticking his hand in her direction. She takes his hand in hers and smiles at the lipstick-marked paper airplane that remains in her left hand.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Lily,&rdquo; she introduces herself, and she&rsquo;s certain that if magic was real, the feeling between them must have been it.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thank you for reading &amp; please feel free to come scream at me in my ask!</i></p></p>",

While he&rsquo;s sitting alone at the park, he makes two new friends. Jason and Dick.)</p><p>The first in a series inspiered by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPRZ3SlmNncrVnnpNPmxiQQ\">@hpfannons</a> Batfam/Harry Potter head canons. Thank you so much for letting me write this and for getting back to me so quickly ^-^</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Harry Potter wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about the city. The move to Gotham had been very sudden, Uncle Vernon had gotten a promotion and the whole family had to move. They would have left Harry in England but they couldn\u2019t find \u2018other arrangements\u2019 in time so they brought him along.</p><p>Dudley was going to the prestigious \u2018Gotham Academy\u2019 that was around twenty minutes drive away from the small house they all lived in. Aunt Petunia would drive him every day and pick him up. Harry was going to the public school that took him an hour and a half to walk to every morning. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t ever pick him up from even when it was pouring rain. So Harry got used to walking alone in the large city while it was getting dark. If he wasn\u2019t home by the time the street lamps turned on Aunt Petunia would lock him outside until Vernon got home from work. So Harry learned to run at least part way back home.</p><p>Harry liked the city sometimes because there were so many places he could slip away when his Aunt was screaming at him or if Vernon hit him with the belt. His favorite place was the park. On a Saturday afternoon, there were normally so many people there that no one could tell that Harry was alone. Sometimes he even got to play with kids his own age. Dudley couldn\u2019t chase them off, because Petunia never let him go to the park by himself. Sometimes there were scary people at the park but when they showed up, Harry learned that he needed to leave, just like everyone else did.</p><p>Sometimes Gotham was a really scary place to live. They had lived there for six months and in that time, Harry\u2019s school had gone on lockdown three times. The first time was because a guy had robbed a bank and barricaded himself in the middle school that was right next to Harry\u2019s campus. The next time was because a man that was called \u2018The Joker\u2019 had been spotted close by. The most recent time had been a disgruntled woman who threatened to blow up the city because&hellip;well no one really knew why.</p><p>Those were the times that Gotham was bad. But otherwise, he really liked his new home. He was back at the park, swinging on the swings, kicking his legs. He was waiting to see if there were any kids who wanted to play with him. It was weirdly empty for a Saturday. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh&hellip;hey there!\u201d He heard a friendly voice call out to him. He looked up and saw a young man approaching him with a boy who looked like he was twelve or thirteen years old. \u201cI\u2019m Dick, this is my younger brother, Jason. I was wondering if you would play with him?\u201d The man asked, pushing the boy forward a little bit. Jason looked up at his brother and rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason said with a shrug. \u201cLet\u2019s go play.\u201d</p><p>Harry slowed the swing and looked at the two hesitantly before he stood up and nodded. \u201cWe can go play in the sandbox and make a castle,\u201d Harry suggested pointing.</p><p>\u201cYep, sounds great, lead the way.\u201d Jason followed Harry and sat down in the sandbox with him. Jason watched as Harry started digging down in the dirt, pulling up sand that got wet from the last rain storm. Jason looked behind him where Dick was giving him a thumbs up. \u201cSo\u2026my brother and I noticed that you come here by yourself all the time. Where are your parents?\u201d Jason asked, a sigh leaving his lips.</p><p>Harry looked up with wide eyes, letting the wet sand slip out of his fingers. \u201cOh, they died in a car crash when I was a baby. My Aunt Petunia said that I got dumped with them after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well where is your aunt?\u201d Jason pressed.</p><p>Harry shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s at home. I come here so I don\u2019t have to be there. They don\u2019t like me very much.\u201d He shrugged and went back to making his sand castle.</p><p>Jason winced at how casually Harry said that. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eight years old, what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirteen\u2026\u201d Jason didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cHarry, nice to meet you, Jason.\u201d Harry had a bright smile and Jason couldn\u2019t help but smile back. They sat quietly for a few minutes and Jason helped Harry build his castle. Jason wouldn\u2019t have said anything else if Harry\u2019s stomach hasn&rsquo;t growled loudly. He flushed pink and put a hand over his stomach. \u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered, not meeting Jason\u2019s eyes. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, kid,\u201d Jason said. He grit his teeth together just slightly. \u201cDid you have anything to eat today?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Aunt Petunia let me have a piece of cheese this morning. I also had half an orange last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all?\u201d Jason asked, raising an eyebrow. When Harry nodded happily he sighed. \u201cAlright, how about my brother and I buy you some lunch?\u201d Harry was looking at him with wide eyes, then looked around like he thought something unpleasant was coming from behind. Jason stood up and dusted off his pants. He held his hand out to Harry and waited. Harry hesitated only for a few more seconds before slipping his small hand into Jason\u2019s.</p><p>Jason led him over to Dick who was scrolling through his phone. He looked up when Jason was standing right in front of him and smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Jay?\u201d He asked. Dick turned to Harry who was looking down at the ground bashfully. He raised an eyebrow at his brother.</p><p>\u201cHarry hasn\u2019t had anything to eat today,\u201d Jason said, letting go of Harry and slipping his hands into his jean pocket. \u201cI thought maybe we could get him a kid\u2019s meal or something.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOf course we can!\u201d Dick said brightly. He stood up and gestured with his head towards a blue car that was parked on the curb. \u201cDo you need to call someone to tell them where you are?\u201d He asked, already holding out his phone. Harry quickly shook his head. Dick frowned.</p><p>They loaded Harry up into the back of the car and drove towards the closest McDonald\u2019s. Harry wanted the chicken nuggets and a sprite. His meal also came with a Batman toy. They parked and watched Harry eat his food. He ate two nuggets and put the other two in the pocket of his baggy pants. Jason gave Dick a single nod the three of them pulled out of the parking lot. \u201cAlright Harry, where would you like us to take you?\u201d Dick asked.</p><p>\u201cOn Mayor street,\u201d he said, drinking the last of his soda. \u201cI can walk the rest of the way home from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026alright then.\u201d Dick drove silently and kept casting looks at Jason who was texting Alfred about the \u2018situation.\u2019 When Dick stopped the car Harry climbed out and waved goodbye to them before running the rest of the way to his front door.</p><p>He turned around and watched as Dick and Jason drove away. He looked up and saw that the street lights were on. He tried to open the door, but just like he expected it was locked. He sighed and sat down on the front step. Despite the situation, he was still really happy that he met Jason and Dick. He pressed his hand against his pocket where he felt the chicken nuggets waiting to be eaten later.</p><p>He got to see Dick again the next day. \u201cDo you want to build a sandcastle?\u201d He asked, pointing at the empty sandbox. \u201cI brought a bucket today!\u201d He smiled a pulled a green bucket out from behind his back. Harry\u2019s eyes brightened and he nodded. Dick guided him over to the sandbox and the two sat down next to two other children who were being watched by their mothers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make a magic castle,\u201d Harry said, whispering the forbidden word. He watched Dick closely and was surprised when the young man\u2019s smile brightened.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really cool, what\u2019s in the magic castle?\u201d He asked, helping Harry load up the bucket with sand.</p><p>Harry thought for a second. \u201cThere\u2019s a dragon! But he\u2019s a nice dragon. Also there a princess who lives there. But she and the dragon are friends and he scares away prince\u2019s she doesn\u2019t like. Oh! Also, there\u2019s a room that\u2019s always full of food!\u201d He excitedly helped Dick turn the bucket over.</p><p>\u201cHarry, can I ask you a few questions?\u201d Dick asked, helping Harry build a moat around the castle.</p><p>Harry shrugged, sticking his tongue and concentrating on the sand. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your aunt and uncle feed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I have to finish my chores first.\u201d</p><p>Dick swallowed but tried to keep his voice steady. \u201cWhat happens if you don\u2019t finish your chores?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Harry shifted uncomfortably. \u201cOh, well, I have to go to my cupboard without any food. Then if I don\u2019t finish my chores the next day I still won\u2019t get food but Uncle Vernon will hit me with his belt.\u201d</p><p>Dick took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cDo you get food from the school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t want to waste the money. She packs me a cheese stick and a bottle of water and my friend Alley asks her mom to pack me sandwiches a few times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of her.\u201d Dick forced a smile.\u201cSo can you tell me what you meant by you \u2018cupboard?\u2019 Is that a timeout space?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo the cupboard under the stairs I where I sleep!\u201d Harry said with a bright smile. \u201cWhen we moved from England I didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be cupboards here too!&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cAnd your uncle&hellip;does he hit you a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m bad.\u201d Harry shrugged. \u201cOr when I do something freaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do that\u2019s \u2018freaky\u2019?\u201d Dick asked, shifting closer to Harry.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not sure. Sometimes weird stuff just happens to me, and it\u2019s my fault, so Uncle Vernon hits me.\u201d Harry frowned, rolling a rock around on the ground. \u201cCan we not talk about this anymore?\u201d</p><p>Dick paused. \u201cSure thing, buddy. How about when we finish up our castle we go get something to eat, would you like that?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded excitedly and the two continued building their sand castle. Harry added a few windows before he decided he was hungry and asked Dick if they could go. Dick took him by the hand and even let Harry sit in the front seat. They went to a 24-hour diner and the red-haired waitress greeted Dick by name and took them to an area of the restaurant where there were no other people. \u201cYou can order anything you want off the menu, no price limit.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened and he looked at Dick like he was insane. \u201cYou really mean it? Even if it\u2019s ten dollars?\u201d He asked. Dick smiled and nodded. Harry looked down at the menu, scanning it quickly. \u201cCould I have this please?\u201d He asked, pointing to a picture of chicken strips. It was only about eight dollars, but Harry looked far too delighted for Dick to suggest he get anything else.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kate, I think we\u2019re ready,\u201d Dick smiled at the woman who walked over with the pad in hand. \u201cI will have the Slappy burger with the extra slap if you please.\u201d He grinned at the woman who rolled her eyes and wrote it down.</p><p>She looked at Harry, her lips turning up. \u201cWhat about you, hun?\u201d She asked. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe chicken strips please,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, it\u2019ll be ready soon.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at the pictures on the kids&rsquo; menu, coloring with the crayons that the waitress had left for them. \u201cI had a weird dream last night,\u201d he said absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was it about?\u201d Dick asked, taking a sip of iced tea.</p><p>\u201cThere was a motorcycle, it was flying.\u201d Harry made a whooshing sound and moved his hand like it was flying. Dick smiled at watched him. \u201cIt was a nice dream\u2026it almost felt like a memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had that dream before?\u201d Dick asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I must have, but I don\u2019t remember when.\u201d He went back to his coloring and neither of them said anything until \u2018Kate\u2019 brought their food out.</p><p>Dick watched Harry stuff fries into his pockets. He smiled at Kate. \u201cWhenever Harry comes in, will you give him something to eat? On me?\u201d He asked. She looked at the boy and nodded.</p><p>That night when Dick brought Harry home, they said they were going to meet up again after Harry got out of school on Friday. Dick said he\u2019d take him to the \u2018movie theater\u2019 with Jason. Harry ran up to his front porch with a huge smile. He turned the doorknob and it was unlocked. Aunt Petunia was talking happily to Dudley about something he\u2019d done in class.</p><p>What a smart boy he was. Harry huffed and rolled his eyes, walking into his cupboard and hiding his fries in a little box under the shelf the was above the mattress he had on the floor. He laid down and wrapped himself up in his blanket and grinned from ear to ear. Yes, Harry Potter loved Gotham city.</p>",

They don\u2019t like me very much.\u201d He shrugged and went back to making his sand castle.</p><p>Jason winced at how casually Harry said that. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eight years old, what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirteen\u2026\u201d Jason didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cHarry, nice to meet you, Jason.\u201d Harry had a bright smile and Jason couldn\u2019t help but smile back. They sat quietly for a few minutes and Jason helped Harry build his castle. Jason wouldn\u2019t have said anything else if Harry\u2019s stomach hasn\u2019t growled loudly. He flushed pink and put a hand over his stomach. \u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered, not meeting Jason\u2019s eyes. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, kid,\u201d Jason said. He grit his teeth together just slightly. \u201cDid you have anything to eat today?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Aunt Petunia let me have a piece of cheese this morning. I also had half an orange last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all?\u201d Jason asked, raising an eyebrow. When Harry nodded happily he sighed. \u201cAlright, how about my brother and I buy you some lunch?\u201d Harry was looking at him with wide eyes, then looked around like he thought something unpleasant was coming from behind. Jason stood up and dusted off his pants. He held his hand out to Harry and waited. Harry hesitated only for a few more seconds before slipping his small hand into Jason\u2019s.</p><p>Jason led him over to Dick who was scrolling through his phone. He looked up when Jason was standing right in front of him and smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Jay?\u201d He asked. Dick turned to Harry who was looking down at the ground bashfully. He raised an eyebrow at his brother.</p><p>\u201cHarry hasn\u2019t had anything to eat today,\u201d Jason said, letting go of Harry and slipping his hands into his jean pocket. \u201cI thought maybe we could get him a kid\u2019s meal or something.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOf course we can!\u201d Dick said brightly. He stood up and gestured with his head towards a blue car that was parked on the curb. \u201cDo you need to call someone to tell them where you are?\u201d He asked, already holding out his phone. Harry quickly shook his head. Dick frowned.</p><p>They loaded Harry up into the back of the car and drove towards the closest McDonald\u2019s. Harry wanted the chicken nuggets and a sprite. His meal also came with a Batman toy. They parked and watched Harry eat his food. He ate two nuggets and put the other two in the pocket of his baggy pants. Jason gave Dick a single nod the three of them pulled out of the parking lot. \u201cAlright Harry, where would you like us to take you?\u201d Dick asked.</p><p>\u201cOn Mayor street,\u201d he said, drinking the last of his soda. \u201cI can walk the rest of the way home from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026alright then.\u201d Dick drove silently and kept casting looks at Jason who was texting Alfred about the \u2018situation.\u2019 When Dick stopped the car Harry climbed out and waved goodbye to them before running the rest of the way to his front door.</p><p>He turned around and watched as Dick and Jason drove away. He looked up and saw that the street lights were on. He tried to open the door, but just like he expected it was locked. He sighed and sat down on the front step. Despite the situation, he was still really happy that he met Jason and Dick. He pressed his hand against his pocket where he felt the chicken nuggets waiting to be eaten later.</p><p>He got to see Dick again the next day. \u201cDo you want to build a sandcastle?\u201d He asked, pointing at the empty sandbox. \u201cI brought a bucket today!\u201d He smiled a pulled a green bucket out from behind his back. Harry\u2019s eyes brightened and he nodded. Dick guided him over to the sandbox and the two sat down next to two other children who were being watched by their mothers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make a magic castle,\u201d Harry said, whispering the forbidden word. He watched Dick closely and was surprised when the young man\u2019s smile brightened.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really cool, what\u2019s in the magic castle?\u201d He asked, helping Harry load up the bucket with sand.</p><p>Harry thought for a second. \u201cThere\u2019s a dragon! But he\u2019s a nice dragon. Also there a princess who lives there. But she and the dragon are friends and he scares away prince\u2019s she doesn\u2019t like. Oh! Also, there\u2019s a room that\u2019s always full of food!\u201d He excitedly helped Dick turn the bucket over.</p><p>\u201cHarry, can I ask you a few questions?\u201d Dick asked, helping Harry build a moat around the castle.</p><p>Harry shrugged, sticking his tongue and concentrating on the sand. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your aunt and uncle feed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I have to finish my chores first.\u201d</p><p>Dick swallowed but tried to keep his voice steady. \u201cWhat happens if you don\u2019t finish your chores?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Harry shifted uncomfortably. \u201cOh, well, I have to go to my cupboard without any food. Then if I don\u2019t finish my chores the next day I still won\u2019t get food but Uncle Vernon will hit me with his belt.\u201d</p><p>Dick took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cDo you get food from the school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t want to waste the money. She packs me a cheese stick and a bottle of water and my friend Alley asks her mom to pack me sandwiches a few times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of her.\u201d Dick forced a smile.\u201cSo can you tell me what you meant by you \u2018cupboard?\u2019 Is that a timeout space?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo the cupboard under the stairs I where I sleep!\u201d Harry said with a bright smile. \u201cWhen we moved from England I didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be cupboards here too!\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd your uncle\u2026does he hit you a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m bad.\u201d Harry shrugged. \u201cOr when I do something freaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do that\u2019s \u2018freaky\u2019?\u201d Dick asked, shifting closer to Harry.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not sure. Sometimes weird stuff just happens to me, and it\u2019s my fault, so Uncle Vernon hits me.\u201d Harry frowned, rolling a rock around on the ground. \u201cCan we not talk about this anymore?\u201d</p><p>Dick paused. \u201cSure thing, buddy. How about when we finish up our castle we go get something to eat, would you like that?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded excitedly and the two continued building their sand castle. Harry added a few windows before he decided he was hungry and asked Dick if they could go. Dick took him by the hand and even let Harry sit in the front seat. They went to a 24-hour diner and the red-haired waitress greeted Dick by name and took them to an area of the restaurant where there were no other people. \u201cYou can order anything you want off the menu, no price limit.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened and he looked at Dick like he was insane. \u201cYou really mean it? Even if it\u2019s ten dollars?\u201d He asked. Dick smiled and nodded. Harry looked down at the menu, scanning it quickly. \u201cCould I have this please?\u201d He asked, pointing to a picture of chicken strips. It was only about eight dollars, but Harry looked far too delighted for Dick to suggest he get anything else.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kate, I think we\u2019re ready,\u201d Dick smiled at the woman who walked over with the pad in hand. \u201cI will have the Slappy burger with the extra slap if you please.\u201d He grinned at the woman who rolled her eyes and wrote it down.</p><p>She looked at Harry, her lips turning up. \u201cWhat about you, hun?\u201d She asked. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe chicken strips please,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, it\u2019ll be ready soon.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at the pictures on the kids\u2019 menu, coloring with the crayons that the waitress had left for them. \u201cI had a weird dream last night,\u201d he said absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was it about?\u201d Dick asked, taking a sip of iced tea.</p><p>\u201cThere was a motorcycle, it was flying.\u201d Harry made a whooshing sound and moved his hand like it was flying. Dick smiled at watched him. \u201cIt was a nice dream\u2026it almost felt like a memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had that dream before?\u201d Dick asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I must have, but I don\u2019t remember when.\u201d He went back to his coloring and neither of them said anything until \u2018Kate\u2019 brought their food out.</p><p>Dick watched Harry stuff fries into his pockets. He smiled at Kate. \u201cWhenever Harry comes in, will you give him something to eat? On me?\u201d He asked. She looked at the boy and nodded.</p><p>That night when Dick brought Harry home, they said they were going to meet up again after Harry got out of school on Friday. Dick said he\u2019d take him to the \u2018movie theater\u2019 with Jason. Harry ran up to his front porch with a huge smile. He turned the doorknob and it was unlocked. Aunt Petunia was talking happily to Dudley about something he\u2019d done in class.</p><p>What a smart boy he was. Harry huffed and rolled his eyes, walking into his cupboard and hiding his fries in a little box under the shelf the was above the mattress he had on the floor. He laid down and wrapped himself up in his blanket and grinned from ear to ear. Yes, Harry Potter loved Gotham city.</p></p>",

While he\u2019s sitting alone at the park, he makes two new friends. Jason and Dick.)</p><p>The first in a series inspiered by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPRZ3SlmNncrVnnpNPmxiQQ\">@hpfannons</a> Batfam/Harry Potter head canons. Thank you so much for letting me write this and for getting back to me so quickly ^-^</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Harry Potter wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about the city. The move to Gotham had been very sudden, Uncle Vernon had gotten a promotion and the whole family had to move. They would have left Harry in England but they couldn\u2019t find \u2018other arrangements\u2019 in time so they brought him along.</p><p>Dudley was going to the prestigious \u2018Gotham Academy\u2019 that was around twenty minutes drive away from the small house they all lived in. Aunt Petunia would drive him every day and pick him up. Harry was going to the public school that took him an hour and a half to walk to every morning. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t ever pick him up from even when it was pouring rain. So Harry got used to walking alone in the large city while it was getting dark. If he wasn\u2019t home by the time the street lamps turned on Aunt Petunia would lock him outside until Vernon got home from work. So Harry learned to run at least part way back home.</p><p>Harry liked the city sometimes because there were so many places he could slip away when his Aunt was screaming at him or if Vernon hit him with the belt. His favorite place was the park. On a Saturday afternoon, there were normally so many people there that no one could tell that Harry was alone. Sometimes he even got to play with kids his own age. Dudley couldn\u2019t chase them off, because Petunia never let him go to the park by himself. Sometimes there were scary people at the park but when they showed up, Harry learned that he needed to leave, just like everyone else did.</p><p>Sometimes Gotham was a really scary place to live. They had lived there for six months and in that time, Harry\u2019s school had gone on lockdown three times. The first time was because a guy had robbed a bank and barricaded himself in the middle school that was right next to Harry\u2019s campus. The next time was because a man that was called \u2018The Joker\u2019 had been spotted close by. The most recent time had been a disgruntled woman who threatened to blow up the city because\u2026well no one really knew why.</p><p>Those were the times that Gotham was bad. But otherwise, he really liked his new home. He was back at the park, swinging on the swings, kicking his legs. He was waiting to see if there were any kids who wanted to play with him. It was weirdly empty for a Saturday. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026hey there!\u201d He heard a friendly voice call out to him. He looked up and saw a young man approaching him with a boy who looked like he was twelve or thirteen years old. \u201cI\u2019m Dick, this is my younger brother, Jason. I was wondering if you would play with him?\u201d The man asked, pushing the boy forward a little bit. Jason looked up at his brother and rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason said with a shrug. \u201cLet\u2019s go play.\u201d</p><p>Harry slowed the swing and looked at the two hesitantly before he stood up and nodded. \u201cWe can go play in the sandbox and make a castle,\u201d Harry suggested pointing.</p><p>\u201cYep, sounds great, lead the way.\u201d Jason followed Harry and sat down in the sandbox with him. Jason watched as Harry started digging down in the dirt, pulling up sand that got wet from the last rain storm. Jason looked behind him where Dick was giving him a thumbs up. \u201cSo\u2026my brother and I noticed that you come here by yourself all the time. Where are your parents?\u201d Jason asked, a sigh leaving his lips.</p><p>Harry looked up with wide eyes, letting the wet sand slip out of his fingers. \u201cOh, they died in a car crash when I was a baby. My Aunt Petunia said that I got dumped with them after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well where is your aunt?\u201d Jason pressed.</p><p>Harry shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s at home. I come here so I don\u2019t have to be there. They don\u2019t like me very much.\u201d He shrugged and went back to making his sand castle.</p><p>Jason winced at how casually Harry said that. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eight years old, what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirteen\u2026\u201d Jason didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cHarry, nice to meet you, Jason.\u201d Harry had a bright smile and Jason couldn\u2019t help but smile back. They sat quietly for a few minutes and Jason helped Harry build his castle. Jason wouldn\u2019t have said anything else if Harry\u2019s stomach hasn\u2019t growled loudly.

I also had half an orange last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all?\u201d Jason asked, raising an eyebrow.

It was only about eight dollars, but Harry looked far too delighted for Dick to suggest he get anything else.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kate, I think we\u2019re ready,\u201d Dick smiled at the woman who walked over with the pad in hand. \u201cI will have the Slappy burger with the extra slap if you please.\u201d He grinned at the woman who rolled her eyes and wrote it down.</p><p>She looked at Harry, her lips turning up. \u201cWhat about you, hun?\u201d She asked. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe chicken strips please,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, it\u2019ll be ready soon.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at the pictures on the kids\u2019 menu, coloring with the crayons that the waitress had left for them. \u201cI had a weird dream last night,\u201d he said absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was it about?\u201d Dick asked, taking a sip of iced tea.</p><p>\u201cThere was a motorcycle, it was flying.\u201d Harry made a whooshing sound and moved his hand like it was flying.

He smiled at Kate. \u201cWhenever Harry comes in, will you give him something to eat? On me?\u201d He asked. She looked at the boy and nodded.</p><p>That night when Dick brought Harry home, they said they were going to meet up again after Harry got out of school on Friday. Dick said he\u2019d take him to the \u2018movie theater\u2019 with Jason. Harry ran up to his front porch with a huge smile. He turned the doorknob and it was unlocked.

While he&rsquo;s sitting alone at the park, he makes two new friends. Jason and Dick.)</p><p>The first in a series inspiered by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPRZ3SlmNncrVnnpNPmxiQQ\">@hpfannons</a> Batfam/Harry Potter head canons. Thank you so much for letting me write this and for getting back to me so quickly ^-^</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Harry Potter wasn&rsquo;t sure how he felt about the city. The move to Gotham had been very sudden, Uncle Vernon had gotten a promotion and the whole family had to move. They would have left Harry in England but they couldn&rsquo;t find &lsquo;other arrangements&rsquo; in time so they brought him along.</p><p>Dudley was going to the prestigious &lsquo;Gotham Academy&rsquo; that was around twenty minutes drive away from the small house they all lived in. Aunt Petunia would drive him every day and pick him up. Harry was going to the public school that took him an hour and a half to walk to every morning. Aunt Petunia wouldn&rsquo;t ever pick him up from even when it was pouring rain. So Harry got used to walking alone in the large city while it was getting dark. If he wasn&rsquo;t home by the time the street lamps turned on Aunt Petunia would lock him outside until Vernon got home from work. So Harry learned to run at least part way back home.</p><p>Harry liked the city sometimes because there were so many places he could slip away when his Aunt was screaming at him or if Vernon hit him with the belt. His favorite place was the park. On a Saturday afternoon, there were normally so many people there that no one could tell that Harry was alone. Sometimes he even got to play with kids his own age. Dudley couldn&rsquo;t chase them off, because Petunia never let him go to the park by himself. Sometimes there were scary people at the park but when they showed up, Harry learned that he needed to leave, just like everyone else did.</p><p>Sometimes Gotham was a really scary place to live. They had lived there for six months and in that time, Harry&rsquo;s school had gone on lockdown three times. The first time was because a guy had robbed a bank and barricaded himself in the middle school that was right next to Harry&rsquo;s campus. The next time was because a man that was called &lsquo;The Joker&rsquo; had been spotted close by. The most recent time had been a disgruntled woman who threatened to blow up the city because&hellip;well no one really knew why.</p><p>Those were the times that Gotham was bad. But otherwise, he really liked his new home. He was back at the park, swinging on the swings, kicking his legs. He was waiting to see if there were any kids who wanted to play with him. It was weirdly empty for a Saturday. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;hey there!&rdquo; He heard a friendly voice call out to him. He looked up and saw a young man approaching him with a boy who looked like he was twelve or thirteen years old. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dick, this is my younger brother, Jason. I was wondering if you would play with him?&rdquo; The man asked, pushing the boy forward a little bit. Jason looked up at his brother and rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jason said with a shrug. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go play.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry slowed the swing and looked at the two hesitantly before he stood up and nodded. &ldquo;We can go play in the sandbox and make a castle,&rdquo; Harry suggested pointing.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, sounds great, lead the way.&rdquo; Jason followed Harry and sat down in the sandbox with him. Jason watched as Harry started digging down in the dirt, pulling up sand that got wet from the last rain storm. Jason looked behind him where Dick was giving him a thumbs up. &ldquo;So&hellip;my brother and I noticed that you come here by yourself all the time. Where are your parents?&rdquo; Jason asked, a sigh leaving his lips.</p><p>Harry looked up with wide eyes, letting the wet sand slip out of his fingers. &ldquo;Oh, they died in a car crash when I was a baby. My Aunt Petunia said that I got dumped with them after.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well where is your aunt?&rdquo; Jason pressed.</p><p>Harry shrugged. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s at home. I come here so I don&rsquo;t have to be there. They don&rsquo;t like me very much.&rdquo; He shrugged and went back to making his sand castle.</p><p>Jason winced at how casually Harry said that. &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m eight years old, what about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirteen&hellip;&rdquo; Jason didn&rsquo;t know what to say. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, nice to meet you, Jason.&rdquo; Harry had a bright smile and Jason couldn&rsquo;t help but smile back. They sat quietly for a few minutes and Jason helped Harry build his castle. Jason wouldn&rsquo;t have said anything else if Harry&rsquo;s stomach hasn&rsquo;t growled loudly. He flushed pink and put a hand over his stomach. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he muttered, not meeting Jason&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, kid,&rdquo; Jason said. He grit his teeth together just slightly. &ldquo;Did you have anything to eat today?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Aunt Petunia let me have a piece of cheese this morning. I also had half an orange last night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That all?&rdquo; Jason asked, raising an eyebrow. When Harry nodded happily he sighed. &ldquo;Alright, how about my brother and I buy you some lunch?&rdquo; Harry was looking at him with wide eyes, then looked around like he thought something unpleasant was coming from behind. Jason stood up and dusted off his pants. He held his hand out to Harry and waited. Harry hesitated only for a few more seconds before slipping his small hand into Jason&rsquo;s.</p><p>Jason led him over to Dick who was scrolling through his phone. He looked up when Jason was standing right in front of him and smiled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jay?&rdquo; He asked. Dick turned to Harry who was looking down at the ground bashfully. He raised an eyebrow at his brother.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry hasn&rsquo;t had anything to eat today,&rdquo; Jason said, letting go of Harry and slipping his hands into his jean pocket. &ldquo;I thought maybe we could get him a kid&rsquo;s meal or something.&rdquo; He shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course we can!&rdquo; Dick said brightly. He stood up and gestured with his head towards a blue car that was parked on the curb. &ldquo;Do you need to call someone to tell them where you are?&rdquo; He asked, already holding out his phone. Harry quickly shook his head. Dick frowned.</p><p>They loaded Harry up into the back of the car and drove towards the closest McDonald&rsquo;s. Harry wanted the chicken nuggets and a sprite. His meal also came with a Batman toy. They parked and watched Harry eat his food. He ate two nuggets and put the other two in the pocket of his baggy pants. Jason gave Dick a single nod the three of them pulled out of the parking lot. &ldquo;Alright Harry, where would you like us to take you?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p><p>&ldquo;On Mayor street,&rdquo; he said, drinking the last of his soda. &ldquo;I can walk the rest of the way home from there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;alright then.&rdquo; Dick drove silently and kept casting looks at Jason who was texting Alfred about the &lsquo;situation.&rsquo; When Dick stopped the car Harry climbed out and waved goodbye to them before running the rest of the way to his front door.</p><p>He turned around and watched as Dick and Jason drove away. He looked up and saw that the street lights were on. He tried to open the door, but just like he expected it was locked. He sighed and sat down on the front step. Despite the situation, he was still really happy that he met Jason and Dick. He pressed his hand against his pocket where he felt the chicken nuggets waiting to be eaten later.</p><p>He got to see Dick again the next day. &ldquo;Do you want to build a sandcastle?&rdquo; He asked, pointing at the empty sandbox. &ldquo;I brought a bucket today!&rdquo; He smiled a pulled a green bucket out from behind his back. Harry&rsquo;s eyes brightened and he nodded. Dick guided him over to the sandbox and the two sat down next to two other children who were being watched by their mothers.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make a magic castle,&rdquo; Harry said, whispering the forbidden word. He watched Dick closely and was surprised when the young man&rsquo;s smile brightened.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really cool, what&rsquo;s in the magic castle?&rdquo; He asked, helping Harry load up the bucket with sand.</p><p>Harry thought for a second. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dragon! But he&rsquo;s a nice dragon. Also there a princess who lives there. But she and the dragon are friends and he scares away prince&rsquo;s she doesn&rsquo;t like. Oh! Also, there&rsquo;s a room that&rsquo;s always full of food!&rdquo; He excitedly helped Dick turn the bucket over.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, can I ask you a few questions?&rdquo; Dick asked, helping Harry build a moat around the castle.</p><p>Harry shrugged, sticking his tongue and concentrating on the sand. &ldquo;Yeah, okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do your aunt and uncle feed you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I have to finish my chores first.&rdquo;</p><p>Dick swallowed but tried to keep his voice steady. &ldquo;What happens if you don&rsquo;t finish your chores?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>Harry shifted uncomfortably. &ldquo;Oh, well, I have to go to my cupboard without any food. Then if I don&rsquo;t finish my chores the next day I still won&rsquo;t get food but Uncle Vernon will hit me with his belt.&rdquo;</p><p>Dick took a deep breath and nodded. &ldquo;Do you get food from the school?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Aunt Petunia didn&rsquo;t want to waste the money. She packs me a cheese stick and a bottle of water and my friend Alley asks her mom to pack me sandwiches a few times a week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very nice of her.&rdquo; Dick forced a smile.&ldquo;So can you tell me what you meant by you &lsquo;cupboard?&rsquo; Is that a timeout space?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No the cupboard under the stairs I where I sleep!&rdquo; Harry said with a bright smile. &ldquo;When we moved from England I didn&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;d be cupboards here too!&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And your uncle&hellip;does he hit you a lot?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only when I&rsquo;m bad.&rdquo; Harry shrugged. &ldquo;Or when I do something freaky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you do that&rsquo;s &lsquo;freaky&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dick asked, shifting closer to Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;not sure. Sometimes weird stuff just happens to me, and it&rsquo;s my fault, so Uncle Vernon hits me.&rdquo; Harry frowned, rolling a rock around on the ground. &ldquo;Can we not talk about this anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>Dick paused. &ldquo;Sure thing, buddy. How about when we finish up our castle we go get something to eat, would you like that?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nodded excitedly and the two continued building their sand castle. Harry added a few windows before he decided he was hungry and asked Dick if they could go. Dick took him by the hand and even let Harry sit in the front seat. They went to a 24-hour diner and the red-haired waitress greeted Dick by name and took them to an area of the restaurant where there were no other people. &ldquo;You can order anything you want off the menu, no price limit.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes widened and he looked at Dick like he was insane. &ldquo;You really mean it? Even if it&rsquo;s ten dollars?&rdquo; He asked. Dick smiled and nodded. Harry looked down at the menu, scanning it quickly. &ldquo;Could I have this please?&rdquo; He asked, pointing to a picture of chicken strips. It was only about eight dollars, but Harry looked far too delighted for Dick to suggest he get anything else.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Kate, I think we&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; Dick smiled at the woman who walked over with the pad in hand. &ldquo;I will have the Slappy burger with the extra slap if you please.&rdquo; He grinned at the woman who rolled her eyes and wrote it down.</p><p>She looked at Harry, her lips turning up. &ldquo;What about you, hun?&rdquo; She asked. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The chicken strips please,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing, it&rsquo;ll be ready soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looked at the pictures on the kids&rsquo; menu, coloring with the crayons that the waitress had left for them. &ldquo;I had a weird dream last night,&rdquo; he said absentmindedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?
