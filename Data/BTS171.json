You couldn\u2019t hear him very clearly because the connection in the cabin he was staying in was just awful, but you still couldn\u2019t bring yourself to end the phone call.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d you admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll miss talking to you in those few upcoming days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. Namjoon and his groupmates were going to climb the Alps for the next few days and they wouldn\u2019t have connection, so this was your last phone call with your boyfriend until he got back to the cabin in three days. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you said, your heart warming up. \u201cYou stay safe as well, okay? Don\u2019t lose anything, especially not any limbs.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at this. \u201cI will try not to. We\u2019ll be taking a safe track and, besides, the filming crew will be with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re basically remaking the movie Everest, aren\u2019t you?\u201d you sighed, still concerned about your boyfriend \u2013 as clumsy as he was \u2013 going out to climb the mountains for the few upcoming days with no way for you to check if he was okay.</p><p>\u201cNot really, we won\u2019t be going up very high and I don\u2019t think the Alps are quite as dangerous,\u201d Namjoon said. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019ve never seen the movie, so you know \u2013 maybe this will turn out to be Everest: Bangtan Edition.\u201d</p><p>You were the one laughing now.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t <i>actually</i> attempt to climb the Everest on your next trip,\u201d you asked half-jokingly.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mention this idea to Jungkook, I think we\u2019re fine,\u201d Namjoon replied, both of you smiling in your respectful bedrooms, hundreds and hundreds of kilometers between you.</p><p>\u201cStay safe, please,\u201d you asked again after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cAnd give my best wishes to the rest of the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d your boyfriend said, sighing deeply as he realized \u2013 after noticing that it was well after 1am in his timezone already \u2013 that he couldn\u2019t prolong his conversation with you any longer. \u201cI have to go, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you said, trying not to sound too sad because you were really happy for him \u2013 he was going to experience something amazing with his friends \u2013 but, at the same time, you have never gone more than one day without talking to him in any way, so this was stressful. \u201cGet some rest tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he replied. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you in three days,\u201d he promised then. \u201cTake care of yourself for me, baby.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/64d4c06be16a907ef9836983c25ef1af/tumblr_inline_pj69e8QWwZ1rsrkv5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><p>The days when you didn\u2019t talk to your boyfriend didn\u2019t really drag <i>per se</i> \u2013 Namjoon wasn\u2019t at war, after all; he was having fun with his friends \u2013 but you still found yourself feeling lonely every night that you couldn\u2019t hear his voice. That was exactly why you had an alarm ready for the time Namjoon was supposed to return back to the cabin with the rest of the boys.</p><p>The alarm went off three days after your last phone call just like it was supposed to. But Namjoon didn\u2019t call.</p><p>Suddenly concerned, you debated giving him a call yourself but then decided against it \u2013 perhaps he was tired and went straight to sleep as soon as he returned. There was no point to bother him with your call. And besides, he was supposed to be the one to call you and not the other way around.</p><p>You waited. Anxiety seemed to expand in your stomach and spread throughout your body with each passing minute because you knew that no matter how forgetful and clumsy Namjoon was, he was still very punctual and he would have hated the thought of you worrying because of him. If he really was tired, he would have at least sent you a quick text to let you know that things were okay.</p><p>Something had to happen to him.</p><p>Finally, after not hearing from him for three and a half hours since the alarm you\u2019d set rang, you picked your phone up with shaky hands and found Namjoon\u2019s number, ready to dial it and deal with whatever happened next. If he was tired, you wouldn\u2019t talk long. All you needed was to hear his voice.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, Namjoon picked up on the first ring. The only concerning thing was that, although he answered the call, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon!\u201d you gasped breathlessly. \u201cHi. Can you hear me? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he answered slowly. He sounded different \u2013 his voice was weirdly slow and monotonous \u2013 \u00a0but perhaps that was just the exhaustion. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, did something happen?\u201d you asked, sitting down on your bed before you continued. Your body was shaking too hard for you to keep on standing. \u201cAre you okay? Did you get hurt? Where are y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m fine,\u201d he answered as you listened to an odd buzzing in the background of the call. \u201cI did a lot of thinking during the trip.\u201d</p><p>You were confused as you waited for him to carry on but, clearly, he needed reassurance that you were still listening, so you cleared your throat. \u201cRight. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have decided something,\u201d he said, his voice getting deeper with each word. A little surprised to hear the warped way he was talking, you pulled the phone away from your ear to check if you were truly talking to Namjoon \u2013 you were. Once you put the phone back to your ear, however, you\u2019ve missed part of what he\u2019d said, \u201c\u2014and it didn\u2019t make sense to me. So, I think we should end this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked, unable to guess what he could have said in the few seconds that you weren\u2019t listening to him. \u201cEnd what?\u201d<i></i></p><p>\u201cThis relationship,\u201d he said. A bolt of shock ran through your body and you were on your feet in a second, squinting your eyes in confusion. Instead of hearing him explain why he didn\u2019t call you, you heard him attempt to break up with you. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014what are you talking about?\u201d you asked. You absolutely weren\u2019t expecting this. \u201cDid something happen during the trip? A-are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Like I said, I just thought a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurts me to say this but I think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I was always honest with you and, the truth is, we don\u2019t belong together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-we don\u2019t belong together?\u201d you repeated, not even trying to conceal the disbelief in your voice. \u201cNamjoon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he cut you off. \u201cI have to say goodbye now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014Namjoon, I\u2014\u201d you tried but it was pointless as short beeps answered your words, indicating that he had hung up.</p><p>Blinking your eyes, you pulled your phone away, unable to tell if it was a real conversation you\u2019ve just had or if, perhaps, you\u2019d dreamt it all. Pinching yourself was no use \u2013 your whole body was numb.</p><p>You spent a good fifteen minutes just staring at your phone after Namjoon had ended the call. Replaying everything he\u2019d said, you tried to make sense of his words but couldn\u2019t, no matter how hard you tried.</p><p>How was it possible that a three-day mountain-climbing trip <g class=\"gr_ gr_608 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"608\" data-gr-id=\"608\">lead</g> Namjoon \u2013 who swore he loved you every night before he went to sleep \u2013 to a conclusion that he no longer wanted to be with you? What kind of thoughts did he get during the trip?</p><p>And, most importantly, what was the reason why he didn\u2019t call you sooner? Had something else happened that made him want to break up with you \u2013 what the hell could it have been?! \u2013 or was he just scared of telling you that he no longer wanted to be with you?</p><p>Lacking closure and needing a proper explanation about what was going on \u2013 you just couldn\u2019t understand why he would break up with you so out of the blue; it was extremely unlike Namjoon to give important news over the phone, not to mention how long it took him to <i>prepare</i> to give this news \u2013 you dialed his phone number again, only to be cut off by the operator, informing you that the person you were trying to reach was unavailable.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014he turned his phone off?\u201d you asked out loud, the hostility in your voice throwing you off.</p><p>You didn\u2019t think this was real. It didn\u2019t make much sense for Namjoon to play a prank on you, but it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense for him to abruptly break up with you, either. And you couldn\u2019t decide if you were starting to feel angry because you couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on or because a small\u2014and, clearly, very insecure\u2014part of you actually believed that there was a chance that Namjoon <i>did</i> decide to break up with you.</p><p>Suddenly, your phone started to ring and you nearly flinched in surprise. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t Namjoon\u2019s name that lit up your screen \u2013 it was Hoseok\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d you picked up, albeit tentatively.</p><p>First, a confusing call from your boyfriend \u2014 or was it ex-boyfriend now? \u2014 and then an unexpected call from his best friend? You dreaded to think what Hoseok was going to tell you.</p><p>\u201cHey! Where are you? We\u2019re back in Seoul,\u201d he said, his voice slightly panicked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re here?\u201d you asked, more confused by the second. \u201cW-where\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we ended up having to cut our climbing short \u2013 Yoongi got a fever but he\u2019s okay now \u2013 so we came back home. Uh, Namjoon lost his phone at the airport, though,\u201d Hoseok explained and you felt a cold wave wash over your body. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for it for the past three hours. Listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>Your heart almost stopped as your previously numb body suddenly became ice cold, freezing every thought you might have had, and only allowing you to reach the obvious conclusions: it wasn\u2019t Namjoon who\u2019d called you. He wasn\u2019t the one who broke up with you.</p><p>Interrupting Hoseok, you quietly spoke, \u201cI, um\u2014I think someone may have found his phone.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok was surprised to hear this. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I got a call from, uh\u2014from Namjoon, I had assumed,\u201d you explained, slowly starting to realize what had to have happened: someone chose to play a cruel prank on you. \u201cAbout two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible,\u201d Hoseok said, clearly struggling to understand what you\u2019ve already understood. \u201cNamjoon <i>lost </i>his phone\u2014are you sure the call was from him? You talked to him?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe your na\u00efve, ready-to-believe-anything mind. Had you really thought \u2013 even if just for a moment \u2013 that Namjoon would actually do something like this? He would <i>never</i> even try to. And you knew that. Or, at least, you thought you did.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d you confirmed, suddenly desperately wanting to hit something. \u201cIt even sounded like him. God, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, do you want to talk to him?\u201d Hoseok cut you off, noticing how the coldness slowly started to leave your voice, only to be replaced with desperate fury. Whatever <i>not-Namjoon</i> had said to you on the phone was clearly no longer Hoseok\u2019s business. \u201cHe\u2019s here right now. He went around the terminal with Taehyung but, uh, they didn\u2019t find anything from what I see. He\u2019s already extending his hand for the phone, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me,\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice replaced Hoseok\u2019s before the older boy finished his sentence. You inhaled deeply, your heart immediately starting to beat faster at the sound of your boyfriend\u2019s words \u2013 <i>this</i> was Namjoon. How could you ever mistake someone else for him? \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this. I-I misplaced my phone and I don\u2019t know where it is. I couldn\u2019t call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, uh\u2026\u201d you started to say, noticing how difficult it was to talk to him \u2013 even though you knew it was <i>really</i> him this time \u2013 after the fake break-up you went through not even half an hour ago. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure it\u2019s possible that my phone is just somewhere in my suitcase but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone found it, Joon,\u201d you cut him off, wanting to get this out faster so you could decide what to do next. \u201cSomeone found it and called me, pretending to be you.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon went quiet on the other end and you were starting to think your phone had died, but then he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d he asked, just as confused as Hoseok was before when you\u2019d tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to give him a quick breakthrough of what had happened. \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey, um, they broke up with me,\u201d you revealed, suddenly feeling choked. \u201cWell, I thought it was <i>you</i> doing the breaking-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Namjoon exhaled. He was much faster at understanding who had his phone than Hoseok was. \u201cAre you home right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m on my way,\u201d he said. \u201cBlock my number. If I\u2019ll want to call you until I get to your place, I\u2019ll have to figure out how to use a payphone. O-or I\u2019ll just take Hoseok\u2019s phone with me. Anyway &ndash; do not pick up any more calls from my number, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said weakly but then swallowed your tears and cleared your throat to try to lose the uncomfortable ball of anxiety stuck there. \u201cW-what are you going to do about the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about it, to be honest with you,\u201d Namjoon said. You were starting to have a hard time understanding him as the wind started to blow all around him. He must have left the airport already. \u201cBut I do know that no one will ever get away with this. How long ago did they call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very long,\u201d you said. \u201cAbout twenty or so minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, you spent twenty minutes thinking I wanted to break up with you,\u201d he spoke quietly, not needing you to say it \u2013 he could hear all the emotions you\u2019ve gone through in your voice. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>You could feel the tears returning \u2013 you didn\u2019t welcome them because you couldn\u2019t understand what was the point of crying; all had ended well, right? \u2013 so you shook your head to hopefully get rid of them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re okay. Right?\u201d</p><p>Inhaling sharply after your question, Namjoon stopped walking to give you his full attention.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever ask me that again,\u201d he warned you. \u201cWe are more than okay. We\u2019re perfect. I love you so much and I would never even think about breaking up with you. You have no idea how angry it makes me to hear you doubt that right now.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t want him to feel this way. You wanted to tell him that you never believed the words the person on the other end of the call had said while pretending to be him but you couldn\u2019t. The part of you that had considered it to be possible for Namjoon to break up with you over the phone had spread your hidden insecurity about this relationship all over your mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorr\u2014\u201d you started to say but Namjoon wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to see you,\u201d he said, not wanting you to apologize because he felt like he should have been the one saying sorry to you. Guilt was trying to eat him alive as he couldn\u2019t come up with an explanation why he didn\u2019t immediately use someone else\u2019s phone to let you know he\u2019d lost his. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you and kiss you to make up for this <i>and</i> for all the nights that I didn\u2019t get to see you. I love you, yeah? I love you very much and nothing \u2013 or no one \u2013 is ever going to change that even if they try. Okay?\u201d</p><p>You needed to hear this and he knew it. Namjoon never got tired of reassuring you that he loved you and that everything was going to work out when your anxiety acted up \u2013 he always knew what he had to say and he said it. And, although you felt bad that he\u2019d dropped every other errand he might have had after the trip just to see you, you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to tell him not to come.</p><p>You wanted to see him and you\u2019d have been right to assume that he wanted to see you just as much.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you nodded even if he couldn\u2019t see you, smiling gently as a warm tear still managed to slide down your cheek. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>",

You couldn\u2019t hear him very clearly because the connection in the cabin he was staying in was just awful, but you still couldn\u2019t bring yourself to end the phone call.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d you admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll miss talking to you in those few upcoming days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. Namjoon and his groupmates were going to climb the Alps for the next few days and they wouldn\u2019t have connection, so this was your last phone call with your boyfriend until he got back to the cabin in three days. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you said, your heart warming up. \u201cYou stay safe as well, okay? Don\u2019t lose anything, especially not any limbs.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at this. \u201cI will try not to. We\u2019ll be taking a safe track and, besides, the filming crew will be with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re basically remaking the movie Everest, aren\u2019t you?\u201d you sighed, still concerned about your boyfriend \u2013 as clumsy as he was \u2013 going out to climb the mountains for the few upcoming days with no way for you to check if he was okay.</p><p>\u201cNot really, we won\u2019t be going up very high and I don\u2019t think the Alps are quite as dangerous,\u201d Namjoon said. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019ve never seen the movie, so you know \u2013 maybe this will turn out to be Everest: Bangtan Edition.\u201d</p><p>You were the one laughing now.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t <i>actually</i> attempt to climb the Everest on your next trip,\u201d you asked half-jokingly.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mention this idea to Jungkook, I think we\u2019re fine,\u201d Namjoon replied, both of you smiling in your respectful bedrooms, hundreds and hundreds of kilometers between you.</p><p>\u201cStay safe, please,\u201d you asked again after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cAnd give my best wishes to the rest of the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d your boyfriend said, sighing deeply as he realized \u2013 after noticing that it was well after 1am in his timezone already \u2013 that he couldn\u2019t prolong his conversation with you any longer. \u201cI have to go, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you said, trying not to sound too sad because you were really happy for him \u2013 he was going to experience something amazing with his friends \u2013 but, at the same time, you have never gone more than one day without talking to him in any way, so this was stressful. \u201cGet some rest tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he replied. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you in three days,\u201d he promised then. \u201cTake care of yourself for me, baby.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/64d4c06be16a907ef9836983c25ef1af/tumblr_inline_pj69e8QWwZ1rsrkv5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><p>The days when you didn\u2019t talk to your boyfriend didn\u2019t really drag <i>per se</i> \u2013 Namjoon wasn\u2019t at war, after all; he was having fun with his friends \u2013 but you still found yourself feeling lonely every night that you couldn\u2019t hear his voice. That was exactly why you had an alarm ready for the time Namjoon was supposed to return back to the cabin with the rest of the boys.</p><p>The alarm went off three days after your last phone call just like it was supposed to. But Namjoon didn\u2019t call.</p><p>Suddenly concerned, you debated giving him a call yourself but then decided against it \u2013 perhaps he was tired and went straight to sleep as soon as he returned. There was no point to bother him with your call. And besides, he was supposed to be the one to call you and not the other way around.</p><p>You waited. Anxiety seemed to expand in your stomach and spread throughout your body with each passing minute because you knew that no matter how forgetful and clumsy Namjoon was, he was still very punctual and he would have hated the thought of you worrying because of him. If he really was tired, he would have at least sent you a quick text to let you know that things were okay.</p><p>Something had to happen to him.</p><p>Finally, after not hearing from him for three and a half hours since the alarm you\u2019d set rang, you picked your phone up with shaky hands and found Namjoon\u2019s number, ready to dial it and deal with whatever happened next. If he was tired, you wouldn\u2019t talk long. All you needed was to hear his voice.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, Namjoon picked up on the first ring. The only concerning thing was that, although he answered the call, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon!\u201d you gasped breathlessly. \u201cHi. Can you hear me? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he answered slowly. He sounded different \u2013 his voice was weirdly slow and monotonous \u2013 \u00a0but perhaps that was just the exhaustion. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, did something happen?\u201d you asked, sitting down on your bed before you continued. Your body was shaking too hard for you to keep on standing. \u201cAre you okay? Did you get hurt? Where are y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m fine,\u201d he answered as you listened to an odd buzzing in the background of the call. \u201cI did a lot of thinking during the trip.\u201d</p><p>You were confused as you waited for him to carry on but, clearly, he needed reassurance that you were still listening, so you cleared your throat. \u201cRight. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have decided something,\u201d he said, his voice getting deeper with each word. A little surprised to hear the warped way he was talking, you pulled the phone away from your ear to check if you were truly talking to Namjoon \u2013 you were. Once you put the phone back to your ear, however, you\u2019ve missed part of what he\u2019d said, \u201c\u2014and it didn\u2019t make sense to me. So, I think we should end this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked, unable to guess what he could have said in the few seconds that you weren\u2019t listening to him. \u201cEnd what?\u201d<i></i></p><p>\u201cThis relationship,\u201d he said. A bolt of shock ran through your body and you were on your feet in a second, squinting your eyes in confusion. Instead of hearing him explain why he didn\u2019t call you, you heard him attempt to break up with you. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014what are you talking about?\u201d you asked. You absolutely weren\u2019t expecting this. \u201cDid something happen during the trip? A-are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Like I said, I just thought a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurts me to say this but I think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I was always honest with you and, the truth is, we don\u2019t belong together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-we don\u2019t belong together?\u201d you repeated, not even trying to conceal the disbelief in your voice. \u201cNamjoon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he cut you off. \u201cI have to say goodbye now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014Namjoon, I\u2014\u201d you tried but it was pointless as short beeps answered your words, indicating that he had hung up.</p><p>Blinking your eyes, you pulled your phone away, unable to tell if it was a real conversation you\u2019ve just had or if, perhaps, you\u2019d dreamt it all. Pinching yourself was no use \u2013 your whole body was numb.</p><p>You spent a good fifteen minutes just staring at your phone after Namjoon had ended the call. Replaying everything he\u2019d said, you tried to make sense of his words but couldn\u2019t, no matter how hard you tried.</p><p>How was it possible that a three-day mountain-climbing trip <g class=\"gr_ gr_608 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"608\" data-gr-id=\"608\">lead</g> Namjoon \u2013 who swore he loved you every night before he went to sleep \u2013 to a conclusion that he no longer wanted to be with you? What kind of thoughts did he get during the trip?</p><p>And, most importantly, what was the reason why he didn\u2019t call you sooner? Had something else happened that made him want to break up with you \u2013 what the hell could it have been?! \u2013 or was he just scared of telling you that he no longer wanted to be with you?</p><p>Lacking closure and needing a proper explanation about what was going on \u2013 you just couldn\u2019t understand why he would break up with you so out of the blue; it was extremely unlike Namjoon to give important news over the phone, not to mention how long it took him to <i>prepare</i> to give this news \u2013 you dialed his phone number again, only to be cut off by the operator, informing you that the person you were trying to reach was unavailable.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014he turned his phone off?\u201d you asked out loud, the hostility in your voice throwing you off.</p><p>You didn\u2019t think this was real. It didn\u2019t make much sense for Namjoon to play a prank on you, but it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense for him to abruptly break up with you, either. And you couldn\u2019t decide if you were starting to feel angry because you couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on or because a small\u2014and, clearly, very insecure\u2014part of you actually believed that there was a chance that Namjoon <i>did</i> decide to break up with you.</p><p>Suddenly, your phone started to ring and you nearly flinched in surprise. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t Namjoon\u2019s name that lit up your screen \u2013 it was Hoseok\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d you picked up, albeit tentatively.</p><p>First, a confusing call from your boyfriend \u2014 or was it ex-boyfriend now? \u2014 and then an unexpected call from his best friend? You dreaded to think what Hoseok was going to tell you.</p><p>\u201cHey! Where are you? We\u2019re back in Seoul,\u201d he said, his voice slightly panicked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re here?\u201d you asked, more confused by the second. \u201cW-where\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we ended up having to cut our climbing short \u2013 Yoongi got a fever but he\u2019s okay now \u2013 so we came back home. Uh, Namjoon lost his phone at the airport, though,\u201d Hoseok explained and you felt a cold wave wash over your body. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for it for the past three hours. Listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>Your heart almost stopped as your previously numb body suddenly became ice cold, freezing every thought you might have had, and only allowing you to reach the obvious conclusions: it wasn\u2019t Namjoon who\u2019d called you. He wasn\u2019t the one who broke up with you.</p><p>Interrupting Hoseok, you quietly spoke, \u201cI, um\u2014I think someone may have found his phone.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok was surprised to hear this. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I got a call from, uh\u2014from Namjoon, I had assumed,\u201d you explained, slowly starting to realize what had to have happened: someone chose to play a cruel prank on you. \u201cAbout two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible,\u201d Hoseok said, clearly struggling to understand what you\u2019ve already understood. \u201cNamjoon <i>lost </i>his phone\u2014are you sure the call was from him? You talked to him?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe your na\u00efve, ready-to-believe-anything mind. Had you really thought \u2013 even if just for a moment \u2013 that Namjoon would actually do something like this? He would <i>never</i> even try to. And you knew that. Or, at least, you thought you did.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d you confirmed, suddenly desperately wanting to hit something. \u201cIt even sounded like him. God, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, do you want to talk to him?\u201d Hoseok cut you off, noticing how the coldness slowly started to leave your voice, only to be replaced with desperate fury. Whatever <i>not-Namjoon</i> had said to you on the phone was clearly no longer Hoseok\u2019s business. \u201cHe\u2019s here right now. He went around the terminal with Taehyung but, uh, they didn\u2019t find anything from what I see. He\u2019s already extending his hand for the phone, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me,\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice replaced Hoseok\u2019s before the older boy finished his sentence. You inhaled deeply, your heart immediately starting to beat faster at the sound of your boyfriend\u2019s words \u2013 <i>this</i> was Namjoon. How could you ever mistake someone else for him? \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this. I-I misplaced my phone and I don\u2019t know where it is. I couldn\u2019t call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, uh\u2026\u201d you started to say, noticing how difficult it was to talk to him \u2013 even though you knew it was <i>really</i> him this time \u2013 after the fake break-up you went through not even half an hour ago. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure it\u2019s possible that my phone is just somewhere in my suitcase but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone found it, Joon,\u201d you cut him off, wanting to get this out faster so you could decide what to do next. \u201cSomeone found it and called me, pretending to be you.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon went quiet on the other end and you were starting to think your phone had died, but then he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d he asked, just as confused as Hoseok was before when you\u2019d tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to give him a quick breakthrough of what had happened. \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey, um, they broke up with me,\u201d you revealed, suddenly feeling choked. \u201cWell, I thought it was <i>you</i> doing the breaking-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Namjoon exhaled. He was much faster at understanding who had his phone than Hoseok was. \u201cAre you home right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m on my way,\u201d he said. \u201cBlock my number. If I\u2019ll want to call you until I get to your place, I\u2019ll have to figure out how to use a payphone. O-or I\u2019ll just take Hoseok\u2019s phone with me. Anyway \u2013 do not pick up any more calls from my number, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said weakly but then swallowed your tears and cleared your throat to try to lose the uncomfortable ball of anxiety stuck there. \u201cW-what are you going to do about the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about it, to be honest with you,\u201d Namjoon said. You were starting to have a hard time understanding him as the wind started to blow all around him. He must have left the airport already. \u201cBut I do know that no one will ever get away with this. How long ago did they call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very long,\u201d you said. \u201cAbout twenty or so minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, you spent twenty minutes thinking I wanted to break up with you,\u201d he spoke quietly, not needing you to say it \u2013 he could hear all the emotions you\u2019ve gone through in your voice. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>You could feel the tears returning \u2013 you didn\u2019t welcome them because you couldn\u2019t understand what was the point of crying; all had ended well, right? \u2013 so you shook your head to hopefully get rid of them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re okay. Right?\u201d</p><p>Inhaling sharply after your question, Namjoon stopped walking to give you his full attention.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever ask me that again,\u201d he warned you. \u201cWe are more than okay. We\u2019re perfect. I love you so much and I would never even think about breaking up with you.

You couldn\u2019t hear him very clearly because the connection in the cabin he was staying in was just awful, but you still couldn\u2019t bring yourself to end the phone call.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d you admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll miss talking to you in those few upcoming days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. Namjoon and his groupmates were going to climb the Alps for the next few days and they wouldn\u2019t have connection, so this was your last phone call with your boyfriend until he got back to the cabin in three days. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you said, your heart warming up. \u201cYou stay safe as well, okay? Don\u2019t lose anything, especially not any limbs.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at this. \u201cI will try not to. We\u2019ll be taking a safe track and, besides, the filming crew will be with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re basically remaking the movie Everest, aren\u2019t you?\u201d you sighed, still concerned about your boyfriend \u2013 as clumsy as he was \u2013 going out to climb the mountains for the few upcoming days with no way for you to check if he was okay.</p><p>\u201cNot really, we won\u2019t be going up very high and I don\u2019t think the Alps are quite as dangerous,\u201d Namjoon said. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019ve never seen the movie, so you know \u2013 maybe this will turn out to be Everest: Bangtan Edition.\u201d</p><p>You were the one laughing now.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t <i>actually</i> attempt to climb the Everest on your next trip,\u201d you asked half-jokingly.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mention this idea to Jungkook, I think we\u2019re fine,\u201d Namjoon replied, both of you smiling in your respectful bedrooms, hundreds and hundreds of kilometers between you.</p><p>\u201cStay safe, please,\u201d you asked again after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cAnd give my best wishes to the rest of the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d your boyfriend said, sighing deeply as he realized \u2013 after noticing that it was well after 1am in his timezone already \u2013 that he couldn\u2019t prolong his conversation with you any longer. \u201cI have to go, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you said, trying not to sound too sad because you were really happy for him \u2013 he was going to experience something amazing with his friends \u2013 but, at the same time, you have never gone more than one day without talking to him in any way, so this was stressful. \u201cGet some rest tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he replied. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you in three days,\u201d he promised then. \u201cTake care of yourself for me, baby.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/64d4c06be16a907ef9836983c25ef1af/tumblr_inline_pj69e8QWwZ1rsrkv5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><p>The days when you didn\u2019t talk to your boyfriend didn\u2019t really drag <i>per se</i> \u2013 Namjoon wasn\u2019t at war, after all; he was having fun with his friends \u2013 but you still found yourself feeling lonely every night that you couldn\u2019t hear his voice. That was exactly why you had an alarm ready for the time Namjoon was supposed to return back to the cabin with the rest of the boys.</p><p>The alarm went off three days after your last phone call just like it was supposed to. But Namjoon didn\u2019t call.</p><p>Suddenly concerned, you debated giving him a call yourself but then decided against it \u2013 perhaps he was tired and went straight to sleep as soon as he returned. There was no point to bother him with your call. And besides, he was supposed to be the one to call you and not the other way around.</p><p>You waited. Anxiety seemed to expand in your stomach and spread throughout your body with each passing minute because you knew that no matter how forgetful and clumsy Namjoon was, he was still very punctual and he would have hated the thought of you worrying because of him. If he really was tired, he would have at least sent you a quick text to let you know that things were okay.</p><p>Something had to happen to him.</p><p>Finally, after not hearing from him for three and a half hours since the alarm you\u2019d set rang, you picked your phone up with shaky hands and found Namjoon\u2019s number, ready to dial it and deal with whatever happened next. If he was tired, you wouldn\u2019t talk long. All you needed was to hear his voice.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, Namjoon picked up on the first ring. The only concerning thing was that, although he answered the call, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon!\u201d you gasped breathlessly. \u201cHi. Can you hear me? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he answered slowly. He sounded different \u2013 his voice was weirdly slow and monotonous \u2013 \u00a0but perhaps that was just the exhaustion. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, did something happen?\u201d you asked, sitting down on your bed before you continued. Your body was shaking too hard for you to keep on standing. \u201cAre you okay? Did you get hurt? Where are y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m fine,\u201d he answered as you listened to an odd buzzing in the background of the call. \u201cI did a lot of thinking during the trip.\u201d</p><p>You were confused as you waited for him to carry on but, clearly, he needed reassurance that you were still listening, so you cleared your throat. \u201cRight. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have decided something,\u201d he said, his voice getting deeper with each word. A little surprised to hear the warped way he was talking, you pulled the phone away from your ear to check if you were truly talking to Namjoon \u2013 you were. Once you put the phone back to your ear, however, you\u2019ve missed part of what he\u2019d said, \u201c\u2014and it didn\u2019t make sense to me. So, I think we should end this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked, unable to guess what he could have said in the few seconds that you weren\u2019t listening to him. \u201cEnd what?\u201d<i></i></p><p>\u201cThis relationship,\u201d he said. A bolt of shock ran through your body and you were on your feet in a second, squinting your eyes in confusion. Instead of hearing him explain why he didn\u2019t call you, you heard him attempt to break up with you. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014what are you talking about?\u201d you asked. You absolutely weren\u2019t expecting this. \u201cDid something happen during the trip? A-are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Like I said, I just thought a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurts me to say this but I think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I was always honest with you and, the truth is, we don\u2019t belong together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-we don\u2019t belong together?\u201d you repeated, not even trying to conceal the disbelief in your voice. \u201cNamjoon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he cut you off. \u201cI have to say goodbye now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014Namjoon, I\u2014\u201d you tried but it was pointless as short beeps answered your words, indicating that he had hung up.</p><p>Blinking your eyes, you pulled your phone away, unable to tell if it was a real conversation you\u2019ve just had or if, perhaps, you\u2019d dreamt it all. Pinching yourself was no use \u2013 your whole body was numb.</p><p>You spent a good fifteen minutes just staring at your phone after Namjoon had ended the call. Replaying everything he\u2019d said, you tried to make sense of his words but couldn\u2019t, no matter how hard you tried.</p><p>How was it possible that a three-day mountain-climbing trip <g class=\"gr_ gr_608 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"608\" data-gr-id=\"608\">lead</g> Namjoon \u2013 who swore he loved you every night before he went to sleep \u2013 to a conclusion that he no longer wanted to be with you? What kind of thoughts did he get during the trip?</p><p>And, most importantly, what was the reason why he didn\u2019t call you sooner? Had something else happened that made him want to break up with you \u2013 what the hell could it have been?! \u2013 or was he just scared of telling you that he no longer wanted to be with you?</p><p>Lacking closure and needing a proper explanation about what was going on \u2013 you just couldn\u2019t understand why he would break up with you so out of the blue; it was extremely unlike Namjoon to give important news over the phone, not to mention how long it took him to <i>prepare</i> to give this news \u2013 you dialed his phone number again, only to be cut off by the operator, informing you that the person you were trying to reach was unavailable.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014he turned his phone off?\u201d you asked out loud, the hostility in your voice throwing you off.</p><p>You didn\u2019t think this was real. It didn\u2019t make much sense for Namjoon to play a prank on you, but it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense for him to abruptly break up with you, either. And you couldn\u2019t decide if you were starting to feel angry because you couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on or because a small\u2014and, clearly, very insecure\u2014part of you actually believed that there was a chance that Namjoon <i>did</i> decide to break up with you.</p><p>Suddenly, your phone started to ring and you nearly flinched in surprise. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t Namjoon\u2019s name that lit up your screen \u2013 it was Hoseok\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d you picked up, albeit tentatively.</p><p>First, a confusing call from your boyfriend \u2014 or was it ex-boyfriend now? \u2014 and then an unexpected call from his best friend? You dreaded to think what Hoseok was going to tell you.</p><p>\u201cHey! Where are you? We\u2019re back in Seoul,\u201d he said, his voice slightly panicked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re here?\u201d you asked, more confused by the second. \u201cW-where\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we ended up having to cut our climbing short \u2013 Yoongi got a fever but he\u2019s okay now \u2013 so we came back home. Uh, Namjoon lost his phone at the airport, though,\u201d Hoseok explained and you felt a cold wave wash over your body. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for it for the past three hours. Listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>Your heart almost stopped as your previously numb body suddenly became ice cold, freezing every thought you might have had, and only allowing you to reach the obvious conclusions: it wasn\u2019t Namjoon who\u2019d called you. He wasn\u2019t the one who broke up with you.</p><p>Interrupting Hoseok, you quietly spoke, \u201cI, um\u2014I think someone may have found his phone.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok was surprised to hear this. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I got a call from, uh\u2014from Namjoon, I had assumed,\u201d you explained, slowly starting to realize what had to have happened: someone chose to play a cruel prank on you. \u201cAbout two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible,\u201d Hoseok said, clearly struggling to understand what you\u2019ve already understood. \u201cNamjoon <i>lost </i>his phone\u2014are you sure the call was from him? You talked to him?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe your na\u00efve, ready-to-believe-anything mind. Had you really thought \u2013 even if just for a moment \u2013 that Namjoon would actually do something like this? He would <i>never</i> even try to. And you knew that. Or, at least, you thought you did.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d you confirmed, suddenly desperately wanting to hit something. \u201cIt even sounded like him. God, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, do you want to talk to him?\u201d Hoseok cut you off, noticing how the coldness slowly started to leave your voice, only to be replaced with desperate fury. Whatever <i>not-Namjoon</i> had said to you on the phone was clearly no longer Hoseok\u2019s business. \u201cHe\u2019s here right now. He went around the terminal with Taehyung but, uh, they didn\u2019t find anything from what I see. He\u2019s already extending his hand for the phone, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me,\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice replaced Hoseok\u2019s before the older boy finished his sentence. You inhaled deeply, your heart immediately starting to beat faster at the sound of your boyfriend\u2019s words \u2013 <i>this</i> was Namjoon. How could you ever mistake someone else for him? \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this. I-I misplaced my phone and I don\u2019t know where it is. I couldn\u2019t call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, uh\u2026\u201d you started to say, noticing how difficult it was to talk to him \u2013 even though you knew it was <i>really</i> him this time \u2013 after the fake break-up you went through not even half an hour ago. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure it\u2019s possible that my phone is just somewhere in my suitcase but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone found it, Joon,\u201d you cut him off, wanting to get this out faster so you could decide what to do next. \u201cSomeone found it and called me, pretending to be you.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon went quiet on the other end and you were starting to think your phone had died, but then he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d he asked, just as confused as Hoseok was before when you\u2019d tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to give him a quick breakthrough of what had happened. \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey, um, they broke up with me,\u201d you revealed, suddenly feeling choked. \u201cWell, I thought it was <i>you</i> doing the breaking-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Namjoon exhaled. He was much faster at understanding who had his phone than Hoseok was. \u201cAre you home right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m on my way,\u201d he said. \u201cBlock my number. If I\u2019ll want to call you until I get to your place, I\u2019ll have to figure out how to use a payphone. O-or I\u2019ll just take Hoseok\u2019s phone with me. Anyway \u2013 do not pick up any more calls from my number, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said weakly but then swallowed your tears and cleared your throat to try to lose the uncomfortable ball of anxiety stuck there. \u201cW-what are you going to do about the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about it, to be honest with you,\u201d Namjoon said. You were starting to have a hard time understanding him as the wind started to blow all around him. He must have left the airport already. \u201cBut I do know that no one will ever get away with this. How long ago did they call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very long,\u201d you said. \u201cAbout twenty or so minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, you spent twenty minutes thinking I wanted to break up with you,\u201d he spoke quietly, not needing you to say it \u2013 he could hear all the emotions you\u2019ve gone through in your voice. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>You could feel the tears returning \u2013 you didn\u2019t welcome them because you couldn\u2019t understand what was the point of crying; all had ended well, right? \u2013 so you shook your head to hopefully get rid of them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re okay. Right?\u201d</p><p>Inhaling sharply after your question, Namjoon stopped walking to give you his full attention.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever ask me that again,\u201d he warned you. \u201cWe are more than okay. We\u2019re perfect. I love you so much and I would never even think about breaking up with you. You have no idea how angry it makes me to hear you doubt that right now.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t want him to feel this way. You wanted to tell him that you never believed the words the person on the other end of the call had said while pretending to be him but you couldn\u2019t. The part of you that had considered it to be possible for Namjoon to break up with you over the phone had spread your hidden insecurity about this relationship all over your mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorr\u2014\u201d you started to say but Namjoon wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to see you,\u201d he said, not wanting you to apologize because he felt like he should have been the one saying sorry to you. Guilt was trying to eat him alive as he couldn\u2019t come up with an explanation why he didn\u2019t immediately use someone else\u2019s phone to let you know he\u2019d lost his. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you and kiss you to make up for this <i>and</i> for all the nights that I didn\u2019t get to see you.

You couldn&rsquo;t hear him very clearly because the connection in the cabin he was staying in was just awful, but you still couldn&rsquo;t bring yourself to end the phone call.</p><p>&ldquo;Me neither,&rdquo; you admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss talking to you in those few upcoming days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said. Namjoon and his groupmates were going to climb the Alps for the next few days and they wouldn&rsquo;t have connection, so this was your last phone call with your boyfriend until he got back to the cabin in three days. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be okay, though, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; you said, your heart warming up. &ldquo;You stay safe as well, okay? Don&rsquo;t lose anything, especially not any limbs.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed at this. &ldquo;I will try not to. We&rsquo;ll be taking a safe track and, besides, the filming crew will be with us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re basically remaking the movie Everest, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; you sighed, still concerned about your boyfriend &ndash; as clumsy as he was &ndash; going out to climb the mountains for the few upcoming days with no way for you to check if he was okay.</p><p>&ldquo;Not really, we won&rsquo;t be going up very high and I don&rsquo;t think the Alps are quite as dangerous,&rdquo; Namjoon said. &ldquo;Although, I&rsquo;ve never seen the movie, so you know &ndash; maybe this will turn out to be Everest: Bangtan Edition.&rdquo;</p><p>You were the one laughing now.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t <i>actually</i> attempt to climb the Everest on your next trip,&rdquo; you asked half-jokingly.</p><p>&ldquo;As long as you don&rsquo;t mention this idea to Jungkook, I think we&rsquo;re fine,&rdquo; Namjoon replied, both of you smiling in your respectful bedrooms, hundreds and hundreds of kilometers between you.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay safe, please,&rdquo; you asked again after a moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;And give my best wishes to the rest of the team.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will do,&rdquo; your boyfriend said, sighing deeply as he realized &ndash; after noticing that it was well after 1am in his timezone already &ndash; that he couldn&rsquo;t prolong his conversation with you any longer. &ldquo;I have to go, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; you said, trying not to sound too sad because you were really happy for him &ndash; he was going to experience something amazing with his friends &ndash; but, at the same time, you have never gone more than one day without talking to him in any way, so this was stressful. &ldquo;Get some rest tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you in three days,&rdquo; he promised then. &ldquo;Take care of yourself for me, baby.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/64d4c06be16a907ef9836983c25ef1af/tumblr_inline_pj69e8QWwZ1rsrkv5_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The days when you didn&rsquo;t talk to your boyfriend didn&rsquo;t really drag <i>per se</i> &ndash; Namjoon wasn&rsquo;t at war, after all; he was having fun with his friends &ndash; but you still found yourself feeling lonely every night that you couldn&rsquo;t hear his voice. That was exactly why you had an alarm ready for the time Namjoon was supposed to return back to the cabin with the rest of the boys.</p><p>The alarm went off three days after your last phone call just like it was supposed to. But Namjoon didn&rsquo;t call.</p><p>Suddenly concerned, you debated giving him a call yourself but then decided against it &ndash; perhaps he was tired and went straight to sleep as soon as he returned. There was no point to bother him with your call. And besides, he was supposed to be the one to call you and not the other way around.</p><p>You waited. Anxiety seemed to expand in your stomach and spread throughout your body with each passing minute because you knew that no matter how forgetful and clumsy Namjoon was, he was still very punctual and he would have hated the thought of you worrying because of him. If he really was tired, he would have at least sent you a quick text to let you know that things were okay.</p><p>Something had to happen to him.</p><p>Finally, after not hearing from him for three and a half hours since the alarm you&rsquo;d set rang, you picked your phone up with shaky hands and found Namjoon&rsquo;s number, ready to dial it and deal with whatever happened next. If he was tired, you wouldn&rsquo;t talk long. All you needed was to hear his voice.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, Namjoon picked up on the first ring. The only concerning thing was that, although he answered the call, he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon!&rdquo; you gasped breathlessly. &ldquo;Hi. Can you hear me? Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he answered slowly. He sounded different &ndash; his voice was weirdly slow and monotonous &ndash; &nbsp;but perhaps that was just the exhaustion. &ldquo;I need to talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God, did something happen?&rdquo; you asked, sitting down on your bed before you continued. Your body was shaking too hard for you to keep on standing. &ldquo;Are you okay? Did you get hurt? Where are y&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; he answered as you listened to an odd buzzing in the background of the call. &ldquo;I did a lot of thinking during the trip.&rdquo;</p><p>You were confused as you waited for him to carry on but, clearly, he needed reassurance that you were still listening, so you cleared your throat. &ldquo;Right. That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have decided something,&rdquo; he said, his voice getting deeper with each word. A little surprised to hear the warped way he was talking, you pulled the phone away from your ear to check if you were truly talking to Namjoon &ndash; you were. Once you put the phone back to your ear, however, you&rsquo;ve missed part of what he&rsquo;d said, &ldquo;&mdash;and it didn&rsquo;t make sense to me. So, I think we should end this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you asked, unable to guess what he could have said in the few seconds that you weren&rsquo;t listening to him. &ldquo;End what?&rdquo;<i></i></p><p>&ldquo;This relationship,&rdquo; he said. A bolt of shock ran through your body and you were on your feet in a second, squinting your eyes in confusion. Instead of hearing him explain why he didn&rsquo;t call you, you heard him attempt to break up with you. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t&mdash;what are you talking about?&rdquo; you asked. You absolutely weren&rsquo;t expecting this. &ldquo;Did something happen during the trip? A-are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Like I said, I just thought a lot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It hurts me to say this but I think it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. I was always honest with you and, the truth is, we don&rsquo;t belong together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-we don&rsquo;t belong together?&rdquo; you repeated, not even trying to conceal the disbelief in your voice. &ldquo;Namjoon&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he cut you off. &ldquo;I have to say goodbye now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&mdash;Namjoon, I&mdash;&rdquo; you tried but it was pointless as short beeps answered your words, indicating that he had hung up.</p><p>Blinking your eyes, you pulled your phone away, unable to tell if it was a real conversation you&rsquo;ve just had or if, perhaps, you&rsquo;d dreamt it all. Pinching yourself was no use &ndash; your whole body was numb.</p><p>You spent a good fifteen minutes just staring at your phone after Namjoon had ended the call. Replaying everything he&rsquo;d said, you tried to make sense of his words but couldn&rsquo;t, no matter how hard you tried.</p><p>How was it possible that a three-day mountain-climbing trip lead Namjoon &ndash; who swore he loved you every night before he went to sleep &ndash; to a conclusion that he no longer wanted to be with you? What kind of thoughts did he get during the trip?</p><p>And, most importantly, what was the reason why he didn&rsquo;t call you sooner? Had something else happened that made him want to break up with you &ndash; what the hell could it have been?! &ndash; or was he just scared of telling you that he no longer wanted to be with you?</p><p>Lacking closure and needing a proper explanation about what was going on &ndash; you just couldn&rsquo;t understand why he would break up with you so out of the blue; it was extremely unlike Namjoon to give important news over the phone, not to mention how long it took him to <i>prepare</i> to give this news &ndash; you dialed his phone number again, only to be cut off by the operator, informing you that the person you were trying to reach was unavailable.</p><p>&ldquo;What the&mdash;he turned his phone off?&rdquo; you asked out loud, the hostility in your voice throwing you off.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t think this was real. It didn&rsquo;t make much sense for Namjoon to play a prank on you, but it didn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense for him to abruptly break up with you, either. And you couldn&rsquo;t decide if you were starting to feel angry because you couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was going on or because a small&mdash;and, clearly, very insecure&mdash;part of you actually believed that there was a chance that Namjoon <i>did</i> decide to break up with you.</p><p>Suddenly, your phone started to ring and you nearly flinched in surprise. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t Namjoon&rsquo;s name that lit up your screen &ndash; it was Hoseok&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; you picked up, albeit tentatively.</p><p>First, a confusing call from your boyfriend &mdash; or was it ex-boyfriend now? &mdash; and then an unexpected call from his best friend? You dreaded to think what Hoseok was going to tell you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Where are you? We&rsquo;re back in Seoul,&rdquo; he said, his voice slightly panicked.</p><p>&ldquo;What? You&rsquo;re here?&rdquo; you asked, more confused by the second. &ldquo;W-where&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we ended up having to cut our climbing short &ndash; Yoongi got a fever but he&rsquo;s okay now &ndash; so we came back home. Uh, Namjoon lost his phone at the airport, though,&rdquo; Hoseok explained and you felt a cold wave wash over your body. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been looking for it for the past three hours. Listen&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart almost stopped as your previously numb body suddenly became ice cold, freezing every thought you might have had, and only allowing you to reach the obvious conclusions: it wasn&rsquo;t Namjoon who&rsquo;d called you. He wasn&rsquo;t the one who broke up with you.</p><p>Interrupting Hoseok, you quietly spoke, &ldquo;I, um&mdash;I think someone may have found his phone.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok was surprised to hear this. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I got a call from, uh&mdash;from Namjoon, I had assumed,&rdquo; you explained, slowly starting to realize what had to have happened: someone chose to play a cruel prank on you. &ldquo;About two hours ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; Hoseok said, clearly struggling to understand what you&rsquo;ve already understood. &ldquo;Namjoon <i>lost </i>his phone&mdash;are you sure the call was from him? You talked to him?&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t believe your na&iuml;ve, ready-to-believe-anything mind. Had you really thought &ndash; even if just for a moment &ndash; that Namjoon would actually do something like this? He would <i>never</i> even try to. And you knew that. Or, at least, you thought you did.</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; you confirmed, suddenly desperately wanting to hit something. &ldquo;It even sounded like him. God, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, do you want to talk to him?&rdquo; Hoseok cut you off, noticing how the coldness slowly started to leave your voice, only to be replaced with desperate fury. Whatever <i>not-Namjoon</i> had said to you on the phone was clearly no longer Hoseok&rsquo;s business. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s here right now. He went around the terminal with Taehyung but, uh, they didn&rsquo;t find anything from what I see. He&rsquo;s already extending his hand for the phone, so I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Namjoon&rsquo;s voice replaced Hoseok&rsquo;s before the older boy finished his sentence. You inhaled deeply, your heart immediately starting to beat faster at the sound of your boyfriend&rsquo;s words &ndash; <i>this</i> was Namjoon. How could you ever mistake someone else for him? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry about this. I-I misplaced my phone and I don&rsquo;t know where it is. I couldn&rsquo;t call you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s, uh&hellip;&rdquo; you started to say, noticing how difficult it was to talk to him &ndash; even though you knew it was <i>really</i> him this time &ndash; after the fake break-up you went through not even half an hour ago. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I figure it&rsquo;s possible that my phone is just somewhere in my suitcase but&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Someone found it, Joon,&rdquo; you cut him off, wanting to get this out faster so you could decide what to do next. &ldquo;Someone found it and called me, pretending to be you.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon went quiet on the other end and you were starting to think your phone had died, but then he finally spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo; he asked, just as confused as Hoseok was before when you&rsquo;d tried &ndash; and failed &ndash; to give him a quick breakthrough of what had happened. &ldquo;What did they say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They, um, they broke up with me,&rdquo; you revealed, suddenly feeling choked. &ldquo;Well, I thought it was <i>you</i> doing the breaking-up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; Namjoon exhaled. He was much faster at understanding who had his phone than Hoseok was. &ldquo;Are you home right now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m on my way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Block my number. If I&rsquo;ll want to call you until I get to your place, I&rsquo;ll have to figure out how to use a payphone. O-or I&rsquo;ll just take Hoseok&rsquo;s phone with me. Anyway &ndash; do not pick up any more calls from my number, do you hear me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you said weakly but then swallowed your tears and cleared your throat to try to lose the uncomfortable ball of anxiety stuck there. &ldquo;W-what are you going to do about the phone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t care less about it, to be honest with you,&rdquo; Namjoon said. You were starting to have a hard time understanding him as the wind started to blow all around him. He must have left the airport already. &ldquo;But I do know that no one will ever get away with this. How long ago did they call you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not very long,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;About twenty or so minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My God, you spent twenty minutes thinking I wanted to break up with you,&rdquo; he spoke quietly, not needing you to say it &ndash; he could hear all the emotions you&rsquo;ve gone through in your voice. &ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>You could feel the tears returning &ndash; you didn&rsquo;t welcome them because you couldn&rsquo;t understand what was the point of crying; all had ended well, right? &ndash; so you shook your head to hopefully get rid of them.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re okay. Right?&rdquo;</p><p>Inhaling sharply after your question, Namjoon stopped walking to give you his full attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever ask me that again,&rdquo; he warned you. &ldquo;We are more than okay. We&rsquo;re perfect. I love you so much and I would never even think about breaking up with you. You have no idea how angry it makes me to hear you doubt that right now.&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t want him to feel this way. You wanted to tell him that you never believed the words the person on the other end of the call had said while pretending to be him but you couldn&rsquo;t. The part of you that had considered it to be possible for Namjoon to break up with you over the phone had spread your hidden insecurity about this relationship all over your mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorr&mdash;&rdquo; you started to say but Namjoon wasn&rsquo;t having it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way to see you,&rdquo; he said, not wanting you to apologize because he felt like he should have been the one saying sorry to you. Guilt was trying to eat him alive as he couldn&rsquo;t come up with an explanation why he didn&rsquo;t immediately use someone else&rsquo;s phone to let you know he&rsquo;d lost his. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hold you and kiss you to make up for this <i>and</i> for all the nights that I didn&rsquo;t get to see you. I love you, yeah? I love you very much and nothing &ndash; or no one &ndash; is ever going to change that even if they try. Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>You needed to hear this and he knew it. Namjoon never got tired of reassuring you that he loved you and that everything was going to work out when your anxiety acted up &ndash; he always knew what he had to say and he said it. And, although you felt bad that he&rsquo;d dropped every other errand he might have had after the trip just to see you, you couldn&rsquo;t bring yourself to tell him not to come.</p><p>You wanted to see him and you&rsquo;d have been right to assume that he wanted to see you just as much.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you nodded even if he couldn&rsquo;t see you, smiling gently as a warm tear still managed to slide down your cheek. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p></p>",
