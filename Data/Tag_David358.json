She squinted toward where he was looking, curious.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nlook like a Byronian hero,\u201d she said, proud of herself at the reference, then laughed out loud when she\nheard\nwhat he was actually doing. \u201cYou\u2019re disgustin\u2019, mate!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nhad too much champagne earlier,\u201d he said, and winked. She turned\naround and waited for him to finish peeing.<br/></p><p>\u201cLet\nme borrow that bottle of water,\u201d he said as he zipped up. She had\none in her pocket.<br/></p><p>\u201cKeep\nit,\u201d she said, and handed it to him. He poured the water over his\nhands. \u201cEver the gentleman. They\u2019re just waiting on the priest.\nEncarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s ready.\u201d<br/></p><p>He\nsmiled. \u201cEncarnaci\u00f3n. Alphonse really rubbed off on you,\u201d he\nsaid.<br/></p><p>\u201cIn\nmore ways than one,\u201d she said, and wiggled her eyebrow. He laughed.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing.\nI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re happy with the Frenchman,\u201d he said. Now\nthat she was working toward her dream, she was fiery with\nself-confidence. He felt fortunate that they were able to fix things\nso easily. After he came back from his ma\u2019s, she was\nalready\nback at\nhouse. Although he wasn\u2019t ready to speak immediately, she waited\nuntil he was, which was\nhard for a woman like her. He was grateful for her patience, and to\nhave his friend again.<br/></p><p>\u201cSeriously,\nthough. You ready?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re\nasking me that? You moved in with Alphonse after three months,\u201d he\nsaid.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas mostly for convenience, and because Liv\u2019s selling the house.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nJohn said, making a funny face.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWe\nain\u2019t getting married, though,\u201d she said, shrugging. And they\nweren\u2019t. But her body was telling her that things were going to\nchange regardless. Soon. It\u2019s why she had only lemon water at the\npre-wedding cocktail party. And at bonfire the night before. Alphonse\nand her were going to Mexico after the wedding, and she planned to\ntell him there. She didn\u2019t know how it would go. All she was sure\nof is that she was keeping the baby. Sh looked toward the small\nwedding party. Maude tugged playfully on Olivia\u2019s frizzing hair -\nthe breeze wreaked havoc on it. Liv slapped her hand away and went\ninto her purse for a mirror. Monty was with Liv\u2019s parents back in\nEngland. She missed him terribly, and now that she was up the duff,\nit made her feel a lot more sympathetic about Olivia\u2019s decision to\nconceive, no matter the cost. At least they knew each other for a\nyear before she got pregnant.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you thinking?\u201d John said, looking intently at her face. It\npleased him to see that dating Alphonse gave her a glow - her cheeks\nwere rounding out, giving her a softer, more feminine look.<br/></p><p>She\nbrightened up. \u201cYou excited?\u201d She would tell John about the baby,\nbut later. This was his day.<br/></p><p>He\nwaved his hands in the breeze to dry them. \u201cIs it weird that it\ndoesn\u2019t feel like the second time around?\u201d he said. He smiled and\nbit his lip.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Alex said. \u201cYour love wiped the\nslate clean.\u201d</p><p>He\nnodded. \u201cI like that. I\u2019m using it,\u201d he said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nrealized after being with Alphonse that are all different kinds of\nlove,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d\nhe said, curious.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nmean, beyond the obvious,\u201d she said, referring to Liv being a woman\nand Alphonse being a man. \u201cEven though you\u2019re you and set in your\nways, you can\u2019t love different people in the same way. It\u2019s\nimpossible. You loved Mara in the way she allowed herself to be\nloved.\u201d He groaned. She patted his back. \u201cSorry to mention her.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\nit\u2019s okay. She was a part of my life for a very long time,\u201d he\nsaid.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd\nshe tried to shoehorn her way in again!\u201d she said. Not long after\nshe moved to Alphonse\u2019s, he called her late in the night, audibly\nshaken. She borrowed Alfie\u2019s Beamer and drove to Bristol in record\ntime. There, Mara sat in his living room, chattering away like\nnothing had changed. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you let \u2018er in.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas cold and rainy. She brought her baby,\u201d he said, referring to\nher daughter with the small time football player, Addie.<br/></p><p>\u201cFor\nsympathy points, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was a cute little\nbutton, though. Ginger as her mam. Either way, I let her know what\nwas what in short order,\u201d she said. She had given her a piece of\nher mind just as soon as she saw John\u2019s face. \u201cDid you ever tell\nEncarnaci\u00f3n?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\ncalled her right after you left,\u201d he said.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd\nwhat did she say?\u201d Alex said. She looked at the water bottle in\nJohn\u2019s hands, shrugged, and took it back for a sip.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\ndidn\u2019t say much, but she listened. For nearly two hours, I cried\nand babbled my stream-of-consciousness pain to her. I don\u2019t know\nwhy I did it. Maybe it was the little girl, or Mara\u2019s worn, faded face,\nor her genuine desperation. I thought my head would crack in two. I knew it might bother her, but I couldn\u2019t <i>not</i> tell her.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nAlex said.<br/></p><p>\u201cEh,\u201d\nhe said, nodding.<br/></p><p>\u201cBetween\nus, bruv\n&hellip;\ndid you feel something?\u201d<br/></p><p>John\nsighed, but his face was peaceful. \u201cI felt compassion. For Addie,\nmostly, but also for her. It hurt to see her so fragile and scared. I\nloved her so, so much. Deeply. She was my dream girl, Al. Ever since\nI was a boy. I remembered that, even though she wasn\u2019t quite the\nsame anymore.\u201d<br/></p><p>She\nlooked at him sympathetically, although she didn\u2019t feel any\nsympathy for Mara. She could only think of the condition she left him\nin after the divorce.<br/></p><p>\u201cSomething\nshifted in me, though, as she spoke. I noticed she never mentioned\nAddie, although the little one was right beside her. She spoke of\nchildish privations, and complained about how the football player\n&lsquo;didn\u2019t treat her like she deserved&rsquo;. Like <i>I</i> did. It left a sour\ntaste in my mouth when I realized she meant that he didn\u2019t put up\nwith her horse shit. Maybe the meathead was a wiser man than me.\u201d<br/></p><p>Alex\nsnorted.<br/></p><p>\u201cEven\nafter having a kid, she still only thought of herself. Her comfort.\nHer desires. Her vapid dreams. And she definitely asked about my\nMannism money. After being with Connie, I can\u2019t even process that\nkind of selfishness anymore. It made me ill to be around it. She was\nmy dream girl, but I\u2019m a different man now. Maybe that\u2019s where\nthe tears came from. I was finally free of her.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWoo!\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cIs that why you were so keen on ring shopping that\nweekend?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThat little visit, and the way that Connie listened and\nunderstood after, helped me make up my mind. I\u2019d be the dumbest\ntwat alive ifI didn\u2019t make her my wife - if she\u2019d have me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>If\nshe\u2019d have me</i>,\u201d\nshe mocked. \u201cAs if she wasn\u2019t absolute and utter trash for you\nafter the first day,\u201d she said, and rolled her eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cAll\nI remember about the beginning is her smart mouth,\u201d he said, but he\nsmiled.<br/></p><p>She\nsqueezed his shoulder. \u201cYou are not wise to the ways of women,\u201d\nshe said enigmatically. \u201cShe was testing you, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nthink I passed,\u201d he said giddily.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nthink you did, mate,\u201d she said. Olivia waved at them and pointed to\nthe priest, who had just arrived. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d<br/></p><hr><p>John\nwalked into the gazebo, where the priest in black vestments waited.\nLiv walked up, gave him a wide smile and winked.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;The\nbride&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; she said, and stood behind him. She was maid of honor.<br/></p><p>\u201cReady,\nson?\u201d the priest said, and squeezed his shoulder.<br/></p><p>\u201cMore\nthan anything,\u201d John said, bouncing in place and rubbing his hands\ntogether. He grabbed Alex\u2019s wrist. \u201cGot the rings?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes,\nsir,\u201d she said, patting her breast pocket. The priest nodded at the\nperson waiting to open the flap of the small pavilion where Connie\nwaited with her father. Liv squeezed his wrist, and he took her hand.\nOn the other side, Alex\u2019s hand went in his.<br/></p><p>The\nflap opened. The small crowd gasped in unison. Connie was a vision in\nwhite lace, and she held a bouquet of lilies. She smiled through the\ntranslucent, shimmering web of her veil. Her little cousins held down\nthe diaphenous fabric of her skirts as she walked to the gazebo.<br/></p><p>\u201cFuck\nme, she looks like a bride on the telly,\u201d Alex whispered, then\nlooked at the priest. His eyebrow rose. \u201cSorry, uh, your\nexcellency.\u201d She\nwasn&rsquo;t a religious woman.<br/></p><p>John\ndidn\u2019t hear a thing. Without realizing, he opened his arms to her.<br/></p><p>Connie\nsqueezed her father\u2019s hand. \u201cPapa,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cI\nwant to go to him, now.\u201d They were only halfway there. He stopped, lifted her veil, and kissed\nher cheek.<br/></p><p>\u201cGo,\nchiquita.\u201d<br/></p><p>She\ngave him a kiss, then shoved her bouquet in his hands. \u201cHold my\nflowers.\u201d She grabbed twin handfuls of skirt and half-walked,\nhalf-ran the rest of the way, to the amusement of the guests and the\nbefuddlement of her cousins, who ran after her holding her train. She\njumped the steps of the gazebo and into his arms with a giggle. He\ntook her face in his hands and kissed her cheek.<br/></p><p>\u201cNice\nshoes,\u201d he whispered.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nnoticed,\u201d she said. She pulled up her skirt to expose the\nholographic sneakers. \u201cThey\u2019re my something blue. And pink, and\npurple, and silver\u2026\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNice\nkicks!!\u201d Alex said, and held up her hand for a high five. Connie\nslapped it hard. Liv sniffled. Her father caught up, and stood\nbeside them.<br/></p><p>The\npriest cleared his throat. \u201cMay we begin?\u201d he said pointedly.<br/></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d\nJohn and Connie said together, then laughed. They moved in front of\nthe priest and held hands.<br/></p><p>The\npriest held his hand up for silence, but the whispers increased. Her\nfather reached out to her. \u201cChiquita-\u201d<br/></p><p>She\nwas so shocked she let go of John\u2019s hands. \u201cMami?\u201d<br/></p><p>Her\nmother walked across the field to the wedding party, alone. Her long,\nstraight brown hair blew in the wind, and her resplendent white made\nConnie\u2019s eyes water.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse she\u2019s wearing white,\u201d her father said. He groaned.<br/></p><p>\u201cMaman!\u201d\nConnie said again, and walked off the gazebo. The wedding party\nwatched as the bride ran to catch up with her mother\u2019s steadily\nmoving form. John looked around, irritated, and ran after her,\nwhispering his apologies to the priest.<br/></p><p>When\nshe caught up, she was panting. \u201cYou came!\u201d she said, and threw\nher arms around her mother. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t crossing the\ncountry for a Scot.\u201d<br/></p><p>Her\nmother patted her back awkwardly, and held her out at arm\u2019s length.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gained weight.\u201d<br/></p><p>Connie\nnodded. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m doing much better now. And John knows how to\ncook.\u201d As John walked up, he noticed that Connie\u2019s body language\nchanged. She was no longer a grown woman, but a girl trying to please\nher mother. Her green almond-shaped eyes drifted over Connie\u2019s\ndress, and her grass-stained shoes.<br/></p><p>\u201cCharmant,\nif a bit silly,\u201d\nshe said.<br/></p><p>Connie\nswallowed hard. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d She didn\u2019t know what else\nto say.<br/></p><p>\u201cPassable,\u201d\nshe said, in a French accent she refused to get rid of.<br/></p><p>\u201cVictoire,\u201d\nJohn said, holding out his hand. She looked at it, but did not shake\nit. \u201cThanks for coming to our wedding ceremony.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\nmy only child. Of course I came,\u201d she said, sweeping her\nwaist-length silky mane of hair over her shoulder.<br/></p><p>\u201cBut\nyou said you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very upset about it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nwas in one of my moods when she called,\u201d she said, and shrugged.\n\u201cShe knows.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDid\nshe? Because she cried for days,\u201d John said.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\nalways cries,\u201d Victoire said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve known her as a\nchild. It was her favorite thing to do. Cry and cry, and suck on the\ncorner of her favorite blankie in her crib.\u201d<br/></p><p>He\nlooked at them both, disbelieving. First at her mother for her\ncallousness, and then at Connie, for being so complacent about it.\nShe was smiling, of all things.<br/></p><p>\u201cVicky!\u201d\nConnie\u2019s father said as he walked up, holding his arms out. \u201cWhat\na pleasure!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFor\nyou, yes,\u201d she said, looking at his short, barrel-shaped form.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\na lovely white gown you\u2019re wearing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t you\nhate white, mi amor?\u201d her father said, smiling tensely.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nreserve the right to change my mind,\u201d she said, twirling and giving\nJohn a warm grin. \u201cAnd a beautiful woman doesn\u2019t need glitter and\nfanfare to look impressive.\u201d She waved her hand toward Connie. John\ngrunted. Connie squeezed his hand.\nHis breathing slowed to normal.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you come earlier? You missed the bonfire on the beach,\u201d\nConnie\nsaid.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t do <i>bon</i>\nfires,\u201d she said, pronouncing \u2018bon\u2019 in the most French way.\n\u201cWhat is that, even? What happened to indoor entertainment? It\u2019s\nmuch more civilised than drinking in the mud.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJohn-\n<i>we</i>\nlike it here. The coast is special to us,\u201d she said, but her voice\nwas devoid of its usual confidence. \u201cYou remember the story, don\u2019t\nyou?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Sexe\nsur la plage</i>\nand all that,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cOuiai. How romantic.\u201d<br/></p><p>Her\nfather\u2019s mouth opened, but nothing came out.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a bit - it was, um, a lot more than -\u201d she cleared her throat.\n\u201cHe proposed to me here.\u201d She held out her left hand. Her mother\ntook it and looked closely at her engagement ring.<br/></p><p>\u201cils\nsont le\ncouleur de\nla\npisse,\u201d she said about the diamonds. <i>They\u2019r</i><i>e\nthe color of </i><i>piss.</i><br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\nmama. It\u2019s concentrated sunshine, like he is.\u201d He\nfidgeted beside her. She\nsqueezed his hand again.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhatever\nyou say,\u201d Victoire said. \u201cJust wait until he stops shining so bright.\u201d\nShe gave her ex-husband a pointed look.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nVicky. That&rsquo;s enough,\u201d he said, touching her elbow.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you talking about?\u201d she said, looking innocently at John. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s\nmore handsome in person, isn&rsquo;t he, cari\u00f1o?&rdquo;\nhe said to Connie&rsquo;s father. The grainy webcam didn\u2019t do him a bit of justice.<br/></p><p>John\nwas done with the drama. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased you\u2019re here, madame,\nbut I\u2019d like to marry your daughter now,\u201d he said, stepping\nforward. \u201cI see clearly now where Connie got her beauty.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIn\na certain light,\u201d Victoire said. She smiled as her ex-husband\ngently pulled her toward the wedding party.<br/></p><p>\u201cIn\nevery kind of light,\u201d John said, and gave the woman a crooked grin.\nHe kissed Connie\u2019s lips, and they jogged the rest of the way back\nto the gazebo. The wedding party whispered as Victoire walked to the\nfront and sat down, not even bothering to apologize for the\ninterruption.<br/></p><p>\u201cEverything\nokay?\u201d Alex whispered, giving the woman an openly hostile look.\nVictoire crossed her legs and ignored her.<br/></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d\nConnie said. \u201cDon\u2019t let her bother you. She\u2019s a bit mad, but I\nknew she would come,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy. We\u2019re all\nhere.\u201d She smiled\ndreamily at John, and his heart swelled with love. She deserved so much.\nAnd he meant to do everything in his power to give it to her, every\nday.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou ready now?\u201d the priest said, hiding his irritation.

And they\nweren\u2019t. But her body was telling her that things were going to\nchange regardless. Soon. It\u2019s why she had only lemon water at the\npre-wedding cocktail party. And at bonfire the night before. Alphonse\nand her were going to Mexico after the wedding, and she planned to\ntell him there. She didn\u2019t know how it would go. All she was sure\nof is that she was keeping the baby. Sh looked toward the small\nwedding party. Maude tugged playfully on Olivia\u2019s frizzing hair -\nthe breeze wreaked havoc on it. Liv slapped her hand away and went\ninto her purse for a mirror. Monty was with Liv\u2019s parents back in\nEngland. She missed him terribly, and now that she was up the duff,\nit made her feel a lot more sympathetic about Olivia\u2019s decision to\nconceive, no matter the cost. At least they knew each other for a\nyear before she got pregnant.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you thinking?\u201d John said, looking intently at her face. It\npleased him to see that dating Alphonse gave her a glow - her cheeks\nwere rounding out, giving her a softer, more feminine look.<br></p><p>She\nbrightened up. \u201cYou excited?\u201d She would tell John about the baby,\nbut later. This was his day.<br></p><p>He\nwaved his hands in the breeze to dry them. \u201cIs it weird that it\ndoesn\u2019t feel like the second time around?\u201d he said. He smiled and\nbit his lip.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Alex said. \u201cYour love wiped the\nslate clean.\u201d</p><p>He\nnodded. \u201cI like that. I\u2019m using it,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nrealized after being with Alphonse that are all different kinds of\nlove,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d\nhe said, curious.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nmean, beyond the obvious,\u201d she said, referring to Liv being a woman\nand Alphonse being a man. \u201cEven though you\u2019re you and set in your\nways, you can\u2019t love different people in the same way. It\u2019s\nimpossible. You loved Mara in the way she allowed herself to be\nloved.\u201d He groaned. She patted his back. \u201cSorry to mention her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\nit\u2019s okay. She was a part of my life for a very long time,\u201d he\nsaid.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nshe tried to shoehorn her way in again!\u201d she said. Not long after\nshe moved to Alphonse\u2019s, he called her late in the night, audibly\nshaken. She borrowed Alfie\u2019s Beamer and drove to Bristol in record\ntime. There, Mara sat in his living room, chattering away like\nnothing had changed. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you let \u2018er in.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas cold and rainy. She brought her baby,\u201d he said, referring to\nher daughter with the small time football player, Addie.<br></p><p>\u201cFor\nsympathy points, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was a cute little\nbutton, though. Ginger as her mam. Either way, I let her know what\nwas what in short order,\u201d she said. She had given her a piece of\nher mind just as soon as she saw John\u2019s face. \u201cDid you ever tell\nEncarnaci\u00f3n?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\ncalled her right after you left,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nwhat did she say?\u201d Alex said. She looked at the water bottle in\nJohn\u2019s hands, shrugged, and took it back for a sip.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\ndidn\u2019t say much, but she listened. For nearly two hours, I cried\nand babbled my stream-of-consciousness pain to her. I don\u2019t know\nwhy I did it. Maybe it was the little girl, or Mara\u2019s worn, faded face,\nor her genuine desperation. I thought my head would crack in two. I knew it might bother her, but I couldn\u2019t <i>not</i> tell her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nAlex said.<br></p><p>\u201cEh,\u201d\nhe said, nodding.<br></p><p>\u201cBetween\nus, bruv\n\u2026\ndid you feel something?\u201d<br></p><p>John\nsighed, but his face was peaceful. \u201cI felt compassion. For Addie,\nmostly, but also for her. It hurt to see her so fragile and scared. I\nloved her so, so much. Deeply. She was my dream girl, Al. Ever since\nI was a boy. I remembered that, even though she wasn\u2019t quite the\nsame anymore.\u201d<br></p><p>She\nlooked at him sympathetically, although she didn\u2019t feel any\nsympathy for Mara. She could only think of the condition she left him\nin after the divorce.<br></p><p>\u201cSomething\nshifted in me, though, as she spoke. I noticed she never mentioned\nAddie, although the little one was right beside her. She spoke of\nchildish privations, and complained about how the football player\n\u2018didn\u2019t treat her like she deserved\u2019. Like <i>I</i> did. It left a sour\ntaste in my mouth when I realized she meant that he didn\u2019t put up\nwith her horse shit. Maybe the meathead was a wiser man than me.\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\nsnorted.<br></p><p>\u201cEven\nafter having a kid, she still only thought of herself. Her comfort.\nHer desires. Her vapid dreams. And she definitely asked about my\nMannism money. After being with Connie, I can\u2019t even process that\nkind of selfishness anymore. It made me ill to be around it. She was\nmy dream girl, but I\u2019m a different man now. Maybe that\u2019s where\nthe tears came from. I was finally free of her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWoo!\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cIs that why you were so keen on ring shopping that\nweekend?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThat little visit, and the way that Connie listened and\nunderstood after, helped me make up my mind. I\u2019d be the dumbest\ntwat alive ifI didn\u2019t make her my wife - if she\u2019d have me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>If\nshe\u2019d have me</i>,\u201d\nshe mocked. \u201cAs if she wasn\u2019t absolute and utter trash for you\nafter the first day,\u201d she said, and rolled her eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cAll\nI remember about the beginning is her smart mouth,\u201d he said, but he\nsmiled.<br></p><p>She\nsqueezed his shoulder. \u201cYou are not wise to the ways of women,\u201d\nshe said enigmatically. \u201cShe was testing you, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nthink I passed,\u201d he said giddily.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nthink you did, mate,\u201d she said. Olivia waved at them and pointed to\nthe priest, who had just arrived. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d<br></p><hr><p>John\nwalked into the gazebo, where the priest in black vestments waited.\nLiv walked up, gave him a wide smile and winked.<br></p><p>\u201cThe\nbride\u2019s ready,\u201d she said, and stood behind him. She was maid of honor.<br></p><p>\u201cReady,\nson?\u201d the priest said, and squeezed his shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cMore\nthan anything,\u201d John said, bouncing in place and rubbing his hands\ntogether. He grabbed Alex\u2019s wrist. \u201cGot the rings?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\nsir,\u201d she said, patting her breast pocket. The priest nodded at the\nperson waiting to open the flap of the small pavilion where Connie\nwaited with her father. Liv squeezed his wrist, and he took her hand.\nOn the other side, Alex\u2019s hand went in his.<br></p><p>The\nflap opened. The small crowd gasped in unison. Connie was a vision in\nwhite lace, and she held a bouquet of lilies. She smiled through the\ntranslucent, shimmering web of her veil. Her little cousins held down\nthe diaphenous fabric of her skirts as she walked to the gazebo.<br></p><p>\u201cFuck\nme, she looks like a bride on the telly,\u201d Alex whispered, then\nlooked at the priest. His eyebrow rose. \u201cSorry, uh, your\nexcellency.\u201d She\nwasn\u2019t a religious woman.<br></p><p>John\ndidn\u2019t hear a thing. Without realizing, he opened his arms to her.<br></p><p>Connie\nsqueezed her father\u2019s hand. \u201cPapa,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cI\nwant to go to him, now.\u201d They were only halfway there. He stopped, lifted her veil, and kissed\nher cheek.<br></p><p>\u201cGo,\nchiquita.\u201d<br></p><p>She\ngave him a kiss, then shoved her bouquet in his hands. \u201cHold my\nflowers.\u201d She grabbed twin handfuls of skirt and half-walked,\nhalf-ran the rest of the way, to the amusement of the guests and the\nbefuddlement of her cousins, who ran after her holding her train. She\njumped the steps of the gazebo and into his arms with a giggle. He\ntook her face in his hands and kissed her cheek.<br></p><p>\u201cNice\nshoes,\u201d he whispered.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nnoticed,\u201d she said. She pulled up her skirt to expose the\nholographic sneakers. \u201cThey\u2019re my something blue. And pink, and\npurple, and silver\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNice\nkicks!!\u201d Alex said, and held up her hand for a high five. Connie\nslapped it hard. Liv sniffled. Her father caught up, and stood\nbeside them.<br></p><p>The\npriest cleared his throat. \u201cMay we begin?\u201d he said pointedly.<br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d\nJohn and Connie said together, then laughed. They moved in front of\nthe priest and held hands.<br></p><p>The\npriest held his hand up for silence, but the whispers increased. Her\nfather reached out to her. \u201cChiquita-\u201d<br></p><p>She\nwas so shocked she let go of John\u2019s hands. \u201cMami?\u201d<br></p><p>Her\nmother walked across the field to the wedding party, alone. Her long,\nstraight brown hair blew in the wind, and her resplendent white made\nConnie\u2019s eyes water.<br></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse she\u2019s wearing white,\u201d her father said. He groaned.<br></p><p>\u201cMaman!\u201d\nConnie said again, and walked off the gazebo. The wedding party\nwatched as the bride ran to catch up with her mother\u2019s steadily\nmoving form. John looked around, irritated, and ran after her,\nwhispering his apologies to the priest.<br></p><p>When\nshe caught up, she was panting. \u201cYou came!\u201d she said, and threw\nher arms around her mother. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t crossing the\ncountry for a Scot.\u201d<br></p><p>Her\nmother patted her back awkwardly, and held her out at arm\u2019s length.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gained weight.\u201d<br></p><p>Connie\nnodded. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m doing much better now. And John knows how to\ncook.\u201d As John walked up, he noticed that Connie\u2019s body language\nchanged. She was no longer a grown woman, but a girl trying to please\nher mother. Her green almond-shaped eyes drifted over Connie\u2019s\ndress, and her grass-stained shoes.<br></p><p>\u201cCharmant,\nif a bit silly,\u201d\nshe said.<br></p><p>Connie\nswallowed hard. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d She didn\u2019t know what else\nto say.<br></p><p>\u201cPassable,\u201d\nshe said, in a French accent she refused to get rid of.<br></p><p>\u201cVictoire,\u201d\nJohn said, holding out his hand. She looked at it, but did not shake\nit. \u201cThanks for coming to our wedding ceremony.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\nmy only child. Of course I came,\u201d she said, sweeping her\nwaist-length silky mane of hair over her shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cBut\nyou said you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very upset about it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nwas in one of my moods when she called,\u201d she said, and shrugged.\n\u201cShe knows.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid\nshe? Because she cried for days,\u201d John said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\nalways cries,\u201d Victoire said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve known her as a\nchild. It was her favorite thing to do. Cry and cry, and suck on the\ncorner of her favorite blankie in her crib.\u201d<br></p><p>He\nlooked at them both, disbelieving. First at her mother for her\ncallousness, and then at Connie, for being so complacent about it.\nShe was smiling, of all things.<br></p><p>\u201cVicky!\u201d\nConnie\u2019s father said as he walked up, holding his arms out. \u201cWhat\na pleasure!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFor\nyou, yes,\u201d she said, looking at his short, barrel-shaped form.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\na lovely white gown you\u2019re wearing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t you\nhate white, mi amor?\u201d her father said, smiling tensely.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nreserve the right to change my mind,\u201d she said, twirling and giving\nJohn a warm grin. \u201cAnd a beautiful woman doesn\u2019t need glitter and\nfanfare to look impressive.\u201d She waved her hand toward Connie. John\ngrunted. Connie squeezed his hand.\nHis breathing slowed to normal.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you come earlier? You missed the bonfire on the beach,\u201d\nConnie\nsaid.<br></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t do <i>bon</i>\nfires,\u201d she said, pronouncing \u2018bon\u2019 in the most French way.\n\u201cWhat is that, even? What happened to indoor entertainment? It\u2019s\nmuch more civilised than drinking in the mud.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJohn-\n<i>we</i>\nlike it here. The coast is special to us,\u201d she said, but her voice\nwas devoid of its usual confidence. \u201cYou remember the story, don\u2019t\nyou?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Sexe\nsur la plage</i>\nand all that,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cOuiai. How romantic.\u201d<br></p><p>Her\nfather\u2019s mouth opened, but nothing came out.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a bit - it was, um, a lot more than -\u201d she cleared her throat.\n\u201cHe proposed to me here.\u201d She held out her left hand. Her mother\ntook it and looked closely at her engagement ring.<br></p><p>\u201cils\nsont le\ncouleur de\nla\npisse,\u201d she said about the diamonds. <i>They\u2019r</i><i>e\nthe color of </i><i>piss.</i><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\nmama. It\u2019s concentrated sunshine, like he is.\u201d He\nfidgeted beside her. She\nsqueezed his hand again.<br></p><p>\u201cWhatever\nyou say,\u201d Victoire said. \u201cJust wait until he stops shining so bright.\u201d\nShe gave her ex-husband a pointed look.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nVicky. That\u2019s enough,\u201d he said, touching her elbow.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you talking about?\u201d she said, looking innocently at John. \u201cHe\u2019s\nmore handsome in person, isn\u2019t he, cari\u00f1o?\u201d\nhe said to Connie\u2019s father. The grainy webcam didn\u2019t do him a bit of justice.<br></p><p>John\nwas done with the drama. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased you\u2019re here, madame,\nbut I\u2019d like to marry your daughter now,\u201d he said, stepping\nforward. \u201cI see clearly now where Connie got her beauty.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIn\na certain light,\u201d Victoire said. She smiled as her ex-husband\ngently pulled her toward the wedding party.<br></p><p>\u201cIn\nevery kind of light,\u201d John said, and gave the woman a crooked grin.\nHe kissed Connie\u2019s lips, and they jogged the rest of the way back\nto the gazebo. The wedding party whispered as Victoire walked to the\nfront and sat down, not even bothering to apologize for the\ninterruption.<br></p><p>\u201cEverything\nokay?\u201d Alex whispered, giving the woman an openly hostile look.\nVictoire crossed her legs and ignored her.<br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d\nConnie said. \u201cDon\u2019t let her bother you. She\u2019s a bit mad, but I\nknew she would come,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy. We\u2019re all\nhere.\u201d She smiled\ndreamily at John, and his heart swelled with love. She deserved so much.\nAnd he meant to do everything in his power to give it to her, every\nday.<br></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou ready now?\u201d the priest said, hiding his irritation. He had\nanother wedding at 7 pm down the coast.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nlove you, sweetheart,\u201d John said. \u201cAnd you look so\nbeautiful it hurts.\u201d<br></p><p>She\nrolled her eyes in Victoire\u2019s direction. \u201cShe feels bigger when\nshe gets the last word in. I let her, to make her feel important.\u201d\nHe made a face, and she caressed him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\nYour lovely gaze makes all the rough edges of the world smooth.\u201d<br></p><p>He\nkissed her hand tenderly. \u201cSweet talker.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\njust wait,\u201d she whispered. The priest cleared his throat again.\nThey both turned to look at him and smiled.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s\nmake this official, padre,\u201d\nJohn said. \u201cAnd\nmake it quick. I don\u2019t want to wait a second longer.\u201d<br></p><p><a href=\"http://uglywettiewrites.tumblr.com/post/175901659387/that-woman-over-there-epilogue\">Epilogue</a></p><hr><p>PS - Told you all the original story had good bones\u00a0\ud83d\ude09</p>",

She squinted toward where he was looking, curious.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nlook like a Byronian hero,\u201d she said, proud of herself at the reference, then laughed out loud when she\nheard\nwhat he was actually doing. \u201cYou\u2019re disgustin\u2019, mate!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nhad too much champagne earlier,\u201d he said, and winked. She turned\naround and waited for him to finish peeing.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\nme borrow that bottle of water,\u201d he said as he zipped up. She had\none in her pocket.<br></p><p>\u201cKeep\nit,\u201d she said, and handed it to him. He poured the water over his\nhands. \u201cEver the gentleman. They\u2019re just waiting on the priest.\nEncarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s ready.\u201d<br></p><p>He\nsmiled. \u201cEncarnaci\u00f3n. Alphonse really rubbed off on you,\u201d he\nsaid.<br></p><p>\u201cIn\nmore ways than one,\u201d she said, and wiggled her eyebrow. He laughed.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNothing.\nI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re happy with the Frenchman,\u201d he said. Now\nthat she was working toward her dream, she was fiery with\nself-confidence. He felt fortunate that they were able to fix things\nso easily. After he came back from his ma\u2019s, she was\nalready\nback at\nhouse. Although he wasn\u2019t ready to speak immediately, she waited\nuntil he was, which was\nhard for a woman like her. He was grateful for her patience, and to\nhave his friend again.<br></p><p>\u201cSeriously,\nthough. You ready?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nasking me that? You moved in with Alphonse after three months,\u201d he\nsaid.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas mostly for convenience, and because Liv\u2019s selling the house.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nJohn said, making a funny face.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWe\nain\u2019t getting married, though,\u201d she said, shrugging. And they\nweren\u2019t. But her body was telling her that things were going to\nchange regardless. Soon. It\u2019s why she had only lemon water at the\npre-wedding cocktail party. And at bonfire the night before. Alphonse\nand her were going to Mexico after the wedding, and she planned to\ntell him there. She didn\u2019t know how it would go. All she was sure\nof is that she was keeping the baby. Sh looked toward the small\nwedding party. Maude tugged playfully on Olivia\u2019s frizzing hair -\nthe breeze wreaked havoc on it. Liv slapped her hand away and went\ninto her purse for a mirror. Monty was with Liv\u2019s parents back in\nEngland. She missed him terribly, and now that she was up the duff,\nit made her feel a lot more sympathetic about Olivia\u2019s decision to\nconceive, no matter the cost. At least they knew each other for a\nyear before she got pregnant.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you thinking?\u201d John said, looking intently at her face. It\npleased him to see that dating Alphonse gave her a glow - her cheeks\nwere rounding out, giving her a softer, more feminine look.<br></p><p>She\nbrightened up. \u201cYou excited?\u201d She would tell John about the baby,\nbut later. This was his day.<br></p><p>He\nwaved his hands in the breeze to dry them. \u201cIs it weird that it\ndoesn\u2019t feel like the second time around?\u201d he said. He smiled and\nbit his lip.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Alex said. \u201cYour love wiped the\nslate clean.\u201d</p><p>He\nnodded. \u201cI like that. I\u2019m using it,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nrealized after being with Alphonse that are all different kinds of\nlove,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d\nhe said, curious.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nmean, beyond the obvious,\u201d she said, referring to Liv being a woman\nand Alphonse being a man. \u201cEven though you\u2019re you and set in your\nways, you can\u2019t love different people in the same way. It\u2019s\nimpossible. You loved Mara in the way she allowed herself to be\nloved.\u201d He groaned. She patted his back. \u201cSorry to mention her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\nit\u2019s okay. She was a part of my life for a very long time,\u201d he\nsaid.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nshe tried to shoehorn her way in again!\u201d she said. Not long after\nshe moved to Alphonse\u2019s, he called her late in the night, audibly\nshaken. She borrowed Alfie\u2019s Beamer and drove to Bristol in record\ntime. There, Mara sat in his living room, chattering away like\nnothing had changed. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you let \u2018er in.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas cold and rainy. She brought her baby,\u201d he said, referring to\nher daughter with the small time football player, Addie.<br></p><p>\u201cFor\nsympathy points, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was a cute little\nbutton, though. Ginger as her mam. Either way, I let her know what\nwas what in short order,\u201d she said. She had given her a piece of\nher mind just as soon as she saw John\u2019s face. \u201cDid you ever tell\nEncarnaci\u00f3n?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\ncalled her right after you left,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nwhat did she say?\u201d Alex said. She looked at the water bottle in\nJohn\u2019s hands, shrugged, and took it back for a sip.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\ndidn\u2019t say much, but she listened. For nearly two hours, I cried\nand babbled my stream-of-consciousness pain to her. I don\u2019t know\nwhy I did it. Maybe it was the little girl, or Mara\u2019s worn, faded face,\nor her genuine desperation. I thought my head would crack in two. I knew it might bother her, but I couldn\u2019t <i>not</i> tell her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nAlex said.<br></p><p>\u201cEh,\u201d\nhe said, nodding.<br></p><p>\u201cBetween\nus, bruv\n\u2026\ndid you feel something?\u201d<br></p><p>John\nsighed, but his face was peaceful. \u201cI felt compassion. For Addie,\nmostly, but also for her. It hurt to see her so fragile and scared. I\nloved her so, so much. Deeply. She was my dream girl, Al. Ever since\nI was a boy. I remembered that, even though she wasn\u2019t quite the\nsame anymore.\u201d<br></p><p>She\nlooked at him sympathetically, although she didn\u2019t feel any\nsympathy for Mara. She could only think of the condition she left him\nin after the divorce.<br></p><p>\u201cSomething\nshifted in me, though, as she spoke. I noticed she never mentioned\nAddie, although the little one was right beside her. She spoke of\nchildish privations, and complained about how the football player\n\u2018didn\u2019t treat her like she deserved\u2019. Like <i>I</i> did. It left a sour\ntaste in my mouth when I realized she meant that he didn\u2019t put up\nwith her horse shit. Maybe the meathead was a wiser man than me.\u201d<br></p><p>Alex\nsnorted.<br></p><p>\u201cEven\nafter having a kid, she still only thought of herself. Her comfort.\nHer desires. Her vapid dreams. And she definitely asked about my\nMannism money. After being with Connie, I can\u2019t even process that\nkind of selfishness anymore. It made me ill to be around it. She was\nmy dream girl, but I\u2019m a different man now. Maybe that\u2019s where\nthe tears came from. I was finally free of her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWoo!\u201d\nAlex said. \u201cIs that why you were so keen on ring shopping that\nweekend?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThat little visit, and the way that Connie listened and\nunderstood after, helped me make up my mind. I\u2019d be the dumbest\ntwat alive ifI didn\u2019t make her my wife - if she\u2019d have me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>If\nshe\u2019d have me</i>,\u201d\nshe mocked. \u201cAs if she wasn\u2019t absolute and utter trash for you\nafter the first day,\u201d she said, and rolled her eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cAll\nI remember about the beginning is her smart mouth,\u201d he said, but he\nsmiled.<br></p><p>She\nsqueezed his shoulder. \u201cYou are not wise to the ways of women,\u201d\nshe said enigmatically. \u201cShe was testing you, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nthink I passed,\u201d he said giddily.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nthink you did, mate,\u201d she said. Olivia waved at them and pointed to\nthe priest, who had just arrived. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d<br></p><hr><p>John\nwalked into the gazebo, where the priest in black vestments waited.\nLiv walked up, gave him a wide smile and winked.<br></p><p>\u201cThe\nbride\u2019s ready,\u201d she said, and stood behind him. She was maid of honor.<br></p><p>\u201cReady,\nson?\u201d the priest said, and squeezed his shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cMore\nthan anything,\u201d John said, bouncing in place and rubbing his hands\ntogether. He grabbed Alex\u2019s wrist. \u201cGot the rings?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\nsir,\u201d she said, patting her breast pocket. The priest nodded at the\nperson waiting to open the flap of the small pavilion where Connie\nwaited with her father. Liv squeezed his wrist, and he took her hand.\nOn the other side, Alex\u2019s hand went in his.<br></p><p>The\nflap opened. The small crowd gasped in unison. Connie was a vision in\nwhite lace, and she held a bouquet of lilies. She smiled through the\ntranslucent, shimmering web of her veil. Her little cousins held down\nthe diaphenous fabric of her skirts as she walked to the gazebo.<br></p><p>\u201cFuck\nme, she looks like a bride on the telly,\u201d Alex whispered, then\nlooked at the priest. His eyebrow rose. \u201cSorry, uh, your\nexcellency.\u201d She\nwasn\u2019t a religious woman.<br></p><p>John\ndidn\u2019t hear a thing. Without realizing, he opened his arms to her.<br></p><p>Connie\nsqueezed her father\u2019s hand. \u201cPapa,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cI\nwant to go to him, now.\u201d They were only halfway there. He stopped, lifted her veil, and kissed\nher cheek.<br></p><p>\u201cGo,\nchiquita.\u201d<br></p><p>She\ngave him a kiss, then shoved her bouquet in his hands. \u201cHold my\nflowers.\u201d She grabbed twin handfuls of skirt and half-walked,\nhalf-ran the rest of the way, to the amusement of the guests and the\nbefuddlement of her cousins, who ran after her holding her train. She\njumped the steps of the gazebo and into his arms with a giggle. He\ntook her face in his hands and kissed her cheek.<br></p><p>\u201cNice\nshoes,\u201d he whispered.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\nnoticed,\u201d she said. She pulled up her skirt to expose the\nholographic sneakers. \u201cThey\u2019re my something blue. And pink, and\npurple, and silver\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNice\nkicks!!\u201d Alex said, and held up her hand for a high five. Connie\nslapped it hard. Liv sniffled. Her father caught up, and stood\nbeside them.<br></p><p>The\npriest cleared his throat. \u201cMay we begin?\u201d he said pointedly.<br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d\nJohn and Connie said together, then laughed. They moved in front of\nthe priest and held hands.<br></p><p>The\npriest held his hand up for silence, but the whispers increased. Her\nfather reached out to her. \u201cChiquita-\u201d<br></p><p>She\nwas so shocked she let go of John\u2019s hands. \u201cMami?\u201d<br></p><p>Her\nmother walked across the field to the wedding party, alone. Her long,\nstraight brown hair blew in the wind, and her resplendent white made\nConnie\u2019s eyes water.<br></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse she\u2019s wearing white,\u201d her father said. He groaned.<br></p><p>\u201cMaman!\u201d\nConnie said again, and walked off the gazebo. The wedding party\nwatched as the bride ran to catch up with her mother\u2019s steadily\nmoving form. John looked around, irritated, and ran after her,\nwhispering his apologies to the priest.<br></p><p>When\nshe caught up, she was panting. \u201cYou came!\u201d she said, and threw\nher arms around her mother. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t crossing the\ncountry for a Scot.\u201d<br></p><p>Her\nmother patted her back awkwardly, and held her out at arm\u2019s length.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gained weight.\u201d<br></p><p>Connie\nnodded. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m doing much better now. And John knows how to\ncook.\u201d As John walked up, he noticed that Connie\u2019s body language\nchanged. She was no longer a grown woman, but a girl trying to please\nher mother. Her green almond-shaped eyes drifted over Connie\u2019s\ndress, and her grass-stained shoes.<br></p><p>\u201cCharmant,\nif a bit silly,\u201d\nshe said.<br></p><p>Connie\nswallowed hard. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d She didn\u2019t know what else\nto say.<br></p><p>\u201cPassable,\u201d\nshe said, in a French accent she refused to get rid of.<br></p><p>\u201cVictoire,\u201d\nJohn said, holding out his hand. She looked at it, but did not shake\nit. \u201cThanks for coming to our wedding ceremony.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\nmy only child. Of course I came,\u201d she said, sweeping her\nwaist-length silky mane of hair over her shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cBut\nyou said you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very upset about it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nwas in one of my moods when she called,\u201d she said, and shrugged.\n\u201cShe knows.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid\nshe? Because she cried for days,\u201d John said.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\nalways cries,\u201d Victoire said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve known her as a\nchild. It was her favorite thing to do. Cry and cry, and suck on the\ncorner of her favorite blankie in her crib.\u201d<br></p><p>He\nlooked at them both, disbelieving. First at her mother for her\ncallousness, and then at Connie, for being so complacent about it.\nShe was smiling, of all things.<br></p><p>\u201cVicky!\u201d\nConnie\u2019s father said as he walked up, holding his arms out. \u201cWhat\na pleasure!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFor\nyou, yes,\u201d she said, looking at his short, barrel-shaped form.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\na lovely white gown you\u2019re wearing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t you\nhate white, mi amor?\u201d her father said, smiling tensely.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nreserve the right to change my mind,\u201d she said, twirling and giving\nJohn a warm grin. \u201cAnd a beautiful woman doesn\u2019t need glitter and\nfanfare to look impressive.\u201d She waved her hand toward Connie. John\ngrunted. Connie squeezed his hand.\nHis breathing slowed to normal.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you come earlier? You missed the bonfire on the beach,\u201d\nConnie\nsaid.<br></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t do <i>bon</i>\nfires,\u201d she said, pronouncing \u2018bon\u2019 in the most French way.\n\u201cWhat is that, even? What happened to indoor entertainment? It\u2019s\nmuch more civilised than drinking in the mud.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJohn-\n<i>we</i>\nlike it here. The coast is special to us,\u201d she said, but her voice\nwas devoid of its usual confidence. \u201cYou remember the story, don\u2019t\nyou?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Sexe\nsur la plage</i>\nand all that,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cOuiai. How romantic.\u201d<br></p><p>Her\nfather\u2019s mouth opened, but nothing came out.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a bit - it was, um, a lot more than -\u201d she cleared her throat.\n\u201cHe proposed to me here.\u201d She held out her left hand. Her mother\ntook it and looked closely at her engagement ring.<br></p><p>\u201cils\nsont le\ncouleur de\nla\npisse,\u201d she said about the diamonds. <i>They\u2019r</i><i>e\nthe color of </i><i>piss.</i><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\nmama. It\u2019s concentrated sunshine, like he is.\u201d He\nfidgeted beside her. She\nsqueezed his hand again.<br></p><p>\u201cWhatever\nyou say,\u201d Victoire said. \u201cJust wait until he stops shining so bright.\u201d\nShe gave her ex-husband a pointed look.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nVicky. That\u2019s enough,\u201d he said, touching her elbow.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you talking about?\u201d she said, looking innocently at John. \u201cHe\u2019s\nmore handsome in person, isn\u2019t he, cari\u00f1o?\u201d\nhe said to Connie\u2019s father. The grainy webcam didn\u2019t do him a bit of justice.<br></p><p>John\nwas done with the drama. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased you\u2019re here, madame,\nbut I\u2019d like to marry your daughter now,\u201d he said, stepping\nforward. \u201cI see clearly now where Connie got her beauty.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIn\na certain light,\u201d Victoire said. She smiled as her ex-husband\ngently pulled her toward the wedding party.<br></p><p>\u201cIn\nevery kind of light,\u201d John said, and gave the woman a crooked grin.\nHe kissed Connie\u2019s lips, and they jogged the rest of the way back\nto the gazebo. The wedding party whispered as Victoire walked to the\nfront and sat down, not even bothering to apologize for the\ninterruption.<br></p><p>\u201cEverything\nokay?\u201d Alex whispered, giving the woman an openly hostile look.\nVictoire crossed her legs and ignored her.<br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d\nConnie said. \u201cDon\u2019t let her bother you. She\u2019s a bit mad, but I\nknew she would come,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy. We\u2019re all\nhere.\u201d She smiled\ndreamily at John, and his heart swelled with love. She deserved so much.\nAnd he meant to do everything in his power to give it to her, every\nday.<br></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou ready now?\u201d the priest said, hiding his irritation. He had\nanother wedding at 7 pm down the coast.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nlove you, sweetheart,\u201d John said. \u201cAnd you look so\nbeautiful it hurts.\u201d<br></p><p>She\nrolled her eyes in Victoire\u2019s direction. \u201cShe feels bigger when\nshe gets the last word in. I let her, to make her feel important.\u201d\nHe made a face, and she caressed him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\nYour lovely gaze makes all the rough edges of the world smooth.\u201d<br></p><p>He\nkissed her hand tenderly. \u201cSweet talker.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\njust wait,\u201d she whispered. The priest cleared his throat again.\nThey both turned to look at him and smiled.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s\nmake this official, padre,\u201d\nJohn said. \u201cAnd\nmake it quick. I don\u2019t want to wait a second longer.\u201d<br></p><p><a href=\"http://uglywettiewrites.tumblr.com/post/175901659387/that-woman-over-there-epilogue\">Epilogue</a></p><hr><p>PS - Told you all the original story had good bones\u00a0\ud83d\ude09</p>",

She squinted toward where he was looking, curious.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nlook like a Byronian hero,&rdquo; she said, proud of herself at the reference, then laughed out loud when she\nheard\nwhat he was actually doing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re disgustin&rsquo;, mate!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nhad too much champagne earlier,&rdquo; he said, and winked. She turned\naround and waited for him to finish peeing.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let\nme borrow that bottle of water,&rdquo; he said as he zipped up. She had\none in her pocket.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Keep\nit,&rdquo; she said, and handed it to him. He poured the water over his\nhands. &ldquo;Ever the gentleman. They&rsquo;re just waiting on the priest.\nEncarnaci&oacute;n&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He\nsmiled. &ldquo;Encarnaci&oacute;n. Alphonse really rubbed off on you,&rdquo; he\nsaid.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;In\nmore ways than one,&rdquo; she said, and wiggled her eyebrow. He laughed.\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.\nI&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re happy with the Frenchman,&rdquo; he said. Now\nthat she was working toward her dream, she was fiery with\nself-confidence. He felt fortunate that they were able to fix things\nso easily. After he came back from his ma&rsquo;s, she was\nalready\nback at\nhouse. Although he wasn&rsquo;t ready to speak immediately, she waited\nuntil he was, which was\nhard for a woman like her. He was grateful for her patience, and to\nhave his friend again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Seriously,\nthough. You ready?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nasking me that? You moved in with Alphonse after three months,&rdquo; he\nsaid.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas mostly for convenience, and because Liv&rsquo;s selling the house.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nJohn said, making a funny face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We\nain&rsquo;t getting married, though,&rdquo; she said, shrugging. And they\nweren&rsquo;t. But her body was telling her that things were going to\nchange regardless. Soon. It&rsquo;s why she had only lemon water at the\npre-wedding cocktail party. And at bonfire the night before. Alphonse\nand her were going to Mexico after the wedding, and she planned to\ntell him there. She didn&rsquo;t know how it would go. All she was sure\nof is that she was keeping the baby. Sh looked toward the small\nwedding party. Maude tugged playfully on Olivia&rsquo;s frizzing hair -\nthe breeze wreaked havoc on it. Liv slapped her hand away and went\ninto her purse for a mirror. Monty was with Liv&rsquo;s parents back in\nEngland. She missed him terribly, and now that she was up the duff,\nit made her feel a lot more sympathetic about Olivia&rsquo;s decision to\nconceive, no matter the cost. At least they knew each other for a\nyear before she got pregnant.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\nare you thinking?&rdquo; John said, looking intently at her face. It\npleased him to see that dating Alphonse gave her a glow - her cheeks\nwere rounding out, giving her a softer, more feminine look.<br /></p><p>She\nbrightened up. &ldquo;You excited?&rdquo; She would tell John about the baby,\nbut later. This was his day.<br /></p><p>He\nwaved his hands in the breeze to dry them. &ldquo;Is it weird that it\ndoesn&rsquo;t feel like the second time around?&rdquo; he said. He smiled and\nbit his lip.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good thing,&rdquo; Alex said. &ldquo;Your love wiped the\nslate clean.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nnodded. &ldquo;I like that. I&rsquo;m using it,&rdquo; he said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nrealized after being with Alphonse that are all different kinds of\nlove,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;\nhe said, curious.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nmean, beyond the obvious,&rdquo; she said, referring to Liv being a woman\nand Alphonse being a man. &ldquo;Even though you&rsquo;re you and set in your\nways, you can&rsquo;t love different people in the same way. It&rsquo;s\nimpossible. You loved Mara in the way she allowed herself to be\nloved.&rdquo; He groaned. She patted his back. &ldquo;Sorry to mention her.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,\nit&rsquo;s okay. She was a part of my life for a very long time,&rdquo; he\nsaid.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And\nshe tried to shoehorn her way in again!&rdquo; she said. Not long after\nshe moved to Alphonse&rsquo;s, he called her late in the night, audibly\nshaken. She borrowed Alfie&rsquo;s Beamer and drove to Bristol in record\ntime. There, Mara sat in his living room, chattering away like\nnothing had changed. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe you let &lsquo;er in.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas cold and rainy. She brought her baby,&rdquo; he said, referring to\nher daughter with the small time football player, Addie.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;For\nsympathy points, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She was a cute little\nbutton, though. Ginger as her mam. Either way, I let her know what\nwas what in short order,&rdquo; she said. She had given her a piece of\nher mind just as soon as she saw John&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Did you ever tell\nEncarnaci&oacute;n?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\ncalled her right after you left,&rdquo; he said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And\nwhat did she say?&rdquo; Alex said. She looked at the water bottle in\nJohn&rsquo;s hands, shrugged, and took it back for a sip.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She\ndidn&rsquo;t say much, but she listened. For nearly two hours, I cried\nand babbled my stream-of-consciousness pain to her. I don&rsquo;t know\nwhy I did it. Maybe it was the little girl, or Mara&rsquo;s worn, faded face,\nor her genuine desperation. I thought my head would crack in two. I knew it might bother her, but I couldn&rsquo;t <i>not</i> tell her.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo;\nAlex said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Eh,&rdquo;\nhe said, nodding.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Between\nus, bruv\n&hellip;\ndid you feel something?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>John\nsighed, but his face was peaceful. &ldquo;I felt compassion. For Addie,\nmostly, but also for her. It hurt to see her so fragile and scared. I\nloved her so, so much. Deeply. She was my dream girl, Al. Ever since\nI was a boy. I remembered that, even though she wasn&rsquo;t quite the\nsame anymore.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She\nlooked at him sympathetically, although she didn&rsquo;t feel any\nsympathy for Mara. She could only think of the condition she left him\nin after the divorce.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Something\nshifted in me, though, as she spoke. I noticed she never mentioned\nAddie, although the little one was right beside her. She spoke of\nchildish privations, and complained about how the football player\n&lsquo;didn&rsquo;t treat her like she deserved&rsquo;. Like <i>I</i> did. It left a sour\ntaste in my mouth when I realized she meant that he didn&rsquo;t put up\nwith her horse shit. Maybe the meathead was a wiser man than me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Alex\nsnorted.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Even\nafter having a kid, she still only thought of herself. Her comfort.\nHer desires. Her vapid dreams. And she definitely asked about my\nMannism money. After being with Connie, I can&rsquo;t even process that\nkind of selfishness anymore. It made me ill to be around it. She was\nmy dream girl, but I&rsquo;m a different man now. Maybe that&rsquo;s where\nthe tears came from. I was finally free of her.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Woo!&rdquo;\nAlex said. &ldquo;Is that why you were so keen on ring shopping that\nweekend?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo;\nhe said. &ldquo;That little visit, and the way that Connie listened and\nunderstood after, helped me make up my mind. I&rsquo;d be the dumbest\ntwat alive ifI didn&rsquo;t make her my wife - if she&rsquo;d have me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>If\nshe&rsquo;d have me</i>,&rdquo;\nshe mocked. &ldquo;As if she wasn&rsquo;t absolute and utter trash for you\nafter the first day,&rdquo; she said, and rolled her eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;All\nI remember about the beginning is her smart mouth,&rdquo; he said, but he\nsmiled.<br /></p><p>She\nsqueezed his shoulder. &ldquo;You are not wise to the ways of women,&rdquo;\nshe said enigmatically. &ldquo;She was testing you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nthink I passed,&rdquo; he said giddily.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nthink you did, mate,&rdquo; she said. Olivia waved at them and pointed to\nthe priest, who had just arrived. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;<br /></p><hr /><p>John\nwalked into the gazebo, where the priest in black vestments waited.\nLiv walked up, gave him a wide smile and winked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The\nbride&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; she said, and stood behind him. She was maid of honor.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ready,\nson?&rdquo; the priest said, and squeezed his shoulder.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;More\nthan anything,&rdquo; John said, bouncing in place and rubbing his hands\ntogether. He grabbed Alex&rsquo;s wrist. &ldquo;Got the rings?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nsir,&rdquo; she said, patting her breast pocket. The priest nodded at the\nperson waiting to open the flap of the small pavilion where Connie\nwaited with her father. Liv squeezed his wrist, and he took her hand.\nOn the other side, Alex&rsquo;s hand went in his.<br /></p><p>The\nflap opened. The small crowd gasped in unison. Connie was a vision in\nwhite lace, and she held a bouquet of lilies. She smiled through the\ntranslucent, shimmering web of her veil. Her little cousins held down\nthe diaphenous fabric of her skirts as she walked to the gazebo.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck\nme, she looks like a bride on the telly,&rdquo; Alex whispered, then\nlooked at the priest. His eyebrow rose. &ldquo;Sorry, uh, your\nexcellency.&rdquo; She\nwasn&rsquo;t a religious woman.<br /></p><p>John\ndidn&rsquo;t hear a thing. Without realizing, he opened his arms to her.<br /></p><p>Connie\nsqueezed her father&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she said in Spanish. &ldquo;I\nwant to go to him, now.&rdquo; They were only halfway there. He stopped, lifted her veil, and kissed\nher cheek.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Go,\nchiquita.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She\ngave him a kiss, then shoved her bouquet in his hands. &ldquo;Hold my\nflowers.&rdquo; She grabbed twin handfuls of skirt and half-walked,\nhalf-ran the rest of the way, to the amusement of the guests and the\nbefuddlement of her cousins, who ran after her holding her train. She\njumped the steps of the gazebo and into his arms with a giggle. He\ntook her face in his hands and kissed her cheek.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nice\nshoes,&rdquo; he whispered.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nnoticed,&rdquo; she said. She pulled up her skirt to expose the\nholographic sneakers. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re my something blue. And pink, and\npurple, and silver&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nice\nkicks!!&rdquo; Alex said, and held up her hand for a high five. Connie\nslapped it hard. Liv sniffled. Her father caught up, and stood\nbeside them.<br /></p><p>The\npriest cleared his throat. &ldquo;May we begin?&rdquo; he said pointedly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;\nJohn and Connie said together, then laughed. They moved in front of\nthe priest and held hands.<br /></p><p>The\npriest held his hand up for silence, but the whispers increased. Her\nfather reached out to her. &ldquo;Chiquita-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She\nwas so shocked she let go of John&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Mami?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Her\nmother walked across the field to the wedding party, alone. Her long,\nstraight brown hair blew in the wind, and her resplendent white made\nConnie&rsquo;s eyes water.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse she&rsquo;s wearing white,&rdquo; her father said. He groaned.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maman!&rdquo;\nConnie said again, and walked off the gazebo. The wedding party\nwatched as the bride ran to catch up with her mother&rsquo;s steadily\nmoving form. John looked around, irritated, and ran after her,\nwhispering his apologies to the priest.<br /></p><p>When\nshe caught up, she was panting. &ldquo;You came!&rdquo; she said, and threw\nher arms around her mother. &ldquo;I thought you said you weren&rsquo;t crossing the\ncountry for a Scot.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Her\nmother patted her back awkwardly, and held her out at arm&rsquo;s length.\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gained weight.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Connie\nnodded. &ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m doing much better now. And John knows how to\ncook.&rdquo; As John walked up, he noticed that Connie&rsquo;s body language\nchanged. She was no longer a grown woman, but a girl trying to please\nher mother. Her green almond-shaped eyes drifted over Connie&rsquo;s\ndress, and her grass-stained shoes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Charmant,\nif a bit silly,&rdquo;\nshe said.<br /></p><p>Connie\nswallowed hard. &ldquo;How was your trip?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t know what else\nto say.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Passable,&rdquo;\nshe said, in a French accent she refused to get rid of.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Victoire,&rdquo;\nJohn said, holding out his hand. She looked at it, but did not shake\nit. &ldquo;Thanks for coming to our wedding ceremony.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s\nmy only child. Of course I came,&rdquo; she said, sweeping her\nwaist-length silky mane of hair over her shoulder.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But\nyou said you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She was very upset about it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nwas in one of my moods when she called,&rdquo; she said, and shrugged.\n&ldquo;She knows.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did\nshe? Because she cried for days,&rdquo; John said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She\nalways cries,&rdquo; Victoire said. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve known her as a\nchild. It was her favorite thing to do. Cry and cry, and suck on the\ncorner of her favorite blankie in her crib.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He\nlooked at them both, disbelieving. First at her mother for her\ncallousness, and then at Connie, for being so complacent about it.\nShe was smiling, of all things.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Vicky!&rdquo;\nConnie&rsquo;s father said as he walked up, holding his arms out. &ldquo;What\na pleasure!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;For\nyou, yes,&rdquo; she said, looking at his short, barrel-shaped form.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\na lovely white gown you&rsquo;re wearing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you\nhate white, mi amor?&rdquo; her father said, smiling tensely.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nreserve the right to change my mind,&rdquo; she said, twirling and giving\nJohn a warm grin. &ldquo;And a beautiful woman doesn&rsquo;t need glitter and\nfanfare to look impressive.&rdquo; She waved her hand toward Connie. John\ngrunted. Connie squeezed his hand.\nHis breathing slowed to normal.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why\ndidn&rsquo;t you come earlier? You missed the bonfire on the beach,&rdquo;\nConnie\nsaid.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t do <i>bon</i>\nfires,&rdquo; she said, pronouncing &lsquo;bon&rsquo; in the most French way.\n&ldquo;What is that, even? What happened to indoor entertainment? It&rsquo;s\nmuch more civilised than drinking in the mud.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;John-\n<i>we</i>\nlike it here. The coast is special to us,&rdquo; she said, but her voice\nwas devoid of its usual confidence. &ldquo;You remember the story, don&rsquo;t\nyou?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Sexe\nsur la plage</i>\nand all that,&rdquo; she said, rolling her eyes. &ldquo;Ouiai. How romantic.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Her\nfather&rsquo;s mouth opened, but nothing came out.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas a bit - it was, um, a lot more than -&rdquo; she cleared her throat.\n&ldquo;He proposed to me here.&rdquo; She held out her left hand. Her mother\ntook it and looked closely at her engagement ring.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;ils\nsont le\ncouleur de\nla\npisse,&rdquo; she said about the diamonds. <i>They&rsquo;r</i><i>e\nthe color of </i><i>piss.</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,\nmama. It&rsquo;s concentrated sunshine, like he is.&rdquo; He\nfidgeted beside her. She\nsqueezed his hand again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Whatever\nyou say,&rdquo; Victoire said. &ldquo;Just wait until he stops shining so bright.&rdquo;\nShe gave her ex-husband a pointed look.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay,\nVicky. That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; he said, touching her elbow.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\nare you talking about?&rdquo; she said, looking innocently at John. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s\nmore handsome in person, isn&rsquo;t he, cari&ntilde;o?&rdquo;\nhe said to Connie&rsquo;s father. The grainy webcam didn&rsquo;t do him a bit of justice.<br /></p><p>John\nwas done with the drama. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased you&rsquo;re here, madame,\nbut I&rsquo;d like to marry your daughter now,&rdquo; he said, stepping\nforward. &ldquo;I see clearly now where Connie got her beauty.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;In\na certain light,&rdquo; Victoire said. She smiled as her ex-husband\ngently pulled her toward the wedding party.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;In\nevery kind of light,&rdquo; John said, and gave the woman a crooked grin.\nHe kissed Connie&rsquo;s lips, and they jogged the rest of the way back\nto the gazebo. The wedding party whispered as Victoire walked to the\nfront and sat down, not even bothering to apologize for the\ninterruption.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Everything\nokay?&rdquo; Alex whispered, giving the woman an openly hostile look.\nVictoire crossed her legs and ignored her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo;\nConnie said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her bother you. She&rsquo;s a bit mad, but I\nknew she would come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy. We&rsquo;re all\nhere.&rdquo; She smiled\ndreamily at John, and his heart swelled with love. She deserved so much.\nAnd he meant to do everything in his power to give it to her, every\nday.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are\nyou ready now?&rdquo; the priest said, hiding his irritation. He had\nanother wedding at 7 pm down the coast.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nlove you, sweetheart,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;And you look so\nbeautiful it hurts.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She\nrolled her eyes in Victoire&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;She feels bigger when\nshe gets the last word in. I let her, to make her feel important.&rdquo;\nHe made a face, and she caressed him. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway.\nYour lovely gaze makes all the rough edges of the world smooth.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He\nkissed her hand tenderly. &ldquo;Sweet talker.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\njust wait,&rdquo; she whispered. The priest cleared his throat again.\nThey both turned to look at him and smiled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s\nmake this official, padre,&rdquo;\nJohn said. &ldquo;And\nmake it quick. I don&rsquo;t want to wait a second longer.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><a href=\"http://uglywettiewrites.tumblr.com/post/175901659387/that-woman-over-there-epilogue\">Epilogue</a></p><hr /><p>PS - Told you all the original story had good bones&nbsp;&#128521;</p>",

She squinted toward where he was looking, curious.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;You\nlook like a Byronian hero,&rdquo; she said, proud of herself at the reference, then laughed out loud when she\nheard\nwhat he was actually doing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re disgustin&rsquo;, mate!&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I\nhad too much champagne earlier,&rdquo; he said, and winked. She turned\naround and waited for him to finish peeing.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Let\nme borrow that bottle of water,&rdquo; he said as he zipped up. She had\none in her pocket.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Keep\nit,&rdquo; she said, and handed it to him. He poured the water over his\nhands. &ldquo;Ever the gentleman. They&rsquo;re just waiting on the priest.\nEncarnaci&oacute;n&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>He\nsmiled. &ldquo;Encarnaci&oacute;n. Alphonse really rubbed off on you,&rdquo; he\nsaid.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;In\nmore ways than one,&rdquo; she said, and wiggled her eyebrow. He laughed.\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing.\nI&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re happy with the Frenchman,&rdquo; he said. Now\nthat she was working toward her dream, she was fiery with\nself-confidence. He felt fortunate that they were able to fix things\nso easily. After he came back from his ma&rsquo;s, she was\nalready\nback at\nhouse. Although he wasn&rsquo;t ready to speak immediately, she waited\nuntil he was, which was\nhard for a woman like her. He was grateful for her patience, and to\nhave his friend again.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Seriously,\nthough. You ready?&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nasking me that? You moved in with Alphonse after three months,&rdquo; he\nsaid.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;It\nwas mostly for convenience, and because Liv&rsquo;s selling the house.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nJohn said, making a funny face.<br /></p>\n</p>",
