        "body": "<p>One of my favorite forgotten Tyrion quotes about Shae is\u00a0\u201cShe deserved better than what he had to give her.\u201d Which comes after Tyrion is forced into the marriage with Sansa and right before Joffrey\u2019s wedding, when Tyrion is thinking about his dubious place at court and considering finding something better for Shae before things become worse for him under Joffrey\u2019s reign. And this quote becomes terrifyingly true when Tyrion later murders Shae, but it also tells the reader that one of Tyrion\u2019s main problems with his relationships with women is that he thinks he has nothing worthy to give.</p><p>And this of course has a lot to do with his disability and the ableism he\u2019s internalized by years of abuse and being told that the only thing of value about him is his Lannister name, and it comes up again when he interacts with Penny.</p><p>When Tyrion rejects Penny\u2019s kiss, he thinks about how he doesn\u2019t want to hurt her, but he ALSO thinks about how she doesn\u2019t <i>really</i> want him.</p><blockquote><p>This was nothing he had wanted. He liked Penny, he pitied Penny, he even admired Penny in a way, but he did not desire her. He had no wish to hurt her, though; the gods and his sweet sister had given her enough pain. So he let the kiss go on, holding her gently by the shoulders. His own lips stayed firmly shut. The Selaesori Qhoran rolled and shuddered around them.Finally she pulled back an inch or two.\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion could see his own reflection shining in her eyes. Pretty eyes, he thought, but he saw other things as well. A lot of fear, a little hope \u2026 but not a bit of lust. <i>She does not want me, no more than I want her.\n\n</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>For once, Tyrion is in the position to be on the receiving end of someone else\u2019s affection, and he feels bad that he can\u2019t return it, but also thinks that she can\u2019t really want anything he has to offer her. Penny actually has the same insecurities about her own body.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;Are you a maid, Penny?&rdquo;</p><p>She blushed. &ldquo;Yes. Of course. Who would have\u2014&rdquo;\n\n<br/></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Stay that way. Love is madness, and lust is poison. Keep your maidenhead. You&rsquo;ll be happier for it, and you&rsquo;re less like to find yourself in some dingy brothel on the Rhoyne with a whore who looks a bit like your lost love.&rdquo;\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Penny also has internalized ableism about her own body and I think she thinks that Tyrion might be safer to express affection for because he is also a dwarf. Penny\u2019s also probably had more friendly and loving interactions with other dwarfs than with able bodied people so she probably feels more comfortable with Tyrion than an able bodied person, who she thinks would\u00a0\u201cof course\u201d reject her.</p><p>Tyrion, on the other hand, has never met another dwarf and feels uncomfortable around her because she reminds him of his own vulnerabilities, and that\u2019s part of the reason he rejects her. He\u2019s also thinking in the above quote about love in general in a very cynical way, as something false and untrustworthy and unattainable.</p><p>But he also thinks Penny does not find him physically attractive (nor does she feel that way about herself) and so he thinks that he has nothing worthy to give her. He can\u2019t please her physically and he can\u2019t meet her emotional needs, but he DOES think about how she deserves something better.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe girl deserves better than a pig, he thought. An honest kiss, a little kindness, everyone deserves that much, however big or small.</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion is talking about Penny but I think he\u2019s also on some level talking about himself, although I don\u2019t think he quite makes the leap from\u00a0\u201cshe deserves better\u201d to\u00a0\u201cI deserved better.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think of himself as someone who can give love or even kindness, and when he\u2019s thinking about his kindness towards Penny he thinks of it as a lie.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nSometimes he envied the girl all her pretty little dreams. She reminded him of Sansa Stark, the child bride he had wed and lost. Despite the horrors Penny had suffered, she remained somehow trusting. She should know better. She is older than Sansa. And she&rsquo;s a dwarf. She acts as if she has forgotten that, as if she were highborn and fair to look upon, instead of a slave in a grotesquerie. At night Tyrion would oft hear her praying. A waste of words. If there are gods to listen, they are monstrous gods who torment us for their sport. Who else would make a world like this, so full of bondage, blood, and pain? Who else would shape us as they have? Sometimes he wanted to slap her, shake her, scream at her, anything to wake her from her dreams. No one is going to save us, he wanted to scream at her. The worst is yet to come. Yet somehow he could never say the words. Instead of giving her a good hard crack across that ugly face of hers to knock the blinders from her eyes, he would find himself squeezing her shoulder or giving her a hug. Every touch a lie. I have paid her so much false coin that she half thinks she&rsquo;s rich.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>I think Tyrion actually does love Penny on some level, but he doesn\u2019t realize it because he thinks that he isn\u2019t in a position to give her that honest kiss. Tyrion thinks similarly about Sansa when he\u2019s forced to marry her.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie, Sansa. I am malformed, scarred, and small, but &hellip;&rdquo; she could see him groping &ldquo;&hellip; abed, when the candles are blown out, I am made no worse than other men. In the dark, I am the Knight of Flowers.&rdquo; He took a draught of wine. &ldquo;I am generous. Loyal to those who are loyal to me. I&rsquo;ve proven I&rsquo;m no craven. And I am cleverer than most, surely wits count for something. I can even be kind. Kindness is not a habit with us Lannisters, I fear, but I know I have some somewhere. I could be &hellip; I could be good to you.&rdquo;\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>A lot of this is because of his disability but it\u2019s also because Tyrion is an abuse victim who doesn\u2019t know how to either give or receive kindness. He automatically assumes that any kind words Sansa gives to him are lies and also assumes his kindness towards her is a lie as well.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n &ldquo;Sansa, is aught amiss?&rdquo; He spoke without thinking, and instantly felt the fool. All her kin are slaughtered and she&rsquo;s wed to me, and I wonder what&rsquo;s amiss.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Of course Tyrion is right to know that he can\u2019t make things better for Sansa because of WHO he is and her position as a Lannister hostage and a child who should not be in this position in the first place, but he also attributes it in part to the fact that he\u2019s disabled. Which isn\u2019t incorrect either because Sansa IS repulsed by his disability, and that makes Tyrion withdraw further, even though Sansa does try to be kind to Tyrion and isn\u2019t quite as ableist as Tyrion expects her to be. But Tyrion doesn\u2019t blame Sansa for this, he assumes her ableism as a state of fact, because he\u2019s been raised to expect nothing less, just like Penny. <i>Of course, who would have -\u00a0</i></p><p>So, when people say that Tyrion\u00a0\u201cexpects\u201d things from women, I think it\u2019s rather the opposite. I think Tyrion expects very little when it comes to how other people see him, and this makes it difficult for him to both give and receive affection. What we should be saying instead is that Tyrion <i>should</i> expect more. He should expect more than this:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n \u201cBe certain that you tell her who I am, and warn her of<i> what </i>I am.&ldquo; Jyck had not always troubled to do that. There was a look the girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling they&rsquo;d been hired to pleasure \u2026 a look that Tyrion Lannister did not ever care to see again.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>He should expect more than that women need to be <b>warned</b> that he\u2019s disabled. He shouldn\u2019t be treating it as a given that people are repulsed by his appearance. This doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s owed sex or love or anything, but he\u2019s absolutely right to feel angry and hurt about ableism and he SHOULD be expecting more, and so should the fandom.</p>",

And this quote becomes terrifyingly true when Tyrion later murders Shae, but it also tells the reader that one of Tyrion\u2019s main problems with his relationships with women is that he thinks he has nothing worthy to give.</p><p>And this of course has a lot to do with his disability and the ableism he\u2019s internalized by years of abuse and being told that the only thing of value about him is his Lannister name, and it comes up again when he interacts with Penny.</p><p>When Tyrion rejects Penny\u2019s kiss, he thinks about how he doesn\u2019t want to hurt her, but he ALSO thinks about how she doesn\u2019t <i>really</i> want him.</p><blockquote><p>This was nothing he had wanted. He liked Penny, he pitied Penny, he even admired Penny in a way, but he did not desire her. He had no wish to hurt her, though; the gods and his sweet sister had given her enough pain. So he let the kiss go on, holding her gently by the shoulders. His own lips stayed firmly shut. The Selaesori Qhoran rolled and shuddered around them.Finally she pulled back an inch or two.\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion could see his own reflection shining in her eyes. Pretty eyes, he thought, but he saw other things as well. A lot of fear, a little hope \u2026 but not a bit of lust. <i>She does not want me, no more than I want her.\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>For once, Tyrion is in the position to be on the receiving end of someone else\u2019s affection, and he feels bad that he can\u2019t return it, but also thinks that she can\u2019t really want anything he has to offer her. Penny actually has the same insecurities about her own body.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\u201cAre you a maid, Penny?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cYes. Of course. Who would have\u2014\u201d\n\n<br></p><p>\n\n\u201cStay that way. Love is madness, and lust is poison. Keep your maidenhead. You\u2019ll be happier for it, and you\u2019re less like to find yourself in some dingy brothel on the Rhoyne with a whore who looks a bit like your lost love.\u201d\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Penny also has internalized ableism about her own body and I think she thinks that Tyrion might be safer to express affection for because he is also a dwarf. Penny\u2019s also probably had more friendly and loving interactions with other dwarfs than with able bodied people so she probably feels more comfortable with Tyrion than an able bodied person, who she thinks would\u00a0\u201cof course\u201d reject her.</p><p>Tyrion, on the other hand, has never met another dwarf and feels uncomfortable around her because she reminds him of his own vulnerabilities, and that\u2019s part of the reason he rejects her. He\u2019s also thinking in the above quote about love in general in a very cynical way, as something false and untrustworthy and unattainable.</p><p>But he also thinks Penny does not find him physically attractive (nor does she feel that way about herself) and so he thinks that he has nothing worthy to give her. He can\u2019t please her physically and he can\u2019t meet her emotional needs, but he DOES think about how she deserves something better.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe girl deserves better than a pig, he thought. An honest kiss, a little kindness, everyone deserves that much, however big or small.</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion is talking about Penny but I think he\u2019s also on some level talking about himself, although I don\u2019t think he quite makes the leap from\u00a0\u201cshe deserves better\u201d to\u00a0\u201cI deserved better.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think of himself as someone who can give love or even kindness, and when he\u2019s thinking about his kindness towards Penny he thinks of it as a lie.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nSometimes he envied the girl all her pretty little dreams. She reminded him of Sansa Stark, the child bride he had wed and lost. Despite the horrors Penny had suffered, she remained somehow trusting. She should know better. She is older than Sansa. And she\u2019s a dwarf. She acts as if she has forgotten that, as if she were highborn and fair to look upon, instead of a slave in a grotesquerie. At night Tyrion would oft hear her praying. A waste of words. If there are gods to listen, they are monstrous gods who torment us for their sport. Who else would make a world like this, so full of bondage, blood, and pain? Who else would shape us as they have? Sometimes he wanted to slap her, shake her, scream at her, anything to wake her from her dreams. No one is going to save us, he wanted to scream at her. The worst is yet to come. Yet somehow he could never say the words. Instead of giving her a good hard crack across that ugly face of hers to knock the blinders from her eyes, he would find himself squeezing her shoulder or giving her a hug. Every touch a lie. I have paid her so much false coin that she half thinks she\u2019s rich.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>I think Tyrion actually does love Penny on some level, but he doesn\u2019t realize it because he thinks that he isn\u2019t in a position to give her that honest kiss. Tyrion thinks similarly about Sansa when he\u2019s forced to marry her.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie, Sansa. I am malformed, scarred, and small, but \u2026\u201d she could see him groping \u201c\u2026 abed, when the candles are blown out, I am made no worse than other men. In the dark, I am the Knight of Flowers.\u201d He took a draught of wine. \u201cI am generous. Loyal to those who are loyal to me. I\u2019ve proven I\u2019m no craven. And I am cleverer than most, surely wits count for something. I can even be kind. Kindness is not a habit with us Lannisters, I fear, but I know I have some somewhere. I could be \u2026 I could be good to you.\u201d\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>A lot of this is because of his disability but it\u2019s also because Tyrion is an abuse victim who doesn\u2019t know how to either give or receive kindness. He automatically assumes that any kind words Sansa gives to him are lies and also assumes his kindness towards her is a lie as well.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n \u201cSansa, is aught amiss?\u201d He spoke without thinking, and instantly felt the fool. All her kin are slaughtered and she\u2019s wed to me, and I wonder what\u2019s amiss.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Of course Tyrion is right to know that he can\u2019t make things better for Sansa because of WHO he is and her position as a Lannister hostage and a child who should not be in this position in the first place, but he also attributes it in part to the fact that he\u2019s disabled. Which isn\u2019t incorrect either because Sansa IS repulsed by his disability, and that makes Tyrion withdraw further, even though Sansa does try to be kind to Tyrion and isn\u2019t quite as ableist as Tyrion expects her to be. But Tyrion doesn\u2019t blame Sansa for this, he assumes her ableism as a state of fact, because he\u2019s been raised to expect nothing less, just like Penny. <i>Of course, who would have -\u00a0</i></p><p>So, when people say that Tyrion\u00a0\u201cexpects\u201d things from women, I think it\u2019s rather the opposite. I think Tyrion expects very little when it comes to how other people see him, and this makes it difficult for him to both give and receive affection. What we should be saying instead is that Tyrion <i>should</i> expect more. He should expect more than this:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n \u201cBe certain that you tell her who I am, and warn her of<i> what </i>I am.\u201c Jyck had not always troubled to do that. There was a look the girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling they\u2019d been hired to pleasure \u2026 a look that Tyrion Lannister did not ever care to see again.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>He should expect more than that women need to be <b>warned</b> that he\u2019s disabled. He shouldn\u2019t be treating it as a given that people are repulsed by his appearance. This doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s owed sex or love or anything, but he\u2019s absolutely right to feel angry and hurt about ableism and he SHOULD be expecting more, and so should the fandom.</p>",

She isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;hero&rdquo; at least in terms of our perception of what a hero is. Most people look at typical fairytales and how stories normally write protagonists. They&rsquo;re good no matter what, they&rsquo;re perfect, they are the recievers of everything good in the world.

She&rsquo;s meant to be a <b>HUMAN</b> with real flaws who makes real mistakes, but also has her good points.</p><p>On that note, if your issue with Dany is that she&rsquo;s <b>NOT</b> a perfect hero stereotype, I cannot fathom how you handle the other characters on the show. Just look at them all&hellip;</p><p>Arya Stark doesn&rsquo;t fit the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; mold of a lady, she&rsquo;s into swords and murder and she&rsquo;s off with the Faceless Men (and casually killing all of the Freys). Sansa Stark was the normal mold of a lady and she was the victim of those who abused and manipulated her, and she&rsquo;s learnt from them (Littlefinger especially) in order to survive. Olenna Tyrell straight up poisoned Joff in order to get her granddaughter a better husband. The Sandsnakes murdered&hellip; a lot of people&hellip; because the Lannisters did terrible things to their family and House. Cersei blew up the Sept and murdered a crap ton of people because she wanted to protect her children and herself. Dany was stuck with an unstable older brother, raped, forced to marry etc. And later burnt a bunch of people and is still aiming to take her throne.</p><p>(A very basic run-down, lmao).</p><p>All of these women are morally grey. They&rsquo;ve been through crap because they are real. They&rsquo;ve done stupid things, necessary things, selfish things and terrible things. They are human. It&rsquo;s the entire point of their characters.

That&rsquo;s the entire point. If Dany were a cardboard cutout of your perfect hero, she would be boring and she would never have an issue. But she isn&rsquo;t that. She is interesting and makes mistakes and has flaws. Dany is - as I sais in a post previously - idealistic to a fault. She freed the slaves of Meereen and suffered the consequences of those actions. If she were perfect, it would have been perfect. Surprise - it wasn&rsquo;t. She ain&rsquo;t perfect.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s the other thing, Dany Stans&hellip;</p><p>Dany isn&rsquo;t a perfect human being. If you agree with every decision she&rsquo;s ever made and consider her to be the &ldquo;true queen&rdquo; and that she&rsquo;s never made a mistake because she&rsquo;s perfect&hellip; <i>you are missing the point, too.</i></p><p>She is not perfect, no one is, and she isn&rsquo;t written to be. We&rsquo;re not meant to agree with her fully or to love her unconditionally. </p><p>Personally, I have conflicting feelings about Dany. I used to be rather Anti, and was convinced that she would end up as the Mad Queen. But recently, I have come to really appreciate the &ldquo;morally grey/ambiguous&rdquo; way that GRRM has written Dany and everyone else. I don&rsquo;t love Dany but I don&rsquo;t hate her.</p><p>So, point of the post<b>: <i>Morally grey is okay</i>.</b></p><p><strike>Shitting on Dany for being morally grey is shitting on effective, complex storytelling and character development. And that&rsquo;s the <b>TEA. </b></strike></p>",
