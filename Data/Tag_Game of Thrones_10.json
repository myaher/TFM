Weiss (henceforth referred to as D&amp;D for simplicity sake), not many fans seem to be excited about it as they should due to the creative choices taken in regards to the final season of Game of Thrones. Speaking as a GoT fan, I used to enjoy the show a lot and I believe it reached it\u2019s peak on Season 4 and started to go went downhill on Season 5. If D&amp;D were in charge from the beginning what happened?</p><!-- more --><p>D&amp;D\u2019s job was always to adapt the book series by George R. R. Martin, which means any merit to the show\u2019s writing can be attributed largely to Martin while D&amp;D were only fit for it to make it work into a tv show - which is still laudable in it\u2019s own right because there are things in the books that still wouldn\u2019t translate too well into the show. In any case, they did their job well from Season 1 to Season 4 which adapted the first trilogy in the series. Even though there are still five books in total released at the time, Season 5 is where they started to run out of material to adapt because some storylines didn\u2019t find their proper conclusion and they needed to come up with their own unique deviations.</p><p>Season 5 is considered by many fans to be the low point in the series because of it\u2019s extremely low pacing and controversial liberties taken: the biggest ones have to be the Dorne subplot because that meant axing popular book character Arianne Martell, Stannis Baratheon turning irredeemable evil and paying with his life and Sansa\u2019s marriage to Ramsay Snow leading to her rape, which is still a very hot button among the fandom to this day (and understandably so). Season 5 did have some moments like Hardhome which showed the strength of the true villain of the series, the Night King, the leader of the White Walker invasion who brings winter with him. He is the Thanos-like menace who is teased since the very start of the show with the very first scene opening with a White Walker killing some Night Watch\u2019s rangers and warning us about the danger he represents.</p><p>Season 6 fixed some of these problems by giving a more dynamic pacing and build it up with the Battle of the Bastards as the climatic encounter instead of something completely anti-climatic like Season 5\u2032s finale where Stannis Baratheon\u2019s forces were liquidated by the Boltons offscreen. But still, it was an entire season wasted to fix another one\u2019s problems and it still had some individual problems.\u00a0</p><p>And then Season 7 came along and it all went to waste. I wouldn\u2019t say it was as bad as Season 5 because at least shit happened and it wasn\u2019t boring, but it was still full of groan-worthy moments like trying to force some romance between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen which doesn\u2019t work because they have no chemistry and they are related by blood, curing Jorah Mormont who has been infected with a dangerous disease that will turn him into a snow zombie by simply cutting out the infected area, and of course lest we forget the Wight Hunt in Episode 6\u00a0\u201cBeyond the Wall\u201d which broke all suspension of disbelief. Lemme sum it up for you what happens in that episode so you can get the idea and let me put up a map so you can get it from reference.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"1120\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/723e5409a3e7b7d166b39372a866853f/tumblr_inline_pr9pu3XCjW1wao2lc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"1120\"/></figure><ol><li>The heroes come up with the idea to capture an Wight and bring it South to convince Cersei to from a truce.</li><li>The travel by boat to the Wall from their base on Dragonstone.</li><li>After reaching the Wall, they walk into the land beyond it to find a wight.</li><li>They find one and send one of their members back to ask reinforcements having to sprint a indeterminate distance.</li><li>The team gets surrounded by the Night King\u2019s army in a frozen lake for a indeterminate amount of time.</li><li>The allies at the Wall send a raven back to Dragonstone requesting help.</li><li>Daenerys summons her dragons to fly to the land beyond the Wall to rescue the heroes.</li><li>They are fighting to the last against the advancing horde of the Night King just before Daenerys arrives in a triumphant moment to save them.</li></ol><p>And all of this happens like&hellip; Within a hour apparently. Several days should have taken place between this exchange but time moves at the speed of the plot, but D&amp;D seem to be relying on emotional torque to get viewers to ignore all internal logic and be mindblown by the crowning moments of awesome. And this is the core issue with their writing.</p><p>D&amp;D write their scenes the same way they film sex scenes apparently, hoping that the emotional moments will make the audience be carried over. Thing is&hellip; I realized this after thinking up about many moments in the past. Hardhome was one such example in Season 5 to make up for its abhorrent dullness and even Season 6 wasn\u2019t safe from this. For example, remember how Rickon Stark died just so he could provoke Jon Snow to act irrationally and spur him into conflict? Why didn\u2019t Rickon run in zig-zag when Ramsay began firing arrows at him? Why did he run into a straight line? Did these writers not watch Prometheus to learn their lessons from it\u2019s mistakes? This problem was carried over in Season 8 and amplified a lot in the Long Night. Many people pointed out the several military blunders made by the protagonists when fighting against the Night King\u2019s army.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEA5mJRFaI8c\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EA5mJRFaI8c?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>I could talk about the moronic choice to film everything in absolute darkness and make it impossible to see shit.</p><p>I could talk about how idiotic it was to waste your cavalry against the enemy bulwark.</p><p>I could talk about how they didn\u2019t create trenches with tar or use fire for more effective manner against the undead.</p><p>But I\u2019d rather talk about that moment.</p><p><b>Arya killing the Night King.</b></p><p>You know at first I was okay with that because:</p><ol><li>I wasn\u2019t being a fan of Jon Snow in a long time.</li><li>Arya wasn\u2019t a Mary Sue, had skills that justified her, so I could buy it better.</li></ol><p>But the more I thought about it, more I came to the realization that it was a wrong choice all along.</p><ul><li>Arya never had any investment in killing the Night King. She was a character defined by a list of people she wanted to kill including the Freys, Cersei, Joffrey and others.</li><li>Arya was trained as an assassin yes&hellip; But her training in Season 5 and 6 was very lackluster. She spent some time doing menial works, impersonating some people and trying to spill some poison on someone\u2019s drink. She never learned invisibility, teleportation or any other cool shit.</li><li>And most importantly&hellip; Melisandre predicting that Arya would shut down\u00a0\u201cblue eyes\u201d way back when they met in Season 3. If she sensed she was always destined to kill the Night King why did she ever support Stannis? Why did she even support Jon Snow? She even referred to him as the Prince that was Promised. Some fans can try to spin this as much as they want, but it breaks the plot retroactively very hard.</li><li>The actress herself didn\u2019t think she deserved it</li></ul><figure data-orig-width=\"607\" data-orig-height=\"420\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b016e380ce657375e5dbd42fd58a45c8/tumblr_inline_prab13MjKn1wao2lc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"607\" data-orig-height=\"420\"/></figure><p>Of course all of these things were ignored by a large part of the fanbase, more specifically the\u00a0\u201cwoke\u201d crowd because YAS QUEEN SLAY. Little did they know that the very next episode would force them to eat a real shit sandwich when\u00a0\u201cThe Last of the Starks\u201d seemed to turn the narrative against Daenerys Targaryen by turning her into the Mad Queen, killing her handmaiden Missandei and setting up Jon to be the next King of Westeros. Not helping matters is that a series of leaks not yet confirmed as of the time of writing were released prior to the episode (but I personally feel they were legitimate due to some specific things but that is not the point) which sent many Daenerys fans into panic mode.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1122\" data-orig-height=\"232\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31e7ef698f18859d63f3fdcc27e20cdb/tumblr_inline_praax0IQNv1wao2lc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1122\" data-orig-height=\"232\"/></figure><p>Speaking as someone who really doesn\u2019t like Daenerys Targaryen, I can actually sympathize with them at some level because this shift appears to be very sudden specially now that the authors favored her more until this very moment. Some viewers can argue that there were always signs like her burning the Tarlys for refusing to bend the knee, which I personally took issue with before but it never really came across as the sign of an insane ruler since she offered very valid rebuttals. It all seemed like the plot was tailored to take her side no matter what and I considered Dany a Mary Sue. But just because they seem to be turning her into a villain now, it doesn\u2019t make me hate the story any less.</p><p>Now&hellip; I spent an inordinate amount of time bitching about Game of Thrones and if you are an Star Wars fan that doesn\u2019t know anything about it, you might be lost to anything I am writing. Well I needed to give an proper context to both GoT and SW fans since those seem to overlap now and give you a warning because Star Wars seems to be more lost now than ever. D&amp;D were never particularly good writers, they were incoherent about continuity, care more about spectacle over substance and seem to share a thing about subverting the audience\u2019s expectations like a certain Ruin Johnson who succeeded in completely ruining a franchise like there was no tomorrow. The key difference between D&amp;D and Ruin is that the duo doesn\u2019t share the same flippant attitude or picking up fights with fans on Twitter - on the contrary, D&amp;D understand the power of fanservice even if it means daggling the metaphorical shining keys in front of the audience.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1325\" data-orig-height=\"277\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9eed2aba67e48dfa84884d77327dc5e/tumblr_inline_prabakRMDY1wao2lc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1325\" data-orig-height=\"277\"/></figure><p>As we come close to Game of Thrones conclusion, I have a feeling that nobody will truly come out satisfied with it should the story take the direction that we are really dreading. I\u2019ve seen interviews about how Emilia Clarke sounds really sad and deflated, seemed like she was really disappointed with how the show ended. Whatever happens, the blame can be laid on the feet of Benioff and Weiss for their frankly baffling creative decisions. This season has been disappointing through and through with two or three episodes being needlessly long and filler to booth and to make matters worse, it was supposed to end earlier than 10 episodes. Why did they need to rush it and yet fill the series with so much dead air?</p><p>Now can you imagine a Star Wars movie made by them? With all these things I listed?\u00a0The next trilogy is already dated, we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s D&amp;D or Ruin Johnson yet. We are talking about a couple of writers that have no sense of realistic scale, continuity or logic, but rely on cheap emotional tricks to have the audience invested until they begin thinking about it. I would laugh until I was sick if this season turns everyone against those two fuckwads that Disney changes their mind about putting them in charge. If the world was a just place, this is what would happen at least.</p>",

He is the Thanos-like menace who is teased since the very start of the show with the very first scene opening with a White Walker killing some Night Watch\u2019s rangers and warning us about the danger he represents.</p><p>Season 6 fixed some of these problems by giving a more dynamic pacing and build it up with the Battle of the Bastards as the climatic encounter instead of something completely anti-climatic like Season 5\u2032s finale where Stannis Baratheon\u2019s forces were liquidated by the Boltons offscreen. But still, it was an entire season wasted to fix another one\u2019s problems and it still had some individual problems.\u00a0</p><p>And then Season 7 came along and it all went to waste. I wouldn\u2019t say it was as bad as Season 5 because at least shit happened and it wasn\u2019t boring, but it was still full of groan-worthy moments like trying to force some romance between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen which doesn\u2019t work because they have no chemistry and they are related by blood, curing Jorah Mormont who has been infected with a dangerous disease that will turn him into a snow zombie by simply cutting out the infected area, and of course lest we forget the Wight Hunt in Episode 6\u00a0\u201cBeyond the Wall\u201d which broke all suspension of disbelief. Lemme sum it up for you what happens in that episode so you can get the idea and let me put up a map so you can get it from reference.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"1120\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/723e5409a3e7b7d166b39372a866853f/tumblr_inline_pr9pu3XCjW1wao2lc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"1120\"></figure><ol><li>The heroes come up with the idea to capture an Wight and bring it South to convince Cersei to from a truce.</li><li>The travel by boat to the Wall from their base on Dragonstone.</li><li>After reaching the Wall, they walk into the land beyond it to find a wight.</li><li>They find one and send one of their members back to ask reinforcements having to sprint a indeterminate distance.</li><li>The team gets surrounded by the Night King\u2019s army in a frozen lake for a indeterminate amount of time.</li><li>The allies at the Wall send a raven back to Dragonstone requesting help.</li><li>Daenerys summons her dragons to fly to the land beyond the Wall to rescue the heroes.</li><li>They are fighting to the last against the advancing horde of the Night King just before Daenerys arrives in a triumphant moment to save them.</li></ol><p>And all of this happens like\u2026 Within a hour apparently. Several days should have taken place between this exchange but time moves at the speed of the plot, but D&amp;D seem to be relying on emotional torque to get viewers to ignore all internal logic and be mindblown by the crowning moments of awesome. And this is the core issue with their writing.</p><p>D&amp;D write their scenes the same way they film sex scenes apparently, hoping that the emotional moments will make the audience be carried over. Thing is\u2026 I realized this after thinking up about many moments in the past. Hardhome was one such example in Season 5 to make up for its abhorrent dullness and even Season 6 wasn\u2019t safe from this. For example, remember how Rickon Stark died just so he could provoke Jon Snow to act irrationally and spur him into conflict? Why didn\u2019t Rickon run in zig-zag when Ramsay began firing arrows at him? Why did he run into a straight line? Did these writers not watch Prometheus to learn their lessons from it\u2019s mistakes? This problem was carried over in Season 8 and amplified a lot in the Long Night. Many people pointed out the several military blunders made by the protagonists when fighting against the Night King\u2019s army.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEA5mJRFaI8c\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EA5mJRFaI8c?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>I could talk about the moronic choice to film everything in absolute darkness and make it impossible to see shit.</p><p>I could talk about how idiotic it was to waste your cavalry against the enemy bulwark.</p><p>I could talk about how they didn\u2019t create trenches with tar or use fire for more effective manner against the undead.</p><p>But I\u2019d rather talk about that moment.</p><p><b>Arya killing the Night King.</b></p><p>You know at first I was okay with that because:</p><ol><li>I wasn\u2019t being a fan of Jon Snow in a long time.</li><li>Arya wasn\u2019t a Mary Sue, had skills that justified her, so I could buy it better.</li></ol><p>But the more I thought about it, more I came to the realization that it was a wrong choice all along.</p><ul><li>Arya never had any investment in killing the Night King.

D&amp;D were never particularly good writers, they were incoherent about continuity, care more about spectacle over substance and seem to share a thing about subverting the audience\u2019s expectations like a certain Ruin Johnson who succeeded in completely ruining a franchise like there was no tomorrow. The key difference between D&amp;D and Ruin is that the duo doesn\u2019t share the same flippant attitude or picking up fights with fans on Twitter - on the contrary, D&amp;D understand the power of fanservice even if it means daggling the metaphorical shining keys in front of the audience.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1325\" data-orig-height=\"277\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9eed2aba67e48dfa84884d77327dc5e/tumblr_inline_prabakRMDY1wao2lc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1325\" data-orig-height=\"277\"></figure><p>As we come close to Game of Thrones conclusion, I have a feeling that nobody will truly come out satisfied with it should the story take the direction that we are really dreading.

Weiss (henceforth referred to as D&amp;D for simplicity sake), not many fans seem to be excited about it as they should due to the creative choices taken in regards to the final season of Game of Thrones. Speaking as a GoT fan, I used to enjoy the show a lot and I believe it reached it\u2019s peak on Season 4 and started to go went downhill on Season 5. If D&amp;D were in charge from the beginning what happened?</p>[[MORE]]<p>D&amp;D\u2019s job was always to adapt the book series by George R. R. Martin, which means any merit to the show\u2019s writing can be attributed largely to Martin while D&amp;D were only fit for it to make it work into a tv show - which is still laudable in it\u2019s own right because there are things in the books that still wouldn\u2019t translate too well into the show. In any case, they did their job well from Season 1 to Season 4 which adapted the first trilogy in the series. Even though there are still five books in total released at the time, Season 5 is where they started to run out of material to adapt because some storylines didn\u2019t find their proper conclusion and they needed to come up with their own unique deviations.</p><p>Season 5 is considered by many fans to be the low point in the series because of it\u2019s extremely low pacing and controversial liberties taken: the biggest ones have to be the Dorne subplot because that meant axing popular book character Arianne Martell, Stannis Baratheon turning irredeemable evil and paying with his life and Sansa\u2019s marriage to Ramsay Snow leading to her rape, which is still a very hot button among the fandom to this day (and understandably so). Season 5 did have some moments like Hardhome which showed the strength of the true villain of the series, the Night King, the leader of the White Walker invasion who brings winter with him. He is the Thanos-like menace who is teased since the very start of the show with the very first scene opening with a White Walker killing some Night Watch\u2019s rangers and warning us about the danger he represents.</p><p>Season 6 fixed some of these problems by giving a more dynamic pacing and build it up with the Battle of the Bastards as the climatic encounter instead of something completely anti-climatic like Season 5\u2032s finale where Stannis Baratheon\u2019s forces were liquidated by the Boltons offscreen.

Weiss (henceforth referred to as D&amp;D for simplicity sake), not many fans seem to be excited about it as they should due to the creative choices taken in regards to the final season of Game of Thrones. Speaking as a GoT fan, I used to enjoy the show a lot and I believe it reached it&rsquo;s peak on Season 4 and started to go went downhill on Season 5. If D&amp;D were in charge from the beginning what happened?</p><p>D&amp;D&rsquo;s job was always to adapt the book series by George R. R. Martin, which means any merit to the show&rsquo;s writing can be attributed largely to Martin while D&amp;D were only fit for it to make it work into a tv show - which is still laudable in it&rsquo;s own right because there are things in the books that still wouldn&rsquo;t translate too well into the show. In any case, they did their job well from Season 1 to Season 4 which adapted the first trilogy in the series. Even though there are still five books in total released at the time, Season 5 is where they started to run out of material to adapt because some storylines didn&rsquo;t find their proper conclusion and they needed to come up with their own unique deviations.</p><p>Season 5 is considered by many fans to be the low point in the series because of it&rsquo;s extremely low pacing and controversial liberties taken: the biggest ones have to be the Dorne subplot because that meant axing popular book character Arianne Martell, Stannis Baratheon turning irredeemable evil and paying with his life and Sansa&rsquo;s marriage to Ramsay Snow leading to her rape, which is still a very hot button among the fandom to this day (and understandably so). Season 5 did have some moments like Hardhome which showed the strength of the true villain of the series, the Night King, the leader of the White Walker invasion who brings winter with him. He is the Thanos-like menace who is teased since the very start of the show with the very first scene opening with a White Walker killing some Night Watch&rsquo;s rangers and warning us about the danger he represents.</p><p>Season 6 fixed some of these problems by giving a more dynamic pacing and build it up with the Battle of the Bastards as the climatic encounter instead of something completely anti-climatic like Season 5&prime;s finale where Stannis Baratheon&rsquo;s forces were liquidated by the Boltons offscreen. But still, it was an entire season wasted to fix another one&rsquo;s problems and it still had some individual problems.&nbsp;</p><p>And then Season 7 came along and it all went to waste. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was as bad as Season 5 because at least shit happened and it wasn&rsquo;t boring, but it was still full of groan-worthy moments like trying to force some romance between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen which doesn&rsquo;t work because they have no chemistry and they are related by blood, curing Jorah Mormont who has been infected with a dangerous disease that will turn him into a snow zombie by simply cutting out the infected area, and of course lest we forget the Wight Hunt in Episode 6&nbsp;&ldquo;Beyond the Wall&rdquo; which broke all suspension of disbelief. Lemme sum it up for you what happens in that episode so you can get the idea and let me put up a map so you can get it from reference.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/723e5409a3e7b7d166b39372a866853f/tumblr_inline_pr9pu3XCjW1wao2lc_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><ol><li>The heroes come up with the idea to capture an Wight and bring it South to convince Cersei to from a truce.</li><li>The travel by boat to the Wall from their base on Dragonstone.</li><li>After reaching the Wall, they walk into the land beyond it to find a wight.</li><li>They find one and send one of their members back to ask reinforcements having to sprint a indeterminate distance.</li><li>The team gets surrounded by the Night King&rsquo;s army in a frozen lake for a indeterminate amount of time.</li><li>The allies at the Wall send a raven back to Dragonstone requesting help.</li><li>Daenerys summons her dragons to fly to the land beyond the Wall to rescue the heroes.</li><li>They are fighting to the last against the advancing horde of the Night King just before Daenerys arrives in a triumphant moment to save them.</li></ol><p>And all of this happens like&hellip; Within a hour apparently. Several days should have taken place between this exchange but time moves at the speed of the plot, but D&amp;D seem to be relying on emotional torque to get viewers to ignore all internal logic and be mindblown by the crowning moments of awesome. And this is the core issue with their writing.</p><p>D&amp;D write their scenes the same way they film sex scenes apparently, hoping that the emotional moments will make the audience be carried over. Thing is&hellip; I realized this after thinking up about many moments in the past. Hardhome was one such example in Season 5 to make up for its abhorrent dullness and even Season 6 wasn&rsquo;t safe from this. For example, remember how Rickon Stark died just so he could provoke Jon Snow to act irrationally and spur him into conflict? Why didn&rsquo;t Rickon run in zig-zag when Ramsay began firing arrows at him? Why did he run into a straight line? Did these writers not watch Prometheus to learn their lessons from it&rsquo;s mistakes? This problem was carried over in Season 8 and amplified a lot in the Long Night. Many people pointed out the several military blunders made by the protagonists when fighting against the Night King&rsquo;s army.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p>I could talk about the moronic choice to film everything in absolute darkness and make it impossible to see shit.</p><p>I could talk about how idiotic it was to waste your cavalry against the enemy bulwark.</p><p>I could talk about how they didn&rsquo;t create trenches with tar or use fire for more effective manner against the undead.</p><p>But I&rsquo;d rather talk about that moment.</p><p><b>Arya killing the Night King.</b></p><p>You know at first I was okay with that because:</p><ol><li>I wasn&rsquo;t being a fan of Jon Snow in a long time.</li><li>Arya wasn&rsquo;t a Mary Sue, had skills that justified her, so I could buy it better.</li></ol><p>But the more I thought about it, more I came to the realization that it was a wrong choice all along.</p><ul><li>Arya never had any investment in killing the Night King. She was a character defined by a list of people she wanted to kill including the Freys, Cersei, Joffrey and others.</li><li>Arya was trained as an assassin yes&hellip; But her training in Season 5 and 6 was very lackluster. She spent some time doing menial works, impersonating some people and trying to spill some poison on someone&rsquo;s drink. She never learned invisibility, teleportation or any other cool shit.</li><li>And most importantly&hellip; Melisandre predicting that Arya would shut down&nbsp;&ldquo;blue eyes&rdquo; way back when they met in Season 3. If she sensed she was always destined to kill the Night King why did she ever support Stannis? Why did she even support Jon Snow? She even referred to him as the Prince that was Promised. Some fans can try to spin this as much as they want, but it breaks the plot retroactively very hard.</li><li>The actress herself didn&rsquo;t think she deserved it</li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b016e380ce657375e5dbd42fd58a45c8/tumblr_inline_prab13MjKn1wao2lc_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Of course all of these things were ignored by a large part of the fanbase, more specifically the&nbsp;&ldquo;woke&rdquo; crowd because YAS QUEEN SLAY. Little did they know that the very next episode would force them to eat a real shit sandwich when&nbsp;&ldquo;The Last of the Starks&rdquo; seemed to turn the narrative against Daenerys Targaryen by turning her into the Mad Queen, killing her handmaiden Missandei and setting up Jon to be the next King of Westeros. Not helping matters is that a series of leaks not yet confirmed as of the time of writing were released prior to the episode (but I personally feel they were legitimate due to some specific things but that is not the point) which sent many Daenerys fans into panic mode.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31e7ef698f18859d63f3fdcc27e20cdb/tumblr_inline_praax0IQNv1wao2lc_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Speaking as someone who really doesn&rsquo;t like Daenerys Targaryen, I can actually sympathize with them at some level because this shift appears to be very sudden specially now that the authors favored her more until this very moment. Some viewers can argue that there were always signs like her burning the Tarlys for refusing to bend the knee, which I personally took issue with before but it never really came across as the sign of an insane ruler since she offered very valid rebuttals. It all seemed like the plot was tailored to take her side no matter what and I considered Dany a Mary Sue. But just because they seem to be turning her into a villain now, it doesn&rsquo;t make me hate the story any less.</p><p>Now&hellip; I spent an inordinate amount of time bitching about Game of Thrones and if you are an Star Wars fan that doesn&rsquo;t know anything about it, you might be lost to anything I am writing. Well I needed to give an proper context to both GoT and SW fans since those seem to overlap now and give you a warning because Star Wars seems to be more lost now than ever. D&amp;D were never particularly good writers, they were incoherent about continuity, care more about spectacle over substance and seem to share a thing about subverting the audience&rsquo;s expectations like a certain Ruin Johnson who succeeded in completely ruining a franchise like there was no tomorrow. The key difference between D&amp;D and Ruin is that the duo doesn&rsquo;t share the same flippant attitude or picking up fights with fans on Twitter - on the contrary, D&amp;D understand the power of fanservice even if it means daggling the metaphorical shining keys in front of the audience.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9eed2aba67e48dfa84884d77327dc5e/tumblr_inline_prabakRMDY1wao2lc_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>As we come close to Game of Thrones conclusion, I have a feeling that nobody will truly come out satisfied with it should the story take the direction that we are really dreading. I&rsquo;ve seen interviews about how Emilia Clarke sounds really sad and deflated, seemed like she was really disappointed with how the show ended. Whatever happens, the blame can be laid on the feet of Benioff and Weiss for their frankly baffling creative decisions. This season has been disappointing through and through with two or three episodes being needlessly long and filler to booth and to make matters worse, it was supposed to end earlier than 10 episodes. Why did they need to rush it and yet fill the series with so much dead air?</p><p>Now can you imagine a Star Wars movie made by them? With all these things I listed?&nbsp;The next trilogy is already dated, we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s D&amp;D or Ruin Johnson yet. We are talking about a couple of writers that have no sense of realistic scale, continuity or logic, but rely on cheap emotional tricks to have the audience invested until they begin thinking about it. I would laugh until I was sick if this season turns everyone against those two fuckwads that Disney changes their mind about putting them in charge. If the world was a just place, this is what would happen at least.</p></p>",
