            "description": "In addition to the pain and the exhaustion, he recalled how waiting on the cross between takes became tedious. To fight the boredom, he listened to music on headphones. One particular song called \"Above All\" (Like a Rose ...) by Michael W. Smith helped him through his most difficult moments.\n\n\"It arrived when I was confused and angry. I didn't think I could go on. The song described how Jesus was rejected and alone. That thought took me to a place \u2014 it opened an interior door that held me while on the cross,\" an emotional Caviezel explained. \"The experience of feeling rejected and alone as all those around me laughed while drinking their hot coffees, oblivious to what was occurring. Jesus must have felt like this \u2014 forsaken, rejected, alone, and despised. It helped me pray in a very deep way \u2014 to pray without words, to pray from the heart. The discomfort, the loneliness, the split shoulder, the raw flesh all forced me into the arms of God because I had nowhere else to go for a performance I knew I was unable to create.\"\nJim Caviezel, Shamelessly Catholic",

            "description": "In addition to the pain and the exhaustion, he recalled how waiting on the cross between takes became tedious. To fight the boredom, he listened to music on headphones. One particular song called \"Above All\" (Like a Rose ...) by Michael W. Smith helped him through his most difficult moments.\n\n\"It arrived when I was confused and angry. I didn't think I could go on. The song described how Jesus was rejected and alone. That thought took me to a place \u2014 it opened an interior door that held me while on the cross,\" an emotional Caviezel explained. \"The experience of feeling rejected and alone as all those around me laughed while drinking their hot coffees, oblivious to what was occurring. Jesus must have felt like this \u2014 forsaken, rejected, alone, and despised. It helped me pray in a very deep way \u2014 to pray without words, to pray from the heart. The discomfort, the loneliness, the split shoulder, the raw flesh all forced me into the arms of God because I had nowhere else to go for a performance I knew I was unable to create.\"\nJim Caviezel, Shamelessly Catholic",

Of course that peaked your curiousity. He knew how you felt about surprises. You loathed them because you were always so impatient to find out what the surprise was. He knew you would be rushing to get there and find out what was going on.</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what you did too.</p><p>You drove yourself to his place. You were thankful that the traffic in New York wasn\u2019t any worse than it was. It was just at the right time in the evening for everything to be moving smoothly.</p><p>When you pulled up to his gate, you typed in the code that opened it and drove yourself in. You parked your car at the front and got out then walked up to his door. You rang the doorbell and stood there, but he never came to the door. You rang it a couple of more times before you dug the key out he had given you just last week. He told you to use it anytime and this seemed like a perfect opportunity. You and Keanu were getting pretty serious.</p><p>You unlocked the door and walked in before shutting it behind you. You looked around and didn\u2019t see your boyfriend anywhere.</p><p>\u201cKeanu, I\u2019m here!\u201d You called out as you put your purse down by the door and started taking your coat off.</p><p>There was still no signs of Keanu as you kicked your boots off. What was going on? Keanu called you to come over for a surprise and he was nowhere to be seen. You checked the living room and kitchen for him, but there was no sign of him. He wasn\u2019t in the backyard either from what you could see through the patio doors.</p><p>\u201cKeanu, where are you?!\u201d You called out as you started going up the stairs to try searching for him there.</p><p>All you could do was hope he wouldn\u2019t jump out from somewhere and scare you. He knew how jumpy you were. He\u2019d sneak up on you and scare you without meaning to a lot. He was just too quiet.</p><p>You came to his bedroom first and didn\u2019t see him anywhere in there. The only other place you could think of that he would be in was his office. You made your way there and sure enough there he stood. His back was to you as he faced the window, looking out at the scenery before him. His hands were held behind his back.</p><p>\u201cKeanu, what\u2019s going on?\u201d You asked as you leaned against the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Keanu?\u201d He asked.</p><p>He finally turned to face you and your breath hitched at the sight. Keanu was dressed in an all black suit with his hair styled and slicked back. He had also trimmed his beard. This wasn\u2019t like Keanu. He would usually dress casually on a normal day such as that one. He seemed like he was trying to look a lot like his character&hellip;John Wick? Your eyebrows raised suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWho are you then?\u201d You asked, playing along with him.</p><p>\u201cMy name is John Wick,\u201d he replied smoothly.</p><p>You felt like you were going to fall out right there. That had to be your surprise. Keanu knew how much you loved his character, John Wick, since the movie night you\u2019d had together. He seemed amused about it all and even flattered. You\u2019d never told him you\u2019d had fantasies about it, however. It\u2019s like he just <i>knew. </i>You weren\u2019t complaining.</p><p>\u201cYour name is John Wick, huh?\u201d You asked him as you stepped into the room and closer to him. \u201cAnd just what are you doing here, Mr. Wick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came here because I was looking for someone,\u201d he said as you stopped a few feet from him.</p><p>\u201cDid you find this someone?\u201d You asked him.</p><p>\u201cI sure did,\u201d he replied as he looked at you in an almost intimidating manner. \u201cIn fact&hellip;they\u2019re standing right in front of me.\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck&hellip;</i>this<i> </i>was<i> </i>already<i> </i>so hot and it\u2019d barely even started.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d You asked, faking shock with him. \u201cWhat are you supposed to do now that you\u2019ve found me, Mr. Wick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, call me John,\u201d he told you as he stepped up closer to you. You backed away till your back hit the wall. His hands came to rest on each side of your head. \u201cSecond, I\u2019m supposed to do this.\u201d With that, he leaned down and captured your lips with his in a heated kiss.</p><p>You hummed into the kiss as your hands moved to rest on his still clothed chest. One of his hands  moved to cup your cheek as the other moved down to your hip. His body leaned into you more as he pulled your hips forward into his. You could feel that he was already hard, which made this all even better. You could feel yourself growing even wetter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my boyfriend\u2019s going to be too happy about this,\u201d you told <strike>Keanu </strike>John when he finally pulled away from the kiss, but his hips still moved against your own.</p><p>\u201cWhat he doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him will it?\u201d He asked before he picked you up in his arms and walked you over to the desk. </p><p>He placed you on the edge of the desk before he knocked everything that was on if off. It was just a bunch of papers, books, and some picture frames. Nothing too valuable. He wedged himself between your legs as you grabbed him by his tie and pulled him into you again. Your lips sought him out this time.</p><p>The kiss you shared was full of passion and a promise of what was about to come. You both fought for dominance, but he won out of course. The man had complete control over you and he knew it. You began taking his tie off, which took some work since neither one of you offered to break the kiss. </p><p>You could feel him taking his suit jacket off before his hands found the hem of your shirt. You both finally pulled away so he could pull it over your head. He let it fall to the ground before you grabbed his own shirt and ripped it open. The sound of buttons hitting the floor could be heard over the heavy breathing you both were doing. You hummed in appreciation as your hands touched his bare chest. He bit his lip as he took off the ruined shirt. He didn\u2019t seem upset about it.</p><p>You rested back on your hands to enjoy the show as he began undoing his belt. The way his fingers worked on the buckle was making you weak for some odd reason. He ripped the belt out of the loops and let it fall to the floor with a small clang.</p><p>\u201cTake off the rest of your clothes, Y/N,\u201d he said when he noticed that you were just watching him. \u201cI\u2019m here to fuck you, not play show and tell.\u201d</p><p>You bit your lip at that. He was being so dominant and demanding. You weren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s how John Wick would be, but you didn\u2019t care. You <i>loved </i>it. It suited him so well. You\u2019d take dominant John/Keanu any day. Also, Keanu knew you liked it when he was dominant. You were sure he was being this way for your enjoyment.</p><p>He moved back a bit so you hopped off of the desk and began taking off the rest of your clothes. He was doing the same till he was completely naked. His cock was hard and standing at attention. Keanu\u2019s size was <i>very</i> impressive. You licked your lips at the sight of it. You were just about to take off your panties, the only thing left on you, but his hands came to yours and stopped you.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d he said as you moved your hands.</p><p>His thumbs hooked into the waistband of your white lace panties and pulled them down. He bent down as well and helped you out of them before his hands rested on your bare hips. His face was <i>so </i>close to your pussy that you could feel his warm breath hitting it. You looked down at him anxiously as he looked back up at you. He kept eye contact with you as his toungue darted out and licked a long stripe up your slit. You gasped at the feeling and your hands found his hair, gripping onto it. Your hips bucked forward for more, but he kept a firm hold as his tongue explored more of you. He was running it up and down your slit before he found your clit, swirling his tongue around it. The feel of his beard against you was adding to the pleasure. His finger soon found your entrance then began thrusting in and out gradually before he added a second finger.</p><p>\u201cFuck&hellip;Keanu,\u201d you moaned out, accidentally calling him the wrong name since he was being John at the moment.</p><p>He pulled back at that, which made you whine at the loss of contact. You looked down at him again and found him giving you a look that you were shocked didn\u2019t make you cum for him right then. Also, his mouth and beard was glistening a bit from your wetness.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d He asked with a raised brow.</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d You told him quickly, correcting yourself. \u201cI meant John.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as he stood up. You didn\u2019t know what you were about to be in for, but you imagined that whatever it was was going to be something you enjoyed.</p><p>He towered over you since he was taller as you bit your lip, trying to look as innocent as you could. He placed his hands on your hips and turned you so that your back was facing him now. He bent you over so that your upper half was resting on top of the desk. You couldn\u2019t help but moan. The cool surface of the desk was causing your nipples to harden. You felt him pushing your legs apart as one of his hands rested on your lower back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d He asked as he took hold of his cock, rubbing it against your entrance.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d you moaned out lowly, enjoying the bit of teasing he was doing.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, sweetheart?\u201d He asked as he pushed himself inside of you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck&hellip;</i>John!\u201d You moaned out loudly at that. \u201cIt\u2019s John Wick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he groaned out as he pulled himself out almost completely then thrusted back into you. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d You called out as your hands moved above you and grabbed onto the edge of the desk. Your cheek rested against the cool surface of the desk. \u201cJohn Wick!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed onto your hips with both hands as he began thrusting in and out of you at a steady pace. The only thing that could be heard was his grunting and moans along with your own of his name. It seemed like each time you called out his name he would move that much deeper into you. All you could do was stand on the tip of your toes and hold on for the wild ride.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight, Y/N,\u201d he moaned out through each thrust he made.</p><p>Eventually he pulled out of you and quickly turned you to face him again. His eyes were blown wide and dark with lust. You were sure yours were the same. He picked you up and sat you on the edge of the desk. He grabbed his cock and entered you again as your legs wrapped around him tightly to keep him in place. His hands were back on your waist again as your own rested on his shoulders. He leaned down to kiss you, which you returned. It was heated and full of passion. Your tongues moved together and explored each other\u2019s mouths. He thrusted his hips just right to where he hit your sweet spot right on.</p><p>\u201cJohn, <i>yes!\u201d </i>You screamed as you pulled back from the kiss. \u201cRight there! Feels so fucking good!\u201d</p><p>He made sure to keep hitting that spot as your nails raked down his back. They would probably leave marks, but neither one of you cared. In fact, he enjoyed it. He moaned loudly at the feel of your nails digging into his back. He started thrusting even harder and faster into you.</p><p>He laid you back on the desk and leaned down, placing his lips around one of your nipples. His tongue darted out and licked around it as one of his hands worked on your other. Your hands found his hair and gripped onto it, not too tightly of course. All of the pleasure being given to you was making you feel close to your orgasm. You could feel it building up in the pit of your stomach.</p><p>\u201cJohn&hellip;John, I\u2019m <i>so </i>close,\u201d you moaned out as your eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>You could feel his mouth move off of your breast, but his hand stayed on the other. He squeezed it with just enough pressure to make you groan in pleasure and pain.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Y/N,\u201d he grunted through each thrust he made.</p><p>You opened your eyes and looked up at him. He was looking right back at you, right in the eyes, which made this even more intimate. His free hand moved down and you soon felt his thumb rubbing your clit, which made you moan even louder than you had been. Your hands reached back above your head to hold on to the edge of the desk again.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d he said in that husky voice of his. \u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t have to be told twice. A couple of thrusts and swirls of the thumb to your clit made you hit your high. Your back arched off of the desk as your orgasm hit you hard. You called out his name as you clenched around his cock and your hands tightened their hold on the desk.</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck,\u201d </i>he groaned out as he moved his hands to your hips. </p><p>His thrusts became sloppy before he finally came into you hard. He moaned as he rode out both of your highs lazily then he stopped. You were both panting messes. He leaned down above you, resting his hands against the desk to keep himself up. You moved your hands from the desk and instead reached up to move the fallen hair from his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere did <i>that </i>come from?\u201d You finally asked him. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thought we could try something new,\u201d Keanu replied with a small grin. \u201cSo I take it you liked it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah!\u201d You exclaimed, which made him chuckle. \u201cI like it when it\u2019s just you too, but that was different.\u201d</p><p>Keanu leaned down to peck your lips before he pulled himself up and pulled out of you. You winced at the empty feeling as you sat yourself up. You were an absolute mess.</p><p>\u201cI think we could use a shower, sweetheart,\u201d Keanu commented and you nodded in agreement.</p><p>He helped you off of the desk as you walked hand in hand into his bedroom and to the master bathroom.</p><p>\u201cSo how about I get some time with Keanu tonight?\u201d You asked as he turned the shower on.</p><p>\u201cYou can count on it, baby,\u201d he told you with a smirk as he pulled you into the shower with him.</p>",

Of course that peaked your curiousity. He knew how you felt about surprises. You loathed them because you were always so impatient to find out what the surprise was. He knew you would be rushing to get there and find out what was going on.</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what you did too.</p><p>You drove yourself to his place. You were thankful that the traffic in New York wasn\u2019t any worse than it was. It was just at the right time in the evening for everything to be moving smoothly.</p><p>When you pulled up to his gate, you typed in the code that opened it and drove yourself in. You parked your car at the front and got out then walked up to his door. You rang the doorbell and stood there, but he never came to the door. You rang it a couple of more times before you dug the key out he had given you just last week. He told you to use it anytime and this seemed like a perfect opportunity. You and Keanu were getting pretty serious.</p><p>You unlocked the door and walked in before shutting it behind you. You looked around and didn\u2019t see your boyfriend anywhere.</p><p>\u201cKeanu, I\u2019m here!\u201d You called out as you put your purse down by the door and started taking your coat off.</p><p>There was still no signs of Keanu as you kicked your boots off. What was going on? Keanu called you to come over for a surprise and he was nowhere to be seen. You checked the living room and kitchen for him, but there was no sign of him. He wasn\u2019t in the backyard either from what you could see through the patio doors.</p><p>\u201cKeanu, where are you?!\u201d You called out as you started going up the stairs to try searching for him there.</p><p>All you could do was hope he wouldn\u2019t jump out from somewhere and scare you. He knew how jumpy you were. He\u2019d sneak up on you and scare you without meaning to a lot. He was just too quiet.</p><p>You came to his bedroom first and didn\u2019t see him anywhere in there. The only other place you could think of that he would be in was his office. You made your way there and sure enough there he stood. His back was to you as he faced the window, looking out at the scenery before him. His hands were held behind his back.</p><p>\u201cKeanu, what\u2019s going on?\u201d You asked as you leaned against the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Keanu?\u201d He asked.</p><p>He finally turned to face you and your breath hitched at the sight. Keanu was dressed in an all black suit with his hair styled and slicked back. He had also trimmed his beard. This wasn\u2019t like Keanu. He would usually dress casually on a normal day such as that one. He seemed like he was trying to look a lot like his character\u2026John Wick? Your eyebrows raised suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWho are you then?\u201d You asked, playing along with him.</p><p>\u201cMy name is John Wick,\u201d he replied smoothly.</p><p>You felt like you were going to fall out right there. That had to be your surprise. Keanu knew how much you loved his character, John Wick, since the movie night you\u2019d had together. He seemed amused about it all and even flattered. You\u2019d never told him you\u2019d had fantasies about it, however. It\u2019s like he just <i>knew. </i>You weren\u2019t complaining.</p><p>\u201cYour name is John Wick, huh?\u201d You asked him as you stepped into the room and closer to him. \u201cAnd just what are you doing here, Mr. Wick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came here because I was looking for someone,\u201d he said as you stopped a few feet from him.</p><p>\u201cDid you find this someone?\u201d You asked him.</p><p>\u201cI sure did,\u201d he replied as he looked at you in an almost intimidating manner. \u201cIn fact\u2026they\u2019re standing right in front of me.\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck\u2026</i>this<i> </i>was<i> </i>already<i> </i>so hot and it\u2019d barely even started.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d You asked, faking shock with him. \u201cWhat are you supposed to do now that you\u2019ve found me, Mr. Wick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, call me John,\u201d he told you as he stepped up closer to you. You backed away till your back hit the wall. His hands came to rest on each side of your head. \u201cSecond, I\u2019m supposed to do this.\u201d With that, he leaned down and captured your lips with his in a heated kiss.</p><p>You hummed into the kiss as your hands moved to rest on his still clothed chest. One of his hands  moved to cup your cheek as the other moved down to your hip. His body leaned into you more as he pulled your hips forward into his. You could feel that he was already hard, which made this all even better. You could feel yourself growing even wetter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my boyfriend\u2019s going to be too happy about this,\u201d you told <strike>Keanu </strike>John when he finally pulled away from the kiss, but his hips still moved against your own.</p><p>\u201cWhat he doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him will it?\u201d He asked before he picked you up in his arms and walked you over to the desk. </p><p>He placed you on the edge of the desk before he knocked everything that was on if off. It was just a bunch of papers, books, and some picture frames. Nothing too valuable. He wedged himself between your legs as you grabbed him by his tie and pulled him into you again. Your lips sought him out this time.</p><p>The kiss you shared was full of passion and a promise of what was about to come. You both fought for dominance, but he won out of course. The man had complete control over you and he knew it. You began taking his tie off, which took some work since neither one of you offered to break the kiss. </p><p>You could feel him taking his suit jacket off before his hands found the hem of your shirt. You both finally pulled away so he could pull it over your head. He let it fall to the ground before you grabbed his own shirt and ripped it open. The sound of buttons hitting the floor could be heard over the heavy breathing you both were doing. You hummed in appreciation as your hands touched his bare chest. He bit his lip as he took off the ruined shirt. He didn\u2019t seem upset about it.</p><p>You rested back on your hands to enjoy the show as he began undoing his belt. The way his fingers worked on the buckle was making you weak for some odd reason. He ripped the belt out of the loops and let it fall to the floor with a small clang.</p><p>\u201cTake off the rest of your clothes, Y/N,\u201d he said when he noticed that you were just watching him. \u201cI\u2019m here to fuck you, not play show and tell.\u201d</p><p>You bit your lip at that. He was being so dominant and demanding. You weren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s how John Wick would be, but you didn\u2019t care. You <i>loved </i>it. It suited him so well. You\u2019d take dominant John/Keanu any day. Also, Keanu knew you liked it when he was dominant. You were sure he was being this way for your enjoyment.</p><p>He moved back a bit so you hopped off of the desk and began taking off the rest of your clothes. He was doing the same till he was completely naked. His cock was hard and standing at attention. Keanu\u2019s size was <i>very</i> impressive. You licked your lips at the sight of it. You were just about to take off your panties, the only thing left on you, but his hands came to yours and stopped you.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d he said as you moved your hands.</p><p>His thumbs hooked into the waistband of your white lace panties and pulled them down. He bent down as well and helped you out of them before his hands rested on your bare hips. His face was <i>so </i>close to your pussy that you could feel his warm breath hitting it. You looked down at him anxiously as he looked back up at you. He kept eye contact with you as his toungue darted out and licked a long stripe up your slit. You gasped at the feeling and your hands found his hair, gripping onto it. Your hips bucked forward for more, but he kept a firm hold as his tongue explored more of you. He was running it up and down your slit before he found your clit, swirling his tongue around it. The feel of his beard against you was adding to the pleasure. His finger soon found your entrance then began thrusting in and out gradually before he added a second finger.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026Keanu,\u201d you moaned out, accidentally calling him the wrong name since he was being John at the moment.</p><p>He pulled back at that, which made you whine at the loss of contact. You looked down at him again and found him giving you a look that you were shocked didn\u2019t make you cum for him right then. Also, his mouth and beard was glistening a bit from your wetness.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d He asked with a raised brow.</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d You told him quickly, correcting yourself. \u201cI meant John.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as he stood up. You didn\u2019t know what you were about to be in for, but you imagined that whatever it was was going to be something you enjoyed.</p><p>He towered over you since he was taller as you bit your lip, trying to look as innocent as you could. He placed his hands on your hips and turned you so that your back was facing him now. He bent you over so that your upper half was resting on top of the desk. You couldn\u2019t help but moan. The cool surface of the desk was causing your nipples to harden. You felt him pushing your legs apart as one of his hands rested on your lower back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d He asked as he took hold of his cock, rubbing it against your entrance.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d you moaned out lowly, enjoying the bit of teasing he was doing.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, sweetheart?\u201d He asked as he pushed himself inside of you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck\u2026</i>John!\u201d You moaned out loudly at that. \u201cIt\u2019s John Wick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he groaned out as he pulled himself out almost completely then thrusted back into you. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d You called out as your hands moved above you and grabbed onto the edge of the desk. Your cheek rested against the cool surface of the desk. \u201cJohn Wick!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed onto your hips with both hands as he began thrusting in and out of you at a steady pace. The only thing that could be heard was his grunting and moans along with your own of his name. It seemed like each time you called out his name he would move that much deeper into you. All you could do was stand on the tip of your toes and hold on for the wild ride.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight, Y/N,\u201d he moaned out through each thrust he made.</p><p>Eventually he pulled out of you and quickly turned you to face him again.

He leaned down to kiss you, which you returned. It was heated and full of passion. Your tongues moved together and explored each other\u2019s mouths. He thrusted his hips just right to where he hit your sweet spot right on.</p><p>\u201cJohn, <i>yes!\u201d </i>You screamed as you pulled back from the kiss. \u201cRight there! Feels so fucking good!\u201d</p><p>He made sure to keep hitting that spot as your nails raked down his back. They would probably leave marks, but neither one of you cared. In fact, he enjoyed it. He moaned loudly at the feel of your nails digging into his back.

You could feel it building up in the pit of your stomach.</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2026John, I\u2019m <i>so </i>close,\u201d you moaned out as your eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>You could feel his mouth move off of your breast, but his hand stayed on the other. He squeezed it with just enough pressure to make you groan in pleasure and pain.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Y/N,\u201d he grunted through each thrust he made.</p><p>You opened your eyes and looked up at him.

The only other place you could think of that he would be in was his office. You made your way there and sure enough there he stood. His back was to you as he faced the window, looking out at the scenery before him. His hands were held behind his back.</p><p>\u201cKeanu, what\u2019s going on?\u201d You asked as you leaned against the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Keanu?\u201d He asked.</p><p>He finally turned to face you and your breath hitched at the sight. Keanu was dressed in an all black suit with his hair styled and slicked back. He had also trimmed his beard. This wasn\u2019t like Keanu. He would usually dress casually on a normal day such as that one. He seemed like he was trying to look a lot like his character\u2026John Wick? Your eyebrows raised suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWho are you then?\u201d You asked, playing along with him.</p><p>\u201cMy name is John Wick,\u201d he replied smoothly.</p><p>You felt like you were going to fall out right there. That had to be your surprise. Keanu knew how much you loved his character, John Wick, since the movie night you\u2019d had together. He seemed amused about it all and even flattered. You\u2019d never told him you\u2019d had fantasies about it, however. It\u2019s like he just <i>knew. </i>You weren\u2019t complaining.</p><p>\u201cYour name is John Wick, huh?\u201d You asked him as you stepped into the room and closer to him. \u201cAnd just what are you doing here, Mr. Wick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came here because I was looking for someone,\u201d he said as you stopped a few feet from him.</p><p>\u201cDid you find this someone?\u201d You asked him.</p><p>\u201cI sure did,\u201d he replied as he looked at you in an almost intimidating manner. \u201cIn fact\u2026they\u2019re standing right in front of me.\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck\u2026</i>this<i> </i>was<i> </i>already<i> </i>so hot and it\u2019d barely even started.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d You asked, faking shock with him. \u201cWhat are you supposed to do now that you\u2019ve found me, Mr. Wick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, call me John,\u201d he told you as he stepped up closer to you. You backed away till your back hit the wall. His hands came to rest on each side of your head. \u201cSecond, I\u2019m supposed to do this.\u201d With that, he leaned down and captured your lips with his in a heated kiss.</p><p>You hummed into the kiss as your hands moved to rest on his still clothed chest. One of his hands  moved to cup your cheek as the other moved down to your hip. His body leaned into you more as he pulled your hips forward into his. You could feel that he was already hard, which made this all even better. You could feel yourself growing even wetter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my boyfriend\u2019s going to be too happy about this,\u201d you told <strike>Keanu </strike>John when he finally pulled away from the kiss, but his hips still moved against your own.</p><p>\u201cWhat he doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him will it?\u201d He asked before he picked you up in his arms and walked you over to the desk. </p><p>He placed you on the edge of the desk before he knocked everything that was on if off. It was just a bunch of papers, books, and some picture frames. Nothing too valuable. He wedged himself between your legs as you grabbed him by his tie and pulled him into you again. Your lips sought him out this time.</p><p>The kiss you shared was full of passion and a promise of what was about to come. You both fought for dominance, but he won out of course. The man had complete control over you and he knew it. You began taking his tie off, which took some work since neither one of you offered to break the kiss. </p><p>You could feel him taking his suit jacket off before his hands found the hem of your shirt. You both finally pulled away so he could pull it over your head. He let it fall to the ground before you grabbed his own shirt and ripped it open. The sound of buttons hitting the floor could be heard over the heavy breathing you both were doing. You hummed in appreciation as your hands touched his bare chest. He bit his lip as he took off the ruined shirt. He didn\u2019t seem upset about it.</p><p>You rested back on your hands to enjoy the show as he began undoing his belt. The way his fingers worked on the buckle was making you weak for some odd reason. He ripped the belt out of the loops and let it fall to the floor with a small clang.</p><p>\u201cTake off the rest of your clothes, Y/N,\u201d he said when he noticed that you were just watching him. \u201cI\u2019m here to fuck you, not play show and tell.\u201d</p><p>You bit your lip at that. He was being so dominant and demanding. You weren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s how John Wick would be, but you didn\u2019t care. You <i>loved </i>it. It suited him so well. You\u2019d take dominant John/Keanu any day. Also, Keanu knew you liked it when he was dominant. You were sure he was being this way for your enjoyment.</p><p>He moved back a bit so you hopped off of the desk and began taking off the rest of your clothes. He was doing the same till he was completely naked. His cock was hard and standing at attention. Keanu\u2019s size was <i>very</i> impressive. You licked your lips at the sight of it. You were just about to take off your panties, the only thing left on you, but his hands came to yours and stopped you.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d he said as you moved your hands.</p><p>His thumbs hooked into the waistband of your white lace panties and pulled them down. He bent down as well and helped you out of them before his hands rested on your bare hips. His face was <i>so </i>close to your pussy that you could feel his warm breath hitting it. You looked down at him anxiously as he looked back up at you. He kept eye contact with you as his toungue darted out and licked a long stripe up your slit. You gasped at the feeling and your hands found his hair, gripping onto it. Your hips bucked forward for more, but he kept a firm hold as his tongue explored more of you. He was running it up and down your slit before he found your clit, swirling his tongue around it. The feel of his beard against you was adding to the pleasure. His finger soon found your entrance then began thrusting in and out gradually before he added a second finger.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026Keanu,\u201d you moaned out, accidentally calling him the wrong name since he was being John at the moment.</p><p>He pulled back at that, which made you whine at the loss of contact. You looked down at him again and found him giving you a look that you were shocked didn\u2019t make you cum for him right then. Also, his mouth and beard was glistening a bit from your wetness.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d He asked with a raised brow.</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d You told him quickly, correcting yourself. \u201cI meant John.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as he stood up. You didn\u2019t know what you were about to be in for, but you imagined that whatever it was was going to be something you enjoyed.</p><p>He towered over you since he was taller as you bit your lip, trying to look as innocent as you could. He placed his hands on your hips and turned you so that your back was facing him now. He bent you over so that your upper half was resting on top of the desk. You couldn\u2019t help but moan. The cool surface of the desk was causing your nipples to harden. You felt him pushing your legs apart as one of his hands rested on your lower back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d He asked as he took hold of his cock, rubbing it against your entrance.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d you moaned out lowly, enjoying the bit of teasing he was doing.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, sweetheart?\u201d He asked as he pushed himself inside of you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck\u2026</i>John!\u201d You moaned out loudly at that. \u201cIt\u2019s John Wick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he groaned out as he pulled himself out almost completely then thrusted back into you. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d You called out as your hands moved above you and grabbed onto the edge of the desk. Your cheek rested against the cool surface of the desk. \u201cJohn Wick!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed onto your hips with both hands as he began thrusting in and out of you at a steady pace. The only thing that could be heard was his grunting and moans along with your own of his name. It seemed like each time you called out his name he would move that much deeper into you. All you could do was stand on the tip of your toes and hold on for the wild ride.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight, Y/N,\u201d he moaned out through each thrust he made.</p><p>Eventually he pulled out of you and quickly turned you to face him again. His eyes were blown wide and dark with lust. You were sure yours were the same. He picked you up and sat you on the edge of the desk. He grabbed his cock and entered you again as your legs wrapped around him tightly to keep him in place. His hands were back on your waist again as your own rested on his shoulders. He leaned down to kiss you, which you returned. It was heated and full of passion. Your tongues moved together and explored each other\u2019s mouths. He thrusted his hips just right to where he hit your sweet spot right on.</p><p>\u201cJohn, <i>yes!\u201d </i>You screamed as you pulled back from the kiss. \u201cRight there! Feels so fucking good!\u201d</p><p>He made sure to keep hitting that spot as your nails raked down his back. They would probably leave marks, but neither one of you cared. In fact, he enjoyed it. He moaned loudly at the feel of your nails digging into his back. He started thrusting even harder and faster into you.</p><p>He laid you back on the desk and leaned down, placing his lips around one of your nipples. His tongue darted out and licked around it as one of his hands worked on your other. Your hands found his hair and gripped onto it, not too tightly of course. All of the pleasure being given to you was making you feel close to your orgasm. You could feel it building up in the pit of your stomach.</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2026John, I\u2019m <i>so </i>close,\u201d you moaned out as your eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>You could feel his mouth move off of your breast, but his hand stayed on the other. He squeezed it with just enough pressure to make you groan in pleasure and pain.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Y/N,\u201d he grunted through each thrust he made.</p><p>You opened your eyes and looked up at him. He was looking right back at you, right in the eyes, which made this even more intimate. His free hand moved down and you soon felt his thumb rubbing your clit, which made you moan even louder than you had been. Your hands reached back above your head to hold on to the edge of the desk again.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d he said in that husky voice of his. \u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t have to be told twice. A couple of thrusts and swirls of the thumb to your clit made you hit your high. Your back arched off of the desk as your orgasm hit you hard. You called out his name as you clenched around his cock and your hands tightened their hold on the desk.</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck,\u201d </i>he groaned out as he moved his hands to your hips. </p><p>His thrusts became sloppy before he finally came into you hard. He moaned as he rode out both of your highs lazily then he stopped. You were both panting messes. He leaned down above you, resting his hands against the desk to keep himself up. You moved your hands from the desk and instead reached up to move the fallen hair from his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere did <i>that </i>come from?\u201d You finally asked him. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thought we could try something new,\u201d Keanu replied with a small grin. \u201cSo I take it you liked it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah!\u201d You exclaimed, which made him chuckle. \u201cI like it when it\u2019s just you too, but that was different.\u201d</p><p>Keanu leaned down to peck your lips before he pulled himself up and pulled out of you. You winced at the empty feeling as you sat yourself up. You were an absolute mess.</p><p>\u201cI think we could use a shower, sweetheart,\u201d Keanu commented and you nodded in agreement.</p><p>He helped you off of the desk as you walked hand in hand into his bedroom and to the master bathroom.</p><p>\u201cSo how about I get some time with Keanu tonight?\u201d You asked as he turned the shower on.</p><p>\u201cYou can count on it, baby,\u201d he told you with a smirk as he pulled you into the shower with him.</p></p>",

Of course that peaked your curiousity. He knew how you felt about surprises. You loathed them because you were always so impatient to find out what the surprise was. He knew you would be rushing to get there and find out what was going on.</p><p>That&rsquo;s exactly what you did too.</p><p>You drove yourself to his place. You were thankful that the traffic in New York wasn&rsquo;t any worse than it was. It was just at the right time in the evening for everything to be moving smoothly.</p><p>When you pulled up to his gate, you typed in the code that opened it and drove yourself in. You parked your car at the front and got out then walked up to his door. You rang the doorbell and stood there, but he never came to the door. You rang it a couple of more times before you dug the key out he had given you just last week. He told you to use it anytime and this seemed like a perfect opportunity. You and Keanu were getting pretty serious.</p><p>You unlocked the door and walked in before shutting it behind you. You looked around and didn&rsquo;t see your boyfriend anywhere.</p><p>&ldquo;Keanu, I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; You called out as you put your purse down by the door and started taking your coat off.</p><p>There was still no signs of Keanu as you kicked your boots off. What was going on? Keanu called you to come over for a surprise and he was nowhere to be seen. You checked the living room and kitchen for him, but there was no sign of him. He wasn&rsquo;t in the backyard either from what you could see through the patio doors.</p><p>&ldquo;Keanu, where are you?!&rdquo; You called out as you started going up the stairs to try searching for him there.</p><p>All you could do was hope he wouldn&rsquo;t jump out from somewhere and scare you. He knew how jumpy you were. He&rsquo;d sneak up on you and scare you without meaning to a lot. He was just too quiet.</p><p>You came to his bedroom first and didn&rsquo;t see him anywhere in there.
