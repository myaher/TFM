I see you wanted that little sexy bit (which isn&rsquo;t as juicy on Z, just a rehash). I also will throw in the bit about Hiddleston, too, because maybe that&rsquo;s why someone thinks B is gay - they have him mixed up with Hiddles!</p><p>I want to add that at the Doctor Strange location shooting, on the street of NYC, that was basically why Marvel couldn&rsquo;t stop her. She was out in public with perfect strangers watching. She knew that. Now, on the closed set of Sherlock, Gatiss had more control. She could scream in front of the crew, and it didn&rsquo;t really matter. The public couldn&rsquo;t see her. He could kick her out.</p><p>Also - I do distinctly remember there were pap photos of Benedict with one of the women this industry person saw him with. She was at the location shooting in NYC and was mistaken as the &ldquo;wife&rdquo; by the paps! Why? Because B kissed her!!! Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t really see them kissing full on, or really see how close they were standing together from the angle of the photos, plus the photos were pulled from pap sites along with the full photo of her leaving the location shooting. But I remember seeing them and thinking, &ldquo;Hoo!

I see you wanted that little sexy bit (which isn\u2019t as juicy on Z, just a rehash). I also will throw in the bit about Hiddleston, too, because maybe that\u2019s why someone thinks B is gay - they have him mixed up with Hiddles!</p><p>I want to add that at the Doctor Strange location shooting, on the street of NYC, that was basically why Marvel couldn\u2019t stop her. She was out in public with perfect strangers watching. She knew that. Now, on the closed set of Sherlock, Gatiss had more control. She could scream in front of the crew, and it didn\u2019t really matter. The public couldn\u2019t see her. He could kick her out.</p><p>Also - I do distinctly remember there were pap photos of Benedict with one of the women this industry person saw him with. She was at the location shooting in NYC and was mistaken as the \u201cwife\u201d by the paps! Why? Because B kissed her!!! Unfortunately, you can\u2019t really see them kissing full on, or really see how close they were standing together from the angle of the photos, plus the photos were pulled from pap sites along with the full photo of her leaving the location shooting.

I see you wanted that little sexy bit (which isn\u2019t as juicy on Z, just a rehash).

She was out in public with perfect strangers watching. She knew that. Now, on the closed set of Sherlock, Gatiss had more control. She could scream in front of the crew, and it didn\u2019t really matter. The public couldn\u2019t see her. He could kick her out.</p><p>Also - I do distinctly remember there were pap photos of Benedict with one of the women this industry person saw him with. She was at the location shooting in NYC and was mistaken as the \u201cwife\u201d by the paps! Why? Because B kissed her!!! Unfortunately, you can\u2019t really see them kissing full on, or really see how close they were standing together from the angle of the photos, plus the photos were pulled from pap sites along with the full photo of her leaving the location shooting. But I remember seeing them and thinking, \u201cHoo!

This last one also confirms what you said about his addiction back in the day.</p><p>This next one is a little antidote I hadn&rsquo;t heard before. Reveals more of how vile she is to be around, so it gives you some indication of what he has to put up with when he&rsquo;s alone with her. *shudder*</p><p>Bonus: teeth sucking!</p><p>[quote]</p><p>Cumberbach is so NOT attractive at ALL</p><p>posted January 7th, 2017 at 10:48pm</p><p>agreed 1-7-2017 10:48pm</p><p>well that depends. 1-7-2017 10:48pm</p><p>i know him.

I just wish some of the outlets had picked up on this behavior 1-7-2017 10:59pm</p><p>i guess they keep her out of the pub eye as much as possible. she goes to a few events because she would pitch a fit if she is not in front of some camera, but she would be a liability if she was seen w him a lot. she is a total mess. ive socialised w them a number of times and i think there is something wrong w her 1-7-2017 11:00pm</p><p>Think she self-medicates? 1-7-2017 11:03pm</p><p>no clue. i couldn&rsquo;t speak to specifics, but she lies compulsively. everything from how she got to x event, to bigger lies about being places she wasn&rsquo;t, working w people she hasn&rsquo;t, having jobs that literally don&rsquo;t exist. and she is volatile and yells at him like no one is watching. it sucks because he is quite funny and sweet, and i have a godchild who goes to school in the UK and we used to chat about that, but when she is there no one can have a normal conversation. she won&rsquo;t allow it 1-7-2017 11:05pm</p><p>Good lord. How long do you think that marriage will last? He needs to get a backbone 1-7-2017 11:06pm</p><p>no idea. rumour is it neither of these children are his. i dont know about that. last time i was at an event w them, and we were all talking w about 4 other people there (besides me, him, and her) i literally saw her roll her eyes, stamp her feet, and suck her teeth because the conversation was not about her. a co worker said its like having a toddler there. she just demands attention, and has no idea about the fact that she is demanding it of total strangers. its very, very bizarre. 1-7-2017 11:08pm</p><p>^ive personally caught her in lies which were just bizarre, and i caught her because i knew the people supposedly involved in her weird lie, and it was totally impossible. i think she has a problem 1-7-2017 10:52pm</p><p>[/quote]</p><p>That&rsquo;s basically it from the site. So far, although nobody&rsquo;s seen a REAL kid (remember the industry person said they knew the pap arrangement for photographing them with a kid, but the kid NEVER was on set), everybody&rsquo;s been told that there IS one (or two or three) and that somebody else is the daddy.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think any of these people actually saw Zero preggers, though. I wonder what would happen if they actually saw her up close and personal and realized the bump wasn&rsquo;t real? C'mon, industry people! She&rsquo;s out there right now in her bright yellow tent at industry events! Give up the deets!</p></p>",
