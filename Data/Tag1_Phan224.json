(Again.)</p></blockquote><p>[<b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16641822\">read on ao3</a></b>]</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Dan says, voice gritty with sleep. His hand slaps out and catches Phil on the chest, just over his nipple. He pats it a couple times, clearly not yet entirely of the waking world, and then sighs. &ldquo;Shh.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making any sounds,&rdquo; Phil whispers. &ldquo;How can I shh.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re. Stop.&rdquo; Dan shoves his face into the pillow. he doesn&rsquo;t move his hand, fingers splayed out resting against the dusting of hair on Phil&rsquo;s chest, right over his heartbeat.  &ldquo;Your head&rsquo;s loud. Be quiet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Go back to sleep.&rdquo; Phil doesn&rsquo;t have to listen long to realize that&rsquo;s exactly what Dan has done. </p><p>But he can&rsquo;t. He tries to take Dan&rsquo;s advice and quiet his head, but the little hamster on the wheel in the back of his mind is running so fast it feels like sparks are flying against his skull. </p><p>He shuts his eyes and turns over. Dan&rsquo;s hand is dislodged, but Dan doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind or even notice. </p><p>Sleep, Phil thinks. </p><p>Sleep. </p><p>He can do this. </p><p>He can sleep. </p><p>There&rsquo;s a sliver of city light coming in from under the window shade. It flickers sometimes. He starts to wonder what it might be. Ghosts? Birds flying by? Just a faulty light? Who fixes the street lights when the bulbs burn out? He&rsquo;s never seen that before. Maybe there are pictures on the internet&hellip;. </p><p>Sleep! </p><p>He shuts his eyes quickly and imagines a window slamming shut. Then he&rsquo;s picturing eyelids that look like windows, white wooden frames and glass with eyeballs behind them. He thinks about how they&rsquo;d need window blinds and would they have the twisty little sticks you turn to shut them? </p><p>Eye blinds. </p><p>He rolls over onto his stomach. He&rsquo;s facing Dan again. His limbs are starting to tingle in a weird way, but it&rsquo;s not a good feeling. It&rsquo;s restless but he&rsquo;s so tired and just - so tired. All the cells in his body want to be asleep right now, but the hamster won&rsquo;t stop running. </p><p>He should give it a name. </p><p>Maybe then it would stop. It has to be tired now. His mind has been spinning spinning spinning since Saturday morning, since he started contemplating his own death on the floor of a bathroom he hates. Since he sat inside a big white machine and tried not to move for an hour. Since he saw the panic on Dan&rsquo;s face just before Dan could mask it. </p><p>His stomach does a funny little twist. He feels like he hasn&rsquo;t had a proper sleep in approximately seventeen years.  </p><p>He turns onto his back, almost full circle from how he&rsquo;d started. He&rsquo;d hoped maybe it was just the way he was laying, but his stomach still feels strange and sloshy. </p><p>The sun will probably be coming up soon. How does the hamster have so much energy? There&rsquo;s an achy feeling behind Phil&rsquo;s eyes. He reaches up with both hands balled into fists and rubs fiercely at them. He won&rsquo;t be wearing his contacts for today, that&rsquo;s for sure. His mouth is dry and his eyes are dry and his stomach feels properly sour now and he can even feel a cold sweat breaking out on his forehead and the back of his neck. Suddenly the duvet feels oppressive even though he&rsquo;s got it pushed down to below his nipples.</p><p>It&rsquo;s urgent that he throw it off and sit up. He&rsquo;s practically gasping when he does, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. The floor is cool against his feet, and the sensation grounds him nicely. </p><p>He knows with mixed resignation and resentment that he can&rsquo;t just get back into bed, though. He doesn&rsquo;t feel nearly as shit as the last time he was up before the sun - he won&rsquo;t be passing out again, thank you very much. But all the same, the hamster wins again. </p><p>*</p><p>He lies on the couch upstairs for almost an hour before he hears Dan&rsquo;s heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. </p><p>Normally he&rsquo;d expect something more along the lines of <i>what the fuck are you doing</i> in that accusatory voice, because Dan is nothing if not put out when he&rsquo;s denied his morning cuddles. </p><p>It&rsquo;s not morning yet, though. It&rsquo;s not even five am, and Dan doesn&rsquo;t sound irate at all. He sounds worried when he asks, &ldquo;Are you okay? Did you - did something happen? Why didn&rsquo;t you call me-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Phil says, and that&rsquo;s immediately a lie. He thinks of Dan&rsquo;s worried face the weekend before, that first day after - he pictures Dan on his knees scrubbing the bath tub, Dan watching him sleep. He thinks of how sometimes he&rsquo;s too stubborn for his own good and doesn&rsquo;t let Dan in and he knows Dan takes his own cues from that, he knows Dan needs a little coaxing sometimes.<br/></p><p>When he feeling back up to snuff he&rsquo;ll really have to focus on working out Dan&rsquo;s trauma with what happened. </p><p>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo; Dan doesn&rsquo;t sound reassured.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know why this is hitting him so hard right now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fine. I think. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do we need to go back to hospital?&rdquo; Dan asks. </p><p>It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise Phil that Dan&rsquo;s mind goes to the worst place first. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Phil says immediately. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that. I just - I think it&rsquo;s the tablets. I just feel crap.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Dan says softly. It&rsquo;s so early and it&rsquo;s so quiet. Phil shuts his eyes. Even Dan&rsquo;s footsteps across the room are quiet now. The world seems calm and all the frantic feelings are just on the inside. &ldquo;Toast?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil almost smiles. &ldquo;Maybe tea instead.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>Dan makes tea. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t make tea often. Neither of them drink it all that much, to the shame of their forefathers. </p><p>But they are still British at the end of the day and when someone&rsquo;s feeling poorly, tea feels like a comfort and a cure. </p><p>He perches on the arm of the couch while Phil sits up to drink. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your stomach?&rdquo; He asks, reaching out to push Phil&rsquo;s soft, product-free hair back up off his forehead. &ldquo;You had your hand on it when I walked in.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil hadn&rsquo;t even realized. </p><p>&ldquo;Sort of,&rdquo; he says. He takes another sip. It&rsquo;s still slightly too hot, but he&rsquo;s always had a problem with patience. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to sick or anything. I just feel strange. Like pins and needles all over, and my stomach feels queasy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo; Dan sounds fond, and amused. &ldquo;Do you feel hyperactive, by any chance?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; It had seemed so funny as a joke on the internet, but now he&rsquo;s not sure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. If I am, then it&rsquo;s not fair. I think if I did try to get up and move around I might actually sick.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay first of all, please don&rsquo;t. Second of all, ugh.&rdquo; The last bit has a sympathetic twist to it. The sympathy is nice. So is Dan&rsquo;s hand in his hair, so he leans into that. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I will,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like - the same way I feel when I&rsquo;m carsick at the very start.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Please tell me your body hasn&rsquo;t adapted to give you motion sickness just from laying down,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Or I&rsquo;m going to have to seriously ask kind of genetic fuckery happened in the Lester bloodline?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My grandparents were first cousins.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s only after he speaks that Phil realizes that probably wasn&rsquo;t a helpful response. &ldquo;Can we watch some television?&rdquo; </p><p>It feels too strange to be awake when the rest of the world isn&rsquo;t yet. It puts too many thoughts in his head, and Phil&rsquo;s never been one to linger in existential discomfort. He&rsquo;d much prefer to just watch anime with his head in Dan&rsquo;s lap. </p><p>* </p><p>The peace only lasts for about twenty minutes. </p><p>His heart is doing a weird racing thing, like the hamster has decided to relocate. </p><p>Phil grins a bit at the mental image of a hamster hooked up to all the valves and tubes of his heart. &ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he whispers. </p><p>He just wants to share, but when he looks up he sees Dan&rsquo;s head lolled back against the couch. His eyes are shut and his mouth is open, a touch of dampness glistening at the corner of his lips. </p><p>He&rsquo;ll be snoring in a few more minutes. Phil knows all the little quirks and patterns of Dan, and he takes as much pride in knowing them as someone else would casually grabbing their partners hand as they walked down the street. They&rsquo;ve developed their own displays of affection, often found embedded in assertions of knowledge. </p><p>He knows other things Dan likes, too. He leans in and breathes hot against the soft bulge of Dan&rsquo;s dick in his underwear. His heart is racing in a more familiar way now, and it&rsquo;s soothing to channel the nervous energy.  </p><p>Does he feel up for this? Maybe. Maybe not. </p><p>Guess he&rsquo;ll just find out. </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck are you doing?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice is sleepy but urgent. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s impressed with how long he actually stayed asleep. He&rsquo;s got Dan&rsquo;s pants tugged down and his dick pulled out, resting against Phil&rsquo;s tongue where he&rsquo;s been sucking lightly at it for almost fifteen minutes now. </p><p>He likes when Dan&rsquo;s hand cups the back of his head. He likes it even more when Dan groans. </p><p>&ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;What the fuck.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s blunt in the good way. </p><p>Phil pulls off. &ldquo;Blowing you.&rdquo;</p><p>His voice isn&rsquo;t raspy at all, he hasn&rsquo;t had Dan that far in his mouth and he hasn&rsquo;t wanted to do anything that would even come close to making him cough. It&rsquo;s all been safe and soft and slow and quiet and brilliantly hot. </p><p>&ldquo;No shit, Sherlock,&rdquo; Dan says. His thighs are tense now. He&rsquo;s gone from a bit hard to very hard and Phil strokes the spit-damp skin with the hand he&rsquo;s not laying on. &ldquo;Why, though?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because I like it.&rdquo; Phil kisses just under the head, flicking his tongue over that spot that feels so good. &ldquo;Can I make you come?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Can you&hellip;&rdquo; Dan mutters and glares a glare that lacks any real impact at all. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not having sex.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sex can have many definitions,&rdquo; Phil says. He&rsquo;s being a prat; it&rsquo;s something Dan likes to point out to break Phil of his habit of thinking that if it&rsquo;s not penetration it doesn&rsquo;t count. </p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>&ldquo;But I want to suck you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I refuse to tell your mum you fainted again with my penis in your mouth.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to faint.&rdquo; Phil puts and then places a soft kiss on the tip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m poorly, you&rsquo;re supposed to give me what I want.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I hate you.&rdquo; Dan tugs his hair a bit. &ldquo;Shut up and suck.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil does so happily, eyes dropping shot. He can feel Dan&rsquo;s hand on himself, Dan working his own dick over with a total lack of patience while Phil focuses on the first couple of inches. </p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take him long. He&rsquo;s always worked up when he wakes up hard, always impatient to come. Phil isn&rsquo;t sure if he really wants to swallow but the idea of moving seems like too much effort and he likes the feeling if not the taste, he likes the satisfaction of swallowing Dan down. </p><p>&ldquo;My turn,&rdquo; Phil says, feeling properly antsy as soon as he feels the last pulse against his tongue. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t play fair. </p><p>Phil does get his turn, but only after Dan&rsquo;s forced him to drink a whole glass of water and then lay back down on the sofa. </p><p>He suspects the motives are not entirely selfless; Dan directs him so that Phil&rsquo;s back is against his chest. Phil knows Dan likes it like this because he wants to be able to have his arms around Phil and feel Phil breathing. </p><p>Really. They&rsquo;re gonna have that conversation. If Dan&rsquo;s therapist has secondhand taught him anything, it&rsquo;s that talking actually does help. </p><p>Sometimes. </p><p>Dan wanking him helps sometimes too, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening now; Dan&rsquo;s hand with a dry touch around Phil&rsquo;s cock, tugging him back to hardness. He&rsquo;s not all the way there yet but he loves the soft blank place sex (sex like this, sex the other way, sex any way they want to imagine it) takes him to. </p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t fucking believe you,&rdquo; Dan says, pressing a kiss to the side of Phil&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;First it&rsquo;s toast, now it&rsquo;s a handjob. What&rsquo;ll it be next time you feel poorly? I have to rim you on a fine feather bed with satin sheets I love myself?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re offering.&rdquo; Phil smiles. He loves Dan&rsquo;s melodrama. He loves Dan. </p><p>He loves that he&rsquo;s got someone to take care of him. </p><p>He also love that thing Dan just did with his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he breathes, sliding his fingers down Dan&rsquo;s arm to loosely hold his wrist. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to ask.&rdquo; Dan is nosing at him still, dotting kissing here and there along his hairline and his temple. Phil stretches up and turns his neck, wanting one for his mouth. </p><p>Dan gives it to him. His fingers tighten and squeeze, hold, teasing Phil before he starts to move them again. </p><p>It&rsquo;s just so fucking - nice. He wants to come but he also craves this most when he&rsquo;s feeling off. He can&rsquo;t actually crawl inside Dan&rsquo;s skin but he can do the real-world next best thing of having Dan surround and dominate him, a human security blanket that gripes and grumbles and that Phil never, ever has to question really cares. </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hand strokes down from Phil&rsquo;s collarbones to the where his public hair starts in one smooth motion, fingertips scratching over the coarse hairs there before he drags them right back up to rest over Phil&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Still with me, old man?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s lost track of how many minutes it&rsquo;s been. He nods and swallows. His mouth is dry again; probably best not to say that to Dan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna come,&rdquo; he says, panting out the words. It still takes another handful of strokes after that but Dan is purpose driven now. </p><p>He spills a puddle of white against his own stomach, a satisfying burst of pleasure that ebbs too quickly but in a still pleasant way. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Dan asks. He sounds a little breathless himself, though he&rsquo;s not hard again. </p><p>Phil takes stock so he can give a proper answer. His heart is racing but it&rsquo;s a just-right feeling and his mind is quiet. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>They crawl back into bed well after the sun has risen. </p><p>&ldquo;You need to set an alarm,&rdquo; Phil says. </p><p>&ldquo;I will. But on your phone, and it&rsquo;s staying on my side of the bed.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice is firm. </p><p>Relationships are about the art of compromise, and Phil&rsquo;s too tired to argue anyway. He hands over his phone and watches Dan set the alarm. </p><p>&ldquo;When for?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Noon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil huffs. &ldquo;Eleven.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;This is not a negotiation,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Also, you&rsquo;re not filming today.&rdquo; </p><p>The beginnings of a genuinely put out feeling start to stir, but Phil&rsquo;s not ready to deal with that so he shoves it back down and buries it. &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he says. </p><p>He&rsquo;ll argue Dan once they wake up. </p><p>For now, the hamster is quiet and he\u2019s going to sleep.</p>",

So is Dan\u2019s hand in his hair, so he leans into that. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I will,\u201d Phil says. \u201cIt\u2019s like - the same way I feel when I\u2019m carsick at the very start.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease tell me your body hasn\u2019t adapted to give you motion sickness just from laying down,\u201d Dan says. \u201cOr I\u2019m going to have to seriously ask kind of genetic fuckery happened in the Lester bloodline?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy grandparents were first cousins.\u201d It\u2019s only after he speaks that Phil realizes that probably wasn\u2019t a helpful response. \u201cCan we watch some television?\u201d </p><p>It feels too strange to be awake when the rest of the world isn\u2019t yet. It puts too many thoughts in his head, and Phil\u2019s never been one to linger in existential discomfort. He\u2019d much prefer to just watch anime with his head in Dan\u2019s lap. </p><p>* </p><p>The peace only lasts for about twenty minutes. </p><p>His heart is doing a weird racing thing, like the hamster has decided to relocate. </p><p>Phil grins a bit at the mental image of a hamster hooked up to all the valves and tubes of his heart. \u201cDan,\u201d he whispers. </p><p>He just wants to share, but when he looks up he sees Dan\u2019s head lolled back against the couch. His eyes are shut and his mouth is open, a touch of dampness glistening at the corner of his lips. </p><p>He\u2019ll be snoring in a few more minutes. Phil knows all the little quirks and patterns of Dan, and he takes as much pride in knowing them as someone else would casually grabbing their partners hand as they walked down the street. They\u2019ve developed their own displays of affection, often found embedded in assertions of knowledge. </p><p>He knows other things Dan likes, too. He leans in and breathes hot against the soft bulge of Dan\u2019s dick in his underwear. His heart is racing in a more familiar way now, and it\u2019s soothing to channel the nervous energy.  </p><p>Does he feel up for this? Maybe. Maybe not. </p><p>Guess he\u2019ll just find out. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is sleepy but urgent. </p><p>Phil\u2019s impressed with how long he actually stayed asleep. He\u2019s got Dan\u2019s pants tugged down and his dick pulled out, resting against Phil\u2019s tongue where he\u2019s been sucking lightly at it for almost fifteen minutes now. </p><p>He likes when Dan\u2019s hand cups the back of his head. He likes it even more when Dan groans. </p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Dan says. \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s blunt in the good way. </p><p>Phil pulls off. \u201cBlowing you.\u201d</p><p>His voice isn\u2019t raspy at all, he hasn\u2019t had Dan that far in his mouth and he hasn\u2019t wanted to do anything that would even come close to making him cough. It\u2019s all been safe and soft and slow and quiet and brilliantly hot. </p><p>\u201cNo shit, Sherlock,\u201d Dan says. His thighs are tense now. He\u2019s gone from a bit hard to very hard and Phil strokes the spit-damp skin with the hand he\u2019s not laying on. \u201cWhy, though?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I like it.\u201d Phil kisses just under the head, flicking his tongue over that spot that feels so good. \u201cCan I make you come?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan you\u2026\u201d Dan mutters and glares a glare that lacks any real impact at all. \u201cWe\u2019re not having sex.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSex can have many definitions,\u201d Phil says. He\u2019s being a prat; it\u2019s something Dan likes to point out to break Phil of his habit of thinking that if it\u2019s not penetration it doesn\u2019t count. </p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>\u201cBut I want to suck you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI refuse to tell your mum you fainted again with my penis in your mouth.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to faint.\u201d Phil puts and then places a soft kiss on the tip. \u201cI\u2019m poorly, you\u2019re supposed to give me what I want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d Dan tugs his hair a bit. \u201cShut up and suck.\u201d </p><p>Phil does so happily, eyes dropping shot. He can feel Dan\u2019s hand on himself, Dan working his own dick over with a total lack of patience while Phil focuses on the first couple of inches. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t take him long. He\u2019s always worked up when he wakes up hard, always impatient to come. Phil isn\u2019t sure if he really wants to swallow but the idea of moving seems like too much effort and he likes the feeling if not the taste, he likes the satisfaction of swallowing Dan down. </p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Phil says, feeling properly antsy as soon as he feels the last pulse against his tongue. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t play fair. </p><p>Phil does get his turn, but only after Dan\u2019s forced him to drink a whole glass of water and then lay back down on the sofa. </p><p>He suspects the motives are not entirely selfless; Dan directs him so that Phil\u2019s back is against his chest. Phil knows Dan likes it like this because he wants to be able to have his arms around Phil and feel Phil breathing. </p><p>Really. They\u2019re gonna have that conversation. If Dan\u2019s therapist has secondhand taught him anything, it\u2019s that talking actually does help. </p><p>Sometimes. </p><p>Dan wanking him helps sometimes too, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now; Dan\u2019s hand with a dry touch around Phil\u2019s cock, tugging him back to hardness. He\u2019s not all the way there yet but he loves the soft blank place sex (sex like this, sex the other way, sex any way they want to imagine it) takes him to. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t fucking believe you,\u201d Dan says, pressing a kiss to the side of Phil\u2019s head. \u201cFirst it\u2019s toast, now it\u2019s a handjob. What\u2019ll it be next time you feel poorly? I have to rim you on a fine feather bed with satin sheets I love myself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re offering.\u201d Phil smiles. He loves Dan\u2019s melodrama. He loves Dan. </p><p>He loves that he\u2019s got someone to take care of him. </p><p>He also love that thing Dan just did with his hand. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes, sliding his fingers down Dan\u2019s arm to loosely hold his wrist. \u201cPlease.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask.\u201d Dan is nosing at him still, dotting kissing here and there along his hairline and his temple. Phil stretches up and turns his neck, wanting one for his mouth. </p><p>Dan gives it to him. His fingers tighten and squeeze, hold, teasing Phil before he starts to move them again. </p><p>It\u2019s just so fucking - nice. He wants to come but he also craves this most when he\u2019s feeling off. He can\u2019t actually crawl inside Dan\u2019s skin but he can do the real-world next best thing of having Dan surround and dominate him, a human security blanket that gripes and grumbles and that Phil never, ever has to question really cares. </p><p>Dan\u2019s hand strokes down from Phil\u2019s collarbones to the where his public hair starts in one smooth motion, fingertips scratching over the coarse hairs there before he drags them right back up to rest over Phil\u2019s hair. \u201cStill with me, old man?\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s lost track of how many minutes it\u2019s been. He nods and swallows. His mouth is dry again; probably best not to say that to Dan. \u201cI\u2019m gonna come,\u201d he says, panting out the words. It still takes another handful of strokes after that but Dan is purpose driven now. </p><p>He spills a puddle of white against his own stomach, a satisfying burst of pleasure that ebbs too quickly but in a still pleasant way. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asks. He sounds a little breathless himself, though he\u2019s not hard again. </p><p>Phil takes stock so he can give a proper answer. His heart is racing but it\u2019s a just-right feeling and his mind is quiet. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>They crawl back into bed well after the sun has risen. </p><p>\u201cYou need to set an alarm,\u201d Phil says. </p><p>\u201cI will. But on your phone, and it\u2019s staying on my side of the bed.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is firm. </p><p>Relationships are about the art of compromise, and Phil\u2019s too tired to argue anyway. He hands over his phone and watches Dan set the alarm. </p><p>\u201cWhen for?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNoon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d </p><p>Phil huffs. \u201cEleven.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is not a negotiation,\u201d Dan says. \u201cAlso, you\u2019re not filming today.\u201d </p><p>The beginnings of a genuinely put out feeling start to stir, but Phil\u2019s not ready to deal with that so he shoves it back down and buries it. \u201cFine,\u201d he says. </p><p>He\u2019ll argue Dan once they wake up. </p><p>For now, the hamster is quiet and he\u2019s going to sleep.</p>",

(Again.)</p></blockquote><p>[<b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16641822\">read on ao3</a></b>]</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Dan says, voice gritty with sleep. His hand slaps out and catches Phil on the chest, just over his nipple. He pats it a couple times, clearly not yet entirely of the waking world, and then sighs. \u201cShh.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any sounds,\u201d Phil whispers. \u201cHow can I shh.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re. Stop.\u201d Dan shoves his face into the pillow. he doesn\u2019t move his hand, fingers splayed out resting against the dusting of hair on Phil\u2019s chest, right over his heartbeat.  \u201cYour head\u2019s loud. Be quiet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d Phil doesn\u2019t have to listen long to realize that\u2019s exactly what Dan has done. </p><p>But he can\u2019t. He tries to take Dan\u2019s advice and quiet his head, but the little hamster on the wheel in the back of his mind is running so fast it feels like sparks are flying against his skull. </p><p>He shuts his eyes and turns over. Dan\u2019s hand is dislodged, but Dan doesn\u2019t seem to mind or even notice. </p><p>Sleep, Phil thinks. </p><p>Sleep. </p><p>He can do this. </p><p>He can sleep. </p><p>There\u2019s a sliver of city light coming in from under the window shade. It flickers sometimes. He starts to wonder what it might be. Ghosts? Birds flying by? Just a faulty light? Who fixes the street lights when the bulbs burn out? He\u2019s never seen that before. Maybe there are pictures on the internet\u2026. </p><p>Sleep! </p><p>He shuts his eyes quickly and imagines a window slamming shut. Then he\u2019s picturing eyelids that look like windows, white wooden frames and glass with eyeballs behind them. He thinks about how they\u2019d need window blinds and would they have the twisty little sticks you turn to shut them? </p><p>Eye blinds. </p><p>He rolls over onto his stomach. He\u2019s facing Dan again. His limbs are starting to tingle in a weird way, but it\u2019s not a good feeling. It\u2019s restless but he\u2019s so tired and just - so tired. All the cells in his body want to be asleep right now, but the hamster won\u2019t stop running. </p><p>He should give it a name. </p><p>Maybe then it would stop. It has to be tired now. His mind has been spinning spinning spinning since Saturday morning, since he started contemplating his own death on the floor of a bathroom he hates. Since he sat inside a big white machine and tried not to move for an hour. Since he saw the panic on Dan\u2019s face just before Dan could mask it. </p><p>His stomach does a funny little twist. He feels like he hasn\u2019t had a proper sleep in approximately seventeen years.  </p><p>He turns onto his back, almost full circle from how he\u2019d started. He\u2019d hoped maybe it was just the way he was laying, but his stomach still feels strange and sloshy. </p><p>The sun will probably be coming up soon. How does the hamster have so much energy? There\u2019s an achy feeling behind Phil\u2019s eyes. He reaches up with both hands balled into fists and rubs fiercely at them. He won\u2019t be wearing his contacts for today, that\u2019s for sure. His mouth is dry and his eyes are dry and his stomach feels properly sour now and he can even feel a cold sweat breaking out on his forehead and the back of his neck. Suddenly the duvet feels oppressive even though he\u2019s got it pushed down to below his nipples.</p><p>It\u2019s urgent that he throw it off and sit up. He\u2019s practically gasping when he does, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. The floor is cool against his feet, and the sensation grounds him nicely. </p><p>He knows with mixed resignation and resentment that he can\u2019t just get back into bed, though. He doesn\u2019t feel nearly as shit as the last time he was up before the sun - he won\u2019t be passing out again, thank you very much. But all the same, the hamster wins again. </p><p>*</p><p>He lies on the couch upstairs for almost an hour before he hears Dan\u2019s heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. </p><p>Normally he\u2019d expect something more along the lines of <i>what the fuck are you doing</i> in that accusatory voice, because Dan is nothing if not put out when he\u2019s denied his morning cuddles. </p><p>It\u2019s not morning yet, though. It\u2019s not even five am, and Dan doesn\u2019t sound irate at all. He sounds worried when he asks, \u201cAre you okay? Did you - did something happen? Why didn\u2019t you call me-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Phil says, and that\u2019s immediately a lie. He thinks of Dan\u2019s worried face the weekend before, that first day after - he pictures Dan on his knees scrubbing the bath tub, Dan watching him sleep. He thinks of how sometimes he\u2019s too stubborn for his own good and doesn\u2019t let Dan in and he knows Dan takes his own cues from that, he knows Dan needs a little coaxing sometimes.<br></p><p>When he feeling back up to snuff he\u2019ll really have to focus on working out Dan\u2019s trauma with what happened. </p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d Dan doesn\u2019t sound reassured.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know why this is hitting him so hard right now. \u201cI\u2019m not fine. I think. I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo we need to go back to hospital?\u201d Dan asks. </p><p>It shouldn\u2019t surprise Phil that Dan\u2019s mind goes to the worst place first. \u201cNo,\u201d Phil says immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I just - I think it\u2019s the tablets. I just feel crap.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan says softly. It\u2019s so early and it\u2019s so quiet. Phil shuts his eyes. Even Dan\u2019s footsteps across the room are quiet now. The world seems calm and all the frantic feelings are just on the inside. \u201cToast?\u201d </p><p>Phil almost smiles. \u201cMaybe tea instead.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Dan makes tea. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t make tea often. Neither of them drink it all that much, to the shame of their forefathers. </p><p>But they are still British at the end of the day and when someone\u2019s feeling poorly, tea feels like a comfort and a cure. </p><p>He perches on the arm of the couch while Phil sits up to drink. \u201cIt\u2019s your stomach?\u201d He asks, reaching out to push Phil\u2019s soft, product-free hair back up off his forehead. \u201cYou had your hand on it when I walked in.\u201d </p><p>Phil hadn\u2019t even realized. </p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d he says. He takes another sip. It\u2019s still slightly too hot, but he\u2019s always had a problem with patience. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to sick or anything. I just feel strange. Like pins and needles all over, and my stomach feels queasy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d Dan sounds fond, and amused. \u201cDo you feel hyperactive, by any chance?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d It had seemed so funny as a joke on the internet, but now he\u2019s not sure. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If I am, then it\u2019s not fair. I think if I did try to get up and move around I might actually sick.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay first of all, please don\u2019t. Second of all, ugh.\u201d The last bit has a sympathetic twist to it. The sympathy is nice. So is Dan\u2019s hand in his hair, so he leans into that. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I will,\u201d Phil says. \u201cIt\u2019s like - the same way I feel when I\u2019m carsick at the very start.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease tell me your body hasn\u2019t adapted to give you motion sickness just from laying down,\u201d Dan says. \u201cOr I\u2019m going to have to seriously ask kind of genetic fuckery happened in the Lester bloodline?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy grandparents were first cousins.\u201d It\u2019s only after he speaks that Phil realizes that probably wasn\u2019t a helpful response. \u201cCan we watch some television?\u201d </p><p>It feels too strange to be awake when the rest of the world isn\u2019t yet. It puts too many thoughts in his head, and Phil\u2019s never been one to linger in existential discomfort. He\u2019d much prefer to just watch anime with his head in Dan\u2019s lap. </p><p>* </p><p>The peace only lasts for about twenty minutes. </p><p>His heart is doing a weird racing thing, like the hamster has decided to relocate. </p><p>Phil grins a bit at the mental image of a hamster hooked up to all the valves and tubes of his heart. \u201cDan,\u201d he whispers. </p><p>He just wants to share, but when he looks up he sees Dan\u2019s head lolled back against the couch. His eyes are shut and his mouth is open, a touch of dampness glistening at the corner of his lips. </p><p>He\u2019ll be snoring in a few more minutes. Phil knows all the little quirks and patterns of Dan, and he takes as much pride in knowing them as someone else would casually grabbing their partners hand as they walked down the street. They\u2019ve developed their own displays of affection, often found embedded in assertions of knowledge. </p><p>He knows other things Dan likes, too. He leans in and breathes hot against the soft bulge of Dan\u2019s dick in his underwear. His heart is racing in a more familiar way now, and it\u2019s soothing to channel the nervous energy.  </p><p>Does he feel up for this? Maybe. Maybe not. </p><p>Guess he\u2019ll just find out. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is sleepy but urgent. </p><p>Phil\u2019s impressed with how long he actually stayed asleep. He\u2019s got Dan\u2019s pants tugged down and his dick pulled out, resting against Phil\u2019s tongue where he\u2019s been sucking lightly at it for almost fifteen minutes now. </p><p>He likes when Dan\u2019s hand cups the back of his head. He likes it even more when Dan groans. </p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Dan says. \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s blunt in the good way. </p><p>Phil pulls off. \u201cBlowing you.\u201d</p><p>His voice isn\u2019t raspy at all, he hasn\u2019t had Dan that far in his mouth and he hasn\u2019t wanted to do anything that would even come close to making him cough. It\u2019s all been safe and soft and slow and quiet and brilliantly hot. </p><p>\u201cNo shit, Sherlock,\u201d Dan says. His thighs are tense now. He\u2019s gone from a bit hard to very hard and Phil strokes the spit-damp skin with the hand he\u2019s not laying on. \u201cWhy, though?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I like it.\u201d Phil kisses just under the head, flicking his tongue over that spot that feels so good. \u201cCan I make you come?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan you\u2026\u201d Dan mutters and glares a glare that lacks any real impact at all. \u201cWe\u2019re not having sex.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSex can have many definitions,\u201d Phil says. He\u2019s being a prat; it\u2019s something Dan likes to point out to break Phil of his habit of thinking that if it\u2019s not penetration it doesn\u2019t count. </p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>\u201cBut I want to suck you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI refuse to tell your mum you fainted again with my penis in your mouth.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to faint.\u201d Phil puts and then places a soft kiss on the tip. \u201cI\u2019m poorly, you\u2019re supposed to give me what I want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d Dan tugs his hair a bit. \u201cShut up and suck.\u201d </p><p>Phil does so happily, eyes dropping shot. He can feel Dan\u2019s hand on himself, Dan working his own dick over with a total lack of patience while Phil focuses on the first couple of inches. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t take him long. He\u2019s always worked up when he wakes up hard, always impatient to come. Phil isn\u2019t sure if he really wants to swallow but the idea of moving seems like too much effort and he likes the feeling if not the taste, he likes the satisfaction of swallowing Dan down. </p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Phil says, feeling properly antsy as soon as he feels the last pulse against his tongue. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t play fair. </p><p>Phil does get his turn, but only after Dan\u2019s forced him to drink a whole glass of water and then lay back down on the sofa. </p><p>He suspects the motives are not entirely selfless; Dan directs him so that Phil\u2019s back is against his chest. Phil knows Dan likes it like this because he wants to be able to have his arms around Phil and feel Phil breathing. </p><p>Really. They\u2019re gonna have that conversation. If Dan\u2019s therapist has secondhand taught him anything, it\u2019s that talking actually does help. </p><p>Sometimes. </p><p>Dan wanking him helps sometimes too, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now; Dan\u2019s hand with a dry touch around Phil\u2019s cock, tugging him back to hardness. He\u2019s not all the way there yet but he loves the soft blank place sex (sex like this, sex the other way, sex any way they want to imagine it) takes him to. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t fucking believe you,\u201d Dan says, pressing a kiss to the side of Phil\u2019s head. \u201cFirst it\u2019s toast, now it\u2019s a handjob. What\u2019ll it be next time you feel poorly? I have to rim you on a fine feather bed with satin sheets I love myself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re offering.\u201d Phil smiles. He loves Dan\u2019s melodrama. He loves Dan. </p><p>He loves that he\u2019s got someone to take care of him. </p><p>He also love that thing Dan just did with his hand. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes, sliding his fingers down Dan\u2019s arm to loosely hold his wrist. \u201cPlease.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask.\u201d Dan is nosing at him still, dotting kissing here and there along his hairline and his temple. Phil stretches up and turns his neck, wanting one for his mouth. </p><p>Dan gives it to him. His fingers tighten and squeeze, hold, teasing Phil before he starts to move them again. </p><p>It\u2019s just so fucking - nice. He wants to come but he also craves this most when he\u2019s feeling off. He can\u2019t actually crawl inside Dan\u2019s skin but he can do the real-world next best thing of having Dan surround and dominate him, a human security blanket that gripes and grumbles and that Phil never, ever has to question really cares. </p><p>Dan\u2019s hand strokes down from Phil\u2019s collarbones to the where his public hair starts in one smooth motion, fingertips scratching over the coarse hairs there before he drags them right back up to rest over Phil\u2019s hair. \u201cStill with me, old man?\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s lost track of how many minutes it\u2019s been. He nods and swallows. His mouth is dry again; probably best not to say that to Dan. \u201cI\u2019m gonna come,\u201d he says, panting out the words. It still takes another handful of strokes after that but Dan is purpose driven now. </p><p>He spills a puddle of white against his own stomach, a satisfying burst of pleasure that ebbs too quickly but in a still pleasant way. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asks. He sounds a little breathless himself, though he\u2019s not hard again. </p><p>Phil takes stock so he can give a proper answer. His heart is racing but it\u2019s a just-right feeling and his mind is quiet. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>They crawl back into bed well after the sun has risen. </p><p>\u201cYou need to set an alarm,\u201d Phil says. </p><p>\u201cI will. But on your phone, and it\u2019s staying on my side of the bed.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is firm. </p><p>Relationships are about the art of compromise, and Phil\u2019s too tired to argue anyway. He hands over his phone and watches Dan set the alarm. </p><p>\u201cWhen for?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNoon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d </p><p>Phil huffs. \u201cEleven.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is not a negotiation,\u201d Dan says. \u201cAlso, you\u2019re not filming today.\u201d </p><p>The beginnings of a genuinely put out feeling start to stir, but Phil\u2019s not ready to deal with that so he shoves it back down and buries it. \u201cFine,\u201d he says. </p><p>He\u2019ll argue Dan once they wake up. </p><p>For now, the hamster is quiet and he\u2019s going to sleep.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>nod my head (don&rsquo;t close my eyes)</b><br />rated e, 2.5k&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Phil&rsquo;s awake at five am. (Again.)</p></blockquote><p>[<b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16641822\">read on ao3</a></b>]</p><p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Dan says, voice gritty with sleep. His hand slaps out and catches Phil on the chest, just over his nipple. He pats it a couple times, clearly not yet entirely of the waking world, and then sighs. &ldquo;Shh.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making any sounds,&rdquo; Phil whispers. &ldquo;How can I shh.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re. Stop.&rdquo; Dan shoves his face into the pillow. he doesn&rsquo;t move his hand, fingers splayed out resting against the dusting of hair on Phil&rsquo;s chest, right over his heartbeat.  &ldquo;Your head&rsquo;s loud. Be quiet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Go back to sleep.&rdquo; Phil doesn&rsquo;t have to listen long to realize that&rsquo;s exactly what Dan has done. </p><p>But he can&rsquo;t. He tries to take Dan&rsquo;s advice and quiet his head, but the little hamster on the wheel in the back of his mind is running so fast it feels like sparks are flying against his skull. </p><p>He shuts his eyes and turns over. Dan&rsquo;s hand is dislodged, but Dan doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind or even notice. </p><p>Sleep, Phil thinks. </p><p>Sleep. </p><p>He can do this. </p><p>He can sleep. </p><p>There&rsquo;s a sliver of city light coming in from under the window shade. It flickers sometimes. He starts to wonder what it might be. Ghosts? Birds flying by? Just a faulty light? Who fixes the street lights when the bulbs burn out? He&rsquo;s never seen that before. Maybe there are pictures on the internet&hellip;. </p><p>Sleep! </p><p>He shuts his eyes quickly and imagines a window slamming shut. Then he&rsquo;s picturing eyelids that look like windows, white wooden frames and glass with eyeballs behind them. He thinks about how they&rsquo;d need window blinds and would they have the twisty little sticks you turn to shut them? </p><p>Eye blinds. </p><p>He rolls over onto his stomach. He&rsquo;s facing Dan again. His limbs are starting to tingle in a weird way, but it&rsquo;s not a good feeling. It&rsquo;s restless but he&rsquo;s so tired and just - so tired. All the cells in his body want to be asleep right now, but the hamster won&rsquo;t stop running. </p><p>He should give it a name. </p><p>Maybe then it would stop. It has to be tired now. His mind has been spinning spinning spinning since Saturday morning, since he started contemplating his own death on the floor of a bathroom he hates. Since he sat inside a big white machine and tried not to move for an hour. Since he saw the panic on Dan&rsquo;s face just before Dan could mask it. </p><p>His stomach does a funny little twist. He feels like he hasn&rsquo;t had a proper sleep in approximately seventeen years.  </p><p>He turns onto his back, almost full circle from how he&rsquo;d started. He&rsquo;d hoped maybe it was just the way he was laying, but his stomach still feels strange and sloshy. </p><p>The sun will probably be coming up soon. How does the hamster have so much energy? There&rsquo;s an achy feeling behind Phil&rsquo;s eyes. He reaches up with both hands balled into fists and rubs fiercely at them. He won&rsquo;t be wearing his contacts for today, that&rsquo;s for sure. His mouth is dry and his eyes are dry and his stomach feels properly sour now and he can even feel a cold sweat breaking out on his forehead and the back of his neck. Suddenly the duvet feels oppressive even though he&rsquo;s got it pushed down to below his nipples.</p><p>It&rsquo;s urgent that he throw it off and sit up. He&rsquo;s practically gasping when he does, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. The floor is cool against his feet, and the sensation grounds him nicely. </p><p>He knows with mixed resignation and resentment that he can&rsquo;t just get back into bed, though. He doesn&rsquo;t feel nearly as shit as the last time he was up before the sun - he won&rsquo;t be passing out again, thank you very much. But all the same, the hamster wins again. </p><p>*</p><p>He lies on the couch upstairs for almost an hour before he hears Dan&rsquo;s heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. </p><p>Normally he&rsquo;d expect something more along the lines of <i>what the fuck are you doing</i> in that accusatory voice, because Dan is nothing if not put out when he&rsquo;s denied his morning cuddles. </p><p>It&rsquo;s not morning yet, though. It&rsquo;s not even five am, and Dan doesn&rsquo;t sound irate at all. He sounds worried when he asks, &ldquo;Are you okay? Did you - did something happen? Why didn&rsquo;t you call me-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Phil says, and that&rsquo;s immediately a lie. He thinks of Dan&rsquo;s worried face the weekend before, that first day after - he pictures Dan on his knees scrubbing the bath tub, Dan watching him sleep. He thinks of how sometimes he&rsquo;s too stubborn for his own good and doesn&rsquo;t let Dan in and he knows Dan takes his own cues from that, he knows Dan needs a little coaxing sometimes.<br /></p><p>When he feeling back up to snuff he&rsquo;ll really have to focus on working out Dan&rsquo;s trauma with what happened. </p><p>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo; Dan doesn&rsquo;t sound reassured.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know why this is hitting him so hard right now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fine. I think. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do we need to go back to hospital?&rdquo; Dan asks. </p><p>It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise Phil that Dan&rsquo;s mind goes to the worst place first. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Phil says immediately. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that. I just - I think it&rsquo;s the tablets. I just feel crap.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Dan says softly. It&rsquo;s so early and it&rsquo;s so quiet. Phil shuts his eyes. Even Dan&rsquo;s footsteps across the room are quiet now. The world seems calm and all the frantic feelings are just on the inside. &ldquo;Toast?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil almost smiles. &ldquo;Maybe tea instead.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>Dan makes tea. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t make tea often. Neither of them drink it all that much, to the shame of their forefathers. </p><p>But they are still British at the end of the day and when someone&rsquo;s feeling poorly, tea feels like a comfort and a cure. </p><p>He perches on the arm of the couch while Phil sits up to drink. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your stomach?&rdquo; He asks, reaching out to push Phil&rsquo;s soft, product-free hair back up off his forehead. &ldquo;You had your hand on it when I walked in.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil hadn&rsquo;t even realized. </p><p>&ldquo;Sort of,&rdquo; he says. He takes another sip. It&rsquo;s still slightly too hot, but he&rsquo;s always had a problem with patience. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to sick or anything. I just feel strange. Like pins and needles all over, and my stomach feels queasy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo; Dan sounds fond, and amused. &ldquo;Do you feel hyperactive, by any chance?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; It had seemed so funny as a joke on the internet, but now he&rsquo;s not sure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. If I am, then it&rsquo;s not fair. I think if I did try to get up and move around I might actually sick.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay first of all, please don&rsquo;t. Second of all, ugh.&rdquo; The last bit has a sympathetic twist to it. The sympathy is nice. So is Dan&rsquo;s hand in his hair, so he leans into that. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I will,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like - the same way I feel when I&rsquo;m carsick at the very start.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Please tell me your body hasn&rsquo;t adapted to give you motion sickness just from laying down,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Or I&rsquo;m going to have to seriously ask kind of genetic fuckery happened in the Lester bloodline?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My grandparents were first cousins.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s only after he speaks that Phil realizes that probably wasn&rsquo;t a helpful response. &ldquo;Can we watch some television?&rdquo; </p><p>It feels too strange to be awake when the rest of the world isn&rsquo;t yet. It puts too many thoughts in his head, and Phil&rsquo;s never been one to linger in existential discomfort. He&rsquo;d much prefer to just watch anime with his head in Dan&rsquo;s lap. </p><p>* </p><p>The peace only lasts for about twenty minutes. </p><p>His heart is doing a weird racing thing, like the hamster has decided to relocate. </p><p>Phil grins a bit at the mental image of a hamster hooked up to all the valves and tubes of his heart. &ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he whispers. </p><p>He just wants to share, but when he looks up he sees Dan&rsquo;s head lolled back against the couch. His eyes are shut and his mouth is open, a touch of dampness glistening at the corner of his lips. </p><p>He&rsquo;ll be snoring in a few more minutes. Phil knows all the little quirks and patterns of Dan, and he takes as much pride in knowing them as someone else would casually grabbing their partners hand as they walked down the street. They&rsquo;ve developed their own displays of affection, often found embedded in assertions of knowledge. </p><p>He knows other things Dan likes, too. He leans in and breathes hot against the soft bulge of Dan&rsquo;s dick in his underwear. His heart is racing in a more familiar way now, and it&rsquo;s soothing to channel the nervous energy.  </p><p>Does he feel up for this? Maybe. Maybe not. </p><p>Guess he&rsquo;ll just find out. </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck are you doing?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice is sleepy but urgent. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s impressed with how long he actually stayed asleep. He&rsquo;s got Dan&rsquo;s pants tugged down and his dick pulled out, resting against Phil&rsquo;s tongue where he&rsquo;s been sucking lightly at it for almost fifteen minutes now. </p><p>He likes when Dan&rsquo;s hand cups the back of his head. He likes it even more when Dan groans. </p><p>&ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;What the fuck.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s blunt in the good way. </p><p>Phil pulls off. &ldquo;Blowing you.&rdquo;</p><p>His voice isn&rsquo;t raspy at all, he hasn&rsquo;t had Dan that far in his mouth and he hasn&rsquo;t wanted to do anything that would even come close to making him cough. It&rsquo;s all been safe and soft and slow and quiet and brilliantly hot. </p><p>&ldquo;No shit, Sherlock,&rdquo; Dan says. His thighs are tense now. He&rsquo;s gone from a bit hard to very hard and Phil strokes the spit-damp skin with the hand he&rsquo;s not laying on. &ldquo;Why, though?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because I like it.&rdquo; Phil kisses just under the head, flicking his tongue over that spot that feels so good. &ldquo;Can I make you come?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Can you&hellip;&rdquo; Dan mutters and glares a glare that lacks any real impact at all. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not having sex.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sex can have many definitions,&rdquo; Phil says. He&rsquo;s being a prat; it&rsquo;s something Dan likes to point out to break Phil of his habit of thinking that if it&rsquo;s not penetration it doesn&rsquo;t count. </p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>&ldquo;But I want to suck you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I refuse to tell your mum you fainted again with my penis in your mouth.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to faint.&rdquo; Phil puts and then places a soft kiss on the tip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m poorly, you&rsquo;re supposed to give me what I want.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I hate you.&rdquo; Dan tugs his hair a bit. &ldquo;Shut up and suck.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil does so happily, eyes dropping shot. He can feel Dan&rsquo;s hand on himself, Dan working his own dick over with a total lack of patience while Phil focuses on the first couple of inches. </p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take him long. He&rsquo;s always worked up when he wakes up hard, always impatient to come. Phil isn&rsquo;t sure if he really wants to swallow but the idea of moving seems like too much effort and he likes the feeling if not the taste, he likes the satisfaction of swallowing Dan down. </p><p>&ldquo;My turn,&rdquo; Phil says, feeling properly antsy as soon as he feels the last pulse against his tongue. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t play fair. </p><p>Phil does get his turn, but only after Dan&rsquo;s forced him to drink a whole glass of water and then lay back down on the sofa. </p><p>He suspects the motives are not entirely selfless; Dan directs him so that Phil&rsquo;s back is against his chest.

What&rsquo;ll it be next time you feel poorly? I have to rim you on a fine feather bed with satin sheets I love myself?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re offering.&rdquo; Phil smiles. He loves Dan&rsquo;s melodrama. He loves Dan. </p><p>He loves that he&rsquo;s got someone to take care of him. </p><p>He also love that thing Dan just did with his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he breathes, sliding his fingers down Dan&rsquo;s arm to loosely hold his wrist. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to ask.&rdquo; Dan is nosing at him still, dotting kissing here and there along his hairline and his temple.
