                "content": "<p>Sansa would beg to differ. <br /></p><blockquote><p><small><b>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our brother,&rdquo; Arya said</b>, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><br /></b>Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning. It was frowning now. &ldquo;What are you talking about, children?&rdquo; <br /><b>&ldquo;Our half brother,&rdquo; Sansa corrected, soft and precise.\n\n</b><br /></small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>She had not thought of Jon in ages. <b>He was only her</b> <b>half</b> <b>brother</b>, but still &hellip; with Robb and Bran and Rickon dead, Jon Snow was the only brother that remained to her. \n\n</small><br /></p></blockquote><p>Sansa literally corrects Arya when Arya says that Jon is their brother. \nHer thoughts of Jon always include the differentiation of him being her half brother or bastard brother.\n\n<br /></p><blockquote><p><small>&ldquo;There was a black brother,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;begging men for the \nWall, only he was kind of old and smelly.&rdquo; She hadn&rsquo;t liked that at all.\n She had always imagined the Night&rsquo;s Watch to be men like Uncle Benjen. \nIn the songs, they were called the black knights of the Wall. But this \nman had been crookbacked and hideous, and he looked as though he might \nhave lice. If this was what the Night&rsquo;s Watch was truly like, <b>she felt \nsorry for her bastard half brother, Jon. \n\n</b></small><br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> <small>She sang for mercy, for the living and the dead alike, for Bran and Rickon and Robb, for her sister Arya and <b>her bastard brother Jon Snow, away off on the Wall. \n\n</b></small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n<small>Sansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart,\n could be so different. <b>It would have been easier if Arya had been a \nbastard, like their half brother Jon</b>. She even looked like\n Jon, with the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of \ntheir lady mother in her face or her coloring. And Jon&rsquo;s mother had been\n common, or so people whispered. Once, when she was littler, Sansa had \neven asked Mother if perhaps there hadn&rsquo;t been some mistake. Perhaps the\n grumkins had stolen her real sister. But Mother had only laughed and \nsaid no, Arya was her daughter and Sansa&rsquo;s trueborn sister, blood of \ntheir blood. Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about \nit, so she supposed it had to be true. <br /></small></p></blockquote><p>Note the assertion here that Arya was Sansa&rsquo;s <i>trueborn </i>sister, blood of their blood.

On rewatch, they really drove home that the Unsullied and Jorah are fighting the dead which makes me think it\u2019s meant to deflect from D*ny\u2019s absence. <i>They\u2019ve been so loyal to her for so long, surely if they are there, she\u2019s there, too; they just don\u2019t want to spoil her epic scenes against the NK, right?

Hasn\u2019t this been their theme all along?\u00a0Even though the Queen They Chose abandons the fight, they stay behind, to do what is right, although it may cost them everything. A lot of people think that either GW or M will die. I think that quite likely, too. But wouldn\u2019t it be poetically even sadder if they not died because they were following\u00a0commands but because of their own free will - for the living - when they could have easily followed D*ny south and survived?</p><p>- I have been rooting for Jorah to get <i>home</i> for half a decade now and I don\u2019t mean this geographically. I think he finally will which unfortunately also raises the likeliness of his death (although he always had bad cards; I always assumed he\u2019d either die <i>for</i> D*ny or <i>by</i> D*ny).</p>- About the scene with D*ny and Jon in the crypts \u2026 I\u2019m not sure if they would go there but if they actually have Jon say <i>You don\u2019t belong down here </i>like he did to Littlefinger, my jaw will be on the floor. Some people say this scene takes place shortly after their arrival in WF - in that case I\u2019d think it impossible for him to say this to her but if it happens after the parentage reveal (to Jon, not D*ny) then I can actually see him snap like that(followed by instant internal regret, as it\u2019s neither smart nor nice).<p>- This is going to be a tough season for D*ny and while I don\u2019t want to see her on any throne (because I don\u2019t think she can rule at all and if she couldn\u2019t learn it in 7 seasons she won\u2019t learn it now) I will feel sorry for her, truly - not for the Mother of Dragons though but for the sunburnt girl in a pale pink dress, standing on Illyrio\u2019s balcony,\u00a0looking across the narrow sea and dreaming of home.</p><p>- My certainty for the kidnapping plot to happen just skyrocketed and I actually think that the pictures rumored to be Jon bending the knee to Cersei are exactly that.<br></p><p>- I have yet to see anything that contradicts Jon x Sansa which is quite telling considering the amount of J*nerys\u00a0they\u2019ve been dropping but that might be just me.</p><p>Anyways, I\u2019m so hyped and <i>so</i> ready for this!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"169\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"desingyouruniverse:O3B8zeCP24ORepPoTdJl6Q:Zqw55y2Vrc_K1\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/73ca494b9f78acd3b3bf4123f8de7e81/tumblr_p584cp4V2s1qe8lb8o1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"169\" data-orig-width=\"300\"></figure></p>",
