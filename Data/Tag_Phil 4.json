He could only bring himself to wear it at home and very nearly had panic attacks whenever someone saw him, which was why when Phil Lester showed up on his doorstep he almost pissed his white skirt. </p><p>\u201cHey Daniel\u201d Phil breathed, running his hand through his already slicked back hair. Dan looked hot, for lack of a better word. His cute curly hair had a pastel pink flower crown on top, to match that he had a pastel oversized jumper tucked into a short white skirt. However, the gap between Dans thigh high socks and the hem of his skirt is what caught Phils eye the most. Fuck. Phil knew Dan wore pastel clothes, he\u2019d been to the boys house before, but he didn\u2019t know he wore <i>this</i>. </p><p>The pastel boy rubbed his soft thighs together as he locked his chocolate eyes with Phils icy blue ones. Phil could\u2019ve melted in that boys eyes. </p><p>\u201cHey Phil\u201d Dan replied softly, admiring Phils all black outfit.</p><p>\u201cCan I, uh, come in?\u201d Phil rasped. Dan replied with a soft \u2018mhmm\u2019, refusing to meet Phils eyes. Phil was seriously going to melt, this boy was just so adorable.  </p><p>Dan watched as Phil entered. Phils adam\u2019s apple moved slightly as he swallowed his newfound nerves, Dans thoughts began to go rogue after seeing that. Dan loved Phils piercings, he had 4 piercings on each ear, an eyebrow piercing and snakebites, very much contrasting to the pair of small silver hoops Dan had in his own ears. Dan wanted nothing more but to stare and nip at those piercings and to feel them against his own skin. </p><p> Phil followed Dan up the stairs removing his leather jacket as he went. When Dan had plopped onto his soft  Queen sized bed he had a chance to take in Phil properly. Tattoos crept from underneath Phils shirt and up his neck, they also seemed to crawl down his arms and that\u2019s when Dan found himself entranced in Phils biceps. </p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d Phil said now sitting opposite Dan, watching Dan stare lovingly at him. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dan squeaked. \u201coh\u201d he said, realising he\u2019d been caught. </p><p>\u201cYou look great by the way&hellip;\u201d Phil said almost awkwardly, biting his snakebites. Dan instantly turned red and hid his face in his hands. He forgot he was wearing that. </p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m gonna go change wait a minute\u201d he said tearing up, he couldn\u2019t control his nerves especially since it was Phil. Here\u2019s a secret, Dan has had a crush on Phil for quite a while now but Dan has been too scared to say anything. He didn\u2019t know if Phil was even remotely interested in boys nevermind him. </p><p>As Dan got up to change Phil grabbed his hand and pulled him back down, making him fall backwards into Phils lap. Dan stared innocently into Phils eyes before realising what had just happened. He hid his face in his hands again. God why was there so much embarrassment today!</p><p>\u201cIm serious Dan\u201d Phil said gently, removing Dans hands from his face and stroking Dans cheek, \u201cYou look amazing\u201d </p><p>It was safe to say Dans heart was going crazy. He couldn\u2019t even feel Phils hand on his face because it had gone numb from the sudden rush of blood.</p><p>\u201cPiss off\u201d Dan murmered, still incredibly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cNo Daniel, you seriously look beautiful\u201d Phil said, picking Dan up and holding him against his chest. Dans body was so soft and small compared to his, Phil thought that if he pressed any harder Dan would break.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look so bad yourself\u201d Dan whispered, looking down, refusing to make any eyecontact.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that Daniel?\u201d Phil said, lifting Dans chin up with his fingers. Phil didn\u2019t know what he was feeling, he was horny, in love and flustered all at once and he was sure Dan could tell since he was right on Phils lap. </p><p>Dan knew that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to say that again so without thinking he went and left a soft peck on Phils cheek. Phil very nearly almost squealed. This boy was seriously something else. Phil returned the favour to which Dan hid his face in Phils neck. At least it wasn\u2019t his hands this time. Phil noticed that Dans face was really soft and it made him wonder if that was true for everything else, but he stopped himself from ruining such a pure moment. </p><p>Phil stroked Dans hair gently. \u201cYou really are adorable\u201d he chuckled. </p>",

Phil could\u2019ve melted in that boys eyes. </p><p>\u201cHey Phil\u201d Dan replied softly, admiring Phils all black outfit.</p><p>\u201cCan I, uh, come in?\u201d Phil rasped. Dan replied with a soft \u2018mhmm\u2019, refusing to meet Phils eyes. Phil was seriously going to melt, this boy was just so adorable.  </p><p>Dan watched as Phil entered. Phils adam\u2019s apple moved slightly as he swallowed his newfound nerves, Dans thoughts began to go rogue after seeing that. Dan loved Phils piercings, he had 4 piercings on each ear, an eyebrow piercing and snakebites, very much contrasting to the pair of small silver hoops Dan had in his own ears. Dan wanted nothing more but to stare and nip at those piercings and to feel them against his own skin. </p><p> Phil followed Dan up the stairs removing his leather jacket as he went. When Dan had plopped onto his soft  Queen sized bed he had a chance to take in Phil properly. Tattoos crept from underneath Phils shirt and up his neck, they also seemed to crawl down his arms and that\u2019s when Dan found himself entranced in Phils biceps. </p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d Phil said now sitting opposite Dan, watching Dan stare lovingly at him. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dan squeaked. \u201coh\u201d he said, realising he\u2019d been caught. </p><p>\u201cYou look great by the way\u2026\u201d Phil said almost awkwardly, biting his snakebites. Dan instantly turned red and hid his face in his hands. He forgot he was wearing that. </p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m gonna go change wait a minute\u201d he said tearing up, he couldn\u2019t control his nerves especially since it was Phil. Here\u2019s a secret, Dan has had a crush on Phil for quite a while now but Dan has been too scared to say anything. He didn\u2019t know if Phil was even remotely interested in boys nevermind him. </p><p>As Dan got up to change Phil grabbed his hand and pulled him back down, making him fall backwards into Phils lap. Dan stared innocently into Phils eyes before realising what had just happened. He hid his face in his hands again. God why was there so much embarrassment today!</p><p>\u201cIm serious Dan\u201d Phil said gently, removing Dans hands from his face and stroking Dans cheek, \u201cYou look amazing\u201d </p><p>It was safe to say Dans heart was going crazy. He couldn\u2019t even feel Phils hand on his face because it had gone numb from the sudden rush of blood.</p><p>\u201cPiss off\u201d Dan murmered, still incredibly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cNo Daniel, you seriously look beautiful\u201d Phil said, picking Dan up and holding him against his chest. Dans body was so soft and small compared to his, Phil thought that if he pressed any harder Dan would break.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look so bad yourself\u201d Dan whispered, looking down, refusing to make any eyecontact.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that Daniel?\u201d Phil said, lifting Dans chin up with his fingers. Phil didn\u2019t know what he was feeling, he was horny, in love and flustered all at once and he was sure Dan could tell since he was right on Phils lap. </p><p>Dan knew that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to say that again so without thinking he went and left a soft peck on Phils cheek. Phil very nearly almost squealed. This boy was seriously something else. Phil returned the favour to which Dan hid his face in Phils neck. At least it wasn\u2019t his hands this time. Phil noticed that Dans face was really soft and it made him wonder if that was true for everything else, but he stopped himself from ruining such a pure moment. </p><p>Phil stroked Dans hair gently. \u201cYou really are adorable\u201d he chuckled. </p></p>",

Pastel skirts, pastel jeans, pastel crop tops, pastel flower crowns&hellip; you get the idea. As much as he loved it, there was a catch. He could only bring himself to wear it at home and very nearly had panic attacks whenever someone saw him, which was why when Phil Lester showed up on his doorstep he almost pissed his white skirt. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Daniel&rdquo; Phil breathed, running his hand through his already slicked back hair. Dan looked hot, for lack of a better word. His cute curly hair had a pastel pink flower crown on top, to match that he had a pastel oversized jumper tucked into a short white skirt.
