        "answer": "<p>This show has gained a lot of attention for Cyrus being one of the first openly gay characters on Disney Channel and (assuming the other main characters have endgame relationships) Disney would earn backlash for not treating Cyrus\u2019s storyline the same or at least similar. Also, Tyrus has been hinted at so heavily in the show (I mean swing scene 2.0 seemed like it was taken straight out of a stereotypical rom-com minus an angry kiss. There were deliberate decisions made in the way it was shot and edited and the music playing at the end that hint towards romantic feelings). There is so much romantic coding in their relationship with parallels to the het couples on the show (and T.J.\u2019s seeming need to touch Cyrus in ALMOST. EVERY. SCENE.), that not going through with it at this point would pretty much be queer baiting. Also, T.J. looked back and Josh literally said they didn\u2019t expect them to cut back to Buffy first so they didn\u2019t expect a debate (pretty much confirming that Tuffy isn\u2019t a thing)</p><p>There is a way to make platonic and affectionate male friendships, and this is not it. Many middle schoolers can understand that (not to mention the many high schoolers and adults that watch specifically because of Cyrus\u2019s storyline). Thus, not going through with the storyline would seem like Disney is oversensoring and let down the many viewers that are watching specifically to see themselves reflected on screen.</p><p>Also, there\u2019s not really much reason for Luke to have been on set so much if he wasn\u2019t for Cyrus (Garren was there quite a bit so we can assume that Muffy is a thing, and it\u2019s pretty clear that Jandi will probably be endgame. That leaves T.J. for Cyrus). Luke was actually one of the last the recurring actors to leave set during the shooting of the s3 finale so he clearly has a significant part in that.</p><p>Sorry this is rambly, but I think it would be really crappy at this point for Disney to refuse a relationship for Cyrus and T.J. is the most obvious option because they\u2019ve already heavily hinted at it.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",
