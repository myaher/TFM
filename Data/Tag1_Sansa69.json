He literally saw them coming down the Dany parade and hightailed it inside the castle <i><b>cuss fuck that.</b></i>\u00a0He spends most of his time now hiding under the Stark kid beds. Which is why we never see him in 8X01. Bran\u2019s bedroom is his favorite because he\u2019s never in there and he can sleep on top of his bed.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Arya and Bran don\u2019t mind but Sansa does because he gets fur all over her clothes, so she drags him to a balcony near the lord&rsquo;s chambers every morning so she can brush his fur out. <i>Maybe she gathers up all the loose fur and places it downwind from Dany\u2019s open window, maybe she doesn&rsquo;t.\u00a0</i></p><p>One day,\u00a0<b><i>Ghost takes a giant shit inside the great hall</i></b> and because he\u2019s a good pupper and feels bad he stands next to it so people know it was him.\u00a0 Not like there\u2019s anyone else to blame.

Seems like something he&rsquo;d do for the lolz.&nbsp;</p><h2><i><b>Or a really dramatic, &lsquo;what if Dany kills Ghost thinking he belongs to Sansa as retribution to being disrespected and it parallels Cersei killing Lady back in S1.&rsquo;</b></i></h2><p>Most of the castle staff are still scared of him so of course, Arya is stuck cleaning it up. No other Stark is going to help and Jon is off somewhere riding <strike>Daenerys</strike> a dragon or whatever.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Arya is pissed, shoveling his shit into a sack with the newcomer Gendry&rsquo;s help,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>He never shat in the castle before, he&rsquo;d always go out to the wood&rdquo;</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>It was true. He preferred to shit out by the fresh smell of the pine, no one liked the smell of crap. Not even him.&nbsp;</p><p>Gendry suggested she force him outside so he can see there&rsquo;s nothing scary about the dragons. <i>Yeah sure</i>, Ghost thought to himself. <i>You go shit out in an open field with two dragons flying up above. Gawking.&nbsp;</i></p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t afraid, it was undignified is all. Okay, so maybe he was a bit afraid.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s how he ended up in his current situation, with Sansa and Arya the next day, trying their hardest to push him out of a back door to the wood behind Winterfell.&nbsp;</p><p>Blessed Sansa was sitting on her ass in the snow, using her legs to push him forward. Arya was in front of him, dangling a dried up bone as if he were some idiot dog. She meant well. But could she have not put her skills to use and got him a fat cat instead?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bran looked on quietly from the side sitting in his chair by the door. Ghost was not one to judge his weird behavior, it did free up a nice day bed for him.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa to Bran, <i>&ldquo;Bran do you think you could -&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;But if you could just tie that rope to your -&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I need to hold the door.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p>Arya tossed the bone on the floor, <i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother, he wouldn&rsquo;t even hold a bag open for me to shovel shit into.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p>The bone was so dry it instantly broke into crumbs as it hit the ground. The disrespect from these Stark girls.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Lady of Winterfell doing ass first in the snow?&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;</p><p>He turned his head to look behind him, the one they called the Hound approached.</p><p>Arya scurried to help Sansa up,&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to get Ghost outside, he&nbsp;keeps shitting in the castle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p>This would have been his chance to hurry off, but the Hound picked him up by the scruff with ease. <i>Surprising</i>, and he finds that he&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t totally mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;<i>It&rsquo;s been a while since someone could do this&rsquo;, </i>he thinks, even if his back legs practically drag on the ground. <i>&lsquo;I could be into this&rsquo;</i></p><p>But then, the traitorous Hound marches up to the door and throws him outside of the walls, slamming the entrance shut behind him.&nbsp;</p><p>From inside he can hear Bran complain,&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;I was going to close the door.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He shook himself of the shock, where was the respect for the sigil of this fine castle?&nbsp;</p><p><i>&lsquo;I might as well take a shit, maybe find myself a fat rabbit if any are left.&rsquo;</i></p><hr /><p>Somewhere up above Daenerys flys on Drogon. She was annoyed and attempting to cool down from her morning serving of <i><b>Sansa Snark</b></i>. She had told Jon twice now that she needed his sister to respect him and yet things remained the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Dany had even tried to be kind. But today was her last day of attempts.&nbsp;</p><p>She had offered to help Sansa brush out her dog this morning. It would have been of mutual benefit. The stupid thing shed like crazy, his white furs even managed to reach her rooms despite it never wandering into the guest wing of the castle.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa, of course, refused,&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;You should give your attention to your own pets, Your Grace.&rdquo;</i></p><p>It was infuriating. Her children were not <i>pets</i>. She had given Sansa many chances, disrespect her so be it. Disrespect her children there would be consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>So lost in her thoughts she was that the sudden speed of Drogon on the chase took her by surprise. She looked down.&nbsp;</p><p><i>A wolf? Not just any wolf. Sansa&rsquo;s.</i> That&rsquo;s what had gotten his attention. Could a pet plan revenge for his owner? No. But a child could.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;Fuck those dragons!&rdquo; <b>could a direwolf not</b> <b>take a shit in peace</b> anymore.&nbsp;</i>He was already running back towards the castle at a speed he didn&rsquo;t know he had&nbsp;</p><p>Scarcely had he begun to dig up an area to relieve himself in when he caught the scent of the scaley beast.

        "question": "Things that relieved me during episode 1: Sansa\u2019s apology to Tyrion being borderline sarcastic and not about her self deprecating Bran emoting when he reunited with Jon Theon being badass and then going north, meaning he\u2019s reuniting with Sansa  Sansa Snark first of her name  Jon at least visibly not being comfortable on the dragon  Tyrion getting called out on all his shit, from the eunuch jokes to trusting Cersei  The fact that Jon not only said but emphasized to Dany how pretty his sister is",
        "answer": "<p>I don\u2019t think her apology was sarcastic, I think she was sincere, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing. Look, if Sansa had apologized to Tyrion for being a\u00a0\u2018\u2019bad child bride\u2019\u2019, I would\u2019ve have thrown hands, however, she apologized for making an extremely reasonable decision that just happened to endanger him, and she, being the good and empathetic person that she is, felt bad about it. I did like her criticizing Tyrion for his blind faith in Cersei as well. That was really sastifying to watch.\u00a0 Bran definitely developed a wider array of emotions. It\u2019s not radically different, but it\u2019s a positive change. Theon absolutely killed it this episode, and seeing him wanting to help fight for the Starks, who are his family, after all that happened, makes me so proud and emotional. It\u2019s no surprise that Jon isn\u2019t quite comfortable on the decision, it\u2019s his first time. That being said, unlike Theon, Jon only grew and lived with the Starks. His identity revolves around the North and the Starks, and so when faced with a choice, he\u2019s going to choose the only side that ever really mattered to him. There\u2019s also Arya, who really surprised me this episode. Not in terms of siding with Sansa, but in terms of feeling so human this episode. She wasn\u2019t just the emotionless killing machine the show pushed her to be last season. Seeing her smile, laugh, make jokes and flirt in this episode really great to see. Made me remember why I liked her so much in the first six seasons when I first watched the show. So yeah, the Starks are doing all right. Love that for them.\u00a0</p>",

But we shouldn\u2019t\nforget that the only reason he was ever in that position of power is because of\nSansa. At Castle Black Jon was ready to run away, abandon everyone he knew and\nall of Westeros to the army of the dead. But then Sansa arrived and before\ndinner was over, she told Jon she was taking back Winterfell, with or without\nhim. Sansa convinced Jon to go to war, and when he didn\u2019t take her advice about\nneeding more men, she used what little means she could to save him and win the\nBattle of the Bastards. Defeating Ramsay is how they took back Winterfell and\nthe North; therefore, she is the reason Jon was proclaimed King in the North.\nI\u2019m not saying she could have done it without him, but Jon never would have\ndone it without\u00a0<i>her</i>.</p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0Sansa knew what she was doing when she had Jon\ncosplay as Ned. That was about making the Northern Lords see Jon as his second\ncoming. She put a direwolf on her own chest, telling everyone the Starks were\nback. Throughout s6 in various ways Sansa affirmed and reaffirmed who Jon was,\na Stark, even without him having the name. Jon said \u201cI\u2019m not a Stark\u201d and Sansa\nsays, \u201cYou are to me,\u201d but we already knew that because of how she treated him.\nShe even offered him the Lords chambers, essentially telling him\u00a0<i>he</i>\u00a0was\nthe head of the family. These are huge things she\u2019s doing for him, but she\nisn\u2019t just doing them for him. How she presented him to the North as a Stark,\nand her respect for him as a Stark, is an important part of what allows the\nNorth to see him as a true Stark and therefore proclaim him king. Jon would\nhave never done that for himself, but Sansa did it for him.</p><p>Why am I saying all this? Because\nJon becoming king wasn\u2019t just an honor the Northerners bestowed on Jon, it\nwas\u00a0<i>Sansa\u2019s achievement</i>. She has this satisfied smile when the\nLords proclaim Jon king, and Jon looks at her immediately because this wasn\u2019t\njust about him, it\u2019s about\u00a0<i>them</i>. They are in this together, and Jon\nknows that. In season 7 when he sends the raven about bending the knee, he\nwrites that he has pledged \u201c<i>our</i>\u201d forces to Daenerys\u2019 cause. As in, in\nhis head as well as Sansa\u2019s, they\u2019re doing this together out of a mutual\nnecessity, but also with an emotional interdependency because at the time,\nthey\u2019re the only family they have, they\u2019re also kinda the only person the other\ntrusts, although how much is sometimes a struggle. In s7 before Jon leaves\nthey\u2019re squabbling because in a strange way, they\u2019re ruling as king and\nunofficial queen. It\u2019s a complex situation, but basically, they are totally\nentangled with each other in the business of running the North.</p><p>I forgot to mention earlier that\nSansa has suffered more and longer for Northern Independence than her remaining\nsiblings and Jon. We need to remember that when Robb won victories in battle\nSansa was beaten. Sansa has shed her own blood for Northern Independence since\nshe was 13yo. The reason she married Ramsay was to get Winterfell and the North\nback. She was raped and tortured on top of her previous brutalization for her\nfamily and for the North. She and Jon have finally gotten it though, everything\nshe has endured has been worth it because they have freedom and Sansa is\nfinally safe.</p><p>I\u2019m getting to my point, I promise,\njust a little more! SO, Sansa has witnessed Jon fall prey to mind games with\nRamsay in spite of her warning. Against her advice Jon decides to go South.\nWhile he is away, without communicating with her, he decides to bend the knee\nto a queen that Littlefinger makes\u00a0<i>sure</i>\u00a0she knows is\nbeautiful. Why is that an issue? Well, before Jon left Sansa had given Jon\nanother piece of advice, be smarter than Robb. Jon has disregarded her advice\nseveral times now, so she assumes he disregarded it again. She assumes that Jon\nwas dumb, that Daenerys seduced the Kingdom out of his hand. Sansa thought it\nwas\u00a0<i>their</i>\u00a0kingdom, and Jon made this decision, seemingly once\nagain ignoring her advice, making a mistake that in Sansa\u2019s eyes may get him\nkilled because that\u2019s what happened to Robb.</p><p>So, Sansa had to watch Jon leave,\nworrying he wouldn\u2019t come back. While he was away, she defended him, appeased\nthe Lords, held their army together, and fended off a sexual harasser, all\nbecause she trusted Jon to do what he needed to do for the North. And he writes\nher a little note to say \u201cI gave it all away.\u201d I think Sansa trusts Jon, but\nshe thinks he was manipulated in spite of her best efforts to prepare him. She\nconcludes from this information that while she\u2019s upset with Jon, it is\u00a0<i>Daenerys\u00a0</i>who\nhas taken everything. Sansa sent Jon off to get dragonglass, and he returns,\nstripped of everything Sansa had worked so hard to get. Daenerys took Jon\u2019s\ncrown, and she took Sansa\u2019s kingdom.</p><p><i>Of\ncourse</i>\u00a0Sansa doesn\u2019t like Daenerys! I think it\u2019s entirely\njustified. If anyone has gone through what Sansa has in trying to be free, they\nare not going to be thankful that the price tag for everyone on the continent\nnot dying was their freedom. Sansa has accepted that it is, but that\u2019s an awful\nindictment of Dany\u2019s priorities, her concern for the Westerosi, her\nentitlement, and her regard for the will of the people. Daenerys could have\nsettled for an alliance, she didn\u2019t have to insist on the crown and kingdom.\nDany\u00a0<i>shouldn\u2019t</i>\u00a0have insisted on that. She could have found a\nreasonable compromise, but she\u00a0<i>had</i>\u00a0to have the North. Sansa\nknows this. She\u2019s savvy. Sansa used Littlefinger\u2019s interest in her to get an\narmy, of course she thinks Daenarys used her beauty to get a kingdom. Sansa\nmade up her mind about Daenerys before the Dragon Queen ever set foot in the\nNorth. This is no savior or liberator, this is a woman who takes, and takes,\nand takes. Sansa has had enough of people who take from her. She\u2019s had enough\nof people who take\u00a0<i>her family</i>\u00a0from her. I think Sansa doesn\u2019t\nrealize exactly how dangerous Daenerys is, if she did she would assuredly suck\nup more, but she knows that Dany is a conqueror who uses many methods to get\nher way. Sansa hugs Jon, but her eyes are on Dany, her cool assessment of the\nwould-be queen complete without ever exchanging a word.</p>",

Jon said \u201cI\u2019m not a Stark\u201d and Sansa\nsays, \u201cYou are to me,\u201d but we already knew that because of how she treated him.\nShe even offered him the Lords chambers, essentially telling him\u00a0<i>he</i>\u00a0was\nthe head of the family. These are huge things she\u2019s doing for him, but she\nisn\u2019t just doing them for him. How she presented him to the North as a Stark,\nand her respect for him as a Stark, is an important part of what allows the\nNorth to see him as a true Stark and therefore proclaim him king. Jon would\nhave never done that for himself, but Sansa did it for him.</p><p>Why am I saying all this?

We need to remember that when Robb won victories in battle\nSansa was beaten. Sansa has shed her own blood for Northern Independence since\nshe was 13yo. The reason she married Ramsay was to get Winterfell and the North\nback. She was raped and tortured on top of her previous brutalization for her\nfamily and for the North. She and Jon have finally gotten it though, everything\nshe has endured has been worth it because they have freedom and Sansa is\nfinally safe.</p><p>I\u2019m getting to my point, I promise,\njust a little more!

Sansa thought it\nwas\u00a0<i>their</i>\u00a0kingdom, and Jon made this decision, seemingly once\nagain ignoring her advice, making a mistake that in Sansa\u2019s eyes may get him\nkilled because that\u2019s what happened to Robb.</p><p>So, Sansa had to watch Jon leave,\nworrying he wouldn\u2019t come back.

Sansa used Littlefinger\u2019s interest in her to get an\narmy, of course she thinks Daenarys used her beauty to get a kingdom. Sansa\nmade up her mind about Daenerys before the Dragon Queen ever set foot in the\nNorth. This is no savior or liberator, this is a woman who takes, and takes,\nand takes. Sansa has had enough of people who take from her. She\u2019s had enough\nof people who take\u00a0<i>her family</i>\u00a0from her. I think Sansa doesn\u2019t\nrealize exactly how dangerous Daenerys is, if she did she would assuredly suck\nup more, but she knows that Dany is a conqueror who uses many methods to get\nher way.

It doesn&rsquo;t help that Daenerys has shown no sign of even trying to win the respect of the Northeners nor has there been any substantial proof that she is remotely a good leader. However, according to them, all of these things are completely unimportant to Sansa, and Sansa is just concerned about the fact that Daenery is pretty.</p>",

If you fall she will bring you back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSansa..\u201d</p><p>A pink blush travels over her features sparking a familiar warmth in her belly. Blue eyes snap back to his wanting to slap the gentleness from his lips, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She shakes her head, \u201cNo more speeches about dragons and fire Jon. I won\u2019t hear it.\u201d </p><p>Coming forward she stands in front of him the ice she uses to protect herself momentarily melting, giving herself a chance to be softer if only this once. </p><p>\u201cYou will hear this.\u201d The pause is torturous and long, longer than she has.  He sees her struggle and steps into her, the small space so warm she feels herself give in to something she\u2019s tried to deny until this moment.</p><p>\u201cIf you die, so will I.\u201d </p><p>He visibly swallows, but doesn\u2019t otherwise respond. No chuckle or sardonic smile and somehow it makes it worse, his acknowledgment of her secrets makes it so much more painful. </p><p>\u201cYou must know that,\u201d she somehow finds a way to say it without bitterness. Her shoulders straighten, \u201cSo allow me this trespass, allow me this chance. I could not live without knowledge of you alive somewhere warm, tucked away by a hearth with a broody brow&hellip;\u201d Just the thought of his expression makes the tears form achingly in her throat, \u201cLet me keep you alive.\u201d </p><p>If it\u2019s possible for them to get closer he somehow finds a way, his leather protesting with each hesitant step. </p><p>Close to her he sees her own armor and Sam\u2019s voice trickles through the battle plans and doom that surrounds them, reminding him of the truth.</p><p>Aching fingers, wild and void of any thought reach forward and trace the lines of her leather tight at her ribs. Gods, if she is not as majestic as she is beautiful.</p><p>Her eyes flit from his stormy ones to his fingers that still trace her bodice, the air of the room tepid with melting facade.  She blinks trying to pull back up her mask, but when her mouth opens and she says his name it\u2019s so tortured and sad she knows he will hear every undertone of longing she\u2019s fought to submerge. </p><p>\u201cJon&hellip;\u201d</p><p>He grips her then, a gentle but steady hand on her waist. A gasp and moan released between them and then their bodies are pushed against the other, the beginning of hers molding into the ending of him; one flesh and neither of them react  in surprise. The rightness is a relief, a weight lifted before he goes out into the night.</p><p>\u201cCan I speak?\u201d He whispers at her chin, her perfect mouth open and hot breath in his face. </p><p>She nods her head, and swallows unable now to remember that anything else but this matters.</p><p>\u201cThe next time we see each other I\u2019ll tell you about my mother and what it means.\u201d</p><p>Then his hands move grazing her leather, arms and face. He pushes them back into her hair leaving no room for her to doubt, \u201cI promise.\u201d </p><p>She wets her lips and her brow furrows in confusion. Her eyes narrow and just as she\u2019s ready to question him, he shakes his head to stop her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says fingers light against her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t talk now.\u201d </p><h2>Do I think this will actually happen?
