Your parents not being dead but being pretty much as good as? They are literally walking corpses at this point, and he has Bella to thank for that.<br/>\nBut guess what, or who, Neville\u2019s boggart is? Not the crazy Bitch who torture his parents! No, its one of his TEACHERS. Someone who was supposed to nurture him, or at least encourage his improvement, is the thing Neville is the most afraid of! And you can\u2019t tell me it\u2019s just because Neville is a soft boy, because we all know that Severus Snape is a salty man who decided to take out his aggression on a literal child just because \u201chis Lily\u201d would still be alive if Neville was the chosen one.<br/>\nAnd if Neville did end up being the chosen one that Voldemort picked, Snape would not have CARED that Neville\u2019s parents died. Nope, as long as it wasnt Lily.<br/>\n6. You know who else had a terrible childhood? Harry Potter. Both Harry and Snape suffered abuse and neglect and isolation. They had terrible upbringings, and they BOTH suffered greatly because if it. <br/>\nSure, Harry made friends, people who gave him hope, almost immediately when he turned 11 and got to Hogwarts.<br/>\nBut guess what?

It\u2019s also my blog so I talk however I want, as long as I know I\u2019m not harming anyone<br>\n3. What that man felt for Lily was not love, it was obsession. He begged Voldemort to keep Lily safe. Only Lily, not James or Harry. <br>\nIdk about you but love means wanting the other person to be happy regardless of your own happiness. It means that you give yourself to the other person and you are willing to give more than you take. This also means you must already be a whole person by yourself and thus you shouldn\u2019t expect the person you love to fill in some \u201cmissing piece\u201d within you. <br>\nSnape did not care about her happiness. Had Lily lived, she would have been miserable with James and Harry dead. Say that Snape does end up \u201ccaring\u201d for her, what do you think would happen when she learns that Snape asked Voldemort to spare only her and not James or Harry? <br>\n4. Snape\u2019s literal motivation for fighting for the Light is because he was vindictive and wanted revenge on Voldemort for killing Lily. He wanted to find the only person who had a chance of defeating Voldemort, and if that meant fighting for the Light, he would do it.<br>\nSure, he\u2019s loyal to Dumbledore, but while some of it may be respect, he also owes Dumbledore hella for saving his life<br>\n5. Alright, asshole and abuser aren\u2019t synonyms, but both adjectives DO describe Severus Snape. <br>\nI know this has been cited many times, but let\u2019s talk about Neville Longbottom. This kid\u2019s parents were literally tortured into insanity by Bellatrix. He goes to visit them at St. Mungo\u2019s regularly, and can you imagine that trauma? Your parents not being dead but being pretty much as good as? They are literally walking corpses at this point, and he has Bella to thank for that.<br>\nBut guess what, or who, Neville\u2019s boggart is? Not the crazy Bitch who torture his parents! No, its one of his TEACHERS. Someone who was supposed to nurture him, or at least encourage his improvement, is the thing Neville is the most afraid of! And you can\u2019t tell me it\u2019s just because Neville is a soft boy, because we all know that Severus Snape is a salty man who decided to take out his aggression on a literal child just because \u201chis Lily\u201d would still be alive if Neville was the chosen one.<br>\nAnd if Neville did end up being the chosen one that Voldemort picked, Snape would not have CARED that Neville\u2019s parents died. Nope, as long as it wasnt Lily.<br>\n6. You know who else had a terrible childhood? Harry Potter. Both Harry and Snape suffered abuse and neglect and isolation. They had terrible upbringings, and they BOTH suffered greatly because if it. <br>\nSure, Harry made friends, people who gave him hope, almost immediately when he turned 11 and got to Hogwarts.<br>\nBut guess what? Snape had that too, by the age of 9! Lily was his hope, the one good thing that could help him.<br>\nAt Hogwarts, she stood up for him, even when he made mistakes. Eventualy, Snape made his decision to take the negativity in his life and turn it into more negativity by joining a genocidal cult bent on killing a group of people that Lily was part of.<br>\nHarry well could have become as bitter and cruel as Snape, but Snape could also have made the choice to, I don\u2019t know, not become a Death Eater?</p>\n\n<p>Lmao I\u2019ve reread and analyzed those books multiple times over 12 years.
