Here\u2019s some of mine,</p><h2><i><b>1. The \u2018King\u2019 of the Seven Kingdoms?</b></i></h2><p>Once the fighting is over, Westeros will need a leader to take it back to its old glory. But who will be that leader?\u00a0</p><p>If you read my last blog post, you would know that I mentioned about the possibilities of Cersei dying and the speculations regarding Dany\u2019s death and how she may fulfil the Nissa Nissa prophesy. I believe Cersei will die. And I believe that Dany will die, maybe in childbirth or she will be killed by Jon so that he could turn his sword into Lightbringer (if he is Azor Ahai), or maybe she\u2019ll fall fighting the Night King and become a wight! Maybe Jon would be forced to kill her before killing the Night King. That would surely be bittersweet. Not just because Jon would have to kill her but because she would surely fight back and try to kill him at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>But in the end, Jon will become King just like Robert Baratheon. Neither of them started their respective fights for the Throne. They started it for things that were way more important to them- Jon for survival and Robert for revenge. But like Robert before him, Jon would find himself in a position where he is the most viable choice. And I\u2019m pretty sure Jon would take over the helm because if there is one thing he doesn\u2019t run away from, it\u2019s leading. He became the Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch and then he became King in the North. He won\u2019t ask for it, but if the people of Westeros choose him, he won\u2019t disappoint them.\u00a0</p><p>Or you know, he could just take the title himself. He is the heir anyway.

Think about it, three dragons in the sky, hundreds of thousands of soldiers/wights and hundreds of ships bombarding the city. The fighting will be brutal and King\u2019s Landing may see its end. There are also speculations about the destruction of the Iron throne, either during the fighting or after it, just to finish off a major reason behind thousands of deaths over centuries of its existence.\u00a0</p><p>So what will happen\u00a0when Jon becomes King?</p><p>I want to believe that given both King\u2019s Landing and Winterfell would need\u00a0a major restoration after the war, Jon would choose Winterfell as his home and a place from where he\u2019ll do all the ruling.\u00a0</p><p>In the show, Jon has only been the King\u2019s Landing once in S7 while he has lived his entire life in the North and a major part of it back at Winterfell.

The North wanted independence when Robb was chosen King and they probably wanted it now as well before Jon bent the knee and gave up his title. It won&rsquo;t exactly be like independence but it would definitely help if someone from the North rules from the North.</p><p>And most of the royal families of the South would probably not see the end of the war to raise any major objections for the change of the capital.\u00a0The Lannisters would be dead, Tyrion may survive and maybe Cersei\u2019s child too\u00a0if she really is pregnant.

And I believe that Dany will die, maybe in childbirth or she will be killed by Jon so that he could turn his sword into Lightbringer (if he is Azor Ahai), or maybe she&rsquo;ll fall fighting the Night King and become a wight! Maybe Jon would be forced to kill her before killing the Night King. That would surely be bittersweet. Not just because Jon would have to kill her but because she would surely fight back and try to kill him at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the end, Jon will become King just like Robert Baratheon. Neither of them started their respective fights for the Throne. They started it for things that were way more important to them- Jon for survival and Robert for revenge. But like Robert before him, Jon would find himself in a position where he is the most viable choice. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure Jon would take over the helm because if there is one thing he doesn&rsquo;t run away from, it&rsquo;s leading. He became the Commander of the Night&rsquo;s Watch and then he became King in the North. He won&rsquo;t ask for it, but if the people of Westeros choose him, he won&rsquo;t disappoint them.&nbsp;</p><p>Or you know, he could just take the title himself. He is the heir anyway. But we know that won&rsquo;t happen.&nbsp;</p><h2><i><b>2. What about the Capital?&nbsp;&nbsp;[SPOILERS]</b></i></h2><p>Right now there is a lot of buzz surrounding the fighting scenes in S8. There was a picture which showed Winterfell in a horrendous condition, burning, and bodies lying one over the other like haystacks. There is a strong possibility that Winterfell would fall into the hands of the Night King and that the final battle for the dawn would continue in King&rsquo;s Landing, the current home of the Queen and the capital of Westeros.&nbsp;</p><p>But when the fighting is over, all that is left of King&rsquo;s Landing may just be ashes. Think about it, three dragons in the sky, hundreds of thousands of soldiers/wights and hundreds of ships bombarding the city. The fighting will be brutal and King&rsquo;s Landing may see its end. There are also speculations about the destruction of the Iron throne, either during the fighting or after it, just to finish off a major reason behind thousands of deaths over centuries of its existence.&nbsp;</p><p>So what will happen&nbsp;when Jon becomes King?</p><p>I want to believe that given both King&rsquo;s Landing and Winterfell would need&nbsp;a major restoration after the war, Jon would choose Winterfell as his home and a place from where he&rsquo;ll do all the ruling.&nbsp;</p><p>In the show, Jon has only been the King&rsquo;s Landing once in S7 while he has lived his entire life in the North and a major part of it back at Winterfell. We also know just how much it would mean to the Northerners to see a &lsquo;Northern&rsquo; King of the Seven Kingdoms (or six or five, whatever number is left) ruling from Winterfell. The North wanted independence when Robb was chosen King and they probably wanted it now as well before Jon bent the knee and gave up his title. It won&rsquo;t exactly be like independence but it would definitely help if someone from the North rules from the North.</p><p>And most of the royal families of the South would probably not see the end of the war to raise any major objections for the change of the capital.&nbsp;The Lannisters would be dead, Tyrion may survive and maybe Cersei&rsquo;s child too&nbsp;if she really is pregnant. But then again, the North is just as much away from King&rsquo;s Landing as King&rsquo;s Landing is from the North. So if the King wills it, I don&rsquo;t even see a reason for objections.</p><p>The North is the biggest kingdom amongst the seven and the closest to the things that lie beyond the wall. But after the Night King is defeated, the threat from beyond the wall will basically be none. The wildlings are now fighting and living around the rest of the people and I&rsquo;m sure they will stay south of the wall after the war as well. But if Jon becomes King, he&rsquo;ll be smart enough to know that it&rsquo;s best to restore the wall back to its old glory and keep the same protocol as before. Who knows, maybe the Night King has a backup plan? Maybe the dead will rise again someday. Jon will be clever enough to not underestimate the far North and the surprises it can present.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But to conclude this particular topic, I&rsquo;ll say that the show started at Winterfell and it may end at Winterfell too. I don&rsquo;t see a reason for it to not be so.</p><h2><b><i>3. Aegon Targaryen or Jon Snow?</i></b></h2><p>&ldquo;You are a Greyjoy. And you are a Stark,&rdquo; Jon told Theon.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon has lived as a bastard his entire life. But at times, he wanted to be a Stark, like his father and his brothers. But now we know who he really is and I&rsquo;m curious if he takes up his real name once the war is over. Will he make people call him Aegon?&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to make a prediction here and say that Jon will continue being &lsquo;Jon&rsquo; even if he becomes King because the Starks are the only family he has ever known and Ned Stark is the only man he has ever considered his father.&nbsp;</p><p>One fragment of history may change his lineage but it won&rsquo;t change his heart. And Jon Snow will always be a Stark in his heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are speculations regarding Arya and how she may leave Westeros once the war is won, and before leaving I can see her telling Jon something along the lines of,&nbsp;&ldquo;A man can choose whoever he wants to be. A man can take up whatever name he likes. A man can be anyone, or a man can be no one. But&nbsp; whatever you do, you&rsquo;ll always be a Stark to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If Dany gives Jon a baby or two before dying, what he can do to make sure the Targaryen name survives is to give the babies the Targaryen name.&nbsp;But I think Jon will always stay a Stark- to him and to the people around him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

To me they\u2019re the two most boring people on the show and putting them together is a snooze. And I understand that they have limited time but the whole thing felt so rushed to me. Idk, I feel like they could have done more but they made everything between them so serious and boring. I honestly feel like Yara and Dany had more chemistry in 3 minutes than Jon and Dany had in an entire season. That\u2019s just my opinion though, I know other people feel differently about Jon/Dany which is fine, whatever works for them. It just doesn\u2019t really appeal to me personally. </p>",

At first, you wanted to publish your interview with Viserys, but after Robb\u2019s outburst, you decided covering the band you saw last night would be more fun. Your mind couldn\u2019t forget that kiss. How rough it was. How hungry it made you.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d you heard from beside you. Robb Stark stood there with two cups of coffee watching you lick your lips while staring at your computer screen.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI\u2019m just really into my article.\u201d You explained, nodding your head entirely too much.</p><p>\u201cYeah? You sure?\u201d Robb said, holding back a laugh or two.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure,\u201d you took the second cup and stared at him. His light eyes didn\u2019t match any ocean or body of water. They were lovely to look at, and you wanted to drown yourself in them. His facial hair was well-kept and his curls on top of his head made you want to run your fingers through them regardless if he was your boss or not.</p><p>\u201cListen, you\u2019ve been doing a really great job lately. Your articles are really hitting some high numbers. I thought we could discuss you staying with us permanently,\u201d Robb smiled. You felt your joy bubble up inside of you and get the best of you. Your arms were around Robb before you could even register it.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! Like as a staff writer? Are you serious?\u201d you squealed. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! Yes! Yes! Yes!\u201d You jumped up and down in his arms, and Robb didn\u2019t let you go. He finally pulled away from you, still beaming. His million dollar smile was worth every second you stared at it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad!\u201d His smile still didn\u2019t fade. His happiness was so genuine that you felt it too.</p><p>\u201cSo, what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Robb pulled up a chair and started talking. \u201cYou\u2019ll still cover the Battle of the Bands. It\u2019s clear people like reading you. After that, we can decide what you like to write and what fits with us. You do get a raise, and it\u2019s decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds so wonderful! We should celebrate,\u201d you grabbed Robb\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cCelebrate? I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>After several speedy text messages, two phone calls, and an uber ride. Robb and you found yourselves at Sunspot. Renly walked in and greeted you both immediately.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the team!\u201d Renly gave you a big hug. \u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d fit in with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d you squealed. Out of the corner of your eye, you watched Loras clean the same glass over and over and over again. You bit your lip in excitement. Time to play your social chess again. You guided Renly over to Loras and sat down in your favorite bar stool.</p><p>\u201cRenly, have you met Loras? He\u2019s the one that makes your tacos.\u201d<br/>\u201cYou make my tacos?\u201d A smile graced Renly\u2019s face like he was given free ice cream. \u201cThey\u2019re so amazing!\u201d Loras touched the back of his neck, color coming to his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he sheepishly said. \u201cThere was this new recipe I wanted to try, but the kitchen won\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What kind?\u201d Renly\u2019s mouth started to salivate at the thought of new tacos. You chuckled and turned back to see Robb speaking with Margaery. As much as you loved your best friend, seeing her next to Robb made your skin crawl. You made your way between the two, bringing a slight frown to Margaery, and a great smile from Robb.</p><p>\u201cSee what I did?\u201d you wiggled your eyebrows at Margaery, gesturing to Loras. Margaery smiled at you, wiggling her eyebrows back.</p><p>\u201cYou and your social chess,\u201d she smirked.</p><p>\u201cSocial chess?\u201d Robb inquired. Margaery tossed back her hair.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really good at it. You could never tell what she\u2019s doing until you\u2019re caught in it. Y/N plays with people. She matches them up, gets revenge, and even flirts with you and you don\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know when she flirts with me,\u201d Robb stole a look. \u201cI like to flirt back when she lets me.\u201d You wanted to squeal, but you kept your emotions inside while Margaery and you shared a look. Margaery continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she pushes the envelope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t. Y/N isn\u2019t a bother to me,\u201d Robb shrugged and sipped at his beer. \u201cI like her around. I think she likes us too. I do remember you telling me you liked Stark boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, your brother Jon caught my eye. Then again, I can get distracted.\u201d You winked at Robb, feeling confident. He chuckled, matching the same energy as you. The afternoon went on smoothly. The five of you drinking and drinking until another Stark boy walked through the door. Jon\u2019s dark curls enchanted you every time you saw them. His big eyes and Henley shirt screamed at you while he sat down across from you.</p><p>\u201cFinished another set?\u201d Robb asked. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d Jon smiled and pointed at you.</p><p>\u201cEver since this one interviewed me, it\u2019s like I\u2019m playing at the fest. People coming and stuffing themselves anywhere they can fit! The bar owners gave me a bonus for attracting customers.\u201d Jon stole a swig of his brother\u2019s beer.</p><p>\u201cSee what happens when you get girls involved?\u201d Robb placed his arm behind you, around your shoulders. \u201cThey make everything better.\u201d You almost wanted to roll your eyes at the compliment, but you gave Robb a good nudge instead.<br/>\u201cCome on, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do! I had Renly write the Battle of the Bands all these years, and then you come along, and you bring new bands into the limelight, give my brother success, and you look cute doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now!\u201d Renly argued. \u201cI have fans! People read my shit too! And I also look cute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Loras mouthed to you, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI owe a lot to you today,\u201d Jon beamed at you. He looked to Robb and then back to you. \u201cHas Robb told you about the beach house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You turned to Robb. \u201cYou have a beach house?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur family has a beach house,\u201d Robb corrected.</p><p>\u201cWe should take her there,\u201d Jon suggested. \u201cHow would you like to go? It\u2019d be just a day. Robb can do without you for just a day.\u201d You looked to Robb and gave him your best, most innocent-wanting smile you could. Robb sighed, sitting back. You could smell his cologne on his chest.</p><p>\u201cAlright. One day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Thank you!\u201d You hugged Robb, holding him tighter than you thought you would. You could say you don\u2019t know your own strength, but you could also tell the truth. You hugged Robb like that because you could and you wanted to, but why spoil the fun?</p><p>You looked at Jon for a moment. He turned his head sharply away from both of you. He was quick to look at his phone for a distraction. He hid the sadness in his eyes with the reflection of Instagram scrolling. You smiled to yourself. He was jealous.</p><p>You let go of Robb who seemed a little sad that you let go, but he kept talking with Margaery. Renly and Loras sat closer and closer every minute that passed by. After a couple of more drinks, you felt the familiar buzz take over. It was if the \u2018party goblin\u2019 wanted to come out and play. You could feel her desires itch your brain. \u2018Go to the Fest.\u2019 \u2018Go make out with that dangerous boy from last night.\u2019 \u2018Do something stupid.\u2019</p><p>The hunger of drunk you became too much. You stood up from your seat and headed for the door. Wait. You stopped. Your heels turned right back around, and you marched yourself back to the table. Without explanation or any warning, you kissed Jon on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear something cute. You tell me when,\u201d you winked before you officially left Sunspot. The crowd was thickening on the streets due to the late night sets at the Battle of the Bands. You found yourself at a late night set.</p><p>The \u2018Bastard\u2019 flag caught your eye. A dead man on an unholy crucifix. People moshed around the center of the crowd. They pushed themselves around and laughed while people punched them in the face. The bright red light highlighted their cuts, nosebleeds, and their clothes. Your eyes directed you upward to the lead singer. His messy dark hair looked so soft. You wanted to run your fingers through it while he spat in your face. You could see his blue eyes from where you stood. You held your backstage pass close to your chest.</p><p>Time to do something stupid, indeed.</p><p>You took one step forward and felt yourself being dragged back. You turned to see who the hell was stopping you from kissing the bastard on stage. Black hair and a wicked smile greeted you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, that Scene reporter,\u201d Viserys said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u201d you smirked back.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your boyfriend at? Is he here with you?\u201d Viserys shouted, making sure you heard him. You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cRobb\u2019s not my boyfriend. He\u2019s my boss. I\u2019m here by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d his smile turned too delicious for you to handle. \u201cYou know, we never got to finish our interview.\u201d His head nodded towards the true backstage of the festival. The trailers where the bands stayed. The bastard\u2019s singing voice was tantalizing, but the offer from the dragon was much more fun. You saw his empty hand and took it for yourself.</p><p>\u201cLead the way, or you\u2019ll wake the dragon,\u201d you told him. Viserys\u2019 cocky smile made your knees a bit weak, but you followed him to the trailers. Some band members stood out and took cigarette breaks while others chilled right outside their trailers just listening to the music that boomed from the city park. Holding Viserys\u2019 hand was a much different experience than hugging Robb. Robb\u2019s grip easily let you go. Viserys kept a firm grip on you as he led the way to his band\u2019s trailer.</p><p>It was empty. You looked around to see if anyone was there or not until Viserys answered that question for you.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all at the Bloody Bastards show,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. They toured with us before. Really nice guys believe it or not.\u201d Viserys sat in the booth. He patted the seat next to him. You sat comfortably next to him. He smelled of cigarettes and booze, but you didn\u2019t mind as much. You must have smelled the same.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d you started. \u201cWhere did we leave off?\u201d Viserys shrugged, keeping his eyes on you.</p><p>\u201cWe can start up with anything the pretty lady asks,\u201d his smile was noted, but you focused more on his eyes. They dilated when they spoke about you.</p><p>You pushed a piece of hair behind your ear. \u201cWhy are you doing this? Don\u2019t you have a bajillion fans already?\u201d<br/>\u201cWe\u2019re not signed. We\u2019ve put out some albums, but it would be nice for someone to sign us. That, plus I like the competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like the competition? You think you have competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Viserys\u2019 face turned serious. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good bands out there. Bloody Bastards, for example. I had some money to get my band started. Ramsay\u2019s worked for everything he has. Then there\u2019s the famous song \u201cRains of Castamere\u2019, and of course there\u2019s that really cool folk band\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOceans Away,\u201d you told him. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of Theon Greyjoy.\u201d Viserys snapped his ring-covered fingers.</p><p>\u201cYes! Exactly. There\u2019s a lot of talent here, and I really, really enjoy winning.\u201dViserys leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can beat everyone and win this thing?\u201d you asked him honestly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you know, hm?\u201d you challenged him. You had the feeling he liked to be challenged. Viserys sat all the way back, taking you all in.</p><p>\u201cI know if I keep looking at you any longer, I\u2019m going to want to have a taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a snack?\u201d you bit your lip. Ah, here\u2019s the something stupid you were looking for. Viserys\u2019 fingers played with yours. His deep voice cut through all the noise outside.</p><p>\u201cExactly like a snack,\u201d Viserys\u2019 fingers played with edges of your shirt. \u201cYour boss won\u2019t like me spending time with you.\u201d Your buzzed mind answered something quick.</p><p>\u201cWho says he tells me what to do?\u201d You went in for it first. Your lips crashed against his and moved. You were going to control him now. Viserys moved his leg to allow you to come closer to him. His hands placed themselves at your hips. He kissed you back with as much passion as you gave him. His tongue slipped inside your mouth and moved around. He tasted like a sin. Someone you weren\u2019t supposed to kiss at all.</p><p>You ran your fingers through his hair and climbed into his lap. His hand ran up your thigh. His grip grew tight every inch that it touched. He wanted you as his, and he was going to get it. Viserys reached his hand up your shirt. His warm hand shocked your skin. Goosebumps trailed behind his touch. He reached for the fabric of your bra until you both heard the door.</p><p>The trailer door opened to one of Viserys bandmates dragging another girl inside with her. Both of them gasped to see you and Viserys together.</p><p>\u201cViz! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d she giggled. He waved it off. You wanted to move off of him, but Viserys kept his arms around you.</p><p>\u201cGo on, have fun,\u201d he nodded to the back of the bus. \u201cBe safe, Lori!\u201d Both of the girls giggled themselves past you and you quickly heard them moaning.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go,\u201d you slowly moved off of him. Viserys followed you outside the trailer. Your back was against the outside wall while Viserys tucked his fingers under your chin.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll come back another time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you behave,\u201d you teased while playing with the collar of his shirt. That sinful smirk came back naturally to him like music did.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll behave. I tend to be naughty around girls like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls who leave me hungry,\u201d Viserys kissed you once more. It was softer and slower than the one in the trailer. He took his time moving his lips against yours. Once he let you go, you already missed his warmth. You turned around and made your long trek home.</p><p>Note to Self: Leave them hungry every time.</p><p>\n\nTaglist: \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\">@angelicshinigami</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\">@sugarwastaken</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\">@carilov09</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\">@i-theredqueen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\">@trashpandabarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\">@loki-0fasgard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTK_N1sd2Ovi4iUtKbHOCw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTK_N1sd2Ovi4iUtKbHOCw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTK_N1sd2Ovi4iUtKbHOCw\">@boltonblade</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\">@affabletimelady</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a>\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">\n\n(To be added to the taglist, only ask friend!

At first, you wanted to publish your interview with Viserys, but after Robb\u2019s outburst, you decided covering the band you saw last night would be more fun. Your mind couldn\u2019t forget that kiss. How rough it was. How hungry it made you.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d you heard from beside you. Robb Stark stood there with two cups of coffee watching you lick your lips while staring at your computer screen.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\u2019m just really into my article.\u201d You explained, nodding your head entirely too much.</p><p>\u201cYeah? You sure?\u201d Robb said, holding back a laugh or two.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure,\u201d you took the second cup and stared at him. His light eyes didn\u2019t match any ocean or body of water. They were lovely to look at, and you wanted to drown yourself in them. His facial hair was well-kept and his curls on top of his head made you want to run your fingers through them regardless if he was your boss or not.</p><p>\u201cListen, you\u2019ve been doing a really great job lately. Your articles are really hitting some high numbers. I thought we could discuss you staying with us permanently,\u201d Robb smiled. You felt your joy bubble up inside of you and get the best of you. Your arms were around Robb before you could even register it.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! Like as a staff writer? Are you serious?\u201d you squealed. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! Yes! Yes! Yes!\u201d You jumped up and down in his arms, and Robb didn\u2019t let you go. He finally pulled away from you, still beaming. His million dollar smile was worth every second you stared at it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad!\u201d His smile still didn\u2019t fade. His happiness was so genuine that you felt it too.</p><p>\u201cSo, what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Robb pulled up a chair and started talking. \u201cYou\u2019ll still cover the Battle of the Bands. It\u2019s clear people like reading you. After that, we can decide what you like to write and what fits with us. You do get a raise, and it\u2019s decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds so wonderful! We should celebrate,\u201d you grabbed Robb\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cCelebrate? I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>After several speedy text messages, two phone calls, and an uber ride. Robb and you found yourselves at Sunspot. Renly walked in and greeted you both immediately.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the team!\u201d Renly gave you a big hug. \u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d fit in with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d you squealed. Out of the corner of your eye, you watched Loras clean the same glass over and over and over again. You bit your lip in excitement. Time to play your social chess again. You guided Renly over to Loras and sat down in your favorite bar stool.</p><p>\u201cRenly, have you met Loras? He\u2019s the one that makes your tacos.\u201d<br>\u201cYou make my tacos?\u201d A smile graced Renly\u2019s face like he was given free ice cream. \u201cThey\u2019re so amazing!\u201d Loras touched the back of his neck, color coming to his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he sheepishly said. \u201cThere was this new recipe I wanted to try, but the kitchen won\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What kind?\u201d Renly\u2019s mouth started to salivate at the thought of new tacos. You chuckled and turned back to see Robb speaking with Margaery. As much as you loved your best friend, seeing her next to Robb made your skin crawl. You made your way between the two, bringing a slight frown to Margaery, and a great smile from Robb.</p><p>\u201cSee what I did?\u201d you wiggled your eyebrows at Margaery, gesturing to Loras. Margaery smiled at you, wiggling her eyebrows back.</p><p>\u201cYou and your social chess,\u201d she smirked.</p><p>\u201cSocial chess?\u201d Robb inquired. Margaery tossed back her hair.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really good at it. You could never tell what she\u2019s doing until you\u2019re caught in it. Y/N plays with people. She matches them up, gets revenge, and even flirts with you and you don\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know when she flirts with me,\u201d Robb stole a look. \u201cI like to flirt back when she lets me.\u201d You wanted to squeal, but you kept your emotions inside while Margaery and you shared a look. Margaery continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she pushes the envelope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t. Y/N isn\u2019t a bother to me,\u201d Robb shrugged and sipped at his beer. \u201cI like her around. I think she likes us too. I do remember you telling me you liked Stark boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, your brother Jon caught my eye. Then again, I can get distracted.\u201d You winked at Robb, feeling confident. He chuckled, matching the same energy as you. The afternoon went on smoothly. The five of you drinking and drinking until another Stark boy walked through the door. Jon\u2019s dark curls enchanted you every time you saw them. His big eyes and Henley shirt screamed at you while he sat down across from you.</p><p>\u201cFinished another set?\u201d Robb asked. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d Jon smiled and pointed at you.</p><p>\u201cEver since this one interviewed me, it\u2019s like I\u2019m playing at the fest. People coming and stuffing themselves anywhere they can fit! The bar owners gave me a bonus for attracting customers.\u201d Jon stole a swig of his brother\u2019s beer.</p><p>\u201cSee what happens when you get girls involved?\u201d Robb placed his arm behind you, around your shoulders. \u201cThey make everything better.\u201d You almost wanted to roll your eyes at the compliment, but you gave Robb a good nudge instead.<br>\u201cCome on, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do! I had Renly write the Battle of the Bands all these years, and then you come along, and you bring new bands into the limelight, give my brother success, and you look cute doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now!\u201d Renly argued. \u201cI have fans! People read my shit too! And I also look cute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Loras mouthed to you, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI owe a lot to you today,\u201d Jon beamed at you. He looked to Robb and then back to you. \u201cHas Robb told you about the beach house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You turned to Robb. \u201cYou have a beach house?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur family has a beach house,\u201d Robb corrected.</p><p>\u201cWe should take her there,\u201d Jon suggested. \u201cHow would you like to go? It\u2019d be just a day. Robb can do without you for just a day.\u201d You looked to Robb and gave him your best, most innocent-wanting smile you could. Robb sighed, sitting back. You could smell his cologne on his chest.</p><p>\u201cAlright. One day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Thank you!\u201d You hugged Robb, holding him tighter than you thought you would. You could say you don\u2019t know your own strength, but you could also tell the truth. You hugged Robb like that because you could and you wanted to, but why spoil the fun?</p><p>You looked at Jon for a moment. He turned his head sharply away from both of you. He was quick to look at his phone for a distraction. He hid the sadness in his eyes with the reflection of Instagram scrolling. You smiled to yourself. He was jealous.</p><p>You let go of Robb who seemed a little sad that you let go, but he kept talking with Margaery. Renly and Loras sat closer and closer every minute that passed by. After a couple of more drinks, you felt the familiar buzz take over. It was if the \u2018party goblin\u2019 wanted to come out and play. You could feel her desires itch your brain. \u2018Go to the Fest.\u2019 \u2018Go make out with that dangerous boy from last night.\u2019 \u2018Do something stupid.\u2019</p><p>The hunger of drunk you became too much. You stood up from your seat and headed for the door. Wait. You stopped. Your heels turned right back around, and you marched yourself back to the table. Without explanation or any warning, you kissed Jon on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear something cute. You tell me when,\u201d you winked before you officially left Sunspot. The crowd was thickening on the streets due to the late night sets at the Battle of the Bands. You found yourself at a late night set.</p><p>The \u2018Bastard\u2019 flag caught your eye. A dead man on an unholy crucifix. People moshed around the center of the crowd. They pushed themselves around and laughed while people punched them in the face. The bright red light highlighted their cuts, nosebleeds, and their clothes. Your eyes directed you upward to the lead singer. His messy dark hair looked so soft. You wanted to run your fingers through it while he spat in your face. You could see his blue eyes from where you stood. You held your backstage pass close to your chest.</p><p>Time to do something stupid, indeed.</p><p>You took one step forward and felt yourself being dragged back. You turned to see who the hell was stopping you from kissing the bastard on stage. Black hair and a wicked smile greeted you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, that Scene reporter,\u201d Viserys said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u201d you smirked back.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your boyfriend at? Is he here with you?\u201d Viserys shouted, making sure you heard him. You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cRobb\u2019s not my boyfriend. He\u2019s my boss. I\u2019m here by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d his smile turned too delicious for you to handle. \u201cYou know, we never got to finish our interview.\u201d His head nodded towards the true backstage of the festival. The trailers where the bands stayed. The bastard\u2019s singing voice was tantalizing, but the offer from the dragon was much more fun. You saw his empty hand and took it for yourself.</p><p>\u201cLead the way, or you\u2019ll wake the dragon,\u201d you told him. Viserys\u2019 cocky smile made your knees a bit weak, but you followed him to the trailers. Some band members stood out and took cigarette breaks while others chilled right outside their trailers just listening to the music that boomed from the city park. Holding Viserys\u2019 hand was a much different experience than hugging Robb. Robb\u2019s grip easily let you go. Viserys kept a firm grip on you as he led the way to his band\u2019s trailer.</p><p>It was empty. You looked around to see if anyone was there or not until Viserys answered that question for you.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all at the Bloody Bastards show,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. They toured with us before. Really nice guys believe it or not.\u201d Viserys sat in the booth. He patted the seat next to him. You sat comfortably next to him. He smelled of cigarettes and booze, but you didn\u2019t mind as much. You must have smelled the same.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d you started. \u201cWhere did we leave off?\u201d Viserys shrugged, keeping his eyes on you.</p><p>\u201cWe can start up with anything the pretty lady asks,\u201d his smile was noted, but you focused more on his eyes. They dilated when they spoke about you.</p><p>You pushed a piece of hair behind your ear. \u201cWhy are you doing this? Don\u2019t you have a bajillion fans already?\u201d<br>\u201cWe\u2019re not signed. We\u2019ve put out some albums, but it would be nice for someone to sign us. That, plus I like the competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like the competition? You think you have competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Viserys\u2019 face turned serious. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good bands out there. Bloody Bastards, for example. I had some money to get my band started. Ramsay\u2019s worked for everything he has. Then there\u2019s the famous song \u201cRains of Castamere\u2019, and of course there\u2019s that really cool folk band\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOceans Away,\u201d you told him. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of Theon Greyjoy.\u201d Viserys snapped his ring-covered fingers.</p><p>\u201cYes! Exactly. There\u2019s a lot of talent here, and I really, really enjoy winning.\u201dViserys leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can beat everyone and win this thing?\u201d you asked him honestly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you know, hm?\u201d you challenged him. You had the feeling he liked to be challenged. Viserys sat all the way back, taking you all in.</p><p>\u201cI know if I keep looking at you any longer, I\u2019m going to want to have a taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a snack?\u201d you bit your lip. Ah, here\u2019s the something stupid you were looking for. Viserys\u2019 fingers played with yours. His deep voice cut through all the noise outside.</p><p>\u201cExactly like a snack,\u201d Viserys\u2019 fingers played with edges of your shirt. \u201cYour boss won\u2019t like me spending time with you.\u201d Your buzzed mind answered something quick.</p><p>\u201cWho says he tells me what to do?\u201d You went in for it first. Your lips crashed against his and moved. You were going to control him now. Viserys moved his leg to allow you to come closer to him. His hands placed themselves at your hips. He kissed you back with as much passion as you gave him. His tongue slipped inside your mouth and moved around. He tasted like a sin. Someone you weren\u2019t supposed to kiss at all.</p><p>You ran your fingers through his hair and climbed into his lap. His hand ran up your thigh. His grip grew tight every inch that it touched. He wanted you as his, and he was going to get it. Viserys reached his hand up your shirt. His warm hand shocked your skin. Goosebumps trailed behind his touch. He reached for the fabric of your bra until you both heard the door.</p><p>The trailer door opened to one of Viserys bandmates dragging another girl inside with her. Both of them gasped to see you and Viserys together.</p><p>\u201cViz! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d she giggled. He waved it off. You wanted to move off of him, but Viserys kept his arms around you.</p><p>\u201cGo on, have fun,\u201d he nodded to the back of the bus. \u201cBe safe, Lori!\u201d Both of the girls giggled themselves past you and you quickly heard them moaning.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go,\u201d you slowly moved off of him. Viserys followed you outside the trailer. Your back was against the outside wall while Viserys tucked his fingers under your chin.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll come back another time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you behave,\u201d you teased while playing with the collar of his shirt. That sinful smirk came back naturally to him like music did.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll behave. I tend to be naughty around girls like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls who leave me hungry,\u201d Viserys kissed you once more. It was softer and slower than the one in the trailer. He took his time moving his lips against yours. Once he let you go, you already missed his warmth. You turned around and made your long trek home.</p><p>Note to Self: Leave them hungry every time.</p><p>\n\nTaglist: \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\">@angelicshinigami</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\">@sugarwastaken</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\">@carilov09</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\">@i-theredqueen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\">@trashpandabarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\">@loki-0fasgard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTK_N1sd2Ovi4iUtKbHOCw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTK_N1sd2Ovi4iUtKbHOCw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTK_N1sd2Ovi4iUtKbHOCw\">@boltonblade</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\">@affabletimelady</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a>\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">\n\n(To be added to the taglist, only ask friend!

At first, you wanted to publish your interview with Viserys, but after Robb\u2019s outburst, you decided covering the band you saw last night would be more fun. Your mind couldn\u2019t forget that kiss. How rough it was. How hungry it made you.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d you heard from beside you. Robb Stark stood there with two cups of coffee watching you lick your lips while staring at your computer screen.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\u2019m just really into my article.\u201d You explained, nodding your head entirely too much.</p><p>\u201cYeah? You sure?\u201d Robb said, holding back a laugh or two.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure,\u201d you took the second cup and stared at him. His light eyes didn\u2019t match any ocean or body of water. They were lovely to look at, and you wanted to drown yourself in them. His facial hair was well-kept and his curls on top of his head made you want to run your fingers through them regardless if he was your boss or not.</p><p>\u201cListen, you\u2019ve been doing a really great job lately. Your articles are really hitting some high numbers. I thought we could discuss you staying with us permanently,\u201d Robb smiled. You felt your joy bubble up inside of you and get the best of you. Your arms were around Robb before you could even register it.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! Like as a staff writer? Are you serious?\u201d you squealed. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! Yes! Yes! Yes!\u201d You jumped up and down in his arms, and Robb didn\u2019t let you go. He finally pulled away from you, still beaming. His million dollar smile was worth every second you stared at it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad!\u201d His smile still didn\u2019t fade. His happiness was so genuine that you felt it too.</p><p>\u201cSo, what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Robb pulled up a chair and started talking. \u201cYou\u2019ll still cover the Battle of the Bands. It\u2019s clear people like reading you. After that, we can decide what you like to write and what fits with us. You do get a raise, and it\u2019s decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds so wonderful! We should celebrate,\u201d you grabbed Robb\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cCelebrate? I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>After several speedy text messages, two phone calls, and an uber ride. Robb and you found yourselves at Sunspot. Renly walked in and greeted you both immediately.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the team!\u201d Renly gave you a big hug. \u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d fit in with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d you squealed. Out of the corner of your eye, you watched Loras clean the same glass over and over and over again. You bit your lip in excitement. Time to play your social chess again. You guided Renly over to Loras and sat down in your favorite bar stool.</p><p>\u201cRenly, have you met Loras? He\u2019s the one that makes your tacos.\u201d<br>\u201cYou make my tacos?\u201d A smile graced Renly\u2019s face like he was given free ice cream. \u201cThey\u2019re so amazing!\u201d Loras touched the back of his neck, color coming to his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he sheepishly said. \u201cThere was this new recipe I wanted to try, but the kitchen won\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What kind?\u201d Renly\u2019s mouth started to salivate at the thought of new tacos. You chuckled and turned back to see Robb speaking with Margaery. As much as you loved your best friend, seeing her next to Robb made your skin crawl. You made your way between the two, bringing a slight frown to Margaery, and a great smile from Robb.</p><p>\u201cSee what I did?\u201d you wiggled your eyebrows at Margaery, gesturing to Loras. Margaery smiled at you, wiggling her eyebrows back.</p><p>\u201cYou and your social chess,\u201d she smirked.</p><p>\u201cSocial chess?\u201d Robb inquired. Margaery tossed back her hair.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really good at it. You could never tell what she\u2019s doing until you\u2019re caught in it. Y/N plays with people. She matches them up, gets revenge, and even flirts with you and you don\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know when she flirts with me,\u201d Robb stole a look. \u201cI like to flirt back when she lets me.\u201d You wanted to squeal, but you kept your emotions inside while Margaery and you shared a look. Margaery continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she pushes the envelope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t. Y/N isn\u2019t a bother to me,\u201d Robb shrugged and sipped at his beer. \u201cI like her around. I think she likes us too. I do remember you telling me you liked Stark boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, your brother Jon caught my eye. Then again, I can get distracted.\u201d You winked at Robb, feeling confident. He chuckled, matching the same energy as you. The afternoon went on smoothly. The five of you drinking and drinking until another Stark boy walked through the door. Jon\u2019s dark curls enchanted you every time you saw them. His big eyes and Henley shirt screamed at you while he sat down across from you.</p><p>\u201cFinished another set?\u201d Robb asked. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d Jon smiled and pointed at you.</p><p>\u201cEver since this one interviewed me, it\u2019s like I\u2019m playing at the fest. People coming and stuffing themselves anywhere they can fit! The bar owners gave me a bonus for attracting customers.\u201d Jon stole a swig of his brother\u2019s beer.</p><p>\u201cSee what happens when you get girls involved?\u201d Robb placed his arm behind you, around your shoulders. \u201cThey make everything better.\u201d You almost wanted to roll your eyes at the compliment, but you gave Robb a good nudge instead.<br>\u201cCome on, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do! I had Renly write the Battle of the Bands all these years, and then you come along, and you bring new bands into the limelight, give my brother success, and you look cute doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now!\u201d Renly argued. \u201cI have fans! People read my shit too! And I also look cute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Loras mouthed to you, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI owe a lot to you today,\u201d Jon beamed at you. He looked to Robb and then back to you. \u201cHas Robb told you about the beach house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You turned to Robb. \u201cYou have a beach house?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur family has a beach house,\u201d Robb corrected.</p><p>\u201cWe should take her there,\u201d Jon suggested. \u201cHow would you like to go? It\u2019d be just a day. Robb can do without you for just a day.\u201d You looked to Robb and gave him your best, most innocent-wanting smile you could. Robb sighed, sitting back. You could smell his cologne on his chest.</p><p>\u201cAlright. One day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Thank you!\u201d You hugged Robb, holding him tighter than you thought you would. You could say you don\u2019t know your own strength, but you could also tell the truth. You hugged Robb like that because you could and you wanted to, but why spoil the fun?</p><p>You looked at Jon for a moment. He turned his head sharply away from both of you. He was quick to look at his phone for a distraction. He hid the sadness in his eyes with the reflection of Instagram scrolling. You smiled to yourself. He was jealous.</p><p>You let go of Robb who seemed a little sad that you let go, but he kept talking with Margaery. Renly and Loras sat closer and closer every minute that passed by. After a couple of more drinks, you felt the familiar buzz take over. It was if the \u2018party goblin\u2019 wanted to come out and play. You could feel her desires itch your brain. \u2018Go to the Fest.\u2019 \u2018Go make out with that dangerous boy from last night.\u2019 \u2018Do something stupid.\u2019</p><p>The hunger of drunk you became too much. You stood up from your seat and headed for the door. Wait. You stopped. Your heels turned right back around, and you marched yourself back to the table. Without explanation or any warning, you kissed Jon on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear something cute. You tell me when,\u201d you winked before you officially left Sunspot. The crowd was thickening on the streets due to the late night sets at the Battle of the Bands. You found yourself at a late night set.</p><p>The \u2018Bastard\u2019 flag caught your eye. A dead man on an unholy crucifix. People moshed around the center of the crowd. They pushed themselves around and laughed while people punched them in the face. The bright red light highlighted their cuts, nosebleeds, and their clothes. Your eyes directed you upward to the lead singer. His messy dark hair looked so soft. You wanted to run your fingers through it while he spat in your face. You could see his blue eyes from where you stood. You held your backstage pass close to your chest.</p><p>Time to do something stupid, indeed.</p><p>You took one step forward and felt yourself being dragged back. You turned to see who the hell was stopping you from kissing the bastard on stage. Black hair and a wicked smile greeted you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, that Scene reporter,\u201d Viserys said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u201d you smirked back.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your boyfriend at? Is he here with you?\u201d Viserys shouted, making sure you heard him. You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cRobb\u2019s not my boyfriend. He\u2019s my boss. I\u2019m here by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d his smile turned too delicious for you to handle. \u201cYou know, we never got to finish our interview.\u201d His head nodded towards the true backstage of the festival. The trailers where the bands stayed. The bastard\u2019s singing voice was tantalizing, but the offer from the dragon was much more fun. You saw his empty hand and took it for yourself.</p><p>\u201cLead the way, or you\u2019ll wake the dragon,\u201d you told him. Viserys\u2019 cocky smile made your knees a bit weak, but you followed him to the trailers. Some band members stood out and took cigarette breaks while others chilled right outside their trailers just listening to the music that boomed from the city park. Holding Viserys\u2019 hand was a much different experience than hugging Robb. Robb\u2019s grip easily let you go. Viserys kept a firm grip on you as he led the way to his band\u2019s trailer.</p><p>It was empty. You looked around to see if anyone was there or not until Viserys answered that question for you.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all at the Bloody Bastards show,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. They toured with us before. Really nice guys believe it or not.\u201d Viserys sat in the booth. He patted the seat next to him. You sat comfortably next to him. He smelled of cigarettes and booze, but you didn\u2019t mind as much. You must have smelled the same.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d you started. \u201cWhere did we leave off?\u201d Viserys shrugged, keeping his eyes on you.</p><p>\u201cWe can start up with anything the pretty lady asks,\u201d his smile was noted, but you focused more on his eyes. They dilated when they spoke about you.</p><p>You pushed a piece of hair behind your ear. \u201cWhy are you doing this? Don\u2019t you have a bajillion fans already?\u201d<br>\u201cWe\u2019re not signed. We\u2019ve put out some albums, but it would be nice for someone to sign us. That, plus I like the competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like the competition? You think you have competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Viserys\u2019 face turned serious. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good bands out there. Bloody Bastards, for example. I had some money to get my band started. Ramsay\u2019s worked for everything he has. Then there\u2019s the famous song \u201cRains of Castamere\u2019, and of course there\u2019s that really cool folk band\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOceans Away,\u201d you told him. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of Theon Greyjoy.\u201d Viserys snapped his ring-covered fingers.</p><p>\u201cYes! Exactly. There\u2019s a lot of talent here, and I really, really enjoy winning.\u201dViserys leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can beat everyone and win this thing?\u201d you asked him honestly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you know, hm?\u201d you challenged him. You had the feeling he liked to be challenged. Viserys sat all the way back, taking you all in.</p><p>\u201cI know if I keep looking at you any longer, I\u2019m going to want to have a taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a snack?\u201d you bit your lip. Ah, here\u2019s the something stupid you were looking for. Viserys\u2019 fingers played with yours. His deep voice cut through all the noise outside.</p><p>\u201cExactly like a snack,\u201d Viserys\u2019 fingers played with edges of your shirt. \u201cYour boss won\u2019t like me spending time with you.\u201d Your buzzed mind answered something quick.</p><p>\u201cWho says he tells me what to do?\u201d You went in for it first. Your lips crashed against his and moved. You were going to control him now. Viserys moved his leg to allow you to come closer to him. His hands placed themselves at your hips. He kissed you back with as much passion as you gave him. His tongue slipped inside your mouth and moved around. He tasted like a sin. Someone you weren\u2019t supposed to kiss at all.</p><p>You ran your fingers through his hair and climbed into his lap. His hand ran up your thigh. His grip grew tight every inch that it touched. He wanted you as his, and he was going to get it. Viserys reached his hand up your shirt. His warm hand shocked your skin. Goosebumps trailed behind his touch. He reached for the fabric of your bra until you both heard the door.</p><p>The trailer door opened to one of Viserys bandmates dragging another girl inside with her. Both of them gasped to see you and Viserys together.</p><p>\u201cViz! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d she giggled. He waved it off. You wanted to move off of him, but Viserys kept his arms around you.</p><p>\u201cGo on, have fun,\u201d he nodded to the back of the bus. \u201cBe safe, Lori!\u201d Both of the girls giggled themselves past you and you quickly heard them moaning.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go,\u201d you slowly moved off of him. Viserys followed you outside the trailer. Your back was against the outside wall while Viserys tucked his fingers under your chin.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll come back another time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you behave,\u201d you teased while playing with the collar of his shirt. That sinful smirk came back naturally to him like music did.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll behave. I tend to be naughty around girls like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls who leave me hungry,\u201d Viserys kissed you once more. It was softer and slower than the one in the trailer. He took his time moving his lips against yours. Once he let you go, you already missed his warmth. You turned around and made your long trek home.</p><p>Note to Self: Leave them hungry every time.</p><p>\n\nTaglist: \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\">@angelicshinigami</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVPN6PQ_Yd8IdxU3ILIhYA\">@sugarwastaken</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZ-AkHYKPUdU0OnThdxBsA\">@carilov09</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCzMEs6j5xlRlLNlsx0Pa5A\">@i-theredqueen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrp-Q9BB3efLEqHARUJcK8g\">@trashpandabarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmpW7OsPvL7beYPUenlWAw\">@loki-0fasgard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTK_N1sd2Ovi4iUtKbHOCw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTK_N1sd2Ovi4iUtKbHOCw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTK_N1sd2Ovi4iUtKbHOCw\">@boltonblade</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu8vSVsYHLeKnuSR-GDVy_g\">@affabletimelady</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a>\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">\n\n(To be added to the taglist, only ask friend!

At first, you wanted to publish your interview with Viserys, but after Robb&rsquo;s outburst, you decided covering the band you saw last night would be more fun. Your mind couldn&rsquo;t forget that kiss. How rough it was. How hungry it made you.</p><p>&ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; you heard from beside you. Robb Stark stood there with two cups of coffee watching you lick your lips while staring at your computer screen.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just really into my article.&rdquo; You explained, nodding your head entirely too much.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? You sure?&rdquo; Robb said, holding back a laugh or two.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; you took the second cup and stared at him. His light eyes didn&rsquo;t match any ocean or body of water. They were lovely to look at, and you wanted to drown yourself in them. His facial hair was well-kept and his curls on top of his head made you want to run your fingers through them regardless if he was your boss or not.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, you&rsquo;ve been doing a really great job lately. Your articles are really hitting some high numbers. I thought we could discuss you staying with us permanently,&rdquo; Robb smiled. You felt your joy bubble up inside of you and get the best of you. Your arms were around Robb before you could even register it.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god! Like as a staff writer? Are you serious?&rdquo; you squealed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing! Yes! Yes! Yes!&rdquo; You jumped up and down in his arms, and Robb didn&rsquo;t let you go. He finally pulled away from you, still beaming. His million dollar smile was worth every second you stared at it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; His smile still didn&rsquo;t fade. His happiness was so genuine that you felt it too.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what happens now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Robb pulled up a chair and started talking. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll still cover the Battle of the Bands. It&rsquo;s clear people like reading you. After that, we can decide what you like to write and what fits with us. You do get a raise, and it&rsquo;s decent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds so wonderful! We should celebrate,&rdquo; you grabbed Robb&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Celebrate? I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</p><p>After several speedy text messages, two phone calls, and an uber ride. Robb and you found yourselves at Sunspot. Renly walked in and greeted you both immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to the team!&rdquo; Renly gave you a big hug. &ldquo;I had a feeling you&rsquo;d fit in with us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; you squealed. Out of the corner of your eye, you watched Loras clean the same glass over and over and over again. You bit your lip in excitement. Time to play your social chess again. You guided Renly over to Loras and sat down in your favorite bar stool.</p><p>&ldquo;Renly, have you met Loras? He&rsquo;s the one that makes your tacos.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You make my tacos?&rdquo; A smile graced Renly&rsquo;s face like he was given free ice cream. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so amazing!&rdquo; Loras touched the back of his neck, color coming to his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he sheepishly said. &ldquo;There was this new recipe I wanted to try, but the kitchen won&rsquo;t let me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? What kind?&rdquo; Renly&rsquo;s mouth started to salivate at the thought of new tacos. You chuckled and turned back to see Robb speaking with Margaery. As much as you loved your best friend, seeing her next to Robb made your skin crawl. You made your way between the two, bringing a slight frown to Margaery, and a great smile from Robb.</p><p>&ldquo;See what I did?&rdquo; you wiggled your eyebrows at Margaery, gesturing to Loras. Margaery smiled at you, wiggling her eyebrows back.</p><p>&ldquo;You and your social chess,&rdquo; she smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Social chess?&rdquo; Robb inquired. Margaery tossed back her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s really good at it. You could never tell what she&rsquo;s doing until you&rsquo;re caught in it. Y/N plays with people. She matches them up, gets revenge, and even flirts with you and you don&rsquo;t even know it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I know when she flirts with me,&rdquo; Robb stole a look. &ldquo;I like to flirt back when she lets me.&rdquo; You wanted to squeal, but you kept your emotions inside while Margaery and you shared a look. Margaery continued.</p><p>&ldquo;And what if she pushes the envelope?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t. Y/N isn&rsquo;t a bother to me,&rdquo; Robb shrugged and sipped at his beer. &ldquo;I like her around. I think she likes us too. I do remember you telling me you liked Stark boys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do, your brother Jon caught my eye. Then again, I can get distracted.&rdquo; You winked at Robb, feeling confident. He chuckled, matching the same energy as you. The afternoon went on smoothly. The five of you drinking and drinking until another Stark boy walked through the door. Jon&rsquo;s dark curls enchanted you every time you saw them. His big eyes and Henley shirt screamed at you while he sat down across from you.</p><p>&ldquo;Finished another set?&rdquo; Robb asked. &ldquo;How did it go?&rdquo; Jon smiled and pointed at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Ever since this one interviewed me, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m playing at the fest. People coming and stuffing themselves anywhere they can fit! The bar owners gave me a bonus for attracting customers.&rdquo; Jon stole a swig of his brother&rsquo;s beer.</p><p>&ldquo;See what happens when you get girls involved?&rdquo; Robb placed his arm behind you, around your shoulders. &ldquo;They make everything better.&rdquo; You almost wanted to roll your eyes at the compliment, but you gave Robb a good nudge instead.<br />&ldquo;Come on, you don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do! I had Renly write the Battle of the Bands all these years, and then you come along, and you bring new bands into the limelight, give my brother success, and you look cute doing it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey now!&rdquo; Renly argued. &ldquo;I have fans! People read my shit too! And I also look cute!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He does,&rdquo; Loras mouthed to you, laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;I owe a lot to you today,&rdquo; Jon beamed at you. He looked to Robb and then back to you. &ldquo;Has Robb told you about the beach house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You turned to Robb. &ldquo;You have a beach house?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our family has a beach house,&rdquo; Robb corrected.</p><p>&ldquo;We should take her there,&rdquo; Jon suggested. &ldquo;How would you like to go? It&rsquo;d be just a day. Robb can do without you for just a day.&rdquo; You looked to Robb and gave him your best, most innocent-wanting smile you could. Robb sighed, sitting back. You could smell his cologne on his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. One day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Thank you!&rdquo; You hugged Robb, holding him tighter than you thought you would. You could say you don&rsquo;t know your own strength, but you could also tell the truth. You hugged Robb like that because you could and you wanted to, but why spoil the fun?</p><p>You looked at Jon for a moment. He turned his head sharply away from both of you. He was quick to look at his phone for a distraction. He hid the sadness in his eyes with the reflection of Instagram scrolling. You smiled to yourself. He was jealous.</p><p>You let go of Robb who seemed a little sad that you let go, but he kept talking with Margaery. Renly and Loras sat closer and closer every minute that passed by. After a couple of more drinks, you felt the familiar buzz take over. It was if the &lsquo;party goblin&rsquo; wanted to come out and play. You could feel her desires itch your brain. &lsquo;Go to the Fest.&rsquo; &lsquo;Go make out with that dangerous boy from last night.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do something stupid.&rsquo;</p><p>The hunger of drunk you became too much. You stood up from your seat and headed for the door. Wait. You stopped. Your heels turned right back around, and you marched yourself back to the table. Without explanation or any warning, you kissed Jon on the cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear something cute. You tell me when,&rdquo; you winked before you officially left Sunspot. The crowd was thickening on the streets due to the late night sets at the Battle of the Bands. You found yourself at a late night set.</p><p>The &lsquo;Bastard&rsquo; flag caught your eye. A dead man on an unholy crucifix. People moshed around the center of the crowd. They pushed themselves around and laughed while people punched them in the face. The bright red light highlighted their cuts, nosebleeds, and their clothes. Your eyes directed you upward to the lead singer. His messy dark hair looked so soft. You wanted to run your fingers through it while he spat in your face. You could see his blue eyes from where you stood. You held your backstage pass close to your chest.</p><p>Time to do something stupid, indeed.</p><p>You took one step forward and felt yourself being dragged back. You turned to see who the hell was stopping you from kissing the bastard on stage. Black hair and a wicked smile greeted you.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, that Scene reporter,&rdquo; Viserys said. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know?&rdquo; you smirked back.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your boyfriend at? Is he here with you?&rdquo; Viserys shouted, making sure you heard him. You shook your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Robb&rsquo;s not my boyfriend. He&rsquo;s my boss. I&rsquo;m here by myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; his smile turned too delicious for you to handle. &ldquo;You know, we never got to finish our interview.&rdquo; His head nodded towards the true backstage of the festival. The trailers where the bands stayed. The bastard&rsquo;s singing voice was tantalizing, but the offer from the dragon was much more fun. You saw his empty hand and took it for yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Lead the way, or you&rsquo;ll wake the dragon,&rdquo; you told him. Viserys&rsquo; cocky smile made your knees a bit weak, but you followed him to the trailers. Some band members stood out and took cigarette breaks while others chilled right outside their trailers just listening to the music that boomed from the city park. Holding Viserys&rsquo; hand was a much different experience than hugging Robb. Robb&rsquo;s grip easily let you go. Viserys kept a firm grip on you as he led the way to his band&rsquo;s trailer.</p><p>It was empty. You looked around to see if anyone was there or not until Viserys answered that question for you.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all at the Bloody Bastards show,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re friends. They toured with us before. Really nice guys believe it or not.&rdquo; Viserys sat in the booth. He patted the seat next to him. You sat comfortably next to him. He smelled of cigarettes and booze, but you didn&rsquo;t mind as much. You must have smelled the same.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; you started. &ldquo;Where did we leave off?&rdquo; Viserys shrugged, keeping his eyes on you.</p><p>&ldquo;We can start up with anything the pretty lady asks,&rdquo; his smile was noted, but you focused more on his eyes. They dilated when they spoke about you.</p><p>You pushed a piece of hair behind your ear. &ldquo;Why are you doing this? Don&rsquo;t you have a bajillion fans already?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not signed. We&rsquo;ve put out some albums, but it would be nice for someone to sign us. That, plus I like the competition.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You like the competition? You think you have competition?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Viserys&rsquo; face turned serious. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of good bands out there. Bloody Bastards, for example. I had some money to get my band started. Ramsay&rsquo;s worked for everything he has. Then there&rsquo;s the famous song &ldquo;Rains of Castamere&rsquo;, and of course there&rsquo;s that really cool folk band&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oceans Away,&rdquo; you told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of Theon Greyjoy.&rdquo; Viserys snapped his ring-covered fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Exactly. There&rsquo;s a lot of talent here, and I really, really enjoy winning.&rdquo;Viserys leaned forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think you can beat everyone and win this thing?&rdquo; you asked him honestly.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think. I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What else do you know, hm?&rdquo; you challenged him. You had the feeling he liked to be challenged. Viserys sat all the way back, taking you all in.</p><p>&ldquo;I know if I keep looking at you any longer, I&rsquo;m going to want to have a taste.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like a snack?&rdquo; you bit your lip. Ah, here&rsquo;s the something stupid you were looking for. Viserys&rsquo; fingers played with yours. His deep voice cut through all the noise outside.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly like a snack,&rdquo; Viserys&rsquo; fingers played with edges of your shirt. &ldquo;Your boss won&rsquo;t like me spending time with you.&rdquo; Your buzzed mind answered something quick.</p><p>&ldquo;Who says he tells me what to do?&rdquo; You went in for it first. Your lips crashed against his and moved. You were going to control him now. Viserys moved his leg to allow you to come closer to him. His hands placed themselves at your hips. He kissed you back with as much passion as you gave him. His tongue slipped inside your mouth and moved around. He tasted like a sin. Someone you weren&rsquo;t supposed to kiss at all.</p><p>You ran your fingers through his hair and climbed into his lap. His hand ran up your thigh. His grip grew tight every inch that it touched. He wanted you as his, and he was going to get it. Viserys reached his hand up your shirt. His warm hand shocked your skin. Goosebumps trailed behind his touch. He reached for the fabric of your bra until you both heard the door.</p><p>The trailer door opened to one of Viserys bandmates dragging another girl inside with her. Both of them gasped to see you and Viserys together.</p><p>&ldquo;Viz! I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; she giggled. He waved it off. You wanted to move off of him, but Viserys kept his arms around you.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on, have fun,&rdquo; he nodded to the back of the bus. &ldquo;Be safe, Lori!&rdquo; Both of the girls giggled themselves past you and you quickly heard them moaning.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I should go,&rdquo; you slowly moved off of him. Viserys followed you outside the trailer. Your back was against the outside wall while Viserys tucked his fingers under your chin.</p><p>&ldquo;Promise me you&rsquo;ll come back another time?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Only if you behave,&rdquo; you teased while playing with the collar of his shirt. That sinful smirk came back naturally to him like music did.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll behave.
