He\u2019ll get money, have fun with kids, and get a view of Lucas, a hip hop dancer who Eliott can\u2019t take his eyes off of. The problem, is that Eliott is a pan disaster. </i></p><p><i>OR a strangers-to friends- to lovers au</i></p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>To say that Eliott\u2019s excited, would be an understatement. It would probably the biggest understatement of the century. He finally got a job at the rec center, thanks to his best friend, Sofiane, and can make some good money. He was told to meet Sofiane at the rec center at 17:50, so he could know how to set up the parties the kids had and actually get to know some of the kids themselves. </p><!-- more --><p>He decided to show up a bit early, not wanting to make a bad impression, obviously. It was his first job, after all, and he wasn\u2019t going to risk anything and everything by being late. He went inside and waited downstairs, just wandering around, exploring what was down there, having forgotten due to not coming here in a year. </p><p>There was music suddenly blaring through the speakers in the dance studio, and Eliott would\u2019ve lied if he said he wasn\u2019t even the littlest bit intrigued. And you can\u2019t blame him, he\u2019s naturally curious; always has and always will be. At first he thought it might\u2019ve been Sofiane, since there was some time to kill before having to meet up. He walked closer to the studio and when he was near the entrance, popped his head inside. And-</p><p>Wow. Oh wow. </p><p>Eliott couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. The guy in the studio was amazing. He was dancing as if it would be the last time he got to do so. Dancing as if he would die if he didn\u2019t continue. It was as if it was the only thing the guy wanted to do and it showed; Eliott was mesmerized. Completely and utterly mesmerized. </p><p>Their movements flowed and connected throughout the piece. And even though it was hip hop, no move was done without delicacy. Eliott has never been as entranced as he was right now. He was breath taken; not even Sofiane\u2019s dancing made him feel this way, and that was saying something. Eliott couldn\u2019t even look away, and thank god the guy didn\u2019t notice him, because it would sure be awkward if he stopped dancing anytime soon. Luckily, he didn\u2019t; he just kept dancing his heart out and poured his soul out while doing so. At least, that\u2019s what Eliott thought he was doing.</p><p>Eliott wanted to know the guy, needed to know more than his back half and his short height, since that was all Eliott could see from where he was standing. He needed to get closer, Eliott decided. So he took a step, and froze, not wanting to be caught. His view wasn\u2019t a whole lot better, but he\u2019d take what he could get. He could see his hair in much more detail. It reminded him of a lion\u2019s mane; soft, perturbing, loud, and messy. It looked good on him though, and all Eliott wanted to do was run his fingers through it. He didn\u2019t even know what time it was anymore, not really caring, preferring to watch the talented boy in front of him. He just hoped not too much time passed. </p><p>Contrary to what Eliott hoped, time passed too fast apparently, because Eliott was being called by Sofiane. </p><p>\u201cEli! Time to show you around and get you started,\u201d he said, smiling like there\u2019s no tomorrow. </p><p>Eliott barely heard him, his ears too busy flooding with appreciation while still being stunned out of his mind by the boy dancing with such grace, finesse, and power all at once. How does one even do all that?</p><p>It took Sofiane walking towards him and waving an arm in front of Eliott to get him to snap out of the his trance and get his attention. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\u201d Eliott bit his lip, with flushed cheeks showing his embarrassment all over.</p><p>Sofiane chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI said it\u2019s time to show you around and get you started. Are you ready now?\u201d</p><p>Eliott nodded and gave a timid smile. \u201cI\u2019m ready. Show me around then, Sof.\u201d</p><p>They went back upstairs and started making their way to one of the rooms that was being set up for a birthday party the next day. They were walking in comfortable silence, the type of silence that doesn\u2019t need to be broken. But after a minute, Sofiane broke it with a subject he knew would perk Eliott\u2019s interest. </p><p>\u201cI can tell you got a bit distracted by one of our best dancers, Lucas.\u201d Sofiane teased. \u201cHe\u2019s good isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Huh. Lucas, Eliott thought. That name sounds pretty good. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awesome, bro. I can\u2019t even begin to put in into words. It\u2019s like he\u2019s caught up in his own world in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he is. For how good he is it\u2019s scary to realize that he actually got into it pretty recently, only two years ago. A lot of shit\u2019s gone down for him during that time, that\u2019s not mine to say, but he uses dance as his escape, as do a lot of people. He comes here almost everyday and is a super cool guy.\u201d</p><p>There was just something about Lucas, from the beginning, that made Eliott feel like he needed him to play a role in his life. And with this new information, Eliott wants nothing more than to get to know Lucas. Talk with him, tease him, share things with him, smoke with him, laugh with him, just about anything to be near his vicinity. </p><p>\u201cDoes he go to our school?\u201d Eliott wondered. </p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, he does. He\u2019s in second year though, so maybe that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t seen him before.\u201d</p><p>Eliott nods and begins imagining what Lucas\u2019 face looks like. He couldn\u2019t see it before, and was more than anxious to see what it looked like. But for now, he needed to get settled in with his job, which was why he was in the rec center in the first place. </p><p>\u2022~\u2022~\u2022</p><p>His job doesn\u2019t seem too difficult, and looked quite fun, actually. The kids he met were super sweet and energetic, which helped to calm down some of his nerves thinking that said the kids wouldn\u2019t like him. </p><p>He and Sofiane went back downstairs to grab some water, getting thirsty after chasing around the children, and sat down on the floor, backs against the wall. </p><p>They were talking about everything and nothing, when Lucas walked out of the dance room. </p><p>\u201cHey, Sofiane,\u201d Lucas greeted. </p><p>The boys hadn\u2019t noticed him till then, and when Eliott looked up, he realized it was dumb to take a sip of water right then. It ended up getting spit out of his mouth when his eyes locked with Lucas\u2019. He began choking. </p><p>He didn\u2019t see Sofiane standing up to get paper towels and Lucas walking towards him, hitting his back to help get some oxygen back in. He was entranced yet again by Lucas. Not by his dancing this time, but by his eyes. </p><p>God, his eyes. </p><p>They were blue, a blue you could only find in the deepest lengths of the ocean. They were beautiful and big, as if they were capable of devouring someone- devouring someone into another dimension, one filled with even more of that blue hue in his eyes. And Eliott wanted to be the one getting swallowed whole from them. They all in all, were the most gorgeous eyes he had ever seen. </p><p>You see, Eliott has always been a very perceptive and observant person, and can see details almost no one else can see. He likes to use this tool whenever he can. And now was one of those moments. At first glance, Lucas\u2019 eyes seemed to carry lightheartedness, fun, and happiness. But when Eliott ventured further, he could see them carry something else. Something hidden under layers and layers of that said lightness and happiness, almost as if trying to cover something up. As if he was wearing a mask for everyone to see. Maybe that\u2019s what Sofiane meant when saying he\u2019d been through a lot of shit. And from what Eliott could tell, maybe even more than everyone thought. </p><p>Eliott decided that he wanted to see him without that mask, without those top layers, wanting only to see the real Lucas. The true Lucas whose eyes reflect how he really feels sometimes. He wants to be there for him in ways other people couldn\u2019t because they couldn\u2019t see it as clearly as Eliott could. </p><p>But he was getting ahead of himself. He needed to stop choking first. </p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, he snapped out of it and reentered the real world. He began to hear what Lucas was saying to him. </p><p>\u201cHey. Breath in and out. Steady your breath.\u201d Lucas said, still hitting his back. </p><p>Sofiane came back with some paper towels and began to clean up the watery mess that Eliott made. </p><p>Eliott followed Lucas\u2019 instructions and after a few minutes, came back to normal. </p><p>\u201cThanks, for uh- for helping me out I mean.\u201d Eliott says. </p><p>\u201cNo problem. It looked like you needed saving, so here I am, your Prince Charming coming to the rescue.\u201d he teased. A light flush made its way to Eliott\u2019s cheeks when he noticed that he had been staring at him for the past minute without saying anything. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Eliott started, blinking out of his daze, \u201cIt\u2019s just that, wow. Your face is uh- Your eyes are- you just look really- wow. That\u2019s all.\u201d God, that was a terrible start. Was that even a sentence? </p><p>Lucas raised his brow, confused, but eventually seemed to know what he meant, and chuckled, bringing his hand to rest above his chin. </p><p>\u201cSo my face made you spit your water out\u2026 because you thought it was pretty? I\u2019ll take that as a compliment, I guess.\u201d Lucas smirked and Eliott\u2019s face was suddenly as red as a tomato and hot all over. </p><p>\u201cUm I didn\u2019t mean-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo take backs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eliott was lost. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take back what you said. And besides, your face isn\u2019t that bad either. It\u2019s quite nice if you ask me.\u201d Lucas winked, and flashed a toothy smile that made Eliott want to embarrass himself even more just to see it again. </p><p>Lucas then proceeded to ask Sofiane if he needed any help cleaning the mess, and when Sofiane said he had it handled, Lucas took it upon himself to sit down on the floor, taking Sofiane\u2019s spot. </p><p>After a while, the shorter of the two spoke up. \u201cI haven\u2019t introduced myself yet. I\u2019m Lucas. Lucas Lallemant.\u201d He held out his hand, gesturing for Eliott to take it and shake it. </p><p>\u201cUm. Eliott. Demaury. Eliott Demaury. That\u2019s me.\u201d He let out a nervous chuckle and latched onto Lucas\u2019 hand like a leech. He then began to shake it a bit too vigorously and continued that action for about fifteen seconds. </p><p>\u201cAs much as I like a firm, solid handshake, I think you\u2019re overdoing it a bit, dude.\u201d Lucas laughed. Sofiane joined in on the laughter as well, watching their interaction from where he was, cleaning up the floor.</p><p>Eliott ducked his head down. \u201cSorry about that. You probably think that I\u2019m weird now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve probably freaked you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you haven\u2019t. Sure, you\u2019re a little weird, but I find it quite cute.\u201d Lucas gave him a small grin.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Eliott couldn\u2019t believe his ears.</p><p>\u201cReally. And besides, aren\u2019t we all a little weird anyways? I know that I am.\u201d His face faltered for a second, before regaining his grin. \u201cAnd plus, do you think I\u2019d be willing to share this with just anyone?\u201d Lucas pulls out a joint and lighter from his bag. </p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d He lit it up, took a drag, and held it out for Eliott. \u201cHere. Take a drag.\u201d</p><p>He took the joint from Lucas and followed his orders. </p><p>\u2022~\u2022~\u2022</p><p>They sat in silence for a while, just passing the joint back and forth. It was far from awkward and Eliott couldn\u2019t have been happier. He was smiling, feeling the haze affect the weed gave him. </p><p>Sofiane was long gone by now, saying he had to go meet up with Imane. </p><p>He sneaked a peak at Lucas, who had his head leaned back, against the wall. His eyes were closed and he looked relaxed. He looked like he finally got a break. While observing him, Eliott saw how apparent his dark circles were. How hadn\u2019t he seen them before?</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by a loud ringtone. Lucas snapped his eyes open, grabbed his phone, and looked panicked when he answered. </p><p>\u201cHello? Why haven\u2019t you answered me? I\u2019ve been trying to get a hold of you for days. You can\u2019t just go rogue like that, okay?\u201d His mood quickly changed to angry. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to ask how you are, I don\u2019t fucking care! I\u2019m about to be late this month and you haven\u2019t-\u201d He looked panicked again. \u201cHello?\u201d He puts his phone up. \u201cGod fucking dammit.\u201d He mutters. He runs a hand through his hair and takes a sharp breath. </p><p>\u201cYou okay over there?\u201d Eliott asks. </p><p>\u201cUh, yes. Fine. Listen, sorry to leave you like this, but I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Eliott tried to hide the fact that he was a bit disappointed. It didn\u2019t really work. </p><p>Lucas\u2019 face softened and he looked him in the eyes. \u201cI usually come here everyday and stay in the studio room to dance. Stop by to say hi when you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>Eliott smiled. \u201cOkay, will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He paused. \u201cBye, Eliott.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Lucas was gone. Eliott knew there was something going on, but didn\u2019t want to push Lucas into telling him. It didn\u2019t change the fact that he was still worried though. </p><p>\u2022~\u2022~\u2022</p><p>That night, Eliott dreamt of a certain blue eyed boy with crazy hair. A boy he didn\u2019t know was dreaming about him too. </p><p>***</p><p>Author\u2019s note: this is my first series work and I\u2019m writing along as I go.

He was told to meet Sofiane at the rec center at 17:50, so he could know how to set up the parties the kids had and actually get to know some of the kids themselves. </p>[[MORE]]<p>He decided to show up a bit early, not wanting to make a bad impression, obviously. It was his first job, after all, and he wasn\u2019t going to risk anything and everything by being late. He went inside and waited downstairs, just wandering around, exploring what was down there, having forgotten due to not coming here in a year. </p><p>There was music suddenly blaring through the speakers in the dance studio, and Eliott would\u2019ve lied if he said he wasn\u2019t even the littlest bit intrigued. And you can\u2019t blame him, he\u2019s naturally curious; always has and always will be. At first he thought it might\u2019ve been Sofiane, since there was some time to kill before having to meet up. He walked closer to the studio and when he was near the entrance, popped his head inside. And-</p><p>Wow. Oh wow. </p><p>Eliott couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. The guy in the studio was amazing. He was dancing as if it would be the last time he got to do so. Dancing as if he would die if he didn\u2019t continue. It was as if it was the only thing the guy wanted to do and it showed; Eliott was mesmerized. Completely and utterly mesmerized. </p><p>Their movements flowed and connected throughout the piece. And even though it was hip hop, no move was done without delicacy. Eliott has never been as entranced as he was right now. He was breath taken; not even Sofiane\u2019s dancing made him feel this way, and that was saying something. Eliott couldn\u2019t even look away, and thank god the guy didn\u2019t notice him, because it would sure be awkward if he stopped dancing anytime soon. Luckily, he didn\u2019t; he just kept dancing his heart out and poured his soul out while doing so. At least, that\u2019s what Eliott thought he was doing.</p><p>Eliott wanted to know the guy, needed to know more than his back half and his short height, since that was all Eliott could see from where he was standing. He needed to get closer, Eliott decided. So he took a step, and froze, not wanting to be caught. His view wasn\u2019t a whole lot better, but he\u2019d take what he could get. He could see his hair in much more detail. It reminded him of a lion\u2019s mane; soft, perturbing, loud, and messy. It looked good on him though, and all Eliott wanted to do was run his fingers through it. He didn\u2019t even know what time it was anymore, not really caring, preferring to watch the talented boy in front of him. He just hoped not too much time passed. </p><p>Contrary to what Eliott hoped, time passed too fast apparently, because Eliott was being called by Sofiane. </p><p>\u201cEli! Time to show you around and get you started,\u201d he said, smiling like there\u2019s no tomorrow. </p><p>Eliott barely heard him, his ears too busy flooding with appreciation while still being stunned out of his mind by the boy dancing with such grace, finesse, and power all at once. How does one even do all that?</p><p>It took Sofiane walking towards him and waving an arm in front of Eliott to get him to snap out of the his trance and get his attention. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\u201d Eliott bit his lip, with flushed cheeks showing his embarrassment all over.</p><p>Sofiane chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI said it\u2019s time to show you around and get you started. Are you ready now?\u201d</p><p>Eliott nodded and gave a timid smile. \u201cI\u2019m ready. Show me around then, Sof.\u201d</p><p>They went back upstairs and started making their way to one of the rooms that was being set up for a birthday party the next day. They were walking in comfortable silence, the type of silence that doesn\u2019t need to be broken. But after a minute, Sofiane broke it with a subject he knew would perk Eliott\u2019s interest. </p><p>\u201cI can tell you got a bit distracted by one of our best dancers, Lucas.\u201d Sofiane teased. \u201cHe\u2019s good isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Huh. Lucas, Eliott thought. That name sounds pretty good. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awesome, bro. I can\u2019t even begin to put in into words. It\u2019s like he\u2019s caught up in his own world in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he is. For how good he is it\u2019s scary to realize that he actually got into it pretty recently, only two years ago. A lot of shit\u2019s gone down for him during that time, that\u2019s not mine to say, but he uses dance as his escape, as do a lot of people. He comes here almost everyday and is a super cool guy.\u201d</p><p>There was just something about Lucas, from the beginning, that made Eliott feel like he needed him to play a role in his life. And with this new information, Eliott wants nothing more than to get to know Lucas. Talk with him, tease him, share things with him, smoke with him, laugh with him, just about anything to be near his vicinity. </p><p>\u201cDoes he go to our school?\u201d Eliott wondered. </p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, he does. He\u2019s in second year though, so maybe that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t seen him before.\u201d</p><p>Eliott nods and begins imagining what Lucas\u2019 face looks like. He couldn\u2019t see it before, and was more than anxious to see what it looked like. But for now, he needed to get settled in with his job, which was why he was in the rec center in the first place. </p><p>\u2022~\u2022~\u2022</p><p>His job doesn\u2019t seem too difficult, and looked quite fun, actually. The kids he met were super sweet and energetic, which helped to calm down some of his nerves thinking that said the kids wouldn\u2019t like him. </p><p>He and Sofiane went back downstairs to grab some water, getting thirsty after chasing around the children, and sat down on the floor, backs against the wall. </p><p>They were talking about everything and nothing, when Lucas walked out of the dance room. </p><p>\u201cHey, Sofiane,\u201d Lucas greeted. </p><p>The boys hadn\u2019t noticed him till then, and when Eliott looked up, he realized it was dumb to take a sip of water right then. It ended up getting spit out of his mouth when his eyes locked with Lucas\u2019. He began choking. </p><p>He didn\u2019t see Sofiane standing up to get paper towels and Lucas walking towards him, hitting his back to help get some oxygen back in. He was entranced yet again by Lucas. Not by his dancing this time, but by his eyes. </p><p>God, his eyes. </p><p>They were blue, a blue you could only find in the deepest lengths of the ocean. They were beautiful and big, as if they were capable of devouring someone- devouring someone into another dimension, one filled with even more of that blue hue in his eyes. And Eliott wanted to be the one getting swallowed whole from them. They all in all, were the most gorgeous eyes he had ever seen. </p><p>You see, Eliott has always been a very perceptive and observant person, and can see details almost no one else can see. He likes to use this tool whenever he can. And now was one of those moments. At first glance, Lucas\u2019 eyes seemed to carry lightheartedness, fun, and happiness. But when Eliott ventured further, he could see them carry something else. Something hidden under layers and layers of that said lightness and happiness, almost as if trying to cover something up. As if he was wearing a mask for everyone to see. Maybe that\u2019s what Sofiane meant when saying he\u2019d been through a lot of shit. And from what Eliott could tell, maybe even more than everyone thought. </p><p>Eliott decided that he wanted to see him without that mask, without those top layers, wanting only to see the real Lucas. The true Lucas whose eyes reflect how he really feels sometimes. He wants to be there for him in ways other people couldn\u2019t because they couldn\u2019t see it as clearly as Eliott could. </p><p>But he was getting ahead of himself. He needed to stop choking first. </p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, he snapped out of it and reentered the real world. He began to hear what Lucas was saying to him. </p><p>\u201cHey. Breath in and out. Steady your breath.\u201d Lucas said, still hitting his back. </p><p>Sofiane came back with some paper towels and began to clean up the watery mess that Eliott made. </p><p>Eliott followed Lucas\u2019 instructions and after a few minutes, came back to normal. </p><p>\u201cThanks, for uh- for helping me out I mean.\u201d Eliott says. </p><p>\u201cNo problem.

He\u2019ll get money, have fun with kids, and get a view of Lucas, a hip hop dancer who Eliott can\u2019t take his eyes off of. The problem, is that Eliott is a pan disaster. </i></p><p><i>OR a strangers-to friends- to lovers au</i></p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>To say that Eliott\u2019s excited, would be an understatement. It would probably the biggest understatement of the century. He finally got a job at the rec center, thanks to his best friend, Sofiane, and can make some good money. He was told to meet Sofiane at the rec center at 17:50, so he could know how to set up the parties the kids had and actually get to know some of the kids themselves. </p>[[MORE]]<p>He decided to show up a bit early, not wanting to make a bad impression, obviously. It was his first job, after all, and he wasn\u2019t going to risk anything and everything by being late. He went inside and waited downstairs, just wandering around, exploring what was down there, having forgotten due to not coming here in a year. </p><p>There was music suddenly blaring through the speakers in the dance studio, and Eliott would\u2019ve lied if he said he wasn\u2019t even the littlest bit intrigued. And you can\u2019t blame him, he\u2019s naturally curious; always has and always will be. At first he thought it might\u2019ve been Sofiane, since there was some time to kill before having to meet up. He walked closer to the studio and when he was near the entrance, popped his head inside. And-</p><p>Wow. Oh wow. </p><p>Eliott couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. The guy in the studio was amazing. He was dancing as if it would be the last time he got to do so. Dancing as if he would die if he didn\u2019t continue. It was as if it was the only thing the guy wanted to do and it showed; Eliott was mesmerized. Completely and utterly mesmerized. </p><p>Their movements flowed and connected throughout the piece. And even though it was hip hop, no move was done without delicacy. Eliott has never been as entranced as he was right now. He was breath taken; not even Sofiane\u2019s dancing made him feel this way, and that was saying something. Eliott couldn\u2019t even look away, and thank god the guy didn\u2019t notice him, because it would sure be awkward if he stopped dancing anytime soon. Luckily, he didn\u2019t; he just kept dancing his heart out and poured his soul out while doing so. At least, that\u2019s what Eliott thought he was doing.</p><p>Eliott wanted to know the guy, needed to know more than his back half and his short height, since that was all Eliott could see from where he was standing. He needed to get closer, Eliott decided. So he took a step, and froze, not wanting to be caught. His view wasn\u2019t a whole lot better, but he\u2019d take what he could get. He could see his hair in much more detail. It reminded him of a lion\u2019s mane; soft, perturbing, loud, and messy. It looked good on him though, and all Eliott wanted to do was run his fingers through it. He didn\u2019t even know what time it was anymore, not really caring, preferring to watch the talented boy in front of him. He just hoped not too much time passed. </p><p>Contrary to what Eliott hoped, time passed too fast apparently, because Eliott was being called by Sofiane. </p><p>\u201cEli! Time to show you around and get you started,\u201d he said, smiling like there\u2019s no tomorrow. </p><p>Eliott barely heard him, his ears too busy flooding with appreciation while still being stunned out of his mind by the boy dancing with such grace, finesse, and power all at once. How does one even do all that?</p><p>It took Sofiane walking towards him and waving an arm in front of Eliott to get him to snap out of the his trance and get his attention. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\u201d Eliott bit his lip, with flushed cheeks showing his embarrassment all over.</p><p>Sofiane chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI said it\u2019s time to show you around and get you started. Are you ready now?\u201d</p><p>Eliott nodded and gave a timid smile. \u201cI\u2019m ready. Show me around then, Sof.\u201d</p><p>They went back upstairs and started making their way to one of the rooms that was being set up for a birthday party the next day. They were walking in comfortable silence, the type of silence that doesn\u2019t need to be broken. But after a minute, Sofiane broke it with a subject he knew would perk Eliott\u2019s interest. </p><p>\u201cI can tell you got a bit distracted by one of our best dancers, Lucas.\u201d Sofiane teased. \u201cHe\u2019s good isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Huh. Lucas, Eliott thought. That name sounds pretty good. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awesome, bro. I can\u2019t even begin to put in into words. It\u2019s like he\u2019s caught up in his own world in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he is. For how good he is it\u2019s scary to realize that he actually got into it pretty recently, only two years ago. A lot of shit\u2019s gone down for him during that time, that\u2019s not mine to say, but he uses dance as his escape, as do a lot of people. He comes here almost everyday and is a super cool guy.\u201d</p><p>There was just something about Lucas, from the beginning, that made Eliott feel like he needed him to play a role in his life. And with this new information, Eliott wants nothing more than to get to know Lucas. Talk with him, tease him, share things with him, smoke with him, laugh with him, just about anything to be near his vicinity. </p><p>\u201cDoes he go to our school?\u201d Eliott wondered. </p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, he does. He\u2019s in second year though, so maybe that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t seen him before.\u201d</p><p>Eliott nods and begins imagining what Lucas\u2019 face looks like. He couldn\u2019t see it before, and was more than anxious to see what it looked like. But for now, he needed to get settled in with his job, which was why he was in the rec center in the first place. </p><p>\u2022~\u2022~\u2022</p><p>His job doesn\u2019t seem too difficult, and looked quite fun, actually. The kids he met were super sweet and energetic, which helped to calm down some of his nerves thinking that said the kids wouldn\u2019t like him. </p><p>He and Sofiane went back downstairs to grab some water, getting thirsty after chasing around the children, and sat down on the floor, backs against the wall. </p><p>They were talking about everything and nothing, when Lucas walked out of the dance room. </p><p>\u201cHey, Sofiane,\u201d Lucas greeted. </p><p>The boys hadn\u2019t noticed him till then, and when Eliott looked up, he realized it was dumb to take a sip of water right then. It ended up getting spit out of his mouth when his eyes locked with Lucas\u2019. He began choking. </p><p>He didn\u2019t see Sofiane standing up to get paper towels and Lucas walking towards him, hitting his back to help get some oxygen back in. He was entranced yet again by Lucas. Not by his dancing this time, but by his eyes. </p><p>God, his eyes. </p><p>They were blue, a blue you could only find in the deepest lengths of the ocean. They were beautiful and big, as if they were capable of devouring someone- devouring someone into another dimension, one filled with even more of that blue hue in his eyes. And Eliott wanted to be the one getting swallowed whole from them. They all in all, were the most gorgeous eyes he had ever seen. </p><p>You see, Eliott has always been a very perceptive and observant person, and can see details almost no one else can see. He likes to use this tool whenever he can. And now was one of those moments. At first glance, Lucas\u2019 eyes seemed to carry lightheartedness, fun, and happiness. But when Eliott ventured further, he could see them carry something else. Something hidden under layers and layers of that said lightness and happiness, almost as if trying to cover something up. As if he was wearing a mask for everyone to see. Maybe that\u2019s what Sofiane meant when saying he\u2019d been through a lot of shit. And from what Eliott could tell, maybe even more than everyone thought. </p><p>Eliott decided that he wanted to see him without that mask, without those top layers, wanting only to see the real Lucas. The true Lucas whose eyes reflect how he really feels sometimes. He wants to be there for him in ways other people couldn\u2019t because they couldn\u2019t see it as clearly as Eliott could. </p><p>But he was getting ahead of himself. He needed to stop choking first. </p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, he snapped out of it and reentered the real world. He began to hear what Lucas was saying to him. </p><p>\u201cHey. Breath in and out. Steady your breath.\u201d Lucas said, still hitting his back. </p><p>Sofiane came back with some paper towels and began to clean up the watery mess that Eliott made. </p><p>Eliott followed Lucas\u2019 instructions and after a few minutes, came back to normal. </p><p>\u201cThanks, for uh- for helping me out I mean.\u201d Eliott says. </p><p>\u201cNo problem. It looked like you needed saving, so here I am, your Prince Charming coming to the rescue.\u201d he teased. A light flush made its way to Eliott\u2019s cheeks when he noticed that he had been staring at him for the past minute without saying anything. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Eliott started, blinking out of his daze, \u201cIt\u2019s just that, wow. Your face is uh- Your eyes are- you just look really- wow. That\u2019s all.\u201d God, that was a terrible start. Was that even a sentence? </p><p>Lucas raised his brow, confused, but eventually seemed to know what he meant, and chuckled, bringing his hand to rest above his chin. </p><p>\u201cSo my face made you spit your water out\u2026 because you thought it was pretty? I\u2019ll take that as a compliment, I guess.\u201d Lucas smirked and Eliott\u2019s face was suddenly as red as a tomato and hot all over. </p><p>\u201cUm I didn\u2019t mean-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo take backs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eliott was lost. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take back what you said. And besides, your face isn\u2019t that bad either. It\u2019s quite nice if you ask me.\u201d Lucas winked, and flashed a toothy smile that made Eliott want to embarrass himself even more just to see it again. </p><p>Lucas then proceeded to ask Sofiane if he needed any help cleaning the mess, and when Sofiane said he had it handled, Lucas took it upon himself to sit down on the floor, taking Sofiane\u2019s spot. </p><p>After a while, the shorter of the two spoke up. \u201cI haven\u2019t introduced myself yet. I\u2019m Lucas. Lucas Lallemant.\u201d He held out his hand, gesturing for Eliott to take it and shake it. </p><p>\u201cUm. Eliott. Demaury. Eliott Demaury. That\u2019s me.\u201d He let out a nervous chuckle and latched onto Lucas\u2019 hand like a leech. He then began to shake it a bit too vigorously and continued that action for about fifteen seconds. </p><p>\u201cAs much as I like a firm, solid handshake, I think you\u2019re overdoing it a bit, dude.\u201d Lucas laughed. Sofiane joined in on the laughter as well, watching their interaction from where he was, cleaning up the floor.</p><p>Eliott ducked his head down. \u201cSorry about that. You probably think that I\u2019m weird now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve probably freaked you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you haven\u2019t. Sure, you\u2019re a little weird, but I find it quite cute.\u201d Lucas gave him a small grin.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Eliott couldn\u2019t believe his ears.</p><p>\u201cReally. And besides, aren\u2019t we all a little weird anyways? I know that I am.\u201d His face faltered for a second, before regaining his grin. \u201cAnd plus, do you think I\u2019d be willing to share this with just anyone?\u201d Lucas pulls out a joint and lighter from his bag. </p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d He lit it up, took a drag, and held it out for Eliott. \u201cHere. Take a drag.\u201d</p><p>He took the joint from Lucas and followed his orders. </p><p>\u2022~\u2022~\u2022</p><p>They sat in silence for a while, just passing the joint back and forth. It was far from awkward and Eliott couldn\u2019t have been happier. He was smiling, feeling the haze affect the weed gave him. </p><p>Sofiane was long gone by now, saying he had to go meet up with Imane. </p><p>He sneaked a peak at Lucas, who had his head leaned back, against the wall. His eyes were closed and he looked relaxed. He looked like he finally got a break. While observing him, Eliott saw how apparent his dark circles were. How hadn\u2019t he seen them before?</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by a loud ringtone. Lucas snapped his eyes open, grabbed his phone, and looked panicked when he answered. </p><p>\u201cHello? Why haven\u2019t you answered me? I\u2019ve been trying to get a hold of you for days. You can\u2019t just go rogue like that, okay?\u201d His mood quickly changed to angry. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to ask how you are, I don\u2019t fucking care! I\u2019m about to be late this month and you haven\u2019t-\u201d He looked panicked again. \u201cHello?\u201d He puts his phone up. \u201cGod fucking dammit.\u201d He mutters. He runs a hand through his hair and takes a sharp breath. </p><p>\u201cYou okay over there?\u201d Eliott asks. </p><p>\u201cUh, yes. Fine. Listen, sorry to leave you like this, but I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Eliott tried to hide the fact that he was a bit disappointed. It didn\u2019t really work. </p><p>Lucas\u2019 face softened and he looked him in the eyes. \u201cI usually come here everyday and stay in the studio room to dance. Stop by to say hi when you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>Eliott smiled. \u201cOkay, will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He paused. \u201cBye, Eliott.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Lucas was gone. Eliott knew there was something going on, but didn\u2019t want to push Lucas into telling him. It didn\u2019t change the fact that he was still worried though. </p><p>\u2022~\u2022~\u2022</p><p>That night, Eliott dreamt of a certain blue eyed boy with crazy hair. A boy he didn\u2019t know was dreaming about him too. </p><p>***</p><p>Author\u2019s note: this is my first series work and I\u2019m writing along as I go.

I&rsquo;ll take that as a compliment, I guess.&rdquo; Lucas smirked and Eliott&rsquo;s face was suddenly as red as a tomato and hot all over. </p><p>&ldquo;Um I didn&rsquo;t mean-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No take backs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Eliott was lost. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take back what you said. And besides, your face isn&rsquo;t that bad either. It&rsquo;s quite nice if you ask me.&rdquo; Lucas winked, and flashed a toothy smile that made Eliott want to embarrass himself even more just to see it again. </p><p>Lucas then proceeded to ask Sofiane if he needed any help cleaning the mess, and when Sofiane said he had it handled, Lucas took it upon himself to sit down on the floor, taking Sofiane&rsquo;s spot. </p><p>After a while, the shorter of the two spoke up. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t introduced myself yet. I&rsquo;m Lucas. Lucas Lallemant.&rdquo; He held out his hand, gesturing for Eliott to take it and shake it. </p><p>&ldquo;Um. Eliott. Demaury. Eliott Demaury. That&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; He let out a nervous chuckle and latched onto Lucas&rsquo; hand like a leech. He then began to shake it a bit too vigorously and continued that action for about fifteen seconds. </p><p>&ldquo;As much as I like a firm, solid handshake, I think you&rsquo;re overdoing it a bit, dude.&rdquo; Lucas laughed. Sofiane joined in on the laughter as well, watching their interaction from where he was, cleaning up the floor.</p><p>Eliott ducked his head down. &ldquo;Sorry about that. You probably think that I&rsquo;m weird now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve probably freaked you out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No you haven&rsquo;t. Sure, you&rsquo;re a little weird, but I find it quite cute.&rdquo; Lucas gave him a small grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Eliott couldn&rsquo;t believe his ears.</p><p>&ldquo;Really. And besides, aren&rsquo;t we all a little weird anyways? I know that I am.&rdquo; His face faltered for a second, before regaining his grin. &ldquo;And plus, do you think I&rsquo;d be willing to share this with just anyone?&rdquo; Lucas pulls out a joint and lighter from his bag. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; He lit it up, took a drag, and held it out for Eliott. &ldquo;Here. Take a drag.&rdquo;</p><p>He took the joint from Lucas and followed his orders. </p><p>&bull;~&bull;~&bull;</p><p>They sat in silence for a while, just passing the joint back and forth. It was far from awkward and Eliott couldn&rsquo;t have been happier. He was smiling, feeling the haze affect the weed gave him. </p><p>Sofiane was long gone by now, saying he had to go meet up with Imane. </p><p>He sneaked a peak at Lucas, who had his head leaned back, against the wall. His eyes were closed and he looked relaxed. He looked like he finally got a break. While observing him, Eliott saw how apparent his dark circles were. How hadn&rsquo;t he seen them before?</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by a loud ringtone. Lucas snapped his eyes open, grabbed his phone, and looked panicked when he answered. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello? Why haven&rsquo;t you answered me? I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a hold of you for days. You can&rsquo;t just go rogue like that, okay?&rdquo; His mood quickly changed to angry. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to ask how you are, I don&rsquo;t fucking care! I&rsquo;m about to be late this month and you haven&rsquo;t-&rdquo; He looked panicked again. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; He puts his phone up. &ldquo;God fucking dammit.&rdquo; He mutters. He runs a hand through his hair and takes a sharp breath. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay over there?&rdquo; Eliott asks. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yes. Fine. Listen, sorry to leave you like this, but I have to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo; Eliott tried to hide the fact that he was a bit disappointed. It didn&rsquo;t really work. </p><p>Lucas&rsquo; face softened and he looked him in the eyes. &ldquo;I usually come here everyday and stay in the studio room to dance. Stop by to say hi when you feel like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott smiled. &ldquo;Okay, will do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Bye, Eliott.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that, Lucas was gone. Eliott knew there was something going on, but didn&rsquo;t want to push Lucas into telling him. It didn&rsquo;t change the fact that he was still worried though. </p><p>&bull;~&bull;~&bull;</p><p>That night, Eliott dreamt of a certain blue eyed boy with crazy hair. A boy he didn&rsquo;t know was dreaming about him too. </p><p>***</p><p>Author&rsquo;s note: this is my first series work and I&rsquo;m writing along as I go.

It would probably the biggest understatement of the century. He finally got a job at the rec center, thanks to his best friend, Sofiane, and can make some good money.
