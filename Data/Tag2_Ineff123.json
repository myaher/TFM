There was no way Crowley would ruin his snakeskin boots for pages of which he knew the contents were unsalvageable. But Ezra insisted they not pollute the park more than it already was. He had a point, but that did nothing to brighten Crowley\u2019s mood.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019ss the lasssst one,\u201d he mumbled. His tongue was thick and uncomfortable in his mouth after he nearly bit off the tip, courtesy of a well-placed football to the cranium that put him back to square one with his speech impediment. \u201cCan we pleasse go back to Adam now, before something happensss we both regret?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYes,\u201d Ezra said as he plucked the final page from the stick in Crowley\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019ll put these in the recycling.\u201d He gave the grocery bag they had collected the pages in a good pat. \u201cBy the way, how\u2019s your head?\u201d He asked as they walked the short distance back to the shop.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI haven\u2019t had any complaintss.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean it, dear,\u201d the shorter man said, less than amused.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley shook his head. \u2018Dear\u2019? Did Ezra just call him \u2018dear\u2019?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI\u2019m ssure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he mumbled as he glanced through the window of the bookshop. Adam, who was still strapped into his stroller, had decided this would have been a good moment to take a quick nap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra peered through now opened front door of the shop. \u201cOh, would you look at that. Isn\u2019t he precious?\u201d he said as he held the door open for Crowley.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">He really is, the man thought, but Ezra didn\u2019t allow him the opportunity to actually voice his reply.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cLet\u2019s see if I have any books to replace those instructions of yours,\u201d he said as he ran off into the shop, to the self-help and parenting section.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">The bookshop was old. All creaky hardwood floorboards and sturdy oak bookshelves, contrasting creamy white walls that were lined with antique, dusty light fixtures. There were at least five flights of stairs behind the till that each led to a different section of books, as well as a modest apartment. Crowley knew self-help and parenting was on the second floor, so he unclasped the sleeping Adam from his seat, carefully cradled the boy against his chest, and went up the stairs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cFind anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra turned around, holding a stack of books. Crowley stopped counting at five, but there were at least thrice as many of varying page counts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, yes. Each of these books has some truths and genuinely good advice in it, but there\u2019s no way one person can read all of this for two weeks of babysitting. Even marking the right pages with memos would take me days.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cMaybe it\u2019ss time for the great \u2018Aziraphale\u2019 to write a book on child care then, isn\u2019t it? Compiling the good bits?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra pouted. \u201cYou know historical novels are more of my thing, Crowley. Besides, if I used that pen name, no one would take the book seriously.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI was kidding,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cBut you do have experience with this kind of stuff, which is why I meant to call you in the first place. I was hoping you could jusst\u2026 help me out. You know?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cHelp you out?\u201d Ezra repeated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind seeing a lot more of me these next two weeks, I don\u2019t mind helping you out. But I really can\u2019t leave the shop alone for that long.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure Adam would love being here,\u201d Crowley said as he carefully ran his fingers through the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra smiled at him. There was something about it that was unlike any other time Ezra had smiled at him before. There was a fondness in his smile. Crowley was in no way equipped to deal with this.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d see you doting on another human being like that,\u201d Ezra said, his soft gaze now cast at Adam, who made a face in his sleep.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou should have seen me with my niece. Anathema was at least as cute as Adam when she was that age, and twice as demanding.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra frowned, deep in thought.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cNow that you mention it, I do remember you coming in with a little girl every once in a while. I figured out she must have been a niece later. I could have sworn she was your daughter at first.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEz, I\u2019m thirty-two. Isn\u2019t that a little young to have a seventeen year old daughter?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra raised his hands in self-defense. \u201cNot judging.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOkay, enough about how good I would look as a dad. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re willing to\u2026\u201d Crowley sniffed at the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d he asked only just before Adam woke and started wailing in his ear. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he shrieked as he barely managed not to drop the boy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOh, come here. He just needs a clean diaper,\u201d Ezra said as he took the crying baby from the man\u2019s arms and rocked the boy gently as he took him into the apartment.</p><p>Crowley, on the other hand, ran down to the diaper bag downstairs and carried the whole thing up. He was in no way equipped to deal with <i>that</i>, either.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">*</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">It was around four in the afternoon by the time Ezra was feeding Adam.

There was no way Crowley would ruin his snakeskin boots for pages of which he knew the contents were unsalvageable. But Ezra insisted they not pollute the park more than it already was. He had a point, but that did nothing to brighten Crowley\u2019s mood.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019ss the lasssst one,\u201d he mumbled. His tongue was thick and uncomfortable in his mouth after he nearly bit off the tip, courtesy of a well-placed football to the cranium that put him back to square one with his speech impediment. \u201cCan we pleasse go back to Adam now, before something happensss we both regret?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYes,\u201d Ezra said as he plucked the final page from the stick in Crowley\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019ll put these in the recycling.\u201d He gave the grocery bag they had collected the pages in a good pat. \u201cBy the way, how\u2019s your head?\u201d He asked as they walked the short distance back to the shop.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI haven\u2019t had any complaintss.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean it, dear,\u201d the shorter man said, less than amused.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley shook his head. \u2018Dear\u2019? Did Ezra just call him \u2018dear\u2019?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI\u2019m ssure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he mumbled as he glanced through the window of the bookshop. Adam, who was still strapped into his stroller, had decided this would have been a good moment to take a quick nap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra peered through now opened front door of the shop. \u201cOh, would you look at that. Isn\u2019t he precious?\u201d he said as he held the door open for Crowley.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">He really is, the man thought, but Ezra didn\u2019t allow him the opportunity to actually voice his reply.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cLet\u2019s see if I have any books to replace those instructions of yours,\u201d he said as he ran off into the shop, to the self-help and parenting section.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">The bookshop was old. All creaky hardwood floorboards and sturdy oak bookshelves, contrasting creamy white walls that were lined with antique, dusty light fixtures. There were at least five flights of stairs behind the till that each led to a different section of books, as well as a modest apartment. Crowley knew self-help and parenting was on the second floor, so he unclasped the sleeping Adam from his seat, carefully cradled the boy against his chest, and went up the stairs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cFind anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra turned around, holding a stack of books. Crowley stopped counting at five, but there were at least thrice as many of varying page counts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, yes. Each of these books has some truths and genuinely good advice in it, but there\u2019s no way one person can read all of this for two weeks of babysitting. Even marking the right pages with memos would take me days.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cMaybe it\u2019ss time for the great \u2018Aziraphale\u2019 to write a book on child care then, isn\u2019t it? Compiling the good bits?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra pouted. \u201cYou know historical novels are more of my thing, Crowley. Besides, if I used that pen name, no one would take the book seriously.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI was kidding,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cBut you do have experience with this kind of stuff, which is why I meant to call you in the first place. I was hoping you could jusst\u2026 help me out. You know?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cHelp you out?\u201d Ezra repeated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind seeing a lot more of me these next two weeks, I don\u2019t mind helping you out. But I really can\u2019t leave the shop alone for that long.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure Adam would love being here,\u201d Crowley said as he carefully ran his fingers through the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra smiled at him. There was something about it that was unlike any other time Ezra had smiled at him before. There was a fondness in his smile. Crowley was in no way equipped to deal with this.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d see you doting on another human being like that,\u201d Ezra said, his soft gaze now cast at Adam, who made a face in his sleep.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou should have seen me with my niece. Anathema was at least as cute as Adam when she was that age, and twice as demanding.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra frowned, deep in thought.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cNow that you mention it, I do remember you coming in with a little girl every once in a while. I figured out she must have been a niece later. I could have sworn she was your daughter at first.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEz, I\u2019m thirty-two. Isn\u2019t that a little young to have a seventeen year old daughter?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra raised his hands in self-defense. \u201cNot judging.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOkay, enough about how good I would look as a dad. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re willing to\u2026\u201d Crowley sniffed at the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d he asked only just before Adam woke and started wailing in his ear. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he shrieked as he barely managed not to drop the boy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOh, come here. He just needs a clean diaper,\u201d Ezra said as he took the crying baby from the man\u2019s arms and rocked the boy gently as he took him into the apartment.</p><p>Crowley, on the other hand, ran down to the diaper bag downstairs and carried the whole thing up. He was in no way equipped to deal with <i>that</i>, either.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">*</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">It was around four in the afternoon by the time Ezra was feeding Adam. The boy was happily sat in Crowley\u2019s lap, who held an arm around him while he read through the manuscript of Aziraphale\u2019s next novel in his other hand as Ezra fed the child.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u2018The Nice And Accurate Vengeance Of Agnes Nutter, Witch\u2019.

Did Ezra just call him \u2018dear\u2019?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI\u2019m ssure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he mumbled as he glanced through the window of the bookshop. Adam, who was still strapped into his stroller, had decided this would have been a good moment to take a quick nap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra peered through now opened front door of the shop. \u201cOh, would you look at that.

All creaky hardwood floorboards and sturdy oak bookshelves, contrasting creamy white walls that were lined with antique, dusty light fixtures. There were at least five flights of stairs behind the till that each led to a different section of books, as well as a modest apartment. Crowley knew self-help and parenting was on the second floor, so he unclasped the sleeping Adam from his seat, carefully cradled the boy against his chest, and went up the stairs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cFind anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra turned around, holding a stack of books. Crowley stopped counting at five, but there were at least thrice as many of varying page counts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, yes. Each of these books has some truths and genuinely good advice in it, but there\u2019s no way one person can read all of this for two weeks of babysitting. Even marking the right pages with memos would take me days.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cMaybe it\u2019ss time for the great \u2018Aziraphale\u2019 to write a book on child care then, isn\u2019t it? Compiling the good bits?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra pouted. \u201cYou know historical novels are more of my thing, Crowley. Besides, if I used that pen name, no one would take the book seriously.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI was kidding,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cBut you do have experience with this kind of stuff, which is why I meant to call you in the first place. I was hoping you could jusst\u2026 help me out. You know?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cHelp you out?\u201d Ezra repeated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind seeing a lot more of me these next two weeks, I don\u2019t mind helping you out. But I really can\u2019t leave the shop alone for that long.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure Adam would love being here,\u201d Crowley said as he carefully ran his fingers through the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra smiled at him. There was something about it that was unlike any other time Ezra had smiled at him before. There was a fondness in his smile. Crowley was in no way equipped to deal with this.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d see you doting on another human being like that,\u201d Ezra said, his soft gaze now cast at Adam, who made a face in his sleep.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou should have seen me with my niece. Anathema was at least as cute as Adam when she was that age, and twice as demanding.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra frowned, deep in thought.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cNow that you mention it, I do remember you coming in with a little girl every once in a while. I figured out she must have been a niece later. I could have sworn she was your daughter at first.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEz, I\u2019m thirty-two. Isn\u2019t that a little young to have a seventeen year old daughter?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra raised his hands in self-defense. \u201cNot judging.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOkay, enough about how good I would look as a dad. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re willing to\u2026\u201d Crowley sniffed at the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d he asked only just before Adam woke and started wailing in his ear. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he shrieked as he barely managed not to drop the boy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cOh, come here. He just needs a clean diaper,\u201d Ezra said as he took the crying baby from the man\u2019s arms and rocked the boy gently as he took him into the apartment.</p><p>Crowley, on the other hand, ran down to the diaper bag downstairs and carried the whole thing up. He was in no way equipped to deal with <i>that</i>, either.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">*</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">It was around four in the afternoon by the time Ezra was feeding Adam. The boy was happily sat in Crowley\u2019s lap, who held an arm around him while he read through the manuscript of Aziraphale\u2019s next novel in his other hand as Ezra fed the child.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u2018The Nice And Accurate Vengeance Of Agnes Nutter, Witch\u2019. Agnes Nutter. The name rung a vague bell with Crowley, but for the life of him, he couldn\u2019t put his finger on why.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ezra cooed as he wiped some mashed vegetable from Adam\u2019s cheek.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEz, I know you know you\u2019re a good writer, but would you not patronize me like that?\u201d Crowley mumbled without looking up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you, dear. I was talking to Adam,\u201d he said as he offered Adam another spoonful. \u201cBut thank you. It\u2019s only the first draft though. It\u2019s nowhere near the quality it needs to be.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou always were the better storyteller between us. I mean, I don\u2019t know how you do it. The dialogue, the visual descriptions\u2026 I can see it all in front of me. I can\u2019t believe people kept records of all this. Was there really a witch that wiped a complete village off the map?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra chuckled, he seemed amused by Crowley\u2019s curiosity. \u201cWell, yes and no. Records of the Witchfinder Army showed that a woman accused of witchcraft was to be burned at the stake at 2 PM that day in 1655, while other records showed there was an explosion around that time in approximately that area that was heard as far away as Halifax. The following day, the WA goes back to the village to investigate only to find that rubble was all that remained, which was also recorded. The rest is more of an\u2026 \u2018educated guess\u2019,\u201d he air quoted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley mocked a gasp. \u201cAziraphale? Using educated guesses to write his absolutely not fictional novel rather than researching even more dusty old records? Are you hearing this scandalous scoop, Mr. Adam?\u201d He leaned down to look the boy in the eye. Adam giggled. When he looked back up at Ezra, the man didn\u2019t seem as amused.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYou know I\u2019m not comfortable calling my books non-fiction. Also, might I remind you that all eyewitnesses to this event have been blown to smithereens?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was just kidding,\u201d Crowley said. This time, he really was. Sorry, at least. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise,\u201d he thought for a minute before speaking up. \u201cAnything you want done, I\u2019ll do for you,\u201d he spoke confidently. Oh no. Should have thought a little longer on that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra seemed to put a lot of thought into his answer; his brows knitted together tightly, a pout pulled at the man\u2019s features as he bit on his lip, but eventually the other man spoke up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cWell, if you can really envision the story like that, it would only be a small effort to make a mock up for the cover, right? You always were the better artist between us, and I\u2019m sure I can get my agent to get my publisher to pay you for your time.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Crowley was quiet for a second.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d He asked eventually. The greatest extent of art nowadays were quick sketches and storyboards to communicate Lucy\u2019s ideas for the shareholders and the marketing teams. To make the cover of a book was a whole other ballpark. Besides, he was offering a <i>favour</i>, and now Ezra was offering to get him paid in return? What even was this conversation at this point?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">On the other hand, now that he was out of the office for two weeks to look after Adam, he had the time to figure it out. \u201cAre you sure? I mean, where did you even get the idea?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Ezra shrugged. \u201cI found a picture of us at your graduation expo while I was doing my spring cleaning. You were good. Are good, I\u2019m sure. Why you ever chose to become an assistant in a marketing department is beyond me.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cCold, hard cash, Ez. A man\u2019s gotta live,\u201d Crowley stated simply. \u201cBesides, I like working with Lucy,\u201d he said as he carded another hand through Adam\u2019s soft hair.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cYes, but do you actually like your work?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cEzra, this isn\u2019t the time for me to start questioning my life choices. It isn\u2019t even five in the afternoon and I\u2019m dead sober,\u201d he snapped, and frowned at the realization of what he\u2019d just said. \u201cBut I\u2019d love to make you a sketch or two for your book,\u201d Crowley said in an attempt to make it up to his friend.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">\u201cI\u2019m glad you do,\u201d Ezra smiled. \u201cWould you like to stay for dinner? I was planning on getting takeout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Absolutely.\u201d</p>",

Was there really a witch that wiped a complete village off the map?&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra chuckled, he seemed amused by Crowley&rsquo;s curiosity. &ldquo;Well, yes and no. Records of the Witchfinder Army showed that a woman accused of witchcraft was to be burned at the stake at 2 PM that day in 1655, while other records showed there was an explosion around that time in approximately that area that was heard as far away as Halifax. The following day, the WA goes back to the village to investigate only to find that rubble was all that remained, which was also recorded. The rest is more of an&hellip; &lsquo;educated guess&rsquo;,&rdquo; he air quoted.</p><p>Crowley mocked a gasp. &ldquo;Aziraphale? Using educated guesses to write his absolutely not fictional novel rather than researching even more dusty old records? Are you hearing this scandalous scoop, Mr. Adam?&rdquo; He leaned down to look the boy in the eye. Adam giggled. When he looked back up at Ezra, the man didn&rsquo;t seem as amused.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not comfortable calling my books non-fiction. Also, might I remind you that all eyewitnesses to this event have been blown to smithereens?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I was just kidding,&rdquo; Crowley said. This time, he really was. Sorry, at least. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it up to you, I promise,&rdquo; he thought for a minute before speaking up. &ldquo;Anything you want done, I&rsquo;ll do for you,&rdquo; he spoke confidently. Oh no. Should have thought a little longer on that.</p><p>Ezra seemed to put a lot of thought into his answer; his brows knitted together tightly, a pout pulled at the man&rsquo;s features as he bit on his lip, but eventually the other man spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you can really envision the story like that, it would only be a small effort to make a mock up for the cover, right? You always were the better artist between us, and I&rsquo;m sure I can get my agent to get my publisher to pay you for your time.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley was quiet for a second.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; He asked eventually. The greatest extent of art nowadays were quick sketches and storyboards to communicate Lucy&rsquo;s ideas for the shareholders and the marketing teams. To make the cover of a book was a whole other ballpark. Besides, he was offering a <i>favour</i>, and now Ezra was offering to get him paid in return? What even was this conversation at this point?</p><p>On the other hand, now that he was out of the office for two weeks to look after Adam, he had the time to figure it out. &ldquo;Are you sure? I mean, where did you even get the idea?&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra shrugged. &ldquo;I found a picture of us at your graduation expo while I was doing my spring cleaning. You were good. Are good, I&rsquo;m sure. Why you ever chose to become an assistant in a marketing department is beyond me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cold, hard cash, Ez. A man&rsquo;s gotta live,&rdquo; Crowley stated simply. &ldquo;Besides, I like working with Lucy,&rdquo; he said as he carded another hand through Adam&rsquo;s soft hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but do you actually like your work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ezra, this isn&rsquo;t the time for me to start questioning my life choices. It isn&rsquo;t even five in the afternoon and I&rsquo;m dead sober,&rdquo; he snapped, and frowned at the realization of what he&rsquo;d just said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d love to make you a sketch or two for your book,&rdquo; Crowley said in an attempt to make it up to his friend.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you do,&rdquo; Ezra smiled. &ldquo;Would you like to stay for dinner? I was planning on getting takeout.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>",

Winter had come to an end, and spring was finally starting to set in. Young leaves and blooms were starting to grow in the trees and shrubs in the park across from Crowley\u2019s Mayfair apartment. It was so warm, in fact, that Anthony J &ldquo;usually-so-cold-he-should-probably-get-himself-checked-out&rdquo; Crowley ventured to work without his coat and with a pair of sunglasses perched on his nose, ever the optimist.<br/></p><p>On his way to work, the marketing department at the global headquarters of a European multinational, he stopped by a coffee shop, greeted the barista, and ordered a latte for himself and for his boss before continuing on his way. </p><p>His boss, Lucy, had been a classmate of his in primary school. He had some fond memories of her. But after primary school, their friendship faded. Where Crowley failed classes left and right and was set back several years, Lucy flourished in school and exceeded every expectation. Where Crowley decided to go into the arts, Lucy studied marketing and management. And where Crowley lived alone with barely a social life to speak of, Lucy had a fianc\u00e9, a son and a seemingly endless stream of friends on top of her job. </p><p>How she did it, he had no idea. But he somehow ended up being her assistant.</p><p>\u201cMr. Crowley, so glad you decided to join us.\u201d Lucy flashed a devilish smile as she snatched one of the paper cups out of the carton the very second he came out of the elevator. Her caramel brown hair was done up in a neat bun, as per usual, and her black pantsuit looked stunning on her, as always.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferguson,\u201d Lucy corrected. \u201cI know you mean well, but someone\u2019s gotta show these sharks who\u2019s boss. Besides, I don\u2019t go around calling you Anton, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Crowley said. He mocked a salute as he followed her into her office. </p><p>&lsquo;Anton&rsquo; was what Lucy had called him upon their first meeting one fateful day in the schoolyard, and it stuck to him ever since. He couldn\u2019t blame another six year old for refusing to even try and pronounce \u2018Anthony\u2019. Especially when the man himself spoke with a lisp back then. </p><p>\u201cAnything I can do for you?\u201d He asked before finally taking a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWell, there is one thing\u2026\u201d Lucy\u2014 ms. Ferguson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly work-related, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anyone else in the world I would trust with the task.\u201d</p><p>This piqued Crowley\u2019s attention. A single brow raised over the rims of the sunglasses he had \u2018forgotten\u2019 to take off.</p><p>\u201cYou know how\u2026 particular I can be with Adam\u2019s care, right?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Crowley knew. The last year and nine months had been an Experience, so to speak. Every day, Lucy had regaled to Crowley the many things she read in books and on websites about parenting. Once the boy was finally there, she had laid down the law for everyone. Fianc\u00e9s, grandparents, friends and babysitters alike. She was strict about it, but Adam seemed to be happy and healthy. But that was Lucy: strict, diligent, and always yielding the best results.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley tried simply, motioning for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to offer you two weeks out of the office. All expenses covered. On the condition that you look after Adam while Belle and I are on our vacation.\u201d</p><p>As if they had become sentient with a sense for comedic timing, Crowley\u2019s sunglasses slid down his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had a babysitter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too! But now she\u2019s off to Cambodia for half a year to rediscover herself after a particularly bad break up\u2026\u201d Lucy let herself fall into her office chair with an exasperated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re really my only hope. Belle is so looking forward to this trip to Croatia, I don\u2019t want to have to tell her that we have to cancel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley thought it over for a second. Deep down, he knew he had already decided, but caring for his obscene amount of houseplants proved to be a challenge on its own. Was taking care of a human baby really a good idea?</p><p>Then again, this was Lucy. Surely she would provide clearer instructions to take care of Adam than the regular garden center would provide for a ficus. He pouted and bit the inside of his cheeks some more before finally speaking up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d Lucy said as she clasped her hands together. \u201cI\u2019ll pack a bag with everything he needs and print you some instructions. Our plane leaves at three, so if you could come pick up Adam at my place at around nine in the morning, that would be ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, sure. I can do that,\u201d Crowley said as he tried not to imagine an instruction book the size of a George R. R. Martin novel, peppered with fine print, brightly coloured post-its and a footnote here and there. \u201cTomorrow at nine. Absolutely.\u201d He whipped out his phone to set his alarms accordingly with a quick note to \u2018PICK UP LUCY\u2019S BABY\u2019. Crowley was not used to having to be places at nine on a Saturday, but he liked to think he could do it with the right precautions.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I can\u2019t thank you enough for this.</p><p>\u201cHey, no, really, it\u2019s fine. You work really hard. You deserve a nice vacation.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s really sweet of you. So, the deeds of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, deeds. There\u2019s some calls that came in after you left yesterday, I put a list of those on your desk and\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It was Saturday, ten in the morning, and Crowley was sitting on a bench in the park across the street from his apartment. The sound of the children playing football behind him, using water bottles as improvised goalposts filled his ears. The pram containing Adam, who was covered in a reasonable amount of sunblock for the time of year, was parked securely next to him. He tried to relax and soak up some much needed sunshine, but instead he ground his teeth as he pondered for a while whether or not to also put his sunglasses on the toddler to shield his eyes. </p><p>Crowley noticed Lucy had packed the kid red and white striped pyjamas. He had briefly toyed with the idea of asking her whether or not he looked like the Goblin King to her, but quickly decided against it. He knew what Lucy was like when she was stressed, and joking about 80s movies in that situation would not have been the best idea.</p><p>He fidgeted with his fingers and ground his teeth some more. He didn&rsquo;t know the first thing about caring for a baby. He didn&rsquo;t know what the right temperature for a jar of mashed vegetables felt like. He didn&rsquo;t know how fast his patience might run out without a smoke every once in a while. He leaned his head backwards and let out an exasperated groan. Two weeks of not smoking. How had he ever agreed to this?</p><p>He gave Adam a quick glance to make sure he was entertained with his rattling teddy bear before getting out his phone, scroll through the letter A in his contacts and dial the expert.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Anathema, how are you doing?&rdquo; Crowley asked, putting on his best customer service voice. He practically heard the teen&rsquo;s mood drop.</p><p>&ldquo;Need me to help you hide another body, uncle Tony?&rdquo; Anathema asked, all business. &ldquo;Proverbially, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite&hellip;&rdquo; He said, slowly phasing the artificial sweetener out of his tone. Anathema had the best bullshit radar in the family and it must have been blaring at full power. &ldquo;You still babysit, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you need a babysitter for?&rdquo; Anathema pushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yesterday I promised my boss I would watch her baby while she&rsquo;s away for two weeks. And today I&rsquo;m realizing I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And now you want me to look after your boss&rsquo; baby so you can take all the credit when she comes home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s within the realm of possibility, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle Tony, I have classes to go to and finals to study for. Why don&rsquo;t you ask that friend of yours you had a crush on? The one with the bookshop. Whatshisface. It&rsquo;s on the tip of my tongue.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley winced when he came to the conclusion, &ldquo;Ezra? I haven&rsquo;t talked to him in months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you best start talking to him again. He said that before he had his bookshop, he had a job at a daycare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When did he tell you that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I was seven and you took me to the park by his shop every weekend so you could admire him from afar. This one time you finally built up the courage to take me into his shop with the promise of a new book, which you never got me by the way, you two got talking and he just casually dropped it into the conversation. But then again, you might have been so nervous it went right over your head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that might have been it,&rdquo; Crowley admitted more to himself than to his niece. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him a call. You&rsquo;re my hero, Anathema.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the girl said. Crowley could hear the smug smirk on her face on the other end of the line. &ldquo;You can call me for some quick advice, but please know that I&rsquo;m going to be busy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gotcha. I&rsquo;ll talk to you later then. Tell your mum I said hi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will do. See ya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right. See ya,&rdquo; and he ended the call. He went back into his contacts and scrolled down to the letter E. However, he was so preoccupied with his phone that he didn\u2019t notice something, or rather someone, leaning over the backrest of the bench.</p><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d Ezra Fell, local bookshop keeper and historical non-fiction* author \u2018Aziraphale\u2019, asked with a satisfied smirk on his face.</p><p>(*This was a point of contention between Ezra and his literary agent. Where Ezra didn\u2019t feel comfortable calling his books historical \u201cnon-fiction\u201d. His novels were, after all, primarily based on vague records and nearly non-existent witness accounts. However, his agent insisted on the label, since, according to them, the very label itself would sell more copies.)</p><p>Crowley flinched, but didn\u2019t shriek. Not even a little bit. Not if you asked him, at least. \u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust feeding the ducks some old oats when I heard a familiar voice say my name, so I decided to investigate,\u201d the man said as he walked around the bench to sit down next to Crowley. \u201cDid you know bread is actually really bad for ducks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley said simply, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about the baby? Did I miss something big?\u201d Ezra asked as he tossed some oats to the ground. Ducks came rushing from the pond and Adam giggled at the sight of the waddling birds. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;d assume you&rsquo;d let me know if you had a baby, somehow.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cMy boss took her fianc\u00e9 on a vacation to Croatia, she\u2019s probably going to propose, so I\u2019m looking after their son until they come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you know anything about taking care of a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m just generally very good at following her very particular instructions,\u201d Crowley said as he produced a stack of instructions from a bright blue diaper bag, roughly the size of The Fellowship Of The Ring. \u201cThat and she trusts me, I guess. I was actually hoping you could help me with these.\u201d</p><p>A small \u2018my goodness\u2019 escaped Ezra as he eyed the stack of loose pages. \u201cThat\u2019s all for him?\u201d He asked, pointing at Adam.</p><p>\u201cLook out, mister!\u201d A young voice called from behind them, but Crowley paid it no mind.</p><p>\u201cIt is, trust me. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d Crowley bit his tongue as a football hit him in the back of the head, knocking his shades off his face and the pages out of his hand. As luck would have it, a breeze picked up, carrying the pages away from them and into the duck pond.</p><p>Adam giggled and clapped his tiny hands.</p><p>\u201cOh dear\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me\u2026\u201d</p><hr>",

Winter had come to an end, and spring was finally starting to set in. Young leaves and blooms were starting to grow in the trees and shrubs in the park across from Crowley\u2019s Mayfair apartment. It was so warm, in fact, that Anthony J \u201cusually-so-cold-he-should-probably-get-himself-checked-out\u201d Crowley ventured to work without his coat and with a pair of sunglasses perched on his nose, ever the optimist.<br></p><p>On his way to work, the marketing department at the global headquarters of a European multinational, he stopped by a coffee shop, greeted the barista, and ordered a latte for himself and for his boss before continuing on his way. </p><p>His boss, Lucy, had been a classmate of his in primary school. He had some fond memories of her. But after primary school, their friendship faded. Where Crowley failed classes left and right and was set back several years, Lucy flourished in school and exceeded every expectation. Where Crowley decided to go into the arts, Lucy studied marketing and management. And where Crowley lived alone with barely a social life to speak of, Lucy had a fianc\u00e9, a son and a seemingly endless stream of friends on top of her job. </p><p>How she did it, he had no idea. But he somehow ended up being her assistant.</p><p>\u201cMr. Crowley, so glad you decided to join us.\u201d Lucy flashed a devilish smile as she snatched one of the paper cups out of the carton the very second he came out of the elevator. Her caramel brown hair was done up in a neat bun, as per usual, and her black pantsuit looked stunning on her, as always.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferguson,\u201d Lucy corrected. \u201cI know you mean well, but someone\u2019s gotta show these sharks who\u2019s boss. Besides, I don\u2019t go around calling you Anton, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Crowley said. He mocked a salute as he followed her into her office. </p><p>\u2018Anton\u2019 was what Lucy had called him upon their first meeting one fateful day in the schoolyard, and it stuck to him ever since. He couldn\u2019t blame another six year old for refusing to even try and pronounce \u2018Anthony\u2019. Especially when the man himself spoke with a lisp back then. </p><p>\u201cAnything I can do for you?\u201d He asked before finally taking a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWell, there is one thing\u2026\u201d Lucy\u2014 ms. Ferguson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly work-related, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anyone else in the world I would trust with the task.\u201d</p><p>This piqued Crowley\u2019s attention. A single brow raised over the rims of the sunglasses he had \u2018forgotten\u2019 to take off.</p><p>\u201cYou know how\u2026 particular I can be with Adam\u2019s care, right?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Crowley knew.

Winter had come to an end, and spring was finally starting to set in. Young leaves and blooms were starting to grow in the trees and shrubs in the park across from Crowley\u2019s Mayfair apartment. It was so warm, in fact, that Anthony J \u201cusually-so-cold-he-should-probably-get-himself-checked-out\u201d Crowley ventured to work without his coat and with a pair of sunglasses perched on his nose, ever the optimist.<br></p><p>On his way to work, the marketing department at the global headquarters of a European multinational, he stopped by a coffee shop, greeted the barista, and ordered a latte for himself and for his boss before continuing on his way. </p><p>His boss, Lucy, had been a classmate of his in primary school. He had some fond memories of her. But after primary school, their friendship faded. Where Crowley failed classes left and right and was set back several years, Lucy flourished in school and exceeded every expectation. Where Crowley decided to go into the arts, Lucy studied marketing and management. And where Crowley lived alone with barely a social life to speak of, Lucy had a fianc\u00e9, a son and a seemingly endless stream of friends on top of her job. </p><p>How she did it, he had no idea. But he somehow ended up being her assistant.</p><p>\u201cMr. Crowley, so glad you decided to join us.\u201d Lucy flashed a devilish smile as she snatched one of the paper cups out of the carton the very second he came out of the elevator. Her caramel brown hair was done up in a neat bun, as per usual, and her black pantsuit looked stunning on her, as always.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Ferguson,\u201d Lucy corrected. \u201cI know you mean well, but someone\u2019s gotta show these sharks who\u2019s boss. Besides, I don\u2019t go around calling you Anton, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Crowley said. He mocked a salute as he followed her into her office. </p><p>\u2018Anton\u2019 was what Lucy had called him upon their first meeting one fateful day in the schoolyard, and it stuck to him ever since. He couldn\u2019t blame another six year old for refusing to even try and pronounce \u2018Anthony\u2019. Especially when the man himself spoke with a lisp back then. </p><p>\u201cAnything I can do for you?\u201d He asked before finally taking a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWell, there is one thing\u2026\u201d Lucy\u2014 ms. Ferguson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly work-related, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anyone else in the world I would trust with the task.\u201d</p><p>This piqued Crowley\u2019s attention. A single brow raised over the rims of the sunglasses he had \u2018forgotten\u2019 to take off.</p><p>\u201cYou know how\u2026 particular I can be with Adam\u2019s care, right?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Crowley knew. The last year and nine months had been an Experience, so to speak. Every day, Lucy had regaled to Crowley the many things she read in books and on websites about parenting. Once the boy was finally there, she had laid down the law for everyone. Fianc\u00e9s, grandparents, friends and babysitters alike. She was strict about it, but Adam seemed to be happy and healthy. But that was Lucy: strict, diligent, and always yielding the best results.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley tried simply, motioning for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to offer you two weeks out of the office. All expenses covered. On the condition that you look after Adam while Belle and I are on our vacation.\u201d</p><p>As if they had become sentient with a sense for comedic timing, Crowley\u2019s sunglasses slid down his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had a babysitter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too! But now she\u2019s off to Cambodia for half a year to rediscover herself after a particularly bad break up\u2026\u201d Lucy let herself fall into her office chair with an exasperated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re really my only hope. Belle is so looking forward to this trip to Croatia, I don\u2019t want to have to tell her that we have to cancel.\u201d</p><p>Crowley thought it over for a second. Deep down, he knew he had already decided, but caring for his obscene amount of houseplants proved to be a challenge on its own. Was taking care of a human baby really a good idea?</p><p>Then again, this was Lucy. Surely she would provide clearer instructions to take care of Adam than the regular garden center would provide for a ficus. He pouted and bit the inside of his cheeks some more before finally speaking up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d Lucy said as she clasped her hands together. \u201cI\u2019ll pack a bag with everything he needs and print you some instructions. Our plane leaves at three, so if you could come pick up Adam at my place at around nine in the morning, that would be ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, sure. I can do that,\u201d Crowley said as he tried not to imagine an instruction book the size of a George R. R. Martin novel, peppered with fine print, brightly coloured post-its and a footnote here and there. \u201cTomorrow at nine. Absolutely.\u201d He whipped out his phone to set his alarms accordingly with a quick note to \u2018PICK UP LUCY\u2019S BABY\u2019. Crowley was not used to having to be places at nine on a Saturday, but he liked to think he could do it with the right precautions.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I can\u2019t thank you enough for this.</p><p>\u201cHey, no, really, it\u2019s fine. You work really hard. You deserve a nice vacation.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s really sweet of you. So, the deeds of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, deeds. There\u2019s some calls that came in after you left yesterday, I put a list of those on your desk and\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It was Saturday, ten in the morning, and Crowley was sitting on a bench in the park across the street from his apartment. The sound of the children playing football behind him, using water bottles as improvised goalposts filled his ears. The pram containing Adam, who was covered in a reasonable amount of sunblock for the time of year, was parked securely next to him. He tried to relax and soak up some much needed sunshine, but instead he ground his teeth as he pondered for a while whether or not to also put his sunglasses on the toddler to shield his eyes. </p><p>Crowley noticed Lucy had packed the kid red and white striped pyjamas. He had briefly toyed with the idea of asking her whether or not he looked like the Goblin King to her, but quickly decided against it. He knew what Lucy was like when she was stressed, and joking about 80s movies in that situation would not have been the best idea.</p><p>He fidgeted with his fingers and ground his teeth some more. He didn\u2019t know the first thing about caring for a baby. He didn\u2019t know what the right temperature for a jar of mashed vegetables felt like. He didn\u2019t know how fast his patience might run out without a smoke every once in a while. He leaned his head backwards and let out an exasperated groan. Two weeks of not smoking. How had he ever agreed to this?</p><p>He gave Adam a quick glance to make sure he was entertained with his rattling teddy bear before getting out his phone, scroll through the letter A in his contacts and dial the expert.</p><p>\u201cHey Anathema, how are you doing?\u201d Crowley asked, putting on his best customer service voice. He practically heard the teen\u2019s mood drop.</p><p>\u201cNeed me to help you hide another body, uncle Tony?\u201d Anathema asked, all business. \u201cProverbially, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite\u2026\u201d He said, slowly phasing the artificial sweetener out of his tone. Anathema had the best bullshit radar in the family and it must have been blaring at full power. \u201cYou still babysit, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need a babysitter for?\u201d Anathema pushed.</p><p>\u201cYesterday I promised my boss I would watch her baby while she\u2019s away for two weeks. And today I\u2019m realizing I haven\u2019t the slightest idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you want me to look after your boss\u2019 baby so you can take all the credit when she comes home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s within the realm of possibility, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Tony, I have classes to go to and finals to study for. Why don\u2019t you ask that friend of yours you had a crush on? The one with the bookshop. Whatshisface. It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue.\u201d</p><p>Crowley winced when he came to the conclusion, \u201cEzra? I haven\u2019t talked to him in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you best start talking to him again. He said that before he had his bookshop, he had a job at a daycare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was seven and you took me to the park by his shop every weekend so you could admire him from afar. This one time you finally built up the courage to take me into his shop with the promise of a new book, which you never got me by the way, you two got talking and he just casually dropped it into the conversation. But then again, you might have been so nervous it went right over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that might have been it,\u201d Crowley admitted more to himself than to his niece. \u201cI\u2019ll give him a call. You\u2019re my hero, Anathema.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d the girl said. Crowley could hear the smug smirk on her face on the other end of the line. \u201cYou can call me for some quick advice, but please know that I\u2019m going to be busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha. I\u2019ll talk to you later then. Tell your mum I said hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. See ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. See ya,\u201d and he ended the call. He went back into his contacts and scrolled down to the letter E. However, he was so preoccupied with his phone that he didn\u2019t notice something, or rather someone, leaning over the backrest of the bench.</p><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d Ezra Fell, local bookshop keeper and historical non-fiction* author \u2018Aziraphale\u2019, asked with a satisfied smirk on his face.</p><p>(*This was a point of contention between Ezra and his literary agent. Where Ezra didn\u2019t feel comfortable calling his books historical \u201cnon-fiction\u201d. His novels were, after all, primarily based on vague records and nearly non-existent witness accounts. However, his agent insisted on the label, since, according to them, the very label itself would sell more copies.)</p><p>Crowley flinched, but didn\u2019t shriek. Not even a little bit. Not if you asked him, at least. \u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust feeding the ducks some old oats when I heard a familiar voice say my name, so I decided to investigate,\u201d the man said as he walked around the bench to sit down next to Crowley. \u201cDid you know bread is actually really bad for ducks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley said simply, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about the baby? Did I miss something big?\u201d Ezra asked as he tossed some oats to the ground. Ducks came rushing from the pond and Adam giggled at the sight of the waddling birds. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d assume you\u2019d let me know if you had a baby, somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boss took her fianc\u00e9 on a vacation to Croatia, she\u2019s probably going to propose, so I\u2019m looking after their son until they come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you know anything about taking care of a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m just generally very good at following her very particular instructions,\u201d Crowley said as he produced a stack of instructions from a bright blue diaper bag, roughly the size of The Fellowship Of The Ring. \u201cThat and she trusts me, I guess. I was actually hoping you could help me with these.\u201d</p><p>A small \u2018my goodness\u2019 escaped Ezra as he eyed the stack of loose pages. \u201cThat\u2019s all for him?\u201d He asked, pointing at Adam.</p><p>\u201cLook out, mister!\u201d A young voice called from behind them, but Crowley paid it no mind.</p><p>\u201cIt is, trust me. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d Crowley bit his tongue as a football hit him in the back of the head, knocking his shades off his face and the pages out of his hand. As luck would have it, a breeze picked up, carrying the pages away from them and into the duck pond.</p><p>Adam giggled and clapped his tiny hands.</p><p>\u201cOh dear\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me\u2026\u201d</p><hr></p>",

Anathema had the best bullshit radar in the family and it must have been blaring at full power. &ldquo;You still babysit, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you need a babysitter for?&rdquo; Anathema pushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yesterday I promised my boss I would watch her baby while she&rsquo;s away for two weeks. And today I&rsquo;m realizing I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And now you want me to look after your boss&rsquo; baby so you can take all the credit when she comes home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s within the realm of possibility, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle Tony, I have classes to go to and finals to study for. Why don&rsquo;t you ask that friend of yours you had a crush on? The one with the bookshop. Whatshisface. It&rsquo;s on the tip of my tongue.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley winced when he came to the conclusion, &ldquo;Ezra? I haven&rsquo;t talked to him in months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you best start talking to him again. He said that before he had his bookshop, he had a job at a daycare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When did he tell you that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I was seven and you took me to the park by his shop every weekend so you could admire him from afar. This one time you finally built up the courage to take me into his shop with the promise of a new book, which you never got me by the way, you two got talking and he just casually dropped it into the conversation. But then again, you might have been so nervous it went right over your head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that might have been it,&rdquo; Crowley admitted more to himself than to his niece. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him a call. You&rsquo;re my hero, Anathema.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the girl said. Crowley could hear the smug smirk on her face on the other end of the line. &ldquo;You can call me for some quick advice, but please know that I&rsquo;m going to be busy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gotcha. I&rsquo;ll talk to you later then. Tell your mum I said hi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will do. See ya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right. See ya,&rdquo; and he ended the call. He went back into his contacts and scrolled down to the letter E. However, he was so preoccupied with his phone that he didn&rsquo;t notice something, or rather someone, leaning over the backrest of the bench.</p><p>&ldquo;You called?&rdquo; Ezra Fell, local bookshop keeper and historical non-fiction* author &lsquo;Aziraphale&rsquo;, asked with a satisfied smirk on his face.</p><p>(*This was a point of contention between Ezra and his literary agent. Where Ezra didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable calling his books historical &ldquo;non-fiction&rdquo;. His novels were, after all, primarily based on vague records and nearly non-existent witness accounts. However, his agent insisted on the label, since, according to them, the very label itself would sell more copies.)</p><p>Crowley flinched, but didn&rsquo;t shriek. Not even a little bit. Not if you asked him, at least. &ldquo;What are you doing here?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just feeding the ducks some old oats when I heard a familiar voice say my name, so I decided to investigate,&rdquo; the man said as he walked around the bench to sit down next to Crowley. &ldquo;Did you know bread is actually really bad for ducks?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Crowley said simply, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what about the baby? Did I miss something big?&rdquo; Ezra asked as he tossed some oats to the ground. Ducks came rushing from the pond and Adam giggled at the sight of the waddling birds. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;d assume you&rsquo;d let me know if you had a baby, somehow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My boss took her fianc&eacute; on a vacation to Croatia, she&rsquo;s probably going to propose, so I&rsquo;m looking after their son until they come home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Since when do you know anything about taking care of a baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m just generally very good at following her very particular instructions,&rdquo; Crowley said as he produced a stack of instructions from a bright blue diaper bag, roughly the size of The Fellowship Of The Ring. &ldquo;That and she trusts me, I guess. I was actually hoping you could help me with these.&rdquo;</p><p>A small &lsquo;my goodness&rsquo; escaped Ezra as he eyed the stack of loose pages. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for him?&rdquo; He asked, pointing at Adam.</p><p>&ldquo;Look out, mister!&rdquo; A young voice called from behind them, but Crowley paid it no mind.</p><p>&ldquo;It is, trust me. It&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; Crowley bit his tongue as a football hit him in the back of the head, knocking his shades off his face and the pages out of his hand. As luck would have it, a breeze picked up, carrying the pages away from them and into the duck pond.</p><p>Adam giggled and clapped his tiny hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh dear&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><hr /></p>",

        "body": "<p>Chapter: 2/5</p><p>Words: 3418</p><p>Relationships: Aziraphale/Crowley</p><p>Adam reasons that if Heaven and Hell just got to know each other a bit \nbetter, they wouldn\u2019t be so keen to start another Apocalypse. They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026</p><!-- more --><p>Aziraphale\nstood in the park*, waiting for his date to turn up. He had been matched with a\ndemon this time. It cheered him. This was concerning on one level, but\nconsidering the person he got on with best was in fact, a demon, Aziraphale had\nchosen to take it as a good sign.</p><p>*Not\nSt. James. He didn\u2019t quite know <i>why</i>,\nbut to go there with someone other than Crowley just seemed\u2026wrong, somehow.</p><p>After\nall, angels had a habit of being rather stuffy and self-important. Aziraphale\nwould know, being somewhat inclined that way himself, but he knew deep down he\ncould never <i>ever</i> be anywhere near as\nbad as Gabriel. Something about Heaven brought it out in you. It was more than\nenough reason to avoid going Up There on it\u2019s own, not to mention all the other\nwonderful earthly delights it lacked. </p><p>Aziraphale\ndid not want that in a partner. He needed someone who could make light of\nthings, who wouldn\u2019t take everything so very seriously and so very heavily. <br/></p><p>It\nwas something he had always admired about Crowley. Even when the poor dear was\nclearly anxious and suffering, Crowley still had that strange streak of\noptimism, a way of seeing the light in most situations. He never let\nAziraphale wallow for long. Crowley seemed to know exactly when Aziraphale needed to be left alone, and when to show up at the shop and demand to be let in, knowing he\nneeded the company.</p><p>\u00a0A\nloud honking cut through his thoughts. <br/></p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t the low, nearly dignified sounds you hear on cars these days. Oh no.\nThis was a proper wheezing honk, the kind uttered by an old run down hulk that\ncrawled out of a junkyard, coughing smoke and spewing exhaust every which way\nlike the dying throes of some beast. </p><p>There\nwas a sinking sort of dread creeping on the angel as he looked and saw the\nsound was not, in fact, coming from a car, but from a rickety old unicycle. The\nfigure riding it was short, dressed in a battered top hat and a huge overcoat,\nand yes, a demon. <br/></p><p>Oh\ndear.</p><p>The\ndemon hopped down from the unicycle and made his way over. </p><p>He\nstopped short at seeing Aziraphale, actually rocking back on the heels of\nhis overly large shoes. He pointed at the angel, threw his head back, and\nlaughed silently, his whole body shaking with it.</p><p>\u201cE-excuse\nme?\u201d bristled Aziraphale.\u201cJust what is so funny?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon waddled over to him and plucked at Aziraphale\u2019s coat, grinning. \u201cI <i>like</i> this coat*,\u201d said Aziraphale defensively. He\nswatted the demon\u2019s hand away from his bow-tie, \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with a\nbow-tie! You can hardly talk anyway.\u201d</p><p>*The\ncoat in question was perhaps a bit on the old side, but it had been through so\nmuch with the angel, and was so very comfortable that he hadn\u2019t the heart to\nget rid of it. It didn\u2019t show it\u2019s age so very much, really. It simply\u2026was a bit dated\nperhaps. </p><p>The\ndemon plopped himself down on a nearby bench, swinging his short legs happily\nand whistling. Aziraphale bit back a sigh and followed, making absolutely sure\nto check he wasn\u2019t about to sit on anything nefarious before sitting down.</p><p>\u201cYour\nname is Wasco, is that right?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon beamed at him, nodding enthusiastically. <br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nah\u2014\u201d he watched warily as Wasco pulled a long thin balloon out of his pocket.\nHe diligently bent it into the shape of a dog. \u201cEr. Well done,\u201d said\nAziraphale. Wasco handed the dog to him and rummaged though the huge pockets of\nhis coat. He produced a comically large pin. </p><p>Aziraphale only had time to think <i>oh no</i>,\nbefore\u2014 <br/></p><p><i>POP</i></p><p>Little bits of colourful rubber landed around them. A baby in a pram\nnearby started to cry, startled by the noise. Wasco rocked back and forth in\nsilent laughter. </p><p>Well.\nHe had asked for someone with a sense of humor. Perhaps he should have been\nmore specific?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbrushed the bits of balloon off his coat. He thought better of it and miracled\nthem away, not wanting some poor animal to choke on it.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t talk much, do you?\u201d he tried.</p><p>There\nwas a negative honking sound from deep inside the overcoat.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\nHave you, er\u2026are you by any chance familiar with Punch and Judy? Eh&hellip;Charlie\nChaplin? Harpo Marx?\u201d</p><p>Wasco\ngrabbed his hand and shook it wildly.</p><p>\u201cI-I\nthought so.\u201d He yelped as a shock ran through him. The demon\u2019s hand detached\nentirely. Wasco laughed, kicking his short legs. Aziraphale sighed. \u201cVery\nfunny.\u201d He gave the hand back. Wasco promptly jumped up on the bench and hurled\nthe fake hand into the pond, scattering the few ducks still out in the cold.</p><p>Hastily,\nAziraphale miracled the electricity out of the toy before it could do any\ndamage. Wasco frowned at him. \u201cThe ducks wouldn\u2019t have liked that,\u201d defended\nAziraphale. Wasco stuck his tongue out.</p><p>\u201cYou\nhaven\u2019t been up here recently, have you?\u201d <br/></p><p>Wasco\nshook his head. He pointed at the ducks and grinned. They were funny\nlooking creatures. Aziraphale had always liked that about ducks, the way they\nwaddled and quacked and somehow managed to be quite fearsome when the mood\nstruck. <br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nlike it up here though, don\u2019t you?\u201d Wasco nodded happily and sat back down.\n\u201cWhen were you last on earth?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon paused. He sat back on the bench, crossing one arm over his chest and\ncupping his chin in an exaggerated thinking gesture. Then he straightened, and\nturned to Aziraphale.</p><p>Wasco\nheld up a finger and traced it down through the air in an arc, whistling as it\nwent. When it hit the bench he spread his hands apart, mimicking an explosion.</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh I see.\u201d Likely one of the great wars. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon dug through his pockets and produced a glaringly coloured, polka dotted\nhandkerchief. There was a loud honking sound as he blew his nose obnoxiously.\nHe courteously offered it to the angel.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nno. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Wasco\nshrugged and tossed it over the back of the bench.</p><p>They\nsat in silence for a long minute, Aziraphale struggling to think of something\nto say and Wasco cheerfully rummaging through his huge pockets, ominous\nclanking sounds coming from their depths.</p><p>At\nleast it was a nice day. It was sunny for winter, and warm enough to make an\nouting pleasant. </p><p>Wasco\nturned in his seat, staring over the back of the bench at the busy intersection\nbehind them. Then he raised his finger. He pulled a stick of dynamite out of\nhis coat. The tip began to fizzle.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nheart skipped a beat as he realized that <i>yes</i>,\nthat was real dynamite, and yes, Wasco drawing his arm back to throw it at the\nintersection.</p><p>He\nonly had a second to act.</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d said Aziraphale. </p><p>The\ndynamite disappeared. Wasco turned to him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThat\nis <i>not </i>funny, Wasco,\u201d he started lowly, adrenaline turning his voice sharp.\n\u201cThat could have seriously hurt someone! You could have <i>killed</i> all of those people! Is that what you wanted?\u201d The edge of divine wrath had seeped into his voice, making his eyes glow faintly. \u201c I <i>won\u2019t</i> have it. It\u2019s not funny\nif\u2026oh.\u201d </p><p>Wasco\nwas shrinking back from him, visibly frightened. <br/></p><p>Aziraphale deflated. He hadn\u2019t\nmeant to scare the demon that badly. But he couldn\u2019t go around killing people.\nAnd certainly not in Aziraphale\u2019s city. </p><p>The\nangel pursed his lips. Wasco really was only a small little thing. He couldn\u2019t\nhave been much more than an imp. And it was clear he wasn\u2019t intending to be\nmalicious, just\u2026mischievous. </p><p>\u201cHumans\nare fragile,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey won\u2019t bounce back from something like\nthat.\u201d</p><p>Wasco was still terrified. Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>\u201cOh\ndear. I\u2019m sorry for scaring you.\u201d And then he was suddenly struck with inspiration. \u201cOh? Now, what\u2019s this? There\u2019s something behind your ear\u2026\u201d</p><p>The angel produced a large daisy. Wasco stared at it with huge eyes. Then he broke into a\ndelighted grin.</p><p><i>I knew it would come in handy</i>, thought Aziraphale\nto himself proudly.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>This\ntime, Crowley was paired with an angel. He was feeling tentatively optimistic\nabout it. Aziraphale was an angel, for one, and Crowley considered himself <i>the</i> Aziraphale expert. He was certain he\ncould handle what ever this angel had to throw at him. He couldn\u2019t be much\nworse than Aziraphale on a bad day, could he?</p><p>Crowley\narrived in the courtyard they had agreed to meet at, fifteen minutes early. His\ndate was already there.</p><p>Hasdiel,\nthe angel, was sitting cross-legged on the steps in front of a winged statue,\nhands clasped in prayer, eyes closed. Tears streaked down his face. <br/></p><p>Crowley\nslowed, taking in the angels\u2019 pristine white robes and faint shimmery aura that\nwas just visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Well\nbugger. This one didn\u2019t spend much time on earth, Crowley would bet his custom-made watch on that. </p><p>Still.\nIt could go all right.<br/></p><p>Hasdiel\nopened his eyes. \u201cDemon,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI have prayed unto our Heavenly Father for deliverance from your\nwiles. I shall not be tempted in your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\nHi. Nice one.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nrose to his feet in a graceful shimmery movement. He blinked slowly at Crowley,\nmore tears running down his face. <br/></p><p>\u201cUm.\nAre you\u2014\u201d Crowley gestured at his face, \u201c\u2014all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nfeel the suffering of all beings,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cTheir earthly pain expresses\nitself through me. To pray for their souls is my calling.\u201d </p><p><i>Very funny Adam, very funny</i>, thought Crowley wildly. <i>This is what I get for asking for\ncompassion, is it?</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026you\ndon\u2019t get out much?\u201d he tried.<br/></p><p>Hasdiel\nblinked at him.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nlet\u2019s start over? I\u2019m Crowley.\u201d He held out his hand. Hasdiel stared at it.\nCrowley took it back awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s Ok. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare the serpent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d Crowley awkwardly stuck his hands in his pockets. He took\nthem back out again, and wondered what he was supposed to do with them.</p><p>Hasdiel\nwatched him warily, tears still dripping down his face.</p><p>\u201cLook.\nI promise not to hurt you, all right? It\u2019s not my style anyway*. I won\u2019t tempt\nyou. I don\u2019t think Adam would be happy about any of that. It\u2019s not, y\u2019know, the\npoint of this whole\u2014\u201d he waved a hand. \u201cThing. Dating thing, y\u2019know? So don\u2019t\nworry about it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>*Crowley\nhad never physically harmed Aziraphale. The thought actually sickened him. It\nhad been hard enough actively working against him. Not because the angel was\ntoo cunning, Crowley simply\u2026hated seeing Aziraphale upset. Luckily\nAziraphale had been of a similar mind, and even if their formal Arrangement was\nrelatively new, they\u2019d come to an unspoken agreement early on not to doing\nanything intentionally harmful to the other.</p><p>Hasdiel\nsaid: \u201cYou are not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed awkwardly. \u201cWell. I\u2019ve been up here about six thousand years. They\u2019ll\nrub off on you, humans.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere still standing at this point, which Crowley thought was a bit ridiculous.\nHe sat down on the step beside the angel slowly, trying not to startle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\nHasdiel was watching him, curiosity plain on his face. \u201cYou <i>like</i> humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yeah.\u201d\nCrowley shrugged, looking away. \u201cYeah, I do. They\u2019re interesting. You never\nknow what they\u2019ll come up with next.\u201d <br/></p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him like he\u2019d just sprouted another head. Crowley nearly checked just\nto make sure he hadn\u2019t*.</p><p>*Normally\nhe had a very good control of his body, but everyone once in a while there were\nlittle slip-ups. Aziraphale got them too, little slips of the subconscious,\nphysically manifesting in sometimes rather alarming ways. It was bloody\nannoying. <br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\n<i>do</i> feel compassion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\u201d\nCrowley ran a hand through his hair, a blush starting up his cheeks. \u201cMmh. Yea.\nDon\u2019t, um. Spread it around? M\u2019 demon, see? It\u2019s bad for my reputation.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nwas still staring at him as if he\u2019d had some major life-altering epiphany.\nCrowley was all for epiphanies, he just preferred if they didn\u2019t happen to\nother people on his time.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nare you all right?\u201d he tried. \u201cDid you want to get something to eat? That\nusually cheers Aziraphale up.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\njolted, coming back to himself. \u201cAziraphale,\u201d he said, something hard coming\ninto his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nknow, Guardian of the Eastern Gate? He\u2019s a frien\u2014er. We run into each other\ndown here. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\nI do not, and I am glad for it. That angel will Fall very soon and join the\nrest of the filth where he belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d\nsaid Crowley. And then he realized Hasdiel wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cOh.\u201d His opinion of the angel dropped sharply. </p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\nHasdiel took Crowley\u2019s hand. Crowley nearly flinched back. Azriaphale\u2019s hands\nwere warm and wan, and whenever they had touched it filled Crowley with an\nincredible feeling of comfort, of safety.</p><p>Hasdiel\u2019s\nfingers were feather light and cool, and brought none of the comfort he had\ncome to associate with Aziraphale. </p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel levelly, hand tight around his own.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nwhat?\u201d Crowley silently cursed his mind for going right to the gutter.</p><p>\u201cWe\nmust pray for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNhk\u2026what?\nWait, <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\nsoul is not yet wholly corrupted,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cThere is still hope. You can\nstill be returned to the glory of Heaven and to our blessed Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa hold on!\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cSurely\nyou want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201c <br/></p><p>Crowley\ndid lie awake some nights wondering and regretting\u2014but he didn\u2019t miss Heaven.\nFor all he hated Hell, Heaven wasn\u2019t that much better*. And if he did switch\nsides, what where the chances he\u2019d get posted on earth?</p><p>*Especially\nto hear Aziraphale talk about it. Oh they wouldn\u2019t torture you outright. No,\nthat was uncouth. But they had their ways of making you just as sorry as Hell could, Aziraphale had bitterly recounted, deep in his cups. It was a matter of aesthetics. At least Hell had\nthe decency to be upfront about it. </p><p>Earth\nwas where it was at. Earth was his home, it was his <i>side</i>, what he and Aziraphale had fought and nearly died for. Heaven\nand Hell could go bugger off. He wanted no part of their bloody pissing match.</p><p>Crowley\npulled his hand out of the angels\u2019 grip. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got it wrong. I don\u2019t\nwant to go to Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him in confusion. \u201cBut you are sullied as you are. Your soul is\nunclean and damned. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t need help. I\u2019m happy as I am, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\ncan you be, burdened by sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\njust am, Ok? It\u2019s different on earth. I can live by my own moral code,\nnot follow any one side blindly.\u201d Crowley was getting increasingly offended.</p><p>\u201cYou\nneed not be afraid,\u201d said Hasdiel, expression benevolent. \u201cIf you bare yourself\nbefore our Holy Father, you can still be saved. You <i>must</i> ask for absolution. He would want that, Crowley.\u2019 <br/></p><p>\u201cWell\n<i>I</i> don\u2019t!\u201d snapped Crowley. \u201cIt\u2019s a Hell of a lot more\ncomplicated than all of that! You think just because you\u2019re an angel and you\nlive in Heaven you\u2019re pure as a daisy\u2014well that\u2019s not how it works! You make\nyour choices everyday with every action\u2014and if you think for one minute we\u2019re\nexempt from it\u2014 you\u2019re wrong! You have to think about what you <i>do</i>, not just do\nwhat you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>Crowley was reeling. Aziraphale had never made him feel as low as this angel had. Aziraphale <i>respected</i> him. He\u2019d never force Crowley to repent. <br/></p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel, holding out his hand. Tears glistened on his face. \u201cBe clean\nagain. Leave this filth behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck</i> you!\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nstormed off from the weeping angel, feeling something treacherously like tears\nprickling at his own eyes. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>Sitting\nin his favourite armchair, Aziraphale stared into his mug of cocoa and wondered\nwhy people willingly subjected themselves to dating.</p><p>It\nwas\u2026true, that he\u2019d met some interesting people. Certainly. </p><p>Had\nhe enjoyed himself? No. Not at all.</p><p>He\nsighed. A sense of humor was important. But he\u2019d been hoping for something a\nbit more advanced than slapstick! That should have been a given. There needed\nto be some element of sophistication to it.</p><p>Wasco\nhadn\u2019t understood the difference between a harmless prank and a deadly attack.\nAziraphale needed someone who did. Someone with a strong sense of morality.\nLike Crowley. <br/></p><p>That\nhalted his thoughts in their tracks.</p><p>Crowley\nknew right from wrong. He had <i>always</i>\nknown, Aziraphale realized. And what\u2019s more, he acted on it. Even when it put\nhim in a bad position, Crowley was rarely cruel. He was considerate. He\nbalanced everything excellently, doing his job and performing acts of low-grade\nevil while at the same time avoiding as much actual harm as he could.</p><p>And\nhe knew what lines shouldn\u2019t be crossed. Crowley had never burned a book. He\u2019d<i> stopped</i> book burnings, simply because\nhe knew Aziraphale would be upset by it.</p><p>A\nwarm feeling was building in his chest.</p><p>A\nlow ringing shook him from his thoughts. It was his mobile phone. </p><p>\u201cCrowley!\u201d\nhe said delightedly. \u201cMy dear boy, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\u201d\nIt was nearly a sigh. He sounded tired. The angel frowned. <br/></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou all right? Is something the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026talk\nto me? Please?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, my dear,\u201d said Aziraphale softly, wondering just what had happened to\nput him in such a mood. \u201cWell\u2026how about I tell you something I\u2019ve discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\nWhat did you find?\u201d Crowley\u2019s voice was still exhausted, but there was a note\nof fondness in it now.</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>, my dear, are a shining beacon of\nmorality,\u201d said Aziraphale proudly.</p><p>There\nwas a strangled sound down the line.</p><p>\u201cNo\nno, it\u2019s true. And I won\u2019t be budged on it!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014I\nmust say, though I worry for your ego\u2014you are terribly sophisticated as well. I\nsee that now.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Sophisticated</i>.\u201d Crowley gave a small\nlaugh. \u201cOoh. I like that. Yeah. I am sophisticated, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo-<i>someone</i>. What kind of dates have you\nbeen having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think this last one was much more than an imp. Jittery little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImps\nhave about two brain cells they have to share between the lot of them.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot very nice,\u201d chided Aziraphale. \u201cThough of course I can\u2019t say as much, but I\nthink you may be on to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a bit like dating Harpo Marx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n<i>no</i>. That bad?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAfraid\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor\nsomeone\u2019s sake.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen those films in ages.\u201d<br/>\n Aziraphale made a noise in agreement.\n\u201cToo bad he wasn\u2019t more like Groucho. He was more your style, if I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nwhat can I say? I appreciate someone who can talk circles around everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough\nit was nice to have someone appreciate my magic tricks,\u201d mused Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cOh\nno. I\u2019ve not been neglecting you, have I? You haven\u2019t been carrying a pack of\ncards around all this time, heartbroken, just waiting for me to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>. I\u2019m simply glad I know the skill.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. It was such a nice sound. Aziraphale pressed his mobile closer to his\near. \u201cAre you feeling any better, my dear?\u201d </p><p>There\nwas a breathy sigh. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas my pleasure,\u201d said Aziraphale softly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nnot\u2014<i>thank</i> you. Aziraphale.\nFor\u2026respecting me. As I am. Not\u2014trying to make me something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t see what\u2019s not to like about you,\u201d said Aziraphale hotly, meaning every\nword. Crowley made a small sound down the line. \u201cWhy? Dare I ask what your\ndates have been like?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026How\nabout I tell you later. We\u2019ll get together after this thing is over and drink\nabout it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\ndear, I would like nothing better.\u201d</p><p>There\nwas the sound of paper crinkling. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get this damn quiz done.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\ngrimaced. \u201cYes, me too. Suppose we\u2019d ought to get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe<i>ah</i>.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere both silent for a long moment. Neither wanted to hang up.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\nThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\nYou are very welcome. You know you can call me any time. After all, it\u2019s not\nlike I\u2019ll be sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCrowley laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great things about you. You\u2019re dependable.\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nfelt much better once he got off the phone with Aziraphale. He usually did. <br/></p><p>\u201cAlright\nAdam,\u201d he said, glaring down at the quiz. \u201cI see how it is.\u201d</p><p>It\ndemanded honesty, but you also had to spell everything out for the damn thing. He\u2019d\nhave to think of it like some bloody-minded contract. </p><p>\u201cCompassionate,\nyes,\u201d said Crowley, bouncing his pen on his leg. \u201cBut they have to be\nopen-minded. Someone who will look past appearances and at least <i>try</i> to get to know me\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nsophisticated\u201d, decided Aziraphale, filling out his quiz. \u201cCharming.\u201d The angel\ndrummed his fingers against his desk. <br/></p><p>\u201cAnd an excellent conversationalist\u2026\u201d</p>",

But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>Aziraphale\nstood in the park*, waiting for his date to turn up. He had been matched with a\ndemon this time. It cheered him. This was concerning on one level, but\nconsidering the person he got on with best was in fact, a demon, Aziraphale had\nchosen to take it as a good sign.</p><p>*Not\nSt. James. He didn\u2019t quite know <i>why</i>,\nbut to go there with someone other than Crowley just seemed\u2026wrong, somehow.</p><p>After\nall, angels had a habit of being rather stuffy and self-important. Aziraphale\nwould know, being somewhat inclined that way himself, but he knew deep down he\ncould never <i>ever</i> be anywhere near as\nbad as Gabriel. Something about Heaven brought it out in you. It was more than\nenough reason to avoid going Up There on it\u2019s own, not to mention all the other\nwonderful earthly delights it lacked. </p><p>Aziraphale\ndid not want that in a partner. He needed someone who could make light of\nthings, who wouldn\u2019t take everything so very seriously and so very heavily. <br></p><p>It\nwas something he had always admired about Crowley. Even when the poor dear was\nclearly anxious and suffering, Crowley still had that strange streak of\noptimism, a way of seeing the light in most situations. He never let\nAziraphale wallow for long. Crowley seemed to know exactly when Aziraphale needed to be left alone, and when to show up at the shop and demand to be let in, knowing he\nneeded the company.</p><p>\u00a0A\nloud honking cut through his thoughts. <br></p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t the low, nearly dignified sounds you hear on cars these days. Oh no.\nThis was a proper wheezing honk, the kind uttered by an old run down hulk that\ncrawled out of a junkyard, coughing smoke and spewing exhaust every which way\nlike the dying throes of some beast. </p><p>There\nwas a sinking sort of dread creeping on the angel as he looked and saw the\nsound was not, in fact, coming from a car, but from a rickety old unicycle. The\nfigure riding it was short, dressed in a battered top hat and a huge overcoat,\nand yes, a demon. <br></p><p>Oh\ndear.</p><p>The\ndemon hopped down from the unicycle and made his way over. </p><p>He\nstopped short at seeing Aziraphale, actually rocking back on the heels of\nhis overly large shoes. He pointed at the angel, threw his head back, and\nlaughed silently, his whole body shaking with it.</p><p>\u201cE-excuse\nme?\u201d bristled Aziraphale.\u201cJust what is so funny?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon waddled over to him and plucked at Aziraphale\u2019s coat, grinning. \u201cI <i>like</i> this coat*,\u201d said Aziraphale defensively. He\nswatted the demon\u2019s hand away from his bow-tie, \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with a\nbow-tie! You can hardly talk anyway.\u201d</p><p>*The\ncoat in question was perhaps a bit on the old side, but it had been through so\nmuch with the angel, and was so very comfortable that he hadn\u2019t the heart to\nget rid of it. It didn\u2019t show it\u2019s age so very much, really. It simply\u2026was a bit dated\nperhaps. </p><p>The\ndemon plopped himself down on a nearby bench, swinging his short legs happily\nand whistling. Aziraphale bit back a sigh and followed, making absolutely sure\nto check he wasn\u2019t about to sit on anything nefarious before sitting down.</p><p>\u201cYour\nname is Wasco, is that right?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon beamed at him, nodding enthusiastically. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nah\u2014\u201d he watched warily as Wasco pulled a long thin balloon out of his pocket.\nHe diligently bent it into the shape of a dog. \u201cEr. Well done,\u201d said\nAziraphale. Wasco handed the dog to him and rummaged though the huge pockets of\nhis coat. He produced a comically large pin. </p><p>Aziraphale only had time to think <i>oh no</i>,\nbefore\u2014 <br></p><p><i>POP</i></p><p>Little bits of colourful rubber landed around them. A baby in a pram\nnearby started to cry, startled by the noise. Wasco rocked back and forth in\nsilent laughter. </p><p>Well.\nHe had asked for someone with a sense of humor. Perhaps he should have been\nmore specific?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbrushed the bits of balloon off his coat. He thought better of it and miracled\nthem away, not wanting some poor animal to choke on it.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t talk much, do you?\u201d he tried.</p><p>There\nwas a negative honking sound from deep inside the overcoat.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\nHave you, er\u2026are you by any chance familiar with Punch and Judy? Eh\u2026Charlie\nChaplin? Harpo Marx?\u201d</p><p>Wasco\ngrabbed his hand and shook it wildly.</p><p>\u201cI-I\nthought so.\u201d He yelped as a shock ran through him. The demon\u2019s hand detached\nentirely. Wasco laughed, kicking his short legs. Aziraphale sighed. \u201cVery\nfunny.\u201d He gave the hand back. Wasco promptly jumped up on the bench and hurled\nthe fake hand into the pond, scattering the few ducks still out in the cold.</p><p>Hastily,\nAziraphale miracled the electricity out of the toy before it could do any\ndamage. Wasco frowned at him. \u201cThe ducks wouldn\u2019t have liked that,\u201d defended\nAziraphale. Wasco stuck his tongue out.</p><p>\u201cYou\nhaven\u2019t been up here recently, have you?\u201d <br></p><p>Wasco\nshook his head. He pointed at the ducks and grinned. They were funny\nlooking creatures. Aziraphale had always liked that about ducks, the way they\nwaddled and quacked and somehow managed to be quite fearsome when the mood\nstruck. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nlike it up here though, don\u2019t you?\u201d Wasco nodded happily and sat back down.\n\u201cWhen were you last on earth?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon paused. He sat back on the bench, crossing one arm over his chest and\ncupping his chin in an exaggerated thinking gesture. Then he straightened, and\nturned to Aziraphale.</p><p>Wasco\nheld up a finger and traced it down through the air in an arc, whistling as it\nwent. When it hit the bench he spread his hands apart, mimicking an explosion.</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh I see.\u201d Likely one of the great wars. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon dug through his pockets and produced a glaringly coloured, polka dotted\nhandkerchief. There was a loud honking sound as he blew his nose obnoxiously.\nHe courteously offered it to the angel.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nno. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Wasco\nshrugged and tossed it over the back of the bench.</p><p>They\nsat in silence for a long minute, Aziraphale struggling to think of something\nto say and Wasco cheerfully rummaging through his huge pockets, ominous\nclanking sounds coming from their depths.</p><p>At\nleast it was a nice day. It was sunny for winter, and warm enough to make an\nouting pleasant. </p><p>Wasco\nturned in his seat, staring over the back of the bench at the busy intersection\nbehind them. Then he raised his finger. He pulled a stick of dynamite out of\nhis coat. The tip began to fizzle.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nheart skipped a beat as he realized that <i>yes</i>,\nthat was real dynamite, and yes, Wasco drawing his arm back to throw it at the\nintersection.</p><p>He\nonly had a second to act.</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d said Aziraphale. </p><p>The\ndynamite disappeared. Wasco turned to him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThat\nis <i>not </i>funny, Wasco,\u201d he started lowly, adrenaline turning his voice sharp.\n\u201cThat could have seriously hurt someone! You could have <i>killed</i> all of those people! Is that what you wanted?\u201d The edge of divine wrath had seeped into his voice, making his eyes glow faintly. \u201c I <i>won\u2019t</i> have it. It\u2019s not funny\nif\u2026oh.\u201d </p><p>Wasco\nwas shrinking back from him, visibly frightened. <br></p><p>Aziraphale deflated. He hadn\u2019t\nmeant to scare the demon that badly. But he couldn\u2019t go around killing people.\nAnd certainly not in Aziraphale\u2019s city. </p><p>The\nangel pursed his lips. Wasco really was only a small little thing. He couldn\u2019t\nhave been much more than an imp. And it was clear he wasn\u2019t intending to be\nmalicious, just\u2026mischievous. </p><p>\u201cHumans\nare fragile,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey won\u2019t bounce back from something like\nthat.\u201d</p><p>Wasco was still terrified. Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>\u201cOh\ndear. I\u2019m sorry for scaring you.\u201d And then he was suddenly struck with inspiration. \u201cOh? Now, what\u2019s this? There\u2019s something behind your ear\u2026\u201d</p><p>The angel produced a large daisy. Wasco stared at it with huge eyes. Then he broke into a\ndelighted grin.</p><p><i>I knew it would come in handy</i>, thought Aziraphale\nto himself proudly.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>This\ntime, Crowley was paired with an angel. He was feeling tentatively optimistic\nabout it. Aziraphale was an angel, for one, and Crowley considered himself <i>the</i> Aziraphale expert. He was certain he\ncould handle what ever this angel had to throw at him. He couldn\u2019t be much\nworse than Aziraphale on a bad day, could he?</p><p>Crowley\narrived in the courtyard they had agreed to meet at, fifteen minutes early. His\ndate was already there.</p><p>Hasdiel,\nthe angel, was sitting cross-legged on the steps in front of a winged statue,\nhands clasped in prayer, eyes closed. Tears streaked down his face. <br></p><p>Crowley\nslowed, taking in the angels\u2019 pristine white robes and faint shimmery aura that\nwas just visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Well\nbugger. This one didn\u2019t spend much time on earth, Crowley would bet his custom-made watch on that. </p><p>Still.\nIt could go all right.<br></p><p>Hasdiel\nopened his eyes. \u201cDemon,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI have prayed unto our Heavenly Father for deliverance from your\nwiles. I shall not be tempted in your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\nHi. Nice one.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nrose to his feet in a graceful shimmery movement. He blinked slowly at Crowley,\nmore tears running down his face. <br></p><p>\u201cUm.\nAre you\u2014\u201d Crowley gestured at his face, \u201c\u2014all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nfeel the suffering of all beings,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cTheir earthly pain expresses\nitself through me. To pray for their souls is my calling.\u201d </p><p><i>Very funny Adam, very funny</i>, thought Crowley wildly. <i>This is what I get for asking for\ncompassion, is it?</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026you\ndon\u2019t get out much?\u201d he tried.<br></p><p>Hasdiel\nblinked at him.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nlet\u2019s start over? I\u2019m Crowley.\u201d He held out his hand. Hasdiel stared at it.\nCrowley took it back awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s Ok. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare the serpent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d Crowley awkwardly stuck his hands in his pockets. He took\nthem back out again, and wondered what he was supposed to do with them.</p><p>Hasdiel\nwatched him warily, tears still dripping down his face.</p><p>\u201cLook.\nI promise not to hurt you, all right? It\u2019s not my style anyway*. I won\u2019t tempt\nyou. I don\u2019t think Adam would be happy about any of that. It\u2019s not, y\u2019know, the\npoint of this whole\u2014\u201d he waved a hand. \u201cThing. Dating thing, y\u2019know? So don\u2019t\nworry about it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>*Crowley\nhad never physically harmed Aziraphale. The thought actually sickened him. It\nhad been hard enough actively working against him. Not because the angel was\ntoo cunning, Crowley simply\u2026hated seeing Aziraphale upset. Luckily\nAziraphale had been of a similar mind, and even if their formal Arrangement was\nrelatively new, they\u2019d come to an unspoken agreement early on not to doing\nanything intentionally harmful to the other.</p><p>Hasdiel\nsaid: \u201cYou are not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed awkwardly. \u201cWell. I\u2019ve been up here about six thousand years. They\u2019ll\nrub off on you, humans.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere still standing at this point, which Crowley thought was a bit ridiculous.\nHe sat down on the step beside the angel slowly, trying not to startle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\nHasdiel was watching him, curiosity plain on his face. \u201cYou <i>like</i> humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yeah.\u201d\nCrowley shrugged, looking away. \u201cYeah, I do. They\u2019re interesting. You never\nknow what they\u2019ll come up with next.\u201d <br></p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him like he\u2019d just sprouted another head. Crowley nearly checked just\nto make sure he hadn\u2019t*.</p><p>*Normally\nhe had a very good control of his body, but everyone once in a while there were\nlittle slip-ups. Aziraphale got them too, little slips of the subconscious,\nphysically manifesting in sometimes rather alarming ways. It was bloody\nannoying. <br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\n<i>do</i> feel compassion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\u201d\nCrowley ran a hand through his hair, a blush starting up his cheeks. \u201cMmh. Yea.\nDon\u2019t, um. Spread it around? M\u2019 demon, see? It\u2019s bad for my reputation.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nwas still staring at him as if he\u2019d had some major life-altering epiphany.\nCrowley was all for epiphanies, he just preferred if they didn\u2019t happen to\nother people on his time.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nare you all right?\u201d he tried. \u201cDid you want to get something to eat? That\nusually cheers Aziraphale up.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\njolted, coming back to himself. \u201cAziraphale,\u201d he said, something hard coming\ninto his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nknow, Guardian of the Eastern Gate? He\u2019s a frien\u2014er. We run into each other\ndown here. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\nI do not, and I am glad for it. That angel will Fall very soon and join the\nrest of the filth where he belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d\nsaid Crowley. And then he realized Hasdiel wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cOh.\u201d His opinion of the angel dropped sharply. </p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\nHasdiel took Crowley\u2019s hand. Crowley nearly flinched back. Azriaphale\u2019s hands\nwere warm and wan, and whenever they had touched it filled Crowley with an\nincredible feeling of comfort, of safety.</p><p>Hasdiel\u2019s\nfingers were feather light and cool, and brought none of the comfort he had\ncome to associate with Aziraphale. </p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel levelly, hand tight around his own.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nwhat?\u201d Crowley silently cursed his mind for going right to the gutter.</p><p>\u201cWe\nmust pray for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNhk\u2026what?\nWait, <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\nsoul is not yet wholly corrupted,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cThere is still hope. You can\nstill be returned to the glory of Heaven and to our blessed Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa hold on!\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cSurely\nyou want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201c <br></p><p>Crowley\ndid lie awake some nights wondering and regretting\u2014but he didn\u2019t miss Heaven.\nFor all he hated Hell, Heaven wasn\u2019t that much better*. And if he did switch\nsides, what where the chances he\u2019d get posted on earth?</p><p>*Especially\nto hear Aziraphale talk about it. Oh they wouldn\u2019t torture you outright. No,\nthat was uncouth. But they had their ways of making you just as sorry as Hell could, Aziraphale had bitterly recounted, deep in his cups. It was a matter of aesthetics. At least Hell had\nthe decency to be upfront about it. </p><p>Earth\nwas where it was at. Earth was his home, it was his <i>side</i>, what he and Aziraphale had fought and nearly died for. Heaven\nand Hell could go bugger off. He wanted no part of their bloody pissing match.</p><p>Crowley\npulled his hand out of the angels\u2019 grip. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got it wrong. I don\u2019t\nwant to go to Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him in confusion. \u201cBut you are sullied as you are. Your soul is\nunclean and damned. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t need help. I\u2019m happy as I am, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\ncan you be, burdened by sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\njust am, Ok? It\u2019s different on earth. I can live by my own moral code,\nnot follow any one side blindly.\u201d Crowley was getting increasingly offended.</p><p>\u201cYou\nneed not be afraid,\u201d said Hasdiel, expression benevolent. \u201cIf you bare yourself\nbefore our Holy Father, you can still be saved. You <i>must</i> ask for absolution. He would want that, Crowley.\u2019 <br></p><p>\u201cWell\n<i>I</i> don\u2019t!\u201d snapped Crowley. \u201cIt\u2019s a Hell of a lot more\ncomplicated than all of that! You think just because you\u2019re an angel and you\nlive in Heaven you\u2019re pure as a daisy\u2014well that\u2019s not how it works! You make\nyour choices everyday with every action\u2014and if you think for one minute we\u2019re\nexempt from it\u2014 you\u2019re wrong! You have to think about what you <i>do</i>, not just do\nwhat you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>Crowley was reeling. Aziraphale had never made him feel as low as this angel had. Aziraphale <i>respected</i> him. He\u2019d never force Crowley to repent. <br></p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel, holding out his hand. Tears glistened on his face. \u201cBe clean\nagain. Leave this filth behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck</i> you!\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nstormed off from the weeping angel, feeling something treacherously like tears\nprickling at his own eyes. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>Sitting\nin his favourite armchair, Aziraphale stared into his mug of cocoa and wondered\nwhy people willingly subjected themselves to dating.</p><p>It\nwas\u2026true, that he\u2019d met some interesting people. Certainly. </p><p>Had\nhe enjoyed himself? No. Not at all.</p><p>He\nsighed. A sense of humor was important. But he\u2019d been hoping for something a\nbit more advanced than slapstick! That should have been a given. There needed\nto be some element of sophistication to it.</p><p>Wasco\nhadn\u2019t understood the difference between a harmless prank and a deadly attack.\nAziraphale needed someone who did. Someone with a strong sense of morality.\nLike Crowley. <br></p><p>That\nhalted his thoughts in their tracks.</p><p>Crowley\nknew right from wrong. He had <i>always</i>\nknown, Aziraphale realized. And what\u2019s more, he acted on it. Even when it put\nhim in a bad position, Crowley was rarely cruel. He was considerate. He\nbalanced everything excellently, doing his job and performing acts of low-grade\nevil while at the same time avoiding as much actual harm as he could.</p><p>And\nhe knew what lines shouldn\u2019t be crossed. Crowley had never burned a book. He\u2019d<i> stopped</i> book burnings, simply because\nhe knew Aziraphale would be upset by it.</p><p>A\nwarm feeling was building in his chest.</p><p>A\nlow ringing shook him from his thoughts. It was his mobile phone. </p><p>\u201cCrowley!\u201d\nhe said delightedly. \u201cMy dear boy, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\u201d\nIt was nearly a sigh. He sounded tired. The angel frowned. <br></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou all right? Is something the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026talk\nto me? Please?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, my dear,\u201d said Aziraphale softly, wondering just what had happened to\nput him in such a mood. \u201cWell\u2026how about I tell you something I\u2019ve discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\nWhat did you find?\u201d Crowley\u2019s voice was still exhausted, but there was a note\nof fondness in it now.</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>, my dear, are a shining beacon of\nmorality,\u201d said Aziraphale proudly.</p><p>There\nwas a strangled sound down the line.</p><p>\u201cNo\nno, it\u2019s true. And I won\u2019t be budged on it!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014I\nmust say, though I worry for your ego\u2014you are terribly sophisticated as well. I\nsee that now.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201c<i>Sophisticated</i>.\u201d Crowley gave a small\nlaugh. \u201cOoh. I like that. Yeah. I am sophisticated, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo-<i>someone</i>. What kind of dates have you\nbeen having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think this last one was much more than an imp. Jittery little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImps\nhave about two brain cells they have to share between the lot of them.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot very nice,\u201d chided Aziraphale. \u201cThough of course I can\u2019t say as much, but I\nthink you may be on to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a bit like dating Harpo Marx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n<i>no</i>. That bad?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAfraid\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor\nsomeone\u2019s sake.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen those films in ages.\u201d<br>\n Aziraphale made a noise in agreement.\n\u201cToo bad he wasn\u2019t more like Groucho. He was more your style, if I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nwhat can I say? I appreciate someone who can talk circles around everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough\nit was nice to have someone appreciate my magic tricks,\u201d mused Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cOh\nno. I\u2019ve not been neglecting you, have I? You haven\u2019t been carrying a pack of\ncards around all this time, heartbroken, just waiting for me to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>. I\u2019m simply glad I know the skill.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. It was such a nice sound. Aziraphale pressed his mobile closer to his\near. \u201cAre you feeling any better, my dear?\u201d </p><p>There\nwas a breathy sigh. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas my pleasure,\u201d said Aziraphale softly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nnot\u2014<i>thank</i> you. Aziraphale.\nFor\u2026respecting me. As I am. Not\u2014trying to make me something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t see what\u2019s not to like about you,\u201d said Aziraphale hotly, meaning every\nword. Crowley made a small sound down the line. \u201cWhy? Dare I ask what your\ndates have been like?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026How\nabout I tell you later. We\u2019ll get together after this thing is over and drink\nabout it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\ndear, I would like nothing better.\u201d</p><p>There\nwas the sound of paper crinkling. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get this damn quiz done.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\ngrimaced. \u201cYes, me too. Suppose we\u2019d ought to get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe<i>ah</i>.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere both silent for a long moment. Neither wanted to hang up.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\nThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\nYou are very welcome. You know you can call me any time. After all, it\u2019s not\nlike I\u2019ll be sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCrowley laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great things about you. You\u2019re dependable.\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nfelt much better once he got off the phone with Aziraphale. He usually did. <br></p><p>\u201cAlright\nAdam,\u201d he said, glaring down at the quiz. \u201cI see how it is.\u201d</p><p>It\ndemanded honesty, but you also had to spell everything out for the damn thing. He\u2019d\nhave to think of it like some bloody-minded contract. </p><p>\u201cCompassionate,\nyes,\u201d said Crowley, bouncing his pen on his leg. \u201cBut they have to be\nopen-minded. Someone who will look past appearances and at least <i>try</i> to get to know me\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nsophisticated\u201d, decided Aziraphale, filling out his quiz. \u201cCharming.\u201d The angel\ndrummed his fingers against his desk. <br></p><p>\u201cAnd an excellent conversationalist\u2026\u201d</p>",

They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>Aziraphale\nstood in the park*, waiting for his date to turn up. He had been matched with a\ndemon this time. It cheered him. This was concerning on one level, but\nconsidering the person he got on with best was in fact, a demon, Aziraphale had\nchosen to take it as a good sign.</p><p>*Not\nSt. James. He didn\u2019t quite know <i>why</i>,\nbut to go there with someone other than Crowley just seemed\u2026wrong, somehow.</p><p>After\nall, angels had a habit of being rather stuffy and self-important. Aziraphale\nwould know, being somewhat inclined that way himself, but he knew deep down he\ncould never <i>ever</i> be anywhere near as\nbad as Gabriel. Something about Heaven brought it out in you. It was more than\nenough reason to avoid going Up There on it\u2019s own, not to mention all the other\nwonderful earthly delights it lacked. </p><p>Aziraphale\ndid not want that in a partner. He needed someone who could make light of\nthings, who wouldn\u2019t take everything so very seriously and so very heavily. <br></p><p>It\nwas something he had always admired about Crowley. Even when the poor dear was\nclearly anxious and suffering, Crowley still had that strange streak of\noptimism, a way of seeing the light in most situations. He never let\nAziraphale wallow for long. Crowley seemed to know exactly when Aziraphale needed to be left alone, and when to show up at the shop and demand to be let in, knowing he\nneeded the company.</p><p>\u00a0A\nloud honking cut through his thoughts. <br></p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t the low, nearly dignified sounds you hear on cars these days. Oh no.\nThis was a proper wheezing honk, the kind uttered by an old run down hulk that\ncrawled out of a junkyard, coughing smoke and spewing exhaust every which way\nlike the dying throes of some beast. </p><p>There\nwas a sinking sort of dread creeping on the angel as he looked and saw the\nsound was not, in fact, coming from a car, but from a rickety old unicycle. The\nfigure riding it was short, dressed in a battered top hat and a huge overcoat,\nand yes, a demon. <br></p><p>Oh\ndear.</p><p>The\ndemon hopped down from the unicycle and made his way over. </p><p>He\nstopped short at seeing Aziraphale, actually rocking back on the heels of\nhis overly large shoes. He pointed at the angel, threw his head back, and\nlaughed silently, his whole body shaking with it.</p><p>\u201cE-excuse\nme?\u201d bristled Aziraphale.\u201cJust what is so funny?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon waddled over to him and plucked at Aziraphale\u2019s coat, grinning. \u201cI <i>like</i> this coat*,\u201d said Aziraphale defensively. He\nswatted the demon\u2019s hand away from his bow-tie, \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with a\nbow-tie! You can hardly talk anyway.\u201d</p><p>*The\ncoat in question was perhaps a bit on the old side, but it had been through so\nmuch with the angel, and was so very comfortable that he hadn\u2019t the heart to\nget rid of it. It didn\u2019t show it\u2019s age so very much, really. It simply\u2026was a bit dated\nperhaps. </p><p>The\ndemon plopped himself down on a nearby bench, swinging his short legs happily\nand whistling. Aziraphale bit back a sigh and followed, making absolutely sure\nto check he wasn\u2019t about to sit on anything nefarious before sitting down.</p><p>\u201cYour\nname is Wasco, is that right?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon beamed at him, nodding enthusiastically. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nah\u2014\u201d he watched warily as Wasco pulled a long thin balloon out of his pocket.\nHe diligently bent it into the shape of a dog. \u201cEr. Well done,\u201d said\nAziraphale. Wasco handed the dog to him and rummaged though the huge pockets of\nhis coat. He produced a comically large pin. </p><p>Aziraphale only had time to think <i>oh no</i>,\nbefore\u2014 <br></p><p><i>POP</i></p><p>Little bits of colourful rubber landed around them. A baby in a pram\nnearby started to cry, startled by the noise. Wasco rocked back and forth in\nsilent laughter. </p><p>Well.\nHe had asked for someone with a sense of humor. Perhaps he should have been\nmore specific?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbrushed the bits of balloon off his coat. He thought better of it and miracled\nthem away, not wanting some poor animal to choke on it.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t talk much, do you?\u201d he tried.</p><p>There\nwas a negative honking sound from deep inside the overcoat.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\nHave you, er\u2026are you by any chance familiar with Punch and Judy? Eh\u2026Charlie\nChaplin? Harpo Marx?\u201d</p><p>Wasco\ngrabbed his hand and shook it wildly.</p><p>\u201cI-I\nthought so.\u201d He yelped as a shock ran through him. The demon\u2019s hand detached\nentirely. Wasco laughed, kicking his short legs. Aziraphale sighed. \u201cVery\nfunny.\u201d He gave the hand back. Wasco promptly jumped up on the bench and hurled\nthe fake hand into the pond, scattering the few ducks still out in the cold.</p><p>Hastily,\nAziraphale miracled the electricity out of the toy before it could do any\ndamage. Wasco frowned at him. \u201cThe ducks wouldn\u2019t have liked that,\u201d defended\nAziraphale. Wasco stuck his tongue out.</p><p>\u201cYou\nhaven\u2019t been up here recently, have you?\u201d <br></p><p>Wasco\nshook his head. He pointed at the ducks and grinned. They were funny\nlooking creatures. Aziraphale had always liked that about ducks, the way they\nwaddled and quacked and somehow managed to be quite fearsome when the mood\nstruck. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nlike it up here though, don\u2019t you?\u201d Wasco nodded happily and sat back down.\n\u201cWhen were you last on earth?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon paused. He sat back on the bench, crossing one arm over his chest and\ncupping his chin in an exaggerated thinking gesture. Then he straightened, and\nturned to Aziraphale.</p><p>Wasco\nheld up a finger and traced it down through the air in an arc, whistling as it\nwent. When it hit the bench he spread his hands apart, mimicking an explosion.</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh I see.\u201d Likely one of the great wars. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon dug through his pockets and produced a glaringly coloured, polka dotted\nhandkerchief. There was a loud honking sound as he blew his nose obnoxiously.\nHe courteously offered it to the angel.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nno. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Wasco\nshrugged and tossed it over the back of the bench.</p><p>They\nsat in silence for a long minute, Aziraphale struggling to think of something\nto say and Wasco cheerfully rummaging through his huge pockets, ominous\nclanking sounds coming from their depths.</p><p>At\nleast it was a nice day. It was sunny for winter, and warm enough to make an\nouting pleasant. </p><p>Wasco\nturned in his seat, staring over the back of the bench at the busy intersection\nbehind them. Then he raised his finger. He pulled a stick of dynamite out of\nhis coat. The tip began to fizzle.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nheart skipped a beat as he realized that <i>yes</i>,\nthat was real dynamite, and yes, Wasco drawing his arm back to throw it at the\nintersection.</p><p>He\nonly had a second to act.</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d said Aziraphale. </p><p>The\ndynamite disappeared. Wasco turned to him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThat\nis <i>not </i>funny, Wasco,\u201d he started lowly, adrenaline turning his voice sharp.\n\u201cThat could have seriously hurt someone! You could have <i>killed</i> all of those people! Is that what you wanted?\u201d The edge of divine wrath had seeped into his voice, making his eyes glow faintly. \u201c I <i>won\u2019t</i> have it. It\u2019s not funny\nif\u2026oh.\u201d </p><p>Wasco\nwas shrinking back from him, visibly frightened. <br></p><p>Aziraphale deflated. He hadn\u2019t\nmeant to scare the demon that badly. But he couldn\u2019t go around killing people.\nAnd certainly not in Aziraphale\u2019s city. </p><p>The\nangel pursed his lips. Wasco really was only a small little thing. He couldn\u2019t\nhave been much more than an imp. And it was clear he wasn\u2019t intending to be\nmalicious, just\u2026mischievous. </p><p>\u201cHumans\nare fragile,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey won\u2019t bounce back from something like\nthat.\u201d</p><p>Wasco was still terrified. Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>\u201cOh\ndear. I\u2019m sorry for scaring you.\u201d And then he was suddenly struck with inspiration. \u201cOh? Now, what\u2019s this? There\u2019s something behind your ear\u2026\u201d</p><p>The angel produced a large daisy. Wasco stared at it with huge eyes. Then he broke into a\ndelighted grin.</p><p><i>I knew it would come in handy</i>, thought Aziraphale\nto himself proudly.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>This\ntime, Crowley was paired with an angel. He was feeling tentatively optimistic\nabout it. Aziraphale was an angel, for one, and Crowley considered himself <i>the</i> Aziraphale expert. He was certain he\ncould handle what ever this angel had to throw at him. He couldn\u2019t be much\nworse than Aziraphale on a bad day, could he?</p><p>Crowley\narrived in the courtyard they had agreed to meet at, fifteen minutes early. His\ndate was already there.</p><p>Hasdiel,\nthe angel, was sitting cross-legged on the steps in front of a winged statue,\nhands clasped in prayer, eyes closed. Tears streaked down his face. <br></p><p>Crowley\nslowed, taking in the angels\u2019 pristine white robes and faint shimmery aura that\nwas just visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Well\nbugger. This one didn\u2019t spend much time on earth, Crowley would bet his custom-made watch on that. </p><p>Still.\nIt could go all right.<br></p><p>Hasdiel\nopened his eyes. \u201cDemon,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI have prayed unto our Heavenly Father for deliverance from your\nwiles. I shall not be tempted in your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\nHi. Nice one.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nrose to his feet in a graceful shimmery movement. He blinked slowly at Crowley,\nmore tears running down his face. <br></p><p>\u201cUm.\nAre you\u2014\u201d Crowley gestured at his face, \u201c\u2014all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nfeel the suffering of all beings,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cTheir earthly pain expresses\nitself through me. To pray for their souls is my calling.\u201d </p><p><i>Very funny Adam, very funny</i>, thought Crowley wildly. <i>This is what I get for asking for\ncompassion, is it?</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026you\ndon\u2019t get out much?\u201d he tried.<br></p><p>Hasdiel\nblinked at him.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nlet\u2019s start over? I\u2019m Crowley.\u201d He held out his hand. Hasdiel stared at it.\nCrowley took it back awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s Ok. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare the serpent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d Crowley awkwardly stuck his hands in his pockets. He took\nthem back out again, and wondered what he was supposed to do with them.</p><p>Hasdiel\nwatched him warily, tears still dripping down his face.</p><p>\u201cLook.\nI promise not to hurt you, all right? It\u2019s not my style anyway*. I won\u2019t tempt\nyou. I don\u2019t think Adam would be happy about any of that. It\u2019s not, y\u2019know, the\npoint of this whole\u2014\u201d he waved a hand. \u201cThing. Dating thing, y\u2019know? So don\u2019t\nworry about it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>*Crowley\nhad never physically harmed Aziraphale. The thought actually sickened him. It\nhad been hard enough actively working against him. Not because the angel was\ntoo cunning, Crowley simply\u2026hated seeing Aziraphale upset. Luckily\nAziraphale had been of a similar mind, and even if their formal Arrangement was\nrelatively new, they\u2019d come to an unspoken agreement early on not to doing\nanything intentionally harmful to the other.</p><p>Hasdiel\nsaid: \u201cYou are not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed awkwardly. \u201cWell. I\u2019ve been up here about six thousand years. They\u2019ll\nrub off on you, humans.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere still standing at this point, which Crowley thought was a bit ridiculous.\nHe sat down on the step beside the angel slowly, trying not to startle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\nHasdiel was watching him, curiosity plain on his face. \u201cYou <i>like</i> humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yeah.\u201d\nCrowley shrugged, looking away. \u201cYeah, I do. They\u2019re interesting. You never\nknow what they\u2019ll come up with next.\u201d <br></p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him like he\u2019d just sprouted another head. Crowley nearly checked just\nto make sure he hadn\u2019t*.</p><p>*Normally\nhe had a very good control of his body, but everyone once in a while there were\nlittle slip-ups. Aziraphale got them too, little slips of the subconscious,\nphysically manifesting in sometimes rather alarming ways. It was bloody\nannoying. <br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\n<i>do</i> feel compassion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\u201d\nCrowley ran a hand through his hair, a blush starting up his cheeks. \u201cMmh. Yea.\nDon\u2019t, um. Spread it around? M\u2019 demon, see? It\u2019s bad for my reputation.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nwas still staring at him as if he\u2019d had some major life-altering epiphany.\nCrowley was all for epiphanies, he just preferred if they didn\u2019t happen to\nother people on his time.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nare you all right?\u201d he tried. \u201cDid you want to get something to eat? That\nusually cheers Aziraphale up.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\njolted, coming back to himself. \u201cAziraphale,\u201d he said, something hard coming\ninto his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nknow, Guardian of the Eastern Gate? He\u2019s a frien\u2014er. We run into each other\ndown here. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\nI do not, and I am glad for it. That angel will Fall very soon and join the\nrest of the filth where he belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d\nsaid Crowley. And then he realized Hasdiel wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cOh.\u201d His opinion of the angel dropped sharply. </p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\nHasdiel took Crowley\u2019s hand. Crowley nearly flinched back. Azriaphale\u2019s hands\nwere warm and wan, and whenever they had touched it filled Crowley with an\nincredible feeling of comfort, of safety.</p><p>Hasdiel\u2019s\nfingers were feather light and cool, and brought none of the comfort he had\ncome to associate with Aziraphale. </p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel levelly, hand tight around his own.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nwhat?\u201d Crowley silently cursed his mind for going right to the gutter.</p><p>\u201cWe\nmust pray for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNhk\u2026what?\nWait, <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\nsoul is not yet wholly corrupted,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cThere is still hope. You can\nstill be returned to the glory of Heaven and to our blessed Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa hold on!\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cSurely\nyou want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201c <br></p><p>Crowley\ndid lie awake some nights wondering and regretting\u2014but he didn\u2019t miss Heaven.\nFor all he hated Hell, Heaven wasn\u2019t that much better*. And if he did switch\nsides, what where the chances he\u2019d get posted on earth?</p><p>*Especially\nto hear Aziraphale talk about it. Oh they wouldn\u2019t torture you outright. No,\nthat was uncouth. But they had their ways of making you just as sorry as Hell could, Aziraphale had bitterly recounted, deep in his cups. It was a matter of aesthetics. At least Hell had\nthe decency to be upfront about it. </p><p>Earth\nwas where it was at. Earth was his home, it was his <i>side</i>, what he and Aziraphale had fought and nearly died for. Heaven\nand Hell could go bugger off. He wanted no part of their bloody pissing match.</p><p>Crowley\npulled his hand out of the angels\u2019 grip. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got it wrong. I don\u2019t\nwant to go to Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him in confusion. \u201cBut you are sullied as you are. Your soul is\nunclean and damned. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t need help. I\u2019m happy as I am, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\ncan you be, burdened by sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\njust am, Ok? It\u2019s different on earth. I can live by my own moral code,\nnot follow any one side blindly.\u201d Crowley was getting increasingly offended.</p><p>\u201cYou\nneed not be afraid,\u201d said Hasdiel, expression benevolent. \u201cIf you bare yourself\nbefore our Holy Father, you can still be saved. You <i>must</i> ask for absolution. He would want that, Crowley.\u2019 <br></p><p>\u201cWell\n<i>I</i> don\u2019t!\u201d snapped Crowley. \u201cIt\u2019s a Hell of a lot more\ncomplicated than all of that! You think just because you\u2019re an angel and you\nlive in Heaven you\u2019re pure as a daisy\u2014well that\u2019s not how it works! You make\nyour choices everyday with every action\u2014and if you think for one minute we\u2019re\nexempt from it\u2014 you\u2019re wrong! You have to think about what you <i>do</i>, not just do\nwhat you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>Crowley was reeling. Aziraphale had never made him feel as low as this angel had. Aziraphale <i>respected</i> him. He\u2019d never force Crowley to repent. <br></p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel, holding out his hand. Tears glistened on his face. \u201cBe clean\nagain. Leave this filth behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck</i> you!\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nstormed off from the weeping angel, feeling something treacherously like tears\nprickling at his own eyes. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>Sitting\nin his favourite armchair, Aziraphale stared into his mug of cocoa and wondered\nwhy people willingly subjected themselves to dating.</p><p>It\nwas\u2026true, that he\u2019d met some interesting people. Certainly. </p><p>Had\nhe enjoyed himself? No. Not at all.</p><p>He\nsighed. A sense of humor was important. But he\u2019d been hoping for something a\nbit more advanced than slapstick! That should have been a given. There needed\nto be some element of sophistication to it.</p><p>Wasco\nhadn\u2019t understood the difference between a harmless prank and a deadly attack.\nAziraphale needed someone who did. Someone with a strong sense of morality.\nLike Crowley. <br></p><p>That\nhalted his thoughts in their tracks.</p><p>Crowley\nknew right from wrong. He had <i>always</i>\nknown, Aziraphale realized. And what\u2019s more, he acted on it. Even when it put\nhim in a bad position, Crowley was rarely cruel. He was considerate. He\nbalanced everything excellently, doing his job and performing acts of low-grade\nevil while at the same time avoiding as much actual harm as he could.</p><p>And\nhe knew what lines shouldn\u2019t be crossed. Crowley had never burned a book. He\u2019d<i> stopped</i> book burnings, simply because\nhe knew Aziraphale would be upset by it.</p><p>A\nwarm feeling was building in his chest.</p><p>A\nlow ringing shook him from his thoughts. It was his mobile phone. </p><p>\u201cCrowley!\u201d\nhe said delightedly. \u201cMy dear boy, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\u201d\nIt was nearly a sigh. He sounded tired. The angel frowned. <br></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou all right? Is something the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026talk\nto me? Please?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, my dear,\u201d said Aziraphale softly, wondering just what had happened to\nput him in such a mood. \u201cWell\u2026how about I tell you something I\u2019ve discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\nWhat did you find?\u201d Crowley\u2019s voice was still exhausted, but there was a note\nof fondness in it now.</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>, my dear, are a shining beacon of\nmorality,\u201d said Aziraphale proudly.</p><p>There\nwas a strangled sound down the line.</p><p>\u201cNo\nno, it\u2019s true. And I won\u2019t be budged on it!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014I\nmust say, though I worry for your ego\u2014you are terribly sophisticated as well. I\nsee that now.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201c<i>Sophisticated</i>.\u201d Crowley gave a small\nlaugh. \u201cOoh. I like that. Yeah. I am sophisticated, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo-<i>someone</i>. What kind of dates have you\nbeen having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think this last one was much more than an imp. Jittery little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImps\nhave about two brain cells they have to share between the lot of them.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot very nice,\u201d chided Aziraphale. \u201cThough of course I can\u2019t say as much, but I\nthink you may be on to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a bit like dating Harpo Marx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n<i>no</i>. That bad?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAfraid\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor\nsomeone\u2019s sake.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen those films in ages.\u201d<br>\n Aziraphale made a noise in agreement.\n\u201cToo bad he wasn\u2019t more like Groucho. He was more your style, if I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nwhat can I say? I appreciate someone who can talk circles around everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough\nit was nice to have someone appreciate my magic tricks,\u201d mused Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cOh\nno. I\u2019ve not been neglecting you, have I? You haven\u2019t been carrying a pack of\ncards around all this time, heartbroken, just waiting for me to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>. I\u2019m simply glad I know the skill.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. It was such a nice sound. Aziraphale pressed his mobile closer to his\near. \u201cAre you feeling any better, my dear?\u201d </p><p>There\nwas a breathy sigh. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas my pleasure,\u201d said Aziraphale softly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nnot\u2014<i>thank</i> you. Aziraphale.\nFor\u2026respecting me. As I am. Not\u2014trying to make me something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t see what\u2019s not to like about you,\u201d said Aziraphale hotly, meaning every\nword. Crowley made a small sound down the line. \u201cWhy? Dare I ask what your\ndates have been like?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026How\nabout I tell you later. We\u2019ll get together after this thing is over and drink\nabout it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\ndear, I would like nothing better.\u201d</p><p>There\nwas the sound of paper crinkling. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get this damn quiz done.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\ngrimaced. \u201cYes, me too. Suppose we\u2019d ought to get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe<i>ah</i>.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere both silent for a long moment. Neither wanted to hang up.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\nThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\nYou are very welcome. You know you can call me any time. After all, it\u2019s not\nlike I\u2019ll be sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCrowley laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great things about you.

                "content": "<p>Chapter: 2/5</p><p>Words: 3418</p><p>Relationships: Aziraphale/Crowley</p><p>Adam reasons that if Heaven and Hell just got to know each other a bit \nbetter, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so keen to start another Apocalypse. They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well&hellip;</p><p>Aziraphale\nstood in the park*, waiting for his date to turn up. He had been matched with a\ndemon this time. It cheered him. This was concerning on one level, but\nconsidering the person he got on with best was in fact, a demon, Aziraphale had\nchosen to take it as a good sign.</p><p>*Not\nSt. James. He didn&rsquo;t quite know <i>why</i>,\nbut to go there with someone other than Crowley just seemed&hellip;wrong, somehow.</p><p>After\nall, angels had a habit of being rather stuffy and self-important. Aziraphale\nwould know, being somewhat inclined that way himself, but he knew deep down he\ncould never <i>ever</i> be anywhere near as\nbad as Gabriel. Something about Heaven brought it out in you. It was more than\nenough reason to avoid going Up There on it&rsquo;s own, not to mention all the other\nwonderful earthly delights it lacked. </p><p>Aziraphale\ndid not want that in a partner. He needed someone who could make light of\nthings, who wouldn&rsquo;t take everything so very seriously and so very heavily. <br /></p><p>It\nwas something he had always admired about Crowley. Even when the poor dear was\nclearly anxious and suffering, Crowley still had that strange streak of\noptimism, a way of seeing the light in most situations. He never let\nAziraphale wallow for long. Crowley seemed to know exactly when Aziraphale needed to be left alone, and when to show up at the shop and demand to be let in, knowing he\nneeded the company.</p><p>&nbsp;A\nloud honking cut through his thoughts. <br /></p><p>It\nwasn&rsquo;t the low, nearly dignified sounds you hear on cars these days. Oh no.\nThis was a proper wheezing honk, the kind uttered by an old run down hulk that\ncrawled out of a junkyard, coughing smoke and spewing exhaust every which way\nlike the dying throes of some beast. </p><p>There\nwas a sinking sort of dread creeping on the angel as he looked and saw the\nsound was not, in fact, coming from a car, but from a rickety old unicycle. The\nfigure riding it was short, dressed in a battered top hat and a huge overcoat,\nand yes, a demon. <br /></p><p>Oh\ndear.</p><p>The\ndemon hopped down from the unicycle and made his way over. </p><p>He\nstopped short at seeing Aziraphale, actually rocking back on the heels of\nhis overly large shoes. He pointed at the angel, threw his head back, and\nlaughed silently, his whole body shaking with it.</p><p>&ldquo;E-excuse\nme?&rdquo; bristled Aziraphale.&ldquo;Just what is so funny?&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndemon waddled over to him and plucked at Aziraphale&rsquo;s coat, grinning. &ldquo;I <i>like</i> this coat*,&rdquo; said Aziraphale defensively. He\nswatted the demon&rsquo;s hand away from his bow-tie, &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a\nbow-tie! You can hardly talk anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>*The\ncoat in question was perhaps a bit on the old side, but it had been through so\nmuch with the angel, and was so very comfortable that he hadn&rsquo;t the heart to\nget rid of it. It didn&rsquo;t show it&rsquo;s age so very much, really. It simply&hellip;was a bit dated\nperhaps. </p><p>The\ndemon plopped himself down on a nearby bench, swinging his short legs happily\nand whistling. Aziraphale bit back a sigh and followed, making absolutely sure\nto check he wasn&rsquo;t about to sit on anything nefarious before sitting down.</p><p>&ldquo;Your\nname is Wasco, is that right?&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndemon beamed at him, nodding enthusiastically. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nah&mdash;&rdquo; he watched warily as Wasco pulled a long thin balloon out of his pocket.\nHe diligently bent it into the shape of a dog. &ldquo;Er. Well done,&rdquo; said\nAziraphale. Wasco handed the dog to him and rummaged though the huge pockets of\nhis coat. He produced a comically large pin. </p><p>Aziraphale only had time to think <i>oh no</i>,\nbefore&mdash; <br /></p><p><i>POP</i></p><p>Little bits of colourful rubber landed around them. A baby in a pram\nnearby started to cry, startled by the noise. Wasco rocked back and forth in\nsilent laughter. </p><p>Well.\nHe had asked for someone with a sense of humor. Perhaps he should have been\nmore specific?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbrushed the bits of balloon off his coat. He thought better of it and miracled\nthem away, not wanting some poor animal to choke on it.</p><p>&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t talk much, do you?&rdquo; he tried.</p><p>There\nwas a negative honking sound from deep inside the overcoat.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm.\nHave you, er&hellip;are you by any chance familiar with Punch and Judy? Eh&hellip;Charlie\nChaplin? Harpo Marx?&rdquo;</p><p>Wasco\ngrabbed his hand and shook it wildly.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I\nthought so.&rdquo; He yelped as a shock ran through him. The demon&rsquo;s hand detached\nentirely. Wasco laughed, kicking his short legs. Aziraphale sighed. &ldquo;Very\nfunny.&rdquo; He gave the hand back. Wasco promptly jumped up on the bench and hurled\nthe fake hand into the pond, scattering the few ducks still out in the cold.</p><p>Hastily,\nAziraphale miracled the electricity out of the toy before it could do any\ndamage. Wasco frowned at him. &ldquo;The ducks wouldn&rsquo;t have liked that,&rdquo; defended\nAziraphale. Wasco stuck his tongue out.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nhaven&rsquo;t been up here recently, have you?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Wasco\nshook his head. He pointed at the ducks and grinned. They were funny\nlooking creatures. Aziraphale had always liked that about ducks, the way they\nwaddled and quacked and somehow managed to be quite fearsome when the mood\nstruck. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nlike it up here though, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Wasco nodded happily and sat back down.\n&ldquo;When were you last on earth?&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndemon paused. He sat back on the bench, crossing one arm over his chest and\ncupping his chin in an exaggerated thinking gesture. Then he straightened, and\nturned to Aziraphale.</p><p>Wasco\nheld up a finger and traced it down through the air in an arc, whistling as it\nwent. When it hit the bench he spread his hands apart, mimicking an explosion.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.\nOh I see.&rdquo; Likely one of the great wars. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndemon dug through his pockets and produced a glaringly coloured, polka dotted\nhandkerchief. There was a loud honking sound as he blew his nose obnoxiously.\nHe courteously offered it to the angel.</p><p>&ldquo;Er,\nno. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Wasco\nshrugged and tossed it over the back of the bench.</p><p>They\nsat in silence for a long minute, Aziraphale struggling to think of something\nto say and Wasco cheerfully rummaging through his huge pockets, ominous\nclanking sounds coming from their depths.</p><p>At\nleast it was a nice day. It was sunny for winter, and warm enough to make an\nouting pleasant. </p><p>Wasco\nturned in his seat, staring over the back of the bench at the busy intersection\nbehind them. Then he raised his finger. He pulled a stick of dynamite out of\nhis coat. The tip began to fizzle.</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nheart skipped a beat as he realized that <i>yes</i>,\nthat was real dynamite, and yes, Wasco drawing his arm back to throw it at the\nintersection.</p><p>He\nonly had a second to act.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>,&rdquo; said Aziraphale. </p><p>The\ndynamite disappeared. Wasco turned to him in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;That\nis <i>not </i>funny, Wasco,&rdquo; he started lowly, adrenaline turning his voice sharp.\n&ldquo;That could have seriously hurt someone! You could have <i>killed</i> all of those people! Is that what you wanted?&rdquo; The edge of divine wrath had seeped into his voice, making his eyes glow faintly. &ldquo; I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> have it. It&rsquo;s not funny\nif&hellip;oh.&rdquo; </p><p>Wasco\nwas shrinking back from him, visibly frightened. <br /></p><p>Aziraphale deflated. He hadn&rsquo;t\nmeant to scare the demon that badly. But he couldn&rsquo;t go around killing people.\nAnd certainly not in Aziraphale&rsquo;s city. </p><p>The\nangel pursed his lips. Wasco really was only a small little thing. He couldn&rsquo;t\nhave been much more than an imp. And it was clear he wasn&rsquo;t intending to be\nmalicious, just&hellip;mischievous. </p><p>&ldquo;Humans\nare fragile,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t bounce back from something like\nthat.&rdquo;</p><p>Wasco was still terrified. Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\ndear. I&rsquo;m sorry for scaring you.&rdquo; And then he was suddenly struck with inspiration. &ldquo;Oh? Now, what&rsquo;s this? There&rsquo;s something behind your ear&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The angel produced a large daisy. Wasco stared at it with huge eyes. Then he broke into a\ndelighted grin.</p><p><i>I knew it would come in handy</i>, thought Aziraphale\nto himself proudly.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>This\ntime, Crowley was paired with an angel. He was feeling tentatively optimistic\nabout it. Aziraphale was an angel, for one, and Crowley considered himself <i>the</i> Aziraphale expert. He was certain he\ncould handle what ever this angel had to throw at him. He couldn&rsquo;t be much\nworse than Aziraphale on a bad day, could he?</p><p>Crowley\narrived in the courtyard they had agreed to meet at, fifteen minutes early. His\ndate was already there.</p><p>Hasdiel,\nthe angel, was sitting cross-legged on the steps in front of a winged statue,\nhands clasped in prayer, eyes closed. Tears streaked down his face. <br /></p><p>Crowley\nslowed, taking in the angels&rsquo; pristine white robes and faint shimmery aura that\nwas just visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Well\nbugger. This one didn&rsquo;t spend much time on earth, Crowley would bet his custom-made watch on that. </p><p>Still.\nIt could go all right.<br /></p><p>Hasdiel\nopened his eyes. &ldquo;Demon,&rdquo;\nhe said. &ldquo;I have prayed unto our Heavenly Father for deliverance from your\nwiles. I shall not be tempted in your presence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er,\nHi. Nice one.&rdquo;</p><p>Hasdiel\nrose to his feet in a graceful shimmery movement. He blinked slowly at Crowley,\nmore tears running down his face. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Um.\nAre you&mdash;&rdquo; Crowley gestured at his face, &ldquo;&mdash;all right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nfeel the suffering of all beings,&rdquo; said Hasdiel. &ldquo;Their earthly pain expresses\nitself through me. To pray for their souls is my calling.&rdquo; </p><p><i>Very funny Adam, very funny</i>, thought Crowley wildly. <i>This is what I get for asking for\ncompassion, is it?</i></p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;you\ndon&rsquo;t get out much?&rdquo; he tried.<br /></p><p>Hasdiel\nblinked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Look,\nlet&rsquo;s start over? I&rsquo;m Crowley.&rdquo; He held out his hand. Hasdiel stared at it.\nCrowley took it back awkwardly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ok. You don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nare the serpent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.\nYeah, that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; Crowley awkwardly stuck his hands in his pockets. He took\nthem back out again, and wondered what he was supposed to do with them.</p><p>Hasdiel\nwatched him warily, tears still dripping down his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Look.\nI promise not to hurt you, all right? It&rsquo;s not my style anyway*. I won&rsquo;t tempt\nyou. I don&rsquo;t think Adam would be happy about any of that. It&rsquo;s not, y&rsquo;know, the\npoint of this whole&mdash;&rdquo; he waved a hand. &ldquo;Thing. Dating thing, y&rsquo;know? So don&rsquo;t\nworry about it, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>*Crowley\nhad never physically harmed Aziraphale. The thought actually sickened him. It\nhad been hard enough actively working against him. Not because the angel was\ntoo cunning, Crowley simply&hellip;hated seeing Aziraphale upset. Luckily\nAziraphale had been of a similar mind, and even if their formal Arrangement was\nrelatively new, they&rsquo;d come to an unspoken agreement early on not to doing\nanything intentionally harmful to the other.</p><p>Hasdiel\nsaid: &ldquo;You are not what I expected.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed awkwardly. &ldquo;Well. I&rsquo;ve been up here about six thousand years. They&rsquo;ll\nrub off on you, humans.&rdquo;</p><p>They\nwere still standing at this point, which Crowley thought was a bit ridiculous.\nHe sat down on the step beside the angel slowly, trying not to startle him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;\nHasdiel was watching him, curiosity plain on his face. &ldquo;You <i>like</i> humans?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah.&rdquo;\nCrowley shrugged, looking away. &ldquo;Yeah, I do. They&rsquo;re interesting. You never\nknow what they&rsquo;ll come up with next.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him like he&rsquo;d just sprouted another head. Crowley nearly checked just\nto make sure he hadn&rsquo;t*.</p><p>*Normally\nhe had a very good control of his body, but everyone once in a while there were\nlittle slip-ups. Aziraphale got them too, little slips of the subconscious,\nphysically manifesting in sometimes rather alarming ways. It was bloody\nannoying. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\n<i>do</i> feel compassion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er.&rdquo;\nCrowley ran a hand through his hair, a blush starting up his cheeks. &ldquo;Mmh. Yea.\nDon&rsquo;t, um. Spread it around? M&rsquo; demon, see? It&rsquo;s bad for my reputation.&rdquo;</p><p>Hasdiel\nwas still staring at him as if he&rsquo;d had some major life-altering epiphany.\nCrowley was all for epiphanies, he just preferred if they didn&rsquo;t happen to\nother people on his time.</p><p>&ldquo;Look,\nare you all right?&rdquo; he tried. &ldquo;Did you want to get something to eat? That\nusually cheers Aziraphale up.&rdquo;</p><p>Hasdiel\njolted, coming back to himself. &ldquo;Aziraphale,&rdquo; he said, something hard coming\ninto his eyes. </p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You\nknow, Guardian of the Eastern Gate? He&rsquo;s a frien&mdash;er. We run into each other\ndown here. Do you know him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.\nI do not, and I am glad for it. That angel will Fall very soon and join the\nrest of the filth where he belongs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hah,&rdquo;\nsaid Crowley. And then he realized Hasdiel wasn&rsquo;t joking. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; His opinion of the angel dropped sharply. </p><p>&ldquo;Crowley.&rdquo;\nHasdiel took Crowley&rsquo;s hand. Crowley nearly flinched back. Azriaphale&rsquo;s hands\nwere warm and wan, and whenever they had touched it filled Crowley with an\nincredible feeling of comfort, of safety.</p><p>Hasdiel&rsquo;s\nfingers were feather light and cool, and brought none of the comfort he had\ncome to associate with Aziraphale. </p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;\nsaid Hasdiel levelly, hand tight around his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Er,\nwhat?&rdquo; Crowley silently cursed his mind for going right to the gutter.</p><p>&ldquo;We\nmust pray for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nhk&hellip;what?\nWait, <i>what?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your\nsoul is not yet wholly corrupted,&rdquo; said Hasdiel. &ldquo;There is still hope. You can\nstill be returned to the glory of Heaven and to our blessed Father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa,\nwhoa hold on!&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Surely\nyou want this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&ldquo; <br /></p><p>Crowley\ndid lie awake some nights wondering and regretting&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t miss Heaven.\nFor all he hated Hell, Heaven wasn&rsquo;t that much better*. And if he did switch\nsides, what where the chances he&rsquo;d get posted on earth?</p><p>*Especially\nto hear Aziraphale talk about it. Oh they wouldn&rsquo;t torture you outright. No,\nthat was uncouth. But they had their ways of making you just as sorry as Hell could, Aziraphale had bitterly recounted, deep in his cups. It was a matter of aesthetics. At least Hell had\nthe decency to be upfront about it. </p><p>Earth\nwas where it was at. Earth was his home, it was his <i>side</i>, what he and Aziraphale had fought and nearly died for. Heaven\nand Hell could go bugger off. He wanted no part of their bloody pissing match.</p><p>Crowley\npulled his hand out of the angels&rsquo; grip. &ldquo;Look, you&rsquo;ve got it wrong. I don&rsquo;t\nwant to go to Heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him in confusion. &ldquo;But you are sullied as you are. Your soul is\nunclean and damned. I can help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t need help. I&rsquo;m happy as I am, all right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How\ncan you be, burdened by sin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\njust am, Ok? It&rsquo;s different on earth. I can live by my own moral code,\nnot follow any one side blindly.&rdquo; Crowley was getting increasingly offended.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nneed not be afraid,&rdquo; said Hasdiel, expression benevolent. &ldquo;If you bare yourself\nbefore our Holy Father, you can still be saved. You <i>must</i> ask for absolution. He would want that, Crowley.&rsquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well\n<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; snapped Crowley. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Hell of a lot more\ncomplicated than all of that! You think just because you&rsquo;re an angel and you\nlive in Heaven you&rsquo;re pure as a daisy&mdash;well that&rsquo;s not how it works! You make\nyour choices everyday with every action&mdash;and if you think for one minute we&rsquo;re\nexempt from it&mdash; you&rsquo;re wrong! You have to think about what you <i>do</i>, not just do\nwhat you&rsquo;re told.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley was reeling. Aziraphale had never made him feel as low as this angel had. Aziraphale <i>respected</i> him. He&rsquo;d never force Crowley to repent. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;\nsaid Hasdiel, holding out his hand. Tears glistened on his face. &ldquo;Be clean\nagain. Leave this filth behind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Fuck</i> you!&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nstormed off from the weeping angel, feeling something treacherously like tears\nprickling at his own eyes. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>Sitting\nin his favourite armchair, Aziraphale stared into his mug of cocoa and wondered\nwhy people willingly subjected themselves to dating.</p><p>It\nwas&hellip;true, that he&rsquo;d met some interesting people. Certainly. </p><p>Had\nhe enjoyed himself? No. Not at all.</p><p>He\nsighed. A sense of humor was important. But he&rsquo;d been hoping for something a\nbit more advanced than slapstick! That should have been a given. There needed\nto be some element of sophistication to it.</p><p>Wasco\nhadn&rsquo;t understood the difference between a harmless prank and a deadly attack.\nAziraphale needed someone who did. Someone with a strong sense of morality.\nLike Crowley. <br /></p><p>That\nhalted his thoughts in their tracks.</p><p>Crowley\nknew right from wrong. He had <i>always</i>\nknown, Aziraphale realized. And what&rsquo;s more, he acted on it. Even when it put\nhim in a bad position, Crowley was rarely cruel. He was considerate. He\nbalanced everything excellently, doing his job and performing acts of low-grade\nevil while at the same time avoiding as much actual harm as he could.</p><p>And\nhe knew what lines shouldn&rsquo;t be crossed. Crowley had never burned a book. He&rsquo;d<i> stopped</i> book burnings, simply because\nhe knew Aziraphale would be upset by it.</p><p>A\nwarm feeling was building in his chest.</p><p>A\nlow ringing shook him from his thoughts. It was his mobile phone. </p><p>&ldquo;Crowley!&rdquo;\nhe said delightedly. &ldquo;My dear boy, how are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale.&rdquo;\nIt was nearly a sigh. He sounded tired. The angel frowned. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are\nyou all right? Is something the matter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip;talk\nto me? Please?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse, my dear,&rdquo; said Aziraphale softly, wondering just what had happened to\nput him in such a mood. &ldquo;Well&hellip;how about I tell you something I&rsquo;ve discovered?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.\nWhat did you find?&rdquo; Crowley&rsquo;s voice was still exhausted, but there was a note\nof fondness in it now.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>, my dear, are a shining beacon of\nmorality,&rdquo; said Aziraphale proudly.</p><p>There\nwas a strangled sound down the line.</p><p>&ldquo;No\nno, it&rsquo;s true. And I won&rsquo;t be budged on it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Angel</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And&mdash;I\nmust say, though I worry for your ego&mdash;you are terribly sophisticated as well. I\nsee that now.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Sophisticated</i>.&rdquo; Crowley gave a small\nlaugh. &ldquo;Ooh. I like that. Yeah. I am sophisticated, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly\nso.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go-<i>someone</i>. What kind of dates have you\nbeen having?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t think this last one was much more than an imp. Jittery little thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Imps\nhave about two brain cells they have to share between the lot of them.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nnot very nice,&rdquo; chided Aziraphale. &ldquo;Though of course I can&rsquo;t say as much, but I\nthink you may be on to something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas a bit like dating Harpo Marx.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\n<i>no</i>. That bad?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Afraid\nso.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For\nsomeone&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen those films in ages.&rdquo;<br />\n Aziraphale made a noise in agreement.\n&ldquo;Too bad he wasn&rsquo;t more like Groucho. He was more your style, if I remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nwhat can I say? I appreciate someone who can talk circles around everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Though\nit was nice to have someone appreciate my magic tricks,&rdquo; mused Aziraphale.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nno. I&rsquo;ve not been neglecting you, have I? You haven&rsquo;t been carrying a pack of\ncards around all this time, heartbroken, just waiting for me to ask?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>. I&rsquo;m simply glad I know the skill.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. It was such a nice sound. Aziraphale pressed his mobile closer to his\near. &ldquo;Are you feeling any better, my dear?&rdquo; </p><p>There\nwas a breathy sigh. &ldquo;Yeah. Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas my pleasure,&rdquo; said Aziraphale softly.</p><p>&ldquo;No,\nnot&mdash;<i>thank</i> you. Aziraphale.\nFor&hellip;respecting me. As I am. Not&mdash;trying to make me something else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s not to like about you,&rdquo; said Aziraphale hotly, meaning every\nword. Crowley made a small sound down the line. &ldquo;Why? Dare I ask what your\ndates have been like?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;How\nabout I tell you later. We&rsquo;ll get together after this thing is over and drink\nabout it, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My\ndear, I would like nothing better.&rdquo;</p><p>There\nwas the sound of paper crinkling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get this damn quiz done.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\ngrimaced. &ldquo;Yes, me too. Suppose we&rsquo;d ought to get to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ye<i>ah</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>They\nwere both silent for a long moment. Neither wanted to hang up.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel.\nThank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley.\nYou are very welcome. You know you can call me any time. After all, it&rsquo;s not\nlike I&rsquo;ll be sleeping.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nCrowley laughed again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the great things about you. You&rsquo;re dependable.&rdquo;</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nfelt much better once he got off the phone with Aziraphale. He usually did. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright\nAdam,&rdquo; he said, glaring down at the quiz. &ldquo;I see how it is.&rdquo;</p><p>It\ndemanded honesty, but you also had to spell everything out for the damn thing. He&rsquo;d\nhave to think of it like some bloody-minded contract. </p><p>&ldquo;Compassionate,\nyes,&rdquo; said Crowley, bouncing his pen on his leg. &ldquo;But they have to be\nopen-minded. Someone who will look past appearances and at least <i>try</i> to get to know me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;Someone\nsophisticated&rdquo;, decided Aziraphale, filling out his quiz. &ldquo;Charming.&rdquo; The angel\ndrummed his fingers against his desk. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;And an excellent conversationalist&hellip;&rdquo;</p>",
