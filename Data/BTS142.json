Upon your return you felt a chill go down your spine, a sneeze shook your body.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cHurry my darling, we must get you warmed up,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Jimin ensured that you were in the bath and warm before himself. He went to the Roman baths on the ground level of the castle. </p><p>As you soaked in the warm, soapy water, your mind was plagued with the thoughts of your husband&rsquo;s body atop yours. You bit your lip as you thought of Jimin between your legs, the mere thought sent a rush of heat to your core&hellip;</p><p>Jimin was in a similar situation down in the baths.</p><p>However he was much less refrained. Taking his cock in his hand he quickly stroked himself, chasing after his high like a man possessed. </p><p>\u201cFuck, fuck&hellip;\u201d</p><p>He breathed into the humid air of the large space.</p><p>Adding pressure to his swollen balls sent him spiraling into a thrusting mess.</p><p>\u201cY/N, Y/N,\u201d he whined into the air. Jimin could feel himself getting closer as he thought of your damp body underneath his on the shore. How exquisite you looked to him.</p><p>He came with the thought of your open mouth waiting for his release. Shuddering against the walls of the bath Jimin tried to even out his breathing.</p><p>Each day was turning into torture for him. He just wanted to get closer to you. Perhaps finally get to experience you and your body&hellip;</p><p>But he had to yield. Now wasn\u2019t the time, there were much more daunting tasks once you returned to the palace&hellip;</p><p>A coronation. A witch to murder.</p><p>Was there time for the two of you to be intimate in any way? Did Jimin dare get closer, because in the end he might have to deliver the final blow&hellip;</p><p>A knock came on the door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Jimin asked, rubbing his body with soap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me Highness,\u201d Jungkook&rsquo;s voice announced through the door.</p><p>\u201cEnter,\u201d Jimin approved.</p><p>Jungkook entered wearing his civilian clothing, with his cutlass and accessories around his hip. Jimin raised an eyebrow and sat down in the water that was steaming.</p><p>It was beautiful due to the hot springs underneath the palace. Jimin had forgotten how much he loved it here.</p><p>\u201cHighness, we are to depart shortly after sunrise. The servants already loaded a majority of your luggage in the carriages. Taehyung sent word there was no disturbances in your absence,\u201d Jungkook reported.</p><p>\u201cVery good, what of the Royal Palace? Any news from my mother and my father\u2019s condition?\u201d Jimin asked.</p><p>\u201cYour Father is stable, however weak. Your mother states he is determined to meet his grandchild,\u201d Jungkook whispered.</p><p>Jimin froze. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to wait&hellip; so will I,\u201d Jimin rubbed his face.</p><p>\u201cSire, may we speak as friends. As Jungkook and Jimin instead of Prince and Knight?\u201d Jungkook asked, coming over and sitting next to Jimin. The Prince nodded, leaning his head against the chilled marble.</p><p>\u201cGo on Kook,\u201d Jimin breathed. Jungkook looked at his friend then down at his hands set in his lap.</p><p>\u201cJimin-Hyung, you\u2019ve done so much for me in this life I am certain I won\u2019t be able to repay in within the four I\u2019m granted. But, I do promise that I will fight for you for as long as I can, as hard as I can, as efficiently as I can&hellip; Every knight\u2019s dream is not to go into battle, it is to wake up on a day where he is not needed. Because then he has done his job well.\u201d</p><p>Jimin frowned then looked to his friend with brows furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m unsure of what all of this means, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin sighed, hunching forward with exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, hyung, that you have time to not be worried about certain things. You are allowed to enjoy yourself and enjoy your life. There is so much more out there than the troubling times ahead. Those moments are not here yet, so don\u2019t dwell when there is nothing to dwell upon. There are more important things,\u201d Jungkook touching Jimin\u2019s shoulder gently. \u201cMore important people, to create memories with at the moment,\u201d Jungkook reminded. </p><p>Jimin thought of you both out at the ocean. How he longed to stay out there with you just one moment longer. He would\u2019ve given anything to stay there with you in that moment. </p><p>\u201cI appreciate your words Jungkook, they come from your heart of pure gold I know. I will work hard to make memories worth looking back upon in the years to come,\u201d he assured. </p><p>Jungkook nodded his head and stood up. \u201cI am going to secure the perimeter sire, please rest well,\u201d Jungkook bowed before exiting the large room. Jimin felt a chill run down his spine as the cold air touched his back. </p><p>He did want to make memories with you, but only when you were ready&hellip;</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t sure he was ready himself&hellip;</p><p>There was only one way to find out&hellip;</p><p>* * *</p><p>You stood out on the balcony in your nightdress, feeling the breeze blow against your warmed skin. </p><p>Jimin had been in the baths for a while.</p><p>You blushed thinking back to your actions on the beach. How Jimin had himself situation between your legs. His body moving against yours with such sinful pleasure that it made your heart falter in your chest. </p><p>There were no doubts in your mind you were attracted to your husband. He was a fine man, from the Royal Lineage there was no questions of his beauty. However, he mentioned his preferences lied with men&hellip;?</p><p>Was this just him trying to create an heir within you?</p><p>Was it all just a ploy so he could do away with you once he had what he wanted?</p><p>No&hellip;</p><p>Jimin wasn\u2019t like that, and you knew better. Jimin had stated he wanted to try to be a couple. To rely on one another like couples were supposed to. And he couldn\u2019t do that if you weren\u2019t ready to carry your load along with his. </p><p>And thinking back to the beach&hellip; Where his strong body was laid out beneath you, completely subject to whatever your thoughts could imagine&hellip;</p><p>It was truly thrilling to think of it that way&hellip;</p><p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.</p><p>You turned and quickly gathered your dressing robe before answering the sound. \u201cYes, who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Y/N, are you decent?\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice came through the wood. </p><p>Relaxing you placed your dressing gown back on the chair. \u201cYes, you may enter.\u201d</p><p>Jimin walked in with his hair still damp from the baths. He looked refreshed, and much warmer than earlier when you\u2019d parted. </p><p>\u201cWere the baths pleasant?\u201d you asked, sitting down on the trunk at the foot of your bed. Jimin nodded and approached you slowly. </p><p>\u201cYes, they were. You\u2019ll have to experience them the next we visit. They are supposed to aid in fertility,\u201d Jimin stated before sitting next to you. </p><p>You felt your cheeks flush before clearing your throat. \u201cI see, then perhaps I should,\u201d you squeaked. </p><p>Jimin giggled and you turned your head quickly. You\u2019d certainly never heard that sound from him before. Because now that you had, you were certain you\u2019d never forget it. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning pink, darling,\u201d he pointed out. </p><p>You huffed and rubbed your cheeks before standing up. \u201cI-It was warm in the baths, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Hurrying out to the balcony you crossed your arms over your chest in frustration. Why did he insist on teasing you on such a delicate matter? Surely the thought terrified him too?</p><p>Or was he merely thinking of the means to procure a royal?</p><p>Footsteps followed your path outside and warm arms encaptured your form. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be cross, my dear, I\u2019m only jesting,\u201d Jimin whispered in your neck. You bit your lip and shuddered against his form. </p><p>\u201cA child is no joking matter,\u201d you reminded, firm. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, but watching you get flustered at the mention of one surely is means for a slight joke, is it not?\u201d Jimin tried again.</p><p>\u201cMocking my purity is not a joke either,\u201d you warned. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, supposing your purity is kept for much longer,\u201d Jimin breathed in your ear. The heat of his breath made your knees wobbly. \u201cI\u2019d never do anything you didn\u2019t want. But please know that I\u2019ll do whatever you ask of me.\u201d</p><p>Turning fast you wrapped your arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cThen kiss me, like you won\u2019t get to do it again,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>All thoughts of preventing an heir, the war you were in, the lives at stake flew from your head the moment Jimin pressed his lips against yours. You were lost to the ocean of his eyes and the solid Earth of his body. </p><p>You wanted more of him. More of his skin against yours and his lips in places you\u2019d be too ashamed to ask for. Oh Gods it was everything you could do to stay on your feet. And Jimin seemed to be thinking in a similar fashion. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making it difficult for me to think,\u201d he warned, pulling away from your lips. Chest heaving you gripped his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think, just feel,\u201d you begged, placing his hand on your breast. Jimin faltered at the soft sensation your flesh yielded. He swooped down to capture your mouth once more, hand caressing your waist and fondling your chest with fervor. </p><p>You whined against his mouth as he pushed you against the stonework of the palace. Your body had nowhere to move but against his. The foreign sensation between your legs was becoming more prevalent the longer Jimin\u2019s hands kept wandering.</p><p>\u201cI-I want to go further, I want to shower you in pleasure&hellip; But, this is dangerous my darling,\u201d he warned, biting his lip as he rested his forehead against yours. \u201cI can\u2019t risk you falling pregnant&hellip; It\u2019s not safe now, not for a child. Not even for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t, um, don\u2019t release inside me. I just finished bleeding, I-I shouldn\u2019t be fertile for at least a few more moons,\u201d you blushed. Jimin raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cEven with that, you could still-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to, please Jimin. I-I\u2019m ready,\u201d you stuttered.</p><p>Jimin sighed and delicately cradled your face in his hands. The next kiss was delicate and endearing. Pulling you closer Jimin kissed you with such care, it made your heart race with the sensation.</p><p>Here you were, with your husband&hellip; The man you were coming to love, no&hellip;</p><p>The man you were certain you loved. </p><p>And you were going to show him, just how much you loved him. </p><p>Grabbing your waist Jimin moved you off of the wall and towards the open doorway to your bedroom. </p><p>Suddenly, Jimin was shoving you on the ground.</p><p>Hard. </p><p>\u201cOw! Jimin, what did I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGAH!\u201d</p><p>Jimin cried and held his arm tightly. </p><p>Blood poured out of his wound, an arrow protruding from his shoulder. Your heart rate accelerated. </p><p>Your throat began to ache, that\u2019s when you realized that you were screaming. Jimin hissed in pain, but reached up and grabbed the arrow, snapping the broad head off. You gasped and held your hands over your mouth, trying to keep the tears at bay. </p><p>Pounding came on your door. </p><p>\u201cHighness! Lady Y/N! The Forsaken are surrounding the castle, we must move. NOW!\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice yelled. </p><p>\u201cNamjoon, Jimin has been shot!\u201d you cried, shuffling quickly towards your husband. Jimin kept his head low, obviously in agony. </p><p>\u201cHighness!\u201d Namjoon shouted, coming in through the doorway and hurrying to his future King. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, get her out of here. She\u2019s the one they want,\u201d Jimin grit out. </p><p>\u201cHighness I can\u2019t possibly leave you injured like this,\u201d Namjoon defied. </p><p>\u201cJimin I won\u2019t leave you here either, don\u2019t even think about it,\u201d you stated firm. </p><p>Your husband groaned in pain, his arm no doubt on fire from the arrow lodged deep in his muscles. The arms that you just had around your frame. The embrace that made you feel so safe, and cared for. Now stained with blood&hellip;</p><p>Namjoon wrapped his arms around Jimin and lifted him into a standing position. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move, now. The Forsaken are attempting to storm the castle,\u201d he explained. </p><p>Jimin nodded. \u201cWhat of the village, have they been evacuated?\u201d Jimin asked. </p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Namjoon started. A dark look passed over his face. \u201cThe village is already up in flames.\u201d</p><p>Your heart stuttered in your throat. Surely not. Surely they had gotten out and all they would have to do is rebuild their home. </p><p>That\u2019s all they had to do&hellip;</p><p>But you remembered it was late into the night. Everyone would have been sleeping in their beds when the flames started. And if the smoke was too much, they probably wouldn\u2019t even have made it from their blankets before they passed. </p><p>Tears blurred your vision as you ran down the stairs after Namjoon and Jimin. Namjoon was barking orders at the guards and watching them begin to make a blockade for the palace entry. </p><p>Loud bangs rung through the hall as you realized that the Forsaken were already at the gates. They were here, and they wanted you dead. </p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Namjoon growled. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jimin asked, growing worryingly pale. </p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to be able to hold them off for long. I need to help them,\u201d Namjoon stated. </p><p>\u201cHyung! Highness!\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice came over the loud yelling in the hall. </p><p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d Jimin said, relieved the younger male was unharmed. </p><p>\u201cJungkook, get them to the stables. I\u2019ve already sent word to Lord Taehyung about the proceedings. I can buy you some time to escape by leading another carriage towards the Royal Palace\u2019s route,\u201d Namjoon ordered.</p><p>\u201cBut Hyung when they catch you,\u201d Jungkook whispered. </p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m aware of my fate here tonight. But, if it means you all can escape to see another sunrise, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m prepared to do. Jungkook,\u201d Namjoon pulled a medallion from his neck and placed it over Jungkook\u2019s head. \u201cI, Kim Namjoon, place you, Jeon Jungkook as the Head of the Royal Guard for the Kingdom of Arcane. Do you swear to protect the Royal family with your life, Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, I won\u2019t allow this!\u201d Jimin yelled. </p><p>\u201cI swear, on my life I will protect the Royal Family,\u201d Jungkook affirmed. </p><p>\u201cMay the Gods watch over your battles, and I pray one day you will wake up not needed,\u201d Namjoon said, resting his forehead against his young friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon,\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice whispered, hoarse from tears. </p><p>\u201cYou have a Kingdom to rule, Highness. A wife to take care of, and a family to protect. Go on. And if you bare a son, I\u2019ve been told Namjoon is a strong name,\u201d he smiled brightly. You nodded and then he was off. Weaving in between the guards attempting to hold off the assault. </p><p>\u201cWe need to go,\u201d Jungkook urged, wrapping Jimin\u2019s good arm around his neck and leading him down the hallway. </p><p>Your heart was racing as you thought of Namjoon. He was an incredible man, and you\u2019d never forget his sacrifice here today. You\u2019d ensure that everyone knew of his bravery, his courage&hellip;</p><p>And you\u2019d also remember his quirky smiles, the way he would fumble over his words in the presence of Lisa, a handmaid in the Royal palace. You\u2019d remember that he had a way with people, and how much he cared for so many people. How dedicated he was to you and Jimin. You would never forget him, and you would always treasure his memories. </p><p>Jimin hobbled along with Jungkook towards the stables, the sounds of the Forsaken outside the castle getting louder and louder. You felt the fear gripping your throat tight, making it harder to breathe. Jimin\u2019s arm was still bleeding, and you feared for him. </p><p>If he kept bleeding like that, he wouldn\u2019t make it through the night.</p><p>Jungkook brought you into the stables. He handed Jimin over to you and pulled his sword out of it\u2019s sheath. You watched as he investigated the surrounding areas. The horses were slightly dazed, but overall they were doing fine. Jungkook let a couple of them out to provide a distraction, leaving one for his own use&hellip;</p><p>And one for Namjoon. </p><p>Finding the older carriage that was meant mainly for transportation of goods, you helped Jimin get in. He huffed and you saw how he was sweating and shaking. His hands were clammy and you felt your gut twist painfully. </p><p>\u201cNow, you two stay in here while I hook up the horse. Lady Y/N, see if you can\u2019t get the bleeding in his arm to subside. Please, hold on Highness,\u201d Jungkook said before shutting the door and latching it. </p><p>Jimin coughed and you frantically turned to your husband, holding his face in your hands. \u201cJimin, please stay with me,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan&hellip; on leaving you,\u201d he gasped, head arching back in pain. You looked around to see if there was anything in the carriage that could absorb the blood he was letting. As well as something to act as a makeshift tourniquet.</p><p>You looked down at your night dress and quickly began tearing it into strips. Jimin watched as you bit into the delicate fabric and tore it apart for him. Even when he was in pain, he still found you so beautiful&hellip;</p><p>\u201cThis might hurt, but please bear with it,\u201d you begged, wrapping the fabric of your dress around his arm and tying it tight. Jimin hissed and bit his lip to try and ease the shock. You continued until you were satisfied and there was much less red staining the bandages. </p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting for you to be tearing your clothes off tonight, I was hoping that would be my job,\u201d Jimin joked. You smiled with tears in your eyes. </p><p>\u201cAnother time, we have our whole lives,\u201d you assured. Jimin coughed and you found his hand and interlocked your fingers. </p><p>\u201cIf I have to wait my whole life that would be indeed be a shame&hellip; But I\u2019d do it for you, my dear,\u201d Jimin whispered. </p><p>\u201cPlease, hold on Highness! Lady Y/N!\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice shouted.</p><p>Soon the carriage moved and you were off, moving out of the stables and through the dark forest. The horses moved quickly, pulling the carriage along the bumpy path with purpose. </p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to wait your whole life,\u201d you smiled, brushing jos damp bangs from his face. </p><p>\u201cI was hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to wait another night to be with you like this,\u201d Jimin stated, looking at your fingers. Stained with his blood and pale in the moonlight. \u201cI was hoping that we could just be ourselves for a little while&hellip; I wouldn\u2019t have to be the future King&hellip; You didn\u2019t have to be the descendant with death looming over your head. We could just be Y/N and Jimin. Two people who wanted to be together, even if it was just for a night,\u201d he rasped. </p><p>\u201cWe still are those people Jimin, but there are so many other aspects to ourselves than the ones you\u2019ve listed. It\u2019ll all be alright, but we have to rely on one another. Otherwise, we\u2019re dead already,\u201d you murmured. </p><p>Jimin nodded, resting his head on your shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m tired, I\u2019ve lost a lot of blood,\u201d he acknowledged. </p><p>Fear gripped your stomach at the notion of him sleeping. \u201cY-You can\u2019t fall asleep, you might not wake up,\u201d you cried, holding his cheek in your palm. Jimin smiled and shook his head. </p><p>\u201cI will wake up, because I know that you\u2019ll be right there for me when I wake. I long to see that,\u201d he promised. </p><p>\u201cYou better wake again, or I\u2019ll never forgive myself,\u201d you urged. Jimin nodded and rested his head once more in the crook of your neck. </p><p>Once his breathing began to even out, you felt your own eyes falling low.</p><p>All of the adrenaline from the past few hours had ran its course, leaving you feeling like a husk. Devoid of any emotion but the desire for sleep. </p><p>Slowly, you leaned against Jimin and felt yourself falling deep into the welcoming darkness of unconsciousness.</p><p>* * *</p><p>You woke when the carriage halted suddenly. Bolting upright you turned and looked at Jimin in panic. He wasn\u2019t grey like you worried you\u2019d wake up to. He was pale, but not deathly so. It made your heart relax just a bit, but you weren\u2019t out of the woods yet. </p><p>Jungkook knocked on your door and pulled it open. \u201cLady Y/N, please head inside,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Not taking into account your state of undress you shook your head. \u201cNo, I promised I\u2019d stay with him until he woke up,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>Jungkook sighed and bit his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch Father Jin and Lord Taehyung, see if he\u2019ll wake up!\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was off, heading towards the palace. The guards came rushing over, already in line to gather your husband. You moved to wrap him up in your arms protectively, not wanting anyone to jostle him too much. </p><p>\u201cMy Lady, may we please help secure him to a pram?\u201d one spoke up. You noticed a few guards coming your way with the medical item in hands. </p><p>\u201cPlease be careful of his arm, he\u2019s been shot,\u201d you whispered. You positioned yourself across the carriage and pulled Jimin forwards with his good arm. The guards adjusted and let him ease into their hold on his back. </p><p>Gently, they hoisted him into the air and onto the sling smoothly. One guard offered your their cloak to cover yourself with while another aided you in departing from the carriage. You reached out and grabbed Jimin\u2019s hand, following the guards towards the palace. </p><p>When you got to the main doors they pulled open with an aged sound that made your heart pound in your ears. These were much like the doors the Forsaken had attempted to break down in order to get to you. </p><p>The entire village was decimated&hellip;</p><p>To get to you.</p><p>Jimin was shot in the arm&hellip;</p><p>That was intended to kill you&hellip;</p><p>You wanted to be sick, but there was nothing in your stomach to ease the nausea that plagued you. </p><p>\u201cLady Y/N! Highness!\u201d Taehyung\u2019s soothing voice came out from the corridors. </p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you cried as the older man embraced you. He held your face in his palms and brushed your hair back. </p><p>\u201cI only received Namjoon\u2019s bird an hour ago. The Forsaken truly took the Summer Castle?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cThey did, in the middle of the night&hellip; The village,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>\u201cDo we know if there are any survivors? How large was the group that ambushed you?\u201d Taehyung tried again.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung, she knows nothing. We\u2019ll have to wait for Namjoon if we want any useful information,\u201d Hoseok\u2019s cold voice came around the corner. </p><p>Your heart stopped at the mention of Namjoon&hellip;</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t get word from Namjoon,\u201d you whispered, tears falling from your face. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Taehyung asked, rubbing your shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHe-He,\u201d you swallowed thick. \u201cIn order for the Forsaken not to follow our carriage&hellip; He took another towards the Royal Palace. To lead them away from our carriage which Jungkook drove,\u201d you answered. </p><p>\u201cI see&hellip;\u201d Taehyung whispered, rubbing his face. </p><p>\u201cYou selfish&hellip; Bitch,\u201d Hoseok growled. Stalking towards you he gripped your throat hard enough to cut off air and shoved you against the brick wall. \u201cThis is all your fault! If you would just fucking end it, then all of those villagers would be alive! Half of my friends and family! My God damned brother! How can anyone be so selfish?!\u201d</p><p>Taehyung grabbed Hoseok\u2019s arms and attempted to pull him off you. </p><p>Your vision was blurring and you heard shouts from the otherside of the room. Suddenly, you were being dropped and you gasped air into your lungs greedily. You coughed and sputtered, trying to get your bearings on the floor. </p><p>\u201cHoseok that is your future Queen! This is treachery of the highest caliber!\u201d Jungkook yelled.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t even supposed to live to be our Queen! She\u2019s supposed to die! Like all of the ones before her have! But here she stands, still alive. While hundreds of innocent lives are killed because of her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about her life!? The only thing she\u2019s done was be born! What choice did she have in any of that!? She didn\u2019t get a choice, Hoseok! So don\u2019t act like she is choosing all of these deaths to happen. This is not her fault,\u201d Jungkook yelled.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s choosing to live even after all the death and destruction that fall in her path. You are all so ignorant. The only reason she is alive now is because Jimin has taken a liking to her. If Jimin hadn\u2019t said something on her behalf, she would be dead by this point,\u201d the assassin sneered. \u201cHe just enjoys the company in his bed at night. A whore to fuck when he\u2019s bored. Isn\u2019t that right, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>You winced on the floor and shook your head. \u201cNo&hellip; That\u2019s not-true,\u201d you rasped. Your throat ached and you knew it was going to bruise if it hadn\u2019t started already.</p><p>\u201cOh, so he doesn\u2019t enjoy your company? You\u2019ve just latched on like a leech and haven\u2019t let go have you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHoseok that is enough!\u201d Taehyung demanded. \u201cThis is my palace, and you are my subordinate! Go to the barracks, Jungkook will deal out your punishment as he sees fit. As head of the Royal Guard I trust your judgement to be pure.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook nodded and took Hoseok by the arm. But before they left Taehyung gripped Hoseok\u2019s Jaw fiercely. \u201cI swear to you, if I see you lay another hand on Lady Y/N, I will kill you myself. Just because you\u2019re marriage was cut short, doesn\u2019t mean everyone else\u2019s has to be either,\u201d Taehyung snarled. </p><p>Jungkook pulled a fuming Hoseok from the room and towards the barracks.</p><p>Taehyung kneeled besides you and helped you sit up against the wall. He tilted your head back and inspected the damage done. He hissed in disapproval and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that he did this to you&hellip; It\u2019s not right, and I won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cHe thinks what he\u2019s doing is best for everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter if one person doesn\u2019t agree with him, or everyone agrees&hellip; He\u2019ll still carry it out&hellip; He wants me dead, Taehyung,\u201d you croaked.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll allow it. Please, don\u2019t let his words infect your mind. You are a good person, and you deserve to have a life. Just because a witch cursed your bloodline doesn\u2019t mean you have to fall victim to that destiny. Because we rule our lives, not somebody else,\u201d Taehyung soothed. </p><p>A cough was heard in the hallway behind you. Taehyung turned to see Father Jin standing there with blood on his hands and robes. His face didn\u2019t seem too panicked. \u201cI finished removing and cleaning the Prince\u2019s wound,\u201d he announced. </p><p>You scrambled to your feet, leaning heavily on Taehyung but wanting to move forward. Jin gasped at your throat no doubt, moving forwards to assess the damage. You pushed away his hands, receiving a quirked brow. \u201cHow is he?\u201d you asked. </p><p>Jin sighed and gave a weak smile. \u201cHe\u2019ll be just fine. He lost a lot of blood, but if we feed him well and let him rest. He\u2019ll be fine soon enough,\u201d he assured. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I see him?\u201d you begged. Jin shook his head with an incredulous laugh. </p><p>\u201cYou also need rest, my Lady,\u201d he reminded. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to do so unless I see him myself. Please, Father, I implore you,\u201d you whimpered. Jin sighed and nodded his head. </p><p>\u201cPlease follow me,\u201d he requested. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the maids prepare a bath and some fresh night clothes. Go see him, and I\u2019ll fetch you later,\u201d Taehyung informed. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said. </p><p>Jin took your arm and lead you towards the back section of the castle. The infirmary was up a few flights of stairs and with Jimin\u2019s condition they didn\u2019t want to jostle him too much. But the infirmary was more for soldiers that could still use their legs. The lower infirmary was smaller, but more accessible for the handicapped warriors. </p><p>Entering through a deep oak door you found Jimin lying in his bed, pale but breathing even.</p><p>Silent tears poured down your face as you crumpled to the floor next to him. Grabbing his good hand you brought it to your lips. \u201cThank the Gods you\u2019re alright,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>The door behind you shut and you knew Jin had left you for some much needed privacy.</p><p>You throat ached already, but you couldn\u2019t stop the sobs that came from your throat. You didn\u2019t expect your night to go like this. You wanted to be wrapped in your husband\u2019s embrace, body and mind together as you experienced one another bare. </p><p>Kissing his palm you brought his fist under your chin protectively. You wanted to keep him safe, and happy, away from all of this even if just for a night. </p><p>But even that wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>Because you couldn\u2019t help who you were. </p><p>You were his undoing. </p><p>And he was yours&hellip;</p>",

Upon your return you felt a chill go down your spine, a sneeze shook your body.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cHurry my darling, we must get you warmed up,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Jimin ensured that you were in the bath and warm before himself. He went to the Roman baths on the ground level of the castle. </p><p>As you soaked in the warm, soapy water, your mind was plagued with the thoughts of your husband\u2019s body atop yours. You bit your lip as you thought of Jimin between your legs, the mere thought sent a rush of heat to your core\u2026</p><p>Jimin was in a similar situation down in the baths.</p><p>However he was much less refrained. Taking his cock in his hand he quickly stroked himself, chasing after his high like a man possessed. </p><p>\u201cFuck, fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>He breathed into the humid air of the large space.</p><p>Adding pressure to his swollen balls sent him spiraling into a thrusting mess.</p><p>\u201cY/N, Y/N,\u201d he whined into the air. Jimin could feel himself getting closer as he thought of your damp body underneath his on the shore. How exquisite you looked to him.</p><p>He came with the thought of your open mouth waiting for his release. Shuddering against the walls of the bath Jimin tried to even out his breathing.</p><p>Each day was turning into torture for him. He just wanted to get closer to you. Perhaps finally get to experience you and your body\u2026</p><p>But he had to yield. Now wasn\u2019t the time, there were much more daunting tasks once you returned to the palace\u2026</p><p>A coronation. A witch to murder.</p><p>Was there time for the two of you to be intimate in any way? Did Jimin dare get closer, because in the end he might have to deliver the final blow\u2026</p><p>A knock came on the door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Jimin asked, rubbing his body with soap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me Highness,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice announced through the door.</p><p>\u201cEnter,\u201d Jimin approved.</p><p>Jungkook entered wearing his civilian clothing, with his cutlass and accessories around his hip. Jimin raised an eyebrow and sat down in the water that was steaming.</p><p>It was beautiful due to the hot springs underneath the palace. Jimin had forgotten how much he loved it here.</p><p>\u201cHighness, we are to depart shortly after sunrise. The servants already loaded a majority of your luggage in the carriages. Taehyung sent word there was no disturbances in your absence,\u201d Jungkook reported.</p><p>\u201cVery good, what of the Royal Palace? Any news from my mother and my father\u2019s condition?\u201d Jimin asked.</p><p>\u201cYour Father is stable, however weak. Your mother states he is determined to meet his grandchild,\u201d Jungkook whispered.</p><p>Jimin froze. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to wait\u2026 so will I,\u201d Jimin rubbed his face.</p><p>\u201cSire, may we speak as friends. As Jungkook and Jimin instead of Prince and Knight?\u201d Jungkook asked, coming over and sitting next to Jimin. The Prince nodded, leaning his head against the chilled marble.</p><p>\u201cGo on Kook,\u201d Jimin breathed. Jungkook looked at his friend then down at his hands set in his lap.</p><p>\u201cJimin-Hyung, you\u2019ve done so much for me in this life I am certain I won\u2019t be able to repay in within the four I\u2019m granted. But, I do promise that I will fight for you for as long as I can, as hard as I can, as efficiently as I can\u2026 Every knight\u2019s dream is not to go into battle, it is to wake up on a day where he is not needed. Because then he has done his job well.\u201d</p><p>Jimin frowned then looked to his friend with brows furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m unsure of what all of this means, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin sighed, hunching forward with exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, hyung, that you have time to not be worried about certain things. You are allowed to enjoy yourself and enjoy your life. There is so much more out there than the troubling times ahead. Those moments are not here yet, so don\u2019t dwell when there is nothing to dwell upon. There are more important things,\u201d Jungkook touching Jimin\u2019s shoulder gently. \u201cMore important people, to create memories with at the moment,\u201d Jungkook reminded. </p><p>Jimin thought of you both out at the ocean. How he longed to stay out there with you just one moment longer. He would\u2019ve given anything to stay there with you in that moment. </p><p>\u201cI appreciate your words Jungkook, they come from your heart of pure gold I know. I will work hard to make memories worth looking back upon in the years to come,\u201d he assured. </p><p>Jungkook nodded his head and stood up. \u201cI am going to secure the perimeter sire, please rest well,\u201d Jungkook bowed before exiting the large room. Jimin felt a chill run down his spine as the cold air touched his back. </p><p>He did want to make memories with you, but only when you were ready\u2026</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t sure he was ready himself\u2026</p><p>There was only one way to find out\u2026</p><p>* * *</p><p>You stood out on the balcony in your nightdress, feeling the breeze blow against your warmed skin. </p><p>Jimin had been in the baths for a while.</p><p>You blushed thinking back to your actions on the beach. How Jimin had himself situation between your legs. His body moving against yours with such sinful pleasure that it made your heart falter in your chest. </p><p>There were no doubts in your mind you were attracted to your husband. He was a fine man, from the Royal Lineage there was no questions of his beauty. However, he mentioned his preferences lied with men\u2026?</p><p>Was this just him trying to create an heir within you?</p><p>Was it all just a ploy so he could do away with you once he had what he wanted?</p><p>No\u2026</p><p>Jimin wasn\u2019t like that, and you knew better. Jimin had stated he wanted to try to be a couple. To rely on one another like couples were supposed to. And he couldn\u2019t do that if you weren\u2019t ready to carry your load along with his. </p><p>And thinking back to the beach\u2026 Where his strong body was laid out beneath you, completely subject to whatever your thoughts could imagine\u2026</p><p>It was truly thrilling to think of it that way\u2026</p><p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.</p><p>You turned and quickly gathered your dressing robe before answering the sound. \u201cYes, who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Y/N, are you decent?\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice came through the wood. </p><p>Relaxing you placed your dressing gown back on the chair. \u201cYes, you may enter.\u201d</p><p>Jimin walked in with his hair still damp from the baths. He looked refreshed, and much warmer than earlier when you\u2019d parted. </p><p>\u201cWere the baths pleasant?\u201d you asked, sitting down on the trunk at the foot of your bed. Jimin nodded and approached you slowly. </p><p>\u201cYes, they were. You\u2019ll have to experience them the next we visit. They are supposed to aid in fertility,\u201d Jimin stated before sitting next to you. </p><p>You felt your cheeks flush before clearing your throat. \u201cI see, then perhaps I should,\u201d you squeaked. </p><p>Jimin giggled and you turned your head quickly. You\u2019d certainly never heard that sound from him before. Because now that you had, you were certain you\u2019d never forget it. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning pink, darling,\u201d he pointed out. </p><p>You huffed and rubbed your cheeks before standing up. \u201cI-It was warm in the baths, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Hurrying out to the balcony you crossed your arms over your chest in frustration. Why did he insist on teasing you on such a delicate matter? Surely the thought terrified him too?</p><p>Or was he merely thinking of the means to procure a royal?</p><p>Footsteps followed your path outside and warm arms encaptured your form. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be cross, my dear, I\u2019m only jesting,\u201d Jimin whispered in your neck. You bit your lip and shuddered against his form. </p><p>\u201cA child is no joking matter,\u201d you reminded, firm. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, but watching you get flustered at the mention of one surely is means for a slight joke, is it not?\u201d Jimin tried again.</p><p>\u201cMocking my purity is not a joke either,\u201d you warned. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, supposing your purity is kept for much longer,\u201d Jimin breathed in your ear. The heat of his breath made your knees wobbly. \u201cI\u2019d never do anything you didn\u2019t want. But please know that I\u2019ll do whatever you ask of me.\u201d</p><p>Turning fast you wrapped your arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cThen kiss me, like you won\u2019t get to do it again,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>All thoughts of preventing an heir, the war you were in, the lives at stake flew from your head the moment Jimin pressed his lips against yours. You were lost to the ocean of his eyes and the solid Earth of his body. </p><p>You wanted more of him. More of his skin against yours and his lips in places you\u2019d be too ashamed to ask for. Oh Gods it was everything you could do to stay on your feet. And Jimin seemed to be thinking in a similar fashion. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making it difficult for me to think,\u201d he warned, pulling away from your lips. Chest heaving you gripped his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think, just feel,\u201d you begged, placing his hand on your breast. Jimin faltered at the soft sensation your flesh yielded. He swooped down to capture your mouth once more, hand caressing your waist and fondling your chest with fervor. </p><p>You whined against his mouth as he pushed you against the stonework of the palace. Your body had nowhere to move but against his. The foreign sensation between your legs was becoming more prevalent the longer Jimin\u2019s hands kept wandering.</p><p>\u201cI-I want to go further, I want to shower you in pleasure\u2026 But, this is dangerous my darling,\u201d he warned, biting his lip as he rested his forehead against yours. \u201cI can\u2019t risk you falling pregnant\u2026 It\u2019s not safe now, not for a child. Not even for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t, um, don\u2019t release inside me. I just finished bleeding, I-I shouldn\u2019t be fertile for at least a few more moons,\u201d you blushed. Jimin raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cEven with that, you could still-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to, please Jimin. I-I\u2019m ready,\u201d you stuttered.</p><p>Jimin sighed and delicately cradled your face in his hands. The next kiss was delicate and endearing. Pulling you closer Jimin kissed you with such care, it made your heart race with the sensation.</p><p>Here you were, with your husband\u2026 The man you were coming to love, no\u2026</p><p>The man you were certain you loved. </p><p>And you were going to show him, just how much you loved him. </p><p>Grabbing your waist Jimin moved you off of the wall and towards the open doorway to your bedroom. </p><p>Suddenly, Jimin was shoving you on the ground.</p><p>Hard. </p><p>\u201cOw! Jimin, what did I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGAH!\u201d</p><p>Jimin cried and held his arm tightly. </p><p>Blood poured out of his wound, an arrow protruding from his shoulder. Your heart rate accelerated. </p><p>Your throat began to ache, that\u2019s when you realized that you were screaming. Jimin hissed in pain, but reached up and grabbed the arrow, snapping the broad head off. You gasped and held your hands over your mouth, trying to keep the tears at bay. </p><p>Pounding came on your door. </p><p>\u201cHighness! Lady Y/N! The Forsaken are surrounding the castle, we must move. NOW!\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice yelled. </p><p>\u201cNamjoon, Jimin has been shot!\u201d you cried, shuffling quickly towards your husband. Jimin kept his head low, obviously in agony. </p><p>\u201cHighness!\u201d Namjoon shouted, coming in through the doorway and hurrying to his future King. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, get her out of here. She\u2019s the one they want,\u201d Jimin grit out. </p><p>\u201cHighness I can\u2019t possibly leave you injured like this,\u201d Namjoon defied. </p><p>\u201cJimin I won\u2019t leave you here either, don\u2019t even think about it,\u201d you stated firm. </p><p>Your husband groaned in pain, his arm no doubt on fire from the arrow lodged deep in his muscles. The arms that you just had around your frame. The embrace that made you feel so safe, and cared for. Now stained with blood\u2026</p><p>Namjoon wrapped his arms around Jimin and lifted him into a standing position. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move, now. The Forsaken are attempting to storm the castle,\u201d he explained. </p><p>Jimin nodded. \u201cWhat of the village, have they been evacuated?\u201d Jimin asked. </p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Namjoon started. A dark look passed over his face. \u201cThe village is already up in flames.\u201d</p><p>Your heart stuttered in your throat. Surely not. Surely they had gotten out and all they would have to do is rebuild their home. </p><p>That\u2019s all they had to do\u2026</p><p>But you remembered it was late into the night. Everyone would have been sleeping in their beds when the flames started. And if the smoke was too much, they probably wouldn\u2019t even have made it from their blankets before they passed. </p><p>Tears blurred your vision as you ran down the stairs after Namjoon and Jimin. Namjoon was barking orders at the guards and watching them begin to make a blockade for the palace entry. </p><p>Loud bangs rung through the hall as you realized that the Forsaken were already at the gates. They were here, and they wanted you dead. </p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Namjoon growled. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jimin asked, growing worryingly pale. </p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to be able to hold them off for long. I need to help them,\u201d Namjoon stated. </p><p>\u201cHyung! Highness!\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice came over the loud yelling in the hall. </p><p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d Jimin said, relieved the younger male was unharmed. </p><p>\u201cJungkook, get them to the stables. I\u2019ve already sent word to Lord Taehyung about the proceedings. I can buy you some time to escape by leading another carriage towards the Royal Palace\u2019s route,\u201d Namjoon ordered.</p><p>\u201cBut Hyung when they catch you,\u201d Jungkook whispered. </p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m aware of my fate here tonight. But, if it means you all can escape to see another sunrise, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m prepared to do. Jungkook,\u201d Namjoon pulled a medallion from his neck and placed it over Jungkook\u2019s head. \u201cI, Kim Namjoon, place you, Jeon Jungkook as the Head of the Royal Guard for the Kingdom of Arcane. Do you swear to protect the Royal family with your life, Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, I won\u2019t allow this!\u201d Jimin yelled. </p><p>\u201cI swear, on my life I will protect the Royal Family,\u201d Jungkook affirmed. </p><p>\u201cMay the Gods watch over your battles, and I pray one day you will wake up not needed,\u201d Namjoon said, resting his forehead against his young friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon,\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice whispered, hoarse from tears. </p><p>\u201cYou have a Kingdom to rule, Highness. A wife to take care of, and a family to protect. Go on. And if you bare a son, I\u2019ve been told Namjoon is a strong name,\u201d he smiled brightly. You nodded and then he was off. Weaving in between the guards attempting to hold off the assault. </p><p>\u201cWe need to go,\u201d Jungkook urged, wrapping Jimin\u2019s good arm around his neck and leading him down the hallway. </p><p>Your heart was racing as you thought of Namjoon. He was an incredible man, and you\u2019d never forget his sacrifice here today. You\u2019d ensure that everyone knew of his bravery, his courage\u2026</p><p>And you\u2019d also remember his quirky smiles, the way he would fumble over his words in the presence of Lisa, a handmaid in the Royal palace. You\u2019d remember that he had a way with people, and how much he cared for so many people. How dedicated he was to you and Jimin. You would never forget him, and you would always treasure his memories. </p><p>Jimin hobbled along with Jungkook towards the stables, the sounds of the Forsaken outside the castle getting louder and louder. You felt the fear gripping your throat tight, making it harder to breathe. Jimin\u2019s arm was still bleeding, and you feared for him. </p><p>If he kept bleeding like that, he wouldn\u2019t make it through the night.</p><p>Jungkook brought you into the stables. He handed Jimin over to you and pulled his sword out of it\u2019s sheath. You watched as he investigated the surrounding areas. The horses were slightly dazed, but overall they were doing fine. Jungkook let a couple of them out to provide a distraction, leaving one for his own use\u2026</p><p>And one for Namjoon. </p><p>Finding the older carriage that was meant mainly for transportation of goods, you helped Jimin get in. He huffed and you saw how he was sweating and shaking. His hands were clammy and you felt your gut twist painfully. </p><p>\u201cNow, you two stay in here while I hook up the horse. Lady Y/N, see if you can\u2019t get the bleeding in his arm to subside. Please, hold on Highness,\u201d Jungkook said before shutting the door and latching it. </p><p>Jimin coughed and you frantically turned to your husband, holding his face in your hands. \u201cJimin, please stay with me,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan\u2026 on leaving you,\u201d he gasped, head arching back in pain. You looked around to see if there was anything in the carriage that could absorb the blood he was letting. As well as something to act as a makeshift tourniquet.</p><p>You looked down at your night dress and quickly began tearing it into strips. Jimin watched as you bit into the delicate fabric and tore it apart for him. Even when he was in pain, he still found you so beautiful\u2026</p><p>\u201cThis might hurt, but please bear with it,\u201d you begged, wrapping the fabric of your dress around his arm and tying it tight. Jimin hissed and bit his lip to try and ease the shock. You continued until you were satisfied and there was much less red staining the bandages. </p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting for you to be tearing your clothes off tonight, I was hoping that would be my job,\u201d Jimin joked. You smiled with tears in your eyes. </p><p>\u201cAnother time, we have our whole lives,\u201d you assured. Jimin coughed and you found his hand and interlocked your fingers. </p><p>\u201cIf I have to wait my whole life that would be indeed be a shame\u2026 But I\u2019d do it for you, my dear,\u201d Jimin whispered. </p><p>\u201cPlease, hold on Highness! Lady Y/N!\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice shouted.</p><p>Soon the carriage moved and you were off, moving out of the stables and through the dark forest. The horses moved quickly, pulling the carriage along the bumpy path with purpose. </p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to wait your whole life,\u201d you smiled, brushing jos damp bangs from his face. </p><p>\u201cI was hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to wait another night to be with you like this,\u201d Jimin stated, looking at your fingers. Stained with his blood and pale in the moonlight. \u201cI was hoping that we could just be ourselves for a little while\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have to be the future King\u2026 You didn\u2019t have to be the descendant with death looming over your head. We could just be Y/N and Jimin. Two people who wanted to be together, even if it was just for a night,\u201d he rasped. </p><p>\u201cWe still are those people Jimin, but there are so many other aspects to ourselves than the ones you\u2019ve listed. It\u2019ll all be alright, but we have to rely on one another. Otherwise, we\u2019re dead already,\u201d you murmured. </p><p>Jimin nodded, resting his head on your shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m tired, I\u2019ve lost a lot of blood,\u201d he acknowledged. </p><p>Fear gripped your stomach at the notion of him sleeping. \u201cY-You can\u2019t fall asleep, you might not wake up,\u201d you cried, holding his cheek in your palm. Jimin smiled and shook his head. </p><p>\u201cI will wake up, because I know that you\u2019ll be right there for me when I wake. I long to see that,\u201d he promised. </p><p>\u201cYou better wake again, or I\u2019ll never forgive myself,\u201d you urged. Jimin nodded and rested his head once more in the crook of your neck. </p><p>Once his breathing began to even out, you felt your own eyes falling low.</p><p>All of the adrenaline from the past few hours had ran its course, leaving you feeling like a husk. Devoid of any emotion but the desire for sleep. </p><p>Slowly, you leaned against Jimin and felt yourself falling deep into the welcoming darkness of unconsciousness.</p><p>* * *</p><p>You woke when the carriage halted suddenly. Bolting upright you turned and looked at Jimin in panic. He wasn\u2019t grey like you worried you\u2019d wake up to. He was pale, but not deathly so. It made your heart relax just a bit, but you weren\u2019t out of the woods yet. </p><p>Jungkook knocked on your door and pulled it open. \u201cLady Y/N, please head inside,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Not taking into account your state of undress you shook your head. \u201cNo, I promised I\u2019d stay with him until he woke up,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>Jungkook sighed and bit his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch Father Jin and Lord Taehyung, see if he\u2019ll wake up!\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was off, heading towards the palace. The guards came rushing over, already in line to gather your husband. You moved to wrap him up in your arms protectively, not wanting anyone to jostle him too much. </p><p>\u201cMy Lady, may we please help secure him to a pram?\u201d one spoke up. You noticed a few guards coming your way with the medical item in hands. </p><p>\u201cPlease be careful of his arm, he\u2019s been shot,\u201d you whispered. You positioned yourself across the carriage and pulled Jimin forwards with his good arm. The guards adjusted and let him ease into their hold on his back. </p><p>Gently, they hoisted him into the air and onto the sling smoothly. One guard offered your their cloak to cover yourself with while another aided you in departing from the carriage. You reached out and grabbed Jimin\u2019s hand, following the guards towards the palace. </p><p>When you got to the main doors they pulled open with an aged sound that made your heart pound in your ears. These were much like the doors the Forsaken had attempted to break down in order to get to you. </p><p>The entire village was decimated\u2026</p><p>To get to you.</p><p>Jimin was shot in the arm\u2026</p><p>That was intended to kill you\u2026</p><p>You wanted to be sick, but there was nothing in your stomach to ease the nausea that plagued you. </p><p>\u201cLady Y/N! Highness!\u201d Taehyung\u2019s soothing voice came out from the corridors. </p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you cried as the older man embraced you. He held your face in his palms and brushed your hair back. </p><p>\u201cI only received Namjoon\u2019s bird an hour ago. The Forsaken truly took the Summer Castle?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cThey did, in the middle of the night\u2026 The village,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>\u201cDo we know if there are any survivors? How large was the group that ambushed you?\u201d Taehyung tried again.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung, she knows nothing. We\u2019ll have to wait for Namjoon if we want any useful information,\u201d Hoseok\u2019s cold voice came around the corner. </p><p>Your heart stopped at the mention of Namjoon\u2026</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t get word from Namjoon,\u201d you whispered, tears falling from your face. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Taehyung asked, rubbing your shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHe-He,\u201d you swallowed thick. \u201cIn order for the Forsaken not to follow our carriage\u2026 He took another towards the Royal Palace. To lead them away from our carriage which Jungkook drove,\u201d you answered. </p><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Taehyung whispered, rubbing his face. </p><p>\u201cYou selfish\u2026 Bitch,\u201d Hoseok growled. Stalking towards you he gripped your throat hard enough to cut off air and shoved you against the brick wall. \u201cThis is all your fault! If you would just fucking end it, then all of those villagers would be alive! Half of my friends and family! My God damned brother! How can anyone be so selfish?!\u201d</p><p>Taehyung grabbed Hoseok\u2019s arms and attempted to pull him off you. </p><p>Your vision was blurring and you heard shouts from the otherside of the room. Suddenly, you were being dropped and you gasped air into your lungs greedily. You coughed and sputtered, trying to get your bearings on the floor. </p><p>\u201cHoseok that is your future Queen! This is treachery of the highest caliber!\u201d Jungkook yelled.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t even supposed to live to be our Queen! She\u2019s supposed to die! Like all of the ones before her have! But here she stands, still alive. While hundreds of innocent lives are killed because of her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about her life!? The only thing she\u2019s done was be born! What choice did she have in any of that!? She didn\u2019t get a choice, Hoseok! So don\u2019t act like she is choosing all of these deaths to happen. This is not her fault,\u201d Jungkook yelled.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s choosing to live even after all the death and destruction that fall in her path. You are all so ignorant. The only reason she is alive now is because Jimin has taken a liking to her. If Jimin hadn\u2019t said something on her behalf, she would be dead by this point,\u201d the assassin sneered. \u201cHe just enjoys the company in his bed at night. A whore to fuck when he\u2019s bored. Isn\u2019t that right, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>You winced on the floor and shook your head. \u201cNo\u2026 That\u2019s not-true,\u201d you rasped. Your throat ached and you knew it was going to bruise if it hadn\u2019t started already.</p><p>\u201cOh, so he doesn\u2019t enjoy your company? You\u2019ve just latched on like a leech and haven\u2019t let go have you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHoseok that is enough!\u201d Taehyung demanded. \u201cThis is my palace, and you are my subordinate! Go to the barracks, Jungkook will deal out your punishment as he sees fit. As head of the Royal Guard I trust your judgement to be pure.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook nodded and took Hoseok by the arm. But before they left Taehyung gripped Hoseok\u2019s Jaw fiercely. \u201cI swear to you, if I see you lay another hand on Lady Y/N, I will kill you myself. Just because you\u2019re marriage was cut short, doesn\u2019t mean everyone else\u2019s has to be either,\u201d Taehyung snarled. </p><p>Jungkook pulled a fuming Hoseok from the room and towards the barracks.</p><p>Taehyung kneeled besides you and helped you sit up against the wall. He tilted your head back and inspected the damage done. He hissed in disapproval and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that he did this to you\u2026 It\u2019s not right, and I won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cHe thinks what he\u2019s doing is best for everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter if one person doesn\u2019t agree with him, or everyone agrees\u2026 He\u2019ll still carry it out\u2026 He wants me dead, Taehyung,\u201d you croaked.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll allow it. Please, don\u2019t let his words infect your mind. You are a good person, and you deserve to have a life. Just because a witch cursed your bloodline doesn\u2019t mean you have to fall victim to that destiny. Because we rule our lives, not somebody else,\u201d Taehyung soothed. </p><p>A cough was heard in the hallway behind you. Taehyung turned to see Father Jin standing there with blood on his hands and robes. His face didn\u2019t seem too panicked. \u201cI finished removing and cleaning the Prince\u2019s wound,\u201d he announced. </p><p>You scrambled to your feet, leaning heavily on Taehyung but wanting to move forward. Jin gasped at your throat no doubt, moving forwards to assess the damage. You pushed away his hands, receiving a quirked brow. \u201cHow is he?\u201d you asked. </p><p>Jin sighed and gave a weak smile. \u201cHe\u2019ll be just fine. He lost a lot of blood, but if we feed him well and let him rest. He\u2019ll be fine soon enough,\u201d he assured. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I see him?\u201d you begged. Jin shook his head with an incredulous laugh. </p><p>\u201cYou also need rest, my Lady,\u201d he reminded. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to do so unless I see him myself. Please, Father, I implore you,\u201d you whimpered. Jin sighed and nodded his head. </p><p>\u201cPlease follow me,\u201d he requested. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the maids prepare a bath and some fresh night clothes. Go see him, and I\u2019ll fetch you later,\u201d Taehyung informed. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said. </p><p>Jin took your arm and lead you towards the back section of the castle. The infirmary was up a few flights of stairs and with Jimin\u2019s condition they didn\u2019t want to jostle him too much. But the infirmary was more for soldiers that could still use their legs. The lower infirmary was smaller, but more accessible for the handicapped warriors. </p><p>Entering through a deep oak door you found Jimin lying in his bed, pale but breathing even.</p><p>Silent tears poured down your face as you crumpled to the floor next to him. Grabbing his good hand you brought it to your lips. \u201cThank the Gods you\u2019re alright,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>The door behind you shut and you knew Jin had left you for some much needed privacy.</p><p>You throat ached already, but you couldn\u2019t stop the sobs that came from your throat. You didn\u2019t expect your night to go like this. You wanted to be wrapped in your husband\u2019s embrace, body and mind together as you experienced one another bare. </p><p>Kissing his palm you brought his fist under your chin protectively. You wanted to keep him safe, and happy, away from all of this even if just for a night. </p><p>But even that wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>Because you couldn\u2019t help who you were. </p><p>You were his undoing. </p><p>And he was yours\u2026</p>",

Taking his cock in his hand he quickly stroked himself, chasing after his high like a man possessed. </p><p>\u201cFuck, fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>He breathed into the humid air of the large space.</p><p>Adding pressure to his swollen balls sent him spiraling into a thrusting mess.</p><p>\u201cY/N, Y/N,\u201d he whined into the air. Jimin could feel himself getting closer as he thought of your damp body underneath his on the shore. How exquisite you looked to him.</p><p>He came with the thought of your open mouth waiting for his release. Shuddering against the walls of the bath Jimin tried to even out his breathing.</p><p>Each day was turning into torture for him. He just wanted to get closer to you. Perhaps finally get to experience you and your body\u2026</p><p>But he had to yield. Now wasn\u2019t the time, there were much more daunting tasks once you returned to the palace\u2026</p><p>A coronation. A witch to murder.</p><p>Was there time for the two of you to be intimate in any way? Did Jimin dare get closer, because in the end he might have to deliver the final blow\u2026</p><p>A knock came on the door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Jimin asked, rubbing his body with soap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me Highness,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice announced through the door.</p><p>\u201cEnter,\u201d Jimin approved.</p><p>Jungkook entered wearing his civilian clothing, with his cutlass and accessories around his hip. Jimin raised an eyebrow and sat down in the water that was steaming.</p><p>It was beautiful due to the hot springs underneath the palace. Jimin had forgotten how much he loved it here.</p><p>\u201cHighness, we are to depart shortly after sunrise. The servants already loaded a majority of your luggage in the carriages. Taehyung sent word there was no disturbances in your absence,\u201d Jungkook reported.</p><p>\u201cVery good, what of the Royal Palace? Any news from my mother and my father\u2019s condition?\u201d Jimin asked.</p><p>\u201cYour Father is stable, however weak. Your mother states he is determined to meet his grandchild,\u201d Jungkook whispered.</p><p>Jimin froze. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to wait\u2026 so will I,\u201d Jimin rubbed his face.</p><p>\u201cSire, may we speak as friends. As Jungkook and Jimin instead of Prince and Knight?\u201d Jungkook asked, coming over and sitting next to Jimin. The Prince nodded, leaning his head against the chilled marble.</p><p>\u201cGo on Kook,\u201d Jimin breathed. Jungkook looked at his friend then down at his hands set in his lap.</p><p>\u201cJimin-Hyung, you\u2019ve done so much for me in this life I am certain I won\u2019t be able to repay in within the four I\u2019m granted. But, I do promise that I will fight for you for as long as I can, as hard as I can, as efficiently as I can\u2026 Every knight\u2019s dream is not to go into battle, it is to wake up on a day where he is not needed. Because then he has done his job well.\u201d</p><p>Jimin frowned then looked to his friend with brows furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m unsure of what all of this means, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin sighed, hunching forward with exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, hyung, that you have time to not be worried about certain things. You are allowed to enjoy yourself and enjoy your life. There is so much more out there than the troubling times ahead. Those moments are not here yet, so don\u2019t dwell when there is nothing to dwell upon. There are more important things,\u201d Jungkook touching Jimin\u2019s shoulder gently. \u201cMore important people, to create memories with at the moment,\u201d Jungkook reminded. </p><p>Jimin thought of you both out at the ocean. How he longed to stay out there with you just one moment longer. He would\u2019ve given anything to stay there with you in that moment. </p><p>\u201cI appreciate your words Jungkook, they come from your heart of pure gold I know. I will work hard to make memories worth looking back upon in the years to come,\u201d he assured. </p><p>Jungkook nodded his head and stood up. \u201cI am going to secure the perimeter sire, please rest well,\u201d Jungkook bowed before exiting the large room. Jimin felt a chill run down his spine as the cold air touched his back. </p><p>He did want to make memories with you, but only when you were ready\u2026</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t sure he was ready himself\u2026</p><p>There was only one way to find out\u2026</p><p>* * *</p><p>You stood out on the balcony in your nightdress, feeling the breeze blow against your warmed skin. </p><p>Jimin had been in the baths for a while.</p><p>You blushed thinking back to your actions on the beach. How Jimin had himself situation between your legs. His body moving against yours with such sinful pleasure that it made your heart falter in your chest. </p><p>There were no doubts in your mind you were attracted to your husband. He was a fine man, from the Royal Lineage there was no questions of his beauty. However, he mentioned his preferences lied with men\u2026?</p><p>Was this just him trying to create an heir within you?</p><p>Was it all just a ploy so he could do away with you once he had what he wanted?</p><p>No\u2026</p><p>Jimin wasn\u2019t like that, and you knew better. Jimin had stated he wanted to try to be a couple. To rely on one another like couples were supposed to. And he couldn\u2019t do that if you weren\u2019t ready to carry your load along with his. </p><p>And thinking back to the beach\u2026 Where his strong body was laid out beneath you, completely subject to whatever your thoughts could imagine\u2026</p><p>It was truly thrilling to think of it that way\u2026</p><p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.</p><p>You turned and quickly gathered your dressing robe before answering the sound. \u201cYes, who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Y/N, are you decent?\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice came through the wood. </p><p>Relaxing you placed your dressing gown back on the chair. \u201cYes, you may enter.\u201d</p><p>Jimin walked in with his hair still damp from the baths. He looked refreshed, and much warmer than earlier when you\u2019d parted. </p><p>\u201cWere the baths pleasant?\u201d you asked, sitting down on the trunk at the foot of your bed. Jimin nodded and approached you slowly. </p><p>\u201cYes, they were. You\u2019ll have to experience them the next we visit. They are supposed to aid in fertility,\u201d Jimin stated before sitting next to you. </p><p>You felt your cheeks flush before clearing your throat. \u201cI see, then perhaps I should,\u201d you squeaked. </p><p>Jimin giggled and you turned your head quickly. You\u2019d certainly never heard that sound from him before. Because now that you had, you were certain you\u2019d never forget it. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning pink, darling,\u201d he pointed out. </p><p>You huffed and rubbed your cheeks before standing up. \u201cI-It was warm in the baths, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Hurrying out to the balcony you crossed your arms over your chest in frustration. Why did he insist on teasing you on such a delicate matter? Surely the thought terrified him too?</p><p>Or was he merely thinking of the means to procure a royal?</p><p>Footsteps followed your path outside and warm arms encaptured your form. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be cross, my dear, I\u2019m only jesting,\u201d Jimin whispered in your neck. You bit your lip and shuddered against his form. </p><p>\u201cA child is no joking matter,\u201d you reminded, firm. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, but watching you get flustered at the mention of one surely is means for a slight joke, is it not?\u201d Jimin tried again.</p><p>\u201cMocking my purity is not a joke either,\u201d you warned. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, supposing your purity is kept for much longer,\u201d Jimin breathed in your ear. The heat of his breath made your knees wobbly. \u201cI\u2019d never do anything you didn\u2019t want. But please know that I\u2019ll do whatever you ask of me.\u201d</p><p>Turning fast you wrapped your arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cThen kiss me, like you won\u2019t get to do it again,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>All thoughts of preventing an heir, the war you were in, the lives at stake flew from your head the moment Jimin pressed his lips against yours. You were lost to the ocean of his eyes and the solid Earth of his body. </p><p>You wanted more of him. More of his skin against yours and his lips in places you\u2019d be too ashamed to ask for. Oh Gods it was everything you could do to stay on your feet. And Jimin seemed to be thinking in a similar fashion. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making it difficult for me to think,\u201d he warned, pulling away from your lips. Chest heaving you gripped his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think, just feel,\u201d you begged, placing his hand on your breast. Jimin faltered at the soft sensation your flesh yielded. He swooped down to capture your mouth once more, hand caressing your waist and fondling your chest with fervor. </p><p>You whined against his mouth as he pushed you against the stonework of the palace. Your body had nowhere to move but against his. The foreign sensation between your legs was becoming more prevalent the longer Jimin\u2019s hands kept wandering.</p><p>\u201cI-I want to go further, I want to shower you in pleasure\u2026 But, this is dangerous my darling,\u201d he warned, biting his lip as he rested his forehead against yours. \u201cI can\u2019t risk you falling pregnant\u2026 It\u2019s not safe now, not for a child. Not even for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t, um, don\u2019t release inside me. I just finished bleeding, I-I shouldn\u2019t be fertile for at least a few more moons,\u201d you blushed. Jimin raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cEven with that, you could still-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to, please Jimin. I-I\u2019m ready,\u201d you stuttered.</p><p>Jimin sighed and delicately cradled your face in his hands. The next kiss was delicate and endearing. Pulling you closer Jimin kissed you with such care, it made your heart race with the sensation.</p><p>Here you were, with your husband\u2026 The man you were coming to love, no\u2026</p><p>The man you were certain you loved. </p><p>And you were going to show him, just how much you loved him. </p><p>Grabbing your waist Jimin moved you off of the wall and towards the open doorway to your bedroom. </p><p>Suddenly, Jimin was shoving you on the ground.</p><p>Hard. </p><p>\u201cOw! Jimin, what did I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGAH!\u201d</p><p>Jimin cried and held his arm tightly. </p><p>Blood poured out of his wound, an arrow protruding from his shoulder. Your heart rate accelerated. </p><p>Your throat began to ache, that\u2019s when you realized that you were screaming. Jimin hissed in pain, but reached up and grabbed the arrow, snapping the broad head off. You gasped and held your hands over your mouth, trying to keep the tears at bay. </p><p>Pounding came on your door. </p><p>\u201cHighness! Lady Y/N! The Forsaken are surrounding the castle, we must move. NOW!\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice yelled. </p><p>\u201cNamjoon, Jimin has been shot!\u201d you cried, shuffling quickly towards your husband. Jimin kept his head low, obviously in agony. </p><p>\u201cHighness!\u201d Namjoon shouted, coming in through the doorway and hurrying to his future King. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, get her out of here. She\u2019s the one they want,\u201d Jimin grit out. </p><p>\u201cHighness I can\u2019t possibly leave you injured like this,\u201d Namjoon defied. </p><p>\u201cJimin I won\u2019t leave you here either, don\u2019t even think about it,\u201d you stated firm. </p><p>Your husband groaned in pain, his arm no doubt on fire from the arrow lodged deep in his muscles. The arms that you just had around your frame. The embrace that made you feel so safe, and cared for. Now stained with blood\u2026</p><p>Namjoon wrapped his arms around Jimin and lifted him into a standing position. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move, now. The Forsaken are attempting to storm the castle,\u201d he explained. </p><p>Jimin nodded. \u201cWhat of the village, have they been evacuated?\u201d Jimin asked. </p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Namjoon started. A dark look passed over his face. \u201cThe village is already up in flames.\u201d</p><p>Your heart stuttered in your throat. Surely not. Surely they had gotten out and all they would have to do is rebuild their home. </p><p>That\u2019s all they had to do\u2026</p><p>But you remembered it was late into the night. Everyone would have been sleeping in their beds when the flames started. And if the smoke was too much, they probably wouldn\u2019t even have made it from their blankets before they passed. </p><p>Tears blurred your vision as you ran down the stairs after Namjoon and Jimin. Namjoon was barking orders at the guards and watching them begin to make a blockade for the palace entry. </p><p>Loud bangs rung through the hall as you realized that the Forsaken were already at the gates. They were here, and they wanted you dead. </p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Namjoon growled. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jimin asked, growing worryingly pale. </p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to be able to hold them off for long. I need to help them,\u201d Namjoon stated. </p><p>\u201cHyung! Highness!\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice came over the loud yelling in the hall. </p><p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d Jimin said, relieved the younger male was unharmed. </p><p>\u201cJungkook, get them to the stables. I\u2019ve already sent word to Lord Taehyung about the proceedings. I can buy you some time to escape by leading another carriage towards the Royal Palace\u2019s route,\u201d Namjoon ordered.</p><p>\u201cBut Hyung when they catch you,\u201d Jungkook whispered. </p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m aware of my fate here tonight. But, if it means you all can escape to see another sunrise, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m prepared to do. Jungkook,\u201d Namjoon pulled a medallion from his neck and placed it over Jungkook\u2019s head. \u201cI, Kim Namjoon, place you, Jeon Jungkook as the Head of the Royal Guard for the Kingdom of Arcane. Do you swear to protect the Royal family with your life, Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, I won\u2019t allow this!\u201d Jimin yelled. </p><p>\u201cI swear, on my life I will protect the Royal Family,\u201d Jungkook affirmed. </p><p>\u201cMay the Gods watch over your battles, and I pray one day you will wake up not needed,\u201d Namjoon said, resting his forehead against his young friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon,\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice whispered, hoarse from tears. </p><p>\u201cYou have a Kingdom to rule, Highness. A wife to take care of, and a family to protect. Go on. And if you bare a son, I\u2019ve been told Namjoon is a strong name,\u201d he smiled brightly. You nodded and then he was off. Weaving in between the guards attempting to hold off the assault. </p><p>\u201cWe need to go,\u201d Jungkook urged, wrapping Jimin\u2019s good arm around his neck and leading him down the hallway. </p><p>Your heart was racing as you thought of Namjoon. He was an incredible man, and you\u2019d never forget his sacrifice here today. You\u2019d ensure that everyone knew of his bravery, his courage\u2026</p><p>And you\u2019d also remember his quirky smiles, the way he would fumble over his words in the presence of Lisa, a handmaid in the Royal palace. You\u2019d remember that he had a way with people, and how much he cared for so many people. How dedicated he was to you and Jimin. You would never forget him, and you would always treasure his memories. </p><p>Jimin hobbled along with Jungkook towards the stables, the sounds of the Forsaken outside the castle getting louder and louder. You felt the fear gripping your throat tight, making it harder to breathe. Jimin\u2019s arm was still bleeding, and you feared for him. </p><p>If he kept bleeding like that, he wouldn\u2019t make it through the night.</p><p>Jungkook brought you into the stables. He handed Jimin over to you and pulled his sword out of it\u2019s sheath. You watched as he investigated the surrounding areas. The horses were slightly dazed, but overall they were doing fine. Jungkook let a couple of them out to provide a distraction, leaving one for his own use\u2026</p><p>And one for Namjoon. </p><p>Finding the older carriage that was meant mainly for transportation of goods, you helped Jimin get in. He huffed and you saw how he was sweating and shaking. His hands were clammy and you felt your gut twist painfully. </p><p>\u201cNow, you two stay in here while I hook up the horse. Lady Y/N, see if you can\u2019t get the bleeding in his arm to subside. Please, hold on Highness,\u201d Jungkook said before shutting the door and latching it. </p><p>Jimin coughed and you frantically turned to your husband, holding his face in your hands. \u201cJimin, please stay with me,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan\u2026 on leaving you,\u201d he gasped, head arching back in pain. You looked around to see if there was anything in the carriage that could absorb the blood he was letting. As well as something to act as a makeshift tourniquet.</p><p>You looked down at your night dress and quickly began tearing it into strips. Jimin watched as you bit into the delicate fabric and tore it apart for him. Even when he was in pain, he still found you so beautiful\u2026</p><p>\u201cThis might hurt, but please bear with it,\u201d you begged, wrapping the fabric of your dress around his arm and tying it tight. Jimin hissed and bit his lip to try and ease the shock. You continued until you were satisfied and there was much less red staining the bandages. </p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting for you to be tearing your clothes off tonight, I was hoping that would be my job,\u201d Jimin joked. You smiled with tears in your eyes. </p><p>\u201cAnother time, we have our whole lives,\u201d you assured. Jimin coughed and you found his hand and interlocked your fingers. </p><p>\u201cIf I have to wait my whole life that would be indeed be a shame\u2026 But I\u2019d do it for you, my dear,\u201d Jimin whispered. </p><p>\u201cPlease, hold on Highness! Lady Y/N!\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice shouted.</p><p>Soon the carriage moved and you were off, moving out of the stables and through the dark forest. The horses moved quickly, pulling the carriage along the bumpy path with purpose. </p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to wait your whole life,\u201d you smiled, brushing jos damp bangs from his face. </p><p>\u201cI was hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to wait another night to be with you like this,\u201d Jimin stated, looking at your fingers. Stained with his blood and pale in the moonlight. \u201cI was hoping that we could just be ourselves for a little while\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have to be the future King\u2026 You didn\u2019t have to be the descendant with death looming over your head. We could just be Y/N and Jimin. Two people who wanted to be together, even if it was just for a night,\u201d he rasped. </p><p>\u201cWe still are those people Jimin, but there are so many other aspects to ourselves than the ones you\u2019ve listed. It\u2019ll all be alright, but we have to rely on one another. Otherwise, we\u2019re dead already,\u201d you murmured. </p><p>Jimin nodded, resting his head on your shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m tired, I\u2019ve lost a lot of blood,\u201d he acknowledged. </p><p>Fear gripped your stomach at the notion of him sleeping. \u201cY-You can\u2019t fall asleep, you might not wake up,\u201d you cried, holding his cheek in your palm. Jimin smiled and shook his head. </p><p>\u201cI will wake up, because I know that you\u2019ll be right there for me when I wake. I long to see that,\u201d he promised. </p><p>\u201cYou better wake again, or I\u2019ll never forgive myself,\u201d you urged. Jimin nodded and rested his head once more in the crook of your neck. </p><p>Once his breathing began to even out, you felt your own eyes falling low.</p><p>All of the adrenaline from the past few hours had ran its course, leaving you feeling like a husk. Devoid of any emotion but the desire for sleep. </p><p>Slowly, you leaned against Jimin and felt yourself falling deep into the welcoming darkness of unconsciousness.</p><p>* * *</p><p>You woke when the carriage halted suddenly. Bolting upright you turned and looked at Jimin in panic. He wasn\u2019t grey like you worried you\u2019d wake up to. He was pale, but not deathly so. It made your heart relax just a bit, but you weren\u2019t out of the woods yet. </p><p>Jungkook knocked on your door and pulled it open. \u201cLady Y/N, please head inside,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Not taking into account your state of undress you shook your head. \u201cNo, I promised I\u2019d stay with him until he woke up,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>Jungkook sighed and bit his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch Father Jin and Lord Taehyung, see if he\u2019ll wake up!\u201d</p><p>Jungkook was off, heading towards the palace. The guards came rushing over, already in line to gather your husband. You moved to wrap him up in your arms protectively, not wanting anyone to jostle him too much. </p><p>\u201cMy Lady, may we please help secure him to a pram?\u201d one spoke up. You noticed a few guards coming your way with the medical item in hands. </p><p>\u201cPlease be careful of his arm, he\u2019s been shot,\u201d you whispered. You positioned yourself across the carriage and pulled Jimin forwards with his good arm. The guards adjusted and let him ease into their hold on his back. </p><p>Gently, they hoisted him into the air and onto the sling smoothly. One guard offered your their cloak to cover yourself with while another aided you in departing from the carriage. You reached out and grabbed Jimin\u2019s hand, following the guards towards the palace. </p><p>When you got to the main doors they pulled open with an aged sound that made your heart pound in your ears. These were much like the doors the Forsaken had attempted to break down in order to get to you. </p><p>The entire village was decimated\u2026</p><p>To get to you.</p><p>Jimin was shot in the arm\u2026</p><p>That was intended to kill you\u2026</p><p>You wanted to be sick, but there was nothing in your stomach to ease the nausea that plagued you. </p><p>\u201cLady Y/N! Highness!\u201d Taehyung\u2019s soothing voice came out from the corridors. </p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you cried as the older man embraced you. He held your face in his palms and brushed your hair back. </p><p>\u201cI only received Namjoon\u2019s bird an hour ago. The Forsaken truly took the Summer Castle?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cThey did, in the middle of the night\u2026 The village,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>\u201cDo we know if there are any survivors? How large was the group that ambushed you?\u201d Taehyung tried again.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung, she knows nothing. We\u2019ll have to wait for Namjoon if we want any useful information,\u201d Hoseok\u2019s cold voice came around the corner. </p><p>Your heart stopped at the mention of Namjoon\u2026</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t get word from Namjoon,\u201d you whispered, tears falling from your face. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Taehyung asked, rubbing your shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHe-He,\u201d you swallowed thick. \u201cIn order for the Forsaken not to follow our carriage\u2026 He took another towards the Royal Palace. To lead them away from our carriage which Jungkook drove,\u201d you answered. </p><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Taehyung whispered, rubbing his face. </p><p>\u201cYou selfish\u2026 Bitch,\u201d Hoseok growled. Stalking towards you he gripped your throat hard enough to cut off air and shoved you against the brick wall. \u201cThis is all your fault! If you would just fucking end it, then all of those villagers would be alive! Half of my friends and family! My God damned brother! How can anyone be so selfish?!\u201d</p><p>Taehyung grabbed Hoseok\u2019s arms and attempted to pull him off you. </p><p>Your vision was blurring and you heard shouts from the otherside of the room. Suddenly, you were being dropped and you gasped air into your lungs greedily. You coughed and sputtered, trying to get your bearings on the floor. </p><p>\u201cHoseok that is your future Queen! This is treachery of the highest caliber!\u201d Jungkook yelled.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t even supposed to live to be our Queen! She\u2019s supposed to die! Like all of the ones before her have! But here she stands, still alive. While hundreds of innocent lives are killed because of her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about her life!? The only thing she\u2019s done was be born! What choice did she have in any of that!? She didn\u2019t get a choice, Hoseok! So don\u2019t act like she is choosing all of these deaths to happen. This is not her fault,\u201d Jungkook yelled.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s choosing to live even after all the death and destruction that fall in her path. You are all so ignorant. The only reason she is alive now is because Jimin has taken a liking to her. If Jimin hadn\u2019t said something on her behalf, she would be dead by this point,\u201d the assassin sneered. \u201cHe just enjoys the company in his bed at night. A whore to fuck when he\u2019s bored. Isn\u2019t that right, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>You winced on the floor and shook your head. \u201cNo\u2026 That\u2019s not-true,\u201d you rasped. Your throat ached and you knew it was going to bruise if it hadn\u2019t started already.</p><p>\u201cOh, so he doesn\u2019t enjoy your company? You\u2019ve just latched on like a leech and haven\u2019t let go have you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHoseok that is enough!\u201d Taehyung demanded. \u201cThis is my palace, and you are my subordinate! Go to the barracks, Jungkook will deal out your punishment as he sees fit. As head of the Royal Guard I trust your judgement to be pure.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook nodded and took Hoseok by the arm. But before they left Taehyung gripped Hoseok\u2019s Jaw fiercely. \u201cI swear to you, if I see you lay another hand on Lady Y/N, I will kill you myself. Just because you\u2019re marriage was cut short, doesn\u2019t mean everyone else\u2019s has to be either,\u201d Taehyung snarled. </p><p>Jungkook pulled a fuming Hoseok from the room and towards the barracks.</p><p>Taehyung kneeled besides you and helped you sit up against the wall. He tilted your head back and inspected the damage done. He hissed in disapproval and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that he did this to you\u2026 It\u2019s not right, and I won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cHe thinks what he\u2019s doing is best for everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter if one person doesn\u2019t agree with him, or everyone agrees\u2026 He\u2019ll still carry it out\u2026 He wants me dead, Taehyung,\u201d you croaked.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll allow it. Please, don\u2019t let his words infect your mind. You are a good person, and you deserve to have a life. Just because a witch cursed your bloodline doesn\u2019t mean you have to fall victim to that destiny. Because we rule our lives, not somebody else,\u201d Taehyung soothed. </p><p>A cough was heard in the hallway behind you. Taehyung turned to see Father Jin standing there with blood on his hands and robes. His face didn\u2019t seem too panicked. \u201cI finished removing and cleaning the Prince\u2019s wound,\u201d he announced. </p><p>You scrambled to your feet, leaning heavily on Taehyung but wanting to move forward. Jin gasped at your throat no doubt, moving forwards to assess the damage. You pushed away his hands, receiving a quirked brow. \u201cHow is he?\u201d you asked. </p><p>Jin sighed and gave a weak smile. \u201cHe\u2019ll be just fine. He lost a lot of blood, but if we feed him well and let him rest. He\u2019ll be fine soon enough,\u201d he assured. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I see him?\u201d you begged. Jin shook his head with an incredulous laugh. </p><p>\u201cYou also need rest, my Lady,\u201d he reminded. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to do so unless I see him myself. Please, Father, I implore you,\u201d you whimpered. Jin sighed and nodded his head. </p><p>\u201cPlease follow me,\u201d he requested. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the maids prepare a bath and some fresh night clothes. Go see him, and I\u2019ll fetch you later,\u201d Taehyung informed. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said. </p><p>Jin took your arm and lead you towards the back section of the castle. The infirmary was up a few flights of stairs and with Jimin\u2019s condition they didn\u2019t want to jostle him too much. But the infirmary was more for soldiers that could still use their legs. The lower infirmary was smaller, but more accessible for the handicapped warriors. </p><p>Entering through a deep oak door you found Jimin lying in his bed, pale but breathing even.</p><p>Silent tears poured down your face as you crumpled to the floor next to him. Grabbing his good hand you brought it to your lips. \u201cThank the Gods you\u2019re alright,\u201d you whimpered. </p><p>The door behind you shut and you knew Jin had left you for some much needed privacy.</p><p>You throat ached already, but you couldn\u2019t stop the sobs that came from your throat. You didn\u2019t expect your night to go like this. You wanted to be wrapped in your husband\u2019s embrace, body and mind together as you experienced one another bare. </p><p>Kissing his palm you brought his fist under your chin protectively. You wanted to keep him safe, and happy, away from all of this even if just for a night. </p><p>But even that wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>Because you couldn\u2019t help who you were. </p><p>You were his undoing. </p><p>And he was yours\u2026</p>",

Upon your return you felt a chill go down your spine, a sneeze shook your body.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Hurry my darling, we must get you warmed up,&rdquo; he insisted.</p><p>Jimin ensured that you were in the bath and warm before himself. He went to the Roman baths on the ground level of the castle. </p><p>As you soaked in the warm, soapy water, your mind was plagued with the thoughts of your husband&rsquo;s body atop yours. You bit your lip as you thought of Jimin between your legs, the mere thought sent a rush of heat to your core&hellip;</p><p>Jimin was in a similar situation down in the baths.</p><p>However he was much less refrained. Taking his cock in his hand he quickly stroked himself, chasing after his high like a man possessed. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, fuck&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He breathed into the humid air of the large space.</p><p>Adding pressure to his swollen balls sent him spiraling into a thrusting mess.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, Y/N,&rdquo; he whined into the air. Jimin could feel himself getting closer as he thought of your damp body underneath his on the shore. How exquisite you looked to him.</p><p>He came with the thought of your open mouth waiting for his release. Shuddering against the walls of the bath Jimin tried to even out his breathing.</p><p>Each day was turning into torture for him. He just wanted to get closer to you. Perhaps finally get to experience you and your body&hellip;</p><p>But he had to yield. Now wasn&rsquo;t the time, there were much more daunting tasks once you returned to the palace&hellip;</p><p>A coronation. A witch to murder.</p><p>Was there time for the two of you to be intimate in any way? Did Jimin dare get closer, because in the end he might have to deliver the final blow&hellip;</p><p>A knock came on the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Jimin asked, rubbing his body with soap.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me Highness,&rdquo; Jungkook&rsquo;s voice announced through the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; Jimin approved.</p><p>Jungkook entered wearing his civilian clothing, with his cutlass and accessories around his hip. Jimin raised an eyebrow and sat down in the water that was steaming.</p><p>It was beautiful due to the hot springs underneath the palace. Jimin had forgotten how much he loved it here.</p><p>&ldquo;Highness, we are to depart shortly after sunrise. The servants already loaded a majority of your luggage in the carriages. Taehyung sent word there was no disturbances in your absence,&rdquo; Jungkook reported.</p><p>&ldquo;Very good, what of the Royal Palace? Any news from my mother and my father&rsquo;s condition?&rdquo; Jimin asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Your Father is stable, however weak. Your mother states he is determined to meet his grandchild,&rdquo; Jungkook whispered.</p><p>Jimin froze. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to wait&hellip; so will I,&rdquo; Jimin rubbed his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Sire, may we speak as friends. As Jungkook and Jimin instead of Prince and Knight?&rdquo; Jungkook asked, coming over and sitting next to Jimin. The Prince nodded, leaning his head against the chilled marble.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on Kook,&rdquo; Jimin breathed. Jungkook looked at his friend then down at his hands set in his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;Jimin-Hyung, you&rsquo;ve done so much for me in this life I am certain I won&rsquo;t be able to repay in within the four I&rsquo;m granted. But, I do promise that I will fight for you for as long as I can, as hard as I can, as efficiently as I can&hellip; Every knight&rsquo;s dream is not to go into battle, it is to wake up on a day where he is not needed. Because then he has done his job well.&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin frowned then looked to his friend with brows furrowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unsure of what all of this means, Jungkook,&rdquo; Jimin sighed, hunching forward with exhaustion.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying, hyung, that you have time to not be worried about certain things. You are allowed to enjoy yourself and enjoy your life. There is so much more out there than the troubling times ahead. Those moments are not here yet, so don&rsquo;t dwell when there is nothing to dwell upon. There are more important things,&rdquo; Jungkook touching Jimin&rsquo;s shoulder gently. &ldquo;More important people, to create memories with at the moment,&rdquo; Jungkook reminded. </p><p>Jimin thought of you both out at the ocean. How he longed to stay out there with you just one moment longer. He would&rsquo;ve given anything to stay there with you in that moment. </p><p>&ldquo;I appreciate your words Jungkook, they come from your heart of pure gold I know. I will work hard to make memories worth looking back upon in the years to come,&rdquo; he assured. </p><p>Jungkook nodded his head and stood up. &ldquo;I am going to secure the perimeter sire, please rest well,&rdquo; Jungkook bowed before exiting the large room. Jimin felt a chill run down his spine as the cold air touched his back. </p><p>He did want to make memories with you, but only when you were ready&hellip;</p><p>And he wasn&rsquo;t sure he was ready himself&hellip;</p><p>There was only one way to find out&hellip;</p><p>* * *</p><p>You stood out on the balcony in your nightdress, feeling the breeze blow against your warmed skin. </p><p>Jimin had been in the baths for a while.</p><p>You blushed thinking back to your actions on the beach. How Jimin had himself situation between your legs. His body moving against yours with such sinful pleasure that it made your heart falter in your chest. </p><p>There were no doubts in your mind you were attracted to your husband. He was a fine man, from the Royal Lineage there was no questions of his beauty. However, he mentioned his preferences lied with men&hellip;?</p><p>Was this just him trying to create an heir within you?</p><p>Was it all just a ploy so he could do away with you once he had what he wanted?</p><p>No&hellip;</p><p>Jimin wasn&rsquo;t like that, and you knew better. Jimin had stated he wanted to try to be a couple. To rely on one another like couples were supposed to. And he couldn&rsquo;t do that if you weren&rsquo;t ready to carry your load along with his. </p><p>And thinking back to the beach&hellip; Where his strong body was laid out beneath you, completely subject to whatever your thoughts could imagine&hellip;</p><p>It was truly thrilling to think of it that way&hellip;</p><p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.</p><p>You turned and quickly gathered your dressing robe before answering the sound. &ldquo;Yes, who is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Y/N, are you decent?&rdquo; Jimin&rsquo;s voice came through the wood. </p><p>Relaxing you placed your dressing gown back on the chair. &ldquo;Yes, you may enter.&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin walked in with his hair still damp from the baths. He looked refreshed, and much warmer than earlier when you&rsquo;d parted. </p><p>&ldquo;Were the baths pleasant?&rdquo; you asked, sitting down on the trunk at the foot of your bed. Jimin nodded and approached you slowly. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, they were. You&rsquo;ll have to experience them the next we visit. They are supposed to aid in fertility,&rdquo; Jimin stated before sitting next to you. </p><p>You felt your cheeks flush before clearing your throat. &ldquo;I see, then perhaps I should,&rdquo; you squeaked. </p><p>Jimin giggled and you turned your head quickly. You&rsquo;d certainly never heard that sound from him before. Because now that you had, you were certain you&rsquo;d never forget it. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re turning pink, darling,&rdquo; he pointed out. </p><p>You huffed and rubbed your cheeks before standing up. &ldquo;I-It was warm in the baths, nothing more.&rdquo;</p><p>Hurrying out to the balcony you crossed your arms over your chest in frustration. Why did he insist on teasing you on such a delicate matter? Surely the thought terrified him too?</p><p>Or was he merely thinking of the means to procure a royal?</p><p>Footsteps followed your path outside and warm arms encaptured your form. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be cross, my dear, I&rsquo;m only jesting,&rdquo; Jimin whispered in your neck. You bit your lip and shuddered against his form. </p><p>&ldquo;A child is no joking matter,&rdquo; you reminded, firm. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of that, but watching you get flustered at the mention of one surely is means for a slight joke, is it not?&rdquo; Jimin tried again.</p><p>&ldquo;Mocking my purity is not a joke either,&rdquo; you warned. </p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, supposing your purity is kept for much longer,&rdquo; Jimin breathed in your ear. The heat of his breath made your knees wobbly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never do anything you didn&rsquo;t want. But please know that I&rsquo;ll do whatever you ask of me.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning fast you wrapped your arms around his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Then kiss me, like you won&rsquo;t get to do it again,&rdquo; you whimpered. </p><p>All thoughts of preventing an heir, the war you were in, the lives at stake flew from your head the moment Jimin pressed his lips against yours. You were lost to the ocean of his eyes and the solid Earth of his body. </p><p>You wanted more of him. More of his skin against yours and his lips in places you&rsquo;d be too ashamed to ask for. Oh Gods it was everything you could do to stay on your feet. And Jimin seemed to be thinking in a similar fashion. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making it difficult for me to think,&rdquo; he warned, pulling away from your lips. Chest heaving you gripped his shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think, just feel,&rdquo; you begged, placing his hand on your breast. Jimin faltered at the soft sensation your flesh yielded. He swooped down to capture your mouth once more, hand caressing your waist and fondling your chest with fervor. </p><p>You whined against his mouth as he pushed you against the stonework of the palace. Your body had nowhere to move but against his. The foreign sensation between your legs was becoming more prevalent the longer Jimin&rsquo;s hands kept wandering.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I want to go further, I want to shower you in pleasure&hellip; But, this is dangerous my darling,&rdquo; he warned, biting his lip as he rested his forehead against yours. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t risk you falling pregnant&hellip; It&rsquo;s not safe now, not for a child. Not even for us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;D-Don&rsquo;t, um, don&rsquo;t release inside me. I just finished bleeding, I-I shouldn&rsquo;t be fertile for at least a few more moons,&rdquo; you blushed. Jimin raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Even with that, you could still-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to, please Jimin. I-I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; you stuttered.</p><p>Jimin sighed and delicately cradled your face in his hands. The next kiss was delicate and endearing. Pulling you closer Jimin kissed you with such care, it made your heart race with the sensation.</p><p>Here you were, with your husband&hellip; The man you were coming to love, no&hellip;</p><p>The man you were certain you loved. </p><p>And you were going to show him, just how much you loved him. </p><p>Grabbing your waist Jimin moved you off of the wall and towards the open doorway to your bedroom. </p><p>Suddenly, Jimin was shoving you on the ground.</p><p>Hard. </p><p>&ldquo;Ow! Jimin, what did I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;GAH!&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin cried and held his arm tightly. </p><p>Blood poured out of his wound, an arrow protruding from his shoulder. Your heart rate accelerated. </p><p>Your throat began to ache, that&rsquo;s when you realized that you were screaming. Jimin hissed in pain, but reached up and grabbed the arrow, snapping the broad head off. You gasped and held your hands over your mouth, trying to keep the tears at bay. </p><p>Pounding came on your door. </p><p>&ldquo;Highness! Lady Y/N! The Forsaken are surrounding the castle, we must move. NOW!&rdquo; Namjoon&rsquo;s voice yelled. </p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon, Jimin has been shot!&rdquo; you cried, shuffling quickly towards your husband. Jimin kept his head low, obviously in agony. </p><p>&ldquo;Highness!&rdquo; Namjoon shouted, coming in through the doorway and hurrying to his future King. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, get her out of here. She&rsquo;s the one they want,&rdquo; Jimin grit out. </p><p>&ldquo;Highness I can&rsquo;t possibly leave you injured like this,&rdquo; Namjoon defied. </p><p>&ldquo;Jimin I won&rsquo;t leave you here either, don&rsquo;t even think about it,&rdquo; you stated firm. </p><p>Your husband groaned in pain, his arm no doubt on fire from the arrow lodged deep in his muscles. The arms that you just had around your frame. The embrace that made you feel so safe, and cared for. Now stained with blood&hellip;</p><p>Namjoon wrapped his arms around Jimin and lifted him into a standing position. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to move, now. The Forsaken are attempting to storm the castle,&rdquo; he explained. </p><p>Jimin nodded. &ldquo;What of the village, have they been evacuated?&rdquo; Jimin asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; Namjoon started. A dark look passed over his face. &ldquo;The village is already up in flames.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart stuttered in your throat. Surely not. Surely they had gotten out and all they would have to do is rebuild their home. </p><p>That&rsquo;s all they had to do&hellip;</p><p>But you remembered it was late into the night. Everyone would have been sleeping in their beds when the flames started. And if the smoke was too much, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t even have made it from their blankets before they passed. </p><p>Tears blurred your vision as you ran down the stairs after Namjoon and Jimin. Namjoon was barking orders at the guards and watching them begin to make a blockade for the palace entry. </p><p>Loud bangs rung through the hall as you realized that the Forsaken were already at the gates. They were here, and they wanted you dead. </p><p>&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; Namjoon growled. </p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Jimin asked, growing worryingly pale. </p><p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t going to be able to hold them off for long. I need to help them,&rdquo; Namjoon stated. </p><p>&ldquo;Hyung! Highness!&rdquo; Jungkook&rsquo;s voice came over the loud yelling in the hall. </p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook!&rdquo; Jimin said, relieved the younger male was unharmed. </p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, get them to the stables. I&rsquo;ve already sent word to Lord Taehyung about the proceedings. I can buy you some time to escape by leading another carriage towards the Royal Palace&rsquo;s route,&rdquo; Namjoon ordered.</p><p>&ldquo;But Hyung when they catch you,&rdquo; Jungkook whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m aware of my fate here tonight. But, if it means you all can escape to see another sunrise, then that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m prepared to do. Jungkook,&rdquo; Namjoon pulled a medallion from his neck and placed it over Jungkook&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I, Kim Namjoon, place you, Jeon Jungkook as the Head of the Royal Guard for the Kingdom of Arcane. Do you swear to protect the Royal family with your life, Jungkook?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon, I won&rsquo;t allow this!&rdquo; Jimin yelled. </p><p>&ldquo;I swear, on my life I will protect the Royal Family,&rdquo; Jungkook affirmed. </p><p>&ldquo;May the Gods watch over your battles, and I pray one day you will wake up not needed,&rdquo; Namjoon said, resting his forehead against his young friend&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon,&rdquo; Jimin&rsquo;s voice whispered, hoarse from tears. </p><p>&ldquo;You have a Kingdom to rule, Highness. A wife to take care of, and a family to protect. Go on. And if you bare a son, I&rsquo;ve been told Namjoon is a strong name,&rdquo; he smiled brightly. You nodded and then he was off. Weaving in between the guards attempting to hold off the assault. </p><p>&ldquo;We need to go,&rdquo; Jungkook urged, wrapping Jimin&rsquo;s good arm around his neck and leading him down the hallway. </p><p>Your heart was racing as you thought of Namjoon. He was an incredible man, and you&rsquo;d never forget his sacrifice here today. You&rsquo;d ensure that everyone knew of his bravery, his courage&hellip;</p><p>And you&rsquo;d also remember his quirky smiles, the way he would fumble over his words in the presence of Lisa, a handmaid in the Royal palace. You&rsquo;d remember that he had a way with people, and how much he cared for so many people. How dedicated he was to you and Jimin. You would never forget him, and you would always treasure his memories. </p><p>Jimin hobbled along with Jungkook towards the stables, the sounds of the Forsaken outside the castle getting louder and louder. You felt the fear gripping your throat tight, making it harder to breathe. Jimin&rsquo;s arm was still bleeding, and you feared for him. </p><p>If he kept bleeding like that, he wouldn&rsquo;t make it through the night.</p><p>Jungkook brought you into the stables. He handed Jimin over to you and pulled his sword out of it&rsquo;s sheath. You watched as he investigated the surrounding areas. The horses were slightly dazed, but overall they were doing fine. Jungkook let a couple of them out to provide a distraction, leaving one for his own use&hellip;</p><p>And one for Namjoon. </p><p>Finding the older carriage that was meant mainly for transportation of goods, you helped Jimin get in. He huffed and you saw how he was sweating and shaking. His hands were clammy and you felt your gut twist painfully. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, you two stay in here while I hook up the horse. Lady Y/N, see if you can&rsquo;t get the bleeding in his arm to subside. Please, hold on Highness,&rdquo; Jungkook said before shutting the door and latching it. </p><p>Jimin coughed and you frantically turned to your husband, holding his face in your hands. &ldquo;Jimin, please stay with me,&rdquo; you whimpered. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t plan&hellip; on leaving you,&rdquo; he gasped, head arching back in pain. You looked around to see if there was anything in the carriage that could absorb the blood he was letting. As well as something to act as a makeshift tourniquet.</p><p>You looked down at your night dress and quickly began tearing it into strips. Jimin watched as you bit into the delicate fabric and tore it apart for him. Even when he was in pain, he still found you so beautiful&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;This might hurt, but please bear with it,&rdquo; you begged, wrapping the fabric of your dress around his arm and tying it tight. Jimin hissed and bit his lip to try and ease the shock. You continued until you were satisfied and there was much less red staining the bandages. </p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t expecting for you to be tearing your clothes off tonight, I was hoping that would be my job,&rdquo; Jimin joked. You smiled with tears in your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Another time, we have our whole lives,&rdquo; you assured. Jimin coughed and you found his hand and interlocked your fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;If I have to wait my whole life that would be indeed be a shame&hellip; But I&rsquo;d do it for you, my dear,&rdquo; Jimin whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Please, hold on Highness! Lady Y/N!&rdquo; Jungkook&rsquo;s voice shouted.</p><p>Soon the carriage moved and you were off, moving out of the stables and through the dark forest. The horses moved quickly, pulling the carriage along the bumpy path with purpose. </p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to wait your whole life,&rdquo; you smiled, brushing jos damp bangs from his face. </p><p>&ldquo;I was hoping I wouldn&rsquo;t have to wait another night to be with you like this,&rdquo; Jimin stated, looking at your fingers. Stained with his blood and pale in the moonlight. &ldquo;I was hoping that we could just be ourselves for a little while&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t have to be the future King&hellip; You didn&rsquo;t have to be the descendant with death looming over your head. We could just be Y/N and Jimin. Two people who wanted to be together, even if it was just for a night,&rdquo; he rasped. </p><p>&ldquo;We still are those people Jimin, but there are so many other aspects to ourselves than the ones you&rsquo;ve listed. It&rsquo;ll all be alright, but we have to rely on one another. Otherwise, we&rsquo;re dead already,&rdquo; you murmured. </p><p>Jimin nodded, resting his head on your shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of blood,&rdquo; he acknowledged. </p><p>Fear gripped your stomach at the notion of him sleeping. &ldquo;Y-You can&rsquo;t fall asleep, you might not wake up,&rdquo; you cried, holding his cheek in your palm. Jimin smiled and shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I will wake up, because I know that you&rsquo;ll be right there for me when I wake. I long to see that,&rdquo; he promised. </p><p>&ldquo;You better wake again, or I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself,&rdquo; you urged. Jimin nodded and rested his head once more in the crook of your neck. </p><p>Once his breathing began to even out, you felt your own eyes falling low.</p><p>All of the adrenaline from the past few hours had ran its course, leaving you feeling like a husk. Devoid of any emotion but the desire for sleep. </p><p>Slowly, you leaned against Jimin and felt yourself falling deep into the welcoming darkness of unconsciousness.</p><p>* * *</p><p>You woke when the carriage halted suddenly. Bolting upright you turned and looked at Jimin in panic. He wasn&rsquo;t grey like you worried you&rsquo;d wake up to. He was pale, but not deathly so. It made your heart relax just a bit, but you weren&rsquo;t out of the woods yet. </p><p>Jungkook knocked on your door and pulled it open. &ldquo;Lady Y/N, please head inside,&rdquo; he urged.</p><p>Not taking into account your state of undress you shook your head. &ldquo;No, I promised I&rsquo;d stay with him until he woke up,&rdquo; you whimpered. </p><p>Jungkook sighed and bit his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch Father Jin and Lord Taehyung, see if he&rsquo;ll wake up!&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook was off, heading towards the palace. The guards came rushing over, already in line to gather your husband. You moved to wrap him up in your arms protectively, not wanting anyone to jostle him too much. </p><p>&ldquo;My Lady, may we please help secure him to a pram?&rdquo; one spoke up. You noticed a few guards coming your way with the medical item in hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Please be careful of his arm, he&rsquo;s been shot,&rdquo; you whispered. You positioned yourself across the carriage and pulled Jimin forwards with his good arm. The guards adjusted and let him ease into their hold on his back. </p><p>Gently, they hoisted him into the air and onto the sling smoothly. One guard offered your their cloak to cover yourself with while another aided you in departing from the carriage. You reached out and grabbed Jimin&rsquo;s hand, following the guards towards the palace. </p><p>When you got to the main doors they pulled open with an aged sound that made your heart pound in your ears. These were much like the doors the Forsaken had attempted to break down in order to get to you. </p><p>The entire village was decimated&hellip;</p><p>To get to you.</p><p>Jimin was shot in the arm&hellip;</p><p>That was intended to kill you&hellip;</p><p>You wanted to be sick, but there was nothing in your stomach to ease the nausea that plagued you. </p><p>&ldquo;Lady Y/N! Highness!&rdquo; Taehyung&rsquo;s soothing voice came out from the corridors. </p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung!&rdquo; you cried as the older man embraced you. He held your face in his palms and brushed your hair back. </p><p>&ldquo;I only received Namjoon&rsquo;s bird an hour ago. The Forsaken truly took the Summer Castle?&rdquo; Taehyung asked.</p><p>&ldquo;They did, in the middle of the night&hellip; The village,&rdquo; you whimpered. </p><p>&ldquo;Do we know if there are any survivors? How large was the group that ambushed you?&rdquo; Taehyung tried again.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung, she knows nothing. We&rsquo;ll have to wait for Namjoon if we want any useful information,&rdquo; Hoseok&rsquo;s cold voice came around the corner. </p><p>Your heart stopped at the mention of Namjoon&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t get word from Namjoon,&rdquo; you whispered, tears falling from your face. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Taehyung asked, rubbing your shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;He-He,&rdquo; you swallowed thick. &ldquo;In order for the Forsaken not to follow our carriage&hellip; He took another towards the Royal Palace. To lead them away from our carriage which Jungkook drove,&rdquo; you answered. </p><p>&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo; Taehyung whispered, rubbing his face. </p><p>&ldquo;You selfish&hellip; Bitch,&rdquo; Hoseok growled. Stalking towards you he gripped your throat hard enough to cut off air and shoved you against the brick wall. &ldquo;This is all your fault! If you would just fucking end it, then all of those villagers would be alive! Half of my friends and family! My God damned brother! How can anyone be so selfish?!&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung grabbed Hoseok&rsquo;s arms and attempted to pull him off you. </p><p>Your vision was blurring and you heard shouts from the otherside of the room. Suddenly, you were being dropped and you gasped air into your lungs greedily. You coughed and sputtered, trying to get your bearings on the floor. </p><p>&ldquo;Hoseok that is your future Queen! This is treachery of the highest caliber!&rdquo; Jungkook yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t even supposed to live to be our Queen! She&rsquo;s supposed to die! Like all of the ones before her have! But here she stands, still alive. While hundreds of innocent lives are killed because of her!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever thought about her life!? The only thing she&rsquo;s done was be born! What choice did she have in any of that!? She didn&rsquo;t get a choice, Hoseok! So don&rsquo;t act like she is choosing all of these deaths to happen. This is not her fault,&rdquo; Jungkook yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s choosing to live even after all the death and destruction that fall in her path. You are all so ignorant. The only reason she is alive now is because Jimin has taken a liking to her. If Jimin hadn&rsquo;t said something on her behalf, she would be dead by this point,&rdquo; the assassin sneered. &ldquo;He just enjoys the company in his bed at night. A whore to fuck when he&rsquo;s bored. Isn&rsquo;t that right, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>You winced on the floor and shook your head. &ldquo;No&hellip; That&rsquo;s not-true,&rdquo; you rasped. Your throat ached and you knew it was going to bruise if it hadn&rsquo;t started already.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so he doesn&rsquo;t enjoy your company? You&rsquo;ve just latched on like a leech and haven&rsquo;t let go have you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hoseok that is enough!&rdquo; Taehyung demanded. &ldquo;This is my palace, and you are my subordinate! Go to the barracks, Jungkook will deal out your punishment as he sees fit. As head of the Royal Guard I trust your judgement to be pure.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook nodded and took Hoseok by the arm. But before they left Taehyung gripped Hoseok&rsquo;s Jaw fiercely. &ldquo;I swear to you, if I see you lay another hand on Lady Y/N, I will kill you myself. Just because you&rsquo;re marriage was cut short, doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone else&rsquo;s has to be either,&rdquo; Taehyung snarled. </p><p>Jungkook pulled a fuming Hoseok from the room and towards the barracks.</p><p>Taehyung kneeled besides you and helped you sit up against the wall. He tilted your head back and inspected the damage done. He hissed in disapproval and shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry that he did this to you&hellip; It&rsquo;s not right, and I won&rsquo;t stand for it.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;He thinks what he&rsquo;s doing is best for everyone. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if one person doesn&rsquo;t agree with him, or everyone agrees&hellip; He&rsquo;ll still carry it out&hellip; He wants me dead, Taehyung,&rdquo; you croaked.</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll allow it. Please, don&rsquo;t let his words infect your mind. You are a good person, and you deserve to have a life. Just because a witch cursed your bloodline doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to fall victim to that destiny. Because we rule our lives, not somebody else,&rdquo; Taehyung soothed. </p><p>A cough was heard in the hallway behind you. Taehyung turned to see Father Jin standing there with blood on his hands and robes. His face didn&rsquo;t seem too panicked. &ldquo;I finished removing and cleaning the Prince&rsquo;s wound,&rdquo; he announced. </p><p>You scrambled to your feet, leaning heavily on Taehyung but wanting to move forward. Jin gasped at your throat no doubt, moving forwards to assess the damage. You pushed away his hands, receiving a quirked brow. &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; you asked. </p><p>Jin sighed and gave a weak smile. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be just fine. He lost a lot of blood, but if we feed him well and let him rest. He&rsquo;ll be fine soon enough,&rdquo; he assured. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I see him?&rdquo; you begged. Jin shook his head with an incredulous laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;You also need rest, my Lady,&rdquo; he reminded. </p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be able to do so unless I see him myself. Please, Father, I implore you,&rdquo; you whimpered. Jin sighed and nodded his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Please follow me,&rdquo; he requested. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the maids prepare a bath and some fresh night clothes. Go see him, and I&rsquo;ll fetch you later,&rdquo; Taehyung informed. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you said. </p><p>Jin took your arm and lead you towards the back section of the castle. The infirmary was up a few flights of stairs and with Jimin&rsquo;s condition they didn&rsquo;t want to jostle him too much. But the infirmary was more for soldiers that could still use their legs. The lower infirmary was smaller, but more accessible for the handicapped warriors. </p><p>Entering through a deep oak door you found Jimin lying in his bed, pale but breathing even.</p><p>Silent tears poured down your face as you crumpled to the floor next to him. Grabbing his good hand you brought it to your lips. &ldquo;Thank the Gods you&rsquo;re alright,&rdquo; you whimpered. </p><p>The door behind you shut and you knew Jin had left you for some much needed privacy.</p><p>You throat ached already, but you couldn&rsquo;t stop the sobs that came from your throat. You didn&rsquo;t expect your night to go like this. You wanted to be wrapped in your husband&rsquo;s embrace, body and mind together as you experienced one another bare. </p><p>Kissing his palm you brought his fist under your chin protectively. You wanted to keep him safe, and happy, away from all of this even if just for a night. </p><p>But even that wasn&rsquo;t possible.</p><p>Because you couldn&rsquo;t help who you were. </p><p>You were his undoing. </p><p>And he was yours&hellip;</p>",
