They slip through the dark into a back street and then Sansa loses track of where they are or where they\u2019re going, all the streets blending together into a dark maze. A few minutes of the wind whipping her hair and Jon pulls her to stop a next to a darkened park. \u201cThis should be good,\u201d he says, barely breathing hard. \u201cWho was your ride?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a playground just inside the park, and Sansa slumps to a seat on one of the empty swings, curls her fingers around the frigid and dusty chains. \u201cMargaery.

Calling Lysa for a ride isn\u2019t an option even in the best of circumstances much less late at night to be picked up from an abandoned park, but she doesn\u2019t want to admit that to Jon, doesn\u2019t want to do anything to look more pathetic than she already has. <i>I can text one of my friends</i>, she thinks of offering, but that would be a lie. She\u2019d had people she thought were friends in her old life, but they\u2019d all shriveled up and disappeared after she could no longer keep up with their lifestyle, and she knows better than to think the people she goes to school with here are her friends.</p><p>She looks up and realizes Jon is watching her in the quiet, careful way he had outside Margaery\u2019s house, like she\u2019s a bird with a broken wing. Sansa tears her gaze away, a cold knot clenched in her gut. After Joffrey she\u2019d sworn she would never do this again, never let anyone see her like this. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to take care of me,\u201d she blurts. \u201cI can get one of my friends to give me a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Robb would\u2019ve killed me if-\u201d A muscle twitches in Jon\u2019s jaw and he shakes his head. He pulls his phone from his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. Theon was my ride, I\u2019ll get him to come pick us up.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nods, but a lump\u2019s risen to her throat at Robb\u2019s name, and it refuses to bob back down as Jon takes the swing next to her, hands thrust into his pockets. Cold minute after cold minute ticks by without Jon\u2019s phone chirping until Sansa doesn\u2019t think she can stand it any longer. She wraps her arms around herself, shoves her hands into her armpits. \u201cHave you talked to Bran?\u201d She asks without looking at him.</p><p>Jon is silent a long moment. \u201cNot for awhile,\u201d he finally answers. \u201cI wanted to see him more, you know after, but-\u201d a rustling sound like he&rsquo;s shaking his head. \u201cCatelyn isn&rsquo;t the biggest fan of mine.\u201d</p><p>Sansa remembers that about the funeral at least: the way Arya had clung to Jon with his sling the whole time and the way her mother had watched him coldly, silently judging, silently asking why he\u2019d been the one to survive. She\u2019d never liked Jon. Maybe that was why Sansa had never liked him either. She\u2019d wanted so desperately to be like her mother when she was young; Catelyn who was effortlessly graceful always. Idly, Sansa wonders when that stopped, when she turned into the girl who goes to parties and gets tipsy on schnapps so she won\u2019t feel nauseous when guys grind up against her on the dance floor, who ends up in an abandoned park at midnight with a stranger.</p><p><i>Not a stranger. Jon.</i></p><p>Jon slips his phone out to check it, mutters a particularly imaginative combination of four letter words, and stands up. \u201cMy place is about a mile from here,\u201d he says, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cWe can wait there, if you want. I think Theon found a girl so it may be a bit.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nods mutely, too cold to do more, and stands. They leave the park behind, streetlights flooding the sidewalk in pools of yellow halogen light. Though not the highest heels she owns, Sansa\u2019s feet ache almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d she tells Jon after a few minutes. She reaches up and grabs his shoulder, and maybe it\u2019s the last hurrah of schnapps left in her veins, but she can\u2019t help but notice how muscled it is, the way his tendons shift under her fingers as he reaches a hand to steady her. And she can\u2019t help but notice the way his eyes slide to her chest as she does and the way the platter of her cleavage jiggles as she balances on one foot and then the other to slip off her heels.</p><p>\u201cAll good?\u201d Jon asks with a faint smile, eyes flicking guiltily back to her face.</p><p>\u201cAll good,\u201d she agrees with a smile of own, heels dangling from her fingers.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>It take maybe another ten minutes of walking to reach Jon\u2019s apartment. Jon fumbles with his keys when they reach the stairwell, then pulls open the door and holds it open for her. It\u2019s too dark to see anything inside until Jon hit a few switches on the wall and light flickers on to show a small but relatively neat apartment, a third of the space taken up by a kitchenette and island.</p><p>Sansa uncrosses her arms and rubs her hands together as Jon moves to the thermostat on the opposite wall. She starts wandering around as he fiddles with it. \u201cSorry,\u201d Jon mutters. A second later a gust of hot air rattles the vent overhead. \u201cIt\u2019ll heat up soon.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nods absentmindedly, only half listening, still taking in the small space. Outside of the kitchenette there\u2019s a vaguely second hand couch, a nicked and dented coffee table, a flatscreen on the far wall, and Theon&rsquo;s Iron Island band posters plastered across the walls. It\u2019s a guy\u2019s setup: clean enough to invite girls over to, but no real thought in any of the details. But that wasn\u2019t fair: was her room at Lysa\u2019s really any different? Even after a year it still feels empty and strange, not truly hers. Her room is back in the old house, lying on her stomach scribbling in her diary on her bed or standing on the tips of his toes in front of her mirror to do her makeup before school.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not a lot,\u201d Jon rubs the back of his neck as he watches her wander around the room, \u201cbut it\u2019s close to Castle Black. Saves me having to drive a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not judging.\u201d Sansa forces a laugh. \u201cMy Berkeley plan died about the same time as my college fund dried up.\u201d</p><p>Jon is silent as she finishes wandering around the room. \u201cWhat happened with that?\u201d He asks as she circles back to where she started. \u201cI heard some of it from Arya, but you know how she is with&hellip; details.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bites her lip. She glances at the door beside where Jon leans against the wall, because if she looks at him something in her will crack and break and, though she doesn\u2019t know why, of everyone in the world in this moment she doesn\u2019t want Jon to see that. \u201cIs that your room?\u201d</p><p>He nods silently, and she crosses the room, pushes the door open and slips inside still without looking at him. The space inside is maybe a quarter the size of the pink and pastel blue one she\u2019d had back in Winterfell, his bed taking up a majority of the floor. There\u2019s a half open closet next to it, and on the wall are thumbtacked a few of the weird drawings Arya instagrams sometimes.</p><p>Something about them makes Sansa tired and her chest ache, and she folds her legs under her and sinks to the floor at the foot of Jon\u2019s bed, cool wood knuckling into her back. Jon goes to flip the light on, then pauses. Out of the side of her eye she sees him let his arm drop, and he moves to the foot of the bed. She feels more than sees him slide down to the carpet beside her, legs drawn up to fit in the narrow space between bed and wall.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d she says, still not looking at him. He hesitates, then offers it, and Sansa draws it to her lap. It\u2019s warm and solid, calluses rasping lightly against the tips of her fingers as she ghosts them over his palm. \u201cWhat did Arya tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat your dad had been floating money for his business partner. Baratheon, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert Baratheon.\u201d She traces the half circle running from his wrist to above his thumb. It\u2019s easier than looking up. \u201cAfter the crash\u2026\u201d</p><p>And sitting with his shoulder touching hers and his hand in her lap, Sansa tells him. Tells him how when her mother had needed the money back Robert hadn\u2019t had it, how after the feds shut him down it meant they were never getting any of it back, how it had taken selling the house and cashing in her father\u2019s life insurance and every cent they had invested just to cover the clients Robert cheated, how even that had barely been enough to keep them from being sued.</p><p>And once she\u2019s started Sansa finds she can\u2019t stop: she tells him about how even though he\u2019d survived the crash Bran\u2019s medical bills had drained their savings dry, how her mother had gone back to work only to find she didn\u2019t make enough to cover them, how Arya had almost been expelled from school for getting in fights, how every friend Sansa thought she\u2019d had disappeared like smoke once she couldn\u2019t keep up with their clothes and shoes and purses, how she\u2019d stayed for so long with Joffrey before breaking up because she didn\u2019t know who she was without him, how she\u2019d had to move in with Lysa just so she could have a shot at the Vale High transfer scholarship and a decent college.</p><p>Jon listens through it all without speaking, a solid presence beside her, hand callused and warm. When the words have finally run dry he touches her knee. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, voice soft and hoarse. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I should\u2019ve been there. But after the crash, with your mom and Bran- I didn\u2019t feel like it was my place-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s ok.\u201d Sansa gives him a smile; sad and small, but it\u2019s the last she has. \u201cYou were there for Arya. I don\u2019t think she could have gotten through it without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but&hellip;\u201d Jon\u2019s jaw works silently. \u201cSomeone should have been there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI managed.\u201d Sansa looks back down at his palm. It is isn\u2019t fair for her to do it, not when they were never close, not when he\u2019s just being kind (and Jon has always been kind, even if she never bothered to notice), but Sansa pulls his arm over her shoulders and shifts so she fits in the crook of his side. \u201cI always manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d He starts, and Sansa thinks his voice may be the saddest thing she\u2019s ever heard. She shakes her head into his shoulder before he can say more. She\u2019s snug and safe, snug and safe for the first time in a long time and she doesn\u2019t want to give that up for something that is dead and gone. They aren\u2019t friends, she knows that, she does, but-</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says softly, \u201ccan we just sit for a little?\u201d</p><p>Jon is still a long moment, then nods into her hair and pulls her closer.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16590095/chapters/38968799#workskin\" target=\"_blank\">A03 Link</a></p>",

After Joffrey she\u2019d sworn she would never do this again, never let anyone see her like this. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to take care of me,\u201d she blurts. \u201cI can get one of my friends to give me a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Robb would\u2019ve killed me if-\u201d A muscle twitches in Jon\u2019s jaw and he shakes his head. He pulls his phone from his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. Theon was my ride, I\u2019ll get him to come pick us up.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nods, but a lump\u2019s risen to her throat at Robb\u2019s name, and it refuses to bob back down as Jon takes the swing next to her, hands thrust into his pockets. Cold minute after cold minute ticks by without Jon\u2019s phone chirping until Sansa doesn\u2019t think she can stand it any longer. She wraps her arms around herself, shoves her hands into her armpits. \u201cHave you talked to Bran?\u201d She asks without looking at him.</p><p>Jon is silent a long moment. \u201cNot for awhile,\u201d he finally answers. \u201cI wanted to see him more, you know after, but-\u201d a rustling sound like he\u2019s shaking his head. \u201cCatelyn isn\u2019t the biggest fan of mine.\u201d</p><p>Sansa remembers that about the funeral at least: the way Arya had clung to Jon with his sling the whole time and the way her mother had watched him coldly, silently judging, silently asking why he\u2019d been the one to survive. She\u2019d never liked Jon. Maybe that was why Sansa had never liked him either. She\u2019d wanted so desperately to be like her mother when she was young; Catelyn who was effortlessly graceful always. Idly, Sansa wonders when that stopped, when she turned into the girl who goes to parties and gets tipsy on schnapps so she won\u2019t feel nauseous when guys grind up against her on the dance floor, who ends up in an abandoned park at midnight with a stranger.</p><p><i>Not a stranger. Jon.</i></p><p>Jon slips his phone out to check it, mutters a particularly imaginative combination of four letter words, and stands up. \u201cMy place is about a mile from here,\u201d he says, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cWe can wait there, if you want. I think Theon found a girl so it may be a bit.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nods mutely, too cold to do more, and stands. They leave the park behind, streetlights flooding the sidewalk in pools of yellow halogen light. Though not the highest heels she owns, Sansa\u2019s feet ache almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d she tells Jon after a few minutes. She reaches up and grabs his shoulder, and maybe it\u2019s the last hurrah of schnapps left in her veins, but she can\u2019t help but notice how muscled it is, the way his tendons shift under her fingers as he reaches a hand to steady her. And she can\u2019t help but notice the way his eyes slide to her chest as she does and the way the platter of her cleavage jiggles as she balances on one foot and then the other to slip off her heels.</p><p>\u201cAll good?\u201d Jon asks with a faint smile, eyes flicking guiltily back to her face.</p><p>\u201cAll good,\u201d she agrees with a smile of own, heels dangling from her fingers.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>It take maybe another ten minutes of walking to reach Jon\u2019s apartment. Jon fumbles with his keys when they reach the stairwell, then pulls open the door and holds it open for her. It\u2019s too dark to see anything inside until Jon hit a few switches on the wall and light flickers on to show a small but relatively neat apartment, a third of the space taken up by a kitchenette and island.</p><p>Sansa uncrosses her arms and rubs her hands together as Jon moves to the thermostat on the opposite wall. She starts wandering around as he fiddles with it. \u201cSorry,\u201d Jon mutters. A second later a gust of hot air rattles the vent overhead. \u201cIt\u2019ll heat up soon.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nods absentmindedly, only half listening, still taking in the small space. Outside of the kitchenette there\u2019s a vaguely second hand couch, a nicked and dented coffee table, a flatscreen on the far wall, and Theon\u2019s Iron Island band posters plastered across the walls. It\u2019s a guy\u2019s setup: clean enough to invite girls over to, but no real thought in any of the details. But that wasn\u2019t fair: was her room at Lysa\u2019s really any different? Even after a year it still feels empty and strange, not truly hers. Her room is back in the old house, lying on her stomach scribbling in her diary on her bed or standing on the tips of his toes in front of her mirror to do her makeup before school.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not a lot,\u201d Jon rubs the back of his neck as he watches her wander around the room, \u201cbut it\u2019s close to Castle Black. Saves me having to drive a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not judging.\u201d Sansa forces a laugh. \u201cMy Berkeley plan died about the same time as my college fund dried up.\u201d</p><p>Jon is silent as she finishes wandering around the room. \u201cWhat happened with that?\u201d He asks as she circles back to where she started. \u201cI heard some of it from Arya, but you know how she is with\u2026 details.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bites her lip. She glances at the door beside where Jon leans against the wall, because if she looks at him something in her will crack and break and, though she doesn\u2019t know why, of everyone in the world in this moment she doesn\u2019t want Jon to see that. \u201cIs that your room?\u201d</p><p>He nods silently, and she crosses the room, pushes the door open and slips inside still without looking at him. The space inside is maybe a quarter the size of the pink and pastel blue one she\u2019d had back in Winterfell, his bed taking up a majority of the floor. There\u2019s a half open closet next to it, and on the wall are thumbtacked a few of the weird drawings Arya instagrams sometimes.</p><p>Something about them makes Sansa tired and her chest ache, and she folds her legs under her and sinks to the floor at the foot of Jon\u2019s bed, cool wood knuckling into her back. Jon goes to flip the light on, then pauses. Out of the side of her eye she sees him let his arm drop, and he moves to the foot of the bed. She feels more than sees him slide down to the carpet beside her, legs drawn up to fit in the narrow space between bed and wall.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d she says, still not looking at him. He hesitates, then offers it, and Sansa draws it to her lap. It\u2019s warm and solid, calluses rasping lightly against the tips of her fingers as she ghosts them over his palm. \u201cWhat did Arya tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat your dad had been floating money for his business partner. Baratheon, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert Baratheon.\u201d She traces the half circle running from his wrist to above his thumb. It\u2019s easier than looking up. \u201cAfter the crash\u2026\u201d</p><p>And sitting with his shoulder touching hers and his hand in her lap, Sansa tells him. Tells him how when her mother had needed the money back Robert hadn\u2019t had it, how after the feds shut him down it meant they were never getting any of it back, how it had taken selling the house and cashing in her father\u2019s life insurance and every cent they had invested just to cover the clients Robert cheated, how even that had barely been enough to keep them from being sued.</p><p>And once she\u2019s started Sansa finds she can\u2019t stop: she tells him about how even though he\u2019d survived the crash Bran\u2019s medical bills had drained their savings dry, how her mother had gone back to work only to find she didn\u2019t make enough to cover them, how Arya had almost been expelled from school for getting in fights, how every friend Sansa thought she\u2019d had disappeared like smoke once she couldn\u2019t keep up with their clothes and shoes and purses, how she\u2019d stayed for so long with Joffrey before breaking up because she didn\u2019t know who she was without him, how she\u2019d had to move in with Lysa just so she could have a shot at the Vale High transfer scholarship and a decent college.</p><p>Jon listens through it all without speaking, a solid presence beside her, hand callused and warm. When the words have finally run dry he touches her knee. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, voice soft and hoarse. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I should\u2019ve been there. But after the crash, with your mom and Bran- I didn\u2019t feel like it was my place-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s ok.\u201d Sansa gives him a smile; sad and small, but it\u2019s the last she has. \u201cYou were there for Arya. I don\u2019t think she could have gotten through it without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d Jon\u2019s jaw works silently. \u201cSomeone should have been there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI managed.\u201d Sansa looks back down at his palm. It is isn\u2019t fair for her to do it, not when they were never close, not when he\u2019s just being kind (and Jon has always been kind, even if she never bothered to notice), but Sansa pulls his arm over her shoulders and shifts so she fits in the crook of his side. \u201cI always manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d He starts, and Sansa thinks his voice may be the saddest thing she\u2019s ever heard. She shakes her head into his shoulder before he can say more. She\u2019s snug and safe, snug and safe for the first time in a long time and she doesn\u2019t want to give that up for something that is dead and gone. They aren\u2019t friends, she knows that, she does, but-</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she says softly, \u201ccan we just sit for a little?\u201d</p><p>Jon is still a long moment, then nods into her hair and pulls her closer.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16590095/chapters/38968799#workskin\" target=\"_blank\">A03 Link</a></p>",

After Joffrey she\u2019d sworn she would never do this again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to take care of me,\u201d she blurts. \u201cI can get one of my friends to give me a ride.\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>Jon takes off in the opposite direction from the other kids, back along the house and a gate that opens up into a neighbor\u2019s side yard, Sansa stumbling after him. They slip through the dark into a back street and then Sansa loses track of where they are or where they\u2019re going, all the streets blending together into a dark maze. A few minutes of the wind whipping her hair and Jon pulls her to stop a next to a darkened park. \u201cThis should be good,\u201d he says, barely breathing hard. \u201cWho was your ride?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a playground just inside the park, and Sansa slumps to a seat on one of the empty swings, curls her fingers around the frigid and dusty chains. \u201cMargaery. But that was her house.\u201d</p><p>Jon stuffs his hands in his pockets against the cold. His breath mists the air. \u201cArya said you\u2019re staying with your aunt. What about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I was spending the night at Margaery\u2019s.\u201d The cold has peeled away some of the peach schnapps\u2019 tingling warmth, and Sansa finds herself missing it desperately. Calling Lysa for a ride isn\u2019t an option even in the best of circumstances much less late at night to be picked up from an abandoned park, but she doesn\u2019t want to admit that to Jon, doesn\u2019t want to do anything to look more pathetic than she already has. <i>I can text one of my friends</i>, she thinks of offering, but that would be a lie. She\u2019d had people she thought were friends in her old life, but they\u2019d all shriveled up and disappeared after she could no longer keep up with their lifestyle, and she knows better than to think the people she goes to school with here are her friends.</p><p>She looks up and realizes Jon is watching her in the quiet, careful way he had outside Margaery\u2019s house, like she\u2019s a bird with a broken wing.

                "content": "<p>Jon x Sansa -<i> Tipsy high school Sansa in a red push up bra. What could go wrong? /&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/180054405030/fic-tipsy-in-a-push-bra-pt-1\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a></p><hr /><p>Sansa looks up and realizes Jon is watching her in the quiet, careful way he had outside Margaery&rsquo;s house, like she&rsquo;s a bird with a broken wing. She tears her gaze away, a cold knot clenched in her gut. After Joffrey she&rsquo;d sworn she would never do this again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to take care of me,&rdquo; she blurts. &ldquo;I can get one of my friends to give me a ride.&rdquo;<br /></p><hr /><p>Jon takes off in the opposite direction from the other kids, back along the house and a gate that opens up into a neighbor&rsquo;s side yard, Sansa stumbling after him. They slip through the dark into a back street and then Sansa loses track of where they are or where they&rsquo;re going, all the streets blending together into a dark maze. A few minutes of the wind whipping her hair and Jon pulls her to stop a next to a darkened park. &ldquo;This should be good,&rdquo; he says, barely breathing hard. &ldquo;Who was your ride?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a playground just inside the park, and Sansa slumps to a seat on one of the empty swings, curls her fingers around the frigid and dusty chains. &ldquo;Margaery. But that was her house.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon stuffs his hands in his pockets against the cold. His breath mists the air. &ldquo;Arya said you&rsquo;re staying with your aunt. What about her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told her I was spending the night at Margaery&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The cold has peeled away some of the peach schnapps&rsquo; tingling warmth, and Sansa finds herself missing it desperately. Calling Lysa for a ride isn&rsquo;t an option even in the best of circumstances much less late at night to be picked up from an abandoned park, but she doesn&rsquo;t want to admit that to Jon, doesn&rsquo;t want to do anything to look more pathetic than she already has. <i>I can text one of my friends</i>, she thinks of offering, but that would be a lie. She&rsquo;d had people she thought were friends in her old life, but they&rsquo;d all shriveled up and disappeared after she could no longer keep up with their lifestyle, and she knows better than to think the people she goes to school with here are her friends.</p><p>She looks up and realizes Jon is watching her in the quiet, careful way he had outside Margaery&rsquo;s house, like she&rsquo;s a bird with a broken wing. Sansa tears her gaze away, a cold knot clenched in her gut. After Joffrey she&rsquo;d sworn she would never do this again, never let anyone see her like this. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to take care of me,&rdquo; she blurts. &ldquo;I can get one of my friends to give me a ride.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Robb would&rsquo;ve killed me if-&rdquo; A muscle twitches in Jon&rsquo;s jaw and he shakes his head. He pulls his phone from his pocket. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a problem. Theon was my ride, I&rsquo;ll get him to come pick us up.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa nods, but a lump&rsquo;s risen to her throat at Robb&rsquo;s name, and it refuses to bob back down as Jon takes the swing next to her, hands thrust into his pockets. Cold minute after cold minute ticks by without Jon&rsquo;s phone chirping until Sansa doesn&rsquo;t think she can stand it any longer. She wraps her arms around herself, shoves her hands into her armpits. &ldquo;Have you talked to Bran?&rdquo; She asks without looking at him.</p><p>Jon is silent a long moment. &ldquo;Not for awhile,&rdquo; he finally answers. &ldquo;I wanted to see him more, you know after, but-&rdquo; a rustling sound like he&rsquo;s shaking his head. &ldquo;Catelyn isn&rsquo;t the biggest fan of mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa remembers that about the funeral at least: the way Arya had clung to Jon with his sling the whole time and the way her mother had watched him coldly, silently judging, silently asking why he&rsquo;d been the one to survive. She&rsquo;d never liked Jon. Maybe that was why Sansa had never liked him either. She&rsquo;d wanted so desperately to be like her mother when she was young; Catelyn who was effortlessly graceful always. Idly, Sansa wonders when that stopped, when she turned into the girl who goes to parties and gets tipsy on schnapps so she won&rsquo;t feel nauseous when guys grind up against her on the dance floor, who ends up in an abandoned park at midnight with a stranger.</p><p><i>Not a stranger. Jon.</i></p><p>Jon slips his phone out to check it, mutters a particularly imaginative combination of four letter words, and stands up. &ldquo;My place is about a mile from here,&rdquo; he says, running his fingers through his hair. &ldquo;We can wait there, if you want. I think Theon found a girl so it may be a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa nods mutely, too cold to do more, and stands. They leave the park behind, streetlights flooding the sidewalk in pools of yellow halogen light. Though not the highest heels she owns, Sansa&rsquo;s feet ache almost immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold up,&rdquo; she tells Jon after a few minutes. She reaches up and grabs his shoulder, and maybe it&rsquo;s the last hurrah of schnapps left in her veins, but she can&rsquo;t help but notice how muscled it is, the way his tendons shift under her fingers as he reaches a hand to steady her. And she can&rsquo;t help but notice the way his eyes slide to her chest as she does and the way the platter of her cleavage jiggles as she balances on one foot and then the other to slip off her heels.</p><p>&ldquo;All good?&rdquo; Jon asks with a faint smile, eyes flicking guiltily back to her face.</p><p>&ldquo;All good,&rdquo; she agrees with a smile of own, heels dangling from her fingers.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>It take maybe another ten minutes of walking to reach Jon&rsquo;s apartment. Jon fumbles with his keys when they reach the stairwell, then pulls open the door and holds it open for her. It&rsquo;s too dark to see anything inside until Jon hit a few switches on the wall and light flickers on to show a small but relatively neat apartment, a third of the space taken up by a kitchenette and island.</p><p>Sansa uncrosses her arms and rubs her hands together as Jon moves to the thermostat on the opposite wall. She starts wandering around as he fiddles with it. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Jon mutters. A second later a gust of hot air rattles the vent overhead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll heat up soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa nods absentmindedly, only half listening, still taking in the small space. Outside of the kitchenette there&rsquo;s a vaguely second hand couch, a nicked and dented coffee table, a flatscreen on the far wall, and Theon&rsquo;s Iron Island band posters plastered across the walls. It&rsquo;s a guy&rsquo;s setup: clean enough to invite girls over to, but no real thought in any of the details. But that wasn&rsquo;t fair: was her room at Lysa&rsquo;s really any different? Even after a year it still feels empty and strange, not truly hers. Her room is back in the old house, lying on her stomach scribbling in her diary on her bed or standing on the tips of his toes in front of her mirror to do her makeup before school.</p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not a lot,&rdquo; Jon rubs the back of his neck as he watches her wander around the room, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s close to Castle Black. Saves me having to drive a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not judging.&rdquo; Sansa forces a laugh. &ldquo;My Berkeley plan died about the same time as my college fund dried up.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon is silent as she finishes wandering around the room. &ldquo;What happened with that?&rdquo; He asks as she circles back to where she started. &ldquo;I heard some of it from Arya, but you know how she is with&hellip; details.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa bites her lip. She glances at the door beside where Jon leans against the wall, because if she looks at him something in her will crack and break and, though she doesn&rsquo;t know why, of everyone in the world in this moment she doesn&rsquo;t want Jon to see that. &ldquo;Is that your room?&rdquo;</p><p>He nods silently, and she crosses the room, pushes the door open and slips inside still without looking at him. The space inside is maybe a quarter the size of the pink and pastel blue one she&rsquo;d had back in Winterfell, his bed taking up a majority of the floor. There&rsquo;s a half open closet next to it, and on the wall are thumbtacked a few of the weird drawings Arya instagrams sometimes.</p><p>Something about them makes Sansa tired and her chest ache, and she folds her legs under her and sinks to the floor at the foot of Jon&rsquo;s bed, cool wood knuckling into her back. Jon goes to flip the light on, then pauses. Out of the side of her eye she sees him let his arm drop, and he moves to the foot of the bed. She feels more than sees him slide down to the carpet beside her, legs drawn up to fit in the narrow space between bed and wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me your hand,&rdquo; she says, still not looking at him. He hesitates, then offers it, and Sansa draws it to her lap. It&rsquo;s warm and solid, calluses rasping lightly against the tips of her fingers as she ghosts them over his palm. &ldquo;What did Arya tell you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That your dad had been floating money for his business partner. Baratheon, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Robert Baratheon.&rdquo; She traces the half circle running from his wrist to above his thumb. It&rsquo;s easier than looking up. &ldquo;After the crash&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>And sitting with his shoulder touching hers and his hand in her lap, Sansa tells him. Tells him how when her mother had needed the money back Robert hadn&rsquo;t had it, how after the feds shut him down it meant they were never getting any of it back, how it had taken selling the house and cashing in her father&rsquo;s life insurance and every cent they had invested just to cover the clients Robert cheated, how even that had barely been enough to keep them from being sued.</p><p>And once she&rsquo;s started Sansa finds she can&rsquo;t stop: she tells him about how even though he&rsquo;d survived the crash Bran&rsquo;s medical bills had drained their savings dry, how her mother had gone back to work only to find she didn&rsquo;t make enough to cover them, how Arya had almost been expelled from school for getting in fights, how every friend Sansa thought she&rsquo;d had disappeared like smoke once she couldn&rsquo;t keep up with their clothes and shoes and purses, how she&rsquo;d stayed for so long with Joffrey before breaking up because she didn&rsquo;t know who she was without him, how she&rsquo;d had to move in with Lysa just so she could have a shot at the Vale High transfer scholarship and a decent college.</p><p>Jon listens through it all without speaking, a solid presence beside her, hand callused and warm. When the words have finally run dry he touches her knee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he says, voice soft and hoarse. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. I should&rsquo;ve been there. But after the crash, with your mom and Bran- I didn&rsquo;t feel like it was my place-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. It&rsquo;s ok.&rdquo; Sansa gives him a smile; sad and small, but it&rsquo;s the last she has. &ldquo;You were there for Arya. I don&rsquo;t think she could have gotten through it without you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but&hellip;&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s jaw works silently. &ldquo;Someone should have been there for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I managed.&rdquo; Sansa looks back down at his palm. It is isn&rsquo;t fair for her to do it, not when they were never close, not when he&rsquo;s just being kind (and Jon has always been kind, even if she never bothered to notice), but Sansa pulls his arm over her shoulders and shifts so she fits in the crook of his side. &ldquo;I always manage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa&hellip;&rdquo; He starts, and Sansa thinks his voice may be the saddest thing she&rsquo;s ever heard. She shakes her head into his shoulder before he can say more. She&rsquo;s snug and safe, snug and safe for the first time in a long time and she doesn&rsquo;t want to give that up for something that is dead and gone. They aren&rsquo;t friends, she knows that, she does, but-</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she says softly, &ldquo;can we just sit for a little?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon is still a long moment, then nods into her hair and pulls her closer.</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16590095/chapters/38968799#workskin\" target=\"_blank\">A03 Link</a></p>",
