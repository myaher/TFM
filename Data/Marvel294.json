But one day she walks into her boyfriends office only to find him being rude and totally disrespectful to a woman who deserves the respect of the whole world. So Y/n, despite her introvertedness, decides to call him out on it right then and there.\u00a0</p><p>Warnings: Cursing, angst (?), and I think that\u2019s it???</p><p>Ok so literally only three people read my last fic which is fine obviously except for the fact that it actually really hurts for some reason but oh well that\u2019s not important I just had this really awesome idea for a short lil fic and I was gonna make it a request to someone and be lazy but then I decided that I waned to write it myself. Nobody is gonna see this or like this but it\u2019s whatever so here we go.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Y/N POV</p><p>With my fresh coffee in one hand and my favorite book in the other, I stepped into the elevator up to my boyfriend, Tom\u2019s office. Often when he\u2019s not out\u00a0\u201cdoing business,\u201d he\u2019s up in his office dealing with paperwork and things; and sometimes when I\u2019m having a really boring day at the house, I\u2019ll come to his office and read on the couch while he\u2019s doing paperwork at his desk. I do it a lot and now mos of his workers recognize me and let me right on through.\u00a0So here I stand in the elevator, tapping my foot to the soft music and waiting patiently for the elevator to arrive at the top floor.\u00a0</p><p>Along the way, it would stop and people would get on or off. I never talked to any of them, we exchanged respectful nods, but we otherwise did not talk. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like them or anything, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not exactly a people person and I hate talking to strangers. And attention. And public speaking. And new people that I don\u2019t know.\u00a0</p><p>Anyways I finally made it up to the top floor. My coffee was almost gone at this point so I tossed it into a nearby trashcan before greeting the receptionist in front of Tom\u2019s office.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello Miss Y/L/N, here to see Mr. Holland,\u201d she asked brightly with a broad smile. I nodded my head and mumbled a quiet\u00a0\u2018Yeah\u2019 in response.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright, well just head on in. He\u2019s finishing up a meeting with Miss Julia Smith, you know her, but he should be about done.\u201d I stopped for a second,\u00a0\u201cIs she the one that-<br/></p><p>\u201cThat saved your life at the gala last month? Yes,\u201d she finished for me.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I smiled,\u00a0\u201cRight. of course. Thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I walked up to his office and opened the door, eager to see my boyfriend and favorite agent of his, as gingerly as I could, hoping to go in with minimal disruption.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy would I send you, of all people, out into the field? Could you imagine? A woman, doing a mission by herself? Well first of all you\u2019re not nearly strong enough for a solo mission, nor do you have the abilities to even gather the simplest of information. How could you? You\u2019re a <i>woman</i>.\u201d</p><p>I stopped in my tracks, furious at my boyfriends words.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr.Holland, me being a woman has nothing to do with my abilities to gather information. I can get the job done and I can do it more efficiently than most of your men,\u201d the woman defended. Tom chuckled heartlessly, and stood from his chair,\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou are not going on this mission alone, you\u2019re just a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I blurted out, for once, without thinking.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh Y/n, darling, you\u2019re he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but did I just hear you telling this very capable agent that she can\u2019t go on a mission because she\u2019s a woman,\u201d I seethed, beyond angry and with fury evident in my voice and demeanor. Tom visibly gulped and nodded his head, obviously shocked at my visible anger.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell makes you think that just because she is a woman that she won\u2019t be able to complete this mission? And who the <i>hell </i>do you think you are to tell her that her abilities are anything <i>less </i>than excellent when, very clearly she is the <i>best </i>agent you have? This woman <i>saved my life </i>when none of your other men were even <i>aware </i>of a threat? What the <i>hell </i>is wrong with you that you think <i>any </i>of what you just said was okay? If I <i>ever </i>hear you talking to her, or any women, so disrespectfully and with such misogyny and sexism I will not hesitate to to use your own knife to slit your throat. DO you understand me,\u201d I growled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Silence followed, both too stunned by my justified outburst.\u00a0\u201cDo you understand me,\u201d I barked, making him jump.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, yes I understand darling, I\u2019m so so sorry,\u201d Tom rushed out, his voice quiet and fearful, which, for a mobster, was really not like him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize to me, apologize to her,\u201d I shouted, riding the wave of anger as far as it would take me.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Quickly, Tom turned to Julia,\u00a0\u201cJulia, I\u2019m very sorry of the way I spoke to you. It was misogynistic and rude and I apologize. I will send you the information you need, you will be going by yourself. I do hope you\u2019ll forgive me,\u201d he spoke with a regretful, sincere expression.\u00a0</p><p>She gave him a curt nod and replied,\u00a0\u201cApology accepted, sir.\u201d She quickly turned away and left. Not before ginning at me and mouthing a quick\u00a0\u2018thank you.\u2019 I grinned and nodded.\u00a0</p><p>The door closed behind her and Tom let out a deep breath, as though he\u2019d held it the entire time and looked at me with a shocked and fearful face.\u00a0\u201cY/n, dear,\u201d worry clear in his voice, unsure of what to expect from me.</p><p>I set my stuff down before walking over to him, stopping just before him. I let out a breath and grabbed his hand.\u00a0\u201cTom, I love you, I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he asked, worried I was about to breakup with him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I took\u00a0 a deep breath,\u00a0\u201cJust- just promise me you\u2019ll never treat anybody like that again, please.\u201d He nodded vigorously,\u00a0\u201cOf course darling, of course I promise! I\u2019m so sorry, sweet heart.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, his eyes were actually beginning to brim, with tears, his eyebrows knitted with concern and I could tell he was sincerely remorseful. I sighed and smiled gently, standing up on my toes to place a kiss on his lips which he welcomed gratefully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry I scared you,\u201d I said with a smirk making him laugh.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t scare me,\u201d he replied unconvincingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah okay, and I didn\u2019t just kiss you,\u201d I quipped.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOk, alright, you did scare me. But in my defense I\u2019ve only ever heard you yell at the television, but that\u2019s always cute because you\u2019re never really that serious,\u201d Tom replied defeated.\u00a0</p><p>I laughed and shook my head,\u00a0\u201cWhatever you say babe,\u201d I mumbled and pulled him down into a loving kiss.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~\u00a0</p><p>So that\u2019s that ad I\u2019m actually really kinda proud of it? Which sucks because I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s gonna see this sooooo&hellip;.. Imma just post it and suffer in silence.\u00a0</p><p>But I hope you liked it if you did read this! Please lemme know what you think and stuff!\u00a0</p><p>k bye.</p>",

Tom chuckled heartlessly, and stood from his chair,\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou are not going on this mission alone, you\u2019re just a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I blurted out, for once, without thinking.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh Y/n, darling, you\u2019re he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but did I just hear you telling this very capable agent that she can\u2019t go on a mission because she\u2019s a woman,\u201d I seethed, beyond angry and with fury evident in my voice and demeanor. Tom visibly gulped and nodded his head, obviously shocked at my visible anger.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell makes you think that just because she is a woman that she won\u2019t be able to complete this mission? And who the <i>hell </i>do you think you are to tell her that her abilities are anything <i>less </i>than excellent when, very clearly she is the <i>best </i>agent you have? This woman <i>saved my life </i>when none of your other men were even <i>aware </i>of a threat? What the <i>hell </i>is wrong with you that you think <i>any </i>of what you just said was okay? If I <i>ever </i>hear you talking to her, or any women, so disrespectfully and with such misogyny and sexism I will not hesitate to to use your own knife to slit your throat. DO you understand me,\u201d I growled.\u00a0<br></p><p>Silence followed, both too stunned by my justified outburst.\u00a0\u201cDo you understand me,\u201d I barked, making him jump.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, yes I understand darling, I\u2019m so so sorry,\u201d Tom rushed out, his voice quiet and fearful, which, for a mobster, was really not like him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize to me, apologize to her,\u201d I shouted, riding the wave of anger as far as it would take me.\u00a0<br></p><p>Quickly, Tom turned to Julia,\u00a0\u201cJulia, I\u2019m very sorry of the way I spoke to you. It was misogynistic and rude and I apologize. I will send you the information you need, you will be going by yourself. I do hope you\u2019ll forgive me,\u201d he spoke with a regretful, sincere expression.\u00a0</p><p>She gave him a curt nod and replied,\u00a0\u201cApology accepted, sir.\u201d She quickly turned away and left. Not before ginning at me and mouthing a quick\u00a0\u2018thank you.\u2019 I grinned and nodded.\u00a0</p><p>The door closed behind her and Tom let out a deep breath, as though he\u2019d held it the entire time and looked at me with a shocked and fearful face.\u00a0\u201cY/n, dear,\u201d worry clear in his voice, unsure of what to expect from me.</p><p>I set my stuff down before walking over to him, stopping just before him. I let out a breath and grabbed his hand.\u00a0\u201cTom, I love you, I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he asked, worried I was about to breakup with him.\u00a0<br></p><p>I took\u00a0 a deep breath,\u00a0\u201cJust- just promise me you\u2019ll never treat anybody like that again, please.\u201d He nodded vigorously,\u00a0\u201cOf course darling, of course I promise! I\u2019m so sorry, sweet heart.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, his eyes were actually beginning to brim, with tears, his eyebrows knitted with concern and I could tell he was sincerely remorseful. I sighed and smiled gently, standing up on my toes to place a kiss on his lips which he welcomed gratefully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry I scared you,\u201d I said with a smirk making him laugh.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t scare me,\u201d he replied unconvincingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah okay, and I didn\u2019t just kiss you,\u201d I quipped.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOk, alright, you did scare me. But in my defense I\u2019ve only ever heard you yell at the television, but that\u2019s always cute because you\u2019re never really that serious,\u201d Tom replied defeated.\u00a0</p><p>I laughed and shook my head,\u00a0\u201cWhatever you say babe,\u201d I mumbled and pulled him down into a loving kiss.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~\u00a0</p><p>So that\u2019s that ad I\u2019m actually really kinda proud of it? Which sucks because I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s gonna see this sooooo\u2026.. Imma just post it and suffer in silence.\u00a0</p><p>But I hope you liked it if you did read this!

But one day she walks into her boyfriends office only to find him being rude and totally disrespectful to a woman who deserves the respect of the whole world. So Y/n, despite her introvertedness, decides to call him out on it right then and there.\u00a0</p><p>Warnings: Cursing, angst (?), and I think that\u2019s it???</p><p>Ok so literally only three people read my last fic which is fine obviously except for the fact that it actually really hurts for some reason but oh well that\u2019s not important I just had this really awesome idea for a short lil fic and I was gonna make it a request to someone and be lazy but then I decided that I waned to write it myself. Nobody is gonna see this or like this but it\u2019s whatever so here we go.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Y/N POV</p><p>With my fresh coffee in one hand and my favorite book in the other, I stepped into the elevator up to my boyfriend, Tom\u2019s office. Often when he\u2019s not out\u00a0\u201cdoing business,\u201d he\u2019s up in his office dealing with paperwork and things; and sometimes when I\u2019m having a really boring day at the house, I\u2019ll come to his office and read on the couch while he\u2019s doing paperwork at his desk. I do it a lot and now mos of his workers recognize me and let me right on through.\u00a0So here I stand in the elevator, tapping my foot to the soft music and waiting patiently for the elevator to arrive at the top floor.\u00a0</p><p>Along the way, it would stop and people would get on or off. I never talked to any of them, we exchanged respectful nods, but we otherwise did not talk. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like them or anything, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not exactly a people person and I hate talking to strangers. And attention. And public speaking. And new people that I don\u2019t know.\u00a0</p><p>Anyways I finally made it up to the top floor. My coffee was almost gone at this point so I tossed it into a nearby trashcan before greeting the receptionist in front of Tom\u2019s office.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello Miss Y/L/N, here to see Mr. Holland,\u201d she asked brightly with a broad smile. I nodded my head and mumbled a quiet\u00a0\u2018Yeah\u2019 in response.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright, well just head on in. He\u2019s finishing up a meeting with Miss Julia Smith, you know her, but he should be about done.\u201d I stopped for a second,\u00a0\u201cIs she the one that-<br></p><p>\u201cThat saved your life at the gala last month? Yes,\u201d she finished for me.\u00a0<br></p><p>I smiled,\u00a0\u201cRight. of course. Thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I walked up to his office and opened the door, eager to see my boyfriend and favorite agent of his, as gingerly as I could, hoping to go in with minimal disruption.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy would I send you, of all people, out into the field? Could you imagine? A woman, doing a mission by herself? Well first of all you\u2019re not nearly strong enough for a solo mission, nor do you have the abilities to even gather the simplest of information. How could you? You\u2019re a <i>woman</i>.\u201d</p><p>I stopped in my tracks, furious at my boyfriends words.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr.Holland, me being a woman has nothing to do with my abilities to gather information.
