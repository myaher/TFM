It wasn\u2019t an unpleasant task, sitting on his bed and polishing those heavy, tall boots. After a while, he even felt a strange, almost meditative calm coming over him. This was something that had staid the same. This was a skill his former life had given him, and that he still could use in his new life.</p><p>He could do this, he thought as he finished up the second boot. He could grow into his position. He could be useful to Ronan. And who knew, if Ronan thought highly enough of his service, maybe he\u2019d put in a word for him. Maybe there was yet a chance that his life would be more than this. Maybe there was a path back to his old life, even.</p><p>It was dangerous to hope, but what else was he supposed to do? He had always been a fighter; otherwise he would never have earned his rank as a commander. He had never been one for just accepting what seemed on the first glance to be unchangeable. Maybe if he worked hard enough, even the impossible could happen.</p><!-- more --><p>The next days went on in a monotonous repetition of the same tasks. During the day he cleaned Ronan\u2019s quarters, made his ridiculously large bed, decked his table and cleaned it off after Ronan had eaten; in the evening he cleaned his boots. After about four days, though, at least a little bit of the monotony was broken when Ronan brought him other parts of his armour to clean, additionally to his boots. By the end of his first two weeks, Ronan spent about two hours in the evening cleaning Ronan\u2019s boots, his vambraces, his shoulder plates, his body armour and finally even the finely meshed metal tunic he wore beneath it (which, as Yon-Rogg knew, was a completely useless but still much-loved part of an armouring tradition among the Accusers that went back several millennia). It was hard work, but when Ronan\u2019s valet came to him on the night of his fifteenth day with Ronan\u2019s helmet in his arms and the orders to polish it, Yon-Rogg felt as if it had been worth it. He knew that an Accuser would never give his helmet to just anybody. It was a strange feeling to know that he had earned Ronan\u2019s trust in such an intimate way - because what could be more intimate and important to a warrior than his armour?</p><p>He slowly started to feel more comfortable in his role. It was odd to feel useful as a servant - his successes as a soldier had been easily measured and painstakingly recorded, but the greatest pride the people he was working with here knew was to know that they did their work like it was expected of them, in such a way that nobody ever really noticed that they were there at all. This was really something Yon-Rogg couldn\u2019t empathise with. If he hadn\u2019t known by the continually growing pile of armour he was taking care of that Ronan very much noticed him, he wasn\u2019t sure if he would feel as content as he did. There were still moments, especially when his knees were hurting and his shoulder was burning because he had been on all fours for hours scouring the floor, when he wished he could just burn the entire ship to the ground, but they became fewer and fewer as the days went on. He even started to use the communal shower - and after he made the very pleasant discovery that both one of the female servants and the younger male servant would wait for him to use the shower before they went in so they could ogle his battle-hardened body, he made sure to have at least a quick rinse every evening.</p><p>He also took up his old confined-space training regime again, after he had woken up one night in a cold sweat realising that if he didn\u2019t do anything to keep the bulk and definition of his muscles, he would sooner or later lose them.</p><p>It was a month after he had started his new role, nearly on the day, when the old valet came into his room carrying the armour he was supposed to clean. This wasn\u2019t unusual at all, since it happened every night; what did make this night different from any of the others was that the valet stayed after he had put the armour down, instead of just turning his back and walking out.</p><p>\u201cThe master wants you to assist him tomorrow when he dons his armour,\u201d he said in his flat, disinterested voice.</p><p>Yon-Rogg had just been reaching for his cleaning kit, and those words took him so much by surprise that he missed the kit and grasped at nothing.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The valet shrugged. \u201cI have no idea what exactly he is thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cbut yes, that was his command. So you will bring his armour to his rooms tomorrow after he had breakfast.\u201d</p><p>The Accuser\u2019s morning rituals had always been something that happened between him and his valet, the same as his night rituals. Yon-Rogg hadn\u2019t even seen Ronan out of his armour yet. It felt as if he was being invited to conduct a sacred ceremony, but he didn\u2019t even know the sacred words he would be required to recite.</p><p>\u201cI have never done more with an Accuser\u2019s uniform than clean it,\u201d he said, still perplexed.</p><p>The valet held out a data tablet. \u201cYou have an entire night to learn how to put it on, then.\u201d</p><p>Yon-Rogg took the tablet, which was showing an interactive schematic of an Accuser\u2019s armour. The valet turned around without another word and closed the door behind him.</p><p>So that night, after he had spent nearly two hours cleaning the Accuser\u2019s armour, he spent another two hours experimenting with the various closing mechanisms until he was positive that he would not make a complete fool of himself the next day. He didn\u2019t get much sleep, but there had been missions during which he had slept maybe two hours in forty-eight. He was sure that he would still be alert and ready in the morning.</p><p>*******</p><p>He waited in front of Ronan\u2019s door a quarter of an hour before he knew Ronan would end his breakfast. In one arm he was holding the armour, which he had suspended on a special portable rack, with the helmet on top, in the other he was holding Ronan\u2019s boots.</p><p>The valet opened the door at the exact time he had told him earlier, holding a covered tray that held the remnants of Ronan\u2019s morning meal. He looked at him for only a moment before he stepped out, leaving the door open so Yon-Rogg could step inside.</p><p>Ronan was still sitting at his breakfast table. He was wearing black under-armour, including a black veil of a similar shape as his helmet. For a second, Yon-Rogg was disappointed that he wasn\u2019t going to get a glimpse of Ronan\u2019s bare head - he had heard that the Accusers shaved off every hair on their body, and while that was obviously true for his eyebrows, he would have liked to see whether it was true for his head also.</p><p>As it was, it was also interesting to see him outside of his armour. He was still tall and muscular, but not as broad, not as massive as he looked with the armour on. There was an odd grace to him as he stood up, pushing the chair away, and walked towards one corner of the room where two mirrors were installed in the walls. He stood there for a moment, looking in the mirror, before he turned his head towards Yon-Rogg.</p><p>\u201cDo you need an invitation?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Yon-Rogg startled at that; he had been far too preoccupied with staring at the taut muscles that were visible under the black under-armour.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Master,\u201d he said, then he carried the armour over to Ronan. With a small motion of his hand, Ronan pointed him to a hook where he could hang the rack; then he watched him as he put the boots down below the rest of the armour.</p><p>Yon-Rogg took a deep breath while he undid the mesh shirt from the rack. This part was the easiest; he simply handed Ronan the shirt and Ronan slipped into it. The only thing Yon-Rogg had to do was to gently tug it into place. With how close his hands came, he could feel the warmth of Ronan\u2019s body, and he definitely took a little longer to make sure every part of the mesh shirt was in place than was strictly necessary. Only when he caught Ronan\u2019s look in the mirror, the tiny, knowing smile in his eyes, did he turn away, his face flushed, to take the first part of his upper body armour off the rack.</p><p>Ronan raised his arms to let Yon-Rogg fit the piece around his torso. The clasps on this one were rather complex, but Yon-Rogg had spent enough time practicing yesterday that he ended up only closing one of them in the wrong way; it was an easy mistake to correct. A more experienced valet might have gotten it on faster, but he thought he wasn\u2019t doing too bad for his first time.</p><p>Unlike the Starforce uniform Yon-Rogg had been used to, the Accuser\u2019s armour was largely ceremonial, and so it was rather par for the course that it was inordinately detailed. The side guard came in two pieces, both of which had to be attached to hidden clasps in the basic upper body armour. It was highly fiddly work, especially since the heavy guard had to be held up while the closing mechanism was connected to the lower layer. Yon-Rogg was nearly positive that this had been designed with two valets in mind, but he still managed to get it on somehow. He fixed the additional clasps at the front, then he did the second side guard.</p><p>His work wasn\u2019t made any easier by the fact that he needed to stand quite a bit closer to Ronan to get the side pieces on, and that Ronan had to hold his arm up during the entire feat. So not only did he literally have to duck under his arm when he was behind him but needed to adjust something in the front, but he was also getting to become quite familiar with the smell of Ronan\u2019s body. He had obviously showered before breakfast; he smelled like standard issue soap, and it gave Yon-Rogg a little thrill to know that even those at the topmost end of the food chain were given the same hygiene articles as mere foot soldiers. But there was something beneath that scent of soap that distracted Yon-Rogg from his task twice; a musky, earthy smell that made a decidedly inappropriate warmth run through Yon-Rogg\u2019s body. He caught himself again quickly both times, but he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Ronan had noticed. There was nothing as obvious as that look he had had in his eyes earlier, but still\u2026</p><p>The back guard and the shoulder plates were far easier to fasten than the side guards, and so where the arm guards, which were still a bit of a bother though, since they came in two parts per arm. The right vanguard gave him a few problems, since he fixed the clasps in the wrong order, but Ronan didn\u2019t make any remark when he opened them again and started from the beginning.</p><p>Only the boots and the helmet remained now. Yon-Rogg couldn\u2019t help the flush that rose in his cheeks as he went down to his knees before the Accuser. Ronan was still not making any comments, and Yon-Rogg was extremely glad for that. It was only a small consolation that the first man he ever knelt before was somebody of the status and power of Ronan.</p><p>Ronan lifted his foot so that Yon-Rogg could slip the base part of his boots over it; then he held up the individual plates so that he could fasten the highest clasp. When he inadvertently touched the back of the Accuser\u2019s knee, a ripple went through the muscles before his face. Was that\u2026 He hesitated for a moment, then he cast a quick glance up at Ronan. The Accuser was pointedly staring into the mirror; there was an expression of displeasure on his face that immediately confirmed Yon-Rogg\u2019s suspicion. Ronan the Accuser, Commander of the Dark Aster, scion of one of the highest noble houses of Halla - was ticklish.</p><p>Yon-Rogg lowered his eyes to the toe of his boots to hide the grin on his face.

During the day he cleaned Ronan\u2019s quarters, made his ridiculously large bed, decked his table and cleaned it off after Ronan had eaten; in the evening he cleaned his boots. After about four days, though, at least a little bit of the monotony was broken when Ronan brought him other parts of his armour to clean, additionally to his boots. By the end of his first two weeks, Ronan spent about two hours in the evening cleaning Ronan\u2019s boots, his vambraces, his shoulder plates, his body armour and finally even the finely meshed metal tunic he wore beneath it (which, as Yon-Rogg knew, was a completely useless but still much-loved part of an armouring tradition among the Accusers that went back several millennia). It was hard work, but when Ronan\u2019s valet came to him on the night of his fifteenth day with Ronan\u2019s helmet in his arms and the orders to polish it, Yon-Rogg felt as if it had been worth it. He knew that an Accuser would never give his helmet to just anybody. It was a strange feeling to know that he had earned Ronan\u2019s trust in such an intimate way - because what could be more intimate and important to a warrior than his armour?</p><p>He slowly started to feel more comfortable in his role. It was odd to feel useful as a servant - his successes as a soldier had been easily measured and painstakingly recorded, but the greatest pride the people he was working with here knew was to know that they did their work like it was expected of them, in such a way that nobody ever really noticed that they were there at all. This was really something Yon-Rogg couldn\u2019t empathise with. If he hadn\u2019t known by the continually growing pile of armour he was taking care of that Ronan very much noticed him, he wasn\u2019t sure if he would feel as content as he did. There were still moments, especially when his knees were hurting and his shoulder was burning because he had been on all fours for hours scouring the floor, when he wished he could just burn the entire ship to the ground, but they became fewer and fewer as the days went on. He even started to use the communal shower - and after he made the very pleasant discovery that both one of the female servants and the younger male servant would wait for him to use the shower before they went in so they could ogle his battle-hardened body, he made sure to have at least a quick rinse every evening.</p><p>He also took up his old confined-space training regime again, after he had woken up one night in a cold sweat realising that if he didn\u2019t do anything to keep the bulk and definition of his muscles, he would sooner or later lose them.</p><p>It was a month after he had started his new role, nearly on the day, when the old valet came into his room carrying the armour he was supposed to clean. This wasn\u2019t unusual at all, since it happened every night; what did make this night different from any of the others was that the valet stayed after he had put the armour down, instead of just turning his back and walking out.</p><p>\u201cThe master wants you to assist him tomorrow when he dons his armour,\u201d he said in his flat, disinterested voice.</p><p>Yon-Rogg had just been reaching for his cleaning kit, and those words took him so much by surprise that he missed the kit and grasped at nothing.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The valet shrugged. \u201cI have no idea what exactly he is thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cbut yes, that was his command. So you will bring his armour to his rooms tomorrow after he had breakfast.\u201d</p><p>The Accuser\u2019s morning rituals had always been something that happened between him and his valet, the same as his night rituals. Yon-Rogg hadn\u2019t even seen Ronan out of his armour yet. It felt as if he was being invited to conduct a sacred ceremony, but he didn\u2019t even know the sacred words he would be required to recite.</p><p>\u201cI have never done more with an Accuser\u2019s uniform than clean it,\u201d he said, still perplexed.</p><p>The valet held out a data tablet. \u201cYou have an entire night to learn how to put it on, then.\u201d</p><p>Yon-Rogg took the tablet, which was showing an interactive schematic of an Accuser\u2019s armour. The valet turned around without another word and closed the door behind him.</p><p>So that night, after he had spent nearly two hours cleaning the Accuser\u2019s armour, he spent another two hours experimenting with the various closing mechanisms until he was positive that he would not make a complete fool of himself the next day. He didn\u2019t get much sleep, but there had been missions during which he had slept maybe two hours in forty-eight. He was sure that he would still be alert and ready in the morning.</p><p>*******</p><p>He waited in front of Ronan\u2019s door a quarter of an hour before he knew Ronan would end his breakfast. In one arm he was holding the armour, which he had suspended on a special portable rack, with the helmet on top, in the other he was holding Ronan\u2019s boots.</p><p>The valet opened the door at the exact time he had told him earlier, holding a covered tray that held the remnants of Ronan\u2019s morning meal. He looked at him for only a moment before he stepped out, leaving the door open so Yon-Rogg could step inside.</p><p>Ronan was still sitting at his breakfast table. He was wearing black under-armour, including a black veil of a similar shape as his helmet. For a second, Yon-Rogg was disappointed that he wasn\u2019t going to get a glimpse of Ronan\u2019s bare head - he had heard that the Accusers shaved off every hair on their body, and while that was obviously true for his eyebrows, he would have liked to see whether it was true for his head also.</p><p>As it was, it was also interesting to see him outside of his armour. He was still tall and muscular, but not as broad, not as massive as he looked with the armour on. There was an odd grace to him as he stood up, pushing the chair away, and walked towards one corner of the room where two mirrors were installed in the walls. He stood there for a moment, looking in the mirror, before he turned his head towards Yon-Rogg.</p><p>\u201cDo you need an invitation?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Yon-Rogg startled at that; he had been far too preoccupied with staring at the taut muscles that were visible under the black under-armour.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Master,\u201d he said, then he carried the armour over to Ronan. With a small motion of his hand, Ronan pointed him to a hook where he could hang the rack; then he watched him as he put the boots down below the rest of the armour.</p><p>Yon-Rogg took a deep breath while he undid the mesh shirt from the rack. This part was the easiest; he simply handed Ronan the shirt and Ronan slipped into it. The only thing Yon-Rogg had to do was to gently tug it into place. With how close his hands came, he could feel the warmth of Ronan\u2019s body, and he definitely took a little longer to make sure every part of the mesh shirt was in place than was strictly necessary. Only when he caught Ronan\u2019s look in the mirror, the tiny, knowing smile in his eyes, did he turn away, his face flushed, to take the first part of his upper body armour off the rack.</p><p>Ronan raised his arms to let Yon-Rogg fit the piece around his torso. The clasps on this one were rather complex, but Yon-Rogg had spent enough time practicing yesterday that he ended up only closing one of them in the wrong way; it was an easy mistake to correct. A more experienced valet might have gotten it on faster, but he thought he wasn\u2019t doing too bad for his first time.</p><p>Unlike the Starforce uniform Yon-Rogg had been used to, the Accuser\u2019s armour was largely ceremonial, and so it was rather par for the course that it was inordinately detailed. The side guard came in two pieces, both of which had to be attached to hidden clasps in the basic upper body armour. It was highly fiddly work, especially since the heavy guard had to be held up while the closing mechanism was connected to the lower layer. Yon-Rogg was nearly positive that this had been designed with two valets in mind, but he still managed to get it on somehow. He fixed the additional clasps at the front, then he did the second side guard.</p><p>His work wasn\u2019t made any easier by the fact that he needed to stand quite a bit closer to Ronan to get the side pieces on, and that Ronan had to hold his arm up during the entire feat. So not only did he literally have to duck under his arm when he was behind him but needed to adjust something in the front, but he was also getting to become quite familiar with the smell of Ronan\u2019s body. He had obviously showered before breakfast; he smelled like standard issue soap, and it gave Yon-Rogg a little thrill to know that even those at the topmost end of the food chain were given the same hygiene articles as mere foot soldiers. But there was something beneath that scent of soap that distracted Yon-Rogg from his task twice; a musky, earthy smell that made a decidedly inappropriate warmth run through Yon-Rogg\u2019s body. He caught himself again quickly both times, but he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Ronan had noticed. There was nothing as obvious as that look he had had in his eyes earlier, but still\u2026</p><p>The back guard and the shoulder plates were far easier to fasten than the side guards, and so where the arm guards, which were still a bit of a bother though, since they came in two parts per arm. The right vanguard gave him a few problems, since he fixed the clasps in the wrong order, but Ronan didn\u2019t make any remark when he opened them again and started from the beginning.</p><p>Only the boots and the helmet remained now. Yon-Rogg couldn\u2019t help the flush that rose in his cheeks as he went down to his knees before the Accuser. Ronan was still not making any comments, and Yon-Rogg was extremely glad for that. It was only a small consolation that the first man he ever knelt before was somebody of the status and power of Ronan.</p><p>Ronan lifted his foot so that Yon-Rogg could slip the base part of his boots over it; then he held up the individual plates so that he could fasten the highest clasp. When he inadvertently touched the back of the Accuser\u2019s knee, a ripple went through the muscles before his face. Was that\u2026 He hesitated for a moment, then he cast a quick glance up at Ronan. The Accuser was pointedly staring into the mirror; there was an expression of displeasure on his face that immediately confirmed Yon-Rogg\u2019s suspicion. Ronan the Accuser, Commander of the Dark Aster, scion of one of the highest noble houses of Halla - was ticklish.</p><p>Yon-Rogg lowered his eyes to the toe of his boots to hide the grin on his face. Now that was interesting. Quite useless, but still interesting.</p><p>He fastened the rest of the straps of his boots, then he did the same with the other boot, though this time he was careful not to touch the backside of Ronan\u2019s knee again. Once he was done, he stood up and walked over to the rack, where the last piece of Ronan\u2019s armour, his helmet, was waiting.</p><p>Yon-Rogg would have to put the helmet on Ronan\u2019s head from the back, slotting the neck guards perfectly into the corresponding groves in his shoulder guards.

Only when he caught Ronan\u2019s look in the mirror, the tiny, knowing smile in his eyes, did he turn away, his face flushed, to take the first part of his upper body armour off the rack.</p><p>Ronan raised his arms to let Yon-Rogg fit the piece around his torso. The clasps on this one were rather complex, but Yon-Rogg had spent enough time practicing yesterday that he ended up only closing one of them in the wrong way; it was an easy mistake to correct. A more experienced valet might have gotten it on faster, but he thought he wasn\u2019t doing too bad for his first time.</p><p>Unlike the Starforce uniform Yon-Rogg had been used to, the Accuser\u2019s armour was largely ceremonial, and so it was rather par for the course that it was inordinately detailed. The side guard came in two pieces, both of which had to be attached to hidden clasps in the basic upper body armour. It was highly fiddly work, especially since the heavy guard had to be held up while the closing mechanism was connected to the lower layer. Yon-Rogg was nearly positive that this had been designed with two valets in mind, but he still managed to get it on somehow. He fixed the additional clasps at the front, then he did the second side guard.</p><p>His work wasn\u2019t made any easier by the fact that he needed to stand quite a bit closer to Ronan to get the side pieces on, and that Ronan had to hold his arm up during the entire feat. So not only did he literally have to duck under his arm when he was behind him but needed to adjust something in the front, but he was also getting to become quite familiar with the smell of Ronan\u2019s body. He had obviously showered before breakfast; he smelled like standard issue soap, and it gave Yon-Rogg a little thrill to know that even those at the topmost end of the food chain were given the same hygiene articles as mere foot soldiers. But there was something beneath that scent of soap that distracted Yon-Rogg from his task twice; a musky, earthy smell that made a decidedly inappropriate warmth run through Yon-Rogg\u2019s body. He caught himself again quickly both times, but he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Ronan had noticed. There was nothing as obvious as that look he had had in his eyes earlier, but still\u2026</p><p>The back guard and the shoulder plates were far easier to fasten than the side guards, and so where the arm guards, which were still a bit of a bother though, since they came in two parts per arm. The right vanguard gave him a few problems, since he fixed the clasps in the wrong order, but Ronan didn\u2019t make any remark when he opened them again and started from the beginning.</p><p>Only the boots and the helmet remained now. Yon-Rogg couldn\u2019t help the flush that rose in his cheeks as he went down to his knees before the Accuser. Ronan was still not making any comments, and Yon-Rogg was extremely glad for that. It was only a small consolation that the first man he ever knelt before was somebody of the status and power of Ronan.</p><p>Ronan lifted his foot so that Yon-Rogg could slip the base part of his boots over it; then he held up the individual plates so that he could fasten the highest clasp. When he inadvertently touched the back of the Accuser\u2019s knee, a ripple went through the muscles before his face. Was that\u2026 He hesitated for a moment, then he cast a quick glance up at Ronan. The Accuser was pointedly staring into the mirror; there was an expression of displeasure on his face that immediately confirmed Yon-Rogg\u2019s suspicion. Ronan the Accuser, Commander of the Dark Aster, scion of one of the highest noble houses of Halla - was ticklish.</p><p>Yon-Rogg lowered his eyes to the toe of his boots to hide the grin on his face. Now that was interesting. Quite useless, but still interesting.</p><p>He fastened the rest of the straps of his boots, then he did the same with the other boot, though this time he was careful not to touch the backside of Ronan\u2019s knee again. Once he was done, he stood up and walked over to the rack, where the last piece of Ronan\u2019s armour, his helmet, was waiting.</p><p>Yon-Rogg would have to put the helmet on Ronan\u2019s head from the back, slotting the neck guards perfectly into the corresponding groves in his shoulder guards. Asking Ronan to bend down to make it easier for him would be a breach of protocol, as the notes about the helmet in the valet\u2019s tablet had told him. And since he couldn\u2019t stand behind Ronan and see the mirrors at the same time, he had to do this blindly.</p><p>He tried to tell himself that he had done far more difficult things in his time; that the consequences for failure here would be merely mild annoyance on Ronan\u2019s part. Yet he was still nervous when he took the helmet and stepped behind Ronan, so nervous that for a moment he was afraid his hands would start to sweat. He lifted the helmet so far above Ronan\u2019s head that he could intuit where the edges of the neck guards would go, then he carefully eased it down.</p><p>There was a little clicking noise when the neck guards slotted into the shoulder guards. Yon-Rogg walked around Ronan to correct the fit of the helmet. It was already nearly perfect, but after Yon-Rogg had given it a last little nudge, it sat completely straight.</p><p>Ronan looked himself over in the mirrors, then he glanced down at Yon-Rogg.</p><p>\u201cQuite well done,\u201d he said, then he turned around and walked towards the exit of his room. \u201cFrom now on, I want you to be here every morning at the same time as today.\u201d</p><p>Yon-Rogg stood up a little straighter. \u201cAs you wish, master.\u201d</p>",

It wasn&rsquo;t an unpleasant task, sitting on his bed and polishing those heavy, tall boots. After a while, he even felt a strange, almost meditative calm coming over him. This was something that had staid the same. This was a skill his former life had given him, and that he still could use in his new life.</p><p>He could do this, he thought as he finished up the second boot. He could grow into his position. He could be useful to Ronan. And who knew, if Ronan thought highly enough of his service, maybe he&rsquo;d put in a word for him. Maybe there was yet a chance that his life would be more than this. Maybe there was a path back to his old life, even.</p><p>It was dangerous to hope, but what else was he supposed to do? He had always been a fighter; otherwise he would never have earned his rank as a commander. He had never been one for just accepting what seemed on the first glance to be unchangeable. Maybe if he worked hard enough, even the impossible could happen.</p><p>The next days went on in a monotonous repetition of the same tasks. During the day he cleaned Ronan&rsquo;s quarters, made his ridiculously large bed, decked his table and cleaned it off after Ronan had eaten; in the evening he cleaned his boots. After about four days, though, at least a little bit of the monotony was broken when Ronan brought him other parts of his armour to clean, additionally to his boots. By the end of his first two weeks, Ronan spent about two hours in the evening cleaning Ronan&rsquo;s boots, his vambraces, his shoulder plates, his body armour and finally even the finely meshed metal tunic he wore beneath it (which, as Yon-Rogg knew, was a completely useless but still much-loved part of an armouring tradition among the Accusers that went back several millennia). It was hard work, but when Ronan&rsquo;s valet came to him on the night of his fifteenth day with Ronan&rsquo;s helmet in his arms and the orders to polish it, Yon-Rogg felt as if it had been worth it. He knew that an Accuser would never give his helmet to just anybody. It was a strange feeling to know that he had earned Ronan&rsquo;s trust in such an intimate way - because what could be more intimate and important to a warrior than his armour?</p><p>He slowly started to feel more comfortable in his role. It was odd to feel useful as a servant - his successes as a soldier had been easily measured and painstakingly recorded, but the greatest pride the people he was working with here knew was to know that they did their work like it was expected of them, in such a way that nobody ever really noticed that they were there at all. This was really something Yon-Rogg couldn&rsquo;t empathise with. If he hadn&rsquo;t known by the continually growing pile of armour he was taking care of that Ronan very much noticed him, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he would feel as content as he did. There were still moments, especially when his knees were hurting and his shoulder was burning because he had been on all fours for hours scouring the floor, when he wished he could just burn the entire ship to the ground, but they became fewer and fewer as the days went on. He even started to use the communal shower - and after he made the very pleasant discovery that both one of the female servants and the younger male servant would wait for him to use the shower before they went in so they could ogle his battle-hardened body, he made sure to have at least a quick rinse every evening.</p><p>He also took up his old confined-space training regime again, after he had woken up one night in a cold sweat realising that if he didn&rsquo;t do anything to keep the bulk and definition of his muscles, he would sooner or later lose them.</p><p>It was a month after he had started his new role, nearly on the day, when the old valet came into his room carrying the armour he was supposed to clean. This wasn&rsquo;t unusual at all, since it happened every night; what did make this night different from any of the others was that the valet stayed after he had put the armour down, instead of just turning his back and walking out.</p><p>&ldquo;The master wants you to assist him tomorrow when he dons his armour,&rdquo; he said in his flat, disinterested voice.</p><p>Yon-Rogg had just been reaching for his cleaning kit, and those words took him so much by surprise that he missed the kit and grasped at nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>The valet shrugged. &ldquo;I have no idea what exactly he is thinking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but yes, that was his command. So you will bring his armour to his rooms tomorrow after he had breakfast.&rdquo;</p><p>The Accuser&rsquo;s morning rituals had always been something that happened between him and his valet, the same as his night rituals. Yon-Rogg hadn&rsquo;t even seen Ronan out of his armour yet. It felt as if he was being invited to conduct a sacred ceremony, but he didn&rsquo;t even know the sacred words he would be required to recite.</p><p>&ldquo;I have never done more with an Accuser&rsquo;s uniform than clean it,&rdquo; he said, still perplexed.</p><p>The valet held out a data tablet. &ldquo;You have an entire night to learn how to put it on, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Yon-Rogg took the tablet, which was showing an interactive schematic of an Accuser&rsquo;s armour. The valet turned around without another word and closed the door behind him.</p><p>So that night, after he had spent nearly two hours cleaning the Accuser&rsquo;s armour, he spent another two hours experimenting with the various closing mechanisms until he was positive that he would not make a complete fool of himself the next day. He didn&rsquo;t get much sleep, but there had been missions during which he had slept maybe two hours in forty-eight. He was sure that he would still be alert and ready in the morning.</p><p>*******</p><p>He waited in front of Ronan&rsquo;s door a quarter of an hour before he knew Ronan would end his breakfast. In one arm he was holding the armour, which he had suspended on a special portable rack, with the helmet on top, in the other he was holding Ronan&rsquo;s boots.</p><p>The valet opened the door at the exact time he had told him earlier, holding a covered tray that held the remnants of Ronan&rsquo;s morning meal. He looked at him for only a moment before he stepped out, leaving the door open so Yon-Rogg could step inside.</p><p>Ronan was still sitting at his breakfast table. He was wearing black under-armour, including a black veil of a similar shape as his helmet. For a second, Yon-Rogg was disappointed that he wasn&rsquo;t going to get a glimpse of Ronan&rsquo;s bare head - he had heard that the Accusers shaved off every hair on their body, and while that was obviously true for his eyebrows, he would have liked to see whether it was true for his head also.</p><p>As it was, it was also interesting to see him outside of his armour. He was still tall and muscular, but not as broad, not as massive as he looked with the armour on. There was an odd grace to him as he stood up, pushing the chair away, and walked towards one corner of the room where two mirrors were installed in the walls. He stood there for a moment, looking in the mirror, before he turned his head towards Yon-Rogg.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you need an invitation?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Yon-Rogg startled at that; he had been far too preoccupied with staring at the taut muscles that were visible under the black under-armour.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not, Master,&rdquo; he said, then he carried the armour over to Ronan. With a small motion of his hand, Ronan pointed him to a hook where he could hang the rack; then he watched him as he put the boots down below the rest of the armour.</p><p>Yon-Rogg took a deep breath while he undid the mesh shirt from the rack. This part was the easiest; he simply handed Ronan the shirt and Ronan slipped into it. The only thing Yon-Rogg had to do was to gently tug it into place. With how close his hands came, he could feel the warmth of Ronan&rsquo;s body, and he definitely took a little longer to make sure every part of the mesh shirt was in place than was strictly necessary.
