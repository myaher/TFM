He was acutely aware that every few minutes she would gently place her hand on his knee to stop him from anxiously bouncing his leg up and down, but as soon as she took her hand away, his leg was bouncing again.<br/></p><p>The only thing he could vaguely hear was shuffling feet and far away beeps and blips of various machines, some even keeping the people around him alive. <i>Please let TJ\u2019s mom be okay\u2026</i> He thought desperately as he put his head in his hands, his elbows on his knees. </p><p>Suddenly the world burst with sound as familiar sneakers entered his vision as he sprung out of his seat, nearly knocking TJ over in the process.</p><p>\u201cWoah Underdog, careful.\u201d TJ said softly as he placed his hands on Cyrus\u2019 waist to steady him, causing the younger boys face to flush in the process as he awkwardly coughed and stepped back, away from his touch.</p><p>\u201cAny news? I was going to get you food or something to drink but I wasn\u2019t sure where the vending machines were but I also wanted to be here when you came out to see if there was any news and-\u201d Cyrus had begun rambling and he quickly stopped his sentence, taking in a deep breath while glancing up as TJ\u2019s face. <i>Oh no, I hate seeing him cry\u2026</i> He thought, resisting the urge to reach his hand up and brush away the stray tears that were still on his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay. Minor cuts and bruises and they want to keep her overnight because she has a concussion, but they said she got lucky.\u201d TJ said softly, the biggest smile spreading across his face as he spoke. Before he could stop himself, Cyrus was launching himself forward, wrapping his arms around the basketball players shoulders while nearly knocking him off his feet in the process.</p><p>\u201cOh! That is such amazing news Teej. I\u2019m so so happy for you.\u201d Cyrus cried out, a tiny giggle falling from his lips as he held his friend tightly. Feeling TJ snake his arms around his waist, Cyrus blushed darkly, hiding his face in the taller boys neck momentarily before stepping away.</p><p>\u201cHey Cy? Can I ask you a question?\u201d TJ asked, his face taking on an expression Cyrus couldn\u2019t quite decipher. <i>Wait- When did he start calling me Cy?</i></p><p>\u201cYou have me a little worried here, but yeah sure. Go ahead. I\u2019m all ears.\u201d He said softly, sliding his hands into his pocket as he studied the taller boys face. He watched TJ bite his lip and tilt his head to the side before looking away.</p><p>\u201cUh- nevermind, thank you for being here for me.\u201d TJ mumbled, giving him a half smile before turning and walking back to where he had just come from. <i>Huh\u2026 That was weird\u2026</i> Pulling out his phone, he went directly to the Tumblr app to see if Tristian had messaged him back. Nothing.</p><p>Furrowing his brows, he opened the conversation and sat back down in his chair, thinking about what exactly to say.</p><p><b>Cy: Hey Tris, I might be IA for a little while. Lemon\u2019s mom got in an accident and I know he needs me right now, though he might not admit it to me. </b></p><p>Reading over his message, he nodded slightly before hitting send and shoving his phone back in his pocket.</p><p>Sliding down in his seat, Cyrus rested his head against the back of the chair while closing his eyes. As he sat there, his mind began drifting back to his conversation with TJ. <i>When did he start calling me Cy?</i></p><p>Sitting up quickly, Cyrus gasped while pulling out his phone, heading directly to his tumblr page. <i>TJ saw my post about him on tumblr</i> he thought vaguely, pressing his hand against his mouth.</p><p><i>If he saw it, why didn\u2019t he say anything?</i> Furrowing his brows, he looked up, scanning the room around him to see if he could catch a glimpse of his best friend. Seeing him walking back towards him, Cyrus stood up, walking quickly over to the taller boy.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I know this isn\u2019t the best time, with your mom being hurt and all\u2026 but earlier, when you were at my desk um, did you happen to see anything on my laptop?\u201d Towards the end of his sentence, his voice began fading out, unsure of what the response would be. TJ\u2019s smiled faltered, but then went back to normal although Cyrus could see a hidden emotion hiding in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUh, no. I don\u2019t think so. Why? Did you leave your diary open?\u201d TJ asked, his voice taking on a teasing edge.<i> Oh if only you knew\u2026</i> Cyrus plastered a smile on his face and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh. No. Just embarrassing baby pictures. Just wanted to make sure you didn\u2019t see the picture of three-year-old me running around the backyard naked Timothy Jimothy.\u201d Cyrus lightly patted the other boys shoulder before laughing at his confused expression.</p><p>\u201cNow where did you come up with that one Underdog?\u201d TJ asked, raising his brow while smirking slightly. <i>Wow this boy really gets the butterflies going\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cOh Troy J-Bolton, you will never know what\u2019s going on inside my head.\u201d TJ groaned at the name Cyrus said before playing rolling his eyes and ruffling the younger boys hair.</p><p>\u201cReally Cy? Comparing me to Troy Bolton? What all because we both play basketball?\u201d Cyrus bit his lip to keep himself from laughing too hard and shook his head, glancing down at his feet then back up at the green eyed boy. </p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s because you\u2019re both the unfairly attractive basketball captain.\u201d Blushing at his own words, Cyrus quickly looked away, coughing to cover up what he had just said. Suddenly he felt a hand on his cheek and he looked back to the boy in front of him who had an unreadable expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you aren\u2019t so bad yourself Underdog.\u201d TJ whispered, his eyes drifting to Cyrus\u2019 lips, causing the brown haired boys breath to get caught in his throat. <i>It would be so easy to just lean in. So easy to just close that distance and-</i></p><p>Cyrus\u2019 thoughts were cut off by someone clearing their throat behind the two boys, causing them to jump apart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to ruin your moment, but mom is asking for you Teej.\u201d Amber said softly, an apologetic look crossing her face as her eyes drifted from her brother to her new friend. Giving her a forgiving smile, he turned to TJ, wrapping his arms around the boys waist in a hug.</p><p>\u201cI should probably get going anyways. I still have to go to school in the morning and Ander is picking me up early so we can go to breakfast.\u201d Cyrus said softly, his face buried in TJ\u2019s chest. Suddenly all heat left him as TJ stepped back, a pained expression on his face before it was carefully covered up with a neutral expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah, wouldn\u2019t want to be tired for your date. You know, you should totally ask him out. I can tell he\u2019s into you. See you later Cyrus.\u201d TJ said coldly before turning and walking back towards him moms room, leaving a confused Cyrus and an annoyed Amber behind.</p><p>____________</p><p>The next morning Cyrus sat in his bed, his phone sitting atop his thigh as he waited for his usual good morning text from his best friend. Realizing it wasn\u2019t going to come, he swallowed the lump in his throat before getting up to start getting dressed for breakfast.<i> Did TJ really mean what he said?</i></p><p>Hearing his phone chime as he pulled his sweater on, Cyrus dove at his bed before picking up his phone and sighing softly at the notification. <i>Oh, it\u2019s just Ander.</i> Unlocking his phone, he opened his messages with the older boy. One thing he learned about Ander that he didn\u2019t expect was that the boy was a year older than TJ, two years older than himself. </p><p><b>Ander: Hey Cy. I just wanted to let you know I\u2019m outside. Can\u2019t wait to see your cute face.</b></p><p>Pursing his lips, Cyrus read over the text before frowning slightly. Shouldn\u2019t I feel something with him calling me cute? I should feel like I do when TJ calls me Underdog or Muffin.</p><p><b>Cyrus: Alright, see you in a minute bud.</b> \u00a0Laughing at his blatant awkwardness, Cyrus stuffed his phone in his pocket before grabbing his bag and heading downstairs to get in the car of the boy he had no interest in. </p><p>______</p><p>\u201cSo Cy, how was breakfast?\u201d Jonah asked lightly when he saw the brown haired boy at lunch later that day. Cyrus sighed, pushing his tray away from him as he laid his head on the table in front of him.</p><p>\u201cA disaster. Well- for me it was. He asked me out on another date and even though my head was screaming no, my mouth said yes. I didn\u2019t have the heart to take it back when I saw how happy he got.\u201d Cyrus mumbled, the words being smothered by his arms. He heard whispering and looked up to find Andi talking to Jonah, occasionally glancing at Cyrus. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 What about TJ?\u201d Andi asked hesitantly, tucking a stray piece of hair behind her ear. Cyrus sighed and shook his head, pulling out his phone as it vibrates.</p><p><b>Tristian: Oh wow, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It\u2019s crazy though, my mom is in the hospital because she got into a car accident too.</b></p><p>Cyrus gasped as he read the message over and over before looking up at Andi. </p><p>\u201cTristian\u2019s mom got into a car accident just like TJ\u2019s. So now not only do I have to be there for TJ but I have to be there for Tristian too because they both need my support.\u201d He said softly while pouting, his friends exchanging an incredulous look before Buffy starts laughing.</p><p>\u201cCy\u2026 I mean this in the nicest way possible, but how oblivious can you be?\u201d She asked, her eyes widening as she gestured widely towards him. Furrowing his brows in confusion, he glanced down at his phone that back up at his friends, at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cWhat could you possibly mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, typing out a quick reply to Tristian before shoving his phone back into his pocket to give his friends his full attention. Jonah tilted his head as he studied his friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m oblivious, but even I\u2019m not that oblivious. Really Cy? TJ\u2019s mom gets in a car accident. Tristian James\u2019 mom gets in a car accident. TJ\u2026 Tristian James. Really Cy? You haven\u2019t figured it out yet?\u201d Jonah said softly, reaching forward to place his hand on Cyrus\u2019 forearm. <i>No. No way. This is too crazy.</i></p><p>\u201cWhy do you guys have to do this\u2026 I was happy. I didn\u2019t need you guys putting these ideas into my head!\u201d Cyrus suddenly burst out of his seat, staring at his friends with tears in his eyes. Grabbing his bag, he headed toward the exit, not once looking back at his friends.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, he dialed the one person he wanted to talk to right now.</p><p>\u201cUnderdog? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in school?\u201d As soon as his best friends voice filled his ear he calmed down, slowing down his pace from a near run to a slow walk, his feet carrying him in the direction of the swings.</p><p>\u201cTeej\u2026 Can you meet me at the swings?\u201d He hated the way his voice cracked in the middle of his sentence, but he couldn\u2019t help it. Holding his breath he waited for the other boy to respond. He heard shuffling and hushed voices on the other end and became concerned the answer would be no. </p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes and we can talk about whatever is bothering you. I\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to see you because there\u2019s something I need to tell you. Bye Muffin.\u201d Hanging up the phone, Cyrus smiled briefly as he continued his walk to the park. Glancing down at his phone, the notification he saw made him stop in his tracks.</p><p><b>Tristian: I said \u201cI swing\u201d. I think if he can accept me after that, this won\u2019t be a big deal.</b></p><p><b>Tristian: Shit wrong chat. Ignore that.</b></p><p><i>That\u2019s what TJ said to me when he came out\u2026 </i>\u00a0Holding his breath, Cyrus typed out his reply, biting his lip before he pressed send. </p><p><b>Cy: TJ Kippen\u2026 I swear if this is you and you knew but didn\u2019t tell me\u2026 Please tell me this either isn\u2019t you or you didn\u2019t know. Please.</b></p><p>Releasing a shaky breath, Cyrus began walking towards the park again, only this time at a slower pace. Feeling his phone vibrate, Cyrus decided to ignore it until he arrived at the swings, allowing himself time to calm down and get his breathing back to normal.</p><p>\u201cCyrus\u2026\u201d Somehow the older boy had beat him to the park and from the looks of it -sweat on his forehead, his breath coming out in short little gasps- he had run there. Approaching the swings, TJ stood up in front of Cyrus and for the first time in a long time, made him feel small.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t know. I could handle it if you didn\u2019t know.\u201d Cyrus said, his voice sounding small and fragile. TJ looked torn and reached out to Cyrus who lurched backwards out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve told you. I found out yesterday at your house. I accidentally saw your tumblr open on your laptop. I was scared that it would change things so I kept quiet. Please Cyrus. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d TJ rushed out, taking a few hesitant steps towards Cyrus as he was talking. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Cyrus felt a sharp pain in his chest and it felt like all of the oxygen had been sucked out of the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 knew? Wow\u2026 I thought you were the one person I could count on.\u201d Cyrus whispered, breaking eye contact to look down at his shoes. \u201cYou should\u2019ve just told me Teej.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would end like this. And besides, your new \u2018lemon boy\u2019 needs you. How was breakfast this morning by the way?\u201d TJ asked, his voice taking on a cold tone. Cyrus\u2019 jaw dropped and he quickly looked up, using both hands to shove the other boy back harshly.</p><p>\u201cReally? I have never been interested in Ander you dumbass! It\u2019s you! It\u2019s always been you\u2026\u201d With that being said, Cyrus turned and began walking away from the basketball player.</p><p>\u201cWait! Cy.. I\u2019m sorry I-\u201d TJ began before Cyrus turned around and cut him off.</p><p>\u201cNo Teej- Or should I start calling you Tristian? Why not both. I need space just please\u2026 Let me have space. We can talk tomorrow.\u201d Cyrus called out, his voice coming out harsh and broken. TJ reached out for him before dropping his hand as Cyrus shook his head and turned, walking in the direction of his house as he clenched his fists. </p><p><i>All I ever wanted was you</i>.</p><p>______</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWCc_CNp9PSRF2zHkrGjgMA\">@allicat-76</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFpn01oF_3Z0JCz_Ed8akAg\">@sarcasticfirehazard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzZAlWwcfNTSp9L1vQjFQWA\">@alyxandraz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msgmVldMz-UWhM8wd-BY9OQ\">@unprofessionalart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFoWz4t0AbgGgKk8zvard-Q\">@tyrus-is-endgame-fight-me</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF0rvc8aW2Lop5jme_Yh3JQ\">@emmy2024riggs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NX239JtN_CMubnhz2do_A\">@tyrusvibes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2B3wx0U51bmVrAdzDczOrg\">@heart-eyes-kippen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meUWCp5upJMOnRbGLOzvcxw\">@theobligatedklutz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgVm8Pc3MonEYWh2t5hGiIQ\">@cyrus-greatman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSDsAqAjup6HmdL0soQiolg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSDsAqAjup6HmdL0soQiolg\">@bittertyrus</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD-vEa7CPjILYvP06dkr9YA\">@tyrusmuff1n</a></p>",

Can I ask you a question?\u201d TJ asked, his face taking on an expression Cyrus couldn\u2019t quite decipher. <i>Wait- When did he start calling me Cy?</i></p><p>\u201cYou have me a little worried here, but yeah sure. Go ahead. I\u2019m all ears.\u201d He said softly, sliding his hands into his pocket as he studied the taller boys face. He watched TJ bite his lip and tilt his head to the side before looking away.</p><p>\u201cUh- nevermind, thank you for being here for me.\u201d TJ mumbled, giving him a half smile before turning and walking back to where he had just come from. <i>Huh\u2026 That was weird\u2026</i> Pulling out his phone, he went directly to the Tumblr app to see if Tristian had messaged him back. Nothing.</p><p>Furrowing his brows, he opened the conversation and sat back down in his chair, thinking about what exactly to say.</p><p><b>Cy: Hey Tris, I might be IA for a little while. Lemon\u2019s mom got in an accident and I know he needs me right now, though he might not admit it to me. </b></p><p>Reading over his message, he nodded slightly before hitting send and shoving his phone back in his pocket.</p><p>Sliding down in his seat, Cyrus rested his head against the back of the chair while closing his eyes. As he sat there, his mind began drifting back to his conversation with TJ. <i>When did he start calling me Cy?</i></p><p>Sitting up quickly, Cyrus gasped while pulling out his phone, heading directly to his tumblr page. <i>TJ saw my post about him on tumblr</i> he thought vaguely, pressing his hand against his mouth.</p><p><i>If he saw it, why didn\u2019t he say anything?</i> Furrowing his brows, he looked up, scanning the room around him to see if he could catch a glimpse of his best friend. Seeing him walking back towards him, Cyrus stood up, walking quickly over to the taller boy.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I know this isn\u2019t the best time, with your mom being hurt and all\u2026 but earlier, when you were at my desk um, did you happen to see anything on my laptop?\u201d Towards the end of his sentence, his voice began fading out, unsure of what the response would be. TJ\u2019s smiled faltered, but then went back to normal although Cyrus could see a hidden emotion hiding in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUh, no. I don\u2019t think so. Why? Did you leave your diary open?\u201d TJ asked, his voice taking on a teasing edge.<i> Oh if only you knew\u2026</i> Cyrus plastered a smile on his face and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh. No. Just embarrassing baby pictures. Just wanted to make sure you didn\u2019t see the picture of three-year-old me running around the backyard naked Timothy Jimothy.\u201d Cyrus lightly patted the other boys shoulder before laughing at his confused expression.</p><p>\u201cNow where did you come up with that one Underdog?\u201d TJ asked, raising his brow while smirking slightly. <i>Wow this boy really gets the butterflies going\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cOh Troy J-Bolton, you will never know what\u2019s going on inside my head.\u201d TJ groaned at the name Cyrus said before playing rolling his eyes and ruffling the younger boys hair.</p><p>\u201cReally Cy? Comparing me to Troy Bolton? What all because we both play basketball?\u201d Cyrus bit his lip to keep himself from laughing too hard and shook his head, glancing down at his feet then back up at the green eyed boy. </p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s because you\u2019re both the unfairly attractive basketball captain.\u201d Blushing at his own words, Cyrus quickly looked away, coughing to cover up what he had just said. Suddenly he felt a hand on his cheek and he looked back to the boy in front of him who had an unreadable expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you aren\u2019t so bad yourself Underdog.\u201d TJ whispered, his eyes drifting to Cyrus\u2019 lips, causing the brown haired boys breath to get caught in his throat. <i>It would be so easy to just lean in. So easy to just close that distance and-</i></p><p>Cyrus\u2019 thoughts were cut off by someone clearing their throat behind the two boys, causing them to jump apart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to ruin your moment, but mom is asking for you Teej.\u201d Amber said softly, an apologetic look crossing her face as her eyes drifted from her brother to her new friend. Giving her a forgiving smile, he turned to TJ, wrapping his arms around the boys waist in a hug.</p><p>\u201cI should probably get going anyways. I still have to go to school in the morning and Ander is picking me up early so we can go to breakfast.\u201d Cyrus said softly, his face buried in TJ\u2019s chest. Suddenly all heat left him as TJ stepped back, a pained expression on his face before it was carefully covered up with a neutral expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah, wouldn\u2019t want to be tired for your date. You know, you should totally ask him out. I can tell he\u2019s into you. See you later Cyrus.\u201d TJ said coldly before turning and walking back towards him moms room, leaving a confused Cyrus and an annoyed Amber behind.</p><p>____________</p><p>The next morning Cyrus sat in his bed, his phone sitting atop his thigh as he waited for his usual good morning text from his best friend. Realizing it wasn\u2019t going to come, he swallowed the lump in his throat before getting up to start getting dressed for breakfast.<i> Did TJ really mean what he said?</i></p><p>Hearing his phone chime as he pulled his sweater on, Cyrus dove at his bed before picking up his phone and sighing softly at the notification. <i>Oh, it\u2019s just Ander.</i> Unlocking his phone, he opened his messages with the older boy. One thing he learned about Ander that he didn\u2019t expect was that the boy was a year older than TJ, two years older than himself. </p><p><b>Ander: Hey Cy. I just wanted to let you know I\u2019m outside. Can\u2019t wait to see your cute face.</b></p><p>Pursing his lips, Cyrus read over the text before frowning slightly. Shouldn\u2019t I feel something with him calling me cute? I should feel like I do when TJ calls me Underdog or Muffin.</p><p><b>Cyrus: Alright, see you in a minute bud.</b> \u00a0Laughing at his blatant awkwardness, Cyrus stuffed his phone in his pocket before grabbing his bag and heading downstairs to get in the car of the boy he had no interest in. </p><p>______</p><p>\u201cSo Cy, how was breakfast?\u201d Jonah asked lightly when he saw the brown haired boy at lunch later that day. Cyrus sighed, pushing his tray away from him as he laid his head on the table in front of him.</p><p>\u201cA disaster. Well- for me it was. He asked me out on another date and even though my head was screaming no, my mouth said yes. I didn\u2019t have the heart to take it back when I saw how happy he got.\u201d Cyrus mumbled, the words being smothered by his arms. He heard whispering and looked up to find Andi talking to Jonah, occasionally glancing at Cyrus. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 What about TJ?\u201d Andi asked hesitantly, tucking a stray piece of hair behind her ear. Cyrus sighed and shook his head, pulling out his phone as it vibrates.</p><p><b>Tristian: Oh wow, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It\u2019s crazy though, my mom is in the hospital because she got into a car accident too.</b></p><p>Cyrus gasped as he read the message over and over before looking up at Andi. </p><p>\u201cTristian\u2019s mom got into a car accident just like TJ\u2019s. So now not only do I have to be there for TJ but I have to be there for Tristian too because they both need my support.\u201d He said softly while pouting, his friends exchanging an incredulous look before Buffy starts laughing.</p><p>\u201cCy\u2026 I mean this in the nicest way possible, but how oblivious can you be?\u201d She asked, her eyes widening as she gestured widely towards him. Furrowing his brows in confusion, he glanced down at his phone that back up at his friends, at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cWhat could you possibly mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, typing out a quick reply to Tristian before shoving his phone back into his pocket to give his friends his full attention. Jonah tilted his head as he studied his friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m oblivious, but even I\u2019m not that oblivious. Really Cy? TJ\u2019s mom gets in a car accident. Tristian James\u2019 mom gets in a car accident. TJ\u2026 Tristian James. Really Cy? You haven\u2019t figured it out yet?\u201d Jonah said softly, reaching forward to place his hand on Cyrus\u2019 forearm. <i>No. No way. This is too crazy.</i></p><p>\u201cWhy do you guys have to do this\u2026 I was happy. I didn\u2019t need you guys putting these ideas into my head!\u201d Cyrus suddenly burst out of his seat, staring at his friends with tears in his eyes. Grabbing his bag, he headed toward the exit, not once looking back at his friends.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, he dialed the one person he wanted to talk to right now.</p><p>\u201cUnderdog? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in school?\u201d As soon as his best friends voice filled his ear he calmed down, slowing down his pace from a near run to a slow walk, his feet carrying him in the direction of the swings.</p><p>\u201cTeej\u2026 Can you meet me at the swings?\u201d He hated the way his voice cracked in the middle of his sentence, but he couldn\u2019t help it. Holding his breath he waited for the other boy to respond. He heard shuffling and hushed voices on the other end and became concerned the answer would be no. </p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes and we can talk about whatever is bothering you. I\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to see you because there\u2019s something I need to tell you. Bye Muffin.\u201d Hanging up the phone, Cyrus smiled briefly as he continued his walk to the park. Glancing down at his phone, the notification he saw made him stop in his tracks.</p><p><b>Tristian: I said \u201cI swing\u201d. I think if he can accept me after that, this won\u2019t be a big deal.</b></p><p><b>Tristian: Shit wrong chat. Ignore that.</b></p><p><i>That\u2019s what TJ said to me when he came out\u2026 </i>\u00a0Holding his breath, Cyrus typed out his reply, biting his lip before he pressed send. </p><p><b>Cy: TJ Kippen\u2026 I swear if this is you and you knew but didn\u2019t tell me\u2026 Please tell me this either isn\u2019t you or you didn\u2019t know. Please.</b></p><p>Releasing a shaky breath, Cyrus began walking towards the park again, only this time at a slower pace. Feeling his phone vibrate, Cyrus decided to ignore it until he arrived at the swings, allowing himself time to calm down and get his breathing back to normal.</p><p>\u201cCyrus\u2026\u201d Somehow the older boy had beat him to the park and from the looks of it -sweat on his forehead, his breath coming out in short little gasps- he had run there. Approaching the swings, TJ stood up in front of Cyrus and for the first time in a long time, made him feel small.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t know. I could handle it if you didn\u2019t know.\u201d Cyrus said, his voice sounding small and fragile. TJ looked torn and reached out to Cyrus who lurched backwards out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve told you. I found out yesterday at your house. I accidentally saw your tumblr open on your laptop. I was scared that it would change things so I kept quiet. Please Cyrus. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d TJ rushed out, taking a few hesitant steps towards Cyrus as he was talking. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Cyrus felt a sharp pain in his chest and it felt like all of the oxygen had been sucked out of the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 knew? Wow\u2026 I thought you were the one person I could count on.\u201d Cyrus whispered, breaking eye contact to look down at his shoes. \u201cYou should\u2019ve just told me Teej.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would end like this. And besides, your new \u2018lemon boy\u2019 needs you. How was breakfast this morning by the way?\u201d TJ asked, his voice taking on a cold tone. Cyrus\u2019 jaw dropped and he quickly looked up, using both hands to shove the other boy back harshly.</p><p>\u201cReally? I have never been interested in Ander you dumbass! It\u2019s you! It\u2019s always been you\u2026\u201d With that being said, Cyrus turned and began walking away from the basketball player.</p><p>\u201cWait! Cy.. I\u2019m sorry I-\u201d TJ began before Cyrus turned around and cut him off.</p><p>\u201cNo Teej- Or should I start calling you Tristian? Why not both. I need space just please\u2026 Let me have space. We can talk tomorrow.\u201d Cyrus called out, his voice coming out harsh and broken. TJ reached out for him before dropping his hand as Cyrus shook his head and turned, walking in the direction of his house as he clenched his fists. </p><p><i>All I ever wanted was you</i>.</p><p>______</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWCc_CNp9PSRF2zHkrGjgMA\">@allicat-76</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFpn01oF_3Z0JCz_Ed8akAg\">@sarcasticfirehazard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzZAlWwcfNTSp9L1vQjFQWA\">@alyxandraz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msgmVldMz-UWhM8wd-BY9OQ\">@unprofessionalart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFoWz4t0AbgGgKk8zvard-Q\">@tyrus-is-endgame-fight-me</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF0rvc8aW2Lop5jme_Yh3JQ\">@emmy2024riggs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NX239JtN_CMubnhz2do_A\">@tyrusvibes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2B3wx0U51bmVrAdzDczOrg\">@heart-eyes-kippen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meUWCp5upJMOnRbGLOzvcxw\">@theobligatedklutz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgVm8Pc3MonEYWh2t5hGiIQ\">@cyrus-greatman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSDsAqAjup6HmdL0soQiolg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSDsAqAjup6HmdL0soQiolg\">@bittertyrus</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD-vEa7CPjILYvP06dkr9YA\">@tyrusmuff1n</a></p>",

He was acutely aware that every few minutes she would gently place her hand on his knee to stop him from anxiously bouncing his leg up and down, but as soon as she took her hand away, his leg was bouncing again.<br></p><p>The only thing he could vaguely hear was shuffling feet and far away beeps and blips of various machines, some even keeping the people around him alive. <i>Please let TJ\u2019s mom be okay\u2026</i> He thought desperately as he put his head in his hands, his elbows on his knees. </p><p>Suddenly the world burst with sound as familiar sneakers entered his vision as he sprung out of his seat, nearly knocking TJ over in the process.</p><p>\u201cWoah Underdog, careful.\u201d TJ said softly as he placed his hands on Cyrus\u2019 waist to steady him, causing the younger boys face to flush in the process as he awkwardly coughed and stepped back, away from his touch.</p><p>\u201cAny news? I was going to get you food or something to drink but I wasn\u2019t sure where the vending machines were but I also wanted to be here when you came out to see if there was any news and-\u201d Cyrus had begun rambling and he quickly stopped his sentence, taking in a deep breath while glancing up as TJ\u2019s face. <i>Oh no, I hate seeing him cry\u2026</i> He thought, resisting the urge to reach his hand up and brush away the stray tears that were still on his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay. Minor cuts and bruises and they want to keep her overnight because she has a concussion, but they said she got lucky.\u201d TJ said softly, the biggest smile spreading across his face as he spoke. Before he could stop himself, Cyrus was launching himself forward, wrapping his arms around the basketball players shoulders while nearly knocking him off his feet in the process.</p><p>\u201cOh! That is such amazing news Teej. I\u2019m so so happy for you.\u201d Cyrus cried out, a tiny giggle falling from his lips as he held his friend tightly.

I should feel like I do when TJ calls me Underdog or Muffin.</p><p><b>Cyrus: Alright, see you in a minute bud.</b> \u00a0Laughing at his blatant awkwardness, Cyrus stuffed his phone in his pocket before grabbing his bag and heading downstairs to get in the car of the boy he had no interest in. </p><p>______</p><p>\u201cSo Cy, how was breakfast?\u201d Jonah asked lightly when he saw the brown haired boy at lunch later that day. Cyrus sighed, pushing his tray away from him as he laid his head on the table in front of him.</p><p>\u201cA disaster. Well- for me it was. He asked me out on another date and even though my head was screaming no, my mouth said yes. I didn\u2019t have the heart to take it back when I saw how happy he got.\u201d Cyrus mumbled, the words being smothered by his arms. He heard whispering and looked up to find Andi talking to Jonah, occasionally glancing at Cyrus. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 What about TJ?\u201d Andi asked hesitantly, tucking a stray piece of hair behind her ear. Cyrus sighed and shook his head, pulling out his phone as it vibrates.</p><p><b>Tristian: Oh wow, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It\u2019s crazy though, my mom is in the hospital because she got into a car accident too.</b></p><p>Cyrus gasped as he read the message over and over before looking up at Andi. </p><p>\u201cTristian\u2019s mom got into a car accident just like TJ\u2019s. So now not only do I have to be there for TJ but I have to be there for Tristian too because they both need my support.\u201d He said softly while pouting, his friends exchanging an incredulous look before Buffy starts laughing.</p><p>\u201cCy\u2026 I mean this in the nicest way possible, but how oblivious can you be?\u201d She asked, her eyes widening as she gestured widely towards him. Furrowing his brows in confusion, he glanced down at his phone that back up at his friends, at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cWhat could you possibly mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, typing out a quick reply to Tristian before shoving his phone back into his pocket to give his friends his full attention. Jonah tilted his head as he studied his friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m oblivious, but even I\u2019m not that oblivious. Really Cy? TJ\u2019s mom gets in a car accident. Tristian James\u2019 mom gets in a car accident. TJ\u2026 Tristian James. Really Cy? You haven\u2019t figured it out yet?\u201d Jonah said softly, reaching forward to place his hand on Cyrus\u2019 forearm. <i>No. No way. This is too crazy.</i></p><p>\u201cWhy do you guys have to do this\u2026 I was happy. I didn\u2019t need you guys putting these ideas into my head!\u201d Cyrus suddenly burst out of his seat, staring at his friends with tears in his eyes. Grabbing his bag, he headed toward the exit, not once looking back at his friends.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, he dialed the one person he wanted to talk to right now.</p><p>\u201cUnderdog? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in school?\u201d As soon as his best friends voice filled his ear he calmed down, slowing down his pace from a near run to a slow walk, his feet carrying him in the direction of the swings.</p><p>\u201cTeej\u2026 Can you meet me at the swings?\u201d He hated the way his voice cracked in the middle of his sentence, but he couldn\u2019t help it. Holding his breath he waited for the other boy to respond. He heard shuffling and hushed voices on the other end and became concerned the answer would be no. </p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes and we can talk about whatever is bothering you. I\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to see you because there\u2019s something I need to tell you. Bye Muffin.\u201d Hanging up the phone, Cyrus smiled briefly as he continued his walk to the park. Glancing down at his phone, the notification he saw made him stop in his tracks.</p><p><b>Tristian: I said \u201cI swing\u201d. I think if he can accept me after that, this won\u2019t be a big deal.</b></p><p><b>Tristian: Shit wrong chat. Ignore that.</b></p><p><i>That\u2019s what TJ said to me when he came out\u2026 </i>\u00a0Holding his breath, Cyrus typed out his reply, biting his lip before he pressed send. </p><p><b>Cy: TJ Kippen\u2026 I swear if this is you and you knew but didn\u2019t tell me\u2026 Please tell me this either isn\u2019t you or you didn\u2019t know. Please.</b></p><p>Releasing a shaky breath, Cyrus began walking towards the park again, only this time at a slower pace. Feeling his phone vibrate, Cyrus decided to ignore it until he arrived at the swings, allowing himself time to calm down and get his breathing back to normal.</p><p>\u201cCyrus\u2026\u201d Somehow the older boy had beat him to the park and from the looks of it -sweat on his forehead, his breath coming out in short little gasps- he had run there. Approaching the swings, TJ stood up in front of Cyrus and for the first time in a long time, made him feel small.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t know. I could handle it if you didn\u2019t know.\u201d Cyrus said, his voice sounding small and fragile. TJ looked torn and reached out to Cyrus who lurched backwards out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve told you. I found out yesterday at your house. I accidentally saw your tumblr open on your laptop. I was scared that it would change things so I kept quiet. Please Cyrus. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d TJ rushed out, taking a few hesitant steps towards Cyrus as he was talking. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Cyrus felt a sharp pain in his chest and it felt like all of the oxygen had been sucked out of the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 knew? Wow\u2026 I thought you were the one person I could count on.\u201d Cyrus whispered, breaking eye contact to look down at his shoes. \u201cYou should\u2019ve just told me Teej.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would end like this. And besides, your new \u2018lemon boy\u2019 needs you. How was breakfast this morning by the way?\u201d TJ asked, his voice taking on a cold tone. Cyrus\u2019 jaw dropped and he quickly looked up, using both hands to shove the other boy back harshly.</p><p>\u201cReally? I have never been interested in Ander you dumbass! It\u2019s you! It\u2019s always been you\u2026\u201d With that being said, Cyrus turned and began walking away from the basketball player.</p><p>\u201cWait! Cy.. I\u2019m sorry I-\u201d TJ began before Cyrus turned around and cut him off.</p><p>\u201cNo Teej- Or should I start calling you Tristian? Why not both. I need space just please\u2026 Let me have space. We can talk tomorrow.\u201d Cyrus called out, his voice coming out harsh and broken. TJ reached out for him before dropping his hand as Cyrus shook his head and turned, walking in the direction of his house as he clenched his fists. </p><p><i>All I ever wanted was you</i>.</p><p>______</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWCc_CNp9PSRF2zHkrGjgMA\">@allicat-76</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFpn01oF_3Z0JCz_Ed8akAg\">@sarcasticfirehazard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzZAlWwcfNTSp9L1vQjFQWA\">@alyxandraz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msgmVldMz-UWhM8wd-BY9OQ\">@unprofessionalart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFoWz4t0AbgGgKk8zvard-Q\">@tyrus-is-endgame-fight-me</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF0rvc8aW2Lop5jme_Yh3JQ\">@emmy2024riggs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NX239JtN_CMubnhz2do_A\">@tyrusvibes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2B3wx0U51bmVrAdzDczOrg\">@heart-eyes-kippen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meUWCp5upJMOnRbGLOzvcxw\">@theobligatedklutz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgVm8Pc3MonEYWh2t5hGiIQ\">@cyrus-greatman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSDsAqAjup6HmdL0soQiolg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSDsAqAjup6HmdL0soQiolg\">@bittertyrus</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD-vEa7CPjILYvP06dkr9YA\">@tyrusmuff1n</a></p>",
                "content": "<p>Thank you to my bet <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhgZcS55PjFVfNudaxoATsw\">@judgemental-llama</a> I love and appreciate you so much!! here is the link to the full story on AO3:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17193416/chapters/40427129\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17193416/chapters/40427129</a></p><p>Everything appeared to be in slow motion as Cyrus sat in the waiting room of the hospital, his mom beside him. He was acutely aware that every few minutes she would gently place her hand on his knee to stop him from anxiously bouncing his leg up and down, but as soon as she took her hand away, his leg was bouncing again.<br /></p><p>The only thing he could vaguely hear was shuffling feet and far away beeps and blips of various machines, some even keeping the people around him alive. <i>Please let TJ&rsquo;s mom be okay&hellip;</i> He thought desperately as he put his head in his hands, his elbows on his knees. </p><p>Suddenly the world burst with sound as familiar sneakers entered his vision as he sprung out of his seat, nearly knocking TJ over in the process.</p><p>&ldquo;Woah Underdog, careful.&rdquo; TJ said softly as he placed his hands on Cyrus&rsquo; waist to steady him, causing the younger boys face to flush in the process as he awkwardly coughed and stepped back, away from his touch.</p><p>&ldquo;Any news? I was going to get you food or something to drink but I wasn&rsquo;t sure where the vending machines were but I also wanted to be here when you came out to see if there was any news and-&rdquo; Cyrus had begun rambling and he quickly stopped his sentence, taking in a deep breath while glancing up as TJ&rsquo;s face. <i>Oh no, I hate seeing him cry&hellip;</i> He thought, resisting the urge to reach his hand up and brush away the stray tears that were still on his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s okay. Minor cuts and bruises and they want to keep her overnight because she has a concussion, but they said she got lucky.&rdquo; TJ said softly, the biggest smile spreading across his face as he spoke. Before he could stop himself, Cyrus was launching himself forward, wrapping his arms around the basketball players shoulders while nearly knocking him off his feet in the process.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! That is such amazing news Teej. I&rsquo;m so so happy for you.&rdquo; Cyrus cried out, a tiny giggle falling from his lips as he held his friend tightly. Feeling TJ snake his arms around his waist, Cyrus blushed darkly, hiding his face in the taller boys neck momentarily before stepping away.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Cy? Can I ask you a question?&rdquo; TJ asked, his face taking on an expression Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t quite decipher. <i>Wait- When did he start calling me Cy?</i></p><p>&ldquo;You have me a little worried here, but yeah sure. Go ahead. I&rsquo;m all ears.&rdquo; He said softly, sliding his hands into his pocket as he studied the taller boys face. He watched TJ bite his lip and tilt his head to the side before looking away.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh- nevermind, thank you for being here for me.&rdquo; TJ mumbled, giving him a half smile before turning and walking back to where he had just come from. <i>Huh&hellip; That was weird&hellip;</i> Pulling out his phone, he went directly to the Tumblr app to see if Tristian had messaged him back. Nothing.</p><p>Furrowing his brows, he opened the conversation and sat back down in his chair, thinking about what exactly to say.</p><p><b>Cy: Hey Tris, I might be IA for a little while. Lemon&rsquo;s mom got in an accident and I know he needs me right now, though he might not admit it to me. </b></p><p>Reading over his message, he nodded slightly before hitting send and shoving his phone back in his pocket.</p><p>Sliding down in his seat, Cyrus rested his head against the back of the chair while closing his eyes. As he sat there, his mind began drifting back to his conversation with TJ. <i>When did he start calling me Cy?</i></p><p>Sitting up quickly, Cyrus gasped while pulling out his phone, heading directly to his tumblr page. <i>TJ saw my post about him on tumblr</i> he thought vaguely, pressing his hand against his mouth.</p><p><i>If he saw it, why didn&rsquo;t he say anything?</i> Furrowing his brows, he looked up, scanning the room around him to see if he could catch a glimpse of his best friend. Seeing him walking back towards him, Cyrus stood up, walking quickly over to the taller boy.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so I know this isn&rsquo;t the best time, with your mom being hurt and all&hellip; but earlier, when you were at my desk um, did you happen to see anything on my laptop?&rdquo; Towards the end of his sentence, his voice began fading out, unsure of what the response would be. TJ&rsquo;s smiled faltered, but then went back to normal although Cyrus could see a hidden emotion hiding in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, no. I don&rsquo;t think so. Why? Did you leave your diary open?&rdquo; TJ asked, his voice taking on a teasing edge.<i> Oh if only you knew&hellip;</i> Cyrus plastered a smile on his face and shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. No. Just embarrassing baby pictures. Just wanted to make sure you didn&rsquo;t see the picture of three-year-old me running around the backyard naked Timothy Jimothy.&rdquo; Cyrus lightly patted the other boys shoulder before laughing at his confused expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Now where did you come up with that one Underdog?&rdquo; TJ asked, raising his brow while smirking slightly. <i>Wow this boy really gets the butterflies going&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh Troy J-Bolton, you will never know what&rsquo;s going on inside my head.&rdquo; TJ groaned at the name Cyrus said before playing rolling his eyes and ruffling the younger boys hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Really Cy? Comparing me to Troy Bolton? What all because we both play basketball?&rdquo; Cyrus bit his lip to keep himself from laughing too hard and shook his head, glancing down at his feet then back up at the green eyed boy. </p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re both the unfairly attractive basketball captain.&rdquo; Blushing at his own words, Cyrus quickly looked away, coughing to cover up what he had just said. Suddenly he felt a hand on his cheek and he looked back to the boy in front of him who had an unreadable expression on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;And you aren&rsquo;t so bad yourself Underdog.&rdquo; TJ whispered, his eyes drifting to Cyrus&rsquo; lips, causing the brown haired boys breath to get caught in his throat. <i>It would be so easy to just lean in. So easy to just close that distance and-</i></p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; thoughts were cut off by someone clearing their throat behind the two boys, causing them to jump apart.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to ruin your moment, but mom is asking for you Teej.&rdquo; Amber said softly, an apologetic look crossing her face as her eyes drifted from her brother to her new friend. Giving her a forgiving smile, he turned to TJ, wrapping his arms around the boys waist in a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;I should probably get going anyways. I still have to go to school in the morning and Ander is picking me up early so we can go to breakfast.&rdquo; Cyrus said softly, his face buried in TJ&rsquo;s chest. Suddenly all heat left him as TJ stepped back, a pained expression on his face before it was carefully covered up with a neutral expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, wouldn&rsquo;t want to be tired for your date. You know, you should totally ask him out. I can tell he&rsquo;s into you. See you later Cyrus.&rdquo; TJ said coldly before turning and walking back towards him moms room, leaving a confused Cyrus and an annoyed Amber behind.</p><p>____________</p><p>The next morning Cyrus sat in his bed, his phone sitting atop his thigh as he waited for his usual good morning text from his best friend. Realizing it wasn&rsquo;t going to come, he swallowed the lump in his throat before getting up to start getting dressed for breakfast.<i> Did TJ really mean what he said?</i></p><p>Hearing his phone chime as he pulled his sweater on, Cyrus dove at his bed before picking up his phone and sighing softly at the notification. <i>Oh, it&rsquo;s just Ander.</i> Unlocking his phone, he opened his messages with the older boy. One thing he learned about Ander that he didn&rsquo;t expect was that the boy was a year older than TJ, two years older than himself. </p><p><b>Ander: Hey Cy. I just wanted to let you know I&rsquo;m outside. Can&rsquo;t wait to see your cute face.</b></p><p>Pursing his lips, Cyrus read over the text before frowning slightly. Shouldn&rsquo;t I feel something with him calling me cute? I should feel like I do when TJ calls me Underdog or Muffin.</p><p><b>Cyrus: Alright, see you in a minute bud.</b> &nbsp;Laughing at his blatant awkwardness, Cyrus stuffed his phone in his pocket before grabbing his bag and heading downstairs to get in the car of the boy he had no interest in. </p><p>______</p><p>&ldquo;So Cy, how was breakfast?&rdquo; Jonah asked lightly when he saw the brown haired boy at lunch later that day. Cyrus sighed, pushing his tray away from him as he laid his head on the table in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;A disaster. Well- for me it was. He asked me out on another date and even though my head was screaming no, my mouth said yes. I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to take it back when I saw how happy he got.&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, the words being smothered by his arms. He heard whispering and looked up to find Andi talking to Jonah, occasionally glancing at Cyrus. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip; What about TJ?&rdquo; Andi asked hesitantly, tucking a stray piece of hair behind her ear. Cyrus sighed and shook his head, pulling out his phone as it vibrates.</p><p><b>Tristian: Oh wow, I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. It&rsquo;s crazy though, my mom is in the hospital because she got into a car accident too.</b></p><p>Cyrus gasped as he read the message over and over before looking up at Andi. </p><p>&ldquo;Tristian&rsquo;s mom got into a car accident just like TJ&rsquo;s. So now not only do I have to be there for TJ but I have to be there for Tristian too because they both need my support.&rdquo; He said softly while pouting, his friends exchanging an incredulous look before Buffy starts laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Cy&hellip; I mean this in the nicest way possible, but how oblivious can you be?&rdquo; She asked, her eyes widening as she gestured widely towards him.

Tristian James&rsquo; mom gets in a car accident. TJ&hellip; Tristian James. Really Cy? You haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet?&rdquo; Jonah said softly, reaching forward to place his hand on Cyrus&rsquo; forearm. <i>No. No way. This is too crazy.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Why do you guys have to do this&hellip; I was happy. I didn&rsquo;t need you guys putting these ideas into my head!&rdquo; Cyrus suddenly burst out of his seat, staring at his friends with tears in his eyes. Grabbing his bag, he headed toward the exit, not once looking back at his friends.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, he dialed the one person he wanted to talk to right now.</p><p>&ldquo;Underdog? Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be in school?&rdquo; As soon as his best friends voice filled his ear he calmed down, slowing down his pace from a near run to a slow walk, his feet carrying him in the direction of the swings.</p><p>&ldquo;Teej&hellip; Can you meet me at the swings?&rdquo; He hated the way his voice cracked in the middle of his sentence, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it.
