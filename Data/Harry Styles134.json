Harry held your hand in the ambulance car. You tried not thinking about the worst. You arrived in the hospital and they immediately took you away. Harry stood there alone. He didn\u2019t know who to call because others didn\u2019t know about the pregnancy. He called Sara though. She arrived in a half an hour, just when the doctor came to Harry.</p><p>\u201cMr. Styles\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife is in a room now, resting. I am so sorry to tell you this but she had a miscarriage.\u201d This was the thing Harry didn\u2019t want to hear. Sara started crying and walked away.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come back later to tell the whys?\u201d the doctor asked Harry.</p><p>\u201cNo, please, tell me now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat you need to understand first, that this wasn\u2019t her fault or your fault. There was no sign of an accident that would\u2019ve caused it. You need to know that this happens often. She had never been pregnant before. It\u2019s called anembryonic pregnancy. What it means is that the fertilized egg attached to the wall of her uterus, and while it may have begun to develop a placenta, it didn\u2019t develop into an embryo.\u201d he heard the words but it was hard to understand while holding back the tears.</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. She\u2019s up\u201d Harry walked to the door and made himself open it. You laid there and looked at him as he came in. Tears automatically came out of your eyes. Harry cried too. He sat down on your bed and hugged you as you sat up to reach him. It was a couple of minutes until you parted.</p><p>\u201cI love you\u201d he breathed out.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d you said back.</p><p>That was one thing that you were sure of, that you\u2019ll go through it together. You stayed in the hospital for a few days before going back home. You looked into the sitting room and you saw Harry removed the blanket.</p><p>\u201cI threw it away\u201d he looked down.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to rest now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to cook, would you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>You two packed your stuff away that was in the hospital with you. Then you changed into more comfortable clothes just like Harry. You two started cooking and it was silent first, but then Harry accidentally dropped flour on you. It was all over on your face, on your apron, in the air. There was a moment of silence and Harry wanted to apologize, but you started laughing and threw some flour on him. It indicated a little fight and by the end, you were sitting on the floor with Harry in front of the oven watching the chicken being baked and talking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it all day,\u201d you said. \u201cI want to be happy again. I want to give my love to my child if I get pregnant again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine what you\u2019re going through\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same as you, it was our baby. It was yours too\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was in your body not mine\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I guess the pain is similar\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very\u2026 intense&hellip;yes\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you and you\u2019re here for me.\u201d you turned a bit to face him. You kissed him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an incredible woman and I\u2019m proud to be your husband.\u201d</p><p>After you finished eating you were waiting for Harry to do the dishes. You were on the internet looking for something to distract you. It wasn\u2019t always easy especially when you decided to tell your parents and Harry\u2019s family too. It was hard for everyone. Or when you found the tiny baby shoes that you told about your pregnancy with. But Harry was there. It took two weeks to get back to work but it was good. It made you go out and interact with people. Your doctor recommended a support group and gave you some numbers. You decided to go to one of their meetings with Harry. It looked like in the movies, there were chairs around and someone managed the whole thing. It was a nice woman called Abby. She was happy that you came with your husband because it was mostly just the mothers who came to these meetings. There was another husband though. When it started Abby asked you if you want to share your story, because you\u2019re the newest. It was a bit hard because it was Harry Styles we are talking about. You knew some of them recognized him and neither your pregnancy and your miscarriage was on the news.</p><p>\u201cHi, my name is y/n,\u201d you said and they greeted you.</p><p>\u201cI came with my husband and I know that these meetings are based on integrity, but I\u2019d like to ask for some more privacy.\u201d Some of them nodded. \u201cI found out I was pregnant a month ago. First pregnancy, I was really excited because we wanted the baby. We were both so happy. I was five weeks pregnant then. Two weeks later I started bleeding at home and my stomach hurt really bad. I was taken into the hospital and the doctor said I had a miscarriage. We were both really broken because I never thought it could happen. I am so grateful for my husband because I know that it\u2019s hard for him too. But thankfully we can talk about it when it\u2019s time and we can do other things when we want. Uhm\u2026 Thank you!\u201d you stood up and sat back to your chair. In the other one hour, you listened to others\u2019 stories and you cried a lot. But it definitely helped both of you. Knowing that you\u2019re not alone with this. Many women, many parents are going through it. Next week the doctor examined you and said that you are able to get pregnant again if you want to. When you got back home you talked about it with Harry. You agreed to try again when you feel like it. You were also back in the studio and both of yours albums were already recorded and waited to get published. You decided to release your albums on the same day in August. You were determined to be healthier. You started working out to be in a good shape. You mostly went to the gym with Harry. You stuffed the fridge and the kitchen with healthy food. You changed your lifestyle to be healthier for the baby and for yourself too. Harry was a total supporter.</p><p>Two weeks later you got a call from Sara.</p><p>\u201cI have amazing news for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon Cowell wants to meet you personally\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you heard it. Well, it\u2019s not known who will be the X-Factor judges this year so I have a wild guess and say that he wants you to be one\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI arranged a meeting for tomorrow\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sara! Text me the address\u201d</p><p>Next day you met him in the X-Factor offices, in his office to be precise. Maybe Sara was right.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Styles, it\u2019s so nice to meet you again\u201d he greeted you.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Mr. Cowell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon, please\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen y/n, please\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if you have any idea why I asked you to come here\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my manager had a wild idea that you want me to be an X-Factor judge\u201d you chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s pretty damn clever then.\u201d your eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYou really want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to ask you and go through all the details before you say anything\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said and he told you everything. It sounded all so exciting, but you didn\u2019t want to make a decision without Harry. So you asked for a few days to think about it. As you got home and told all about it to Harry, he was excited too. So you decided to accept it and occupy yourself until the next baby Styles might arrive. Little did you know that one of your best friends will be a judge with you. The one and only Louis Tomlinson.</p>",

You looked into the sitting room and you saw Harry removed the blanket.</p><p>\u201cI threw it away\u201d he looked down.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to rest now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to cook, would you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>You two packed your stuff away that was in the hospital with you. Then you changed into more comfortable clothes just like Harry. You two started cooking and it was silent first, but then Harry accidentally dropped flour on you. It was all over on your face, on your apron, in the air. There was a moment of silence and Harry wanted to apologize, but you started laughing and threw some flour on him. It indicated a little fight and by the end, you were sitting on the floor with Harry in front of the oven watching the chicken being baked and talking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it all day,\u201d you said. \u201cI want to be happy again. I want to give my love to my child if I get pregnant again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine what you\u2019re going through\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same as you, it was our baby.

You kissed him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an incredible woman and I\u2019m proud to be your husband.\u201d</p><p>After you finished eating you were waiting for Harry to do the dishes. You were on the internet looking for something to distract you. It wasn\u2019t always easy especially when you decided to tell your parents and Harry\u2019s family too. It was hard for everyone. Or when you found the tiny baby shoes that you told about your pregnancy with. But Harry was there. It took two weeks to get back to work but it was good. It made you go out and interact with people. Your doctor recommended a support group and gave you some numbers. You decided to go to one of their meetings with Harry. It looked like in the movies, there were chairs around and someone managed the whole thing. It was a nice woman called Abby. She was happy that you came with your husband because it was mostly just the mothers who came to these meetings. There was another husband though. When it started Abby asked you if you want to share your story, because you\u2019re the newest. It was a bit hard because it was Harry Styles we are talking about. You knew some of them recognized him and neither your pregnancy and your miscarriage was on the news.</p><p>\u201cHi, my name is y/n,\u201d you said and they greeted you.</p><p>\u201cI came with my husband and I know that these meetings are based on integrity, but I\u2019d like to ask for some more privacy.\u201d Some of them nodded. \u201cI found out I was pregnant a month ago. First pregnancy, I was really excited because we wanted the baby. We were both so happy. I was five weeks pregnant then. Two weeks later I started bleeding at home and my stomach hurt really bad. I was taken into the hospital and the doctor said I had a miscarriage. We were both really broken because I never thought it could happen. I am so grateful for my husband because I know that it\u2019s hard for him too. But thankfully we can talk about it when it\u2019s time and we can do other things when we want. Uhm\u2026 Thank you!\u201d you stood up and sat back to your chair. In the other one hour, you listened to others\u2019 stories and you cried a lot. But it definitely helped both of you. Knowing that you\u2019re not alone with this. Many women, many parents are going through it. Next week the doctor examined you and said that you are able to get pregnant again if you want to. When you got back home you talked about it with Harry. You agreed to try again when you feel like it. You were also back in the studio and both of yours albums were already recorded and waited to get published. You decided to release your albums on the same day in August. You were determined to be healthier. You started working out to be in a good shape. You mostly went to the gym with Harry. You stuffed the fridge and the kitchen with healthy food. You changed your lifestyle to be healthier for the baby and for yourself too. Harry was a total supporter.</p><p>Two weeks later you got a call from Sara.</p><p>\u201cI have amazing news for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon Cowell wants to meet you personally\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you heard it. Well, it\u2019s not known who will be the X-Factor judges this year so I have a wild guess and say that he wants you to be one\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI arranged a meeting for tomorrow\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sara! Text me the address\u201d</p><p>Next day you met him in the X-Factor offices, in his office to be precise. Maybe Sara was right.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Styles, it\u2019s so nice to meet you again\u201d he greeted you.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Mr. Cowell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon, please\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen y/n, please\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if you have any idea why I asked you to come here\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my manager had a wild idea that you want me to be an X-Factor judge\u201d you chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s pretty damn clever then.\u201d your eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYou really want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to ask you and go through all the details before you say anything\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said and he told you everything. It sounded all so exciting, but you didn\u2019t want to make a decision without Harry. So you asked for a few days to think about it. As you got home and told all about it to Harry, he was excited too. So you decided to accept it and occupy yourself until the next baby Styles might arrive. Little did you know that one of your best friends will be a judge with you. The one and only Louis Tomlinson.</p>",

Well, it&rsquo;s not known who will be the X-Factor judges this year so I have a wild guess and say that he wants you to be one&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I arranged a meeting for tomorrow&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sara! Text me the address&rdquo;</p><p>Next day you met him in the X-Factor offices, in his office to be precise. Maybe Sara was right.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Styles, it&rsquo;s so nice to meet you again&rdquo; he greeted you.</p><p>&ldquo;You too, Mr. Cowell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Simon, please&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then y/n, please&rdquo;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have any idea why I asked you to come here&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, my manager had a wild idea that you want me to be an X-Factor judge&rdquo; you chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s pretty damn clever then.&rdquo; your eyes widened.</p><p>&ldquo;You really want that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to ask you and go through all the details before you say anything&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you said and he told you everything. It sounded all so exciting, but you didn&rsquo;t want to make a decision without Harry. So you asked for a few days to think about it. As you got home and told all about it to Harry, he was excited too. So you decided to accept it and occupy yourself until the next baby Styles might arrive. Little did you know that one of your best friends will be a judge with you. The one and only Louis Tomlinson.</p>",
