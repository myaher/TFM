And so, she would have Jasmine stay over as often as she could, and then would let Eric stay over at different times so she got quality time with each of them. The tradition had started when Y/N was still at university, where she would invite her younger siblings to hers for the night every so often so they could spend time together-even with her parents not being fully into the idea of their 12 year old children staying at their sister\u2019s university house where people would drink often. Though Y/N had set a house rule that whenever the twins were visiting, no one could smoke or drink in or around the house, and everyone understood and appreciated the rule so there was never any issue.</p><p>When Y/N bought her house in Kensington, however, she could have her siblings stay over more often which was a blessing for both her and her parents. It allowed her to see her siblings more often and allowed her parents to have an evening to themselves and keep their romance alive. One of her biggest fears was that her parents would split because they didn\u2019t get to spend much time together, and so, she took her siblings out of the house every now and then to allow them their quality time.</p><p>\u201cI like Harry.\u201d Y/N turned to her sister who sat opposite her on the singular chair of the living room. A blanket wrapped around her body and her head leaning against a cushion she had taken from the sofa where Y/N sat.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, he\u2019s lovely.\u201d Jasmine turned to her sister with a soft smirk, her facial features almost mirroring her big sister. She watched as Y/N started to grow uncomfortable under her stare, pulling the blanket further up her body and under her chin. \u201cAdores you, too.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Jasmine may have been young, but she wasn\u2019t na\u00efve, she say the way Harry looked at Y/N when she answered the door to him. She say the way he wrapped his arms around her and held her tight for longer than a normal hug would last. And, she definitely saw the way that his eyes lingered on her lips for a millisecond before he pulled away. Jasmine made sure to sit on the single chair when she found out that Harry would be \u2018crashing\u2019 girls\u2019 night as Y/N had said it, so that her sister could sit next to Harry.</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Y/N turned her attention back to the TV which played 10 Things I Hate About You-the film that always got shown when the sisters were together. Her heart rate increased thinking about Harry who had offered to collect their Chinese food for them rather than waiting for delivery.</p><p>\u201cY/N, the first thing he did when he walked through the door was wrap his arms around you. He held you so freaking tight and the smile on his face was like the one dad gives to mum when he sees her. He bloody adores you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing things.\u201d Y/N pulled the blanket off her slightly so she could bring her knees to her chest and rest her chin on them. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like him though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not like him?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked to her sister in offence, her eyes wide and mouth parted lightly.</p><p>\u201cObviously I do! That\u2019s why I asked if you would mine him coming and crashing girls\u2019 night.\u201d Jasmine nodded, removing the blanket that was around her body so she could get her drink that sat on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cIf you like him enough to let him come over when it\u2019s girls\u2019 night-which I don\u2019t mind because he\u2019s lovely and it\u2019s good to see you really happy-, then you must like him enough to get into a relationship with him.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s attention was turned back to the TV as she though about Jasmine\u2019s words. She had asked if he wanted to spend the night when she knew her sister would be there. They\u2019d kissed before and it was nice, and he\u2019d stopped over at her house numerous times since she\u2019d gotten back from New York. So why weren\u2019t they in a relationship? What was holding them back?</p><p>\u201cBug, you\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re bluffing.\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes at her little sister who just laughed under her breath, getting herself comfortable once more in her seat and turning her attention to the TV, thinking that she had won the discussion.</p><p>\u201cEven if I did like him that way, he doesn\u2019t feel the same so you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep telling yourself that.\u201d</p><p>The sisters fell into a comfortable silence as the film played before them. Y/N\u2019s attention wasn\u2019t fully on the film before her though. No, it was on Harry. She\u2019d known the man for a mere three months and she was certain that she had feelings for him but she wasn\u2019t sure if he felt the same. And if he did feel the same, how the <i>fuck </i>was she meant to tell him or start something with him? She\u2019d never experienced something like that and it was scaring her to think about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be cute if someone were to do such a grand gesture in real life. Like he liked her enough to hijack the school sound system to ask her to prom.\u201d Y/N\u2019s attention finally turned back to the TV where Heath Ledger\u2019s character-Patrick Verona- was singing \u2018Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off of You\u2019 while running away from campus security. Jasmine was fixated on the screen with a smile playing at her lips while Y/N took a deep breath and smiled at her younger sister. Truth be told, that was always her favourite scene of the film, because it showed that the cold-hearted guy you first met in the film was starting to warm up to the girl he\u2019d been paid to date.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved this scene. Heath Ledger deserved better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we agreeing on?\u201d Y/N looked up from the TV to find Harry stood in the doorway with two bags of Chinese food and a soft smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cHeath Ledger deserved better than to die so young.\u201d Harry nodded as he put the bags on the table before her.</p><p>\u201cOh, he did! I come baring food so we can\u2019t get too emotional about him. I\u2019ll go grab some plates and cutlery.\u201d Before he could move from his spot, Jasmine had stood up and made her way to the doorway, telling Harry to sit down and that she would get them.</p><p>\u201cDo either of you want a drink while I\u2019m out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVodka tonic, please.\u201d Harry and Y/N looked at each other with a chuckled while Jasmine shook her head, walking out of the room with a \u2018made for each other\u2019 under her breath which made Harry turn to Y/N with furrowed brows.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, ignore her.\u201d</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>Y/N stood at her side of the bed, moving the cushions from it and putting them on the floor next to her, preparing herself to get in bed. Harry walked out from the bathroom with his jogger shorts on and no top, standing awkwardly in the doorway and looking at the girl he had started to grow attached to. He watched the way she reached across the bed to move the abundance of cushions that were housed there, swearing that they were all necessary. He watched as the hem of her t-shirt raised with each stress, showing off a tiny bit of her belly and causing his belly to flutter. He liked Y/N, that much was true. He knew that she must feel the same way because she\u2019s always been cosy with him and wanted to be around him. He just didn\u2019t know how to start anything.</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you want to do this?\u201d Harry\u2019s left hand came up to brush the hair away from his face, staying at the back of his head for a few moments before he moved it and watched as Y/N furrowed her brows.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep?\u201d She opened her mouth in realisation, setting the last pillow on the floor before standing facing Harry and rubbing at the back of her neck quickly.</p><p>\u201cPreferably under covers and on a mattress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Harry chuckled while Y/N smiled at him, walking around the bed to stand in front of him, his head coming to lean down so he could see her.</p><p>\u201cYou can have the mattress if you\u2019d prefer, but I assumed you\u2019d just share my bed. It\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t done it before.\u201d</p><p>Harry took a deep breath, feeling Y/N\u2019s hand come to grab onto his, squeezing it lightly before looking up at him with the smile that drove him wild.</p><p>\u201cWould it not be awkward after\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you make it awkward. It happened and I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d Y/N could see the slight smile that Harry had when he looked into her eyes, his tongue poking out of his lips quickly before retreating back to where it belonged.</p><p>\u201cOkay, cool.\u201d Y/N laughed at him before walking back to her side of the bed and climbing in once she\u2019d removed her pyjama bottoms, getting herself comfy before Harry joined her.</p><p>As they lay in the bed together, Y/N faced Harry with her hands in the middle of them both. Harry\u2019s left hand was under his right hand and his right sat just underneath Y/N\u2019s with the very tips of his fingers brushing against her palm. They were comfortable together, enjoying one another\u2019s presence in a way neither of them knew to be possible.</p><p>\u201cHarry, go to sleep.\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes were closed, but she knew that Harry\u2019s were open, and watching her intently as she tried to go to sleep.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Her eyes remained closed as she spoke to Harry, hearing the pout in his voice as he whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cBecause every time I close my eyes, I picture kissing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Harry suddenly felt rather uneasy as he spoke. He wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d let that information out, or what Y/N would think of it, but when she replied, peeling her eyes open slowly with a sly smile on her face as she did, his heart rate picked up like crazy.</p><p>\u201cKiss me then\u2026\u201d</p><p>The hands that were once situated comfortably under him came to cup Y/N\u2019s cheeks, their eyes locked with the other\u2019s as they watched each other intently. Y/N took a deep breath as Harry leaned towards her, pressing his forehead against hers and closing his eyes. When his lips brushed against hers, her breathing hitched and she froze for a few seconds. It\u2019d been a while since they shared their first kiss, but it was just as amazing as the first time. Harry\u2019s lips soft against hers as he pressed them together, savouring her and not wanting the moment to end.</p><p>With her eyes closed, Y/N blindly moved her hand down between their bodies that were closer than they had been when they first got into bed, brushing her finger tips against his cock, feeling him stiffen under her and causing her to smirk into the kiss. She didn\u2019t know why she wanted to do that, what made her do it. All she knew is that she wanted to, and she hoped to God that Harry wanted to as well.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes opened to see Y/N looking back at him with a serious yet flirty look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start something you can\u2019t finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, I can finish it alright.\u201d She pressed a little harder and watched his eyes roll back into his head softly. The look almost causing her to move too quickly, but she knew that she wanted to tease him, to give everything to him in a way she never had with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be quiet for me, Harry. Jasmine\u2019s in the next room and she already thinks that something\u2019s going on between us.\u201d</p><p>Y/N felt weird starting something when her little sister was in the room next door, but she couldn\u2019t help it. Everything about Harry drew her in and she didn\u2019t know how to stop it. She gripped his cock fully over his sweats and watched as his breathing picked up, the muscle in her hands tightening as she held it. Her lips came back to press against, Harry\u2019s, only with more pressure and more hunger.</p><p>\u201cI dunno if I\u2019m going to be able to be quiet, angel. You\u2019re only holding me and I\u2019m ready to bust.\u201d Y/N laughed into his neck, feeling his chest rise with each breath.</p><p>\u201cWow, Harry. I\u2019ll let you go then.\u201d As her hands removed itself from his crotch and came to rest on his cheek, Harry pouted and caused Y/N to laugh once more. \u201cPatience, Harry. We\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>Soft kisses were pressed to his bare chest, over each swallow that sat on his collarbones, down to the butterfly that sat upon his tummy; to the ferns that were poking up from his sweats. That\u2019s where her lips stopped though, her head coming up to find Harry looking down at her in eagerness.</p><p>\u201cPlease, do something. I can\u2019t cope anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want me to do, Harry.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t believe the words that were leaving the girl\u2019s mouth. The girl he had viewed as innocent the entire time he\u2019d known her.</p><p>\u201cI want your mouth, please.\u201d His breathy begs were almost enough for Y/N to give in and do what he wanted, but she wanted to have a little fun of her own. And so, she pushed one hand into his bottoms as her mouth came to nibble lightly as the skin of his chest, sucking as she did and grabbing his dick once more, stroking it lightly and feeling his hips buck up into her hand.</p><p>\u201cNone of that. I\u2019ll help you out soon enough, but your chest looks so good that I want to mark every inch of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d The pair laughed with one another and Y/N attached her lips to Harry\u2019s chest once more and left one more mark, Harry groaning at the feeling.</p><p>When Y/N was satisfied with her work on his chest, she clambered down the bed quickly, Harry\u2019s eyes watching her intently as she pulled at the waistband of his bottoms before letting them go and hit the bottom of his stomach. He couldn\u2019t say anything before she started pulling them down his legs, laughing when he tried to throw his head back onto the pillows but hit the headboard behind him instead. His hand rubbed at the sore spot as Y/N giggled at him, kissing his thighs and bringing her hand up to touch where he wanted her to. He loud out an audible gasp when she fully took it into her hand, stroking him a few times before using her thumb to spread the precum that had started to form at the head. With what was left on her thumb, she brought up to her mouth of licked it clean, winking at a shaken Harry.</p><p>His eyes wouldn\u2019t leave hers as he watched her bring her mouth to his dick, kissing the head so lightly he almost didn\u2019t feel it, but he did, and it felt amazing. Her tongue swiped from the base all the way up before circling the tip and causing his eyes to roll back. His hands came to cup her cheeks as she sunk down on him, taking him as far as she could and using her hands to stroke at the bits that she couldn\u2019t get to. She felt amazing and Harry couldn\u2019t help but close his eyes tightly, moving his hands to the back of her head where he bunched her har up lightly and helped her create a good rhythm.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N. That feels so good.\u201d</p><p>She moaned around him and caused his hips to buck up and his dick to hit the back of her throat. She started to gag on him and pulled off with a cough, her eyes watering and her breathing fast.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m so sorry! I didn\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s fine. Just caught me off guard.\u201d Harry pulled the girl back up the bed to lay on him, wrapping his arms around her body and pulling her close, pressing his lips to hers and tasting himself on her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t finished yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby, but I want to cum in you, if you want me to.\u201d Y/N nodded eagerly, Harry chuckling at her before turning them over so he was hovering over her with his hands at either side of her head. She opened her legs for him to fit into easier and watched as he attached his lips to the part of her chest that had been uncovered by her top. \u201cMy God, let me get this thing off you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N helped Harry remove her top, sitting up for him to pull over her head and throw into the room somewhere, causing her to shake her head at him.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you eager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re involved, I\u2019ll always be eager. Wanted to do this the moment I first met you.\u201d His lips attached to her right nipple, kissing it softly before running his tongue over the growing pebble, Y/N\u2019s head hitting the pillow underneath her while Harry tended to her.</p><p>\u201cGod, Harry. Your tongue is so good.\u201d He looked up to her with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Want me to show you what it\u2019s really good for?\u201d She nodded quickly, smiling back at him and gripping onto his hair.</p><p>Harry copied Y/N\u2019s previous movements and clambered down the bed until he got to her pants. He ran his finger under the waistband and watched as she squirmed under him, her bottom lip pouting as she did.</p><p>\u201cPatience, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off trying to copy me.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss just above her pelvis and watched as her mouth opened before he started to pull her pants down, kissing down her left leg as he did, then kissing up her right one until his breath fanned against where she needed him most.</p><p>\u201cThank god I shaved yesterday.\u201d They both laughed before Harry ran finger up her folds, collecting the juices and making her body jerk when it brushed past her clit. \u201cFucking hell, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I did was run one finger over your clit and this is how you react? I think you\u2019re going to need to bite onto something to keep yourself quiet, poppet.\u201d Y/N smacked him around the head lightly before throwing her head back when his finger found it\u2019s way back to her fold and started to rub light circles upon her clit once more, her hips moving in time with him. \u201cNo moving, just let me please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d It was almost a whisper and it made his heart burst. She was being so vulnerable with him and he felt great knowing that he could be the person to make her feel good.</p><p>When his lips attached themselves to her bundle and he pressed a finger into her, she was a goner. Writhing and moaning underneath him with his hand having to come and cover her mouth to prevent her from waking her sister up.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell, love, you taste so good. I\u2019m going to take such good care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>Jasmine sat in the living room with Y/N when Harry walked downstairs, his body covered with bottoms and a top and a sloppy smile on his face as he looked at Y/N. She sat in the same place that she had the day before, covered by a blanket with her eyes glued to the TV where Friends played. Harry sat next to her and watched as she moved the blanket to cover them both, grabbing his hands and smiling up at him with a deep sigh. He pressed a kiss to her forehead just as Jasmine turned to look at them with a smile.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Her older sister peered around Harry with a smile, licking her lips as she did. \u201cWhat are we doing for breakfast today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. What are you fancying?\u201d Jasmine shrugged, watching as Harry turned his attention to the girls.</p><p>\u201cHow about I drive us to get something? There\u2019s a brunch place I like near Central.\u201d Y/N turned to her younger sister who nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cYes please, Harry. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, if we get ready now then we can leave soon. It\u2019ll not be too busy at this time.\u201d The girls nodded to him before standing up and running up the stairs to get ready.</p><p>Harry entered Y/N\u2019s bedroom just as she had pulled her pyjama top over her frame, his arms wrapping around her body and holding her close to him for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t regret last night, do you?\u201d Y/N looked up at him with furrowed brows, bringing her hands to press against his cheeks where she felt the stubble starting to grow.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I regret it? It was everything I\u2019d ever imagined, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I just thought for some reason that you\u2019d have decided that it shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, I\u2019m glad it happened. Part of me wishes it happened sooner than it did.\u201d Harry smiled at the girl before bringing his lips down to press against hers quickly, pulling away just as fast and watching as she kept her eyes closed for a few seconds once he\u2019d pulled away, opening them with a shy smile before he pecked her lips once more and let go of her body so she could continue getting ready.</p><p>\u201cMe too. But we need to get ready so hop to it.\u201d They chuckled before Y/N pulled on Harry\u2019s top from the day before, a white t-shirt with a picture of the earth on the chest and the words \u2018You\u2019re Out of This World\u2019 wrapped around it. She tucked it into her black jogger styles trousers that held a white stripe down each leg and grabbed her grey cardigan from the end of the bed to throw over her shoulders. \u201cWow, already stealing my clothes?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded with a smirk, wrapping her arms around Harry\u2019s body and pulling him close to her, feeling the buttons of his shirt pressing into her own body.</p><p>\u201cYep, problem with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>Jasmine sat opposite her sister and Harry, watching them look through their menu with smiles on their faces. She wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew what they were doing the night before and as much as it freaked her out at first, she threw her earphones in and almost found herself smiling because she hadn\u2019t seen her sister so happy in a long while.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s hand rested upon Harry\u2019s bicep as she looked at the menu he was holding in his hand and every now and then his left hand would reach up and grab hers, rubbing his thumb over her knuckles softly. They mulled over the menu for a little longer before Y/N turned to Jasmine and furrowed her brows when she caught her staring.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided what you want, bug?\u201d Jasmine nodded, putting her phone on the table and smiling at her sister.</p><p>\u201cI really fancy the strawberry waffles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to get. Harry? What do you fancy?\u201d Harry perused the menu once more before closing it and turning to the girl he found himself falling for.</p><p>\u201cI might get the same, nothing\u2019s really jumping out at me today. Also, it\u2019s on me. I\u2019m the one who decided that we should come here so it\u2019s only fair I pay.\u201d Y/N widened her eyes at him, removing her arm from his and turning her body to face him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you pay for it! You bought the Chinese food last night so it\u2019s only fair that I pay for this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, love. Let me treat you both, please.\u201d Y/N simple smiled as she took a sip of the water that was on the table for them all to share. \u201cThank you. Now are you both definitely wanting the strawberry waffles?\u201d The two girls nodded and watched as Harry walked to the counter to order and pay for their food.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling at, bug?\u201d Jasmine nodded her head towards Harry before turning back to her big sister.</p><p>\u201cOne, I\u2019m not stupid about what happened last night and-\u201c, Y/N\u2019s eyes widened and she flung her head into her hands and put them on the table, groaning to herself and hearing her sister laugh from her spot. \u201cand two, I see the way you look at each other. Have you finally started a bloody relationship? Because if not, it\u2019s about god damn time you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, it\u2019s a good job mum isn\u2019t here with that language, two, we haven\u2019t started anything, and I don\u2019t know if we even well. And three, what exactly did you hear last night?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine shook her head lightly as she laughed, watching Y/N squirm in her seat in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot, I put my earphones in. And as weird as it was for me to hear the beginnings of-I\u2019m never going to let you live that down, by the way- I\u2019m happy that you were comfortable enough to \u2018get some\u2019.\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at her little sister. Never once had she heard such things leave her mouth and as much as she wanted to cry with laughter at the way it was said, she also couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly dumbfounded by it.</p><p>\u201cCan we stop talking about my sex life-or prior lack of- while we\u2019re in a caf\u00e9 please? Actually, let\u2019s never talk about it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy that you did though?\u201d Y/N nodded with a small smile, taking a deep breath and another sip of water as Jasmine turned her attention to her phone.</p><p>\u201cI am. Also, you didn\u2019t have to put your earphones in. You could have come and knocked on the door and just ruined the mood, you know.\u201d</p><p>The sisters laughed together while Harry was stood watching them from the counter. He never thought that he\u2019d be falling for a girl like Y/N, but he was so glad that he was. Stood waiting for the coffee he had ordered, he watched the two girls he\u2019d left at the table interacting and Y/N\u2019s smile never leaving her face, even when her head was down on the</p><p>table in her hands. Even when the coffee had been brought back to him, he stayed where he had been standing, watching the two interact.</p><p>He thoroughly enjoyed the way that Y/N had stolen his t-shirt that day, tucking it into her trousers and pairing it with her cardigan, a very \u2018him\u2019 outfit as he would normally say. The sleeves on the arms had been too long for her and so he spent a few moments rolling them up before they left the house, feeling the soft skin of her arm on his fingers and the goose bumps that arose when he ran them down her arms when he had finished.</p><p>Even on the car ride to the caf\u00e9, he kept stealing glances at her, and he knew that Jasmine was watching the entire time, but he didn\u2019t care. He knew that Jasmine was aware of the situation with Y/N\u2019s previous boyfriend and wanted to show her that he was a good guy and that he had her best interests at heart.</p><p>As he walked back to the table, he heard some of their conversation and his lips twitched into a silent laugh when he sat down.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019ve heard mum and dad \u2018get it on\u2019 so many times that my earphones have become my muse on a night time.\u201d Y/N\u2019s face turned to press into Harry\u2019s shoulder, and he laughed at her before placing a cup of coffee in front of her and watching as she smiled and took the first sip, closing her eyes at the taste.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing we weren\u2019t as quiet as we tried to be last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2019s saying. I\u2019m never going to love this down.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine watched with an amused smile as Harry cupped Y/N\u2019s face and brought it down so he could press a kiss to her forehead, before she saw her sister look up at him and press her lips to his own in a soft kiss. Seeing her sister happy was something that she\u2019d always wanted, for being able to look up to a relationship of her sister\u2019s too was something she never thought would be possible.</p><p>When the pair pulled away Harry gave Y/N a tiny wink before removing his hands and turning back to Jasmine who couldn\u2019t help the smile that was plastered on her face.</p><p>\u201cCan you two get married already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get married to her when she\u2019s not my girlfriend first, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouche. Well can you two get into a relationship already then. And then get married! Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed while Harry wrapped his arm around Y/N\u2019s shoulders and pulled her into him softly, rubbing the top of her arm and enjoying having her close.</p><p>How could he ask her to be his girlfriend when they pretty much acted like a couple already?</p><p><b><i>Taglist\u00a0</i></b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_f9sWNpbqjTMBslOhfnyPg\">@hforhome</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW891toEGmqEa1RcHOPiB2w\">@brielyse11</a> @rubytersteege <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqKWWy9Bdm9HFGCLpCkqnXA\">@stylesfantasy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvHlEXq4_tWGVkMYtH06aQ\">@talk-british-2-me-britbritharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a></p>",

She watched as Y/N started to grow uncomfortable under her stare, pulling the blanket further up her body and under her chin. \u201cAdores you, too.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Jasmine may have been young, but she wasn\u2019t na\u00efve, she say the way Harry looked at Y/N when she answered the door to him. She say the way he wrapped his arms around her and held her tight for longer than a normal hug would last. And, she definitely saw the way that his eyes lingered on her lips for a millisecond before he pulled away. Jasmine made sure to sit on the single chair when she found out that Harry would be \u2018crashing\u2019 girls\u2019 night as Y/N had said it, so that her sister could sit next to Harry.</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Y/N turned her attention back to the TV which played 10 Things I Hate About You-the film that always got shown when the sisters were together. Her heart rate increased thinking about Harry who had offered to collect their Chinese food for them rather than waiting for delivery.</p><p>\u201cY/N, the first thing he did when he walked through the door was wrap his arms around you. He held you so freaking tight and the smile on his face was like the one dad gives to mum when he sees her. He bloody adores you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing things.\u201d Y/N pulled the blanket off her slightly so she could bring her knees to her chest and rest her chin on them. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like him though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not like him?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked to her sister in offence, her eyes wide and mouth parted lightly.</p><p>\u201cObviously I do! That\u2019s why I asked if you would mine him coming and crashing girls\u2019 night.\u201d Jasmine nodded, removing the blanket that was around her body so she could get her drink that sat on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cIf you like him enough to let him come over when it\u2019s girls\u2019 night-which I don\u2019t mind because he\u2019s lovely and it\u2019s good to see you really happy-, then you must like him enough to get into a relationship with him.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s attention was turned back to the TV as she though about Jasmine\u2019s words. She had asked if he wanted to spend the night when she knew her sister would be there. They\u2019d kissed before and it was nice, and he\u2019d stopped over at her house numerous times since she\u2019d gotten back from New York. So why weren\u2019t they in a relationship? What was holding them back?</p><p>\u201cBug, you\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re bluffing.\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes at her little sister who just laughed under her breath, getting herself comfortable once more in her seat and turning her attention to the TV, thinking that she had won the discussion.</p><p>\u201cEven if I did like him that way, he doesn\u2019t feel the same so you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep telling yourself that.\u201d</p><p>The sisters fell into a comfortable silence as the film played before them. Y/N\u2019s attention wasn\u2019t fully on the film before her though. No, it was on Harry. She\u2019d known the man for a mere three months and she was certain that she had feelings for him but she wasn\u2019t sure if he felt the same. And if he did feel the same, how the <i>fuck </i>was she meant to tell him or start something with him? She\u2019d never experienced something like that and it was scaring her to think about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be cute if someone were to do such a grand gesture in real life. Like he liked her enough to hijack the school sound system to ask her to prom.\u201d Y/N\u2019s attention finally turned back to the TV where Heath Ledger\u2019s character-Patrick Verona- was singing \u2018Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off of You\u2019 while running away from campus security. Jasmine was fixated on the screen with a smile playing at her lips while Y/N took a deep breath and smiled at her younger sister. Truth be told, that was always her favourite scene of the film, because it showed that the cold-hearted guy you first met in the film was starting to warm up to the girl he\u2019d been paid to date.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved this scene. Heath Ledger deserved better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we agreeing on?\u201d Y/N looked up from the TV to find Harry stood in the doorway with two bags of Chinese food and a soft smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cHeath Ledger deserved better than to die so young.\u201d Harry nodded as he put the bags on the table before her.</p><p>\u201cOh, he did! I come baring food so we can\u2019t get too emotional about him. I\u2019ll go grab some plates and cutlery.\u201d Before he could move from his spot, Jasmine had stood up and made her way to the doorway, telling Harry to sit down and that she would get them.</p><p>\u201cDo either of you want a drink while I\u2019m out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVodka tonic, please.\u201d Harry and Y/N looked at each other with a chuckled while Jasmine shook her head, walking out of the room with a \u2018made for each other\u2019 under her breath which made Harry turn to Y/N with furrowed brows.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, ignore her.\u201d</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>Y/N stood at her side of the bed, moving the cushions from it and putting them on the floor next to her, preparing herself to get in bed. Harry walked out from the bathroom with his jogger shorts on and no top, standing awkwardly in the doorway and looking at the girl he had started to grow attached to. He watched the way she reached across the bed to move the abundance of cushions that were housed there, swearing that they were all necessary. He watched as the hem of her t-shirt raised with each stress, showing off a tiny bit of her belly and causing his belly to flutter. He liked Y/N, that much was true. He knew that she must feel the same way because she\u2019s always been cosy with him and wanted to be around him. He just didn\u2019t know how to start anything.</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you want to do this?\u201d Harry\u2019s left hand came up to brush the hair away from his face, staying at the back of his head for a few moments before he moved it and watched as Y/N furrowed her brows.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep?\u201d She opened her mouth in realisation, setting the last pillow on the floor before standing facing Harry and rubbing at the back of her neck quickly.</p><p>\u201cPreferably under covers and on a mattress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Harry chuckled while Y/N smiled at him, walking around the bed to stand in front of him, his head coming to lean down so he could see her.</p><p>\u201cYou can have the mattress if you\u2019d prefer, but I assumed you\u2019d just share my bed. It\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t done it before.\u201d</p><p>Harry took a deep breath, feeling Y/N\u2019s hand come to grab onto his, squeezing it lightly before looking up at him with the smile that drove him wild.</p><p>\u201cWould it not be awkward after\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you make it awkward. It happened and I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d Y/N could see the slight smile that Harry had when he looked into her eyes, his tongue poking out of his lips quickly before retreating back to where it belonged.</p><p>\u201cOkay, cool.\u201d Y/N laughed at him before walking back to her side of the bed and climbing in once she\u2019d removed her pyjama bottoms, getting herself comfy before Harry joined her.</p><p>As they lay in the bed together, Y/N faced Harry with her hands in the middle of them both. Harry\u2019s left hand was under his right hand and his right sat just underneath Y/N\u2019s with the very tips of his fingers brushing against her palm. They were comfortable together, enjoying one another\u2019s presence in a way neither of them knew to be possible.</p><p>\u201cHarry, go to sleep.\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes were closed, but she knew that Harry\u2019s were open, and watching her intently as she tried to go to sleep.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Her eyes remained closed as she spoke to Harry, hearing the pout in his voice as he whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cBecause every time I close my eyes, I picture kissing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Harry suddenly felt rather uneasy as he spoke. He wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d let that information out, or what Y/N would think of it, but when she replied, peeling her eyes open slowly with a sly smile on her face as she did, his heart rate picked up like crazy.</p><p>\u201cKiss me then\u2026\u201d</p><p>The hands that were once situated comfortably under him came to cup Y/N\u2019s cheeks, their eyes locked with the other\u2019s as they watched each other intently. Y/N took a deep breath as Harry leaned towards her, pressing his forehead against hers and closing his eyes. When his lips brushed against hers, her breathing hitched and she froze for a few seconds. It\u2019d been a while since they shared their first kiss, but it was just as amazing as the first time. Harry\u2019s lips soft against hers as he pressed them together, savouring her and not wanting the moment to end.</p><p>With her eyes closed, Y/N blindly moved her hand down between their bodies that were closer than they had been when they first got into bed, brushing her finger tips against his cock, feeling him stiffen under her and causing her to smirk into the kiss. She didn\u2019t know why she wanted to do that, what made her do it. All she knew is that she wanted to, and she hoped to God that Harry wanted to as well.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes opened to see Y/N looking back at him with a serious yet flirty look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start something you can\u2019t finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, I can finish it alright.\u201d She pressed a little harder and watched his eyes roll back into his head softly. The look almost causing her to move too quickly, but she knew that she wanted to tease him, to give everything to him in a way she never had with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be quiet for me, Harry. Jasmine\u2019s in the next room and she already thinks that something\u2019s going on between us.\u201d</p><p>Y/N felt weird starting something when her little sister was in the room next door, but she couldn\u2019t help it. Everything about Harry drew her in and she didn\u2019t know how to stop it. She gripped his cock fully over his sweats and watched as his breathing picked up, the muscle in her hands tightening as she held it. Her lips came back to press against, Harry\u2019s, only with more pressure and more hunger.</p><p>\u201cI dunno if I\u2019m going to be able to be quiet, angel. You\u2019re only holding me and I\u2019m ready to bust.\u201d Y/N laughed into his neck, feeling his chest rise with each breath.</p><p>\u201cWow, Harry. I\u2019ll let you go then.\u201d As her hands removed itself from his crotch and came to rest on his cheek, Harry pouted and caused Y/N to laugh once more. \u201cPatience, Harry. We\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>Soft kisses were pressed to his bare chest, over each swallow that sat on his collarbones, down to the butterfly that sat upon his tummy; to the ferns that were poking up from his sweats. That\u2019s where her lips stopped though, her head coming up to find Harry looking down at her in eagerness.</p><p>\u201cPlease, do something. I can\u2019t cope anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want me to do, Harry.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t believe the words that were leaving the girl\u2019s mouth. The girl he had viewed as innocent the entire time he\u2019d known her.</p><p>\u201cI want your mouth, please.\u201d His breathy begs were almost enough for Y/N to give in and do what he wanted, but she wanted to have a little fun of her own. And so, she pushed one hand into his bottoms as her mouth came to nibble lightly as the skin of his chest, sucking as she did and grabbing his dick once more, stroking it lightly and feeling his hips buck up into her hand.</p><p>\u201cNone of that. I\u2019ll help you out soon enough, but your chest looks so good that I want to mark every inch of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d The pair laughed with one another and Y/N attached her lips to Harry\u2019s chest once more and left one more mark, Harry groaning at the feeling.</p><p>When Y/N was satisfied with her work on his chest, she clambered down the bed quickly, Harry\u2019s eyes watching her intently as she pulled at the waistband of his bottoms before letting them go and hit the bottom of his stomach. He couldn\u2019t say anything before she started pulling them down his legs, laughing when he tried to throw his head back onto the pillows but hit the headboard behind him instead. His hand rubbed at the sore spot as Y/N giggled at him, kissing his thighs and bringing her hand up to touch where he wanted her to. He loud out an audible gasp when she fully took it into her hand, stroking him a few times before using her thumb to spread the precum that had started to form at the head. With what was left on her thumb, she brought up to her mouth of licked it clean, winking at a shaken Harry.</p><p>His eyes wouldn\u2019t leave hers as he watched her bring her mouth to his dick, kissing the head so lightly he almost didn\u2019t feel it, but he did, and it felt amazing. Her tongue swiped from the base all the way up before circling the tip and causing his eyes to roll back. His hands came to cup her cheeks as she sunk down on him, taking him as far as she could and using her hands to stroke at the bits that she couldn\u2019t get to. She felt amazing and Harry couldn\u2019t help but close his eyes tightly, moving his hands to the back of her head where he bunched her har up lightly and helped her create a good rhythm.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N. That feels so good.\u201d</p><p>She moaned around him and caused his hips to buck up and his dick to hit the back of her throat. She started to gag on him and pulled off with a cough, her eyes watering and her breathing fast.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m so sorry! I didn\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s fine. Just caught me off guard.\u201d Harry pulled the girl back up the bed to lay on him, wrapping his arms around her body and pulling her close, pressing his lips to hers and tasting himself on her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t finished yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby, but I want to cum in you, if you want me to.\u201d Y/N nodded eagerly, Harry chuckling at her before turning them over so he was hovering over her with his hands at either side of her head. She opened her legs for him to fit into easier and watched as he attached his lips to the part of her chest that had been uncovered by her top. \u201cMy God, let me get this thing off you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N helped Harry remove her top, sitting up for him to pull over her head and throw into the room somewhere, causing her to shake her head at him.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you eager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re involved, I\u2019ll always be eager. Wanted to do this the moment I first met you.\u201d His lips attached to her right nipple, kissing it softly before running his tongue over the growing pebble, Y/N\u2019s head hitting the pillow underneath her while Harry tended to her.</p><p>\u201cGod, Harry. Your tongue is so good.\u201d He looked up to her with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Want me to show you what it\u2019s really good for?\u201d She nodded quickly, smiling back at him and gripping onto his hair.</p><p>Harry copied Y/N\u2019s previous movements and clambered down the bed until he got to her pants. He ran his finger under the waistband and watched as she squirmed under him, her bottom lip pouting as she did.</p><p>\u201cPatience, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off trying to copy me.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss just above her pelvis and watched as her mouth opened before he started to pull her pants down, kissing down her left leg as he did, then kissing up her right one until his breath fanned against where she needed him most.</p><p>\u201cThank god I shaved yesterday.\u201d They both laughed before Harry ran finger up her folds, collecting the juices and making her body jerk when it brushed past her clit. \u201cFucking hell, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I did was run one finger over your clit and this is how you react? I think you\u2019re going to need to bite onto something to keep yourself quiet, poppet.\u201d Y/N smacked him around the head lightly before throwing her head back when his finger found it\u2019s way back to her fold and started to rub light circles upon her clit once more, her hips moving in time with him. \u201cNo moving, just let me please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d It was almost a whisper and it made his heart burst. She was being so vulnerable with him and he felt great knowing that he could be the person to make her feel good.</p><p>When his lips attached themselves to her bundle and he pressed a finger into her, she was a goner. Writhing and moaning underneath him with his hand having to come and cover her mouth to prevent her from waking her sister up.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell, love, you taste so good. I\u2019m going to take such good care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>Jasmine sat in the living room with Y/N when Harry walked downstairs, his body covered with bottoms and a top and a sloppy smile on his face as he looked at Y/N. She sat in the same place that she had the day before, covered by a blanket with her eyes glued to the TV where Friends played. Harry sat next to her and watched as she moved the blanket to cover them both, grabbing his hands and smiling up at him with a deep sigh. He pressed a kiss to her forehead just as Jasmine turned to look at them with a smile.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Her older sister peered around Harry with a smile, licking her lips as she did. \u201cWhat are we doing for breakfast today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. What are you fancying?\u201d Jasmine shrugged, watching as Harry turned his attention to the girls.</p><p>\u201cHow about I drive us to get something? There\u2019s a brunch place I like near Central.\u201d Y/N turned to her younger sister who nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cYes please, Harry. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, if we get ready now then we can leave soon. It\u2019ll not be too busy at this time.\u201d The girls nodded to him before standing up and running up the stairs to get ready.</p><p>Harry entered Y/N\u2019s bedroom just as she had pulled her pyjama top over her frame, his arms wrapping around her body and holding her close to him for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t regret last night, do you?\u201d Y/N looked up at him with furrowed brows, bringing her hands to press against his cheeks where she felt the stubble starting to grow.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I regret it? It was everything I\u2019d ever imagined, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I just thought for some reason that you\u2019d have decided that it shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, I\u2019m glad it happened. Part of me wishes it happened sooner than it did.\u201d Harry smiled at the girl before bringing his lips down to press against hers quickly, pulling away just as fast and watching as she kept her eyes closed for a few seconds once he\u2019d pulled away, opening them with a shy smile before he pecked her lips once more and let go of her body so she could continue getting ready.</p><p>\u201cMe too. But we need to get ready so hop to it.\u201d They chuckled before Y/N pulled on Harry\u2019s top from the day before, a white t-shirt with a picture of the earth on the chest and the words \u2018You\u2019re Out of This World\u2019 wrapped around it. She tucked it into her black jogger styles trousers that held a white stripe down each leg and grabbed her grey cardigan from the end of the bed to throw over her shoulders. \u201cWow, already stealing my clothes?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded with a smirk, wrapping her arms around Harry\u2019s body and pulling him close to her, feeling the buttons of his shirt pressing into her own body.</p><p>\u201cYep, problem with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>Jasmine sat opposite her sister and Harry, watching them look through their menu with smiles on their faces. She wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew what they were doing the night before and as much as it freaked her out at first, she threw her earphones in and almost found herself smiling because she hadn\u2019t seen her sister so happy in a long while.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s hand rested upon Harry\u2019s bicep as she looked at the menu he was holding in his hand and every now and then his left hand would reach up and grab hers, rubbing his thumb over her knuckles softly. They mulled over the menu for a little longer before Y/N turned to Jasmine and furrowed her brows when she caught her staring.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided what you want, bug?\u201d Jasmine nodded, putting her phone on the table and smiling at her sister.</p><p>\u201cI really fancy the strawberry waffles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to get. Harry? What do you fancy?\u201d Harry perused the menu once more before closing it and turning to the girl he found himself falling for.</p><p>\u201cI might get the same, nothing\u2019s really jumping out at me today. Also, it\u2019s on me. I\u2019m the one who decided that we should come here so it\u2019s only fair I pay.\u201d Y/N widened her eyes at him, removing her arm from his and turning her body to face him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you pay for it! You bought the Chinese food last night so it\u2019s only fair that I pay for this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, love. Let me treat you both, please.\u201d Y/N simple smiled as she took a sip of the water that was on the table for them all to share. \u201cThank you. Now are you both definitely wanting the strawberry waffles?\u201d The two girls nodded and watched as Harry walked to the counter to order and pay for their food.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling at, bug?\u201d Jasmine nodded her head towards Harry before turning back to her big sister.</p><p>\u201cOne, I\u2019m not stupid about what happened last night and-\u201c, Y/N\u2019s eyes widened and she flung her head into her hands and put them on the table, groaning to herself and hearing her sister laugh from her spot. \u201cand two, I see the way you look at each other. Have you finally started a bloody relationship? Because if not, it\u2019s about god damn time you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, it\u2019s a good job mum isn\u2019t here with that language, two, we haven\u2019t started anything, and I don\u2019t know if we even well. And three, what exactly did you hear last night?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine shook her head lightly as she laughed, watching Y/N squirm in her seat in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot, I put my earphones in. And as weird as it was for me to hear the beginnings of-I\u2019m never going to let you live that down, by the way- I\u2019m happy that you were comfortable enough to \u2018get some\u2019.\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at her little sister. Never once had she heard such things leave her mouth and as much as she wanted to cry with laughter at the way it was said, she also couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly dumbfounded by it.</p><p>\u201cCan we stop talking about my sex life-or prior lack of- while we\u2019re in a caf\u00e9 please? Actually, let\u2019s never talk about it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy that you did though?\u201d Y/N nodded with a small smile, taking a deep breath and another sip of water as Jasmine turned her attention to her phone.</p><p>\u201cI am. Also, you didn\u2019t have to put your earphones in. You could have come and knocked on the door and just ruined the mood, you know.\u201d</p><p>The sisters laughed together while Harry was stood watching them from the counter. He never thought that he\u2019d be falling for a girl like Y/N, but he was so glad that he was. Stood waiting for the coffee he had ordered, he watched the two girls he\u2019d left at the table interacting and Y/N\u2019s smile never leaving her face, even when her head was down on the</p><p>table in her hands. Even when the coffee had been brought back to him, he stayed where he had been standing, watching the two interact.</p><p>He thoroughly enjoyed the way that Y/N had stolen his t-shirt that day, tucking it into her trousers and pairing it with her cardigan, a very \u2018him\u2019 outfit as he would normally say. The sleeves on the arms had been too long for her and so he spent a few moments rolling them up before they left the house, feeling the soft skin of her arm on his fingers and the goose bumps that arose when he ran them down her arms when he had finished.</p><p>Even on the car ride to the caf\u00e9, he kept stealing glances at her, and he knew that Jasmine was watching the entire time, but he didn\u2019t care. He knew that Jasmine was aware of the situation with Y/N\u2019s previous boyfriend and wanted to show her that he was a good guy and that he had her best interests at heart.</p><p>As he walked back to the table, he heard some of their conversation and his lips twitched into a silent laugh when he sat down.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019ve heard mum and dad \u2018get it on\u2019 so many times that my earphones have become my muse on a night time.\u201d Y/N\u2019s face turned to press into Harry\u2019s shoulder, and he laughed at her before placing a cup of coffee in front of her and watching as she smiled and took the first sip, closing her eyes at the taste.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing we weren\u2019t as quiet as we tried to be last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2019s saying. I\u2019m never going to love this down.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine watched with an amused smile as Harry cupped Y/N\u2019s face and brought it down so he could press a kiss to her forehead, before she saw her sister look up at him and press her lips to his own in a soft kiss. Seeing her sister happy was something that she\u2019d always wanted, for being able to look up to a relationship of her sister\u2019s too was something she never thought would be possible.</p><p>When the pair pulled away Harry gave Y/N a tiny wink before removing his hands and turning back to Jasmine who couldn\u2019t help the smile that was plastered on her face.</p><p>\u201cCan you two get married already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get married to her when she\u2019s not my girlfriend first, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouche. Well can you two get into a relationship already then. And then get married! Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed while Harry wrapped his arm around Y/N\u2019s shoulders and pulled her into him softly, rubbing the top of her arm and enjoying having her close.</p><p>How could he ask her to be his girlfriend when they pretty much acted like a couple already?</p><p><b><i>Taglist\u00a0</i></b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_f9sWNpbqjTMBslOhfnyPg\">@hforhome</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW891toEGmqEa1RcHOPiB2w\">@brielyse11</a> @rubytersteege <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqKWWy9Bdm9HFGCLpCkqnXA\">@stylesfantasy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvHlEXq4_tWGVkMYtH06aQ\">@talk-british-2-me-britbritharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a></p>",

And so, she would have Jasmine stay over as often as she could, and then would let Eric stay over at different times so she got quality time with each of them. The tradition had started when Y/N was still at university, where she would invite her younger siblings to hers for the night every so often so they could spend time together-even with her parents not being fully into the idea of their 12 year old children staying at their sister\u2019s university house where people would drink often. Though Y/N had set a house rule that whenever the twins were visiting, no one could smoke or drink in or around the house, and everyone understood and appreciated the rule so there was never any issue.</p><p>When Y/N bought her house in Kensington, however, she could have her siblings stay over more often which was a blessing for both her and her parents. It allowed her to see her siblings more often and allowed her parents to have an evening to themselves and keep their romance alive. One of her biggest fears was that her parents would split because they didn\u2019t get to spend much time together, and so, she took her siblings out of the house every now and then to allow them their quality time.</p><p>\u201cI like Harry.\u201d Y/N turned to her sister who sat opposite her on the singular chair of the living room. A blanket wrapped around her body and her head leaning against a cushion she had taken from the sofa where Y/N sat.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, he\u2019s lovely.\u201d Jasmine turned to her sister with a soft smirk, her facial features almost mirroring her big sister. She watched as Y/N started to grow uncomfortable under her stare, pulling the blanket further up her body and under her chin. \u201cAdores you, too.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Jasmine may have been young, but she wasn\u2019t na\u00efve, she say the way Harry looked at Y/N when she answered the door to him. She say the way he wrapped his arms around her and held her tight for longer than a normal hug would last. And, she definitely saw the way that his eyes lingered on her lips for a millisecond before he pulled away. Jasmine made sure to sit on the single chair when she found out that Harry would be \u2018crashing\u2019 girls\u2019 night as Y/N had said it, so that her sister could sit next to Harry.</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Y/N turned her attention back to the TV which played 10 Things I Hate About You-the film that always got shown when the sisters were together. Her heart rate increased thinking about Harry who had offered to collect their Chinese food for them rather than waiting for delivery.</p><p>\u201cY/N, the first thing he did when he walked through the door was wrap his arms around you. He held you so freaking tight and the smile on his face was like the one dad gives to mum when he sees her. He bloody adores you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing things.\u201d Y/N pulled the blanket off her slightly so she could bring her knees to her chest and rest her chin on them. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like him though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not like him?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked to her sister in offence, her eyes wide and mouth parted lightly.</p><p>\u201cObviously I do! That\u2019s why I asked if you would mine him coming and crashing girls\u2019 night.\u201d Jasmine nodded, removing the blanket that was around her body so she could get her drink that sat on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cIf you like him enough to let him come over when it\u2019s girls\u2019 night-which I don\u2019t mind because he\u2019s lovely and it\u2019s good to see you really happy-, then you must like him enough to get into a relationship with him.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s attention was turned back to the TV as she though about Jasmine\u2019s words. She had asked if he wanted to spend the night when she knew her sister would be there. They\u2019d kissed before and it was nice, and he\u2019d stopped over at her house numerous times since she\u2019d gotten back from New York. So why weren\u2019t they in a relationship? What was holding them back?</p><p>\u201cBug, you\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re bluffing.\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes at her little sister who just laughed under her breath, getting herself comfortable once more in her seat and turning her attention to the TV, thinking that she had won the discussion.</p><p>\u201cEven if I did like him that way, he doesn\u2019t feel the same so you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep telling yourself that.\u201d</p><p>The sisters fell into a comfortable silence as the film played before them. Y/N\u2019s attention wasn\u2019t fully on the film before her though. No, it was on Harry. She\u2019d known the man for a mere three months and she was certain that she had feelings for him but she wasn\u2019t sure if he felt the same. And if he did feel the same, how the <i>fuck </i>was she meant to tell him or start something with him? She\u2019d never experienced something like that and it was scaring her to think about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be cute if someone were to do such a grand gesture in real life. Like he liked her enough to hijack the school sound system to ask her to prom.\u201d Y/N\u2019s attention finally turned back to the TV where Heath Ledger\u2019s character-Patrick Verona- was singing \u2018Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off of You\u2019 while running away from campus security. Jasmine was fixated on the screen with a smile playing at her lips while Y/N took a deep breath and smiled at her younger sister. Truth be told, that was always her favourite scene of the film, because it showed that the cold-hearted guy you first met in the film was starting to warm up to the girl he\u2019d been paid to date.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved this scene. Heath Ledger deserved better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we agreeing on?\u201d Y/N looked up from the TV to find Harry stood in the doorway with two bags of Chinese food and a soft smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cHeath Ledger deserved better than to die so young.\u201d Harry nodded as he put the bags on the table before her.</p><p>\u201cOh, he did! I come baring food so we can\u2019t get too emotional about him. I\u2019ll go grab some plates and cutlery.\u201d Before he could move from his spot, Jasmine had stood up and made her way to the doorway, telling Harry to sit down and that she would get them.</p><p>\u201cDo either of you want a drink while I\u2019m out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVodka tonic, please.\u201d Harry and Y/N looked at each other with a chuckled while Jasmine shook her head, walking out of the room with a \u2018made for each other\u2019 under her breath which made Harry turn to Y/N with furrowed brows.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, ignore her.\u201d</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>Y/N stood at her side of the bed, moving the cushions from it and putting them on the floor next to her, preparing herself to get in bed. Harry walked out from the bathroom with his jogger shorts on and no top, standing awkwardly in the doorway and looking at the girl he had started to grow attached to. He watched the way she reached across the bed to move the abundance of cushions that were housed there, swearing that they were all necessary. He watched as the hem of her t-shirt raised with each stress, showing off a tiny bit of her belly and causing his belly to flutter. He liked Y/N, that much was true. He knew that she must feel the same way because she\u2019s always been cosy with him and wanted to be around him. He just didn\u2019t know how to start anything.</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you want to do this?\u201d Harry\u2019s left hand came up to brush the hair away from his face, staying at the back of his head for a few moments before he moved it and watched as Y/N furrowed her brows.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep?\u201d She opened her mouth in realisation, setting the last pillow on the floor before standing facing Harry and rubbing at the back of her neck quickly.</p><p>\u201cPreferably under covers and on a mattress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Harry chuckled while Y/N smiled at him, walking around the bed to stand in front of him, his head coming to lean down so he could see her.</p><p>\u201cYou can have the mattress if you\u2019d prefer, but I assumed you\u2019d just share my bed. It\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t done it before.\u201d</p><p>Harry took a deep breath, feeling Y/N\u2019s hand come to grab onto his, squeezing it lightly before looking up at him with the smile that drove him wild.</p><p>\u201cWould it not be awkward after\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you make it awkward. It happened and I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d Y/N could see the slight smile that Harry had when he looked into her eyes, his tongue poking out of his lips quickly before retreating back to where it belonged.</p><p>\u201cOkay, cool.\u201d Y/N laughed at him before walking back to her side of the bed and climbing in once she\u2019d removed her pyjama bottoms, getting herself comfy before Harry joined her.</p><p>As they lay in the bed together, Y/N faced Harry with her hands in the middle of them both. Harry\u2019s left hand was under his right hand and his right sat just underneath Y/N\u2019s with the very tips of his fingers brushing against her palm. They were comfortable together, enjoying one another\u2019s presence in a way neither of them knew to be possible.</p><p>\u201cHarry, go to sleep.\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes were closed, but she knew that Harry\u2019s were open, and watching her intently as she tried to go to sleep.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Her eyes remained closed as she spoke to Harry, hearing the pout in his voice as he whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cBecause every time I close my eyes, I picture kissing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Harry suddenly felt rather uneasy as he spoke. He wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d let that information out, or what Y/N would think of it, but when she replied, peeling her eyes open slowly with a sly smile on her face as she did, his heart rate picked up like crazy.</p><p>\u201cKiss me then\u2026\u201d</p><p>The hands that were once situated comfortably under him came to cup Y/N\u2019s cheeks, their eyes locked with the other\u2019s as they watched each other intently. Y/N took a deep breath as Harry leaned towards her, pressing his forehead against hers and closing his eyes. When his lips brushed against hers, her breathing hitched and she froze for a few seconds. It\u2019d been a while since they shared their first kiss, but it was just as amazing as the first time. Harry\u2019s lips soft against hers as he pressed them together, savouring her and not wanting the moment to end.</p><p>With her eyes closed, Y/N blindly moved her hand down between their bodies that were closer than they had been when they first got into bed, brushing her finger tips against his cock, feeling him stiffen under her and causing her to smirk into the kiss. She didn\u2019t know why she wanted to do that, what made her do it. All she knew is that she wanted to, and she hoped to God that Harry wanted to as well.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes opened to see Y/N looking back at him with a serious yet flirty look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start something you can\u2019t finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, I can finish it alright.\u201d She pressed a little harder and watched his eyes roll back into his head softly. The look almost causing her to move too quickly, but she knew that she wanted to tease him, to give everything to him in a way she never had with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be quiet for me, Harry. Jasmine\u2019s in the next room and she already thinks that something\u2019s going on between us.\u201d</p><p>Y/N felt weird starting something when her little sister was in the room next door, but she couldn\u2019t help it. Everything about Harry drew her in and she didn\u2019t know how to stop it. She gripped his cock fully over his sweats and watched as his breathing picked up, the muscle in her hands tightening as she held it. Her lips came back to press against, Harry\u2019s, only with more pressure and more hunger.</p><p>\u201cI dunno if I\u2019m going to be able to be quiet, angel. You\u2019re only holding me and I\u2019m ready to bust.\u201d Y/N laughed into his neck, feeling his chest rise with each breath.</p><p>\u201cWow, Harry. I\u2019ll let you go then.\u201d As her hands removed itself from his crotch and came to rest on his cheek, Harry pouted and caused Y/N to laugh once more. \u201cPatience, Harry. We\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>Soft kisses were pressed to his bare chest, over each swallow that sat on his collarbones, down to the butterfly that sat upon his tummy; to the ferns that were poking up from his sweats. That\u2019s where her lips stopped though, her head coming up to find Harry looking down at her in eagerness.</p><p>\u201cPlease, do something. I can\u2019t cope anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want me to do, Harry.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t believe the words that were leaving the girl\u2019s mouth. The girl he had viewed as innocent the entire time he\u2019d known her.</p><p>\u201cI want your mouth, please.\u201d His breathy begs were almost enough for Y/N to give in and do what he wanted, but she wanted to have a little fun of her own. And so, she pushed one hand into his bottoms as her mouth came to nibble lightly as the skin of his chest, sucking as she did and grabbing his dick once more, stroking it lightly and feeling his hips buck up into her hand.</p><p>\u201cNone of that. I\u2019ll help you out soon enough, but your chest looks so good that I want to mark every inch of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d The pair laughed with one another and Y/N attached her lips to Harry\u2019s chest once more and left one more mark, Harry groaning at the feeling.</p><p>When Y/N was satisfied with her work on his chest, she clambered down the bed quickly, Harry\u2019s eyes watching her intently as she pulled at the waistband of his bottoms before letting them go and hit the bottom of his stomach. He couldn\u2019t say anything before she started pulling them down his legs, laughing when he tried to throw his head back onto the pillows but hit the headboard behind him instead. His hand rubbed at the sore spot as Y/N giggled at him, kissing his thighs and bringing her hand up to touch where he wanted her to. He loud out an audible gasp when she fully took it into her hand, stroking him a few times before using her thumb to spread the precum that had started to form at the head. With what was left on her thumb, she brought up to her mouth of licked it clean, winking at a shaken Harry.</p><p>His eyes wouldn\u2019t leave hers as he watched her bring her mouth to his dick, kissing the head so lightly he almost didn\u2019t feel it, but he did, and it felt amazing. Her tongue swiped from the base all the way up before circling the tip and causing his eyes to roll back. His hands came to cup her cheeks as she sunk down on him, taking him as far as she could and using her hands to stroke at the bits that she couldn\u2019t get to. She felt amazing and Harry couldn\u2019t help but close his eyes tightly, moving his hands to the back of her head where he bunched her har up lightly and helped her create a good rhythm.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N. That feels so good.\u201d</p><p>She moaned around him and caused his hips to buck up and his dick to hit the back of her throat. She started to gag on him and pulled off with a cough, her eyes watering and her breathing fast.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m so sorry! I didn\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s fine. Just caught me off guard.\u201d Harry pulled the girl back up the bed to lay on him, wrapping his arms around her body and pulling her close, pressing his lips to hers and tasting himself on her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t finished yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby, but I want to cum in you, if you want me to.\u201d Y/N nodded eagerly, Harry chuckling at her before turning them over so he was hovering over her with his hands at either side of her head. She opened her legs for him to fit into easier and watched as he attached his lips to the part of her chest that had been uncovered by her top. \u201cMy God, let me get this thing off you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N helped Harry remove her top, sitting up for him to pull over her head and throw into the room somewhere, causing her to shake her head at him.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you eager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re involved, I\u2019ll always be eager. Wanted to do this the moment I first met you.\u201d His lips attached to her right nipple, kissing it softly before running his tongue over the growing pebble, Y/N\u2019s head hitting the pillow underneath her while Harry tended to her.</p><p>\u201cGod, Harry. Your tongue is so good.\u201d He looked up to her with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Want me to show you what it\u2019s really good for?\u201d She nodded quickly, smiling back at him and gripping onto his hair.</p><p>Harry copied Y/N\u2019s previous movements and clambered down the bed until he got to her pants. He ran his finger under the waistband and watched as she squirmed under him, her bottom lip pouting as she did.</p><p>\u201cPatience, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off trying to copy me.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss just above her pelvis and watched as her mouth opened before he started to pull her pants down, kissing down her left leg as he did, then kissing up her right one until his breath fanned against where she needed him most.</p><p>\u201cThank god I shaved yesterday.\u201d They both laughed before Harry ran finger up her folds, collecting the juices and making her body jerk when it brushed past her clit. \u201cFucking hell, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I did was run one finger over your clit and this is how you react? I think you\u2019re going to need to bite onto something to keep yourself quiet, poppet.\u201d Y/N smacked him around the head lightly before throwing her head back when his finger found it\u2019s way back to her fold and started to rub light circles upon her clit once more, her hips moving in time with him. \u201cNo moving, just let me please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d It was almost a whisper and it made his heart burst. She was being so vulnerable with him and he felt great knowing that he could be the person to make her feel good.</p><p>When his lips attached themselves to her bundle and he pressed a finger into her, she was a goner. Writhing and moaning underneath him with his hand having to come and cover her mouth to prevent her from waking her sister up.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell, love, you taste so good. I\u2019m going to take such good care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>Jasmine sat in the living room with Y/N when Harry walked downstairs, his body covered with bottoms and a top and a sloppy smile on his face as he looked at Y/N. She sat in the same place that she had the day before, covered by a blanket with her eyes glued to the TV where Friends played. Harry sat next to her and watched as she moved the blanket to cover them both, grabbing his hands and smiling up at him with a deep sigh. He pressed a kiss to her forehead just as Jasmine turned to look at them with a smile.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Her older sister peered around Harry with a smile, licking her lips as she did. \u201cWhat are we doing for breakfast today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. What are you fancying?\u201d Jasmine shrugged, watching as Harry turned his attention to the girls.</p><p>\u201cHow about I drive us to get something? There\u2019s a brunch place I like near Central.\u201d Y/N turned to her younger sister who nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cYes please, Harry. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, if we get ready now then we can leave soon. It\u2019ll not be too busy at this time.\u201d The girls nodded to him before standing up and running up the stairs to get ready.</p><p>Harry entered Y/N\u2019s bedroom just as she had pulled her pyjama top over her frame, his arms wrapping around her body and holding her close to him for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t regret last night, do you?\u201d Y/N looked up at him with furrowed brows, bringing her hands to press against his cheeks where she felt the stubble starting to grow.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I regret it? It was everything I\u2019d ever imagined, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I just thought for some reason that you\u2019d have decided that it shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, I\u2019m glad it happened. Part of me wishes it happened sooner than it did.\u201d Harry smiled at the girl before bringing his lips down to press against hers quickly, pulling away just as fast and watching as she kept her eyes closed for a few seconds once he\u2019d pulled away, opening them with a shy smile before he pecked her lips once more and let go of her body so she could continue getting ready.</p><p>\u201cMe too. But we need to get ready so hop to it.\u201d They chuckled before Y/N pulled on Harry\u2019s top from the day before, a white t-shirt with a picture of the earth on the chest and the words \u2018You\u2019re Out of This World\u2019 wrapped around it. She tucked it into her black jogger styles trousers that held a white stripe down each leg and grabbed her grey cardigan from the end of the bed to throw over her shoulders. \u201cWow, already stealing my clothes?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded with a smirk, wrapping her arms around Harry\u2019s body and pulling him close to her, feeling the buttons of his shirt pressing into her own body.</p><p>\u201cYep, problem with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>Jasmine sat opposite her sister and Harry, watching them look through their menu with smiles on their faces. She wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew what they were doing the night before and as much as it freaked her out at first, she threw her earphones in and almost found herself smiling because she hadn\u2019t seen her sister so happy in a long while.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s hand rested upon Harry\u2019s bicep as she looked at the menu he was holding in his hand and every now and then his left hand would reach up and grab hers, rubbing his thumb over her knuckles softly. They mulled over the menu for a little longer before Y/N turned to Jasmine and furrowed her brows when she caught her staring.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided what you want, bug?\u201d Jasmine nodded, putting her phone on the table and smiling at her sister.</p><p>\u201cI really fancy the strawberry waffles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to get. Harry? What do you fancy?\u201d Harry perused the menu once more before closing it and turning to the girl he found himself falling for.</p><p>\u201cI might get the same, nothing\u2019s really jumping out at me today. Also, it\u2019s on me. I\u2019m the one who decided that we should come here so it\u2019s only fair I pay.\u201d Y/N widened her eyes at him, removing her arm from his and turning her body to face him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you pay for it! You bought the Chinese food last night so it\u2019s only fair that I pay for this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, love. Let me treat you both, please.\u201d Y/N simple smiled as she took a sip of the water that was on the table for them all to share. \u201cThank you. Now are you both definitely wanting the strawberry waffles?\u201d The two girls nodded and watched as Harry walked to the counter to order and pay for their food.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling at, bug?\u201d Jasmine nodded her head towards Harry before turning back to her big sister.</p><p>\u201cOne, I\u2019m not stupid about what happened last night and-\u201c, Y/N\u2019s eyes widened and she flung her head into her hands and put them on the table, groaning to herself and hearing her sister laugh from her spot. \u201cand two, I see the way you look at each other. Have you finally started a bloody relationship? Because if not, it\u2019s about god damn time you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, it\u2019s a good job mum isn\u2019t here with that language, two, we haven\u2019t started anything, and I don\u2019t know if we even well. And three, what exactly did you hear last night?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine shook her head lightly as she laughed, watching Y/N squirm in her seat in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot, I put my earphones in. And as weird as it was for me to hear the beginnings of-I\u2019m never going to let you live that down, by the way- I\u2019m happy that you were comfortable enough to \u2018get some\u2019.\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at her little sister. Never once had she heard such things leave her mouth and as much as she wanted to cry with laughter at the way it was said, she also couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly dumbfounded by it.</p><p>\u201cCan we stop talking about my sex life-or prior lack of- while we\u2019re in a caf\u00e9 please? Actually, let\u2019s never talk about it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy that you did though?\u201d Y/N nodded with a small smile, taking a deep breath and another sip of water as Jasmine turned her attention to her phone.</p><p>\u201cI am. Also, you didn\u2019t have to put your earphones in. You could have come and knocked on the door and just ruined the mood, you know.\u201d</p><p>The sisters laughed together while Harry was stood watching them from the counter. He never thought that he\u2019d be falling for a girl like Y/N, but he was so glad that he was. Stood waiting for the coffee he had ordered, he watched the two girls he\u2019d left at the table interacting and Y/N\u2019s smile never leaving her face, even when her head was down on the</p><p>table in her hands. Even when the coffee had been brought back to him, he stayed where he had been standing, watching the two interact.</p><p>He thoroughly enjoyed the way that Y/N had stolen his t-shirt that day, tucking it into her trousers and pairing it with her cardigan, a very \u2018him\u2019 outfit as he would normally say. The sleeves on the arms had been too long for her and so he spent a few moments rolling them up before they left the house, feeling the soft skin of her arm on his fingers and the goose bumps that arose when he ran them down her arms when he had finished.</p><p>Even on the car ride to the caf\u00e9, he kept stealing glances at her, and he knew that Jasmine was watching the entire time, but he didn\u2019t care. He knew that Jasmine was aware of the situation with Y/N\u2019s previous boyfriend and wanted to show her that he was a good guy and that he had her best interests at heart.</p><p>As he walked back to the table, he heard some of their conversation and his lips twitched into a silent laugh when he sat down.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019ve heard mum and dad \u2018get it on\u2019 so many times that my earphones have become my muse on a night time.\u201d Y/N\u2019s face turned to press into Harry\u2019s shoulder, and he laughed at her before placing a cup of coffee in front of her and watching as she smiled and took the first sip, closing her eyes at the taste.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing we weren\u2019t as quiet as we tried to be last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2019s saying. I\u2019m never going to love this down.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine watched with an amused smile as Harry cupped Y/N\u2019s face and brought it down so he could press a kiss to her forehead, before she saw her sister look up at him and press her lips to his own in a soft kiss. Seeing her sister happy was something that she\u2019d always wanted, for being able to look up to a relationship of her sister\u2019s too was something she never thought would be possible.</p><p>When the pair pulled away Harry gave Y/N a tiny wink before removing his hands and turning back to Jasmine who couldn\u2019t help the smile that was plastered on her face.</p><p>\u201cCan you two get married already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get married to her when she\u2019s not my girlfriend first, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouche. Well can you two get into a relationship already then. And then get married! Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed while Harry wrapped his arm around Y/N\u2019s shoulders and pulled her into him softly, rubbing the top of her arm and enjoying having her close.</p><p>How could he ask her to be his girlfriend when they pretty much acted like a couple already?</p><p><b><i>Taglist\u00a0</i></b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_f9sWNpbqjTMBslOhfnyPg\">@hforhome</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW891toEGmqEa1RcHOPiB2w\">@brielyse11</a> @rubytersteege <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqKWWy9Bdm9HFGCLpCkqnXA\">@stylesfantasy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvHlEXq4_tWGVkMYtH06aQ\">@talk-british-2-me-britbritharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a></p>",

And so, she would have Jasmine stay over as often as she could, and then would let Eric stay over at different times so she got quality time with each of them. The tradition had started when Y/N was still at university, where she would invite her younger siblings to hers for the night every so often so they could spend time together-even with her parents not being fully into the idea of their 12 year old children staying at their sister&rsquo;s university house where people would drink often. Though Y/N had set a house rule that whenever the twins were visiting, no one could smoke or drink in or around the house, and everyone understood and appreciated the rule so there was never any issue.</p><p>When Y/N bought her house in Kensington, however, she could have her siblings stay over more often which was a blessing for both her and her parents. It allowed her to see her siblings more often and allowed her parents to have an evening to themselves and keep their romance alive. One of her biggest fears was that her parents would split because they didn&rsquo;t get to spend much time together, and so, she took her siblings out of the house every now and then to allow them their quality time.</p><p>&ldquo;I like Harry.&rdquo; Y/N turned to her sister who sat opposite her on the singular chair of the living room. A blanket wrapped around her body and her head leaning against a cushion she had taken from the sofa where Y/N sat.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, he&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo; Jasmine turned to her sister with a soft smirk, her facial features almost mirroring her big sister. She watched as Y/N started to grow uncomfortable under her stare, pulling the blanket further up her body and under her chin. &ldquo;Adores you, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Jasmine may have been young, but she wasn&rsquo;t na&iuml;ve, she say the way Harry looked at Y/N when she answered the door to him. She say the way he wrapped his arms around her and held her tight for longer than a normal hug would last. And, she definitely saw the way that his eyes lingered on her lips for a millisecond before he pulled away. Jasmine made sure to sit on the single chair when she found out that Harry would be &lsquo;crashing&rsquo; girls&rsquo; night as Y/N had said it, so that her sister could sit next to Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;No, he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Y/N turned her attention back to the TV which played 10 Things I Hate About You-the film that always got shown when the sisters were together. Her heart rate increased thinking about Harry who had offered to collect their Chinese food for them rather than waiting for delivery.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, the first thing he did when he walked through the door was wrap his arms around you. He held you so freaking tight and the smile on his face was like the one dad gives to mum when he sees her. He bloody adores you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re seeing things.&rdquo; Y/N pulled the blanket off her slightly so she could bring her knees to her chest and rest her chin on them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like him though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you not like him?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N looked to her sister in offence, her eyes wide and mouth parted lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously I do! That&rsquo;s why I asked if you would mine him coming and crashing girls&rsquo; night.&rdquo; Jasmine nodded, removing the blanket that was around her body so she could get her drink that sat on the coffee table.</p><p>&ldquo;If you like him enough to let him come over when it&rsquo;s girls&rsquo; night-which I don&rsquo;t mind because he&rsquo;s lovely and it&rsquo;s good to see you really happy-, then you must like him enough to get into a relationship with him.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s attention was turned back to the TV as she though about Jasmine&rsquo;s words. She had asked if he wanted to spend the night when she knew her sister would be there. They&rsquo;d kissed before and it was nice, and he&rsquo;d stopped over at her house numerous times since she&rsquo;d gotten back from New York. So why weren&rsquo;t they in a relationship? What was holding them back?</p><p>&ldquo;Bug, you&rsquo;re delusional.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re bluffing.&rdquo; Y/N rolled her eyes at her little sister who just laughed under her breath, getting herself comfortable once more in her seat and turning her attention to the TV, thinking that she had won the discussion.</p><p>&ldquo;Even if I did like him that way, he doesn&rsquo;t feel the same so you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You keep telling yourself that.&rdquo;</p><p>The sisters fell into a comfortable silence as the film played before them. Y/N&rsquo;s attention wasn&rsquo;t fully on the film before her though. No, it was on Harry. She&rsquo;d known the man for a mere three months and she was certain that she had feelings for him but she wasn&rsquo;t sure if he felt the same. And if he did feel the same, how the <i>fuck </i>was she meant to tell him or start something with him? She&rsquo;d never experienced something like that and it was scaring her to think about it.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be cute if someone were to do such a grand gesture in real life. Like he liked her enough to hijack the school sound system to ask her to prom.&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s attention finally turned back to the TV where Heath Ledger&rsquo;s character-Patrick Verona- was singing &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t Take My Eyes Off of You&rsquo; while running away from campus security. Jasmine was fixated on the screen with a smile playing at her lips while Y/N took a deep breath and smiled at her younger sister. Truth be told, that was always her favourite scene of the film, because it showed that the cold-hearted guy you first met in the film was starting to warm up to the girl he&rsquo;d been paid to date.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always loved this scene. Heath Ledger deserved better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are we agreeing on?&rdquo; Y/N looked up from the TV to find Harry stood in the doorway with two bags of Chinese food and a soft smile on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Heath Ledger deserved better than to die so young.&rdquo; Harry nodded as he put the bags on the table before her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he did! I come baring food so we can&rsquo;t get too emotional about him. I&rsquo;ll go grab some plates and cutlery.&rdquo; Before he could move from his spot, Jasmine had stood up and made her way to the doorway, telling Harry to sit down and that she would get them.</p><p>&ldquo;Do either of you want a drink while I&rsquo;m out there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vodka tonic, please.&rdquo; Harry and Y/N looked at each other with a chuckled while Jasmine shook her head, walking out of the room with a &lsquo;made for each other&rsquo; under her breath which made Harry turn to Y/N with furrowed brows.</p><p>&ldquo;What does she mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, ignore her.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>Y/N stood at her side of the bed, moving the cushions from it and putting them on the floor next to her, preparing herself to get in bed. Harry walked out from the bathroom with his jogger shorts on and no top, standing awkwardly in the doorway and looking at the girl he had started to grow attached to. He watched the way she reached across the bed to move the abundance of cushions that were housed there, swearing that they were all necessary. He watched as the hem of her t-shirt raised with each stress, showing off a tiny bit of her belly and causing his belly to flutter. He liked Y/N, that much was true. He knew that she must feel the same way because she&rsquo;s always been cosy with him and wanted to be around him. He just didn&rsquo;t know how to start anything.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how do you want to do this?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s left hand came up to brush the hair away from his face, staying at the back of his head for a few moments before he moved it and watched as Y/N furrowed her brows.</p><p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sleep?&rdquo; She opened her mouth in realisation, setting the last pillow on the floor before standing facing Harry and rubbing at the back of her neck quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Preferably under covers and on a mattress?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Funny.&rdquo; Harry chuckled while Y/N smiled at him, walking around the bed to stand in front of him, his head coming to lean down so he could see her.</p><p>&ldquo;You can have the mattress if you&rsquo;d prefer, but I assumed you&rsquo;d just share my bed. It&rsquo;s not like we haven&rsquo;t done it before.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry took a deep breath, feeling Y/N&rsquo;s hand come to grab onto his, squeezing it lightly before looking up at him with the smile that drove him wild.</p><p>&ldquo;Would it not be awkward after&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only if you make it awkward. It happened and I don&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo; Y/N could see the slight smile that Harry had when he looked into her eyes, his tongue poking out of his lips quickly before retreating back to where it belonged.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, cool.&rdquo; Y/N laughed at him before walking back to her side of the bed and climbing in once she&rsquo;d removed her pyjama bottoms, getting herself comfy before Harry joined her.</p><p>As they lay in the bed together, Y/N faced Harry with her hands in the middle of them both. Harry&rsquo;s left hand was under his right hand and his right sat just underneath Y/N&rsquo;s with the very tips of his fingers brushing against her palm. They were comfortable together, enjoying one another&rsquo;s presence in a way neither of them knew to be possible.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, go to sleep.&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s eyes were closed, but she knew that Harry&rsquo;s were open, and watching her intently as she tried to go to sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Her eyes remained closed as she spoke to Harry, hearing the pout in his voice as he whispered to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Because every time I close my eyes, I picture kissing you again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You heard me.&rdquo; Harry suddenly felt rather uneasy as he spoke. He wasn&rsquo;t sure why he&rsquo;d let that information out, or what Y/N would think of it, but when she replied, peeling her eyes open slowly with a sly smile on her face as she did, his heart rate picked up like crazy.</p><p>&ldquo;Kiss me then&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The hands that were once situated comfortably under him came to cup Y/N&rsquo;s cheeks, their eyes locked with the other&rsquo;s as they watched each other intently. Y/N took a deep breath as Harry leaned towards her, pressing his forehead against hers and closing his eyes. When his lips brushed against hers, her breathing hitched and she froze for a few seconds. It&rsquo;d been a while since they shared their first kiss, but it was just as amazing as the first time. Harry&rsquo;s lips soft against hers as he pressed them together, savouring her and not wanting the moment to end.</p><p>With her eyes closed, Y/N blindly moved her hand down between their bodies that were closer than they had been when they first got into bed, brushing her finger tips against his cock, feeling him stiffen under her and causing her to smirk into the kiss. She didn&rsquo;t know why she wanted to do that, what made her do it. All she knew is that she wanted to, and she hoped to God that Harry wanted to as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes opened to see Y/N looking back at him with a serious yet flirty look.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start something you can&rsquo;t finish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, trust me, I can finish it alright.&rdquo; She pressed a little harder and watched his eyes roll back into his head softly. The look almost causing her to move too quickly, but she knew that she wanted to tease him, to give everything to him in a way she never had with anyone else.</p><p>&ldquo;Christ, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to be quiet for me, Harry. Jasmine&rsquo;s in the next room and she already thinks that something&rsquo;s going on between us.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N felt weird starting something when her little sister was in the room next door, but she couldn&rsquo;t help it. Everything about Harry drew her in and she didn&rsquo;t know how to stop it. She gripped his cock fully over his sweats and watched as his breathing picked up, the muscle in her hands tightening as she held it. Her lips came back to press against, Harry&rsquo;s, only with more pressure and more hunger.</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno if I&rsquo;m going to be able to be quiet, angel. You&rsquo;re only holding me and I&rsquo;m ready to bust.&rdquo; Y/N laughed into his neck, feeling his chest rise with each breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, Harry. I&rsquo;ll let you go then.&rdquo; As her hands removed itself from his crotch and came to rest on his cheek, Harry pouted and caused Y/N to laugh once more. &ldquo;Patience, Harry. We&rsquo;ll get there.&rdquo;</p><p>Soft kisses were pressed to his bare chest, over each swallow that sat on his collarbones, down to the butterfly that sat upon his tummy; to the ferns that were poking up from his sweats. That&rsquo;s where her lips stopped though, her head coming up to find Harry looking down at her in eagerness.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, do something. I can&rsquo;t cope anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what you want me to do, Harry.&rdquo; Harry couldn&rsquo;t believe the words that were leaving the girl&rsquo;s mouth. The girl he had viewed as innocent the entire time he&rsquo;d known her.</p><p>&ldquo;I want your mouth, please.&rdquo; His breathy begs were almost enough for Y/N to give in and do what he wanted, but she wanted to have a little fun of her own. And so, she pushed one hand into his bottoms as her mouth came to nibble lightly as the skin of his chest, sucking as she did and grabbing his dick once more, stroking it lightly and feeling his hips buck up into her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;None of that. I&rsquo;ll help you out soon enough, but your chest looks so good that I want to mark every inch of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please do.&rdquo; The pair laughed with one another and Y/N attached her lips to Harry&rsquo;s chest once more and left one more mark, Harry groaning at the feeling.</p><p>When Y/N was satisfied with her work on his chest, she clambered down the bed quickly, Harry&rsquo;s eyes watching her intently as she pulled at the waistband of his bottoms before letting them go and hit the bottom of his stomach. He couldn&rsquo;t say anything before she started pulling them down his legs, laughing when he tried to throw his head back onto the pillows but hit the headboard behind him instead. His hand rubbed at the sore spot as Y/N giggled at him, kissing his thighs and bringing her hand up to touch where he wanted her to. He loud out an audible gasp when she fully took it into her hand, stroking him a few times before using her thumb to spread the precum that had started to form at the head. With what was left on her thumb, she brought up to her mouth of licked it clean, winking at a shaken Harry.</p><p>His eyes wouldn&rsquo;t leave hers as he watched her bring her mouth to his dick, kissing the head so lightly he almost didn&rsquo;t feel it, but he did, and it felt amazing. Her tongue swiped from the base all the way up before circling the tip and causing his eyes to roll back. His hands came to cup her cheeks as she sunk down on him, taking him as far as she could and using her hands to stroke at the bits that she couldn&rsquo;t get to. She felt amazing and Harry couldn&rsquo;t help but close his eyes tightly, moving his hands to the back of her head where he bunched her har up lightly and helped her create a good rhythm.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Y/N. That feels so good.&rdquo;</p><p>She moaned around him and caused his hips to buck up and his dick to hit the back of her throat. She started to gag on him and pulled off with a cough, her eyes watering and her breathing fast.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, I&rsquo;m so sorry! I didn&rsquo;t mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, it&rsquo;s fine. Just caught me off guard.&rdquo; Harry pulled the girl back up the bed to lay on him, wrapping his arms around her body and pulling her close, pressing his lips to hers and tasting himself on her. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t finished yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, baby, but I want to cum in you, if you want me to.&rdquo; Y/N nodded eagerly, Harry chuckling at her before turning them over so he was hovering over her with his hands at either side of her head. She opened her legs for him to fit into easier and watched as he attached his lips to the part of her chest that had been uncovered by her top. &ldquo;My God, let me get this thing off you.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N helped Harry remove her top, sitting up for him to pull over her head and throw into the room somewhere, causing her to shake her head at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you eager?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whenever you&rsquo;re involved, I&rsquo;ll always be eager. Wanted to do this the moment I first met you.&rdquo; His lips attached to her right nipple, kissing it softly before running his tongue over the growing pebble, Y/N&rsquo;s head hitting the pillow underneath her while Harry tended to her.</p><p>&ldquo;God, Harry. Your tongue is so good.&rdquo; He looked up to her with a smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? Want me to show you what it&rsquo;s really good for?&rdquo; She nodded quickly, smiling back at him and gripping onto his hair.</p><p>Harry copied Y/N&rsquo;s previous movements and clambered down the bed until he got to her pants. He ran his finger under the waistband and watched as she squirmed under him, her bottom lip pouting as she did.</p><p>&ldquo;Patience, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off trying to copy me.&rdquo;</p><p>He pressed a kiss just above her pelvis and watched as her mouth opened before he started to pull her pants down, kissing down her left leg as he did, then kissing up her right one until his breath fanned against where she needed him most.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank god I shaved yesterday.&rdquo; They both laughed before Harry ran finger up her folds, collecting the juices and making her body jerk when it brushed past her clit. &ldquo;Fucking hell, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All I did was run one finger over your clit and this is how you react? I think you&rsquo;re going to need to bite onto something to keep yourself quiet, poppet.&rdquo; Y/N smacked him around the head lightly before throwing her head back when his finger found it&rsquo;s way back to her fold and started to rub light circles upon her clit once more, her hips moving in time with him. &ldquo;No moving, just let me please you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry.&rdquo; It was almost a whisper and it made his heart burst. She was being so vulnerable with him and he felt great knowing that he could be the person to make her feel good.</p><p>When his lips attached themselves to her bundle and he pressed a finger into her, she was a goner. Writhing and moaning underneath him with his hand having to come and cover her mouth to prevent her from waking her sister up.</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking hell, love, you taste so good. I&rsquo;m going to take such good care of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>Jasmine sat in the living room with Y/N when Harry walked downstairs, his body covered with bottoms and a top and a sloppy smile on his face as he looked at Y/N. She sat in the same place that she had the day before, covered by a blanket with her eyes glued to the TV where Friends played. Harry sat next to her and watched as she moved the blanket to cover them both, grabbing his hands and smiling up at him with a deep sigh. He pressed a kiss to her forehead just as Jasmine turned to look at them with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Her older sister peered around Harry with a smile, licking her lips as she did. &ldquo;What are we doing for breakfast today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. What are you fancying?&rdquo; Jasmine shrugged, watching as Harry turned his attention to the girls.</p><p>&ldquo;How about I drive us to get something? There&rsquo;s a brunch place I like near Central.&rdquo; Y/N turned to her younger sister who nodded her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes please, Harry. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, if we get ready now then we can leave soon. It&rsquo;ll not be too busy at this time.&rdquo; The girls nodded to him before standing up and running up the stairs to get ready.</p><p>Harry entered Y/N&rsquo;s bedroom just as she had pulled her pyjama top over her frame, his arms wrapping around her body and holding her close to him for a few minutes.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t regret last night, do you?&rdquo; Y/N looked up at him with furrowed brows, bringing her hands to press against his cheeks where she felt the stubble starting to grow.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would I regret it? It was everything I&rsquo;d ever imagined, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. I just thought for some reason that you&rsquo;d have decided that it shouldn&rsquo;t have happened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise you, I&rsquo;m glad it happened. Part of me wishes it happened sooner than it did.&rdquo; Harry smiled at the girl before bringing his lips down to press against hers quickly, pulling away just as fast and watching as she kept her eyes closed for a few seconds once he&rsquo;d pulled away, opening them with a shy smile before he pecked her lips once more and let go of her body so she could continue getting ready.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too. But we need to get ready so hop to it.&rdquo; They chuckled before Y/N pulled on Harry&rsquo;s top from the day before, a white t-shirt with a picture of the earth on the chest and the words &lsquo;You&rsquo;re Out of This World&rsquo; wrapped around it. She tucked it into her black jogger styles trousers that held a white stripe down each leg and grabbed her grey cardigan from the end of the bed to throw over her shoulders. &ldquo;Wow, already stealing my clothes?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded with a smirk, wrapping her arms around Harry&rsquo;s body and pulling him close to her, feeling the buttons of his shirt pressing into her own body.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, problem with it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely not.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>Jasmine sat opposite her sister and Harry, watching them look through their menu with smiles on their faces. She wasn&rsquo;t stupid. She knew what they were doing the night before and as much as it freaked her out at first, she threw her earphones in and almost found herself smiling because she hadn&rsquo;t seen her sister so happy in a long while.</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s hand rested upon Harry&rsquo;s bicep as she looked at the menu he was holding in his hand and every now and then his left hand would reach up and grab hers, rubbing his thumb over her knuckles softly. They mulled over the menu for a little longer before Y/N turned to Jasmine and furrowed her brows when she caught her staring.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you decided what you want, bug?&rdquo; Jasmine nodded, putting her phone on the table and smiling at her sister.</p><p>&ldquo;I really fancy the strawberry waffles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was going to get. Harry? What do you fancy?&rdquo; Harry perused the menu once more before closing it and turning to the girl he found himself falling for.</p><p>&ldquo;I might get the same, nothing&rsquo;s really jumping out at me today. Also, it&rsquo;s on me. I&rsquo;m the one who decided that we should come here so it&rsquo;s only fair I pay.&rdquo; Y/N widened her eyes at him, removing her arm from his and turning her body to face him.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you pay for it! You bought the Chinese food last night so it&rsquo;s only fair that I pay for this!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, love. Let me treat you both, please.&rdquo; Y/N simple smiled as she took a sip of the water that was on the table for them all to share. &ldquo;Thank you. Now are you both definitely wanting the strawberry waffles?&rdquo; The two girls nodded and watched as Harry walked to the counter to order and pay for their food.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you smiling at, bug?&rdquo; Jasmine nodded her head towards Harry before turning back to her big sister.</p><p>&ldquo;One, I&rsquo;m not stupid about what happened last night and-&ldquo;, Y/N&rsquo;s eyes widened and she flung her head into her hands and put them on the table, groaning to herself and hearing her sister laugh from her spot. &ldquo;and two, I see the way you look at each other. Have you finally started a bloody relationship? Because if not, it&rsquo;s about god damn time you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One, it&rsquo;s a good job mum isn&rsquo;t here with that language, two, we haven&rsquo;t started anything, and I don&rsquo;t know if we even well. And three, what exactly did you hear last night?&rdquo;</p><p>Jasmine shook her head lightly as she laughed, watching Y/N squirm in her seat in anticipation.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a lot, I put my earphones in. And as weird as it was for me to hear the beginnings of-I&rsquo;m never going to let you live that down, by the way- I&rsquo;m happy that you were comfortable enough to &lsquo;get some&rsquo;.&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s eyes widened as she stared at her little sister. Never once had she heard such things leave her mouth and as much as she wanted to cry with laughter at the way it was said, she also couldn&rsquo;t help but feel slightly dumbfounded by it.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we stop talking about my sex life-or prior lack of- while we&rsquo;re in a caf&eacute; please? Actually, let&rsquo;s never talk about it again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you happy that you did though?&rdquo; Y/N nodded with a small smile, taking a deep breath and another sip of water as Jasmine turned her attention to her phone.</p><p>&ldquo;I am. Also, you didn&rsquo;t have to put your earphones in. You could have come and knocked on the door and just ruined the mood, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>The sisters laughed together while Harry was stood watching them from the counter. He never thought that he&rsquo;d be falling for a girl like Y/N, but he was so glad that he was. Stood waiting for the coffee he had ordered, he watched the two girls he&rsquo;d left at the table interacting and Y/N&rsquo;s smile never leaving her face, even when her head was down on the</p><p>table in her hands. Even when the coffee had been brought back to him, he stayed where he had been standing, watching the two interact.</p><p>He thoroughly enjoyed the way that Y/N had stolen his t-shirt that day, tucking it into her trousers and pairing it with her cardigan, a very &lsquo;him&rsquo; outfit as he would normally say. The sleeves on the arms had been too long for her and so he spent a few moments rolling them up before they left the house, feeling the soft skin of her arm on his fingers and the goose bumps that arose when he ran them down her arms when he had finished.</p><p>Even on the car ride to the caf&eacute;, he kept stealing glances at her, and he knew that Jasmine was watching the entire time, but he didn&rsquo;t care. He knew that Jasmine was aware of the situation with Y/N&rsquo;s previous boyfriend and wanted to show her that he was a good guy and that he had her best interests at heart.</p><p>As he walked back to the table, he heard some of their conversation and his lips twitched into a silent laugh when he sat down.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;ve heard mum and dad &lsquo;get it on&rsquo; so many times that my earphones have become my muse on a night time.&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s face turned to press into Harry&rsquo;s shoulder, and he laughed at her before placing a cup of coffee in front of her and watching as she smiled and took the first sip, closing her eyes at the taste.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing we weren&rsquo;t as quiet as we tried to be last night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s saying. I&rsquo;m never going to love this down.&rdquo;</p><p>Jasmine watched with an amused smile as Harry cupped Y/N&rsquo;s face and brought it down so he could press a kiss to her forehead, before she saw her sister look up at him and press her lips to his own in a soft kiss. Seeing her sister happy was something that she&rsquo;d always wanted, for being able to look up to a relationship of her sister&rsquo;s too was something she never thought would be possible.</p><p>When the pair pulled away Harry gave Y/N a tiny wink before removing his hands and turning back to Jasmine who couldn&rsquo;t help the smile that was plastered on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you two get married already?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get married to her when she&rsquo;s not my girlfriend first, can I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Touche. Well can you two get into a relationship already then. And then get married! Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone laughed while Harry wrapped his arm around Y/N&rsquo;s shoulders and pulled her into him softly, rubbing the top of her arm and enjoying having her close.</p><p>How could he ask her to be his girlfriend when they pretty much acted like a couple already?</p><p><b><i>Taglist&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_f9sWNpbqjTMBslOhfnyPg\">@hforhome</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW891toEGmqEa1RcHOPiB2w\">@brielyse11</a> @rubytersteege <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqKWWy9Bdm9HFGCLpCkqnXA\">@stylesfantasy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvHlEXq4_tWGVkMYtH06aQ\">@talk-british-2-me-britbritharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a></p>",

And so, she would have Jasmine stay over as often as she could, and then would let Eric stay over at different times so she got quality time with each of them. The tradition had started when Y/N was still at university, where she would invite her younger siblings to hers for the night every so often so they could spend time together-even with her parents not being fully into the idea of their 12 year old children staying at their sister&rsquo;s university house where people would drink often. Though Y/N had set a house rule that whenever the twins were visiting, no one could smoke or drink in or around the house, and everyone understood and appreciated the rule so there was never any issue.</p>\n<p>When Y/N bought her house in Kensington, however, she could have her siblings stay over more often which was a blessing for both her and her parents. It allowed her to see her siblings more often and allowed her parents to have an evening to themselves and keep their romance alive. One of her biggest fears was that her parents would split because they didn&rsquo;t get to spend much time together, and so, she took her siblings out of the house every now and then to allow them their quality time.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I like Harry.&rdquo; Y/N turned to her sister who sat opposite her on the singular chair of the living room. A blanket wrapped around her body and her head leaning against a cushion she had taken from the sofa where Y/N sat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hmm, he&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo; Jasmine turned to her sister with a soft smirk, her facial features almost mirroring her big sister. She watched as Y/N started to grow uncomfortable under her stare, pulling the blanket further up her body and under her chin. &ldquo;Adores you, too.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

It had been a\nweek since he last saw Felicity. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like he\nhad run her off. His insecurity started to get the better of him, as\nhe started to think the worse. Terrible thoughts filled his head, and\nall he wanted was to know that she was okay. He was terrified that\nshe was alone, hurt, and scared. He couldn&rsquo;t sleep and could barely\neat. He felt as if he were losing all sense of reality.</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nstill spent most of his time at Hope\u2019s Bar, wishing she would return.\nNo one had known where she went or how long she would be gone for. He\nwish he could call her and make sure everything was alright. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nshowed up to the bar late one Saturday evening. He was already\nbuzzed, when he decided to drop by. He had been drinking more and\nmore, since he was so worried something had happened to her. He felt\nlost and more alone than ever.</p><p><br/></p><p>Walking\ninto the bar, he automatically scanned the entire room. He froze,\nwhen he spotted her behind the counter. He felt as if he were\ndreaming. Rubbing his eyes, he made sure he wasn&rsquo;t seeing things.</p><p><br/></p><p>Standing\nin the entrance way, he studied her for a moment. Although he still\nthought that she was the most beautiful girl, he couldn&rsquo;t help but\nwonder if she was sick. Something about her looked majorly off. She\nwas extremely pale and looked as if she would break down in tears at\nany moment. Her hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, and she was\ndressed in jeans and a t-shirt.</p><p><br/></p><p>Harry\nwas frozen in place. Sensing someone staring, she glanced up from the\ncounter. Meeting his curious gaze, she gave him a sad smile. His\nheart automatically started to break. He knew in that moment that\nsomething was very wrong.</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nfinally walked up the bar. Their eyes were locked onto one another,\nbut neither one could utter a word. They just studied each other.</p><p><br/></p><p>She\nwas the one to finally break the silence. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d\nshe said just above a whisper. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Reaching\nout, he took her hand. \u201cHi.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Looking\ndown, she stared at his hand on hers. He could tell she was fighting\nback tears, but he had no idea as to why. All he knew was that he\nwanted to help. All he wanted was to wrap her in his arms and tell\nher everything would be okay. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs\neverything alright?\u201d He asked concern evident in his voice. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nregretted his question instantly, when her head shot up and she met\nhis eyes once more. She remained silent, as the tears escaped her\ntired eyes. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nsorry,\u201d she said shaking her head. She hesitantly ran from behind\nthe counter and headed for the exit. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Harry\nstared after her, shocked. Without a second thought, he took off\nafter her. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u2026&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p><p><br/></p><p>Felicity\nstared at her mother&rsquo;s frail body, as she tried to force herself to\nrespond. She had no idea what to say or what to do. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cFelicity?\u201d\nHer mother croaked out once more. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHi\nmom.\u201d She whispered. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat really you?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\ncan&rsquo;t believe you came!\u201d she cried. \u201cCome here so I can get a good look\nat you.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Reluctantly,\nFelicity walked towards the hospital bed. Her emotions were all over\nthe place. Part of her wanted to run out of the room and scream.\nAnother part of her wanted to curl up beside her mother and cry. She\nfelt lost and confused. Because of the drugs, she had never been\nclose to her mother. She hated that she had been deprived of the\nideal mother and daughter relationship. Her childhood had been rough,\nand she didn&rsquo;t like to talk about it or even think about it. More\nthan anything, she felt angry for not having a real parent to turn\nto. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Fighting\nback her emotions, she stood before her mother. She could tell that\nit took all her strength to keep her eyelids open. Her frail body was\nshaking uncontrollably, as she reached out to take her daughters\nhand. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\ndidn&rsquo;t think I would ever see you again.\u201d She whispered. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Felicity\nremained quiet, reluctantly holding onto her mothers bony hand. \u00a0\n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cFelicity..\u201d\nShe started. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d She choked. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>It\ntook her a moment to gather herself, in order to continue. Tears\nstarted to roll down her checks, as she poured her heart out to her\ndaughter. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\nknow I&rsquo;ve never been the best mother, and I&rsquo;ve hated myself for it.\nMy demons got the best of me, and for that I am sorry. I never meant\nto hurt you and your brother this way. I just couldn&rsquo;t handle life.\nYour father.. He broke me, and I&rsquo;ve never been able to get over it.\nI&rsquo;ve tried.. I really have, but I failed. I failed both of you..\u201d\nShe choked out.</p><p><br/></p><p>Her\nwords were sincere, and they took Felicity off guard. She had never\nbeen able to understand her mother, until this moment. She had always\nknow the hell her father had put them both through, but could never\nunderstand why her mother couldn&rsquo;t move past it. After all, she had\nbeen able to. For the most part anyway. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMom..\nyou don&rsquo;t have to explain..\u201d She started to say. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYes..\nI do. I need to get the out, before it&rsquo;s to late. You will never know\nhow sorry I am for turning to drugs. It was the only escape that I\ncould find, and I want you to know why.\u201d She paused. \u201cThomas..\ncould you give your sister and I a moment. There are somethings I\nneed to say to her that you don&rsquo;t need to know.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He looked between his mom and sister, and thought about her words. He had known\nfor years that there were secrets between the two of them that they\nrefused to share. He had asked his sister on many occasions what\nhappened with their father, but she refused to speak of him.

She had yet to speak to her mother about what\nhappened to her when she was a child. She had always known the day\nwould could that it would need to be discussed, but she had dreaded\nthe conversation. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cFelicity..\u201d\nHer mom started once more. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\nknow what you&rsquo;re going to say&hellip; Please don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to talk\nabout this. Nothing we say will change the past so lets just leave it\nalone.\u201d Felicity said shaking her head. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWe\nneed to talk about this. I should have talked to you a long time ago,\nbut could never bring myself to do it.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMom..\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cJust\nlisten okay?\u201d She asked tightening her grip on her hands. \u201cI want\nyou to know that it wasn&rsquo;t the abuse that made me this way. Your\nfather.. He put me through hell, and I hate him with everything in\nme. But what he done to me was nothing compared to what he done to\nyou.. Felicity.. I&rsquo;m so sorry that I couldn&rsquo;t stop him. I tried to,\nbut I wasn&rsquo;t strong enough.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cPlease..\nstop.\u201d Felicity begged. This was one memory that she never wanted\nto relive. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cLook\nat me,\u201d she spoke sternly. \u201cWhat he done to you was not your\nfault. He was a monster, and you were just a kid. You didn&rsquo;t deserve\nto be treated that way, and I would do anything to be able to change\nit. What happened.. That memory has haunted me everyday since. Every\ntime I close my eyes, I can see you as a scared child and me not\nbeing able to help. I failed you, and because of that I&rsquo;ve wanted to\nescape.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Felicity&rsquo;s\nheart was breaking. She had never seen this side of her mother. When\nshe was a kid she felt alone. She felt as if her mother never cared\nat all. She couldn&rsquo;t remember her mother taking up for her, until\nnow. Up until now, the only memories she had were of her father&rsquo;s\nabuse. She could never escape his unending torment. All throughout\nthe day, he would abuse her both mentally and physically. However, the\nnights were the worst. At night he would enter her room and do\nunspeakable things to her. She tried her best to keep him away, but\nshe was just a kid and no match for him. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>She\nhad spent years in therapy, because of this. She still had many\nissues that she struggled with each and every day. It took everything\nin her to be able to trust anyone at all, and she had trouble in all\nrelationships. More than anything, she wanted to be normal. She\nwanted to forget the trauma she experienced as a kid, but she knew\nthat she would always carry it with her. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt\nwasn&rsquo;t your fault either,\u201d Felicity finally spoke up. \u201cHe was no\nmatch for either of us. I don&rsquo;t blame you for what happened. I never\nhave.\u201d She admitted to both her mom and herself. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>They\nwere both in tears, as they both laid there hearts out to each other.\nSurprising them both, Felicity laid down beside her mother. Taking\nboth her hands in hers, she tried her best to comfort her. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nsorry for not being the mother you deserved.\u201d She cried. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\nforgive you.\u201d Felicity said honestly. She had never thought she\nwould utter those three words to her mother, however she did. She was\nfinally able to forgive her for her absence as a mom. She felt as if\na huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>They\nlaid there in silence, both finally at peace. Felicity heard her moms\nbreathing become heavy, and her body go limp. Looking over, she\nwatched her sleep for a few moments. Sighing she got up to search for\nher brother. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u2026&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p><p><br/></p><p>It\ntook a moment for Harry to find Felicity, outside of the bar. She was\nsitting with her head buried in her knees. He could see her shaking\nand knew she was crying. His heart broke even more. Instantly he went\nto her and wrapped her in his arms. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nheld her as she cried, both remaining silent. More than anything, he\nwanted to know what was wrong, but he didn&rsquo;t want to push her. He knew\nthat she would tell him, when she was ready. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>They\nstayed like this for quite some time. Harry held her closely and\nrubbed her back in soothing circles. Her body started to slowly\nrelax, as time went by. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nsorry,\u201d she spoke finally. Lifting her head slightly, she rested it\non top of her knees. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Her\nface was red and puffy, and Harry noticed the dark circles under her\neyes. Reaching up, he wiped the tears from her cheeks.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nhave nothing to apologize, love.\u201d He told her soothingly. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>She\ngave him a sad smile. \u201cYes I do, and I definitely owe you an\nexplanation.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>She\nwas quiet a moment, while she tried to gather her thoughts. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\ndon&rsquo;t have to explain..\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cConsidering\nwe kissed, and then I disappeared, I think I do.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\nwasn&rsquo;t anything to do with you.. I promise.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Harry\nfelt relieved. He didn&rsquo;t want to be the reason she had run off. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas my mom,\u201d she spoke softly. \u201cIt was my brother that called me,\nwhen we were in the park that night. After you dropped me off, he\ncalled again. Our mom was in the hospital so I had to go to them.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>She\nwent silent once more, lost in thought. Harry could sense there was\nmore to the story, but he remained patient. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Felicity\nstayed silent. She was reluctant to go on. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs\nshe alright?\u201d Harry finally asked. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\ncould sense her freeze, and he knew the answer. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nshe whispered. \u201cShe died, last night. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here. I needed\na little break from reality.\u201d \u00a0She said sadly. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nso sorry.\u201d Harry said honestly. He tightened his grip on her even\nmore. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>She\nshrugged. \u201cMe and my mom.. We&rsquo;ve never had the best relationship. A\nlot of things happened to me when I was a kid, and neither one of us\never really recovered. She turned to drugs and spent her life trying\nto escape. Now, she finally has.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Harry\nwas speechless. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say. Her life seemed to be the\ncomplete opposite of his. He was extremely close to his mother, and\nhe couldn&rsquo;t imagine not having her in his life. His heart broke in\ntwo, and he wished he knew how to help her. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nsorry.\u201d He said once more. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThis\nhelps.\u201d She told him putting her head on his shoulder. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nsmiled a bit and held her close. They stayed like that, both lost in\nthought. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHer\nfuneral is tomorrow.\u201d She sighed closing her eyes. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCan\nI come?\u201d He asked reluctantly. \u201cI would like to be there for you\nif that&rsquo;s okay.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\nwould like that.\u201d She smiled up at him, and she gave him a quick\nkiss on the cheek. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Standing\nup, she looked down on him. I need to get back in there. I&rsquo;m only\nhere for a few hours. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell\nI&rsquo;ll keep you company,\u201d He said raising to his feet. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>She\nsmiled once more and went to turn away. He grabbed her by the hand\nand pulled her back to him. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\nmissed you,\u201d he told her earnestly. Pulling her close, he softly\ntouched his lips to hers. \n</p>",

It had been a\nweek since he last saw Felicity. He couldn\u2019t help but feel like he\nhad run her off. His insecurity started to get the better of him, as\nhe started to think the worse. Terrible thoughts filled his head, and\nall he wanted was to know that she was okay. He was terrified that\nshe was alone, hurt, and scared. He couldn\u2019t sleep and could barely\neat. He felt as if he were losing all sense of reality.</p><p><br></p><p>He\nstill spent most of his time at Hope\u2019s Bar, wishing she would return.\nNo one had known where she went or how long she would be gone for. He\nwish he could call her and make sure everything was alright. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nshowed up to the bar late one Saturday evening. He was already\nbuzzed, when he decided to drop by. He had been drinking more and\nmore, since he was so worried something had happened to her. He felt\nlost and more alone than ever.</p><p><br></p><p>Walking\ninto the bar, he automatically scanned the entire room. He froze,\nwhen he spotted her behind the counter. He felt as if he were\ndreaming. Rubbing his eyes, he made sure he wasn\u2019t seeing things.</p><p><br></p><p>Standing\nin the entrance way, he studied her for a moment. Although he still\nthought that she was the most beautiful girl, he couldn\u2019t help but\nwonder if she was sick. Something about her looked majorly off. She\nwas extremely pale and looked as if she would break down in tears at\nany moment. Her hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, and she was\ndressed in jeans and a t-shirt.</p><p><br></p><p>Harry\nwas frozen in place. Sensing someone staring, she glanced up from the\ncounter. Meeting his curious gaze, she gave him a sad smile. His\nheart automatically started to break. He knew in that moment that\nsomething was very wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>He\nfinally walked up the bar. Their eyes were locked onto one another,\nbut neither one could utter a word. They just studied each other.</p><p><br></p><p>She\nwas the one to finally break the silence. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d\nshe said just above a whisper. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Reaching\nout, he took her hand. \u201cHi.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Looking\ndown, she stared at his hand on hers. He could tell she was fighting\nback tears, but he had no idea as to why. All he knew was that he\nwanted to help. All he wanted was to wrap her in his arms and tell\nher everything would be okay. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs\neverything alright?\u201d He asked concern evident in his voice. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nregretted his question instantly, when her head shot up and she met\nhis eyes once more. She remained silent, as the tears escaped her\ntired eyes. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d she said shaking her head. She hesitantly ran from behind\nthe counter and headed for the exit. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Harry\nstared after her, shocked. Without a second thought, he took off\nafter her. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><p><br></p><p>Felicity\nstared at her mother\u2019s frail body, as she tried to force herself to\nrespond. She had no idea what to say or what to do. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFelicity?\u201d\nHer mother croaked out once more. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHi\nmom.\u201d She whispered. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat really you?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe you came!\u201d she cried. \u201cCome here so I can get a good look\nat you.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Reluctantly,\nFelicity walked towards the hospital bed. Her emotions were all over\nthe place. Part of her wanted to run out of the room and scream.\nAnother part of her wanted to curl up beside her mother and cry. She\nfelt lost and confused. Because of the drugs, she had never been\nclose to her mother. She hated that she had been deprived of the\nideal mother and daughter relationship. Her childhood had been rough,\nand she didn\u2019t like to talk about it or even think about it. More\nthan anything, she felt angry for not having a real parent to turn\nto. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting\nback her emotions, she stood before her mother. She could tell that\nit took all her strength to keep her eyelids open. Her frail body was\nshaking uncontrollably, as she reached out to take her daughters\nhand. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\ndidn\u2019t think I would ever see you again.\u201d She whispered. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Felicity\nremained quiet, reluctantly holding onto her mothers bony hand. \u00a0\n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFelicity..\u201d\nShe started. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d She choked. \n</p><p><br></p><p>It\ntook her a moment to gather herself, in order to continue. Tears\nstarted to roll down her checks, as she poured her heart out to her\ndaughter. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nknow I\u2019ve never been the best mother, and I\u2019ve hated myself for it.\nMy demons got the best of me, and for that I am sorry. I never meant\nto hurt you and your brother this way. I just couldn\u2019t handle life.\nYour father.. He broke me, and I\u2019ve never been able to get over it.\nI\u2019ve tried.. I really have, but I failed. I failed both of you..\u201d\nShe choked out.</p><p><br></p><p>Her\nwords were sincere, and they took Felicity off guard. She had never\nbeen able to understand her mother, until this moment. She had always\nknow the hell her father had put them both through, but could never\nunderstand why her mother couldn\u2019t move past it. After all, she had\nbeen able to. For the most part anyway. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMom..\nyou don\u2019t have to explain..\u201d She started to say. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes..\nI do. I need to get the out, before it\u2019s to late. You will never know\nhow sorry I am for turning to drugs. It was the only escape that I\ncould find, and I want you to know why.\u201d She paused. \u201cThomas..\ncould you give your sister and I a moment. There are somethings I\nneed to say to her that you don\u2019t need to know.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>He looked between his mom and sister, and thought about her words. He had known\nfor years that there were secrets between the two of them that they\nrefused to share. He had asked his sister on many occasions what\nhappened with their father, but she refused to speak of him. He had\nknown that it was bad, but he would never know the full extent of it.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nremained silent, as he reluctantly left the two of them alone.\nShutting the door quietly behind him, the room fell silent. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Felicity\nknew what was coming.

It had been a\nweek since he last saw Felicity. He couldn\u2019t help but feel like he\nhad run her off. His insecurity started to get the better of him, as\nhe started to think the worse. Terrible thoughts filled his head, and\nall he wanted was to know that she was okay. He was terrified that\nshe was alone, hurt, and scared. He couldn\u2019t sleep and could barely\neat. He felt as if he were losing all sense of reality.</p><p><br></p><p>He\nstill spent most of his time at Hope\u2019s Bar, wishing she would return.\nNo one had known where she went or how long she would be gone for.

He had been drinking more and\nmore, since he was so worried something had happened to her. He felt\nlost and more alone than ever.</p><p><br></p><p>Walking\ninto the bar, he automatically scanned the entire room. He froze,\nwhen he spotted her behind the counter. He felt as if he were\ndreaming. Rubbing his eyes, he made sure he wasn\u2019t seeing things.</p><p><br></p><p>Standing\nin the entrance way, he studied her for a moment. Although he still\nthought that she was the most beautiful girl, he couldn\u2019t help but\nwonder if she was sick. Something about her looked majorly off. She\nwas extremely pale and looked as if she would break down in tears at\nany moment. Her hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, and she was\ndressed in jeans and a t-shirt.</p><p><br></p><p>Harry\nwas frozen in place. Sensing someone staring, she glanced up from the\ncounter. Meeting his curious gaze, she gave him a sad smile. His\nheart automatically started to break. He knew in that moment that\nsomething was very wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>He\nfinally walked up the bar.

They just studied each other.</p><p><br></p><p>She\nwas the one to finally break the silence. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d\nshe said just above a whisper. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Reaching\nout, he took her hand. \u201cHi.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Looking\ndown, she stared at his hand on hers. He could tell she was fighting\nback tears, but he had no idea as to why. All he knew was that he\nwanted to help. All he wanted was to wrap her in his arms and tell\nher everything would be okay. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs\neverything alright?\u201d He asked concern evident in his voice. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nregretted his question instantly, when her head shot up and she met\nhis eyes once more. She remained silent, as the tears escaped her\ntired eyes. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d she said shaking her head. She hesitantly ran from behind\nthe counter and headed for the exit. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Harry\nstared after her, shocked. Without a second thought, he took off\nafter her. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><p><br></p><p>Felicity\nstared at her mother\u2019s frail body, as she tried to force herself to\nrespond. She had no idea what to say or what to do. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFelicity?\u201d\nHer mother croaked out once more. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHi\nmom.\u201d She whispered. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat really you?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe you came!\u201d she cried. \u201cCome here so I can get a good look\nat you.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Reluctantly,\nFelicity walked towards the hospital bed. Her emotions were all over\nthe place. Part of her wanted to run out of the room and scream.\nAnother part of her wanted to curl up beside her mother and cry. She\nfelt lost and confused. Because of the drugs, she had never been\nclose to her mother. She hated that she had been deprived of the\nideal mother and daughter relationship. Her childhood had been rough,\nand she didn\u2019t like to talk about it or even think about it. More\nthan anything, she felt angry for not having a real parent to turn\nto. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting\nback her emotions, she stood before her mother. She could tell that\nit took all her strength to keep her eyelids open. Her frail body was\nshaking uncontrollably, as she reached out to take her daughters\nhand. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\ndidn\u2019t think I would ever see you again.\u201d She whispered. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Felicity\nremained quiet, reluctantly holding onto her mothers bony hand. \u00a0\n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFelicity..\u201d\nShe started. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d She choked. \n</p><p><br></p><p>It\ntook her a moment to gather herself, in order to continue. Tears\nstarted to roll down her checks, as she poured her heart out to her\ndaughter. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nknow I\u2019ve never been the best mother, and I\u2019ve hated myself for it.\nMy demons got the best of me, and for that I am sorry. I never meant\nto hurt you and your brother this way. I just couldn\u2019t handle life.\nYour father.. He broke me, and I\u2019ve never been able to get over it.\nI\u2019ve tried.. I really have, but I failed. I failed both of you..\u201d\nShe choked out.</p><p><br></p><p>Her\nwords were sincere, and they took Felicity off guard. She had never\nbeen able to understand her mother, until this moment. She had always\nknow the hell her father had put them both through, but could never\nunderstand why her mother couldn\u2019t move past it. After all, she had\nbeen able to. For the most part anyway. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMom..\nyou don\u2019t have to explain..\u201d She started to say. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes..\nI do. I need to get the out, before it\u2019s to late. You will never know\nhow sorry I am for turning to drugs. It was the only escape that I\ncould find, and I want you to know why.\u201d She paused. \u201cThomas..\ncould you give your sister and I a moment. There are somethings I\nneed to say to her that you don\u2019t need to know.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>He looked between his mom and sister, and thought about her words. He had known\nfor years that there were secrets between the two of them that they\nrefused to share. He had asked his sister on many occasions what\nhappened with their father, but she refused to speak of him. He had\nknown that it was bad, but he would never know the full extent of it.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nremained silent, as he reluctantly left the two of them alone.\nShutting the door quietly behind him, the room fell silent. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Felicity\nknew what was coming. She had yet to speak to her mother about what\nhappened to her when she was a child. She had always known the day\nwould could that it would need to be discussed, but she had dreaded\nthe conversation. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFelicity..\u201d\nHer mom started once more. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nknow what you\u2019re going to say\u2026 Please don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to talk\nabout this. Nothing we say will change the past so lets just leave it\nalone.\u201d Felicity said shaking her head. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe\nneed to talk about this. I should have talked to you a long time ago,\nbut could never bring myself to do it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMom..\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cJust\nlisten okay?\u201d She asked tightening her grip on her hands. \u201cI want\nyou to know that it wasn\u2019t the abuse that made me this way. Your\nfather.. He put me through hell, and I hate him with everything in\nme. But what he done to me was nothing compared to what he done to\nyou.. Felicity.. I\u2019m so sorry that I couldn\u2019t stop him. I tried to,\nbut I wasn\u2019t strong enough.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPlease..\nstop.\u201d Felicity begged. This was one memory that she never wanted\nto relive. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLook\nat me,\u201d she spoke sternly. \u201cWhat he done to you was not your\nfault. He was a monster, and you were just a kid. You didn\u2019t deserve\nto be treated that way, and I would do anything to be able to change\nit. What happened.. That memory has haunted me everyday since. Every\ntime I close my eyes, I can see you as a scared child and me not\nbeing able to help. I failed you, and because of that I\u2019ve wanted to\nescape.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Felicity\u2019s\nheart was breaking. She had never seen this side of her mother. When\nshe was a kid she felt alone. She felt as if her mother never cared\nat all. She couldn\u2019t remember her mother taking up for her, until\nnow. Up until now, the only memories she had were of her father\u2019s\nabuse. She could never escape his unending torment. All throughout\nthe day, he would abuse her both mentally and physically. However, the\nnights were the worst. At night he would enter her room and do\nunspeakable things to her. She tried her best to keep him away, but\nshe was just a kid and no match for him. \n</p><p><br></p><p>She\nhad spent years in therapy, because of this. She still had many\nissues that she struggled with each and every day. It took everything\nin her to be able to trust anyone at all, and she had trouble in all\nrelationships. More than anything, she wanted to be normal. She\nwanted to forget the trauma she experienced as a kid, but she knew\nthat she would always carry it with her. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwasn\u2019t your fault either,\u201d Felicity finally spoke up. \u201cHe was no\nmatch for either of us. I don\u2019t blame you for what happened. I never\nhave.\u201d She admitted to both her mom and herself. \n</p><p><br></p><p>They\nwere both in tears, as they both laid there hearts out to each other.\nSurprising them both, Felicity laid down beside her mother. Taking\nboth her hands in hers, she tried her best to comfort her. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry for not being the mother you deserved.\u201d She cried. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nforgive you.\u201d Felicity said honestly. She had never thought she\nwould utter those three words to her mother, however she did. She was\nfinally able to forgive her for her absence as a mom. She felt as if\na huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders. \n</p><p><br></p><p>They\nlaid there in silence, both finally at peace. Felicity heard her moms\nbreathing become heavy, and her body go limp. Looking over, she\nwatched her sleep for a few moments. Sighing she got up to search for\nher brother. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><p><br></p><p>It\ntook a moment for Harry to find Felicity, outside of the bar. She was\nsitting with her head buried in her knees. He could see her shaking\nand knew she was crying. His heart broke even more. Instantly he went\nto her and wrapped her in his arms. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nheld her as she cried, both remaining silent. More than anything, he\nwanted to know what was wrong, but he didn\u2019t want to push her. He knew\nthat she would tell him, when she was ready. \n</p><p><br></p><p>They\nstayed like this for quite some time. Harry held her closely and\nrubbed her back in soothing circles. Her body started to slowly\nrelax, as time went by. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d she spoke finally. Lifting her head slightly, she rested it\non top of her knees. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Her\nface was red and puffy, and Harry noticed the dark circles under her\neyes. Reaching up, he wiped the tears from her cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\nhave nothing to apologize, love.\u201d He told her soothingly. \n</p><p><br></p><p>She\ngave him a sad smile. \u201cYes I do, and I definitely owe you an\nexplanation.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>She\nwas quiet a moment, while she tried to gather her thoughts. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to explain..\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cConsidering\nwe kissed, and then I disappeared, I think I do.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\nwasn\u2019t anything to do with you.. I promise.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Harry\nfelt relieved. He didn\u2019t want to be the reason she had run off. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\nwas my mom,\u201d she spoke softly. \u201cIt was my brother that called me,\nwhen we were in the park that night. After you dropped me off, he\ncalled again. Our mom was in the hospital so I had to go to them.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>She\nwent silent once more, lost in thought. Harry could sense there was\nmore to the story, but he remained patient. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Felicity\nstayed silent. She was reluctant to go on. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs\nshe alright?\u201d Harry finally asked. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\ncould sense her freeze, and he knew the answer. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nshe whispered. \u201cShe died, last night. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I needed\na little break from reality.\u201d \u00a0She said sadly. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nso sorry.\u201d Harry said honestly. He tightened his grip on her even\nmore. \n</p><p><br></p><p>She\nshrugged. \u201cMe and my mom.. We\u2019ve never had the best relationship. A\nlot of things happened to me when I was a kid, and neither one of us\never really recovered. She turned to drugs and spent her life trying\nto escape. Now, she finally has.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Harry\nwas speechless. He wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Her life seemed to be the\ncomplete opposite of his. He was extremely close to his mother, and\nhe couldn\u2019t imagine not having her in his life. His heart broke in\ntwo, and he wished he knew how to help her. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry.\u201d He said once more. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis\nhelps.\u201d She told him putting her head on his shoulder. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nsmiled a bit and held her close. They stayed like that, both lost in\nthought. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHer\nfuneral is tomorrow.\u201d She sighed closing her eyes. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCan\nI come?\u201d He asked reluctantly. \u201cI would like to be there for you\nif that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nwould like that.\u201d She smiled up at him, and she gave him a quick\nkiss on the cheek. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Standing\nup, she looked down on him. I need to get back in there. I\u2019m only\nhere for a few hours. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell\nI\u2019ll keep you company,\u201d He said raising to his feet. \n</p><p><br></p><p>She\nsmiled once more and went to turn away. He grabbed her by the hand\nand pulled her back to him. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nmissed you,\u201d he told her earnestly. Pulling her close, he softly\ntouched his lips to hers. \n</p></p>",

She had no idea what to say or what to do. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Felicity?&rdquo;\nHer mother croaked out once more. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hi\nmom.&rdquo; She whispered. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is\nthat really you?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\ncan&rsquo;t believe you came!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Come here so I can get a good look\nat you.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Reluctantly,\nFelicity walked towards the hospital bed. Her emotions were all over\nthe place. Part of her wanted to run out of the room and scream.\nAnother part of her wanted to curl up beside her mother and cry. She\nfelt lost and confused. Because of the drugs, she had never been\nclose to her mother. She hated that she had been deprived of the\nideal mother and daughter relationship. Her childhood had been rough,\nand she didn&rsquo;t like to talk about it or even think about it. More\nthan anything, she felt angry for not having a real parent to turn\nto. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Fighting\nback her emotions, she stood before her mother. She could tell that\nit took all her strength to keep her eyelids open. Her frail body was\nshaking uncontrollably, as she reached out to take her daughters\nhand. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\ndidn&rsquo;t think I would ever see you again.&rdquo; She whispered. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Felicity\nremained quiet, reluctantly holding onto her mothers bony hand. &nbsp;\n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Felicity..&rdquo;\nShe started. &ldquo;I am so sorry.&rdquo; She choked. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>It\ntook her a moment to gather herself, in order to continue. Tears\nstarted to roll down her checks, as she poured her heart out to her\ndaughter. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow I&rsquo;ve never been the best mother, and I&rsquo;ve hated myself for it.\nMy demons got the best of me, and for that I am sorry. I never meant\nto hurt you and your brother this way. I just couldn&rsquo;t handle life.\nYour father.. He broke me, and I&rsquo;ve never been able to get over it.\nI&rsquo;ve tried.. I really have, but I failed. I failed both of you..&rdquo;\nShe choked out.</p><p><br /></p><p>Her\nwords were sincere, and they took Felicity off guard. She had never\nbeen able to understand her mother, until this moment. She had always\nknow the hell her father had put them both through, but could never\nunderstand why her mother couldn&rsquo;t move past it. After all, she had\nbeen able to. For the most part anyway. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mom..\nyou don&rsquo;t have to explain..&rdquo; She started to say. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes..\nI do. I need to get the out, before it&rsquo;s to late. You will never know\nhow sorry I am for turning to drugs. It was the only escape that I\ncould find, and I want you to know why.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;Thomas..\ncould you give your sister and I a moment. There are somethings I\nneed to say to her that you don&rsquo;t need to know.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>He looked between his mom and sister, and thought about her words. He had known\nfor years that there were secrets between the two of them that they\nrefused to share. He had asked his sister on many occasions what\nhappened with their father, but she refused to speak of him. He had\nknown that it was bad, but he would never know the full extent of it.\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>He\nremained silent, as he reluctantly left the two of them alone.\nShutting the door quietly behind him, the room fell silent. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Felicity\nknew what was coming. She had yet to speak to her mother about what\nhappened to her when she was a child. She had always known the day\nwould could that it would need to be discussed, but she had dreaded\nthe conversation. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Felicity..&rdquo;\nHer mom started once more. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow what you&rsquo;re going to say&hellip; Please don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to talk\nabout this. Nothing we say will change the past so lets just leave it\nalone.&rdquo; Felicity said shaking her head. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;We\nneed to talk about this. I should have talked to you a long time ago,\nbut could never bring myself to do it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mom..&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just\nlisten okay?&rdquo; She asked tightening her grip on her hands. &ldquo;I want\nyou to know that it wasn&rsquo;t the abuse that made me this way. Your\nfather.. He put me through hell, and I hate him with everything in\nme. But what he done to me was nothing compared to what he done to\nyou.. Felicity.. I&rsquo;m so sorry that I couldn&rsquo;t stop him. I tried to,\nbut I wasn&rsquo;t strong enough.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Please..\nstop.&rdquo; Felicity begged. This was one memory that she never wanted\nto relive. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Look\nat me,&rdquo; she spoke sternly. &ldquo;What he done to you was not your\nfault. He was a monster, and you were just a kid. You didn&rsquo;t deserve\nto be treated that way, and I would do anything to be able to change\nit. What happened.. That memory has haunted me everyday since. Every\ntime I close my eyes, I can see you as a scared child and me not\nbeing able to help. I failed you, and because of that I&rsquo;ve wanted to\nescape.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Felicity&rsquo;s\nheart was breaking. She had never seen this side of her mother. When\nshe was a kid she felt alone. She felt as if her mother never cared\nat all. She couldn&rsquo;t remember her mother taking up for her, until\nnow. Up until now, the only memories she had were of her father&rsquo;s\nabuse. She could never escape his unending torment. All throughout\nthe day, he would abuse her both mentally and physically. However, the\nnights were the worst. At night he would enter her room and do\nunspeakable things to her. She tried her best to keep him away, but\nshe was just a kid and no match for him. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>She\nhad spent years in therapy, because of this. She still had many\nissues that she struggled with each and every day. It took everything\nin her to be able to trust anyone at all, and she had trouble in all\nrelationships. More than anything, she wanted to be normal. She\nwanted to forget the trauma she experienced as a kid, but she knew\nthat she would always carry it with her. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It\nwasn&rsquo;t your fault either,&rdquo; Felicity finally spoke up. &ldquo;He was no\nmatch for either of us. I don&rsquo;t blame you for what happened. I never\nhave.&rdquo; She admitted to both her mom and herself. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>They\nwere both in tears, as they both laid there hearts out to each other.\nSurprising them both, Felicity laid down beside her mother. Taking\nboth her hands in hers, she tried her best to comfort her. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry for not being the mother you deserved.&rdquo; She cried. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nforgive you.&rdquo; Felicity said honestly. She had never thought she\nwould utter those three words to her mother, however she did. She was\nfinally able to forgive her for her absence as a mom. She felt as if\na huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>They\nlaid there in silence, both finally at peace. Felicity heard her moms\nbreathing become heavy, and her body go limp. Looking over, she\nwatched her sleep for a few moments. Sighing she got up to search for\nher brother. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p><p><br /></p><p>It\ntook a moment for Harry to find Felicity, outside of the bar. She was\nsitting with her head buried in her knees. He could see her shaking\nand knew she was crying. His heart broke even more. Instantly he went\nto her and wrapped her in his arms. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>He\nheld her as she cried, both remaining silent. More than anything, he\nwanted to know what was wrong, but he didn&rsquo;t want to push her. He knew\nthat she would tell him, when she was ready. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>They\nstayed like this for quite some time. Harry held her closely and\nrubbed her back in soothing circles. Her body started to slowly\nrelax, as time went by. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry,&rdquo; she spoke finally. Lifting her head slightly, she rested it\non top of her knees. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Her\nface was red and puffy, and Harry noticed the dark circles under her\neyes. Reaching up, he wiped the tears from her cheeks.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nhave nothing to apologize, love.&rdquo; He told her soothingly. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>She\ngave him a sad smile. &ldquo;Yes I do, and I definitely owe you an\nexplanation.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>She\nwas quiet a moment, while she tried to gather her thoughts. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t have to explain..&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Considering\nwe kissed, and then I disappeared, I think I do.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;It\nwasn&rsquo;t anything to do with you.. I promise.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Harry\nfelt relieved. He didn&rsquo;t want to be the reason she had run off. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas my mom,&rdquo; she spoke softly. &ldquo;It was my brother that called me,\nwhen we were in the park that night. After you dropped me off, he\ncalled again. Our mom was in the hospital so I had to go to them.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>She\nwent silent once more, lost in thought. Harry could sense there was\nmore to the story, but he remained patient. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Felicity\nstayed silent. She was reluctant to go on. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is\nshe alright?&rdquo; Harry finally asked. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>He\ncould sense her freeze, and he knew the answer. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nshe whispered. &ldquo;She died, last night. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here. I needed\na little break from reality.&rdquo; &nbsp;She said sadly. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nso sorry.&rdquo; Harry said honestly. He tightened his grip on her even\nmore. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>She\nshrugged. &ldquo;Me and my mom.. We&rsquo;ve never had the best relationship. A\nlot of things happened to me when I was a kid, and neither one of us\never really recovered. She turned to drugs and spent her life trying\nto escape. Now, she finally has.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Harry\nwas speechless. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say. Her life seemed to be the\ncomplete opposite of his. He was extremely close to his mother, and\nhe couldn&rsquo;t imagine not having her in his life. His heart broke in\ntwo, and he wished he knew how to help her. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry.&rdquo; He said once more. &ldquo;Is there anything I can do to help?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;This\nhelps.&rdquo; She told him putting her head on his shoulder. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>He\nsmiled a bit and held her close. They stayed like that, both lost in\nthought. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Her\nfuneral is tomorrow.&rdquo; She sighed closing her eyes. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can\nI come?&rdquo; He asked reluctantly. &ldquo;I would like to be there for you\nif that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nwould like that.&rdquo; She smiled up at him, and she gave him a quick\nkiss on the cheek. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Standing\nup, she looked down on him. I need to get back in there. I&rsquo;m only\nhere for a few hours. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well\nI&rsquo;ll keep you company,&rdquo; He said raising to his feet. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>She\nsmiled once more and went to turn away. He grabbed her by the hand\nand pulled her back to him. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nmissed you,&rdquo; he told her earnestly. Pulling her close, he softly\ntouched his lips to hers. \n</p></p>",
