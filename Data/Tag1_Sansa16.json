For too long she had had to miss his touch and the heat of his body keeping her warm. Now she was finally here, staying here in the cold with all those eyes watching them and all those clothes on seemed like a waste of what little time they had together. </p><p>But she was a Queen now and all those people staring at them were her people. And no matter how much she wanted to lock herself up with him in his bedroom to not come out again until they had to leave again, she knew she couldn\u2019t do so. </p><p>He was her lover, the man she wanted to marry, the future father of her children and the King she wanted to rule besides her. But he was also the man who had gathered the biggest army ever seen, who had made it possible to defeat the Night King and who had saved the North of what could have been a bloodbath by killing the Dragon Queen before she could unleash her dragon on the very place she had helped to protect.</p><p>\u201cI wish we could take you home with us\u2026\u201d Sansa exhaled. Her warm breath was visible in the cold winter air. \u201cBut Bran told me it was too early, too soon.\u201d She let her head rest on his broad shoulder. She doubted if he was still fighting or practicing with his sword and yet she couldn\u2019t imagine anyone else she\u2019d feel this safe and at home with. \u201cI\u2019m glad he gave me an excuse to come here and visit you, though\u2026\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Jon\u2019s hand went through her hair and he twirled a loose strand around the tip of his finger. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m glad he made you do that.\u201d He whispered and his lips were almost touching her ear. \u201cBecause now I\u2019ve got to let you go again. And I don\u2019t know if I can do that.\u201d</p><p>Sansa closed her eyes. She knew that Jon was right. In a few weeks she would have to get on her horse again and that horse would carry her back to Winterfell. And neither of them knew when they would see each other again. But she didn\u2019t want to ruin this moment of happiness, of finally being with him again and being able to talk to him again without having to wait days for an answer. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk about that yet. We have a few more weeks before I have to leave again, maybe by then you will be tired of me and get headaches because I\u2019m talking too much.\u201d </p><p>Jon smiled and his lips kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll never grow tired of you.\u201d He pressed the palms of his hands to her glowing cheeks before he kissed her slightly parted lips again. \u201cAnd you can talk as much as you like. I missed hearing your ramblings and I missed your voice of reason.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips curled up, but the magical moment was disturbed when one of her guards cleared his throat. </p><p>\u201cMy apologies, your majesties.\u201d His voice trembled slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s getting dark soon. We need to unsaddle the horses and get them comfortable for the night.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked at Jon, but Jon kept silent. She was the Queen now, she was the ruler of the North now and just like everyone else Jon now waited for her commands. \u201cJon\u2026\u201d She remembered that she had promised to ask him how her men should address him. \u201cCould you send a few men to help the Northerners to settle?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course, my Queen.\u201d Jon nodded and stepped back from her to talk to a few of his friends, who kept a polite distance ever since Sansa had rushed through the gate. He maybe was no longer a King and he maybe didn\u2019t even want to be one anymore, but he still moved and behaved like one. Not like the one who would just order people around to do whatever he wanted them to do. He still was the kind of King people wanted to fight for and fight with. He still was the kind of King people believed in and trusted with their lives.</p><p>A few seconds later his men walked towards the gathered Northern caravan and lead them away to the stables so the horses could finally get some well deserved rest. </p><p>\u201cYou can banish a King from his Kingdom, but he\u2019ll always be a King\u2026\u201d Sansa only realised that she had said the words out loud when Jon let his forehead rest on hers. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a King anymore, Sansa.\u201d Jon spoke softly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need to be one. The North has a Queen, a wonderful Queen.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s intelligent and just. She\u2019s soft and strong. She\u2019s beautiful and brave.\u201d He paused for a moment and his eyes stared straight into hers. \u201cAnd she most of all doesn\u2019t need a King.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do need a King.\u201d Sansa closed her eyes. She was intelligent and just and soft and strong and beautiful and brave. But she was also just a girl who longed to be loved and cared for. \u201cI do need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not as your King.\u201d Jon\u2019s nose brushed hers. \u201cEven when Bran says it\u2019s okay for me to come home\u2026\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI still don\u2019t wanna be King again.\u201d His lips touched hers carefully. \u201cI want to be your husband. I want to be the father of your children. I want to help you raise the future Kings and Queens in the North.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t want to be King anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was already designing a beautiful crown for you.\u201d Sansa placed her hands on his shoulders. \u201cOne to match my tiara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be making me a crown. You should make one for you. A real crown for a true Queen, for the rightful ruler of the most beautiful Kingdom of Westeros.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Sansa\u2019s face brightened and then she kissed him once more. \u201cIf only all Kings, Princes and Lords I encountered had been like you. The world would have been a much better place.\u201d</p>",

But she was also just a girl who longed to be loved and cared for. \u201cI do need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not as your King.\u201d Jon\u2019s nose brushed hers. \u201cEven when Bran says it\u2019s okay for me to come home\u2026\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI still don\u2019t wanna be King again.\u201d His lips touched hers carefully. \u201cI want to be your husband.
