While this is simply my opinion on the matter, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for people to just shut others down simply because \u201cyou just have to accept it\u201d because, (aside from the fact that it\u2019s not a nice thing to do) for a number of reasons, we STILL dont\u2019t know what will happen yet. </p><p>1) We\u2019ve yet to see the reactions of the rest of the M9 (Aka Fjord, Yasha and Jester) regarding the death because, at the current moment, they have NO IDEA that this has transpired. Will they go visit the grave, say their goodbyes and leave? Will they push for a resurrection even though it will be exceedingly hard to pull? Will they need a small break after everything that happened to them? How will it change their character? There\u2019s so many unanswered questions about their reactions which is why I\u2019m both dreading and am very excited to see this reunion and see what transpired. </p><p>2) Caleb, Nott and Beau were still asking around to see if they could find someone to resurrect a friend. I do think that they made the right call in pushing to rescue their friends who are still alive first, but what will they do after? Their mission with the Gentleman would be accomplished. Their friends rescued (hopefully). What happens next? Will they go directly back to Zadash? Will they attempt to convince Ophelia? Will they go searching for a Temple? So many things that they can do! </p><p>I think that the aftermath of this story is going to be a very interesting one to see. And it is because these questions haven\u2019t been answered that people still believe that a resurrection could be possible. Will it be hard? Yes. Will it succeed? Maybe, or maybe aspects of Molly\u2019s past will come to light as to why it will not, or maybe it just simply will not. </p><p>One of the things that I really like about D&amp;D is that it encapsulates the phrase \u201cif there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way\u201d. You can do a lot of things and push for a lot of things if you really, really try. Whether you succeed or not is just simply based on luck of the die, but you can definitely, most certainly try. </p><p>It is true that there\u2019s many things that are not going to happen. For one, I don\u2019t believe Clay is there simply to resurrect Molly. I don\u2019t think he CAN. He just happened to be somebody that they found that just so happens to be a cleric and a soft pastel goth. And I find him to be an interesting character to add to the group if that\u2019s what ends up transpiring. Even more, if the M9 decide to move on, I believe that he\u2019ll be one of the key factors in helping the others as they go through their grief about Molly. He just strikes me as that type of person. (Plus he reminds me a lot of Uncle Iroh from ATLA haha)</p><p>For me, it\u2019s ok if the cast decide to leave him be. It\u2019s ok if they decide to not push for resurrection anymore. I think that the moment that the characters decide to do that as a whole will also lead to a big shift in their dynamic. And it\u2019s also ok if they try and fail because of plot reasons or because it turns out that he DID crawl out of the grave and is now someone else. </p><p>Molly is important to a lot of people. He was an important form of representation to the community and a source of happiness in the group. To me, he was that one character that resonated with me since episode 1 of this campaign and is still very dear to my heart. </p><p>His own death had such a big impact in the community because of this! It wasn\u2019t his time to die, we still don\u2019t know a lot about him and a lot of us (including myself) were looking forward to seeing how his relationships in this mismatched group that could/could\u2019ve become his family would be. Even to the cast and the characters of the M9, this is something that had a big impact on them as well. This is the type of character death that I\u2019ve seen in many fandoms that people still mourn over. The type that people will always remember. </p><p>Will he actually be back? I don\u2019t know. The odds are against them, time is running out, clerics that powerful are hard to find and maybe there\u2019s something related to his backstory that will impede them in succeeding even if they do try. But if there is a small, exceedingly small, chance that he could be back&hellip; I can guarantee that all of us will be fighting for it. </p><p>It\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t believe that he\u2019ll be back, but be nice to the ones that do. Sharing different theories and ideas of what will are what makes fandoms interesting and sometimes you have ones that stand at odds with others\u2019. So don\u2019t just simply try to force your own feelings on the matter to others or try to point out why they are wrong. People process these things in different ways: like me, who is simply waiting for the ending of this arc so I can start seeing the route that they end up deciding to take on this matter. </p><p>Anyway, that\u2019s my opinion on this, and I mostly did it to sort my own feelings on the matter, and now I\u2019ll be back to writing my crazy ideas that pop in my head instead of just FEELINGS haha </p>",

While this is simply my opinion on the matter, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for people to just shut others down simply because \u201cyou just have to accept it\u201d because, (aside from the fact that it\u2019s not a nice thing to do) for a number of reasons, we STILL dont\u2019t know what will happen yet. </p><p>1) We\u2019ve yet to see the reactions of the rest of the M9 (Aka Fjord, Yasha and Jester) regarding the death because, at the current moment, they have NO IDEA that this has transpired. Will they go visit the grave, say their goodbyes and leave? Will they push for a resurrection even though it will be exceedingly hard to pull? Will they need a small break after everything that happened to them? How will it change their character? There\u2019s so many unanswered questions about their reactions which is why I\u2019m both dreading and am very excited to see this reunion and see what transpired. </p><p>2) Caleb, Nott and Beau were still asking around to see if they could find someone to resurrect a friend. I do think that they made the right call in pushing to rescue their friends who are still alive first, but what will they do after? Their mission with the Gentleman would be accomplished. Their friends rescued (hopefully). What happens next? Will they go directly back to Zadash? Will they attempt to convince Ophelia? Will they go searching for a Temple? So many things that they can do! </p><p>I think that the aftermath of this story is going to be a very interesting one to see. And it is because these questions haven\u2019t been answered that people still believe that a resurrection could be possible. Will it be hard? Yes. Will it succeed? Maybe, or maybe aspects of Molly\u2019s past will come to light as to why it will not, or maybe it just simply will not. </p><p>One of the things that I really like about D&amp;D is that it encapsulates the phrase \u201cif there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way\u201d. You can do a lot of things and push for a lot of things if you really, really try. Whether you succeed or not is just simply based on luck of the die, but you can definitely, most certainly try. </p><p>It is true that there\u2019s many things that are not going to happen. For one, I don\u2019t believe Clay is there simply to resurrect Molly. I don\u2019t think he CAN. He just happened to be somebody that they found that just so happens to be a cleric and a soft pastel goth. And I find him to be an interesting character to add to the group if that\u2019s what ends up transpiring. Even more, if the M9 decide to move on, I believe that he\u2019ll be one of the key factors in helping the others as they go through their grief about Molly. He just strikes me as that type of person. (Plus he reminds me a lot of Uncle Iroh from ATLA haha)</p><p>For me, it\u2019s ok if the cast decide to leave him be. It\u2019s ok if they decide to not push for resurrection anymore. I think that the moment that the characters decide to do that as a whole will also lead to a big shift in their dynamic. And it\u2019s also ok if they try and fail because of plot reasons or because it turns out that he DID crawl out of the grave and is now someone else. </p><p>Molly is important to a lot of people.
