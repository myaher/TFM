Thanks for your request.</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>\u2018How long with this take?\u2019 Jon asks her as the healer in front of him tends to his wounds.<br/></p><p>\u2018For as long as it takes\u2019<br/></p><p>Y/n was beginning to get fed up with the men in front of her, she only wanted to help people who were injured and in need of help. She had heard of the war between the North and South, Y/n did not care for the reasons they were fighting. Westeros was not her home, she was from Volantis and learned to become a healer just as her mother had done. Her mother was well known and was frequently sort after to heal the wounded, the sick and the dying. She also assisted in many of the births of children in Volantis, Y/n was so proud of her mother and hoped she felt the same about her daughter.</p><p>It had been a big decision to leave her home behind, and her mother but Y/n wanted to see the world. To use what she had learnt to save others, maybe even one day teaching her own children and grandchildren. That was if a man would marry her, Y/n did not have a fortune or anything to offer a man. Y/n had a big heart, which was one of the many reasons she wished to help others but this man was trying her patience and she could feel herself about to snap.</p><p>\u2018I have to get back\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Sit still\u2019 Y/n tells him firmly\u00a0\u2018I have not finished cleaning your wounds, if I do not take care of them they will fester\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018It stings\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Well maybe you should have thought about that before drinking yourself into a stupor and fighting with one of the guards\u2019 Y/n adds, she had saw the whole drama unfold as she was tending to the wounded. One of the guards, she could not recall his name, called Jon a bastard. It was Jon he threw the first punch which connected with the guards nose, breaking it with a loud crunch.</p><p>Other men decided to join in and even took turns to beat him, by throwing punches on his body or kicking him with their heavy boots. It had taken some time to pry the men away from Jon, Rob the king of the North had heard the commotion and pulled his brother away. The king had asked her to take care of Jon, whilst he sorted out the mess that had been created. Jon had not been pleased to be escorted away and to be taken care of by a woman.</p><p>\u2018He called me a bastard\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018So, I am a bastard. I never knew my father\u2019 she informs him\u00a0\u2018I know what I am and I am not ashamed\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Where is your father?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I do not know, he abandoned my mother when she told him she was with child. He said my mother was a whore, that I was no child of his and cast her out. He married another who had a large dowry and lands, my mother had nothing. It was my mother who raised me, who taught me how to help people and to use herbs to heal\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Your mother, where is she now?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018She is in Volantis, helpings others just as I am. I heard what happened to your father, I am sorry that he died like that\u2019\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018He bent the knee and they still murdered him, he sought the truth and they killed him for it\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I heard Joffrey was a cruel king\u2019\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018Aye he is\u2019 Jon adds, he looks up at Y/n and watches as she threads the needle through his skin making him grimace.<br/></p><p>\u2018I am sorry, I am trying to be as gentle as I can\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018It hurts only a little\u2019<br/></p><p>He sits in silence trying to distract himself from the pain, time seems to pass slowly with each stitch. Y/n was concentrating hard as she tried to make this painless as possible, with the last stitch she pulled it tightly ensuring it did not come loss again. Cutting of the excess thread with a knife she felt rather pleased with her work, she was getting better with her sewing. Although she much prefered to work with herbs and making her medicines.</p><p>\u2018There we are much better, we need to keep those in for a while and you need to come back so I can check it has not become infected\u2019<br/></p><p>He leaves her that night and returns back to his own tent, his brother had sought him out and was angry at him for reacting that way. He informed Jon that many of the lords and his mother Catelyn, had demanded they cast him out. Send him back to Winterfell or even to the wall because of his reckless behaviour. Rob however did not listen to them, Jon was his brother and was still grieving for his father. Ned kept Jon safe, Catelyn had never cared for Jon and although she tried to hide her distaste Rob knew of his mother&rsquo;s actions. Rob had warned his brother not to react to their words, he did not car if they shared a different mother or his fathers infidelity.</p><p>Jon was happy to learn he could stay with Rob and fight by his side, to help bring his sisters back to their mother Catelyn and away from the Lannister\u2019s clutches.</p><p>He did as he asked at returned back to Y/n who checked on his wounds, it was healing nicely and had not shown signs of festering. However what he did not expect was to find himself drawn to her, she was a beauty, there was no denying it. Jon needed to be around her, he felt calm and soothed when he was around her. Y/n enjoyed his company, she was happy that he was not like the other men at the camp. They would grab her and try to convince her to come back to their tent, she did want them and tried to find ways to avoid them. She kept herself busy by tending to the wounded along with the other healers and maesters.\u00a0</p><p>It did not take long for the others to notice that Jon was spending a lot of his time with Y/n, the news had soon reached Catelyn\u2019s ears who worried that Jon would follow the footsteps of his father. She did wish for the young healer to become with child with another bastard. Catelyn had spoken with Rob, she wished for Rob to speak with Jon, warning him to stay away from the healing tent.</p><p>Rob decided to see if they were right, he knew his brother, Jon had never been interested in women. Jon believed he had nothing to offer them, but Rob knew that he deserved love and happiness. No matter what his mother told him, she cared not for Jon or what happened to him. So Rob watches from a distance, he follows his brother, ensuring that he is not seen by either Y/n or Jon. He walks behind them as they walk with side by side, talking quietly, he cannot hear what they are discussing. What he sees surprises him, he sees his brother smile, he has only saw this a few times in his life. Jon cares deeply for the woman, he has the same look when he looks at Talisa. He hopes that his brother will follow his heart and not doubt himself, pushing Y/n away.\u00a0</p><p>The next day Rob attempts to talk to his brother, to understand what was truly going on between his brother and the young woman healer. It was understable that Jon was angered that gossip had spread among the camp, many believing he had bedded Y/n. Jon had heard nothing from Y/n that she had heard such rumours and was frightened what would happen to her if people started to believe them. Rob had asked Jon if he cared for Y/n, if he loved her even, Jon was falling for her and was too scared to admit it. Although he did not confess his feelings, Rob could see that his brother did instead love Y/n. He knew Jon would never say anything to her, he decided to take matters into his own hands and speak with her himself.\u00a0</p><p>He waits till his brother leaves and makes her way to the healing tent, there he finds Y/n sitting at a table reading a thick book as the injured rest. In quick strides he walks over to the young woman, he clears his throat in order to grab her attention. After a few moments she looks away from the book and looks up at him, her eyes widen in shock as she finds him observing her.</p><p>\u2018Your Grace, my humble apologies. I was in a world of my own\u2019 Y/n speaks up as she stands from her seat and stands before him.<br/></p><p>\u2018There is no need to apologise\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018How may I help you your Grace?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Please call me Rob. I have come to speak with you about my brother Jon\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is he well? He has not been fighting again?\u2019 she asked, her heart beating rapidly in her chest.<br/></p><p>\u2018Jon is alright, I have heard rumours regarding you and my brother?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Rumours? What rumours?\u2019<br/></p><p>Y/n crosses her arms in front of her chest, she cannot believe that people are gossiping about her and she had no idea about it.</p><p>\u2018You have been seen alone and in the company of my brother\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018He is my friend, he has been kind to be and has not taken advantage of me in anyway\u2019 Y/n insists\u00a0\u2018Jon is not the sort, not like some of the men at the camp who try to bed me\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Aye Jon is not like that, I do not believe him. My mother on the other hand believes it, she does not like Jon and believes we should cast him out, as well as you\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Why?! I have not doing anything wrong, neither has Jon. It would kill him if he had to leave, he wants to be here with you, helping his brother\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018There is something that my brother is not telling you Y/n, he is too afraid to tell you himself\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018He can tell me anything, he can trust me. We have become close friends, he has nothing to be afraid of\u2019 she feels her walls coming down, feeling less defensive she unfolds her arms\u00a0\u2018What is it? Have I done something wrong to upset him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jon loves you\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Love me?\u2019 Y/n is shocked with the change of events, <i>Jon couldn\u2019t possibly love me </i>she thought to herself\u00a0\u2018Jon cannot love me, I am no one. I have nothing to offer him, he is the son of a Lord. I am just a healer\u2019</p><p>Y/n turns her back and moves away from the king, she returns to the table and begins to tidy her books away.</p><p>\u2018You and Jon so alike, he believes he does not deserve you and here you are believing you are not good enough for my brother. Please Y/n, go see my brother talk to him. You cannot deny you feel the same towards him, I have seen you together, I saw how you look at one another\u2019<br/></p><p>Holding her books against her chest, once again she turns to look at him and is silent for a moment.</p><p>\u2018I will try\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018That\u2019s all that I ask, my brother has never known love. Although my sisters and my brothers care for him very much, he finds it hard to express himself. Do not hate him if he does not confess his true feelings\u2019<br/></p><p>Rob walks away from her and looks upon his injured men, Y/n has no idea what to think or what to do.</p><p>Jon returns to the healing tent later that night, it is time for Y/n to remove the stitches, he cannot wait as it had become more itchy as it began to heal. It was dark and Robs men had began to quieten down for the night, he found Y/n once again tending to the wounded. He decided to sit down on a cot, waiting patiently as she finished up. Y/n wipes her bloody hands on her apron and makes her way over to him, she was growing tired of cleaning blood from her hands.</p><p>\u2018Hello Jon, I just need to wash my hands then we can work on removing your stitches\u2019<br/></p><p>Y/n walks towards her large desk, she picks up a large jug and pours in fresh water into a bowl. Jon watches her carefully, he finds himself looking at her curvy figure, the way her long y/c braid rested against her back as it almost reached her hips. Once she finds that the blood has been washed from her skin, Y/n makes her way over to Jon who smiles when she heads his way. Y/n stands close to him as she takes a pair of scissors from the pocket of her apron, she carefully begins to snip away the threads; tugging carefully as she pulled it from his skin.</p><p>\u2018I am sorry if this hurts\u2019 Y/n apologises \u2018I am glad you came here, in fact I needed to speak with you, your brother came to see me today\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018What did he say to you?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Well he told me that people had been gossiping about us\u2019\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018Yes I he told me yesterday, I thought he might believe them but he never did. I would never do anything to hurt you Y/n\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I know you wouldn\u2019t Jon, but I need to know what Rob said was true\u2019 she informs him\u00a0\u2018He told me that you loved me\u2019</p><p>Jon looks away unable to look at her in the eyes, for the moment he felt worried that she had known he secret and betrayed that his brother talked to her without him knowing.</p><p>\u2018He told you that?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018He did, is it true? Please Jon I deserve the truth\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018He\u2019s right, I do. I am sorry about what he told you, the last thing you need is to find out that I have feelings for you. I do not deserve you\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t say that Jon, not until you hear what I have to say\u2019 Y/n begs him, taking a deep breath she decides to tell him everything\u00a0\u2018I&hellip;I love you\u2019<br/></p><p>Upon hearing her words he looks up at her, their eyes connecting at once, at first he believes he had imagined it all and he must have fallen and hit his head.</p><p>\u2018Say that again\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I love you Jon\u2019<br/></p><p>Without hesitating he stands up from the cot, he places his hands onto her waist and pulls her close. Jon closes the distance between them as he crashes his lips against hers. His actions surprises her and takes her a few moments to realise what was happening, instead of pushing him away as Jon thinks she will; Y/n responds to his kisses and kisses him in return. Jon pulls away for a moment, he cups her face with his rough hands as his thumbs stroke her alabaster skin.</p><p>\u2018Do you mean it? Do you truly love me?\u2019 he needs reassurance that she feels the same, part him doubting that she felt love for him.<br/></p><p>\u2018Of course I mean it, I love you\u2019</p><p>Y/n moves away from him and takes his hand into hers, she leads him away from the other patients and further along the tent. At the bottom of the tent Y/n has her own area with a bed which is hidden by a large sheet, to give her privacy.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018Where are we going?\u2019 he asks her, as she continues to pull at his hand.<br/></p><p>\u2018Just trust me\u2019<br/></p><p>Behind the sheet is a small cot, covered with a green woolen blanket and by her bed were a small pile of books. Jon tries to let go of her hand and back away, but still she takes a firm hold.<br/></p><p>\u2018Y/n you don\u2019t have to do this?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Are you worried what will happen if we lay together?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Maybe we should think about this first, shouldn\u2019t we be man and wife before we share the same bed?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Jon what I have learnt healing people and saving people is that our lives are so short, one day we will be here and the next we are not. I do not care what other people think about me, what I do with my body and my heart is my choice; no others\u2019 Y/n declares as she moves her body against his\u00a0\u2018I have grown to love you Jon, you make me happy and distract me from what I have to see everyday in this tent. I wish to spend the rest of my days with you, if you would have me\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Of course I would have you, I would be a fool if I did not but I have nothing to offer you. I have no gold, no lands and no title\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I do not care for trivial things, I want you and only you. Would you take me Jon?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I um&hellip;I have&hellip;never lain with a woman before\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Never?\u2019<br/></p><p>That surprised her, Jon was a handsome man and could have any woman he liked. But she knew that he would be scared putting a baby in a woman\u2019s belly, it did not frighten her and the idea of carrying his child made her happy.</p><p>\u2018No. Have you?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I have not, but I know that I want to be with you. I heard the men, you and Rob will soon be marching against the Lannisters. I am scared that you may never come back\u2019 Y/n confesses at last, she wishes to make as many memories with him before fate may take him away from her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018I will come back to you Y/n I promise\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018You cannot promise me that, you don\u2019t know what is going to happen when you get there\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Nothing will stop me from coming back to you\u2019 Jon tells her firmly before kissing her lips again, he can feel is resolve slowly disappearing and knows it won&rsquo;t be long until his body betrays him. One of his hands moves to her hip where he pulls her against his body, the other moves to the back of her head as his fingers tangle into her long locks.<br/></p><p>The kiss turns passionate as their lips lock together, Y/n\u2019s hands move in front of her and begins to untie his black cloak, slowly the cloak falls from his shoulders and onto the ground.</p><p>\u2018Y/n&hellip;\u2019 Jon mumbles as he from her lips.<br/></p><p>\u2018I want you Jon, but I won&rsquo;t stop you if you want to leave right now\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018If we do this it will change everything, I will be your and you will be mine\u2019\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018I want to be yours and no others\u2019<br/></p><p>Jon\u2019s heart swells in his chest upon hearing her words, immediately his lips crash against hers, her hands grip onto his doublet as she tries not to fall backwards with the force of his kiss. Without breaking the kiss Y/n continues to shed Jon out of his clothing, she unbuckles his sword from his waist as it too falls to the ground with his cloak. Y/n then starts unbuttoning his doublet, as she pulls it down his arms she leaves him only in his pants and tunic. Y/n pulls away, as she stands before him she begins to undo the ribbons of her dress. She then begins to remove her dress, Y/n feels vulnerable as stands naked as the day she was born.</p><p>She tries to cover her breasts as Jon stares at her, his eyes widen as he takes in her form, Y/n is scared that he does not like what he sees. However Jon stops her from covering herself, he never wants her to hide her beautiful body from him.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018You are so beautiful\u2019 he tells her.</p><p>Y/n smiles up at him, taking his hand into her she leads him to her coat, she is the first to lie down on to the coat, lying down on her back. She can\u2019t see the conflict in Jon\u2019s eyes but she doesn&rsquo;t want him to go just yet.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you want me?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Gods I want you, I am scared that I may put a baby inside of you\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Jon there is nothing to worry about, sometimes it takes several times before a woman is with child. My mum helped as a midwife, she knew several noblewomen who had trouble falling with child\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Is that true?\u2019 he asks, feeling unsure.<br/></p><p>\u2018Yes my mother has assisted in delivering over forty children, still she helps women when the time comes\u2019<br/></p><p>He thinks for a moment, he wants to believe her but also scared that when he leaves her to fight; she may learn she is carrying his child. Jon joins her onto the cot, nestled between her thighs; his body hovers over hers as he rested on his forearms by her head. Y/n strokes his face delicately with her head, she senses that he is nervous as was she. Y/n had kissed a man before but had never gone as far as to show her naked form. She loved Jon and trusted that he would never hurt her but also believed him when he said that he was hers and she was his.</p><p>\u2018Do you want to stop?\u2019 she asks him one final time.<br/></p><p>\u2018No\u2019<br/></p><p>Y/n helps him remove his tunic over his head, exposing his bare chest, she is surprised that he has such are bare chest, she unable to help herself as she runs her fingers across his chest and then down to his stomach.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018I heard that that it can hurt the first time a woman lays with a man\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I promise to be gentle\u2019<br/></p><p>Y/n lays another kisses against his own, they forget about the others on the other side of the sheet as they try to be as quiet as they can. A small groan escapes Jon\u2019s mouth as he finds himself hardening against, his instinct takes over as rocks himself against her core. He had heard stories from both Rob and Theon about the whore house, about laying with women and was worried that he was not skilled as they were. He moves away from her lips and starts kissing her throat before making his way down to her chest. Moving down her body he lays kisses down her body until he moves his face over her core. Y/n has no idea what he was doing and allowed him to continue.</p><p>She jumps as she feels warm breath at her entrance, she did not know men doing such things.</p><p>\u2018Jon what are you doing?\u2019 she quietly asks, but he does not answer and instead he flicks his tongue against her core. The sensation is new to Y/n, she hadn\u2019t felt anything quite like it, she remains laying on her back with her head resting against the pillow.\u00a0<br/></p><p>As Jon continues to slowly lick her, something begins to stir inside of her, it was the pleasure she had heard many women spoke of before. They were right, it felt wonderful, gasps had began to leave her lips as Jon continue with his administrations. However her back arches from the cot as he inserts one of his fingers inside of her, little by little he moves inside of her. He feels her tighten around him as her body reacts to the instruction, he tries his hardest not to hurt her but Jon knows that this with make it easier for her later.</p><p>Y/n\u2019s hands move to the back of his head, she scrapes her fingernails against his scalp before holding tightly onto his dark curls.</p><p>\u2018Jon&hellip;\u2019 she moans before covering her mouth with her hand.<br/></p><p>Something strange is building inside of her that she can no longer control, her breathing is becoming laboured and feels a tingling sensation growing between her legs.</p><p>\u2018Oh&hellip;..Jon\u2019<br/></p><p>She can\u2019t hold off anything and cries out, Jon feels Y/n pulsating around his finger. As she finally relaxes he removes his finger, he moves up her body and hovers over her once again.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018That&hellip;that was&hellip;.wonderful\u2019\u00a0<br/></p><p>Jon cannot help but smirk down her, seeing her out of breath and her cheeks rosy. Her words inflate his ego and cannot help but feel proud that he in fact had pleased her. Y/n finally catches her breath and still finds herself shocked to see him smiling, it was not something he did a lot and was happy he felt comfortable with her.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m ready Jon\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Are you sure?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018I am, I\u2019m not going to change my mind\u2019 she tells him firmly.</p><p>Jon starts to undo his pants and is not surprised to find himself rock hard, although Y/n cannot believe how big he really is. She is aware that first times aren\u2019t always so easy but the next time in fact is quite pleasurable. At first he rubs himself against her core, the head of his penis nudging against her entrance.</p><p>\u2018I promise to be as gentle as I can\u2019<br/></p><p>Y/n says nothing as she prepares for the pain, slowly Jon inserts his penis inside of her channel, Y/n cries out again she covers her mouth with her hand. She does wish for people to hear what she and Jon are doing, it stings as he moves further inside of her.</p><p>\u2018I am sorry\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Keep going Jon\u2019 she tells him, not wanting him to stop\u00a0\u2018I will be fine, please\u2019<br/></p><p>He does as she asks and does not stop until he is all the way inside of her, he wants Y/n to adjust to him being inside her. As he look down he notices a small tear fall down from her eye and continue her cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m hurting you\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018It stings only a little, I was told it would hurt but I will be alright. I promise, you can move if you like\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018Alright\u2019<br/></p><p>Jon had never felt anything like it before, it was amazing and would happy like to stay buried within her. He moves his hips bit by bit, allowing Y/n to become accustomed to the sensations. Soon the pain had begun to dissipate and again was replaced by pleasure she could not explain. Jon leans down and begins to kiss her lips, Y/n places her hand on the back of his neck as she held him in place. His tongue escapes his mouth and begins to massage his tongue against hers, this had been the most erotic experience the couple had experienced. His hips are soon moving fast against hers, quiet groans are coming from his throat must are silenced when they kiss.</p><p>Soon his body is betraying him and finds himself drawing closer to the edge quicker than he would imagined, but feeling his cock being massaged by her velvet channel was turning him on more than he could imagine.</p><p>His movements become slower as he feels his orgasm coming forward, Jon with a few more thrusts empties himself inside of her before collapsing against her bosoms. His breathing is laboured as he remains sheathed inside of her, Y/n begins stroking her fingers through his curls lulling him to a slumber, not caring that anyone could walk in at that moment but happy he was in the arms of a woman he loved.</p>",

Thanks for your request.</p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>\u2018How long with this take?\u2019 Jon asks her as the healer in front of him tends to his wounds.<br></p><p>\u2018For as long as it takes\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n was beginning to get fed up with the men in front of her, she only wanted to help people who were injured and in need of help. She had heard of the war between the North and South, Y/n did not care for the reasons they were fighting. Westeros was not her home, she was from Volantis and learned to become a healer just as her mother had done. Her mother was well known and was frequently sort after to heal the wounded, the sick and the dying. She also assisted in many of the births of children in Volantis, Y/n was so proud of her mother and hoped she felt the same about her daughter.</p><p>It had been a big decision to leave her home behind, and her mother but Y/n wanted to see the world. To use what she had learnt to save others, maybe even one day teaching her own children and grandchildren. That was if a man would marry her, Y/n did not have a fortune or anything to offer a man. Y/n had a big heart, which was one of the many reasons she wished to help others but this man was trying her patience and she could feel herself about to snap.</p><p>\u2018I have to get back\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Sit still\u2019 Y/n tells him firmly\u00a0\u2018I have not finished cleaning your wounds, if I do not take care of them they will fester\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018It stings\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Well maybe you should have thought about that before drinking yourself into a stupor and fighting with one of the guards\u2019 Y/n adds, she had saw the whole drama unfold as she was tending to the wounded. One of the guards, she could not recall his name, called Jon a bastard. It was Jon he threw the first punch which connected with the guards nose, breaking it with a loud crunch.</p><p>Other men decided to join in and even took turns to beat him, by throwing punches on his body or kicking him with their heavy boots. It had taken some time to pry the men away from Jon, Rob the king of the North had heard the commotion and pulled his brother away. The king had asked her to take care of Jon, whilst he sorted out the mess that had been created. Jon had not been pleased to be escorted away and to be taken care of by a woman.</p><p>\u2018He called me a bastard\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018So, I am a bastard. I never knew my father\u2019 she informs him\u00a0\u2018I know what I am and I am not ashamed\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Where is your father?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I do not know, he abandoned my mother when she told him she was with child. He said my mother was a whore, that I was no child of his and cast her out. He married another who had a large dowry and lands, my mother had nothing. It was my mother who raised me, who taught me how to help people and to use herbs to heal\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Your mother, where is she now?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018She is in Volantis, helpings others just as I am. I heard what happened to your father, I am sorry that he died like that\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018He bent the knee and they still murdered him, he sought the truth and they killed him for it\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I heard Joffrey was a cruel king\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018Aye he is\u2019 Jon adds, he looks up at Y/n and watches as she threads the needle through his skin making him grimace.<br></p><p>\u2018I am sorry, I am trying to be as gentle as I can\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018It hurts only a little\u2019<br></p><p>He sits in silence trying to distract himself from the pain, time seems to pass slowly with each stitch. Y/n was concentrating hard as she tried to make this painless as possible, with the last stitch she pulled it tightly ensuring it did not come loss again. Cutting of the excess thread with a knife she felt rather pleased with her work, she was getting better with her sewing. Although she much prefered to work with herbs and making her medicines.</p><p>\u2018There we are much better, we need to keep those in for a while and you need to come back so I can check it has not become infected\u2019<br></p><p>He leaves her that night and returns back to his own tent, his brother had sought him out and was angry at him for reacting that way. He informed Jon that many of the lords and his mother Catelyn, had demanded they cast him out. Send him back to Winterfell or even to the wall because of his reckless behaviour. Rob however did not listen to them, Jon was his brother and was still grieving for his father. Ned kept Jon safe, Catelyn had never cared for Jon and although she tried to hide her distaste Rob knew of his mother\u2019s actions. Rob had warned his brother not to react to their words, he did not car if they shared a different mother or his fathers infidelity.</p><p>Jon was happy to learn he could stay with Rob and fight by his side, to help bring his sisters back to their mother Catelyn and away from the Lannister\u2019s clutches.</p><p>He did as he asked at returned back to Y/n who checked on his wounds, it was healing nicely and had not shown signs of festering. However what he did not expect was to find himself drawn to her, she was a beauty, there was no denying it. Jon needed to be around her, he felt calm and soothed when he was around her. Y/n enjoyed his company, she was happy that he was not like the other men at the camp. They would grab her and try to convince her to come back to their tent, she did want them and tried to find ways to avoid them. She kept herself busy by tending to the wounded along with the other healers and maesters.\u00a0</p><p>It did not take long for the others to notice that Jon was spending a lot of his time with Y/n, the news had soon reached Catelyn\u2019s ears who worried that Jon would follow the footsteps of his father. She did wish for the young healer to become with child with another bastard. Catelyn had spoken with Rob, she wished for Rob to speak with Jon, warning him to stay away from the healing tent.</p><p>Rob decided to see if they were right, he knew his brother, Jon had never been interested in women. Jon believed he had nothing to offer them, but Rob knew that he deserved love and happiness. No matter what his mother told him, she cared not for Jon or what happened to him. So Rob watches from a distance, he follows his brother, ensuring that he is not seen by either Y/n or Jon. He walks behind them as they walk with side by side, talking quietly, he cannot hear what they are discussing. What he sees surprises him, he sees his brother smile, he has only saw this a few times in his life. Jon cares deeply for the woman, he has the same look when he looks at Talisa. He hopes that his brother will follow his heart and not doubt himself, pushing Y/n away.\u00a0</p><p>The next day Rob attempts to talk to his brother, to understand what was truly going on between his brother and the young woman healer. It was understable that Jon was angered that gossip had spread among the camp, many believing he had bedded Y/n. Jon had heard nothing from Y/n that she had heard such rumours and was frightened what would happen to her if people started to believe them. Rob had asked Jon if he cared for Y/n, if he loved her even, Jon was falling for her and was too scared to admit it. Although he did not confess his feelings, Rob could see that his brother did instead love Y/n. He knew Jon would never say anything to her, he decided to take matters into his own hands and speak with her himself.\u00a0</p><p>He waits till his brother leaves and makes her way to the healing tent, there he finds Y/n sitting at a table reading a thick book as the injured rest. In quick strides he walks over to the young woman, he clears his throat in order to grab her attention. After a few moments she looks away from the book and looks up at him, her eyes widen in shock as she finds him observing her.</p><p>\u2018Your Grace, my humble apologies. I was in a world of my own\u2019 Y/n speaks up as she stands from her seat and stands before him.<br></p><p>\u2018There is no need to apologise\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018How may I help you your Grace?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Please call me Rob. I have come to speak with you about my brother Jon\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is he well? He has not been fighting again?\u2019 she asked, her heart beating rapidly in her chest.<br></p><p>\u2018Jon is alright, I have heard rumours regarding you and my brother?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Rumours? What rumours?\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n crosses her arms in front of her chest, she cannot believe that people are gossiping about her and she had no idea about it.</p><p>\u2018You have been seen alone and in the company of my brother\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018He is my friend, he has been kind to be and has not taken advantage of me in anyway\u2019 Y/n insists\u00a0\u2018Jon is not the sort, not like some of the men at the camp who try to bed me\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Aye Jon is not like that, I do not believe him. My mother on the other hand believes it, she does not like Jon and believes we should cast him out, as well as you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Why?! I have not doing anything wrong, neither has Jon. It would kill him if he had to leave, he wants to be here with you, helping his brother\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018There is something that my brother is not telling you Y/n, he is too afraid to tell you himself\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018He can tell me anything, he can trust me. We have become close friends, he has nothing to be afraid of\u2019 she feels her walls coming down, feeling less defensive she unfolds her arms\u00a0\u2018What is it? Have I done something wrong to upset him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jon loves you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Love me?\u2019 Y/n is shocked with the change of events, <i>Jon couldn\u2019t possibly love me </i>she thought to herself\u00a0\u2018Jon cannot love me, I am no one. I have nothing to offer him, he is the son of a Lord. I am just a healer\u2019</p><p>Y/n turns her back and moves away from the king, she returns to the table and begins to tidy her books away.</p><p>\u2018You and Jon so alike, he believes he does not deserve you and here you are believing you are not good enough for my brother. Please Y/n, go see my brother talk to him. You cannot deny you feel the same towards him, I have seen you together, I saw how you look at one another\u2019<br></p><p>Holding her books against her chest, once again she turns to look at him and is silent for a moment.</p><p>\u2018I will try\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018That\u2019s all that I ask, my brother has never known love. Although my sisters and my brothers care for him very much, he finds it hard to express himself. Do not hate him if he does not confess his true feelings\u2019<br></p><p>Rob walks away from her and looks upon his injured men, Y/n has no idea what to think or what to do.</p><p>Jon returns to the healing tent later that night, it is time for Y/n to remove the stitches, he cannot wait as it had become more itchy as it began to heal. It was dark and Robs men had began to quieten down for the night, he found Y/n once again tending to the wounded. He decided to sit down on a cot, waiting patiently as she finished up. Y/n wipes her bloody hands on her apron and makes her way over to him, she was growing tired of cleaning blood from her hands.</p><p>\u2018Hello Jon, I just need to wash my hands then we can work on removing your stitches\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n walks towards her large desk, she picks up a large jug and pours in fresh water into a bowl. Jon watches her carefully, he finds himself looking at her curvy figure, the way her long y/c braid rested against her back as it almost reached her hips. Once she finds that the blood has been washed from her skin, Y/n makes her way over to Jon who smiles when she heads his way. Y/n stands close to him as she takes a pair of scissors from the pocket of her apron, she carefully begins to snip away the threads; tugging carefully as she pulled it from his skin.</p><p>\u2018I am sorry if this hurts\u2019 Y/n apologises \u2018I am glad you came here, in fact I needed to speak with you, your brother came to see me today\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018What did he say to you?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Well he told me that people had been gossiping about us\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018Yes I he told me yesterday, I thought he might believe them but he never did. I would never do anything to hurt you Y/n\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I know you wouldn\u2019t Jon, but I need to know what Rob said was true\u2019 she informs him\u00a0\u2018He told me that you loved me\u2019</p><p>Jon looks away unable to look at her in the eyes, for the moment he felt worried that she had known he secret and betrayed that his brother talked to her without him knowing.</p><p>\u2018He told you that?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018He did, is it true? Please Jon I deserve the truth\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018He\u2019s right, I do. I am sorry about what he told you, the last thing you need is to find out that I have feelings for you. I do not deserve you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t say that Jon, not until you hear what I have to say\u2019 Y/n begs him, taking a deep breath she decides to tell him everything\u00a0\u2018I\u2026I love you\u2019<br></p><p>Upon hearing her words he looks up at her, their eyes connecting at once, at first he believes he had imagined it all and he must have fallen and hit his head.</p><p>\u2018Say that again\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I love you Jon\u2019<br></p><p>Without hesitating he stands up from the cot, he places his hands onto her waist and pulls her close. Jon closes the distance between them as he crashes his lips against hers. His actions surprises her and takes her a few moments to realise what was happening, instead of pushing him away as Jon thinks she will; Y/n responds to his kisses and kisses him in return. Jon pulls away for a moment, he cups her face with his rough hands as his thumbs stroke her alabaster skin.</p><p>\u2018Do you mean it? Do you truly love me?\u2019 he needs reassurance that she feels the same, part him doubting that she felt love for him.<br></p><p>\u2018Of course I mean it, I love you\u2019</p><p>Y/n moves away from him and takes his hand into hers, she leads him away from the other patients and further along the tent. At the bottom of the tent Y/n has her own area with a bed which is hidden by a large sheet, to give her privacy.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018Where are we going?\u2019 he asks her, as she continues to pull at his hand.<br></p><p>\u2018Just trust me\u2019<br></p><p>Behind the sheet is a small cot, covered with a green woolen blanket and by her bed were a small pile of books. Jon tries to let go of her hand and back away, but still she takes a firm hold.<br></p><p>\u2018Y/n you don\u2019t have to do this?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Are you worried what will happen if we lay together?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Maybe we should think about this first, shouldn\u2019t we be man and wife before we share the same bed?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Jon what I have learnt healing people and saving people is that our lives are so short, one day we will be here and the next we are not. I do not care what other people think about me, what I do with my body and my heart is my choice; no others\u2019 Y/n declares as she moves her body against his\u00a0\u2018I have grown to love you Jon, you make me happy and distract me from what I have to see everyday in this tent. I wish to spend the rest of my days with you, if you would have me\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Of course I would have you, I would be a fool if I did not but I have nothing to offer you. I have no gold, no lands and no title\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I do not care for trivial things, I want you and only you. Would you take me Jon?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I um\u2026I have\u2026never lain with a woman before\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Never?\u2019<br></p><p>That surprised her, Jon was a handsome man and could have any woman he liked. But she knew that he would be scared putting a baby in a woman\u2019s belly, it did not frighten her and the idea of carrying his child made her happy.</p><p>\u2018No. Have you?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I have not, but I know that I want to be with you. I heard the men, you and Rob will soon be marching against the Lannisters. I am scared that you may never come back\u2019 Y/n confesses at last, she wishes to make as many memories with him before fate may take him away from her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018I will come back to you Y/n I promise\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018You cannot promise me that, you don\u2019t know what is going to happen when you get there\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Nothing will stop me from coming back to you\u2019 Jon tells her firmly before kissing her lips again, he can feel is resolve slowly disappearing and knows it won\u2019t be long until his body betrays him. One of his hands moves to her hip where he pulls her against his body, the other moves to the back of her head as his fingers tangle into her long locks.<br></p><p>The kiss turns passionate as their lips lock together, Y/n\u2019s hands move in front of her and begins to untie his black cloak, slowly the cloak falls from his shoulders and onto the ground.</p><p>\u2018Y/n\u2026\u2019 Jon mumbles as he from her lips.<br></p><p>\u2018I want you Jon, but I won\u2019t stop you if you want to leave right now\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018If we do this it will change everything, I will be your and you will be mine\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018I want to be yours and no others\u2019<br></p><p>Jon\u2019s heart swells in his chest upon hearing her words, immediately his lips crash against hers, her hands grip onto his doublet as she tries not to fall backwards with the force of his kiss. Without breaking the kiss Y/n continues to shed Jon out of his clothing, she unbuckles his sword from his waist as it too falls to the ground with his cloak. Y/n then starts unbuttoning his doublet, as she pulls it down his arms she leaves him only in his pants and tunic. Y/n pulls away, as she stands before him she begins to undo the ribbons of her dress. She then begins to remove her dress, Y/n feels vulnerable as stands naked as the day she was born.</p><p>She tries to cover her breasts as Jon stares at her, his eyes widen as he takes in her form, Y/n is scared that he does not like what he sees. However Jon stops her from covering herself, he never wants her to hide her beautiful body from him.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018You are so beautiful\u2019 he tells her.</p><p>Y/n smiles up at him, taking his hand into her she leads him to her coat, she is the first to lie down on to the coat, lying down on her back. She can\u2019t see the conflict in Jon\u2019s eyes but she doesn\u2019t want him to go just yet.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you want me?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Gods I want you, I am scared that I may put a baby inside of you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Jon there is nothing to worry about, sometimes it takes several times before a woman is with child. My mum helped as a midwife, she knew several noblewomen who had trouble falling with child\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Is that true?\u2019 he asks, feeling unsure.<br></p><p>\u2018Yes my mother has assisted in delivering over forty children, still she helps women when the time comes\u2019<br></p><p>He thinks for a moment, he wants to believe her but also scared that when he leaves her to fight; she may learn she is carrying his child. Jon joins her onto the cot, nestled between her thighs; his body hovers over hers as he rested on his forearms by her head. Y/n strokes his face delicately with her head, she senses that he is nervous as was she. Y/n had kissed a man before but had never gone as far as to show her naked form. She loved Jon and trusted that he would never hurt her but also believed him when he said that he was hers and she was his.</p><p>\u2018Do you want to stop?\u2019 she asks him one final time.<br></p><p>\u2018No\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n helps him remove his tunic over his head, exposing his bare chest, she is surprised that he has such are bare chest, she unable to help herself as she runs her fingers across his chest and then down to his stomach.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018I heard that that it can hurt the first time a woman lays with a man\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I promise to be gentle\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n lays another kisses against his own, they forget about the others on the other side of the sheet as they try to be as quiet as they can. A small groan escapes Jon\u2019s mouth as he finds himself hardening against, his instinct takes over as rocks himself against her core. He had heard stories from both Rob and Theon about the whore house, about laying with women and was worried that he was not skilled as they were. He moves away from her lips and starts kissing her throat before making his way down to her chest. Moving down her body he lays kisses down her body until he moves his face over her core. Y/n has no idea what he was doing and allowed him to continue.</p><p>She jumps as she feels warm breath at her entrance, she did not know men doing such things.</p><p>\u2018Jon what are you doing?\u2019 she quietly asks, but he does not answer and instead he flicks his tongue against her core. The sensation is new to Y/n, she hadn\u2019t felt anything quite like it, she remains laying on her back with her head resting against the pillow.\u00a0<br></p><p>As Jon continues to slowly lick her, something begins to stir inside of her, it was the pleasure she had heard many women spoke of before. They were right, it felt wonderful, gasps had began to leave her lips as Jon continue with his administrations. However her back arches from the cot as he inserts one of his fingers inside of her, little by little he moves inside of her. He feels her tighten around him as her body reacts to the instruction, he tries his hardest not to hurt her but Jon knows that this with make it easier for her later.</p><p>Y/n\u2019s hands move to the back of his head, she scrapes her fingernails against his scalp before holding tightly onto his dark curls.</p><p>\u2018Jon\u2026\u2019 she moans before covering her mouth with her hand.<br></p><p>Something strange is building inside of her that she can no longer control, her breathing is becoming laboured and feels a tingling sensation growing between her legs.</p><p>\u2018Oh\u2026..Jon\u2019<br></p><p>She can\u2019t hold off anything and cries out, Jon feels Y/n pulsating around his finger. As she finally relaxes he removes his finger, he moves up her body and hovers over her once again.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018That\u2026that was\u2026.wonderful\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>Jon cannot help but smirk down her, seeing her out of breath and her cheeks rosy. Her words inflate his ego and cannot help but feel proud that he in fact had pleased her. Y/n finally catches her breath and still finds herself shocked to see him smiling, it was not something he did a lot and was happy he felt comfortable with her.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m ready Jon\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Are you sure?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I am, I\u2019m not going to change my mind\u2019 she tells him firmly.</p><p>Jon starts to undo his pants and is not surprised to find himself rock hard, although Y/n cannot believe how big he really is. She is aware that first times aren\u2019t always so easy but the next time in fact is quite pleasurable. At first he rubs himself against her core, the head of his penis nudging against her entrance.</p><p>\u2018I promise to be as gentle as I can\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n says nothing as she prepares for the pain, slowly Jon inserts his penis inside of her channel, Y/n cries out again she covers her mouth with her hand. She does wish for people to hear what she and Jon are doing, it stings as he moves further inside of her.</p><p>\u2018I am sorry\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Keep going Jon\u2019 she tells him, not wanting him to stop\u00a0\u2018I will be fine, please\u2019<br></p><p>He does as she asks and does not stop until he is all the way inside of her, he wants Y/n to adjust to him being inside her. As he look down he notices a small tear fall down from her eye and continue her cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m hurting you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018It stings only a little, I was told it would hurt but I will be alright. I promise, you can move if you like\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Alright\u2019<br></p><p>Jon had never felt anything like it before, it was amazing and would happy like to stay buried within her. He moves his hips bit by bit, allowing Y/n to become accustomed to the sensations. Soon the pain had begun to dissipate and again was replaced by pleasure she could not explain. Jon leans down and begins to kiss her lips, Y/n places her hand on the back of his neck as she held him in place. His tongue escapes his mouth and begins to massage his tongue against hers, this had been the most erotic experience the couple had experienced. His hips are soon moving fast against hers, quiet groans are coming from his throat must are silenced when they kiss.</p><p>Soon his body is betraying him and finds himself drawing closer to the edge quicker than he would imagined, but feeling his cock being massaged by her velvet channel was turning him on more than he could imagine.</p><p>His movements become slower as he feels his orgasm coming forward, Jon with a few more thrusts empties himself inside of her before collapsing against her bosoms. His breathing is laboured as he remains sheathed inside of her, Y/n begins stroking her fingers through his curls lulling him to a slumber, not caring that anyone could walk in at that moment but happy he was in the arms of a woman he loved.</p></p>",

Thanks for your request.</p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>\u2018How long with this take?\u2019 Jon asks her as the healer in front of him tends to his wounds.<br></p><p>\u2018For as long as it takes\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n was beginning to get fed up with the men in front of her, she only wanted to help people who were injured and in need of help. She had heard of the war between the North and South, Y/n did not care for the reasons they were fighting. Westeros was not her home, she was from Volantis and learned to become a healer just as her mother had done. Her mother was well known and was frequently sort after to heal the wounded, the sick and the dying. She also assisted in many of the births of children in Volantis, Y/n was so proud of her mother and hoped she felt the same about her daughter.</p><p>It had been a big decision to leave her home behind, and her mother but Y/n wanted to see the world. To use what she had learnt to save others, maybe even one day teaching her own children and grandchildren. That was if a man would marry her, Y/n did not have a fortune or anything to offer a man. Y/n had a big heart, which was one of the many reasons she wished to help others but this man was trying her patience and she could feel herself about to snap.</p><p>\u2018I have to get back\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Sit still\u2019 Y/n tells him firmly\u00a0\u2018I have not finished cleaning your wounds, if I do not take care of them they will fester\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018It stings\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Well maybe you should have thought about that before drinking yourself into a stupor and fighting with one of the guards\u2019 Y/n adds, she had saw the whole drama unfold as she was tending to the wounded. One of the guards, she could not recall his name, called Jon a bastard. It was Jon he threw the first punch which connected with the guards nose, breaking it with a loud crunch.</p><p>Other men decided to join in and even took turns to beat him, by throwing punches on his body or kicking him with their heavy boots. It had taken some time to pry the men away from Jon, Rob the king of the North had heard the commotion and pulled his brother away. The king had asked her to take care of Jon, whilst he sorted out the mess that had been created. Jon had not been pleased to be escorted away and to be taken care of by a woman.</p><p>\u2018He called me a bastard\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018So, I am a bastard. I never knew my father\u2019 she informs him\u00a0\u2018I know what I am and I am not ashamed\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Where is your father?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I do not know, he abandoned my mother when she told him she was with child. He said my mother was a whore, that I was no child of his and cast her out. He married another who had a large dowry and lands, my mother had nothing. It was my mother who raised me, who taught me how to help people and to use herbs to heal\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Your mother, where is she now?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018She is in Volantis, helpings others just as I am. I heard what happened to your father, I am sorry that he died like that\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018He bent the knee and they still murdered him, he sought the truth and they killed him for it\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I heard Joffrey was a cruel king\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018Aye he is\u2019 Jon adds, he looks up at Y/n and watches as she threads the needle through his skin making him grimace.<br></p><p>\u2018I am sorry, I am trying to be as gentle as I can\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018It hurts only a little\u2019<br></p><p>He sits in silence trying to distract himself from the pain, time seems to pass slowly with each stitch. Y/n was concentrating hard as she tried to make this painless as possible, with the last stitch she pulled it tightly ensuring it did not come loss again. Cutting of the excess thread with a knife she felt rather pleased with her work, she was getting better with her sewing. Although she much prefered to work with herbs and making her medicines.</p><p>\u2018There we are much better, we need to keep those in for a while and you need to come back so I can check it has not become infected\u2019<br></p><p>He leaves her that night and returns back to his own tent, his brother had sought him out and was angry at him for reacting that way. He informed Jon that many of the lords and his mother Catelyn, had demanded they cast him out. Send him back to Winterfell or even to the wall because of his reckless behaviour. Rob however did not listen to them, Jon was his brother and was still grieving for his father. Ned kept Jon safe, Catelyn had never cared for Jon and although she tried to hide her distaste Rob knew of his mother\u2019s actions. Rob had warned his brother not to react to their words, he did not car if they shared a different mother or his fathers infidelity.</p><p>Jon was happy to learn he could stay with Rob and fight by his side, to help bring his sisters back to their mother Catelyn and away from the Lannister\u2019s clutches.</p><p>He did as he asked at returned back to Y/n who checked on his wounds, it was healing nicely and had not shown signs of festering. However what he did not expect was to find himself drawn to her, she was a beauty, there was no denying it. Jon needed to be around her, he felt calm and soothed when he was around her. Y/n enjoyed his company, she was happy that he was not like the other men at the camp. They would grab her and try to convince her to come back to their tent, she did want them and tried to find ways to avoid them. She kept herself busy by tending to the wounded along with the other healers and maesters.\u00a0</p><p>It did not take long for the others to notice that Jon was spending a lot of his time with Y/n, the news had soon reached Catelyn\u2019s ears who worried that Jon would follow the footsteps of his father. She did wish for the young healer to become with child with another bastard. Catelyn had spoken with Rob, she wished for Rob to speak with Jon, warning him to stay away from the healing tent.</p><p>Rob decided to see if they were right, he knew his brother, Jon had never been interested in women. Jon believed he had nothing to offer them, but Rob knew that he deserved love and happiness. No matter what his mother told him, she cared not for Jon or what happened to him. So Rob watches from a distance, he follows his brother, ensuring that he is not seen by either Y/n or Jon. He walks behind them as they walk with side by side, talking quietly, he cannot hear what they are discussing. What he sees surprises him, he sees his brother smile, he has only saw this a few times in his life. Jon cares deeply for the woman, he has the same look when he looks at Talisa. He hopes that his brother will follow his heart and not doubt himself, pushing Y/n away.\u00a0</p><p>The next day Rob attempts to talk to his brother, to understand what was truly going on between his brother and the young woman healer. It was understable that Jon was angered that gossip had spread among the camp, many believing he had bedded Y/n. Jon had heard nothing from Y/n that she had heard such rumours and was frightened what would happen to her if people started to believe them. Rob had asked Jon if he cared for Y/n, if he loved her even, Jon was falling for her and was too scared to admit it. Although he did not confess his feelings, Rob could see that his brother did instead love Y/n. He knew Jon would never say anything to her, he decided to take matters into his own hands and speak with her himself.\u00a0</p><p>He waits till his brother leaves and makes her way to the healing tent, there he finds Y/n sitting at a table reading a thick book as the injured rest. In quick strides he walks over to the young woman, he clears his throat in order to grab her attention. After a few moments she looks away from the book and looks up at him, her eyes widen in shock as she finds him observing her.</p><p>\u2018Your Grace, my humble apologies. I was in a world of my own\u2019 Y/n speaks up as she stands from her seat and stands before him.<br></p><p>\u2018There is no need to apologise\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018How may I help you your Grace?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Please call me Rob. I have come to speak with you about my brother Jon\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is he well? He has not been fighting again?\u2019 she asked, her heart beating rapidly in her chest.<br></p><p>\u2018Jon is alright, I have heard rumours regarding you and my brother?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Rumours? What rumours?\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n crosses her arms in front of her chest, she cannot believe that people are gossiping about her and she had no idea about it.</p><p>\u2018You have been seen alone and in the company of my brother\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018He is my friend, he has been kind to be and has not taken advantage of me in anyway\u2019 Y/n insists\u00a0\u2018Jon is not the sort, not like some of the men at the camp who try to bed me\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Aye Jon is not like that, I do not believe him. My mother on the other hand believes it, she does not like Jon and believes we should cast him out, as well as you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Why?! I have not doing anything wrong, neither has Jon. It would kill him if he had to leave, he wants to be here with you, helping his brother\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018There is something that my brother is not telling you Y/n, he is too afraid to tell you himself\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018He can tell me anything, he can trust me. We have become close friends, he has nothing to be afraid of\u2019 she feels her walls coming down, feeling less defensive she unfolds her arms\u00a0\u2018What is it? Have I done something wrong to upset him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jon loves you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Love me?\u2019 Y/n is shocked with the change of events, <i>Jon couldn\u2019t possibly love me </i>she thought to herself\u00a0\u2018Jon cannot love me, I am no one. I have nothing to offer him, he is the son of a Lord. I am just a healer\u2019</p><p>Y/n turns her back and moves away from the king, she returns to the table and begins to tidy her books away.</p><p>\u2018You and Jon so alike, he believes he does not deserve you and here you are believing you are not good enough for my brother. Please Y/n, go see my brother talk to him. You cannot deny you feel the same towards him, I have seen you together, I saw how you look at one another\u2019<br></p><p>Holding her books against her chest, once again she turns to look at him and is silent for a moment.</p><p>\u2018I will try\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018That\u2019s all that I ask, my brother has never known love. Although my sisters and my brothers care for him very much, he finds it hard to express himself. Do not hate him if he does not confess his true feelings\u2019<br></p><p>Rob walks away from her and looks upon his injured men, Y/n has no idea what to think or what to do.</p><p>Jon returns to the healing tent later that night, it is time for Y/n to remove the stitches, he cannot wait as it had become more itchy as it began to heal. It was dark and Robs men had began to quieten down for the night, he found Y/n once again tending to the wounded. He decided to sit down on a cot, waiting patiently as she finished up. Y/n wipes her bloody hands on her apron and makes her way over to him, she was growing tired of cleaning blood from her hands.</p><p>\u2018Hello Jon, I just need to wash my hands then we can work on removing your stitches\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n walks towards her large desk, she picks up a large jug and pours in fresh water into a bowl. Jon watches her carefully, he finds himself looking at her curvy figure, the way her long y/c braid rested against her back as it almost reached her hips. Once she finds that the blood has been washed from her skin, Y/n makes her way over to Jon who smiles when she heads his way. Y/n stands close to him as she takes a pair of scissors from the pocket of her apron, she carefully begins to snip away the threads; tugging carefully as she pulled it from his skin.</p><p>\u2018I am sorry if this hurts\u2019 Y/n apologises \u2018I am glad you came here, in fact I needed to speak with you, your brother came to see me today\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018What did he say to you?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Well he told me that people had been gossiping about us\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018Yes I he told me yesterday, I thought he might believe them but he never did. I would never do anything to hurt you Y/n\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I know you wouldn\u2019t Jon, but I need to know what Rob said was true\u2019 she informs him\u00a0\u2018He told me that you loved me\u2019</p><p>Jon looks away unable to look at her in the eyes, for the moment he felt worried that she had known he secret and betrayed that his brother talked to her without him knowing.</p><p>\u2018He told you that?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018He did, is it true? Please Jon I deserve the truth\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018He\u2019s right, I do. I am sorry about what he told you, the last thing you need is to find out that I have feelings for you. I do not deserve you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t say that Jon, not until you hear what I have to say\u2019 Y/n begs him, taking a deep breath she decides to tell him everything\u00a0\u2018I\u2026I love you\u2019<br></p><p>Upon hearing her words he looks up at her, their eyes connecting at once, at first he believes he had imagined it all and he must have fallen and hit his head.</p><p>\u2018Say that again\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I love you Jon\u2019<br></p><p>Without hesitating he stands up from the cot, he places his hands onto her waist and pulls her close. Jon closes the distance between them as he crashes his lips against hers. His actions surprises her and takes her a few moments to realise what was happening, instead of pushing him away as Jon thinks she will; Y/n responds to his kisses and kisses him in return. Jon pulls away for a moment, he cups her face with his rough hands as his thumbs stroke her alabaster skin.</p><p>\u2018Do you mean it? Do you truly love me?\u2019 he needs reassurance that she feels the same, part him doubting that she felt love for him.<br></p><p>\u2018Of course I mean it, I love you\u2019</p><p>Y/n moves away from him and takes his hand into hers, she leads him away from the other patients and further along the tent. At the bottom of the tent Y/n has her own area with a bed which is hidden by a large sheet, to give her privacy.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018Where are we going?\u2019 he asks her, as she continues to pull at his hand.<br></p><p>\u2018Just trust me\u2019<br></p><p>Behind the sheet is a small cot, covered with a green woolen blanket and by her bed were a small pile of books. Jon tries to let go of her hand and back away, but still she takes a firm hold.<br></p><p>\u2018Y/n you don\u2019t have to do this?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Are you worried what will happen if we lay together?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Maybe we should think about this first, shouldn\u2019t we be man and wife before we share the same bed?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Jon what I have learnt healing people and saving people is that our lives are so short, one day we will be here and the next we are not. I do not care what other people think about me, what I do with my body and my heart is my choice; no others\u2019 Y/n declares as she moves her body against his\u00a0\u2018I have grown to love you Jon, you make me happy and distract me from what I have to see everyday in this tent. I wish to spend the rest of my days with you, if you would have me\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Of course I would have you, I would be a fool if I did not but I have nothing to offer you. I have no gold, no lands and no title\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I do not care for trivial things, I want you and only you. Would you take me Jon?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I um\u2026I have\u2026never lain with a woman before\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Never?\u2019<br></p><p>That surprised her, Jon was a handsome man and could have any woman he liked. But she knew that he would be scared putting a baby in a woman\u2019s belly, it did not frighten her and the idea of carrying his child made her happy.</p><p>\u2018No. Have you?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I have not, but I know that I want to be with you. I heard the men, you and Rob will soon be marching against the Lannisters. I am scared that you may never come back\u2019 Y/n confesses at last, she wishes to make as many memories with him before fate may take him away from her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018I will come back to you Y/n I promise\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018You cannot promise me that, you don\u2019t know what is going to happen when you get there\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Nothing will stop me from coming back to you\u2019 Jon tells her firmly before kissing her lips again, he can feel is resolve slowly disappearing and knows it won\u2019t be long until his body betrays him. One of his hands moves to her hip where he pulls her against his body, the other moves to the back of her head as his fingers tangle into her long locks.<br></p><p>The kiss turns passionate as their lips lock together, Y/n\u2019s hands move in front of her and begins to untie his black cloak, slowly the cloak falls from his shoulders and onto the ground.</p><p>\u2018Y/n\u2026\u2019 Jon mumbles as he from her lips.<br></p><p>\u2018I want you Jon, but I won\u2019t stop you if you want to leave right now\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018If we do this it will change everything, I will be your and you will be mine\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018I want to be yours and no others\u2019<br></p><p>Jon\u2019s heart swells in his chest upon hearing her words, immediately his lips crash against hers, her hands grip onto his doublet as she tries not to fall backwards with the force of his kiss. Without breaking the kiss Y/n continues to shed Jon out of his clothing, she unbuckles his sword from his waist as it too falls to the ground with his cloak. Y/n then starts unbuttoning his doublet, as she pulls it down his arms she leaves him only in his pants and tunic. Y/n pulls away, as she stands before him she begins to undo the ribbons of her dress. She then begins to remove her dress, Y/n feels vulnerable as stands naked as the day she was born.</p><p>She tries to cover her breasts as Jon stares at her, his eyes widen as he takes in her form, Y/n is scared that he does not like what he sees. However Jon stops her from covering herself, he never wants her to hide her beautiful body from him.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018You are so beautiful\u2019 he tells her.</p><p>Y/n smiles up at him, taking his hand into her she leads him to her coat, she is the first to lie down on to the coat, lying down on her back. She can\u2019t see the conflict in Jon\u2019s eyes but she doesn\u2019t want him to go just yet.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you want me?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Gods I want you, I am scared that I may put a baby inside of you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Jon there is nothing to worry about, sometimes it takes several times before a woman is with child. My mum helped as a midwife, she knew several noblewomen who had trouble falling with child\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Is that true?\u2019 he asks, feeling unsure.<br></p><p>\u2018Yes my mother has assisted in delivering over forty children, still she helps women when the time comes\u2019<br></p><p>He thinks for a moment, he wants to believe her but also scared that when he leaves her to fight; she may learn she is carrying his child. Jon joins her onto the cot, nestled between her thighs; his body hovers over hers as he rested on his forearms by her head. Y/n strokes his face delicately with her head, she senses that he is nervous as was she. Y/n had kissed a man before but had never gone as far as to show her naked form. She loved Jon and trusted that he would never hurt her but also believed him when he said that he was hers and she was his.</p><p>\u2018Do you want to stop?\u2019 she asks him one final time.<br></p><p>\u2018No\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n helps him remove his tunic over his head, exposing his bare chest, she is surprised that he has such are bare chest, she unable to help herself as she runs her fingers across his chest and then down to his stomach.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018I heard that that it can hurt the first time a woman lays with a man\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I promise to be gentle\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n lays another kisses against his own, they forget about the others on the other side of the sheet as they try to be as quiet as they can. A small groan escapes Jon\u2019s mouth as he finds himself hardening against, his instinct takes over as rocks himself against her core. He had heard stories from both Rob and Theon about the whore house, about laying with women and was worried that he was not skilled as they were. He moves away from her lips and starts kissing her throat before making his way down to her chest. Moving down her body he lays kisses down her body until he moves his face over her core. Y/n has no idea what he was doing and allowed him to continue.</p><p>She jumps as she feels warm breath at her entrance, she did not know men doing such things.</p><p>\u2018Jon what are you doing?\u2019 she quietly asks, but he does not answer and instead he flicks his tongue against her core. The sensation is new to Y/n, she hadn\u2019t felt anything quite like it, she remains laying on her back with her head resting against the pillow.\u00a0<br></p><p>As Jon continues to slowly lick her, something begins to stir inside of her, it was the pleasure she had heard many women spoke of before. They were right, it felt wonderful, gasps had began to leave her lips as Jon continue with his administrations. However her back arches from the cot as he inserts one of his fingers inside of her, little by little he moves inside of her. He feels her tighten around him as her body reacts to the instruction, he tries his hardest not to hurt her but Jon knows that this with make it easier for her later.</p><p>Y/n\u2019s hands move to the back of his head, she scrapes her fingernails against his scalp before holding tightly onto his dark curls.</p><p>\u2018Jon\u2026\u2019 she moans before covering her mouth with her hand.<br></p><p>Something strange is building inside of her that she can no longer control, her breathing is becoming laboured and feels a tingling sensation growing between her legs.</p><p>\u2018Oh\u2026..Jon\u2019<br></p><p>She can\u2019t hold off anything and cries out, Jon feels Y/n pulsating around his finger. As she finally relaxes he removes his finger, he moves up her body and hovers over her once again.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018That\u2026that was\u2026.wonderful\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>Jon cannot help but smirk down her, seeing her out of breath and her cheeks rosy. Her words inflate his ego and cannot help but feel proud that he in fact had pleased her. Y/n finally catches her breath and still finds herself shocked to see him smiling, it was not something he did a lot and was happy he felt comfortable with her.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m ready Jon\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Are you sure?\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018I am, I\u2019m not going to change my mind\u2019 she tells him firmly.</p><p>Jon starts to undo his pants and is not surprised to find himself rock hard, although Y/n cannot believe how big he really is. She is aware that first times aren\u2019t always so easy but the next time in fact is quite pleasurable. At first he rubs himself against her core, the head of his penis nudging against her entrance.</p><p>\u2018I promise to be as gentle as I can\u2019<br></p><p>Y/n says nothing as she prepares for the pain, slowly Jon inserts his penis inside of her channel, Y/n cries out again she covers her mouth with her hand. She does wish for people to hear what she and Jon are doing, it stings as he moves further inside of her.</p><p>\u2018I am sorry\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Keep going Jon\u2019 she tells him, not wanting him to stop\u00a0\u2018I will be fine, please\u2019<br></p><p>He does as she asks and does not stop until he is all the way inside of her, he wants Y/n to adjust to him being inside her. As he look down he notices a small tear fall down from her eye and continue her cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m hurting you\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018It stings only a little, I was told it would hurt but I will be alright. I promise, you can move if you like\u2019<br></p><p>\u2018Alright\u2019<br></p><p>Jon had never felt anything like it before, it was amazing and would happy like to stay buried within her. He moves his hips bit by bit, allowing Y/n to become accustomed to the sensations. Soon the pain had begun to dissipate and again was replaced by pleasure she could not explain. Jon leans down and begins to kiss her lips, Y/n places her hand on the back of his neck as she held him in place. His tongue escapes his mouth and begins to massage his tongue against hers, this had been the most erotic experience the couple had experienced. His hips are soon moving fast against hers, quiet groans are coming from his throat must are silenced when they kiss.</p><p>Soon his body is betraying him and finds himself drawing closer to the edge quicker than he would imagined, but feeling his cock being massaged by her velvet channel was turning him on more than he could imagine.</p><p>His movements become slower as he feels his orgasm coming forward, Jon with a few more thrusts empties himself inside of her before collapsing against her bosoms. His breathing is laboured as he remains sheathed inside of her, Y/n begins stroking her fingers through his curls lulling him to a slumber, not caring that anyone could walk in at that moment but happy he was in the arms of a woman he loved.</p></p>",

Thanks for your request.</p><p><br /></p><p>&lsquo;How long with this take?&rsquo; Jon asks her as the healer in front of him tends to his wounds.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;For as long as it takes&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n was beginning to get fed up with the men in front of her, she only wanted to help people who were injured and in need of help. She had heard of the war between the North and South, Y/n did not care for the reasons they were fighting. Westeros was not her home, she was from Volantis and learned to become a healer just as her mother had done. Her mother was well known and was frequently sort after to heal the wounded, the sick and the dying. She also assisted in many of the births of children in Volantis, Y/n was so proud of her mother and hoped she felt the same about her daughter.</p><p>It had been a big decision to leave her home behind, and her mother but Y/n wanted to see the world. To use what she had learnt to save others, maybe even one day teaching her own children and grandchildren. That was if a man would marry her, Y/n did not have a fortune or anything to offer a man. Y/n had a big heart, which was one of the many reasons she wished to help others but this man was trying her patience and she could feel herself about to snap.</p><p>&lsquo;I have to get back&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Sit still&rsquo; Y/n tells him firmly&nbsp;&lsquo;I have not finished cleaning your wounds, if I do not take care of them they will fester&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;It stings&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Well maybe you should have thought about that before drinking yourself into a stupor and fighting with one of the guards&rsquo; Y/n adds, she had saw the whole drama unfold as she was tending to the wounded. One of the guards, she could not recall his name, called Jon a bastard. It was Jon he threw the first punch which connected with the guards nose, breaking it with a loud crunch.</p><p>Other men decided to join in and even took turns to beat him, by throwing punches on his body or kicking him with their heavy boots. It had taken some time to pry the men away from Jon, Rob the king of the North had heard the commotion and pulled his brother away. The king had asked her to take care of Jon, whilst he sorted out the mess that had been created. Jon had not been pleased to be escorted away and to be taken care of by a woman.</p><p>&lsquo;He called me a bastard&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;So, I am a bastard. I never knew my father&rsquo; she informs him&nbsp;&lsquo;I know what I am and I am not ashamed&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Where is your father?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I do not know, he abandoned my mother when she told him she was with child. He said my mother was a whore, that I was no child of his and cast her out. He married another who had a large dowry and lands, my mother had nothing. It was my mother who raised me, who taught me how to help people and to use herbs to heal&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Your mother, where is she now?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;She is in Volantis, helpings others just as I am. I heard what happened to your father, I am sorry that he died like that&rsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;He bent the knee and they still murdered him, he sought the truth and they killed him for it&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I heard Joffrey was a cruel king&rsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Aye he is&rsquo; Jon adds, he looks up at Y/n and watches as she threads the needle through his skin making him grimace.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I am sorry, I am trying to be as gentle as I can&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;It hurts only a little&rsquo;<br /></p><p>He sits in silence trying to distract himself from the pain, time seems to pass slowly with each stitch. Y/n was concentrating hard as she tried to make this painless as possible, with the last stitch she pulled it tightly ensuring it did not come loss again. Cutting of the excess thread with a knife she felt rather pleased with her work, she was getting better with her sewing. Although she much prefered to work with herbs and making her medicines.</p><p>&lsquo;There we are much better, we need to keep those in for a while and you need to come back so I can check it has not become infected&rsquo;<br /></p><p>He leaves her that night and returns back to his own tent, his brother had sought him out and was angry at him for reacting that way. He informed Jon that many of the lords and his mother Catelyn, had demanded they cast him out. Send him back to Winterfell or even to the wall because of his reckless behaviour. Rob however did not listen to them, Jon was his brother and was still grieving for his father. Ned kept Jon safe, Catelyn had never cared for Jon and although she tried to hide her distaste Rob knew of his mother&rsquo;s actions. Rob had warned his brother not to react to their words, he did not car if they shared a different mother or his fathers infidelity.</p><p>Jon was happy to learn he could stay with Rob and fight by his side, to help bring his sisters back to their mother Catelyn and away from the Lannister&rsquo;s clutches.</p><p>He did as he asked at returned back to Y/n who checked on his wounds, it was healing nicely and had not shown signs of festering. However what he did not expect was to find himself drawn to her, she was a beauty, there was no denying it. Jon needed to be around her, he felt calm and soothed when he was around her. Y/n enjoyed his company, she was happy that he was not like the other men at the camp. They would grab her and try to convince her to come back to their tent, she did want them and tried to find ways to avoid them. She kept herself busy by tending to the wounded along with the other healers and maesters.&nbsp;</p><p>It did not take long for the others to notice that Jon was spending a lot of his time with Y/n, the news had soon reached Catelyn&rsquo;s ears who worried that Jon would follow the footsteps of his father. She did wish for the young healer to become with child with another bastard. Catelyn had spoken with Rob, she wished for Rob to speak with Jon, warning him to stay away from the healing tent.</p><p>Rob decided to see if they were right, he knew his brother, Jon had never been interested in women. Jon believed he had nothing to offer them, but Rob knew that he deserved love and happiness. No matter what his mother told him, she cared not for Jon or what happened to him. So Rob watches from a distance, he follows his brother, ensuring that he is not seen by either Y/n or Jon. He walks behind them as they walk with side by side, talking quietly, he cannot hear what they are discussing. What he sees surprises him, he sees his brother smile, he has only saw this a few times in his life. Jon cares deeply for the woman, he has the same look when he looks at Talisa. He hopes that his brother will follow his heart and not doubt himself, pushing Y/n away.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day Rob attempts to talk to his brother, to understand what was truly going on between his brother and the young woman healer. It was understable that Jon was angered that gossip had spread among the camp, many believing he had bedded Y/n. Jon had heard nothing from Y/n that she had heard such rumours and was frightened what would happen to her if people started to believe them. Rob had asked Jon if he cared for Y/n, if he loved her even, Jon was falling for her and was too scared to admit it. Although he did not confess his feelings, Rob could see that his brother did instead love Y/n. He knew Jon would never say anything to her, he decided to take matters into his own hands and speak with her himself.&nbsp;</p><p>He waits till his brother leaves and makes her way to the healing tent, there he finds Y/n sitting at a table reading a thick book as the injured rest. In quick strides he walks over to the young woman, he clears his throat in order to grab her attention. After a few moments she looks away from the book and looks up at him, her eyes widen in shock as she finds him observing her.</p><p>&lsquo;Your Grace, my humble apologies. I was in a world of my own&rsquo; Y/n speaks up as she stands from her seat and stands before him.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;There is no need to apologise&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;How may I help you your Grace?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Please call me Rob. I have come to speak with you about my brother Jon&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Is he well? He has not been fighting again?&rsquo; she asked, her heart beating rapidly in her chest.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Jon is alright, I have heard rumours regarding you and my brother?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Rumours? What rumours?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n crosses her arms in front of her chest, she cannot believe that people are gossiping about her and she had no idea about it.</p><p>&lsquo;You have been seen alone and in the company of my brother&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;He is my friend, he has been kind to be and has not taken advantage of me in anyway&rsquo; Y/n insists&nbsp;&lsquo;Jon is not the sort, not like some of the men at the camp who try to bed me&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Aye Jon is not like that, I do not believe him. My mother on the other hand believes it, she does not like Jon and believes we should cast him out, as well as you&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Why?! I have not doing anything wrong, neither has Jon. It would kill him if he had to leave, he wants to be here with you, helping his brother&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;There is something that my brother is not telling you Y/n, he is too afraid to tell you himself&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;He can tell me anything, he can trust me. We have become close friends, he has nothing to be afraid of&rsquo; she feels her walls coming down, feeling less defensive she unfolds her arms&nbsp;&lsquo;What is it? Have I done something wrong to upset him?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Jon loves you&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Love me?&rsquo; Y/n is shocked with the change of events, <i>Jon couldn&rsquo;t possibly love me </i>she thought to herself&nbsp;&lsquo;Jon cannot love me, I am no one. I have nothing to offer him, he is the son of a Lord. I am just a healer&rsquo;</p><p>Y/n turns her back and moves away from the king, she returns to the table and begins to tidy her books away.</p><p>&lsquo;You and Jon so alike, he believes he does not deserve you and here you are believing you are not good enough for my brother. Please Y/n, go see my brother talk to him. You cannot deny you feel the same towards him, I have seen you together, I saw how you look at one another&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Holding her books against her chest, once again she turns to look at him and is silent for a moment.</p><p>&lsquo;I will try&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all that I ask, my brother has never known love. Although my sisters and my brothers care for him very much, he finds it hard to express himself. Do not hate him if he does not confess his true feelings&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Rob walks away from her and looks upon his injured men, Y/n has no idea what to think or what to do.</p><p>Jon returns to the healing tent later that night, it is time for Y/n to remove the stitches, he cannot wait as it had become more itchy as it began to heal. It was dark and Robs men had began to quieten down for the night, he found Y/n once again tending to the wounded. He decided to sit down on a cot, waiting patiently as she finished up. Y/n wipes her bloody hands on her apron and makes her way over to him, she was growing tired of cleaning blood from her hands.</p><p>&lsquo;Hello Jon, I just need to wash my hands then we can work on removing your stitches&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n walks towards her large desk, she picks up a large jug and pours in fresh water into a bowl. Jon watches her carefully, he finds himself looking at her curvy figure, the way her long y/c braid rested against her back as it almost reached her hips. Once she finds that the blood has been washed from her skin, Y/n makes her way over to Jon who smiles when she heads his way. Y/n stands close to him as she takes a pair of scissors from the pocket of her apron, she carefully begins to snip away the threads; tugging carefully as she pulled it from his skin.</p><p>&lsquo;I am sorry if this hurts&rsquo; Y/n apologises &lsquo;I am glad you came here, in fact I needed to speak with you, your brother came to see me today&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;What did he say to you?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Well he told me that people had been gossiping about us&rsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Yes I he told me yesterday, I thought he might believe them but he never did. I would never do anything to hurt you Y/n&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I know you wouldn&rsquo;t Jon, but I need to know what Rob said was true&rsquo; she informs him&nbsp;&lsquo;He told me that you loved me&rsquo;</p><p>Jon looks away unable to look at her in the eyes, for the moment he felt worried that she had known he secret and betrayed that his brother talked to her without him knowing.</p><p>&lsquo;He told you that?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;He did, is it true? Please Jon I deserve the truth&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s right, I do. I am sorry about what he told you, the last thing you need is to find out that I have feelings for you. I do not deserve you&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that Jon, not until you hear what I have to say&rsquo; Y/n begs him, taking a deep breath she decides to tell him everything&nbsp;&lsquo;I&hellip;I love you&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Upon hearing her words he looks up at her, their eyes connecting at once, at first he believes he had imagined it all and he must have fallen and hit his head.</p><p>&lsquo;Say that again&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I love you Jon&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Without hesitating he stands up from the cot, he places his hands onto her waist and pulls her close. Jon closes the distance between them as he crashes his lips against hers. His actions surprises her and takes her a few moments to realise what was happening, instead of pushing him away as Jon thinks she will; Y/n responds to his kisses and kisses him in return. Jon pulls away for a moment, he cups her face with his rough hands as his thumbs stroke her alabaster skin.</p><p>&lsquo;Do you mean it? Do you truly love me?&rsquo; he needs reassurance that she feels the same, part him doubting that she felt love for him.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Of course I mean it, I love you&rsquo;</p><p>Y/n moves away from him and takes his hand into hers, she leads him away from the other patients and further along the tent. At the bottom of the tent Y/n has her own area with a bed which is hidden by a large sheet, to give her privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;Where are we going?&rsquo; he asks her, as she continues to pull at his hand.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Just trust me&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Behind the sheet is a small cot, covered with a green woolen blanket and by her bed were a small pile of books. Jon tries to let go of her hand and back away, but still she takes a firm hold.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Y/n you don&rsquo;t have to do this?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Are you worried what will happen if we lay together?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Maybe we should think about this first, shouldn&rsquo;t we be man and wife before we share the same bed?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Jon what I have learnt healing people and saving people is that our lives are so short, one day we will be here and the next we are not. I do not care what other people think about me, what I do with my body and my heart is my choice; no others&rsquo; Y/n declares as she moves her body against his&nbsp;&lsquo;I have grown to love you Jon, you make me happy and distract me from what I have to see everyday in this tent. I wish to spend the rest of my days with you, if you would have me&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Of course I would have you, I would be a fool if I did not but I have nothing to offer you. I have no gold, no lands and no title&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I do not care for trivial things, I want you and only you. Would you take me Jon?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I um&hellip;I have&hellip;never lain with a woman before&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Never?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>That surprised her, Jon was a handsome man and could have any woman he liked. But she knew that he would be scared putting a baby in a woman&rsquo;s belly, it did not frighten her and the idea of carrying his child made her happy.</p><p>&lsquo;No. Have you?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I have not, but I know that I want to be with you. I heard the men, you and Rob will soon be marching against the Lannisters. I am scared that you may never come back&rsquo; Y/n confesses at last, she wishes to make as many memories with him before fate may take him away from her.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I will come back to you Y/n I promise&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;You cannot promise me that, you don&rsquo;t know what is going to happen when you get there&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Nothing will stop me from coming back to you&rsquo; Jon tells her firmly before kissing her lips again, he can feel is resolve slowly disappearing and knows it won&rsquo;t be long until his body betrays him. One of his hands moves to her hip where he pulls her against his body, the other moves to the back of her head as his fingers tangle into her long locks.<br /></p><p>The kiss turns passionate as their lips lock together, Y/n&rsquo;s hands move in front of her and begins to untie his black cloak, slowly the cloak falls from his shoulders and onto the ground.</p><p>&lsquo;Y/n&hellip;&rsquo; Jon mumbles as he from her lips.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I want you Jon, but I won&rsquo;t stop you if you want to leave right now&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;If we do this it will change everything, I will be your and you will be mine&rsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I want to be yours and no others&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Jon&rsquo;s heart swells in his chest upon hearing her words, immediately his lips crash against hers, her hands grip onto his doublet as she tries not to fall backwards with the force of his kiss. Without breaking the kiss Y/n continues to shed Jon out of his clothing, she unbuckles his sword from his waist as it too falls to the ground with his cloak. Y/n then starts unbuttoning his doublet, as she pulls it down his arms she leaves him only in his pants and tunic. Y/n pulls away, as she stands before him she begins to undo the ribbons of her dress. She then begins to remove her dress, Y/n feels vulnerable as stands naked as the day she was born.</p><p>She tries to cover her breasts as Jon stares at her, his eyes widen as he takes in her form, Y/n is scared that he does not like what he sees. However Jon stops her from covering herself, he never wants her to hide her beautiful body from him.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;You are so beautiful&rsquo; he tells her.</p><p>Y/n smiles up at him, taking his hand into her she leads him to her coat, she is the first to lie down on to the coat, lying down on her back. She can&rsquo;t see the conflict in Jon&rsquo;s eyes but she doesn&rsquo;t want him to go just yet.</p><p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you want me?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Gods I want you, I am scared that I may put a baby inside of you&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Jon there is nothing to worry about, sometimes it takes several times before a woman is with child. My mum helped as a midwife, she knew several noblewomen who had trouble falling with child&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Is that true?&rsquo; he asks, feeling unsure.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Yes my mother has assisted in delivering over forty children, still she helps women when the time comes&rsquo;<br /></p><p>He thinks for a moment, he wants to believe her but also scared that when he leaves her to fight; she may learn she is carrying his child. Jon joins her onto the cot, nestled between her thighs; his body hovers over hers as he rested on his forearms by her head. Y/n strokes his face delicately with her head, she senses that he is nervous as was she. Y/n had kissed a man before but had never gone as far as to show her naked form. She loved Jon and trusted that he would never hurt her but also believed him when he said that he was hers and she was his.</p><p>&lsquo;Do you want to stop?&rsquo; she asks him one final time.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;No&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n helps him remove his tunic over his head, exposing his bare chest, she is surprised that he has such are bare chest, she unable to help herself as she runs her fingers across his chest and then down to his stomach.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;I heard that that it can hurt the first time a woman lays with a man&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I promise to be gentle&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n lays another kisses against his own, they forget about the others on the other side of the sheet as they try to be as quiet as they can. A small groan escapes Jon&rsquo;s mouth as he finds himself hardening against, his instinct takes over as rocks himself against her core. He had heard stories from both Rob and Theon about the whore house, about laying with women and was worried that he was not skilled as they were. He moves away from her lips and starts kissing her throat before making his way down to her chest. Moving down her body he lays kisses down her body until he moves his face over her core. Y/n has no idea what he was doing and allowed him to continue.</p><p>She jumps as she feels warm breath at her entrance, she did not know men doing such things.</p><p>&lsquo;Jon what are you doing?&rsquo; she quietly asks, but he does not answer and instead he flicks his tongue against her core. The sensation is new to Y/n, she hadn&rsquo;t felt anything quite like it, she remains laying on her back with her head resting against the pillow.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>As Jon continues to slowly lick her, something begins to stir inside of her, it was the pleasure she had heard many women spoke of before. They were right, it felt wonderful, gasps had began to leave her lips as Jon continue with his administrations. However her back arches from the cot as he inserts one of his fingers inside of her, little by little he moves inside of her. He feels her tighten around him as her body reacts to the instruction, he tries his hardest not to hurt her but Jon knows that this with make it easier for her later.</p><p>Y/n&rsquo;s hands move to the back of his head, she scrapes her fingernails against his scalp before holding tightly onto his dark curls.</p><p>&lsquo;Jon&hellip;&rsquo; she moans before covering her mouth with her hand.<br /></p><p>Something strange is building inside of her that she can no longer control, her breathing is becoming laboured and feels a tingling sensation growing between her legs.</p><p>&lsquo;Oh&hellip;..Jon&rsquo;<br /></p><p>She can&rsquo;t hold off anything and cries out, Jon feels Y/n pulsating around his finger. As she finally relaxes he removes his finger, he moves up her body and hovers over her once again.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;That&hellip;that was&hellip;.wonderful&rsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Jon cannot help but smirk down her, seeing her out of breath and her cheeks rosy. Her words inflate his ego and cannot help but feel proud that he in fact had pleased her. Y/n finally catches her breath and still finds herself shocked to see him smiling, it was not something he did a lot and was happy he felt comfortable with her.</p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m ready Jon&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Are you sure?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I am, I&rsquo;m not going to change my mind&rsquo; she tells him firmly.</p><p>Jon starts to undo his pants and is not surprised to find himself rock hard, although Y/n cannot believe how big he really is. She is aware that first times aren&rsquo;t always so easy but the next time in fact is quite pleasurable. At first he rubs himself against her core, the head of his penis nudging against her entrance.</p><p>&lsquo;I promise to be as gentle as I can&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n says nothing as she prepares for the pain, slowly Jon inserts his penis inside of her channel, Y/n cries out again she covers her mouth with her hand. She does wish for people to hear what she and Jon are doing, it stings as he moves further inside of her.</p><p>&lsquo;I am sorry&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Keep going Jon&rsquo; she tells him, not wanting him to stop&nbsp;&lsquo;I will be fine, please&rsquo;<br /></p><p>He does as she asks and does not stop until he is all the way inside of her, he wants Y/n to adjust to him being inside her. As he look down he notices a small tear fall down from her eye and continue her cheek.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m hurting you&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;It stings only a little, I was told it would hurt but I will be alright. I promise, you can move if you like&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Alright&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Jon had never felt anything like it before, it was amazing and would happy like to stay buried within her. He moves his hips bit by bit, allowing Y/n to become accustomed to the sensations. Soon the pain had begun to dissipate and again was replaced by pleasure she could not explain. Jon leans down and begins to kiss her lips, Y/n places her hand on the back of his neck as she held him in place. His tongue escapes his mouth and begins to massage his tongue against hers, this had been the most erotic experience the couple had experienced. His hips are soon moving fast against hers, quiet groans are coming from his throat must are silenced when they kiss.</p><p>Soon his body is betraying him and finds himself drawing closer to the edge quicker than he would imagined, but feeling his cock being massaged by her velvet channel was turning him on more than he could imagine.</p><p>His movements become slower as he feels his orgasm coming forward, Jon with a few more thrusts empties himself inside of her before collapsing against her bosoms. His breathing is laboured as he remains sheathed inside of her, Y/n begins stroking her fingers through his curls lulling him to a slumber, not caring that anyone could walk in at that moment but happy he was in the arms of a woman he loved.</p></p>",

He can be unnamed.</b></p><p>Sansa: <b>Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along.</b> She always loved Jon far more than she ever\nloved me, and she&rsquo;d kill anyone who betrayed her family.</p></blockquote><p>It is literally show canon that Sansa actually entertained the notion of deposing Jon - even if she finally came to her senses, realized LF was playing her and took him down with Arya and Bran. <br /></p><p>You know who are the characters to whom Jon has actually listened to and taken advice from? Samwell Tarly, Aemon Targaryen, Davos seaworth. These are people who genuinely want Jon to do well and succeed in his endeavors and have his best interests at heart. <br /></p><p>Currently Jon&rsquo;s most trusted counsellor and right hand man on the show is Davos. In the books, since he send away Sam and Aemon and has isolated himself, he does not have a good adviser - could be one reason he got assassinated. <br /></p><p>But it really is mind boggling that a certain section of the fans use the season 6/7 Jon/Sansa interactions to connect to GRRM&rsquo;s history books and make parallels to Jahaerys and Alysanne.&nbsp; People do realize that Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s stories are going to be entirely different in the books right? Stannis is set to defeat the Boltons, Jon will likely become KITN and Lord of WF through Robb&rsquo;s will , Rickon is still alive and Sansa still has a lot of plot to cover in the Vale. <br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s also funny that there are all these parallels between what Sansa will do in the future - like these people can actually see into the future and know what GRRM has written for Sansa! - and what Alysanne has done some 300 years ago in the series. <br /></p><p>So, just because Sansa thinks to herself that she will be a good queen, that&rsquo;s exactly what she will be according to these people. Never mind that GRRM has scoffed at exactly this notion and spend an entire book on how ruling is really hard and it&rsquo;s not just enough to have good intentions. <br /></p><blockquote><p><b>Ruling is hard.</b> This was maybe my answer to Tolkien, whom, as much as I admire him, I do quibble with. Lord of the Rings\n had a very medieval philosophy: that if the king was a good man, the \nland would prosper. We look at real history and it&rsquo;s not that simple. \nTolkien can say that Aragorn became king and reigned for a hundred \nyears, and he was wise and good. But Tolkien doesn&rsquo;t ask the question: \nWhat was Aragorn&rsquo;s tax policy? Did he maintain a standing army? What did\n he do in times of flood and famine? And what about all these orcs? By \nthe end of the war, Sauron is gone but all of the orcs aren&rsquo;t gone &ndash; \nthey&rsquo;re in the mountains. Did Aragorn pursue a policy of systematic \ngenocide and kill them? Even the little baby orcs, in their little orc \ncradles?</p><p><b>In real life, real-life kings had real-life problems to deal with. \nJust being a good guy was not the answer. You had to make hard, hard \ndecisions. Sometimes what seemed to be a good decision turned around and\n bit you in the ass; it was the law of unintended consequences. I&rsquo;ve \ntried to get at some of these in my books. My people who are trying to \nrule don&rsquo;t have an easy time of it. Just having good intentions doesn&rsquo;t \nmake you a wise king.</b></p></blockquote><p>When Sansa has done what Jon and Dany have accomplished in ADwD, and actually ruled and made life or death decisions in the books then we can make the Sansa/Alysanne comparisons. Till then it&rsquo;s just a bunch of fans really reaching and stretching to make Jonsa happen using nonsensical Jon/Jahaerys and Sansa/Alysanne comparisons. <br /></p><p>Remember that GRRM is writing the books. Not the show. <br /></p>",

At fourteen he thought himself too old for\nchildren\u2019s play, but when he saw that even his uncles Eddard, Rickon and Benjen\nmade ready to participate, he came along.

I think I might have an idea\nwhy you used my name to let the family gather.\u201d Jon looked at his hands.</p><p>\u201cDid you\nnot manage to persuade Arya to come? Sansa would have liked to have her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried.\nYou know how she is.

It is just\u2026. You do know, how and when we all die, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nsee beyond my own death.

I remember when\nyou pulled my sledge, when you were still Jon Snow, not Jaehaerys Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled,\nlost in memory for a little while.</p><p>\u201cBut there\nis still some magic here, isn\u2019t it, here in Winterfell, at the weirwood.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou should\nknow that better than most.\u201d</p><p>There was a\nstrange silence before Jon spoke again.</p><p>\u201cI wondered\nabout that. You know, my hair is as black as it was in my youth, my skin is\nbarely wrinkled, my step is still light. Sansa complains about the little\nburdens of age. She is a bit short-winded, she tires easily, her eyesight is no\nwhat it was, yet I don\u2019t feel any of this. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\nyou can answer that question yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was\ndead. Really dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\nwere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, a part\nof magic is alive in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when I\ndie, will all the magic be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\nAt the moment, there is still some out here. Enough for me to have visions,\noccasionally that is. The biggest part there is, is contained in you. If you\nrelease it, let it go, it will be loose. It is difficult to see what happens. My\nsight does not carry me neither beyond the death of magic nor beyond my own\ndeath only in glimpses. And the death of all magic is a possibility.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut when I\nlet lose, as you call it, there will be a sudden burst of magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it be\nenough to tip the scales? Enough to enable ice and fire magic again? Enough\nthat dragons can be hatched or that White Walkers come again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really\nget to the heart of the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as\nI live, the scales will be in balance?\u201d</p><p>Rickon nodded,\nhis eyes burning.</p><p>\u201cHow long\nwill I live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see some\nof the things the future Ravens tell me. It is all very blurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCenturies?\u201d</p><p><i>Why has this burden fallen upon me?</i> Again Rickon nodded silently.</p><p>\u201cI would\noutlive Sansa, you, our children, the grandchildren. But the sight would stay,\nthere would be Lord Raven to look out for our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Or a\nLady Raven. The next one will be a Lady, depending on the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if I\ndo not die, you and others will have the sight at least for a while. And the\nprobability that Walkers or Dragons come again would be less?\u201d </p><p>Rickon\nbarked a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I cannot see, what happens if magic vanishes, I\ncannot see what happens beyond my own death, apart from the fact, that I will\nchoose a successor. We don\u2019t know enough about the magic of the Children of the\nForest to be entirely sure. But as far as I can figure it out, you are right.\nIf you let go of the magic, there is a chance, that the scales are tipped.\u201d</p><p>Jon was\nsilent for a long time.</p><p>\u201cSo, the\nLord Raven cannot give me any counsel, but to stay alive as long as I can.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked\nup and searched for an answer in Rickon\u2019s face. Rickon held back his tears.</p><p>\u201cSo, if I\ndie, I would leave you to possibly fight with Walkers and dragons, and if I\ndon\u2019t I\u2019ll live on and on until I would be Jaehaerys the even older, or the oldest.\u201d\n</p><p>Rickon laughed\ndespite himself.</p><p>\u201cI would\nhave to leave. I cannot possibly live here without Sansa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\nwould grow mad.\u201d Rickon whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy did\nyou not tell me sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\nwould only have given you grief, but now the time of a choice is upon you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa. She\nhas not been well. How much time do we have left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpring.\u201d</p><p>They stood\nin silence for a long time.</p><p>Finally, Jon\npatted him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThis Raven\nbusiness really must be annoying to you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of\nthe time, it gives the satisfaction of being able to feel superior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, it\nis only fair, given that you know your own death.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>Rickon\nwished he could stop time. A week flew by, Prince Brandon lost some of the\nseriousness that had come when he stopped being a child. He played with his\nsiblings as if he had never forgotten how to do it. Alaric was glad that he\nsomehow had gotten his older brother back and little Sam followed his brothers\neverywhere and they seemed to suffer it with patience. Sometimes they led Sam\nto his grandmother and Sansa told him stories. Eddard\u2019s girls were glad for the\nbreaks. Although they must know Sansa\u2019s stories by heart, they always listened\nin as well. </p><p>When Rickon\nhappened to sit close by, he closed his eyes. His mother\u2019s voice had not\nchanged much. With his eyes closed he could picture himself at her knees as a\nchild, listening to her stories, his twin Eddard close by, at a time when their\nyounger half-siblings had not yet been born. He wished his stepfather would\njoin them more often, but he could not blame him for avoiding him.</p><p>He did not\nexpect his mother to approach him as well. One morning she knocked at his door\nand determinedly took him to the weirwood. He had not foreseen that and\nwondered if he had done something to nudge the future in another direction. Had\nhe said too much to his stepfather?</p><p>When they\nreached the weirwood, Rickon tried every trick that Uncle Bran had told him. He\nstudied the red leaves of the weirwood, he looked at the light of dawn\ntransforming the snow into glittering crystals, he let himself smell the black\nearth beneath the weirwood. It was no use. His mother\u2019s first question\nshattered his guard.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\nsee Arya again, will I?\u201d</p><p>Rickon\nshook his head, his eyes suddenly and shockingly filling with tears. </p><p>\u201cNor will\nany of us. Neither Gendry nor she will return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she\ndied already?\u201d Sansa\u2019s voice was hoarse, and she cleared her throat. \u201cOr do you\nnot know?\u201d</p><p>Rickon drew\na deep breath. \u201cTo be precise, she returns in no possible future I can see. I\nmust assume that Gendry and her die in Essos.\u201d</p><p>His mother\nhung her head. </p><p>\u201cShe did\nnot take your letter seriously then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow did\nyou know, I wrote a letter?\u201d Rickon asked astonished.</p><p>She laughed\nabruptly and shortly.</p><p>\u201cMy dear\nson, all my children and grandchildren are here for my nameday? How stupid do\nyou think I am? I am not the stupid girl I was!\u201d</p><p>Rickon\nsmiled through his tears.</p><p>\u201cNow, my\ndear mother, say it! You were a stupid girl with stupid dreams who never\nlearned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlys tells\nthat to her daughters all the time. I don\u2019t know how I feel about that,\u201d his\nmother admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t\ndo them any harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose\nthere is also little chance I see Brienne one more time?\u201d</p><p>Rickon\nshrugged. This was such a dangerous conversation. He tried to get a grip on his\nfeelings.</p><p>His mother\nstudied his face and then she sighed.</p><p>\u201cThere is\nno use to beat about the bush, Rickon. I feel tired all the time, I\u2019m\nshort-winded, I wake up in the night and my heart beats as if I have run for\nages. I am old, and I will be gone soon.\u201d</p><p>She touched\nhis cheek tenderly and wiped one of his tears away, just with the tip of her\nfinger.</p><p>\u201cThank you\nfor bringing everyone here. It means almost everything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all\nlove you.\u201d</p><p>His mother\nlaughed again. \u201cQueen Darra seems to be a bit in awe of me.\u201d</p><p>Rickon\nsmiled. \u201cYou are the queen of love and beauty. Everyone knows that. And she is\njust the Queen of the seven kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I\nnever was.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWill they\nsort out their differences? Will they heal? Torrhen and her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery\nlikely.\u201d</p><p>His mother\nsighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about\nyou, Rickon? Will there be someone to share your burden, will there be love for\nyou, too?\u201d</p><p>She had\ntaken him unawares yet again. </p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d\nUnbidden he saw a glimpse, like he had seen occasionally. Dark ebony skin, a\nready deep laugh, the bright clothes of a summer islander. He closed his eyes. <i>Concentrate on something else.</i> He looked\nat his mother\u2019s hair. White as the snow surrounding them it was, but it was\nstill full, gleaming in the light of the rising sun.</p><p>\u201cDarkness.\u201d\nHis mother said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarkness\nand a void. That is what awaits us, Jon said. You know. I always told him, that\nhe does not truly know. He might have forgotten what was beyond. He might have\nnot yet been at the place we are meant to go. If there was only darkness and a\nvoid, how did his soul come back?\u201d</p><p>Rickon had\nno answer and just took mother\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI do not\nworry about me. I worry about Jon. He tries to hide it from me. He complains\nabout his bones hurting, that he lost his vigour. It\u2019s all a sham. He even\nlooks barely older than forty. He even tried to rub ashes in his hair, so I\nwould think he was turning grey.\u201d She scoffed.</p><p>Rickon\ncould not help himself, he had to laugh at that. </p><p>\u201cSeriously,\ncan you tell me, what will happen?\u201d She looked at him pleadingly.</p><p>Rickon\nshook his head. \u201cAll I can tell you, is that it is not destiny. He can choose.\nLike you could choose all your life. The future has many, many crossroads. That\nis why it is so difficult to find a way.\u201d</p><p>They were\nsilent after that. His mother pressed his hands. </p><p>That was\nhow Prince Brandon found them.</p><p>\u201cUncle\nRickon, Grandma, there is a group of men approaching. They show the quartered\nLion of Lannister and the sun and moon of Tarth\u201d. His voice was so excited that\nit sounded as high-pitched as that of his younger brother Alaric. Prince\nBrandon adored Lord Gerran Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Tarth.</p><p>Rickon<i> </i>felt at loss. Like the talk with his\nmother he had not seen this. <i>What kind of</i>\n<i>piece is set on the board now? </i>He was\ntempted to stay behind and delve into visions at the weirwood, here where magic\nwas still strongest, but he also knew that it would be dangerous to have\nanother look at the future now, when everything was shifting. So, he went along\nwhen his mother took his arm and leaned on him on her way to the hall. Rickon\nsmiled at her and tried just to live in the moment.</p>",

Dark ebony skin, a\nready deep laugh, the bright clothes of a summer islander. He closed his eyes. <i>Concentrate on something else.</i> He looked\nat his mother\u2019s hair.

That is what awaits us, Jon said. You know. I always told him, that\nhe does not truly know. He might have forgotten what was beyond. He might have\nnot yet been at the place we are meant to go. If there was only darkness and a\nvoid, how did his soul come back?\u201d</p><p>Rickon had\nno answer and just took mother\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI do not\nworry about me. I worry about Jon. He tries to hide it from me. He complains\nabout his bones hurting, that he lost his vigour. It\u2019s all a sham. He even\nlooks barely older than forty. He even tried to rub ashes in his hair, so I\nwould think he was turning grey.\u201d She scoffed.</p><p>Rickon\ncould not help himself, he had to laugh at that. </p><p>\u201cSeriously,\ncan you tell me, what will happen?\u201d She looked at him pleadingly.</p><p>Rickon\nshook his head. \u201cAll I can tell you, is that it is not destiny. He can choose.\nLike you could choose all your life. The future has many, many crossroads. That\nis why it is so difficult to find a way.\u201d</p><p>They were\nsilent after that. His mother pressed his hands. </p><p>That was\nhow Prince Brandon found them.</p><p>\u201cUncle\nRickon, Grandma, there is a group of men approaching. They show the quartered\nLion of Lannister and the sun and moon of Tarth\u201d. His voice was so excited that\nit sounded as high-pitched as that of his younger brother Alaric. Prince\nBrandon adored Lord Gerran Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Tarth.</p><p>Rickon<i> </i>felt at loss. Like the talk with his\nmother he had not seen this. <i>What kind of</i>\n<i>piece is set on the board now? </i>He was\ntempted to stay behind and delve into visions at the weirwood, here where magic\nwas still strongest, but he also knew that it would be dangerous to have\nanother look at the future now, when everything was shifting. So, he went along\nwhen his mother took his arm and leaned on him on her way to the hall. Rickon\nsmiled at her and tried just to live in the moment.</p>",

The Lord Hand\ncomplimented Lady Sansa, the princes eyed Eddard\u2019s girls curiously, and Alys\nimmediately took Queen Darra by the hand. Lord Jon arrived shortly before\nEddard led them all into the hall. He still looked like Rickon remembered him,\nblack curls bound back in a bun, his stride confident and he was greeted with\njoy.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Torrhen\u2019s\nchildren then beset to their grandmother and she promised them to go sleighing\nin the afternoon. Rickon thought he managed to comport himself well. He smiled,\nlaughed and was startled only once when he got a glimpse of the maid who would be\nthe one to tell him about finding his mother gone. </p><p>In the\nafternoon Lady Sansa made good on her promise. Queen Darra had to persuade\nBrandon, her eldest, to join them. At fourteen he thought himself too old for\nchildren\u2019s play, but when he saw that even his uncles Eddard, Rickon and Benjen\nmade ready to participate, he came along. Rickon and his siblings fell into an\neasy banter, they fought on who could take the sledges, rolled around in the\nsnow, showered each other with snowballs and Brandon soon gave up on trying to\nstand aloof. Little Sam was busy running after either his older siblings, his\nuncles or Eddard\u2019s girls and by the end of the day they all were breathless.\nThere was no part of the hill where the snow was untouched. Lord Jon had pulled\nthe sledges tirelessly for his grandchildren, but Lady Sansa had excused\nherself after a while and had taken a seat next to Darra, catching her breath.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Rickon\nstood up the next morning before dawn and went to the godswood, where he knew\nhe was needed. Apparently, fresh snow had fallen over night that now covered\nthe thin harsh crust that had formed after yesterday\u2019s slight thaw. The snow\nhad taken strange shapes on the ground. It looked like a tiny landscape with\nbizarre white trees. The red leaves of the weirwood tree made a stark contrast\nto the wintery background and steam seemed to ascend from the earth.</p><p>Lord Jon\nstood at the tree already, his hand touched the stem.</p><p>\u201cDid you\nknow I need to talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Rickon just\nnodded, stepped beside his stepfather and raised his hand to the tree as well.</p><p>\u201cI was a\nbit surprised that supposedly I invited everybody to Winterfell, but I think I\nmanaged to cover up before your mother noticed. I think I might have an idea\nwhy you used my name to let the family gather.\u201d Jon looked at his hands.</p><p>\u201cDid you\nnot manage to persuade Arya to come? Sansa would have liked to have her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried.\nYou know how she is. She persuaded Gendry to sail to Braavos \u2018one more time\u2019 as\nshe called it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWill it be\nthe last time?\u201d </p><p>Rickon fell\nsilent awkwardly. How could he forget that Jon had dealt with Uncle Bran and\nthat he was so very observant. <i>I should\nhave worded that differently.</i></p><p>\u201cYou know,\nI dare not answer that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am\nsorry, Rickon. It is just\u2026. You do know, how and when we all die, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nsee beyond my own death. That is for the next Lord Raven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there\nbe a next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\ndepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe paid\nthe price, Uncle Jon, you know that. The White Walkers are gone, the Dragons\nare gone. Magic dwindles slowly, but it dwindles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhaven\u2019t called me Uncle Jon in such a long time.\u201d</p><p>Rickon felt\nhis heart give a pang. \u201cMust be the feeling of being at home. I remember when\nyou pulled my sledge, when you were still Jon Snow, not Jaehaerys Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled,\nlost in memory for a little while.</p><p>\u201cBut there\nis still some magic here, isn\u2019t it, here in Winterfell, at the weirwood.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou should\nknow that better than most.\u201d</p><p>There was a\nstrange silence before Jon spoke again.</p><p>\u201cI wondered\nabout that. You know, my hair is as black as it was in my youth, my skin is\nbarely wrinkled, my step is still light. Sansa complains about the little\nburdens of age. She is a bit short-winded, she tires easily, her eyesight is no\nwhat it was, yet I don\u2019t feel any of this. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\nyou can answer that question yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was\ndead. Really dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\nwere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, a part\nof magic is alive in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when I\ndie, will all the magic be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\nAt the moment, there is still some out here. Enough for me to have visions,\noccasionally that is. The biggest part there is, is contained in you. If you\nrelease it, let it go, it will be loose. It is difficult to see what happens. My\nsight does not carry me neither beyond the death of magic nor beyond my own\ndeath only in glimpses. And the death of all magic is a possibility.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut when I\nlet lose, as you call it, there will be a sudden burst of magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it be\nenough to tip the scales? Enough to enable ice and fire magic again? Enough\nthat dragons can be hatched or that White Walkers come again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really\nget to the heart of the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as\nI live, the scales will be in balance?\u201d</p><p>Rickon nodded,\nhis eyes burning.</p><p>\u201cHow long\nwill I live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see some\nof the things the future Ravens tell me. It is all very blurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCenturies?\u201d</p><p><i>Why has this burden fallen upon me?</i> Again Rickon nodded silently.</p><p>\u201cI would\noutlive Sansa, you, our children, the grandchildren. But the sight would stay,\nthere would be Lord Raven to look out for our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Or a\nLady Raven. The next one will be a Lady, depending on the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if I\ndo not die, you and others will have the sight at least for a while. And the\nprobability that Walkers or Dragons come again would be less?\u201d </p><p>Rickon\nbarked a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I cannot see, what happens if magic vanishes, I\ncannot see what happens beyond my own death, apart from the fact, that I will\nchoose a successor. We don\u2019t know enough about the magic of the Children of the\nForest to be entirely sure. But as far as I can figure it out, you are right.\nIf you let go of the magic, there is a chance, that the scales are tipped.\u201d</p><p>Jon was\nsilent for a long time.</p><p>\u201cSo, the\nLord Raven cannot give me any counsel, but to stay alive as long as I can.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked\nup and searched for an answer in Rickon\u2019s face. Rickon held back his tears.</p><p>\u201cSo, if I\ndie, I would leave you to possibly fight with Walkers and dragons, and if I\ndon\u2019t I\u2019ll live on and on until I would be Jaehaerys the even older, or the oldest.\u201d\n</p><p>Rickon laughed\ndespite himself.</p><p>\u201cI would\nhave to leave. I cannot possibly live here without Sansa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\nwould grow mad.\u201d Rickon whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy did\nyou not tell me sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\nwould only have given you grief, but now the time of a choice is upon you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa. She\nhas not been well. How much time do we have left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpring.\u201d</p><p>They stood\nin silence for a long time.</p><p>Finally, Jon\npatted him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThis Raven\nbusiness really must be annoying to you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of\nthe time, it gives the satisfaction of being able to feel superior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, it\nis only fair, given that you know your own death.\u201d</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Rickon\nwished he could stop time. A week flew by, Prince Brandon lost some of the\nseriousness that had come when he stopped being a child. He played with his\nsiblings as if he had never forgotten how to do it. Alaric was glad that he\nsomehow had gotten his older brother back and little Sam followed his brothers\neverywhere and they seemed to suffer it with patience. Sometimes they led Sam\nto his grandmother and Sansa told him stories. Eddard\u2019s girls were glad for the\nbreaks. Although they must know Sansa\u2019s stories by heart, they always listened\nin as well. </p><p>When Rickon\nhappened to sit close by, he closed his eyes. His mother\u2019s voice had not\nchanged much. With his eyes closed he could picture himself at her knees as a\nchild, listening to her stories, his twin Eddard close by, at a time when their\nyounger half-siblings had not yet been born. He wished his stepfather would\njoin them more often, but he could not blame him for avoiding him.</p><p>He did not\nexpect his mother to approach him as well. One morning she knocked at his door\nand determinedly took him to the weirwood. He had not foreseen that and\nwondered if he had done something to nudge the future in another direction. Had\nhe said too much to his stepfather?</p><p>When they\nreached the weirwood, Rickon tried every trick that Uncle Bran had told him. He\nstudied the red leaves of the weirwood, he looked at the light of dawn\ntransforming the snow into glittering crystals, he let himself smell the black\nearth beneath the weirwood. It was no use. His mother\u2019s first question\nshattered his guard.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\nsee Arya again, will I?\u201d</p><p>Rickon\nshook his head, his eyes suddenly and shockingly filling with tears. </p><p>\u201cNor will\nany of us. Neither Gendry nor she will return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she\ndied already?\u201d Sansa\u2019s voice was hoarse, and she cleared her throat. \u201cOr do you\nnot know?\u201d</p><p>Rickon drew\na deep breath. \u201cTo be precise, she returns in no possible future I can see. I\nmust assume that Gendry and her die in Essos.\u201d</p><p>His mother\nhung her head. </p><p>\u201cShe did\nnot take your letter seriously then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow did\nyou know, I wrote a letter?\u201d Rickon asked astonished.</p><p>She laughed\nabruptly and shortly.</p><p>\u201cMy dear\nson, all my children and grandchildren are here for my nameday? How stupid do\nyou think I am? I am not the stupid girl I was!\u201d</p><p>Rickon\nsmiled through his tears.</p><p>\u201cNow, my\ndear mother, say it! You were a stupid girl with stupid dreams who never\nlearned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlys tells\nthat to her daughters all the time. I don\u2019t know how I feel about that,\u201d his\nmother admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t\ndo them any harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose\nthere is also little chance I see Brienne one more time?\u201d</p><p>Rickon\nshrugged. This was such a dangerous conversation. He tried to get a grip on his\nfeelings.</p><p>His mother\nstudied his face and then she sighed.</p><p>\u201cThere is\nno use to beat about the bush, Rickon. I feel tired all the time, I\u2019m\nshort-winded, I wake up in the night and my heart beats as if I have run for\nages. I am old, and I will be gone soon.\u201d</p><p>She touched\nhis cheek tenderly and wiped one of his tears away, just with the tip of her\nfinger.</p><p>\u201cThank you\nfor bringing everyone here. It means almost everything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all\nlove you.\u201d</p><p>His mother\nlaughed again. \u201cQueen Darra seems to be a bit in awe of me.\u201d</p><p>Rickon\nsmiled. \u201cYou are the queen of love and beauty. Everyone knows that. And she is\njust the Queen of the seven kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I\nnever was.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWill they\nsort out their differences? Will they heal? Torrhen and her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery\nlikely.\u201d</p><p>His mother\nsighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about\nyou, Rickon? Will there be someone to share your burden, will there be love for\nyou, too?\u201d</p><p>She had\ntaken him unawares yet again. </p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d\nUnbidden he saw a glimpse, like he had seen occasionally. Dark ebony skin, a\nready deep laugh, the bright clothes of a summer islander. He closed his eyes. <i>Concentrate on something else.</i> He looked\nat his mother\u2019s hair. White as the snow surrounding them it was, but it was\nstill full, gleaming in the light of the rising sun.</p><p>\u201cDarkness.\u201d\nHis mother said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarkness\nand a void. That is what awaits us, Jon said. You know. I always told him, that\nhe does not truly know. He might have forgotten what was beyond. He might have\nnot yet been at the place we are meant to go.

                "content": "<p>Here is the next part, for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFq6kZ-YztyyjGzzo8ABcNA\">@acourtofhopeanddreams</a> for the <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv4vOt_63qP6U7337hHFJsw\">@jonsaexchange</a> event! \nMajor character death, you have been warned! \nAlso on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16726092/chapters/39231513\">AO3</a>.\n\n<br /></p><p>Their\npremature arrival had spoiled the serenity of the greeting and the royal\nentrance was filled with laughter and good-natured humour. The Lord Hand\ncomplimented Lady Sansa, the princes eyed Eddard&rsquo;s girls curiously, and Alys\nimmediately took Queen Darra by the hand. Lord Jon arrived shortly before\nEddard led them all into the hall. He still looked like Rickon remembered him,\nblack curls bound back in a bun, his stride confident and he was greeted with\njoy.</p><p>Torrhen&rsquo;s\nchildren then beset to their grandmother and she promised them to go sleighing\nin the afternoon. Rickon thought he managed to comport himself well. He smiled,\nlaughed and was startled only once when he got a glimpse of the maid who would be\nthe one to tell him about finding his mother gone. </p><p>In the\nafternoon Lady Sansa made good on her promise. Queen Darra had to persuade\nBrandon, her eldest, to join them. At fourteen he thought himself too old for\nchildren&rsquo;s play, but when he saw that even his uncles Eddard, Rickon and Benjen\nmade ready to participate, he came along. Rickon and his siblings fell into an\neasy banter, they fought on who could take the sledges, rolled around in the\nsnow, showered each other with snowballs and Brandon soon gave up on trying to\nstand aloof. Little Sam was busy running after either his older siblings, his\nuncles or Eddard&rsquo;s girls and by the end of the day they all were breathless.\nThere was no part of the hill where the snow was untouched. Lord Jon had pulled\nthe sledges tirelessly for his grandchildren, but Lady Sansa had excused\nherself after a while and had taken a seat next to Darra, catching her breath.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Rickon\nstood up the next morning before dawn and went to the godswood, where he knew\nhe was needed. Apparently, fresh snow had fallen over night that now covered\nthe thin harsh crust that had formed after yesterday&rsquo;s slight thaw. The snow\nhad taken strange shapes on the ground. It looked like a tiny landscape with\nbizarre white trees. The red leaves of the weirwood tree made a stark contrast\nto the wintery background and steam seemed to ascend from the earth.</p><p>Lord Jon\nstood at the tree already, his hand touched the stem.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you\nknow I need to talk to you?&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon just\nnodded, stepped beside his stepfather and raised his hand to the tree as well.</p><p>&ldquo;I was a\nbit surprised that supposedly I invited everybody to Winterfell, but I think I\nmanaged to cover up before your mother noticed. I think I might have an idea\nwhy you used my name to let the family gather.&rdquo; Jon looked at his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you\nnot manage to persuade Arya to come? Sansa would have liked to have her here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tried.\nYou know how she is. She persuaded Gendry to sail to Braavos &lsquo;one more time&rsquo; as\nshe called it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Will it be\nthe last time?&rdquo; </p><p>Rickon fell\nsilent awkwardly. How could he forget that Jon had dealt with Uncle Bran and\nthat he was so very observant. <i>I should\nhave worded that differently.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You know,\nI dare not answer that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am\nsorry, Rickon. It is just&hellip;. You do know, how and when we all die, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t\nsee beyond my own death. That is for the next Lord Raven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will there\nbe a next?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That\ndepends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We paid\nthe price, Uncle Jon, you know that. The White Walkers are gone, the Dragons\nare gone. Magic dwindles slowly, but it dwindles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nhaven&rsquo;t called me Uncle Jon in such a long time.&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon felt\nhis heart give a pang. &ldquo;Must be the feeling of being at home. I remember when\nyou pulled my sledge, when you were still Jon Snow, not Jaehaerys Targaryen.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon smiled,\nlost in memory for a little while.</p><p>&ldquo;But there\nis still some magic here, isn&rsquo;t it, here in Winterfell, at the weirwood.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You should\nknow that better than most.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a\nstrange silence before Jon spoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;I wondered\nabout that. You know, my hair is as black as it was in my youth, my skin is\nbarely wrinkled, my step is still light. Sansa complains about the little\nburdens of age. She is a bit short-winded, she tires easily, her eyesight is no\nwhat it was, yet I don&rsquo;t feel any of this. Why is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think\nyou can answer that question yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was\ndead. Really dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you\nwere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, a part\nof magic is alive in me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, when I\ndie, will all the magic be gone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes and no.\nAt the moment, there is still some out here. Enough for me to have visions,\noccasionally that is. The biggest part there is, is contained in you. If you\nrelease it, let it go, it will be loose. It is difficult to see what happens. My\nsight does not carry me neither beyond the death of magic nor beyond my own\ndeath only in glimpses. And the death of all magic is a possibility.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But when I\nlet lose, as you call it, there will be a sudden burst of magic?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will it be\nenough to tip the scales? Enough to enable ice and fire magic again? Enough\nthat dragons can be hatched or that White Walkers come again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really\nget to the heart of the problem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As long as\nI live, the scales will be in balance?&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon nodded,\nhis eyes burning.</p><p>&ldquo;How long\nwill I live?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can see some\nof the things the future Ravens tell me. It is all very blurry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Centuries?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Why has this burden fallen upon me?</i> Again Rickon nodded silently.</p><p>&ldquo;I would\noutlive Sansa, you, our children, the grandchildren. But the sight would stay,\nthere would be Lord Raven to look out for our family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Or a\nLady Raven. The next one will be a Lady, depending on the circumstances.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, if I\ndo not die, you and others will have the sight at least for a while. And the\nprobability that Walkers or Dragons come again would be less?&rdquo; </p><p>Rickon\nbarked a laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I cannot see, what happens if magic vanishes, I\ncannot see what happens beyond my own death, apart from the fact, that I will\nchoose a successor. We don&rsquo;t know enough about the magic of the Children of the\nForest to be entirely sure. But as far as I can figure it out, you are right.\nIf you let go of the magic, there is a chance, that the scales are tipped.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon was\nsilent for a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;So, the\nLord Raven cannot give me any counsel, but to stay alive as long as I can.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked\nup and searched for an answer in Rickon&rsquo;s face. Rickon held back his tears.</p><p>&ldquo;So, if I\ndie, I would leave you to possibly fight with Walkers and dragons, and if I\ndon&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll live on and on until I would be Jaehaerys the even older, or the oldest.&rdquo;\n</p><p>Rickon laughed\ndespite himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I would\nhave to leave. I cannot possibly live here without Sansa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you\nwould grow mad.&rdquo; Rickon whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did\nyou not tell me sooner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it\nwould only have given you grief, but now the time of a choice is upon you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa. She\nhas not been well. How much time do we have left?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Spring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Spring.&rdquo;</p><p>They stood\nin silence for a long time.</p><p>Finally, Jon\npatted him on the shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;This Raven\nbusiness really must be annoying to you as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most of\nthe time, it gives the satisfaction of being able to feel superior.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess, it\nis only fair, given that you know your own death.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>Rickon\nwished he could stop time. A week flew by, Prince Brandon lost some of the\nseriousness that had come when he stopped being a child. He played with his\nsiblings as if he had never forgotten how to do it. Alaric was glad that he\nsomehow had gotten his older brother back and little Sam followed his brothers\neverywhere and they seemed to suffer it with patience. Sometimes they led Sam\nto his grandmother and Sansa told him stories. Eddard&rsquo;s girls were glad for the\nbreaks. Although they must know Sansa&rsquo;s stories by heart, they always listened\nin as well. </p><p>When Rickon\nhappened to sit close by, he closed his eyes. His mother&rsquo;s voice had not\nchanged much. With his eyes closed he could picture himself at her knees as a\nchild, listening to her stories, his twin Eddard close by, at a time when their\nyounger half-siblings had not yet been born. He wished his stepfather would\njoin them more often, but he could not blame him for avoiding him.</p><p>He did not\nexpect his mother to approach him as well. One morning she knocked at his door\nand determinedly took him to the weirwood. He had not foreseen that and\nwondered if he had done something to nudge the future in another direction. Had\nhe said too much to his stepfather?</p><p>When they\nreached the weirwood, Rickon tried every trick that Uncle Bran had told him. He\nstudied the red leaves of the weirwood, he looked at the light of dawn\ntransforming the snow into glittering crystals, he let himself smell the black\nearth beneath the weirwood. It was no use. His mother&rsquo;s first question\nshattered his guard.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t\nsee Arya again, will I?&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon\nshook his head, his eyes suddenly and shockingly filling with tears. </p><p>&ldquo;Nor will\nany of us. Neither Gendry nor she will return.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has she\ndied already?&rdquo; Sansa&rsquo;s voice was hoarse, and she cleared her throat. &ldquo;Or do you\nnot know?&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon drew\na deep breath. &ldquo;To be precise, she returns in no possible future I can see. I\nmust assume that Gendry and her die in Essos.&rdquo;</p><p>His mother\nhung her head. </p><p>&ldquo;She did\nnot take your letter seriously then?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How did\nyou know, I wrote a letter?&rdquo; Rickon asked astonished.</p><p>She laughed\nabruptly and shortly.</p><p>&ldquo;My dear\nson, all my children and grandchildren are here for my nameday? How stupid do\nyou think I am? I am not the stupid girl I was!&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon\nsmiled through his tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, my\ndear mother, say it! You were a stupid girl with stupid dreams who never\nlearned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alys tells\nthat to her daughters all the time. I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about that,&rdquo; his\nmother admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t\ndo them any harm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose\nthere is also little chance I see Brienne one more time?&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon\nshrugged. This was such a dangerous conversation. He tried to get a grip on his\nfeelings.</p><p>His mother\nstudied his face and then she sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;There is\nno use to beat about the bush, Rickon. I feel tired all the time, I&rsquo;m\nshort-winded, I wake up in the night and my heart beats as if I have run for\nages. I am old, and I will be gone soon.&rdquo;</p><p>She touched\nhis cheek tenderly and wiped one of his tears away, just with the tip of her\nfinger.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you\nfor bringing everyone here. It means almost everything to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They all\nlove you.&rdquo;</p><p>His mother\nlaughed again. &ldquo;Queen Darra seems to be a bit in awe of me.&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon\nsmiled. &ldquo;You are the queen of love and beauty. Everyone knows that. And she is\njust the Queen of the seven kingdoms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which I\nnever was.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Will they\nsort out their differences? Will they heal? Torrhen and her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very\nlikely.&rdquo;</p><p>His mother\nsighed.</p><p>&ldquo;What about\nyou, Rickon? Will there be someone to share your burden, will there be love for\nyou, too?&rdquo;</p><p>She had\ntaken him unawares yet again. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;\nUnbidden he saw a glimpse, like he had seen occasionally. Dark ebony skin, a\nready deep laugh, the bright clothes of a summer islander. He closed his eyes. <i>Concentrate on something else.</i> He looked\nat his mother&rsquo;s hair. White as the snow surrounding them it was, but it was\nstill full, gleaming in the light of the rising sun.</p><p>&ldquo;Darkness.&rdquo;\nHis mother said.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Darkness\nand a void. That is what awaits us, Jon said. You know. I always told him, that\nhe does not truly know. He might have forgotten what was beyond. He might have\nnot yet been at the place we are meant to go. If there was only darkness and a\nvoid, how did his soul come back?&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon had\nno answer and just took mother&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not\nworry about me. I worry about Jon. He tries to hide it from me. He complains\nabout his bones hurting, that he lost his vigour. It&rsquo;s all a sham. He even\nlooks barely older than forty.
