        "answer": "<p>Basically a big part of Cersei and Jaime\u2019s relationship is that whenever Jaime decides he wants to have sex, he\u2019ll get it no matter what Cersei says or wants.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n &ldquo;A hundred times I told him no, and he said yes,&rdquo; the other woman told her, &ldquo;until finally I was saying yes as well.

She accurately guessed that Ned wouldn\u2019t just go south without good reason and that his presence would affect Robert. She was worried about being set aside and thought making Joffrey king early was a solution. Jaime, who never had empathy for Cersei, laughed at her worries and started pushing for sex.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the man&rsquo;s laughter.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nInside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\n &ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;stop it, stop it. Oh, please \u2026&rdquo;\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Cersei rightly cared about the political storm heading towards her and as usual to their relationship Jaime didn\u2019t care about her consent.

The man reached down. &ldquo;Take my hand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Before you fall.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength.

The man yanked him up to the ledge. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; the woman demanded.</p><p><b>The man ignored her</b>. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. &ldquo;How old are you, boy?&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in the man&rsquo;s forearm. He let go sheepishly.</p><p>The man looked over at the woman. &ldquo;The things I do for love,&rdquo; he said with loathing. He gave Bran a shove.</p><p>Screaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was nothing to grab on to. The courtyard rushed up to meet him.\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Even if you hate Cersei and you think she&rsquo;s 100% responsible for Jaime&rsquo;s actions, Bran was falling and if Cersei was content to let that happen, Jaime was the one who pulled him up, asked his age and shoved him.</p><p>This fandom&rsquo;s habit of blaming Cersei for Jaime&rsquo;s mistakes and evil deeds while crediting Jaime for the few good deeds he has done is so damn annoying. Does Jaime have agency or not? Why must Cersei be responsible for her actions and Jaime&rsquo;s too? He is a grown man capable of making decisions. He is not a poor little abuse victim completely dominated by an evil woman for fuck&rsquo;s sake.</p>",
