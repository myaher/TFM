Nothing that should worry him. He just never noticed before because of the dye on his head, and, well, he never really had a reason to look too closely at his pubic hair.</p><p>But now, the image of his body was staring back at him from the foggy mirror, mocking. It was there, screaming right in his face, refusing to be ignored. He was getting older.</p><p>*********************************</p><p>His mum always recalled fondly the story of how he once cried for two hours straight when he was five, throwing the biggest tantrum after she came back home from the barber with a new haircut. Telling how the moment he saw her his little face turned red and his big eyes turned wet and his sobs were so loud his father ran into the room thinking he got seriously hurt.</p><p>\u201cHe ordered me to go and change it back!\u201d she exclaimed once, laughing, when he and Dan were visiting his parents\u2019 house and she was retelling the story. \u201cSaid I don\u2019t look like his mother anymore!\u201d</p><p>Everyone where chuckling at his younger self\u2019s expense, and Phil groaned loudly accordingly (not because he was actually embarrassed, no, but because he knew it wasn\u2019t as fun for them if he didn\u2019t act at least a little bit bothered).</p><p>Dan was grinning, his cheeks a little red from the wine they opened earlier that night, his hand resting absentmindedly in Phil\u2019s lap. \u201cOh, that sounds just like him,\u201d he said, throwing a fond smile in Phil\u2019s direction and earning himself a small push to the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe poor thing, you should have seen his face when I said I can\u2019t actually change it back,\u201d she said, shaking her head, her face soft and reminiscing. She leaned forward, reaching from her seat to pat his hand. \u201cI think that was the moment he realized you can\u2019t turn the clock back.\u201d</p><p>*************************************</p><p>\u201cPhil? Are you listening?\u201d Dan asked, snapping his finger impatiently in front of his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry, just zoned out,\u201d he said, refocusing himself on Dan and the pile of files in front of them on the dining table.</p><p>They were at it for a few hours now, trying to figure out dates and venues and flights for the tour, and Phil was more than a little unfocused.</p><p>He woke up that morning with a throbbing in his head and a tiredness even the third cup of coffee couldn\u2019t fix. He tried putting on his contacts but his eyes were drier than usual, and Dan vetoed the action as soon as he saw the struggle, reminding him that the doctor said he should start having more glasses days.</p><p>Dan\u2019s features softened when he caught his eye, studying him carefully. \u201cDo you want to call it a night? I can stay for a bit longer, send a few more emails and then join you,\u201d Dan said, his hand instinctively reaching up to push Phil\u2019s fringe back and touch his forehead, the cool palm feeling nice against his warm skin. \u201cYou might actually have a slight fever,\u201d Dan mumbled, drawing his hand away and looking a bit concerned.</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine, lets keep going.\u201d He said, straitening up in his chair, ignoring the disapproving look on Dan\u2019s face.</p><p>They both could feel it, he knew they could. The strain that planning this tour put on Phil was bigger than any project they did before. Bigger than Tatinof, or their book. It was hard on him, staying late planning and spending all day rehearsing. Hard on both of them, but somehow Dan still looked fresh after a week of intense schedule while Phil felt like if he let himself lie down now, he might never find the strength to get up again.</p><p>And it was silly, he knew it was. There were a million reasons why he was having more trouble this time around. There was the fact that he felt more settled, more ready for the quiet domestic life after experiencing what it was like to travel the world, less eager to leave the comfort of his home for the second time. There was the fact that he remembered how hard it was to be on the road every day, how bad the travel sickness was and how tired they felt almost constantly. There were the changes to his and Dan\u2019s routine- they slept more regular hours now, trying to have a functioning living schedule and therefore feeling the strain when they were messing with their sleep or overworking themselves.</p><p>But he knew, that in addition to all that, there was also the simple fact that he was getting older.</p><p>It felt stupid, to be this upset about something so natural. He never cared before, not really. And he could never admit this to Dan, or to anyone for that matter, but the sight of the few white streaks on his groin was bothering him in a way he ever thought it would.</p><p>He was always bad with change, ever since he was young, he wanted everything to stay the same. Whether it was his mother\u2019s haircut or his parents selling his childhood home, he always struggled with adapting to new things. But for some reason, the amount of obsessing and anxiety this new revelation about his own changes caused him, caught him by surprise, making him dwell on it more than usual.</p><p>\u201cActually, on second thought I think we both did enough for today,\u201d Dan declared, snapping him out of his thoughts, flopping down heavily with his face on the table. \u201cI\u2019m beat, do you want to make some popcorn and watch a movie?\u201d His voice was demanding and a little whiny and Phil couldn\u2019t help but smile, because Dan knew the most useful way to get him to do something was to make him feel like it was all for Dan, and not for himself.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, letting his voice grow warmer, reaching to pat Dan\u2019s head on the table. \u201cYou go choose the movie and I\u2019ll go make some popcorn.\u201d He got up, but stopped when a hand curled around his, squeezing his fingers. He turned around, locking his eyes with Dan\u2019s, fighting the urge to avert his look from the searching stare.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t burn it like last time,\u201d Dan said eventually, lightheartedly, bringing Phil\u2019s fingers to his lips, kissing the tips.</p><p>Phil let out a breath, tugging his hand free before leaning down to press his lips to Dan\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</p><p>*************************************</p><p>Dan was kissing down his body, lips insistent, pressing down on all the spots he knew, from years of experience, would draw the loudest responses from Phil\u2019s mouth.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long day. So long that Phil was having trouble remembering what they did for the most of it (or maybe it was Dan\u2019s thumb, that was rubbing against Phil\u2019s right nipple, that was making him forget for a moment).</p><p>Dan\u2019s touch was a blissful distraction from his aching limbs and the everlasting presence of the heavy exhaustion behind his eyes, and it was more than welcome.</p><p>Dan was moving down his body slowly, taking more time than usual to get to the point. And its not like Phil particularly minded, usually. He loved romantic touches, loved feeling treasured and appreciated, but they were in this positon for some time now and Phil was starting to get more than a little flustered.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he whined, bucking his hips up and urging him to get on with it already, earning himself a chuckle in return and a kiss to the hip, soft and ticklish.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d Dan said, but his fingers were finally, finally, hooking around the material of his pants, tugging down and letting the cool air meet Phil\u2019s heated skin. Phil let out sigh of relief, head resting on the pillow and eyes closed.</p><p>Only, Dan didn\u2019t do anything after that. The room was silent while Phil waited for Dan to wrap his fingers, his mouth, anything really, around him, opening his eyes after a few moments when he felt a poke to the base of his cock, making him jump.</p><p>\u201cWhat-\u201c he started, lifting his head and looking down at Dan, ready to reprimand, finding Dan looking with concentration right at his crotch, a small frown on his face.</p><p>And that\u2019s when Phil remembered what he did a couple of days ago after looking at his defendant body for 10 minutes in the mirror, what he did after deciding he didn\u2019t want to look at the evidence anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou shaved?\u201d Dan asked, confused, bringing his eyes up to look at Phil.</p><p>Phil could feel some of the blood rush from his lower region to his face, making him flush bright pink.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, fighting the urge to cover himself up.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dan questioned. And for some reason, it made Phil a little angry.</p><p>\u201cDo I need a reason for grooming?\u201d he said, and he meant for it to sound like a lighthearted banter, but it wasn\u2019t hard to detect the edge in his voice, and he had no doubt Dan heard it as well.</p><p>Dan sat up on his knees, drawing away from Phil\u2019s body, looking a little taken aback. \u201cAre you planning to tell me what\u2019s been going on with you lately any time soon? Or do you want me to keep pretending I haven\u2019t noticed your weird behavior?\u201d Dan asked, and there was a small edge to his voice as well and suddenly all Phil wanted was to put his clothes back on and go to sleep.</p><p>He sat up as well, pulling his pants over his hips. He felt embarrassed, for the lack of better word. Embarrassed that Dan was bringing attention to this weird shame of his, embarrassed that he was even feeling ashamed. \u201cNothing\u2019s been going on,\u201d he insisted, refusing to meet Dan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Dan took a breath, undoubtedly stopping himself from snapping at Phil. he\u2019s been tired too, Phil knows, and the last thing they should do when they are both in this state was have an unnecessary fight.</p><p>About pubic hair, no less.</p><p>Dan shuffled closer again, putting his hand on Phil\u2019s knee, thumb rubbing against his skin. \u201cI mean, not that I mind a shaved crotch,\u201d he said, trying to muster a smile. Phil had to fight the strong cringing feeling that was telling him to flee the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s true what they say, everything does look a lot bigger in comparison,\u201d he tried to tease, to ease the tension, and Phil couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes in response, lips curving up just a little. Dan looked pleased with himself for that. \u201cBut I much rather you did it because you actually wanted to and not because of some weird crisis,\u201d he added, a little more serious, thumb still insistently moving against his knee.</p><p>Phil kept quiet for a few moments, caving finally when Dan\u2019s other hand sneaked into his, squeezing his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s silly,\u201d he said, shifting his eyes to look at Dan, because protesting again felt stubborn and unnecessary and really, he didn\u2019t want to give his issue a bigger stage than it deserved.</p><p>\u201cMost of your crises are,\u201d Dan said, teasing, but his smile was relived, and Phil hated that he made him worry about something so stupid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s silly,\u201d he said again, \u201cand I kind of want to work on it on my own, okay?\u201d he was trying to smile at Dan reassuringly, calmly, squeezing his hand back.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t look too convinced, but Phil knew he wouldn\u2019t push. They tried not to push each other, not unless completely necessary. Tried to give each other the space to work their own stuff out if asked for it, tried to respect each other\u2019s boundaries.</p><p>And even though it looked like Dan had a few more things he wanted to say, he let out a sigh, letting go of Phil\u2019s hand. \u201cDo you still want that blowjob?\u201d he asked, voice serious, pushing Phil back on the bed when all he could get out was a surprised laugh, kissing his lips and muffling the sound.</p><p>*******************************</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to change my hair,\u201d Phil said on a Saturday morning while they were sitting next to each other on the couch, the tv playing in the background while both of them had their laptops open on their knees, browsing quietly.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have rehearsals that day, and they decided they should be able to squeeze one pajamas day every once in a while, for both their sakes.</p><p>It was a few days after what Phil liked to call \u2018the crotch incident\u2019, even though Dan didn\u2019t bring up the subject even once, letting Phil think about it in his own pace.</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d Dan hummed in approval, not lifting his eyes up from his computer. Truthfully, Phil couldn\u2019t blame him. He was toying with the idea of getting a new haircut for a few months now, going over it again and again with Dan, never actually having the courage to do it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, I made the appointment, I\u2019m doing it today,\u201d he said, watching the way Dan\u2019s eyes shot up to his, trying to see if he was being genuine.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dan asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Phil said determinedly, even though he could feel his stomach tightening with nerves.</p><p>They\u2019ve been over this a million times before. His irrational fear of changing something that was so iconically his, losing the support of his followers, not liking the way he would look, feeling like he was losing his identity without his fringe.</p><p>And still, Phil felt confident about his decision. Mostly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 great Phil!\u201d Dan said carefully, eyeing his reaction. \u201cCan I ask why now?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged, putting his laptop aside and crawling into Dan\u2019s space, resting his head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2026 don\u2019t want to be 60 years old, still clinging to who I was in the past, not letting myself grow,\u201d he said, feeling Dan\u2019s hand reaching up to push his hair back, making space for his lips.</p><p>He let out a breath, closing his eyes to the touch. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change.\u201d</p><p>Notes:</p><p>haha so&hellip; yeah. i&rsquo;m not sure what this is but this idea was sitting in my head for some time now, so there you go ^^&ldquo; </p><p>i hope you liked it!! please let me know your thoughts</p>",

Nothing that should worry him. He just never noticed before because of the dye on his head, and, well, he never really had a reason to look too closely at his pubic hair.</p><p>But now, the image of his body was staring back at him from the foggy mirror, mocking.

Nothing that should worry him. He just never noticed before because of the dye on his head, and, well, he never really had a reason to look too closely at his pubic hair.</p><p>But now, the image of his body was staring back at him from the foggy mirror, mocking. It was there, screaming right in his face, refusing to be ignored. He was getting older.</p><p>*********************************</p><p>His mum always recalled fondly the story of how he once cried for two hours straight when he was five, throwing the biggest tantrum after she came back home from the barber with a new haircut. Telling how the moment he saw her his little face turned red and his big eyes turned wet and his sobs were so loud his father ran into the room thinking he got seriously hurt.</p><p>\u201cHe ordered me to go and change it back!\u201d she exclaimed once, laughing, when he and Dan were visiting his parents\u2019 house and she was retelling the story. \u201cSaid I don\u2019t look like his mother anymore!\u201d</p><p>Everyone where chuckling at his younger self\u2019s expense, and Phil groaned loudly accordingly (not because he was actually embarrassed, no, but because he knew it wasn\u2019t as fun for them if he didn\u2019t act at least a little bit bothered).</p><p>Dan was grinning, his cheeks a little red from the wine they opened earlier that night, his hand resting absentmindedly in Phil\u2019s lap. \u201cOh, that sounds just like him,\u201d he said, throwing a fond smile in Phil\u2019s direction and earning himself a small push to the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe poor thing, you should have seen his face when I said I can\u2019t actually change it back,\u201d she said, shaking her head, her face soft and reminiscing. She leaned forward, reaching from her seat to pat his hand. \u201cI think that was the moment he realized you can\u2019t turn the clock back.\u201d</p><p>*************************************</p><p>\u201cPhil? Are you listening?\u201d Dan asked, snapping his finger impatiently in front of his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry, just zoned out,\u201d he said, refocusing himself on Dan and the pile of files in front of them on the dining table.</p><p>They were at it for a few hours now, trying to figure out dates and venues and flights for the tour, and Phil was more than a little unfocused.</p><p>He woke up that morning with a throbbing in his head and a tiredness even the third cup of coffee couldn\u2019t fix. He tried putting on his contacts but his eyes were drier than usual, and Dan vetoed the action as soon as he saw the struggle, reminding him that the doctor said he should start having more glasses days.</p><p>Dan\u2019s features softened when he caught his eye, studying him carefully. \u201cDo you want to call it a night? I can stay for a bit longer, send a few more emails and then join you,\u201d Dan said, his hand instinctively reaching up to push Phil\u2019s fringe back and touch his forehead, the cool palm feeling nice against his warm skin. \u201cYou might actually have a slight fever,\u201d Dan mumbled, drawing his hand away and looking a bit concerned.</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine, lets keep going.\u201d He said, straitening up in his chair, ignoring the disapproving look on Dan\u2019s face.</p><p>They both could feel it, he knew they could. The strain that planning this tour put on Phil was bigger than any project they did before. Bigger than Tatinof, or their book. It was hard on him, staying late planning and spending all day rehearsing. Hard on both of them, but somehow Dan still looked fresh after a week of intense schedule while Phil felt like if he let himself lie down now, he might never find the strength to get up again.</p><p>And it was silly, he knew it was. There were a million reasons why he was having more trouble this time around. There was the fact that he felt more settled, more ready for the quiet domestic life after experiencing what it was like to travel the world, less eager to leave the comfort of his home for the second time. There was the fact that he remembered how hard it was to be on the road every day, how bad the travel sickness was and how tired they felt almost constantly. There were the changes to his and Dan\u2019s routine- they slept more regular hours now, trying to have a functioning living schedule and therefore feeling the strain when they were messing with their sleep or overworking themselves.</p><p>But he knew, that in addition to all that, there was also the simple fact that he was getting older.</p><p>It felt stupid, to be this upset about something so natural. He never cared before, not really. And he could never admit this to Dan, or to anyone for that matter, but the sight of the few white streaks on his groin was bothering him in a way he ever thought it would.</p><p>He was always bad with change, ever since he was young, he wanted everything to stay the same. Whether it was his mother\u2019s haircut or his parents selling his childhood home, he always struggled with adapting to new things. But for some reason, the amount of obsessing and anxiety this new revelation about his own changes caused him, caught him by surprise, making him dwell on it more than usual.</p><p>\u201cActually, on second thought I think we both did enough for today,\u201d Dan declared, snapping him out of his thoughts, flopping down heavily with his face on the table. \u201cI\u2019m beat, do you want to make some popcorn and watch a movie?\u201d His voice was demanding and a little whiny and Phil couldn\u2019t help but smile, because Dan knew the most useful way to get him to do something was to make him feel like it was all for Dan, and not for himself.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, letting his voice grow warmer, reaching to pat Dan\u2019s head on the table. \u201cYou go choose the movie and I\u2019ll go make some popcorn.\u201d He got up, but stopped when a hand curled around his, squeezing his fingers. He turned around, locking his eyes with Dan\u2019s, fighting the urge to avert his look from the searching stare.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t burn it like last time,\u201d Dan said eventually, lightheartedly, bringing Phil\u2019s fingers to his lips, kissing the tips.</p><p>Phil let out a breath, tugging his hand free before leaning down to press his lips to Dan\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</p><p>*************************************</p><p>Dan was kissing down his body, lips insistent, pressing down on all the spots he knew, from years of experience, would draw the loudest responses from Phil\u2019s mouth.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long day. So long that Phil was having trouble remembering what they did for the most of it (or maybe it was Dan\u2019s thumb, that was rubbing against Phil\u2019s right nipple, that was making him forget for a moment).</p><p>Dan\u2019s touch was a blissful distraction from his aching limbs and the everlasting presence of the heavy exhaustion behind his eyes, and it was more than welcome.</p><p>Dan was moving down his body slowly, taking more time than usual to get to the point. And its not like Phil particularly minded, usually. He loved romantic touches, loved feeling treasured and appreciated, but they were in this positon for some time now and Phil was starting to get more than a little flustered.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he whined, bucking his hips up and urging him to get on with it already, earning himself a chuckle in return and a kiss to the hip, soft and ticklish.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d Dan said, but his fingers were finally, finally, hooking around the material of his pants, tugging down and letting the cool air meet Phil\u2019s heated skin. Phil let out sigh of relief, head resting on the pillow and eyes closed.</p><p>Only, Dan didn\u2019t do anything after that. The room was silent while Phil waited for Dan to wrap his fingers, his mouth, anything really, around him, opening his eyes after a few moments when he felt a poke to the base of his cock, making him jump.</p><p>\u201cWhat-\u201c he started, lifting his head and looking down at Dan, ready to reprimand, finding Dan looking with concentration right at his crotch, a small frown on his face.</p><p>And that\u2019s when Phil remembered what he did a couple of days ago after looking at his defendant body for 10 minutes in the mirror, what he did after deciding he didn\u2019t want to look at the evidence anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou shaved?\u201d Dan asked, confused, bringing his eyes up to look at Phil.</p><p>Phil could feel some of the blood rush from his lower region to his face, making him flush bright pink.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, fighting the urge to cover himself up.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dan questioned. And for some reason, it made Phil a little angry.</p><p>\u201cDo I need a reason for grooming?\u201d he said, and he meant for it to sound like a lighthearted banter, but it wasn\u2019t hard to detect the edge in his voice, and he had no doubt Dan heard it as well.</p><p>Dan sat up on his knees, drawing away from Phil\u2019s body, looking a little taken aback. \u201cAre you planning to tell me what\u2019s been going on with you lately any time soon? Or do you want me to keep pretending I haven\u2019t noticed your weird behavior?\u201d Dan asked, and there was a small edge to his voice as well and suddenly all Phil wanted was to put his clothes back on and go to sleep.</p><p>He sat up as well, pulling his pants over his hips. He felt embarrassed, for the lack of better word. Embarrassed that Dan was bringing attention to this weird shame of his, embarrassed that he was even feeling ashamed. \u201cNothing\u2019s been going on,\u201d he insisted, refusing to meet Dan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Dan took a breath, undoubtedly stopping himself from snapping at Phil. he\u2019s been tired too, Phil knows, and the last thing they should do when they are both in this state was have an unnecessary fight.</p><p>About pubic hair, no less.</p><p>Dan shuffled closer again, putting his hand on Phil\u2019s knee, thumb rubbing against his skin. \u201cI mean, not that I mind a shaved crotch,\u201d he said, trying to muster a smile. Phil had to fight the strong cringing feeling that was telling him to flee the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s true what they say, everything does look a lot bigger in comparison,\u201d he tried to tease, to ease the tension, and Phil couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes in response, lips curving up just a little. Dan looked pleased with himself for that. \u201cBut I much rather you did it because you actually wanted to and not because of some weird crisis,\u201d he added, a little more serious, thumb still insistently moving against his knee.</p><p>Phil kept quiet for a few moments, caving finally when Dan\u2019s other hand sneaked into his, squeezing his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s silly,\u201d he said, shifting his eyes to look at Dan, because protesting again felt stubborn and unnecessary and really, he didn\u2019t want to give his issue a bigger stage than it deserved.</p><p>\u201cMost of your crises are,\u201d Dan said, teasing, but his smile was relived, and Phil hated that he made him worry about something so stupid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s silly,\u201d he said again, \u201cand I kind of want to work on it on my own, okay?\u201d he was trying to smile at Dan reassuringly, calmly, squeezing his hand back.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t look too convinced, but Phil knew he wouldn\u2019t push. They tried not to push each other, not unless completely necessary. Tried to give each other the space to work their own stuff out if asked for it, tried to respect each other\u2019s boundaries.</p><p>And even though it looked like Dan had a few more things he wanted to say, he let out a sigh, letting go of Phil\u2019s hand. \u201cDo you still want that blowjob?\u201d he asked, voice serious, pushing Phil back on the bed when all he could get out was a surprised laugh, kissing his lips and muffling the sound.</p><p>*******************************</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to change my hair,\u201d Phil said on a Saturday morning while they were sitting next to each other on the couch, the tv playing in the background while both of them had their laptops open on their knees, browsing quietly.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have rehearsals that day, and they decided they should be able to squeeze one pajamas day every once in a while, for both their sakes.</p><p>It was a few days after what Phil liked to call \u2018the crotch incident\u2019, even though Dan didn\u2019t bring up the subject even once, letting Phil think about it in his own pace.</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d Dan hummed in approval, not lifting his eyes up from his computer. Truthfully, Phil couldn\u2019t blame him. He was toying with the idea of getting a new haircut for a few months now, going over it again and again with Dan, never actually having the courage to do it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, I made the appointment, I\u2019m doing it today,\u201d he said, watching the way Dan\u2019s eyes shot up to his, trying to see if he was being genuine.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dan asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Phil said determinedly, even though he could feel his stomach tightening with nerves.</p><p>They\u2019ve been over this a million times before. His irrational fear of changing something that was so iconically his, losing the support of his followers, not liking the way he would look, feeling like he was losing his identity without his fringe.</p><p>And still, Phil felt confident about his decision. Mostly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 great Phil!\u201d Dan said carefully, eyeing his reaction. \u201cCan I ask why now?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged, putting his laptop aside and crawling into Dan\u2019s space, resting his head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2026 don\u2019t want to be 60 years old, still clinging to who I was in the past, not letting myself grow,\u201d he said, feeling Dan\u2019s hand reaching up to push his hair back, making space for his lips.</p><p>He let out a breath, closing his eyes to the touch. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change.\u201d</p><p>Notes:</p><p>haha so\u2026 yeah. i\u2019m not sure what this is but this idea was sitting in my head for some time now, so there you go ^^\u201c </p><p>i hope you liked it!! please let me know your thoughts</p></p>",

So long that Phil was having trouble remembering what they did for the most of it (or maybe it was Dan&rsquo;s thumb, that was rubbing against Phil&rsquo;s right nipple, that was making him forget for a moment).</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s touch was a blissful distraction from his aching limbs and the everlasting presence of the heavy exhaustion behind his eyes, and it was more than welcome.</p><p>Dan was moving down his body slowly, taking more time than usual to get to the point. And its not like Phil particularly minded, usually. He loved romantic touches, loved feeling treasured and appreciated, but they were in this positon for some time now and Phil was starting to get more than a little flustered.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he whined, bucking his hips up and urging him to get on with it already, earning himself a chuckle in return and a kiss to the hip, soft and ticklish.</p><p>&ldquo;Shush,&rdquo; Dan said, but his fingers were finally, finally, hooking around the material of his pants, tugging down and letting the cool air meet Phil&rsquo;s heated skin. Phil let out sigh of relief, head resting on the pillow and eyes closed.</p><p>Only, Dan didn&rsquo;t do anything after that. The room was silent while Phil waited for Dan to wrap his fingers, his mouth, anything really, around him, opening his eyes after a few moments when he felt a poke to the base of his cock, making him jump.</p><p>&ldquo;What-&ldquo; he started, lifting his head and looking down at Dan, ready to reprimand, finding Dan looking with concentration right at his crotch, a small frown on his face.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s when Phil remembered what he did a couple of days ago after looking at his defendant body for 10 minutes in the mirror, what he did after deciding he didn&rsquo;t want to look at the evidence anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;You shaved?&rdquo; Dan asked, confused, bringing his eyes up to look at Phil.</p><p>Phil could feel some of the blood rush from his lower region to his face, making him flush bright pink.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, fighting the urge to cover himself up.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Dan questioned. And for some reason, it made Phil a little angry.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I need a reason for grooming?&rdquo; he said, and he meant for it to sound like a lighthearted banter, but it wasn&rsquo;t hard to detect the edge in his voice, and he had no doubt Dan heard it as well.</p><p>Dan sat up on his knees, drawing away from Phil&rsquo;s body, looking a little taken aback. &ldquo;Are you planning to tell me what&rsquo;s been going on with you lately any time soon? Or do you want me to keep pretending I haven&rsquo;t noticed your weird behavior?&rdquo; Dan asked, and there was a small edge to his voice as well and suddenly all Phil wanted was to put his clothes back on and go to sleep.</p><p>He sat up as well, pulling his pants over his hips. He felt embarrassed, for the lack of better word. Embarrassed that Dan was bringing attention to this weird shame of his, embarrassed that he was even feeling ashamed. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s been going on,&rdquo; he insisted, refusing to meet Dan&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>Dan took a breath, undoubtedly stopping himself from snapping at Phil. he&rsquo;s been tired too, Phil knows, and the last thing they should do when they are both in this state was have an unnecessary fight.</p><p>About pubic hair, no less.</p><p>Dan shuffled closer again, putting his hand on Phil&rsquo;s knee, thumb rubbing against his skin. &ldquo;I mean, not that I mind a shaved crotch,&rdquo; he said, trying to muster a smile. Phil had to fight the strong cringing feeling that was telling him to flee the situation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true what they say, everything does look a lot bigger in comparison,&rdquo; he tried to tease, to ease the tension, and Phil couldn&rsquo;t help but roll his eyes in response, lips curving up just a little. Dan looked pleased with himself for that. &ldquo;But I much rather you did it because you actually wanted to and not because of some weird crisis,&rdquo; he added, a little more serious, thumb still insistently moving against his knee.</p><p>Phil kept quiet for a few moments, caving finally when Dan&rsquo;s other hand sneaked into his, squeezing his fingers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly,&rdquo; he said, shifting his eyes to look at Dan, because protesting again felt stubborn and unnecessary and really, he didn&rsquo;t want to give his issue a bigger stage than it deserved.</p><p>&ldquo;Most of your crises are,&rdquo; Dan said, teasing, but his smile was relived, and Phil hated that he made him worry about something so stupid.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly,&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;and I kind of want to work on it on my own, okay?&rdquo; he was trying to smile at Dan reassuringly, calmly, squeezing his hand back.</p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t look too convinced, but Phil knew he wouldn&rsquo;t push. They tried not to push each other, not unless completely necessary. Tried to give each other the space to work their own stuff out if asked for it, tried to respect each other&rsquo;s boundaries.</p><p>And even though it looked like Dan had a few more things he wanted to say, he let out a sigh, letting go of Phil&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Do you still want that blowjob?&rdquo; he asked, voice serious, pushing Phil back on the bed when all he could get out was a surprised laugh, kissing his lips and muffling the sound.</p><p>*******************************</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to change my hair,&rdquo; Phil said on a Saturday morning while they were sitting next to each other on the couch, the tv playing in the background while both of them had their laptops open on their knees, browsing quietly.</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t have rehearsals that day, and they decided they should be able to squeeze one pajamas day every once in a while, for both their sakes.</p><p>It was a few days after what Phil liked to call &lsquo;the crotch incident&rsquo;, even though Dan didn&rsquo;t bring up the subject even once, letting Phil think about it in his own pace.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm,&rdquo; Dan hummed in approval, not lifting his eyes up from his computer. Truthfully, Phil couldn&rsquo;t blame him. He was toying with the idea of getting a new haircut for a few months now, going over it again and again with Dan, never actually having the courage to do it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious, I made the appointment, I&rsquo;m doing it today,&rdquo; he said, watching the way Dan&rsquo;s eyes shot up to his, trying to see if he was being genuine.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Dan asked in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Phil said determinedly, even though he could feel his stomach tightening with nerves.</p><p>They&rsquo;ve been over this a million times before. His irrational fear of changing something that was so iconically his, losing the support of his followers, not liking the way he would look, feeling like he was losing his identity without his fringe.</p><p>And still, Phil felt confident about his decision. Mostly.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; great Phil!&rdquo; Dan said carefully, eyeing his reaction. &ldquo;Can I ask why now?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shrugged, putting his laptop aside and crawling into Dan&rsquo;s space, resting his head on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;I just&hellip; don&rsquo;t want to be 60 years old, still clinging to who I was in the past, not letting myself grow,&rdquo; he said, feeling Dan&rsquo;s hand reaching up to push his hair back, making space for his lips.</p><p>He let out a breath, closing his eyes to the touch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for a change.&rdquo;</p><p>Notes:</p><p>haha so&hellip; yeah. i&rsquo;m not sure what this is but this idea was sitting in my head for some time now, so there you go ^^&ldquo; </p><p>i hope you liked it!! please let me know your thoughts</p></p>",
