A sense of awe filled the room as the children opened their mail and noticed that plastered on the front page of The Daily Prophet was their Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. Lyra was hunched over a bed, tending to an obviously ill patient, holding a vial near their face. The article read:</p><p><i>PSYROT PANDEMIC OVER!</i></p><!-- more --><p><i>Written by Gustav Novak</i></p><p><i>Over the weekend patients at St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries had the privilege of receiving the recently discovered cure to Psyrot.</i></p><p><i>Psyrot is a disease that has been plaguing the witches and wizards of the United Kingdom over the past few months. It is a devastating illness that can ultimately result in death. Psyrot is easily treated by Pepper Up during the early stages but unfortunately there was no cure for those afflicted by the later stages of the disease, resulting in the death of three witches and two wizards.</i></p><p><i>However, the cure has recently been developed and discovered by Lyra Lestrange, aged 20, current Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts and ex-Trainee Healer at St. Mungo\u2019s, seen pictured above.</i></p><p><i>In conjunction with teaching at Hogwarts, Lyra has spent every spare moment dedicated to discovering the root cause of Psyrot as well as what could possibly be used to treat it after one of her students was revealed to be afflicted with disease.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was quite frightening really,\u201d Lyra recalls, \u201cThe boy had seized during dinner one night, obviously in the late stages of the disease. That\u2019s what prompted me into investigating the disease.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lyra is a modest witch, attributing her success to her colleagues.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHonestly, the witches and wizards that they get to work at Hogwarts really know their stuff. Silvanus Kettleburn, Professor of Care of Magical Creatures was the first I went to and he gave me such great insight into the workings of the parasite responsible. Then Professor Pomona Sprout directed me in all things Herbology and finally the Potions Master, Severus Snape, assisted me in creating the cure.\u201d</i></p><p><i>As a result of her discovery Lyra looks to possibly resuming her career in Healing and working towards curing other magical ailments. Look out for her report in this week\u2019s copy of Magical Inquiries and Discoveries.</i></p><p>Lyra herself graced the hall with her presence soon after the arrival of the post. She entered the room via the door behind the High Table, followed closely behind by Severus. They had attempted to stagger their appearance but still managed to catch up with one another on the way there.</p><p>As Lyra stepped up on to the stage she was oblivious to the fact that the students were taken by her appearance, distracted by the few owls that bore letters surrounding her plate. With a confused look on her face, she took her seat but before she could begin to consider the letters in front of her the Transfiguration Professor addressed her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lyra,\u201d she said, \u201cWe\u2019re all so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Lyra glanced down the table and noticed that most of her colleagues were smiling at her. \u201cSorry what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsyrot?\u201d Minerva said, thrusting her own copy of the prophet to Lyra.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh,\u201d she replied, noticing the image of herself on the front paper. \u201cRight, yes, Psyrot. Thanks. That explains the letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFans, no doubt,\u201d Minerva said, \u201cIt\u2019s all very exciting but I\u2019m disappointed to find out that you\u2019re planning on resigning at the end of the year through a newspaper article.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>Minerva pulled the paper back and began to read from the article, \u201c Lyra looks to possibly resuming her career in healing and working towards curing other magical ailments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I did mention that to Gus,\u201d Lyra replied sheepishly, \u201cDidn\u2019t know he\u2019d use that in the article but he twisted my words slightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Albus would like to speak to you about this whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your breakfast,\u201d Minerva said as she left.</p><p>Lyra turned to The Potions Master sat next to her and asked, \u201cIs she mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly, he replied, his head tilting to one side.</p><p>Lyra reached to pluck a letter off of the foot of one of the owls but it began to peck at her fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably hungry,\u201d Severus pointed out.</p><p>Lyra grumbled as she pulled out her wand, summoning some food for both herself and her feathery friends. The owls began to feast, allowing Lyra to pull the letters off. She read them as she ate, tuning out \u00a0her surroundings. The first one she read was plucked off of her own owl, Silver. She expected it to be a response from her cousin but was surprised when she pulled it out.</p><p><i>Lyra,</i></p><p><i>Congratulations on your discovery. Cissy and I were surprised to see you in the paper this morning but nonetheless, we are proud of what you have achieved. Draco has already cut out the article and stuck it to the wall of his bedroom.</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ve had a few friends already reach out to me, asking whether I could put them in touch with you. They would be delighted to work with a bright witch such as yourself, particularly as rumour has it you may be awarded an Order of Merlin for your work. It would be nice if you resumed your healing career and returned home, Draco misses you dearly and of course so do Cissy and I.</i></p><p><i>Do come by when you can, I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you.</i></p><p><i>From your Uncle Lucius</i></p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes narrowed as she reread the second paragraph, her eyes caught on the words \u2018 <i>Order of Merlin</i> \u2019.</p><p>An Order of Merlin.</p><p>Lyra Lestrange, Order of Merlin First Class. Or Second or Third.</p><p>That had a ring to it.</p><p>That would completely reinvent herself and her name, it would remove the taint of her parents from the Lestrange name and allow her to be her own person.</p><p>She stopped herself, not allowing her thoughts to run too rampant. Surely it was just a joke, a trick Lucius was playing to try and sway her away from the teaching position at Hogwarts and instead return to a Healing career. But, if she did have an OM, maybe Narcissa would finally stop nagging her about getting married and she could pursue Healing to a whole other level.</p><p>Lyra was pulled from her fantasies as she felt the paper get tugged away from her hands. Her head turned quickly towards the culprit and she saw Severus\u2019 eyes glossing over the paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat if that was private?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201c Order of Merlin ,\u201d he read slowly, his narrowed at the paper. Severus folded it before handing it back with a questioning look.</p><p>His face said it all to Lyra. It probably wasn\u2019t a genuine nomination, Lucius was awfully close with the Minister of Magic. Lyra was sure that Lucius himself would have nominated her, if not paid the Ministry off to do so. There\u2019d be something in it for Lucius too, no doubt a story he could spin to increase the prestige of the Malfoy name.</p><p>Silently she took the parchment, placing it on the table before breaking open the other letters. Each of those letters were from witches and wizards with rather high positions in well established Hospitals, similar to St. Mungo\u2019s, congratulating her on her discovery and offering her either apprenticeships or employment within their Hospital\u2019s research division. Lyra didn\u2019t know how to feel, she was overwhelmed by the response and felt happy but Hogwarts had quickly become her home. She was hesitant to leave, particularly now that she felt comfortable with Severus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you wanted isn\u2019t it?\u201d he commented.</p><p>Lyra looked to him, feeling uncertain of what to say. She should\u2019ve been proud and excited, she could feel her heart sing from the recognition but her head was weighing her down, questioning what she was going to do next.</p><p>There was a swoop of wind heard above and a red enveloped dropped in front of her. Severus pulled his wand out and muttered an incantation before prompting Lyra to open it. As she did the envelope slipped between her fingers and spoke \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Severus waved his wand, reversing whatever spell he had cast originally, \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure but he sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>Lyra closed her eyes, playing the voice over in her mind.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who\u2019d have a grudge against you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Lestrange,\u201d she smirked, \u201cI doubt that\u2019ll be the last Howler I receive.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>There was not a single student in sight as Lyra made her way down the corridors, heading in the direction of the Headmaster\u2019s Tower. When she arrived at the gargoyle that stood guard at its entrance Lyra said, \u201cAlbus, it\u2019s Lyra,\u201d and the gargoyle sprang to life. Lyra stepped onto the stairs as they made their appearance, gracefully following each step as it wound up it\u2019s shaft until it reached the office.</p><p>Once the stairs stopped moving Lyra confidently approached the Headmaster as he tended to his pet Phoenix. \u201cHello,\u201d she sung out.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lyra,\u201d he responded, \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinerva said you wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, of course,\u201d he said, setting the Phoenix down. \u201cHave a seat,\u201d he gestured to the empty space in front of his table and a chair appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Lyra took the seat and Albus took his behind his desk. \u201cWould you like anything to drink?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine thanks,\u201d she replied, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cHow have your classes been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, no problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lyra said, a skeptical look growing on her face, \u201cDid you invite me just for small talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Albus frowned, \u201cI did want to ask about something but I thought I\u2019d tried to segue into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay as well just ask,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the nature of your relationship with Severus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d she was shocked at the question.</p><p>\u201cYou and Severus have been spending an awful amount of time in the company of one another,\u201d he said, \u201cFlooing in and out of each other\u2019s rooms rather often and at odd hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends, sir,\u201d she answered attempting to sound innocent. Her mouth was becoming dry and she swallowed, wishing she had taken his offer of a drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been young and in love before, Lyra,\u201d he replied as he read Lyra\u2019s emotions with ease, \u201cNow I\u2019m not telling you that you can\u2019t be with Severus, that is entirely up to the two of you but I am warning you Lyra that the Dark Lord may not be as forgiving and neither would your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she frowned, looking away and focusing on the pensieve that stood behind him. She swallowed before speaking, \u201cSeverus is teaching me Occlumency which is why I\u2019ve been spending so much time with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and you enjoy his company,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Lyra felt the corner of her lip twinge, a smile threatening to take over her expression.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you here to speak of your relationship with Severus,\u201d he said, \u201cI actually asked you here to congratulate you on your discovery and to ask you whether you\u2019re ready to return to your healing career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, I believe that you have a talent for healing and you need to pursue it!\u201d he said with enthusiasm, \u201cYou were stuck in that office at St. Mungo\u2019s squandering your potential but I believe that the Psyrot case is proof for how talented you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve probably had a few offers already to work in Hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes I have, but the school year isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you find any offer appealing then you should take it,\u201d he encouraged.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know that the Defence Against the Arts position is cursed, I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and exhaled a small laugh, \u201cI\u2019m seeing it through, Albus. I don\u2019t want to be one of those teachers that just bail before the school year has ended and leave their students to drown. It\u2019s not fair on them. If I\u2019m as talented as you think I am then those offers can wait until the school year ends.\u201d</p><p>Albus smiled and nodded, \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Lyra and Severus spent another night together deep in the Dungeons, practicing Occlumency before falling into bed with one another. The next morning at breakfast, Lyra was greeted by a cold air of silence as the students flicked open their copies of The Daily Prophet to be faced with another article about their Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher.</p><p><i>LYRA LESTRANGE: MENDER OR MISCREANT?</i></p><p><i>Written by Rita Skeeter</i></p><p><i>Lyra Lestrange made headlines yesterday after she successfully discovered the cure for Psyrot, garnering the attention of not only the British Wizarding Community but Healers from all around the world. Before we give her too much credit, I would like to pose the questions; who really is Lyra Lestrange and can she be trusted?</i></p><p><i>If her name seems familiar to you it would be because her parents are none other than the convicted Death Eater couple, Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange who face a lifelong sentence in Azkaban for the torture of two Aurors. Ministry reports state that Lyra herself was directly involved in the incident, despite only being 11 years old at the time.</i></p><p><i>As her parents were in Azkaban, Lyra was raised by accused Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy. It seems that Lyra has not strayed too far away from her familiarity with Death Eaters as she was accompanied by Severus Snape, another accused Death Eater, during her visit to St. Mungo\u2019s over the weekend and even spotted at a local establishment with the man.</i></p><p><i>Lyra\u2019s connections with Death Eaters does not stop there, in fact she attended Durmstrang Institute - a school that greatly encourages the use of the Dark Arts - for the first four years of her schooling before she was expelled for an undisclosed reason. Personally, I question what act a thirteen year old could commit at a school that teaches Dark Arts that would result in her expulsion.</i></p><p><i>Apparently her use of the Dark Arts did not end there as a former classmate of Lyra\u2019s approached me and detailed what she got up to as a student at Hogwarts.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLyra was always running around with the wrong sort, practicing Dark Arts behind closed doors with the Slytherins,\u201d the young man described, \u201cI\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t get expelled again from Hogwarts when she almost killed another classmate when tormenting other students with her friends.\u201d</i></p><p><i>From her Death Eater connections to her flippant use of the Dark Arts, can Lyra Lestrange really be trusted as Healer or a teacher?</i></p><p>Each staff member turned to look at Lyra sympathetically as she walked over to her seat. She felt unnerved, every step made her more apprehensive. She noticed that most of the younger students were staring at her but averting their gaze as Lyra\u2019s eyes seemed to gloss over them. As she sat down she asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkeeter,\u201d Severus said simply, handing his copy of The Daily Prophet over to Lyra.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should read it,\u201d Minerva said.</p><p>Lyra took it and read it quickly, her face falling once she had finished it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take the day off,\u201d Minerva offered.</p><p>\u201cWhat good would that do?\u201d she asked, \u201cThey\u2019ll still be scared of me tomorrow. I thought The Prophet was a newspaper not a fucking gossip column.\u201d She slammed the paper down onto the table and stormed out.</p><p>~</p><p>Lyra tried to continue her classes as normal, pretending to be unfazed by the slanderous article and terrified children. It was only those who attended school at the same time as her that seemed to be unaffected. One of those students stuck around after classes to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cLyra?\u201d the pink haired student approached the desk where Lyra was sitting behind. The Professor responded by simply raising her eyebrows. \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t all believe that bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly accurate, Dora,\u201d she responded.</p><p>Tonks looked down before looking back up at her, \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t erase what you did, I mean you were just a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me. I just need to keep my head down and hopefully this whole thing will blow over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Dad said,\u201d Tonks commented, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher we\u2019ve had.\u201d</p><p>Lyra smiled, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just saying that cause you\u2019re my cousin or you\u2019re sad,\u201d she reaffirmed, \u201cI really mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Tonks nodded before taking her leave and heading out the door. Lyra\u2019s attention was drawn to upstairs as she heard the door to her office creak open. The billowy black robes gave her all the information she needed to know about the visitor.</p><p>\u201cCute little interaction there with your cousin,\u201d Severus said as he descended from the staircase. \u201cI took the liberty of filtering your mail for you.\u201d He dumped the letters on the table. \u201cMost are unnoteworthy. All your offers for work have been rescinded. You got a few more howlers, all of which exploded in my office. Then there were a few letters from concerned parents, mainly full of insults and such. Then there were these,\u201d he handed them directly to her, \u201cFrom your family and friends.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an endearing look, \u201cThanks, Sev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were your classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem free,\u201d she replied with a smile, \u201cMaybe being associated with Death Eaters isn\u2019t so bad, they were all so well behaved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t worry about Occlumency lessons tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the best time to? When I\u2019m all riled up with emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could take your mind off of it in another way,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s tongue darted out to wet her lips, she leaned back in her chair and smirked, \u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have letters to tend to,\u201d he said, turning to exit the room.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she laughed, discarding the letters and rushing to her feet. She grabbed a hold of his arm and tugged him back, pulling him away from his path and spinning him around. Lyra wrapped her arms around him and kissed him. \u201cThey can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, shaking her head slightly.</p><p>Severus reached for his wand and lazily flicked it at the classroom door, barring any unwanted visitors. His hands settled for her waist as he kissed her once more. He guided her backwards until they reached her desk, Lyra\u2019s bottom hitting the rim of it. She rested her weight back as she began to undo the buttons of his robes.</p><p>Severus, on the other hand, had not bothered with discarding her top. Instead, his hand slid under the blouse and groped her breast through her bra. The feeling of her soft and supple skin combined with the texture of the lace trim was delightful.</p><p>As Lyra pulled his overshirt away, she parted the kiss briefly and ran her hands over the crisp fabric of his white button. She undid the top two buttons and admired him for a second, \u201cMerlin, you are so sexy. You should dress like this everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would anyone be able to concentrate?\u201d he asked as he pinched her nipple hard.</p><p>She gave a small squeak and smiled at him before continuing his undressing. Severus decided to reciprocate the gesture, not appreciating the lack of access he had with her garments in the way. He was quicker than she was, Lyra choosing to take her time in undressing him whilst he was focused on just seeing her body.</p><p>Once her chest was revealed, Severus relished the feel of her breasts, excitedly leaning over her to kiss and play with them. Lyra\u2019s mission in disrobing the man was interrupted but she didn\u2019t mind, her head thrown back in pleasure from the stimulation as his tongue circled and flicked over the now hardened nubs, her hands gripping tightly onto the edge of her desk.</p><p>Severus pulled away her skirt next, his hand reaching to palm the heat that lay between her legs, hidden by the thin material of her underwear. Lyra ground back up into his hand, craving the friction. The wizard smirked at her neediness, relishing in the control he had over her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for her arousal to become more apparent, her juices soaking through her panties. Lyra was flushed with embarrassment and need as she felt her breath get caught in her throat. Severus was relishing in the teasing of her body, amused by the movement of her hips and the dampening of her knickers.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s hands were still clutching firmly onto the edge of the desk as Severus pulled her underwear away and discarded them onto the pile that had gathered on the floor. He dropped down onto his knees and moved her legs so they were over his shoulders before burying his face into her sex. Her scent was intoxicating and her arousal was sweet. He lapped at the nectar that wet the folds of her cunt and his tongue dipped into her hole as he craved more of the taste.</p><p>Once he had had his fill, his fingers replaced his tongue as it moved up to toy with her clitoris. A strangled moan escaped Lyra as he began to pump his fingers in and out of her. Severus watched her as she pinched her nipples, her eyes closed in bliss. Her body was beginning to unravel and she opened her eyes, looking down at him for a brief moment before squeezing them shut once more and coming hard.</p><p>Severus enjoyed the feeling of the walls of her pussy clamping down and pulsing around his fingers for a moment before sliding them out and sucking the juices that remained off of them. He smiled as he stood, Lyra\u2019s face a slight pink colour and her heart still racing. She leaned into him, holding his arms tightly.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned how amazing you are before?\u201d she asked, \u201cBecause you are mind blowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I appreciate it,\u201d he said with a small smile.</p><p>She looked up at him and smiled, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>",

Lyra was hunched over a bed, tending to an obviously ill patient, holding a vial near their face. The article read:</p><p><i>PSYROT PANDEMIC OVER!</i></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Written by Gustav Novak</i></p><p><i>Over the weekend patients at St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries had the privilege of receiving the recently discovered cure to Psyrot.</i></p><p><i>Psyrot is a disease that has been plaguing the witches and wizards of the United Kingdom over the past few months. It is a devastating illness that can ultimately result in death. Psyrot is easily treated by Pepper Up during the early stages but unfortunately there was no cure for those afflicted by the later stages of the disease, resulting in the death of three witches and two wizards.</i></p><p><i>However, the cure has recently been developed and discovered by Lyra Lestrange, aged 20, current Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts and ex-Trainee Healer at St. Mungo\u2019s, seen pictured above.</i></p><p><i>In conjunction with teaching at Hogwarts, Lyra has spent every spare moment dedicated to discovering the root cause of Psyrot as well as what could possibly be used to treat it after one of her students was revealed to be afflicted with disease.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was quite frightening really,\u201d Lyra recalls, \u201cThe boy had seized during dinner one night, obviously in the late stages of the disease. That\u2019s what prompted me into investigating the disease.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lyra is a modest witch, attributing her success to her colleagues.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHonestly, the witches and wizards that they get to work at Hogwarts really know their stuff. Silvanus Kettleburn, Professor of Care of Magical Creatures was the first I went to and he gave me such great insight into the workings of the parasite responsible. Then Professor Pomona Sprout directed me in all things Herbology and finally the Potions Master, Severus Snape, assisted me in creating the cure.\u201d</i></p><p><i>As a result of her discovery Lyra looks to possibly resuming her career in Healing and working towards curing other magical ailments. Look out for her report in this week\u2019s copy of Magical Inquiries and Discoveries.</i></p><p>Lyra herself graced the hall with her presence soon after the arrival of the post. She entered the room via the door behind the High Table, followed closely behind by Severus. They had attempted to stagger their appearance but still managed to catch up with one another on the way there.</p><p>As Lyra stepped up on to the stage she was oblivious to the fact that the students were taken by her appearance, distracted by the few owls that bore letters surrounding her plate. With a confused look on her face, she took her seat but before she could begin to consider the letters in front of her the Transfiguration Professor addressed her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lyra,\u201d she said, \u201cWe\u2019re all so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Lyra glanced down the table and noticed that most of her colleagues were smiling at her. \u201cSorry what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsyrot?\u201d Minerva said, thrusting her own copy of the prophet to Lyra.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh,\u201d she replied, noticing the image of herself on the front paper. \u201cRight, yes, Psyrot. Thanks. That explains the letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFans, no doubt,\u201d Minerva said, \u201cIt\u2019s all very exciting but I\u2019m disappointed to find out that you\u2019re planning on resigning at the end of the year through a newspaper article.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>Minerva pulled the paper back and began to read from the article, \u201c Lyra looks to possibly resuming her career in healing and working towards curing other magical ailments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I did mention that to Gus,\u201d Lyra replied sheepishly, \u201cDidn\u2019t know he\u2019d use that in the article but he twisted my words slightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Albus would like to speak to you about this whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your breakfast,\u201d Minerva said as she left.</p><p>Lyra turned to The Potions Master sat next to her and asked, \u201cIs she mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly, he replied, his head tilting to one side.</p><p>Lyra reached to pluck a letter off of the foot of one of the owls but it began to peck at her fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably hungry,\u201d Severus pointed out.</p><p>Lyra grumbled as she pulled out her wand, summoning some food for both herself and her feathery friends. The owls began to feast, allowing Lyra to pull the letters off. She read them as she ate, tuning out \u00a0her surroundings. The first one she read was plucked off of her own owl, Silver. She expected it to be a response from her cousin but was surprised when she pulled it out.</p><p><i>Lyra,</i></p><p><i>Congratulations on your discovery. Cissy and I were surprised to see you in the paper this morning but nonetheless, we are proud of what you have achieved. Draco has already cut out the article and stuck it to the wall of his bedroom.</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ve had a few friends already reach out to me, asking whether I could put them in touch with you. They would be delighted to work with a bright witch such as yourself, particularly as rumour has it you may be awarded an Order of Merlin for your work. It would be nice if you resumed your healing career and returned home, Draco misses you dearly and of course so do Cissy and I.</i></p><p><i>Do come by when you can, I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you.</i></p><p><i>From your Uncle Lucius</i></p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes narrowed as she reread the second paragraph, her eyes caught on the words \u2018 <i>Order of Merlin</i> \u2019.</p><p>An Order of Merlin.</p><p>Lyra Lestrange, Order of Merlin First Class. Or Second or Third.</p><p>That had a ring to it.</p><p>That would completely reinvent herself and her name, it would remove the taint of her parents from the Lestrange name and allow her to be her own person.</p><p>She stopped herself, not allowing her thoughts to run too rampant. Surely it was just a joke, a trick Lucius was playing to try and sway her away from the teaching position at Hogwarts and instead return to a Healing career. But, if she did have an OM, maybe Narcissa would finally stop nagging her about getting married and she could pursue Healing to a whole other level.</p><p>Lyra was pulled from her fantasies as she felt the paper get tugged away from her hands. Her head turned quickly towards the culprit and she saw Severus\u2019 eyes glossing over the paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat if that was private?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201c Order of Merlin ,\u201d he read slowly, his narrowed at the paper. Severus folded it before handing it back with a questioning look.</p><p>His face said it all to Lyra. It probably wasn\u2019t a genuine nomination, Lucius was awfully close with the Minister of Magic. Lyra was sure that Lucius himself would have nominated her, if not paid the Ministry off to do so. There\u2019d be something in it for Lucius too, no doubt a story he could spin to increase the prestige of the Malfoy name.</p><p>Silently she took the parchment, placing it on the table before breaking open the other letters. Each of those letters were from witches and wizards with rather high positions in well established Hospitals, similar to St. Mungo\u2019s, congratulating her on her discovery and offering her either apprenticeships or employment within their Hospital\u2019s research division. Lyra didn\u2019t know how to feel, she was overwhelmed by the response and felt happy but Hogwarts had quickly become her home. She was hesitant to leave, particularly now that she felt comfortable with Severus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you wanted isn\u2019t it?\u201d he commented.</p><p>Lyra looked to him, feeling uncertain of what to say. She should\u2019ve been proud and excited, she could feel her heart sing from the recognition but her head was weighing her down, questioning what she was going to do next.</p><p>There was a swoop of wind heard above and a red enveloped dropped in front of her. Severus pulled his wand out and muttered an incantation before prompting Lyra to open it. As she did the envelope slipped between her fingers and spoke \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Severus waved his wand, reversing whatever spell he had cast originally, \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure but he sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>Lyra closed her eyes, playing the voice over in her mind.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who\u2019d have a grudge against you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Lestrange,\u201d she smirked, \u201cI doubt that\u2019ll be the last Howler I receive.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>There was not a single student in sight as Lyra made her way down the corridors, heading in the direction of the Headmaster\u2019s Tower. When she arrived at the gargoyle that stood guard at its entrance Lyra said, \u201cAlbus, it\u2019s Lyra,\u201d and the gargoyle sprang to life. Lyra stepped onto the stairs as they made their appearance, gracefully following each step as it wound up it\u2019s shaft until it reached the office.</p><p>Once the stairs stopped moving Lyra confidently approached the Headmaster as he tended to his pet Phoenix. \u201cHello,\u201d she sung out.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lyra,\u201d he responded, \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinerva said you wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, of course,\u201d he said, setting the Phoenix down. \u201cHave a seat,\u201d he gestured to the empty space in front of his table and a chair appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Lyra took the seat and Albus took his behind his desk. \u201cWould you like anything to drink?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine thanks,\u201d she replied, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cHow have your classes been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, no problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lyra said, a skeptical look growing on her face, \u201cDid you invite me just for small talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Albus frowned, \u201cI did want to ask about something but I thought I\u2019d tried to segue into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay as well just ask,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the nature of your relationship with Severus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d she was shocked at the question.</p><p>\u201cYou and Severus have been spending an awful amount of time in the company of one another,\u201d he said, \u201cFlooing in and out of each other\u2019s rooms rather often and at odd hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends, sir,\u201d she answered attempting to sound innocent. Her mouth was becoming dry and she swallowed, wishing she had taken his offer of a drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been young and in love before, Lyra,\u201d he replied as he read Lyra\u2019s emotions with ease, \u201cNow I\u2019m not telling you that you can\u2019t be with Severus, that is entirely up to the two of you but I am warning you Lyra that the Dark Lord may not be as forgiving and neither would your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she frowned, looking away and focusing on the pensieve that stood behind him. She swallowed before speaking, \u201cSeverus is teaching me Occlumency which is why I\u2019ve been spending so much time with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and you enjoy his company,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Lyra felt the corner of her lip twinge, a smile threatening to take over her expression.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you here to speak of your relationship with Severus,\u201d he said, \u201cI actually asked you here to congratulate you on your discovery and to ask you whether you\u2019re ready to return to your healing career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, I believe that you have a talent for healing and you need to pursue it!\u201d he said with enthusiasm, \u201cYou were stuck in that office at St. Mungo\u2019s squandering your potential but I believe that the Psyrot case is proof for how talented you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve probably had a few offers already to work in Hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes I have, but the school year isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you find any offer appealing then you should take it,\u201d he encouraged.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know that the Defence Against the Arts position is cursed, I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and exhaled a small laugh, \u201cI\u2019m seeing it through, Albus. I don\u2019t want to be one of those teachers that just bail before the school year has ended and leave their students to drown. It\u2019s not fair on them. If I\u2019m as talented as you think I am then those offers can wait until the school year ends.\u201d</p><p>Albus smiled and nodded, \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Lyra and Severus spent another night together deep in the Dungeons, practicing Occlumency before falling into bed with one another. The next morning at breakfast, Lyra was greeted by a cold air of silence as the students flicked open their copies of The Daily Prophet to be faced with another article about their Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher.</p><p><i>LYRA LESTRANGE: MENDER OR MISCREANT?</i></p><p><i>Written by Rita Skeeter</i></p><p><i>Lyra Lestrange made headlines yesterday after she successfully discovered the cure for Psyrot, garnering the attention of not only the British Wizarding Community but Healers from all around the world. Before we give her too much credit, I would like to pose the questions; who really is Lyra Lestrange and can she be trusted?</i></p><p><i>If her name seems familiar to you it would be because her parents are none other than the convicted Death Eater couple, Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange who face a lifelong sentence in Azkaban for the torture of two Aurors. Ministry reports state that Lyra herself was directly involved in the incident, despite only being 11 years old at the time.</i></p><p><i>As her parents were in Azkaban, Lyra was raised by accused Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy. It seems that Lyra has not strayed too far away from her familiarity with Death Eaters as she was accompanied by Severus Snape, another accused Death Eater, during her visit to St. Mungo\u2019s over the weekend and even spotted at a local establishment with the man.</i></p><p><i>Lyra\u2019s connections with Death Eaters does not stop there, in fact she attended Durmstrang Institute - a school that greatly encourages the use of the Dark Arts - for the first four years of her schooling before she was expelled for an undisclosed reason. Personally, I question what act a thirteen year old could commit at a school that teaches Dark Arts that would result in her expulsion.</i></p><p><i>Apparently her use of the Dark Arts did not end there as a former classmate of Lyra\u2019s approached me and detailed what she got up to as a student at Hogwarts.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLyra was always running around with the wrong sort, practicing Dark Arts behind closed doors with the Slytherins,\u201d the young man described, \u201cI\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t get expelled again from Hogwarts when she almost killed another classmate when tormenting other students with her friends.\u201d</i></p><p><i>From her Death Eater connections to her flippant use of the Dark Arts, can Lyra Lestrange really be trusted as Healer or a teacher?</i></p><p>Each staff member turned to look at Lyra sympathetically as she walked over to her seat. She felt unnerved, every step made her more apprehensive. She noticed that most of the younger students were staring at her but averting their gaze as Lyra\u2019s eyes seemed to gloss over them. As she sat down she asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkeeter,\u201d Severus said simply, handing his copy of The Daily Prophet over to Lyra.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should read it,\u201d Minerva said.</p><p>Lyra took it and read it quickly, her face falling once she had finished it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take the day off,\u201d Minerva offered.</p><p>\u201cWhat good would that do?\u201d she asked, \u201cThey\u2019ll still be scared of me tomorrow. I thought The Prophet was a newspaper not a fucking gossip column.\u201d She slammed the paper down onto the table and stormed out.</p><p>~</p><p>Lyra tried to continue her classes as normal, pretending to be unfazed by the slanderous article and terrified children. It was only those who attended school at the same time as her that seemed to be unaffected. One of those students stuck around after classes to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cLyra?\u201d the pink haired student approached the desk where Lyra was sitting behind. The Professor responded by simply raising her eyebrows. \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t all believe that bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly accurate, Dora,\u201d she responded.</p><p>Tonks looked down before looking back up at her, \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t erase what you did, I mean you were just a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me. I just need to keep my head down and hopefully this whole thing will blow over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Dad said,\u201d Tonks commented, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher we\u2019ve had.\u201d</p><p>Lyra smiled, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just saying that cause you\u2019re my cousin or you\u2019re sad,\u201d she reaffirmed, \u201cI really mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Tonks nodded before taking her leave and heading out the door. Lyra\u2019s attention was drawn to upstairs as she heard the door to her office creak open. The billowy black robes gave her all the information she needed to know about the visitor.</p><p>\u201cCute little interaction there with your cousin,\u201d Severus said as he descended from the staircase. \u201cI took the liberty of filtering your mail for you.\u201d He dumped the letters on the table. \u201cMost are unnoteworthy. All your offers for work have been rescinded. You got a few more howlers, all of which exploded in my office. Then there were a few letters from concerned parents, mainly full of insults and such. Then there were these,\u201d he handed them directly to her, \u201cFrom your family and friends.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an endearing look, \u201cThanks, Sev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were your classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem free,\u201d she replied with a smile, \u201cMaybe being associated with Death Eaters isn\u2019t so bad, they were all so well behaved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t worry about Occlumency lessons tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the best time to? When I\u2019m all riled up with emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could take your mind off of it in another way,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s tongue darted out to wet her lips, she leaned back in her chair and smirked, \u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have letters to tend to,\u201d he said, turning to exit the room.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she laughed, discarding the letters and rushing to her feet. She grabbed a hold of his arm and tugged him back, pulling him away from his path and spinning him around. Lyra wrapped her arms around him and kissed him. \u201cThey can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, shaking her head slightly.</p><p>Severus reached for his wand and lazily flicked it at the classroom door, barring any unwanted visitors. His hands settled for her waist as he kissed her once more. He guided her backwards until they reached her desk, Lyra\u2019s bottom hitting the rim of it. She rested her weight back as she began to undo the buttons of his robes.</p><p>Severus, on the other hand, had not bothered with discarding her top. Instead, his hand slid under the blouse and groped her breast through her bra. The feeling of her soft and supple skin combined with the texture of the lace trim was delightful.</p><p>As Lyra pulled his overshirt away, she parted the kiss briefly and ran her hands over the crisp fabric of his white button. She undid the top two buttons and admired him for a second, \u201cMerlin, you are so sexy. You should dress like this everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would anyone be able to concentrate?\u201d he asked as he pinched her nipple hard.</p><p>She gave a small squeak and smiled at him before continuing his undressing. Severus decided to reciprocate the gesture, not appreciating the lack of access he had with her garments in the way. He was quicker than she was, Lyra choosing to take her time in undressing him whilst he was focused on just seeing her body.</p><p>Once her chest was revealed, Severus relished the feel of her breasts, excitedly leaning over her to kiss and play with them. Lyra\u2019s mission in disrobing the man was interrupted but she didn\u2019t mind, her head thrown back in pleasure from the stimulation as his tongue circled and flicked over the now hardened nubs, her hands gripping tightly onto the edge of her desk.</p><p>Severus pulled away her skirt next, his hand reaching to palm the heat that lay between her legs, hidden by the thin material of her underwear. Lyra ground back up into his hand, craving the friction. The wizard smirked at her neediness, relishing in the control he had over her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for her arousal to become more apparent, her juices soaking through her panties. Lyra was flushed with embarrassment and need as she felt her breath get caught in her throat. Severus was relishing in the teasing of her body, amused by the movement of her hips and the dampening of her knickers.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s hands were still clutching firmly onto the edge of the desk as Severus pulled her underwear away and discarded them onto the pile that had gathered on the floor. He dropped down onto his knees and moved her legs so they were over his shoulders before burying his face into her sex. Her scent was intoxicating and her arousal was sweet. He lapped at the nectar that wet the folds of her cunt and his tongue dipped into her hole as he craved more of the taste.</p><p>Once he had had his fill, his fingers replaced his tongue as it moved up to toy with her clitoris. A strangled moan escaped Lyra as he began to pump his fingers in and out of her. Severus watched her as she pinched her nipples, her eyes closed in bliss. Her body was beginning to unravel and she opened her eyes, looking down at him for a brief moment before squeezing them shut once more and coming hard.</p><p>Severus enjoyed the feeling of the walls of her pussy clamping down and pulsing around his fingers for a moment before sliding them out and sucking the juices that remained off of them. He smiled as he stood, Lyra\u2019s face a slight pink colour and her heart still racing. She leaned into him, holding his arms tightly.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned how amazing you are before?\u201d she asked, \u201cBecause you are mind blowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I appreciate it,\u201d he said with a small smile.</p><p>She looked up at him and smiled, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>",

A sense of awe filled the room as the children opened their mail and noticed that plastered on the front page of The Daily Prophet was their Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. Lyra was hunched over a bed, tending to an obviously ill patient, holding a vial near their face. The article read:</p><p><i>PSYROT PANDEMIC OVER!</i></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Written by Gustav Novak</i></p><p><i>Over the weekend patients at St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries had the privilege of receiving the recently discovered cure to Psyrot.</i></p><p><i>Psyrot is a disease that has been plaguing the witches and wizards of the United Kingdom over the past few months. It is a devastating illness that can ultimately result in death. Psyrot is easily treated by Pepper Up during the early stages but unfortunately there was no cure for those afflicted by the later stages of the disease, resulting in the death of three witches and two wizards.</i></p><p><i>However, the cure has recently been developed and discovered by Lyra Lestrange, aged 20, current Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts and ex-Trainee Healer at St. Mungo\u2019s, seen pictured above.</i></p><p><i>In conjunction with teaching at Hogwarts, Lyra has spent every spare moment dedicated to discovering the root cause of Psyrot as well as what could possibly be used to treat it after one of her students was revealed to be afflicted with disease.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was quite frightening really,\u201d Lyra recalls, \u201cThe boy had seized during dinner one night, obviously in the late stages of the disease. That\u2019s what prompted me into investigating the disease.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lyra is a modest witch, attributing her success to her colleagues.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHonestly, the witches and wizards that they get to work at Hogwarts really know their stuff. Silvanus Kettleburn, Professor of Care of Magical Creatures was the first I went to and he gave me such great insight into the workings of the parasite responsible. Then Professor Pomona Sprout directed me in all things Herbology and finally the Potions Master, Severus Snape, assisted me in creating the cure.\u201d</i></p><p><i>As a result of her discovery Lyra looks to possibly resuming her career in Healing and working towards curing other magical ailments. Look out for her report in this week\u2019s copy of Magical Inquiries and Discoveries.</i></p><p>Lyra herself graced the hall with her presence soon after the arrival of the post. She entered the room via the door behind the High Table, followed closely behind by Severus. They had attempted to stagger their appearance but still managed to catch up with one another on the way there.</p><p>As Lyra stepped up on to the stage she was oblivious to the fact that the students were taken by her appearance, distracted by the few owls that bore letters surrounding her plate. With a confused look on her face, she took her seat but before she could begin to consider the letters in front of her the Transfiguration Professor addressed her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lyra,\u201d she said, \u201cWe\u2019re all so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Lyra glanced down the table and noticed that most of her colleagues were smiling at her. \u201cSorry what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsyrot?\u201d Minerva said, thrusting her own copy of the prophet to Lyra.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh,\u201d she replied, noticing the image of herself on the front paper. \u201cRight, yes, Psyrot. Thanks. That explains the letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFans, no doubt,\u201d Minerva said, \u201cIt\u2019s all very exciting but I\u2019m disappointed to find out that you\u2019re planning on resigning at the end of the year through a newspaper article.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>Minerva pulled the paper back and began to read from the article, \u201c Lyra looks to possibly resuming her career in healing and working towards curing other magical ailments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I did mention that to Gus,\u201d Lyra replied sheepishly, \u201cDidn\u2019t know he\u2019d use that in the article but he twisted my words slightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Albus would like to speak to you about this whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your breakfast,\u201d Minerva said as she left.</p><p>Lyra turned to The Potions Master sat next to her and asked, \u201cIs she mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly, he replied, his head tilting to one side.</p><p>Lyra reached to pluck a letter off of the foot of one of the owls but it began to peck at her fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably hungry,\u201d Severus pointed out.</p><p>Lyra grumbled as she pulled out her wand, summoning some food for both herself and her feathery friends. The owls began to feast, allowing Lyra to pull the letters off. She read them as she ate, tuning out \u00a0her surroundings. The first one she read was plucked off of her own owl, Silver. She expected it to be a response from her cousin but was surprised when she pulled it out.</p><p><i>Lyra,</i></p><p><i>Congratulations on your discovery. Cissy and I were surprised to see you in the paper this morning but nonetheless, we are proud of what you have achieved. Draco has already cut out the article and stuck it to the wall of his bedroom.</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ve had a few friends already reach out to me, asking whether I could put them in touch with you. They would be delighted to work with a bright witch such as yourself, particularly as rumour has it you may be awarded an Order of Merlin for your work. It would be nice if you resumed your healing career and returned home, Draco misses you dearly and of course so do Cissy and I.</i></p><p><i>Do come by when you can, I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you.</i></p><p><i>From your Uncle Lucius</i></p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes narrowed as she reread the second paragraph, her eyes caught on the words \u2018 <i>Order of Merlin</i> \u2019.</p><p>An Order of Merlin.</p><p>Lyra Lestrange, Order of Merlin First Class. Or Second or Third.</p><p>That had a ring to it.</p><p>That would completely reinvent herself and her name, it would remove the taint of her parents from the Lestrange name and allow her to be her own person.</p><p>She stopped herself, not allowing her thoughts to run too rampant. Surely it was just a joke, a trick Lucius was playing to try and sway her away from the teaching position at Hogwarts and instead return to a Healing career. But, if she did have an OM, maybe Narcissa would finally stop nagging her about getting married and she could pursue Healing to a whole other level.</p><p>Lyra was pulled from her fantasies as she felt the paper get tugged away from her hands. Her head turned quickly towards the culprit and she saw Severus\u2019 eyes glossing over the paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat if that was private?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201c Order of Merlin ,\u201d he read slowly, his narrowed at the paper. Severus folded it before handing it back with a questioning look.</p><p>His face said it all to Lyra. It probably wasn\u2019t a genuine nomination, Lucius was awfully close with the Minister of Magic. Lyra was sure that Lucius himself would have nominated her, if not paid the Ministry off to do so. There\u2019d be something in it for Lucius too, no doubt a story he could spin to increase the prestige of the Malfoy name.</p><p>Silently she took the parchment, placing it on the table before breaking open the other letters. Each of those letters were from witches and wizards with rather high positions in well established Hospitals, similar to St. Mungo\u2019s, congratulating her on her discovery and offering her either apprenticeships or employment within their Hospital\u2019s research division. Lyra didn\u2019t know how to feel, she was overwhelmed by the response and felt happy but Hogwarts had quickly become her home. She was hesitant to leave, particularly now that she felt comfortable with Severus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you wanted isn\u2019t it?\u201d he commented.</p><p>Lyra looked to him, feeling uncertain of what to say. She should\u2019ve been proud and excited, she could feel her heart sing from the recognition but her head was weighing her down, questioning what she was going to do next.</p><p>There was a swoop of wind heard above and a red enveloped dropped in front of her. Severus pulled his wand out and muttered an incantation before prompting Lyra to open it. As she did the envelope slipped between her fingers and spoke \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Severus waved his wand, reversing whatever spell he had cast originally, \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure but he sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>Lyra closed her eyes, playing the voice over in her mind.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who\u2019d have a grudge against you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Lestrange,\u201d she smirked, \u201cI doubt that\u2019ll be the last Howler I receive.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>There was not a single student in sight as Lyra made her way down the corridors, heading in the direction of the Headmaster\u2019s Tower. When she arrived at the gargoyle that stood guard at its entrance Lyra said, \u201cAlbus, it\u2019s Lyra,\u201d and the gargoyle sprang to life. Lyra stepped onto the stairs as they made their appearance, gracefully following each step as it wound up it\u2019s shaft until it reached the office.</p><p>Once the stairs stopped moving Lyra confidently approached the Headmaster as he tended to his pet Phoenix. \u201cHello,\u201d she sung out.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lyra,\u201d he responded, \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinerva said you wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, of course,\u201d he said, setting the Phoenix down. \u201cHave a seat,\u201d he gestured to the empty space in front of his table and a chair appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Lyra took the seat and Albus took his behind his desk. \u201cWould you like anything to drink?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine thanks,\u201d she replied, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cHow have your classes been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, no problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lyra said, a skeptical look growing on her face, \u201cDid you invite me just for small talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Albus frowned, \u201cI did want to ask about something but I thought I\u2019d tried to segue into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay as well just ask,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the nature of your relationship with Severus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d she was shocked at the question.</p><p>\u201cYou and Severus have been spending an awful amount of time in the company of one another,\u201d he said, \u201cFlooing in and out of each other\u2019s rooms rather often and at odd hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends, sir,\u201d she answered attempting to sound innocent. Her mouth was becoming dry and she swallowed, wishing she had taken his offer of a drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been young and in love before, Lyra,\u201d he replied as he read Lyra\u2019s emotions with ease, \u201cNow I\u2019m not telling you that you can\u2019t be with Severus, that is entirely up to the two of you but I am warning you Lyra that the Dark Lord may not be as forgiving and neither would your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she frowned, looking away and focusing on the pensieve that stood behind him. She swallowed before speaking, \u201cSeverus is teaching me Occlumency which is why I\u2019ve been spending so much time with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and you enjoy his company,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Lyra felt the corner of her lip twinge, a smile threatening to take over her expression.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you here to speak of your relationship with Severus,\u201d he said, \u201cI actually asked you here to congratulate you on your discovery and to ask you whether you\u2019re ready to return to your healing career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, I believe that you have a talent for healing and you need to pursue it!\u201d he said with enthusiasm, \u201cYou were stuck in that office at St. Mungo\u2019s squandering your potential but I believe that the Psyrot case is proof for how talented you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve probably had a few offers already to work in Hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes I have, but the school year isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you find any offer appealing then you should take it,\u201d he encouraged.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know that the Defence Against the Arts position is cursed, I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and exhaled a small laugh, \u201cI\u2019m seeing it through, Albus. I don\u2019t want to be one of those teachers that just bail before the school year has ended and leave their students to drown. It\u2019s not fair on them. If I\u2019m as talented as you think I am then those offers can wait until the school year ends.\u201d</p><p>Albus smiled and nodded, \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Lyra and Severus spent another night together deep in the Dungeons, practicing Occlumency before falling into bed with one another. The next morning at breakfast, Lyra was greeted by a cold air of silence as the students flicked open their copies of The Daily Prophet to be faced with another article about their Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher.</p><p><i>LYRA LESTRANGE: MENDER OR MISCREANT?</i></p><p><i>Written by Rita Skeeter</i></p><p><i>Lyra Lestrange made headlines yesterday after she successfully discovered the cure for Psyrot, garnering the attention of not only the British Wizarding Community but Healers from all around the world. Before we give her too much credit, I would like to pose the questions; who really is Lyra Lestrange and can she be trusted?</i></p><p><i>If her name seems familiar to you it would be because her parents are none other than the convicted Death Eater couple, Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange who face a lifelong sentence in Azkaban for the torture of two Aurors. Ministry reports state that Lyra herself was directly involved in the incident, despite only being 11 years old at the time.</i></p><p><i>As her parents were in Azkaban, Lyra was raised by accused Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy. It seems that Lyra has not strayed too far away from her familiarity with Death Eaters as she was accompanied by Severus Snape, another accused Death Eater, during her visit to St. Mungo\u2019s over the weekend and even spotted at a local establishment with the man.</i></p><p><i>Lyra\u2019s connections with Death Eaters does not stop there, in fact she attended Durmstrang Institute - a school that greatly encourages the use of the Dark Arts - for the first four years of her schooling before she was expelled for an undisclosed reason.

She felt unnerved, every step made her more apprehensive. She noticed that most of the younger students were staring at her but averting their gaze as Lyra\u2019s eyes seemed to gloss over them. As she sat down she asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkeeter,\u201d Severus said simply, handing his copy of The Daily Prophet over to Lyra.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should read it,\u201d Minerva said.</p><p>Lyra took it and read it quickly, her face falling once she had finished it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take the day off,\u201d Minerva offered.</p><p>\u201cWhat good would that do?\u201d she asked, \u201cThey\u2019ll still be scared of me tomorrow. I thought The Prophet was a newspaper not a fucking gossip column.\u201d She slammed the paper down onto the table and stormed out.</p><p>~</p><p>Lyra tried to continue her classes as normal, pretending to be unfazed by the slanderous article and terrified children. It was only those who attended school at the same time as her that seemed to be unaffected. One of those students stuck around after classes to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cLyra?\u201d the pink haired student approached the desk where Lyra was sitting behind. The Professor responded by simply raising her eyebrows. \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t all believe that bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly accurate, Dora,\u201d she responded.</p><p>Tonks looked down before looking back up at her, \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t erase what you did, I mean you were just a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me. I just need to keep my head down and hopefully this whole thing will blow over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Dad said,\u201d Tonks commented, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher we\u2019ve had.\u201d</p><p>Lyra smiled, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just saying that cause you\u2019re my cousin or you\u2019re sad,\u201d she reaffirmed, \u201cI really mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Tonks nodded before taking her leave and heading out the door. Lyra\u2019s attention was drawn to upstairs as she heard the door to her office creak open. The billowy black robes gave her all the information she needed to know about the visitor.</p><p>\u201cCute little interaction there with your cousin,\u201d Severus said as he descended from the staircase. \u201cI took the liberty of filtering your mail for you.\u201d He dumped the letters on the table. \u201cMost are unnoteworthy. All your offers for work have been rescinded. You got a few more howlers, all of which exploded in my office. Then there were a few letters from concerned parents, mainly full of insults and such. Then there were these,\u201d he handed them directly to her, \u201cFrom your family and friends.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an endearing look, \u201cThanks, Sev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were your classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem free,\u201d she replied with a smile, \u201cMaybe being associated with Death Eaters isn\u2019t so bad, they were all so well behaved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t worry about Occlumency lessons tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the best time to? When I\u2019m all riled up with emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could take your mind off of it in another way,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s tongue darted out to wet her lips, she leaned back in her chair and smirked, \u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have letters to tend to,\u201d he said, turning to exit the room.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she laughed, discarding the letters and rushing to her feet. She grabbed a hold of his arm and tugged him back, pulling him away from his path and spinning him around. Lyra wrapped her arms around him and kissed him. \u201cThey can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, shaking her head slightly.</p><p>Severus reached for his wand and lazily flicked it at the classroom door, barring any unwanted visitors. His hands settled for her waist as he kissed her once more. He guided her backwards until they reached her desk, Lyra\u2019s bottom hitting the rim of it. She rested her weight back as she began to undo the buttons of his robes.</p><p>Severus, on the other hand, had not bothered with discarding her top. Instead, his hand slid under the blouse and groped her breast through her bra. The feeling of her soft and supple skin combined with the texture of the lace trim was delightful.</p><p>As Lyra pulled his overshirt away, she parted the kiss briefly and ran her hands over the crisp fabric of his white button. She undid the top two buttons and admired him for a second, \u201cMerlin, you are so sexy. You should dress like this everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would anyone be able to concentrate?\u201d he asked as he pinched her nipple hard.</p><p>She gave a small squeak and smiled at him before continuing his undressing. Severus decided to reciprocate the gesture, not appreciating the lack of access he had with her garments in the way. He was quicker than she was, Lyra choosing to take her time in undressing him whilst he was focused on just seeing her body.</p><p>Once her chest was revealed, Severus relished the feel of her breasts, excitedly leaning over her to kiss and play with them. Lyra\u2019s mission in disrobing the man was interrupted but she didn\u2019t mind, her head thrown back in pleasure from the stimulation as his tongue circled and flicked over the now hardened nubs, her hands gripping tightly onto the edge of her desk.</p><p>Severus pulled away her skirt next, his hand reaching to palm the heat that lay between her legs, hidden by the thin material of her underwear. Lyra ground back up into his hand, craving the friction. The wizard smirked at her neediness, relishing in the control he had over her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for her arousal to become more apparent, her juices soaking through her panties. Lyra was flushed with embarrassment and need as she felt her breath get caught in her throat. Severus was relishing in the teasing of her body, amused by the movement of her hips and the dampening of her knickers.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s hands were still clutching firmly onto the edge of the desk as Severus pulled her underwear away and discarded them onto the pile that had gathered on the floor. He dropped down onto his knees and moved her legs so they were over his shoulders before burying his face into her sex. Her scent was intoxicating and her arousal was sweet. He lapped at the nectar that wet the folds of her cunt and his tongue dipped into her hole as he craved more of the taste.</p><p>Once he had had his fill, his fingers replaced his tongue as it moved up to toy with her clitoris. A strangled moan escaped Lyra as he began to pump his fingers in and out of her. Severus watched her as she pinched her nipples, her eyes closed in bliss. Her body was beginning to unravel and she opened her eyes, looking down at him for a brief moment before squeezing them shut once more and coming hard.</p><p>Severus enjoyed the feeling of the walls of her pussy clamping down and pulsing around his fingers for a moment before sliding them out and sucking the juices that remained off of them. He smiled as he stood, Lyra\u2019s face a slight pink colour and her heart still racing. She leaned into him, holding his arms tightly.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned how amazing you are before?\u201d she asked, \u201cBecause you are mind blowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I appreciate it,\u201d he said with a small smile.</p><p>She looked up at him and smiled, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>",

When Lyra Lestrange&rsquo;s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves. Who knew that being a Hogwarts Professor was such a rollercoaster?</i></p><p><i>Set in the school year of 1990-1991 with the prospect of a sequel, or two, on the horizon.</i></p><p><i><i>Rated:&nbsp;E for graphic sex scenes in THIS and later chapters. Over 18&prime;s only please.</i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><b>Word Count: </b>3749</i></p><p><i>Multichapter Fic (Expected to be around 30-35 chapters with a planned sequel which will take place during the Harry Potter Books)</i></p><p><b>Chapter Twenty One &ndash; The Daily Prophet</b></p><p>The Great Hall was bustling full of noise on Tuesday morning as the daily post arrived. A sense of awe filled the room as the children opened their mail and noticed that plastered on the front page of The Daily Prophet was their Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. Lyra was hunched over a bed, tending to an obviously ill patient, holding a vial near their face. The article read:</p><p><i>PSYROT PANDEMIC OVER!</i></p><p><i>Written by Gustav Novak</i></p><p><i>Over the weekend patients at St. Mungo&rsquo;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries had the privilege of receiving the recently discovered cure to Psyrot.</i></p><p><i>Psyrot is a disease that has been plaguing the witches and wizards of the United Kingdom over the past few months. It is a devastating illness that can ultimately result in death. Psyrot is easily treated by Pepper Up during the early stages but unfortunately there was no cure for those afflicted by the later stages of the disease, resulting in the death of three witches and two wizards.</i></p><p><i>However, the cure has recently been developed and discovered by Lyra Lestrange, aged 20, current Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts and ex-Trainee Healer at St. Mungo&rsquo;s, seen pictured above.</i></p><p><i>In conjunction with teaching at Hogwarts, Lyra has spent every spare moment dedicated to discovering the root cause of Psyrot as well as what could possibly be used to treat it after one of her students was revealed to be afflicted with disease.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It was quite frightening really,&rdquo; Lyra recalls, &ldquo;The boy had seized during dinner one night, obviously in the late stages of the disease. That&rsquo;s what prompted me into investigating the disease.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Lyra is a modest witch, attributing her success to her colleagues.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Honestly, the witches and wizards that they get to work at Hogwarts really know their stuff. Silvanus Kettleburn, Professor of Care of Magical Creatures was the first I went to and he gave me such great insight into the workings of the parasite responsible. Then Professor Pomona Sprout directed me in all things Herbology and finally the Potions Master, Severus Snape, assisted me in creating the cure.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>As a result of her discovery Lyra looks to possibly resuming her career in Healing and working towards curing other magical ailments. Look out for her report in this week&rsquo;s copy of Magical Inquiries and Discoveries.</i></p><p>Lyra herself graced the hall with her presence soon after the arrival of the post. She entered the room via the door behind the High Table, followed closely behind by Severus. They had attempted to stagger their appearance but still managed to catch up with one another on the way there.</p><p>As Lyra stepped up on to the stage she was oblivious to the fact that the students were taken by her appearance, distracted by the few owls that bore letters surrounding her plate. With a confused look on her face, she took her seat but before she could begin to consider the letters in front of her the Transfiguration Professor addressed her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Lyra,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all so proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra glanced down the table and noticed that most of her colleagues were smiling at her. &ldquo;Sorry what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Psyrot?&rdquo; Minerva said, thrusting her own copy of the prophet to Lyra.</p><p>&ldquo;Ohhhh,&rdquo; she replied, noticing the image of herself on the front paper. &ldquo;Right, yes, Psyrot. Thanks. That explains the letters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fans, no doubt,&rdquo; Minerva said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very exciting but I&rsquo;m disappointed to find out that you&rsquo;re planning on resigning at the end of the year through a newspaper article.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am?&rdquo;</p><p>Minerva pulled the paper back and began to read from the article, &ldquo; Lyra looks to possibly resuming her career in healing and working towards curing other magical ailments.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah yes, I did mention that to Gus,&rdquo; Lyra replied sheepishly, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;d use that in the article but he twisted my words slightly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Albus would like to speak to you about this whole thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enjoy your breakfast,&rdquo; Minerva said as she left.</p><p>Lyra turned to The Potions Master sat next to her and asked, &ldquo;Is she mad at me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Possibly, he replied, his head tilting to one side.</p><p>Lyra reached to pluck a letter off of the foot of one of the owls but it began to peck at her fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably hungry,&rdquo; Severus pointed out.</p><p>Lyra grumbled as she pulled out her wand, summoning some food for both herself and her feathery friends. The owls began to feast, allowing Lyra to pull the letters off. She read them as she ate, tuning out &nbsp;her surroundings. The first one she read was plucked off of her own owl, Silver. She expected it to be a response from her cousin but was surprised when she pulled it out.</p><p><i>Lyra,</i></p><p><i>Congratulations on your discovery. Cissy and I were surprised to see you in the paper this morning but nonetheless, we are proud of what you have achieved. Draco has already cut out the article and stuck it to the wall of his bedroom.</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;ve had a few friends already reach out to me, asking whether I could put them in touch with you. They would be delighted to work with a bright witch such as yourself, particularly as rumour has it you may be awarded an Order of Merlin for your work. It would be nice if you resumed your healing career and returned home, Draco misses you dearly and of course so do Cissy and I.</i></p><p><i>Do come by when you can, I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing from you.</i></p><p><i>From your Uncle Lucius</i></p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as she reread the second paragraph, her eyes caught on the words &lsquo; <i>Order of Merlin</i> &rsquo;.</p><p>An Order of Merlin.</p><p>Lyra Lestrange, Order of Merlin First Class. Or Second or Third.</p><p>That had a ring to it.</p><p>That would completely reinvent herself and her name, it would remove the taint of her parents from the Lestrange name and allow her to be her own person.</p><p>She stopped herself, not allowing her thoughts to run too rampant. Surely it was just a joke, a trick Lucius was playing to try and sway her away from the teaching position at Hogwarts and instead return to a Healing career. But, if she did have an OM, maybe Narcissa would finally stop nagging her about getting married and she could pursue Healing to a whole other level.</p><p>Lyra was pulled from her fantasies as she felt the paper get tugged away from her hands. Her head turned quickly towards the culprit and she saw Severus&rsquo; eyes glossing over the paper.</p><p>&ldquo;What if that was private?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo; Order of Merlin ,&rdquo; he read slowly, his narrowed at the paper. Severus folded it before handing it back with a questioning look.</p><p>His face said it all to Lyra. It probably wasn&rsquo;t a genuine nomination, Lucius was awfully close with the Minister of Magic. Lyra was sure that Lucius himself would have nominated her, if not paid the Ministry off to do so. There&rsquo;d be something in it for Lucius too, no doubt a story he could spin to increase the prestige of the Malfoy name.</p><p>Silently she took the parchment, placing it on the table before breaking open the other letters. Each of those letters were from witches and wizards with rather high positions in well established Hospitals, similar to St. Mungo&rsquo;s, congratulating her on her discovery and offering her either apprenticeships or employment within their Hospital&rsquo;s research division. Lyra didn&rsquo;t know how to feel, she was overwhelmed by the response and felt happy but Hogwarts had quickly become her home. She was hesitant to leave, particularly now that she felt comfortable with Severus.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what you wanted isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he commented.</p><p>Lyra looked to him, feeling uncertain of what to say. She should&rsquo;ve been proud and excited, she could feel her heart sing from the recognition but her head was weighing her down, questioning what she was going to do next.</p><p>There was a swoop of wind heard above and a red enveloped dropped in front of her. Severus pulled his wand out and muttered an incantation before prompting Lyra to open it. As she did the envelope slipped between her fingers and spoke &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to regret this, Lyra.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>Severus waved his wand, reversing whatever spell he had cast originally, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not entirely sure but he sounds familiar.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra closed her eyes, playing the voice over in her mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyone who&rsquo;d have a grudge against you?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Lestrange,&rdquo; she smirked, &ldquo;I doubt that&rsquo;ll be the last Howler I receive.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>There was not a single student in sight as Lyra made her way down the corridors, heading in the direction of the Headmaster&rsquo;s Tower. When she arrived at the gargoyle that stood guard at its entrance Lyra said, &ldquo;Albus, it&rsquo;s Lyra,&rdquo; and the gargoyle sprang to life. Lyra stepped onto the stairs as they made their appearance, gracefully following each step as it wound up it&rsquo;s shaft until it reached the office.</p><p>Once the stairs stopped moving Lyra confidently approached the Headmaster as he tended to his pet Phoenix. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she sung out.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Lyra,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Minerva said you wanted to see me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah yes, of course,&rdquo; he said, setting the Phoenix down. &ldquo;Have a seat,&rdquo; he gestured to the empty space in front of his table and a chair appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Lyra took the seat and Albus took his behind his desk. &ldquo;Would you like anything to drink?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine thanks,&rdquo; she replied, shaking her head.</p><p>&ldquo;How have your classes been?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, no problems.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your family?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Lyra said, a skeptical look growing on her face, &ldquo;Did you invite me just for small talk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Albus frowned, &ldquo;I did want to ask about something but I thought I&rsquo;d tried to segue into it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May as well just ask,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the nature of your relationship with Severus?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo; she was shocked at the question.</p><p>&ldquo;You and Severus have been spending an awful amount of time in the company of one another,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Flooing in and out of each other&rsquo;s rooms rather often and at odd hours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just friends, sir,&rdquo; she answered attempting to sound innocent. Her mouth was becoming dry and she swallowed, wishing she had taken his offer of a drink.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been young and in love before, Lyra,&rdquo; he replied as he read Lyra&rsquo;s emotions with ease, &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m not telling you that you can&rsquo;t be with Severus, that is entirely up to the two of you but I am warning you Lyra that the Dark Lord may not be as forgiving and neither would your parents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she frowned, looking away and focusing on the pensieve that stood behind him. She swallowed before speaking, &ldquo;Severus is teaching me Occlumency which is why I&rsquo;ve been spending so much time with him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That and you enjoy his company,&rdquo; he commented.</p><p>Lyra felt the corner of her lip twinge, a smile threatening to take over her expression.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you here to speak of your relationship with Severus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I actually asked you here to congratulate you on your discovery and to ask you whether you&rsquo;re ready to return to your healing career.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra, I believe that you have a talent for healing and you need to pursue it!&rdquo; he said with enthusiasm, &ldquo;You were stuck in that office at St. Mungo&rsquo;s squandering your potential but I believe that the Psyrot case is proof for how talented you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve probably had a few offers already to work in Hospitals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yes I have, but the school year isn&rsquo;t over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you find any offer appealing then you should take it,&rdquo; he encouraged.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You and I both know that the Defence Against the Arts position is cursed, I don&rsquo;t want anything bad happening to you.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled and exhaled a small laugh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeing it through, Albus. I don&rsquo;t want to be one of those teachers that just bail before the school year has ended and leave their students to drown. It&rsquo;s not fair on them. If I&rsquo;m as talented as you think I am then those offers can wait until the school year ends.&rdquo;</p><p>Albus smiled and nodded, &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>Lyra and Severus spent another night together deep in the Dungeons, practicing Occlumency before falling into bed with one another. The next morning at breakfast, Lyra was greeted by a cold air of silence as the students flicked open their copies of The Daily Prophet to be faced with another article about their Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher.</p><p><i>LYRA LESTRANGE: MENDER OR MISCREANT?</i></p><p><i>Written by Rita Skeeter</i></p><p><i>Lyra Lestrange made headlines yesterday after she successfully discovered the cure for Psyrot, garnering the attention of not only the British Wizarding Community but Healers from all around the world.

When I&rsquo;m all riled up with emotion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I could take your mind off of it in another way,&rdquo; he suggested.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s tongue darted out to wet her lips, she leaned back in her chair and smirked, &ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you have letters to tend to,&rdquo; he said, turning to exit the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Sev,&rdquo; she laughed, discarding the letters and rushing to her feet. She grabbed a hold of his arm and tugged him back, pulling him away from his path and spinning him around. Lyra wrapped her arms around him and kissed him. &ldquo;They can wait.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So can I,&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head slightly.</p><p>Severus reached for his wand and lazily flicked it at the classroom door, barring any unwanted visitors. His hands settled for her waist as he kissed her once more. He guided her backwards until they reached her desk, Lyra&rsquo;s bottom hitting the rim of it. She rested her weight back as she began to undo the buttons of his robes.</p><p>Severus, on the other hand, had not bothered with discarding her top. Instead, his hand slid under the blouse and groped her breast through her bra. The feeling of her soft and supple skin combined with the texture of the lace trim was delightful.</p><p>As Lyra pulled his overshirt away, she parted the kiss briefly and ran her hands over the crisp fabric of his white button. She undid the top two buttons and admired him for a second, &ldquo;Merlin, you are so sexy. You should dress like this everyday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How would anyone be able to concentrate?&rdquo; he asked as he pinched her nipple hard.</p><p>She gave a small squeak and smiled at him before continuing his undressing. Severus decided to reciprocate the gesture, not appreciating the lack of access he had with her garments in the way. He was quicker than she was, Lyra choosing to take her time in undressing him whilst he was focused on just seeing her body.</p><p>Once her chest was revealed, Severus relished the feel of her breasts, excitedly leaning over her to kiss and play with them. Lyra&rsquo;s mission in disrobing the man was interrupted but she didn&rsquo;t mind, her head thrown back in pleasure from the stimulation as his tongue circled and flicked over the now hardened nubs, her hands gripping tightly onto the edge of her desk.</p><p>Severus pulled away her skirt next, his hand reaching to palm the heat that lay between her legs, hidden by the thin material of her underwear. Lyra ground back up into his hand, craving the friction. The wizard smirked at her neediness, relishing in the control he had over her.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for her arousal to become more apparent, her juices soaking through her panties. Lyra was flushed with embarrassment and need as she felt her breath get caught in her throat. Severus was relishing in the teasing of her body, amused by the movement of her hips and the dampening of her knickers.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s hands were still clutching firmly onto the edge of the desk as Severus pulled her underwear away and discarded them onto the pile that had gathered on the floor. He dropped down onto his knees and moved her legs so they were over his shoulders before burying his face into her sex. Her scent was intoxicating and her arousal was sweet. He lapped at the nectar that wet the folds of her cunt and his tongue dipped into her hole as he craved more of the taste.</p><p>Once he had had his fill, his fingers replaced his tongue as it moved up to toy with her clitoris. A strangled moan escaped Lyra as he began to pump his fingers in and out of her. Severus watched her as she pinched her nipples, her eyes closed in bliss. Her body was beginning to unravel and she opened her eyes, looking down at him for a brief moment before squeezing them shut once more and coming hard.</p><p>Severus enjoyed the feeling of the walls of her pussy clamping down and pulsing around his fingers for a moment before sliding them out and sucking the juices that remained off of them. He smiled as he stood, Lyra&rsquo;s face a slight pink colour and her heart still racing. She leaned into him, holding his arms tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Have I mentioned how amazing you are before?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;Because you are mind blowing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but I appreciate it,&rdquo; he said with a small smile.</p><p>She looked up at him and smiled, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p>",
