For one, <a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1202/\">the only information we\u2019ve been given about Jon\u2019s naming states unequivocally that his name came from Ned</a>.\u00a0And for Lyanna\u2019s sake, I certainly <i>hope </i>that she wasn\u2019t interested in giving her son a Targaryen name after he was born. <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/176030073098/what-do-you-think-the-story-is-going-to-be\">Even if she had left willingly with Rhaegar (which I believe she did), by the time she gave birth to Jon I think she would have been virtually imprisoned in the tower of joy for months, probably aware that her father and beloved eldest brother had been mockingly executed by the king and almost certainly aware that this man she had run away with was leaving her, probably to fight her next eldest brother and her sometime affianced</a> (and <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/171803656428/why-the-kingsguard-at-the-tower-of-joy-didnt-took\">perhaps having learned</a> that her child\u2019s father was dead at the hands of Robert). Unless Lyanna was really deluding herself, I cannot imagine she was in love with Rhaegar anymore, and to that end, I really doubt that she would have been interested in giving her son a Targaryen name (assuming that she was even in a headspace to do so, given the probable physical trauma of the birth and the likely postpartum infection which followed).
