In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a><br/></small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 4: Please Don\u2019t Fall in Love with Him</i></h2><!-- more --><p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>He watched the upper half slide off the\ncleanly from the wooden stake. Ah, the joys of being one of the top swordsmen\nin the kingdom. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin stood up, allowing his arm to lazily\nrest against his body as he gathered his breath. However, it was proven to be\nquite difficult since something else was on his mind. </i></p><p><i>His heart skipped a beat and not in a good\nway. His stomachs were in knots. His hands trembled as something indescribable\nentered his mind. The more he thought how his precious Sumin was spending time\nwith another man, the more it frustrated him. The more his mind became flooded\nwith fake images of Sumin passionately kissing Ji Yong, the more it made him\nsick to his stomach. </i></p><p><i>As the unknown emotion filled up his entire\nbody, it suddenly hit him. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAm\nI jealous?\u201d </i></p><p>With\nhis back up against the stone wall, Seokjin buried his head in his hands,\npanting; his heart drumming against his chest. His mind was one big jumble as\nhe tried to comprehend the concept of jealousy. There was no way that he could\neven remotely feel that way. Deep down in his heart, he knew that Sumin was\nhis, so why did he feel threatened? Why was his heart telling him that King Ji\nYong was going to successfully steal her away? Why was his mind creating\nhorrific scenarios that only made him want to release his frustrations? Why was\nhis soul crying? </p><p>A veil\nof silence covered the training room as Seokjin continued to sit against the\nwall. His eyes were closed. His breathing grew slow. His thoughts were slowly\nbecoming normal once again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have to trust my princess\u2026 I have\nto have faith in her like she always has in me.\u201d He thought as his trembling\nhand grabbed the hilt of his sword before standing up. </p><p>Taking\none last deep breath and slowly exhaling, releasing any negative emotion that\nwas eating away at his mind, Seokjin channeled his focus into training. He\ncharged at the other practice dummies, imagining them as King Ji Yong, and\nswung his sword. Hopefully, the mindless sword practice could distract his\nmind\u2014 key word\u2026hopefully.</p><p>Back\nwith Sumin and Ji Yong, the duo was now in front of a cute flower stand. Sumin\nwas eyeing the gorgeous yellow roses; a twinkle was shining in the corners of\nher eyes. She quickly asked the owner if she could smell one of them. Of\ncourse, the owner happily obliged the princess\u2019s request and even said she\ncould take one, if she wanted. Sumin\u2019s smile brightened almost immediately. She\nloved yellow roses. It always brought a sense of happiness and complete warmth\nwhenever she saw them in her garden. Plus\u2014it was the flower that Seokjin gave\nher when he confessed his feelings for her. </p><p>She\ngently grasped the stem, careful to watch out for the thorns, if there any, and\nplaced the soft petals against her lips, inhaling the sweet scent of the rose. </p><p>Ji Yong\ncould not help but be awestruck. The light of the sun was hitting her just\nbeautifully. It was if he was staring at an angel. No. A goddess. The way the\nlight was hitting her created this bright aura that glowed all around. What has\nhe done to deserve this beautiful creature as his future queen? </p><p>Wanting\nto be close to her, he gradually closed the gap between their bodies; his arm\nbrushing against hers. His cheek was hovering over hers as he leaned down\nslightly to smell the rose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPermit me to buy you a bouquet,\nPrincess Sumin.\u201d He politely asked, smiling warmly at her. </p><p>Sumin\nturned towards him; her lips almost pressing against his. She clenched her jaw\nbut masked her action with a sweet smile. She disliked him being that close to\nher. She could only ever have one man close to her, and that man was back at\nthe castle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is quite alright, your majesty.\nI am content with my one rose.\u201d She rejected his offer politely, bowing her\nhead just a little bit.</p><p>Ji Yong\ncocked up his brow, \u201cWell then, I guess I have to do this instead.\u201d He said\nvaguely before turning away from the princess. He then walked over to the\nflower owner and whispered something in her ear. Seconds later, he returned\nwith a bouquet of flowers that was made up of one flower from each of the\ndifferent baskets. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\njaw nearly dropped the floor. Never once did she think she would meet someone\nwho was just as conniving as her. Time to switch tactics. </p><p>She plastered\non the most believable smile on her face and \u201chappily\u201d took the bouquet from\nhim. She held up the different flowers to her nose and took in the interesting\ncombination of scents. She muttered a quick thank you before walking over to\nthe next stop of their tour. </p><p>Ji Yong\nchuckled to himself before following her. He placed a hand on her lower back as\nshe guided him to the local fabric shop. </p><p>Inside\nthe shop, the place was decorated with different shades, texture, and everything\nin between. If a person was looking for something specific, then he or she\nwould most likely find it there. That was how notorious this shop was for the\nroyal seamstress. All the fabric, that created Sumin\u2019s breathtaking gowns, came\nfrom this shop. Only the best for the royal family. </p><p>Lightly\npressing her fingers against the soft material, Sumin eyed the fine detail in\neach one, noting how well the shop\u2019s workers took the time to create such\ngorgeous patterns. </p><p>Suddenly,\nshe halted in her steps. Her eyes widened as a faint gasp escaped her lips. She\nturned her body completely towards this ivory colored fabric. She grasped the\nmaterial with both hands, rubbing it in between her thumb and index finger.\nSoon, a small yet fond smile graced her precious lips. The idea of her wedding\ngown being made from this fabric popped in her brain. She imagined herself\nwalking down the long church aisle, with her father by her side, as she slowly\nbut surely made her towards the alter. Where, at the end of it, stood her\ngroom. Her husband. Her king. Kim Seokjin. Her smile grew wide at the mere\nthought of being tied to her beloved. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI see her royal highness has\nwonderful taste in fabrics.\u201d Sumin heard the shop owner say, forcibly removing\nher from her fantasy. </p><p>Sumin\nquickly bowed her, acknowledging the owner, \u201cTell me, would you have enough of\nthis fine material for my seamstress to make, perhaps, my wedding gown?\u201d </p><p>The\nowner\u2019s eyes lit up with excitement, \u201cOh, of course your highness! Even if we\ndid not, we would make sure to acquire some more as soon as possible.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nchuckled brightly; her eyes almost disappearing because of how wide her smile\nwas.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat is most wonderful! I will tell\nmy father about this the moment I return to the castle.\u201d She stated as she\nlooked at the ivory colored cloth once more. </p><p>The\nowner happily thanked Sumin before disappearing to the back of the shop, more\nthan likely, telling the workers to not sell that fabric to anyone else. </p><p>Sumin\nrubbed the soft fabric between her fingers again, not noticing Ji Yong joining\nher side. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI did not know that the princess\nSumin agreed to my marriage proposal.\u201d Ji Yong closed the gap between their\nfaces; his lips practically pressed against her ear. \u201cTell me princess, would\nyou like to live with me in my kingdom or would you rather I rule over your\npeople?\u201d He whispered; his warmth breath fanned the outer part of her ear. </p><p>Sumin\nrolled her shoulders; a habit she did to show her discomfort. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI would like his majesty to create\nsome space between us. We are simply friendly acquaintances, and people might\nmisunderstand our relationship.\u201d She said boldly before turning away and\nleaving the shop.</p><p>Ji Yong\nsighed deeply; his patience slowly waning. Hearing her say that about their\nrelationship switched on something in his mind. His eyes flickered with\nexcitement and determination. Seeing Sumin play hard to get ignited this fun\ngame in his mind. A game which had her hand in marriage as the prize. If there\nwas one thing about Ji Yong that she should have known was that he never liked\nto lose. No woman was out of reach for him, and Sumin was no exception. He\nwould have her has his wife and nothing and no one would change his mind. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh\u2026my dear Sumin\u2026 it is pointless\nto try and throw other women at me.\u201d He exited the shop and followed the\nheadstrong princess. \u201cIt is not like they can satisfy me anyway. My heart is\nset on you, and I <i>will</i> have you.\u201d He\nfinished his obsessive thought as he entered the royal carriage. </p><p>To say\nthat the carriage ride was extremely awkward would be quite an understatement.\nThe overall atmosphere was tensed between the two royal blooded people. A\nperson can feel a strong wall of silence between the two. That was how\nuncomfortable it was, especially for Sumin. She tried every trick in the book\nto get this deranged king off her tail, but it was ultimately proven futile.\nShe even had the courage to bring up his dark past with his many\u2026 <i>many</i> mistresses, but he simply waved\nthose statements off. He even had the audacity to tell her that once they were\nwedded, he would no longer have use for a mistress since he had everything he could\never desire in Sumin. </p><p>Something\nwas not right with him at all. Why was he so adamant on marrying her? Once\nagain, there were more willing princesses, especially from more powerful\nkingdoms, wanting nothing more but to wed the devilishly handsome King Kwon Ji\nYong. How in the world did she capture his attention? How was it even remotely\npossible that this powerful king became so smitten with her that quickly?\nNumerous of these types of questions flooded her mind\u2014 until hearing <i>his </i>voice pulled her away from her them.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy apologies, your majesty. What\nwas your question?\u201d Sumin asked politely; her innocent eyes staring back at his\ncalculating ones. </p><p>Ji Yong\nsmiled softly, \u201cIt is alright.\u201d He leaned over and gently grasped her hand. \u201cI\nwas wondering if you would like to accompany me to the garden after supper? I\nheard there is going to a wonderful full moon gracing the skies this Summer\nnight.\u201d He requested; his lips pressed sweetly on the back of her hand. </p><p>Sumin\nfought the urge to vomit as she smiled warmly at him. She then jerked her hand\nback and proceeded to fold both of her hands neatly in her lap. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI actually have plans with my\nmother this evening. Tonight, she and I are going to be reading a few novels in\nthe library.\u201d She paused, formulating a lie. \u201cMy father, however, would like to\nrequest your presence in his study room.\u201d She told him. </p><p>Ji Yong\nraised his brow, \u201cYour father? I guess I can spare some of my time to get to\nknow my future father-in-law.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled politely, \u201cMy father would be most happy to hear this.\u201d </p><p>Ji Yong\ntook her hand once more and placed a sweet peck on the back of it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnything to make the princess happy\nwith me.\u201d He stated warmly. </p><p>After\nwhat seemed like months of traveling, the royal \u201ccouple\u201d finally arrived back\nto the castle. Sumin was the first one to dash out of the carriage. She had to\nget away from this stubborn, annoying, cocky king. She gathered up her skirt\nand ran as fast as her heels can take her down the drawbridge. </p><p>She\nentered through the castle gates and stood in the middle of the courtyard. The\ncastle workers, that were out and about doing their duties outside, ceased with\nwhat they were doing and politely greeted the princess. Sumin smiled politely\nand bowed her head, acknowledging their greetings, even though her mind was\npreoccupied with finding her sweet knight. She had urgent matters to discuss\nwith him, though\u2026 deep down in her heart, she knew something was wrong.</p><p>Her\neyes scanned the castle grounds as her mind went into overdrive, trying to\nfigure out where Seokjin would be during this time. Then, a lightbulb went off.\nShe remembered that before they started dating, he would spend most of his time\nin the practice room. Honing his swordsmanship skills since he was always\nobsessed with being the best knight in the entire kingdom. </p><p>Just as\nshe turned her body towards the direction of the practice room, she suddenly\nsnapped her fingers. Sumin also remembered that Seokjin would more than likely\nbe done with practice by now. </p><p>She\nmuttered a profanity as she kicked her heel against the pavement. She threw her\nhead back and whined.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere is that stupid knight of\nmine?\u201d She thought to herself\u2014 or so she thought. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPrincess? If you are looking for\nSir Seokjin, I saw him walk in the direction of the weaponry room.\u201d She heard\none of the castle gardeners inform her. </p><p>Her\neyes snapped open, twinkling with relief. She directed her attention to the\nworker and with smile so wide, she happily thanked him before rushing off in\nthat direction. </p><p>Sadly,\nthat adventure was short-lived. The moment she stepped foot towards that\ndirection, she came face-to-face with her mother and her ladies-in-waiting. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMother!\u201d She shrieked with a\nnervous smile displayed on her face.</p><p>The\nqueen raised her brow, \u201cDaughter, where are you running off in such hurry? I\nbelieve supper is soon.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was looking for Seokjin, which by\nthe way, have you seen him mother?\u201d Sumin asked; her fingers slightly twitching\nfrom anxiety. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have not, my daughter, but would\nyou like to accompany your dear old mother to the library?\u201d The queen asked,\nwrapping her around with Sumin\u2019s. </p><p>Sumin\nforced a smile and nodded. Yeah. She didn\u2019t want to make her mother angry. That\nwould only resort in losing precious time because she would be busy arguing\nwith her. She couldn\u2019t afford it. </p><p>Now,\narm-and-arm, Sumin and her mother graciously walked towards the second-floor\nlibrary. The royal women chatted about Sumin\u2019s time with King Ji Yong at the\ntown square. The queen couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at Sumin\u2019s expression and\nknown distaste for the calculating king. If only she could do something for her\nprecious daughter. A mother would do anything in her power to make sure that\nher offspring was content. </p><p>Minutes\nlater, they arrived in front of the library. The queen dismissed her ladies\nbefore walking through the double wooden doors. </p><p>Upon\nentering, the smell of old books invaded the ladies\u2019 nostrils. Something about\nthe smell of parchment paper brought the feeling of euphoria in the ladies\u2019\nmind. The wonders of being intelligent. </p><p>Sumin\ndisappeared off into the section where it only contained romance novels. Her\npersonal favorites where the works of the one and only William Shakespeare. She\nwas envious of how Queen Elizabeth had the opportunity to be in his presence.\nSumin could only imagine the wonderful plays that were acted out based on his\nwork. </p><p>With a\nwarm smile painted on her face, Sumin trailed her index finger against the binds\nof each different colored book, feeling the rough exterior of them. Her eyes\nlit up when she saw the title of her favorite book\u2014 <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. </p><p>Just as\nher hand reached out to take the book out of its spot, another hand clamped\naround her wrist. Her body flinched, and her heart pounded against her chest.\nWhen she finally registered who the person was, she let out a sigh of relief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSeokjin, you gave me such a\nfright.\u201d She mumbled as she held the book close to her chest. </p><p>Seokjin\nstared blankly at her; an unreadable expression graced his handsome face.</p><p>Sumin\neyed him with pure concern, \u201cAre you okay, my beloved? I actually needed to\nhave a word with you.\u201d </p><p>Moments\nof silence passed them by as the two of them remained still, staring at each\nother. Sumin could hear her heart beat against her chest. Her breathing was\nhard as her breasts heaved up and down with each gasp for air she took. </p><p>Suddenly,\nSeokjin grabbed her wrist and pulled towards an unoccupied area of the library.\nThe roughness of his actions alarmed Sumin. Never once, in her years of knowing\nhim, has she ever seen him do this. The cold exterior of his facial expression.\nThe iron grip around her petite wrist. What was gotten into him? </p><p>Before\nshe could even ask him that important question, she felt her back hit against a\nbookshelf as Seokjin, without warning, captured her innocent lips. His hand\ncupped her jaw roughly as he forcibly darted his tongue into her mouth. His\nchest pressed firmly against hers as he made sure she couldn\u2019t leave him. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes remained opened as she suddenly felt fear within her heart. Seeing her\nloving knight become this rough, forceful person scared her. Was this the\nemotion of jealously that her mother spoke to her about? If it was, she did not\nlike it whatsoever. </p><p>She\nquickly broke the passionate kiss but instead of having the opportunity to have\na serious discussion about his insecurities and had no reason to be jealous,\nSumin felt her neck being attacked. She felt his teeth graze against the\nsoftness of her skin as his hands trailed down the sides of her torso. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are mine. You are my princess\u2026\u201d\nSeokjin muttered darkly as he eyed all the unmarked territory of her neck. </p><p>Something\nabout that sentence sent shivers throughout her entire body. The tiny hairs on\nher neck stood up as goosebumps appeared one by one. </p><p>A sigh\nof content slowly left her lips as she couldn\u2019t help but submit to him. She\nwhispered a yes as her skirt slowly lifted up. </p><p>His\nhands trailed up and down her milky thighs and just as his fingers neared her\naching core, the two heard a familiar voice speak to Sumin\u2019s mother. </p><p>Sumin\nimmediately snapped back to reality and pushed Seokjin away. She smoothed out\nthe wrinkles in her dress and then undid her braided bun. She ruffled it up and\npositioned it around her neck, hoping that her luscious locks would cover up\nher marked-up neck. The last thing she needed was to have King Ji Yong\nquestioning where she got those love bites. Though\u2026 why should she care if the\narrogant king saw them or not? Maybe if he did, then he would leave her alone\nonce and for all. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI found the princess.\u201d Ji Yong\nemerged from a poorly lit section of the library. \u201cAnd she is with her loyal\nknight.\u201d He said through clenched teeth as he eyed their questionable\nappearances. He then walked past the possessive knight and stood in front of\nthe flustered princess, anchoring his hands on her hip bones. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes flashed towards Seokjin briefly, feeling her heart ache for him. She had\nto pretend to be civil with the king, but that may entail some polite flirting.\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have seen that you found me. Does\nhis majesty of someone following me?\u201d She teased, smiling sweetly at the king. </p><p>Ji Yong\nchuckled as he tapped her nose playfully, \u201cYour playful words wound me,\nPrincess Sumin. Believe it or not, but I actually pay attention when you speak\nto me. I recalled you saying that you were going to the library with your\nmother after supper, but I noticed the two of you walk towards there minutes\nago.\u201d He then took her hand and gently placed a kiss on her knuckles. \u201cSo, I\ndecided to follow you here and see if there were any good books to read.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled, covering her mouth with her free hand as she did. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I guess I am all yours for\nthe evening. Of course, if my knight is allowed to accompany us.\u201d She said; her\neyes shifting from the king to her precious lover. </p><p>Seokjin\nsmiled and bowed his head, \u201cIf my princess wishes my presence, then I will\nhappily oblige her request.\u201d </p><p>Her\nheart skipped a beat hearing him say such a sentence with nothing but love in\nhis tone of voice. </p><p>Ji Yong\nclenched his jaw, hiding his irritation that her lap dog was going to be with\nthem. Then, out of nowhere, a devious idea popped into his brain. If the knight\nwas going to be a pest, then he might as well return the favor. Ji Yong wasn\u2019t\nna\u00efve. He knew there was some sort of bond between the princess and the knight.\nHowever, he decided to wait it out to make sure that his assumptions were\nright. If his assumptions were right, then it was time to switch tactics. If Ji\nYong wanted to successfully win Sumin\u2019s hand in marriage, then he needed to\neliminate the competition. Now, the fun question was\u2014 how? For now, he was just\ngoing to keep his eye on the knight and study his movements. </p><p>Out of\nthe corner of her eye, Sumin noticed Ji Yong\u2019s face gradually close the gap.\nHer heart tightened as she witnessed a familiar action.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPermit me to kiss you, Princess\nSumin.\u201d Ji Yong said softly as his eyes flickered towards her lips.</p><p>Frozen\nand unsure what to do, Sumin remained silent. </p><p>Taking\nher silence as a good sign, Ji Yong cupped her cheek and closed the tiny gap\nbetween their lips. His lips pressed firmly against hers as he tilted his head\nto gain a better position. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\neyes widened instantly. He couldn\u2019t help but feel sick to his stomach as he was\nforced to witness the love of his life kiss someone else. His hands unknowingly\nballed into fists as they began to tremble. This hot feeling surged throughout\nhis body as Seokjin\u2019s breathing grew rapid. He quickly tried to calm his\nemotions, not wanting to assault the evil king, however, his blind rage was\ngetting the best of him. His heart was breaking with each passing moment of\nthem passionately kissing. Seokjin was living his worst nightmare. </p><p>Just as\nhe about to interrupt the \u201clovers\u201d, Seokjin heard the sound of footsteps coming\ntowards their direction. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDaughter, it is time for\u2014 oh! I am\nso sorry. I did not mean to intrude on your private moment with King Ji Yong.\u201d\nThe queen quickly looked away; her cheeks becoming a pinkish tint. </p><p>Hearing\nher mother\u2019s voice caused Sumin to roughly push the bold king away from her.\nShe quickly wiped her poor lips, hoping that the taint would disappear. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou were not intruding mother as\nthere was no private moment between the two of us.\u201d Sumin said angrily; her\neyes suddenly cold.</p><p>Ji Yong\nsnorted softly but quickly bowed his head apologetically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy apologies for offending her\nroyal highness. I did not mean to let my emotions get carried away. Please\nforgive me, Princess Sumin.\u201d He said with uttermost sincerity in his voice. </p><p>Sumin\nnarrowed her eyes at the king; her face still cold as ice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are forgiven, my lord but\nplease understand me when I say that I can no longer accompany you to the\ngarden after supper. I need some time to myself after this ordeal.\u201d She told\nhim. </p><p>Ji Yong\nraised his head and then nodded, \u201cOf course, my lady. Again, I am sorry for\noffending you. Excuse me. I am going to change before we dine together.\u201d He\nturned away to leave. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at his retreating backside until he was no longer in sight. She then\ndirected her eyes towards her knight, who was still seething from what happened\nprior. She closed her eyes briefly before asking her mother if she could have a\nword with her knight alone.</p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nmother eyed the two with concern, watching the idea of these to wedded fly\nfurther away and away. Jealousy was a scary emotion, and she silently prayed\nthat these two would successfully cross that obstacle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo not take too long, daughter. The\nhead cook will announce that supper is ready soon.\u201d She told them before bowing\nher head and turning away to leave. </p><p>Now, it\nwas only the two of them in the library. The silence was eating them up alive\nas neither one of them wanted to be the first one to say something. Neither one\nof them wanted to accidentally spout something hurtful that it would be too late\nto take it back. Neither one of them wanted to say goodbye.</p><p>Taking\na deep breath and slowly releasing it, Sumin gathered enough courage and looked\nSeokjin straight in the eye. A small yet warm smile graced her face as she took\na step forward, closing the gap between their bodies. Once she was close\nenough, she placed a loving hand on his cheek and lightly caressed it. </p><p>Feeling\nher warm embrace caused the knight to sigh in content. Just by one action, he\nfelt all the love she had for him, and that eased his worried heart. </p><p>He\nleaned into her touch as he finally returned the gaze he was receiving. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you love him, Sumin?\u201d He finally\nasked the question that was plaguing his mind. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt the urge to laugh at such a question. The idea of her even remotely liking\nthe invading king was laughable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat? Of course not. Where on Earth\ndid you get such a silly idea?\u201d She smiled sweetly at him. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as he gently took her hand off his cheek, but still held it in\nhis hand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have seen the way you smile and\nlaugh at his words. It is almost the same way you do with me.\u201d He paused,\ntaking yet another deep breath. \u201cI am honestly confused and completely\nterrified of the idea of you being his wife and not mine.\u201d Seokjin confessed,\nfeeling a tiny weight lift off his heart. </p><p>Instead\nof replying with words, Sumin simply smiled before grabbed his face and pulling\nhim in the most passionate and loving kiss. She poured her entire heart into\nthe kiss, hoping that, once and for all, he will know that it was him that she\nloved. It was him that she had countless of dreams and fantasies of them being\nwedded. It was him that she imagined ruling by her side. It was him that had\nher body and soul under lock and key. It was always him. </p><p>Minutes\nlater, she finally pulled away, revealing a smile of content. \u00a0Seokjin returned the loving smile as he was\ngrateful that her love for him never wavered. It was just his insecurities\ngetting the best of him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow, do you believe me, my beloved?\nI could never love another as much as I love you.\u201d She confessed; her cheeks\nglowed bright red. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled into his chest, resting his head on top of hers, \u201cI do. I am extremely\nsorry for doubting you, Sumin.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is quite alright, my love. Now,\nI believe it is time for supper, and I am thinking of announcing to my father\nthat I changed my mind yet again on the idea of us marrying so soon.\u201d She said\nto him as she interlocked their fingers and proceeded to walk out of the\nlibrary.</p><p>Seokjin\ncouldn\u2019t help but chuckle at her words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou do know that your father is\ngoing to grow tired of us going back and forth between marrying as soon as\npossible and waiting for a year or two.\u201d He added, earning himself a playful\nglare from his princess. </p><p>Sumin\nmocked his town, \u201cWell, do you want to talk to him and inform him that we\nchanged our mind again?\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\nrubbed his nose against her cheek sweetly and said no. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen do not tease me, my dear\nknight!\u201d Sumin poked his cheek as the two neared the entrance of the dining\nroom. </p><p>Seokjin\nsimply laughed in response, \u201cI would never, my sweet princess.\u201d He then\nuntwined their fingers. \u201cNow, enjoy supper. If you are good princess and tell\nyour father about our decision, then I might visit your chambers this evening.\u201d\nHe whispered the last part in her ear. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt a rush of pleasure as soon as he whispered that. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe if you are good knight and\nbehave while King Ji Yong is doing his best to antagonize you, then I might let\nyou.\u201d She teased back, smiling alluring at the knight as she walked away. </p><p>Seokjin\ncould have sworn he felt his crotch area tightened. The thought of them being\nalone and intimate in her chambers sent his hormones into a wild frenzy. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nfor them, someone else was listening in on their conversation. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA midnight rendezvous? We shall see\nabout that, my dear princess.\u201d</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Don\u2019t hate it when you write a villain so evil that you end up hating him and want him to back the fuck off from my main characters&hellip;?

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a><br></small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 4: Please Don\u2019t Fall in Love with Him</i></h2>[[MORE]]<p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>He watched the upper half slide off the\ncleanly from the wooden stake. Ah, the joys of being one of the top swordsmen\nin the kingdom. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin stood up, allowing his arm to lazily\nrest against his body as he gathered his breath. However, it was proven to be\nquite difficult since something else was on his mind. </i></p><p><i>His heart skipped a beat and not in a good\nway. His stomachs were in knots. His hands trembled as something indescribable\nentered his mind. The more he thought how his precious Sumin was spending time\nwith another man, the more it frustrated him. The more his mind became flooded\nwith fake images of Sumin passionately kissing Ji Yong, the more it made him\nsick to his stomach. </i></p><p><i>As the unknown emotion filled up his entire\nbody, it suddenly hit him. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAm\nI jealous?\u201d </i></p><p>With\nhis back up against the stone wall, Seokjin buried his head in his hands,\npanting; his heart drumming against his chest. His mind was one big jumble as\nhe tried to comprehend the concept of jealousy. There was no way that he could\neven remotely feel that way. Deep down in his heart, he knew that Sumin was\nhis, so why did he feel threatened? Why was his heart telling him that King Ji\nYong was going to successfully steal her away? Why was his mind creating\nhorrific scenarios that only made him want to release his frustrations? Why was\nhis soul crying? </p><p>A veil\nof silence covered the training room as Seokjin continued to sit against the\nwall. His eyes were closed. His breathing grew slow. His thoughts were slowly\nbecoming normal once again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have to trust my princess\u2026 I have\nto have faith in her like she always has in me.\u201d He thought as his trembling\nhand grabbed the hilt of his sword before standing up. </p><p>Taking\none last deep breath and slowly exhaling, releasing any negative emotion that\nwas eating away at his mind, Seokjin channeled his focus into training. He\ncharged at the other practice dummies, imagining them as King Ji Yong, and\nswung his sword. Hopefully, the mindless sword practice could distract his\nmind\u2014 key word\u2026hopefully.</p><p>Back\nwith Sumin and Ji Yong, the duo was now in front of a cute flower stand. Sumin\nwas eyeing the gorgeous yellow roses; a twinkle was shining in the corners of\nher eyes. She quickly asked the owner if she could smell one of them. Of\ncourse, the owner happily obliged the princess\u2019s request and even said she\ncould take one, if she wanted. Sumin\u2019s smile brightened almost immediately. She\nloved yellow roses. It always brought a sense of happiness and complete warmth\nwhenever she saw them in her garden. Plus\u2014it was the flower that Seokjin gave\nher when he confessed his feelings for her. </p><p>She\ngently grasped the stem, careful to watch out for the thorns, if there any, and\nplaced the soft petals against her lips, inhaling the sweet scent of the rose. </p><p>Ji Yong\ncould not help but be awestruck. The light of the sun was hitting her just\nbeautifully. It was if he was staring at an angel. No. A goddess. The way the\nlight was hitting her created this bright aura that glowed all around. What has\nhe done to deserve this beautiful creature as his future queen? </p><p>Wanting\nto be close to her, he gradually closed the gap between their bodies; his arm\nbrushing against hers. His cheek was hovering over hers as he leaned down\nslightly to smell the rose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPermit me to buy you a bouquet,\nPrincess Sumin.\u201d He politely asked, smiling warmly at her. </p><p>Sumin\nturned towards him; her lips almost pressing against his. She clenched her jaw\nbut masked her action with a sweet smile. She disliked him being that close to\nher. She could only ever have one man close to her, and that man was back at\nthe castle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is quite alright, your majesty.\nI am content with my one rose.\u201d She rejected his offer politely, bowing her\nhead just a little bit.</p><p>Ji Yong\ncocked up his brow, \u201cWell then, I guess I have to do this instead.\u201d He said\nvaguely before turning away from the princess. He then walked over to the\nflower owner and whispered something in her ear. Seconds later, he returned\nwith a bouquet of flowers that was made up of one flower from each of the\ndifferent baskets. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\njaw nearly dropped the floor. Never once did she think she would meet someone\nwho was just as conniving as her. Time to switch tactics. </p><p>She plastered\non the most believable smile on her face and \u201chappily\u201d took the bouquet from\nhim. She held up the different flowers to her nose and took in the interesting\ncombination of scents. She muttered a quick thank you before walking over to\nthe next stop of their tour. </p><p>Ji Yong\nchuckled to himself before following her. He placed a hand on her lower back as\nshe guided him to the local fabric shop. </p><p>Inside\nthe shop, the place was decorated with different shades, texture, and everything\nin between. If a person was looking for something specific, then he or she\nwould most likely find it there. That was how notorious this shop was for the\nroyal seamstress. All the fabric, that created Sumin\u2019s breathtaking gowns, came\nfrom this shop. Only the best for the royal family. </p><p>Lightly\npressing her fingers against the soft material, Sumin eyed the fine detail in\neach one, noting how well the shop\u2019s workers took the time to create such\ngorgeous patterns. </p><p>Suddenly,\nshe halted in her steps. Her eyes widened as a faint gasp escaped her lips. She\nturned her body completely towards this ivory colored fabric. She grasped the\nmaterial with both hands, rubbing it in between her thumb and index finger.\nSoon, a small yet fond smile graced her precious lips. The idea of her wedding\ngown being made from this fabric popped in her brain. She imagined herself\nwalking down the long church aisle, with her father by her side, as she slowly\nbut surely made her towards the alter. Where, at the end of it, stood her\ngroom. Her husband. Her king. Kim Seokjin. Her smile grew wide at the mere\nthought of being tied to her beloved. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI see her royal highness has\nwonderful taste in fabrics.\u201d Sumin heard the shop owner say, forcibly removing\nher from her fantasy. </p><p>Sumin\nquickly bowed her, acknowledging the owner, \u201cTell me, would you have enough of\nthis fine material for my seamstress to make, perhaps, my wedding gown?\u201d </p><p>The\nowner\u2019s eyes lit up with excitement, \u201cOh, of course your highness! Even if we\ndid not, we would make sure to acquire some more as soon as possible.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nchuckled brightly; her eyes almost disappearing because of how wide her smile\nwas.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat is most wonderful! I will tell\nmy father about this the moment I return to the castle.\u201d She stated as she\nlooked at the ivory colored cloth once more. </p><p>The\nowner happily thanked Sumin before disappearing to the back of the shop, more\nthan likely, telling the workers to not sell that fabric to anyone else. </p><p>Sumin\nrubbed the soft fabric between her fingers again, not noticing Ji Yong joining\nher side. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI did not know that the princess\nSumin agreed to my marriage proposal.\u201d Ji Yong closed the gap between their\nfaces; his lips practically pressed against her ear. \u201cTell me princess, would\nyou like to live with me in my kingdom or would you rather I rule over your\npeople?\u201d He whispered; his warmth breath fanned the outer part of her ear. </p><p>Sumin\nrolled her shoulders; a habit she did to show her discomfort. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI would like his majesty to create\nsome space between us. We are simply friendly acquaintances, and people might\nmisunderstand our relationship.\u201d She said boldly before turning away and\nleaving the shop.</p><p>Ji Yong\nsighed deeply; his patience slowly waning. Hearing her say that about their\nrelationship switched on something in his mind. His eyes flickered with\nexcitement and determination. Seeing Sumin play hard to get ignited this fun\ngame in his mind. A game which had her hand in marriage as the prize. If there\nwas one thing about Ji Yong that she should have known was that he never liked\nto lose. No woman was out of reach for him, and Sumin was no exception. He\nwould have her has his wife and nothing and no one would change his mind. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh\u2026my dear Sumin\u2026 it is pointless\nto try and throw other women at me.\u201d He exited the shop and followed the\nheadstrong princess. \u201cIt is not like they can satisfy me anyway. My heart is\nset on you, and I <i>will</i> have you.\u201d He\nfinished his obsessive thought as he entered the royal carriage. </p><p>To say\nthat the carriage ride was extremely awkward would be quite an understatement.\nThe overall atmosphere was tensed between the two royal blooded people. A\nperson can feel a strong wall of silence between the two. That was how\nuncomfortable it was, especially for Sumin. She tried every trick in the book\nto get this deranged king off her tail, but it was ultimately proven futile.\nShe even had the courage to bring up his dark past with his many\u2026 <i>many</i> mistresses, but he simply waved\nthose statements off. He even had the audacity to tell her that once they were\nwedded, he would no longer have use for a mistress since he had everything he could\never desire in Sumin. </p><p>Something\nwas not right with him at all. Why was he so adamant on marrying her? Once\nagain, there were more willing princesses, especially from more powerful\nkingdoms, wanting nothing more but to wed the devilishly handsome King Kwon Ji\nYong. How in the world did she capture his attention? How was it even remotely\npossible that this powerful king became so smitten with her that quickly?\nNumerous of these types of questions flooded her mind\u2014 until hearing <i>his </i>voice pulled her away from her them.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy apologies, your majesty. What\nwas your question?\u201d Sumin asked politely; her innocent eyes staring back at his\ncalculating ones. </p><p>Ji Yong\nsmiled softly, \u201cIt is alright.\u201d He leaned over and gently grasped her hand. \u201cI\nwas wondering if you would like to accompany me to the garden after supper? I\nheard there is going to a wonderful full moon gracing the skies this Summer\nnight.\u201d He requested; his lips pressed sweetly on the back of her hand. </p><p>Sumin\nfought the urge to vomit as she smiled warmly at him. She then jerked her hand\nback and proceeded to fold both of her hands neatly in her lap. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI actually have plans with my\nmother this evening. Tonight, she and I are going to be reading a few novels in\nthe library.\u201d She paused, formulating a lie. \u201cMy father, however, would like to\nrequest your presence in his study room.\u201d She told him. </p><p>Ji Yong\nraised his brow, \u201cYour father? I guess I can spare some of my time to get to\nknow my future father-in-law.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled politely, \u201cMy father would be most happy to hear this.\u201d </p><p>Ji Yong\ntook her hand once more and placed a sweet peck on the back of it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnything to make the princess happy\nwith me.\u201d He stated warmly. </p><p>After\nwhat seemed like months of traveling, the royal \u201ccouple\u201d finally arrived back\nto the castle. Sumin was the first one to dash out of the carriage. She had to\nget away from this stubborn, annoying, cocky king. She gathered up her skirt\nand ran as fast as her heels can take her down the drawbridge. </p><p>She\nentered through the castle gates and stood in the middle of the courtyard. The\ncastle workers, that were out and about doing their duties outside, ceased with\nwhat they were doing and politely greeted the princess. Sumin smiled politely\nand bowed her head, acknowledging their greetings, even though her mind was\npreoccupied with finding her sweet knight. She had urgent matters to discuss\nwith him, though\u2026 deep down in her heart, she knew something was wrong.</p><p>Her\neyes scanned the castle grounds as her mind went into overdrive, trying to\nfigure out where Seokjin would be during this time. Then, a lightbulb went off.\nShe remembered that before they started dating, he would spend most of his time\nin the practice room. Honing his swordsmanship skills since he was always\nobsessed with being the best knight in the entire kingdom. </p><p>Just as\nshe turned her body towards the direction of the practice room, she suddenly\nsnapped her fingers. Sumin also remembered that Seokjin would more than likely\nbe done with practice by now. </p><p>She\nmuttered a profanity as she kicked her heel against the pavement. She threw her\nhead back and whined.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere is that stupid knight of\nmine?\u201d She thought to herself\u2014 or so she thought. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPrincess? If you are looking for\nSir Seokjin, I saw him walk in the direction of the weaponry room.\u201d She heard\none of the castle gardeners inform her. </p><p>Her\neyes snapped open, twinkling with relief. She directed her attention to the\nworker and with smile so wide, she happily thanked him before rushing off in\nthat direction. </p><p>Sadly,\nthat adventure was short-lived. The moment she stepped foot towards that\ndirection, she came face-to-face with her mother and her ladies-in-waiting. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMother!\u201d She shrieked with a\nnervous smile displayed on her face.</p><p>The\nqueen raised her brow, \u201cDaughter, where are you running off in such hurry? I\nbelieve supper is soon.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was looking for Seokjin, which by\nthe way, have you seen him mother?\u201d Sumin asked; her fingers slightly twitching\nfrom anxiety. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have not, my daughter, but would\nyou like to accompany your dear old mother to the library?\u201d The queen asked,\nwrapping her around with Sumin\u2019s. </p><p>Sumin\nforced a smile and nodded. Yeah. She didn\u2019t want to make her mother angry. That\nwould only resort in losing precious time because she would be busy arguing\nwith her. She couldn\u2019t afford it. </p><p>Now,\narm-and-arm, Sumin and her mother graciously walked towards the second-floor\nlibrary. The royal women chatted about Sumin\u2019s time with King Ji Yong at the\ntown square. The queen couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at Sumin\u2019s expression and\nknown distaste for the calculating king. If only she could do something for her\nprecious daughter. A mother would do anything in her power to make sure that\nher offspring was content. </p><p>Minutes\nlater, they arrived in front of the library. The queen dismissed her ladies\nbefore walking through the double wooden doors. </p><p>Upon\nentering, the smell of old books invaded the ladies\u2019 nostrils. Something about\nthe smell of parchment paper brought the feeling of euphoria in the ladies\u2019\nmind. The wonders of being intelligent. </p><p>Sumin\ndisappeared off into the section where it only contained romance novels. Her\npersonal favorites where the works of the one and only William Shakespeare. She\nwas envious of how Queen Elizabeth had the opportunity to be in his presence.\nSumin could only imagine the wonderful plays that were acted out based on his\nwork. </p><p>With a\nwarm smile painted on her face, Sumin trailed her index finger against the binds\nof each different colored book, feeling the rough exterior of them. Her eyes\nlit up when she saw the title of her favorite book\u2014 <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. </p><p>Just as\nher hand reached out to take the book out of its spot, another hand clamped\naround her wrist. Her body flinched, and her heart pounded against her chest.\nWhen she finally registered who the person was, she let out a sigh of relief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSeokjin, you gave me such a\nfright.\u201d She mumbled as she held the book close to her chest. </p><p>Seokjin\nstared blankly at her; an unreadable expression graced his handsome face.</p><p>Sumin\neyed him with pure concern, \u201cAre you okay, my beloved? I actually needed to\nhave a word with you.\u201d </p><p>Moments\nof silence passed them by as the two of them remained still, staring at each\nother. Sumin could hear her heart beat against her chest. Her breathing was\nhard as her breasts heaved up and down with each gasp for air she took. </p><p>Suddenly,\nSeokjin grabbed her wrist and pulled towards an unoccupied area of the library.\nThe roughness of his actions alarmed Sumin. Never once, in her years of knowing\nhim, has she ever seen him do this. The cold exterior of his facial expression.\nThe iron grip around her petite wrist. What was gotten into him? </p><p>Before\nshe could even ask him that important question, she felt her back hit against a\nbookshelf as Seokjin, without warning, captured her innocent lips. His hand\ncupped her jaw roughly as he forcibly darted his tongue into her mouth. His\nchest pressed firmly against hers as he made sure she couldn\u2019t leave him. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes remained opened as she suddenly felt fear within her heart. Seeing her\nloving knight become this rough, forceful person scared her. Was this the\nemotion of jealously that her mother spoke to her about? If it was, she did not\nlike it whatsoever. </p><p>She\nquickly broke the passionate kiss but instead of having the opportunity to have\na serious discussion about his insecurities and had no reason to be jealous,\nSumin felt her neck being attacked. She felt his teeth graze against the\nsoftness of her skin as his hands trailed down the sides of her torso. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are mine. You are my princess\u2026\u201d\nSeokjin muttered darkly as he eyed all the unmarked territory of her neck. </p><p>Something\nabout that sentence sent shivers throughout her entire body. The tiny hairs on\nher neck stood up as goosebumps appeared one by one. </p><p>A sigh\nof content slowly left her lips as she couldn\u2019t help but submit to him. She\nwhispered a yes as her skirt slowly lifted up. </p><p>His\nhands trailed up and down her milky thighs and just as his fingers neared her\naching core, the two heard a familiar voice speak to Sumin\u2019s mother. </p><p>Sumin\nimmediately snapped back to reality and pushed Seokjin away. She smoothed out\nthe wrinkles in her dress and then undid her braided bun. She ruffled it up and\npositioned it around her neck, hoping that her luscious locks would cover up\nher marked-up neck. The last thing she needed was to have King Ji Yong\nquestioning where she got those love bites. Though\u2026 why should she care if the\narrogant king saw them or not? Maybe if he did, then he would leave her alone\nonce and for all. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI found the princess.\u201d Ji Yong\nemerged from a poorly lit section of the library. \u201cAnd she is with her loyal\nknight.\u201d He said through clenched teeth as he eyed their questionable\nappearances. He then walked past the possessive knight and stood in front of\nthe flustered princess, anchoring his hands on her hip bones. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes flashed towards Seokjin briefly, feeling her heart ache for him. She had\nto pretend to be civil with the king, but that may entail some polite flirting.\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have seen that you found me. Does\nhis majesty of someone following me?\u201d She teased, smiling sweetly at the king. </p><p>Ji Yong\nchuckled as he tapped her nose playfully, \u201cYour playful words wound me,\nPrincess Sumin. Believe it or not, but I actually pay attention when you speak\nto me. I recalled you saying that you were going to the library with your\nmother after supper, but I noticed the two of you walk towards there minutes\nago.\u201d He then took her hand and gently placed a kiss on her knuckles. \u201cSo, I\ndecided to follow you here and see if there were any good books to read.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled, covering her mouth with her free hand as she did. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I guess I am all yours for\nthe evening. Of course, if my knight is allowed to accompany us.\u201d She said; her\neyes shifting from the king to her precious lover. </p><p>Seokjin\nsmiled and bowed his head, \u201cIf my princess wishes my presence, then I will\nhappily oblige her request.\u201d </p><p>Her\nheart skipped a beat hearing him say such a sentence with nothing but love in\nhis tone of voice. </p><p>Ji Yong\nclenched his jaw, hiding his irritation that her lap dog was going to be with\nthem. Then, out of nowhere, a devious idea popped into his brain. If the knight\nwas going to be a pest, then he might as well return the favor. Ji Yong wasn\u2019t\nna\u00efve. He knew there was some sort of bond between the princess and the knight.\nHowever, he decided to wait it out to make sure that his assumptions were\nright. If his assumptions were right, then it was time to switch tactics. If Ji\nYong wanted to successfully win Sumin\u2019s hand in marriage, then he needed to\neliminate the competition. Now, the fun question was\u2014 how? For now, he was just\ngoing to keep his eye on the knight and study his movements. </p><p>Out of\nthe corner of her eye, Sumin noticed Ji Yong\u2019s face gradually close the gap.\nHer heart tightened as she witnessed a familiar action.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPermit me to kiss you, Princess\nSumin.\u201d Ji Yong said softly as his eyes flickered towards her lips.</p><p>Frozen\nand unsure what to do, Sumin remained silent. </p><p>Taking\nher silence as a good sign, Ji Yong cupped her cheek and closed the tiny gap\nbetween their lips. His lips pressed firmly against hers as he tilted his head\nto gain a better position. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\neyes widened instantly. He couldn\u2019t help but feel sick to his stomach as he was\nforced to witness the love of his life kiss someone else. His hands unknowingly\nballed into fists as they began to tremble. This hot feeling surged throughout\nhis body as Seokjin\u2019s breathing grew rapid. He quickly tried to calm his\nemotions, not wanting to assault the evil king, however, his blind rage was\ngetting the best of him. His heart was breaking with each passing moment of\nthem passionately kissing. Seokjin was living his worst nightmare. </p><p>Just as\nhe about to interrupt the \u201clovers\u201d, Seokjin heard the sound of footsteps coming\ntowards their direction. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDaughter, it is time for\u2014 oh! I am\nso sorry. I did not mean to intrude on your private moment with King Ji Yong.\u201d\nThe queen quickly looked away; her cheeks becoming a pinkish tint. </p><p>Hearing\nher mother\u2019s voice caused Sumin to roughly push the bold king away from her.\nShe quickly wiped her poor lips, hoping that the taint would disappear. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou were not intruding mother as\nthere was no private moment between the two of us.\u201d Sumin said angrily; her\neyes suddenly cold.</p><p>Ji Yong\nsnorted softly but quickly bowed his head apologetically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy apologies for offending her\nroyal highness. I did not mean to let my emotions get carried away. Please\nforgive me, Princess Sumin.\u201d He said with uttermost sincerity in his voice. </p><p>Sumin\nnarrowed her eyes at the king; her face still cold as ice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are forgiven, my lord but\nplease understand me when I say that I can no longer accompany you to the\ngarden after supper. I need some time to myself after this ordeal.\u201d She told\nhim. </p><p>Ji Yong\nraised his head and then nodded, \u201cOf course, my lady. Again, I am sorry for\noffending you. Excuse me. I am going to change before we dine together.\u201d He\nturned away to leave. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at his retreating backside until he was no longer in sight. She then\ndirected her eyes towards her knight, who was still seething from what happened\nprior. She closed her eyes briefly before asking her mother if she could have a\nword with her knight alone.</p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nmother eyed the two with concern, watching the idea of these to wedded fly\nfurther away and away. Jealousy was a scary emotion, and she silently prayed\nthat these two would successfully cross that obstacle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo not take too long, daughter. The\nhead cook will announce that supper is ready soon.\u201d She told them before bowing\nher head and turning away to leave. </p><p>Now, it\nwas only the two of them in the library. The silence was eating them up alive\nas neither one of them wanted to be the first one to say something. Neither one\nof them wanted to accidentally spout something hurtful that it would be too late\nto take it back. Neither one of them wanted to say goodbye.</p><p>Taking\na deep breath and slowly releasing it, Sumin gathered enough courage and looked\nSeokjin straight in the eye. A small yet warm smile graced her face as she took\na step forward, closing the gap between their bodies. Once she was close\nenough, she placed a loving hand on his cheek and lightly caressed it. </p><p>Feeling\nher warm embrace caused the knight to sigh in content. Just by one action, he\nfelt all the love she had for him, and that eased his worried heart. </p><p>He\nleaned into her touch as he finally returned the gaze he was receiving. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you love him, Sumin?\u201d He finally\nasked the question that was plaguing his mind. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt the urge to laugh at such a question. The idea of her even remotely liking\nthe invading king was laughable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat? Of course not. Where on Earth\ndid you get such a silly idea?\u201d She smiled sweetly at him. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as he gently took her hand off his cheek, but still held it in\nhis hand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have seen the way you smile and\nlaugh at his words. It is almost the same way you do with me.\u201d He paused,\ntaking yet another deep breath. \u201cI am honestly confused and completely\nterrified of the idea of you being his wife and not mine.\u201d Seokjin confessed,\nfeeling a tiny weight lift off his heart. </p><p>Instead\nof replying with words, Sumin simply smiled before grabbed his face and pulling\nhim in the most passionate and loving kiss. She poured her entire heart into\nthe kiss, hoping that, once and for all, he will know that it was him that she\nloved. It was him that she had countless of dreams and fantasies of them being\nwedded. It was him that she imagined ruling by her side. It was him that had\nher body and soul under lock and key. It was always him. </p><p>Minutes\nlater, she finally pulled away, revealing a smile of content. \u00a0Seokjin returned the loving smile as he was\ngrateful that her love for him never wavered. It was just his insecurities\ngetting the best of him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow, do you believe me, my beloved?\nI could never love another as much as I love you.\u201d She confessed; her cheeks\nglowed bright red. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled into his chest, resting his head on top of hers, \u201cI do. I am extremely\nsorry for doubting you, Sumin.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is quite alright, my love. Now,\nI believe it is time for supper, and I am thinking of announcing to my father\nthat I changed my mind yet again on the idea of us marrying so soon.\u201d She said\nto him as she interlocked their fingers and proceeded to walk out of the\nlibrary.</p><p>Seokjin\ncouldn\u2019t help but chuckle at her words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou do know that your father is\ngoing to grow tired of us going back and forth between marrying as soon as\npossible and waiting for a year or two.\u201d He added, earning himself a playful\nglare from his princess. </p><p>Sumin\nmocked his town, \u201cWell, do you want to talk to him and inform him that we\nchanged our mind again?\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\nrubbed his nose against her cheek sweetly and said no. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen do not tease me, my dear\nknight!\u201d Sumin poked his cheek as the two neared the entrance of the dining\nroom. </p><p>Seokjin\nsimply laughed in response, \u201cI would never, my sweet princess.\u201d He then\nuntwined their fingers. \u201cNow, enjoy supper. If you are good princess and tell\nyour father about our decision, then I might visit your chambers this evening.\u201d\nHe whispered the last part in her ear. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt a rush of pleasure as soon as he whispered that. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe if you are good knight and\nbehave while King Ji Yong is doing his best to antagonize you, then I might let\nyou.\u201d She teased back, smiling alluring at the knight as she walked away. </p><p>Seokjin\ncould have sworn he felt his crotch area tightened. The thought of them being\nalone and intimate in her chambers sent his hormones into a wild frenzy. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nfor them, someone else was listening in on their conversation. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA midnight rendezvous? We shall see\nabout that, my dear princess.\u201d</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Don\u2019t hate it when you write a villain so evil that you end up hating him and want him to back the fuck off from my main characters\u2026?

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a><br></small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 4: Please Don\u2019t Fall in Love with Him</i></h2>[[MORE]]<p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>He watched the upper half slide off the\ncleanly from the wooden stake. Ah, the joys of being one of the top swordsmen\nin the kingdom. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin stood up, allowing his arm to lazily\nrest against his body as he gathered his breath. However, it was proven to be\nquite difficult since something else was on his mind. </i></p><p><i>His heart skipped a beat and not in a good\nway. His stomachs were in knots. His hands trembled as something indescribable\nentered his mind. The more he thought how his precious Sumin was spending time\nwith another man, the more it frustrated him. The more his mind became flooded\nwith fake images of Sumin passionately kissing Ji Yong, the more it made him\nsick to his stomach. </i></p><p><i>As the unknown emotion filled up his entire\nbody, it suddenly hit him. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAm\nI jealous?\u201d </i></p><p>With\nhis back up against the stone wall, Seokjin buried his head in his hands,\npanting; his heart drumming against his chest. His mind was one big jumble as\nhe tried to comprehend the concept of jealousy. There was no way that he could\neven remotely feel that way. Deep down in his heart, he knew that Sumin was\nhis, so why did he feel threatened? Why was his heart telling him that King Ji\nYong was going to successfully steal her away? Why was his mind creating\nhorrific scenarios that only made him want to release his frustrations? Why was\nhis soul crying? </p><p>A veil\nof silence covered the training room as Seokjin continued to sit against the\nwall. His eyes were closed. His breathing grew slow. His thoughts were slowly\nbecoming normal once again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have to trust my princess\u2026 I have\nto have faith in her like she always has in me.\u201d He thought as his trembling\nhand grabbed the hilt of his sword before standing up. </p><p>Taking\none last deep breath and slowly exhaling, releasing any negative emotion that\nwas eating away at his mind, Seokjin channeled his focus into training. He\ncharged at the other practice dummies, imagining them as King Ji Yong, and\nswung his sword. Hopefully, the mindless sword practice could distract his\nmind\u2014 key word\u2026hopefully.</p><p>Back\nwith Sumin and Ji Yong, the duo was now in front of a cute flower stand. Sumin\nwas eyeing the gorgeous yellow roses; a twinkle was shining in the corners of\nher eyes. She quickly asked the owner if she could smell one of them. Of\ncourse, the owner happily obliged the princess\u2019s request and even said she\ncould take one, if she wanted. Sumin\u2019s smile brightened almost immediately. She\nloved yellow roses. It always brought a sense of happiness and complete warmth\nwhenever she saw them in her garden. Plus\u2014it was the flower that Seokjin gave\nher when he confessed his feelings for her. </p><p>She\ngently grasped the stem, careful to watch out for the thorns, if there any, and\nplaced the soft petals against her lips, inhaling the sweet scent of the rose. </p><p>Ji Yong\ncould not help but be awestruck. The light of the sun was hitting her just\nbeautifully. It was if he was staring at an angel. No. A goddess. The way the\nlight was hitting her created this bright aura that glowed all around. What has\nhe done to deserve this beautiful creature as his future queen? </p><p>Wanting\nto be close to her, he gradually closed the gap between their bodies; his arm\nbrushing against hers. His cheek was hovering over hers as he leaned down\nslightly to smell the rose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPermit me to buy you a bouquet,\nPrincess Sumin.\u201d He politely asked, smiling warmly at her. </p><p>Sumin\nturned towards him; her lips almost pressing against his. She clenched her jaw\nbut masked her action with a sweet smile. She disliked him being that close to\nher. She could only ever have one man close to her, and that man was back at\nthe castle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is quite alright, your majesty.\nI am content with my one rose.\u201d She rejected his offer politely, bowing her\nhead just a little bit.</p><p>Ji Yong\ncocked up his brow, \u201cWell then, I guess I have to do this instead.\u201d He said\nvaguely before turning away from the princess. He then walked over to the\nflower owner and whispered something in her ear. Seconds later, he returned\nwith a bouquet of flowers that was made up of one flower from each of the\ndifferent baskets. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\njaw nearly dropped the floor. Never once did she think she would meet someone\nwho was just as conniving as her. Time to switch tactics. </p><p>She plastered\non the most believable smile on her face and \u201chappily\u201d took the bouquet from\nhim. She held up the different flowers to her nose and took in the interesting\ncombination of scents. She muttered a quick thank you before walking over to\nthe next stop of their tour. </p><p>Ji Yong\nchuckled to himself before following her. He placed a hand on her lower back as\nshe guided him to the local fabric shop. </p><p>Inside\nthe shop, the place was decorated with different shades, texture, and everything\nin between. If a person was looking for something specific, then he or she\nwould most likely find it there. That was how notorious this shop was for the\nroyal seamstress. All the fabric, that created Sumin\u2019s breathtaking gowns, came\nfrom this shop. Only the best for the royal family. </p><p>Lightly\npressing her fingers against the soft material, Sumin eyed the fine detail in\neach one, noting how well the shop\u2019s workers took the time to create such\ngorgeous patterns. </p><p>Suddenly,\nshe halted in her steps. Her eyes widened as a faint gasp escaped her lips. She\nturned her body completely towards this ivory colored fabric. She grasped the\nmaterial with both hands, rubbing it in between her thumb and index finger.\nSoon, a small yet fond smile graced her precious lips. The idea of her wedding\ngown being made from this fabric popped in her brain. She imagined herself\nwalking down the long church aisle, with her father by her side, as she slowly\nbut surely made her towards the alter. Where, at the end of it, stood her\ngroom. Her husband. Her king. Kim Seokjin. Her smile grew wide at the mere\nthought of being tied to her beloved. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI see her royal highness has\nwonderful taste in fabrics.\u201d Sumin heard the shop owner say, forcibly removing\nher from her fantasy. </p><p>Sumin\nquickly bowed her, acknowledging the owner, \u201cTell me, would you have enough of\nthis fine material for my seamstress to make, perhaps, my wedding gown?\u201d </p><p>The\nowner\u2019s eyes lit up with excitement, \u201cOh, of course your highness! Even if we\ndid not, we would make sure to acquire some more as soon as possible.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nchuckled brightly; her eyes almost disappearing because of how wide her smile\nwas.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat is most wonderful! I will tell\nmy father about this the moment I return to the castle.\u201d She stated as she\nlooked at the ivory colored cloth once more. </p><p>The\nowner happily thanked Sumin before disappearing to the back of the shop, more\nthan likely, telling the workers to not sell that fabric to anyone else. </p><p>Sumin\nrubbed the soft fabric between her fingers again, not noticing Ji Yong joining\nher side. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI did not know that the princess\nSumin agreed to my marriage proposal.\u201d Ji Yong closed the gap between their\nfaces; his lips practically pressed against her ear. \u201cTell me princess, would\nyou like to live with me in my kingdom or would you rather I rule over your\npeople?\u201d He whispered; his warmth breath fanned the outer part of her ear. </p><p>Sumin\nrolled her shoulders; a habit she did to show her discomfort. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI would like his majesty to create\nsome space between us. We are simply friendly acquaintances, and people might\nmisunderstand our relationship.\u201d She said boldly before turning away and\nleaving the shop.</p><p>Ji Yong\nsighed deeply; his patience slowly waning. Hearing her say that about their\nrelationship switched on something in his mind. His eyes flickered with\nexcitement and determination. Seeing Sumin play hard to get ignited this fun\ngame in his mind. A game which had her hand in marriage as the prize. If there\nwas one thing about Ji Yong that she should have known was that he never liked\nto lose. No woman was out of reach for him, and Sumin was no exception. He\nwould have her has his wife and nothing and no one would change his mind. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh\u2026my dear Sumin\u2026 it is pointless\nto try and throw other women at me.\u201d He exited the shop and followed the\nheadstrong princess. \u201cIt is not like they can satisfy me anyway. My heart is\nset on you, and I <i>will</i> have you.\u201d He\nfinished his obsessive thought as he entered the royal carriage. </p><p>To say\nthat the carriage ride was extremely awkward would be quite an understatement.\nThe overall atmosphere was tensed between the two royal blooded people. A\nperson can feel a strong wall of silence between the two. That was how\nuncomfortable it was, especially for Sumin. She tried every trick in the book\nto get this deranged king off her tail, but it was ultimately proven futile.\nShe even had the courage to bring up his dark past with his many\u2026 <i>many</i> mistresses, but he simply waved\nthose statements off. He even had the audacity to tell her that once they were\nwedded, he would no longer have use for a mistress since he had everything he could\never desire in Sumin. </p><p>Something\nwas not right with him at all. Why was he so adamant on marrying her? Once\nagain, there were more willing princesses, especially from more powerful\nkingdoms, wanting nothing more but to wed the devilishly handsome King Kwon Ji\nYong. How in the world did she capture his attention? How was it even remotely\npossible that this powerful king became so smitten with her that quickly?\nNumerous of these types of questions flooded her mind\u2014 until hearing <i>his </i>voice pulled her away from her them.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy apologies, your majesty. What\nwas your question?\u201d Sumin asked politely; her innocent eyes staring back at his\ncalculating ones. </p><p>Ji Yong\nsmiled softly, \u201cIt is alright.\u201d He leaned over and gently grasped her hand. \u201cI\nwas wondering if you would like to accompany me to the garden after supper? I\nheard there is going to a wonderful full moon gracing the skies this Summer\nnight.\u201d He requested; his lips pressed sweetly on the back of her hand. </p><p>Sumin\nfought the urge to vomit as she smiled warmly at him. She then jerked her hand\nback and proceeded to fold both of her hands neatly in her lap. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI actually have plans with my\nmother this evening. Tonight, she and I are going to be reading a few novels in\nthe library.\u201d She paused, formulating a lie. \u201cMy father, however, would like to\nrequest your presence in his study room.\u201d She told him. </p><p>Ji Yong\nraised his brow, \u201cYour father? I guess I can spare some of my time to get to\nknow my future father-in-law.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled politely, \u201cMy father would be most happy to hear this.\u201d </p><p>Ji Yong\ntook her hand once more and placed a sweet peck on the back of it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnything to make the princess happy\nwith me.\u201d He stated warmly. </p><p>After\nwhat seemed like months of traveling, the royal \u201ccouple\u201d finally arrived back\nto the castle. Sumin was the first one to dash out of the carriage. She had to\nget away from this stubborn, annoying, cocky king. She gathered up her skirt\nand ran as fast as her heels can take her down the drawbridge. </p><p>She\nentered through the castle gates and stood in the middle of the courtyard. The\ncastle workers, that were out and about doing their duties outside, ceased with\nwhat they were doing and politely greeted the princess. Sumin smiled politely\nand bowed her head, acknowledging their greetings, even though her mind was\npreoccupied with finding her sweet knight. She had urgent matters to discuss\nwith him, though\u2026 deep down in her heart, she knew something was wrong.</p><p>Her\neyes scanned the castle grounds as her mind went into overdrive, trying to\nfigure out where Seokjin would be during this time. Then, a lightbulb went off.\nShe remembered that before they started dating, he would spend most of his time\nin the practice room. Honing his swordsmanship skills since he was always\nobsessed with being the best knight in the entire kingdom. </p><p>Just as\nshe turned her body towards the direction of the practice room, she suddenly\nsnapped her fingers. Sumin also remembered that Seokjin would more than likely\nbe done with practice by now. </p><p>She\nmuttered a profanity as she kicked her heel against the pavement. She threw her\nhead back and whined.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere is that stupid knight of\nmine?\u201d She thought to herself\u2014 or so she thought. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPrincess? If you are looking for\nSir Seokjin, I saw him walk in the direction of the weaponry room.\u201d She heard\none of the castle gardeners inform her. </p><p>Her\neyes snapped open, twinkling with relief. She directed her attention to the\nworker and with smile so wide, she happily thanked him before rushing off in\nthat direction. </p><p>Sadly,\nthat adventure was short-lived. The moment she stepped foot towards that\ndirection, she came face-to-face with her mother and her ladies-in-waiting. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMother!\u201d She shrieked with a\nnervous smile displayed on her face.</p><p>The\nqueen raised her brow, \u201cDaughter, where are you running off in such hurry? I\nbelieve supper is soon.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was looking for Seokjin, which by\nthe way, have you seen him mother?\u201d Sumin asked; her fingers slightly twitching\nfrom anxiety. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have not, my daughter, but would\nyou like to accompany your dear old mother to the library?\u201d The queen asked,\nwrapping her around with Sumin\u2019s. </p><p>Sumin\nforced a smile and nodded. Yeah. She didn\u2019t want to make her mother angry. That\nwould only resort in losing precious time because she would be busy arguing\nwith her. She couldn\u2019t afford it. </p><p>Now,\narm-and-arm, Sumin and her mother graciously walked towards the second-floor\nlibrary. The royal women chatted about Sumin\u2019s time with King Ji Yong at the\ntown square. The queen couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at Sumin\u2019s expression and\nknown distaste for the calculating king. If only she could do something for her\nprecious daughter. A mother would do anything in her power to make sure that\nher offspring was content. </p><p>Minutes\nlater, they arrived in front of the library. The queen dismissed her ladies\nbefore walking through the double wooden doors. </p><p>Upon\nentering, the smell of old books invaded the ladies\u2019 nostrils. Something about\nthe smell of parchment paper brought the feeling of euphoria in the ladies\u2019\nmind. The wonders of being intelligent. </p><p>Sumin\ndisappeared off into the section where it only contained romance novels. Her\npersonal favorites where the works of the one and only William Shakespeare. She\nwas envious of how Queen Elizabeth had the opportunity to be in his presence.\nSumin could only imagine the wonderful plays that were acted out based on his\nwork. </p><p>With a\nwarm smile painted on her face, Sumin trailed her index finger against the binds\nof each different colored book, feeling the rough exterior of them. Her eyes\nlit up when she saw the title of her favorite book\u2014 <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. </p><p>Just as\nher hand reached out to take the book out of its spot, another hand clamped\naround her wrist. Her body flinched, and her heart pounded against her chest.\nWhen she finally registered who the person was, she let out a sigh of relief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSeokjin, you gave me such a\nfright.\u201d She mumbled as she held the book close to her chest. </p><p>Seokjin\nstared blankly at her; an unreadable expression graced his handsome face.</p><p>Sumin\neyed him with pure concern, \u201cAre you okay, my beloved? I actually needed to\nhave a word with you.\u201d </p><p>Moments\nof silence passed them by as the two of them remained still, staring at each\nother. Sumin could hear her heart beat against her chest. Her breathing was\nhard as her breasts heaved up and down with each gasp for air she took. </p><p>Suddenly,\nSeokjin grabbed her wrist and pulled towards an unoccupied area of the library.\nThe roughness of his actions alarmed Sumin. Never once, in her years of knowing\nhim, has she ever seen him do this. The cold exterior of his facial expression.\nThe iron grip around her petite wrist. What was gotten into him? </p><p>Before\nshe could even ask him that important question, she felt her back hit against a\nbookshelf as Seokjin, without warning, captured her innocent lips. His hand\ncupped her jaw roughly as he forcibly darted his tongue into her mouth. His\nchest pressed firmly against hers as he made sure she couldn\u2019t leave him. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes remained opened as she suddenly felt fear within her heart. Seeing her\nloving knight become this rough, forceful person scared her. Was this the\nemotion of jealously that her mother spoke to her about? If it was, she did not\nlike it whatsoever. </p><p>She\nquickly broke the passionate kiss but instead of having the opportunity to have\na serious discussion about his insecurities and had no reason to be jealous,\nSumin felt her neck being attacked. She felt his teeth graze against the\nsoftness of her skin as his hands trailed down the sides of her torso. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are mine. You are my princess\u2026\u201d\nSeokjin muttered darkly as he eyed all the unmarked territory of her neck. </p><p>Something\nabout that sentence sent shivers throughout her entire body. The tiny hairs on\nher neck stood up as goosebumps appeared one by one. </p><p>A sigh\nof content slowly left her lips as she couldn\u2019t help but submit to him. She\nwhispered a yes as her skirt slowly lifted up. </p><p>His\nhands trailed up and down her milky thighs and just as his fingers neared her\naching core, the two heard a familiar voice speak to Sumin\u2019s mother. </p><p>Sumin\nimmediately snapped back to reality and pushed Seokjin away. She smoothed out\nthe wrinkles in her dress and then undid her braided bun. She ruffled it up and\npositioned it around her neck, hoping that her luscious locks would cover up\nher marked-up neck. The last thing she needed was to have King Ji Yong\nquestioning where she got those love bites. Though\u2026 why should she care if the\narrogant king saw them or not? Maybe if he did, then he would leave her alone\nonce and for all. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI found the princess.\u201d Ji Yong\nemerged from a poorly lit section of the library. \u201cAnd she is with her loyal\nknight.\u201d He said through clenched teeth as he eyed their questionable\nappearances. He then walked past the possessive knight and stood in front of\nthe flustered princess, anchoring his hands on her hip bones. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes flashed towards Seokjin briefly, feeling her heart ache for him. She had\nto pretend to be civil with the king, but that may entail some polite flirting.\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have seen that you found me. Does\nhis majesty of someone following me?\u201d She teased, smiling sweetly at the king. </p><p>Ji Yong\nchuckled as he tapped her nose playfully, \u201cYour playful words wound me,\nPrincess Sumin. Believe it or not, but I actually pay attention when you speak\nto me. I recalled you saying that you were going to the library with your\nmother after supper, but I noticed the two of you walk towards there minutes\nago.\u201d He then took her hand and gently placed a kiss on her knuckles. \u201cSo, I\ndecided to follow you here and see if there were any good books to read.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled, covering her mouth with her free hand as she did. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I guess I am all yours for\nthe evening. Of course, if my knight is allowed to accompany us.\u201d She said; her\neyes shifting from the king to her precious lover. </p><p>Seokjin\nsmiled and bowed his head, \u201cIf my princess wishes my presence, then I will\nhappily oblige her request.\u201d </p><p>Her\nheart skipped a beat hearing him say such a sentence with nothing but love in\nhis tone of voice. </p><p>Ji Yong\nclenched his jaw, hiding his irritation that her lap dog was going to be with\nthem. Then, out of nowhere, a devious idea popped into his brain. If the knight\nwas going to be a pest, then he might as well return the favor. Ji Yong wasn\u2019t\nna\u00efve. He knew there was some sort of bond between the princess and the knight.\nHowever, he decided to wait it out to make sure that his assumptions were\nright. If his assumptions were right, then it was time to switch tactics. If Ji\nYong wanted to successfully win Sumin\u2019s hand in marriage, then he needed to\neliminate the competition. Now, the fun question was\u2014 how? For now, he was just\ngoing to keep his eye on the knight and study his movements. </p><p>Out of\nthe corner of her eye, Sumin noticed Ji Yong\u2019s face gradually close the gap.\nHer heart tightened as she witnessed a familiar action.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPermit me to kiss you, Princess\nSumin.\u201d Ji Yong said softly as his eyes flickered towards her lips.</p><p>Frozen\nand unsure what to do, Sumin remained silent. </p><p>Taking\nher silence as a good sign, Ji Yong cupped her cheek and closed the tiny gap\nbetween their lips. His lips pressed firmly against hers as he tilted his head\nto gain a better position. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\neyes widened instantly. He couldn\u2019t help but feel sick to his stomach as he was\nforced to witness the love of his life kiss someone else. His hands unknowingly\nballed into fists as they began to tremble. This hot feeling surged throughout\nhis body as Seokjin\u2019s breathing grew rapid. He quickly tried to calm his\nemotions, not wanting to assault the evil king, however, his blind rage was\ngetting the best of him. His heart was breaking with each passing moment of\nthem passionately kissing. Seokjin was living his worst nightmare. </p><p>Just as\nhe about to interrupt the \u201clovers\u201d, Seokjin heard the sound of footsteps coming\ntowards their direction. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDaughter, it is time for\u2014 oh! I am\nso sorry. I did not mean to intrude on your private moment with King Ji Yong.\u201d\nThe queen quickly looked away; her cheeks becoming a pinkish tint. </p><p>Hearing\nher mother\u2019s voice caused Sumin to roughly push the bold king away from her.\nShe quickly wiped her poor lips, hoping that the taint would disappear. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou were not intruding mother as\nthere was no private moment between the two of us.\u201d Sumin said angrily; her\neyes suddenly cold.</p><p>Ji Yong\nsnorted softly but quickly bowed his head apologetically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy apologies for offending her\nroyal highness. I did not mean to let my emotions get carried away. Please\nforgive me, Princess Sumin.\u201d He said with uttermost sincerity in his voice. </p><p>Sumin\nnarrowed her eyes at the king; her face still cold as ice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are forgiven, my lord but\nplease understand me when I say that I can no longer accompany you to the\ngarden after supper. I need some time to myself after this ordeal.\u201d She told\nhim. </p><p>Ji Yong\nraised his head and then nodded, \u201cOf course, my lady. Again, I am sorry for\noffending you. Excuse me. I am going to change before we dine together.\u201d He\nturned away to leave. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at his retreating backside until he was no longer in sight. She then\ndirected her eyes towards her knight, who was still seething from what happened\nprior. She closed her eyes briefly before asking her mother if she could have a\nword with her knight alone.</p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nmother eyed the two with concern, watching the idea of these to wedded fly\nfurther away and away. Jealousy was a scary emotion, and she silently prayed\nthat these two would successfully cross that obstacle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo not take too long, daughter. The\nhead cook will announce that supper is ready soon.\u201d She told them before bowing\nher head and turning away to leave. </p><p>Now, it\nwas only the two of them in the library. The silence was eating them up alive\nas neither one of them wanted to be the first one to say something. Neither one\nof them wanted to accidentally spout something hurtful that it would be too late\nto take it back. Neither one of them wanted to say goodbye.</p><p>Taking\na deep breath and slowly releasing it, Sumin gathered enough courage and looked\nSeokjin straight in the eye. A small yet warm smile graced her face as she took\na step forward, closing the gap between their bodies. Once she was close\nenough, she placed a loving hand on his cheek and lightly caressed it. </p><p>Feeling\nher warm embrace caused the knight to sigh in content. Just by one action, he\nfelt all the love she had for him, and that eased his worried heart. </p><p>He\nleaned into her touch as he finally returned the gaze he was receiving. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you love him, Sumin?\u201d He finally\nasked the question that was plaguing his mind. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt the urge to laugh at such a question. The idea of her even remotely liking\nthe invading king was laughable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat? Of course not. Where on Earth\ndid you get such a silly idea?\u201d She smiled sweetly at him. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as he gently took her hand off his cheek, but still held it in\nhis hand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have seen the way you smile and\nlaugh at his words. It is almost the same way you do with me.\u201d He paused,\ntaking yet another deep breath. \u201cI am honestly confused and completely\nterrified of the idea of you being his wife and not mine.\u201d Seokjin confessed,\nfeeling a tiny weight lift off his heart. </p><p>Instead\nof replying with words, Sumin simply smiled before grabbed his face and pulling\nhim in the most passionate and loving kiss. She poured her entire heart into\nthe kiss, hoping that, once and for all, he will know that it was him that she\nloved. It was him that she had countless of dreams and fantasies of them being\nwedded. It was him that she imagined ruling by her side. It was him that had\nher body and soul under lock and key. It was always him. </p><p>Minutes\nlater, she finally pulled away, revealing a smile of content. \u00a0Seokjin returned the loving smile as he was\ngrateful that her love for him never wavered. It was just his insecurities\ngetting the best of him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow, do you believe me, my beloved?\nI could never love another as much as I love you.\u201d She confessed; her cheeks\nglowed bright red. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled into his chest, resting his head on top of hers, \u201cI do. I am extremely\nsorry for doubting you, Sumin.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is quite alright, my love. Now,\nI believe it is time for supper, and I am thinking of announcing to my father\nthat I changed my mind yet again on the idea of us marrying so soon.\u201d She said\nto him as she interlocked their fingers and proceeded to walk out of the\nlibrary.</p><p>Seokjin\ncouldn\u2019t help but chuckle at her words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou do know that your father is\ngoing to grow tired of us going back and forth between marrying as soon as\npossible and waiting for a year or two.\u201d He added, earning himself a playful\nglare from his princess. </p><p>Sumin\nmocked his town, \u201cWell, do you want to talk to him and inform him that we\nchanged our mind again?\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\nrubbed his nose against her cheek sweetly and said no. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen do not tease me, my dear\nknight!\u201d Sumin poked his cheek as the two neared the entrance of the dining\nroom. </p><p>Seokjin\nsimply laughed in response, \u201cI would never, my sweet princess.\u201d He then\nuntwined their fingers. \u201cNow, enjoy supper. If you are good princess and tell\nyour father about our decision, then I might visit your chambers this evening.\u201d\nHe whispered the last part in her ear. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt a rush of pleasure as soon as he whispered that. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe if you are good knight and\nbehave while King Ji Yong is doing his best to antagonize you, then I might let\nyou.\u201d She teased back, smiling alluring at the knight as she walked away. </p><p>Seokjin\ncould have sworn he felt his crotch area tightened. The thought of them being\nalone and intimate in her chambers sent his hormones into a wild frenzy. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nfor them, someone else was listening in on their conversation. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA midnight rendezvous? We shall see\nabout that, my dear princess.\u201d</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Don\u2019t hate it when you write a villain so evil that you end up hating him and want him to back the fuck off from my main characters\u2026?

The more his mind became flooded\nwith fake images of Sumin passionately kissing Ji Yong, the more it made him\nsick to his stomach. </i></p><p><i>As the unknown emotion filled up his entire\nbody, it suddenly hit him. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Am\nI jealous?&rdquo; </i></p><p>With\nhis back up against the stone wall, Seokjin buried his head in his hands,\npanting; his heart drumming against his chest. His mind was one big jumble as\nhe tried to comprehend the concept of jealousy. There was no way that he could\neven remotely feel that way. Deep down in his heart, he knew that Sumin was\nhis, so why did he feel threatened? Why was his heart telling him that King Ji\nYong was going to successfully steal her away? Why was his mind creating\nhorrific scenarios that only made him want to release his frustrations? Why was\nhis soul crying? </p><p>A veil\nof silence covered the training room as Seokjin continued to sit against the\nwall. His eyes were closed. His breathing grew slow. His thoughts were slowly\nbecoming normal once again. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I have to trust my princess&hellip; I have\nto have faith in her like she always has in me.&rdquo; He thought as his trembling\nhand grabbed the hilt of his sword before standing up. </p><p>Taking\none last deep breath and slowly exhaling, releasing any negative emotion that\nwas eating away at his mind, Seokjin channeled his focus into training. He\ncharged at the other practice dummies, imagining them as King Ji Yong, and\nswung his sword. Hopefully, the mindless sword practice could distract his\nmind&mdash; key word&hellip;hopefully.</p><p>Back\nwith Sumin and Ji Yong, the duo was now in front of a cute flower stand. Sumin\nwas eyeing the gorgeous yellow roses; a twinkle was shining in the corners of\nher eyes. She quickly asked the owner if she could smell one of them. Of\ncourse, the owner happily obliged the princess&rsquo;s request and even said she\ncould take one, if she wanted. Sumin&rsquo;s smile brightened almost immediately. She\nloved yellow roses. It always brought a sense of happiness and complete warmth\nwhenever she saw them in her garden. Plus&mdash;it was the flower that Seokjin gave\nher when he confessed his feelings for her. </p><p>She\ngently grasped the stem, careful to watch out for the thorns, if there any, and\nplaced the soft petals against her lips, inhaling the sweet scent of the rose. </p><p>Ji Yong\ncould not help but be awestruck. The light of the sun was hitting her just\nbeautifully. It was if he was staring at an angel. No. A goddess. The way the\nlight was hitting her created this bright aura that glowed all around. What has\nhe done to deserve this beautiful creature as his future queen? </p><p>Wanting\nto be close to her, he gradually closed the gap between their bodies; his arm\nbrushing against hers. His cheek was hovering over hers as he leaned down\nslightly to smell the rose. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Permit me to buy you a bouquet,\nPrincess Sumin.&rdquo; He politely asked, smiling warmly at her. </p><p>Sumin\nturned towards him; her lips almost pressing against his. She clenched her jaw\nbut masked her action with a sweet smile. She disliked him being that close to\nher. She could only ever have one man close to her, and that man was back at\nthe castle. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It is quite alright, your majesty.\nI am content with my one rose.&rdquo; She rejected his offer politely, bowing her\nhead just a little bit.</p><p>Ji Yong\ncocked up his brow, &ldquo;Well then, I guess I have to do this instead.&rdquo; He said\nvaguely before turning away from the princess. He then walked over to the\nflower owner and whispered something in her ear. Seconds later, he returned\nwith a bouquet of flowers that was made up of one flower from each of the\ndifferent baskets. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\njaw nearly dropped the floor. Never once did she think she would meet someone\nwho was just as conniving as her. Time to switch tactics. </p><p>She plastered\non the most believable smile on her face and &ldquo;happily&rdquo; took the bouquet from\nhim. She held up the different flowers to her nose and took in the interesting\ncombination of scents. She muttered a quick thank you before walking over to\nthe next stop of their tour. </p><p>Ji Yong\nchuckled to himself before following her. He placed a hand on her lower back as\nshe guided him to the local fabric shop. </p><p>Inside\nthe shop, the place was decorated with different shades, texture, and everything\nin between. If a person was looking for something specific, then he or she\nwould most likely find it there. That was how notorious this shop was for the\nroyal seamstress. All the fabric, that created Sumin&rsquo;s breathtaking gowns, came\nfrom this shop. Only the best for the royal family. </p><p>Lightly\npressing her fingers against the soft material, Sumin eyed the fine detail in\neach one, noting how well the shop&rsquo;s workers took the time to create such\ngorgeous patterns. </p><p>Suddenly,\nshe halted in her steps. Her eyes widened as a faint gasp escaped her lips. She\nturned her body completely towards this ivory colored fabric. She grasped the\nmaterial with both hands, rubbing it in between her thumb and index finger.\nSoon, a small yet fond smile graced her precious lips. The idea of her wedding\ngown being made from this fabric popped in her brain. She imagined herself\nwalking down the long church aisle, with her father by her side, as she slowly\nbut surely made her towards the alter. Where, at the end of it, stood her\ngroom. Her husband. Her king. Kim Seokjin. Her smile grew wide at the mere\nthought of being tied to her beloved. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I see her royal highness has\nwonderful taste in fabrics.&rdquo; Sumin heard the shop owner say, forcibly removing\nher from her fantasy. </p><p>Sumin\nquickly bowed her, acknowledging the owner, &ldquo;Tell me, would you have enough of\nthis fine material for my seamstress to make, perhaps, my wedding gown?&rdquo; </p><p>The\nowner&rsquo;s eyes lit up with excitement, &ldquo;Oh, of course your highness! Even if we\ndid not, we would make sure to acquire some more as soon as possible.&rdquo; </p><p>Sumin\nchuckled brightly; her eyes almost disappearing because of how wide her smile\nwas.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;That is most wonderful! I will tell\nmy father about this the moment I return to the castle.&rdquo; She stated as she\nlooked at the ivory colored cloth once more. </p><p>The\nowner happily thanked Sumin before disappearing to the back of the shop, more\nthan likely, telling the workers to not sell that fabric to anyone else. </p><p>Sumin\nrubbed the soft fabric between her fingers again, not noticing Ji Yong joining\nher side. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I did not know that the princess\nSumin agreed to my marriage proposal.&rdquo; Ji Yong closed the gap between their\nfaces; his lips practically pressed against her ear. &ldquo;Tell me princess, would\nyou like to live with me in my kingdom or would you rather I rule over your\npeople?&rdquo; He whispered; his warmth breath fanned the outer part of her ear. </p><p>Sumin\nrolled her shoulders; a habit she did to show her discomfort. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I would like his majesty to create\nsome space between us. We are simply friendly acquaintances, and people might\nmisunderstand our relationship.&rdquo; She said boldly before turning away and\nleaving the shop.</p><p>Ji Yong\nsighed deeply; his patience slowly waning. Hearing her say that about their\nrelationship switched on something in his mind. His eyes flickered with\nexcitement and determination. Seeing Sumin play hard to get ignited this fun\ngame in his mind. A game which had her hand in marriage as the prize. If there\nwas one thing about Ji Yong that she should have known was that he never liked\nto lose. No woman was out of reach for him, and Sumin was no exception. He\nwould have her has his wife and nothing and no one would change his mind. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh&hellip;my dear Sumin&hellip; it is pointless\nto try and throw other women at me.&rdquo; He exited the shop and followed the\nheadstrong princess. &ldquo;It is not like they can satisfy me anyway. My heart is\nset on you, and I <i>will</i> have you.&rdquo; He\nfinished his obsessive thought as he entered the royal carriage. </p><p>To say\nthat the carriage ride was extremely awkward would be quite an understatement.\nThe overall atmosphere was tensed between the two royal blooded people. A\nperson can feel a strong wall of silence between the two. That was how\nuncomfortable it was, especially for Sumin. She tried every trick in the book\nto get this deranged king off her tail, but it was ultimately proven futile.\nShe even had the courage to bring up his dark past with his many&hellip; <i>many</i> mistresses, but he simply waved\nthose statements off. He even had the audacity to tell her that once they were\nwedded, he would no longer have use for a mistress since he had everything he could\never desire in Sumin. </p><p>Something\nwas not right with him at all. Why was he so adamant on marrying her? Once\nagain, there were more willing princesses, especially from more powerful\nkingdoms, wanting nothing more but to wed the devilishly handsome King Kwon Ji\nYong. How in the world did she capture his attention? How was it even remotely\npossible that this powerful king became so smitten with her that quickly?\nNumerous of these types of questions flooded her mind&mdash; until hearing <i>his </i>voice pulled her away from her them.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My apologies, your majesty. What\nwas your question?&rdquo; Sumin asked politely; her innocent eyes staring back at his\ncalculating ones. </p><p>Ji Yong\nsmiled softly, &ldquo;It is alright.&rdquo; He leaned over and gently grasped her hand. &ldquo;I\nwas wondering if you would like to accompany me to the garden after supper? I\nheard there is going to a wonderful full moon gracing the skies this Summer\nnight.&rdquo; He requested; his lips pressed sweetly on the back of her hand. </p><p>Sumin\nfought the urge to vomit as she smiled warmly at him. She then jerked her hand\nback and proceeded to fold both of her hands neatly in her lap. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I actually have plans with my\nmother this evening. Tonight, she and I are going to be reading a few novels in\nthe library.&rdquo; She paused, formulating a lie. &ldquo;My father, however, would like to\nrequest your presence in his study room.&rdquo; She told him. </p><p>Ji Yong\nraised his brow, &ldquo;Your father? I guess I can spare some of my time to get to\nknow my future father-in-law.&rdquo; </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled politely, &ldquo;My father would be most happy to hear this.&rdquo; </p><p>Ji Yong\ntook her hand once more and placed a sweet peck on the back of it.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Anything to make the princess happy\nwith me.&rdquo; He stated warmly. </p><p>After\nwhat seemed like months of traveling, the royal &ldquo;couple&rdquo; finally arrived back\nto the castle. Sumin was the first one to dash out of the carriage. She had to\nget away from this stubborn, annoying, cocky king. She gathered up her skirt\nand ran as fast as her heels can take her down the drawbridge. </p><p>She\nentered through the castle gates and stood in the middle of the courtyard. The\ncastle workers, that were out and about doing their duties outside, ceased with\nwhat they were doing and politely greeted the princess. Sumin smiled politely\nand bowed her head, acknowledging their greetings, even though her mind was\npreoccupied with finding her sweet knight. She had urgent matters to discuss\nwith him, though&hellip; deep down in her heart, she knew something was wrong.</p><p>Her\neyes scanned the castle grounds as her mind went into overdrive, trying to\nfigure out where Seokjin would be during this time. Then, a lightbulb went off.\nShe remembered that before they started dating, he would spend most of his time\nin the practice room. Honing his swordsmanship skills since he was always\nobsessed with being the best knight in the entire kingdom. </p><p>Just as\nshe turned her body towards the direction of the practice room, she suddenly\nsnapped her fingers. Sumin also remembered that Seokjin would more than likely\nbe done with practice by now. </p><p>She\nmuttered a profanity as she kicked her heel against the pavement. She threw her\nhead back and whined.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Where is that stupid knight of\nmine?&rdquo; She thought to herself&mdash; or so she thought. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Princess? If you are looking for\nSir Seokjin, I saw him walk in the direction of the weaponry room.&rdquo; She heard\none of the castle gardeners inform her. </p><p>Her\neyes snapped open, twinkling with relief. She directed her attention to the\nworker and with smile so wide, she happily thanked him before rushing off in\nthat direction. </p><p>Sadly,\nthat adventure was short-lived. The moment she stepped foot towards that\ndirection, she came face-to-face with her mother and her ladies-in-waiting. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; She shrieked with a\nnervous smile displayed on her face.</p><p>The\nqueen raised her brow, &ldquo;Daughter, where are you running off in such hurry? I\nbelieve supper is soon.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I was looking for Seokjin, which by\nthe way, have you seen him mother?&rdquo; Sumin asked; her fingers slightly twitching\nfrom anxiety. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I have not, my daughter, but would\nyou like to accompany your dear old mother to the library?&rdquo; The queen asked,\nwrapping her around with Sumin&rsquo;s. </p><p>Sumin\nforced a smile and nodded. Yeah. She didn&rsquo;t want to make her mother angry. That\nwould only resort in losing precious time because she would be busy arguing\nwith her. She couldn&rsquo;t afford it. </p><p>Now,\narm-and-arm, Sumin and her mother graciously walked towards the second-floor\nlibrary. The royal women chatted about Sumin&rsquo;s time with King Ji Yong at the\ntown square. The queen couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle at Sumin&rsquo;s expression and\nknown distaste for the calculating king. If only she could do something for her\nprecious daughter. A mother would do anything in her power to make sure that\nher offspring was content. </p><p>Minutes\nlater, they arrived in front of the library. The queen dismissed her ladies\nbefore walking through the double wooden doors. </p><p>Upon\nentering, the smell of old books invaded the ladies&rsquo; nostrils. Something about\nthe smell of parchment paper brought the feeling of euphoria in the ladies&rsquo;\nmind. The wonders of being intelligent. </p><p>Sumin\ndisappeared off into the section where it only contained romance novels. Her\npersonal favorites where the works of the one and only William Shakespeare. She\nwas envious of how Queen Elizabeth had the opportunity to be in his presence.\nSumin could only imagine the wonderful plays that were acted out based on his\nwork. </p><p>With a\nwarm smile painted on her face, Sumin trailed her index finger against the binds\nof each different colored book, feeling the rough exterior of them. Her eyes\nlit up when she saw the title of her favorite book&mdash; <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. </p><p>Just as\nher hand reached out to take the book out of its spot, another hand clamped\naround her wrist. Her body flinched, and her heart pounded against her chest.\nWhen she finally registered who the person was, she let out a sigh of relief. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Seokjin, you gave me such a\nfright.&rdquo; She mumbled as she held the book close to her chest. </p><p>Seokjin\nstared blankly at her; an unreadable expression graced his handsome face.</p><p>Sumin\neyed him with pure concern, &ldquo;Are you okay, my beloved? I actually needed to\nhave a word with you.&rdquo; </p><p>Moments\nof silence passed them by as the two of them remained still, staring at each\nother. Sumin could hear her heart beat against her chest. Her breathing was\nhard as her breasts heaved up and down with each gasp for air she took. </p><p>Suddenly,\nSeokjin grabbed her wrist and pulled towards an unoccupied area of the library.\nThe roughness of his actions alarmed Sumin. Never once, in her years of knowing\nhim, has she ever seen him do this. The cold exterior of his facial expression.\nThe iron grip around her petite wrist. What was gotten into him? </p><p>Before\nshe could even ask him that important question, she felt her back hit against a\nbookshelf as Seokjin, without warning, captured her innocent lips. His hand\ncupped her jaw roughly as he forcibly darted his tongue into her mouth. His\nchest pressed firmly against hers as he made sure she couldn&rsquo;t leave him. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\neyes remained opened as she suddenly felt fear within her heart. Seeing her\nloving knight become this rough, forceful person scared her. Was this the\nemotion of jealously that her mother spoke to her about? If it was, she did not\nlike it whatsoever. </p><p>She\nquickly broke the passionate kiss but instead of having the opportunity to have\na serious discussion about his insecurities and had no reason to be jealous,\nSumin felt her neck being attacked. She felt his teeth graze against the\nsoftness of her skin as his hands trailed down the sides of her torso. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You are mine. You are my princess&hellip;&rdquo;\nSeokjin muttered darkly as he eyed all the unmarked territory of her neck. </p><p>Something\nabout that sentence sent shivers throughout her entire body. The tiny hairs on\nher neck stood up as goosebumps appeared one by one. </p><p>A sigh\nof content slowly left her lips as she couldn&rsquo;t help but submit to him. She\nwhispered a yes as her skirt slowly lifted up. </p><p>His\nhands trailed up and down her milky thighs and just as his fingers neared her\naching core, the two heard a familiar voice speak to Sumin&rsquo;s mother. </p><p>Sumin\nimmediately snapped back to reality and pushed Seokjin away. She smoothed out\nthe wrinkles in her dress and then undid her braided bun. She ruffled it up and\npositioned it around her neck, hoping that her luscious locks would cover up\nher marked-up neck. The last thing she needed was to have King Ji Yong\nquestioning where she got those love bites. Though&hellip; why should she care if the\narrogant king saw them or not? Maybe if he did, then he would leave her alone\nonce and for all. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I found the princess.&rdquo; Ji Yong\nemerged from a poorly lit section of the library. &ldquo;And she is with her loyal\nknight.&rdquo; He said through clenched teeth as he eyed their questionable\nappearances. He then walked past the possessive knight and stood in front of\nthe flustered princess, anchoring his hands on her hip bones. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\neyes flashed towards Seokjin briefly, feeling her heart ache for him. She had\nto pretend to be civil with the king, but that may entail some polite flirting.\n</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I have seen that you found me. Does\nhis majesty of someone following me?&rdquo; She teased, smiling sweetly at the king. </p><p>Ji Yong\nchuckled as he tapped her nose playfully, &ldquo;Your playful words wound me,\nPrincess Sumin. Believe it or not, but I actually pay attention when you speak\nto me. I recalled you saying that you were going to the library with your\nmother after supper, but I noticed the two of you walk towards there minutes\nago.&rdquo; He then took her hand and gently placed a kiss on her knuckles. &ldquo;So, I\ndecided to follow you here and see if there were any good books to read.&rdquo; </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled, covering her mouth with her free hand as she did. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I guess I am all yours for\nthe evening. Of course, if my knight is allowed to accompany us.&rdquo; She said; her\neyes shifting from the king to her precious lover. </p><p>Seokjin\nsmiled and bowed his head, &ldquo;If my princess wishes my presence, then I will\nhappily oblige her request.&rdquo; </p><p>Her\nheart skipped a beat hearing him say such a sentence with nothing but love in\nhis tone of voice. </p><p>Ji Yong\nclenched his jaw, hiding his irritation that her lap dog was going to be with\nthem. Then, out of nowhere, a devious idea popped into his brain. If the knight\nwas going to be a pest, then he might as well return the favor. Ji Yong wasn&rsquo;t\nna&iuml;ve. He knew there was some sort of bond between the princess and the knight.\nHowever, he decided to wait it out to make sure that his assumptions were\nright. If his assumptions were right, then it was time to switch tactics. If Ji\nYong wanted to successfully win Sumin&rsquo;s hand in marriage, then he needed to\neliminate the competition. Now, the fun question was&mdash; how? For now, he was just\ngoing to keep his eye on the knight and study his movements. </p><p>Out of\nthe corner of her eye, Sumin noticed Ji Yong&rsquo;s face gradually close the gap.\nHer heart tightened as she witnessed a familiar action.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Permit me to kiss you, Princess\nSumin.&rdquo; Ji Yong said softly as his eyes flickered towards her lips.</p><p>Frozen\nand unsure what to do, Sumin remained silent. </p><p>Taking\nher silence as a good sign, Ji Yong cupped her cheek and closed the tiny gap\nbetween their lips. His lips pressed firmly against hers as he tilted his head\nto gain a better position. </p><p>Seokjin&rsquo;s\neyes widened instantly. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sick to his stomach as he was\nforced to witness the love of his life kiss someone else. His hands unknowingly\nballed into fists as they began to tremble. This hot feeling surged throughout\nhis body as Seokjin&rsquo;s breathing grew rapid. He quickly tried to calm his\nemotions, not wanting to assault the evil king, however, his blind rage was\ngetting the best of him. His heart was breaking with each passing moment of\nthem passionately kissing. Seokjin was living his worst nightmare. </p><p>Just as\nhe about to interrupt the &ldquo;lovers&rdquo;, Seokjin heard the sound of footsteps coming\ntowards their direction. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Daughter, it is time for&mdash; oh! I am\nso sorry. I did not mean to intrude on your private moment with King Ji Yong.&rdquo;\nThe queen quickly looked away; her cheeks becoming a pinkish tint. </p><p>Hearing\nher mother&rsquo;s voice caused Sumin to roughly push the bold king away from her.\nShe quickly wiped her poor lips, hoping that the taint would disappear. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You were not intruding mother as\nthere was no private moment between the two of us.&rdquo; Sumin said angrily; her\neyes suddenly cold.</p><p>Ji Yong\nsnorted softly but quickly bowed his head apologetically. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My apologies for offending her\nroyal highness. I did not mean to let my emotions get carried away. Please\nforgive me, Princess Sumin.&rdquo; He said with uttermost sincerity in his voice. </p><p>Sumin\nnarrowed her eyes at the king; her face still cold as ice. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You are forgiven, my lord but\nplease understand me when I say that I can no longer accompany you to the\ngarden after supper. I need some time to myself after this ordeal.&rdquo; She told\nhim. </p><p>Ji Yong\nraised his head and then nodded, &ldquo;Of course, my lady. Again, I am sorry for\noffending you. Excuse me. I am going to change before we dine together.&rdquo; He\nturned away to leave. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at his retreating backside until he was no longer in sight. She then\ndirected her eyes towards her knight, who was still seething from what happened\nprior. She closed her eyes briefly before asking her mother if she could have a\nword with her knight alone.</p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nmother eyed the two with concern, watching the idea of these to wedded fly\nfurther away and away. Jealousy was a scary emotion, and she silently prayed\nthat these two would successfully cross that obstacle. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do not take too long, daughter. The\nhead cook will announce that supper is ready soon.&rdquo; She told them before bowing\nher head and turning away to leave. </p><p>Now, it\nwas only the two of them in the library. The silence was eating them up alive\nas neither one of them wanted to be the first one to say something. Neither one\nof them wanted to accidentally spout something hurtful that it would be too late\nto take it back. Neither one of them wanted to say goodbye.</p><p>Taking\na deep breath and slowly releasing it, Sumin gathered enough courage and looked\nSeokjin straight in the eye. A small yet warm smile graced her face as she took\na step forward, closing the gap between their bodies. Once she was close\nenough, she placed a loving hand on his cheek and lightly caressed it. </p><p>Feeling\nher warm embrace caused the knight to sigh in content. Just by one action, he\nfelt all the love she had for him, and that eased his worried heart. </p><p>He\nleaned into her touch as he finally returned the gaze he was receiving. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you love him, Sumin?&rdquo; He finally\nasked the question that was plaguing his mind. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt the urge to laugh at such a question. The idea of her even remotely liking\nthe invading king was laughable. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What? Of course not. Where on Earth\ndid you get such a silly idea?&rdquo; She smiled sweetly at him. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as he gently took her hand off his cheek, but still held it in\nhis hand. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I have seen the way you smile and\nlaugh at his words. It is almost the same way you do with me.&rdquo; He paused,\ntaking yet another deep breath. &ldquo;I am honestly confused and completely\nterrified of the idea of you being his wife and not mine.&rdquo; Seokjin confessed,\nfeeling a tiny weight lift off his heart. </p><p>Instead\nof replying with words, Sumin simply smiled before grabbed his face and pulling\nhim in the most passionate and loving kiss. She poured her entire heart into\nthe kiss, hoping that, once and for all, he will know that it was him that she\nloved. It was him that she had countless of dreams and fantasies of them being\nwedded. It was him that she imagined ruling by her side. It was him that had\nher body and soul under lock and key. It was always him. </p><p>Minutes\nlater, she finally pulled away, revealing a smile of content. &nbsp;Seokjin returned the loving smile as he was\ngrateful that her love for him never wavered. It was just his insecurities\ngetting the best of him. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Now, do you believe me, my beloved?\nI could never love another as much as I love you.&rdquo; She confessed; her cheeks\nglowed bright red. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled into his chest, resting his head on top of hers, &ldquo;I do. I am extremely\nsorry for doubting you, Sumin.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It is quite alright, my love. Now,\nI believe it is time for supper, and I am thinking of announcing to my father\nthat I changed my mind yet again on the idea of us marrying so soon.&rdquo; She said\nto him as she interlocked their fingers and proceeded to walk out of the\nlibrary.</p><p>Seokjin\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle at her words. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You do know that your father is\ngoing to grow tired of us going back and forth between marrying as soon as\npossible and waiting for a year or two.&rdquo; He added, earning himself a playful\nglare from his princess. </p><p>Sumin\nmocked his town, &ldquo;Well, do you want to talk to him and inform him that we\nchanged our mind again?&rdquo; </p><p>Seokjin\nrubbed his nose against her cheek sweetly and said no. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Then do not tease me, my dear\nknight!&rdquo; Sumin poked his cheek as the two neared the entrance of the dining\nroom. </p><p>Seokjin\nsimply laughed in response, &ldquo;I would never, my sweet princess.&rdquo; He then\nuntwined their fingers. &ldquo;Now, enjoy supper. If you are good princess and tell\nyour father about our decision, then I might visit your chambers this evening.&rdquo;\nHe whispered the last part in her ear. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt a rush of pleasure as soon as he whispered that. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe if you are good knight and\nbehave while King Ji Yong is doing his best to antagonize you, then I might let\nyou.&rdquo; She teased back, smiling alluring at the knight as she walked away. </p><p>Seokjin\ncould have sworn he felt his crotch area tightened. The thought of them being\nalone and intimate in her chambers sent his hormones into a wild frenzy. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nfor them, someone else was listening in on their conversation. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;A midnight rendezvous? We shall see\nabout that, my dear princess.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Don&rsquo;t hate it when you write a villain so evil that you end up hating him and want him to back the fuck off from my main characters&hellip;?

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart&rsquo;s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p>\n<p><small>&#8251; <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a><br /></small></p>\n<p><small>&#8251; <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><i>Chapter 4: Please Don&rsquo;t Fall in Love with Him</i></h2>\n</p>",
