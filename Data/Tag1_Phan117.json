In the dream, he\u2019d been lying in a bed of squishy dough, warm and snug in a toasty oven. Every so often, the door of the oven would open, and Phil\u2019s big, sunny face would peer through the crack to check on him, his broad smile big and soothing as gazed in at Dan, slowly baking away.<b><br/></b></p><p>As the barks rouse him, he frowns, rather worried about his brain. Who dreams about being baked, and enjoys it?</p><p>He realises that he\u2019s stiflingly hot, buried beneath several layers of quilt, which explains the dream a little more. As he pushes the covers away, he realises that there\u2019s something heavy draped over his waist, and turns, surprised, to see Phil laying beside him, his glasses on, skewed on his nose.</p><!-- more --><p>Dan looks down at his own body, and realises that he and Phil are both fully dressed. They must have fallen asleep cuddling on his bed. Which means, Dan thinks, connecting the dots, that the barking is Buffy.</p><p>Smiling to himself, Dan moves a little closer to Phil, placing a hand on his chest. His heartbeat is slow and steady, lost as he is to dream, still. Just because he can, Dan presses a kiss to Phil\u2019s lips, letting himself linger against them. There\u2019s a hint of stubble on Phil\u2019s chin, scritching pleasantly at Dan\u2019s skin. He hums into the kiss, enjoying himself thoroughly.</p><p>It\u2019s at that moment that Phil\u2019s eyes peel open, blinking in astonishment as he takes in the sight of Dan, close and kissing him, in his bed.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2026 Dan,\u201d Phil says, frowning. He leans backwards, and reaches up to remove his glasses. There are red, deep set marks where the frames have dug into his nose and cheek. Dan wants to run his fingers over them, to kiss them each in turn. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\u2026 is it morning?\u201d</p><p>Phil turns, blearily, and stares out of the window at the early light filtering in. Then, he curses, sharp and urgent, sitting up abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dan asks, sitting up with him.</p><p>How could anything be wrong, right now? He woke up in Phil\u2019s arms. This day is already the most perfect in creation.</p><p>Phil turns to him, obviously panicked, and grabs his phone. When he sees the screen, he curses again. He looks at Dan, alarmed. \u201cDan, it\u2019s Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>It takes Dan a moment, and then his eyes grow round and wide, matching Phil\u2019s. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you fell asleep on me, I told myself I\u2019d just watch the end of the episode and then I\u2019d take you home, but I was so sleepy and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Dan asks, trying to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cEight thirty-three,\u201d Phil answers, checking his phone again.</p><p>It\u2019s not really the time to be thinking it, but Dan can\u2019t help notice how good Phil looks, with his messy bed hair and rumpled clothes. He replays the moment before he must have dozed off last night, when Phil\u2019s hand had inched its way into his jeans as Buffy Summers kicked the ass of a demonic creature in the background.</p><p>It had been, in Dan\u2019s opinion, a handjob worthy of a Nobel Prize. It had also, apparently, wiped them both out.</p><p>\u201cDan, did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>Phil lets out a frustrated little groan, then seizes Dan\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cDan, you\u2019re very cute and everything, but we need to get up. I\u2019m usually at work by eight-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan says, trying as hard as he can not to get lost in the infinity pools of Phil\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah, shit, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Phil leans in and presses a rather cruelly brief kiss to his lips, then swings his legs out of the bed. As he watches Phil flitting around the room, peeling off his jumper with one hand, grabbing for his shoes with the other, a realisation washes over Dan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t have my work clothes,\u201d he says, trying hard not to panic.</p><p>Phil turns to him, chest bare. He looks at the shirt in his hand, a purple and black plaid number that he\u2019s plucked from the wardrobe. He throws it at Dan without hesitation, then dives back into the wardrobe to find another.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Phil says, pulling on a dark blue shirt now, covered in little corgis. \u201cHurry up though, we need to leave in like ten minutes if we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, deciding to swallow his desire to ask for a different, plainer shirt. He can suck up wearing some colour for one day. He pulls off the Sunnydale High jumper Phil lent him yesterday, and slips Phil\u2019s shirt on. He catches Phil looking, a fleeting glance at the revealed skin, and smirks.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Mr Lester, I will not be ogled.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles, sitting on the bed to pull on his socks. When he\u2019s finished, he leans over and kisses Dan on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you wear my things,\u201d he says. Dan\u2019s face heats immediately, making Phil laugh and poke him. \u201cWish I could just drag you back into bed, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to say that if you want me to hurry up,\u201d Dan complains as Phil stands up again, ducking out of the room.</p><p>\u201cStop being so pretty then,\u201d he calls from somewhere else in the house.</p><p>Dan sighs, wondering how on earth this day is going to pan out considering the rollercoaster of a weekend he\u2019s had. As he mulls over the idea of working alongside Phil, in the classroom, listening to him teach in that eclectic way of his, Dan\u2019s stomach begins to flip.</p><p>How is he going to be able to hide his feelings for Phil, now? The activities they\u2019ve indulged in this weekend are written across his face, surely. Does Phil even intend for them to hide this - whatever this is? He\u2019d said last night that he had a plan that would solve everything, but can that be true?</p><p>Just as this latter thought begins to grow monstrous, evil fangs, poising itself above Dan, ready to sink its teeth in, Phil wanders back into the room. His hair has been tamed somewhat, and there\u2019s a smudge of toothpaste in the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The monster recoils, blinded by Phil\u2019s brilliant radiance. The idea of kissing the speck of toothpaste off of Phil\u2019s mouth is incredibly calming, so Dan gets up, walks over, and does exactly that.</p><p>Phil smiles at him, but there\u2019s a modicum of panic, still, behind his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve let Buffy out quickly and poured her some food,\u201d he says, probably more to himself than anything, Dan thinks. \u201cI don\u2019t have a spare toothbrush I\u2019m afraid, but maybe you could-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan says, trying to sound reassuring despite the anxiety monster still lurking behind him somewhere. \u201cI have some gum in my coat.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs; the sound of it never fails to put Dan at ease. \u201cNice. Okay, I\u2019ll go get Buffy back in, and then we should go. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods. Phil lets out a relieved sigh, and heads out of the room.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan has just closed the passenger door of the car when Phil gasps, turning to Dan, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cThe madeleines!\u201d He hops straight out again, running towards the house full pelt. Dan snorts with laughter, rolling his eyes. They\u2019re already ridiculously late, but God forbid the Year Nine\u2019s don\u2019t receive their baked goods.</p><p>He returns a minute later with two cake tins, one under each arm. As he slips into the driver\u2019s seat, he deposits them on Dan\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cNo snacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t had breakfast,\u201d Dan says, pouting.</p><p>Phil wavers, looking torn. \u201cOkay, you can have one, but you have to share it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Dan says, laughing, and delves into one of the tins.</p><p>He feeds Phil bits of the madeleine as they drive along. Mercifully, the school traffic doesn\u2019t seem particularly bad this morning, and they get there in under ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cEight fifty-one,\u201d Dan says, huffing an impressed laugh. \u201cChrist, I can\u2019t believe we made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was stressful,\u201d Phil says, glancing at his reflection in the rearview mirror. He tuts at whatever he sees, playing with his side fringe and frowning.</p><p>Dan takes hold of his hand, stilling the movements. \u201cYou look irritatingly gorgeous, Phil. Just like every morning.\u201d</p><p>Phil squeezes Dan\u2019s hand, smiling warmly. He holds Dan\u2019s gaze, thumb stroking softly across his knuckle.</p><p>A rap on Dan\u2019s window startles them both. Phil drops Dan\u2019s hand like it\u2019s burning, but it\u2019s too late. The expression on John\u2019s face as he stares through the glass is not a happy one.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Phil hisses under his breath, echoing Dan\u2019s sentiments exactly.</p><p>He rolls down the window, making Dan\u2019s heart race wildly. Could they not just drive away? Speed off into the horizon with their hands linked again, like a male version of Thelma and Louise?</p><p>\u201cMr Howell, Mr Lester,\u201d John greets them coldly. \u201cWould you mind getting out of the car, please?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Given the time restrictions, John tells them both to report to his office at break time. From his tone of voice, Dan highly doubts it\u2019s for a chat over tea and biscuits.</p><p>There\u2019s a decidedly morose atmosphere as Phil hands out the madeleines to the students of their first class. The students seem to pick up on the air of dread that hangs above their teachers\u2019 heads, and murmur to each other quietly, devoid of their usual enthusiasm for Phil\u2019s class. So as not to exacerbate an already bad situation, Dan tries his best not to be too obvious about his and Phil\u2019s dalliance in front of the kids.</p><p>He tries, but they\u2019re not stupid.</p><p>\u201cDid you pop round to Mr Lester\u2019s house just to borrow his shirt this morning, sir?\u201d Matthew asks as Dan is helping him shade a portion of the Arc du Triomphe (they\u2019re continuing with the mural). \u201cOr did he bring it in specially, \u2018cause he thought it\u2019d match your eyes?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, about to deflect this question with something irrelevant, when a voice interrupts him.</p><p>\u201cCram it, Matt. People have the same shirts as other people. Shocker.\u201d</p><p>Dan lifts his eyes to meet Jonah\u2019s as discreetly as he can, sending him a small smile of gratitude. Jonah winks subtly as Matthew rolls his eyes.</p><p>Around half an hour into the lesson, Dan wanders over to Phil, mostly because he cannot help himself. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying not to think about it,\u201d Phil mutters under his breath. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitting myself,\u201d Dan sighs, the butterflies in his stomach reforming in their chrysalises. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a chance we can convince him we were just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding hands in prayer?\u201d Phil asks, bitterly. \u201cPlatonically arriving together, late, with you in my clothes? Oh yeah, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll buy that.\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks, a little taken aback by Phil\u2019s unusual sarcasm. \u201cI guess when you put it that way\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil seems to catch on to the glimmer of hurt in Dan\u2019s voice, because he sighs, linking their little fingers together, out of sight of the kids. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m just worried. I didn\u2019t mean to take it out on you. I get kind of\u2026 moody when I\u2019m stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly it\u2019s pretty hot,\u201d Dan confesses, squeezing Phil\u2019s finger. It makes Phil smile a little, but it\u2019s short lived. \u201cIt might not be as terrible as we think, with John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this has happened already,\u201d Phil says, seeming to ignore Dan\u2019s attempt at reassurance. He looks skyward, shaking his head. \u201cI thought we could at least have a day or two of hiding it so I could figure something out\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, nodding. So there never was a plan, then. Phil had just been saying that to calm him down. It should probably make him annoyed, but it just seems incredibly sweet. Dan sends him a glance that he hopes speaks to this effect, and they both sigh, releasing their fingers.</p><p>\u201cThe kids seem to like the madeleines,\u201d Dan offers, casting a gaze around the classroom.</p><p>Though the students seem a little more subdued than normal, they are undoubtedly enjoying the pleasant atmosphere in here, nibbling on their freshly baked cakes while they colour their favourite scenes of Paris. They lounge about the floor in little groups, chatting quietly, models of behaviour.</p><p>Dan is glad they\u2019re so calm this morning. He\u2019s not sure he could handle any pep.</p><p>\u201cWell, I had a great baking assistant,\u201d Phil says, making Dan smile.</p><p>\u201cPlease, all I did was watch in silent admiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to remember you did a little more than that.\u201d</p><p>Dan splutters, throwing him a dirty look. \u201cSo not the time.\u201d</p><p>Phil just laughs. \u201cJust trying to lighten the mood.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>The door to the Vice Principal\u2019s office is dark green. Fitting, Dan thinks as he stares at the nameplate tacked onto the outside. He checks his phone for the time.</p><p>10:59am.</p><p>He\u2019d kind of hoped he\u2019d run into Phil outside, and that they\u2019d be able to exchange a quick, reassuring look, but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he\u2019s been held up after his second class, and is running late. Whatever the reason, Dan knows it would only make things worse if he were late to this meeting, so he takes a deep breath, and knocks on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Mr Howell,\u201d John\u2019s voice calls.</p><p>It confuses Dan for a moment. How does John know that it\u2019s him? He pushes open the door, his eyebrows lifting as he notes that Phil is already inside, sat on one of the two chairs in front of John\u2019s desk.</p><p>Both he and John turn to face him, and he closes the door behind himself with a small click, feeling like a zoo animal. How long has Phil been here?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Dan says, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>He moves to the seat beside Phil, perching on it awkwardly, heart pounding. Phil catches his eye, giving him a small smile. Dan drinks it in gratefully.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr Howell.\u201d John\u2019s tone of voice is grim. \u201cThank you for coming. Now that you\u2019re both here, I\u2019ll get straight to the point.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, his fingernails digging into his clammy palms. He wishes he could reach across and grab ahold of Phil\u2019s hand, but obviously that would be a pretty bad idea. Instead, he imagines he\u2019s back at Phil\u2019s house, still, beneath the covers beside him, their limbs tangled, their bodies sinking into his soft mattress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s come to the attention of myself and several other staff members that the two of you have violated the terms of your employment,\u201d John says, his fingers lacing together on his desk. \u201cWhilst I hesitate to think of the two of you as being unprofessional, it has come to light that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, can we cut the work jargon and talk properly?\u201d Phil interrupts, his voice so grave that Dan barely recognises it. He blinks at Phil in surprise, mildly concerned about how John might respond. \u201cWe all know why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>John leans back in his chair, sighing loudly. He holds Phil\u2019s gaze for a while, and then nods.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cPhil, Daniel, I\u2019m not going to sugar coat this. There\u2019s substantial evidence that the two of you are romantically involved, and as you are both aware, employee relationships are prohibited in this institution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dan didn\u2019t know,\u201d Phil argues. \u201cHe was rushed through the training programme, he\u2019s still new here. He couldn\u2019t have known such a specific rule unless he was told-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may have been initially true,\u201d John says, his voice a little louder now. \u201cBut as you assured me, Phil, you informed him of the rule after I spoke with you on Tuesday. Yet the two of you have chosen to ignore this, and continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d Dan jumps in, realising a second too late that this perhaps isn\u2019t particularly wise.</p><p>He had no idea of the evidence amounted against them. Jonah could have said anything; Dan doesn\u2019t know for sure. </p><p>\u201cDan, there\u2019s no point-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aside from the majority of the student body passing around gossip of what occurred during the Paris trip,\u201d John begins, silencing Phil before he can get the words out. \u201cThere is the fact that the two of you arrived together this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a crime!\u201d Dan points out.</p><p>\u201cHolding hands in the school parking lot, dressed in each other\u2019s clothes\u2026 Dan, that in itself is enough to prompt speculation amongst the students, which is precisely the reason for the rule in the first place.\u201d John, to his credit, sounds apologetic about his own words. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford this kind of distraction to their learning, particularly when it comes to your class, Mr Lester. You achieve the best history results in the entire school, to have those grades reduce due to your inability to focus on anything but your TA would be catastrophic for the school\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll quit,\u201d Phil says calmly.</p><p>Dan whips his head round to Phil in lightning speed. \u201cWhat? Phil, don\u2019t be crazy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, please,\u201d Phil says, his voice low and quiet. He meets Dan\u2019s gaze, eyes shining with such certainty that Dan slumps in his seat, already feeling defeated. Phil turns back to John, arms folded. \u201cJohn, this rule is antiquated and ridiculous, as you are well aware. I checked my contract, and the rule was implemented in 1957. It\u2019s absurd to think that the same conditions apply now, especially in a case like this, where Dan and I only work together twice a week, for an hour at a time.\u201d</p><p>John, looking a little flustered by Phil\u2019s threat of quitting, wipes a hand across his brow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with you, Phil,\u201d he confesses. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not my decision. I can\u2019t bend the rules just because we\u2019re friends, and I certainly can\u2019t look the other way - not when the students are discussing it all day like it\u2019s a damned television romance-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Phil presses, ignoring John entirely. Dan feels his chest swell with something like pride, watching Phil remain perfectly composed, laying out his argument clearly. \u201cDan has been my assistant since the beginning of term. Whilst our\u2026 mutual feelings have only just been acknowledged,\u201d Phil glances at Dan, smiling very slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019s been \u2018distracting\u2019 me for the whole of that time. Yet if you\u2019ll check my Year Nine and Year Eight class results, you\u2019ll notice that they\u2019re better than ever before. Because Dan is an asset, not a hindrance. He is an excellent TA, probably the best I\u2019ve ever had, helped by the fact that we are so in sync. Our romantic relationship, if anything, makes us stronger as a teaching unit, and allows us to be the best team for the students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do work well together,\u201d Dan agrees quietly. \u201cThe kids all say our lessons are the ones they look forward to, and learn from, the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, if you honestly think that Dan and I being together affects the students negatively, then I\u2019m afraid I will have no choice but to hand in my notice.\u201d Phil\u2019s announcement is like a bomb dropping. A hush falls over the office; even Dan\u2019s hands tighten on the arms of his chair. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to work in such discriminative conditions after I have proven myself to be an excellent teacher here. My relationship to Dan has not affected my performance. I am not prepared to allow my career to interrupt\u2026\u201d he trails off, eyes fixing themselves on Dan\u2019s face. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence, and then John sighs. \u201cPhil, I need you to be completely clear about this. If you are really willing to stake your job on a budding relationship, I advise you to think carefully-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, please, it\u2019s okay, we should talk about-\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, cutting Dan off. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>John looks at him for a long moment, seeming to deliberate. \u201cAlright. Well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that you\u2019re an extremely valuable member of the faculty, Mr Lester. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the school would do a great deal to prevent your departure. Allow me to discuss your ultimatum with the Principal, and we\u2019ll see if we can come to a conclusion of sorts.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes widen. Could John be offering a glimmer of hope?</p><p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d Phil says, moving to stand from his chair. \u201cDan and I will wait for your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d John says, nodding. \u201cI\u2019m promising absolutely nothing, boys. Rules are rules, and you have broken one. I\u2019ll be in touch. In the meantime\u2026 try and behave professionally, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, John,\u201d Phil says dismissively, standing from his chair.</p><p>Dan follows him, legs shaky, and nods at John, who is already dialling his phone. Phil makes a point of holding the door open for him, something that doesn\u2019t escape John\u2019s notice. Dan walks out quietly, and tries to comprehend what on earth just happened. </p><p>*</p><p>As soon as they step out of John\u2019s office, they\u2019re ambushed.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t get a chance to speak to Phil about what he\u2019d said inside, as before he can get the words out, Jonah Frank is in front of them, flanked by Bethany and Savannah, their faces anxious.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in VP Green\u2019s office, sirs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jonah,\u201d Dan says, glancing at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is the time\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just having a meeting, guys,\u201d Phil tells them vaguely. \u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about you guys hookin\u2019 up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jonah asks, making Dan roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jonah,\u201d he says under his breath.</p><p>He supposes it doesn\u2019t matter if the whole corridor hears now, however. The students apparently discuss the idea of he and Phil as a couple freely, despite their efforts to hide things.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool, Mr Howell,\u201d Savannah says. \u201cBeth and I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys\u2026 we can\u2019t discuss things with you, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil cuts in, perpetually the voice of reason. He always knows what to say. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know what happens if it gets to that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so it\u2019s true, then?\u201d Jonah\u2019s face is alarmed. \u201cYou guys could be canned?\u201d</p><p>Dan and Phil exchange a glance. Phil seems to deliberate on his wording. \u201cThere\u2019s a\u2026 possibility of suspension, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit\u2026\u201d Jonah says; the girls cover their mouths with their hands. \u201cThis is all my fault. I should\u2019a just kept my mouth shut. I didn\u2019t think VP Green\u2019d actually sack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did we,\u201d Dan mutters.</p><p>\u201cJonah, don\u2019t blame yourself for anything that might happen,\u201d Phil tells him firmly. \u201cNothing is certain anyway, but even if it ended up that Mr Howell or I lost our jobs, it would be the result of our own actions, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sake, I hate this place,\u201d Jonah spits, glaring at VP Green\u2019s closed door. \u201cThe only good thing about it is you an\u2019 your class, Mr Lester. And now that might be gone, too.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings then, and Dan sighs, resolving to discuss the meeting with Phil later. He gives Phil a grim smile, waggling his fingers at him, and takes a deep breath, about to start off towards the Science Block. Before he can take a step however, Jonah speaks again.</p><p>\u201cOi, sirs, I\u2019m gonna fix it, yeah?\u201d He says, looking fearsome. \u201cLeave it to me, I got you into trouble I know - but I\u2019m good at gettin\u2019 out of it.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiles fondly, finding his surety very touching. \u201cSweet of you to try, Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you just have to let things unfold, Jonah,\u201d Phil tells him wisely, then waves goodbye, walking briskly off towards his own classroom.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t get a chance to speak to Phil about what happened until lunch. He finds Phil in the staffroom making coffee, dark circles under his eyes. When he sees Dan approach, he offers him the cup he\u2019s just made straight away, and turns back to the pot to pour another.</p><p>Dan\u2019s opening line dies on his lips, touched by the small gesture. \u201cHow are you?\u201d He asks instead. </p><p>Phil offers him a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been better, honestly.\u201d</p><p>Dan shuts his eyes, sighing into his coffee. \u201cPhil\u2026 why did you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get them to listen,\u201d Phil says before Dan can get the words out. \u201cThe rule is stupid and pointless. Even if I have to walk over this, the system is oppressive and needs to change. This could force their hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a risk, Phil. I should be the one to leave, not you.\u201d</p><p>Phil peers over his freshly made cup, a smirk on his lips. \u201cNo offence, Dan, but I don\u2019t think you walking out would quite carry the same weight. You\u2019ve been here a couple of months. I\u2019ve been here for two years.\u201d</p><p>In his heart, Dan knows that what Phil is saying makes sense. Even so, the idea of Phil quitting his job, which he loves, deeply, just for him - it\u2019s too much. Too big of a sacrifice. Dan isn\u2019t worth that kind of gesture. </p><p>\u201cThis is so unfair,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He can feel himself getting choked up out of frustration, tears stinging in his eyes. He knows it\u2019s just because he\u2019s overtired and stressed, but it\u2019s still embarrassing, having Phil see. Luckily for him, Phil is the most wonderful creation in the universe, so he puts down his coffee and ushers Dan into the staff bathroom.</p><p>Safely sealed inside the private space, Phil pulls Dan into his arms, wrapping him up tightly. He kisses Dan\u2019s forehead, rocking gently as Dan struggles to hold himself together.</p><p>\u201cNe t'inqui\u00e8te pas,\u201d he whispers. \u201cJe te tiens.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>They don\u2019t hear from John for the rest of the day. Dan wanders into Phil\u2019s classroom just after the last bell, sitting down on one of the student\u2019s desks with a sigh. Phil watches him while he tidies some things away on his desk, smiling sadly.</p><p>\u201cWanna come over for a while?\u201d</p><p>Dan thinks about it for a moment, then nods. \u201cI haven\u2019t brushed my teeth since Sunday morning. Just so you\u2019re aware before you get too hospitable.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles, wandering over to him. \u201cWe can pick you up a toothbrush on the way.\u201d</p><p>They both glance over at the classroom door, checking it\u2019s closed before they touch. Dan winds his arms around Phil\u2019s waist, resting his head on Phil\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cFor me to keep at your house?\u201d Dan asks into Phil\u2019s breastbone. \u201cNext thing you know I\u2019ll have a whole drawer there, Phil. Steady on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d happily give you a whole chest of drawers, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Dan lifts his head, staring at Phil with a frown. \u201cIt\u2019s only been like a week since you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon,\u201d Phil tells him, leaning in to kiss him very gently. \u201cJe te connais depuis toujours.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br/>um\u2026 are u dead</p><p><b>Dan</b><br/>only internally</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br/>are u ever coming home or</p><p><b>Dan</b><br/>no u guys pissed me off too much<br/>and im moving out baiii</p><p><b>Tyler<br/></b>ah, k. how is it in ur new home? dark?<br/>cramped?</p><p><b>Dan</b><br/>???</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br/>well i assume you\u2019ve now moved<br/>permanently into phil\u2019s ass</p><p><b>Dan</b><br/>TYLER HE FUCKING READ THAT<br/>I HATE U</p><p><b>Tyler<br/></b>miss u and ur screaming :( come home<br/>soon we have much to gossip about x</p><p><b>Dan</b><br/>i\u2019ll be home tonight or tomorrow xx</p><p>*</p><p>They\u2019re on Phil\u2019s sofa, Dan\u2019s head in Phil\u2019s lap, Buffy snoozing on Dan\u2019s chest, when a random thought occurs to him.</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>Dan stares up at him, the sharp cut of his jawline, stubbled and pretty, catching his eye.</p><p>\u201cYou said you have a tattoo.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches, almost imperceptibly. \u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>Thor is playing in the background on Phil\u2019s TV, but neither of them have been paying close attention. They\u2019ve both seen it before, and besides, Dan\u2019s far more interested in tracing the contours of Phil\u2019s pretty face with his eyes from below. Not to mention, Phil\u2019s hand has been in his hair for some time now, massaging gently. It\u2019s still curly from yesterday, as the kids had been all too gleeful to point out for the entire day.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes.\u201d Dan tries to sit up a little, but Buffy is having none of it. He rolls his eyes at her indignant expression, sinking back onto Phil\u2019s lap. \u201cOn the boat, when we were playing that game with the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh, strange,\u201d Phil says, that hint of a smile still playing on his lips.</p><p>Dan just stares at him. \u201cSo\u2026 do you, or don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a silence. Phil picks up his tea and takes a long drink of it, then places it carefully back on the arm of the sofa. His eyes drag slowly down to Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to find out.\u201d</p><p>Buffy squeals in indignation as she is pushed off Dan\u2019s chest, but he has no time to apologise to her. He climbs up onto Phil\u2019s lap in seconds, hands at the collar of his shirt immediately. Phil laughs at his eagerness, welcoming the kisses Dan plants on his lips.</p><p>It takes only a few seconds to get Phil\u2019s shirt open, but it feels like centuries go by. Dan tugs at it impatiently, yanking it over his shoulders and trying to shove it down his arms. Phil is laughing still, apparently finding Dan\u2019s efforts extremely amusing, but going along with it anyway.</p><p>It\u2019s his own fault, anyway, Dan thinks. He can\u2019t just dangle the prospect of a hidden tattoo in front of him without expecting to be ravished. He gasps as Phil\u2019s hands find his bum, moving Dan in closer with a strong, sharp pull. Dan wiggles in his lap, drawing away from Phil\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cHands off, I need to get you naked,\u201d Dan complains, frustrated. Phil is surprisingly strong.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get naked after,\u201d Dan explains impatiently, making Phil laugh.</p><p>It seems to do the trick though, as he releases his hold on Dan\u2019s bum, and allows the shirt to slip completely off his body. Dan sits back, surveying the exposed flesh. It\u2019s safe to say that Phil\u2019s chest and stomach are decidedly unblemished, and devoid of anything but miles of gorgeous, pale skin. Dan runs his fingers over it anyway, lifting each of Phil\u2019s arms and peering at them, dragging his lips down their lengths, shoulder to each fingertip.</p><p>When he\u2019s satisfied that neither arm is inked, he leans back again, catching sight of Phil\u2019s amused smile.</p><p>\u201cI might have to be extremely thorough,\u201d Dan warns him, entirely serious. \u201cI plan to leave no place unsearched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Detective Howell,\u201d Phil says, nodding sombrely. \u201cI completely understand.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Dan slips off Phil\u2019s lap and onto the floor, landing between his legs. He kneels up, reaching at once for Phil\u2019s belt and fly, wanting to waste no time. He\u2019s always had a weakness for tattoos. He\u2019s too scared to actually get one himself, too anxious of a person to trust his decision for such a permanent thing, but on other people - it\u2019s incredibly attractive.</p><p>If Phil really does possess a tattoo, Dan thinks as he slides Phil\u2019s jeans down his legs, it means there are all sorts of things about him that Dan doesn\u2019t know, potentially. The thought excites him. Will the tattoo be something tribal, to represent an aspect of Phil\u2019s personality? Will it be a memory, shared with someone Dan doesn\u2019t know? Will it be just a pattern Phil liked? Or a caricature of Justin Bieber on one of his buttcheeks?</p><p>Dan thinks he might\u2019ve noticed that last one before now, but he doesn\u2019t know for sure. He hadn\u2019t really been paying close attention to Phil\u2019s nether regions when they\u2019d been on display yesterday; Phil\u2019s actions had been\u2026 rather distracting, as he recalls.</p><p>Once Phil\u2019s jeans are off, Dan gets to work, taking Phil\u2019s leg and extending it out before inspecting it closely, pressing little kisses as he goes. He checks from ankle to thigh, even peering at the space behind Phil\u2019s knee.</p><p>He takes Phil\u2019s feet in his hand one at a time, peeling off the socks to check every toe.</p><p>\u201cKnew you had a foot fetish,\u201d Phil says, watching him with a grin.</p><p>Just to mess with him, Dan licks a stripe up the underside of his left foot, making him shriek. \u201cFor these babies, I might.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs, and Dan moves back to his former position, knelt between his legs on the floor.</p><p>\u201cGive up?\u201d Phil asks, a teasing lilt to his voice.</p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cAs if. I\u2019m just getting started, mate.\u201d</p><p>He trails his hands up Phil\u2019s thighs then, already drunk on the little gasping noise that slips from Phil\u2019s mouth. He hooks his fingers into the elastic of Phil\u2019s boxers, pulling them carefully down as Phil lifts his bum from the sofa.</p><p>As ever, the sight of him, naked and aroused, is enough to knock the air out of Dan\u2019s lungs. He can\u2019t help the tiny groan that falls from his lips, just as he can\u2019t stop himself leaning in and taking hold of Phil\u2019s length in one hand, and slipping his mouth over the tip.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he hears Phil say, making him shiver.</p><p>Phil is smooth and slick as Dan allows the length of him to slide into his mouth. He can feel his mouth being stretched wide, can feel the tip nudging the back of his throat. Dan swallows, moaning a little, his eyes fluttering as the taste of Phil filters through. He lets himself sink down, relishing the sensation Phil pushing so far inside.</p><p>He reaches down to palm himself through his jeans, just to relieve some of the pressure building up there. He starts to bob his head, letting Phil\u2019s breathy noises guide him into what\u2019s good and what isn\u2019t. He works his hand too, allowing his lips to meet the circle of his fist.</p><p>\u201cDan, baby, that\u2019s so\u2026 oh, fuck&hellip;.\u201d Phil is saying, babbling really.</p><p>After a while, Dan forces himself to pull off; Phil lets out an agonised cry. Dan wipes the corner of his mouth, smirking. \u201cHang on. I\u2019m still looking for something.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s responding groan is anguished, but Dan doesn\u2019t allow it to deter him. Instead, he grabs Phil\u2019s hands and pulls him down to his level, into his lap, so that Phil\u2019s legs straddle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a tease,\u201d Phil tells him, practically pouting.</p><p>Dan just grins. \u201cIt\u2019s payback for all the totally outside-the-rules flirting during school hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm, try every fucking day.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhatever, I hate you. Please just hurry up and find it.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows raise at this instruction, catching the implication that there is, at least, something to find. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a glimmer of something wicked in Phil\u2019s eyes, but he does so, carefully twisting around on Dan\u2019s lap. He leans forwards, arms braced against the sofa cushion in front of them both, sat on Dan\u2019s knees still, now with his back on show.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes rake down the canvas of Phil\u2019s skin; immediately he understands why he hadn\u2019t noticed the tattoo until now. It\u2019s low down, on Phil\u2019s left side, wrapped around the back of his hip.</p><p>Dan stares at it for a long time before reaching out to trace it, lightly, using just the tips of his fingers. He didn\u2019t realise tattoos this pretty existed. It\u2019s like a piece of art.</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d Dan observes, his finger edging along the skyline, drawn so neatly, so simply, into Phil\u2019s skin.</p><p>The thin line is unbroken, as if it\u2019s all connected, the outline of the Eiffel Tower joined to the Sacre Coeur, and the Moulin Rouge. It\u2019s minimalistic, to say the least, just one long, very thin black line, outlining the city.</p><p>It\u2019s incredibly beautiful. It seems to fit on Phil\u2019s body, resting delicately on his hip, as if he\u2019d been born with it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Phil sighs, the line of his shoulders shifting. \u201cClich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Dan leans his cheek against the space between Phil\u2019s shoulder blades, staring down at it across the desert of Phil\u2019s back. \u201cPhil, it\u2019s beautiful. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, and Dan leans up to kiss him. He wraps his arms around Phil\u2019s waist, dragging him backwards until they\u2019re back to chest. He can feel Phil\u2019s irregular breathing, and he treasures the sound, mentally saving it on a loop for when he\u2019s alone, and needs to remember how wrecked he can, somehow, make this man, scintillating as he is.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hands glide down Phil\u2019s chest and stomach, his chin tucked over one shoulder, pressing kisses at the base of his neck. He takes hold of Phil\u2019s erection, still full and proud, damp now from the anticipation, and starts stroking him gently.</p><p>Phil\u2019s head falls backwards, the base of his skull brushing Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDan\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTes mains se sentent incroyables,\u201d Phil croaks out.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand stops moving. \u201cWhat are you saying? It\u2019s not fair, I can\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>Phil turns his head to look Dan in the eye, clearly surprised. \u201cNothing, I\u2019m just\u2026 saying you feel good.\u201d</p><p>The answer frustrates him in its ambiguity. \u201cWill you translate for me, at least?\u201d</p><p>The crinkles around Phil\u2019s eyes deepen, and he smirks.. \u201cI said\u2026 your hands feel incredible.\u201d</p><p>Dan flushes immediately, caught off guard. \u201cO-oh.\u201d</p><p>Phil surges up and kisses him then, slow and teasing, licking against Dans lower lip. \u201cS\u2019il te plait\u2026 ne tu arrete pas.\u201d</p><p>Dan feels the goosebumps rip over his skin. \u201cWhat did you say then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said please don\u2019t stop,\u201d Phil says, and Dan bites his lip. As requested, he starts moving his hand again, and Phil\u2019s head flops backwards, eyes closing.</p><p>\u201cPhil&hellip;.\u201d Dan whispers, suddenly indescribably turned on, staring down over Phil\u2019s shoulder at the expanse of his naked body. \u201cWill you\u2026\u201d</p><p>He hesitates, and Phil opens one eye, a sliver of ice blue visible around the black hole of his pupil. \u201cWill I&hellip;?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing his embarrassment, Dan moves his mouth until his lips are brushing the shell of Phil\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cBaise-moi,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Phil grabs hold of Dan\u2019s wrist, stilling the movement around his erection. \u201cMon dieu, Daniel. Where did you learn\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan laughs a little, unwrapping his fingers from Phil\u2019s length, sensing he might be rather close to the edge as it is. If Dan\u2019s going to get what he wants, he needs to move quickly. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026 looking up some words and phrases. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>He hears Phil take a deep breath, and then he stands, chucking a mischievous glance over his shoulder at Dan as he sashays across the room towards his bedroom. Dan stares for a moment, mesmerised by the sight of his naked backside, the newly revealed tattoo resting above it, before he scrambles to his feet and runs after him.</p><p>Excited by Dan\u2019s brisk movements, Buffy trots along behind him, her tongue out, happily ignorant of the sin in front of her twitching nose. Dan reaches down to pat her, gently pointing her in the other direction. </p><p>He slips into Phil\u2019s room and quickly shuts the door on her, feeling bad, but knowing that it was necessary. </p><p>By the time Dan turns around, Phil is reclined on his bed, squeezing something clear and gel-like into his palm from a small purple bottle. Wanting to waste no time, Dan peels off the shirt Phil lent him, and unfastens his jeans, shimmying them off as he dives onto the bed.</p><p>Phil laughs at his eagerness, rolling them over so he\u2019s on top of Dan, eyes hooded. \u201cTu sembles impatient, ce soir.\u201d</p><p>Heart fluttering, Dan swats him gently in the shoulder. \u201cEnglish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d Phil growls, his fingers already sliding Dan\u2019s briefs down his thighs. \u201cYou seem impatient, this evening.\u201d</p><p>Dan feels the flush as it ripples down his throat. He shouldn\u2019t have asked. \u201cC-can you blame me?\u201d</p><p>Phil nips at the base of his neck, where there are already a bouquet of bruises, barely coverable by the shirts he wears to school. \u201cI quite like it, actually.\u201d</p><p>Before Dan can respond, Phil\u2019s hand is wrapping around his erection, slippery and warm, his fingers curling tightly as he slicks them up and down.</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d Dan moans, his hips bucking into Phil\u2019s fist. \u201cHoly fucking shit, Phil. Excuse my French.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorts with laughter.</p><p>All of a sudden, any ability to be funny slips away as Dan feels the fingers of Phil\u2019s other hand slipping between his cheeks, pressing firmly against his hole. He sucks in a breath, his body twitching in surprise. Phil just continues stroking up and down his length with one hand, his other fingers circling Dan\u2019s rim.</p><p>The over-stimulation might actually be enough to make him black out, Dan thinks vaguely.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan curses again, his hands winding into Phil\u2019s covers, pulling them free of the corners. \u201cOh God,\u201d he groans. \u201cPlease fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles again, but he sounds a little strung out, if Dan isn\u2019t mistaken. \u201cTu es trop pleurniches.\u201d He sighs, pushing his finger inside, making Dan groan. \u201cEt trop joli.\u201d Dan hits him in the shoulder again, making Phil laugh. \u201cI said you\u2019re so whiny.\u201d</p><p>Something seems off about Phil\u2019s translation, but it\u2019s hard to concentrate on that when Phil\u2019s finger is pressing so deeply into him, making him squirm. He continues pumping his hand over Dan\u2019s length too, which is dizzyingly hot, so Dan just writhes and whimpers, clinging to the bedsheets for dear life.</p><p>Phil is quick about opening him up, this time, for which Dan is grateful. There\u2019s still a slight burn, as he\u2019s far from used to this yet, but he would gladly endure ten times the pain for the experience of having Phil inside of him like before. Once he\u2019s three fingers deep, Phil crooks his fingers, deftly, seeming to know exactly how and where, and Dan chokes off a low, rumbling moan of ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cIci, mon ange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnngh, Phil talk in English, please,\u201d Dan begs, his face turning to burrow into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phil mutters, seeming to pause before translating this time. \u201cHere, Dan?\u201d He pushes against Dan\u2019s prostate again, making him yelp.</p><p>Yet again, Dan\u2019s not sure that Phil actually said that, but he doesn\u2019t have it in him to argue. So he just nods, biting down on his lip, possibly a little too hard.</p><p>Phil draws his hands free of Dan, eliciting a groan of anguish from him. Dan sits up, bewildered and affronted by this action. Phil just giggles at his expression, and picks up the bottle of lube from wherever he dropped it last. He holds it up to Dan in explanation.</p><p>\u201cHm, I hope I have some condoms in here,\u201d Phil mutters, reaching across to dig into his bedside drawer. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d Dan says, impatient. \u201cI\u2019ve never even done this with anyone but you. Are you clean?\u201d</p><p>Phil turns to him in surprise. He nods, pressing his lips together. \u201cI am,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut maybe- just to be sure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you Phil, Christ,\u201d Dan argues, kicking him in the leg. \u201cGet over here.\u201d</p><p>To Dan\u2019s sheer relief, Phil does as asked, crawling towards him. He kneels by Dan\u2019s legs, squeezing another dollop of lube onto his outstretched palm. As he rubs his fingers together, he drags his eyes over Dan\u2019s body; absurdly, it makes Dan blush.</p><p>\u201cTurn over,\u201d Phil instructs, sending a lance of hot, debilitating arousal through Dan\u2019s body.</p><p>His breaths become a little more difficult to catch, for some reason, and fall from his mouth in short, stuttery gasps as he rolls onto his stomach, desperate to obey Phil\u2019s command. He hears a slick sound, and imagines the sight of Phil\u2019s fist pumping over himself, covering his flushed erection with the lubricant. He feels Phil\u2019s hands on his hips, canting them upwards, so that Dan\u2019s face presses into the mattress.</p><p>His lungs tighten, face on fire as he thinks about how exposed he is. \u201cPh-phil, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Phil says; Dan feels him dragging the tip of his length over his rim, and his hips twitch in Phil\u2019s hands. \u201cYou\u2019re so good, Dan. So gorgeous. There\u2019s no word for how you look in French. Gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Dan directs his ragged breathing into the covers of Phil\u2019s bed. He feels the familiar burn of being stretched open as Phil pushes in, going slow again, one thumb stroking gently over his hipbone.</p><p>Nobody has ever called him anything other than \u2018hot\u2019 before. Stephanie used to call him cute sometimes, or tell him he looked sexy in a certain shirt, but \u2018gorgeous\u2019? That\u2019s a word he would never have associated with his appearance. It\u2019s a loaded word, heavier than beautiful, more charged with attraction, with want.</p><p>His cheeks burn. \u2018Gorgeous\u2019 is how Phil sees him, even like this.</p><p>He pushes his hips backwards, feeling Phil slip further inside. He can tell the movement takes Phil by surprise, because Phil\u2019s hands tighten on his hips, as if trying to slow him down. But Dan doesn\u2019t want to slow down. He wants Phil to wreck him, to split him apart with his face crushed into the green-blue of his bedspread.</p><p>He lifts his head, intending to tell Phil exactly this. \u201cYou can be rougher, if you want,\u201d he says, voice scratchy and weak. \u201cI won\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>A tiny moan spills from Phil\u2019s throat. It makes Dan smile, proud. \u201cTell me if I hurt you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it bad if I don\u2019t really mind?\u201d</p><p>The only answer Dan receives is a mildly strangled sound, followed by Phil thrusting his hips forwards so abruptly that Dan cries out. Immediately, Phil stills behind him, leaning forwards in alarm.</p><p>\u201cShit, did I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d Dan urges, reaching back blindly in order to grab one of Phil\u2019s thighs.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of hesitation, and then Phil is drawing back, sliding out of Dan before thrusting back in, slick and fast, the top of his thighs hitting Dan\u2019s buttocks with a slap. Then, he does it a third time. Dan\u2019s mouth falls open, pressing back into the sensation, rocking back into Phil\u2019s movements.</p><p>\u201cShit\u2026\u201d Phil says, setting up a rhythm now. \u201cI warn you, Dan, I\u2019m pretty close\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe- me too,\u201d Dan manages to stutter around the rough, lustful moans that refuse to stop bubbling out of his chest. \u201cFucking\u2026 Christ, Phil, fuck me, yeah\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe pourrais te baiser pour toujours, Dan,\u201d Phil garbles, obviously on the edge. His movements are erratic now, sloppier, with less control. \u201cTu es parfait, tu es parfait-\u201d</p><p>His own shout of ecstasy cuts him off, and Dan feels the warmth, the spasm, as Phil comes into him, pushing himself deeply as he spreads his chest against Dan\u2019s back. He bites Dan\u2019s shoulder, hips twitching; it\u2019s hands down the hottest thing Dan has ever experienced. He thrusts himself against the mattress, desperate for friction.</p><p>Suddenly, Phil is easing out of him, and Dan is being flipped over. Phil\u2019s tongue drags itself over his chest, down his stomach, and then a mouth is slipping over his straining erection, engulfing him entirely. It takes approximately three seconds before Dan is toppling into his climax, the force of it pushing an agonised scream from his throat. He\u2019s sure he momentarily glimpses infinity, sizzling around him in the form of a neon, pulsating nebula.</p><p>When he crashes back down to earth, Phil is draped over him, his nose just below Dan\u2019s ear, his arm slung across Dan\u2019s chest. Both of their chests are heaving - their exhaustion the only sound in the silent room.</p><p>After a moment, Dan can hear a faint scrabbling against the closed bedroom door. Poor Buffy, he thinks absently. She must be so jealous that Dan is stealing all of her father\u2019s attention.</p><p>Dan finds Phil\u2019s hand and winds their fingers together, both their palms damp with exertion.</p><p>\u201cAs far as distractions from things we\u2019re trying not to think about go,\u201d Dan says to the ceiling. \u201cThat was pretty good.\u201d</p><p>Phil lifts his head, looking affronted. \u201c\u2019Pretty good\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Dan laughs, breathless. \u201cIn this instance, \u2018pretty good\u2019 means the absolute best sex I\u2019ve ever had, ever.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles, satisfied, and rests his head back on Dan\u2019s shoulder, playing with his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know that even if we get sacked, we\u2019ll still be able to console ourselves with amazing sex, I guess,\u201d Dan jokes, but he can feel it falls flat against Phil\u2019s ears.</p><p>There\u2019s a silence.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get fired, Dan,\u201d Phil says softly. He\u2019s tracing up each of Dan\u2019s fingers in turn.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d stay working in a school that kicked out the only good teacher they\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Phil, don\u2019t,\u201d Dan says firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re the only reason that job is bearable. I couldn\u2019t work there if I couldn\u2019t see you every day. There\u2019s no way I could be professional. I wouldn\u2019t be able to smile at John, or have a coffee with him in the staffroom, knowing full well that he stole you away from me, for something so&hellip;. completely unfair.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s fingers trickle up and down his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t make you do anything, or not do anything. But you should think carefully. I can get another job. It would be harder for you. You don\u2019t have as much experience working in schools. We\u2019d make it work, still, even if I do end up having to quit. We can see each other after work, all the time. It might not be so bad.\u201d</p><p>Dan wriggles in Phil\u2019s arms, turning so they\u2019re laying face to face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work where you\u2019re not. That\u2019s so sad.\u201d</p><p>Phil reaches up to trace the curve of his face. \u201cI know, gorgeous.\u201d The tips of Dan\u2019s ears burn, still not used to hearing the endearment. \u201cI don\u2019t either. Mais c\u2019est la vie.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Phil is laying on his front, and Dan is appreciating the view. They\u2019ve been on his bed for some time now, talking about nothing as the light pouring through Phil\u2019s big windows fades into a softer, duller evening glow.</p><p>For what must be the hundredth time, Dan leans down to Phil\u2019s left hip, and presses his mouth to the tattoo he can\u2019t stop staring at. Just like every time, Phil\u2019s breath hitches, like he can\u2019t quite believe the sensation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so much prettier than I thought it would be,\u201d Dan confesses, making Phil giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think it would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ninja turtle? A portrait of Buffy\u2019s face? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffy as in my dog, or Sarah Michelle Gellar?\u201d</p><p>Dan considers this, laughing. \u201cEither. Both.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs then as well, gazing at Dan over his shoulder. Dan\u2019s fingers trace the Paris skyline once again, his face dreamy. \u201cYou really like it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A light blush peppers Dan\u2019s cheekbones, and he shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201d Phil looks curious, but says nothing. \u201cWhen did you get it?\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden, Phil\u2019s expression grows a little colder. He turns from Dan, averting his gaze. \u201cIn Paris. When I lived there.\u201d</p><p>Confused by the sudden change in atmosphere, Dan feels his curiosity perking up. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, trying to sound casual. \u201cOn your own, or\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil sighs, and he glances at Dan, conflicted. After a moment, he seems to relent. \u201cNo. Not alone.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, nonchalant. \u201cWas it\u2026 with that guy you mentioned? Your ex?\u201d The nod Phil gives him doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise, but it still winds a thick coil of jealousy around Dan\u2019s chest, squeezing so tightly that he coughs. \u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>Seeing straight through his attempt at remaining calm and collected, Phil laughs, reaching for Dan\u2019s hand. Dan lets him take it, feeling foolish. He has no right to be jealous of something that happened before he even knew Phil, he knows. It\u2019s not like this guy, whoever he is, is still around.</p><p>Still, as Dan stares at the tattoo, he can\u2019t help wondering how serious this past relationship must have been, or at least felt, for Phil to do something so permanent about it.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Phil tells him, rolling onto his back, rendering the tattoo invisible again. He tugs Dan towards him, until they\u2019re laying next to each other, Dan nestled beneath Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cIt seems crazy, that I tattooed myself over something that fell apart. I swear I\u2019m not usually that reckless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is small, and he detests it.</p><p>Phil sighs, the arm around Dan\u2019s shoulder tightening. \u201cI was young and stupid, basically. I thought I was in love.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand places itself over Phil\u2019s heart; for some reason, he suddenly feels terrified. Love? Phil was, potentially, in love with another man? The thought shouldn\u2019t be surprising, as Phil is older, and has had a whole life without him. Still, the idea is difficult to comprehend.</p><p>He tries to picture Phil directing his sunny smile at another person - another, faceless man. He imagines the hand in his wound into someone else\u2019s. He pictures Phil\u2019s lips against this mystery person\u2019s skin. His brain rejects the imaginings as they come, vehemently.</p><p>Who is this person that had such a hold on Phil, Dan wonders. </p><p>Is he French? </p><p>Did they speak to one another in a language Dan can\u2019t grasp?</p><p>Did they wander the streets of Paris together, making shared memories that Dan will never be a part of?</p><p>Did he love Phil back? </p><p>Does he think of Phil, still, today? Does he pine after him, wondering where he is, and if he should swim the channel, turn up on Phil\u2019s doorstep and whisk him away again?</p><p>\u201cDan? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods, but even he can feel how insincere his answer is. Phil tilts his chin up with one finger, forcing Dan to meet his eye. He\u2019s smiling gently; Dan watches, going a little cross-eyed as Phil leans in to kiss his nose.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, Dan.\u201d Something about the soft surety of Phil\u2019s voice puts Dan instantly at ease. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very nice, in the end. It took me a while to realise it, I guess. I was so besotted. I was in Paris. I got swept up in the romanticism of being there, of the cute caf\u00e9 dates, and holding his hand as we walked over padlocked bridges. I thought he was just as infatuated as I was. I didn\u2019t question it when I told him I wanted a tattoo, to commemorate my time there, with him, and he didn\u2019t want one too.\u201d</p><p>Phil stops speaking, looking into the space behind Dan, lost in thought. There\u2019s a sad, distant smile on his lips. Dan reaches up to stroke it with his fingers, making Phil refocus on his face.</p><p>He feels the smile stretch beneath the pad of his finger, watches the light flicker back into a warm glow behind Phil\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt used to make me feel sad, whenever I caught a glimpse of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tattoo?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Too many tainted memories attached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make you sad anymore?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Dan,\u201d Phil tells him, their noses brushing. \u201cI made new memories in Paris. Better ones. With you.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/170620415840/lhistoire-fran%C3%A7aise-new-chapter\"><b>(Chapter Fifteen!)\u00a0</b></a></p>",

As he pushes the covers away, he realises that there\u2019s something heavy draped over his waist, and turns, surprised, to see Phil laying beside him, his glasses on, skewed on his nose.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dan looks down at his own body, and realises that he and Phil are both fully dressed. They must have fallen asleep cuddling on his bed. Which means, Dan thinks, connecting the dots, that the barking is Buffy.</p><p>Smiling to himself, Dan moves a little closer to Phil, placing a hand on his chest. His heartbeat is slow and steady, lost as he is to dream, still. Just because he can, Dan presses a kiss to Phil\u2019s lips, letting himself linger against them. There\u2019s a hint of stubble on Phil\u2019s chin, scritching pleasantly at Dan\u2019s skin. He hums into the kiss, enjoying himself thoroughly.</p><p>It\u2019s at that moment that Phil\u2019s eyes peel open, blinking in astonishment as he takes in the sight of Dan, close and kissing him, in his bed.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2026 Dan,\u201d Phil says, frowning. He leans backwards, and reaches up to remove his glasses. There are red, deep set marks where the frames have dug into his nose and cheek. Dan wants to run his fingers over them, to kiss them each in turn. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\u2026 is it morning?\u201d</p><p>Phil turns, blearily, and stares out of the window at the early light filtering in. Then, he curses, sharp and urgent, sitting up abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dan asks, sitting up with him.</p><p>How could anything be wrong, right now? He woke up in Phil\u2019s arms. This day is already the most perfect in creation.</p><p>Phil turns to him, obviously panicked, and grabs his phone. When he sees the screen, he curses again. He looks at Dan, alarmed. \u201cDan, it\u2019s Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>It takes Dan a moment, and then his eyes grow round and wide, matching Phil\u2019s. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you fell asleep on me, I told myself I\u2019d just watch the end of the episode and then I\u2019d take you home, but I was so sleepy and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Dan asks, trying to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cEight thirty-three,\u201d Phil answers, checking his phone again.</p><p>It\u2019s not really the time to be thinking it, but Dan can\u2019t help notice how good Phil looks, with his messy bed hair and rumpled clothes. He replays the moment before he must have dozed off last night, when Phil\u2019s hand had inched its way into his jeans as Buffy Summers kicked the ass of a demonic creature in the background.</p><p>It had been, in Dan\u2019s opinion, a handjob worthy of a Nobel Prize. It had also, apparently, wiped them both out.</p><p>\u201cDan, did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>Phil lets out a frustrated little groan, then seizes Dan\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cDan, you\u2019re very cute and everything, but we need to get up. I\u2019m usually at work by eight-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan says, trying as hard as he can not to get lost in the infinity pools of Phil\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah, shit, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Phil leans in and presses a rather cruelly brief kiss to his lips, then swings his legs out of the bed. As he watches Phil flitting around the room, peeling off his jumper with one hand, grabbing for his shoes with the other, a realisation washes over Dan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t have my work clothes,\u201d he says, trying hard not to panic.</p><p>Phil turns to him, chest bare. He looks at the shirt in his hand, a purple and black plaid number that he\u2019s plucked from the wardrobe. He throws it at Dan without hesitation, then dives back into the wardrobe to find another.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Phil says, pulling on a dark blue shirt now, covered in little corgis. \u201cHurry up though, we need to leave in like ten minutes if we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, deciding to swallow his desire to ask for a different, plainer shirt. He can suck up wearing some colour for one day. He pulls off the Sunnydale High jumper Phil lent him yesterday, and slips Phil\u2019s shirt on. He catches Phil looking, a fleeting glance at the revealed skin, and smirks.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Mr Lester, I will not be ogled.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles, sitting on the bed to pull on his socks. When he\u2019s finished, he leans over and kisses Dan on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you wear my things,\u201d he says. Dan\u2019s face heats immediately, making Phil laugh and poke him. \u201cWish I could just drag you back into bed, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to say that if you want me to hurry up,\u201d Dan complains as Phil stands up again, ducking out of the room.</p><p>\u201cStop being so pretty then,\u201d he calls from somewhere else in the house.</p><p>Dan sighs, wondering how on earth this day is going to pan out considering the rollercoaster of a weekend he\u2019s had. As he mulls over the idea of working alongside Phil, in the classroom, listening to him teach in that eclectic way of his, Dan\u2019s stomach begins to flip.</p><p>How is he going to be able to hide his feelings for Phil, now? The activities they\u2019ve indulged in this weekend are written across his face, surely. Does Phil even intend for them to hide this - whatever this is? He\u2019d said last night that he had a plan that would solve everything, but can that be true?</p><p>Just as this latter thought begins to grow monstrous, evil fangs, poising itself above Dan, ready to sink its teeth in, Phil wanders back into the room. His hair has been tamed somewhat, and there\u2019s a smudge of toothpaste in the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The monster recoils, blinded by Phil\u2019s brilliant radiance. The idea of kissing the speck of toothpaste off of Phil\u2019s mouth is incredibly calming, so Dan gets up, walks over, and does exactly that.</p><p>Phil smiles at him, but there\u2019s a modicum of panic, still, behind his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve let Buffy out quickly and poured her some food,\u201d he says, probably more to himself than anything, Dan thinks. \u201cI don\u2019t have a spare toothbrush I\u2019m afraid, but maybe you could-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan says, trying to sound reassuring despite the anxiety monster still lurking behind him somewhere. \u201cI have some gum in my coat.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs; the sound of it never fails to put Dan at ease. \u201cNice. Okay, I\u2019ll go get Buffy back in, and then we should go. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods. Phil lets out a relieved sigh, and heads out of the room.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan has just closed the passenger door of the car when Phil gasps, turning to Dan, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cThe madeleines!\u201d He hops straight out again, running towards the house full pelt. Dan snorts with laughter, rolling his eyes. They\u2019re already ridiculously late, but God forbid the Year Nine\u2019s don\u2019t receive their baked goods.</p><p>He returns a minute later with two cake tins, one under each arm. As he slips into the driver\u2019s seat, he deposits them on Dan\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cNo snacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t had breakfast,\u201d Dan says, pouting.</p><p>Phil wavers, looking torn. \u201cOkay, you can have one, but you have to share it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Dan says, laughing, and delves into one of the tins.</p><p>He feeds Phil bits of the madeleine as they drive along. Mercifully, the school traffic doesn\u2019t seem particularly bad this morning, and they get there in under ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cEight fifty-one,\u201d Dan says, huffing an impressed laugh. \u201cChrist, I can\u2019t believe we made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was stressful,\u201d Phil says, glancing at his reflection in the rearview mirror. He tuts at whatever he sees, playing with his side fringe and frowning.</p><p>Dan takes hold of his hand, stilling the movements. \u201cYou look irritatingly gorgeous, Phil. Just like every morning.\u201d</p><p>Phil squeezes Dan\u2019s hand, smiling warmly. He holds Dan\u2019s gaze, thumb stroking softly across his knuckle.</p><p>A rap on Dan\u2019s window startles them both. Phil drops Dan\u2019s hand like it\u2019s burning, but it\u2019s too late. The expression on John\u2019s face as he stares through the glass is not a happy one.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Phil hisses under his breath, echoing Dan\u2019s sentiments exactly.</p><p>He rolls down the window, making Dan\u2019s heart race wildly. Could they not just drive away? Speed off into the horizon with their hands linked again, like a male version of Thelma and Louise?</p><p>\u201cMr Howell, Mr Lester,\u201d John greets them coldly. \u201cWould you mind getting out of the car, please?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Given the time restrictions, John tells them both to report to his office at break time. From his tone of voice, Dan highly doubts it\u2019s for a chat over tea and biscuits.</p><p>There\u2019s a decidedly morose atmosphere as Phil hands out the madeleines to the students of their first class. The students seem to pick up on the air of dread that hangs above their teachers\u2019 heads, and murmur to each other quietly, devoid of their usual enthusiasm for Phil\u2019s class. So as not to exacerbate an already bad situation, Dan tries his best not to be too obvious about his and Phil\u2019s dalliance in front of the kids.</p><p>He tries, but they\u2019re not stupid.</p><p>\u201cDid you pop round to Mr Lester\u2019s house just to borrow his shirt this morning, sir?\u201d Matthew asks as Dan is helping him shade a portion of the Arc du Triomphe (they\u2019re continuing with the mural). \u201cOr did he bring it in specially, \u2018cause he thought it\u2019d match your eyes?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, about to deflect this question with something irrelevant, when a voice interrupts him.</p><p>\u201cCram it, Matt. People have the same shirts as other people. Shocker.\u201d</p><p>Dan lifts his eyes to meet Jonah\u2019s as discreetly as he can, sending him a small smile of gratitude. Jonah winks subtly as Matthew rolls his eyes.</p><p>Around half an hour into the lesson, Dan wanders over to Phil, mostly because he cannot help himself. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying not to think about it,\u201d Phil mutters under his breath. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitting myself,\u201d Dan sighs, the butterflies in his stomach reforming in their chrysalises. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a chance we can convince him we were just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding hands in prayer?\u201d Phil asks, bitterly. \u201cPlatonically arriving together, late, with you in my clothes? Oh yeah, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll buy that.\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks, a little taken aback by Phil\u2019s unusual sarcasm. \u201cI guess when you put it that way\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil seems to catch on to the glimmer of hurt in Dan\u2019s voice, because he sighs, linking their little fingers together, out of sight of the kids. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m just worried. I didn\u2019t mean to take it out on you. I get kind of\u2026 moody when I\u2019m stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly it\u2019s pretty hot,\u201d Dan confesses, squeezing Phil\u2019s finger. It makes Phil smile a little, but it\u2019s short lived. \u201cIt might not be as terrible as we think, with John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this has happened already,\u201d Phil says, seeming to ignore Dan\u2019s attempt at reassurance. He looks skyward, shaking his head. \u201cI thought we could at least have a day or two of hiding it so I could figure something out\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, nodding. So there never was a plan, then. Phil had just been saying that to calm him down. It should probably make him annoyed, but it just seems incredibly sweet. Dan sends him a glance that he hopes speaks to this effect, and they both sigh, releasing their fingers.</p><p>\u201cThe kids seem to like the madeleines,\u201d Dan offers, casting a gaze around the classroom.</p><p>Though the students seem a little more subdued than normal, they are undoubtedly enjoying the pleasant atmosphere in here, nibbling on their freshly baked cakes while they colour their favourite scenes of Paris. They lounge about the floor in little groups, chatting quietly, models of behaviour.</p><p>Dan is glad they\u2019re so calm this morning. He\u2019s not sure he could handle any pep.</p><p>\u201cWell, I had a great baking assistant,\u201d Phil says, making Dan smile.</p><p>\u201cPlease, all I did was watch in silent admiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to remember you did a little more than that.\u201d</p><p>Dan splutters, throwing him a dirty look. \u201cSo not the time.\u201d</p><p>Phil just laughs. \u201cJust trying to lighten the mood.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>The door to the Vice Principal\u2019s office is dark green. Fitting, Dan thinks as he stares at the nameplate tacked onto the outside. He checks his phone for the time.</p><p>10:59am.</p><p>He\u2019d kind of hoped he\u2019d run into Phil outside, and that they\u2019d be able to exchange a quick, reassuring look, but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he\u2019s been held up after his second class, and is running late. Whatever the reason, Dan knows it would only make things worse if he were late to this meeting, so he takes a deep breath, and knocks on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Mr Howell,\u201d John\u2019s voice calls.</p><p>It confuses Dan for a moment. How does John know that it\u2019s him? He pushes open the door, his eyebrows lifting as he notes that Phil is already inside, sat on one of the two chairs in front of John\u2019s desk.</p><p>Both he and John turn to face him, and he closes the door behind himself with a small click, feeling like a zoo animal. How long has Phil been here?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Dan says, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>He moves to the seat beside Phil, perching on it awkwardly, heart pounding. Phil catches his eye, giving him a small smile. Dan drinks it in gratefully.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr Howell.\u201d John\u2019s tone of voice is grim. \u201cThank you for coming. Now that you\u2019re both here, I\u2019ll get straight to the point.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, his fingernails digging into his clammy palms. He wishes he could reach across and grab ahold of Phil\u2019s hand, but obviously that would be a pretty bad idea. Instead, he imagines he\u2019s back at Phil\u2019s house, still, beneath the covers beside him, their limbs tangled, their bodies sinking into his soft mattress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s come to the attention of myself and several other staff members that the two of you have violated the terms of your employment,\u201d John says, his fingers lacing together on his desk. \u201cWhilst I hesitate to think of the two of you as being unprofessional, it has come to light that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, can we cut the work jargon and talk properly?\u201d Phil interrupts, his voice so grave that Dan barely recognises it. He blinks at Phil in surprise, mildly concerned about how John might respond. \u201cWe all know why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>John leans back in his chair, sighing loudly. He holds Phil\u2019s gaze for a while, and then nods.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cPhil, Daniel, I\u2019m not going to sugar coat this. There\u2019s substantial evidence that the two of you are romantically involved, and as you are both aware, employee relationships are prohibited in this institution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dan didn\u2019t know,\u201d Phil argues. \u201cHe was rushed through the training programme, he\u2019s still new here. He couldn\u2019t have known such a specific rule unless he was told-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may have been initially true,\u201d John says, his voice a little louder now. \u201cBut as you assured me, Phil, you informed him of the rule after I spoke with you on Tuesday. Yet the two of you have chosen to ignore this, and continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d Dan jumps in, realising a second too late that this perhaps isn\u2019t particularly wise.</p><p>He had no idea of the evidence amounted against them. Jonah could have said anything; Dan doesn\u2019t know for sure. </p><p>\u201cDan, there\u2019s no point-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aside from the majority of the student body passing around gossip of what occurred during the Paris trip,\u201d John begins, silencing Phil before he can get the words out. \u201cThere is the fact that the two of you arrived together this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a crime!\u201d Dan points out.</p><p>\u201cHolding hands in the school parking lot, dressed in each other\u2019s clothes\u2026 Dan, that in itself is enough to prompt speculation amongst the students, which is precisely the reason for the rule in the first place.\u201d John, to his credit, sounds apologetic about his own words. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford this kind of distraction to their learning, particularly when it comes to your class, Mr Lester. You achieve the best history results in the entire school, to have those grades reduce due to your inability to focus on anything but your TA would be catastrophic for the school\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll quit,\u201d Phil says calmly.</p><p>Dan whips his head round to Phil in lightning speed. \u201cWhat? Phil, don\u2019t be crazy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, please,\u201d Phil says, his voice low and quiet. He meets Dan\u2019s gaze, eyes shining with such certainty that Dan slumps in his seat, already feeling defeated. Phil turns back to John, arms folded. \u201cJohn, this rule is antiquated and ridiculous, as you are well aware. I checked my contract, and the rule was implemented in 1957. It\u2019s absurd to think that the same conditions apply now, especially in a case like this, where Dan and I only work together twice a week, for an hour at a time.\u201d</p><p>John, looking a little flustered by Phil\u2019s threat of quitting, wipes a hand across his brow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with you, Phil,\u201d he confesses. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not my decision. I can\u2019t bend the rules just because we\u2019re friends, and I certainly can\u2019t look the other way - not when the students are discussing it all day like it\u2019s a damned television romance-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Phil presses, ignoring John entirely. Dan feels his chest swell with something like pride, watching Phil remain perfectly composed, laying out his argument clearly. \u201cDan has been my assistant since the beginning of term. Whilst our\u2026 mutual feelings have only just been acknowledged,\u201d Phil glances at Dan, smiling very slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019s been \u2018distracting\u2019 me for the whole of that time. Yet if you\u2019ll check my Year Nine and Year Eight class results, you\u2019ll notice that they\u2019re better than ever before. Because Dan is an asset, not a hindrance. He is an excellent TA, probably the best I\u2019ve ever had, helped by the fact that we are so in sync. Our romantic relationship, if anything, makes us stronger as a teaching unit, and allows us to be the best team for the students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do work well together,\u201d Dan agrees quietly. \u201cThe kids all say our lessons are the ones they look forward to, and learn from, the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, if you honestly think that Dan and I being together affects the students negatively, then I\u2019m afraid I will have no choice but to hand in my notice.\u201d Phil\u2019s announcement is like a bomb dropping. A hush falls over the office; even Dan\u2019s hands tighten on the arms of his chair. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to work in such discriminative conditions after I have proven myself to be an excellent teacher here. My relationship to Dan has not affected my performance. I am not prepared to allow my career to interrupt\u2026\u201d he trails off, eyes fixing themselves on Dan\u2019s face. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence, and then John sighs. \u201cPhil, I need you to be completely clear about this. If you are really willing to stake your job on a budding relationship, I advise you to think carefully-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, please, it\u2019s okay, we should talk about-\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, cutting Dan off. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>John looks at him for a long moment, seeming to deliberate. \u201cAlright. Well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that you\u2019re an extremely valuable member of the faculty, Mr Lester. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the school would do a great deal to prevent your departure. Allow me to discuss your ultimatum with the Principal, and we\u2019ll see if we can come to a conclusion of sorts.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes widen. Could John be offering a glimmer of hope?</p><p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d Phil says, moving to stand from his chair. \u201cDan and I will wait for your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d John says, nodding. \u201cI\u2019m promising absolutely nothing, boys. Rules are rules, and you have broken one. I\u2019ll be in touch. In the meantime\u2026 try and behave professionally, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, John,\u201d Phil says dismissively, standing from his chair.</p><p>Dan follows him, legs shaky, and nods at John, who is already dialling his phone. Phil makes a point of holding the door open for him, something that doesn\u2019t escape John\u2019s notice. Dan walks out quietly, and tries to comprehend what on earth just happened. </p><p>*</p><p>As soon as they step out of John\u2019s office, they\u2019re ambushed.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t get a chance to speak to Phil about what he\u2019d said inside, as before he can get the words out, Jonah Frank is in front of them, flanked by Bethany and Savannah, their faces anxious.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in VP Green\u2019s office, sirs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jonah,\u201d Dan says, glancing at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is the time\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just having a meeting, guys,\u201d Phil tells them vaguely. \u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about you guys hookin\u2019 up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jonah asks, making Dan roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jonah,\u201d he says under his breath.</p><p>He supposes it doesn\u2019t matter if the whole corridor hears now, however. The students apparently discuss the idea of he and Phil as a couple freely, despite their efforts to hide things.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool, Mr Howell,\u201d Savannah says. \u201cBeth and I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys\u2026 we can\u2019t discuss things with you, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil cuts in, perpetually the voice of reason. He always knows what to say. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know what happens if it gets to that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so it\u2019s true, then?\u201d Jonah\u2019s face is alarmed. \u201cYou guys could be canned?\u201d</p><p>Dan and Phil exchange a glance. Phil seems to deliberate on his wording. \u201cThere\u2019s a\u2026 possibility of suspension, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit\u2026\u201d Jonah says; the girls cover their mouths with their hands. \u201cThis is all my fault. I should\u2019a just kept my mouth shut. I didn\u2019t think VP Green\u2019d actually sack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did we,\u201d Dan mutters.</p><p>\u201cJonah, don\u2019t blame yourself for anything that might happen,\u201d Phil tells him firmly. \u201cNothing is certain anyway, but even if it ended up that Mr Howell or I lost our jobs, it would be the result of our own actions, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sake, I hate this place,\u201d Jonah spits, glaring at VP Green\u2019s closed door. \u201cThe only good thing about it is you an\u2019 your class, Mr Lester. And now that might be gone, too.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings then, and Dan sighs, resolving to discuss the meeting with Phil later. He gives Phil a grim smile, waggling his fingers at him, and takes a deep breath, about to start off towards the Science Block. Before he can take a step however, Jonah speaks again.</p><p>\u201cOi, sirs, I\u2019m gonna fix it, yeah?\u201d He says, looking fearsome. \u201cLeave it to me, I got you into trouble I know - but I\u2019m good at gettin\u2019 out of it.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiles fondly, finding his surety very touching. \u201cSweet of you to try, Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you just have to let things unfold, Jonah,\u201d Phil tells him wisely, then waves goodbye, walking briskly off towards his own classroom.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t get a chance to speak to Phil about what happened until lunch. He finds Phil in the staffroom making coffee, dark circles under his eyes. When he sees Dan approach, he offers him the cup he\u2019s just made straight away, and turns back to the pot to pour another.</p><p>Dan\u2019s opening line dies on his lips, touched by the small gesture. \u201cHow are you?\u201d He asks instead. </p><p>Phil offers him a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been better, honestly.\u201d</p><p>Dan shuts his eyes, sighing into his coffee. \u201cPhil\u2026 why did you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get them to listen,\u201d Phil says before Dan can get the words out. \u201cThe rule is stupid and pointless. Even if I have to walk over this, the system is oppressive and needs to change. This could force their hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a risk, Phil. I should be the one to leave, not you.\u201d</p><p>Phil peers over his freshly made cup, a smirk on his lips. \u201cNo offence, Dan, but I don\u2019t think you walking out would quite carry the same weight. You\u2019ve been here a couple of months. I\u2019ve been here for two years.\u201d</p><p>In his heart, Dan knows that what Phil is saying makes sense. Even so, the idea of Phil quitting his job, which he loves, deeply, just for him - it\u2019s too much. Too big of a sacrifice. Dan isn\u2019t worth that kind of gesture. </p><p>\u201cThis is so unfair,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He can feel himself getting choked up out of frustration, tears stinging in his eyes. He knows it\u2019s just because he\u2019s overtired and stressed, but it\u2019s still embarrassing, having Phil see. Luckily for him, Phil is the most wonderful creation in the universe, so he puts down his coffee and ushers Dan into the staff bathroom.</p><p>Safely sealed inside the private space, Phil pulls Dan into his arms, wrapping him up tightly. He kisses Dan\u2019s forehead, rocking gently as Dan struggles to hold himself together.</p><p>\u201cNe t'inqui\u00e8te pas,\u201d he whispers. \u201cJe te tiens.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>They don\u2019t hear from John for the rest of the day. Dan wanders into Phil\u2019s classroom just after the last bell, sitting down on one of the student\u2019s desks with a sigh. Phil watches him while he tidies some things away on his desk, smiling sadly.</p><p>\u201cWanna come over for a while?\u201d</p><p>Dan thinks about it for a moment, then nods. \u201cI haven\u2019t brushed my teeth since Sunday morning. Just so you\u2019re aware before you get too hospitable.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles, wandering over to him. \u201cWe can pick you up a toothbrush on the way.\u201d</p><p>They both glance over at the classroom door, checking it\u2019s closed before they touch. Dan winds his arms around Phil\u2019s waist, resting his head on Phil\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cFor me to keep at your house?\u201d Dan asks into Phil\u2019s breastbone. \u201cNext thing you know I\u2019ll have a whole drawer there, Phil. Steady on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d happily give you a whole chest of drawers, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Dan lifts his head, staring at Phil with a frown. \u201cIt\u2019s only been like a week since you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon,\u201d Phil tells him, leaning in to kiss him very gently. \u201cJe te connais depuis toujours.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br>um\u2026 are u dead</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>only internally</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br>are u ever coming home or</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>no u guys pissed me off too much<br>and im moving out baiii</p><p><b>Tyler<br></b>ah, k. how is it in ur new home? dark?<br>cramped?</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>???</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br>well i assume you\u2019ve now moved<br>permanently into phil\u2019s ass</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>TYLER HE FUCKING READ THAT<br>I HATE U</p><p><b>Tyler<br></b>miss u and ur screaming :( come home<br>soon we have much to gossip about x</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>i\u2019ll be home tonight or tomorrow xx</p><p>*</p><p>They\u2019re on Phil\u2019s sofa, Dan\u2019s head in Phil\u2019s lap, Buffy snoozing on Dan\u2019s chest, when a random thought occurs to him.</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>Dan stares up at him, the sharp cut of his jawline, stubbled and pretty, catching his eye.</p><p>\u201cYou said you have a tattoo.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches, almost imperceptibly. \u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>Thor is playing in the background on Phil\u2019s TV, but neither of them have been paying close attention. They\u2019ve both seen it before, and besides, Dan\u2019s far more interested in tracing the contours of Phil\u2019s pretty face with his eyes from below. Not to mention, Phil\u2019s hand has been in his hair for some time now, massaging gently. It\u2019s still curly from yesterday, as the kids had been all too gleeful to point out for the entire day.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes.\u201d Dan tries to sit up a little, but Buffy is having none of it. He rolls his eyes at her indignant expression, sinking back onto Phil\u2019s lap. \u201cOn the boat, when we were playing that game with the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh, strange,\u201d Phil says, that hint of a smile still playing on his lips.</p><p>Dan just stares at him. \u201cSo\u2026 do you, or don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a silence. Phil picks up his tea and takes a long drink of it, then places it carefully back on the arm of the sofa. His eyes drag slowly down to Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to find out.\u201d</p><p>Buffy squeals in indignation as she is pushed off Dan\u2019s chest, but he has no time to apologise to her. He climbs up onto Phil\u2019s lap in seconds, hands at the collar of his shirt immediately. Phil laughs at his eagerness, welcoming the kisses Dan plants on his lips.</p><p>It takes only a few seconds to get Phil\u2019s shirt open, but it feels like centuries go by. Dan tugs at it impatiently, yanking it over his shoulders and trying to shove it down his arms. Phil is laughing still, apparently finding Dan\u2019s efforts extremely amusing, but going along with it anyway.</p><p>It\u2019s his own fault, anyway, Dan thinks. He can\u2019t just dangle the prospect of a hidden tattoo in front of him without expecting to be ravished. He gasps as Phil\u2019s hands find his bum, moving Dan in closer with a strong, sharp pull. Dan wiggles in his lap, drawing away from Phil\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cHands off, I need to get you naked,\u201d Dan complains, frustrated. Phil is surprisingly strong.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get naked after,\u201d Dan explains impatiently, making Phil laugh.</p><p>It seems to do the trick though, as he releases his hold on Dan\u2019s bum, and allows the shirt to slip completely off his body. Dan sits back, surveying the exposed flesh. It\u2019s safe to say that Phil\u2019s chest and stomach are decidedly unblemished, and devoid of anything but miles of gorgeous, pale skin. Dan runs his fingers over it anyway, lifting each of Phil\u2019s arms and peering at them, dragging his lips down their lengths, shoulder to each fingertip.</p><p>When he\u2019s satisfied that neither arm is inked, he leans back again, catching sight of Phil\u2019s amused smile.</p><p>\u201cI might have to be extremely thorough,\u201d Dan warns him, entirely serious. \u201cI plan to leave no place unsearched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Detective Howell,\u201d Phil says, nodding sombrely. \u201cI completely understand.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Dan slips off Phil\u2019s lap and onto the floor, landing between his legs. He kneels up, reaching at once for Phil\u2019s belt and fly, wanting to waste no time. He\u2019s always had a weakness for tattoos. He\u2019s too scared to actually get one himself, too anxious of a person to trust his decision for such a permanent thing, but on other people - it\u2019s incredibly attractive.</p><p>If Phil really does possess a tattoo, Dan thinks as he slides Phil\u2019s jeans down his legs, it means there are all sorts of things about him that Dan doesn\u2019t know, potentially. The thought excites him. Will the tattoo be something tribal, to represent an aspect of Phil\u2019s personality? Will it be a memory, shared with someone Dan doesn\u2019t know? Will it be just a pattern Phil liked? Or a caricature of Justin Bieber on one of his buttcheeks?</p><p>Dan thinks he might\u2019ve noticed that last one before now, but he doesn\u2019t know for sure. He hadn\u2019t really been paying close attention to Phil\u2019s nether regions when they\u2019d been on display yesterday; Phil\u2019s actions had been\u2026 rather distracting, as he recalls.</p><p>Once Phil\u2019s jeans are off, Dan gets to work, taking Phil\u2019s leg and extending it out before inspecting it closely, pressing little kisses as he goes. He checks from ankle to thigh, even peering at the space behind Phil\u2019s knee.</p><p>He takes Phil\u2019s feet in his hand one at a time, peeling off the socks to check every toe.</p><p>\u201cKnew you had a foot fetish,\u201d Phil says, watching him with a grin.</p><p>Just to mess with him, Dan licks a stripe up the underside of his left foot, making him shriek. \u201cFor these babies, I might.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs, and Dan moves back to his former position, knelt between his legs on the floor.</p><p>\u201cGive up?\u201d Phil asks, a teasing lilt to his voice.</p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cAs if. I\u2019m just getting started, mate.\u201d</p><p>He trails his hands up Phil\u2019s thighs then, already drunk on the little gasping noise that slips from Phil\u2019s mouth. He hooks his fingers into the elastic of Phil\u2019s boxers, pulling them carefully down as Phil lifts his bum from the sofa.</p><p>As ever, the sight of him, naked and aroused, is enough to knock the air out of Dan\u2019s lungs. He can\u2019t help the tiny groan that falls from his lips, just as he can\u2019t stop himself leaning in and taking hold of Phil\u2019s length in one hand, and slipping his mouth over the tip.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he hears Phil say, making him shiver.</p><p>Phil is smooth and slick as Dan allows the length of him to slide into his mouth. He can feel his mouth being stretched wide, can feel the tip nudging the back of his throat. Dan swallows, moaning a little, his eyes fluttering as the taste of Phil filters through. He lets himself sink down, relishing the sensation Phil pushing so far inside.</p><p>He reaches down to palm himself through his jeans, just to relieve some of the pressure building up there. He starts to bob his head, letting Phil\u2019s breathy noises guide him into what\u2019s good and what isn\u2019t. He works his hand too, allowing his lips to meet the circle of his fist.</p><p>\u201cDan, baby, that\u2019s so\u2026 oh, fuck\u2026.\u201d Phil is saying, babbling really.</p><p>After a while, Dan forces himself to pull off; Phil lets out an agonised cry. Dan wipes the corner of his mouth, smirking. \u201cHang on. I\u2019m still looking for something.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s responding groan is anguished, but Dan doesn\u2019t allow it to deter him. Instead, he grabs Phil\u2019s hands and pulls him down to his level, into his lap, so that Phil\u2019s legs straddle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a tease,\u201d Phil tells him, practically pouting.</p><p>Dan just grins. \u201cIt\u2019s payback for all the totally outside-the-rules flirting during school hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm, try every fucking day.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhatever, I hate you. Please just hurry up and find it.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows raise at this instruction, catching the implication that there is, at least, something to find. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a glimmer of something wicked in Phil\u2019s eyes, but he does so, carefully twisting around on Dan\u2019s lap. He leans forwards, arms braced against the sofa cushion in front of them both, sat on Dan\u2019s knees still, now with his back on show.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes rake down the canvas of Phil\u2019s skin; immediately he understands why he hadn\u2019t noticed the tattoo until now. It\u2019s low down, on Phil\u2019s left side, wrapped around the back of his hip.</p><p>Dan stares at it for a long time before reaching out to trace it, lightly, using just the tips of his fingers. He didn\u2019t realise tattoos this pretty existed. It\u2019s like a piece of art.</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d Dan observes, his finger edging along the skyline, drawn so neatly, so simply, into Phil\u2019s skin.</p><p>The thin line is unbroken, as if it\u2019s all connected, the outline of the Eiffel Tower joined to the Sacre Coeur, and the Moulin Rouge. It\u2019s minimalistic, to say the least, just one long, very thin black line, outlining the city.</p><p>It\u2019s incredibly beautiful. It seems to fit on Phil\u2019s body, resting delicately on his hip, as if he\u2019d been born with it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Phil sighs, the line of his shoulders shifting. \u201cClich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Dan leans his cheek against the space between Phil\u2019s shoulder blades, staring down at it across the desert of Phil\u2019s back. \u201cPhil, it\u2019s beautiful. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, and Dan leans up to kiss him. He wraps his arms around Phil\u2019s waist, dragging him backwards until they\u2019re back to chest. He can feel Phil\u2019s irregular breathing, and he treasures the sound, mentally saving it on a loop for when he\u2019s alone, and needs to remember how wrecked he can, somehow, make this man, scintillating as he is.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hands glide down Phil\u2019s chest and stomach, his chin tucked over one shoulder, pressing kisses at the base of his neck. He takes hold of Phil\u2019s erection, still full and proud, damp now from the anticipation, and starts stroking him gently.</p><p>Phil\u2019s head falls backwards, the base of his skull brushing Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDan\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTes mains se sentent incroyables,\u201d Phil croaks out.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand stops moving. \u201cWhat are you saying? It\u2019s not fair, I can\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>Phil turns his head to look Dan in the eye, clearly surprised. \u201cNothing, I\u2019m just\u2026 saying you feel good.\u201d</p><p>The answer frustrates him in its ambiguity. \u201cWill you translate for me, at least?\u201d</p><p>The crinkles around Phil\u2019s eyes deepen, and he smirks.. \u201cI said\u2026 your hands feel incredible.\u201d</p><p>Dan flushes immediately, caught off guard. \u201cO-oh.\u201d</p><p>Phil surges up and kisses him then, slow and teasing, licking against Dans lower lip. \u201cS\u2019il te plait\u2026 ne tu arrete pas.\u201d</p><p>Dan feels the goosebumps rip over his skin. \u201cWhat did you say then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said please don\u2019t stop,\u201d Phil says, and Dan bites his lip. As requested, he starts moving his hand again, and Phil\u2019s head flops backwards, eyes closing.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u2026.\u201d Dan whispers, suddenly indescribably turned on, staring down over Phil\u2019s shoulder at the expanse of his naked body. \u201cWill you\u2026\u201d</p><p>He hesitates, and Phil opens one eye, a sliver of ice blue visible around the black hole of his pupil. \u201cWill I\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing his embarrassment, Dan moves his mouth until his lips are brushing the shell of Phil\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cBaise-moi,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Phil grabs hold of Dan\u2019s wrist, stilling the movement around his erection. \u201cMon dieu, Daniel. Where did you learn\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan laughs a little, unwrapping his fingers from Phil\u2019s length, sensing he might be rather close to the edge as it is. If Dan\u2019s going to get what he wants, he needs to move quickly. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026 looking up some words and phrases. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>He hears Phil take a deep breath, and then he stands, chucking a mischievous glance over his shoulder at Dan as he sashays across the room towards his bedroom. Dan stares for a moment, mesmerised by the sight of his naked backside, the newly revealed tattoo resting above it, before he scrambles to his feet and runs after him.</p><p>Excited by Dan\u2019s brisk movements, Buffy trots along behind him, her tongue out, happily ignorant of the sin in front of her twitching nose. Dan reaches down to pat her, gently pointing her in the other direction. </p><p>He slips into Phil\u2019s room and quickly shuts the door on her, feeling bad, but knowing that it was necessary. </p><p>By the time Dan turns around, Phil is reclined on his bed, squeezing something clear and gel-like into his palm from a small purple bottle. Wanting to waste no time, Dan peels off the shirt Phil lent him, and unfastens his jeans, shimmying them off as he dives onto the bed.</p><p>Phil laughs at his eagerness, rolling them over so he\u2019s on top of Dan, eyes hooded. \u201cTu sembles impatient, ce soir.\u201d</p><p>Heart fluttering, Dan swats him gently in the shoulder. \u201cEnglish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d Phil growls, his fingers already sliding Dan\u2019s briefs down his thighs. \u201cYou seem impatient, this evening.\u201d</p><p>Dan feels the flush as it ripples down his throat. He shouldn\u2019t have asked. \u201cC-can you blame me?\u201d</p><p>Phil nips at the base of his neck, where there are already a bouquet of bruises, barely coverable by the shirts he wears to school. \u201cI quite like it, actually.\u201d</p><p>Before Dan can respond, Phil\u2019s hand is wrapping around his erection, slippery and warm, his fingers curling tightly as he slicks them up and down.</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d Dan moans, his hips bucking into Phil\u2019s fist. \u201cHoly fucking shit, Phil. Excuse my French.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorts with laughter.</p><p>All of a sudden, any ability to be funny slips away as Dan feels the fingers of Phil\u2019s other hand slipping between his cheeks, pressing firmly against his hole. He sucks in a breath, his body twitching in surprise. Phil just continues stroking up and down his length with one hand, his other fingers circling Dan\u2019s rim.</p><p>The over-stimulation might actually be enough to make him black out, Dan thinks vaguely.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan curses again, his hands winding into Phil\u2019s covers, pulling them free of the corners. \u201cOh God,\u201d he groans. \u201cPlease fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles again, but he sounds a little strung out, if Dan isn\u2019t mistaken. \u201cTu es trop pleurniches.\u201d He sighs, pushing his finger inside, making Dan groan. \u201cEt trop joli.\u201d Dan hits him in the shoulder again, making Phil laugh. \u201cI said you\u2019re so whiny.\u201d</p><p>Something seems off about Phil\u2019s translation, but it\u2019s hard to concentrate on that when Phil\u2019s finger is pressing so deeply into him, making him squirm. He continues pumping his hand over Dan\u2019s length too, which is dizzyingly hot, so Dan just writhes and whimpers, clinging to the bedsheets for dear life.</p><p>Phil is quick about opening him up, this time, for which Dan is grateful. There\u2019s still a slight burn, as he\u2019s far from used to this yet, but he would gladly endure ten times the pain for the experience of having Phil inside of him like before. Once he\u2019s three fingers deep, Phil crooks his fingers, deftly, seeming to know exactly how and where, and Dan chokes off a low, rumbling moan of ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cIci, mon ange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnngh, Phil talk in English, please,\u201d Dan begs, his face turning to burrow into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phil mutters, seeming to pause before translating this time. \u201cHere, Dan?\u201d He pushes against Dan\u2019s prostate again, making him yelp.</p><p>Yet again, Dan\u2019s not sure that Phil actually said that, but he doesn\u2019t have it in him to argue. So he just nods, biting down on his lip, possibly a little too hard.</p><p>Phil draws his hands free of Dan, eliciting a groan of anguish from him. Dan sits up, bewildered and affronted by this action. Phil just giggles at his expression, and picks up the bottle of lube from wherever he dropped it last. He holds it up to Dan in explanation.</p><p>\u201cHm, I hope I have some condoms in here,\u201d Phil mutters, reaching across to dig into his bedside drawer. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d Dan says, impatient. \u201cI\u2019ve never even done this with anyone but you. Are you clean?\u201d</p><p>Phil turns to him in surprise. He nods, pressing his lips together. \u201cI am,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut maybe- just to be sure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you Phil, Christ,\u201d Dan argues, kicking him in the leg. \u201cGet over here.\u201d</p><p>To Dan\u2019s sheer relief, Phil does as asked, crawling towards him. He kneels by Dan\u2019s legs, squeezing another dollop of lube onto his outstretched palm. As he rubs his fingers together, he drags his eyes over Dan\u2019s body; absurdly, it makes Dan blush.</p><p>\u201cTurn over,\u201d Phil instructs, sending a lance of hot, debilitating arousal through Dan\u2019s body.</p><p>His breaths become a little more difficult to catch, for some reason, and fall from his mouth in short, stuttery gasps as he rolls onto his stomach, desperate to obey Phil\u2019s command. He hears a slick sound, and imagines the sight of Phil\u2019s fist pumping over himself, covering his flushed erection with the lubricant. He feels Phil\u2019s hands on his hips, canting them upwards, so that Dan\u2019s face presses into the mattress.</p><p>His lungs tighten, face on fire as he thinks about how exposed he is. \u201cPh-phil, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Phil says; Dan feels him dragging the tip of his length over his rim, and his hips twitch in Phil\u2019s hands. \u201cYou\u2019re so good, Dan. So gorgeous. There\u2019s no word for how you look in French. Gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Dan directs his ragged breathing into the covers of Phil\u2019s bed. He feels the familiar burn of being stretched open as Phil pushes in, going slow again, one thumb stroking gently over his hipbone.</p><p>Nobody has ever called him anything other than \u2018hot\u2019 before. Stephanie used to call him cute sometimes, or tell him he looked sexy in a certain shirt, but \u2018gorgeous\u2019? That\u2019s a word he would never have associated with his appearance. It\u2019s a loaded word, heavier than beautiful, more charged with attraction, with want.</p><p>His cheeks burn. \u2018Gorgeous\u2019 is how Phil sees him, even like this.</p><p>He pushes his hips backwards, feeling Phil slip further inside. He can tell the movement takes Phil by surprise, because Phil\u2019s hands tighten on his hips, as if trying to slow him down. But Dan doesn\u2019t want to slow down. He wants Phil to wreck him, to split him apart with his face crushed into the green-blue of his bedspread.</p><p>He lifts his head, intending to tell Phil exactly this. \u201cYou can be rougher, if you want,\u201d he says, voice scratchy and weak. \u201cI won\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>A tiny moan spills from Phil\u2019s throat. It makes Dan smile, proud. \u201cTell me if I hurt you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it bad if I don\u2019t really mind?\u201d</p><p>The only answer Dan receives is a mildly strangled sound, followed by Phil thrusting his hips forwards so abruptly that Dan cries out. Immediately, Phil stills behind him, leaning forwards in alarm.</p><p>\u201cShit, did I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d Dan urges, reaching back blindly in order to grab one of Phil\u2019s thighs.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of hesitation, and then Phil is drawing back, sliding out of Dan before thrusting back in, slick and fast, the top of his thighs hitting Dan\u2019s buttocks with a slap. Then, he does it a third time. Dan\u2019s mouth falls open, pressing back into the sensation, rocking back into Phil\u2019s movements.</p><p>\u201cShit\u2026\u201d Phil says, setting up a rhythm now. \u201cI warn you, Dan, I\u2019m pretty close\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe- me too,\u201d Dan manages to stutter around the rough, lustful moans that refuse to stop bubbling out of his chest. \u201cFucking\u2026 Christ, Phil, fuck me, yeah\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe pourrais te baiser pour toujours, Dan,\u201d Phil garbles, obviously on the edge. His movements are erratic now, sloppier, with less control. \u201cTu es parfait, tu es parfait-\u201d</p><p>His own shout of ecstasy cuts him off, and Dan feels the warmth, the spasm, as Phil comes into him, pushing himself deeply as he spreads his chest against Dan\u2019s back. He bites Dan\u2019s shoulder, hips twitching; it\u2019s hands down the hottest thing Dan has ever experienced. He thrusts himself against the mattress, desperate for friction.</p><p>Suddenly, Phil is easing out of him, and Dan is being flipped over. Phil\u2019s tongue drags itself over his chest, down his stomach, and then a mouth is slipping over his straining erection, engulfing him entirely. It takes approximately three seconds before Dan is toppling into his climax, the force of it pushing an agonised scream from his throat. He\u2019s sure he momentarily glimpses infinity, sizzling around him in the form of a neon, pulsating nebula.</p><p>When he crashes back down to earth, Phil is draped over him, his nose just below Dan\u2019s ear, his arm slung across Dan\u2019s chest. Both of their chests are heaving - their exhaustion the only sound in the silent room.</p><p>After a moment, Dan can hear a faint scrabbling against the closed bedroom door. Poor Buffy, he thinks absently. She must be so jealous that Dan is stealing all of her father\u2019s attention.</p><p>Dan finds Phil\u2019s hand and winds their fingers together, both their palms damp with exertion.</p><p>\u201cAs far as distractions from things we\u2019re trying not to think about go,\u201d Dan says to the ceiling. \u201cThat was pretty good.\u201d</p><p>Phil lifts his head, looking affronted. \u201c\u2019Pretty good\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Dan laughs, breathless. \u201cIn this instance, \u2018pretty good\u2019 means the absolute best sex I\u2019ve ever had, ever.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles, satisfied, and rests his head back on Dan\u2019s shoulder, playing with his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know that even if we get sacked, we\u2019ll still be able to console ourselves with amazing sex, I guess,\u201d Dan jokes, but he can feel it falls flat against Phil\u2019s ears.</p><p>There\u2019s a silence.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get fired, Dan,\u201d Phil says softly. He\u2019s tracing up each of Dan\u2019s fingers in turn.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d stay working in a school that kicked out the only good teacher they\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Phil, don\u2019t,\u201d Dan says firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re the only reason that job is bearable. I couldn\u2019t work there if I couldn\u2019t see you every day. There\u2019s no way I could be professional. I wouldn\u2019t be able to smile at John, or have a coffee with him in the staffroom, knowing full well that he stole you away from me, for something so\u2026. completely unfair.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s fingers trickle up and down his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t make you do anything, or not do anything. But you should think carefully. I can get another job. It would be harder for you. You don\u2019t have as much experience working in schools. We\u2019d make it work, still, even if I do end up having to quit. We can see each other after work, all the time. It might not be so bad.\u201d</p><p>Dan wriggles in Phil\u2019s arms, turning so they\u2019re laying face to face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work where you\u2019re not. That\u2019s so sad.\u201d</p><p>Phil reaches up to trace the curve of his face. \u201cI know, gorgeous.\u201d The tips of Dan\u2019s ears burn, still not used to hearing the endearment. \u201cI don\u2019t either. Mais c\u2019est la vie.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Phil is laying on his front, and Dan is appreciating the view. They\u2019ve been on his bed for some time now, talking about nothing as the light pouring through Phil\u2019s big windows fades into a softer, duller evening glow.</p><p>For what must be the hundredth time, Dan leans down to Phil\u2019s left hip, and presses his mouth to the tattoo he can\u2019t stop staring at. Just like every time, Phil\u2019s breath hitches, like he can\u2019t quite believe the sensation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so much prettier than I thought it would be,\u201d Dan confesses, making Phil giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think it would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ninja turtle? A portrait of Buffy\u2019s face? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffy as in my dog, or Sarah Michelle Gellar?\u201d</p><p>Dan considers this, laughing. \u201cEither. Both.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs then as well, gazing at Dan over his shoulder. Dan\u2019s fingers trace the Paris skyline once again, his face dreamy. \u201cYou really like it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A light blush peppers Dan\u2019s cheekbones, and he shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201d Phil looks curious, but says nothing. \u201cWhen did you get it?\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden, Phil\u2019s expression grows a little colder. He turns from Dan, averting his gaze. \u201cIn Paris. When I lived there.\u201d</p><p>Confused by the sudden change in atmosphere, Dan feels his curiosity perking up. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, trying to sound casual. \u201cOn your own, or\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil sighs, and he glances at Dan, conflicted. After a moment, he seems to relent. \u201cNo. Not alone.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, nonchalant. \u201cWas it\u2026 with that guy you mentioned? Your ex?\u201d The nod Phil gives him doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise, but it still winds a thick coil of jealousy around Dan\u2019s chest, squeezing so tightly that he coughs. \u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>Seeing straight through his attempt at remaining calm and collected, Phil laughs, reaching for Dan\u2019s hand. Dan lets him take it, feeling foolish. He has no right to be jealous of something that happened before he even knew Phil, he knows. It\u2019s not like this guy, whoever he is, is still around.</p><p>Still, as Dan stares at the tattoo, he can\u2019t help wondering how serious this past relationship must have been, or at least felt, for Phil to do something so permanent about it.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Phil tells him, rolling onto his back, rendering the tattoo invisible again. He tugs Dan towards him, until they\u2019re laying next to each other, Dan nestled beneath Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cIt seems crazy, that I tattooed myself over something that fell apart. I swear I\u2019m not usually that reckless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is small, and he detests it.</p><p>Phil sighs, the arm around Dan\u2019s shoulder tightening. \u201cI was young and stupid, basically. I thought I was in love.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand places itself over Phil\u2019s heart; for some reason, he suddenly feels terrified. Love? Phil was, potentially, in love with another man? The thought shouldn\u2019t be surprising, as Phil is older, and has had a whole life without him. Still, the idea is difficult to comprehend.</p><p>He tries to picture Phil directing his sunny smile at another person - another, faceless man. He imagines the hand in his wound into someone else\u2019s. He pictures Phil\u2019s lips against this mystery person\u2019s skin. His brain rejects the imaginings as they come, vehemently.</p><p>Who is this person that had such a hold on Phil, Dan wonders. </p><p>Is he French? </p><p>Did they speak to one another in a language Dan can\u2019t grasp?</p><p>Did they wander the streets of Paris together, making shared memories that Dan will never be a part of?</p><p>Did he love Phil back? </p><p>Does he think of Phil, still, today? Does he pine after him, wondering where he is, and if he should swim the channel, turn up on Phil\u2019s doorstep and whisk him away again?</p><p>\u201cDan? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods, but even he can feel how insincere his answer is. Phil tilts his chin up with one finger, forcing Dan to meet his eye. He\u2019s smiling gently; Dan watches, going a little cross-eyed as Phil leans in to kiss his nose.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, Dan.\u201d Something about the soft surety of Phil\u2019s voice puts Dan instantly at ease. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very nice, in the end. It took me a while to realise it, I guess. I was so besotted. I was in Paris. I got swept up in the romanticism of being there, of the cute caf\u00e9 dates, and holding his hand as we walked over padlocked bridges. I thought he was just as infatuated as I was. I didn\u2019t question it when I told him I wanted a tattoo, to commemorate my time there, with him, and he didn\u2019t want one too.\u201d</p><p>Phil stops speaking, looking into the space behind Dan, lost in thought. There\u2019s a sad, distant smile on his lips. Dan reaches up to stroke it with his fingers, making Phil refocus on his face.</p><p>He feels the smile stretch beneath the pad of his finger, watches the light flicker back into a warm glow behind Phil\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt used to make me feel sad, whenever I caught a glimpse of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tattoo?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Too many tainted memories attached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make you sad anymore?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Dan,\u201d Phil tells him, their noses brushing. \u201cI made new memories in Paris. Better ones. With you.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/170620415840/lhistoire-fran%C3%A7aise-new-chapter\"><b>(Chapter Fifteen!)\u00a0</b></a></p>",

In the dream, he\u2019d been lying in a bed of squishy dough, warm and snug in a toasty oven. Every so often, the door of the oven would open, and Phil\u2019s big, sunny face would peer through the crack to check on him, his broad smile big and soothing as gazed in at Dan, slowly baking away.<b><br></b></p><p>As the barks rouse him, he frowns, rather worried about his brain. Who dreams about being baked, and enjoys it?</p><p>He realises that he\u2019s stiflingly hot, buried beneath several layers of quilt, which explains the dream a little more. As he pushes the covers away, he realises that there\u2019s something heavy draped over his waist, and turns, surprised, to see Phil laying beside him, his glasses on, skewed on his nose.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dan looks down at his own body, and realises that he and Phil are both fully dressed. They must have fallen asleep cuddling on his bed. Which means, Dan thinks, connecting the dots, that the barking is Buffy.</p><p>Smiling to himself, Dan moves a little closer to Phil, placing a hand on his chest. His heartbeat is slow and steady, lost as he is to dream, still. Just because he can, Dan presses a kiss to Phil\u2019s lips, letting himself linger against them. There\u2019s a hint of stubble on Phil\u2019s chin, scritching pleasantly at Dan\u2019s skin. He hums into the kiss, enjoying himself thoroughly.</p><p>It\u2019s at that moment that Phil\u2019s eyes peel open, blinking in astonishment as he takes in the sight of Dan, close and kissing him, in his bed.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2026 Dan,\u201d Phil says, frowning. He leans backwards, and reaches up to remove his glasses. There are red, deep set marks where the frames have dug into his nose and cheek. Dan wants to run his fingers over them, to kiss them each in turn. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\u2026 is it morning?\u201d</p><p>Phil turns, blearily, and stares out of the window at the early light filtering in. Then, he curses, sharp and urgent, sitting up abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dan asks, sitting up with him.</p><p>How could anything be wrong, right now? He woke up in Phil\u2019s arms. This day is already the most perfect in creation.</p><p>Phil turns to him, obviously panicked, and grabs his phone. When he sees the screen, he curses again. He looks at Dan, alarmed. \u201cDan, it\u2019s Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>It takes Dan a moment, and then his eyes grow round and wide, matching Phil\u2019s. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you fell asleep on me, I told myself I\u2019d just watch the end of the episode and then I\u2019d take you home, but I was so sleepy and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Dan asks, trying to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cEight thirty-three,\u201d Phil answers, checking his phone again.</p><p>It\u2019s not really the time to be thinking it, but Dan can\u2019t help notice how good Phil looks, with his messy bed hair and rumpled clothes. He replays the moment before he must have dozed off last night, when Phil\u2019s hand had inched its way into his jeans as Buffy Summers kicked the ass of a demonic creature in the background.</p><p>It had been, in Dan\u2019s opinion, a handjob worthy of a Nobel Prize. It had also, apparently, wiped them both out.</p><p>\u201cDan, did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>Phil lets out a frustrated little groan, then seizes Dan\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cDan, you\u2019re very cute and everything, but we need to get up. I\u2019m usually at work by eight-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan says, trying as hard as he can not to get lost in the infinity pools of Phil\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah, shit, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Phil leans in and presses a rather cruelly brief kiss to his lips, then swings his legs out of the bed. As he watches Phil flitting around the room, peeling off his jumper with one hand, grabbing for his shoes with the other, a realisation washes over Dan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t have my work clothes,\u201d he says, trying hard not to panic.</p><p>Phil turns to him, chest bare. He looks at the shirt in his hand, a purple and black plaid number that he\u2019s plucked from the wardrobe. He throws it at Dan without hesitation, then dives back into the wardrobe to find another.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Phil says, pulling on a dark blue shirt now, covered in little corgis. \u201cHurry up though, we need to leave in like ten minutes if we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, deciding to swallow his desire to ask for a different, plainer shirt. He can suck up wearing some colour for one day. He pulls off the Sunnydale High jumper Phil lent him yesterday, and slips Phil\u2019s shirt on. He catches Phil looking, a fleeting glance at the revealed skin, and smirks.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Mr Lester, I will not be ogled.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles, sitting on the bed to pull on his socks. When he\u2019s finished, he leans over and kisses Dan on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you wear my things,\u201d he says. Dan\u2019s face heats immediately, making Phil laugh and poke him. \u201cWish I could just drag you back into bed, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to say that if you want me to hurry up,\u201d Dan complains as Phil stands up again, ducking out of the room.</p><p>\u201cStop being so pretty then,\u201d he calls from somewhere else in the house.</p><p>Dan sighs, wondering how on earth this day is going to pan out considering the rollercoaster of a weekend he\u2019s had. As he mulls over the idea of working alongside Phil, in the classroom, listening to him teach in that eclectic way of his, Dan\u2019s stomach begins to flip.</p><p>How is he going to be able to hide his feelings for Phil, now? The activities they\u2019ve indulged in this weekend are written across his face, surely. Does Phil even intend for them to hide this - whatever this is? He\u2019d said last night that he had a plan that would solve everything, but can that be true?</p><p>Just as this latter thought begins to grow monstrous, evil fangs, poising itself above Dan, ready to sink its teeth in, Phil wanders back into the room. His hair has been tamed somewhat, and there\u2019s a smudge of toothpaste in the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The monster recoils, blinded by Phil\u2019s brilliant radiance. The idea of kissing the speck of toothpaste off of Phil\u2019s mouth is incredibly calming, so Dan gets up, walks over, and does exactly that.</p><p>Phil smiles at him, but there\u2019s a modicum of panic, still, behind his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve let Buffy out quickly and poured her some food,\u201d he says, probably more to himself than anything, Dan thinks. \u201cI don\u2019t have a spare toothbrush I\u2019m afraid, but maybe you could-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan says, trying to sound reassuring despite the anxiety monster still lurking behind him somewhere. \u201cI have some gum in my coat.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs; the sound of it never fails to put Dan at ease. \u201cNice. Okay, I\u2019ll go get Buffy back in, and then we should go. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods. Phil lets out a relieved sigh, and heads out of the room.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan has just closed the passenger door of the car when Phil gasps, turning to Dan, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cThe madeleines!\u201d He hops straight out again, running towards the house full pelt. Dan snorts with laughter, rolling his eyes. They\u2019re already ridiculously late, but God forbid the Year Nine\u2019s don\u2019t receive their baked goods.</p><p>He returns a minute later with two cake tins, one under each arm. As he slips into the driver\u2019s seat, he deposits them on Dan\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cNo snacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t had breakfast,\u201d Dan says, pouting.</p><p>Phil wavers, looking torn. \u201cOkay, you can have one, but you have to share it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Dan says, laughing, and delves into one of the tins.</p><p>He feeds Phil bits of the madeleine as they drive along. Mercifully, the school traffic doesn\u2019t seem particularly bad this morning, and they get there in under ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cEight fifty-one,\u201d Dan says, huffing an impressed laugh. \u201cChrist, I can\u2019t believe we made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was stressful,\u201d Phil says, glancing at his reflection in the rearview mirror. He tuts at whatever he sees, playing with his side fringe and frowning.</p><p>Dan takes hold of his hand, stilling the movements. \u201cYou look irritatingly gorgeous, Phil. Just like every morning.\u201d</p><p>Phil squeezes Dan\u2019s hand, smiling warmly. He holds Dan\u2019s gaze, thumb stroking softly across his knuckle.</p><p>A rap on Dan\u2019s window startles them both. Phil drops Dan\u2019s hand like it\u2019s burning, but it\u2019s too late. The expression on John\u2019s face as he stares through the glass is not a happy one.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Phil hisses under his breath, echoing Dan\u2019s sentiments exactly.</p><p>He rolls down the window, making Dan\u2019s heart race wildly. Could they not just drive away? Speed off into the horizon with their hands linked again, like a male version of Thelma and Louise?</p><p>\u201cMr Howell, Mr Lester,\u201d John greets them coldly. \u201cWould you mind getting out of the car, please?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Given the time restrictions, John tells them both to report to his office at break time. From his tone of voice, Dan highly doubts it\u2019s for a chat over tea and biscuits.</p><p>There\u2019s a decidedly morose atmosphere as Phil hands out the madeleines to the students of their first class. The students seem to pick up on the air of dread that hangs above their teachers\u2019 heads, and murmur to each other quietly, devoid of their usual enthusiasm for Phil\u2019s class. So as not to exacerbate an already bad situation, Dan tries his best not to be too obvious about his and Phil\u2019s dalliance in front of the kids.</p><p>He tries, but they\u2019re not stupid.</p><p>\u201cDid you pop round to Mr Lester\u2019s house just to borrow his shirt this morning, sir?\u201d Matthew asks as Dan is helping him shade a portion of the Arc du Triomphe (they\u2019re continuing with the mural). \u201cOr did he bring it in specially, \u2018cause he thought it\u2019d match your eyes?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, about to deflect this question with something irrelevant, when a voice interrupts him.</p><p>\u201cCram it, Matt. People have the same shirts as other people. Shocker.\u201d</p><p>Dan lifts his eyes to meet Jonah\u2019s as discreetly as he can, sending him a small smile of gratitude. Jonah winks subtly as Matthew rolls his eyes.</p><p>Around half an hour into the lesson, Dan wanders over to Phil, mostly because he cannot help himself. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying not to think about it,\u201d Phil mutters under his breath. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitting myself,\u201d Dan sighs, the butterflies in his stomach reforming in their chrysalises. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a chance we can convince him we were just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding hands in prayer?\u201d Phil asks, bitterly. \u201cPlatonically arriving together, late, with you in my clothes? Oh yeah, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll buy that.\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks, a little taken aback by Phil\u2019s unusual sarcasm. \u201cI guess when you put it that way\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil seems to catch on to the glimmer of hurt in Dan\u2019s voice, because he sighs, linking their little fingers together, out of sight of the kids. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m just worried. I didn\u2019t mean to take it out on you. I get kind of\u2026 moody when I\u2019m stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly it\u2019s pretty hot,\u201d Dan confesses, squeezing Phil\u2019s finger. It makes Phil smile a little, but it\u2019s short lived. \u201cIt might not be as terrible as we think, with John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this has happened already,\u201d Phil says, seeming to ignore Dan\u2019s attempt at reassurance. He looks skyward, shaking his head. \u201cI thought we could at least have a day or two of hiding it so I could figure something out\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, nodding. So there never was a plan, then. Phil had just been saying that to calm him down. It should probably make him annoyed, but it just seems incredibly sweet. Dan sends him a glance that he hopes speaks to this effect, and they both sigh, releasing their fingers.</p><p>\u201cThe kids seem to like the madeleines,\u201d Dan offers, casting a gaze around the classroom.</p><p>Though the students seem a little more subdued than normal, they are undoubtedly enjoying the pleasant atmosphere in here, nibbling on their freshly baked cakes while they colour their favourite scenes of Paris. They lounge about the floor in little groups, chatting quietly, models of behaviour.</p><p>Dan is glad they\u2019re so calm this morning. He\u2019s not sure he could handle any pep.</p><p>\u201cWell, I had a great baking assistant,\u201d Phil says, making Dan smile.</p><p>\u201cPlease, all I did was watch in silent admiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to remember you did a little more than that.\u201d</p><p>Dan splutters, throwing him a dirty look. \u201cSo not the time.\u201d</p><p>Phil just laughs. \u201cJust trying to lighten the mood.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>The door to the Vice Principal\u2019s office is dark green. Fitting, Dan thinks as he stares at the nameplate tacked onto the outside. He checks his phone for the time.</p><p>10:59am.</p><p>He\u2019d kind of hoped he\u2019d run into Phil outside, and that they\u2019d be able to exchange a quick, reassuring look, but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he\u2019s been held up after his second class, and is running late. Whatever the reason, Dan knows it would only make things worse if he were late to this meeting, so he takes a deep breath, and knocks on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Mr Howell,\u201d John\u2019s voice calls.</p><p>It confuses Dan for a moment. How does John know that it\u2019s him? He pushes open the door, his eyebrows lifting as he notes that Phil is already inside, sat on one of the two chairs in front of John\u2019s desk.</p><p>Both he and John turn to face him, and he closes the door behind himself with a small click, feeling like a zoo animal. How long has Phil been here?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Dan says, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>He moves to the seat beside Phil, perching on it awkwardly, heart pounding. Phil catches his eye, giving him a small smile. Dan drinks it in gratefully.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr Howell.\u201d John\u2019s tone of voice is grim. \u201cThank you for coming. Now that you\u2019re both here, I\u2019ll get straight to the point.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, his fingernails digging into his clammy palms. He wishes he could reach across and grab ahold of Phil\u2019s hand, but obviously that would be a pretty bad idea. Instead, he imagines he\u2019s back at Phil\u2019s house, still, beneath the covers beside him, their limbs tangled, their bodies sinking into his soft mattress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s come to the attention of myself and several other staff members that the two of you have violated the terms of your employment,\u201d John says, his fingers lacing together on his desk. \u201cWhilst I hesitate to think of the two of you as being unprofessional, it has come to light that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, can we cut the work jargon and talk properly?\u201d Phil interrupts, his voice so grave that Dan barely recognises it. He blinks at Phil in surprise, mildly concerned about how John might respond. \u201cWe all know why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>John leans back in his chair, sighing loudly. He holds Phil\u2019s gaze for a while, and then nods.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cPhil, Daniel, I\u2019m not going to sugar coat this. There\u2019s substantial evidence that the two of you are romantically involved, and as you are both aware, employee relationships are prohibited in this institution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dan didn\u2019t know,\u201d Phil argues. \u201cHe was rushed through the training programme, he\u2019s still new here. He couldn\u2019t have known such a specific rule unless he was told-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may have been initially true,\u201d John says, his voice a little louder now. \u201cBut as you assured me, Phil, you informed him of the rule after I spoke with you on Tuesday. Yet the two of you have chosen to ignore this, and continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d Dan jumps in, realising a second too late that this perhaps isn\u2019t particularly wise.</p><p>He had no idea of the evidence amounted against them. Jonah could have said anything; Dan doesn\u2019t know for sure. </p><p>\u201cDan, there\u2019s no point-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aside from the majority of the student body passing around gossip of what occurred during the Paris trip,\u201d John begins, silencing Phil before he can get the words out. \u201cThere is the fact that the two of you arrived together this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a crime!\u201d Dan points out.</p><p>\u201cHolding hands in the school parking lot, dressed in each other\u2019s clothes\u2026 Dan, that in itself is enough to prompt speculation amongst the students, which is precisely the reason for the rule in the first place.\u201d John, to his credit, sounds apologetic about his own words. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford this kind of distraction to their learning, particularly when it comes to your class, Mr Lester. You achieve the best history results in the entire school, to have those grades reduce due to your inability to focus on anything but your TA would be catastrophic for the school\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll quit,\u201d Phil says calmly.</p><p>Dan whips his head round to Phil in lightning speed. \u201cWhat? Phil, don\u2019t be crazy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, please,\u201d Phil says, his voice low and quiet. He meets Dan\u2019s gaze, eyes shining with such certainty that Dan slumps in his seat, already feeling defeated. Phil turns back to John, arms folded. \u201cJohn, this rule is antiquated and ridiculous, as you are well aware. I checked my contract, and the rule was implemented in 1957. It\u2019s absurd to think that the same conditions apply now, especially in a case like this, where Dan and I only work together twice a week, for an hour at a time.\u201d</p><p>John, looking a little flustered by Phil\u2019s threat of quitting, wipes a hand across his brow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with you, Phil,\u201d he confesses. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not my decision. I can\u2019t bend the rules just because we\u2019re friends, and I certainly can\u2019t look the other way - not when the students are discussing it all day like it\u2019s a damned television romance-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Phil presses, ignoring John entirely. Dan feels his chest swell with something like pride, watching Phil remain perfectly composed, laying out his argument clearly. \u201cDan has been my assistant since the beginning of term. Whilst our\u2026 mutual feelings have only just been acknowledged,\u201d Phil glances at Dan, smiling very slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019s been \u2018distracting\u2019 me for the whole of that time. Yet if you\u2019ll check my Year Nine and Year Eight class results, you\u2019ll notice that they\u2019re better than ever before. Because Dan is an asset, not a hindrance. He is an excellent TA, probably the best I\u2019ve ever had, helped by the fact that we are so in sync. Our romantic relationship, if anything, makes us stronger as a teaching unit, and allows us to be the best team for the students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do work well together,\u201d Dan agrees quietly. \u201cThe kids all say our lessons are the ones they look forward to, and learn from, the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, if you honestly think that Dan and I being together affects the students negatively, then I\u2019m afraid I will have no choice but to hand in my notice.\u201d Phil\u2019s announcement is like a bomb dropping. A hush falls over the office; even Dan\u2019s hands tighten on the arms of his chair. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to work in such discriminative conditions after I have proven myself to be an excellent teacher here. My relationship to Dan has not affected my performance. I am not prepared to allow my career to interrupt\u2026\u201d he trails off, eyes fixing themselves on Dan\u2019s face. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence, and then John sighs. \u201cPhil, I need you to be completely clear about this. If you are really willing to stake your job on a budding relationship, I advise you to think carefully-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, please, it\u2019s okay, we should talk about-\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, cutting Dan off. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>John looks at him for a long moment, seeming to deliberate. \u201cAlright. Well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that you\u2019re an extremely valuable member of the faculty, Mr Lester. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the school would do a great deal to prevent your departure. Allow me to discuss your ultimatum with the Principal, and we\u2019ll see if we can come to a conclusion of sorts.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes widen. Could John be offering a glimmer of hope?</p><p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d Phil says, moving to stand from his chair. \u201cDan and I will wait for your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d John says, nodding. \u201cI\u2019m promising absolutely nothing, boys. Rules are rules, and you have broken one. I\u2019ll be in touch. In the meantime\u2026 try and behave professionally, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, John,\u201d Phil says dismissively, standing from his chair.</p><p>Dan follows him, legs shaky, and nods at John, who is already dialling his phone. Phil makes a point of holding the door open for him, something that doesn\u2019t escape John\u2019s notice. Dan walks out quietly, and tries to comprehend what on earth just happened. </p><p>*</p><p>As soon as they step out of John\u2019s office, they\u2019re ambushed.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t get a chance to speak to Phil about what he\u2019d said inside, as before he can get the words out, Jonah Frank is in front of them, flanked by Bethany and Savannah, their faces anxious.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in VP Green\u2019s office, sirs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jonah,\u201d Dan says, glancing at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is the time\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just having a meeting, guys,\u201d Phil tells them vaguely. \u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about you guys hookin\u2019 up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jonah asks, making Dan roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jonah,\u201d he says under his breath.</p><p>He supposes it doesn\u2019t matter if the whole corridor hears now, however. The students apparently discuss the idea of he and Phil as a couple freely, despite their efforts to hide things.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool, Mr Howell,\u201d Savannah says. \u201cBeth and I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys\u2026 we can\u2019t discuss things with you, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil cuts in, perpetually the voice of reason. He always knows what to say. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know what happens if it gets to that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so it\u2019s true, then?\u201d Jonah\u2019s face is alarmed. \u201cYou guys could be canned?\u201d</p><p>Dan and Phil exchange a glance. Phil seems to deliberate on his wording. \u201cThere\u2019s a\u2026 possibility of suspension, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit\u2026\u201d Jonah says; the girls cover their mouths with their hands. \u201cThis is all my fault. I should\u2019a just kept my mouth shut. I didn\u2019t think VP Green\u2019d actually sack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did we,\u201d Dan mutters.</p><p>\u201cJonah, don\u2019t blame yourself for anything that might happen,\u201d Phil tells him firmly. \u201cNothing is certain anyway, but even if it ended up that Mr Howell or I lost our jobs, it would be the result of our own actions, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sake, I hate this place,\u201d Jonah spits, glaring at VP Green\u2019s closed door. \u201cThe only good thing about it is you an\u2019 your class, Mr Lester. And now that might be gone, too.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings then, and Dan sighs, resolving to discuss the meeting with Phil later. He gives Phil a grim smile, waggling his fingers at him, and takes a deep breath, about to start off towards the Science Block. Before he can take a step however, Jonah speaks again.</p><p>\u201cOi, sirs, I\u2019m gonna fix it, yeah?\u201d He says, looking fearsome. \u201cLeave it to me, I got you into trouble I know - but I\u2019m good at gettin\u2019 out of it.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiles fondly, finding his surety very touching. \u201cSweet of you to try, Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you just have to let things unfold, Jonah,\u201d Phil tells him wisely, then waves goodbye, walking briskly off towards his own classroom.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t get a chance to speak to Phil about what happened until lunch. He finds Phil in the staffroom making coffee, dark circles under his eyes. When he sees Dan approach, he offers him the cup he\u2019s just made straight away, and turns back to the pot to pour another.</p><p>Dan\u2019s opening line dies on his lips, touched by the small gesture. \u201cHow are you?\u201d He asks instead. </p><p>Phil offers him a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been better, honestly.\u201d</p><p>Dan shuts his eyes, sighing into his coffee. \u201cPhil\u2026 why did you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get them to listen,\u201d Phil says before Dan can get the words out. \u201cThe rule is stupid and pointless. Even if I have to walk over this, the system is oppressive and needs to change. This could force their hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a risk, Phil. I should be the one to leave, not you.\u201d</p><p>Phil peers over his freshly made cup, a smirk on his lips. \u201cNo offence, Dan, but I don\u2019t think you walking out would quite carry the same weight. You\u2019ve been here a couple of months. I\u2019ve been here for two years.\u201d</p><p>In his heart, Dan knows that what Phil is saying makes sense. Even so, the idea of Phil quitting his job, which he loves, deeply, just for him - it\u2019s too much. Too big of a sacrifice. Dan isn\u2019t worth that kind of gesture. </p><p>\u201cThis is so unfair,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He can feel himself getting choked up out of frustration, tears stinging in his eyes. He knows it\u2019s just because he\u2019s overtired and stressed, but it\u2019s still embarrassing, having Phil see. Luckily for him, Phil is the most wonderful creation in the universe, so he puts down his coffee and ushers Dan into the staff bathroom.</p><p>Safely sealed inside the private space, Phil pulls Dan into his arms, wrapping him up tightly. He kisses Dan\u2019s forehead, rocking gently as Dan struggles to hold himself together.</p><p>\u201cNe t'inqui\u00e8te pas,\u201d he whispers. \u201cJe te tiens.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>They don\u2019t hear from John for the rest of the day. Dan wanders into Phil\u2019s classroom just after the last bell, sitting down on one of the student\u2019s desks with a sigh. Phil watches him while he tidies some things away on his desk, smiling sadly.</p><p>\u201cWanna come over for a while?\u201d</p><p>Dan thinks about it for a moment, then nods. \u201cI haven\u2019t brushed my teeth since Sunday morning. Just so you\u2019re aware before you get too hospitable.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles, wandering over to him. \u201cWe can pick you up a toothbrush on the way.\u201d</p><p>They both glance over at the classroom door, checking it\u2019s closed before they touch. Dan winds his arms around Phil\u2019s waist, resting his head on Phil\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cFor me to keep at your house?\u201d Dan asks into Phil\u2019s breastbone. \u201cNext thing you know I\u2019ll have a whole drawer there, Phil. Steady on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d happily give you a whole chest of drawers, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Dan lifts his head, staring at Phil with a frown. \u201cIt\u2019s only been like a week since you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon,\u201d Phil tells him, leaning in to kiss him very gently. \u201cJe te connais depuis toujours.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br>um\u2026 are u dead</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>only internally</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br>are u ever coming home or</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>no u guys pissed me off too much<br>and im moving out baiii</p><p><b>Tyler<br></b>ah, k. how is it in ur new home? dark?<br>cramped?</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>???</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br>well i assume you\u2019ve now moved<br>permanently into phil\u2019s ass</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>TYLER HE FUCKING READ THAT<br>I HATE U</p><p><b>Tyler<br></b>miss u and ur screaming :( come home<br>soon we have much to gossip about x</p><p><b>Dan</b><br>i\u2019ll be home tonight or tomorrow xx</p><p>*</p><p>They\u2019re on Phil\u2019s sofa, Dan\u2019s head in Phil\u2019s lap, Buffy snoozing on Dan\u2019s chest, when a random thought occurs to him.</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>Dan stares up at him, the sharp cut of his jawline, stubbled and pretty, catching his eye.</p><p>\u201cYou said you have a tattoo.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches, almost imperceptibly. \u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>Thor is playing in the background on Phil\u2019s TV, but neither of them have been paying close attention. They\u2019ve both seen it before, and besides, Dan\u2019s far more interested in tracing the contours of Phil\u2019s pretty face with his eyes from below. Not to mention, Phil\u2019s hand has been in his hair for some time now, massaging gently. It\u2019s still curly from yesterday, as the kids had been all too gleeful to point out for the entire day.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes.\u201d Dan tries to sit up a little, but Buffy is having none of it. He rolls his eyes at her indignant expression, sinking back onto Phil\u2019s lap. \u201cOn the boat, when we were playing that game with the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh, strange,\u201d Phil says, that hint of a smile still playing on his lips.</p><p>Dan just stares at him. \u201cSo\u2026 do you, or don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a silence. Phil picks up his tea and takes a long drink of it, then places it carefully back on the arm of the sofa. His eyes drag slowly down to Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to find out.\u201d</p><p>Buffy squeals in indignation as she is pushed off Dan\u2019s chest, but he has no time to apologise to her. He climbs up onto Phil\u2019s lap in seconds, hands at the collar of his shirt immediately. Phil laughs at his eagerness, welcoming the kisses Dan plants on his lips.</p><p>It takes only a few seconds to get Phil\u2019s shirt open, but it feels like centuries go by. Dan tugs at it impatiently, yanking it over his shoulders and trying to shove it down his arms. Phil is laughing still, apparently finding Dan\u2019s efforts extremely amusing, but going along with it anyway.</p><p>It\u2019s his own fault, anyway, Dan thinks. He can\u2019t just dangle the prospect of a hidden tattoo in front of him without expecting to be ravished. He gasps as Phil\u2019s hands find his bum, moving Dan in closer with a strong, sharp pull. Dan wiggles in his lap, drawing away from Phil\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cHands off, I need to get you naked,\u201d Dan complains, frustrated. Phil is surprisingly strong.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get naked after,\u201d Dan explains impatiently, making Phil laugh.</p><p>It seems to do the trick though, as he releases his hold on Dan\u2019s bum, and allows the shirt to slip completely off his body. Dan sits back, surveying the exposed flesh. It\u2019s safe to say that Phil\u2019s chest and stomach are decidedly unblemished, and devoid of anything but miles of gorgeous, pale skin. Dan runs his fingers over it anyway, lifting each of Phil\u2019s arms and peering at them, dragging his lips down their lengths, shoulder to each fingertip.</p><p>When he\u2019s satisfied that neither arm is inked, he leans back again, catching sight of Phil\u2019s amused smile.</p><p>\u201cI might have to be extremely thorough,\u201d Dan warns him, entirely serious. \u201cI plan to leave no place unsearched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Detective Howell,\u201d Phil says, nodding sombrely. \u201cI completely understand.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Dan slips off Phil\u2019s lap and onto the floor, landing between his legs. He kneels up, reaching at once for Phil\u2019s belt and fly, wanting to waste no time. He\u2019s always had a weakness for tattoos. He\u2019s too scared to actually get one himself, too anxious of a person to trust his decision for such a permanent thing, but on other people - it\u2019s incredibly attractive.</p><p>If Phil really does possess a tattoo, Dan thinks as he slides Phil\u2019s jeans down his legs, it means there are all sorts of things about him that Dan doesn\u2019t know, potentially. The thought excites him. Will the tattoo be something tribal, to represent an aspect of Phil\u2019s personality? Will it be a memory, shared with someone Dan doesn\u2019t know? Will it be just a pattern Phil liked? Or a caricature of Justin Bieber on one of his buttcheeks?</p><p>Dan thinks he might\u2019ve noticed that last one before now, but he doesn\u2019t know for sure. He hadn\u2019t really been paying close attention to Phil\u2019s nether regions when they\u2019d been on display yesterday; Phil\u2019s actions had been\u2026 rather distracting, as he recalls.</p><p>Once Phil\u2019s jeans are off, Dan gets to work, taking Phil\u2019s leg and extending it out before inspecting it closely, pressing little kisses as he goes. He checks from ankle to thigh, even peering at the space behind Phil\u2019s knee.</p><p>He takes Phil\u2019s feet in his hand one at a time, peeling off the socks to check every toe.</p><p>\u201cKnew you had a foot fetish,\u201d Phil says, watching him with a grin.</p><p>Just to mess with him, Dan licks a stripe up the underside of his left foot, making him shriek. \u201cFor these babies, I might.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs, and Dan moves back to his former position, knelt between his legs on the floor.</p><p>\u201cGive up?\u201d Phil asks, a teasing lilt to his voice.</p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cAs if. I\u2019m just getting started, mate.\u201d</p><p>He trails his hands up Phil\u2019s thighs then, already drunk on the little gasping noise that slips from Phil\u2019s mouth. He hooks his fingers into the elastic of Phil\u2019s boxers, pulling them carefully down as Phil lifts his bum from the sofa.</p><p>As ever, the sight of him, naked and aroused, is enough to knock the air out of Dan\u2019s lungs. He can\u2019t help the tiny groan that falls from his lips, just as he can\u2019t stop himself leaning in and taking hold of Phil\u2019s length in one hand, and slipping his mouth over the tip.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he hears Phil say, making him shiver.</p><p>Phil is smooth and slick as Dan allows the length of him to slide into his mouth. He can feel his mouth being stretched wide, can feel the tip nudging the back of his throat. Dan swallows, moaning a little, his eyes fluttering as the taste of Phil filters through. He lets himself sink down, relishing the sensation Phil pushing so far inside.</p><p>He reaches down to palm himself through his jeans, just to relieve some of the pressure building up there. He starts to bob his head, letting Phil\u2019s breathy noises guide him into what\u2019s good and what isn\u2019t. He works his hand too, allowing his lips to meet the circle of his fist.</p><p>\u201cDan, baby, that\u2019s so\u2026 oh, fuck\u2026.\u201d Phil is saying, babbling really.</p><p>After a while, Dan forces himself to pull off; Phil lets out an agonised cry. Dan wipes the corner of his mouth, smirking. \u201cHang on. I\u2019m still looking for something.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s responding groan is anguished, but Dan doesn\u2019t allow it to deter him. Instead, he grabs Phil\u2019s hands and pulls him down to his level, into his lap, so that Phil\u2019s legs straddle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a tease,\u201d Phil tells him, practically pouting.</p><p>Dan just grins. \u201cIt\u2019s payback for all the totally outside-the-rules flirting during school hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm, try every fucking day.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhatever, I hate you. Please just hurry up and find it.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows raise at this instruction, catching the implication that there is, at least, something to find. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a glimmer of something wicked in Phil\u2019s eyes, but he does so, carefully twisting around on Dan\u2019s lap. He leans forwards, arms braced against the sofa cushion in front of them both, sat on Dan\u2019s knees still, now with his back on show.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes rake down the canvas of Phil\u2019s skin; immediately he understands why he hadn\u2019t noticed the tattoo until now. It\u2019s low down, on Phil\u2019s left side, wrapped around the back of his hip.</p><p>Dan stares at it for a long time before reaching out to trace it, lightly, using just the tips of his fingers. He didn\u2019t realise tattoos this pretty existed. It\u2019s like a piece of art.</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d Dan observes, his finger edging along the skyline, drawn so neatly, so simply, into Phil\u2019s skin.</p><p>The thin line is unbroken, as if it\u2019s all connected, the outline of the Eiffel Tower joined to the Sacre Coeur, and the Moulin Rouge. It\u2019s minimalistic, to say the least, just one long, very thin black line, outlining the city.</p><p>It\u2019s incredibly beautiful. It seems to fit on Phil\u2019s body, resting delicately on his hip, as if he\u2019d been born with it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Phil sighs, the line of his shoulders shifting. \u201cClich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Dan leans his cheek against the space between Phil\u2019s shoulder blades, staring down at it across the desert of Phil\u2019s back. \u201cPhil, it\u2019s beautiful. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, and Dan leans up to kiss him. He wraps his arms around Phil\u2019s waist, dragging him backwards until they\u2019re back to chest. He can feel Phil\u2019s irregular breathing, and he treasures the sound, mentally saving it on a loop for when he\u2019s alone, and needs to remember how wrecked he can, somehow, make this man, scintillating as he is.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hands glide down Phil\u2019s chest and stomach, his chin tucked over one shoulder, pressing kisses at the base of his neck. He takes hold of Phil\u2019s erection, still full and proud, damp now from the anticipation, and starts stroking him gently.</p><p>Phil\u2019s head falls backwards, the base of his skull brushing Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDan\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTes mains se sentent incroyables,\u201d Phil croaks out.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand stops moving. \u201cWhat are you saying? It\u2019s not fair, I can\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>Phil turns his head to look Dan in the eye, clearly surprised. \u201cNothing, I\u2019m just\u2026 saying you feel good.\u201d</p><p>The answer frustrates him in its ambiguity. \u201cWill you translate for me, at least?\u201d</p><p>The crinkles around Phil\u2019s eyes deepen, and he smirks.. \u201cI said\u2026 your hands feel incredible.\u201d</p><p>Dan flushes immediately, caught off guard. \u201cO-oh.\u201d</p><p>Phil surges up and kisses him then, slow and teasing, licking against Dans lower lip. \u201cS\u2019il te plait\u2026 ne tu arrete pas.\u201d</p><p>Dan feels the goosebumps rip over his skin. \u201cWhat did you say then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said please don\u2019t stop,\u201d Phil says, and Dan bites his lip. As requested, he starts moving his hand again, and Phil\u2019s head flops backwards, eyes closing.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u2026.\u201d Dan whispers, suddenly indescribably turned on, staring down over Phil\u2019s shoulder at the expanse of his naked body. \u201cWill you\u2026\u201d</p><p>He hesitates, and Phil opens one eye, a sliver of ice blue visible around the black hole of his pupil. \u201cWill I\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing his embarrassment, Dan moves his mouth until his lips are brushing the shell of Phil\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cBaise-moi,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Phil grabs hold of Dan\u2019s wrist, stilling the movement around his erection. \u201cMon dieu, Daniel. Where did you learn\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan laughs a little, unwrapping his fingers from Phil\u2019s length, sensing he might be rather close to the edge as it is. If Dan\u2019s going to get what he wants, he needs to move quickly. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026 looking up some words and phrases. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>He hears Phil take a deep breath, and then he stands, chucking a mischievous glance over his shoulder at Dan as he sashays across the room towards his bedroom. Dan stares for a moment, mesmerised by the sight of his naked backside, the newly revealed tattoo resting above it, before he scrambles to his feet and runs after him.</p><p>Excited by Dan\u2019s brisk movements, Buffy trots along behind him, her tongue out, happily ignorant of the sin in front of her twitching nose. Dan reaches down to pat her, gently pointing her in the other direction. </p><p>He slips into Phil\u2019s room and quickly shuts the door on her, feeling bad, but knowing that it was necessary. </p><p>By the time Dan turns around, Phil is reclined on his bed, squeezing something clear and gel-like into his palm from a small purple bottle. Wanting to waste no time, Dan peels off the shirt Phil lent him, and unfastens his jeans, shimmying them off as he dives onto the bed.</p><p>Phil laughs at his eagerness, rolling them over so he\u2019s on top of Dan, eyes hooded. \u201cTu sembles impatient, ce soir.\u201d</p><p>Heart fluttering, Dan swats him gently in the shoulder. \u201cEnglish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d Phil growls, his fingers already sliding Dan\u2019s briefs down his thighs. \u201cYou seem impatient, this evening.\u201d</p><p>Dan feels the flush as it ripples down his throat. He shouldn\u2019t have asked. \u201cC-can you blame me?\u201d</p><p>Phil nips at the base of his neck, where there are already a bouquet of bruises, barely coverable by the shirts he wears to school. \u201cI quite like it, actually.\u201d</p><p>Before Dan can respond, Phil\u2019s hand is wrapping around his erection, slippery and warm, his fingers curling tightly as he slicks them up and down.</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d Dan moans, his hips bucking into Phil\u2019s fist. \u201cHoly fucking shit, Phil. Excuse my French.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorts with laughter.</p><p>All of a sudden, any ability to be funny slips away as Dan feels the fingers of Phil\u2019s other hand slipping between his cheeks, pressing firmly against his hole. He sucks in a breath, his body twitching in surprise. Phil just continues stroking up and down his length with one hand, his other fingers circling Dan\u2019s rim.</p><p>The over-stimulation might actually be enough to make him black out, Dan thinks vaguely.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan curses again, his hands winding into Phil\u2019s covers, pulling them free of the corners. \u201cOh God,\u201d he groans. \u201cPlease fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles again, but he sounds a little strung out, if Dan isn\u2019t mistaken. \u201cTu es trop pleurniches.\u201d He sighs, pushing his finger inside, making Dan groan. \u201cEt trop joli.\u201d Dan hits him in the shoulder again, making Phil laugh. \u201cI said you\u2019re so whiny.\u201d</p><p>Something seems off about Phil\u2019s translation, but it\u2019s hard to concentrate on that when Phil\u2019s finger is pressing so deeply into him, making him squirm. He continues pumping his hand over Dan\u2019s length too, which is dizzyingly hot, so Dan just writhes and whimpers, clinging to the bedsheets for dear life.</p><p>Phil is quick about opening him up, this time, for which Dan is grateful. There\u2019s still a slight burn, as he\u2019s far from used to this yet, but he would gladly endure ten times the pain for the experience of having Phil inside of him like before. Once he\u2019s three fingers deep, Phil crooks his fingers, deftly, seeming to know exactly how and where, and Dan chokes off a low, rumbling moan of ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cIci, mon ange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnngh, Phil talk in English, please,\u201d Dan begs, his face turning to burrow into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phil mutters, seeming to pause before translating this time. \u201cHere, Dan?\u201d He pushes against Dan\u2019s prostate again, making him yelp.</p><p>Yet again, Dan\u2019s not sure that Phil actually said that, but he doesn\u2019t have it in him to argue. So he just nods, biting down on his lip, possibly a little too hard.</p><p>Phil draws his hands free of Dan, eliciting a groan of anguish from him. Dan sits up, bewildered and affronted by this action. Phil just giggles at his expression, and picks up the bottle of lube from wherever he dropped it last. He holds it up to Dan in explanation.</p><p>\u201cHm, I hope I have some condoms in here,\u201d Phil mutters, reaching across to dig into his bedside drawer. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d Dan says, impatient. \u201cI\u2019ve never even done this with anyone but you. Are you clean?\u201d</p><p>Phil turns to him in surprise. He nods, pressing his lips together. \u201cI am,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut maybe- just to be sure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you Phil, Christ,\u201d Dan argues, kicking him in the leg. \u201cGet over here.\u201d</p><p>To Dan\u2019s sheer relief, Phil does as asked, crawling towards him. He kneels by Dan\u2019s legs, squeezing another dollop of lube onto his outstretched palm. As he rubs his fingers together, he drags his eyes over Dan\u2019s body; absurdly, it makes Dan blush.</p><p>\u201cTurn over,\u201d Phil instructs, sending a lance of hot, debilitating arousal through Dan\u2019s body.</p><p>His breaths become a little more difficult to catch, for some reason, and fall from his mouth in short, stuttery gasps as he rolls onto his stomach, desperate to obey Phil\u2019s command. He hears a slick sound, and imagines the sight of Phil\u2019s fist pumping over himself, covering his flushed erection with the lubricant. He feels Phil\u2019s hands on his hips, canting them upwards, so that Dan\u2019s face presses into the mattress.</p><p>His lungs tighten, face on fire as he thinks about how exposed he is. \u201cPh-phil, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Phil says; Dan feels him dragging the tip of his length over his rim, and his hips twitch in Phil\u2019s hands. \u201cYou\u2019re so good, Dan. So gorgeous. There\u2019s no word for how you look in French. Gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Dan directs his ragged breathing into the covers of Phil\u2019s bed. He feels the familiar burn of being stretched open as Phil pushes in, going slow again, one thumb stroking gently over his hipbone.</p><p>Nobody has ever called him anything other than \u2018hot\u2019 before. Stephanie used to call him cute sometimes, or tell him he looked sexy in a certain shirt, but \u2018gorgeous\u2019? That\u2019s a word he would never have associated with his appearance. It\u2019s a loaded word, heavier than beautiful, more charged with attraction, with want.</p><p>His cheeks burn. \u2018Gorgeous\u2019 is how Phil sees him, even like this.</p><p>He pushes his hips backwards, feeling Phil slip further inside. He can tell the movement takes Phil by surprise, because Phil\u2019s hands tighten on his hips, as if trying to slow him down. But Dan doesn\u2019t want to slow down. He wants Phil to wreck him, to split him apart with his face crushed into the green-blue of his bedspread.</p><p>He lifts his head, intending to tell Phil exactly this. \u201cYou can be rougher, if you want,\u201d he says, voice scratchy and weak. \u201cI won\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>A tiny moan spills from Phil\u2019s throat. It makes Dan smile, proud. \u201cTell me if I hurt you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it bad if I don\u2019t really mind?\u201d</p><p>The only answer Dan receives is a mildly strangled sound, followed by Phil thrusting his hips forwards so abruptly that Dan cries out. Immediately, Phil stills behind him, leaning forwards in alarm.</p><p>\u201cShit, did I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d Dan urges, reaching back blindly in order to grab one of Phil\u2019s thighs.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of hesitation, and then Phil is drawing back, sliding out of Dan before thrusting back in, slick and fast, the top of his thighs hitting Dan\u2019s buttocks with a slap. Then, he does it a third time. Dan\u2019s mouth falls open, pressing back into the sensation, rocking back into Phil\u2019s movements.</p><p>\u201cShit\u2026\u201d Phil says, setting up a rhythm now. \u201cI warn you, Dan, I\u2019m pretty close\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe- me too,\u201d Dan manages to stutter around the rough, lustful moans that refuse to stop bubbling out of his chest. \u201cFucking\u2026 Christ, Phil, fuck me, yeah\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe pourrais te baiser pour toujours, Dan,\u201d Phil garbles, obviously on the edge. His movements are erratic now, sloppier, with less control. \u201cTu es parfait, tu es parfait-\u201d</p><p>His own shout of ecstasy cuts him off, and Dan feels the warmth, the spasm, as Phil comes into him, pushing himself deeply as he spreads his chest against Dan\u2019s back. He bites Dan\u2019s shoulder, hips twitching; it\u2019s hands down the hottest thing Dan has ever experienced. He thrusts himself against the mattress, desperate for friction.</p><p>Suddenly, Phil is easing out of him, and Dan is being flipped over. Phil\u2019s tongue drags itself over his chest, down his stomach, and then a mouth is slipping over his straining erection, engulfing him entirely. It takes approximately three seconds before Dan is toppling into his climax, the force of it pushing an agonised scream from his throat. He\u2019s sure he momentarily glimpses infinity, sizzling around him in the form of a neon, pulsating nebula.</p><p>When he crashes back down to earth, Phil is draped over him, his nose just below Dan\u2019s ear, his arm slung across Dan\u2019s chest. Both of their chests are heaving - their exhaustion the only sound in the silent room.</p><p>After a moment, Dan can hear a faint scrabbling against the closed bedroom door. Poor Buffy, he thinks absently. She must be so jealous that Dan is stealing all of her father\u2019s attention.</p><p>Dan finds Phil\u2019s hand and winds their fingers together, both their palms damp with exertion.</p><p>\u201cAs far as distractions from things we\u2019re trying not to think about go,\u201d Dan says to the ceiling. \u201cThat was pretty good.\u201d</p><p>Phil lifts his head, looking affronted. \u201c\u2019Pretty good\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Dan laughs, breathless. \u201cIn this instance, \u2018pretty good\u2019 means the absolute best sex I\u2019ve ever had, ever.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles, satisfied, and rests his head back on Dan\u2019s shoulder, playing with his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know that even if we get sacked, we\u2019ll still be able to console ourselves with amazing sex, I guess,\u201d Dan jokes, but he can feel it falls flat against Phil\u2019s ears.</p><p>There\u2019s a silence.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get fired, Dan,\u201d Phil says softly. He\u2019s tracing up each of Dan\u2019s fingers in turn.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d stay working in a school that kicked out the only good teacher they\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Phil, don\u2019t,\u201d Dan says firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re the only reason that job is bearable. I couldn\u2019t work there if I couldn\u2019t see you every day. There\u2019s no way I could be professional. I wouldn\u2019t be able to smile at John, or have a coffee with him in the staffroom, knowing full well that he stole you away from me, for something so\u2026. completely unfair.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s fingers trickle up and down his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t make you do anything, or not do anything. But you should think carefully. I can get another job. It would be harder for you. You don\u2019t have as much experience working in schools. We\u2019d make it work, still, even if I do end up having to quit. We can see each other after work, all the time. It might not be so bad.\u201d</p><p>Dan wriggles in Phil\u2019s arms, turning so they\u2019re laying face to face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work where you\u2019re not. That\u2019s so sad.\u201d</p><p>Phil reaches up to trace the curve of his face. \u201cI know, gorgeous.\u201d The tips of Dan\u2019s ears burn, still not used to hearing the endearment. \u201cI don\u2019t either. Mais c\u2019est la vie.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Phil is laying on his front, and Dan is appreciating the view. They\u2019ve been on his bed for some time now, talking about nothing as the light pouring through Phil\u2019s big windows fades into a softer, duller evening glow.</p><p>For what must be the hundredth time, Dan leans down to Phil\u2019s left hip, and presses his mouth to the tattoo he can\u2019t stop staring at. Just like every time, Phil\u2019s breath hitches, like he can\u2019t quite believe the sensation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so much prettier than I thought it would be,\u201d Dan confesses, making Phil giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think it would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ninja turtle? A portrait of Buffy\u2019s face? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffy as in my dog, or Sarah Michelle Gellar?\u201d</p><p>Dan considers this, laughing. \u201cEither. Both.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs then as well, gazing at Dan over his shoulder. Dan\u2019s fingers trace the Paris skyline once again, his face dreamy. \u201cYou really like it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A light blush peppers Dan\u2019s cheekbones, and he shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201d Phil looks curious, but says nothing. \u201cWhen did you get it?\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden, Phil\u2019s expression grows a little colder. He turns from Dan, averting his gaze. \u201cIn Paris. When I lived there.\u201d</p><p>Confused by the sudden change in atmosphere, Dan feels his curiosity perking up. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, trying to sound casual. \u201cOn your own, or\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil sighs, and he glances at Dan, conflicted. After a moment, he seems to relent. \u201cNo. Not alone.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, nonchalant. \u201cWas it\u2026 with that guy you mentioned? Your ex?\u201d The nod Phil gives him doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise, but it still winds a thick coil of jealousy around Dan\u2019s chest, squeezing so tightly that he coughs. \u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>Seeing straight through his attempt at remaining calm and collected, Phil laughs, reaching for Dan\u2019s hand. Dan lets him take it, feeling foolish. He has no right to be jealous of something that happened before he even knew Phil, he knows. It\u2019s not like this guy, whoever he is, is still around.</p><p>Still, as Dan stares at the tattoo, he can\u2019t help wondering how serious this past relationship must have been, or at least felt, for Phil to do something so permanent about it.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Phil tells him, rolling onto his back, rendering the tattoo invisible again. He tugs Dan towards him, until they\u2019re laying next to each other, Dan nestled beneath Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cIt seems crazy, that I tattooed myself over something that fell apart. I swear I\u2019m not usually that reckless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is small, and he detests it.</p><p>Phil sighs, the arm around Dan\u2019s shoulder tightening. \u201cI was young and stupid, basically. I thought I was in love.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand places itself over Phil\u2019s heart; for some reason, he suddenly feels terrified. Love? Phil was, potentially, in love with another man? The thought shouldn\u2019t be surprising, as Phil is older, and has had a whole life without him. Still, the idea is difficult to comprehend.</p><p>He tries to picture Phil directing his sunny smile at another person - another, faceless man. He imagines the hand in his wound into someone else\u2019s. He pictures Phil\u2019s lips against this mystery person\u2019s skin. His brain rejects the imaginings as they come, vehemently.</p><p>Who is this person that had such a hold on Phil, Dan wonders. </p><p>Is he French? </p><p>Did they speak to one another in a language Dan can\u2019t grasp?</p><p>Did they wander the streets of Paris together, making shared memories that Dan will never be a part of?</p><p>Did he love Phil back? </p><p>Does he think of Phil, still, today? Does he pine after him, wondering where he is, and if he should swim the channel, turn up on Phil\u2019s doorstep and whisk him away again?</p><p>\u201cDan? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods, but even he can feel how insincere his answer is. Phil tilts his chin up with one finger, forcing Dan to meet his eye. He\u2019s smiling gently; Dan watches, going a little cross-eyed as Phil leans in to kiss his nose.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, Dan.\u201d Something about the soft surety of Phil\u2019s voice puts Dan instantly at ease. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very nice, in the end. It took me a while to realise it, I guess. I was so besotted. I was in Paris. I got swept up in the romanticism of being there, of the cute caf\u00e9 dates, and holding his hand as we walked over padlocked bridges. I thought he was just as infatuated as I was. I didn\u2019t question it when I told him I wanted a tattoo, to commemorate my time there, with him, and he didn\u2019t want one too.\u201d</p><p>Phil stops speaking, looking into the space behind Dan, lost in thought. There\u2019s a sad, distant smile on his lips. Dan reaches up to stroke it with his fingers, making Phil refocus on his face.</p><p>He feels the smile stretch beneath the pad of his finger, watches the light flicker back into a warm glow behind Phil\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt used to make me feel sad, whenever I caught a glimpse of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tattoo?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Too many tainted memories attached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make you sad anymore?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Dan,\u201d Phil tells him, their noses brushing. \u201cI made new memories in Paris. Better ones. With you.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/170620415840/lhistoire-fran%C3%A7aise-new-chapter\"><b>(Chapter Fifteen!)\u00a0</b></a></p>",

In the dream, he&rsquo;d been lying in a bed of squishy dough, warm and snug in a toasty oven. Every so often, the door of the oven would open, and Phil&rsquo;s big, sunny face would peer through the crack to check on him, his broad smile big and soothing as gazed in at Dan, slowly baking away.<b><br /></b></p><p>As the barks rouse him, he frowns, rather worried about his brain. Who dreams about being baked, and enjoys it?</p><p>He realises that he&rsquo;s stiflingly hot, buried beneath several layers of quilt, which explains the dream a little more. As he pushes the covers away, he realises that there&rsquo;s something heavy draped over his waist, and turns, surprised, to see Phil laying beside him, his glasses on, skewed on his nose.</p><p>Dan looks down at his own body, and realises that he and Phil are both fully dressed. They must have fallen asleep cuddling on his bed. Which means, Dan thinks, connecting the dots, that the barking is Buffy.</p><p>Smiling to himself, Dan moves a little closer to Phil, placing a hand on his chest. His heartbeat is slow and steady, lost as he is to dream, still. Just because he can, Dan presses a kiss to Phil&rsquo;s lips, letting himself linger against them. There&rsquo;s a hint of stubble on Phil&rsquo;s chin, scritching pleasantly at Dan&rsquo;s skin. He hums into the kiss, enjoying himself thoroughly.</p><p>It&rsquo;s at that moment that Phil&rsquo;s eyes peel open, blinking in astonishment as he takes in the sight of Dan, close and kissing him, in his bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Wha&hellip; Dan,&rdquo; Phil says, frowning. He leans backwards, and reaches up to remove his glasses. There are red, deep set marks where the frames have dug into his nose and cheek. Dan wants to run his fingers over them, to kiss them each in turn. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the&hellip; is it morning?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil turns, blearily, and stares out of the window at the early light filtering in. Then, he curses, sharp and urgent, sitting up abruptly.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Dan asks, sitting up with him.</p><p>How could anything be wrong, right now? He woke up in Phil&rsquo;s arms. This day is already the most perfect in creation.</p><p>Phil turns to him, obviously panicked, and grabs his phone. When he sees the screen, he curses again. He looks at Dan, alarmed. &ldquo;Dan, it&rsquo;s Monday morning.&rdquo;</p><p>It takes Dan a moment, and then his eyes grow round and wide, matching Phil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Oh, shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When you fell asleep on me, I told myself I&rsquo;d just watch the end of the episode and then I&rsquo;d take you home, but I was so sleepy and-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Dan asks, trying to remain calm.</p><p>&ldquo;Eight thirty-three,&rdquo; Phil answers, checking his phone again.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not really the time to be thinking it, but Dan can&rsquo;t help notice how good Phil looks, with his messy bed hair and rumpled clothes. He replays the moment before he must have dozed off last night, when Phil&rsquo;s hand had inched its way into his jeans as Buffy Summers kicked the ass of a demonic creature in the background.</p><p>It had been, in Dan&rsquo;s opinion, a handjob worthy of a Nobel Prize. It had also, apparently, wiped them both out.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, did you hear me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil lets out a frustrated little groan, then seizes Dan&rsquo;s face in his hands. &ldquo;Dan, you&rsquo;re very cute and everything, but we need to get up. I&rsquo;m usually at work by eight-thirty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Dan says, trying as hard as he can not to get lost in the infinity pools of Phil&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Yeah, shit, sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil leans in and presses a rather cruelly brief kiss to his lips, then swings his legs out of the bed. As he watches Phil flitting around the room, peeling off his jumper with one hand, grabbing for his shoes with the other, a realisation washes over Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t have my work clothes,&rdquo; he says, trying hard not to panic.</p><p>Phil turns to him, chest bare. He looks at the shirt in his hand, a purple and black plaid number that he&rsquo;s plucked from the wardrobe. He throws it at Dan without hesitation, then dives back into the wardrobe to find another.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, um, thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; Phil says, pulling on a dark blue shirt now, covered in little corgis. &ldquo;Hurry up though, we need to leave in like ten minutes if we&rsquo;re going to make it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nods, deciding to swallow his desire to ask for a different, plainer shirt. He can suck up wearing some colour for one day. He pulls off the Sunnydale High jumper Phil lent him yesterday, and slips Phil&rsquo;s shirt on. He catches Phil looking, a fleeting glance at the revealed skin, and smirks.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr Lester, I will not be ogled.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil chuckles, sitting on the bed to pull on his socks. When he&rsquo;s finished, he leans over and kisses Dan on the cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;I like it when you wear my things,&rdquo; he says. Dan&rsquo;s face heats immediately, making Phil laugh and poke him. &ldquo;Wish I could just drag you back into bed, to be honest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not allowed to say that if you want me to hurry up,&rdquo; Dan complains as Phil stands up again, ducking out of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop being so pretty then,&rdquo; he calls from somewhere else in the house.</p><p>Dan sighs, wondering how on earth this day is going to pan out considering the rollercoaster of a weekend he&rsquo;s had. As he mulls over the idea of working alongside Phil, in the classroom, listening to him teach in that eclectic way of his, Dan&rsquo;s stomach begins to flip.</p><p>How is he going to be able to hide his feelings for Phil, now? The activities they&rsquo;ve indulged in this weekend are written across his face, surely. Does Phil even intend for them to hide this - whatever this is? He&rsquo;d said last night that he had a plan that would solve everything, but can that be true?</p><p>Just as this latter thought begins to grow monstrous, evil fangs, poising itself above Dan, ready to sink its teeth in, Phil wanders back into the room. His hair has been tamed somewhat, and there&rsquo;s a smudge of toothpaste in the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The monster recoils, blinded by Phil&rsquo;s brilliant radiance. The idea of kissing the speck of toothpaste off of Phil&rsquo;s mouth is incredibly calming, so Dan gets up, walks over, and does exactly that.</p><p>Phil smiles at him, but there&rsquo;s a modicum of panic, still, behind his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve let Buffy out quickly and poured her some food,&rdquo; he says, probably more to himself than anything, Dan thinks. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a spare toothbrush I&rsquo;m afraid, but maybe you could-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Dan says, trying to sound reassuring despite the anxiety monster still lurking behind him somewhere. &ldquo;I have some gum in my coat.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughs; the sound of it never fails to put Dan at ease. &ldquo;Nice. Okay, I&rsquo;ll go get Buffy back in, and then we should go. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nods. Phil lets out a relieved sigh, and heads out of the room.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan has just closed the passenger door of the car when Phil gasps, turning to Dan, alarmed.</p><p>&ldquo;The madeleines!&rdquo; He hops straight out again, running towards the house full pelt. Dan snorts with laughter, rolling his eyes. They&rsquo;re already ridiculously late, but God forbid the Year Nine&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t receive their baked goods.</p><p>He returns a minute later with two cake tins, one under each arm. As he slips into the driver&rsquo;s seat, he deposits them on Dan&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>&ldquo;No snacking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t had breakfast,&rdquo; Dan says, pouting.</p><p>Phil wavers, looking torn. &ldquo;Okay, you can have one, but you have to share it with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; Dan says, laughing, and delves into one of the tins.</p><p>He feeds Phil bits of the madeleine as they drive along. Mercifully, the school traffic doesn&rsquo;t seem particularly bad this morning, and they get there in under ten minutes.</p><p>&ldquo;Eight fifty-one,&rdquo; Dan says, huffing an impressed laugh. &ldquo;Christ, I can&rsquo;t believe we made it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was stressful,&rdquo; Phil says, glancing at his reflection in the rearview mirror. He tuts at whatever he sees, playing with his side fringe and frowning.</p><p>Dan takes hold of his hand, stilling the movements. &ldquo;You look irritatingly gorgeous, Phil. Just like every morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil squeezes Dan&rsquo;s hand, smiling warmly. He holds Dan&rsquo;s gaze, thumb stroking softly across his knuckle.</p><p>A rap on Dan&rsquo;s window startles them both. Phil drops Dan&rsquo;s hand like it&rsquo;s burning, but it&rsquo;s too late. The expression on John&rsquo;s face as he stares through the glass is not a happy one.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Phil hisses under his breath, echoing Dan&rsquo;s sentiments exactly.</p><p>He rolls down the window, making Dan&rsquo;s heart race wildly. Could they not just drive away? Speed off into the horizon with their hands linked again, like a male version of Thelma and Louise?</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Howell, Mr Lester,&rdquo; John greets them coldly. &ldquo;Would you mind getting out of the car, please?&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Given the time restrictions, John tells them both to report to his office at break time. From his tone of voice, Dan highly doubts it&rsquo;s for a chat over tea and biscuits.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a decidedly morose atmosphere as Phil hands out the madeleines to the students of their first class. The students seem to pick up on the air of dread that hangs above their teachers&rsquo; heads, and murmur to each other quietly, devoid of their usual enthusiasm for Phil&rsquo;s class. So as not to exacerbate an already bad situation, Dan tries his best not to be too obvious about his and Phil&rsquo;s dalliance in front of the kids.</p><p>He tries, but they&rsquo;re not stupid.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you pop round to Mr Lester&rsquo;s house just to borrow his shirt this morning, sir?&rdquo; Matthew asks as Dan is helping him shade a portion of the Arc du Triomphe (they&rsquo;re continuing with the mural). &ldquo;Or did he bring it in specially, &lsquo;cause he thought it&rsquo;d match your eyes?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes, about to deflect this question with something irrelevant, when a voice interrupts him.</p><p>&ldquo;Cram it, Matt. People have the same shirts as other people. Shocker.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan lifts his eyes to meet Jonah&rsquo;s as discreetly as he can, sending him a small smile of gratitude. Jonah winks subtly as Matthew rolls his eyes.</p><p>Around half an hour into the lesson, Dan wanders over to Phil, mostly because he cannot help himself. &ldquo;How&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trying not to think about it,&rdquo; Phil mutters under his breath. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shitting myself,&rdquo; Dan sighs, the butterflies in his stomach reforming in their chrysalises. &ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s a chance we can convince him we were just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Holding hands in prayer?&rdquo; Phil asks, bitterly. &ldquo;Platonically arriving together, late, with you in my clothes? Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll buy that.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan blinks, a little taken aback by Phil&rsquo;s unusual sarcasm. &ldquo;I guess when you put it that way&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Phil seems to catch on to the glimmer of hurt in Dan&rsquo;s voice, because he sighs, linking their little fingers together, out of sight of the kids. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he whispers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just worried. I didn&rsquo;t mean to take it out on you. I get kind of&hellip; moody when I&rsquo;m stressed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly it&rsquo;s pretty hot,&rdquo; Dan confesses, squeezing Phil&rsquo;s finger. It makes Phil smile a little, but it&rsquo;s short lived. &ldquo;It might not be as terrible as we think, with John.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this has happened already,&rdquo; Phil says, seeming to ignore Dan&rsquo;s attempt at reassurance. He looks skyward, shaking his head. &ldquo;I thought we could at least have a day or two of hiding it so I could figure something out&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan swallows, nodding. So there never was a plan, then. Phil had just been saying that to calm him down. It should probably make him annoyed, but it just seems incredibly sweet. Dan sends him a glance that he hopes speaks to this effect, and they both sigh, releasing their fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;The kids seem to like the madeleines,&rdquo; Dan offers, casting a gaze around the classroom.</p><p>Though the students seem a little more subdued than normal, they are undoubtedly enjoying the pleasant atmosphere in here, nibbling on their freshly baked cakes while they colour their favourite scenes of Paris. They lounge about the floor in little groups, chatting quietly, models of behaviour.</p><p>Dan is glad they&rsquo;re so calm this morning. He&rsquo;s not sure he could handle any pep.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I had a great baking assistant,&rdquo; Phil says, making Dan smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, all I did was watch in silent admiration.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I seem to remember you did a little more than that.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan splutters, throwing him a dirty look. &ldquo;So not the time.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil just laughs. &ldquo;Just trying to lighten the mood.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>The door to the Vice Principal&rsquo;s office is dark green. Fitting, Dan thinks as he stares at the nameplate tacked onto the outside. He checks his phone for the time.</p><p>10:59am.</p><p>He&rsquo;d kind of hoped he&rsquo;d run into Phil outside, and that they&rsquo;d be able to exchange a quick, reassuring look, but he&rsquo;s nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he&rsquo;s been held up after his second class, and is running late. Whatever the reason, Dan knows it would only make things worse if he were late to this meeting, so he takes a deep breath, and knocks on the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in, Mr Howell,&rdquo; John&rsquo;s voice calls.</p><p>It confuses Dan for a moment. How does John know that it&rsquo;s him? He pushes open the door, his eyebrows lifting as he notes that Phil is already inside, sat on one of the two chairs in front of John&rsquo;s desk.</p><p>Both he and John turn to face him, and he closes the door behind himself with a small click, feeling like a zoo animal. How long has Phil been here?</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Dan says, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>He moves to the seat beside Phil, perching on it awkwardly, heart pounding. Phil catches his eye, giving him a small smile. Dan drinks it in gratefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr Howell.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s tone of voice is grim. &ldquo;Thank you for coming. Now that you&rsquo;re both here, I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan swallows, his fingernails digging into his clammy palms. He wishes he could reach across and grab ahold of Phil&rsquo;s hand, but obviously that would be a pretty bad idea. Instead, he imagines he&rsquo;s back at Phil&rsquo;s house, still, beneath the covers beside him, their limbs tangled, their bodies sinking into his soft mattress.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s come to the attention of myself and several other staff members that the two of you have violated the terms of your employment,&rdquo; John says, his fingers lacing together on his desk. &ldquo;Whilst I hesitate to think of the two of you as being unprofessional, it has come to light that-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;John, can we cut the work jargon and talk properly?&rdquo; Phil interrupts, his voice so grave that Dan barely recognises it. He blinks at Phil in surprise, mildly concerned about how John might respond. &ldquo;We all know why we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>John leans back in his chair, sighing loudly. He holds Phil&rsquo;s gaze for a while, and then nods.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he says eventually. &ldquo;Phil, Daniel, I&rsquo;m not going to sugar coat this. There&rsquo;s substantial evidence that the two of you are romantically involved, and as you are both aware, employee relationships are prohibited in this institution.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Dan didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Phil argues. &ldquo;He was rushed through the training programme, he&rsquo;s still new here. He couldn&rsquo;t have known such a specific rule unless he was told-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That may have been initially true,&rdquo; John says, his voice a little louder now. &ldquo;But as you assured me, Phil, you informed him of the rule after I spoke with you on Tuesday. Yet the two of you have chosen to ignore this, and continue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Says who?&rdquo; Dan jumps in, realising a second too late that this perhaps isn&rsquo;t particularly wise.</p><p>He had no idea of the evidence amounted against them. Jonah could have said anything; Dan doesn&rsquo;t know for sure. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, there&rsquo;s no point-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, aside from the majority of the student body passing around gossip of what occurred during the Paris trip,&rdquo; John begins, silencing Phil before he can get the words out. &ldquo;There is the fact that the two of you arrived together this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a crime!&rdquo; Dan points out.</p><p>&ldquo;Holding hands in the school parking lot, dressed in each other&rsquo;s clothes&hellip; Dan, that in itself is enough to prompt speculation amongst the students, which is precisely the reason for the rule in the first place.&rdquo; John, to his credit, sounds apologetic about his own words. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford this kind of distraction to their learning, particularly when it comes to your class, Mr Lester. You achieve the best history results in the entire school, to have those grades reduce due to your inability to focus on anything but your TA would be catastrophic for the school&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll quit,&rdquo; Phil says calmly.</p><p>Dan whips his head round to Phil in lightning speed. &ldquo;What? Phil, don&rsquo;t be crazy-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, please,&rdquo; Phil says, his voice low and quiet. He meets Dan&rsquo;s gaze, eyes shining with such certainty that Dan slumps in his seat, already feeling defeated. Phil turns back to John, arms folded. &ldquo;John, this rule is antiquated and ridiculous, as you are well aware. I checked my contract, and the rule was implemented in 1957. It&rsquo;s absurd to think that the same conditions apply now, especially in a case like this, where Dan and I only work together twice a week, for an hour at a time.&rdquo;</p><p>John, looking a little flustered by Phil&rsquo;s threat of quitting, wipes a hand across his brow.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t disagree with you, Phil,&rdquo; he confesses. &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s not my decision. I can&rsquo;t bend the rules just because we&rsquo;re friends, and I certainly can&rsquo;t look the other way - not when the students are discussing it all day like it&rsquo;s a damned television romance-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; Phil presses, ignoring John entirely. Dan feels his chest swell with something like pride, watching Phil remain perfectly composed, laying out his argument clearly. &ldquo;Dan has been my assistant since the beginning of term. Whilst our&hellip; mutual feelings have only just been acknowledged,&rdquo; Phil glances at Dan, smiling very slightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe to say that he&rsquo;s been &lsquo;distracting&rsquo; me for the whole of that time. Yet if you&rsquo;ll check my Year Nine and Year Eight class results, you&rsquo;ll notice that they&rsquo;re better than ever before. Because Dan is an asset, not a hindrance. He is an excellent TA, probably the best I&rsquo;ve ever had, helped by the fact that we are so in sync. Our romantic relationship, if anything, makes us stronger as a teaching unit, and allows us to be the best team for the students.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We do work well together,&rdquo; Dan agrees quietly. &ldquo;The kids all say our lessons are the ones they look forward to, and learn from, the most.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That may be, but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;John, if you honestly think that Dan and I being together affects the students negatively, then I&rsquo;m afraid I will have no choice but to hand in my notice.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s announcement is like a bomb dropping. A hush falls over the office; even Dan&rsquo;s hands tighten on the arms of his chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not prepared to work in such discriminative conditions after I have proven myself to be an excellent teacher here. My relationship to Dan has not affected my performance. I am not prepared to allow my career to interrupt&hellip;&rdquo; he trails off, eyes fixing themselves on Dan&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s another silence, and then John sighs. &ldquo;Phil, I need you to be completely clear about this. If you are really willing to stake your job on a budding relationship, I advise you to think carefully-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil, please, it&rsquo;s okay, we should talk about-&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shakes his head, cutting Dan off. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to talk about.&rdquo;</p><p>John looks at him for a long moment, seeming to deliberate. &ldquo;Alright. Well, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re aware that you&rsquo;re an extremely valuable member of the faculty, Mr Lester. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the school would do a great deal to prevent your departure. Allow me to discuss your ultimatum with the Principal, and we&rsquo;ll see if we can come to a conclusion of sorts.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes widen. Could John be offering a glimmer of hope?</p><p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; Phil says, moving to stand from his chair. &ldquo;Dan and I will wait for your decision.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; John says, nodding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m promising absolutely nothing, boys. Rules are rules, and you have broken one. I&rsquo;ll be in touch. In the meantime&hellip; try and behave professionally, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, John,&rdquo; Phil says dismissively, standing from his chair.</p><p>Dan follows him, legs shaky, and nods at John, who is already dialling his phone. Phil makes a point of holding the door open for him, something that doesn&rsquo;t escape John&rsquo;s notice. Dan walks out quietly, and tries to comprehend what on earth just happened. </p><p>*</p><p>As soon as they step out of John&rsquo;s office, they&rsquo;re ambushed.</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t get a chance to speak to Phil about what he&rsquo;d said inside, as before he can get the words out, Jonah Frank is in front of them, flanked by Bethany and Savannah, their faces anxious.</p><p>&ldquo;Why were you in VP Green&rsquo;s office, sirs?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Jonah,&rdquo; Dan says, glancing at Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure this is the time&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were just having a meeting, guys,&rdquo; Phil tells them vaguely. &ldquo;Nothing to worry about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about you guys hookin&rsquo; up, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Jonah asks, making Dan roll his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Jonah,&rdquo; he says under his breath.</p><p>He supposes it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the whole corridor hears now, however. The students apparently discuss the idea of he and Phil as a couple freely, despite their efforts to hide things.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool, Mr Howell,&rdquo; Savannah says. &ldquo;Beth and I won&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Guys&hellip; we can&rsquo;t discuss things with you, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Phil cuts in, perpetually the voice of reason. He always knows what to say. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you know what happens if it gets to that point.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, so it&rsquo;s true, then?&rdquo; Jonah&rsquo;s face is alarmed. &ldquo;You guys could be canned?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan and Phil exchange a glance. Phil seems to deliberate on his wording. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a&hellip; possibility of suspension, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit&hellip;&rdquo; Jonah says; the girls cover their mouths with their hands. &ldquo;This is all my fault. I should&rsquo;a just kept my mouth shut. I didn&rsquo;t think VP Green&rsquo;d actually sack you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither did we,&rdquo; Dan mutters.</p><p>&ldquo;Jonah, don&rsquo;t blame yourself for anything that might happen,&rdquo; Phil tells him firmly. &ldquo;Nothing is certain anyway, but even if it ended up that Mr Howell or I lost our jobs, it would be the result of our own actions, not yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&rsquo;s sake, I hate this place,&rdquo; Jonah spits, glaring at VP Green&rsquo;s closed door. &ldquo;The only good thing about it is you an&rsquo; your class, Mr Lester. And now that might be gone, too.&rdquo;</p><p>The bell rings then, and Dan sighs, resolving to discuss the meeting with Phil later. He gives Phil a grim smile, waggling his fingers at him, and takes a deep breath, about to start off towards the Science Block. Before he can take a step however, Jonah speaks again.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi, sirs, I&rsquo;m gonna fix it, yeah?&rdquo; He says, looking fearsome. &ldquo;Leave it to me, I got you into trouble I know - but I&rsquo;m good at gettin&rsquo; out of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan smiles fondly, finding his surety very touching. &ldquo;Sweet of you to try, Jonah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes you just have to let things unfold, Jonah,&rdquo; Phil tells him wisely, then waves goodbye, walking briskly off towards his own classroom.</p><p>*</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t get a chance to speak to Phil about what happened until lunch. He finds Phil in the staffroom making coffee, dark circles under his eyes. When he sees Dan approach, he offers him the cup he&rsquo;s just made straight away, and turns back to the pot to pour another.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s opening line dies on his lips, touched by the small gesture. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; He asks instead. </p><p>Phil offers him a weak smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been better, honestly.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shuts his eyes, sighing into his coffee. &ldquo;Phil&hellip; why did you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way to get them to listen,&rdquo; Phil says before Dan can get the words out. &ldquo;The rule is stupid and pointless. Even if I have to walk over this, the system is oppressive and needs to change. This could force their hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a risk, Phil. I should be the one to leave, not you.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil peers over his freshly made cup, a smirk on his lips. &ldquo;No offence, Dan, but I don&rsquo;t think you walking out would quite carry the same weight. You&rsquo;ve been here a couple of months. I&rsquo;ve been here for two years.&rdquo;</p><p>In his heart, Dan knows that what Phil is saying makes sense. Even so, the idea of Phil quitting his job, which he loves, deeply, just for him - it&rsquo;s too much. Too big of a sacrifice. Dan isn&rsquo;t worth that kind of gesture. </p><p>&ldquo;This is so unfair,&rdquo; Dan says.</p><p>He can feel himself getting choked up out of frustration, tears stinging in his eyes. He knows it&rsquo;s just because he&rsquo;s overtired and stressed, but it&rsquo;s still embarrassing, having Phil see. Luckily for him, Phil is the most wonderful creation in the universe, so he puts down his coffee and ushers Dan into the staff bathroom.</p><p>Safely sealed inside the private space, Phil pulls Dan into his arms, wrapping him up tightly. He kisses Dan&rsquo;s forehead, rocking gently as Dan struggles to hold himself together.</p><p>&ldquo;Ne t'inqui&egrave;te pas,&rdquo; he whispers. &ldquo;Je te tiens.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>They don&rsquo;t hear from John for the rest of the day. Dan wanders into Phil&rsquo;s classroom just after the last bell, sitting down on one of the student&rsquo;s desks with a sigh. Phil watches him while he tidies some things away on his desk, smiling sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna come over for a while?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan thinks about it for a moment, then nods. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t brushed my teeth since Sunday morning. Just so you&rsquo;re aware before you get too hospitable.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil chuckles, wandering over to him. &ldquo;We can pick you up a toothbrush on the way.&rdquo;</p><p>They both glance over at the classroom door, checking it&rsquo;s closed before they touch. Dan winds his arms around Phil&rsquo;s waist, resting his head on Phil&rsquo;s chest. </p><p>&ldquo;For me to keep at your house?&rdquo; Dan asks into Phil&rsquo;s breastbone. &ldquo;Next thing you know I&rsquo;ll have a whole drawer there, Phil. Steady on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d happily give you a whole chest of drawers, to be honest.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan lifts his head, staring at Phil with a frown. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been like a week since you kissed me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Non,&rdquo; Phil tells him, leaning in to kiss him very gently. &ldquo;Je te connais depuis toujours.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br />um&hellip; are u dead</p><p><b>Dan</b><br />only internally</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br />are u ever coming home or</p><p><b>Dan</b><br />no u guys pissed me off too much<br />and im moving out baiii</p><p><b>Tyler<br /></b>ah, k. how is it in ur new home? dark?<br />cramped?</p><p><b>Dan</b><br />???</p><p><b>Tyler</b><br />well i assume you&rsquo;ve now moved<br />permanently into phil&rsquo;s ass</p><p><b>Dan</b><br />TYLER HE FUCKING READ THAT<br />I HATE U</p><p><b>Tyler<br /></b>miss u and ur screaming :( come home<br />soon we have much to gossip about x</p><p><b>Dan</b><br />i&rsquo;ll be home tonight or tomorrow xx</p><p>*</p><p>They&rsquo;re on Phil&rsquo;s sofa, Dan&rsquo;s head in Phil&rsquo;s lap, Buffy snoozing on Dan&rsquo;s chest, when a random thought occurs to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stares up at him, the sharp cut of his jawline, stubbled and pretty, catching his eye.</p><p>&ldquo;You said you have a tattoo.&rdquo;</p><p>The corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth twitches, almost imperceptibly. &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;</p><p>Thor is playing in the background on Phil&rsquo;s TV, but neither of them have been paying close attention. They&rsquo;ve both seen it before, and besides, Dan&rsquo;s far more interested in tracing the contours of Phil&rsquo;s pretty face with his eyes from below. Not to mention, Phil&rsquo;s hand has been in his hair for some time now, massaging gently. It&rsquo;s still curly from yesterday, as the kids had been all too gleeful to point out for the entire day.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yes.&rdquo; Dan tries to sit up a little, but Buffy is having none of it. He rolls his eyes at her indignant expression, sinking back onto Phil&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;On the boat, when we were playing that game with the kids.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh, strange,&rdquo; Phil says, that hint of a smile still playing on his lips.</p><p>Dan just stares at him. &ldquo;So&hellip; do you, or don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a silence. Phil picks up his tea and takes a long drink of it, then places it carefully back on the arm of the sofa. His eyes drag slowly down to Dan&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll have to find out.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy squeals in indignation as she is pushed off Dan&rsquo;s chest, but he has no time to apologise to her. He climbs up onto Phil&rsquo;s lap in seconds, hands at the collar of his shirt immediately. Phil laughs at his eagerness, welcoming the kisses Dan plants on his lips.</p><p>It takes only a few seconds to get Phil&rsquo;s shirt open, but it feels like centuries go by. Dan tugs at it impatiently, yanking it over his shoulders and trying to shove it down his arms. Phil is laughing still, apparently finding Dan&rsquo;s efforts extremely amusing, but going along with it anyway.</p><p>It&rsquo;s his own fault, anyway, Dan thinks. He can&rsquo;t just dangle the prospect of a hidden tattoo in front of him without expecting to be ravished. He gasps as Phil&rsquo;s hands find his bum, moving Dan in closer with a strong, sharp pull. Dan wiggles in his lap, drawing away from Phil&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Hands off, I need to get you naked,&rdquo; Dan complains, frustrated. Phil is surprisingly strong.</p><p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get naked after,&rdquo; Dan explains impatiently, making Phil laugh.</p><p>It seems to do the trick though, as he releases his hold on Dan&rsquo;s bum, and allows the shirt to slip completely off his body. Dan sits back, surveying the exposed flesh. It&rsquo;s safe to say that Phil&rsquo;s chest and stomach are decidedly unblemished, and devoid of anything but miles of gorgeous, pale skin. Dan runs his fingers over it anyway, lifting each of Phil&rsquo;s arms and peering at them, dragging his lips down their lengths, shoulder to each fingertip.</p><p>When he&rsquo;s satisfied that neither arm is inked, he leans back again, catching sight of Phil&rsquo;s amused smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I might have to be extremely thorough,&rdquo; Dan warns him, entirely serious. &ldquo;I plan to leave no place unsearched.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Detective Howell,&rdquo; Phil says, nodding sombrely. &ldquo;I completely understand.&rdquo;</p><p>Without another word, Dan slips off Phil&rsquo;s lap and onto the floor, landing between his legs. He kneels up, reaching at once for Phil&rsquo;s belt and fly, wanting to waste no time. He&rsquo;s always had a weakness for tattoos. He&rsquo;s too scared to actually get one himself, too anxious of a person to trust his decision for such a permanent thing, but on other people - it&rsquo;s incredibly attractive.</p><p>If Phil really does possess a tattoo, Dan thinks as he slides Phil&rsquo;s jeans down his legs, it means there are all sorts of things about him that Dan doesn&rsquo;t know, potentially. The thought excites him. Will the tattoo be something tribal, to represent an aspect of Phil&rsquo;s personality? Will it be a memory, shared with someone Dan doesn&rsquo;t know? Will it be just a pattern Phil liked? Or a caricature of Justin Bieber on one of his buttcheeks?</p><p>Dan thinks he might&rsquo;ve noticed that last one before now, but he doesn&rsquo;t know for sure. He hadn&rsquo;t really been paying close attention to Phil&rsquo;s nether regions when they&rsquo;d been on display yesterday; Phil&rsquo;s actions had been&hellip; rather distracting, as he recalls.</p><p>Once Phil&rsquo;s jeans are off, Dan gets to work, taking Phil&rsquo;s leg and extending it out before inspecting it closely, pressing little kisses as he goes. He checks from ankle to thigh, even peering at the space behind Phil&rsquo;s knee.</p><p>He takes Phil&rsquo;s feet in his hand one at a time, peeling off the socks to check every toe.</p><p>&ldquo;Knew you had a foot fetish,&rdquo; Phil says, watching him with a grin.</p><p>Just to mess with him, Dan licks a stripe up the underside of his left foot, making him shriek. &ldquo;For these babies, I might.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughs, and Dan moves back to his former position, knelt between his legs on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Give up?&rdquo; Phil asks, a teasing lilt to his voice.</p><p>Dan snorts. &ldquo;As if. I&rsquo;m just getting started, mate.&rdquo;</p><p>He trails his hands up Phil&rsquo;s thighs then, already drunk on the little gasping noise that slips from Phil&rsquo;s mouth. He hooks his fingers into the elastic of Phil&rsquo;s boxers, pulling them carefully down as Phil lifts his bum from the sofa.</p><p>As ever, the sight of him, naked and aroused, is enough to knock the air out of Dan&rsquo;s lungs. He can&rsquo;t help the tiny groan that falls from his lips, just as he can&rsquo;t stop himself leaning in and taking hold of Phil&rsquo;s length in one hand, and slipping his mouth over the tip.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo; he hears Phil say, making him shiver.</p><p>Phil is smooth and slick as Dan allows the length of him to slide into his mouth. He can feel his mouth being stretched wide, can feel the tip nudging the back of his throat. Dan swallows, moaning a little, his eyes fluttering as the taste of Phil filters through. He lets himself sink down, relishing the sensation Phil pushing so far inside.</p><p>He reaches down to palm himself through his jeans, just to relieve some of the pressure building up there. He starts to bob his head, letting Phil&rsquo;s breathy noises guide him into what&rsquo;s good and what isn&rsquo;t. He works his hand too, allowing his lips to meet the circle of his fist.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, baby, that&rsquo;s so&hellip; oh, fuck&hellip;.&rdquo; Phil is saying, babbling really.</p><p>After a while, Dan forces himself to pull off; Phil lets out an agonised cry. Dan wipes the corner of his mouth, smirking. &ldquo;Hang on. I&rsquo;m still looking for something.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s responding groan is anguished, but Dan doesn&rsquo;t allow it to deter him. Instead, he grabs Phil&rsquo;s hands and pulls him down to his level, into his lap, so that Phil&rsquo;s legs straddle him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a tease,&rdquo; Phil tells him, practically pouting.</p><p>Dan just grins. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s payback for all the totally outside-the-rules flirting during school hours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? When?!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Um, try every fucking day.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever, I hate you. Please just hurry up and find it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyebrows raise at this instruction, catching the implication that there is, at least, something to find. &ldquo;Turn around.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a glimmer of something wicked in Phil&rsquo;s eyes, but he does so, carefully twisting around on Dan&rsquo;s lap. He leans forwards, arms braced against the sofa cushion in front of them both, sat on Dan&rsquo;s knees still, now with his back on show.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes rake down the canvas of Phil&rsquo;s skin; immediately he understands why he hadn&rsquo;t noticed the tattoo until now. It&rsquo;s low down, on Phil&rsquo;s left side, wrapped around the back of his hip.</p><p>Dan stares at it for a long time before reaching out to trace it, lightly, using just the tips of his fingers. He didn&rsquo;t realise tattoos this pretty existed. It&rsquo;s like a piece of art.</p><p>&ldquo;Paris,&rdquo; Dan observes, his finger edging along the skyline, drawn so neatly, so simply, into Phil&rsquo;s skin.</p><p>The thin line is unbroken, as if it&rsquo;s all connected, the outline of the Eiffel Tower joined to the Sacre Coeur, and the Moulin Rouge. It&rsquo;s minimalistic, to say the least, just one long, very thin black line, outlining the city.</p><p>It&rsquo;s incredibly beautiful. It seems to fit on Phil&rsquo;s body, resting delicately on his hip, as if he&rsquo;d been born with it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know,&rdquo; Phil sighs, the line of his shoulders shifting. &ldquo;Clich&eacute;.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan leans his cheek against the space between Phil&rsquo;s shoulder blades, staring down at it across the desert of Phil&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Phil, it&rsquo;s beautiful. You&rsquo;re beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looks over his shoulder, and Dan leans up to kiss him. He wraps his arms around Phil&rsquo;s waist, dragging him backwards until they&rsquo;re back to chest. He can feel Phil&rsquo;s irregular breathing, and he treasures the sound, mentally saving it on a loop for when he&rsquo;s alone, and needs to remember how wrecked he can, somehow, make this man, scintillating as he is.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hands glide down Phil&rsquo;s chest and stomach, his chin tucked over one shoulder, pressing kisses at the base of his neck. He takes hold of Phil&rsquo;s erection, still full and proud, damp now from the anticipation, and starts stroking him gently.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s head falls backwards, the base of his skull brushing Dan&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Dan&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tes mains se sentent incroyables,&rdquo; Phil croaks out.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hand stops moving. &ldquo;What are you saying? It&rsquo;s not fair, I can&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil turns his head to look Dan in the eye, clearly surprised. &ldquo;Nothing, I&rsquo;m just&hellip; saying you feel good.&rdquo;</p><p>The answer frustrates him in its ambiguity. &ldquo;Will you translate for me, at least?&rdquo;</p><p>The crinkles around Phil&rsquo;s eyes deepen, and he smirks.. &ldquo;I said&hellip; your hands feel incredible.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan flushes immediately, caught off guard. &ldquo;O-oh.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil surges up and kisses him then, slow and teasing, licking against Dans lower lip. &ldquo;S&rsquo;il te plait&hellip; ne tu arrete pas.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan feels the goosebumps rip over his skin. &ldquo;What did you say then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said please don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; Phil says, and Dan bites his lip. As requested, he starts moving his hand again, and Phil&rsquo;s head flops backwards, eyes closing.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil&hellip;.&rdquo; Dan whispers, suddenly indescribably turned on, staring down over Phil&rsquo;s shoulder at the expanse of his naked body. &ldquo;Will you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He hesitates, and Phil opens one eye, a sliver of ice blue visible around the black hole of his pupil. &ldquo;Will I&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>Swallowing his embarrassment, Dan moves his mouth until his lips are brushing the shell of Phil&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Baise-moi,&rdquo; he whispers.</p><p>Phil grabs hold of Dan&rsquo;s wrist, stilling the movement around his erection. &ldquo;Mon dieu, Daniel. Where did you learn&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan laughs a little, unwrapping his fingers from Phil&rsquo;s length, sensing he might be rather close to the edge as it is. If Dan&rsquo;s going to get what he wants, he needs to move quickly. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been&hellip; looking up some words and phrases. Just in case.&rdquo;</p><p>He hears Phil take a deep breath, and then he stands, chucking a mischievous glance over his shoulder at Dan as he sashays across the room towards his bedroom. Dan stares for a moment, mesmerised by the sight of his naked backside, the newly revealed tattoo resting above it, before he scrambles to his feet and runs after him.</p><p>Excited by Dan&rsquo;s brisk movements, Buffy trots along behind him, her tongue out, happily ignorant of the sin in front of her twitching nose. Dan reaches down to pat her, gently pointing her in the other direction. </p><p>He slips into Phil&rsquo;s room and quickly shuts the door on her, feeling bad, but knowing that it was necessary. </p><p>By the time Dan turns around, Phil is reclined on his bed, squeezing something clear and gel-like into his palm from a small purple bottle. Wanting to waste no time, Dan peels off the shirt Phil lent him, and unfastens his jeans, shimmying them off as he dives onto the bed.</p><p>Phil laughs at his eagerness, rolling them over so he&rsquo;s on top of Dan, eyes hooded. &ldquo;Tu sembles impatient, ce soir.&rdquo;</p><p>Heart fluttering, Dan swats him gently in the shoulder. &ldquo;English.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; Phil growls, his fingers already sliding Dan&rsquo;s briefs down his thighs. &ldquo;You seem impatient, this evening.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan feels the flush as it ripples down his throat. He shouldn&rsquo;t have asked. &ldquo;C-can you blame me?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nips at the base of his neck, where there are already a bouquet of bruises, barely coverable by the shirts he wears to school. &ldquo;I quite like it, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Dan can respond, Phil&rsquo;s hand is wrapping around his erection, slippery and warm, his fingers curling tightly as he slicks them up and down.</p><p>&ldquo;Ohh,&rdquo; Dan moans, his hips bucking into Phil&rsquo;s fist. &ldquo;Holy fucking shit, Phil. Excuse my French.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil snorts with laughter.</p><p>All of a sudden, any ability to be funny slips away as Dan feels the fingers of Phil&rsquo;s other hand slipping between his cheeks, pressing firmly against his hole. He sucks in a breath, his body twitching in surprise. Phil just continues stroking up and down his length with one hand, his other fingers circling Dan&rsquo;s rim.</p><p>The over-stimulation might actually be enough to make him black out, Dan thinks vaguely.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Dan curses again, his hands winding into Phil&rsquo;s covers, pulling them free of the corners. &ldquo;Oh God,&rdquo; he groans. &ldquo;Please fuck me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil chuckles again, but he sounds a little strung out, if Dan isn&rsquo;t mistaken. &ldquo;Tu es trop pleurniches.&rdquo; He sighs, pushing his finger inside, making Dan groan. &ldquo;Et trop joli.&rdquo; Dan hits him in the shoulder again, making Phil laugh. &ldquo;I said you&rsquo;re so whiny.&rdquo;</p><p>Something seems off about Phil&rsquo;s translation, but it&rsquo;s hard to concentrate on that when Phil&rsquo;s finger is pressing so deeply into him, making him squirm. He continues pumping his hand over Dan&rsquo;s length too, which is dizzyingly hot, so Dan just writhes and whimpers, clinging to the bedsheets for dear life.</p><p>Phil is quick about opening him up, this time, for which Dan is grateful. There&rsquo;s still a slight burn, as he&rsquo;s far from used to this yet, but he would gladly endure ten times the pain for the experience of having Phil inside of him like before. Once he&rsquo;s three fingers deep, Phil crooks his fingers, deftly, seeming to know exactly how and where, and Dan chokes off a low, rumbling moan of ecstasy.</p><p>&ldquo;Ici, mon ange?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unnngh, Phil talk in English, please,&rdquo; Dan begs, his face turning to burrow into the mattress.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Phil mutters, seeming to pause before translating this time. &ldquo;Here, Dan?&rdquo; He pushes against Dan&rsquo;s prostate again, making him yelp.</p><p>Yet again, Dan&rsquo;s not sure that Phil actually said that, but he doesn&rsquo;t have it in him to argue. So he just nods, biting down on his lip, possibly a little too hard.</p><p>Phil draws his hands free of Dan, eliciting a groan of anguish from him. Dan sits up, bewildered and affronted by this action. Phil just giggles at his expression, and picks up the bottle of lube from wherever he dropped it last. He holds it up to Dan in explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm, I hope I have some condoms in here,&rdquo; Phil mutters, reaching across to dig into his bedside drawer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave it,&rdquo; Dan says, impatient. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even done this with anyone but you. Are you clean?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil turns to him in surprise. He nods, pressing his lips together. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he says quietly. &ldquo;But maybe- just to be sure-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe you Phil, Christ,&rdquo; Dan argues, kicking him in the leg. &ldquo;Get over here.&rdquo;</p><p>To Dan&rsquo;s sheer relief, Phil does as asked, crawling towards him. He kneels by Dan&rsquo;s legs, squeezing another dollop of lube onto his outstretched palm. As he rubs his fingers together, he drags his eyes over Dan&rsquo;s body; absurdly, it makes Dan blush.</p><p>&ldquo;Turn over,&rdquo; Phil instructs, sending a lance of hot, debilitating arousal through Dan&rsquo;s body.</p><p>His breaths become a little more difficult to catch, for some reason, and fall from his mouth in short, stuttery gasps as he rolls onto his stomach, desperate to obey Phil&rsquo;s command. He hears a slick sound, and imagines the sight of Phil&rsquo;s fist pumping over himself, covering his flushed erection with the lubricant. He feels Phil&rsquo;s hands on his hips, canting them upwards, so that Dan&rsquo;s face presses into the mattress.</p><p>His lungs tighten, face on fire as he thinks about how exposed he is. &ldquo;Ph-phil, I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; Phil says; Dan feels him dragging the tip of his length over his rim, and his hips twitch in Phil&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so good, Dan. So gorgeous. There&rsquo;s no word for how you look in French. Gorgeous.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan directs his ragged breathing into the covers of Phil&rsquo;s bed. He feels the familiar burn of being stretched open as Phil pushes in, going slow again, one thumb stroking gently over his hipbone.</p><p>Nobody has ever called him anything other than &lsquo;hot&rsquo; before. Stephanie used to call him cute sometimes, or tell him he looked sexy in a certain shirt, but &lsquo;gorgeous&rsquo;? That&rsquo;s a word he would never have associated with his appearance. It&rsquo;s a loaded word, heavier than beautiful, more charged with attraction, with want.</p><p>His cheeks burn. &lsquo;Gorgeous&rsquo; is how Phil sees him, even like this.</p><p>He pushes his hips backwards, feeling Phil slip further inside. He can tell the movement takes Phil by surprise, because Phil&rsquo;s hands tighten on his hips, as if trying to slow him down. But Dan doesn&rsquo;t want to slow down. He wants Phil to wreck him, to split him apart with his face crushed into the green-blue of his bedspread.</p><p>He lifts his head, intending to tell Phil exactly this. &ldquo;You can be rougher, if you want,&rdquo; he says, voice scratchy and weak. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t break.&rdquo;</p><p>A tiny moan spills from Phil&rsquo;s throat. It makes Dan smile, proud. &ldquo;Tell me if I hurt you, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it bad if I don&rsquo;t really mind?&rdquo;</p><p>The only answer Dan receives is a mildly strangled sound, followed by Phil thrusting his hips forwards so abruptly that Dan cries out. Immediately, Phil stills behind him, leaning forwards in alarm.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, did I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do that again,&rdquo; Dan urges, reaching back blindly in order to grab one of Phil&rsquo;s thighs.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a moment of hesitation, and then Phil is drawing back, sliding out of Dan before thrusting back in, slick and fast, the top of his thighs hitting Dan&rsquo;s buttocks with a slap. Then, he does it a third time. Dan&rsquo;s mouth falls open, pressing back into the sensation, rocking back into Phil&rsquo;s movements.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit&hellip;&rdquo; Phil says, setting up a rhythm now. &ldquo;I warn you, Dan, I&rsquo;m pretty close&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me- me too,&rdquo; Dan manages to stutter around the rough, lustful moans that refuse to stop bubbling out of his chest. &ldquo;Fucking&hellip; Christ, Phil, fuck me, yeah&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Je pourrais te baiser pour toujours, Dan,&rdquo; Phil garbles, obviously on the edge. His movements are erratic now, sloppier, with less control. &ldquo;Tu es parfait, tu es parfait-&rdquo;</p><p>His own shout of ecstasy cuts him off, and Dan feels the warmth, the spasm, as Phil comes into him, pushing himself deeply as he spreads his chest against Dan&rsquo;s back. He bites Dan&rsquo;s shoulder, hips twitching; it&rsquo;s hands down the hottest thing Dan has ever experienced. He thrusts himself against the mattress, desperate for friction.</p><p>Suddenly, Phil is easing out of him, and Dan is being flipped over. Phil&rsquo;s tongue drags itself over his chest, down his stomach, and then a mouth is slipping over his straining erection, engulfing him entirely. It takes approximately three seconds before Dan is toppling into his climax, the force of it pushing an agonised scream from his throat. He&rsquo;s sure he momentarily glimpses infinity, sizzling around him in the form of a neon, pulsating nebula.</p><p>When he crashes back down to earth, Phil is draped over him, his nose just below Dan&rsquo;s ear, his arm slung across Dan&rsquo;s chest. Both of their chests are heaving - their exhaustion the only sound in the silent room.</p><p>After a moment, Dan can hear a faint scrabbling against the closed bedroom door. Poor Buffy, he thinks absently. She must be so jealous that Dan is stealing all of her father&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>Dan finds Phil&rsquo;s hand and winds their fingers together, both their palms damp with exertion.</p><p>&ldquo;As far as distractions from things we&rsquo;re trying not to think about go,&rdquo; Dan says to the ceiling. &ldquo;That was pretty good.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil lifts his head, looking affronted. &ldquo;&rsquo;Pretty good&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan laughs, breathless. &ldquo;In this instance, &lsquo;pretty good&rsquo; means the absolute best sex I&rsquo;ve ever had, ever.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smiles, satisfied, and rests his head back on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder, playing with his fingers. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good to know that even if we get sacked, we&rsquo;ll still be able to console ourselves with amazing sex, I guess,&rdquo; Dan jokes, but he can feel it falls flat against Phil&rsquo;s ears.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a silence.</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get fired, Dan,&rdquo; Phil says softly. He&rsquo;s tracing up each of Dan&rsquo;s fingers in turn.</p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;d stay working in a school that kicked out the only good teacher they&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Phil, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dan says firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only reason that job is bearable. I couldn&rsquo;t work there if I couldn&rsquo;t see you every day. There&rsquo;s no way I could be professional. I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to smile at John, or have a coffee with him in the staffroom, knowing full well that he stole you away from me, for something so&hellip;. completely unfair.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s fingers trickle up and down his arm. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make you do anything, or not do anything. But you should think carefully. I can get another job. It would be harder for you. You don&rsquo;t have as much experience working in schools. We&rsquo;d make it work, still, even if I do end up having to quit. We can see each other after work, all the time. It might not be so bad.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan wriggles in Phil&rsquo;s arms, turning so they&rsquo;re laying face to face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to work where you&rsquo;re not. That&rsquo;s so sad.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil reaches up to trace the curve of his face. &ldquo;I know, gorgeous.&rdquo; The tips of Dan&rsquo;s ears burn, still not used to hearing the endearment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either. Mais c&rsquo;est la vie.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Phil is laying on his front, and Dan is appreciating the view. They&rsquo;ve been on his bed for some time now, talking about nothing as the light pouring through Phil&rsquo;s big windows fades into a softer, duller evening glow.</p><p>For what must be the hundredth time, Dan leans down to Phil&rsquo;s left hip, and presses his mouth to the tattoo he can&rsquo;t stop staring at. Just like every time, Phil&rsquo;s breath hitches, like he can&rsquo;t quite believe the sensation.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much prettier than I thought it would be,&rdquo; Dan confesses, making Phil giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you think it would be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A ninja turtle? A portrait of Buffy&rsquo;s face? I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Buffy as in my dog, or Sarah Michelle Gellar?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan considers this, laughing. &ldquo;Either. Both.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughs then as well, gazing at Dan over his shoulder. Dan&rsquo;s fingers trace the Paris skyline once again, his face dreamy. &ldquo;You really like it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>A light blush peppers Dan&rsquo;s cheekbones, and he shrugs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty.&rdquo; Phil looks curious, but says nothing. &ldquo;When did you get it?&rdquo;</p><p>All of a sudden, Phil&rsquo;s expression grows a little colder. He turns from Dan, averting his gaze. &ldquo;In Paris. When I lived there.&rdquo;</p><p>Confused by the sudden change in atmosphere, Dan feels his curiosity perking up. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says, trying to sound casual. &ldquo;On your own, or&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Phil sighs, and he glances at Dan, conflicted. After a moment, he seems to relent. &ldquo;No. Not alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nods, nonchalant. &ldquo;Was it&hellip; with that guy you mentioned? Your ex?&rdquo; The nod Phil gives him doesn&rsquo;t come as much of a surprise, but it still winds a thick coil of jealousy around Dan&rsquo;s chest, squeezing so tightly that he coughs. &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; </p><p>Seeing straight through his attempt at remaining calm and collected, Phil laughs, reaching for Dan&rsquo;s hand. Dan lets him take it, feeling foolish. He has no right to be jealous of something that happened before he even knew Phil, he knows. It&rsquo;s not like this guy, whoever he is, is still around.</p><p>Still, as Dan stares at the tattoo, he can&rsquo;t help wondering how serious this past relationship must have been, or at least felt, for Phil to do something so permanent about it.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking,&rdquo; Phil tells him, rolling onto his back, rendering the tattoo invisible again. He tugs Dan towards him, until they&rsquo;re laying next to each other, Dan nestled beneath Phil&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;It seems crazy, that I tattooed myself over something that fell apart. I swear I&rsquo;m not usually that reckless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice is small, and he detests it.</p><p>Phil sighs, the arm around Dan&rsquo;s shoulder tightening. &ldquo;I was young and stupid, basically. I thought I was in love.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hand places itself over Phil&rsquo;s heart; for some reason, he suddenly feels terrified. Love? Phil was, potentially, in love with another man? The thought shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, as Phil is older, and has had a whole life without him. Still, the idea is difficult to comprehend.</p><p>He tries to picture Phil directing his sunny smile at another person - another, faceless man. He imagines the hand in his wound into someone else&rsquo;s. He pictures Phil&rsquo;s lips against this mystery person&rsquo;s skin. His brain rejects the imaginings as they come, vehemently.</p><p>Who is this person that had such a hold on Phil, Dan wonders. </p><p>Is he French? </p><p>Did they speak to one another in a language Dan can&rsquo;t grasp?</p><p>Did they wander the streets of Paris together, making shared memories that Dan will never be a part of?</p><p>Did he love Phil back? </p><p>Does he think of Phil, still, today? Does he pine after him, wondering where he is, and if he should swim the channel, turn up on Phil&rsquo;s doorstep and whisk him away again?</p><p>&ldquo;Dan? Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>He nods, but even he can feel how insincere his answer is. Phil tilts his chin up with one finger, forcing Dan to meet his eye. He&rsquo;s smiling gently; Dan watches, going a little cross-eyed as Phil leans in to kiss his nose.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry, Dan.&rdquo; Something about the soft surety of Phil&rsquo;s voice puts Dan instantly at ease. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t very nice, in the end. It took me a while to realise it, I guess. I was so besotted. I was in Paris. I got swept up in the romanticism of being there, of the cute caf&eacute; dates, and holding his hand as we walked over padlocked bridges. I thought he was just as infatuated as I was. I didn&rsquo;t question it when I told him I wanted a tattoo, to commemorate my time there, with him, and he didn&rsquo;t want one too.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil stops speaking, looking into the space behind Dan, lost in thought. There&rsquo;s a sad, distant smile on his lips. Dan reaches up to stroke it with his fingers, making Phil refocus on his face.</p><p>He feels the smile stretch beneath the pad of his finger, watches the light flicker back into a warm glow behind Phil&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;It used to make me feel sad, whenever I caught a glimpse of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The tattoo?&rdquo; Dan asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Too many tainted memories attached.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t make you sad anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shakes his head, still smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because, Dan,&rdquo; Phil tells him, their noses brushing. &ldquo;I made new memories in Paris. Better ones. With you.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/170620415840/lhistoire-fran%C3%A7aise-new-chapter\"><b>(Chapter Fifteen!)&nbsp;</b></a></p>",

In the dream, he&rsquo;d been lying in a bed of squishy dough, warm and snug in a toasty oven.
