I&rsquo;m just one of those people who like to work and in the beginning of 2018, I began to feel a little rundown.</p><p>As the job pace picked up, I began to sort of feel less happy. That was the beginning of the sign and over the course of a year I sort of never regained my footing.</p><p>You begin to sacrifice your own things as your life becomes more complicated because you\u2019re also, besides working, taking care of your kids and family.</p><p><strong>How did you take control?</strong>: The first thing I did was really just decide to take a pause.</p><p>As a woman in an executive role, you\u2019re constantly asked about work-life balance and I find that to be a set up [because] there is no such thing as a work-life balance.</p><p>I always look at life as choices and chapters. You make different choices in different chapters and I reached a chapter where I wanted to make a different choice than being an executive, at least for a moment in time.</p><p>Someone gave me advice [for my pause] to find things that you want to do so you know you accomplished something. One of mine was going on a yoga retreat with my daughter. I signed up for a memoir-writing class and I decided to spend time with my grandmother in Venice Beach [California]. Those are three things that I would have accomplished.</p><p>The thing I struggle [now] with is making sure I leave room and space. Especially when you have a career that\u2019s been full, you get a million asks.</p><p>You have to exercise the power of saying no, which does not come naturally, or otherwise you end up filling your entire schedule with other types of things.</p><h3>Events planner who made a career change</h3><p><em>Shana Steele, 34, is general manager of The Wing, SOHO, a community space designed for women.

It was difficult to recognize that I know I\u2019m good at what I do and I\u2019m really comfortable in what I\u2019m doing, but it might be time to see if I can contribute something more.</p><p><strong>How did you take control?</strong>: An offer was presented to me and I said, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I\u2019m looking at this time now, and joining the company, as an adventure.</p><p>Right before I left D.C., I adopted a puppy because I wanted a buddy but also because he would give me a reason to go home every night and not stay at work all day. He might be the biggest change for me. He needs as much TLC as I do.</p><p>I\u2019ve also recognized that things do need to get done and some things do take priority, but I\u2019m not on the clock 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and I do need to carve out time for myself. There are times in the day when my phone is on silent and I\u2019m not answering emails.</p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/feeling-burnout-symptoms-60470622\" target=\"_blank\">(Feeling burnout?

I have some ideas but I&rsquo;m not really sure how to put those into place.</p><p>I think the schedules we create for ourselves are so relentless. I&rsquo;ve thought about [burnout] a lot this year and I think it&rsquo;s just something that, especially as a working mom, it&rsquo;s starting to feel unavoidable to me.</p><p>One thing that has helped for sure is when I&rsquo;m \"momming,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m &ldquo;momming.&rdquo; I respect people who can take the conference call while holding the baby, but I can&rsquo;t. When I&rsquo;m with her I&rsquo;m with her, and when I&rsquo;m working, I&rsquo;m working.</p><h3>College student who couldn&rsquo;t catch her breath</h3><p><em>Victoria Gillison is a 24-year-old program manager at a Phildalphia-area university. She felt the stress of burnout during her sophomore year of college.</em></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c3d3585f69802174ae97bc67998d5ae8/tumblr_inline_plsjj7KgfJ1tuwonz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><strong>How did burnout appear in your life?</strong>: There was a mental part of it, which was the feeling of never doing enough, but most of it was physical.</p><p>I felt tired and I couldn&rsquo;t get myself to do things that I knew I loved, like going to classes I liked and going to the gym. I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t breathe and couldn&rsquo;t catch my breath.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know exactly what it was and I didn&rsquo;t think I had the time to figure it out, so I just told myself to power through it.</p><p>I really remember that sophomore year trying to get myself to come back [to school] for spring semester. I sat in my car and cried for 15 minutes because I didn&rsquo;t want to go back. That&rsquo;s when I really realized something was off.</p><p><strong>How did you take control?</strong>: Burnout for me didn&rsquo;t fit in with the image that I had of myself and that was probably the biggest thing for me to overcome, that picture of the high-achieving person that I thought of myself in my mind.</p><p>That was one of the big first challenges, acknowledging that it was okay to feel exhausted because I was trying to do so much.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/ways-make-care-happen-year-59998458\" target=\"_blank\">(MORE: 5 ways to make self-care happen in the new year)</a></p><p>I met with a counselor [at my college]. What [the counselor] helped me do was to find ways to take care of myself that didn&rsquo;t really feed into the guilt I was feeling for taking time to do things for myself.</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t sit down and make a whole meal for myself, but if I scheduled a time to cook with my roommate, it was built into my schedule and I was being social. And if I had a workout buddy, it became an obligation that was helping me.</p><p>I also took breaks that had to be something no longer than two minutes, like stepping outside for fresh air and walking to the corner and back.</p><p>Those are still things I do today.</p><h3>Career woman who changed her career</h3><p><em>Meaghan Wagner is a 33-year-old digital marketer from Brooklyn, New York. She changed careers and left a relationship after experiencing burnout five years ago.</em></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7a64a920a904548cb6fc2ef14613a5e8/tumblr_inline_plsjj78h7B1tuwonz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><strong>How did burnout appear in your life?</strong>: The specter of burnout has been with me for as long as I can remember - certainly my whole working life. It&rsquo;s always been hard to spot because &ldquo;adults&rdquo; frequently undercut the experience, and make me feel bad for not working hard enough or being committed enough, often citing the lazy millennial trope.</p><p>For me, burning out happened spectacularly about five years ago. I&rsquo;m an active, productive person but I ran into a stretch of apathy that became all-consuming. I left the career path I&rsquo;d sunk years and a graduate degree on and ended the relationship of 10 years that, at the time, I believed had gotten me there.</p><p><strong>How did you take control?</strong>: In rebuilding my life, I made sure to structure every part of my life around me and what I wanted, not what I was supposed to want but what I actually wanted.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound radical or difficult, but really is on both counts. With relationships, jobs, second jobs, housework, vacations, anything that comes into my life, I am ruthless and honest about deciding what gets my attention and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p><h3>Executive who took a pause in her career</h3><p><em>Maryam Banikarim, 50 is the former chief marketing officer of Hyatt, Gannett, NBCUniversal and Univision. She <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/style/self-care/what-am-i-if-not-employed.html%20\" target=\"_blank\">decided to take a pause in her career</a> after leaving her role at Hyatt last year.</em></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/48d2135d6893e1907a9a3de7a784175f/tumblr_inline_plsjj7vcYB1tuwonz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><strong>How did burnout appear in your life?</strong>: I&rsquo;ve been working nonstop since I was 16. I&rsquo;m just one of those people who like to work and in the beginning of 2018, I began to feel a little rundown.</p><p>As the job pace picked up, I began to sort of feel less happy. That was the beginning of the sign and over the course of a year I sort of never regained my footing.</p><p>You begin to sacrifice your own things as your life becomes more complicated because you&rsquo;re also, besides working, taking care of your kids and family.</p><p><strong>How did you take control?</strong>: The first thing I did was really just decide to take a pause.</p><p>As a woman in an executive role, you&rsquo;re constantly asked about work-life balance and I find that to be a set up [because] there is no such thing as a work-life balance.</p><p>I always look at life as choices and chapters. You make different choices in different chapters and I reached a chapter where I wanted to make a different choice than being an executive, at least for a moment in time.</p><p>Someone gave me advice [for my pause] to find things that you want to do so you know you accomplished something. One of mine was going on a yoga retreat with my daughter. I signed up for a memoir-writing class and I decided to spend time with my grandmother in Venice Beach [California]. Those are three things that I would have accomplished.</p><p>The thing I struggle [now] with is making sure I leave room and space. Especially when you have a career that&rsquo;s been full, you get a million asks.</p><p>You have to exercise the power of saying no, which does not come naturally, or otherwise you end up filling your entire schedule with other types of things.</p><h3>Events planner who made a career change</h3><p><em>Shana Steele, 34, is general manager of The Wing, SOHO, a community space designed for women. She relocated for the job to New York City after building an events planning career in Washington, D.C. </em></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69f3128febcafa9f35c47eb49a7f17e8/tumblr_inline_plsjj8QHtC1tuwonz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><strong>How did burnout appear in your life?</strong>:  I realized I was good at my job and my work-life balance was just work, work, work.</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t really feeling fulfilled regarding creativity or that I was contributing anything useful to the world. It was difficult to recognize that I know I&rsquo;m good at what I do and I&rsquo;m really comfortable in what I&rsquo;m doing, but it might be time to see if I can contribute something more.</p><p><strong>How did you take control?</strong>: An offer was presented to me and I said, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m looking at this time now, and joining the company, as an adventure.</p><p>Right before I left D.C., I adopted a puppy because I wanted a buddy but also because he would give me a reason to go home every night and not stay at work all day. He might be the biggest change for me. He needs as much TLC as I do.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also recognized that things do need to get done and some things do take priority, but I&rsquo;m not on the clock 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and I do need to carve out time for myself. There are times in the day when my phone is on silent and I&rsquo;m not answering emails.</p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/feeling-burnout-symptoms-60470622\" target=\"_blank\">(Feeling burnout?
