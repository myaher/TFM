Right?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Behind him, Steve sighs. \u201cI never wanted to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d Tony says, and snatches his glass back from Steve\u2019s now-lax grip. He drains it in a single go and rises to his feet, tossing the glass aside as he does. It bounces on the couch cushions, once, twice, before falling to the floor with a sharp ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem now, huh?\u201d Tony asks, turning to face Steve. He looks like shit, Tony sees - covered in blood and mud and scratches, and right now, Tony doesn\u2019t give a shit. \u201cIs it that you can\u2019t hurt me again? Sorry, Rogers, but I\u2019m numbed and self-medicated, you can\u2019t touch me anymore -\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, Tony, that\u2019s not -\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Tony demands. \u201cWhy are you even fucking here?\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s brow is pinched, eyes wide like a puppy dog\u2019s, but that won\u2019t work on Tony anymore. He\u2019s seen the real Steve, now, and even the most pure of facades won\u2019t make him forget what it\u2019s hiding.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to check on you,\u201d Steve says quietly. \u201cYou looked rough, earlier, and I wanted to see -\u201c</p><p>\u201cTry again,\u201d Tony interrupts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Tony snaps. Steve sighs again, and the sound feels like it\u2019s grinding inside Tony\u2019s skull, pressing out against his ribcage. There is anger inside him, whole and growing, and Tony\u2019s running out of ways to calm it down.</p><p>\u201cYou got hit pretty hard today,\u201d Steve says finally. \u201cDid you go to medical?\u201d</p><p>Tony almost laughs. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Steve closes his eyes, like he can\u2019t bear the sight of Tony anymore. Yeah, well, Tony thinks. Get in line. \u201cDid you at least get Jarvis to check it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so worried will happen?\u201d Tony asks, pushing away from where he\u2019s leaning against the counter. He sways for a moment, unsteady on his feet, but he\u2019s able to regain his balance and heads towards the cupboards. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t get your game here, Rogers. You\u2019re being inconsistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Steve says quietly. \u201cIt was just a mistake, I didn\u2019t mean it -\u201c</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean what?\u201d Tony asks, grabbing another bottle of scotch from the cupboard. It\u2019s a cheaper bottle, lower-shelf label, and he doesn\u2019t know why he has it, but right now he doesn\u2019t care. He rips the cork out with his teeth, takes a swig, and turns to face Steve. \u201cWhich part didn\u2019t you mean, Steve? The sex with someone else behind my back? The money - my money - that you spent on her, keeping her in house and home? Telling me you loved me, and there was no one else?\u201d</p><p>Steve is quiet.</p><p>\u201cOr was it none of that?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cIs she not the one you regret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony -\u201c Steve starts, then stops. He sighs again. \u201cTony -\u201c</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Rogers,\u201d Tony spits, slamming down his bottle on the counter with a bang. \u201cFuck you so fucking much -\u201c</p><p>He crashes into Steve, chest to chest, and it takes his drunk body a moment to find Steve\u2019s lips. Steve\u2019s lips. He smells sweaty, and his skin is grimy and slick, but his kiss, oh, that\u2019s just the same. Hot and angry and just on the right edge of wrong. Steve\u2019s big hands come up to cup Tony\u2019s lower back, and Tony clutches his fingers in Steve\u2019s shoulder, kissing so hard he thinks he can taste blood. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he growls between kisses, \u201cFuck you, fuck -\u201c</p><p>They fuck against the worktable, Tony bent over with his cheek pressed against counter. Tony doesn\u2019t remember much after that, only waking up the next morning, half-dressed under a flimsy little afghan on the workshop futon. His location takes a moment to register, but when he does, he can\u2019t do anything but groan and heave himself to his feet, one hand pressed to his throbbing temple. He tells himself he\u2019s not disappointed. After all, you can only be disappointed if you have expectations, and Tony had learned not to expect things from Steve a long time ago.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d he says. He goes to find a drink.</p>",

He drains it in a single go and rises to his feet, tossing the glass aside as he does. It bounces on the couch cushions, once, twice, before falling to the floor with a sharp ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem now, huh?\u201d Tony asks, turning to face Steve. He looks like shit, Tony sees - covered in blood and mud and scratches, and right now, Tony doesn\u2019t give a shit. \u201cIs it that you can\u2019t hurt me again? Sorry, Rogers, but I\u2019m numbed and self-medicated, you can\u2019t touch me anymore -\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, Tony, that\u2019s not -\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Tony demands. \u201cWhy are you even fucking here?\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s brow is pinched, eyes wide like a puppy dog\u2019s, but that won\u2019t work on Tony anymore. He\u2019s seen the real Steve, now, and even the most pure of facades won\u2019t make him forget what it\u2019s hiding.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to check on you,\u201d Steve says quietly. \u201cYou looked rough, earlier, and I wanted to see -\u201c</p><p>\u201cTry again,\u201d Tony interrupts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Tony snaps. Steve sighs again, and the sound feels like it\u2019s grinding inside Tony\u2019s skull, pressing out against his ribcage. There is anger inside him, whole and growing, and Tony\u2019s running out of ways to calm it down.</p><p>\u201cYou got hit pretty hard today,\u201d Steve says finally. \u201cDid you go to medical?\u201d</p><p>Tony almost laughs. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Steve closes his eyes, like he can\u2019t bear the sight of Tony anymore. Yeah, well, Tony thinks. Get in line. \u201cDid you at least get Jarvis to check it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so worried will happen?\u201d Tony asks, pushing away from where he\u2019s leaning against the counter. He sways for a moment, unsteady on his feet, but he\u2019s able to regain his balance and heads towards the cupboards. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t get your game here, Rogers. You\u2019re being inconsistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Steve says quietly. \u201cIt was just a mistake, I didn\u2019t mean it -\u201c</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean what?\u201d Tony asks, grabbing another bottle of scotch from the cupboard. It\u2019s a cheaper bottle, lower-shelf label, and he doesn\u2019t know why he has it, but right now he doesn\u2019t care. He rips the cork out with his teeth, takes a swig, and turns to face Steve. \u201cWhich part didn\u2019t you mean, Steve? The sex with someone else behind my back? The money - my money - that you spent on her, keeping her in house and home? Telling me you loved me, and there was no one else?\u201d</p><p>Steve is quiet.</p><p>\u201cOr was it none of that?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cIs she not the one you regret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony -\u201c Steve starts, then stops. He sighs again. \u201cTony -\u201c</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Rogers,\u201d Tony spits, slamming down his bottle on the counter with a bang. \u201cFuck you so fucking much -\u201c</p><p>He crashes into Steve, chest to chest, and it takes his drunk body a moment to find Steve\u2019s lips. Steve\u2019s lips. He smells sweaty, and his skin is grimy and slick, but his kiss, oh, that\u2019s just the same. Hot and angry and just on the right edge of wrong. Steve\u2019s big hands come up to cup Tony\u2019s lower back, and Tony clutches his fingers in Steve\u2019s shoulder, kissing so hard he thinks he can taste blood. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he growls between kisses, \u201cFuck you, fuck -\u201c</p><p>They fuck against the worktable, Tony bent over with his cheek pressed against counter. Tony doesn\u2019t remember much after that, only waking up the next morning, half-dressed under a flimsy little afghan on the workshop futon. His location takes a moment to register, but when he does, he can\u2019t do anything but groan and heave himself to his feet, one hand pressed to his throbbing temple. He tells himself he\u2019s not disappointed. After all, you can only be disappointed if you have expectations, and Tony had learned not to expect things from Steve a long time ago.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d he says. He goes to find a drink.</p>",

That&rsquo;s what you get&ndash;the first words from the one person the universe says is perfect for you. Most people are born with them, or get them shortly after they&rsquo;re born. A tiny percentage of the population gets them years later. \n</p><p>\n  But \n  <i>\n    everyone\n  </i>\n   gets their words. \n</p><p>\n  By eighteen, Tony started to think maybe that was wrong. By twenty five, he knew it. And by the time he was thirty, he didn&rsquo;t \n  <i>\n    care\n  </i>\n  . \n</p><p>\n  Not about the pitying looks from his endless string of lovers, not about the way the media tacked his Wordless state onto his eccentricities. \u00a0Not about the gaping loneliness in his gut and the echoes of his father&rsquo;s voice, telling him no one would ever love him. Not about the lovers who leave him as they find their own soulmates.\n</p><p>\n  He didn&rsquo;t care. \n</p><p>\n  It hurt less, to not care. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  When he&rsquo;s thirty-two, he wakes up and sees messy black scrawled across his shoulder, dipping toward his clavicle and he scrambles to the mirror, almost dumping his bedmate on her ass as he does. \n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s there. \n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s there. \n</p><p>\n  Jesus fuck. He has a soulmate and it&rsquo;s a \n  <i>\n    baby\n  </i>\n   but&ndash;he has a soulmate. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s messy, thin scrawling lines, delicate as spider silk, and&ndash;\n</p><p>\n  He blinks.\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Bite me, tincan. \n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  Promising start, really. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  When his convoy gets bombed, Tony has a lot of regrets. But the one that rings loudest is, \n  <i>\n    I haven\u2019t met them yet.\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  He \n  <i>\n    wants\n  </i>\n   that. It\u2019s been three years since his Words appeared, and he hasn\u2019t told anyone but Rhodey, but they\u2019re precious, they\u2019re a promise he holds close when the world is too dark for him to handle. \n</p><p>\n  He feels the heat of the flames, can smell the blood and gasoline on the air and terror so thick it\u2019s choking and thinks, \n  <i>\n    not yet. Please, not yet. \n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  He doesn&rsquo;t die. \n</p><p>\n  As they torture him, he wishes he would. That he \n  <i>\n    could\n  </i>\n  . But he doesn&rsquo;t die. And when he&rsquo;s tossed back in his cell, he clings to that cryptic line on his shoulder, clings to it like a promise. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s not a promise. Plenty of people die without meeting the Soulmate, without ever hearing their Words. \n</p><p>\n  But Tony lived thirty two years without his and he refuses to die like this, refuses to let the words scrawled on his five year old Mate&rsquo;s skin turn white. \n</p><p>\n  He lives because for once in his life, he has something he \n  <i>\n    has\n  </i>\n   to live for.\n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  When he first puts on the suit in that cave, and uses it to walk out&ndash;\n</p><p>\n  He understands, maybe. Maybe. What that damn sentence scrawled on his\u00a0shoulder means. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  He builds more. Sometimes, when he\u2019s working on a new suit, and Pepper is watching him with apprehensive caution, when Rhodey looks at him in quiet sympathy&ndash;he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s building the suit because he needs to for Stark Industries and the world&ndash;or if he\u2019s doing it because if he does, if he builds enough suits, and walks in front of enough people, maybe one day, someone will shout at him and he won\u2019t be so goddamn lonely. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  It doesn\u2019t happen. It never happens. He tries to believe that it\u2019s just because his soulmate is young&ndash;god so young, so impossible&ndash;tries to find something that means \n  <i>\n    anything\n  </i>\n   with Pepper. The world gets threatened, again and again, and he&hellip;he doesn\u2019t stop \n  <i>\n    hoping\n  </i>\n  , so much as he becomes resigned to it. \n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s forty eight, and has lived with his soulmark for sixteen years, lived without one for most of his life, and living without a soulmate might be lonely&ndash;but it\u2019s all he\u2019s ever known. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  Tony sees the kid flipping his way through narrow streets and impossibly tall buildings on his way to a meeting Pepper will be furious if he misses. \n</p><p>\n  He sees the kid, an instant before he cuts through the red and blue blur\u2019s arc, and tangles himself up in sticky thin wire. \n</p><p>\n  The kid shrieks, plunging as his&ndash;jesus this is \n  <i>\n    webbing&ndash;\n  </i>\n   gets cut, and Tony curses as he plunges after him, catching him by the ankle as the kid shoots that webbing and flings himself up and away from Tony.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAre you an idiot or do you have a death wish?\u201d he bursts out, frustrated. \n</p><p>\n  The kid jerks on his web, head twisting to stare at Tony and then&ndash; \n</p><p>\n  \u201cBite me, tincan!\u201d \n</p><p>\n  Tony\u2019s heart does this weird thing that makes FRIDAY snap his name in alarm, and he loses a good fifteen feet of altitude and when he looks around&ndash;\n</p><p>\n  The kid is gone. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s late for his meeting, and his hands are shaking so bad throughout it that Pepper cuts it short and drags him to her office, shoving a cup of juice in his hand while she peers at him worriedly. \u201cHey. Talk to me, Tony.\u201d \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI found him,\u201d he says, lips numb. \u201cI&ndash;Pepper, I found him.\u201d \n</p><p>\n  She\u2019s staring at him, her eyes wide and soft and he can\u2019t stop \n  <i>\n    shaking\n  </i>\n  . \u201cWhere is he?\u201d she asks, gently, and he thinks about it again, that split second exchange in the air above New York. \n</p><p>\n  Of the biting anger and the impossibly young voice snarling at him. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cHe took off. God&ndash;Pep, I have no idea who he is.\u201d \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  The thing is&ndash;he does know. He knows who Spiderman is because he\u2019s been keeping tabs on the kid. A masked vigilante, even one that likes helping little old ladies cross the street and rescue stray cats, in his city, in the shadow of his tower, of \n  <i>\n    course\n  </i>\n   Tony was keeping tabs on him. \n</p><p>\n  He knows exactly who and where to find his soulmate. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~ \n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhen are you going to meet him?\u201d Pepper asks, one day almost a month later. Tony shrugs. There\u2019s been time. He had one quick trip to MIT for a speech, one run to a UN meeting that turned into a shit show that he was able to get away from&ndash;if Cap and his soulmate wanted to go on the run, international law protected Steve from turning on Bucky, and he wasn\u2019t going to get in their way. It wouldn\u2019t do any good and he had other things on his mind. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you brought him here?\u201d she asks, gently. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cHe\u2019s a kid, Pepper,\u201d he says, helplessly, like that is enough. \n</p><p>\n  Unfortunately, it is.\n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  The tower is dark, when he lands on the balcony. The remaining Avengers are in the compound upstate and the tower is still his, but it\u2019s just a matter of time before they sell it. But it\u2019s \n  <i>\n    his\n  </i>\n   and the alarms sounded, routed directly to him&ndash;and here he is. Standing on a dark balcony, staring at a kid. \n</p><p>\n  Peter Parker, pale and beautiful, with big brown eyes and messy curls and a tight lean body under his suit&ndash;he\u2019s wearing the new one, the one he\u2019d had delivered last week. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou didn\u2019t come after me,\u201d Peter says, softly, his voice high and sweet and Tony steps out of the suit, onto the balcony and closer to him. \u201cI&ndash;I know&ndash;I\u2019m not what you want&ndash;b-b-but,&ndash;\u201d \n</p><p>\n  Tony growls and reaches out, because he fucked up, he fucked up he got it wrong, and this kid, he\u2019s&mdash;\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s in Tony\u2019s arms, coming to rest against his chest with a choked off little noise, almost of relief, and all the tension Tony didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been carrying just&hellip;melts. \n</p><p>\n  Drops away like cut strings. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cKid,\u201d Tony whispers into soft soft curls. \u201cYou\u2019re the <i>only</i> thing I want.\u201d \n</p><p>\n  Peter makes a quiet, hurt noise against him and Tony\u2019s arms tighten around him. \n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t ever want to let go, doesn\u2019t want to ever not feel the solid weight of his boy in his arms, doesn\u2019t want to live without the warmth of Peter pressed against his chest. \n</p><p>\n  He has no idea how he lived this long without it, but there are words. Three impossible first words that got shouted at him over the streets of Queens, that kept him alive in the desert and all the long years since. \n</p><p>\n  He holds his boy and for the first time in his life, he doesn\u2019t feel alone. \n</p>",

Standing on a dark balcony, staring at a kid. \n</p><p>\n  Peter Parker, pale and beautiful, with big brown eyes and messy curls and a tight lean body under his suit\u2013he\u2019s wearing the new one, the one he\u2019d had delivered last week. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou didn\u2019t come after me,\u201d Peter says, softly, his voice high and sweet and Tony steps out of the suit, onto the balcony and closer to him. \u201cI\u2013I know\u2013I\u2019m not what you want\u2013b-b-but,\u2013\u201d \n</p><p>\n  Tony growls and reaches out, because he fucked up, he fucked up he got it wrong, and this kid, he\u2019s\u2014\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s in Tony\u2019s arms, coming to rest against his chest with a choked off little noise, almost of relief, and all the tension Tony didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been carrying just\u2026melts. \n</p><p>\n  Drops away like cut strings. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cKid,\u201d Tony whispers into soft soft curls. \u201cYou\u2019re the <i>only</i> thing I want.\u201d \n</p><p>\n  Peter makes a quiet, hurt noise against him and Tony\u2019s arms tighten around him. \n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t ever want to let go, doesn\u2019t want to ever not feel the solid weight of his boy in his arms, doesn\u2019t want to live without the warmth of Peter pressed against his chest. \n</p><p>\n  He has no idea how he lived this long without it, but there are words. Three impossible first words that got shouted at him over the streets of Queens, that kept him alive in the desert and all the long years since. \n</p><p>\n  He holds his boy and for the first time in his life, he doesn\u2019t feel alone. \n</p>",

The world gets threatened, again and again, and he&hellip;he doesn&rsquo;t stop \n  <i>\n    hoping\n  </i>\n  , so much as he becomes resigned to it. \n</p><p>\n  He&rsquo;s forty eight, and has lived with his soulmark for sixteen years, lived without one for most of his life, and living without a soulmate might be lonely&ndash;but it&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s ever known. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  Tony sees the kid flipping his way through narrow streets and impossibly tall buildings on his way to a meeting Pepper will be furious if he misses. \n</p><p>\n  He sees the kid, an instant before he cuts through the red and blue blur&rsquo;s arc, and tangles himself up in sticky thin wire. \n</p><p>\n  The kid shrieks, plunging as his&ndash;jesus this is \n  <i>\n    webbing&ndash;\n  </i>\n   gets cut, and Tony curses as he plunges after him, catching him by the ankle as the kid shoots that webbing and flings himself up and away from Tony.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Are you an idiot or do you have a death wish?&rdquo; he bursts out, frustrated. \n</p><p>\n  The kid jerks on his web, head twisting to stare at Tony and then&ndash; \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Bite me, tincan!&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n  Tony&rsquo;s heart does this weird thing that makes FRIDAY snap his name in alarm, and he loses a good fifteen feet of altitude and when he looks around&ndash;\n</p><p>\n  The kid is gone. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  He&rsquo;s late for his meeting, and his hands are shaking so bad throughout it that Pepper cuts it short and drags him to her office, shoving a cup of juice in his hand while she peers at him worriedly. &ldquo;Hey. Talk to me, Tony.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I found him,&rdquo; he says, lips numb. &ldquo;I&ndash;Pepper, I found him.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n  She&rsquo;s staring at him, her eyes wide and soft and he can&rsquo;t stop \n  <i>\n    shaking\n  </i>\n  . &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she asks, gently, and he thinks about it again, that split second exchange in the air above New York. \n</p><p>\n  Of the biting anger and the impossibly young voice snarling at him. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;He took off. God&ndash;Pep, I have no idea who he is.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  The thing is&ndash;he does know. He knows who Spiderman is because he&rsquo;s been keeping tabs on the kid. A masked vigilante, even one that likes helping little old ladies cross the street and rescue stray cats, in his city, in the shadow of his tower, of \n  <i>\n    course\n  </i>\n   Tony was keeping tabs on him. \n</p><p>\n  He knows exactly who and where to find his soulmate. \n</p><p>\n  ~*~ \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;When are you going to meet him?&rdquo; Pepper asks, one day almost a month later. Tony shrugs. There&rsquo;s been time. He had one quick trip to MIT for a speech, one run to a UN meeting that turned into a shit show that he was able to get away from&ndash;if Cap and his soulmate wanted to go on the run, international law protected Steve from turning on Bucky, and he wasn&rsquo;t going to get in their way. It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good and he had other things on his mind. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you brought him here?&rdquo; she asks, gently. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a kid, Pepper,&rdquo; he says, helplessly, like that is enough. \n</p><p>\n  Unfortunately, it is.\n</p><p>\n  ~*~\n</p><p>\n  The tower is dark, when he lands on the balcony. The remaining Avengers are in the compound upstate and the tower is still his, but it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before they sell it. But it&rsquo;s \n  <i>\n    his\n  </i>\n   and the alarms sounded, routed directly to him&ndash;and here he is. Standing on a dark balcony, staring at a kid. \n</p><p>\n  Peter Parker, pale and beautiful, with big brown eyes and messy curls and a tight lean body under his suit&ndash;he&rsquo;s wearing the new one, the one he&rsquo;d had delivered last week. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come after me,&rdquo; Peter says, softly, his voice high and sweet and Tony steps out of the suit, onto the balcony and closer to him. &ldquo;I&ndash;I know&ndash;I&rsquo;m not what you want&ndash;b-b-but,&ndash;&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n  Tony growls and reaches out, because he fucked up, he fucked up he got it wrong, and this kid, he&rsquo;s&mdash;\n</p><p>\n  He&rsquo;s in Tony&rsquo;s arms, coming to rest against his chest with a choked off little noise, almost of relief, and all the tension Tony didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;d been carrying just&hellip;melts. \n</p><p>\n  Drops away like cut strings. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Kid,&rdquo; Tony whispers into soft soft curls. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the <i>only</i> thing I want.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n  Peter makes a quiet, hurt noise against him and Tony&rsquo;s arms tighten around him. \n</p><p>\n  He doesn&rsquo;t ever want to let go, doesn&rsquo;t want to ever not feel the solid weight of his boy in his arms, doesn&rsquo;t want to live without the warmth of Peter pressed against his chest. \n</p><p>\n  He has no idea how he lived this long without it, but there are words. Three impossible first words that got shouted at him over the streets of Queens, that kept him alive in the desert and all the long years since. \n</p><p>\n  He holds his boy and for the first time in his life, he doesn&rsquo;t feel alone. \n</p>",

Don\u2019t even remember how I got it now.\u201d</p><p>He arched his brows and gave you a look that said he didn\u2019t believe a\nword you were saying. \u201cYou did not have that scar yesterday. Or even today when\nyou handed Tony his coffee. Don\u2019t bullshit me, Y/N. I\u2019m more observant than\nmost people give me credit for.\u201d He slid off his glasses and tossed them onto a\nnearby table before crossing his arms over his chest. His gaze never wavered\nfrom you as he waited for you to speak.</p><p>Finally, you sighed and paced away from him. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to\nbullshit you, Bruce. I just wasn\u2019t intending on telling anyone. Not for a\nwhile, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you <i>are</i> Tony\u2019s soulmate\nthen?\u201d He dropped his arms and took a step toward you.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Suddenly unable to speak, you nodded. </p><p>\u201cOkay. And you\u2019ve known since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter he was missing. He was doing a press conference and I saw him on\nthe television. Our bruises matched.\u201d</p><p>He raked a hand through his already messy hair and huffed out a breath.\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d He gestured toward one of the chairs at his\nsmall kitchen table. You sat and he took the one across from you. \u201cAre you\nplanning to tell him?\u201d</p><p>You debated for a moment whether to even the continue the conversation\nbefore deciding it was too much of a relief to have someone to talk to for you\nto stop now. If things got back to Tony, you\u2019d just have to deal with it then.\n\u201cThat was my intention when I came here. I tried to get through to him by phone\nand I couldn\u2019t so I just showed up. They assumed I was here for a job interview\nand here we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you mentioned you were his soulmate when you tried to\ncall?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone would have believed me if I had. Besides, that\u2019s\nthe kind of news you need to deliver yourself don\u2019t you think?\u201d You leaned back\nin your seat. </p><p>He ran his fingers across the surface of the table as he thought. \u201cAll\nof that aside, why haven\u2019t you told him since then? You\u2019ve had time. He\u2019s been\nlooking for you for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that Tony had wanted to find you made your heart a little\nlighter. It also made you feel a little guilty. \u201cHe has a girlfriend, Bruce.\nI\u2019m not going to be what breaks them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Pepper?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cShe\u2019s not really his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>You pursed your lips thinking over everything you had seen the last few\nweeks. \u201cAre they dating?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head from side to side. \u201cWell, I mean, technically\u2014\u201d</p><p>You held up a hand to cut him off. \u201cTechnically is enough of a\nrelationship for me. I\u2019ll tell him when the time is right. This isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that it isn\u2019t? I won\u2019t tell him if you don\u2019t want me\nto, but you should. And the sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019m not going to let him drop his entire life because\nof me. That\u2019s not fair to him, Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dropped yours to come here for him. Shouldn\u2019t he get the same\nchoice?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>It took a while before you were convinced that Bruce wouldn\u2019t spill\nyour secret. It wasn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t want to tell Tony. You would love\nnothing more than to be with him but you didn\u2019t want him to pick you just\nbecause you were his soulmate. You wanted him to get to know you as a person\nfirst and a soulmate second. Things like that took time. </p><p>You were still deep in thought when you left Bruce\u2019s room to head back\nto your floor. </p><p>\u201cEverything sorted?\u201d </p><p>The unexpected voice startled you and you found yourself staring at Tony\nwith wide eyes. \u201cHuh?\u201d Well, that was eloquent, Y/N.</p><p>Tony straightened from where he\u2019d been leaning in the doorway of the lab.\nYou wondered briefly how long he\u2019d been standing there. His gaze darted past\nyou to Bruce\u2019s door before settling back on you. \u201cDid you get Bruce squared\naway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you answered feeling moderately guilty for misleading him. \u201cIt\u2019s\nall good.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward as his tongue darted out to moisten his lips. \u201cWhat\ndid he need anyway? You two were in there for a while.\u201d</p><p>You lifted one brow. \u201cWe got busy talking. You know how it is.\u201d</p><p>He hummed in what you assumed was agreement. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you get\nback to it.\u201d With that he turned and went back into the lab. </p><p>You stood there for a moment trying to process the strange scene you\u2019d just\nbeen part of until your phone rang. \u201cHello,\u201d you answered without paying\nattention to who was calling. </p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d came Fury\u2019s deep voice and you instantly forgot\nabout anything else. Why was the director of SHIELD calling you?</p><p>***</p><p>As soon as you were off the phone with the director, you spent the next\ntwo hours making calls, placing orders and issuing instructions. Once you were\ncertain everything you needed done would be completed by morning, you called a\nmeeting in the Avengers conference room. </p><p>As the team shuffled in, they fell quiet as they found you waiting for\nthem. Tony and Bruce were the last two to file in. Tony scowled as his gaze\nfell on you. \u201cI thought this was a team meeting. What are you doing here, hot\nstuff?\u201d</p><p>You arched a brow at the nickname. \u201cIt is a team meeting, Tony. Fury\nthought I could handle this one.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cWould you mind repeating that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sit down,\u201d you instructed the science bros. \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind\nof meeting.\u201d You passed a thin folder to everyone at the table. \u201cFury is\nexpanding the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam Wilson, the Maximoff twins, and James Barnes have all been\napproved on a probationary basis.\u201d From the corner of your eye you saw Steve\nsit straighter in his chair as a grin curled his lips. \u201cSam will maintain his own\nresidence. The twins will be on the floor below Nat and Clint and Bucky will be\non your floor, Steve.\u201d</p><p>Not everyone looked particularly thrilled with the news you were giving\nthem. \u201cThe information in the folders includes what they are required to do to\nmaintain their status on the team. Steve, Bucky requires daily therapy for the\ntime being, would you prefer I bring someone in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d he responded with no hesitation. </p><p>You shifted your attention to Tony who just frowned at the folder in\nfront of him. \u201cTony.\u201d You\u2019d said his name softly but it was enough to get his\nattention. He looked up with wide eyes. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe twins need therapy, too. Three times a week. And then there are\nthe after mission sessions. Should I see about getting one on staff?\u201d</p><p>Natasha huffed a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Fury didn\u2019t offer to move one\nin.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at that. \u201cOh, he did. I didn\u2019t think any of you would care\nfor a SHIELD shrink when we can hire our own. Then you don\u2019t have to worry\nabout them reporting back to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee. This is why I like her,\u201d Clint piped up. \u201cAlways thinking.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips twitched for a second before he gave in and smiled. \u201cHire us\na shrink, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>With Jarvis\u2019 help it didn\u2019t take you long at all to find the perfect candidate\nand he was quickly hired. Anxious to share the news with Tony you were talking before\nhe could even acknowledge your presence in the lab. You read off the man\u2019s qualifications\nand talked about his references and then realized Tony wasn\u2019t commenting on\nanything you said.</p><p>You looked up from you tablet to find him smiling as he looked between\nthe device in his hand and you. It was easy to see that you amused him. Your\nface heated. \u201cSorry, I ramble when I get excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to exploring that trait of yours in more detail later,\nbut why are you so excited about hiring a team therapist? Or should I not ask?\nIs he handsome? Are you impressed by the size of his PHD?\u201d</p><p>You blinked as your brain tried to catch up with your soulmate\u2019s\nteasing. He was certainly in a flirtatious mood. As you looked him over, you\nrealized that he had stripped down to a white tank. And coming from beneath it\nwas a bright blue glow. \u201cUm, Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>You gestured vaguely in his direction. \u201cYou\u2019re glowing.\u201d You tore your\ngaze from his chest to meet his eyes. </p><p>His brow furrowed and he glanced down. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t\nnoticed before. It keeps me alive. Keeps shrapnel from going into my heart.\u201d</p><p>That made your chest hurt. What if he wasn\u2019t a genius? Would he already\nbe dead? You sat your tablet down on the table and stepped around until you stood\nnext to Tony, his eyes following you. \u201cCan I see?\u201d </p><p>He tilted his head and studied you for a long moment and you wondered\nwhat he was thinking. Finally, he emptied his hands and turned on his stool so\nhe was facing you. In one swift movement, he took his tank off and tossed it on\nthe table beside him. \u201cLook all you want, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You closed the small distance remaining between the two of you, your\neyes glued to the device in his chest. No wonder your scar had never faded.\nThis thing had to be inserted inside of him. It was a permanent wound. You\nreached your hand out to touch it before you caught yourself. \u201cSorry,\u201d you said,\nsnatching your fingers back just before you actually made contact. </p><p>Tony\u2019s warm hand wrapped around yours and he tugged you closer. Your\nheart raced and you sucked in a deep breath as he laid your hand against his\nchest. He kept his over the top of it. \u201cIt\u2019s called an arc reactor,\u201d he\nexplained. \u201cIt not only keeps me breathing, it powers the suit.\u201d</p><p>You glanced up at the sound of his voice and swallowed past the lump in\nyour throat as you realized just how close you were to him. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHurt like hell at the time. Now, not so much.\u201d His thumb\nrubbed against the hand he was holding making a tremor shoot through you. </p><p>You reached your other hand up and traced one of the many scars that\ndecorated his skin. He hissed in a breath. Your first instinct was to apologize\nbut you resisted the urge and looked up to meet Tony\u2019s gaze. His eyes studied\nyour face as the corner of his mouth kicked up in a grin. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning\non checking out all my scars, it\u2019s going to take a while. Not that I mind. I\njust think you should be prepared.\u201d</p><p>The two of you leaned toward each other and your eyelids closed as you prepared\nfor the kiss. </p><p>\u201cMs. Potts is requesting that you meet her in your apartment, Mr. Stark.\u201d\nJarvis\u2019 voice cut through the silence in the room and you took a giant step\naway from Tony as you were reminded of his girlfriend.</p><p>Your face was warm and you suddenly found yourself unable to meet his\ngaze. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Jarvis. Impeccable timing,\u201d Tony bit out.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d</p><p> You couldn\u2019t keep yourself from glancing\nup. Tony gave you a smile as he put his shirt back on. His eyes stayed locked\non yours as he gave instructions to the AI. \u201cTell Pepper I\u2019ll meet her in her\noffice.\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward you, stopping when you took a step back to maintain\nthe distance. He held up his hands and leaned against the table behind him so\nyou knew he was giving you the space you needed right now. \u201cPepper is not my\ngirlfriend.\u201d</p><p>You bit your lip. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is.\u201d</p><p>You glanced down briefly before looking back up. \u201cThen does she know\nshe\u2019s not your girlfriend? Because I\u2019m not so sure she does.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes studied you but he said nothing. </p><p>You cleared your throat and gestured toward the door. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cJust remember, sweetheart, we\u2019re not even close to\ndone here.\u201d</p><p>Battle Scars:\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1EOTv7fAZM4h0FKEkehyw\" target=\"_blank\">@i-dontwikeit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m76mRZjFU5Yp4Yk46kf_BFA\" target=\"_blank\">@thevanishedillusion</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR287GpRZmmKlSGxWVhmmHg\" target=\"_blank\">@amandamartinez3568</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZCtm6R4Zodi8sl3LNKAagQ\" target=\"_blank\">@clumsy-hailles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxu-RrpX9uEo47831aqlZfg\" target=\"_blank\">@little-nonny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_q7md8mQHjx35U8_J5cScg\" target=\"_blank\">@tonystarkismyboy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgfG1wPYSeIMrz0dToJSqDg\" target=\"_blank\">@redfoxwritesstuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTBAkGECQtMeTwQAy7PObGw\" target=\"_blank\">@lowkeyofsassguard</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-XaxKkdRIJefMyg7hN4OIQ\" target=\"_blank\">@sherlocked-whovian-1969</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMG5mpATEY8-EJjQ0wseZ4A\" target=\"_blank\">@tori24rose</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\" target=\"_blank\">@a&ndash;1&ndash;1&ndash;3</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP15BArKOFAAVa-QPKSM7ew\" target=\"_blank\">@youclickedthislink</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WxeI_mTTHh9SJkDn9Bxfw\" target=\"_blank\">@beckastark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1c4zemabPWs4w9s6bjOEzQ\" target=\"_blank\">@confusedhada</a> <strike>@nuggeteater-dot-com </strike><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maPT8ahAbC_7OJBw9SxniaA\" target=\"_blank\">@bluehuskey2099</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIGZtAUr2XAk_fZRtL9sedg\" target=\"_blank\">@kit-kat-katie99</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\" target=\"_blank\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6ICu69iOas1vHdIkHaUDNw\" target=\"_blank\">@staringmoony</a></p><p>All the Things:\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDyLUY4sIN2n-OXTmmVEmcw\" target=\"_blank\">@swanky-batman</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcNAXgffxr0I-6d7OSQWR8A\" target=\"_blank\">@rissyrapp20</a> @<a title=\"startrekkingaroundasgard\" href=\"https://startrekkingaroundasgard.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">startrekkingaroundasgard</a> @<a href=\"http://spooookyscary.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">spooookyscary</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmOCGKNSOZQiDMSUH0Ll6A\" target=\"_blank\">@taylordrunkonwhiskey</a> @<a title=\"thewolf-and-thesheep\" href=\"https://thewolf-and-thesheep.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>thewolf-and-thesheep</b></a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq8dWkka_5TnBq7OQx8gLvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@laneygthememequeen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT7zFrL-uywQSLhCxfj5Hyw\" target=\"_blank\">@collette04</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml-MYLZoLh-1xdOkp7Rt9yw\" target=\"_blank\">@shatteredabby</a>\u00a0</p>",

Not for a\nwhile, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you <i>are</i> Tony\u2019s soulmate\nthen?\u201d He dropped his arms and took a step toward you.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Suddenly unable to speak, you nodded. </p><p>\u201cOkay. And you\u2019ve known since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter he was missing. He was doing a press conference and I saw him on\nthe television. Our bruises matched.\u201d</p><p>He raked a hand through his already messy hair and huffed out a breath.\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d He gestured toward one of the chairs at his\nsmall kitchen table. You sat and he took the one across from you. \u201cAre you\nplanning to tell him?\u201d</p><p>You debated for a moment whether to even the continue the conversation\nbefore deciding it was too much of a relief to have someone to talk to for you\nto stop now. If things got back to Tony, you\u2019d just have to deal with it then.\n\u201cThat was my intention when I came here. I tried to get through to him by phone\nand I couldn\u2019t so I just showed up. They assumed I was here for a job interview\nand here we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you mentioned you were his soulmate when you tried to\ncall?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone would have believed me if I had. Besides, that\u2019s\nthe kind of news you need to deliver yourself don\u2019t you think?\u201d You leaned back\nin your seat. </p><p>He ran his fingers across the surface of the table as he thought. \u201cAll\nof that aside, why haven\u2019t you told him since then? You\u2019ve had time. He\u2019s been\nlooking for you for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that Tony had wanted to find you made your heart a little\nlighter. It also made you feel a little guilty. \u201cHe has a girlfriend, Bruce.\nI\u2019m not going to be what breaks them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Pepper?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cShe\u2019s not really his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>You pursed your lips thinking over everything you had seen the last few\nweeks. \u201cAre they dating?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head from side to side. \u201cWell, I mean, technically\u2014\u201d</p><p>You held up a hand to cut him off. \u201cTechnically is enough of a\nrelationship for me. I\u2019ll tell him when the time is right. This isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that it isn\u2019t? I won\u2019t tell him if you don\u2019t want me\nto, but you should. And the sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019m not going to let him drop his entire life because\nof me. That\u2019s not fair to him, Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dropped yours to come here for him. Shouldn\u2019t he get the same\nchoice?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>It took a while before you were convinced that Bruce wouldn\u2019t spill\nyour secret. It wasn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t want to tell Tony. You would love\nnothing more than to be with him but you didn\u2019t want him to pick you just\nbecause you were his soulmate. You wanted him to get to know you as a person\nfirst and a soulmate second. Things like that took time. </p><p>You were still deep in thought when you left Bruce\u2019s room to head back\nto your floor. </p><p>\u201cEverything sorted?\u201d </p><p>The unexpected voice startled you and you found yourself staring at Tony\nwith wide eyes. \u201cHuh?\u201d Well, that was eloquent, Y/N.</p><p>Tony straightened from where he\u2019d been leaning in the doorway of the lab.\nYou wondered briefly how long he\u2019d been standing there. His gaze darted past\nyou to Bruce\u2019s door before settling back on you. \u201cDid you get Bruce squared\naway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you answered feeling moderately guilty for misleading him. \u201cIt\u2019s\nall good.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward as his tongue darted out to moisten his lips. \u201cWhat\ndid he need anyway? You two were in there for a while.\u201d</p><p>You lifted one brow. \u201cWe got busy talking. You know how it is.\u201d</p><p>He hummed in what you assumed was agreement. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you get\nback to it.\u201d With that he turned and went back into the lab. </p><p>You stood there for a moment trying to process the strange scene you\u2019d just\nbeen part of until your phone rang. \u201cHello,\u201d you answered without paying\nattention to who was calling. </p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d came Fury\u2019s deep voice and you instantly forgot\nabout anything else. Why was the director of SHIELD calling you?</p><p>***</p><p>As soon as you were off the phone with the director, you spent the next\ntwo hours making calls, placing orders and issuing instructions. Once you were\ncertain everything you needed done would be completed by morning, you called a\nmeeting in the Avengers conference room. </p><p>As the team shuffled in, they fell quiet as they found you waiting for\nthem. Tony and Bruce were the last two to file in. Tony scowled as his gaze\nfell on you. \u201cI thought this was a team meeting. What are you doing here, hot\nstuff?\u201d</p><p>You arched a brow at the nickname. \u201cIt is a team meeting, Tony. Fury\nthought I could handle this one.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cWould you mind repeating that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sit down,\u201d you instructed the science bros. \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind\nof meeting.\u201d You passed a thin folder to everyone at the table. \u201cFury is\nexpanding the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam Wilson, the Maximoff twins, and James Barnes have all been\napproved on a probationary basis.\u201d From the corner of your eye you saw Steve\nsit straighter in his chair as a grin curled his lips. \u201cSam will maintain his own\nresidence. The twins will be on the floor below Nat and Clint and Bucky will be\non your floor, Steve.\u201d</p><p>Not everyone looked particularly thrilled with the news you were giving\nthem. \u201cThe information in the folders includes what they are required to do to\nmaintain their status on the team. Steve, Bucky requires daily therapy for the\ntime being, would you prefer I bring someone in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d he responded with no hesitation. </p><p>You shifted your attention to Tony who just frowned at the folder in\nfront of him. \u201cTony.\u201d You\u2019d said his name softly but it was enough to get his\nattention. He looked up with wide eyes. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe twins need therapy, too. Three times a week. And then there are\nthe after mission sessions. Should I see about getting one on staff?\u201d</p><p>Natasha huffed a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Fury didn\u2019t offer to move one\nin.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at that. \u201cOh, he did. I didn\u2019t think any of you would care\nfor a SHIELD shrink when we can hire our own. Then you don\u2019t have to worry\nabout them reporting back to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee. This is why I like her,\u201d Clint piped up. \u201cAlways thinking.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips twitched for a second before he gave in and smiled. \u201cHire us\na shrink, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>With Jarvis\u2019 help it didn\u2019t take you long at all to find the perfect candidate\nand he was quickly hired. Anxious to share the news with Tony you were talking before\nhe could even acknowledge your presence in the lab. You read off the man\u2019s qualifications\nand talked about his references and then realized Tony wasn\u2019t commenting on\nanything you said.</p><p>You looked up from you tablet to find him smiling as he looked between\nthe device in his hand and you. It was easy to see that you amused him. Your\nface heated. \u201cSorry, I ramble when I get excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to exploring that trait of yours in more detail later,\nbut why are you so excited about hiring a team therapist? Or should I not ask?\nIs he handsome? Are you impressed by the size of his PHD?\u201d</p><p>You blinked as your brain tried to catch up with your soulmate\u2019s\nteasing. He was certainly in a flirtatious mood. As you looked him over, you\nrealized that he had stripped down to a white tank. And coming from beneath it\nwas a bright blue glow. \u201cUm, Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>You gestured vaguely in his direction. \u201cYou\u2019re glowing.\u201d You tore your\ngaze from his chest to meet his eyes. </p><p>His brow furrowed and he glanced down. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t\nnoticed before. It keeps me alive. Keeps shrapnel from going into my heart.\u201d</p><p>That made your chest hurt. What if he wasn\u2019t a genius? Would he already\nbe dead? You sat your tablet down on the table and stepped around until you stood\nnext to Tony, his eyes following you. \u201cCan I see?\u201d </p><p>He tilted his head and studied you for a long moment and you wondered\nwhat he was thinking. Finally, he emptied his hands and turned on his stool so\nhe was facing you. In one swift movement, he took his tank off and tossed it on\nthe table beside him. \u201cLook all you want, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You closed the small distance remaining between the two of you, your\neyes glued to the device in his chest. No wonder your scar had never faded.\nThis thing had to be inserted inside of him. It was a permanent wound. You\nreached your hand out to touch it before you caught yourself. \u201cSorry,\u201d you said,\nsnatching your fingers back just before you actually made contact. </p><p>Tony\u2019s warm hand wrapped around yours and he tugged you closer. Your\nheart raced and you sucked in a deep breath as he laid your hand against his\nchest. He kept his over the top of it. \u201cIt\u2019s called an arc reactor,\u201d he\nexplained. \u201cIt not only keeps me breathing, it powers the suit.\u201d</p><p>You glanced up at the sound of his voice and swallowed past the lump in\nyour throat as you realized just how close you were to him. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHurt like hell at the time. Now, not so much.\u201d His thumb\nrubbed against the hand he was holding making a tremor shoot through you. </p><p>You reached your other hand up and traced one of the many scars that\ndecorated his skin. He hissed in a breath. Your first instinct was to apologize\nbut you resisted the urge and looked up to meet Tony\u2019s gaze. His eyes studied\nyour face as the corner of his mouth kicked up in a grin. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning\non checking out all my scars, it\u2019s going to take a while. Not that I mind. I\njust think you should be prepared.\u201d</p><p>The two of you leaned toward each other and your eyelids closed as you prepared\nfor the kiss. </p><p>\u201cMs. Potts is requesting that you meet her in your apartment, Mr. Stark.\u201d\nJarvis\u2019 voice cut through the silence in the room and you took a giant step\naway from Tony as you were reminded of his girlfriend.</p><p>Your face was warm and you suddenly found yourself unable to meet his\ngaze. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Jarvis. Impeccable timing,\u201d Tony bit out.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d</p><p> You couldn\u2019t keep yourself from glancing\nup. Tony gave you a smile as he put his shirt back on. His eyes stayed locked\non yours as he gave instructions to the AI. \u201cTell Pepper I\u2019ll meet her in her\noffice.\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward you, stopping when you took a step back to maintain\nthe distance. He held up his hands and leaned against the table behind him so\nyou knew he was giving you the space you needed right now. \u201cPepper is not my\ngirlfriend.\u201d</p><p>You bit your lip. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is.\u201d</p><p>You glanced down briefly before looking back up. \u201cThen does she know\nshe\u2019s not your girlfriend? Because I\u2019m not so sure she does.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes studied you but he said nothing. </p><p>You cleared your throat and gestured toward the door. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cJust remember, sweetheart, we\u2019re not even close to\ndone here.\u201d</p><p>Battle Scars:\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1EOTv7fAZM4h0FKEkehyw\" target=\"_blank\">@i-dontwikeit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m76mRZjFU5Yp4Yk46kf_BFA\" target=\"_blank\">@thevanishedillusion</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR287GpRZmmKlSGxWVhmmHg\" target=\"_blank\">@amandamartinez3568</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZCtm6R4Zodi8sl3LNKAagQ\" target=\"_blank\">@clumsy-hailles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxu-RrpX9uEo47831aqlZfg\" target=\"_blank\">@little-nonny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_q7md8mQHjx35U8_J5cScg\" target=\"_blank\">@tonystarkismyboy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgfG1wPYSeIMrz0dToJSqDg\" target=\"_blank\">@redfoxwritesstuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTBAkGECQtMeTwQAy7PObGw\" target=\"_blank\">@lowkeyofsassguard</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-XaxKkdRIJefMyg7hN4OIQ\" target=\"_blank\">@sherlocked-whovian-1969</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMG5mpATEY8-EJjQ0wseZ4A\" target=\"_blank\">@tori24rose</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\" target=\"_blank\">@a\u20131\u20131\u20133</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP15BArKOFAAVa-QPKSM7ew\" target=\"_blank\">@youclickedthislink</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WxeI_mTTHh9SJkDn9Bxfw\" target=\"_blank\">@beckastark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1c4zemabPWs4w9s6bjOEzQ\" target=\"_blank\">@confusedhada</a> <strike>@nuggeteater-dot-com </strike><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maPT8ahAbC_7OJBw9SxniaA\" target=\"_blank\">@bluehuskey2099</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIGZtAUr2XAk_fZRtL9sedg\" target=\"_blank\">@kit-kat-katie99</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\" target=\"_blank\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6ICu69iOas1vHdIkHaUDNw\" target=\"_blank\">@staringmoony</a></p><p>All the Things:\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDyLUY4sIN2n-OXTmmVEmcw\" target=\"_blank\">@swanky-batman</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcNAXgffxr0I-6d7OSQWR8A\" target=\"_blank\">@rissyrapp20</a> @<a title=\"startrekkingaroundasgard\" href=\"https://startrekkingaroundasgard.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">startrekkingaroundasgard</a> @<a href=\"http://spooookyscary.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">spooookyscary</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmOCGKNSOZQiDMSUH0Ll6A\" target=\"_blank\">@taylordrunkonwhiskey</a> @<a title=\"thewolf-and-thesheep\" href=\"https://thewolf-and-thesheep.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>thewolf-and-thesheep</b></a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq8dWkka_5TnBq7OQx8gLvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@laneygthememequeen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT7zFrL-uywQSLhCxfj5Hyw\" target=\"_blank\">@collette04</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml-MYLZoLh-1xdOkp7Rt9yw\" target=\"_blank\">@shatteredabby</a>\u00a0</p></p>",

That\u2019s not fair to him, Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dropped yours to come here for him. Shouldn\u2019t he get the same\nchoice?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>It took a while before you were convinced that Bruce wouldn\u2019t spill\nyour secret. It wasn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t want to tell Tony. You would love\nnothing more than to be with him but you didn\u2019t want him to pick you just\nbecause you were his soulmate. You wanted him to get to know you as a person\nfirst and a soulmate second. Things like that took time. </p><p>You were still deep in thought when you left Bruce\u2019s room to head back\nto your floor. </p><p>\u201cEverything sorted?\u201d </p><p>The unexpected voice startled you and you found yourself staring at Tony\nwith wide eyes. \u201cHuh?\u201d Well, that was eloquent, Y/N.</p><p>Tony straightened from where he\u2019d been leaning in the doorway of the lab.\nYou wondered briefly how long he\u2019d been standing there. His gaze darted past\nyou to Bruce\u2019s door before settling back on you. \u201cDid you get Bruce squared\naway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you answered feeling moderately guilty for misleading him. \u201cIt\u2019s\nall good.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward as his tongue darted out to moisten his lips. \u201cWhat\ndid he need anyway? You two were in there for a while.\u201d</p><p>You lifted one brow. \u201cWe got busy talking. You know how it is.\u201d</p><p>He hummed in what you assumed was agreement. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you get\nback to it.\u201d With that he turned and went back into the lab. </p><p>You stood there for a moment trying to process the strange scene you\u2019d just\nbeen part of until your phone rang. \u201cHello,\u201d you answered without paying\nattention to who was calling. </p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d came Fury\u2019s deep voice and you instantly forgot\nabout anything else. Why was the director of SHIELD calling you?</p><p>***</p><p>As soon as you were off the phone with the director, you spent the next\ntwo hours making calls, placing orders and issuing instructions. Once you were\ncertain everything you needed done would be completed by morning, you called a\nmeeting in the Avengers conference room. </p><p>As the team shuffled in, they fell quiet as they found you waiting for\nthem. Tony and Bruce were the last two to file in. Tony scowled as his gaze\nfell on you. \u201cI thought this was a team meeting. What are you doing here, hot\nstuff?\u201d</p><p>You arched a brow at the nickname. \u201cIt is a team meeting, Tony. Fury\nthought I could handle this one.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cWould you mind repeating that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sit down,\u201d you instructed the science bros. \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind\nof meeting.\u201d You passed a thin folder to everyone at the table. \u201cFury is\nexpanding the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam Wilson, the Maximoff twins, and James Barnes have all been\napproved on a probationary basis.\u201d From the corner of your eye you saw Steve\nsit straighter in his chair as a grin curled his lips. \u201cSam will maintain his own\nresidence. The twins will be on the floor below Nat and Clint and Bucky will be\non your floor, Steve.\u201d</p><p>Not everyone looked particularly thrilled with the news you were giving\nthem. \u201cThe information in the folders includes what they are required to do to\nmaintain their status on the team. Steve, Bucky requires daily therapy for the\ntime being, would you prefer I bring someone in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d he responded with no hesitation. </p><p>You shifted your attention to Tony who just frowned at the folder in\nfront of him. \u201cTony.\u201d You\u2019d said his name softly but it was enough to get his\nattention. He looked up with wide eyes. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe twins need therapy, too. Three times a week. And then there are\nthe after mission sessions. Should I see about getting one on staff?\u201d</p><p>Natasha huffed a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Fury didn\u2019t offer to move one\nin.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at that. \u201cOh, he did. I didn\u2019t think any of you would care\nfor a SHIELD shrink when we can hire our own. Then you don\u2019t have to worry\nabout them reporting back to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee. This is why I like her,\u201d Clint piped up. \u201cAlways thinking.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips twitched for a second before he gave in and smiled. \u201cHire us\na shrink, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>With Jarvis\u2019 help it didn\u2019t take you long at all to find the perfect candidate\nand he was quickly hired. Anxious to share the news with Tony you were talking before\nhe could even acknowledge your presence in the lab. You read off the man\u2019s qualifications\nand talked about his references and then realized Tony wasn\u2019t commenting on\nanything you said.</p><p>You looked up from you tablet to find him smiling as he looked between\nthe device in his hand and you. It was easy to see that you amused him. Your\nface heated. \u201cSorry, I ramble when I get excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to exploring that trait of yours in more detail later,\nbut why are you so excited about hiring a team therapist? Or should I not ask?\nIs he handsome? Are you impressed by the size of his PHD?\u201d</p><p>You blinked as your brain tried to catch up with your soulmate\u2019s\nteasing. He was certainly in a flirtatious mood. As you looked him over, you\nrealized that he had stripped down to a white tank. And coming from beneath it\nwas a bright blue glow. \u201cUm, Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>You gestured vaguely in his direction. \u201cYou\u2019re glowing.\u201d You tore your\ngaze from his chest to meet his eyes. </p><p>His brow furrowed and he glanced down. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t\nnoticed before. It keeps me alive. Keeps shrapnel from going into my heart.\u201d</p><p>That made your chest hurt. What if he wasn\u2019t a genius? Would he already\nbe dead? You sat your tablet down on the table and stepped around until you stood\nnext to Tony, his eyes following you. \u201cCan I see?\u201d </p><p>He tilted his head and studied you for a long moment and you wondered\nwhat he was thinking. Finally, he emptied his hands and turned on his stool so\nhe was facing you. In one swift movement, he took his tank off and tossed it on\nthe table beside him. \u201cLook all you want, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You closed the small distance remaining between the two of you, your\neyes glued to the device in his chest. No wonder your scar had never faded.\nThis thing had to be inserted inside of him. It was a permanent wound. You\nreached your hand out to touch it before you caught yourself. \u201cSorry,\u201d you said,\nsnatching your fingers back just before you actually made contact. </p><p>Tony\u2019s warm hand wrapped around yours and he tugged you closer. Your\nheart raced and you sucked in a deep breath as he laid your hand against his\nchest. He kept his over the top of it. \u201cIt\u2019s called an arc reactor,\u201d he\nexplained. \u201cIt not only keeps me breathing, it powers the suit.\u201d</p><p>You glanced up at the sound of his voice and swallowed past the lump in\nyour throat as you realized just how close you were to him. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHurt like hell at the time. Now, not so much.\u201d His thumb\nrubbed against the hand he was holding making a tremor shoot through you. </p><p>You reached your other hand up and traced one of the many scars that\ndecorated his skin. He hissed in a breath. Your first instinct was to apologize\nbut you resisted the urge and looked up to meet Tony\u2019s gaze. His eyes studied\nyour face as the corner of his mouth kicked up in a grin. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning\non checking out all my scars, it\u2019s going to take a while. Not that I mind. I\njust think you should be prepared.\u201d</p><p>The two of you leaned toward each other and your eyelids closed as you prepared\nfor the kiss. </p><p>\u201cMs. Potts is requesting that you meet her in your apartment, Mr. Stark.\u201d\nJarvis\u2019 voice cut through the silence in the room and you took a giant step\naway from Tony as you were reminded of his girlfriend.</p><p>Your face was warm and you suddenly found yourself unable to meet his\ngaze. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Jarvis. Impeccable timing,\u201d Tony bit out.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d</p><p> You couldn\u2019t keep yourself from glancing\nup. Tony gave you a smile as he put his shirt back on. His eyes stayed locked\non yours as he gave instructions to the AI. \u201cTell Pepper I\u2019ll meet her in her\noffice.\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward you, stopping when you took a step back to maintain\nthe distance. He held up his hands and leaned against the table behind him so\nyou knew he was giving you the space you needed right now. \u201cPepper is not my\ngirlfriend.\u201d</p><p>You bit your lip. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is.\u201d</p><p>You glanced down briefly before looking back up. \u201cThen does she know\nshe\u2019s not your girlfriend? Because I\u2019m not so sure she does.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes studied you but he said nothing. </p><p>You cleared your throat and gestured toward the door. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cJust remember, sweetheart, we\u2019re not even close to\ndone here.\u201d</p><p>Battle Scars:\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1EOTv7fAZM4h0FKEkehyw\" target=\"_blank\">@i-dontwikeit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m76mRZjFU5Yp4Yk46kf_BFA\" target=\"_blank\">@thevanishedillusion</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR287GpRZmmKlSGxWVhmmHg\" target=\"_blank\">@amandamartinez3568</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZCtm6R4Zodi8sl3LNKAagQ\" target=\"_blank\">@clumsy-hailles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxu-RrpX9uEo47831aqlZfg\" target=\"_blank\">@little-nonny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_q7md8mQHjx35U8_J5cScg\" target=\"_blank\">@tonystarkismyboy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgfG1wPYSeIMrz0dToJSqDg\" target=\"_blank\">@redfoxwritesstuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTBAkGECQtMeTwQAy7PObGw\" target=\"_blank\">@lowkeyofsassguard</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-XaxKkdRIJefMyg7hN4OIQ\" target=\"_blank\">@sherlocked-whovian-1969</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMG5mpATEY8-EJjQ0wseZ4A\" target=\"_blank\">@tori24rose</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\" target=\"_blank\">@a\u20131\u20131\u20133</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP15BArKOFAAVa-QPKSM7ew\" target=\"_blank\">@youclickedthislink</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WxeI_mTTHh9SJkDn9Bxfw\" target=\"_blank\">@beckastark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1c4zemabPWs4w9s6bjOEzQ\" target=\"_blank\">@confusedhada</a> <strike>@nuggeteater-dot-com </strike><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maPT8ahAbC_7OJBw9SxniaA\" target=\"_blank\">@bluehuskey2099</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIGZtAUr2XAk_fZRtL9sedg\" target=\"_blank\">@kit-kat-katie99</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\" target=\"_blank\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6ICu69iOas1vHdIkHaUDNw\" target=\"_blank\">@staringmoony</a></p><p>All the Things:\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDyLUY4sIN2n-OXTmmVEmcw\" target=\"_blank\">@swanky-batman</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcNAXgffxr0I-6d7OSQWR8A\" target=\"_blank\">@rissyrapp20</a> @<a title=\"startrekkingaroundasgard\" href=\"https://startrekkingaroundasgard.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">startrekkingaroundasgard</a> @<a href=\"http://spooookyscary.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">spooookyscary</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmOCGKNSOZQiDMSUH0Ll6A\" target=\"_blank\">@taylordrunkonwhiskey</a> @<a title=\"thewolf-and-thesheep\" href=\"https://thewolf-and-thesheep.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>thewolf-and-thesheep</b></a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq8dWkka_5TnBq7OQx8gLvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@laneygthememequeen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT7zFrL-uywQSLhCxfj5Hyw\" target=\"_blank\">@collette04</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml-MYLZoLh-1xdOkp7Rt9yw\" target=\"_blank\">@shatteredabby</a>\u00a0</p></p>",

Don&rsquo;t even remember how I got it now.&rdquo;</p><p>He arched his brows and gave you a look that said he didn&rsquo;t believe a\nword you were saying. &ldquo;You did not have that scar yesterday. Or even today when\nyou handed Tony his coffee. Don&rsquo;t bullshit me, Y/N. I&rsquo;m more observant than\nmost people give me credit for.&rdquo; He slid off his glasses and tossed them onto a\nnearby table before crossing his arms over his chest. His gaze never wavered\nfrom you as he waited for you to speak.</p><p>Finally, you sighed and paced away from him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to\nbullshit you, Bruce. I just wasn&rsquo;t intending on telling anyone. Not for a\nwhile, at least.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, you <i>are</i> Tony&rsquo;s soulmate\nthen?&rdquo; He dropped his arms and took a step toward you.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly unable to speak, you nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. And you&rsquo;ve known since?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After he was missing. He was doing a press conference and I saw him on\nthe television. Our bruises matched.&rdquo;</p><p>He raked a hand through his already messy hair and huffed out a breath.\n&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t told him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think, Bruce?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right, all right.&rdquo; He gestured toward one of the chairs at his\nsmall kitchen table. You sat and he took the one across from you. &ldquo;Are you\nplanning to tell him?&rdquo;</p><p>You debated for a moment whether to even the continue the conversation\nbefore deciding it was too much of a relief to have someone to talk to for you\nto stop now. If things got back to Tony, you&rsquo;d just have to deal with it then.\n&ldquo;That was my intention when I came here. I tried to get through to him by phone\nand I couldn&rsquo;t so I just showed up. They assumed I was here for a job interview\nand here we are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you mentioned you were his soulmate when you tried to\ncall?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like anyone would have believed me if I had. Besides, that&rsquo;s\nthe kind of news you need to deliver yourself don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; You leaned back\nin your seat. </p><p>He ran his fingers across the surface of the table as he thought. &ldquo;All\nof that aside, why haven&rsquo;t you told him since then? You&rsquo;ve had time. He&rsquo;s been\nlooking for you for a long time.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing that Tony had wanted to find you made your heart a little\nlighter. It also made you feel a little guilty. &ldquo;He has a girlfriend, Bruce.\nI&rsquo;m not going to be what breaks them up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who? Pepper?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He grimaced. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not really his girlfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>You pursed your lips thinking over everything you had seen the last few\nweeks. &ldquo;Are they dating?&rdquo;</p><p>He tilted his head from side to side. &ldquo;Well, I mean, technically&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>You held up a hand to cut him off. &ldquo;Technically is enough of a\nrelationship for me. I&rsquo;ll tell him when the time is right. This isn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that it isn&rsquo;t? I won&rsquo;t tell him if you don&rsquo;t want me\nto, but you should. And the sooner the better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;m not going to let him drop his entire life because\nof me.

Impeccable timing,&rdquo; Tony bit out.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, sir.&rdquo;</p><p> You couldn&rsquo;t keep yourself from glancing\nup. Tony gave you a smile as he put his shirt back on.

He held up his hands and leaned against the table behind him so\nyou knew he was giving you the space you needed right now. &ldquo;Pepper is not my\ngirlfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>You bit your lip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really my business.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it is.&rdquo;</p><p>You glanced down briefly before looking back up. &ldquo;Then does she know\nshe&rsquo;s not your girlfriend? Because I&rsquo;m not so sure she does.&rdquo;</p><p>His dark eyes studied you but he said nothing. </p><p>You cleared your throat and gestured toward the door. &ldquo;I should go.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded once. &ldquo;Just remember, sweetheart, we&rsquo;re not even close to\ndone here.&rdquo;</p><p>Battle Scars:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1EOTv7fAZM4h0FKEkehyw\" target=\"_blank\">@i-dontwikeit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m76mRZjFU5Yp4Yk46kf_BFA\" target=\"_blank\">@thevanishedillusion</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR287GpRZmmKlSGxWVhmmHg\" target=\"_blank\">@amandamartinez3568</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZCtm6R4Zodi8sl3LNKAagQ\" target=\"_blank\">@clumsy-hailles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxu-RrpX9uEo47831aqlZfg\" target=\"_blank\">@little-nonny</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_q7md8mQHjx35U8_J5cScg\" target=\"_blank\">@tonystarkismyboy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgfG1wPYSeIMrz0dToJSqDg\" target=\"_blank\">@redfoxwritesstuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTBAkGECQtMeTwQAy7PObGw\" target=\"_blank\">@lowkeyofsassguard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-XaxKkdRIJefMyg7hN4OIQ\" target=\"_blank\">@sherlocked-whovian-1969</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMG5mpATEY8-EJjQ0wseZ4A\" target=\"_blank\">@tori24rose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\" target=\"_blank\">@a&ndash;1&ndash;1&ndash;3</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP15BArKOFAAVa-QPKSM7ew\" target=\"_blank\">@youclickedthislink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WxeI_mTTHh9SJkDn9Bxfw\" target=\"_blank\">@beckastark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1c4zemabPWs4w9s6bjOEzQ\" target=\"_blank\">@confusedhada</a> <strike>@nuggeteater-dot-com </strike><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maPT8ahAbC_7OJBw9SxniaA\" target=\"_blank\">@bluehuskey2099</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIGZtAUr2XAk_fZRtL9sedg\" target=\"_blank\">@kit-kat-katie99</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\" target=\"_blank\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6ICu69iOas1vHdIkHaUDNw\" target=\"_blank\">@staringmoony</a></p><p>All the Things:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDyLUY4sIN2n-OXTmmVEmcw\" target=\"_blank\">@swanky-batman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcNAXgffxr0I-6d7OSQWR8A\" target=\"_blank\">@rissyrapp20</a> @<a title=\"startrekkingaroundasgard\" href=\"https://startrekkingaroundasgard.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">startrekkingaroundasgard</a> @<a href=\"http://spooookyscary.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">spooookyscary</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWmOCGKNSOZQiDMSUH0Ll6A\" target=\"_blank\">@taylordrunkonwhiskey</a> @<a title=\"thewolf-and-thesheep\" href=\"https://thewolf-and-thesheep.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>thewolf-and-thesheep</b></a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq8dWkka_5TnBq7OQx8gLvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@laneygthememequeen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT7zFrL-uywQSLhCxfj5Hyw\" target=\"_blank\">@collette04</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml-MYLZoLh-1xdOkp7Rt9yw\" target=\"_blank\">@shatteredabby</a>&nbsp;</p></p>",
