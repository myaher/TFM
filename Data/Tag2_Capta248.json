For once. She stuck out her tongue at him and then laid her head on Bucky\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>Steve and Carol laughed from where they were sitting on the other side of the couch. Tony didn\u2019t join in because that would ruin his perfectly constructed plan of pretending this relationship didn\u2019t exist. He\u2019d gotten really good at that particular trait over the years, and as far as Willow was concerned everything was perfect since he was done being outright hostile.\u00a0</p><p>Willow wasn\u2019t sure how long Happy had been asleep though, but Peter seemed to have a pretty good idea. He was throwing popcorn in the direction of his open mouth, but missing gloriously every time. There were several pieces scattered over his shirt and on the chair he was sitting in.\u00a0</p><p>She laughed quietly to herself taking in the scene around her, content for the first time in weeks. There were still plenty of people missing, but she could see the end of the tunnel now.\u00a0</p><p>Nathaniel started to fuss and Willow jumped up to get him, like she always did when she was in the room. She swatted Clint\u2019s hand away and he pretended to be hurt as she made her way to the rollaway crib that was always in the room.\u00a0</p><p>She propped him up on her hip, the place he seemed to fit perfectly, and walked around the room. She was bouncing along as she went, just like he was used to, his head against her chest in no time. His little fist was closed around the necklace she\u2019d gotten from Tony when they were teenagers. She couldn\u2019t remember a time she\u2019d ever taken it off.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky let his head roll back to look at them after a second or two, smirking at her and holding out her hands for the baby. She swatted him away too before motioning for him to turn around and watch the movie. He pouted for a second before giving in, letting his hand linger on the couch where he could still be touching her in some small way.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zs2CmSS1vyy383_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\"/></figure><p>Bucky licked his lips as he looked around the chess board for his next move. Willow was leaned back in her chair, looking rather pleased with herself and that always made him nervous. She didn\u2019t have a poker face at all, so if she looked happy it was because she was about to win.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone had gathered around them slowly, to watch the massacre. The worst of this being that Bucky had <i>just</i> introduced her to Dunsany\u2019s version of chess about a week ago and now she was regularly kicking his ass.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d she whispered in a dreamy tone.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall for it, Buck. She\u2019s trying to distract you,\u201d Steve coached.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He moved one piece and then sat back too, watching in awe as her slender fingers picked up one tiny piece and destroyed his whole strategy. He groaned loudly and covered his face.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d<br/></p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her. She knew exactly what he was talking about and how many things he could be referring to with that one comment. She was also answering each one. Willow knew how to push his button. Each of them. God, he was in so much trouble</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our cue,\u201d Sam said, darting out of the room.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He was probably right. It wouldn&rsquo;t be too long before he threw the board across the room and got into another epic tickle fight with her. Sam always made it sexual, but it wasn\u2019t like that with them. Somehow, though, it was more intimate. He knew her better without the sex. He loved her without it. Not that he\u2019d say no.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zscArEO1vyy383_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\"/></figure><p>\u201cDid&hellip; did you, uh, do the laundry?\u201d Willow stuttered.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered before wrapping his arms around her from behind.\u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw my underwear.\u201d<br/></p><p>She could feel the heat creep up her neck as he laid his head on her shoulder and started to laugh loudly.\u00a0\u201cSo&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I don\u2019t know. I just&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou have nice underwear,\u201d he interrupted.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Now her whole body was red. He had seen her underwear and he thought it was nice. Did that mean he wanted to see more of her underwear? Did that mean he wanted to see her without it? Why was she having this conversation with herself? They didn\u2019t have a sexual relationship, and probably never would. It was better this way. She couldn\u2019t get hurt if she didn\u2019t fall in love with him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYea&ndash;yeah.

It did just as he kissed her cheek and pulled her onto his chest before reaching over to turn off the light.

Something he did quite frequently now that he was in Willow\u2019s life. She seemed to make unilateral decisions about both of their futures all the time. He hated how wrapped up in her he was. He hated losing control to anyone and it\u2019d been so effortless with them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming back,\u201d Wong announced suddenly.\u00a0\u201cAny moment.

She brought them back. He looked over at Wong and saw something strange flash across the other man\u2019s face. It was like he was angry, but Bucky couldn\u2019t tell at who it was directed. He didn\u2019t have time to process that either as they filed in. Willow wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Wong asked.\u00a0<br/></p><p>She nodded.\u00a0\u201cJust gonna go wake up Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Howard asked, stopping her as she walked past them.\u00a0\u201cHow long have we been gone?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m&hellip; 45,\u201d she said slowly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTony is 47?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look any older,\u201d Maria whispered as Willow hurried away.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t know what to do, stuck in a room with the two people he\u2019d killed in another time line.

She also explained the situation.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes grew large. Maybe she hadn\u2019t told it right. There was just no possible explanation for Howard Stark calming discussing his own death.\u00a0</p><p>He rubbed his finger over his bottom lip a couple of times as he thought of the least rude way to escape this incredibly awkward situation.

For once. She stuck out her tongue at him and then laid her head on Bucky\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>Steve and Carol laughed from where they were sitting on the other side of the couch. Tony didn\u2019t join in because that would ruin his perfectly constructed plan of pretending this relationship didn\u2019t exist. He\u2019d gotten really good at that particular trait over the years, and as far as Willow was concerned everything was perfect since he was done being outright hostile.\u00a0</p><p>Willow wasn\u2019t sure how long Happy had been asleep though, but Peter seemed to have a pretty good idea. He was throwing popcorn in the direction of his open mouth, but missing gloriously every time. There were several pieces scattered over his shirt and on the chair he was sitting in.\u00a0</p><p>She laughed quietly to herself taking in the scene around her, content for the first time in weeks. There were still plenty of people missing, but she could see the end of the tunnel now.\u00a0</p><p>Nathaniel started to fuss and Willow jumped up to get him, like she always did when she was in the room. She swatted Clint\u2019s hand away and he pretended to be hurt as she made her way to the rollaway crib that was always in the room.\u00a0</p><p>She propped him up on her hip, the place he seemed to fit perfectly, and walked around the room. She was bouncing along as she went, just like he was used to, his head against her chest in no time. His little fist was closed around the necklace she\u2019d gotten from Tony when they were teenagers. She couldn\u2019t remember a time she\u2019d ever taken it off.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky let his head roll back to look at them after a second or two, smirking at her and holding out her hands for the baby. She swatted him away too before motioning for him to turn around and watch the movie. He pouted for a second before giving in, letting his hand linger on the couch where he could still be touching her in some small way.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zs2CmSS1vyy383_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>Bucky licked his lips as he looked around the chess board for his next move. Willow was leaned back in her chair, looking rather pleased with herself and that always made him nervous. She didn\u2019t have a poker face at all, so if she looked happy it was because she was about to win.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone had gathered around them slowly, to watch the massacre. The worst of this being that Bucky had <i>just</i> introduced her to Dunsany\u2019s version of chess about a week ago and now she was regularly kicking his ass.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d she whispered in a dreamy tone.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall for it, Buck. She\u2019s trying to distract you,\u201d Steve coached.\u00a0<br></p><p>He moved one piece and then sat back too, watching in awe as her slender fingers picked up one tiny piece and destroyed his whole strategy. He groaned loudly and covered his face.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d<br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her. She knew exactly what he was talking about and how many things he could be referring to with that one comment. She was also answering each one. Willow knew how to push his button. Each of them. God, he was in so much trouble</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our cue,\u201d Sam said, darting out of the room.\u00a0<br></p><p>He was probably right. It wouldn\u2019t be too long before he threw the board across the room and got into another epic tickle fight with her. Sam always made it sexual, but it wasn\u2019t like that with them. Somehow, though, it was more intimate. He knew her better without the sex. He loved her without it. Not that he\u2019d say no.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zscArEO1vyy383_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>\u201cDid\u2026 did you, uh, do the laundry?\u201d Willow stuttered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered before wrapping his arms around her from behind.\u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw my underwear.\u201d<br></p><p>She could feel the heat creep up her neck as he laid his head on her shoulder and started to laugh loudly.\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I don\u2019t know. I just\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou have nice underwear,\u201d he interrupted.\u00a0<br></p><p>Now her whole body was red. He had seen her underwear and he thought it was nice. Did that mean he wanted to see more of her underwear? Did that mean he wanted to see her without it? Why was she having this conversation with herself? They didn\u2019t have a sexual relationship, and probably never would. It was better this way. She couldn\u2019t get hurt if she didn\u2019t fall in love with him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYea\u2013yeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d he teased.\u00a0\u201cCome to bed so we can talk more about your underwear.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh my God, stop.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He laughed louder, clutching his chest.\u00a0\u201cYou should see your face.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the nearest pillow and threw it at him, hitting him square in the face.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop laughing as he pulled her down to the bed with him, or when he pulled her hands away from her face. It did just as he kissed her cheek and pulled her onto his chest before reaching over to turn off the light. She worked on calming down as they fell asleep.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zsnpVCr1vyy383_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>\u201cWillow?\u201d<br></p><p>Her spot was cold again.

For once. She stuck out her tongue at him and then laid her head on Bucky\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>Steve and Carol laughed from where they were sitting on the other side of the couch. Tony didn\u2019t join in because that would ruin his perfectly constructed plan of pretending this relationship didn\u2019t exist. He\u2019d gotten really good at that particular trait over the years, and as far as Willow was concerned everything was perfect since he was done being outright hostile.\u00a0</p><p>Willow wasn\u2019t sure how long Happy had been asleep though, but Peter seemed to have a pretty good idea. He was throwing popcorn in the direction of his open mouth, but missing gloriously every time. There were several pieces scattered over his shirt and on the chair he was sitting in.\u00a0</p><p>She laughed quietly to herself taking in the scene around her, content for the first time in weeks. There were still plenty of people missing, but she could see the end of the tunnel now.\u00a0</p><p>Nathaniel started to fuss and Willow jumped up to get him, like she always did when she was in the room. She swatted Clint\u2019s hand away and he pretended to be hurt as she made her way to the rollaway crib that was always in the room.\u00a0</p><p>She propped him up on her hip, the place he seemed to fit perfectly, and walked around the room. She was bouncing along as she went, just like he was used to, his head against her chest in no time. His little fist was closed around the necklace she\u2019d gotten from Tony when they were teenagers. She couldn\u2019t remember a time she\u2019d ever taken it off.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky let his head roll back to look at them after a second or two, smirking at her and holding out her hands for the baby. She swatted him away too before motioning for him to turn around and watch the movie. He pouted for a second before giving in, letting his hand linger on the couch where he could still be touching her in some small way.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zs2CmSS1vyy383_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>Bucky licked his lips as he looked around the chess board for his next move. Willow was leaned back in her chair, looking rather pleased with herself and that always made him nervous. She didn\u2019t have a poker face at all, so if she looked happy it was because she was about to win.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone had gathered around them slowly, to watch the massacre. The worst of this being that Bucky had <i>just</i> introduced her to Dunsany\u2019s version of chess about a week ago and now she was regularly kicking his ass.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d she whispered in a dreamy tone.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall for it, Buck. She\u2019s trying to distract you,\u201d Steve coached.\u00a0<br></p><p>He moved one piece and then sat back too, watching in awe as her slender fingers picked up one tiny piece and destroyed his whole strategy. He groaned loudly and covered his face.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d<br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her. She knew exactly what he was talking about and how many things he could be referring to with that one comment. She was also answering each one. Willow knew how to push his button. Each of them. God, he was in so much trouble</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our cue,\u201d Sam said, darting out of the room.\u00a0<br></p><p>He was probably right. It wouldn\u2019t be too long before he threw the board across the room and got into another epic tickle fight with her. Sam always made it sexual, but it wasn\u2019t like that with them. Somehow, though, it was more intimate. He knew her better without the sex. He loved her without it. Not that he\u2019d say no.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zscArEO1vyy383_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>\u201cDid\u2026 did you, uh, do the laundry?\u201d Willow stuttered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered before wrapping his arms around her from behind.\u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw my underwear.\u201d<br></p><p>She could feel the heat creep up her neck as he laid his head on her shoulder and started to laugh loudly.\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I don\u2019t know. I just\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou have nice underwear,\u201d he interrupted.\u00a0<br></p><p>Now her whole body was red. He had seen her underwear and he thought it was nice. Did that mean he wanted to see more of her underwear? Did that mean he wanted to see her without it? Why was she having this conversation with herself? They didn\u2019t have a sexual relationship, and probably never would. It was better this way. She couldn\u2019t get hurt if she didn\u2019t fall in love with him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYea\u2013yeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d he teased.\u00a0\u201cCome to bed so we can talk more about your underwear.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh my God, stop.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He laughed louder, clutching his chest.\u00a0\u201cYou should see your face.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the nearest pillow and threw it at him, hitting him square in the face.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop laughing as he pulled her down to the bed with him, or when he pulled her hands away from her face. It did just as he kissed her cheek and pulled her onto his chest before reaching over to turn off the light. She worked on calming down as they fell asleep.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zsnpVCr1vyy383_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"20\"></figure><p>\u201cWillow?\u201d<br></p><p>Her spot was cold again. He looked over to the left and saw she wasn\u2019t on the couch either. He furrowed his brows and sat up on his elbows to look around more fully. It was completely dark. There was no light coming from under the bathroom door either.\u00a0</p><p>He got up and poked his head out and heard nothing. No one was up. He felt around in the room for a shirt before pulling it over his head and walking out into the hallway. Willow didn\u2019t care if he was shirtless, but he was sure Sam, or even Steve, would have a comment.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky couldn\u2019t tell what time it was, but it had to be late if even Tony was asleep. He looked in his lab anyway and noticed there was one light on. Maybe he\u2019d fallen asleep in there after all. He peered around the corner, not wanting to start a fight and noticed it was Wong, not Tony. And he had the paddles in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>He opened the door slowly.\u00a0\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Barnes, how are you?\u201d he greeted, not looking up from his hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for Willow,\u201d he stated plainly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhere is she? Where\u2019d she go?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe left, Mr. Barnes. I\u2019m not sure where. Or when.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike left, left? Why? She\u2026. she told me, uh\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>He was on the verge of hyperventilating as Wong finished his sentence for him.\u00a0\u201cWas going to wait? Yes, she told me the same thing. But she left approximately 5 minutes ago.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI can feel her,\u201d he explained.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s especially powerful when she leaves her own time period. It woke me up.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d<br></p><p>He sat down hard in the nearest chair and put his head in his hands. Something he did quite frequently now that he was in Willow\u2019s life. She seemed to make unilateral decisions about both of their futures all the time. He hated how wrapped up in her he was. He hated losing control to anyone and it\u2019d been so effortless with them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming back,\u201d Wong announced suddenly.\u00a0\u201cAny moment. And she is not alone.\u201d<br></p><p>Well, at least she did what she wanted and saved someone else. He just hoped that damned dream he kept having wasn\u2019t about to come true. Wong was here, so already it was different, he reminded himself.</p><p>He could hear her laughter before he saw her. She wasn\u2019t hurt, it seemed. That was good. Maybe she didn\u2019t go far. Maybe that\u2019s what made it worse. Then he heard a man\u2019s voice next, one he thought he recognized.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>She knew he was up now and he wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHoward. Maria. Let\u2019s go talk in here. I\u2019ll wake up Tony, okay?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, dear.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky\u2019s mouth fell open. She had saved Howard and Maria Stark. She brought them back. He looked over at Wong and saw something strange flash across the other man\u2019s face. It was like he was angry, but Bucky couldn\u2019t tell at who it was directed. He didn\u2019t have time to process that either as they filed in. Willow wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Wong asked.\u00a0<br></p><p>She nodded.\u00a0\u201cJust gonna go wake up Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Howard asked, stopping her as she walked past them.\u00a0\u201cHow long have we been gone?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 45,\u201d she said slowly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTony is 47?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look any older,\u201d Maria whispered as Willow hurried away.\u00a0<br></p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t know what to do, stuck in a room with the two people he\u2019d killed in another time line. It\u2019d been violent and awful from what he remembered seeing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSergeant Barnes,\u201d Howard said jovially, noticing he was there.\u00a0\u201cHow are you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUh, good.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you,\u201d Maria offered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid, uh, Willow not tell you?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat you did?\u201d Howard asked.\u00a0\u201cYes, she did. She also explained the situation.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes grew large. Maybe she hadn\u2019t told it right.

She was bouncing along as she went, just like he was used to, his head against her chest in no time. His little fist was closed around the necklace she&rsquo;d gotten from Tony when they were teenagers. She couldn&rsquo;t remember a time she&rsquo;d ever taken it off.&nbsp;</p><p>Bucky let his head roll back to look at them after a second or two, smirking at her and holding out her hands for the baby. She swatted him away too before motioning for him to turn around and watch the movie. He pouted for a second before giving in, letting his hand linger on the couch where he could still be touching her in some small way.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zs2CmSS1vyy383_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Bucky licked his lips as he looked around the chess board for his next move. Willow was leaned back in her chair, looking rather pleased with herself and that always made him nervous. She didn&rsquo;t have a poker face at all, so if she looked happy it was because she was about to win.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone had gathered around them slowly, to watch the massacre. The worst of this being that Bucky had <i>just</i> introduced her to Dunsany&rsquo;s version of chess about a week ago and now she was regularly kicking his ass.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute,&rdquo; she whispered in a dreamy tone.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall for it, Buck. She&rsquo;s trying to distract you,&rdquo; Steve coached.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He moved one piece and then sat back too, watching in awe as her slender fingers picked up one tiny piece and destroyed his whole strategy. He groaned loudly and covered his face.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do that?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her. She knew exactly what he was talking about and how many things he could be referring to with that one comment. She was also answering each one. Willow knew how to push his button. Each of them. God, he was in so much trouble</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our cue,&rdquo; Sam said, darting out of the room.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He was probably right. It wouldn&rsquo;t be too long before he threw the board across the room and got into another epic tickle fight with her. Sam always made it sexual, but it wasn&rsquo;t like that with them. Somehow, though, it was more intimate. He knew her better without the sex. He loved her without it. Not that he&rsquo;d say no.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zscArEO1vyy383_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Did&hellip; did you, uh, do the laundry?&rdquo; Willow stuttered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he answered before wrapping his arms around her from behind.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You saw my underwear.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She could feel the heat creep up her neck as he laid his head on her shoulder and started to laugh loudly.&nbsp;&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh, I don&rsquo;t know. I just&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You have nice underwear,&rdquo; he interrupted.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Now her whole body was red. He had seen her underwear and he thought it was nice. Did that mean he wanted to see more of her underwear? Did that mean he wanted to see her without it? Why was she having this conversation with herself? They didn&rsquo;t have a sexual relationship, and probably never would. It was better this way. She couldn&rsquo;t get hurt if she didn&rsquo;t fall in love with him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yea&ndash;yeah. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Liar,&rdquo; he teased.&nbsp;&ldquo;Come to bed so we can talk more about your underwear.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God, stop.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He laughed louder, clutching his chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;You should see your face.&rdquo;</p><p>She picked up the nearest pillow and threw it at him, hitting him square in the face.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the worst.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t stop laughing as he pulled her down to the bed with him, or when he pulled her hands away from her face. It did just as he kissed her cheek and pulled her onto his chest before reaching over to turn off the light. She worked on calming down as they fell asleep.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ff2821a9e5c41530b2693391fb521b2/tumblr_inline_ph3zsnpVCr1vyy383_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Willow?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Her spot was cold again. He looked over to the left and saw she wasn&rsquo;t on the couch either. He furrowed his brows and sat up on his elbows to look around more fully. It was completely dark. There was no light coming from under the bathroom door either.&nbsp;</p><p>He got up and poked his head out and heard nothing. No one was up. He felt around in the room for a shirt before pulling it over his head and walking out into the hallway. Willow didn&rsquo;t care if he was shirtless, but he was sure Sam, or even Steve, would have a comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Bucky couldn&rsquo;t tell what time it was, but it had to be late if even Tony was asleep. He looked in his lab anyway and noticed there was one light on. Maybe he&rsquo;d fallen asleep in there after all. He peered around the corner, not wanting to start a fight and noticed it was Wong, not Tony. And he had the paddles in his hands.&nbsp;</p><p>He opened the door slowly.&nbsp;&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Barnes, how are you?&rdquo; he greeted, not looking up from his hands.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for Willow,&rdquo; he stated plainly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where is she? Where&rsquo;d she go?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She left, Mr. Barnes. I&rsquo;m not sure where. Or when.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like left, left? Why? She&hellip;. she told me, uh&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He was on the verge of hyperventilating as Wong finished his sentence for him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Was going to wait? Yes, she told me the same thing. But she left approximately 5 minutes ago.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can feel her,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s especially powerful when she leaves her own time period. It woke me up.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gotcha.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He sat down hard in the nearest chair and put his head in his hands. Something he did quite frequently now that he was in Willow&rsquo;s life. She seemed to make unilateral decisions about both of their futures all the time. He hated how wrapped up in her he was. He hated losing control to anyone and it&rsquo;d been so effortless with them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming back,&rdquo; Wong announced suddenly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Any moment. And she is not alone.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Well, at least she did what she wanted and saved someone else. He just hoped that damned dream he kept having wasn&rsquo;t about to come true. Wong was here, so already it was different, he reminded himself.</p><p>He could hear her laughter before he saw her. She wasn&rsquo;t hurt, it seemed. That was good. Maybe she didn&rsquo;t go far. Maybe that&rsquo;s what made it worse. Then he heard a man&rsquo;s voice next, one he thought he recognized.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>She knew he was up now and he wouldn&rsquo;t be happy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Howard. Maria. Let&rsquo;s go talk in here. I&rsquo;ll wake up Tony, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, dear.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s mouth fell open. She had saved Howard and Maria Stark. She brought them back. He looked over at Wong and saw something strange flash across the other man&rsquo;s face. It was like he was angry, but Bucky couldn&rsquo;t tell at who it was directed. He didn&rsquo;t have time to process that either as they filed in. Willow wouldn&rsquo;t meet his eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Wong asked.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>She nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just gonna go wake up Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo; Howard asked, stopping her as she walked past them.&nbsp;&ldquo;How long have we been gone?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; 45,&rdquo; she said slowly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tony is 47?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t look any older,&rdquo; Maria whispered as Willow hurried away.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Bucky didn&rsquo;t know what to do, stuck in a room with the two people he&rsquo;d killed in another time line. It&rsquo;d been violent and awful from what he remembered seeing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sergeant Barnes,&rdquo; Howard said jovially, noticing he was there.&nbsp;&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, good.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to finally meet you,&rdquo; Maria offered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did, uh, Willow not tell you?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What you did?&rdquo; Howard asked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, she did. She also explained the situation.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s eyes grew large. Maybe she hadn&rsquo;t told it right. There was just no possible explanation for Howard Stark calming discussing his own death.&nbsp;</p><p>He rubbed his finger over his bottom lip a couple of times as he thought of the least rude way to escape this incredibly awkward situation. Then he could hear Tony running toward them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; he shrieked when he saw her.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He barreled through the glass doors quickly and found himself in front of his mom after years apart. He couldn&rsquo;t wipe the smile off his own face as she took stock of the much older Tony than the one she&rsquo;d just seen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Look at your face&ndash;wait, what is this?&rdquo; she asked, noticing the glowing shape underneath his shirt.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not important, Ma.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Willow told us a bit, but I still don&rsquo;t feel like I know what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sit down. I&rsquo;ll tell you everything, but first. Mom, Dad, this is Pepper Potts.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>xoxo,&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>GalaxyCollector</i></p><p><i>for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfmQjfrlffupqTQYorYkmIw\">@jayded-dreams</a></i></p></p>",
