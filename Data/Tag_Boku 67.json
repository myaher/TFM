Out in the world showing his talents. Of course you couldn\u2019t say anything. No, you wanted him to pursue his dreams and that\u2019s what he was doing. However you didn\u2019t suspect it to hurt this bad. </p><p>The nights you spend alone without him. The days you spend waiting for him to call and yet you were left with nothing. Though when you saw him on tv you couldn\u2019t help but smile; he was happy with his fans. So why was it that you felt at fault for this?</p><p>Maybe you were the one being too clingy? Maybe you should\u2019ve never admitted your feelings to him before his big concert. The one thing that made him go so viral and big. </p><p><i><b>\u2018There&rsquo;s only so many songs, that I can sing to pass the time</b></i></p><p><i><b>And I&rsquo;m running out of things to do, to get you off my mind (Oh ohh)\u2019</b></i></p><p>Kirishima sighed another concert done and over with and he couldn\u2019t be happier with that. He had to admit this tour was kicking his ass and he\u2019s doesn\u2019t know if he could sing another song from the heart anymore. Not with all these screaming fans of his and the backstage parties. </p><p>At first he wouldn\u2019t mind it in fact he enjoyed them for awhile but day after day of constant drinking then singing then traveling. Kirishima wanted to throw up and head home. </p><p>\u201cHey Kirishima my bro we\u2019re all going to Ultra Plus for some drinks get your ass ready!!!\u201d </p><p>Kirishima groaned and placed his guitar down before flopping down on the leather sofa. He was going absolutely insane with this and if he had to hear his manger say that they\u2019re \u201ctaking a detour\u201d one more time he swears he might actually commit murder. </p><p>Placing his elbows on his knees he sighed and took the cold beer on the table that was placed by someone. Taking a swing of the alcohol he sighed and dropped his head. He missed you so much that it hurt for him</p><p><i><b>\u2018This long distance is killing me</b></i></p><p><i><b>It&rsquo;s so hard, it&rsquo;s so hard</b></i></p><p><i><b>Where we are, where we are</b></i></p><p><i><b>You&rsquo;re so far, this long distance is killing me\u2019</b></i></p><p>You whimpered at the cold bed you were laying on. The smell of him didn\u2019t provide as much comfort anymore. You need his warm no, better yet you need him home. You needed him to whisper sweet nothings in your ear. You needed him to hold you and make you forget all the stress from the world. You needed him to take you and make love to you in every part he could. You just needed him. </p><p>Rolling over you faced the empty bed that was called his and you grabbed his pillow and inhaled the scent one more time. It wasn\u2019t as comforting but it was still there to remind you that you were his. Then you saw it. </p><p>It was an old picture of you both sharing a kiss at one of his concerts. It was the first time he announced you as his girlfriend to the public. You loved it and you heard the crowd scream and cheer for their favorite redhead singer. You never forgot that day. </p><p><i><b>\u2018All I have is this picture in a frame</b></i></p><p><i><b>That I hold close, to see your face again (Ohh!)\u2019</b></i></p><p>\u201cHey man great concert!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOmg it\u2019s him Red Riot.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey looks here the big man made it!!\u201d </p><p>Kirishima felt a hand smack his back hard and he jumped turning his head to meet the yellow hair bass player. </p><p>\u201cH-hey man.\u201d Kirishima said and the yellow hair laughed with a beer in his hand. He looked like he was about to be shit faced drunk. </p><p>\u201cMan we rooooocked it tonight!!! I never heard so many girls scream my name until now.\u201d He sighed and Kirishima laughed and kaminari smiled before he gasped and stood up but with his drunken state he almost fell over and Kirishima was there to catch him. </p><p>\u201cBlasty!!!!! Heeeyyy man check out those ladies?\u201d He slurred and the spiked hair man rolled his eyes. </p><p>\u201cYeah and I told them to fuck off.\u201d He said making kaminari whined. </p><p>\u201cMan you\u2019re never gonna get a lady if you keep pushing them away!!\u201d He said then patted Kirishima\u2019s shoulder \u201cLike this man!!! He\u2019s got one hottie under his belt!!\u201d He howled and Kirishima growled. </p><p>\u201cHaha yeah Y/n is definitely something\u2026\u201d he said lowly and looked down. The two seemed to notice the behavior of the red head. The ash blonde sighed</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>Kirishima sighed and nodded \u201c&hellip;yeah. I just I can\u2019t keep doing this to her. I love you guy and all but I need to be with her.\u201d He said and Bakugo smirked \u201cSo you think it\u2019s time?\u201d He said and Kirishima stopped a vision came to his eyes and he saw you. Your beautiful smile and your hair oh how he loved your hair. He saw you running up to him and him catching you but what caught his attention was that you weren\u2019t alone, no you had two kids following you that looked so much like you. They looked beautiful and he caugh eye of a boy with his teeth. </p><p>Kirishima smiled and nodded </p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s time.\u201d </p><p><i><b>\u2018Can you hear me cryin&rsquo;? (Ohhh!)</b></i></p><p><i><b>Can you hear me cryin&rsquo;? (Ohhh!)&hellip;</b></i></p><p><i><b>Can you hear me cryin&rsquo;? (Ohhhhh!)\u2019</b></i></p><p>\u201cAnd just in Red Riot is back for another interview and what he says is shocking to everyone!!!\u2019 </p><p>You sat there watching the tv intensely. Bakugo texted you saying to turn on the t.v. and you tried to ask him what\u2019s wrong but he just said to turn on the tv and watch. </p><p>So here you were. Watching and listening as your boyfriend made it up to the small stage used for questioning. </p><p>As you saw him enter the room you saw all the reporters and photographers stand up and ask him questions, too many for you to comprehend what they were saying. </p><p>Finally it was quite and you saw Kirishima raise his hands and everything was stop to a halt. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d He spoke and you held your breath \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this but the tour too the UK will be canceled.\u201d You gasped so did everyone else before you heard them break out into questions and shouting. Kirishima kept his glasses on and he pointed to a random reporter in the room and the crowd went silent waiting to get an answer from him. </p><p>\u201cMr. Riot why are you canceling the biggest part of your career? Could you be tired of your band?\u201d </p><p>Kirishima sighed and bit his lip and you did the same holding your arms close to yourself. </p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m not tired of the band. They\u2019re my family, but recently I\u2019ve been missing a bigger part of my family.\u201d He spoke and the reporters burst out into question again and he picked another. </p><p>\u201cMr. Riot why cancel your entire big tour around the world for this single family member?\u201d </p><p>You gasp, how could he do something like this? He worked so hard for this tour, but you wanted to know who he was talking about. Maybe his mother was sick, you knew she had poor health but she was a strong fighter. So who was he coming home too?</p><p><i><b>\u2018This long distance is killing me</b></i></p><p><i><b>I wish that you were here with me</b></i></p><p><i><b>But we&rsquo;re stuck where we are</b></i></p><p><i><b>And it&rsquo;s so hard, you&rsquo;re so fary\u2019</b></i></p><p>Kirishima clenched his jaw. The question we\u2019re getting too much.</p><p>\u201cMr. Riot who is this family?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre they forcing you!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you leave your career for that one person!?!?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho are they!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being blackmailed by your girlfriend aren\u2019t you!?!\u201d </p><p>Blackmail? Blackmail!! Good god no that was far from the truth. Now everyone is gonna think otherwise. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He said firmly and he took off his glasses showing the furry in his eye, how dare they! How dare they make you the villain of something you supported as much as he does. </p><p>\u201cThe reason why I\u2019m canceling is because I\u2019m planning on making the biggest decision of my life. So big that no song or your can come even close to it.\u201d He said firmly and everyone waited for his answer. Kirishima sighed and looked at the reporters</p><p>\u201cI love my career I really do, but\u2026..I\u2019ve had a vision.\u201d He said and looked down \u201cA vision of my future and where I want to be.\u201d </p><p>Everyone bursted out again, asking him to spill the vision and tell them everything. Kirishima bit his lip he was more nervous than ever. He raised his hand and silence was spread through the room. </p><p>\u201cM-My vision is with my rock Y/n. I saw it clear as day. I want to be by her side as much as she was with mine. So I\u2019m asking this question now and only to her.\u201d He spoke and he walked down the stage and went in front of a camera. </p><p>\u201cY/n god you been there for me so many times and I Love you everyday we been on our big tour but I\u2019m done. I\u2019m tired of staying away from you and I want you here with me. Not as boyfriend and girlfriend but\u2026.a-as husband and wife.\u201d He said and he heard most of the reporters gasped and he pulled out the ring he kept in his pockets. </p><p>He always had it with him waiting to get the balls to ask you the question and now was the time. </p><p>\u201cY/n will you marry me?\u201d </p>",

It wasn\u2019t as comforting but it was still there to remind you that you were his. Then you saw it. </p><p>It was an old picture of you both sharing a kiss at one of his concerts. It was the first time he announced you as his girlfriend to the public. You loved it and you heard the crowd scream and cheer for their favorite redhead singer. You never forgot that day. </p><p><i><b>\u2018All I have is this picture in a frame</b></i></p><p><i><b>That I hold close, to see your face again (Ohh!)\u2019</b></i></p><p>\u201cHey man great concert!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOmg it\u2019s him Red Riot.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey looks here the big man made it!!\u201d </p><p>Kirishima felt a hand smack his back hard and he jumped turning his head to meet the yellow hair bass player. </p><p>\u201cH-hey man.\u201d Kirishima said and the yellow hair laughed with a beer in his hand. He looked like he was about to be shit faced drunk. </p><p>\u201cMan we rooooocked it tonight!!! I never heard so many girls scream my name until now.\u201d He sighed and Kirishima laughed and kaminari smiled before he gasped and stood up but with his drunken state he almost fell over and Kirishima was there to catch him. </p><p>\u201cBlasty!!!!!

Your beautiful smile and your hair oh how he loved your hair. He saw you running up to him and him catching you but what caught his attention was that you weren\u2019t alone, no you had two kids following you that looked so much like you.

Bakugo texted you saying to turn on the t.v. and you tried to ask him what\u2019s wrong but he just said to turn on the tv and watch. </p><p>So here you were. Watching and listening as your boyfriend made it up to the small stage used for questioning. </p><p>As you saw him enter the room you saw all the reporters and photographers stand up and ask him questions, too many for you to comprehend what they were saying. </p><p>Finally it was quite and you saw Kirishima raise his hands and everything was stop to a halt. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d He spoke and you held your breath \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this but the tour too the UK will be canceled.\u201d You gasped so did everyone else before you heard them break out into questions and shouting. Kirishima kept his glasses on and he pointed to a random reporter in the room and the crowd went silent waiting to get an answer from him. </p><p>\u201cMr. Riot why are you canceling the biggest part of your career? Could you be tired of your band?\u201d </p><p>Kirishima sighed and bit his lip and you did the same holding your arms close to yourself. </p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m not tired of the band. They\u2019re my family, but recently I\u2019ve been missing a bigger part of my family.\u201d He spoke and the reporters burst out into question again and he picked another. </p><p>\u201cMr. Riot why cancel your entire big tour around the world for this single family member?\u201d </p><p>You gasp, how could he do something like this? He worked so hard for this tour, but you wanted to know who he was talking about. Maybe his mother was sick, you knew she had poor health but she was a strong fighter. So who was he coming home too?</p><p><i><b>\u2018This long distance is killing me</b></i></p><p><i><b>I wish that you were here with me</b></i></p><p><i><b>But we\u2019re stuck where we are</b></i></p><p><i><b>And it\u2019s so hard, you\u2019re so fary\u2019</b></i></p><p>Kirishima clenched his jaw.

Blackmail!! Good god no that was far from the truth. Now everyone is gonna think otherwise. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He said firmly and he took off his glasses showing the furry in his eye, how dare they! How dare they make you the villain of something you supported as much as he does. </p><p>\u201cThe reason why I\u2019m canceling is because I\u2019m planning on making the biggest decision of my life. So big that no song or your can come even close to it.\u201d He said firmly and everyone waited for his answer. Kirishima sighed and looked at the reporters</p><p>\u201cI love my career I really do, but\u2026..I\u2019ve had a vision.\u201d He said and looked down \u201cA vision of my future and where I want to be.\u201d </p><p>Everyone bursted out again, asking him to spill the vision and tell them everything. Kirishima bit his lip he was more nervous than ever. He raised his hand and silence was spread through the room. </p><p>\u201cM-My vision is with my rock Y/n. I saw it clear as day. I want to be by her side as much as she was with mine. So I\u2019m asking this question now and only to her.\u201d He spoke and he walked down the stage and went in front of a camera. </p><p>\u201cY/n god you been there for me so many times and I Love you everyday we been on our big tour but I\u2019m done. I\u2019m tired of staying away from you and I want you here with me. Not as boyfriend and girlfriend but\u2026.a-as husband and wife.\u201d He said and he heard most of the reporters gasped and he pulled out the ring he kept in his pockets. </p><p>He always had it with him waiting to get the balls to ask you the question and now was the time. </p><p>\u201cY/n will you marry me?\u201d </p></p>",

Out in the world showing his talents. Of course you couldn&rsquo;t say anything. No, you wanted him to pursue his dreams and that&rsquo;s what he was doing. However you didn&rsquo;t suspect it to hurt this bad. </p><p>The nights you spend alone without him. The days you spend waiting for him to call and yet you were left with nothing. Though when you saw him on tv you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile; he was happy with his fans. So why was it that you felt at fault for this?</p><p>Maybe you were the one being too clingy? Maybe you should&rsquo;ve never admitted your feelings to him before his big concert. The one thing that made him go so viral and big. </p><p><i><b>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s only so many songs, that I can sing to pass the time</b></i></p><p><i><b>And I&rsquo;m running out of things to do, to get you off my mind (Oh ohh)&rsquo;</b></i></p><p>Kirishima sighed another concert done and over with and he couldn&rsquo;t be happier with that. He had to admit this tour was kicking his ass and he&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t know if he could sing another song from the heart anymore. Not with all these screaming fans of his and the backstage parties. </p><p>At first he wouldn&rsquo;t mind it in fact he enjoyed them for awhile but day after day of constant drinking then singing then traveling. Kirishima wanted to throw up and head home. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Kirishima my bro we&rsquo;re all going to Ultra Plus for some drinks get your ass ready!!!&rdquo; </p><p>Kirishima groaned and placed his guitar down before flopping down on the leather sofa. He was going absolutely insane with this and if he had to hear his manger say that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;taking a detour&rdquo; one more time he swears he might actually commit murder. </p><p>Placing his elbows on his knees he sighed and took the cold beer on the table that was placed by someone. Taking a swing of the alcohol he sighed and dropped his head. He missed you so much that it hurt for him</p><p><i><b>&lsquo;This long distance is killing me</b></i></p><p><i><b>It&rsquo;s so hard, it&rsquo;s so hard</b></i></p><p><i><b>Where we are, where we are</b></i></p><p><i><b>You&rsquo;re so far, this long distance is killing me&rsquo;</b></i></p><p>You whimpered at the cold bed you were laying on. The smell of him didn&rsquo;t provide as much comfort anymore. You need his warm no, better yet you need him home. You needed him to whisper sweet nothings in your ear. You needed him to hold you and make you forget all the stress from the world. You needed him to take you and make love to you in every part he could. You just needed him. </p><p>Rolling over you faced the empty bed that was called his and you grabbed his pillow and inhaled the scent one more time. It wasn&rsquo;t as comforting but it was still there to remind you that you were his. Then you saw it. </p><p>It was an old picture of you both sharing a kiss at one of his concerts. It was the first time he announced you as his girlfriend to the public. You loved it and you heard the crowd scream and cheer for their favorite redhead singer. You never forgot that day. </p><p><i><b>&lsquo;All I have is this picture in a frame</b></i></p><p><i><b>That I hold close, to see your face again (Ohh!)&rsquo;</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Hey man great concert!!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Omg it&rsquo;s him Red Riot.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey looks here the big man made it!!&rdquo; </p><p>Kirishima felt a hand smack his back hard and he jumped turning his head to meet the yellow hair bass player. </p><p>&ldquo;H-hey man.&rdquo; Kirishima said and the yellow hair laughed with a beer in his hand.

Below her leotard and covering her thighs are tight black shorts that end above the knee.&nbsp;She sports short white boots, with two metal rings on each ankle. </p><p>In order to protect her head, Rebecca wears a metal head guard, wrapping around her forehead and jaw - similar to a boxing guard - alongside a blue visor that covers her nose and eyes.</p><p>She has a dark grey lock emblazoned on her chest, and two gold disks by her collar which fasten a slate-grey hooded cape to her costume.</p><p><b>Quirk</b>:&nbsp;Chains</p><p><b>Weapons</b>:&nbsp;None</p><p><b>Gadgets/Tech</b>:&nbsp;None</p><h2><b>Social</b></h2><p><b>Likes</b>: Jewellery, swords, comic books, UK Grime, the Pro Hero Real Steel, and Fighting Games</p><p><b>Dislikes</b>: Coffee, rain, and poor spelling and grammar</p><p><b>Habits</b>:&nbsp;Cracking knuckles, playing with jewellery, stickler for rules&nbsp;</p><p><b>Fears</b>:&nbsp;Change she cannot control, the unknown, and deep holes</p><p><b>Family</b>:</p><ul><li>Myrtle Shacklebolt: Grandmother</li><li>Lincoln Shacklebolt: Father</li><li>Silver Shacklebolt: Mother</li><li>Ebenezer Shacklebolt: Eldest Brother</li><li>Mason Shacklebolt: Older Brother</li><li>Jade Shacklebolt: Older Sister</li></ul><p><b>Romantic Interests</b>:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;King&rdquo; Adeyemi</li><li>Daniel Thomlinson</li></ul><p><b>Allies</b>:</p><ul><li>Nhu Nguyen</li><li>&ldquo;Grim&rdquo; Muzrab&nbsp;</li><li>Ash Xieye Lingyu</li><li>Minerva Hellason</li></ul><p><b>Rivals</b>:</p><ul><li>Daniel Thomlinson</li></ul><p><b>Enemies</b>:</p><ul><li>The Wild Hunt</li></ul><p><b>Physical Weaknesses</b>:&nbsp;Heat, magnets, and concentrated force can all counteract her quirk.</p><p><b>Mental/Emotional Weaknesses</b>: Rebecca heavily relies on detailed planning, so any situation where a plan does not go successfully leaves Rebecca nearly useless.</p><h2><b>Quirk</b></h2><p><b>Name of your quirk</b>: Chains</p><p><b>Description</b>:&nbsp;Chains provides Rebecca with the ability to produce chains from her body and manipulate them like an extension of her own limbs. The chains only emerge from her skin, and can extend to a maximum of 20ft in length.</p><p><b>Strength</b>: Due to the simple nature of her quirk, Rebecca&rsquo;s quirk is capable of numerous utility.&nbsp;</p><p>The primary use of her ability is binding and restraining enemies, manipulating her chains to wrap around her foes and prevent them from moving and acting. Similarly, for victims she can use her chains to capture and carry them to safety.&nbsp;</p><p>The chains can also regularly extend out 15ft, granting Rebecca a wide reach to grab at foes. The speed that they can extend out is equal to the speed at which they can retract back into her body. The combination of extending out her chains and retracting them into her body allow her to either drag or pull objects away or towards her, or grapple and swing to and from points.</p><p>Her quirks offensive uses can be divided into two She can use the chains in mid-to-long range combat, either swinging her chains and lashing at opponents, or quickly launching out chains to jab at her enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>Rebecca can wrap the chains around her body to enhance her physical abilities. Wrapping the chains around her arms and legs enhances the power of her strikes. Additionally, by enveloping her entire body in chains, Rebecca essentially armours her body at the expense of her mobility.</p><p><b>Weaknesses</b>: Although Rebecca&rsquo;s chains are notably strong, they are still made of steel, and so keep the weaknesses of steel and iron. Strong force can easily shatter her chains, nullifying her quirk. For example, a physically stronger villain could break out of her chains or grab her chains and throw her around.</p><p>Additionally, as steel is magnetic, whenever her quirk is active, Rebecca becomes magnetic. As a result, she can easily be rendered immobile by either a strong magnet or a magnetic quirk user.</p><p>Finally, her quirks third main weakness is heat. High levels of heat or high intensity flames can melt her chains.</p><p><b>What age did you obtain it</b>: 5</p><p><b>How did you obtain it (what was happening at the time)</b>: When Lincoln Shacklebolt first told Rebecca that she had to visit a doctor to check why her quirk hadn&rsquo;t developed yet, Rebecca was distraught. So, as she was being pulled out of her home mid-tantrum, Rebecca made a last minute attempt to keep herself at home. As she reached for her door, rather than her little hand grabbing the handle, instead a chain shot out of her palm and cracked into the wood. The trip to the doctors was cancelled.</p></p>",
