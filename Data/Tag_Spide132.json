First off, he\u2019d woken up, more or less, in an alley, dressed in his Spider-Man suit. With his mask partially off. And a random man he didn\u2019t recognize webbed to the ground.</p><p>He\u2019d had to ask Karen who the man was; Reuben Holt, the leader of a human trafficking ring, the associates of whom Peter had taken out the day before. He vaguely remembered being on the ship, diving into the ocean for some unknown reason&hellip;</p><p>For the life of him, he couldn\u2019t remember how he\u2019d managed to track this individual criminal down and capture him. Had he seen him on the ship the day before? He\u2019d have to go through Karen\u2019s footage to find out.</p><p>Or had Holt merely been trying to abduct someone when Peter found him, and this superhero\u2019s arrest had happened almost out of pure chance? If that was the case, then where was the victim? They were close to Midtown- had Holt tried to abduct a teenager? The thought made Peter shudder.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t given much time to contemplate all of this, as soon enough, a black van pulled up to the entrance of the alley and a half dozen people in black suits spilled out. Happy emerged from the passenger\u2019s seat to briefly thank Peter for catching Holt and assure him that they\u2019d have more information soon. After Peter dissolved the web fluid, Happy\u2019s associates made quick work of restraining him and depositing him into the van before speeding away.</p><p>After realizing that school was starting soon, Peter went into autopilot and found his regular clothes, changing into them before heading to his first class. Going about this often-exercised routine on this particular day took about twice the time that it normally did, making him late to physics.</p><p>He all but lumbered into class, ignoring his teacher\u2019s passive-aggressive remark about punctuality before making his way over to his desk. He couldn\u2019t focus on the lecture at hand, and not because of his preoccupation with Reuben Holt, but because of a strange, indeterminate sensation slowly creeping up on him, spreading over his skin.</p><p>A warmth in his hand. Soft skin, fingers clutching his.<br/></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows. When was the last time he\u2019d held somebody\u2019s hand? And who had it been? Peter balled his hand into a fist, trying to remember the feeling.</p><p>Whatever it was, it masked over the subconscious suspicion that somebody was watching him. Occasionally, the feeling would bob to the surface, and Peter would look up to locate the source, until an odd forgetfulness drifted over him and he returned to his previous thoughts.</p><p>Ned approached him in the hallway between classes. \u201cAre you okay? You seem really out of it.\u201d<br/></p><p>How could Peter even explain the feeling? He couldn\u2019t focus, there were strange gaps in his recent memory&hellip; Was this the work of one of Holt\u2019s associates? How had they accomplished it? Or was Peter losing his super senses?</p><p>He tried to put it into words that Ned (the best friend, not the guy in the chair) could comprehend. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m forgetting something really important.\u201d Hell, that was all that Peter could comprehend, for the time being.</p><p>\u201cHomework?\u201d Ned suggested.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs it May\u2019s birthday, or something?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe Stark internship?\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter shook his head, despite the two matters being partially related. \u201cNo. Well&hellip; I- I was in an alley before school started, with the suit on, and I can\u2019t remember what I was doing there. There was just this guy lying on the ground, all webbed up. So I had to have taken him out, but I don\u2019t remember doing that at <i>all</i>. On top of that, apparently he\u2019s the leader of a human trafficking ring, which I helped take down yesterday on a freaking cargo ship, but I barely remember any of this! And I can\u2019t- I can\u2019t&hellip;\u201d He mad vague gestures with his hands, as if they would help him find the right words. \u201cThere\u2019s something else, I think. Something unrelated to all of this, I just&hellip; I\u2019m missing something really big, here.\u201d He curled and uncurled his fingers in a claw shape, that weird, empty-yet-full feeling still plaguing his hand.<br/></p><p>Ned was, by nature, a very smart person, as well as Peter Parker\u2019s best and most loyal companion in life. Regardless, he couldn\u2019t quite absorb and decipher everything that his best friend had said. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure if it was anything major, your senses would alert you, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged. That was about a substantial answer as he could expect from anyone, for the time being. He decided he wouldn\u2019t tell Ned about the feeling of being watched, he didn\u2019t want to worry his best friend, especially if there wasn\u2019t really any evidence in relation to the matter.</p><p>He had no choice but to continue his school day as usual, trying to look as normal as possible while obsessing over Reuben Holt and <i>that weird feeling in my hand what is it doing.</i></p><p>Come lunch time, Peter got a call from Mr. Stark and excused himself from the table to go answer it. If it was more information on Reuben Holt, or if he could pick the billionaire\u2019s brain for possible reasons as to why he was feeling so strange, then he was all for it.</p><p>In typical Stark fashion, Tony didn\u2019t even let Peter get out a polite\u00a0\u201chello\u201d before diving into the topic at hand. \u201cHey, kid. Hate to interrupt you during your education, but I thought you should know that we got that captain guy in our custody, now. Sent the info to your suit, if you wanna look more into it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cReuben Holt?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe very one. He was pretty out of it, but I guess that was (Y/N)\u2019s doing. How\u2019s she holding up, by the way?\u201d</p><p><i>(Y/N)!</i></p><p>Peter felt himself light up with recognition. He smacked his forehead at the realization, disbelieving at the idea that he could forget you so easily. Hadn\u2019t you talked, earlier that day?</p><p>He let your name fall softly from his lips, and that was his undoing.</p><p>An overwhelming mental tidal wave washed over him, making him slightly dizzy. The hand on his forehead was now being used to steady himself, keep himself grounded in reality. He couldn\u2019t even remember what he\u2019d been talking about. He shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to clear his mind. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>A pause came from the other end. \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d<br/></p><p>Another wave; it was like he forgot the name the very instant that he heard it. Repeating the name to himself didn\u2019t do any good, as it just started to sound like a weird jumbling of letters that didn\u2019t belong on his tongue.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I\u2019m not sure who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou introduced me to her two days ago,\u201d Tony explained. \u201cSuper shy, powers of invisibility? Is this really not ringing a bell?\u201d<br/></p><p>And for one second, he had a perfect image of you standing before him. (Y/E/C) eyes. (Y/H/C) hair. A faint, but genuine smile. A soft hand holding his.</p><p>But then, a tsunami of mental weakening. And with it, several aftershocks.</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to pass out. He collapsed against the lockers, trying to steel himself against the sensation. Was that why this was happening?\u00a0Was he sick? He hadn\u2019t gotten as much as a cold since the spider bite.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who can turn invisible, Mr. Stark,\u201d he barely managed to gasp out. \u201cI think I\u2019d remember that.\u201d<br/></p><p>There was a moment of silence, which Peter used to try and gather his quickly disintegrating thoughts together, then-</p><p>\u201cYou know, I barely got any sleep, last night. I\u2019m probably mixing some stuff up.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter let out a sigh of relief. He couldn\u2019t even remember half of what Mr. Stark had said during the conversation, he was just glad that it was over, that he wouldn\u2019t have to use his mental energy for anything other than trying to piece his memories back into place.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Feel better, Mr. Stark.\u201d<br/></p><p>Another pause. \u201cThanks, kid. Good job on today. Bye.\u201d</p><hr><p>Night fell early over Queens, as was customary for the season. You\u2019d exhausted yourself by trying to make everyone at school forget about you. On the surface, it didn\u2019t seem like too difficult a task, as there was only a handful of people at school who even knew your name, let alone had any substantial memory of you. Sure, everyone at school was very smart, but the challenge was lost due to a lack of attachment to you.</p><p>But then there was Peter. Much smarter and much more attached to you than&hellip; well, anyone else you\u2019d ever known, at least recently.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t expected it to work so well. Factoring in his super senses, you thought that Peter would immediately pick up on your efforts. After all, his senses were what had gotten you in trouble in the first place. In this instance, you supposed that your powers were stronger than his, and for his sake, you would have to use them.<br/></p><p>Neither of you were truly safe, anymore. Not with each other. A human trafficker had come after you, and that was indeed terrifying. But even more terrifying than that was what he\u2019d intended to you with you.</p><p><i>Be a good girl, and you won\u2019t get hurt. At least, not yet. We gotta get our information somehow, don\u2019t we?</i></p><p>More likely than not, he would have used any means necessary to get information from you, and you had no doubt that the information in question would have to do with Spider-Man and his identity. And yes, you <i>probably</i> would have been able to get yourself out of the situation, given your powers. If you were desperate enough, your abilities could have worked in your favor.</p><p>But, still&hellip;</p><p>Before all this, your powers had been focused on keeping yourself in the shadows, keeping people away from you, protecting yourself. None of that mattered as much as protecting Peter.</p><p>That was what this really came down to. That was how your powers worked. When you really, truly needed to accomplish something, your powers always came into play. The boy at Delmar\u2019s. The woman in the alley. The people in the shipping container.</p><p>And now, Peter.</p><p>Peter Parker didn\u2019t think things through. He was vastly intelligent, sure, but his heart pretty much always ruled over his head. For his sake, you had to favor your head over your heart.</p><p>But <i>boy</i>, did it suck.</p><p>You\u2019d only had a few days of friendship and attention before it was stripped away from you. Alright, you\u2019d technically taken it away from yourself, and you had all the power in the world to restore things back to the way they\u2019d been before, but of course, there was the issue of keeping Peter safe.</p><p>And besides, this was what you deserved, wasn\u2019t it? He was better off without you, anyway.</p><p>Wholly invisible, you slowly opened the door to your apartment, ever careful not to make any noise as you entered. You were startled slightly when you saw your parents standing across from each other in the living room. Your heartbeat spiked when you saw your mom crying, until you saw the small, plastic device in your dad\u2019s hand, and that he was crying, too.</p><p>You felt time stand still, all the oxygen leaving your lungs.</p><p>Your mother was pregnant.</p><p>As a child, you\u2019d occasionally wish for a sibling, dreamed of your parents paying attention to someone other than you. You\u2019d go to sleep at night, imagining your parents sitting you down and giving you the obligatory talk about how Even Though We\u2019ll Have To Give A Lot Of Attention To The New Baby, It Doesn\u2019t Mean We Love You Any Less.\u00a0You\u2019d seen that conversation on multiple kids\u2019 shows. You\u2019d heard your young classmates discuss it with their friends at school.\u00a0</p><p>That conversation was your childhood fantasy, and sometimes you would imagine being sandwiched between two other siblings, of being the infamous Middle Child, never getting any attention from your parents because they were too busy with their other children.</p><p>But now, in this particular circumstance, the news made your stomach sink.</p><p><i>You don\u2019t matter, anymore. You never did.</i></p><p>For what seemed like the millionth time in only a few days, you felt a lump developing in your throat, the familiar tremble of your lips as tears began to form in your eyes. You covered your mouth with your hand in an attempt to hide a pathetic sob, but the noise prevailed in spite of your effort.</p><p>Your parents didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>Which was what you wanted, wasn\u2019t it? Wasn\u2019t this your dream come true?\u00a0</p><p>Your dad hoisted your mom up by the waist and kissed her, then carried her into their bedroom. She laughed the whole way.</p><p>You stared wistfully as the bedroom door shut, the noise snapping you out of your daze. Eventually, you willed your legs to move and approached the doorway of your own room. The thought of this room being converted into a nursery briefly passed through your mind as you opened your window. You\u2019d probably have to clear out your stuff to stifle any risk of your parents remembering you. They clearly had bigger things to worry about now, and you couldn\u2019t get in their way.</p><p>You climbed out the window and onto the fire escape, noticing how much more difficult it was to accomplish this task when you couldn\u2019t see yourself. The last time you\u2019d done this, you\u2019d merely been flickering.</p><p>You made the trek up the stairs to the rooftop, heaving yourself over the side and landing on the concrete. You lay there for a second, staring up at the night sky. The light pollution of the city often made it difficult to observe the moon and the stars in clearer detail, but they weren\u2019t impossible to see. You liked how small the sky made you feel. At least, you used to.</p><p>You sat up and crossed your legs, staring at the neighborhood below. The perpetual state of traffic clogging up the streets, the pedestrians knocking into one another, the alleyway where only days ago you\u2019d helped to rescue that woman.</p><p><i>Where Peter rescued that woman. Period.</i></p><p>You sighed, trying to suppress another bout of crying. It wasn\u2019t like anyone would hear you up on the roof, and even if they did, they would be powerless to your ability to make them forget about anything you said or did.</p><p><i>How do you expect to survive the rest of your life without talking to people?<br/></i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t!</i></p><p>So, this was where you were, now. Your dream scenario. No connections, no relationships, no nothing.

First off, he\u2019d woken up, more or less, in an alley, dressed in his Spider-Man suit. With his mask partially off. And a random man he didn\u2019t recognize webbed to the ground.</p><p>He\u2019d had to ask Karen who the man was; Reuben Holt, the leader of a human trafficking ring, the associates of whom Peter had taken out the day before. He vaguely remembered being on the ship, diving into the ocean for some unknown reason\u2026</p><p>For the life of him, he couldn\u2019t remember how he\u2019d managed to track this individual criminal down and capture him. Had he seen him on the ship the day before? He\u2019d have to go through Karen\u2019s footage to find out.</p><p>Or had Holt merely been trying to abduct someone when Peter found him, and this superhero\u2019s arrest had happened almost out of pure chance? If that was the case, then where was the victim? They were close to Midtown- had Holt tried to abduct a teenager? The thought made Peter shudder.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t given much time to contemplate all of this, as soon enough, a black van pulled up to the entrance of the alley and a half dozen people in black suits spilled out. Happy emerged from the passenger\u2019s seat to briefly thank Peter for catching Holt and assure him that they\u2019d have more information soon. After Peter dissolved the web fluid, Happy\u2019s associates made quick work of restraining him and depositing him into the van before speeding away.</p><p>After realizing that school was starting soon, Peter went into autopilot and found his regular clothes, changing into them before heading to his first class. Going about this often-exercised routine on this particular day took about twice the time that it normally did, making him late to physics.</p><p>He all but lumbered into class, ignoring his teacher\u2019s passive-aggressive remark about punctuality before making his way over to his desk. He couldn\u2019t focus on the lecture at hand, and not because of his preoccupation with Reuben Holt, but because of a strange, indeterminate sensation slowly creeping up on him, spreading over his skin.</p><p>A warmth in his hand. Soft skin, fingers clutching his.<br></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows. When was the last time he\u2019d held somebody\u2019s hand? And who had it been? Peter balled his hand into a fist, trying to remember the feeling.</p><p>Whatever it was, it masked over the subconscious suspicion that somebody was watching him. Occasionally, the feeling would bob to the surface, and Peter would look up to locate the source, until an odd forgetfulness drifted over him and he returned to his previous thoughts.</p><p>Ned approached him in the hallway between classes. \u201cAre you okay? You seem really out of it.\u201d<br></p><p>How could Peter even explain the feeling? He couldn\u2019t focus, there were strange gaps in his recent memory\u2026 Was this the work of one of Holt\u2019s associates? How had they accomplished it? Or was Peter losing his super senses?</p><p>He tried to put it into words that Ned (the best friend, not the guy in the chair) could comprehend. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m forgetting something really important.\u201d Hell, that was all that Peter could comprehend, for the time being.</p><p>\u201cHomework?\u201d Ned suggested.<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs it May\u2019s birthday, or something?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe Stark internship?\u201d<br></p><p>Peter shook his head, despite the two matters being partially related. \u201cNo. Well\u2026 I- I was in an alley before school started, with the suit on, and I can\u2019t remember what I was doing there. There was just this guy lying on the ground, all webbed up. So I had to have taken him out, but I don\u2019t remember doing that at <i>all</i>. On top of that, apparently he\u2019s the leader of a human trafficking ring, which I helped take down yesterday on a freaking cargo ship, but I barely remember any of this! And I can\u2019t- I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d He mad vague gestures with his hands, as if they would help him find the right words. \u201cThere\u2019s something else, I think. Something unrelated to all of this, I just\u2026 I\u2019m missing something really big, here.\u201d He curled and uncurled his fingers in a claw shape, that weird, empty-yet-full feeling still plaguing his hand.<br></p><p>Ned was, by nature, a very smart person, as well as Peter Parker\u2019s best and most loyal companion in life. Regardless, he couldn\u2019t quite absorb and decipher everything that his best friend had said. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure if it was anything major, your senses would alert you, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged. That was about a substantial answer as he could expect from anyone, for the time being. He decided he wouldn\u2019t tell Ned about the feeling of being watched, he didn\u2019t want to worry his best friend, especially if there wasn\u2019t really any evidence in relation to the matter.</p><p>He had no choice but to continue his school day as usual, trying to look as normal as possible while obsessing over Reuben Holt and <i>that weird feeling in my hand what is it doing.</i></p><p>Come lunch time, Peter got a call from Mr. Stark and excused himself from the table to go answer it. If it was more information on Reuben Holt, or if he could pick the billionaire\u2019s brain for possible reasons as to why he was feeling so strange, then he was all for it.</p><p>In typical Stark fashion, Tony didn\u2019t even let Peter get out a polite\u00a0\u201chello\u201d before diving into the topic at hand. \u201cHey, kid. Hate to interrupt you during your education, but I thought you should know that we got that captain guy in our custody, now. Sent the info to your suit, if you wanna look more into it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cReuben Holt?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe very one. He was pretty out of it, but I guess that was (Y/N)\u2019s doing. How\u2019s she holding up, by the way?\u201d</p><p><i>(Y/N)!</i></p><p>Peter felt himself light up with recognition. He smacked his forehead at the realization, disbelieving at the idea that he could forget you so easily. Hadn\u2019t you talked, earlier that day?</p><p>He let your name fall softly from his lips, and that was his undoing.</p><p>An overwhelming mental tidal wave washed over him, making him slightly dizzy. The hand on his forehead was now being used to steady himself, keep himself grounded in reality. He couldn\u2019t even remember what he\u2019d been talking about. He shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to clear his mind. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>A pause came from the other end. \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d<br></p><p>Another wave; it was like he forgot the name the very instant that he heard it. Repeating the name to himself didn\u2019t do any good, as it just started to sound like a weird jumbling of letters that didn\u2019t belong on his tongue.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I\u2019m not sure who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou introduced me to her two days ago,\u201d Tony explained. \u201cSuper shy, powers of invisibility? Is this really not ringing a bell?\u201d<br></p><p>And for one second, he had a perfect image of you standing before him. (Y/E/C) eyes. (Y/H/C) hair. A faint, but genuine smile. A soft hand holding his.</p><p>But then, a tsunami of mental weakening. And with it, several aftershocks.</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to pass out. He collapsed against the lockers, trying to steel himself against the sensation. Was that why this was happening?\u00a0Was he sick? He hadn\u2019t gotten as much as a cold since the spider bite.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who can turn invisible, Mr. Stark,\u201d he barely managed to gasp out. \u201cI think I\u2019d remember that.\u201d<br></p><p>There was a moment of silence, which Peter used to try and gather his quickly disintegrating thoughts together, then-</p><p>\u201cYou know, I barely got any sleep, last night. I\u2019m probably mixing some stuff up.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter let out a sigh of relief. He couldn\u2019t even remember half of what Mr. Stark had said during the conversation, he was just glad that it was over, that he wouldn\u2019t have to use his mental energy for anything other than trying to piece his memories back into place.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Feel better, Mr. Stark.\u201d<br></p><p>Another pause. \u201cThanks, kid. Good job on today. Bye.\u201d</p><hr><p>Night fell early over Queens, as was customary for the season. You\u2019d exhausted yourself by trying to make everyone at school forget about you. On the surface, it didn\u2019t seem like too difficult a task, as there was only a handful of people at school who even knew your name, let alone had any substantial memory of you. Sure, everyone at school was very smart, but the challenge was lost due to a lack of attachment to you.</p><p>But then there was Peter. Much smarter and much more attached to you than\u2026 well, anyone else you\u2019d ever known, at least recently.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t expected it to work so well. Factoring in his super senses, you thought that Peter would immediately pick up on your efforts. After all, his senses were what had gotten you in trouble in the first place. In this instance, you supposed that your powers were stronger than his, and for his sake, you would have to use them.<br></p><p>Neither of you were truly safe, anymore. Not with each other. A human trafficker had come after you, and that was indeed terrifying. But even more terrifying than that was what he\u2019d intended to you with you.</p><p><i>Be a good girl, and you won\u2019t get hurt. At least, not yet. We gotta get our information somehow, don\u2019t we?</i></p><p>More likely than not, he would have used any means necessary to get information from you, and you had no doubt that the information in question would have to do with Spider-Man and his identity. And yes, you <i>probably</i> would have been able to get yourself out of the situation, given your powers. If you were desperate enough, your abilities could have worked in your favor.</p><p>But, still\u2026</p><p>Before all this, your powers had been focused on keeping yourself in the shadows, keeping people away from you, protecting yourself. None of that mattered as much as protecting Peter.</p><p>That was what this really came down to. That was how your powers worked. When you really, truly needed to accomplish something, your powers always came into play. The boy at Delmar\u2019s. The woman in the alley. The people in the shipping container.</p><p>And now, Peter.</p><p>Peter Parker didn\u2019t think things through. He was vastly intelligent, sure, but his heart pretty much always ruled over his head. For his sake, you had to favor your head over your heart.</p><p>But <i>boy</i>, did it suck.</p><p>You\u2019d only had a few days of friendship and attention before it was stripped away from you. Alright, you\u2019d technically taken it away from yourself, and you had all the power in the world to restore things back to the way they\u2019d been before, but of course, there was the issue of keeping Peter safe.</p><p>And besides, this was what you deserved, wasn\u2019t it? He was better off without you, anyway.</p><p>Wholly invisible, you slowly opened the door to your apartment, ever careful not to make any noise as you entered. You were startled slightly when you saw your parents standing across from each other in the living room. Your heartbeat spiked when you saw your mom crying, until you saw the small, plastic device in your dad\u2019s hand, and that he was crying, too.</p><p>You felt time stand still, all the oxygen leaving your lungs.</p><p>Your mother was pregnant.</p><p>As a child, you\u2019d occasionally wish for a sibling, dreamed of your parents paying attention to someone other than you. You\u2019d go to sleep at night, imagining your parents sitting you down and giving you the obligatory talk about how Even Though We\u2019ll Have To Give A Lot Of Attention To The New Baby, It Doesn\u2019t Mean We Love You Any Less.\u00a0You\u2019d seen that conversation on multiple kids\u2019 shows. You\u2019d heard your young classmates discuss it with their friends at school.\u00a0</p><p>That conversation was your childhood fantasy, and sometimes you would imagine being sandwiched between two other siblings, of being the infamous Middle Child, never getting any attention from your parents because they were too busy with their other children.</p><p>But now, in this particular circumstance, the news made your stomach sink.</p><p><i>You don\u2019t matter, anymore. You never did.</i></p><p>For what seemed like the millionth time in only a few days, you felt a lump developing in your throat, the familiar tremble of your lips as tears began to form in your eyes. You covered your mouth with your hand in an attempt to hide a pathetic sob, but the noise prevailed in spite of your effort.</p><p>Your parents didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>Which was what you wanted, wasn\u2019t it? Wasn\u2019t this your dream come true?\u00a0</p><p>Your dad hoisted your mom up by the waist and kissed her, then carried her into their bedroom. She laughed the whole way.</p><p>You stared wistfully as the bedroom door shut, the noise snapping you out of your daze. Eventually, you willed your legs to move and approached the doorway of your own room. The thought of this room being converted into a nursery briefly passed through your mind as you opened your window. You\u2019d probably have to clear out your stuff to stifle any risk of your parents remembering you. They clearly had bigger things to worry about now, and you couldn\u2019t get in their way.</p><p>You climbed out the window and onto the fire escape, noticing how much more difficult it was to accomplish this task when you couldn\u2019t see yourself. The last time you\u2019d done this, you\u2019d merely been flickering.</p><p>You made the trek up the stairs to the rooftop, heaving yourself over the side and landing on the concrete. You lay there for a second, staring up at the night sky. The light pollution of the city often made it difficult to observe the moon and the stars in clearer detail, but they weren\u2019t impossible to see. You liked how small the sky made you feel. At least, you used to.</p><p>You sat up and crossed your legs, staring at the neighborhood below. The perpetual state of traffic clogging up the streets, the pedestrians knocking into one another, the alleyway where only days ago you\u2019d helped to rescue that woman.</p><p><i>Where Peter rescued that woman. Period.</i></p><p>You sighed, trying to suppress another bout of crying. It wasn\u2019t like anyone would hear you up on the roof, and even if they did, they would be powerless to your ability to make them forget about anything you said or did.</p><p><i>How do you expect to survive the rest of your life without talking to people?<br></i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t!</i></p><p>So, this was where you were, now. Your dream scenario. No connections, no relationships, no nothing.

First off, he\u2019d woken up, more or less, in an alley, dressed in his Spider-Man suit. With his mask partially off. And a random man he didn\u2019t recognize webbed to the ground.</p><p>He\u2019d had to ask Karen who the man was; Reuben Holt, the leader of a human trafficking ring, the associates of whom Peter had taken out the day before. He vaguely remembered being on the ship, diving into the ocean for some unknown reason\u2026</p><p>For the life of him, he couldn\u2019t remember how he\u2019d managed to track this individual criminal down and capture him. Had he seen him on the ship the day before? He\u2019d have to go through Karen\u2019s footage to find out.</p><p>Or had Holt merely been trying to abduct someone when Peter found him, and this superhero\u2019s arrest had happened almost out of pure chance? If that was the case, then where was the victim? They were close to Midtown- had Holt tried to abduct a teenager? The thought made Peter shudder.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t given much time to contemplate all of this, as soon enough, a black van pulled up to the entrance of the alley and a half dozen people in black suits spilled out. Happy emerged from the passenger\u2019s seat to briefly thank Peter for catching Holt and assure him that they\u2019d have more information soon. After Peter dissolved the web fluid, Happy\u2019s associates made quick work of restraining him and depositing him into the van before speeding away.</p><p>After realizing that school was starting soon, Peter went into autopilot and found his regular clothes, changing into them before heading to his first class. Going about this often-exercised routine on this particular day took about twice the time that it normally did, making him late to physics.</p><p>He all but lumbered into class, ignoring his teacher\u2019s passive-aggressive remark about punctuality before making his way over to his desk. He couldn\u2019t focus on the lecture at hand, and not because of his preoccupation with Reuben Holt, but because of a strange, indeterminate sensation slowly creeping up on him, spreading over his skin.</p><p>A warmth in his hand. Soft skin, fingers clutching his.<br></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows. When was the last time he\u2019d held somebody\u2019s hand? And who had it been? Peter balled his hand into a fist, trying to remember the feeling.</p><p>Whatever it was, it masked over the subconscious suspicion that somebody was watching him. Occasionally, the feeling would bob to the surface, and Peter would look up to locate the source, until an odd forgetfulness drifted over him and he returned to his previous thoughts.</p><p>Ned approached him in the hallway between classes. \u201cAre you okay? You seem really out of it.\u201d<br></p><p>How could Peter even explain the feeling? He couldn\u2019t focus, there were strange gaps in his recent memory\u2026 Was this the work of one of Holt\u2019s associates? How had they accomplished it? Or was Peter losing his super senses?</p><p>He tried to put it into words that Ned (the best friend, not the guy in the chair) could comprehend. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m forgetting something really important.\u201d Hell, that was all that Peter could comprehend, for the time being.</p><p>\u201cHomework?\u201d Ned suggested.<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs it May\u2019s birthday, or something?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe Stark internship?\u201d<br></p><p>Peter shook his head, despite the two matters being partially related. \u201cNo. Well\u2026 I- I was in an alley before school started, with the suit on, and I can\u2019t remember what I was doing there. There was just this guy lying on the ground, all webbed up. So I had to have taken him out, but I don\u2019t remember doing that at <i>all</i>. On top of that, apparently he\u2019s the leader of a human trafficking ring, which I helped take down yesterday on a freaking cargo ship, but I barely remember any of this! And I can\u2019t- I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d He mad vague gestures with his hands, as if they would help him find the right words. \u201cThere\u2019s something else, I think. Something unrelated to all of this, I just\u2026 I\u2019m missing something really big, here.\u201d He curled and uncurled his fingers in a claw shape, that weird, empty-yet-full feeling still plaguing his hand.<br></p><p>Ned was, by nature, a very smart person, as well as Peter Parker\u2019s best and most loyal companion in life. Regardless, he couldn\u2019t quite absorb and decipher everything that his best friend had said. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure if it was anything major, your senses would alert you, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged. That was about a substantial answer as he could expect from anyone, for the time being. He decided he wouldn\u2019t tell Ned about the feeling of being watched, he didn\u2019t want to worry his best friend, especially if there wasn\u2019t really any evidence in relation to the matter.</p><p>He had no choice but to continue his school day as usual, trying to look as normal as possible while obsessing over Reuben Holt and <i>that weird feeling in my hand what is it doing.</i></p><p>Come lunch time, Peter got a call from Mr. Stark and excused himself from the table to go answer it. If it was more information on Reuben Holt, or if he could pick the billionaire\u2019s brain for possible reasons as to why he was feeling so strange, then he was all for it.</p><p>In typical Stark fashion, Tony didn\u2019t even let Peter get out a polite\u00a0\u201chello\u201d before diving into the topic at hand. \u201cHey, kid. Hate to interrupt you during your education, but I thought you should know that we got that captain guy in our custody, now. Sent the info to your suit, if you wanna look more into it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cReuben Holt?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe very one. He was pretty out of it, but I guess that was (Y/N)\u2019s doing. How\u2019s she holding up, by the way?\u201d</p><p><i>(Y/N)!</i></p><p>Peter felt himself light up with recognition. He smacked his forehead at the realization, disbelieving at the idea that he could forget you so easily. Hadn\u2019t you talked, earlier that day?</p><p>He let your name fall softly from his lips, and that was his undoing.</p><p>An overwhelming mental tidal wave washed over him, making him slightly dizzy. The hand on his forehead was now being used to steady himself, keep himself grounded in reality. He couldn\u2019t even remember what he\u2019d been talking about. He shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to clear his mind. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>A pause came from the other end. \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d<br></p><p>Another wave; it was like he forgot the name the very instant that he heard it. Repeating the name to himself didn\u2019t do any good, as it just started to sound like a weird jumbling of letters that didn\u2019t belong on his tongue.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I\u2019m not sure who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou introduced me to her two days ago,\u201d Tony explained. \u201cSuper shy, powers of invisibility? Is this really not ringing a bell?\u201d<br></p><p>And for one second, he had a perfect image of you standing before him. (Y/E/C) eyes. (Y/H/C) hair. A faint, but genuine smile. A soft hand holding his.</p><p>But then, a tsunami of mental weakening. And with it, several aftershocks.</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to pass out. He collapsed against the lockers, trying to steel himself against the sensation. Was that why this was happening?\u00a0Was he sick? He hadn\u2019t gotten as much as a cold since the spider bite.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who can turn invisible, Mr. Stark,\u201d he barely managed to gasp out. \u201cI think I\u2019d remember that.\u201d<br></p><p>There was a moment of silence, which Peter used to try and gather his quickly disintegrating thoughts together, then-</p><p>\u201cYou know, I barely got any sleep, last night. I\u2019m probably mixing some stuff up.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter let out a sigh of relief. He couldn\u2019t even remember half of what Mr. Stark had said during the conversation, he was just glad that it was over, that he wouldn\u2019t have to use his mental energy for anything other than trying to piece his memories back into place.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Feel better, Mr. Stark.\u201d<br></p><p>Another pause. \u201cThanks, kid. Good job on today. Bye.\u201d</p><hr><p>Night fell early over Queens, as was customary for the season. You\u2019d exhausted yourself by trying to make everyone at school forget about you. On the surface, it didn\u2019t seem like too difficult a task, as there was only a handful of people at school who even knew your name, let alone had any substantial memory of you. Sure, everyone at school was very smart, but the challenge was lost due to a lack of attachment to you.</p><p>But then there was Peter. Much smarter and much more attached to you than\u2026 well, anyone else you\u2019d ever known, at least recently.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t expected it to work so well. Factoring in his super senses, you thought that Peter would immediately pick up on your efforts. After all, his senses were what had gotten you in trouble in the first place. In this instance, you supposed that your powers were stronger than his, and for his sake, you would have to use them.<br></p><p>Neither of you were truly safe, anymore. Not with each other. A human trafficker had come after you, and that was indeed terrifying. But even more terrifying than that was what he\u2019d intended to you with you.</p><p><i>Be a good girl, and you won\u2019t get hurt. At least, not yet. We gotta get our information somehow, don\u2019t we?</i></p><p>More likely than not, he would have used any means necessary to get information from you, and you had no doubt that the information in question would have to do with Spider-Man and his identity. And yes, you <i>probably</i> would have been able to get yourself out of the situation, given your powers. If you were desperate enough, your abilities could have worked in your favor.</p><p>But, still\u2026</p><p>Before all this, your powers had been focused on keeping yourself in the shadows, keeping people away from you, protecting yourself. None of that mattered as much as protecting Peter.</p><p>That was what this really came down to. That was how your powers worked. When you really, truly needed to accomplish something, your powers always came into play. The boy at Delmar\u2019s. The woman in the alley. The people in the shipping container.</p><p>And now, Peter.</p><p>Peter Parker didn\u2019t think things through. He was vastly intelligent, sure, but his heart pretty much always ruled over his head. For his sake, you had to favor your head over your heart.</p><p>But <i>boy</i>, did it suck.</p><p>You\u2019d only had a few days of friendship and attention before it was stripped away from you. Alright, you\u2019d technically taken it away from yourself, and you had all the power in the world to restore things back to the way they\u2019d been before, but of course, there was the issue of keeping Peter safe.</p><p>And besides, this was what you deserved, wasn\u2019t it? He was better off without you, anyway.</p><p>Wholly invisible, you slowly opened the door to your apartment, ever careful not to make any noise as you entered. You were startled slightly when you saw your parents standing across from each other in the living room. Your heartbeat spiked when you saw your mom crying, until you saw the small, plastic device in your dad\u2019s hand, and that he was crying, too.</p><p>You felt time stand still, all the oxygen leaving your lungs.</p><p>Your mother was pregnant.</p><p>As a child, you\u2019d occasionally wish for a sibling, dreamed of your parents paying attention to someone other than you. You\u2019d go to sleep at night, imagining your parents sitting you down and giving you the obligatory talk about how Even Though We\u2019ll Have To Give A Lot Of Attention To The New Baby, It Doesn\u2019t Mean We Love You Any Less.\u00a0You\u2019d seen that conversation on multiple kids\u2019 shows. You\u2019d heard your young classmates discuss it with their friends at school.\u00a0</p><p>That conversation was your childhood fantasy, and sometimes you would imagine being sandwiched between two other siblings, of being the infamous Middle Child, never getting any attention from your parents because they were too busy with their other children.</p><p>But now, in this particular circumstance, the news made your stomach sink.</p><p><i>You don\u2019t matter, anymore. You never did.</i></p><p>For what seemed like the millionth time in only a few days, you felt a lump developing in your throat, the familiar tremble of your lips as tears began to form in your eyes. You covered your mouth with your hand in an attempt to hide a pathetic sob, but the noise prevailed in spite of your effort.</p><p>Your parents didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>Which was what you wanted, wasn\u2019t it? Wasn\u2019t this your dream come true?\u00a0</p><p>Your dad hoisted your mom up by the waist and kissed her, then carried her into their bedroom. She laughed the whole way.</p><p>You stared wistfully as the bedroom door shut, the noise snapping you out of your daze. Eventually, you willed your legs to move and approached the doorway of your own room. The thought of this room being converted into a nursery briefly passed through your mind as you opened your window. You\u2019d probably have to clear out your stuff to stifle any risk of your parents remembering you. They clearly had bigger things to worry about now, and you couldn\u2019t get in their way.</p><p>You climbed out the window and onto the fire escape, noticing how much more difficult it was to accomplish this task when you couldn\u2019t see yourself. The last time you\u2019d done this, you\u2019d merely been flickering.</p><p>You made the trek up the stairs to the rooftop, heaving yourself over the side and landing on the concrete. You lay there for a second, staring up at the night sky. The light pollution of the city often made it difficult to observe the moon and the stars in clearer detail, but they weren\u2019t impossible to see. You liked how small the sky made you feel. At least, you used to.</p><p>You sat up and crossed your legs, staring at the neighborhood below. The perpetual state of traffic clogging up the streets, the pedestrians knocking into one another, the alleyway where only days ago you\u2019d helped to rescue that woman.</p><p><i>Where Peter rescued that woman. Period.</i></p><p>You sighed, trying to suppress another bout of crying. It wasn\u2019t like anyone would hear you up on the roof, and even if they did, they would be powerless to your ability to make them forget about anything you said or did.</p><p><i>How do you expect to survive the rest of your life without talking to people?<br></i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t!</i></p><p>So, this was where you were, now. Your dream scenario. No connections, no relationships, no nothing. You\u2019d perfected your\u00a0\u201cmind control\u201d abilities, whatever the hell they ever were, and now there was literally nobody on the planet who could even think about you ever again, let alone care about you.<br></p><p>A choked sob emerged from your mouth, accompanied by a brief flicker to your form. You blinked on and off, like a shorting out lightbulb.</p><p><i>God, what\u2019s <b>wrong</b> with me?!</i></p><p>Your conflicted thoughts were answered much sooner and in a much more literal sense that you\u2019d expected, as a sudden sound of whirring machinery- almost like some sort of flying metal suit- suggested that you <i>might</i> have missed a few people in your efforts of self-erasure.</p><p>\u201cHey, there, Invisi-Kid.

First off, he&rsquo;d woken up, more or less, in an alley, dressed in his Spider-Man suit. With his mask partially off. And a random man he didn&rsquo;t recognize webbed to the ground.</p><p>He&rsquo;d had to ask Karen who the man was; Reuben Holt, the leader of a human trafficking ring, the associates of whom Peter had taken out the day before. He vaguely remembered being on the ship, diving into the ocean for some unknown reason&hellip;</p><p>For the life of him, he couldn&rsquo;t remember how he&rsquo;d managed to track this individual criminal down and capture him. Had he seen him on the ship the day before? He&rsquo;d have to go through Karen&rsquo;s footage to find out.</p><p>Or had Holt merely been trying to abduct someone when Peter found him, and this superhero&rsquo;s arrest had happened almost out of pure chance? If that was the case, then where was the victim? They were close to Midtown- had Holt tried to abduct a teenager? The thought made Peter shudder.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t given much time to contemplate all of this, as soon enough, a black van pulled up to the entrance of the alley and a half dozen people in black suits spilled out. Happy emerged from the passenger&rsquo;s seat to briefly thank Peter for catching Holt and assure him that they&rsquo;d have more information soon. After Peter dissolved the web fluid, Happy&rsquo;s associates made quick work of restraining him and depositing him into the van before speeding away.</p><p>After realizing that school was starting soon, Peter went into autopilot and found his regular clothes, changing into them before heading to his first class. Going about this often-exercised routine on this particular day took about twice the time that it normally did, making him late to physics.</p><p>He all but lumbered into class, ignoring his teacher&rsquo;s passive-aggressive remark about punctuality before making his way over to his desk. He couldn&rsquo;t focus on the lecture at hand, and not because of his preoccupation with Reuben Holt, but because of a strange, indeterminate sensation slowly creeping up on him, spreading over his skin.</p><p>A warmth in his hand. Soft skin, fingers clutching his.<br /></p><p>He furrowed his eyebrows. When was the last time he&rsquo;d held somebody&rsquo;s hand? And who had it been? Peter balled his hand into a fist, trying to remember the feeling.</p><p>Whatever it was, it masked over the subconscious suspicion that somebody was watching him. Occasionally, the feeling would bob to the surface, and Peter would look up to locate the source, until an odd forgetfulness drifted over him and he returned to his previous thoughts.</p><p>Ned approached him in the hallway between classes. &ldquo;Are you okay? You seem really out of it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>How could Peter even explain the feeling? He couldn&rsquo;t focus, there were strange gaps in his recent memory&hellip; Was this the work of one of Holt&rsquo;s associates? How had they accomplished it? Or was Peter losing his super senses?</p><p>He tried to put it into words that Ned (the best friend, not the guy in the chair) could comprehend. &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m forgetting something really important.&rdquo; Hell, that was all that Peter could comprehend, for the time being.</p><p>&ldquo;Homework?&rdquo; Ned suggested.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is it May&rsquo;s birthday, or something?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The Stark internship?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter shook his head, despite the two matters being partially related. &ldquo;No. Well&hellip; I- I was in an alley before school started, with the suit on, and I can&rsquo;t remember what I was doing there. There was just this guy lying on the ground, all webbed up. So I had to have taken him out, but I don&rsquo;t remember doing that at <i>all</i>. On top of that, apparently he&rsquo;s the leader of a human trafficking ring, which I helped take down yesterday on a freaking cargo ship, but I barely remember any of this! And I can&rsquo;t- I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; He mad vague gestures with his hands, as if they would help him find the right words. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else, I think. Something unrelated to all of this, I just&hellip; I&rsquo;m missing something really big, here.&rdquo; He curled and uncurled his fingers in a claw shape, that weird, empty-yet-full feeling still plaguing his hand.<br /></p><p>Ned was, by nature, a very smart person, as well as Peter Parker&rsquo;s best and most loyal companion in life. Regardless, he couldn&rsquo;t quite absorb and decipher everything that his best friend had said. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m sure if it was anything major, your senses would alert you, wouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugged. That was about a substantial answer as he could expect from anyone, for the time being. He decided he wouldn&rsquo;t tell Ned about the feeling of being watched, he didn&rsquo;t want to worry his best friend, especially if there wasn&rsquo;t really any evidence in relation to the matter.</p><p>He had no choice but to continue his school day as usual, trying to look as normal as possible while obsessing over Reuben Holt and <i>that weird feeling in my hand what is it doing.</i></p><p>Come lunch time, Peter got a call from Mr. Stark and excused himself from the table to go answer it. If it was more information on Reuben Holt, or if he could pick the billionaire&rsquo;s brain for possible reasons as to why he was feeling so strange, then he was all for it.</p><p>In typical Stark fashion, Tony didn&rsquo;t even let Peter get out a polite&nbsp;&ldquo;hello&rdquo; before diving into the topic at hand. &ldquo;Hey, kid. Hate to interrupt you during your education, but I thought you should know that we got that captain guy in our custody, now. Sent the info to your suit, if you wanna look more into it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Reuben Holt?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The very one. He was pretty out of it, but I guess that was (Y/N)&rsquo;s doing. How&rsquo;s she holding up, by the way?&rdquo;</p><p><i>(Y/N)!</i></p><p>Peter felt himself light up with recognition. He smacked his forehead at the realization, disbelieving at the idea that he could forget you so easily. Hadn&rsquo;t you talked, earlier that day?</p><p>He let your name fall softly from his lips, and that was his undoing.</p><p>An overwhelming mental tidal wave washed over him, making him slightly dizzy. The hand on his forehead was now being used to steady himself, keep himself grounded in reality. He couldn&rsquo;t even remember what he&rsquo;d been talking about. He shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to clear his mind. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p><p>A pause came from the other end. &ldquo;(Y/N)?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Another wave; it was like he forgot the name the very instant that he heard it. Repeating the name to himself didn&rsquo;t do any good, as it just started to sound like a weird jumbling of letters that didn&rsquo;t belong on his tongue.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, I&rsquo;m not sure who you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You introduced me to her two days ago,&rdquo; Tony explained. &ldquo;Super shy, powers of invisibility? Is this really not ringing a bell?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>And for one second, he had a perfect image of you standing before him. (Y/E/C) eyes. (Y/H/C) hair. A faint, but genuine smile. A soft hand holding his.</p><p>But then, a tsunami of mental weakening. And with it, several aftershocks.</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to pass out. He collapsed against the lockers, trying to steel himself against the sensation. Was that why this was happening?&nbsp;Was he sick? He hadn&rsquo;t gotten as much as a cold since the spider bite.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anybody who can turn invisible, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; he barely managed to gasp out. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d remember that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>There was a moment of silence, which Peter used to try and gather his quickly disintegrating thoughts together, then-</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I barely got any sleep, last night. I&rsquo;m probably mixing some stuff up.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter let out a sigh of relief. He couldn&rsquo;t even remember half of what Mr. Stark had said during the conversation, he was just glad that it was over, that he wouldn&rsquo;t have to use his mental energy for anything other than trying to piece his memories back into place.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay. Feel better, Mr. Stark.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Another pause. &ldquo;Thanks, kid. Good job on today. Bye.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Night fell early over Queens, as was customary for the season. You&rsquo;d exhausted yourself by trying to make everyone at school forget about you. On the surface, it didn&rsquo;t seem like too difficult a task, as there was only a handful of people at school who even knew your name, let alone had any substantial memory of you. Sure, everyone at school was very smart, but the challenge was lost due to a lack of attachment to you.</p><p>But then there was Peter. Much smarter and much more attached to you than&hellip; well, anyone else you&rsquo;d ever known, at least recently.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t expected it to work so well. Factoring in his super senses, you thought that Peter would immediately pick up on your efforts. After all, his senses were what had gotten you in trouble in the first place. In this instance, you supposed that your powers were stronger than his, and for his sake, you would have to use them.<br /></p><p>Neither of you were truly safe, anymore. Not with each other. A human trafficker had come after you, and that was indeed terrifying. But even more terrifying than that was what he&rsquo;d intended to you with you.</p><p><i>Be a good girl, and you won&rsquo;t get hurt. At least, not yet. We gotta get our information somehow, don&rsquo;t we?</i></p><p>More likely than not, he would have used any means necessary to get information from you, and you had no doubt that the information in question would have to do with Spider-Man and his identity. And yes, you <i>probably</i> would have been able to get yourself out of the situation, given your powers. If you were desperate enough, your abilities could have worked in your favor.</p><p>But, still&hellip;</p><p>Before all this, your powers had been focused on keeping yourself in the shadows, keeping people away from you, protecting yourself. None of that mattered as much as protecting Peter.</p><p>That was what this really came down to. That was how your powers worked. When you really, truly needed to accomplish something, your powers always came into play. The boy at Delmar&rsquo;s. The woman in the alley. The people in the shipping container.</p><p>And now, Peter.</p><p>Peter Parker didn&rsquo;t think things through. He was vastly intelligent, sure, but his heart pretty much always ruled over his head. For his sake, you had to favor your head over your heart.</p><p>But <i>boy</i>, did it suck.</p><p>You&rsquo;d only had a few days of friendship and attention before it was stripped away from you. Alright, you&rsquo;d technically taken it away from yourself, and you had all the power in the world to restore things back to the way they&rsquo;d been before, but of course, there was the issue of keeping Peter safe.</p><p>And besides, this was what you deserved, wasn&rsquo;t it? He was better off without you, anyway.</p><p>Wholly invisible, you slowly opened the door to your apartment, ever careful not to make any noise as you entered. You were startled slightly when you saw your parents standing across from each other in the living room. Your heartbeat spiked when you saw your mom crying, until you saw the small, plastic device in your dad&rsquo;s hand, and that he was crying, too.</p><p>You felt time stand still, all the oxygen leaving your lungs.</p><p>Your mother was pregnant.</p><p>As a child, you&rsquo;d occasionally wish for a sibling, dreamed of your parents paying attention to someone other than you. You&rsquo;d go to sleep at night, imagining your parents sitting you down and giving you the obligatory talk about how Even Though We&rsquo;ll Have To Give A Lot Of Attention To The New Baby, It Doesn&rsquo;t Mean We Love You Any Less.&nbsp;You&rsquo;d seen that conversation on multiple kids&rsquo; shows. You&rsquo;d heard your young classmates discuss it with their friends at school.&nbsp;</p><p>That conversation was your childhood fantasy, and sometimes you would imagine being sandwiched between two other siblings, of being the infamous Middle Child, never getting any attention from your parents because they were too busy with their other children.</p><p>But now, in this particular circumstance, the news made your stomach sink.</p><p><i>You don&rsquo;t matter, anymore. You never did.</i></p><p>For what seemed like the millionth time in only a few days, you felt a lump developing in your throat, the familiar tremble of your lips as tears began to form in your eyes. You covered your mouth with your hand in an attempt to hide a pathetic sob, but the noise prevailed in spite of your effort.</p><p>Your parents didn&rsquo;t notice.</p><p>Which was what you wanted, wasn&rsquo;t it? Wasn&rsquo;t this your dream come true?&nbsp;</p><p>Your dad hoisted your mom up by the waist and kissed her, then carried her into their bedroom. She laughed the whole way.</p><p>You stared wistfully as the bedroom door shut, the noise snapping you out of your daze. Eventually, you willed your legs to move and approached the doorway of your own room. The thought of this room being converted into a nursery briefly passed through your mind as you opened your window. You&rsquo;d probably have to clear out your stuff to stifle any risk of your parents remembering you. They clearly had bigger things to worry about now, and you couldn&rsquo;t get in their way.</p><p>You climbed out the window and onto the fire escape, noticing how much more difficult it was to accomplish this task when you couldn&rsquo;t see yourself. The last time you&rsquo;d done this, you&rsquo;d merely been flickering.</p><p>You made the trek up the stairs to the rooftop, heaving yourself over the side and landing on the concrete. You lay there for a second, staring up at the night sky. The light pollution of the city often made it difficult to observe the moon and the stars in clearer detail, but they weren&rsquo;t impossible to see. You liked how small the sky made you feel. At least, you used to.</p><p>You sat up and crossed your legs, staring at the neighborhood below. The perpetual state of traffic clogging up the streets, the pedestrians knocking into one another, the alleyway where only days ago you&rsquo;d helped to rescue that woman.</p><p><i>Where Peter rescued that woman. Period.</i></p><p>You sighed, trying to suppress another bout of crying. It wasn&rsquo;t like anyone would hear you up on the roof, and even if they did, they would be powerless to your ability to make them forget about anything you said or did.</p><p><i>How do you expect to survive the rest of your life without talking to people?<br /></i></p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t!</i></p><p>So, this was where you were, now. Your dream scenario. No connections, no relationships, no nothing. You&rsquo;d perfected your&nbsp;&ldquo;mind control&rdquo; abilities, whatever the hell they ever were, and now there was literally nobody on the planet who could even think about you ever again, let alone care about you.<br /></p><p>A choked sob emerged from your mouth, accompanied by a brief flicker to your form. You blinked on and off, like a shorting out lightbulb.</p><p><i>God, what&rsquo;s <b>wrong</b> with me?!</i></p><p>Your conflicted thoughts were answered much sooner and in a much more literal sense that you&rsquo;d expected, as a sudden sound of whirring machinery- almost like some sort of flying metal suit- suggested that you <i>might</i> have missed a few people in your efforts of self-erasure.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, there, Invisi-Kid.

Enough?</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>As soon as the door to the apartment creaked shut, Peter let a droplet escape his eye. The room was dark, the only light was formed by the half-full moon in the sky. The silver bled through the blinds and scored the ground with its dim light.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home late\u2026\u201d the gruff, Canadian accented voice came from the couch. Peter\u2019s roommate let his voice trail off when he saw the dim figure leaning against the door. He got up from his place on the couch to wrap his arms around his friend. \u201cHey, hey, baby boy? What\u2019s goin on?\u201d</p><p>Peter leaned on the other man\u2019s shoulder. His hands gilded their way up to squeeze the others shoulder blades together. More tears found their way out of Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cWade, what do i do?\u201d Peter\u2019s whisper barely audible with his mouth hidden in the material of the other man\u2019s outfit.</p><p>Wade was wearing his suit. His Deadpool suit, just without the mask. Peter could tell, one, because he saw it in the faint light of the moon, and two, because of the worn leather material that Peter\u2019s fingertips brushed up against.</p><p>\u201chere,\u201d Wade slightly pulled away from Peter\u2019s grip, just to scoop him up in his warm arms. He walked into Peter\u2019s room and laid him on the bed. \u201cMind if i join you?\u201d His scared lips had more words that they wanted to say, but he held his tongue. Wade did have a foul mouth, and ruined most moments with his awful jokes, but he did know how to restrain himself when he really needed to. Peter grunted in agreement to wade\u2019s question. Soon enough, Wade was right by his side, spooning him.</p><p>There was silence. A long pause. Peter listened to Wade\u2019s breath, felt it on his neck and the rising and falling of his chest against his back. The quiet was nice. Well, not completely silent. It was New York, after all, but this night seemed much quieter than others. Usually the cold air would be full of yelps and laughter of teenagers out late, or cars honking, or motor engines. Quiet was nice. Their lives were full of violence and crime fighting. It was nice to get a rest. To just take it slow for a bit.</p><p>Peter whimpered and pressed his back closer to Wade. The other man snuck his arms around Peter\u2019s waist, and pulled him in tight. Wade\u2019s body was warm. Peter could feel his heat very intensely creeping up his spine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d peter croaked. He sighed and buried his head in his hands. Hair poked out from between his fingers. \u201cI-sh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Wade moved his hands to trail down peter\u2019s neck. They soon went down the side of his body. \u201cTake your time, baby boy. We\u2019ve got as much time as you need.\u201d His scared fingers ever so slightly brushed up against Peter\u2019s abdomen. Little goosebumps formed on Peter\u2019s arms, and he could feel the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.</p><p>Peter took a breath. \u201cI went to see MJ again\u2026\u201d he sighed. It was always the worst ideas when it involved Peter and MJ. \u201cShe-she looks good\u2026 I thought, ya know, i kinda changed my mind about kids. i-i really wanted to start again. Maybe start a family, or adopt\u2026 but, uh, she\u2019s got\u2026 she\u2019s got a new boyfriend. She looks so happy with him, and I&rsquo;m happy for them. She looks really good, but\u2026 well, yeah.\u201d More splashes of salt slipped down his cheeks. This time, they rolled sideways, down his face, and onto the bed sheets. They glistened because of the moon\u2019s light filtering into the room.</p><p>Wade buried his head in the material of Peter\u2019s shirt. His warm arms stayed firm around peter, and honestly he didn\u2019t mind. Peter missed being held. Some days he would wake to find that his roommate had snuck in his room at night and fallen asleep on his bed. It was usually Peter being the big spoon, though he was shorter. He hated how, one, wade would sneak into his room, and two, how he was always holding someone else. This, having a tight grip around him, knowing that someone cares about him, felt good. He felt safe.</p><p>They didn\u2019t move from their spots the whole night. The two fell asleep, holding each other tight. Never wanting to let go.</p><p><br/></p><p>* * *</p><p><br/></p><p>Wade was confused. Peter was a LOT more tactile with him now. He was positive it had something to do with him finding out that MJ had moved on, but why wade? Not that he didn\u2019t like it, but it was pretty out of the blue for Peter.</p><p>Examples of Peter\u2019s new interactions with Wade: peter liked to sit closer to Wade when they watched tv/movies on the couch, he didn&rsquo;t get angry at Wade for sleeping in his bed anymore(what was that about?? Like what??), peter\u2019s head just *plop* on Wade\u2019s shoulder. Yeah, it was a very sudden change. It was weird.</p><p>[you\u2019re an idiot, Wade]</p><p>{hey, don\u2019t say that to him, white. That&rsquo;s very rude!}</p><p>[it\u2019s the truth]</p><p>\u201cShut up, you two.\u201d Wade grumbled to the voices that constantly bickered inside his head. He was trying to keep quiet because peter had dozed off after their fight with Vulture. He hadn&rsquo;t slept much last night, working on some documents and stuff for his job.</p><p>[do you really not understand?] the question was directed towards Wade, who didn\u2019t answer. [does he really not understand?]</p><p>{don\u2019t be mean to him! Just let him be oblivious about something for once in his life} wade could tell that if yellow had hands they would be slapping them over their mouth.</p><p>\u201cOblivious to what?\u201d Wade\u2019s voice was low. When neither yellow nor white spoke(honestly, a blessing. Most of the time the two are at each other&rsquo;s throats. Do you know how good it feels to get some peace and quiet for just a couple seconds when they don\u2019t speak?) wade growled. \u201cTell me, assholes.\u201d</p><p>[how about we leave that job for Peter to explain?]</p><p>Wade sighed. \u201cGod, you really can be a prick sometimes, White.\u201d</p><p>[so can you]</p><p>\u201cWipe that smug grin off your non existent face!\u201d</p><p>{hey, hey, lets not yell. Peter\u2019s sleeping!}</p><p>[not anymore.]</p><p>\u201cAw great, ass hole! You made me wake him up!\u201d Wade\u2019s whisky brown eyes shot over to where Peter\u2019s body started to shift slowly. He rose up and stretched his arms into the sky. It was just starting to become sunset, so little by little indigo took over the sky. Peter\u2019s back arched as he stretched, then swiveled as he turned to look at Wade.</p><p>\u201cThe boxes keep you company while i was out?\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>Wade hopped up on his feet. He walked over to where his partner-in-crime was setting and held out a hand. \u201cYeah. Not sure if I particularly like their company, but yeah.\u201d Peter took his scarred hand, and was pulled up on his feet as well. \u201cI\u2019d take your voice over their bickering any day, though!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey argue? And there\u2019s two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yellow and white. Yellow shows up in between these things {}, and white shows up in these [].\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you just make that noise with your mouth?\u201d Peter pulled on his mask as they hopped down the fire escape to their window. When they landed on the metal perched on the side of the building, it rattled. They both had to use their combined strength to pull up the window.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions that you don\u2019t want the answer to,\u201d Wade smiled over his shoulder as he crawled in through the opening. Peter followed close behind.</p><p>The two crashed on Peter\u2019s bed. It creaked underneath them as they flopped on. The man in the webbed suit pulled his mask off. His dark chocolate eyes glittered when he looked at wade. Wade soon followed his lead. The golden light from the sunset made his skin glow. Wow, he looked good, but awful. He looked like a mess. Hadn&rsquo;t shaved in almost a week, bags under his eyes, messy hair, but god were his eyes vibrant. He looked like a kid going to Disney for the first time.</p><p>All of a sudden, Wade felt a little peck on his cheek. Peter had reached his head out to press his lips against the other man\u2019s cheek. He went chilli pepper red(oh god, oh fuck).</p><p>\u201cOh god, oh fuck,\u201d Wade managed to croak out, looking over at the other man whose face was basically the same. What little part of his neck that wade could see was also bright red. \u201cUhhh\u2026 w-whaaaatt?\u201d</p><p>[idiot. He\u2019s been in love with you for almost a year now]</p><p>{hey, he\u2019s not an idiot! I only put the pieces together about half a year ago}</p><p>\u201cShut up, boxes,\u201d Peter whispered, reaching out a hand to place on wade\u2019s face. It was burning hot from all the blood rushing there. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin this for us.\u201d</p><p>Wade swallowed. His stomach was turning. He didn\u2019t feel like he was gonna be sick. No, he felt amazing. This was amazing. But he was just so nervous.</p><p>\u201cHo-how did you know they were talking?\u201d Wade shivered at peter\u2019s touch. His cold hand on wade\u2019s warm cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat look in your eye that you get when they argue.\u201d</p><p>Wade nodded. His stomach did a thing again when Peter pulled wade in. He was hugging the scarred man. Holding him close. Ohh god. This was all he wanted in life. Wade did the same and hugged him close.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was obvious that i liked you,\u201d peter whispered. \u201cYa\u2019know? That&rsquo;s why i started to get more\u2026 uh, what would you call it?\u201d</p><p>Wade pondered a second, furrowing the skin where his eyebrows would be, but weren&rsquo;t. \u201cTouchy-feely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, sure?\u201d The other man sighed. \u201cI\u2026 i didn\u2019t know you were kind of not picking up on my hints. I wish i would have just told you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I, uh, i don\u2019t mind you\u2026 kissing my cheek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, eh?\u201d(ugghhh, really? You couldn\u2019t help slipping in the fact that I&rsquo;m Canadian even though you already said it earlier, and you don&rsquo;t use it anywhere else?)\u201cYou think i haven\u2019t liked you for years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was all just a running joke!\u201d Peter\u2019s adorable, flustered laugh came. Peter shrunk up as he tried to hide it, but couldn\u2019t. He laughed so hard sometimes, and his face would light up so much. That\u2019s what happen now. It only lasted a couple seconds, but they were the best god damn seconds of Wade\u2019s life. \u201cI-i didn\u2019t know you actually\u2026 you know, like-d me?\u201d</p><p>Wade sighed, his arms still wrapped tightly around Peter. The brown haired man laid his head in the crook of wade\u2019s scarred neck.</p><p>\u201cCould, uh\u2026 could we do this more often?\u201d Wade was too scared to say it too loud. Maybe peter would hear and would say yes. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t. Maybe he would get angry and storm off. Maybe he just wanted this to be a one time thing. That was a running theme for wade. One night stands with people he actually liked, then he never saw them again. Was he tricking wade? Was this a trick? Oh god, no. If it was a trick wade would actually try to kill himself. His stomach dropped thinking about how this could be a trick. Peter was so sweet, but maybe it was all a trick to let wade in. Maybe peter was using him. Was peter using him? Would peter turn him in to the cops because of all the people he\u2019s killed? Oh god no. Peter? Would peter do that-</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d peter kissed the other man\u2019s neck. Everything wade was ever scared of melted away with that one word. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s just sad peter :\u2019(</p><p>Word count: idk??? Enough?</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>As soon as the door to the apartment creaked shut, Peter let a droplet escape his eye. The room was dark, the only light was formed by the half-full moon in the sky. The silver bled through the blinds and scored the ground with its dim light.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home late\u2026\u201d the gruff, Canadian accented voice came from the couch. Peter\u2019s roommate let his voice trail off when he saw the dim figure leaning against the door. He got up from his place on the couch to wrap his arms around his friend. \u201cHey, hey, baby boy? What\u2019s goin on?\u201d</p><p>Peter leaned on the other man\u2019s shoulder. His hands gilded their way up to squeeze the others shoulder blades together. More tears found their way out of Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cWade, what do i do?\u201d Peter\u2019s whisper barely audible with his mouth hidden in the material of the other man\u2019s outfit.</p><p>Wade was wearing his suit. His Deadpool suit, just without the mask. Peter could tell, one, because he saw it in the faint light of the moon, and two, because of the worn leather material that Peter\u2019s fingertips brushed up against.</p><p>\u201chere,\u201d Wade slightly pulled away from Peter\u2019s grip, just to scoop him up in his warm arms. He walked into Peter\u2019s room and laid him on the bed. \u201cMind if i join you?\u201d His scared lips had more words that they wanted to say, but he held his tongue. Wade did have a foul mouth, and ruined most moments with his awful jokes, but he did know how to restrain himself when he really needed to. Peter grunted in agreement to wade\u2019s question. Soon enough, Wade was right by his side, spooning him.</p><p>There was silence. A long pause. Peter listened to Wade\u2019s breath, felt it on his neck and the rising and falling of his chest against his back. The quiet was nice. Well, not completely silent. It was New York, after all, but this night seemed much quieter than others. Usually the cold air would be full of yelps and laughter of teenagers out late, or cars honking, or motor engines. Quiet was nice. Their lives were full of violence and crime fighting. It was nice to get a rest. To just take it slow for a bit.</p><p>Peter whimpered and pressed his back closer to Wade. The other man snuck his arms around Peter\u2019s waist, and pulled him in tight. Wade\u2019s body was warm. Peter could feel his heat very intensely creeping up his spine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d peter croaked. He sighed and buried his head in his hands. Hair poked out from between his fingers. \u201cI-sh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Wade moved his hands to trail down peter\u2019s neck. They soon went down the side of his body. \u201cTake your time, baby boy. We\u2019ve got as much time as you need.\u201d His scared fingers ever so slightly brushed up against Peter\u2019s abdomen. Little goosebumps formed on Peter\u2019s arms, and he could feel the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.</p><p>Peter took a breath. \u201cI went to see MJ again\u2026\u201d he sighed. It was always the worst ideas when it involved Peter and MJ. \u201cShe-she looks good\u2026 I thought, ya know, i kinda changed my mind about kids. i-i really wanted to start again. Maybe start a family, or adopt\u2026 but, uh, she\u2019s got\u2026 she\u2019s got a new boyfriend. She looks so happy with him, and I\u2019m happy for them. She looks really good, but\u2026 well, yeah.\u201d More splashes of salt slipped down his cheeks. This time, they rolled sideways, down his face, and onto the bed sheets. They glistened because of the moon\u2019s light filtering into the room.</p><p>Wade buried his head in the material of Peter\u2019s shirt. His warm arms stayed firm around peter, and honestly he didn\u2019t mind. Peter missed being held. Some days he would wake to find that his roommate had snuck in his room at night and fallen asleep on his bed. It was usually Peter being the big spoon, though he was shorter. He hated how, one, wade would sneak into his room, and two, how he was always holding someone else. This, having a tight grip around him, knowing that someone cares about him, felt good. He felt safe.</p><p>They didn\u2019t move from their spots the whole night. The two fell asleep, holding each other tight. Never wanting to let go.</p><p><br></p><p>* * *</p><p><br></p><p>Wade was confused. Peter was a LOT more tactile with him now. He was positive it had something to do with him finding out that MJ had moved on, but why wade? Not that he didn\u2019t like it, but it was pretty out of the blue for Peter.</p><p>Examples of Peter\u2019s new interactions with Wade: peter liked to sit closer to Wade when they watched tv/movies on the couch, he didn\u2019t get angry at Wade for sleeping in his bed anymore(what was that about?? Like what??), peter\u2019s head just *plop* on Wade\u2019s shoulder. Yeah, it was a very sudden change. It was weird.</p><p>[you\u2019re an idiot, Wade]</p><p>{hey, don\u2019t say that to him, white. That\u2019s very rude!}</p><p>[it\u2019s the truth]</p><p>\u201cShut up, you two.\u201d Wade grumbled to the voices that constantly bickered inside his head. He was trying to keep quiet because peter had dozed off after their fight with Vulture. He hadn\u2019t slept much last night, working on some documents and stuff for his job.</p><p>[do you really not understand?] the question was directed towards Wade, who didn\u2019t answer. [does he really not understand?]</p><p>{don\u2019t be mean to him! Just let him be oblivious about something for once in his life} wade could tell that if yellow had hands they would be slapping them over their mouth.</p><p>\u201cOblivious to what?\u201d Wade\u2019s voice was low. When neither yellow nor white spoke(honestly, a blessing. Most of the time the two are at each other\u2019s throats. Do you know how good it feels to get some peace and quiet for just a couple seconds when they don\u2019t speak?) wade growled. \u201cTell me, assholes.\u201d</p><p>[how about we leave that job for Peter to explain?]</p><p>Wade sighed. \u201cGod, you really can be a prick sometimes, White.\u201d</p><p>[so can you]</p><p>\u201cWipe that smug grin off your non existent face!\u201d</p><p>{hey, hey, lets not yell. Peter\u2019s sleeping!}</p><p>[not anymore.]</p><p>\u201cAw great, ass hole! You made me wake him up!\u201d Wade\u2019s whisky brown eyes shot over to where Peter\u2019s body started to shift slowly. He rose up and stretched his arms into the sky. It was just starting to become sunset, so little by little indigo took over the sky. Peter\u2019s back arched as he stretched, then swiveled as he turned to look at Wade.</p><p>\u201cThe boxes keep you company while i was out?\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>Wade hopped up on his feet. He walked over to where his partner-in-crime was setting and held out a hand. \u201cYeah. Not sure if I particularly like their company, but yeah.\u201d Peter took his scarred hand, and was pulled up on his feet as well. \u201cI\u2019d take your voice over their bickering any day, though!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey argue? And there\u2019s two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yellow and white. Yellow shows up in between these things {}, and white shows up in these [].\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you just make that noise with your mouth?\u201d Peter pulled on his mask as they hopped down the fire escape to their window. When they landed on the metal perched on the side of the building, it rattled. They both had to use their combined strength to pull up the window.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions that you don\u2019t want the answer to,\u201d Wade smiled over his shoulder as he crawled in through the opening. Peter followed close behind.</p><p>The two crashed on Peter\u2019s bed. It creaked underneath them as they flopped on. The man in the webbed suit pulled his mask off. His dark chocolate eyes glittered when he looked at wade. Wade soon followed his lead. The golden light from the sunset made his skin glow. Wow, he looked good, but awful. He looked like a mess. Hadn\u2019t shaved in almost a week, bags under his eyes, messy hair, but god were his eyes vibrant. He looked like a kid going to Disney for the first time.</p><p>All of a sudden, Wade felt a little peck on his cheek. Peter had reached his head out to press his lips against the other man\u2019s cheek. He went chilli pepper red(oh god, oh fuck).</p><p>\u201cOh god, oh fuck,\u201d Wade managed to croak out, looking over at the other man whose face was basically the same. What little part of his neck that wade could see was also bright red. \u201cUhhh\u2026 w-whaaaatt?\u201d</p><p>[idiot. He\u2019s been in love with you for almost a year now]</p><p>{hey, he\u2019s not an idiot! I only put the pieces together about half a year ago}</p><p>\u201cShut up, boxes,\u201d Peter whispered, reaching out a hand to place on wade\u2019s face. It was burning hot from all the blood rushing there. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin this for us.\u201d</p><p>Wade swallowed. His stomach was turning. He didn\u2019t feel like he was gonna be sick. No, he felt amazing. This was amazing. But he was just so nervous.</p><p>\u201cHo-how did you know they were talking?\u201d Wade shivered at peter\u2019s touch. His cold hand on wade\u2019s warm cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat look in your eye that you get when they argue.\u201d</p><p>Wade nodded. His stomach did a thing again when Peter pulled wade in. He was hugging the scarred man. Holding him close. Ohh god. This was all he wanted in life. Wade did the same and hugged him close.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was obvious that i liked you,\u201d peter whispered. \u201cYa\u2019know? That\u2019s why i started to get more\u2026 uh, what would you call it?\u201d</p><p>Wade pondered a second, furrowing the skin where his eyebrows would be, but weren\u2019t. \u201cTouchy-feely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, sure?\u201d The other man sighed. \u201cI\u2026 i didn\u2019t know you were kind of not picking up on my hints. I wish i would have just told you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I, uh, i don\u2019t mind you\u2026 kissing my cheek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, eh?\u201d(ugghhh, really? You couldn\u2019t help slipping in the fact that I\u2019m Canadian even though you already said it earlier, and you don\u2019t use it anywhere else?)\u201cYou think i haven\u2019t liked you for years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was all just a running joke!\u201d Peter\u2019s adorable, flustered laugh came. Peter shrunk up as he tried to hide it, but couldn\u2019t. He laughed so hard sometimes, and his face would light up so much. That\u2019s what happen now. It only lasted a couple seconds, but they were the best god damn seconds of Wade\u2019s life. \u201cI-i didn\u2019t know you actually\u2026 you know, like-d me?\u201d</p><p>Wade sighed, his arms still wrapped tightly around Peter. The brown haired man laid his head in the crook of wade\u2019s scarred neck.</p><p>\u201cCould, uh\u2026 could we do this more often?\u201d Wade was too scared to say it too loud. Maybe peter would hear and would say yes. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t. Maybe he would get angry and storm off. Maybe he just wanted this to be a one time thing. That was a running theme for wade. One night stands with people he actually liked, then he never saw them again. Was he tricking wade? Was this a trick? Oh god, no. If it was a trick wade would actually try to kill himself. His stomach dropped thinking about how this could be a trick. Peter was so sweet, but maybe it was all a trick to let wade in. Maybe peter was using him. Was peter using him? Would peter turn him in to the cops because of all the people he\u2019s killed? Oh god no. Peter? Would peter do that-</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d peter kissed the other man\u2019s neck. Everything wade was ever scared of melted away with that one word. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p></p>",

That&rsquo;s why i started to get more&hellip; uh, what would you call it?&rdquo;</p><p>Wade pondered a second, furrowing the skin where his eyebrows would be, but weren&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Touchy-feely?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, sure?&rdquo; The other man sighed. &ldquo;I&hellip; i didn&rsquo;t know you were kind of not picking up on my hints. I wish i would have just told you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no. I, uh, i don&rsquo;t mind you&hellip; kissing my cheek?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, eh?&rdquo;(ugghhh, really? You couldn&rsquo;t help slipping in the fact that I&rsquo;m Canadian even though you already said it earlier, and you don&rsquo;t use it anywhere else?)&ldquo;You think i haven&rsquo;t liked you for years?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought that was all just a running joke!&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s adorable, flustered laugh came. Peter shrunk up as he tried to hide it, but couldn&rsquo;t. He laughed so hard sometimes, and his face would light up so much. That&rsquo;s what happen now. It only lasted a couple seconds, but they were the best god damn seconds of Wade&rsquo;s life. &ldquo;I-i didn&rsquo;t know you actually&hellip; you know, like-d me?&rdquo;</p><p>Wade sighed, his arms still wrapped tightly around Peter. The brown haired man laid his head in the crook of wade&rsquo;s scarred neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Could, uh&hellip; could we do this more often?&rdquo; Wade was too scared to say it too loud. Maybe peter would hear and would say yes. Maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t. Maybe he would get angry and storm off. Maybe he just wanted this to be a one time thing. That was a running theme for wade. One night stands with people he actually liked, then he never saw them again. Was he tricking wade? Was this a trick? Oh god, no. If it was a trick wade would actually try to kill himself. His stomach dropped thinking about how this could be a trick. Peter was so sweet, but maybe it was all a trick to let wade in. Maybe peter was using him. Was peter using him? Would peter turn him in to the cops because of all the people he&rsquo;s killed? Oh god no. Peter? Would peter do that-</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; peter kissed the other man&rsquo;s neck. Everything wade was ever scared of melted away with that one word. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</p></p>",
