SO Nagini was a human who had the capacity of changing herself into a snake by her own will, but at a moment, she was stuck into this form.

She was at the side of the Dark Lord, who did not one war, but two, and killed himself a ton of wizards. She isn\u2019t innocent, it\u2019s not like she killed people by accident.

WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT NAGINI. So yeah if Harry was able to give his own son the name of a dark wizard (he is not grey, all his actions were only\u201d for Lily\u201d, revenge, not for the good), he was able to help a little a snake, he was able to talk to her, and maybe she would be a traitor of Voldemort at the end.

        "question": "Everyone up in arms about Nagini being cursed into a snake & \"forced\" to play pet to Voldemort, are we going to forget that Nagini was an evil force to be reckoned with in the books? Any time we saw her, she was being doted on by Voldemort, or devouring an innocent Muggle Studies professor, or, worse, killing a woman & possessing her rotting corpse to trick & try to kill Harry. Now that we suddenly have a backstory on her, suddenly we're racist for remembering what she was like in the books? Nah",
        "answer": "<p>Like I get you, Nagini was definitely not a weak waif, she did some crazy shit in the books (the shapeshifting scene still absolutely terrifies me), and she felt like an actual threat as opposed to a smol danger noodle, but I just feel like JK keeps adding more and more outlandish takes to her own work that aren&rsquo;t super thought out in a bid to be more &ldquo;woke&rdquo; and it just doesn&rsquo;t work. I get it, there weren&rsquo;t any openly queer people in HP, or that many POC, it was a different time, you want to be more diverse now (even if it&rsquo;s for self-serving reasons), but honestly the &ldquo;actually they were members of a marginalised identity the WHOLE TIME&rdquo; galaxy brain shit doesn&rsquo;t really feel like real representation because nobody knows, yk? We don&rsquo;t need the characters doing things and then screaming &ldquo;alSO I AM VERY GAY&rdquo;, but literally who would&rsquo;ve known Dumbledore was gay without her telling us? Just a casual drop in, that&rsquo;s all. Your snake is an Asian woman? I&rsquo;m? Your snake is a snake, Joanne. That&rsquo;s what people are going to see on the surface level. </p>",

By the time Harry meets Nagini, she\u2019s gone full-snake. Like many other characters\u2019 backstories, hers just never comes up because it doesn\u2019t serve the plot. In the books, Harry\u2019s quest is to hunt the Horcruxes, Nagini included. And all his information comes from Dumbledore. If Dumbledore knows where Nagini came from, why would he even tell Harry? To complicate the plot and give Harry some bullshit internal struggle about killing a woman/not-even-a-woman-anymore before she is inevitably killed anyway? To make Neville look like the bad guy? Or are we meant to drag out the plot of the Deathly Hallows by adding in a quest to try to \u201csave\u201d Nagini on top of the million other things going on in this book?</p><p>Whatever. Thing is, there were plenty of things in the books that wanted to be explored further, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Rowling had decided to save this for the same possible prequel that could explore the Grindelwald drama among many other things.

Oh wait, we all did, when whiny bitches decided that Rowling didn\u2019t even think up the Horcruxes until halfway through the series, or that Dumbledore being gay was a retcon despite him never coming across as a Straight Man. This stuff isn\u2019t that hard to come up with, guys. It\u2019s called imagination. \u201cSnake used to be woman\u201d is from the same person who brought us Scabbers. Or do you think she just lacks the self-control to keep such a secret for 20 years?</p><p>For the record, apart from Nagini\u2019s name (seriously, yikes) the books always made it clear that she is NOT an ordinary snake. (They also made it clear that she\u2019s more than just a \u201cpet\u201d to Voldemort, so let\u2019s not even Go There.) I always figured she was just a Magic Snek and I waited to find out more on Pottermore, but whatever, don\u2019t get annoyed just because you never noticed.
