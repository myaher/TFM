Based on this <a href=\"https://ironmanstan.tumblr.com/post/179015903476/peter-who-can-lift-up-to-10-tons-in-canon\">post</a>.\u00a0<br/><b>Characters:</b> Peter Parker, Tony Stark, Natasha Romanov, Thor Odinson, background Avengers<br/><b>A/n:</b> I love this post, it always makes me laugh so I decided to write a mini fic on it!</p><p>-</p><p>The Avengers underestimated Peter Parker. They really did.\u00a0</p><p>Tony caught himself doing it most of the time. He\u2019d think to himself, how could a sixteen year old kid save the world? Yet, Peter proved them all wrong every time.\u00a0</p><p>It was impressive, yet terrifying.\u00a0</p><p>The first instance had been at the zoo. Tony really hated the smell here, and the heat beating down on the back of his neck, but after Peter had suggested it, the other Avengers took to it quite well.\u00a0</p><p>Clint had dragged Bruce away to the bat house, insisting that it was calm and quiet in there. Steve had followed just to be sure. Thor often wondered about by himself, but Tony had told him he was allowed to bring his brother this time as long as he didn\u2019t turn Thor into an animal. They all made bets on how long that would last.\u00a0</p><p>Natasha was sipping a soda, leaning on Tony\u2019s shoulder, as if she could catch some of the shade being provided from Tony\u2019s hat. Peter was excitedly standing on his tip toes, trying to peak over a few kid\u2019s head to get a good look at the elephants.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Tony stood away from the people, which Natasha seemed to also appreciate, which is why she took to standing in his personal bubble. He didn\u2019t mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like how you actually planned this trip just for the kid.\u201d Natasha deadpanned, her sunglasses not giving a single hint to where her eyes were darting to. He knew they were on Peter, with his Iron Man shirt on that still had the tags on it. Nobody had the heart to tell him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tony shrugged, keeping his arms crossed.\u00a0\u201cThe Avengers could use a day out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing nearly ten feet away just so people won\u2019t touch you, and you absolutely <i>hate</i> being out in public if the attention isn\u2019t directed towards you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tony tilted his head, as if letting the thought roll throughout his mind.\u00a0\u201cPoint taken.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony had sworn him and Natasha had only been mumbling to one another for a moment, when Natasha\u2019s breath caught in her throat. It was hard to hear, but Tony always knew when something was wrong with her. She was never phased by anything.\u00a0</p><p>Tony snapped to attention, watching as Peter Parker held up an elephant. <i>Off the ground</i>. Peter was <i>holding it.</i> <i>Like it was nothing</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook Mr. Stark!\u201d Peter waved with his other hand-he was holding an elephant with one hand, <i>oh my god</i>-and grinned.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s my new pet!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Other people in the crowd we\u2019re starting to become alarmed, while smaller children giggled and cheered.\u00a0</p><p>Tony could feel himself losing color in his face, trying to stay calm.\u00a0\u201cOkay, okay, this is cool, okay-\u201d</p><p>Natasha turned to him with a wicked grin.</p><p>Tony was pretty sure he had no blood left in his body.\u00a0\u201cThis is fine, okay-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I love that kid.\u201d Natasha gave Tony a bold look, which nearly made him faint.\u00a0<br/></p><p>They did not take the elephant home, and Peter got a long talking to about how showing their powers in public was not staying off the radar. Tony pretended like he didn\u2019t see the little fist bump Natasha gave Peter after his speech.</p><p>-</p><p>The second time Peter impressed Tony was when he had just come home from school. Peter had his back pack strapped to him, preoccupied with texting on his phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you get all your homework done at school?\u201d Tony asked, sitting at his work shop table, charting data.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Peter\u2019s mind seemed to be somewhere else, but Tony wasn\u2019t going to push it. He knew school could get exhausting. That\u2019s why he dropped out himself.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy is your back pack so full, then?\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter glanced up, letting his back pack fall to the ground with a thud. The concrete floor underneath it cracked in two, causing Tony\u2019s jaw to drop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got bricks in it.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony was at a loss for words.\u00a0\u201cB&hellip;<i>bricks</i>? Why the <i>hell</i> would you have bricks in your back pack?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter shrugged.\u00a0\u201cScience project with Ned.

He knew they were on Peter, with his Iron Man shirt on that still had the tags on it. Nobody had the heart to tell him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tony shrugged, keeping his arms crossed.&nbsp;&ldquo;The Avengers could use a day out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing nearly ten feet away just so people won&rsquo;t touch you, and you absolutely <i>hate</i> being out in public if the attention isn&rsquo;t directed towards you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tony tilted his head, as if letting the thought roll throughout his mind.&nbsp;&ldquo;Point taken.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony had sworn him and Natasha had only been mumbling to one another for a moment, when Natasha&rsquo;s breath caught in her throat. It was hard to hear, but Tony always knew when something was wrong with her. She was never phased by anything.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony snapped to attention, watching as Peter Parker held up an elephant. <i>Off the ground</i>. Peter was <i>holding it.</i> <i>Like it was nothing</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Look Mr. Stark!&rdquo; Peter waved with his other hand-he was holding an elephant with one hand, <i>oh my god</i>-and grinned.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my new pet!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Other people in the crowd we&rsquo;re starting to become alarmed, while smaller children giggled and cheered.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony could feel himself losing color in his face, trying to stay calm.&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, okay, this is cool, okay-&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha turned to him with a wicked grin.</p><p>Tony was pretty sure he had no blood left in his body.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is fine, okay-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Man, I love that kid.&rdquo; Natasha gave Tony a bold look, which nearly made him faint.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>They did not take the elephant home, and Peter got a long talking to about how showing their powers in public was not staying off the radar. Tony pretended like he didn&rsquo;t see the little fist bump Natasha gave Peter after his speech.</p><p>-</p><p>The second time Peter impressed Tony was when he had just come home from school. Peter had his back pack strapped to him, preoccupied with texting on his phone.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you get all your homework done at school?&rdquo; Tony asked, sitting at his work shop table, charting data.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s mind seemed to be somewhere else, but Tony wasn&rsquo;t going to push it. He knew school could get exhausting. That&rsquo;s why he dropped out himself.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why is your back pack so full, then?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter glanced up, letting his back pack fall to the ground with a thud. The concrete floor underneath it cracked in two, causing Tony&rsquo;s jaw to drop.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got bricks in it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Tony was at a loss for words.&nbsp;&ldquo;B&hellip;<i>bricks</i>? Why the <i>hell</i> would you have bricks in your back pack?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Peter shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Science project with Ned. Sorry about the floor, though.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shook his head, whispering,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>What the fuc</i>k.&rdquo;</p><p>Impressive was one way to describe it. Terrifying was another.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;So, did you just <i>forget</i> to mention to me that you can lift ten tons or possibly more?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyebrows were knitted together, frustration seeping into his voice.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean, sometimes I forget.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It comes with the spider bite, Mr. Stark. Everything I do is just&hellip;natural to me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Tony walked around Peter sitting on the examination table.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you can lift at least ten tons, then that&rsquo;s like-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Almost enough to lift the weight of my sins, yes.&rdquo; Peter looked like he was tearing up, looking at his forgotten game system peeking out of his bag.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>Error 404</i>, Tony Stark not responding.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;W&hellip;what? Kid, what in the hell are you talking about now?&rdquo; Tony spluttered, blinking.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bad father,&rdquo; Peter shook his head, actual despair taken over his expression.&nbsp;&ldquo;I left my Nintendogs to die.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>It took a lot to make Tony speechless, but this kid was doing the best job of it. Tony looked up what Nintendogs were that night, and nearly marched over to Peter&rsquo;s house just to whap him with a newspaper. Almost.</p><p>-</p><p>Thor had seen Peter around the compound, but he honestly thought he was just Tony&rsquo;s kid who hung around to get his autograph and eat their food.&nbsp;</p><p>Thor wasn&rsquo;t aware that Peter actually had powers. So when they were working in the battlefield together, watching aliens tear apart the world beneath them, Thor was rather confused as to why a kid was standing in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Thor started, leaning over so only Tony could hear him over the blasts around them.&nbsp;&ldquo;What is this child doing on the battlefield?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>They both watched as Peter picked up the hulk-who weighed god knows how much-and straight up <i>threw</i> him at the oncoming hoard of aliens.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Angry Shrek attack!&rdquo; Peter shouted, which made Tony want to crawl into a hole and die.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Thor continued to blink, turning slowly to Tony.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nevermind.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony watched as the Hulk came back to high-five the kid, who seemed so small and fragile next to something as big as him.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony had a feeling if he hung out with Peter Parker any longer he was going to die of a heart attack. He figured he would just have to take that chance.&nbsp;</p>",

They really did.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tony caught himself doing it most of the time. He&rsquo;d think to himself, how could a sixteen year old kid save the world? Yet, Peter proved them all wrong every time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was impressive, yet terrifying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first instance had been at the zoo. Tony really hated the smell here, and the heat beating down on the back of his neck, but after Peter had suggested it, the other Avengers took to it quite well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clint had dragged Bruce away to the bat house, insisting that it was calm and quiet in there. Steve had followed just to be sure. Thor often wondered about by himself, but Tony had told him he was allowed to bring his brother this time as long as he didn&rsquo;t turn Thor into an animal. They all made bets on how long that would last.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Natasha was sipping a soda, leaning on Tony&rsquo;s shoulder, as if she could catch some of the shade being provided from Tony&rsquo;s hat. Peter was excitedly standing on his tip toes, trying to peak over a few kid&rsquo;s head to get a good look at the elephants.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
