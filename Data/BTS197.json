There\u2019s still so much thing to learn, both for you and for him about each other. He has an award show coming this Saturday and he wanted you to come with him. You do not think much about it because ever since he made the relationship public, you have yet to encounter a very negative comment. You immediately ended up agreeing. </p><p>The boys were walking down the red carpet while Jin was holding your hand to walk along with him. It hasn\u2019t hit you at first because the people who were standing near the entrance have been told to not use flash camera. But as you walked further down and as the sound of the professional camera\u2019s shutter became clearer, you knew you made a mistake for not thinking twice. </p><p>The boys stopped at the open area and numerous people from the media took their pictures. Poses after poses, the shouting of the fans, and the light from the camera, together with the warm weather, starting to get the best of you. You held Seokjin\u2019s hand tighter to make sure that he doesnot let go of you. Seokjin who realized your sudden action, felt a sudden surge of worry.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispered in your ears. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, Jinnie. I couldn\u2019t- the light, it\u2019s-\u201c to the fans, this might be a cute gesture. But Seokjin knew you were feeling worse than what you looked like because he could see you in the brink of tears. </p><p>\u201cHold my hand, okay, y/n,\u201d and you give him a small nod. Seokjin felt your body growing heavier on him. He knew it took all your strength just to stand by now. When the boys were instructed to enter the venue, Seokjin blew out the breath he didn\u2019t know he has been holding. </p><p>Right after you are out of reach of the camera, you started crying. You make sure no one heard it, and let out no voice. You just need to because you\u2019ve been holding it. Jin instructed the boys to sit first and signaled them that he\u2019s going later. He hugged you until your body stopped shaking and your knees were strong enough to stand again. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love,\u201d he said, lips kissing the top of your head. \u201cIf I knew you hated that I could-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I also didn\u2019t think about it either. It\u2019s neither on me or you.\u201d you smiled to him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you are okay next time. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Seokjin left a short kiss on your lips before holding you even tighter than before and entered the venue, ready to conquer the night. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"yoonggi:Lq_WsOzt4wu9EOn-OGpHxw:ZLYHXn2afNMLT\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1b7a6a0a7045d609316b622805b026/tumblr_pd64ogh0GJ1tbd5x7o1_540.gif\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1b7a6a0a7045d609316b622805b026/tumblr_inline_phtty8Q0T21vd61i1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1b7a6a0a7045d609316b622805b026/tumblr_pd64ogh0GJ1tbd5x7o1_540.gif\"/></figure><p><b><i>Yoongi</i></b></p><p>Yoongi was not there when it happened. The moment you stepped out of the car, the media started to crowd around the boys, seperating you from Yoongi. </p><p>Yoongi told you that there\u2019s a big award show coming the day after tomorrow and he wanted you to attend it with him. He knew you will most probably reject him right away but you succumbed to his sweater paws and pout. But he doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s also another reason to why you will reject him. </p><p>Before the show, you kept on regulating your breath, breathing in and out to make yourself calm; telling yourself it is just flashes from camera. What you didn\u2019t expect, however, is being seperated right after you stepped out of the car. </p><p>Flashes were coming from all directions and there are some fans who kept on shouting your name. You tried to avoid the camera and went straight in, passing the boys who are still being interviewed; hoping that you\u2019ll get through it to the venue. Yoongi\u2019s eyes were on you the whole time, hating that you were seperated from him. </p><p>But when an interviewer came in front of you and started to throw you questions, you could just hope that your body doesn\u2019t shake that much on the camera. When they finally let you go, you ran to the venue and quickly went in BTS\u2019 dressing room. </p><p>\u201cY/n, are you okay, do you need anything?\u201d one of the staff approached you and you shook your head. He went away, knowing that you need some time alone, after you thanked him. </p><p>You heard someone opening the dressing room\u2019s door abruptly. Yoongi\u2019s eyes search for you. When he saw you sitting in front of the mirror, looking at your reflection blankly, he knew he shouldn\u2019t have brought you here; but why?</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d he called gently and you turned around to face him. </p><p>\u201cI- why are you here. I\u2019m so sorry, I should have insisted you coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Yoongi. It\u2019s just- it\u2019s just the flash from the camera. I hated them and there\u2019s- there are- so many of- them just now,\u201d your voice started shaking. You didn\u2019t want to cry now. Yoongi probably think it as something stupid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s such a stupid thing,\u201d you chuckled while wiping of the tears with your hand. Yoongi turned the chair and were now on your sitting level. He brought you to a hug, while you continue crying.</p><p>\u201cIt is not stupid. You hated it, if you hate it, it\u2019s not stupid. I\u2019m sorry, love, I should- I should have been there,\u201d you could sense how guilty yoongi is from his tone. </p><p>\u201cYou should go. I\u2019ll stay until I calm down and I\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be out there with the boys, Yoongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys are okay waiting out there for me. You are not. I am staying with you until you\u2019ve calmed down and we\u2019ll go together.\u201d his thumb caressing your hand trying to soothe you. \u201cYou need a touch on your make-up again, anyway.\u201d You both laughed at how Yoongi can break the heavy atmosphere and still made you laughed even when you felt like a complete failure.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Yoongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, love.

The second knock came with a very familiar voice, calling your name, \u201cy/n, are you in there?\u201d </p><p>You didn\u2019t want to answer him because you know your voice will sound terrible.

There\u2019s still so much thing to learn, both for you and for him about each other. He has an award show coming this Saturday and he wanted you to come with him. You do not think much about it because ever since he made the relationship public, you have yet to encounter a very negative comment. You immediately ended up agreeing. </p><p>The boys were walking down the red carpet while Jin was holding your hand to walk along with him. It hasn\u2019t hit you at first because the people who were standing near the entrance have been told to not use flash camera. But as you walked further down and as the sound of the professional camera\u2019s shutter became clearer, you knew you made a mistake for not thinking twice. </p><p>The boys stopped at the open area and numerous people from the media took their pictures. Poses after poses, the shouting of the fans, and the light from the camera, together with the warm weather, starting to get the best of you. You held Seokjin\u2019s hand tighter to make sure that he doesnot let go of you. Seokjin who realized your sudden action, felt a sudden surge of worry.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispered in your ears. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, Jinnie. I couldn\u2019t- the light, it\u2019s-\u201c to the fans, this might be a cute gesture. But Seokjin knew you were feeling worse than what you looked like because he could see you in the brink of tears. </p><p>\u201cHold my hand, okay, y/n,\u201d and you give him a small nod. Seokjin felt your body growing heavier on him. He knew it took all your strength just to stand by now. When the boys were instructed to enter the venue, Seokjin blew out the breath he didn\u2019t know he has been holding. </p><p>Right after you are out of reach of the camera, you started crying. You make sure no one heard it, and let out no voice. You just need to because you\u2019ve been holding it. Jin instructed the boys to sit first and signaled them that he\u2019s going later. He hugged you until your body stopped shaking and your knees were strong enough to stand again. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love,\u201d he said, lips kissing the top of your head. \u201cIf I knew you hated that I could-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I also didn\u2019t think about it either. It\u2019s neither on me or you.\u201d you smiled to him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you are okay next time. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Seokjin left a short kiss on your lips before holding you even tighter than before and entered the venue, ready to conquer the night. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"yoonggi:Lq_WsOzt4wu9EOn-OGpHxw:ZLYHXn2afNMLT\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1b7a6a0a7045d609316b622805b026/tumblr_pd64ogh0GJ1tbd5x7o1_540.gif\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1b7a6a0a7045d609316b622805b026/tumblr_inline_phtty8Q0T21vd61i1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1b7a6a0a7045d609316b622805b026/tumblr_pd64ogh0GJ1tbd5x7o1_540.gif\"></figure><p><b><i>Yoongi</i></b></p><p>Yoongi was not there when it happened. The moment you stepped out of the car, the media started to crowd around the boys, seperating you from Yoongi. </p><p>Yoongi told you that there\u2019s a big award show coming the day after tomorrow and he wanted you to attend it with him. He knew you will most probably reject him right away but you succumbed to his sweater paws and pout. But he doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s also another reason to why you will reject him. </p><p>Before the show, you kept on regulating your breath, breathing in and out to make yourself calm; telling yourself it is just flashes from camera. What you didn\u2019t expect, however, is being seperated right after you stepped out of the car. </p><p>Flashes were coming from all directions and there are some fans who kept on shouting your name. You tried to avoid the camera and went straight in, passing the boys who are still being interviewed; hoping that you\u2019ll get through it to the venue. Yoongi\u2019s eyes were on you the whole time, hating that you were seperated from him. </p><p>But when an interviewer came in front of you and started to throw you questions, you could just hope that your body doesn\u2019t shake that much on the camera. When they finally let you go, you ran to the venue and quickly went in BTS\u2019 dressing room. </p><p>\u201cY/n, are you okay, do you need anything?\u201d one of the staff approached you and you shook your head. He went away, knowing that you need some time alone, after you thanked him. </p><p>You heard someone opening the dressing room\u2019s door abruptly. Yoongi\u2019s eyes search for you. When he saw you sitting in front of the mirror, looking at your reflection blankly, he knew he shouldn\u2019t have brought you here; but why?</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d he called gently and you turned around to face him. </p><p>\u201cI- why are you here. I\u2019m so sorry, I should have insisted you coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Yoongi. It\u2019s just- it\u2019s just the flash from the camera. I hated them and there\u2019s- there are- so many of- them just now,\u201d your voice started shaking. You didn\u2019t want to cry now. Yoongi probably think it as something stupid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s such a stupid thing,\u201d you chuckled while wiping of the tears with your hand. Yoongi turned the chair and were now on your sitting level. He brought you to a hug, while you continue crying.</p><p>\u201cIt is not stupid. You hated it, if you hate it, it\u2019s not stupid. I\u2019m sorry, love, I should- I should have been there,\u201d you could sense how guilty yoongi is from his tone. </p><p>\u201cYou should go.

There\u2019s still so much thing to learn, both for you and for him about each other. He has an award show coming this Saturday and he wanted you to come with him. You do not think much about it because ever since he made the relationship public, you have yet to encounter a very negative comment. You immediately ended up agreeing. </p><p>The boys were walking down the red carpet while Jin was holding your hand to walk along with him. It hasn\u2019t hit you at first because the people who were standing near the entrance have been told to not use flash camera. But as you walked further down and as the sound of the professional camera\u2019s shutter became clearer, you knew you made a mistake for not thinking twice. </p><p>The boys stopped at the open area and numerous people from the media took their pictures. Poses after poses, the shouting of the fans, and the light from the camera, together with the warm weather, starting to get the best of you. You held Seokjin\u2019s hand tighter to make sure that he doesnot let go of you. Seokjin who realized your sudden action, felt a sudden surge of worry.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispered in your ears. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, Jinnie. I couldn\u2019t- the light, it\u2019s-\u201c to the fans, this might be a cute gesture. But Seokjin knew you were feeling worse than what you looked like because he could see you in the brink of tears. </p><p>\u201cHold my hand, okay, y/n,\u201d and you give him a small nod. Seokjin felt your body growing heavier on him. He knew it took all your strength just to stand by now. When the boys were instructed to enter the venue, Seokjin blew out the breath he didn\u2019t know he has been holding. </p><p>Right after you are out of reach of the camera, you started crying. You make sure no one heard it, and let out no voice. You just need to because you\u2019ve been holding it. Jin instructed the boys to sit first and signaled them that he\u2019s going later. He hugged you until your body stopped shaking and your knees were strong enough to stand again. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love,\u201d he said, lips kissing the top of your head. \u201cIf I knew you hated that I could-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I also didn\u2019t think about it either. It\u2019s neither on me or you.\u201d you smiled to him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you are okay next time. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Seokjin left a short kiss on your lips before holding you even tighter than before and entered the venue, ready to conquer the night. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"yoonggi:Lq_WsOzt4wu9EOn-OGpHxw:ZLYHXn2afNMLT\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1b7a6a0a7045d609316b622805b026/tumblr_pd64ogh0GJ1tbd5x7o1_540.gif\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1b7a6a0a7045d609316b622805b026/tumblr_inline_phtty8Q0T21vd61i1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e1b7a6a0a7045d609316b622805b026/tumblr_pd64ogh0GJ1tbd5x7o1_540.gif\"></figure><p><b><i>Yoongi</i></b></p><p>Yoongi was not there when it happened. The moment you stepped out of the car, the media started to crowd around the boys, seperating you from Yoongi. </p><p>Yoongi told you that there\u2019s a big award show coming the day after tomorrow and he wanted you to attend it with him. He knew you will most probably reject him right away but you succumbed to his sweater paws and pout. But he doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s also another reason to why you will reject him. </p><p>Before the show, you kept on regulating your breath, breathing in and out to make yourself calm; telling yourself it is just flashes from camera. What you didn\u2019t expect, however, is being seperated right after you stepped out of the car. </p><p>Flashes were coming from all directions and there are some fans who kept on shouting your name. You tried to avoid the camera and went straight in, passing the boys who are still being interviewed; hoping that you\u2019ll get through it to the venue. Yoongi\u2019s eyes were on you the whole time, hating that you were seperated from him. </p><p>But when an interviewer came in front of you and started to throw you questions, you could just hope that your body doesn\u2019t shake that much on the camera. When they finally let you go, you ran to the venue and quickly went in BTS\u2019 dressing room. </p><p>\u201cY/n, are you okay, do you need anything?\u201d one of the staff approached you and you shook your head. He went away, knowing that you need some time alone, after you thanked him. </p><p>You heard someone opening the dressing room\u2019s door abruptly. Yoongi\u2019s eyes search for you. When he saw you sitting in front of the mirror, looking at your reflection blankly, he knew he shouldn\u2019t have brought you here; but why?</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d he called gently and you turned around to face him. </p><p>\u201cI- why are you here. I\u2019m so sorry, I should have insisted you coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Yoongi. It\u2019s just- it\u2019s just the flash from the camera. I hated them and there\u2019s- there are- so many of- them just now,\u201d your voice started shaking. You didn\u2019t want to cry now. Yoongi probably think it as something stupid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s such a stupid thing,\u201d you chuckled while wiping of the tears with your hand. Yoongi turned the chair and were now on your sitting level. He brought you to a hug, while you continue crying.</p><p>\u201cIt is not stupid. You hated it, if you hate it, it\u2019s not stupid. I\u2019m sorry, love, I should- I should have been there,\u201d you could sense how guilty yoongi is from his tone. </p><p>\u201cYou should go. I\u2019ll stay until I calm down and I\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be out there with the boys, Yoongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys are okay waiting out there for me. You are not. I am staying with you until you\u2019ve calmed down and we\u2019ll go together.\u201d his thumb caressing your hand trying to soothe you. \u201cYou need a touch on your make-up again, anyway.\u201d You both laughed at how Yoongi can break the heavy atmosphere and still made you laughed even when you felt like a complete failure.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Yoongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, love. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"277\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"1lsans:aabwMixSNDlUqh1wQwAtqA:ZNaSxu2NuIW62\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e49dab998c782a4cda3a0570a84cedbb/tumblr_ot7t6w5ts71rzcklqo1_540.gif\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e49dab998c782a4cda3a0570a84cedbb/tumblr_inline_phtty9Dsx71vd61i1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"277\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e49dab998c782a4cda3a0570a84cedbb/tumblr_ot7t6w5ts71rzcklqo1_540.gif\"></figure><p><b><i>Hoseok</i></b></p><p>You have made your relationship public for a long time, but this was actually the first time where Hoseok and you will be in front of the public formally. You have told him that you didn\u2019t want to walk the red carped with him because you didn\u2019t want your presence to disturb them. Although hobi had insisted that you don\u2019t, you still managed to slip away. </p><p>BTS were scheduled to perform next, when you started to hear camera shutters. You thought everything will be alright but when the sudden flash came in contact with your eyes, you thought everything went black for a moment. You couldn\u2019t take off your eyes, off the flashing camera even though you tried to. </p><p>With your shaking body, you excused yourself to the restroom, not coming out until Hoseok found you. You have never told him you were afraid of camera flash, it is nonsense for an adult to be afraid of such thing. But you couldn\u2019t help yourself but felt anxious whenever someone uses the flash from their camera. </p><p>BTS performed well, that\u2019s what you thought, and they did. You could hear Idol, then fake love, then I\u2019m Fine playing from outside the restroom. You were glad that no one knocked on yur door while you\u2019re in there.</p><p>The boys went back to their seats and Jungkook told Hoseok that you were no where to be found. Hoseok thought that you went to the batroom, but when you haven\u2019t come back after 15 minutes, he made his way there. </p><p>The first knock on the door. You didn\u2019t anwer, thinking that it might be some random people. The second knock came with a very familiar voice, calling your name, \u201cy/n, are you in there?\u201d </p><p>You didn\u2019t want to answer him because you know your voice will sound terrible. After the forth knock when you thought Hoseok stopped trying, you phone rings instead. He was calling you. </p><p>\u201cOpen the door, y/n. I know you\u2019re in there.\u201d You stood up and unlocked the door for him. Hoseok opened the door, slowly revealing your pathetic form. </p><p>\u201cWhat- what happened, love?\u201d his heart dropped when he saw tear trails on your cheek. Eyes red from crying.</p><p>\u201cI miss your stage, Hobi. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d You started to cry again when you realized you really have just missed out your boyfriend live stage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, y/n. <i>Sho</i> <i>sho</i>, hey, princess, tell me what happened? Did anyone hurt you? Do you feel pain anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s-it\u2019s just someone took a picture on me just now and the sudden light from the camera, I just don\u2019t really- I don\u2019t really like it.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok was shocked at your statement. He never knew you hated camera flash, this is also the reason why you have declined his invitation to walk the red carpet with him. </p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay now. It\u2019s okay now, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I missed your performance, I should have stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not blame yourself. You didn\u2019t do it on purpose, you hear me?\u201d Hoseok was smiling, he was still that sunshine you know. His sole presence calmed you almost immediately. </p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s see that smile on your face. That\u2019s it.\u201d You stayed in the bathroom for a while before Hoseok lead you out of it, while walking back, you could hear him, whispering to you, \u201cPlease tell me if you are scared of something, y/n. I didn\u2019t want you to feel like that again.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tae-eyebrows:_rru7GEaQE4Hcc1OTOFawg:ZgAb9o2KhFVLc\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33057db9a8a8158b8bb8157ccdeaa10f/tumblr_ooiaoiy8IA1tvsbazo1_400.gif\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33057db9a8a8158b8bb8157ccdeaa10f/tumblr_inline_phtty9bi8n1vd61i1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33057db9a8a8158b8bb8157ccdeaa10f/tumblr_ooiaoiy8IA1tvsbazo1_400.gif\"></figure><p><i><b>Namjoon</b></i></p><p>Namjoon knew you dislike taking picture, but he doesn\u2019t know that you hated the flash that might come together with the camera. When Namjoon told you that he wanted you to walk down the red carpet with him for the upcoming award show, you almost choked yourself with the chicken wings you\u2019re eating. </p><p>You didn\u2019t want to reject him, but you couldn\u2019t imagine walking down that red carpet with numerous camera taking photos of you with flash. But because Namjoon said please do it for him, you agree to it. </p><p>You were holding Namjoon\u2019s hand the whole time, trying to smile to the media and the fans. You kept that smile on your lips, trying to answer all the question asked to you. </p><p>BTS were performing first, so instead of heading to their seats, they went to the dressing room. The moment you were inside, you remembered all the flashes and the sound of camera\u2019s shutters, and again the flashes. Your breath became shorter and the chill room became warm. The next thing you remembered is Namjoon calling your name before everything turns black. </p><p>When you were awake, only the staff were there. They told you that you passed out earlier and the boys are now performing. </p><p>\u201cYou want water, y/n?\u201d One of the staff offered you water. \u201cYes, please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTheir stage will end soon, so, don\u2019t worry, Namjoon will be here.\u201d And he was right. Namjoon came rushing in the dressing room with heavy breath and sweat. You could see how he\u2019s still trying to catch his breath while heaving a sigh of relieve to your conscious figure.</p><p>\u201cYou made me worry sick,\u201d he said, holding both of your hand instead of hugging you. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you didn\u2019t feel well?

But as you walked further down and as the sound of the professional camera&rsquo;s shutter became clearer, you knew you made a mistake for not thinking twice. </p><p>The boys stopped at the open area and numerous people from the media took their pictures. Poses after poses, the shouting of the fans, and the light from the camera, together with the warm weather, starting to get the best of you. You held Seokjin&rsquo;s hand tighter to make sure that he doesnot let go of you. Seokjin who realized your sudden action, felt a sudden surge of worry.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; he whispered in your ears. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, Jinnie. I couldn&rsquo;t- the light, it&rsquo;s-&ldquo; to the fans, this might be a cute gesture. But Seokjin knew you were feeling worse than what you looked like because he could see you in the brink of tears. </p><p>&ldquo;Hold my hand, okay, y/n,&rdquo; and you give him a small nod. Seokjin felt your body growing heavier on him. He knew it took all your strength just to stand by now. When the boys were instructed to enter the venue, Seokjin blew out the breath he didn&rsquo;t know he has been holding. </p><p>Right after you are out of reach of the camera, you started crying. You make sure no one heard it, and let out no voice. You just need to because you&rsquo;ve been holding it. Jin instructed the boys to sit first and signaled them that he&rsquo;s going later. He hugged you until your body stopped shaking and your knees were strong enough to stand again. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, love,&rdquo; he said, lips kissing the top of your head. &ldquo;If I knew you hated that I could-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I also didn&rsquo;t think about it either. It&rsquo;s neither on me or you.&rdquo; you smiled to him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure you are okay next time. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Seokjin left a short kiss on your lips before holding you even tighter than before and entered the venue, ready to conquer the night. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b><i>Yoongi</i></b></p><p>Yoongi was not there when it happened. The moment you stepped out of the car, the media started to crowd around the boys, seperating you from Yoongi. </p><p>Yoongi told you that there&rsquo;s a big award show coming the day after tomorrow and he wanted you to attend it with him. He knew you will most probably reject him right away but you succumbed to his sweater paws and pout. But he doesn&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s also another reason to why you will reject him. </p><p>Before the show, you kept on regulating your breath, breathing in and out to make yourself calm; telling yourself it is just flashes from camera. What you didn&rsquo;t expect, however, is being seperated right after you stepped out of the car. </p><p>Flashes were coming from all directions and there are some fans who kept on shouting your name. You tried to avoid the camera and went straight in, passing the boys who are still being interviewed; hoping that you&rsquo;ll get through it to the venue. Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes were on you the whole time, hating that you were seperated from him. </p><p>But when an interviewer came in front of you and started to throw you questions, you could just hope that your body doesn&rsquo;t shake that much on the camera. When they finally let you go, you ran to the venue and quickly went in BTS&rsquo; dressing room. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, are you okay, do you need anything?&rdquo; one of the staff approached you and you shook your head. He went away, knowing that you need some time alone, after you thanked him. </p><p>You heard someone opening the dressing room&rsquo;s door abruptly. Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes search for you. When he saw you sitting in front of the mirror, looking at your reflection blankly, he knew he shouldn&rsquo;t have brought you here; but why?</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; he called gently and you turned around to face him. </p><p>&ldquo;I- why are you here. I&rsquo;m so sorry, I should have insisted you coming with us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault, Yoongi. It&rsquo;s just- it&rsquo;s just the flash from the camera. I hated them and there&rsquo;s- there are- so many of- them just now,&rdquo; your voice started shaking. You didn&rsquo;t want to cry now. Yoongi probably think it as something stupid.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s such a stupid thing,&rdquo; you chuckled while wiping of the tears with your hand. Yoongi turned the chair and were now on your sitting level. He brought you to a hug, while you continue crying.</p><p>&ldquo;It is not stupid. You hated it, if you hate it, it&rsquo;s not stupid. I&rsquo;m sorry, love, I should- I should have been there,&rdquo; you could sense how guilty yoongi is from his tone. </p><p>&ldquo;You should go. I&rsquo;ll stay until I calm down and I&rsquo;ll join you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should be out there with the boys, Yoongs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The boys are okay waiting out there for me. You are not. I am staying with you until you&rsquo;ve calmed down and we&rsquo;ll go together.&rdquo; his thumb caressing your hand trying to soothe you. &ldquo;You need a touch on your make-up again, anyway.&rdquo; You both laughed at how Yoongi can break the heavy atmosphere and still made you laughed even when you felt like a complete failure.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Yoongs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, love. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b><i>Hoseok</i></b></p><p>You have made your relationship public for a long time, but this was actually the first time where Hoseok and you will be in front of the public formally. You have told him that you didn&rsquo;t want to walk the red carped with him because you didn&rsquo;t want your presence to disturb them. Although hobi had insisted that you don&rsquo;t, you still managed to slip away. </p><p>BTS were scheduled to perform next, when you started to hear camera shutters. You thought everything will be alright but when the sudden flash came in contact with your eyes, you thought everything went black for a moment. You couldn&rsquo;t take off your eyes, off the flashing camera even though you tried to. </p><p>With your shaking body, you excused yourself to the restroom, not coming out until Hoseok found you. You have never told him you were afraid of camera flash, it is nonsense for an adult to be afraid of such thing. But you couldn&rsquo;t help yourself but felt anxious whenever someone uses the flash from their camera. </p><p>BTS performed well, that&rsquo;s what you thought, and they did. You could hear Idol, then fake love, then I&rsquo;m Fine playing from outside the restroom. You were glad that no one knocked on yur door while you&rsquo;re in there.</p><p>The boys went back to their seats and Jungkook told Hoseok that you were no where to be found. Hoseok thought that you went to the batroom, but when you haven&rsquo;t come back after 15 minutes, he made his way there. </p><p>The first knock on the door. You didn&rsquo;t anwer, thinking that it might be some random people. The second knock came with a very familiar voice, calling your name, &ldquo;y/n, are you in there?&rdquo; </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t want to answer him because you know your voice will sound terrible. After the forth knock when you thought Hoseok stopped trying, you phone rings instead. He was calling you. </p><p>&ldquo;Open the door, y/n. I know you&rsquo;re in there.&rdquo; You stood up and unlocked the door for him. Hoseok opened the door, slowly revealing your pathetic form. </p><p>&ldquo;What- what happened, love?&rdquo; his heart dropped when he saw tear trails on your cheek. Eyes red from crying.</p><p>&ldquo;I miss your stage, Hobi. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; You started to cry again when you realized you really have just missed out your boyfriend live stage.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, y/n. <i>Sho</i> <i>sho</i>, hey, princess, tell me what happened? Did anyone hurt you? Do you feel pain anywhere?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s just someone took a picture on me just now and the sudden light from the camera, I just don&rsquo;t really- I don&rsquo;t really like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok was shocked at your statement. He never knew you hated camera flash, this is also the reason why you have declined his invitation to walk the red carpet with him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay now. It&rsquo;s okay now, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry I missed your performance, I should have stayed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not blame yourself. You didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose, you hear me?&rdquo; Hoseok was smiling, he was still that sunshine you know. His sole presence calmed you almost immediately. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see that smile on your face. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; You stayed in the bathroom for a while before Hoseok lead you out of it, while walking back, you could hear him, whispering to you, &ldquo;Please tell me if you are scared of something, y/n. I didn&rsquo;t want you to feel like that again.&rdquo;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><i><b>Namjoon</b></i></p><p>Namjoon knew you dislike taking picture, but he doesn&rsquo;t know that you hated the flash that might come together with the camera. When Namjoon told you that he wanted you to walk down the red carpet with him for the upcoming award show, you almost choked yourself with the chicken wings you&rsquo;re eating. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t want to reject him, but you couldn&rsquo;t imagine walking down that red carpet with numerous camera taking photos of you with flash. But because Namjoon said please do it for him, you agree to it. </p><p>You were holding Namjoon&rsquo;s hand the whole time, trying to smile to the media and the fans. You kept that smile on your lips, trying to answer all the question asked to you. </p><p>BTS were performing first, so instead of heading to their seats, they went to the dressing room. The moment you were inside, you remembered all the flashes and the sound of camera&rsquo;s shutters, and again the flashes. Your breath became shorter and the chill room became warm. The next thing you remembered is Namjoon calling your name before everything turns black. </p><p>When you were awake, only the staff were there. They told you that you passed out earlier and the boys are now performing. </p><p>&ldquo;You want water, y/n?&rdquo; One of the staff offered you water. &ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Their stage will end soon, so, don&rsquo;t worry, Namjoon will be here.&rdquo; And he was right. Namjoon came rushing in the dressing room with heavy breath and sweat. You could see how he&rsquo;s still trying to catch his breath while heaving a sigh of relieve to your conscious figure.</p><p>&ldquo;You made me worry sick,&rdquo; he said, holding both of your hand instead of hugging you. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you didn&rsquo;t feel well? You could just rest at home.&rdquo; he said, sounded almost like he&rsquo;s angry.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not sick, Joonie. I am okay when I left home&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you tell me you&rsquo;re not okay when we were in the car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not okay when we were interviewed, Joon. I- I didn&rsquo;t hate the camera or taking pictures, I hated the flash that comes with it. Whenever I see them, my vision went blury.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should have told me, y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I just feel like you don&rsquo;t need to know this. It&rsquo;s not important anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not important? You passing out today because of thag is not important?&rdquo; Namjoon let out a sigh, he didn&rsquo;t mean to raise his voice, it just came out naturally because he was so worried.</p><p>&ldquo;I am worried sick, y/n. I- I just, let&rsquo;s talk about it later, okay?&rdquo; you nodded your head.</p><p>Namjoon is still holding onto your hand. &ldquo;You feel better now, do you want to go home?&rdquo; You shook your head. &ldquo;I want to stay,&rdquo; Namjoon smiled to your answer. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I raised my voice, y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I know what you mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about it once we&rsquo;re home okay? Under the blankets with RM and cuddles. Promise me you&rsquo;ll tell me everything you hated or dislike.&rdquo; </p></p>",
