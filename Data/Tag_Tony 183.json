She was abused for her uniqueness and forced to make her powers beneficial for others to be a weapon of mass destruction. Her\u00a0\u201cspecial/safe person\u201d was her brother, but he died for the very people she saw every single day after joining the Avengers. ever, single time she sees Clint (or any Avenger) she must remember his death. Then she falls in love with a robot guy, and to be fair he is lit. He is the sum of all humanity, Tony Stark\u2019s knowledge, innovation, Jarvis, and an infinity stone. She has the ability to match that in a HEALTHY relationship, despite her past. Then she is able to DESTROY an infinity stone, meaning she MATCHES its power. AND THEN she looses her boyfriend.\u00a0</p><p>And y\u2019all mad that she didn\u2019t just do away with Vision real quick to solve things. But if Steve had to kill off Bucky to secure a stone, would y\u2019all be ok with that? No.\u00a0</p><p>Because he\u2019s a\u00a0\u201creal\u201d person you all love. But heres the tea, Vision was real to Wanda and we didn\u2019t love him as much because he was lw under developed. But you know who did love him?
