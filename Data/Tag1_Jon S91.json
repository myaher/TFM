Daenerys had no faint clue as to why the boy was sheltered to the deepest end of the manor, but she thought that there had better of been a damned good reason for it.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>As Jon opened the door slowly, she could only feel growing disdain for the man beside her. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>The room was spacious, yes, but it was void of any color or life. The walls bare and black. The only clashing tones within the space were the light wooded furniture and the white of the bedding. The younger brother, she presumed, sitting directly across from the doorway and facing away from them as he wrote in his notebook; the single window across from him allowing light to shine through and onto his dark hair. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cRickon\u201d Jon said, trying to get his attention with a few light knocks onto the door.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>The boy did not turn from his position.

She couldn\u2019t help but feel her heart break at his dulled blue eyes. How different they were from the vibrant and cheerful eyes painted on the tapestry in the sitting room. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cHello Rickon\u201d Daenerys greeted warmly. She put on her best smile, the one she used to enrapture.

You seem very smart. I\u2019m here to keep you company while your brother is busy. Think of me-\u201c</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cI don\u2019t need your company. I have Bran to talk to. We go climbing sometimes.\u201d</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Daenerys missed the pained look on Jon\u2019s face. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cSo go away\u201d Rickon continued. \u201cI\u2019m not a freak.

Daenerys then found that he wasn\u2019t one of many and surprisingly found herself coming to his defense.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cYour brother doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re a freak, sweet child. He just doesn\u2019t want you to be alone while he works. He\u2019s sad that he can\u2019t spend time with you.\u201d</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Rickon turned to her with skeptical eyes. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. He thinks there\u2019s something wrong with me. I can see it when he looks at me.\u201d</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>She began to form another defense but was quickly beaten to the punch.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cI just want you to get help Rick. It\u2019s not right to always talk to the dead.\u201d</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Daenerys turned her violet eyes to him in anger but the man only kept his focus on his brother. Said brother simply gave Jon a narrowed eyed look before turning around and picking up his pencil once more.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Scribble. Scribble.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Jon gave a pained and sorrowful look before turning on his heel. He told his brother that he\u2019d inform him when it was time for lunch and walked off. Sensing the end of the conversation, and not wanting to overhear the boy on the first day, Daenerys slowly stood from her crouched position and made towards the door. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>She silently closed the door behind her and marched off in anger to track down the idiotic head of house. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>[End Sample Text]</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever write this fic. It\u2019s definitely in one of my most anticipated ones. I have plans on writing 3 fics that will be updated sporadically. Two of the three slots are already filled: \u2018A Dragon will Take Us Home\u2019 and \u2018The Hitman and The Dragon\u2019. Admittedly, the fic with the son of Jonerys that travelled in the past was supposed to be the third fic but I found that it was mainly a source of inspiration rather than passion. I didn\u2019t feel the urge to write it like I did the other two stories. Every time I have a new idea, I share it with the world because I can\u2019t go to sleep unless I \u201clet the thought out\u201d in some shape or form. </p>",

Scribble.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Jon cleared his throat.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Scribble. Scribble.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;Actually. I&rsquo;ve brought the doctor I told you about. She&rsquo;s here to help you.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Silence.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Rickon laid down his pencil and turned sideways in his his chair. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">When Jon stayed quiet, Daenerys took it as a queue to step forward.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Rickon kept his eyes trained on hers as she moved closer and closer to him. She couldn&rsquo;t help but feel her heart break at his dulled blue eyes. How different they were from the vibrant and cheerful eyes painted on the tapestry in the sitting room. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;Hello Rickon&rdquo; Daenerys greeted warmly. She put on her best smile, the one she used to enrapture. Her porcelain teeth accentuated by her red stained lips. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">The boy did let down his cold guard.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need help&rdquo; Rickon said.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Daenerys&rsquo; smile faltered for a moment, at the venom in the boy&rsquo;s voice, but was quickly recovered. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;Of course not. You seem very smart. I&rsquo;m here to keep you company while your brother is busy. Think of me-&ldquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your company. I have Bran to talk to. We go climbing sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Daenerys missed the pained look on Jon&rsquo;s face. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;So go away&rdquo; Rickon continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a freak. Leave me alone.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you were a freak Rickon&rdquo; she said softly.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;No. But he thinks I am&rdquo; Rickon pointed to Jon. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Jon only shook his head but did not say any words. Daenerys then found that he wasn&rsquo;t one of many and surprisingly found herself coming to his defense.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;Your brother doesn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re a freak, sweet child. He just doesn&rsquo;t want you to be alone while he works. He&rsquo;s sad that he can&rsquo;t spend time with you.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Rickon turned to her with skeptical eyes. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. He thinks there&rsquo;s something wrong with me. I can see it when he looks at me.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">She began to form another defense but was quickly beaten to the punch.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;I just want you to get help Rick. It&rsquo;s not right to always talk to the dead.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Daenerys turned her violet eyes to him in anger but the man only kept his focus on his brother. Said brother simply gave Jon a narrowed eyed look before turning around and picking up his pencil once more.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Scribble. Scribble.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Jon gave a pained and sorrowful look before turning on his heel. He told his brother that he&rsquo;d inform him when it was time for lunch and walked off. Sensing the end of the conversation, and not wanting to overhear the boy on the first day, Daenerys slowly stood from her crouched position and made towards the door. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">She silently closed the door behind her and marched off in anger to track down the idiotic head of house. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">[End Sample Text]</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever write this fic. It&rsquo;s definitely in one of my most anticipated ones. I have plans on writing 3 fics that will be updated sporadically. Two of the three slots are already filled: &lsquo;A Dragon will Take Us Home&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Hitman and The Dragon&rsquo;. Admittedly, the fic with the son of Jonerys that travelled in the past was supposed to be the third fic but I found that it was mainly a source of inspiration rather than passion. I didn&rsquo;t feel the urge to write it like I did the other two stories. Every time I have a new idea, I share it with the world because I can&rsquo;t go to sleep unless I &ldquo;let the thought out&rdquo; in some shape or form. </p></p>",
