The garden had been more like a last resort for she&rsquo;d truly not expected to find him there. But there he was all the same. There in the gardens where the winter roses still yet bloomed, clearly still cared for by someone in Winterfell. And now that she found him there, just how obvious it was. Of course Jon was there, surrounded by the beautiful blooms. They were his mother&rsquo;s favorite flower, Sansa recalled her father saying Lyanna had always been enchanted by their lovely smell. Of course Jon would be there, if only to feel close to her.</p><p>He was alone on the bench with the lightest dusting of snow layered over his shoulders. Just how long had he been there? Sansa approached him quietly, noticing how his shoulders shook, telling her just how badly he was hurting. Not that she could blame him. How was one supposed to feel when you lived your whole life thinking you were someone, only to be told you were someone else?

He really IS too good for this world. In the books he's more crafty. If anything he's more of a Gary Stu in the books, since he's so clever he's able to advise kings on military strategy at 15/16, and he can also warg.

And there are some things he is not good at, so I beg to differ.</p><p>Jon mostly advises Stannis about who to approach in the North - and Jon should be knowledgable in this regard. He was raised at Winterfell, got the same teachers as Robb, so why wouldn\u2019t he know some things about a) military strategy and b) the alliances of the Northern Lords. And an intelligent 15/16 year old should be able to do that. He simply knows the North far better than Stannis does.<br/></p><p>As for warging, he is not yet even aware, that he does it and he is not very good at it. Bran and especially Arya are better at warging. <br/></p><p>Also, in the books he is not a great swordsman, not at all. He trains and trains because he wants to be worthy of the Valyrian blade he carries.</p><p>Do you know what he is also not good at? Seeing through intrigues and machinations. He is not a good politician in that regard. Although repeatedly warned about his enemies, he is simply to arrogant to appease some of the older Nightwatch man. <br/></p><p>You could also question his emotional intelligence. The baby switch was a cruel thing to do and he alienated Gilly for ever, I think. He still has to learn that he also needs the emotional support of his people - and I think he might never learn that, but will need Sansa for that. <br/></p><p>So, no, Jon is not a Gary Stue.<br/></p><p>I don\u2019t really think that Jon in the show is more self-sacrificing, because I do believe that Jon in the books will make the same decisions.

Enjoy~~~</p><h2><b>- Preview -</b></h2><p>\u201cAre you sure about this, my queen?\u201d Jon looked dubiously between Dany and the ginormous creature looming tall in front of him. Drogon was sniffing curiously at his face. A gust of his warm breath washed over Jon\u2019s body, chasing away the cold of winter momentarily.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jon. Drogon let you touch him, he trusts you.\u201d Dany gave him a shove, urging him to approach her child. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here with you.\u201d She gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cGo on!\u201d</p><p>Seeing his hesitance, Dany chuckled, rolling her eyes, giving her child a pet on the snout in thanks for being cooperative. Drogon purred contentedly. \u201cHere I thought you would be excited to experience what it\u2019s like to fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. It\u2019s just&hellip;\u201d Gently grabbing Dany\u2019s tiny hands in his, Jon asked: \u201cAre you serious in letting me ride one of your children? And into battle no less?\u201d</p><p>Squeezing his fingers and giving his arms a swing, Dany smiled sincerely at him. \u201cI am. It would be helpful when the time comes. You\u2019ll have more than one means of defeating the enemy, dragonfire and dragon glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not a Targaryen. It doesn\u2019t feel right. I feel as if I\u2019m barging in on something sacred that doesn\u2019t belong to me.\u201d Jon protested.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t Jon! There has been history of non Targaryen dragon riders in the past. Besides, I want you to.\u201d Plagued by sudden forlorn thoughts, Dany\u2019s eyebrows drew together as her lips were dragged down by a frown. Gazing down at their clasped hands, her voice came out small. \u201cYou\u2019ve already died for your people once. I don\u2019t want you to die again. I want you to survive, Jon Snow. You have to.\u201d </p><p><i>You have to for me.</i></p><p>Whatever this was between them was so new. They hadn\u2019t established what it really was yet. However, as the number of nights they spent together grew, they both knew something special was brewing, taking root in their hearts. They cared for each other deeply, way more than they\u2019ve ever cared for anyone before. They both knew it went deeper than just physical attraction. Was it love? It felt too soon to tell. They were getting there though, they both felt it.</p><p>Even without her voicing it, Jon could tell what she meant to say. He knew what she wanted to say because they were both thinking the same thing. \u201cYou have to survive as well. We both need to survive this. The people of Westeros need you.\u201d</p><p><i>I need you.</i></p><p>\u201cBut Dany, if something happens to Rheagal, I will never forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>Her tears of anguish for the death of her child, Viserion all those weeks ago were still clear in his mind. Seeing her lips wobble and her face crumple in despair was a stab to his heart. After spending weeks at Dragonstone in her presence, talking with her, learning about her, he had unknowingly come to care deeply for this elusive, maddeningly frustrating, intimidating, but very compassionate queen. He wished they\u2019d never gone over the Wall. Nothing was worth the loss of a child. He would carry the guilt of having a hand at leading to the demise of her child forever. \u201cI would do anything to erase what happened that day. I can\u2019t stand you losing another child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I wish I could bring him back too.\u201d Dany murmured, voice trembling slightly, tears blurring her vision. Her heart clenching tight as the images that fuelled her nightmares for so many nights flooded her mind once more. She saw him falling from the sky as he bled, could still hear his pained screams as he fell, plunging into the frozen icy depths of the lake. The cries of his brothers resounding in her ears and the sound of her own heart cracking in two much like the eggshells that housed her children as infants, cracking open to allow them entry to this world, this cruel world. With the cracking of her heart, her baby left this world forever. \u201cMaybe this time with an extra rider, it will guarantee both my children\u2019s survival.\u201d</p>",

Enjoy~~~</p><h2><b>- Preview -</b></h2><p>\u201cAre you sure about this, my queen?\u201d Jon looked dubiously between Dany and the ginormous creature looming tall in front of him. Drogon was sniffing curiously at his face. A gust of his warm breath washed over Jon\u2019s body, chasing away the cold of winter momentarily.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jon. Drogon let you touch him, he trusts you.\u201d Dany gave him a shove, urging him to approach her child. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here with you.\u201d She gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cGo on!\u201d</p><p>Seeing his hesitance, Dany chuckled, rolling her eyes, giving her child a pet on the snout in thanks for being cooperative. Drogon purred contentedly. \u201cHere I thought you would be excited to experience what it\u2019s like to fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Gently grabbing Dany\u2019s tiny hands in his, Jon asked: \u201cAre you serious in letting me ride one of your children? And into battle no less?\u201d</p><p>Squeezing his fingers and giving his arms a swing, Dany smiled sincerely at him. \u201cI am. It would be helpful when the time comes. You\u2019ll have more than one means of defeating the enemy, dragonfire and dragon glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not a Targaryen. It doesn\u2019t feel right. I feel as if I\u2019m barging in on something sacred that doesn\u2019t belong to me.\u201d Jon protested.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t Jon! There has been history of non Targaryen dragon riders in the past. Besides, I want you to.\u201d Plagued by sudden forlorn thoughts, Dany\u2019s eyebrows drew together as her lips were dragged down by a frown. Gazing down at their clasped hands, her voice came out small. \u201cYou\u2019ve already died for your people once. I don\u2019t want you to die again. I want you to survive, Jon Snow. You have to.\u201d </p><p><i>You have to for me.</i></p><p>Whatever this was between them was so new. They hadn\u2019t established what it really was yet. However, as the number of nights they spent together grew, they both knew something special was brewing, taking root in their hearts. They cared for each other deeply, way more than they\u2019ve ever cared for anyone before. They both knew it went deeper than just physical attraction. Was it love? It felt too soon to tell. They were getting there though, they both felt it.</p><p>Even without her voicing it, Jon could tell what she meant to say. He knew what she wanted to say because they were both thinking the same thing. \u201cYou have to survive as well. We both need to survive this. The people of Westeros need you.\u201d</p><p><i>I need you.</i></p><p>\u201cBut Dany, if something happens to Rheagal, I will never forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>Her tears of anguish for the death of her child, Viserion all those weeks ago were still clear in his mind. Seeing her lips wobble and her face crumple in despair was a stab to his heart. After spending weeks at Dragonstone in her presence, talking with her, learning about her, he had unknowingly come to care deeply for this elusive, maddeningly frustrating, intimidating, but very compassionate queen. He wished they\u2019d never gone over the Wall. Nothing was worth the loss of a child. He would carry the guilt of having a hand at leading to the demise of her child forever. \u201cI would do anything to erase what happened that day. I can\u2019t stand you losing another child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I wish I could bring him back too.\u201d Dany murmured, voice trembling slightly, tears blurring her vision. Her heart clenching tight as the images that fuelled her nightmares for so many nights flooded her mind once more. She saw him falling from the sky as he bled, could still hear his pained screams as he fell, plunging into the frozen icy depths of the lake. The cries of his brothers resounding in her ears and the sound of her own heart cracking in two much like the eggshells that housed her children as infants, cracking open to allow them entry to this world, this cruel world. With the cracking of her heart, her baby left this world forever. \u201cMaybe this time with an extra rider, it will guarantee both my children\u2019s survival.\u201d</p></p>",
