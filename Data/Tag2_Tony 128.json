I think that they will each get one of the following endings:\u00a0</p><p>-Death</p><p>- Abandonment of this timeline\u00a0</p><p>- Retirement</p><hr><p>Starting with the first one: Death.\u00a0</p><p>I think the one who will face this destiny is the one we least expect: THOR. The reason why I believe this is firstly that MARVEL has to kill one of the three in order to avoid being called out for never killing anyone and I think that Thor is the one we least expect. There are 5 things that I believe point to Thor being the one to die:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>1) He wasn\u2019t in Civil War so his life wasn\u2019t at stake then and the lighthearted tone of Ragnarok let us now from the start that he was not going to die. However, right at the end of Ragnarok we see the tone change with the appearance of Thanos.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2) Thor is obviously the most powerful avenger and the most capable of causing any damage to Thanos. Also, in terms of power he is the most similar to Captain Marvel who would serve as a valid replacement.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3)Everyone is focused on either Tony or Steve dying for each other which would mean that Thor being the one that sacrifices himself would be a twist.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4)In Ragnarok we saw Thor loose his father and his home and, in turn, find his power. In Infinity War we saw him loose his people and his brother and use his power to avenge them. He himself has said that he has nothing else to loose which means that he might be the most willing to stand up to Thanos.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"934\" data-orig-height=\"420\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/13a0e3dbb3531295c80308a690159a12/tumblr_inline_pn8q4dmUQ31tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"934\" data-orig-height=\"420\"/></figure><p>\u00a0I think that the destiny of each character will be decided based on how his story would finally come full circle. And how to make their ending less tragic by giving them what they have been looking for. Which brings me to the last point.</p><p>5) Thor began his journey through the MCU as an arrogant god who has no feelings for misgardians and through the years we have seen him care for them more and more.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"610\" data-orig-height=\"276\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a21fe755c06d90ec3e307b461aa87ac/tumblr_inline_pn8qgleT701tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"610\" data-orig-height=\"276\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1854\" data-orig-height=\"892\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebc7064438bcb37ac91f5925eab73171/tumblr_inline_pn8qgydrpn1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"1854\" data-orig-height=\"892\"/></figure><p>So I believe that a way to close his arc which involved him going from being arrogant and not caring for misgardians to being powefull and caring as well as selfless would be to have him sacrifice himself in order to allow others to live.\u00a0</p><hr><p>The next destiny would be: Abandonment of this timeline.\u00a0</p><p>I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that this ending belongs to Steve Rogers. A man out of his time. I believe that Steve Rogers arc through the movies was mostly related to him becoming a perfect soldier with a belief system who then had to question his beliefs and become a fugitive of the government. There are 3 main reasons that lead me to believe this might happen:\u00a0</p><p>1) The possibility of time travel. We know that time travel exists in the MCU as it was introduced with Dr Strange. We also know that there is a high possibility of it being used in Endgame to defeat Thanos as seen with the BTS photos showing a shooting of the battle of New York of 2012. This would mean that it is possible for Steve to decide as a sacrifice or as a way of retirement to go back in time to the 40\u2032s in order to avoid going into the ice and thus create a new alternate universe where Captain America never became an avenger and never missed his date with Peggy Carter.\u00a0</p><p>I believe reason 2 and 3 are related as one involves Steve\u2019s biggest wish and the other his biggest fear.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02) Steve\u2019s biggest fear. This is something that was first introduced in Avengers:Age of Ultron with both Wanda and Ultron himself. Wanda shows each of the Main 3 what we think is their biggest fear. However it might end up being an interpretation of their destiny when mixed with what scares them:\u00a0</p><p>Tony:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"878\" data-orig-height=\"868\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bbcca26b2b610a0d00045ea627b759bb/tumblr_inline_pn8se5V9Vy1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"878\" data-orig-height=\"868\"/></figure><p>Thor:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"358\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d459dfd2392b26b93bf9fc644f55265/tumblr_inline_pn8seg08i71tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"358\"/></figure><p>And, finally, Steve:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29a1e7a824c6a9247525760ee1fb8b54/tumblr_inline_pn8sivpnd91tt6aap_540.gif\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p>During this scene we see Steve watching himself going home but being unable to let go of his PTSD and the war which is also shown by Ultron\u2019s words.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"546\" data-orig-height=\"504\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8eb995b5262ccecf4949a41b7997ffcc/tumblr_inline_pn8sl6B26J1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"546\" data-orig-height=\"504\"/></figure><p>This all goes to show that Steve\u2019s biggest fear is never being able to let go of the war while his destiny could be to go back to his own time.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03) Steve\u2019s biggest wish. If we believe that his biggest fear is never letting go of the war and his biggest problem is that he is literally a man out of his time, then the best way to end his journey giving him and the fans the chance of healing and being at peace with his departure would be to send him back to his own time. Letting him live his remaining days with Peggy and fulfilling a dream that he told Tony in AoU wasn\u2019t for him but for the man he used to be.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"646\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dd5154127a5987f9afd71af57cb7420/tumblr_inline_pn8sqlxVXp1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"646\"/></figure><hr><p>And, finally: Retirement.\u00a0</p><p>This is partly wishful thinking and partly supported by evidence. It is known that Iron Man\u2019s journey as we know it is certainly coming to and end as RDJ is not set to be in any more Marvel movies and is choosing to step aside. However I think that there are 5 reasons which are also related and which lead me to think that he might survive.\u00a0</p><p>1) Tony Stark dying in Endgame is probably the most expected outcome.

I think that they will each get one of the following endings:\u00a0</p><p>-Death</p><p>- Abandonment of this timeline\u00a0</p><p>- Retirement</p><hr><p>Starting with the first one: Death.\u00a0</p><p>I think the one who will face this destiny is the one we least expect: THOR. The reason why I believe this is firstly that MARVEL has to kill one of the three in order to avoid being called out for never killing anyone and I think that Thor is the one we least expect. There are 5 things that I believe point to Thor being the one to die:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>1) He wasn\u2019t in Civil War so his life wasn\u2019t at stake then and the lighthearted tone of Ragnarok let us now from the start that he was not going to die. However, right at the end of Ragnarok we see the tone change with the appearance of Thanos.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2) Thor is obviously the most powerful avenger and the most capable of causing any damage to Thanos. Also, in terms of power he is the most similar to Captain Marvel who would serve as a valid replacement.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3)Everyone is focused on either Tony or Steve dying for each other which would mean that Thor being the one that sacrifices himself would be a twist.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4)In Ragnarok we saw Thor loose his father and his home and, in turn, find his power. In Infinity War we saw him loose his people and his brother and use his power to avenge them. He himself has said that he has nothing else to loose which means that he might be the most willing to stand up to Thanos.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"934\" data-orig-height=\"420\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/13a0e3dbb3531295c80308a690159a12/tumblr_inline_pn8q4dmUQ31tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"934\" data-orig-height=\"420\"></figure><p>\u00a0I think that the destiny of each character will be decided based on how his story would finally come full circle. And how to make their ending less tragic by giving them what they have been looking for.

A man out of his time. I believe that Steve Rogers arc through the movies was mostly related to him becoming a perfect soldier with a belief system who then had to question his beliefs and become a fugitive of the government. There are 3 main reasons that lead me to believe this might happen:\u00a0</p><p>1) The possibility of time travel. We know that time travel exists in the MCU as it was introduced with Dr Strange. We also know that there is a high possibility of it being used in Endgame to defeat Thanos as seen with the BTS photos showing a shooting of the battle of New York of 2012. This would mean that it is possible for Steve to decide as a sacrifice or as a way of retirement to go back in time to the 40\u2032s in order to avoid going into the ice and thus create a new alternate universe where Captain America never became an avenger and never missed his date with Peggy Carter.\u00a0</p><p>I believe reason 2 and 3 are related as one involves Steve\u2019s biggest wish and the other his biggest fear.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02) Steve\u2019s biggest fear. This is something that was first introduced in Avengers:Age of Ultron with both Wanda and Ultron himself. Wanda shows each of the Main 3 what we think is their biggest fear. However it might end up being an interpretation of their destiny when mixed with what scares them:\u00a0</p><p>Tony:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"878\" data-orig-height=\"868\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bbcca26b2b610a0d00045ea627b759bb/tumblr_inline_pn8se5V9Vy1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"878\" data-orig-height=\"868\"></figure><p>Thor:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"358\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d459dfd2392b26b93bf9fc644f55265/tumblr_inline_pn8seg08i71tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"358\"></figure><p>And, finally, Steve:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29a1e7a824c6a9247525760ee1fb8b54/tumblr_inline_pn8sivpnd91tt6aap_540.gif\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p>During this scene we see Steve watching himself going home but being unable to let go of his PTSD and the war which is also shown by Ultron\u2019s words.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"546\" data-orig-height=\"504\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8eb995b5262ccecf4949a41b7997ffcc/tumblr_inline_pn8sl6B26J1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"546\" data-orig-height=\"504\"></figure><p>This all goes to show that Steve\u2019s biggest fear is never being able to let go of the war while his destiny could be to go back to his own time.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03) Steve\u2019s biggest wish.

Letting him live his remaining days with Peggy and fulfilling a dream that he told Tony in AoU wasn\u2019t for him but for the man he used to be.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"646\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dd5154127a5987f9afd71af57cb7420/tumblr_inline_pn8sqlxVXp1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"646\"></figure><hr><p>And, finally: Retirement.\u00a0</p><p>This is partly wishful thinking and partly supported by evidence.

However, right at the end of Ragnarok we see the tone change with the appearance of Thanos.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2) Thor is obviously the most powerful avenger and the most capable of causing any damage to Thanos. Also, in terms of power he is the most similar to Captain Marvel who would serve as a valid replacement.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3)Everyone is focused on either Tony or Steve dying for each other which would mean that Thor being the one that sacrifices himself would be a twist.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4)In Ragnarok we saw Thor loose his father and his home and, in turn, find his power. In Infinity War we saw him loose his people and his brother and use his power to avenge them. He himself has said that he has nothing else to loose which means that he might be the most willing to stand up to Thanos.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"934\" data-orig-height=\"420\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/13a0e3dbb3531295c80308a690159a12/tumblr_inline_pn8q4dmUQ31tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"934\" data-orig-height=\"420\"></figure><p>\u00a0I think that the destiny of each character will be decided based on how his story would finally come full circle. And how to make their ending less tragic by giving them what they have been looking for. Which brings me to the last point.</p><p>5) Thor began his journey through the MCU as an arrogant god who has no feelings for misgardians and through the years we have seen him care for them more and more.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"610\" data-orig-height=\"276\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a21fe755c06d90ec3e307b461aa87ac/tumblr_inline_pn8qgleT701tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"610\" data-orig-height=\"276\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1854\" data-orig-height=\"892\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebc7064438bcb37ac91f5925eab73171/tumblr_inline_pn8qgydrpn1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"1854\" data-orig-height=\"892\"></figure><p>So I believe that a way to close his arc which involved him going from being arrogant and not caring for misgardians to being powefull and caring as well as selfless would be to have him sacrifice himself in order to allow others to live.\u00a0</p><hr><p>The next destiny would be: Abandonment of this timeline.\u00a0</p><p>I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that this ending belongs to Steve Rogers. A man out of his time. I believe that Steve Rogers arc through the movies was mostly related to him becoming a perfect soldier with a belief system who then had to question his beliefs and become a fugitive of the government. There are 3 main reasons that lead me to believe this might happen:\u00a0</p><p>1) The possibility of time travel. We know that time travel exists in the MCU as it was introduced with Dr Strange. We also know that there is a high possibility of it being used in Endgame to defeat Thanos as seen with the BTS photos showing a shooting of the battle of New York of 2012. This would mean that it is possible for Steve to decide as a sacrifice or as a way of retirement to go back in time to the 40\u2032s in order to avoid going into the ice and thus create a new alternate universe where Captain America never became an avenger and never missed his date with Peggy Carter.\u00a0</p><p>I believe reason 2 and 3 are related as one involves Steve\u2019s biggest wish and the other his biggest fear.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02) Steve\u2019s biggest fear. This is something that was first introduced in Avengers:Age of Ultron with both Wanda and Ultron himself. Wanda shows each of the Main 3 what we think is their biggest fear. However it might end up being an interpretation of their destiny when mixed with what scares them:\u00a0</p><p>Tony:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"878\" data-orig-height=\"868\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bbcca26b2b610a0d00045ea627b759bb/tumblr_inline_pn8se5V9Vy1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"878\" data-orig-height=\"868\"></figure><p>Thor:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"358\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d459dfd2392b26b93bf9fc644f55265/tumblr_inline_pn8seg08i71tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"358\"></figure><p>And, finally, Steve:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29a1e7a824c6a9247525760ee1fb8b54/tumblr_inline_pn8sivpnd91tt6aap_540.gif\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p>During this scene we see Steve watching himself going home but being unable to let go of his PTSD and the war which is also shown by Ultron\u2019s words.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"546\" data-orig-height=\"504\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8eb995b5262ccecf4949a41b7997ffcc/tumblr_inline_pn8sl6B26J1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"546\" data-orig-height=\"504\"></figure><p>This all goes to show that Steve\u2019s biggest fear is never being able to let go of the war while his destiny could be to go back to his own time.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03) Steve\u2019s biggest wish. If we believe that his biggest fear is never letting go of the war and his biggest problem is that he is literally a man out of his time, then the best way to end his journey giving him and the fans the chance of healing and being at peace with his departure would be to send him back to his own time. Letting him live his remaining days with Peggy and fulfilling a dream that he told Tony in AoU wasn\u2019t for him but for the man he used to be.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"646\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dd5154127a5987f9afd71af57cb7420/tumblr_inline_pn8sqlxVXp1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"474\" data-orig-height=\"646\"></figure><hr><p>And, finally: Retirement.\u00a0</p><p>This is partly wishful thinking and partly supported by evidence. It is known that Iron Man\u2019s journey as we know it is certainly coming to and end as RDJ is not set to be in any more Marvel movies and is choosing to step aside. However I think that there are 5 reasons which are also related and which lead me to think that he might survive.\u00a0</p><p>1) Tony Stark dying in Endgame is probably the most expected outcome. Everybody is going to go into the cinema expecting him to die fighting Thanos, saving Peter or sacrificing himself. However, there are a number of theories that point to him surviving. The main one related to the parallelism between Endgame and the stage of a game of chess by the same name. During which, one is set to make many sacrifices to win. However, in order to win, those sacrifices cannot include killing the king as that means automatic loss and I like to believe that the parallelism between Tony and Thanos is put there in Infinity War because they are each the\u00a0\u201cking\u201d of each team in the chess game. Therefore, he cannot die as that would mean loosing.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2) It is known and has been hinted at by many sources that there is one scene in the movie that includes most, if not all, the cast of Avengers. This has been said by Sebastian Stan in an interview.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"278\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee5ff07173d442d4cd80c5bd6336f868/tumblr_inline_pn8t7vqHyw1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"278\"></figure><p>Also, because the actor who played Harley Keener in Iron Man 3 is listed on the cast, many believe that his appearence as well as the scene mentioned by Sebastian are a funeral scene for Tony Stark. However I believe (mainly based on my mental health) that the scene in question is a wedding scene for Tony and Pepper which could be nearing the end of the movie as a way to end it on a positive note, opposite to the Infinity War ending.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03) Through all the MCU movies featuring Tony Stark, he has been shown as the most human character. He constantly makes mistakes, he messes up, he can be arrogant and selfish. This leads many to believe that his last redeeming act would be to sacrifice himself. However, what many fail to notice is that he has sacrificed himself time and time again in order to save the planet. The most clear examples are him taking the nuke outside of the atmosphere to save New York and him not wanting Dr Strange to exchange the Time Stone to save his life. However, there is an exchange between Captain America and Tony during the first Avengers movie that might be foreshadowing Tony\u2019s role in Endgame.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"294\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ecbbbcc658c7a60a629aed5f8e029be/tumblr_inline_pn8tk4psuR1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"294\"></figure><p>This could mean that while everybody is expecting Tony to, once again, sacrifice himself and\u00a0\u201clay down on the wire\u201d his role in the movie will be to find a way to\u00a0\u201ccut it\u201d, that is to find an alternative way to bring everyone back.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4) It has been foreshadowed through most of the last movies that Tony is set to settle down and have a family. This can be mostly seen in his new-found role as Peter Parkes\u2019 mentor/father-figure which he has taken on voluntarily and is strikingly different to how he treated Harley Keener whom he found before he was ready to settle down.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"410\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9aec011a616c70e7912b2e0bd0c62c12/tumblr_inline_pn8v0l9WQq1tt6aap_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"410\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"484\" data-orig-width=\"946\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e34723672b4a5c700ea4543f3a19b70d/tumblr_inline_pn8v0rNova1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"484\" data-orig-width=\"946\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"844\" data-orig-width=\"1966\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4381f82ab70ff360074a24ae08277efa/tumblr_inline_pn8v19xpA91tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"844\" data-orig-width=\"1966\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"422\" data-orig-width=\"874\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f64c657b3e6b20eb9b3bf2aba9a0fc92/tumblr_inline_pn8v1kuE7A1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"422\" data-orig-width=\"874\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"880\" data-orig-width=\"892\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e26a02b0f6e9fe01debfe3944791d96e/tumblr_inline_pn8v1ujPFs1tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"880\" data-orig-width=\"892\"></figure><p>This could either mean that marvel wants us to suffer even more by showing us a glimpse of what Tony could have or it means that they are building up to him finally retiring as he has been trying to do since the end of Iron Man 3.</p><p>5) Finally, there is the matter of the best way of ending such a beloved character as Tony Stark. I believe that having him sacrifice himself is not what the MCU has been building for the past decade as his arc is mainly involved with him finding a family. This is seen in Iron Man 1 when Yinsen who could be interpreted as the only real mentor Tony had, tells him to not waste his life. This might have been interpreted by Tony at first as Yinsen telling him to do something with his knowledge, become a hero. However, Yinsen clearly cares much more about family\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"774\" data-orig-width=\"616\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/024bbc7830ec3e242fe522ec67e1cb59/tumblr_inline_pn8vc0gfx11tt6aap_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"774\" data-orig-width=\"616\"></figure><p>Which could mean that Tony\u2019s ultimate ending, what his character has been leading up to, is being able to spend the rest of his life, the life that Yinsen saved, with his family. This would explain the idea that Tony hasn\u2019t had a conventional family making the Avengers his family and surrounding himself with people he called family such as Pepper, Happy, Rhodes and even Peter Parker that he felt he needed to protect but that finally, after saving the universe once again, he can retire and expand said family.\u00a0</p><hr><p>That\u2019s the end of this long theory, please let me know what you think!!</p>",

However, right at the end of Ragnarok we see the tone change with the appearance of Thanos.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Thor is obviously the most powerful avenger and the most capable of causing any damage to Thanos. Also, in terms of power he is the most similar to Captain Marvel who would serve as a valid replacement.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3)Everyone is focused on either Tony or Steve dying for each other which would mean that Thor being the one that sacrifices himself would be a twist.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4)In Ragnarok we saw Thor loose his father and his home and, in turn, find his power. In Infinity War we saw him loose his people and his brother and use his power to avenge them. He himself has said that he has nothing else to loose which means that he might be the most willing to stand up to Thanos.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/13a0e3dbb3531295c80308a690159a12/tumblr_inline_pn8q4dmUQ31tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&nbsp;I think that the destiny of each character will be decided based on how his story would finally come full circle. And how to make their ending less tragic by giving them what they have been looking for. Which brings me to the last point.</p><p>5) Thor began his journey through the MCU as an arrogant god who has no feelings for misgardians and through the years we have seen him care for them more and more.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a21fe755c06d90ec3e307b461aa87ac/tumblr_inline_pn8qgleT701tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebc7064438bcb37ac91f5925eab73171/tumblr_inline_pn8qgydrpn1tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>So I believe that a way to close his arc which involved him going from being arrogant and not caring for misgardians to being powefull and caring as well as selfless would be to have him sacrifice himself in order to allow others to live.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>The next destiny would be: Abandonment of this timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that this ending belongs to Steve Rogers. A man out of his time. I believe that Steve Rogers arc through the movies was mostly related to him becoming a perfect soldier with a belief system who then had to question his beliefs and become a fugitive of the government. There are 3 main reasons that lead me to believe this might happen:&nbsp;</p><p>1) The possibility of time travel. We know that time travel exists in the MCU as it was introduced with Dr Strange. We also know that there is a high possibility of it being used in Endgame to defeat Thanos as seen with the BTS photos showing a shooting of the battle of New York of 2012. This would mean that it is possible for Steve to decide as a sacrifice or as a way of retirement to go back in time to the 40&prime;s in order to avoid going into the ice and thus create a new alternate universe where Captain America never became an avenger and never missed his date with Peggy Carter.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe reason 2 and 3 are related as one involves Steve&rsquo;s biggest wish and the other his biggest fear.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) Steve&rsquo;s biggest fear. This is something that was first introduced in Avengers:Age of Ultron with both Wanda and Ultron himself. Wanda shows each of the Main 3 what we think is their biggest fear. However it might end up being an interpretation of their destiny when mixed with what scares them:&nbsp;</p><p>Tony:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bbcca26b2b610a0d00045ea627b759bb/tumblr_inline_pn8se5V9Vy1tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Thor:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d459dfd2392b26b93bf9fc644f55265/tumblr_inline_pn8seg08i71tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And, finally, Steve:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29a1e7a824c6a9247525760ee1fb8b54/tumblr_inline_pn8sivpnd91tt6aap_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>During this scene we see Steve watching himself going home but being unable to let go of his PTSD and the war which is also shown by Ultron&rsquo;s words.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8eb995b5262ccecf4949a41b7997ffcc/tumblr_inline_pn8sl6B26J1tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This all goes to show that Steve&rsquo;s biggest fear is never being able to let go of the war while his destiny could be to go back to his own time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) Steve&rsquo;s biggest wish. If we believe that his biggest fear is never letting go of the war and his biggest problem is that he is literally a man out of his time, then the best way to end his journey giving him and the fans the chance of healing and being at peace with his departure would be to send him back to his own time. Letting him live his remaining days with Peggy and fulfilling a dream that he told Tony in AoU wasn&rsquo;t for him but for the man he used to be.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dd5154127a5987f9afd71af57cb7420/tumblr_inline_pn8sqlxVXp1tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><hr /><p>And, finally: Retirement.&nbsp;</p><p>This is partly wishful thinking and partly supported by evidence. It is known that Iron Man&rsquo;s journey as we know it is certainly coming to and end as RDJ is not set to be in any more Marvel movies and is choosing to step aside. However I think that there are 5 reasons which are also related and which lead me to think that he might survive.&nbsp;</p><p>1) Tony Stark dying in Endgame is probably the most expected outcome. Everybody is going to go into the cinema expecting him to die fighting Thanos, saving Peter or sacrificing himself. However, there are a number of theories that point to him surviving. The main one related to the parallelism between Endgame and the stage of a game of chess by the same name. During which, one is set to make many sacrifices to win. However, in order to win, those sacrifices cannot include killing the king as that means automatic loss and I like to believe that the parallelism between Tony and Thanos is put there in Infinity War because they are each the&nbsp;&ldquo;king&rdquo; of each team in the chess game. Therefore, he cannot die as that would mean loosing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) It is known and has been hinted at by many sources that there is one scene in the movie that includes most, if not all, the cast of Avengers. This has been said by Sebastian Stan in an interview.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee5ff07173d442d4cd80c5bd6336f868/tumblr_inline_pn8t7vqHyw1tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Also, because the actor who played Harley Keener in Iron Man 3 is listed on the cast, many believe that his appearence as well as the scene mentioned by Sebastian are a funeral scene for Tony Stark. However I believe (mainly based on my mental health) that the scene in question is a wedding scene for Tony and Pepper which could be nearing the end of the movie as a way to end it on a positive note, opposite to the Infinity War ending.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) Through all the MCU movies featuring Tony Stark, he has been shown as the most human character. He constantly makes mistakes, he messes up, he can be arrogant and selfish. This leads many to believe that his last redeeming act would be to sacrifice himself. However, what many fail to notice is that he has sacrificed himself time and time again in order to save the planet. The most clear examples are him taking the nuke outside of the atmosphere to save New York and him not wanting Dr Strange to exchange the Time Stone to save his life. However, there is an exchange between Captain America and Tony during the first Avengers movie that might be foreshadowing Tony&rsquo;s role in Endgame.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ecbbbcc658c7a60a629aed5f8e029be/tumblr_inline_pn8tk4psuR1tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This could mean that while everybody is expecting Tony to, once again, sacrifice himself and&nbsp;&ldquo;lay down on the wire&rdquo; his role in the movie will be to find a way to&nbsp;&ldquo;cut it&rdquo;, that is to find an alternative way to bring everyone back.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4) It has been foreshadowed through most of the last movies that Tony is set to settle down and have a family. This can be mostly seen in his new-found role as Peter Parkes&rsquo; mentor/father-figure which he has taken on voluntarily and is strikingly different to how he treated Harley Keener whom he found before he was ready to settle down.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9aec011a616c70e7912b2e0bd0c62c12/tumblr_inline_pn8v0l9WQq1tt6aap_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e34723672b4a5c700ea4543f3a19b70d/tumblr_inline_pn8v0rNova1tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4381f82ab70ff360074a24ae08277efa/tumblr_inline_pn8v19xpA91tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f64c657b3e6b20eb9b3bf2aba9a0fc92/tumblr_inline_pn8v1kuE7A1tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e26a02b0f6e9fe01debfe3944791d96e/tumblr_inline_pn8v1ujPFs1tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This could either mean that marvel wants us to suffer even more by showing us a glimpse of what Tony could have or it means that they are building up to him finally retiring as he has been trying to do since the end of Iron Man 3.</p><p>5) Finally, there is the matter of the best way of ending such a beloved character as Tony Stark. I believe that having him sacrifice himself is not what the MCU has been building for the past decade as his arc is mainly involved with him finding a family. This is seen in Iron Man 1 when Yinsen who could be interpreted as the only real mentor Tony had, tells him to not waste his life. This might have been interpreted by Tony at first as Yinsen telling him to do something with his knowledge, become a hero. However, Yinsen clearly cares much more about family&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/024bbc7830ec3e242fe522ec67e1cb59/tumblr_inline_pn8vc0gfx11tt6aap_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Which could mean that Tony&rsquo;s ultimate ending, what his character has been leading up to, is being able to spend the rest of his life, the life that Yinsen saved, with his family. This would explain the idea that Tony hasn&rsquo;t had a conventional family making the Avengers his family and surrounding himself with people he called family such as Pepper, Happy, Rhodes and even Peter Parker that he felt he needed to protect but that finally, after saving the universe once again, he can retire and expand said family.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>That&rsquo;s the end of this long theory, please let me know what you think!!</p>",
