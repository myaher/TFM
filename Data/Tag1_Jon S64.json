See this as an opportunity to learn something about this fascinating topic, rather than becoming defensive about it. You misunderstood or misinterpreted a lot of the things stated in <a href=\"https://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/range-shared-dna-between-relatives\">this article</a> and I just have to point them out. </p><p>What this isn\u2019t about: I am not making a point about incest being necessarily bad in the asoiaf universe. I\u2019m not arguing that Jon and Dany\u2019s close genetic relation is a reason for them to not be together. I will not even talk about it. I don\u2019t care. This isn\u2019t about ships but scientific accuracy. </p><p>What this is about: Jon did not \u201cinherit more genetic makeup from Lyanna than Rhaegar\u201d because he looks like her. There is no conceivable way in which Jon and Dany have as little as 1,7% of their DNA in common. Both those statements are objectively and factually wrong. Jon is half Rhaegar and half Lyanna, no matter how he looks and he and Dany have anything between 30 and 50% of their DNA in common, most likely 44%.<i> I will prove it with science and explain it in excruciating detail. \u00a0</i></p><p>This essay is structured into the following sections: </p><p><b>1. DNA, Genes, Chromosomes and Alleles</b></p><p><b>2. Genotype vs Phenotype / Dominant, recessive, co-dominant and intermediate inheritance</b></p><p><b>3. Mitosis and Meiosis</b></p><p><b>4. The 1,7% were based on outdated, flawed data </b></p><p><b>5. Targcest vs Nocest / the coefficient of relationship and how closely Jon and Dany are actually related</b></p><p>Anyone who thinks they don\u2019t need to refresh their knowledge on basic human genetics can feel free to jump to the last section. It might still be interesting. </p><!-- more --><h2>1. DNA, Genes, Chromosomes and Alleles</h2><p>This is the your DNA:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"2110\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a0b673ff18732f9776b58111961b3b3/tumblr_inline_pqir1rl1mp1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"2110\"/></figure><p>It is made up of about 3 billion adenine-thymine and cytosine-guanine pairs. It\u2019s the main thing that makes you you. </p><p>Portions of DNA that code for specific proteins are called genes. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"240\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/74974798a68c30b53bb50eedc651d198/tumblr_inline_pqir3kSE691ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"240\"/></figure><p>The majority of human DNA is actually not used for producing proteins and was formerly called \u201cjunk-DNA\u201d. We falsely believed that it was pretty much meaningless. We are only now starting to understand how much non-coding-DNA influences the way our genetic code works.</p><p>Your DNA is packaged into chromosomes. Every species has a different amount of them, which is the main reason why different species can\u2019t interbreed or why the offspring of different species (Mules, Ligers, etc) tends to be infertile. Human beings have 23 different chromosomes. 22 autosomal ones that are not sex-specific and one sex chromosome (either X or Y) that specifies your biological sex. </p><p>However, only sperm and egg cells have 23 chromosomes, which is called haploid.</p><p>All other cells in your body are diploid, having two different sets of the 22 autosomal chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes (either two X chromosomes if you are biologically female or one X and one Y if you are biologically male). That would look like this:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"147\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5963f1f8f565993e6f7419fdf47cca9/tumblr_inline_pqdmb5QCks1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"147\"/></figure><p>You have two sets of chromosomes because you inherited one set from your mother and one set from your father. You always owe half of your genetic material to your father and half to your mother, no matter who you resemble more.</p><p>You also have DNA that isn\u2019t packaged into chromosomes. For example your mitochondrial DNA which is only inherited through your mother. When compared to your chromosomal DNA however, it\u2019s amount is so minuscule that it won\u2019t influence how closely you are related to your mother and father in any meaningful way. (And no, mitochondrial DNA does not influence your appearance so this isn\u2019t the reason why Jon resembles Lyanna more than Rhaegar.)</p><p>Gametes (sperm and eggs) only have one set of chromosomes because they are going to be combined with the set of another person to produce a new human being. That human being will again have two sets, one paternal (from the father) and one maternal (from the mother).</p><p>Your paternal and maternal chromosome 1 (for example) are called an homologous pair. The genes present on each will have the same general job, they will however not be exactly the same due to random mutations and genetic variety. Mutations can lead to the same genes working in slightly different ways. (eg coding for brown or blue eyes. They still both influence eye color.) Every human being has the genes that make him a human, but humans still aren\u2019t exact copies of one another. </p><p> Different variations of the same gene are called alleles. You can either have the same alleles on both chromosomes, what is called homozygosity, or you can have two different alleles on each chromosome, which is called <i><b>heterozygosity</b></i>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/acfd3e1ae93184ce713a2637b7689600/tumblr_inline_pqih8ejy1v1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\"/></figure><p>\n\nThese variations in alleles for each gene is why people look the way they look. To find out why people sometimes resemble one parent more than the other, we have to look at how these different alleles can interact with one another.\n\n</p><h2><b>2. Genotype vs Phenotype / dominant, recessive, co-dominate and intermediate inheritance</b></h2><p><b></b></p><p>Genotype = your actual genetic code in its entirety </p><p>Phenotype = what traits (appearance, behavior, diseases, metabolism, etc) can be observed</p><p>Someone&rsquo;s phenotype doesn\u2019t necessarily tell you what exact genes they carry. Here\u2019s why:</p><h2>2.1 Dominant vs recessive</h2><p>In \n\nsome cases one allele will be dominant and the other recessive. This means that the dominant trait will always be expressed when present, while the recessive one will be expressed only if no dominant allele is. If one dominant and one recessive allele is present, if you are heterozygous for that specific gene, the dominant one is expressed while the recessive one is only \u201ccarried\u201d. You can still pass it to the next\n\ngeneration.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"403\" data-orig-height=\"263\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3b0886e292f78e35d54d41deb70d0db/tumblr_inline_pqdmbzNMuz1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"403\" data-orig-height=\"263\"/></figure><p>\n\nTwo people could carry the allele for a recessive trait without even knowing it (due to it being silenced by the dominant one) and still have a &frac14; chance of producing a child with that recessive trait.\n\n</p><figure data-orig-width=\"412\" data-orig-height=\"267\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/153fe36aa961224693ab94d957ebc919/tumblr_inline_pqdmc5JFWA1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"412\" data-orig-height=\"267\"/></figure><p>The children in this case did not inherit more genetic makeup from their father, they simply ended up expressing the dominant trait inherited from him and not the recessive one inherited from their mother. However, all children in this setup will end up carrying the recessive allele and can potentially pass it on to their children.</p><p>One of the few traits in human appearance that are inherited monogenic (only one gene is responsible for a specific trait) \u00a0and dominant-recessive.

He still carries some \u201cblond\u201d alleles from his father and could have blond children if whoever woman he has children with, also has \u201cblond\u201d alleles. </p><p>Ned figured out that Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen are NOT Robert\u2019s children with the exact same logic. Every time a black-haired Baratheon had children with a blonde woman, their children had black hair. Which is pretty consistent with real life. None of Robert\u2019s children with Cersei following this trend was just too much of a coincidence. </p><p>This is the main reason why genetic diversity and avoiding inbreeding is so important. The more closely people are related, the more likely the are to carry the same recessive alleles for a specific condition, the more likely they are to have a child with a condition. As good as every person alive carries recessive alleles for one disease or another, but, not reproducing with people we are closely related to, makes it unlikely to meet up with a person who carries the exact same recessive alleles as you.</p><p>The coefficient of inbreeding tells you how likely it is that a person is homozygous for a specific allele by descent. It is actually impossible to accurately calculate for House Targaryen, because we do not know how many generations ago they started marrying their siblings. Even generous approximations (assuming the Aegon I was the first to incest) sets it way higher for Daenerys than for any known real human that has ever lived. But since we don\u2019t care about Dany\u2019s risk for recessive disorders, but only her relation to Jon, we are just going to ignore this. Only bringing it up because it is a thing.\u00a0</p><h2>2.2 Co-dominant alleles</h2><p>Co-dominant \n\nalleles will both be expressed to the same amount, none of them is dominant enough to silence the other. They can however still be fully dominant against a third trait. The ABO system of blood types would be an example of this in human beings. The traits for blood type A and B are both dominant to O, but co-dominant to each other. This means that a couple where one has the blood type A and one has the blood type B have equal chances of producing a child with any of the four blood types if they are heterozygous and carry the allele for O as\n\n well.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"406\" data-orig-height=\"384\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4ee807f39256d198ad76571365a1333/tumblr_inline_pqdmd8U57K1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"406\" data-orig-height=\"384\"/></figure><p>A \n\nchild ending up with blood type A ( A == phenotype, AO == genotype) didn\u2019t inherit \u201cmore genes\u201d from its mother because she shares the same blood type. It merely inherited a dominant trait from its mother and a recessive trait from its\n\n father.</p><h2>2.3 Intermediate inheritance</h2><p>The third most common way for alleles to interact is the intermediate one. Meaning that if two different alleles that code for two different traits are present, the phenotype will be a mix between the two. If a flower&rsquo;s color is inherited this way, a white and red flower will produce pink ones.</p><p>This is for example how human skin color is inherited. In reality, it is an immensely complex process that we don\u2019t fully understand yet, but simplified: We have numerous genes that code for the production of melanin in our skin and certain mutations lead to a reduced production, leading to lighter skin.</p><p>Let\u2019s assume we have only three genes A, B and C that all contribute the same amount to the color of our skin (in reality it\u2019s much more and not all have the same influence, there are also epigenetic influences but we are trying to keep this simple here): An uppercase letter means that the gene will contribute to melanin-production, a lowercase letter is a mutation that will not. Three genes on two chromosomes makes six alleles in total. Having six &hellip; let&rsquo;s call it \u201cmelanin-points\u201d will lead to the darkest skin coloration possible while having zero means producing no melanin at all.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"347\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d80873a5de91f3901ae3f48efd68d266/tumblr_inline_pqdmlgoPEi1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"347\"/></figure><p>Even \n\nin this extremely simplified version we only have 7 phenotypes and 24 different genotypes showing once again that simply looking at someone doesn\u2019t tell you all that much about what specific genes they are made of. Let\u2019s look at a little example of what would happen if a dark-skinned man and light-skinned woman had a\n\nchild:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"353\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1cf1af773d2559cbc5f330f5c9983e4/tumblr_inline_pqdmlqxXYh1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"353\"/></figure><p>Their child would have a 50% chance of its skin color being a perfect mix between the two and a 25% each, of being a bit more on the light or the dark side.</p><p>A child ending up inheriting 4/6 \u201cmelanin-points\u201d would not be more closely related to its father and a child ending up with lighter skin would not be more closely related to its mother. \u00a0</p><p>This is of course far more complex in real life but it can occasionally lead to mix-raced couples having children with vastly different skin tones. It\u2019s the most obvious (and cute) when it happens to fraternal twins (twins that are only as related as normal siblings and don\u2019t share 100% of their <i>DNA</i>).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"284\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c30b98a9ba404755fd73ed7528c4b01/tumblr_inline_pqdp3qxmWl1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"284\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"460\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb8b35578401accbd6376361397c750f/tumblr_inline_pqdp3r4P8h1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"460\"/></figure><p>These children are 50% mom and 50% dad, they are in no way more closely related to their black or white parent. The one with darker skin just happened to inherit more alleles coding for the production of melanin and statistical improbabilities can sometimes lead to extreme variations.</p><p>This also goes the other way around. I won\u2019t write out all possible genotypes (it would be 64 in total) but here are the probabilities if both parents are medium-dark-skinned:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"435\" data-orig-height=\"390\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/673ed475fad21fe7a87fe03041fae0d1/tumblr_inline_pqdmo5942M1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"435\" data-orig-height=\"390\"/></figure><p>While highly unlikely, two people with medium-dark skin can have children with far darker or far lighter skin. Genetics can be weird like that.</p><p>Some alleles involved in hair- and eye-color also interact like this, instead of dominant/recessive. </p><p>So, now that we have that out of the way there is only one more thing we have to cover before moving on to the topic of how related you are to what relative. It gets a bit more complicated when it comes to siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc but with your parents IT IS ALWAYS 50/50. ALWAYS.</p><h2><b>3. Mitosis and Meiosis</b></h2><p><b><i>Mitosis\u00a0</i></b>is the process of normal body cells duplicating themselves. One mother-cell produces two identical daughter-cells with the exact same DNA. We don\u2019t need to get too into detail here, what\u2019s important is that the initial two (!) sets of chromosomes are copied perfectly, leading to 4 sets of chromosomes being present temporarily and later the mother-cell dividing itself into two new cells who take two sets of chromosomes each with them. Creating two completely normal diploid cells. </p><p>Meiosis is the creation of four haploid germ cells out of one diploid cell. Four (4) because this process starts out the same way as mitosis: by duplicating the existing diploid chromosome set. Meiosis produces four haploid cells instead of two diploid ones is the one big difference. The other being the recombination of your homologous pairs of chromosomes. What happens is that some portion of the paternal chromosome will be swapped with the same portion of the maternal chromosome.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"443\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5724bcdfb48c5220d37f5687104d2cb/tumblr_inline_pqdmozZbpj1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"443\"/></figure><p>\n\nThis \n\n is also called \u201ccrossing over\u201d and just like sexual reproduction itself, it increases the genetic diversity of someone\u2019s offspring. The newly created germ cell won\u2019t simple receive one half of the maternal or paternal chromosome, but can potentially inherit a random combination of the\n\n two.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"771\" data-orig-height=\"598\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc3dec2be0607b9403411cec3bdf2b1b/tumblr_inline_pqiobsaIBa1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"771\" data-orig-height=\"598\"/></figure><p>This is what the article you read talked about. In the example above Child 2 inherited far more DNA from it\u2019s maternal grandmother than grandfather. This will however only influence how closely related the children are to their grandparents and to themselves. They still share 50% of their DNA with their mother and 50% with their father. </p><p>This will happen with all 23 chromosome pairs and will most likely average out to 50% shared DNA between siblings, 25% between grandparents/grandchildren, etc. Those number are of course only averages and there is indeed some range. If through pure coincidence child 2 consistently inherits a bit more from it\u2019s maternal grandmother, it will indeed be more closely related to her than to its maternal grandfather. It still doesn\u2019t change its degree of relationship to its mother or father. Which are, by the way, all things the author of that article mentions.</p><p>The less closely related two people are, and the more crossovers can occur, the bigger that range gets respectively and the more likely it is that their actual shared amount will deviate from the statistically expected one. With close relatives like aunt/nephew however, the expected amount of shared DNA is vastly bigger than 1,7% even when working with the lower limit of that range. Why that is, is what we\u2019ll talk about next:</p><h2><b>4. The 1,7% &hellip; were based on outdated, flawed data</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"294\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a16d02bb78cd12126c0edb13b5464560/tumblr_inline_pqdmpiTiXT1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"294\"/></figure><p>Some things about this chart &hellip; just don\u2019t look right.</p><p>The average cM for Aunt/Uncle is stated to be 1703, the range given is 121 - 2227. One should think that random processes like this would lead to a Gaussian normal distribution, but while the highest cM given is 524 points higher than average, the lowest is 1582 (!!!) lower. An almost three times bigger deviation. That doesn\u2019t sound right.</p><p>Also, other relations of the same degree (with similar averages) have extremely different ranges:</p><p>Grandparents: Avg: 1760, <b>875</b> - 2365 </p><p>Half-Sibling: Avg: 1731, <b>787</b> - 2134</p><p>The same is true for other relations of the same degree. Half-niece/Half-nephew having a lower range of 540, while first cousins only have 83 (!!!) , Great Aunt/Uncle having 236, Great-Grandparents having 547.</p><p><b>This all looks immensely inconsistent.</b></p><p>After doing some digging I found out that this chart was created by the \u201cShared cM Project\u201d that introduces itself like so:</p><blockquote><p><i><a href=\"https://thegeneticgenealogist.com/2015/05/29/the-shared-cm-project/\">The Shared cM Project</a> is a collaborative data collection and analysis project created to understand the ranges of shared centiMorgans associated with various known relationships.

I would have honestly been very shocked if a Stanford professor would be negligent enough to overlook this. </p><p>Looking at the newest published data from April 2018, it becomes even more apparently clear that the first one from 2015 simply didn\u2019t have enough reliable data yet to show any conclusive results. (and they probably shouldn\u2019t have included the absolute minimum and maximum but the 99 percentile as they did here)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"718\" data-orig-height=\"536\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/113d81080be18fb62b5af096ba892598/tumblr_inline_pqezki9KIp1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"718\" data-orig-height=\"536\"/></figure><p>Average cM and range for Aunt/Uncle from 2015: \u00a01703, <b>121</b> - 2227.<br/>Average cM and range for Aunt/Uncle from 2018: \u00a01750, <b>1349</b> - 2175.</p><p>That looks &hellip; more reasonable. A lot more reasonable to be honest. Which would put the lowest possible amount of shared DNA between Aunt/Uncle and Niece/Nephew according to this data at &hellip; 19,27%. Which also sounds a lot more reasonable than 1,7%. </p><p>Another thing to keep in mind when looking at these numbers is that DNA-tests are not necessarily 100% accurate. Whether your DNA is compared to somebody else\u2019s by a private company like 23&amp;Me or by law enforcement, they are not going to sequence your entire genetic information. The costs for sequencing an entire genome are still estimated to be around 1000$ and ain\u2019t nobody got money for that. What they do instead is look at several distinct sections of your DNA and calculate your degree of relation depending on the matches in differences they find in those. The more sections they look at, they more accurate the results will be but depending on how much money you invest it will be somewhere between fairly and somewhat accurate. </p><p>The information put forward by this project will however get better and better the more data they collect and it\u2019s pretty cool endeavor over all. </p><p>That still doesn\u2019t tell us how closely Jon and Dany are actually related, since this chart does not consider the insane amount of inbreeding that went on in House Targaryen.</p><h2><b>5.

It tells you what percentage of DNA two people are expected to share by common ancestry. The easiest way to calculate it is through drawing a family tree and simply counting lines.

This essay has already gotten way out of hand already and I don\u2019t want go into the basics of probability calculation as well but I promised to explain all this in excruciating detail so I guess I have no choice. </p><p>You have 1000 thousand coins, flip them and lay them out in a row. ~500 of them will show head, ~500 of them show tails.

He \u201conly\u201d shares about 25% of his DNA with Ned and about 44% with Daenerys and that is a fact. While big differences in shared genes might make a bit of a difference in which grandmother you resemble more, that effect is going to be dwarfed by the interplay of dominant and recessive alleles. He only shares about 12,5% of his DNA with Arya (okay, maybe a tad more because of the intermarriages in house stark, but I really don\u2019t feel like going through all the trouble to calculate that as well. It\u2019s not going to be as severe as the incest of House Targaryen) and they still look super alike because they both inherited the same dominant genes. </p><p>After reading all 5201 words of this, you will hopefully <i>never, ever, ever again</i> write or even think that a) Jon got more genes from his mother and that b) he and Dany might only share as little 1,7% of their DNA. </p><p>Thanks for coming to my TED Talk, isn\u2019t genetics a fascinating topic?\u00a0</p>",

We falsely believed that it was pretty much meaningless. We are only now starting to understand how much non-coding-DNA influences the way our genetic code works.</p><p>Your DNA is packaged into chromosomes. Every species has a different amount of them, which is the main reason why different species can\u2019t interbreed or why the offspring of different species (Mules, Ligers, etc) tends to be infertile. Human beings have 23 different chromosomes. 22 autosomal ones that are not sex-specific and one sex chromosome (either X or Y) that specifies your biological sex. </p><p>However, only sperm and egg cells have 23 chromosomes, which is called haploid.</p><p>All other cells in your body are diploid, having two different sets of the 22 autosomal chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes (either two X chromosomes if you are biologically female or one X and one Y if you are biologically male). That would look like this:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"147\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5963f1f8f565993e6f7419fdf47cca9/tumblr_inline_pqdmb5QCks1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"147\"></figure><p>You have two sets of chromosomes because you inherited one set from your mother and one set from your father. You always owe half of your genetic material to your father and half to your mother, no matter who you resemble more.</p><p>You also have DNA that isn\u2019t packaged into chromosomes. For example your mitochondrial DNA which is only inherited through your mother. When compared to your chromosomal DNA however, it\u2019s amount is so minuscule that it won\u2019t influence how closely you are related to your mother and father in any meaningful way. (And no, mitochondrial DNA does not influence your appearance so this isn\u2019t the reason why Jon resembles Lyanna more than Rhaegar.)</p><p>Gametes (sperm and eggs) only have one set of chromosomes because they are going to be combined with the set of another person to produce a new human being. That human being will again have two sets, one paternal (from the father) and one maternal (from the mother).</p><p>Your paternal and maternal chromosome 1 (for example) are called an homologous pair. The genes present on each will have the same general job, they will however not be exactly the same due to random mutations and genetic variety. Mutations can lead to the same genes working in slightly different ways. (eg coding for brown or blue eyes. They still both influence eye color.) Every human being has the genes that make him a human, but humans still aren\u2019t exact copies of one another. </p><p> Different variations of the same gene are called alleles. You can either have the same alleles on both chromosomes, what is called homozygosity, or you can have two different alleles on each chromosome, which is called <i><b>heterozygosity</b></i>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/acfd3e1ae93184ce713a2637b7689600/tumblr_inline_pqih8ejy1v1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\"></figure><p>\n\nThese variations in alleles for each gene is why people look the way they look.

Genotype vs Phenotype / dominant, recessive, co-dominate and intermediate inheritance</b></h2><p><b></b></p><p>Genotype = your actual genetic code in its entirety </p><p>Phenotype = what traits (appearance, behavior, diseases, metabolism, etc) can be observed</p><p>Someone\u2019s phenotype doesn\u2019t necessarily tell you what exact genes they carry. Here\u2019s why:</p><h2>2.1 Dominant vs recessive</h2><p>In \n\nsome cases one allele will be dominant and the other recessive. This means that the dominant trait will always be expressed when present, while the recessive one will be expressed only if no dominant allele is. If one dominant and one recessive allele is present, if you are heterozygous for that specific gene, the dominant one is expressed while the recessive one is only \u201ccarried\u201d.

Every time a black-haired Baratheon had children with a blonde woman, their children had black hair. Which is pretty consistent with real life. None of Robert\u2019s children with Cersei following this trend was just too much of a coincidence. </p><p>This is the main reason why genetic diversity and avoiding inbreeding is so important. The more closely people are related, the more likely the are to carry the same recessive alleles for a specific condition, the more likely they are to have a child with a condition. As good as every person alive carries recessive alleles for one disease or another, but, not reproducing with people we are closely related to, makes it unlikely to meet up with a person who carries the exact same recessive alleles as you.</p><p>The coefficient of inbreeding tells you how likely it is that a person is homozygous for a specific allele by descent. It is actually impossible to accurately calculate for House Targaryen, because we do not know how many generations ago they started marrying their siblings. Even generous approximations (assuming the Aegon I was the first to incest) sets it way higher for Daenerys than for any known real human that has ever lived. But since we don\u2019t care about Dany\u2019s risk for recessive disorders, but only her relation to Jon, we are just going to ignore this. Only bringing it up because it is a thing.\u00a0</p><h2>2.2 Co-dominant alleles</h2><p>Co-dominant \n\nalleles will both be expressed to the same amount, none of them is dominant enough to silence the other. They can however still be fully dominant against a third trait. The ABO system of blood types would be an example of this in human beings. The traits for blood type A and B are both dominant to O, but co-dominant to each other. This means that a couple where one has the blood type A and one has the blood type B have equal chances of producing a child with any of the four blood types if they are heterozygous and carry the allele for O as\n\n well.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"406\" data-orig-height=\"384\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4ee807f39256d198ad76571365a1333/tumblr_inline_pqdmd8U57K1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"406\" data-orig-height=\"384\"></figure><p>A \n\nchild ending up with blood type A ( A == phenotype, AO == genotype) didn\u2019t inherit \u201cmore genes\u201d from its mother because she shares the same blood type. It merely inherited a dominant trait from its mother and a recessive trait from its\n\n father.</p><h2>2.3 Intermediate inheritance</h2><p>The third most common way for alleles to interact is the intermediate one. Meaning that if two different alleles that code for two different traits are present, the phenotype will be a mix between the two. If a flower\u2019s color is inherited this way, a white and red flower will produce pink ones.</p><p>This is for example how human skin color is inherited. In reality, it is an immensely complex process that we don\u2019t fully understand yet, but simplified: We have numerous genes that code for the production of melanin in our skin and certain mutations lead to a reduced production, leading to lighter skin.</p><p>Let\u2019s assume we have only three genes A, B and C that all contribute the same amount to the color of our skin (in reality it\u2019s much more and not all have the same influence, there are also epigenetic influences but we are trying to keep this simple here): An uppercase letter means that the gene will contribute to melanin-production, a lowercase letter is a mutation that will not. Three genes on two chromosomes makes six alleles in total. Having six \u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cmelanin-points\u201d will lead to the darkest skin coloration possible while having zero means producing no melanin at all.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"347\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d80873a5de91f3901ae3f48efd68d266/tumblr_inline_pqdmlgoPEi1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"347\"></figure><p>Even \n\nin this extremely simplified version we only have 7 phenotypes and 24 different genotypes showing once again that simply looking at someone doesn\u2019t tell you all that much about what specific genes they are made of. Let\u2019s look at a little example of what would happen if a dark-skinned man and light-skinned woman had a\n\nchild:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"353\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1cf1af773d2559cbc5f330f5c9983e4/tumblr_inline_pqdmlqxXYh1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"353\"></figure><p>Their child would have a 50% chance of its skin color being a perfect mix between the two and a 25% each, of being a bit more on the light or the dark side.</p><p>A child ending up inheriting 4/6 \u201cmelanin-points\u201d would not be more closely related to its father and a child ending up with lighter skin would not be more closely related to its mother. \u00a0</p><p>This is of course far more complex in real life but it can occasionally lead to mix-raced couples having children with vastly different skin tones. It\u2019s the most obvious (and cute) when it happens to fraternal twins (twins that are only as related as normal siblings and don\u2019t share 100% of their <i>DNA</i>).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"284\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c30b98a9ba404755fd73ed7528c4b01/tumblr_inline_pqdp3qxmWl1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"284\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"460\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb8b35578401accbd6376361397c750f/tumblr_inline_pqdp3r4P8h1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"460\"></figure><p>These children are 50% mom and 50% dad, they are in no way more closely related to their black or white parent. The one with darker skin just happened to inherit more alleles coding for the production of melanin and statistical improbabilities can sometimes lead to extreme variations.</p><p>This also goes the other way around. I won\u2019t write out all possible genotypes (it would be 64 in total) but here are the probabilities if both parents are medium-dark-skinned:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"435\" data-orig-height=\"390\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/673ed475fad21fe7a87fe03041fae0d1/tumblr_inline_pqdmo5942M1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"435\" data-orig-height=\"390\"></figure><p>While highly unlikely, two people with medium-dark skin can have children with far darker or far lighter skin. Genetics can be weird like that.</p><p>Some alleles involved in hair- and eye-color also interact like this, instead of dominant/recessive. </p><p>So, now that we have that out of the way there is only one more thing we have to cover before moving on to the topic of how related you are to what relative. It gets a bit more complicated when it comes to siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc but with your parents IT IS ALWAYS 50/50. ALWAYS.</p><h2><b>3. Mitosis and Meiosis</b></h2><p><b><i>Mitosis\u00a0</i></b>is the process of normal body cells duplicating themselves. One mother-cell produces two identical daughter-cells with the exact same DNA. We don\u2019t need to get too into detail here, what\u2019s important is that the initial two (!) sets of chromosomes are copied perfectly, leading to 4 sets of chromosomes being present temporarily and later the mother-cell dividing itself into two new cells who take two sets of chromosomes each with them. Creating two completely normal diploid cells. </p><p>Meiosis is the creation of four haploid germ cells out of one diploid cell. Four (4) because this process starts out the same way as mitosis: by duplicating the existing diploid chromosome set. Meiosis produces four haploid cells instead of two diploid ones is the one big difference. The other being the recombination of your homologous pairs of chromosomes. What happens is that some portion of the paternal chromosome will be swapped with the same portion of the maternal chromosome.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"443\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5724bcdfb48c5220d37f5687104d2cb/tumblr_inline_pqdmozZbpj1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"443\"></figure><p>\n\nThis \n\n is also called \u201ccrossing over\u201d and just like sexual reproduction itself, it increases the genetic diversity of someone\u2019s offspring.

In the example above Child 2 inherited far more DNA from it\u2019s maternal grandmother than grandfather. This will however only influence how closely related the children are to their grandparents and to themselves. They still share 50% of their DNA with their mother and 50% with their father. </p><p>This will happen with all 23 chromosome pairs and will most likely average out to 50% shared DNA between siblings, 25% between grandparents/grandchildren, etc. Those number are of course only averages and there is indeed some range. If through pure coincidence child 2 consistently inherits a bit more from it\u2019s maternal grandmother, it will indeed be more closely related to her than to its maternal grandfather. It still doesn\u2019t change its degree of relationship to its mother or father. Which are, by the way, all things the author of that article mentions.</p><p>The less closely related two people are, and the more crossovers can occur, the bigger that range gets respectively and the more likely it is that their actual shared amount will deviate from the statistically expected one. With close relatives like aunt/nephew however, the expected amount of shared DNA is vastly bigger than 1,7% even when working with the lower limit of that range. Why that is, is what we\u2019ll talk about next:</p><h2><b>4. The 1,7% \u2026 were based on outdated, flawed data</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"294\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a16d02bb78cd12126c0edb13b5464560/tumblr_inline_pqdmpiTiXT1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"294\"></figure><p>Some things about this chart \u2026 just don\u2019t look right.</p><p>The average cM for Aunt/Uncle is stated to be 1703, the range given is 121 - 2227. One should think that random processes like this would lead to a Gaussian normal distribution, but while the highest cM given is 524 points higher than average, the lowest is 1582 (!!!) lower. An almost three times bigger deviation. That doesn\u2019t sound right.</p><p>Also, other relations of the same degree (with similar averages) have extremely different ranges:</p><p>Grandparents: Avg: 1760, <b>875</b> - 2365 </p><p>Half-Sibling: Avg: 1731, <b>787</b> - 2134</p><p>The same is true for other relations of the same degree. Half-niece/Half-nephew having a lower range of 540, while first cousins only have 83 (!!!) , Great Aunt/Uncle having 236, Great-Grandparents having 547.</p><p><b>This all looks immensely inconsistent.</b></p><p>After doing some digging I found out that this chart was created by the \u201cShared cM Project\u201d that introduces itself like so:</p><blockquote><p><i><a href=\"https://thegeneticgenealogist.com/2015/05/29/the-shared-cm-project/\">The Shared cM Project</a> is a collaborative data collection and analysis project created to understand the ranges of shared centiMorgans associated with various known relationships.

Whether your DNA is compared to somebody else\u2019s by a private company like 23&amp;Me or by law enforcement, they are not going to sequence your entire genetic information. The costs for sequencing an entire genome are still estimated to be around 1000$ and ain\u2019t nobody got money for that. What they do instead is look at several distinct sections of your DNA and calculate your degree of relation depending on the matches in differences they find in those. The more sections they look at, they more accurate the results will be but depending on how much money you invest it will be somewhere between fairly and somewhat accurate. </p><p>The information put forward by this project will however get better and better the more data they collect and it\u2019s pretty cool endeavor over all. </p><p>That still doesn\u2019t tell us how closely Jon and Dany are actually related, since this chart does not consider the insane amount of inbreeding that went on in House Targaryen.</p><h2><b>5.

He \u201conly\u201d shares about 25% of his DNA with Ned and about 44% with Daenerys and that is a fact. While big differences in shared genes might make a bit of a difference in which grandmother you resemble more, that effect is going to be dwarfed by the interplay of dominant and recessive alleles. He only shares about 12,5% of his DNA with Arya (okay, maybe a tad more because of the intermarriages in house stark, but I really don\u2019t feel like going through all the trouble to calculate that as well. It\u2019s not going to be as severe as the incest of House Targaryen) and they still look super alike because they both inherited the same dominant genes. </p><p>After reading all 5201 words of this, you will hopefully <i>never, ever, ever again</i> write or even think that a) Jon got more genes from his mother and that b) he and Dany might only share as little 1,7% of their DNA. </p><p>Thanks for coming to my TED Talk, isn\u2019t genetics a fascinating topic?\u00a0</p></p>",

There is no conceivable way in which Jon and Dany have as little as 1,7% of their DNA in common. Both those statements are objectively and factually wrong. Jon is half Rhaegar and half Lyanna, no matter how he looks and he and Dany have anything between 30 and 50% of their DNA in common, most likely 44%.<i> I will prove it with science and explain it in excruciating detail. \u00a0</i></p><p>This essay is structured into the following sections: </p><p><b>1.

We falsely believed that it was pretty much meaningless. We are only now starting to understand how much non-coding-DNA influences the way our genetic code works.</p><p>Your DNA is packaged into chromosomes. Every species has a different amount of them, which is the main reason why different species can\u2019t interbreed or why the offspring of different species (Mules, Ligers, etc) tends to be infertile. Human beings have 23 different chromosomes. 22 autosomal ones that are not sex-specific and one sex chromosome (either X or Y) that specifies your biological sex. </p><p>However, only sperm and egg cells have 23 chromosomes, which is called haploid.</p><p>All other cells in your body are diploid, having two different sets of the 22 autosomal chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes (either two X chromosomes if you are biologically female or one X and one Y if you are biologically male). That would look like this:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"147\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5963f1f8f565993e6f7419fdf47cca9/tumblr_inline_pqdmb5QCks1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"147\"></figure><p>You have two sets of chromosomes because you inherited one set from your mother and one set from your father. You always owe half of your genetic material to your father and half to your mother, no matter who you resemble more.</p><p>You also have DNA that isn\u2019t packaged into chromosomes. For example your mitochondrial DNA which is only inherited through your mother. When compared to your chromosomal DNA however, it\u2019s amount is so minuscule that it won\u2019t influence how closely you are related to your mother and father in any meaningful way. (And no, mitochondrial DNA does not influence your appearance so this isn\u2019t the reason why Jon resembles Lyanna more than Rhaegar.)</p><p>Gametes (sperm and eggs) only have one set of chromosomes because they are going to be combined with the set of another person to produce a new human being. That human being will again have two sets, one paternal (from the father) and one maternal (from the mother).</p><p>Your paternal and maternal chromosome 1 (for example) are called an homologous pair. The genes present on each will have the same general job, they will however not be exactly the same due to random mutations and genetic variety. Mutations can lead to the same genes working in slightly different ways. (eg coding for brown or blue eyes. They still both influence eye color.) Every human being has the genes that make him a human, but humans still aren\u2019t exact copies of one another. </p><p> Different variations of the same gene are called alleles. You can either have the same alleles on both chromosomes, what is called homozygosity, or you can have two different alleles on each chromosome, which is called <i><b>heterozygosity</b></i>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/acfd3e1ae93184ce713a2637b7689600/tumblr_inline_pqih8ejy1v1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"512\"></figure><p>\n\nThese variations in alleles for each gene is why people look the way they look. To find out why people sometimes resemble one parent more than the other, we have to look at how these different alleles can interact with one another.\n\n</p><h2><b>2. Genotype vs Phenotype / dominant, recessive, co-dominate and intermediate inheritance</b></h2><p><b></b></p><p>Genotype = your actual genetic code in its entirety </p><p>Phenotype = what traits (appearance, behavior, diseases, metabolism, etc) can be observed</p><p>Someone\u2019s phenotype doesn\u2019t necessarily tell you what exact genes they carry. Here\u2019s why:</p><h2>2.1 Dominant vs recessive</h2><p>In \n\nsome cases one allele will be dominant and the other recessive. This means that the dominant trait will always be expressed when present, while the recessive one will be expressed only if no dominant allele is. If one dominant and one recessive allele is present, if you are heterozygous for that specific gene, the dominant one is expressed while the recessive one is only \u201ccarried\u201d. You can still pass it to the next\n\ngeneration.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"403\" data-orig-height=\"263\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3b0886e292f78e35d54d41deb70d0db/tumblr_inline_pqdmbzNMuz1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"403\" data-orig-height=\"263\"></figure><p>\n\nTwo people could carry the allele for a recessive trait without even knowing it (due to it being silenced by the dominant one) and still have a \u00bc chance of producing a child with that recessive trait.\n\n</p><figure data-orig-width=\"412\" data-orig-height=\"267\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/153fe36aa961224693ab94d957ebc919/tumblr_inline_pqdmc5JFWA1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"412\" data-orig-height=\"267\"></figure><p>The children in this case did not inherit more genetic makeup from their father, they simply ended up expressing the dominant trait inherited from him and not the recessive one inherited from their mother. However, all children in this setup will end up carrying the recessive allele and can potentially pass it on to their children.</p><p>One of the few traits in human appearance that are inherited monogenic (only one gene is responsible for a specific trait) \u00a0and dominant-recessive. Your type of hair-line would be one example.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e05a332b4b06a607f3bcf1bba5d29ba/tumblr_inline_pqihoaCzuB1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><p>\n\nIf neither you, nor your wife have a widow\u2019s peak, your children won\u2019t have one either, since you are both homozygous for a recessive trait.\n\n</p><figure data-orig-width=\"406\" data-orig-height=\"298\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9bfd7c4dbac51957ed368aa62b63f3d8/tumblr_inline_pqii4rYdF51ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"406\" data-orig-height=\"298\"></figure><p>If one of them does have one \u2026 it might be time to call Jerry Springer. </p><p>We believed for a long time that hair- and eye-color are also inherited like this (with darker colors being dominant and lighter ones being recessive) but we do now know that things are more complicated than this and that several genes (and epigenetic factors) are involved in deciding your hair color. </p><p>Generally speaking however, both darker eyes and darker hair tend to be dominant. It thus makes perfect sense that the child of these two people:\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"839\" data-orig-height=\"629\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa78b84fd376a12cb5ef4b49ef1a07de/tumblr_inline_pqiixtUwFH1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"839\" data-orig-height=\"629\"></figure><p>is most likely to take after his mother\u2019s darker coloration.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"520\" data-orig-height=\"312\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/64d4a3dc961b2694907cb730025497f2/tumblr_inline_pqij2ieN5f1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"520\" data-orig-height=\"312\"></figure><p>Not because he inherited all his \u201chair and eye color genes\u201d from her and none from his father, but because his mother\u2019s genes are more dominant and will thus be visible in his phenotype. He still carries some \u201cblond\u201d alleles from his father and could have blond children if whoever woman he has children with, also has \u201cblond\u201d alleles. </p><p>Ned figured out that Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen are NOT Robert\u2019s children with the exact same logic. Every time a black-haired Baratheon had children with a blonde woman, their children had black hair. Which is pretty consistent with real life. None of Robert\u2019s children with Cersei following this trend was just too much of a coincidence. </p><p>This is the main reason why genetic diversity and avoiding inbreeding is so important. The more closely people are related, the more likely the are to carry the same recessive alleles for a specific condition, the more likely they are to have a child with a condition. As good as every person alive carries recessive alleles for one disease or another, but, not reproducing with people we are closely related to, makes it unlikely to meet up with a person who carries the exact same recessive alleles as you.</p><p>The coefficient of inbreeding tells you how likely it is that a person is homozygous for a specific allele by descent. It is actually impossible to accurately calculate for House Targaryen, because we do not know how many generations ago they started marrying their siblings. Even generous approximations (assuming the Aegon I was the first to incest) sets it way higher for Daenerys than for any known real human that has ever lived. But since we don\u2019t care about Dany\u2019s risk for recessive disorders, but only her relation to Jon, we are just going to ignore this. Only bringing it up because it is a thing.\u00a0</p><h2>2.2 Co-dominant alleles</h2><p>Co-dominant \n\nalleles will both be expressed to the same amount, none of them is dominant enough to silence the other. They can however still be fully dominant against a third trait. The ABO system of blood types would be an example of this in human beings. The traits for blood type A and B are both dominant to O, but co-dominant to each other. This means that a couple where one has the blood type A and one has the blood type B have equal chances of producing a child with any of the four blood types if they are heterozygous and carry the allele for O as\n\n well.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"406\" data-orig-height=\"384\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4ee807f39256d198ad76571365a1333/tumblr_inline_pqdmd8U57K1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"406\" data-orig-height=\"384\"></figure><p>A \n\nchild ending up with blood type A ( A == phenotype, AO == genotype) didn\u2019t inherit \u201cmore genes\u201d from its mother because she shares the same blood type. It merely inherited a dominant trait from its mother and a recessive trait from its\n\n father.</p><h2>2.3 Intermediate inheritance</h2><p>The third most common way for alleles to interact is the intermediate one. Meaning that if two different alleles that code for two different traits are present, the phenotype will be a mix between the two. If a flower\u2019s color is inherited this way, a white and red flower will produce pink ones.</p><p>This is for example how human skin color is inherited. In reality, it is an immensely complex process that we don\u2019t fully understand yet, but simplified: We have numerous genes that code for the production of melanin in our skin and certain mutations lead to a reduced production, leading to lighter skin.</p><p>Let\u2019s assume we have only three genes A, B and C that all contribute the same amount to the color of our skin (in reality it\u2019s much more and not all have the same influence, there are also epigenetic influences but we are trying to keep this simple here): An uppercase letter means that the gene will contribute to melanin-production, a lowercase letter is a mutation that will not. Three genes on two chromosomes makes six alleles in total. Having six \u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cmelanin-points\u201d will lead to the darkest skin coloration possible while having zero means producing no melanin at all.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"347\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d80873a5de91f3901ae3f48efd68d266/tumblr_inline_pqdmlgoPEi1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"347\"></figure><p>Even \n\nin this extremely simplified version we only have 7 phenotypes and 24 different genotypes showing once again that simply looking at someone doesn\u2019t tell you all that much about what specific genes they are made of. Let\u2019s look at a little example of what would happen if a dark-skinned man and light-skinned woman had a\n\nchild:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"353\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1cf1af773d2559cbc5f330f5c9983e4/tumblr_inline_pqdmlqxXYh1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"353\"></figure><p>Their child would have a 50% chance of its skin color being a perfect mix between the two and a 25% each, of being a bit more on the light or the dark side.</p><p>A child ending up inheriting 4/6 \u201cmelanin-points\u201d would not be more closely related to its father and a child ending up with lighter skin would not be more closely related to its mother. \u00a0</p><p>This is of course far more complex in real life but it can occasionally lead to mix-raced couples having children with vastly different skin tones. It\u2019s the most obvious (and cute) when it happens to fraternal twins (twins that are only as related as normal siblings and don\u2019t share 100% of their <i>DNA</i>).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"284\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c30b98a9ba404755fd73ed7528c4b01/tumblr_inline_pqdp3qxmWl1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"284\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"460\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb8b35578401accbd6376361397c750f/tumblr_inline_pqdp3r4P8h1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"460\"></figure><p>These children are 50% mom and 50% dad, they are in no way more closely related to their black or white parent. The one with darker skin just happened to inherit more alleles coding for the production of melanin and statistical improbabilities can sometimes lead to extreme variations.</p><p>This also goes the other way around. I won\u2019t write out all possible genotypes (it would be 64 in total) but here are the probabilities if both parents are medium-dark-skinned:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"435\" data-orig-height=\"390\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/673ed475fad21fe7a87fe03041fae0d1/tumblr_inline_pqdmo5942M1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"435\" data-orig-height=\"390\"></figure><p>While highly unlikely, two people with medium-dark skin can have children with far darker or far lighter skin. Genetics can be weird like that.</p><p>Some alleles involved in hair- and eye-color also interact like this, instead of dominant/recessive. </p><p>So, now that we have that out of the way there is only one more thing we have to cover before moving on to the topic of how related you are to what relative. It gets a bit more complicated when it comes to siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc but with your parents IT IS ALWAYS 50/50. ALWAYS.</p><h2><b>3. Mitosis and Meiosis</b></h2><p><b><i>Mitosis\u00a0</i></b>is the process of normal body cells duplicating themselves. One mother-cell produces two identical daughter-cells with the exact same DNA. We don\u2019t need to get too into detail here, what\u2019s important is that the initial two (!) sets of chromosomes are copied perfectly, leading to 4 sets of chromosomes being present temporarily and later the mother-cell dividing itself into two new cells who take two sets of chromosomes each with them. Creating two completely normal diploid cells. </p><p>Meiosis is the creation of four haploid germ cells out of one diploid cell. Four (4) because this process starts out the same way as mitosis: by duplicating the existing diploid chromosome set. Meiosis produces four haploid cells instead of two diploid ones is the one big difference. The other being the recombination of your homologous pairs of chromosomes. What happens is that some portion of the paternal chromosome will be swapped with the same portion of the maternal chromosome.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"443\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5724bcdfb48c5220d37f5687104d2cb/tumblr_inline_pqdmozZbpj1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"443\"></figure><p>\n\nThis \n\n is also called \u201ccrossing over\u201d and just like sexual reproduction itself, it increases the genetic diversity of someone\u2019s offspring. The newly created germ cell won\u2019t simple receive one half of the maternal or paternal chromosome, but can potentially inherit a random combination of the\n\n two.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"771\" data-orig-height=\"598\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc3dec2be0607b9403411cec3bdf2b1b/tumblr_inline_pqiobsaIBa1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"771\" data-orig-height=\"598\"></figure><p>This is what the article you read talked about. In the example above Child 2 inherited far more DNA from it\u2019s maternal grandmother than grandfather. This will however only influence how closely related the children are to their grandparents and to themselves. They still share 50% of their DNA with their mother and 50% with their father. </p><p>This will happen with all 23 chromosome pairs and will most likely average out to 50% shared DNA between siblings, 25% between grandparents/grandchildren, etc. Those number are of course only averages and there is indeed some range. If through pure coincidence child 2 consistently inherits a bit more from it\u2019s maternal grandmother, it will indeed be more closely related to her than to its maternal grandfather. It still doesn\u2019t change its degree of relationship to its mother or father. Which are, by the way, all things the author of that article mentions.</p><p>The less closely related two people are, and the more crossovers can occur, the bigger that range gets respectively and the more likely it is that their actual shared amount will deviate from the statistically expected one. With close relatives like aunt/nephew however, the expected amount of shared DNA is vastly bigger than 1,7% even when working with the lower limit of that range. Why that is, is what we\u2019ll talk about next:</p><h2><b>4. The 1,7% \u2026 were based on outdated, flawed data</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"294\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a16d02bb78cd12126c0edb13b5464560/tumblr_inline_pqdmpiTiXT1ulwf0y_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"294\"></figure><p>Some things about this chart \u2026 just don\u2019t look right.</p><p>The average cM for Aunt/Uncle is stated to be 1703, the range given is 121 - 2227. One should think that random processes like this would lead to a Gaussian normal distribution, but while the highest cM given is 524 points higher than average, the lowest is 1582 (!!!) lower. An almost three times bigger deviation. That doesn\u2019t sound right.</p><p>Also, other relations of the same degree (with similar averages) have extremely different ranges:</p><p>Grandparents: Avg: 1760, <b>875</b> - 2365 </p><p>Half-Sibling: Avg: 1731, <b>787</b> - 2134</p><p>The same is true for other relations of the same degree. Half-niece/Half-nephew having a lower range of 540, while first cousins only have 83 (!!!) , Great Aunt/Uncle having 236, Great-Grandparents having 547.</p><p><b>This all looks immensely inconsistent.</b></p><p>After doing some digging I found out that this chart was created by the \u201cShared cM Project\u201d that introduces itself like so:</p><blockquote><p><i><a href=\"https://thegeneticgenealogist.com/2015/05/29/the-shared-cm-project/\">The Shared cM Project</a> is a collaborative data collection and analysis project created to understand the ranges of shared centiMorgans associated with various known relationships.

Whatever could go wrong? When you have to rely on people knowing for certain whose sperm produced which child? Except for people not being quite as closely related to each other as they think they are \u2026.

Which also sounds a lot more reasonable than 1,7%. </p><p>Another thing to keep in mind when looking at these numbers is that DNA-tests are not necessarily 100% accurate. Whether your DNA is compared to somebody else\u2019s by a private company like 23&amp;Me or by law enforcement, they are not going to sequence your entire genetic information. The costs for sequencing an entire genome are still estimated to be around 1000$ and ain\u2019t nobody got money for that. What they do instead is look at several distinct sections of your DNA and calculate your degree of relation depending on the matches in differences they find in those. The more sections they look at, they more accurate the results will be but depending on how much money you invest it will be somewhere between fairly and somewhat accurate. </p><p>The information put forward by this project will however get better and better the more data they collect and it\u2019s pretty cool endeavor over all. </p><p>That still doesn\u2019t tell us how closely Jon and Dany are actually related, since this chart does not consider the insane amount of inbreeding that went on in House Targaryen.</p><h2><b>5.

We falsely believed that it was pretty much meaningless. We are only now starting to understand how much non-coding-DNA influences the way our genetic code works.</p><p>Your DNA is packaged into chromosomes. Every species has a different amount of them, which is the main reason why different species can&rsquo;t interbreed or why the offspring of different species (Mules, Ligers, etc) tends to be infertile. Human beings have 23 different chromosomes. 22 autosomal ones that are not sex-specific and one sex chromosome (either X or Y) that specifies your biological sex. </p><p>However, only sperm and egg cells have 23 chromosomes, which is called haploid.</p><p>All other cells in your body are diploid, having two different sets of the 22 autosomal chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes (either two X chromosomes if you are biologically female or one X and one Y if you are biologically male). That would look like this:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5963f1f8f565993e6f7419fdf47cca9/tumblr_inline_pqdmb5QCks1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>You have two sets of chromosomes because you inherited one set from your mother and one set from your father. You always owe half of your genetic material to your father and half to your mother, no matter who you resemble more.</p><p>You also have DNA that isn&rsquo;t packaged into chromosomes. For example your mitochondrial DNA which is only inherited through your mother. When compared to your chromosomal DNA however, it&rsquo;s amount is so minuscule that it won&rsquo;t influence how closely you are related to your mother and father in any meaningful way. (And no, mitochondrial DNA does not influence your appearance so this isn&rsquo;t the reason why Jon resembles Lyanna more than Rhaegar.)</p><p>Gametes (sperm and eggs) only have one set of chromosomes because they are going to be combined with the set of another person to produce a new human being. That human being will again have two sets, one paternal (from the father) and one maternal (from the mother).</p><p>Your paternal and maternal chromosome 1 (for example) are called an homologous pair. The genes present on each will have the same general job, they will however not be exactly the same due to random mutations and genetic variety. Mutations can lead to the same genes working in slightly different ways. (eg coding for brown or blue eyes. They still both influence eye color.) Every human being has the genes that make him a human, but humans still aren&rsquo;t exact copies of one another. </p><p> Different variations of the same gene are called alleles. You can either have the same alleles on both chromosomes, what is called homozygosity, or you can have two different alleles on each chromosome, which is called <i><b>heterozygosity</b></i>.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/acfd3e1ae93184ce713a2637b7689600/tumblr_inline_pqih8ejy1v1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\n\nThese variations in alleles for each gene is why people look the way they look. To find out why people sometimes resemble one parent more than the other, we have to look at how these different alleles can interact with one another.\n\n</p><h2><b>2. Genotype vs Phenotype / dominant, recessive, co-dominate and intermediate inheritance</b></h2><p><b></b></p><p>Genotype = your actual genetic code in its entirety </p><p>Phenotype = what traits (appearance, behavior, diseases, metabolism, etc) can be observed</p><p>Someone&rsquo;s phenotype doesn&rsquo;t necessarily tell you what exact genes they carry. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><h2>2.1 Dominant vs recessive</h2><p>In \n\nsome cases one allele will be dominant and the other recessive. This means that the dominant trait will always be expressed when present, while the recessive one will be expressed only if no dominant allele is. If one dominant and one recessive allele is present, if you are heterozygous for that specific gene, the dominant one is expressed while the recessive one is only &ldquo;carried&rdquo;. You can still pass it to the next\n\ngeneration.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3b0886e292f78e35d54d41deb70d0db/tumblr_inline_pqdmbzNMuz1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\n\nTwo people could carry the allele for a recessive trait without even knowing it (due to it being silenced by the dominant one) and still have a &frac14; chance of producing a child with that recessive trait.\n\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/153fe36aa961224693ab94d957ebc919/tumblr_inline_pqdmc5JFWA1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The children in this case did not inherit more genetic makeup from their father, they simply ended up expressing the dominant trait inherited from him and not the recessive one inherited from their mother.

He still carries some &ldquo;blond&rdquo; alleles from his father and could have blond children if whoever woman he has children with, also has &ldquo;blond&rdquo; alleles. </p><p>Ned figured out that Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen are NOT Robert&rsquo;s children with the exact same logic. Every time a black-haired Baratheon had children with a blonde woman, their children had black hair. Which is pretty consistent with real life. None of Robert&rsquo;s children with Cersei following this trend was just too much of a coincidence. </p><p>This is the main reason why genetic diversity and avoiding inbreeding is so important. The more closely people are related, the more likely the are to carry the same recessive alleles for a specific condition, the more likely they are to have a child with a condition. As good as every person alive carries recessive alleles for one disease or another, but, not reproducing with people we are closely related to, makes it unlikely to meet up with a person who carries the exact same recessive alleles as you.</p><p>The coefficient of inbreeding tells you how likely it is that a person is homozygous for a specific allele by descent. It is actually impossible to accurately calculate for House Targaryen, because we do not know how many generations ago they started marrying their siblings. Even generous approximations (assuming the Aegon I was the first to incest) sets it way higher for Daenerys than for any known real human that has ever lived. But since we don&rsquo;t care about Dany&rsquo;s risk for recessive disorders, but only her relation to Jon, we are just going to ignore this. Only bringing it up because it is a thing.&nbsp;</p><h2>2.2 Co-dominant alleles</h2><p>Co-dominant \n\nalleles will both be expressed to the same amount, none of them is dominant enough to silence the other. They can however still be fully dominant against a third trait. The ABO system of blood types would be an example of this in human beings. The traits for blood type A and B are both dominant to O, but co-dominant to each other. This means that a couple where one has the blood type A and one has the blood type B have equal chances of producing a child with any of the four blood types if they are heterozygous and carry the allele for O as\n\n well.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4ee807f39256d198ad76571365a1333/tumblr_inline_pqdmd8U57K1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A \n\nchild ending up with blood type A ( A == phenotype, AO == genotype) didn&rsquo;t inherit &ldquo;more genes&rdquo; from its mother because she shares the same blood type. It merely inherited a dominant trait from its mother and a recessive trait from its\n\n father.</p><h2>2.3 Intermediate inheritance</h2><p>The third most common way for alleles to interact is the intermediate one. Meaning that if two different alleles that code for two different traits are present, the phenotype will be a mix between the two. If a flower&rsquo;s color is inherited this way, a white and red flower will produce pink ones.</p><p>This is for example how human skin color is inherited. In reality, it is an immensely complex process that we don&rsquo;t fully understand yet, but simplified: We have numerous genes that code for the production of melanin in our skin and certain mutations lead to a reduced production, leading to lighter skin.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s assume we have only three genes A, B and C that all contribute the same amount to the color of our skin (in reality it&rsquo;s much more and not all have the same influence, there are also epigenetic influences but we are trying to keep this simple here): An uppercase letter means that the gene will contribute to melanin-production, a lowercase letter is a mutation that will not. Three genes on two chromosomes makes six alleles in total. Having six &hellip; let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;melanin-points&rdquo; will lead to the darkest skin coloration possible while having zero means producing no melanin at all.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d80873a5de91f3901ae3f48efd68d266/tumblr_inline_pqdmlgoPEi1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Even \n\nin this extremely simplified version we only have 7 phenotypes and 24 different genotypes showing once again that simply looking at someone doesn&rsquo;t tell you all that much about what specific genes they are made of. Let&rsquo;s look at a little example of what would happen if a dark-skinned man and light-skinned woman had a\n\nchild:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1cf1af773d2559cbc5f330f5c9983e4/tumblr_inline_pqdmlqxXYh1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Their child would have a 50% chance of its skin color being a perfect mix between the two and a 25% each, of being a bit more on the light or the dark side.</p><p>A child ending up inheriting 4/6 &ldquo;melanin-points&rdquo; would not be more closely related to its father and a child ending up with lighter skin would not be more closely related to its mother. &nbsp;</p><p>This is of course far more complex in real life but it can occasionally lead to mix-raced couples having children with vastly different skin tones. It&rsquo;s the most obvious (and cute) when it happens to fraternal twins (twins that are only as related as normal siblings and don&rsquo;t share 100% of their <i>DNA</i>).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c30b98a9ba404755fd73ed7528c4b01/tumblr_inline_pqdp3qxmWl1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb8b35578401accbd6376361397c750f/tumblr_inline_pqdp3r4P8h1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>These children are 50% mom and 50% dad, they are in no way more closely related to their black or white parent. The one with darker skin just happened to inherit more alleles coding for the production of melanin and statistical improbabilities can sometimes lead to extreme variations.</p><p>This also goes the other way around. I won&rsquo;t write out all possible genotypes (it would be 64 in total) but here are the probabilities if both parents are medium-dark-skinned:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/673ed475fad21fe7a87fe03041fae0d1/tumblr_inline_pqdmo5942M1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>While highly unlikely, two people with medium-dark skin can have children with far darker or far lighter skin. Genetics can be weird like that.</p><p>Some alleles involved in hair- and eye-color also interact like this, instead of dominant/recessive. </p><p>So, now that we have that out of the way there is only one more thing we have to cover before moving on to the topic of how related you are to what relative. It gets a bit more complicated when it comes to siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc but with your parents IT IS ALWAYS 50/50. ALWAYS.</p><h2><b>3. Mitosis and Meiosis</b></h2><p><b><i>Mitosis&nbsp;</i></b>is the process of normal body cells duplicating themselves. One mother-cell produces two identical daughter-cells with the exact same DNA. We don&rsquo;t need to get too into detail here, what&rsquo;s important is that the initial two (!) sets of chromosomes are copied perfectly, leading to 4 sets of chromosomes being present temporarily and later the mother-cell dividing itself into two new cells who take two sets of chromosomes each with them. Creating two completely normal diploid cells. </p><p>Meiosis is the creation of four haploid germ cells out of one diploid cell. Four (4) because this process starts out the same way as mitosis: by duplicating the existing diploid chromosome set. Meiosis produces four haploid cells instead of two diploid ones is the one big difference. The other being the recombination of your homologous pairs of chromosomes. What happens is that some portion of the paternal chromosome will be swapped with the same portion of the maternal chromosome.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5724bcdfb48c5220d37f5687104d2cb/tumblr_inline_pqdmozZbpj1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\n\nThis \n\n is also called &ldquo;crossing over&rdquo; and just like sexual reproduction itself, it increases the genetic diversity of someone&rsquo;s offspring. The newly created germ cell won&rsquo;t simple receive one half of the maternal or paternal chromosome, but can potentially inherit a random combination of the\n\n two.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc3dec2be0607b9403411cec3bdf2b1b/tumblr_inline_pqiobsaIBa1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is what the article you read talked about. In the example above Child 2 inherited far more DNA from it&rsquo;s maternal grandmother than grandfather. This will however only influence how closely related the children are to their grandparents and to themselves. They still share 50% of their DNA with their mother and 50% with their father. </p><p>This will happen with all 23 chromosome pairs and will most likely average out to 50% shared DNA between siblings, 25% between grandparents/grandchildren, etc. Those number are of course only averages and there is indeed some range. If through pure coincidence child 2 consistently inherits a bit more from it&rsquo;s maternal grandmother, it will indeed be more closely related to her than to its maternal grandfather. It still doesn&rsquo;t change its degree of relationship to its mother or father. Which are, by the way, all things the author of that article mentions.</p><p>The less closely related two people are, and the more crossovers can occur, the bigger that range gets respectively and the more likely it is that their actual shared amount will deviate from the statistically expected one. With close relatives like aunt/nephew however, the expected amount of shared DNA is vastly bigger than 1,7% even when working with the lower limit of that range. Why that is, is what we&rsquo;ll talk about next:</p><h2><b>4. The 1,7% &hellip; were based on outdated, flawed data</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a16d02bb78cd12126c0edb13b5464560/tumblr_inline_pqdmpiTiXT1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Some things about this chart &hellip; just don&rsquo;t look right.</p><p>The average cM for Aunt/Uncle is stated to be 1703, the range given is 121 - 2227. One should think that random processes like this would lead to a Gaussian normal distribution, but while the highest cM given is 524 points higher than average, the lowest is 1582 (!!!) lower. An almost three times bigger deviation. That doesn&rsquo;t sound right.</p><p>Also, other relations of the same degree (with similar averages) have extremely different ranges:</p><p>Grandparents: Avg: 1760, <b>875</b> - 2365 </p><p>Half-Sibling: Avg: 1731, <b>787</b> - 2134</p><p>The same is true for other relations of the same degree. Half-niece/Half-nephew having a lower range of 540, while first cousins only have 83 (!!!) , Great Aunt/Uncle having 236, Great-Grandparents having 547.</p><p><b>This all looks immensely inconsistent.</b></p><p>After doing some digging I found out that this chart was created by the &ldquo;Shared cM Project&rdquo; that introduces itself like so:</p><blockquote><p><i><a href=\"https://thegeneticgenealogist.com/2015/05/29/the-shared-cm-project/\">The Shared cM Project</a> is a collaborative data collection and analysis project created to understand the ranges of shared centiMorgans associated with various known relationships.

(and they probably shouldn&rsquo;t have included the absolute minimum and maximum but the 99 percentile as they did here)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/113d81080be18fb62b5af096ba892598/tumblr_inline_pqezki9KIp1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Average cM and range for Aunt/Uncle from 2015: &nbsp;1703, <b>121</b> - 2227.<br />Average cM and range for Aunt/Uncle from 2018: &nbsp;1750, <b>1349</b> - 2175.</p><p>That looks &hellip; more reasonable. A lot more reasonable to be honest. Which would put the lowest possible amount of shared DNA between Aunt/Uncle and Niece/Nephew according to this data at &hellip; 19,27%. Which also sounds a lot more reasonable than 1,7%. </p><p>Another thing to keep in mind when looking at these numbers is that DNA-tests are not necessarily 100% accurate. Whether your DNA is compared to somebody else&rsquo;s by a private company like 23&amp;Me or by law enforcement, they are not going to sequence your entire genetic information. The costs for sequencing an entire genome are still estimated to be around 1000$ and ain&rsquo;t nobody got money for that. What they do instead is look at several distinct sections of your DNA and calculate your degree of relation depending on the matches in differences they find in those. The more sections they look at, they more accurate the results will be but depending on how much money you invest it will be somewhere between fairly and somewhat accurate. </p><p>The information put forward by this project will however get better and better the more data they collect and it&rsquo;s pretty cool endeavor over all. </p><p>That still doesn&rsquo;t tell us how closely Jon and Dany are actually related, since this chart does not consider the insane amount of inbreeding that went on in House Targaryen.</p><h2><b>5.

I didn&rsquo;t just pull them out of my ass, so let me \n\n explain:</p><h2>5.1 Calculating the coefficient of relationship</h2><p>That percentage is also called the coefficient of relationship. It tells you what percentage of DNA two people are expected to share by common ancestry. The easiest way to calculate it is through drawing a family tree and simply counting lines. The more generations that family tree includes, showing also any degree of inbreeding in the past, the more accurate the calculation is. Using the last three or four will however be sufficiently accurate in most cases. </p><p>This is your average family tree without any inbreeding:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fd14fc883d62b7ae3ec1631c79db989/tumblr_inline_pqi8sbw5tu1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>To find out how much DNA the siblings John and Jane Doe have in common, you look at all common ancestors through which they are related, ie through which you can draw paths from one to the other without passing through the same ancestor twice. In this case, this is only true for their parents. Let&rsquo;s simplify their family tree down to that relationship.</p><p>I have included their grandparents to highlight why they can&rsquo;t be used in the same way. If you were to connect John and Jane through one of them you would always have to go back through either their father and mother and passing through the same person twice isn&rsquo;t allowed.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6463f7bdbe255ec8d9c0e0ad56fda351/tumblr_inline_pqi973fIgj1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There is one unique path through which they are connected through their first common ancestor: Their father. </p><p>Now, what does the number of line segments tell us? As stated above Jane Doe and Joe Doe are each going to inherit &frac12; of their fathers DNA. Put differently, each part of Papa Doe&rsquo;s DNA has an equal chance to be inherited or not. </p><p>It&rsquo;s like flipping coins, there is a &frac12; chance to get heads and a &frac12; chance to get tails and if you flip a coin several times it will show heads &frac12; of the time and tails &frac12; of the time. This essay has already gotten way out of hand already and I don&rsquo;t want go into the basics of probability calculation as well but I promised to explain all this in excruciating detail so I guess I have no choice. </p><p>You have 1000 thousand coins, flip them and lay them out in a row. ~500 of them will show head, ~500 of them show tails. Heads symbolizes the half of dad&rsquo;s DNA that is passed on to the firstborn child, tails is the half that isn&rsquo;t. This symbolizes the 50% of Joe Doe&rsquo;s DNA that John inherited, symbolized by line 1 in the graphic above.</p><p>You do the same thing once again for the second child and lay out the row next to that of it&rsquo;s older sibling. That&rsquo;s the 50% Jane inherited from her father, that&rsquo;s line 2 in the chart. </p><p>To find out how much DNA inherited from their father it has in common with its older sibling, you look at all their coins that show heads and count how often their siblings coin next to it also shows heads. </p><p>Since you are again looking at a sample of randomly flipped coins, about &frac12; of them will show heads and half of them won&rsquo;t. That means &frac14; (one half of one half or &frac12; x &frac12;) of the coin pairs will both show heads, meaning that &frac14; of their DNA is identical through inheriting the same genes from their father. &nbsp;</p><p>One (1) line segment simply stands for a probability of &frac12;, and since 2^-1 is just another way of writing &frac12; we will use this notation. (2^-2 being equal to &frac12;, 2^-2 to &frac14;, 2^-3 to 1/8, 2^-4 to 1/16 and so on and so forth.)</p><p>The amount of identical DNA two people inherited from a common ancestor is 2^-[amount of line segments]. </p><p>In this case it&rsquo;s two lines, so 2^-2 = &frac14; = 0,25 = 25%.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99edb66638af521718e5b33e4d08af58/tumblr_inline_pqi973DdSr1ulwf0y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>We do the same thing for their second common ancestor, their mother, and also get 2^-2.

He &ldquo;only&rdquo; shares about 25% of his DNA with Ned and about 44% with Daenerys and that is a fact. While big differences in shared genes might make a bit of a difference in which grandmother you resemble more, that effect is going to be dwarfed by the interplay of dominant and recessive alleles. He only shares about 12,5% of his DNA with Arya (okay, maybe a tad more because of the intermarriages in house stark, but I really don&rsquo;t feel like going through all the trouble to calculate that as well. It&rsquo;s not going to be as severe as the incest of House Targaryen) and they still look super alike because they both inherited the same dominant genes. </p><p>After reading all 5201 words of this, you will hopefully <i>never, ever, ever again</i> write or even think that a) Jon got more genes from his mother and that b) he and Dany might only share as little 1,7% of their DNA. </p><p>Thanks for coming to my TED Talk, isn&rsquo;t genetics a fascinating topic?&nbsp;</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<h2><b>Plus: How closely are Jon and Daenerys related exactly?&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<p>Dear <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqXUcYMoPUXuKOybBjHaanQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqXUcYMoPUXuKOybBjHaanQ\">@iheartdandelions</a>, this this is no way supposed to be an attack on you but I&rsquo;ve seen you claim that Jon is more closely related to his mother than his father one too many times and felt the need to clear some things up. See this as an opportunity to learn something about this fascinating topic, rather than becoming defensive about it. You misunderstood or misinterpreted a lot of the things stated in <a href=\"https://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/range-shared-dna-between-relatives\">this article</a> and I just have to point them out. </p>\n<p>What this isn&rsquo;t about: I am not making a point about incest being necessarily bad in the asoiaf universe. I&rsquo;m not arguing that Jon and Dany&rsquo;s close genetic relation is a reason for them to not be together. I will not even talk about it. I don&rsquo;t care. This isn&rsquo;t about ships but scientific accuracy. </p>\n<p>What this is about: Jon did not &ldquo;inherit more genetic makeup from Lyanna than Rhaegar&rdquo; because he looks like her. There is no conceivable way in which Jon and Dany have as little as 1,7% of their DNA in common. Both those statements are objectively and factually wrong. Jon is half Rhaegar and half Lyanna, no matter how he looks and he and Dany have anything between 30 and 50% of their DNA in common, most likely 44%.<i> I will prove it with science and explain it in excruciating detail. &nbsp;</i></p>\n<p>This essay is structured into the following sections: </p>\n<p><b>1. DNA, Genes, Chromosomes and Alleles</b></p>\n<p><b>2. Genotype vs Phenotype / Dominant, recessive, co-dominant and intermediate inheritance</b></p>\n<p><b>3. Mitosis and Meiosis</b></p>\n<p><b>4. The 1,7% were based on outdated, flawed data </b></p>\n<p><b>5. Targcest vs Nocest / the coefficient of relationship and how closely Jon and Dany are actually related</b></p>\n<p>Anyone who thinks they don&rsquo;t need to refresh their knowledge on basic human genetics can feel free to jump to the last section. It might still be interesting. </p>\n</p>",

Only a few other examples of lyrical (and diegetic) tunes have shown up previously on Thrones: \u201cThe Rains of Castamere,\u201d the Lannister war song, and \u201cThe Bear and the Maiden Fair,\u201d a bawdy drinking tune. I met with Djawadi last year <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/game-of-thrones-music-ramin-djawadi/583213/\">for a glimpse at his process</a>, and after hearing the new song\u2014as well as its haunting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTa1jHk1Lxc\">cover by Florence and the Machine</a>\u2014I spoke with him again, this time about the musical material heard thus far in <i>Thrones</i>\u2019 final season. This conversation has been edited.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p><b>Spencer Kornhaber: Tell me about your assignment for \u201cJenny of Oldstones.\u201d</b></p><p>Ramin Djawadi: That came together like some of the other songs we\u2019ve done in the past, like \u201cRains of Castamere.\u201d The song was written into the show, so they needed this piece before they were shooting. Normally I come in after the episodes were shot. But this one, they gave me the lyrics and said, \u201cWrite us a song.\u201d</p><p><b>Kornhaber: How do you approach writing a song with lyrics when most of your music is instrumental?</b></p><p>Djawadi: It\u2019s definitely different because I already have something preexisting. I try to find the rhythm within the lyrics and put a melody to it where, when you sing the song, it just feels natural. A lot of times, you\u2019d think the song comes first and then you put lyrics to it, but there are definitely occasions\u2014Elton John being a very famous example\u2014where the lyrics exist before.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: So you read the lyrics and hear music in them. How would you describe the mood, the tone, that you felt the words called for?</b></p><p>Djawadi: Definitely something somber. Obviously it\u2019s the night before the big expected battle. It\u2019s haunting and lonely. Those things that go on in your head when you think, Are we going to die? That\u2019s what I was going for.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Florence Welch said it reminded her of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/arts/television/game-of-thrones-florence-and-the-machine.html\">a Celtic folk song</a>.\u201d When you\u2019re writing a song that\u2019s supposed to exist within the world of the show, do you look to any historical sources or styles of music that seem like what they\u2019d be singing in Westeros?</b></p><p>Djawadi: Not really. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. We\u2019ve done it with the score as well: I try to stay away from something that you might expect from a medieval time. Obviously it can\u2019t be a song that\u2019s so contemporary in terms of harmony and melody that it feels completely out of place. But also I don\u2019t want to write it specifically, stylistically, for medieval times. I just try to come up with a melody that is hummable and memorable.</p><p>I love [Welch\u2019s] version of it. It\u2019s beautifully performed. The version I sent to her was very stripped down, and she did an amazing interpretation.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: What did you think of the voice of Daniel Portman, the actor who plays Podrick?</b></p><p>Djawadi: I was really impressed. His version is very toned down and, in fact, the harmonies in that version I simplified even more from how I originally had written the song. I almost wanted him to sing it a cappella. Florence\u2019s version is like I originally wrote it, with more chord changes.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Do you think the lyrics are reflecting anything going on in the show, or is this just the song that happened to come into Podrick\u2019s mind?</b></p><p>Djawadi: That\u2019s open to interpretation, right? Clearly the relationship dilemma with Jon and Daenerys you could relate to Duncan and Jenny. Now that [Jon] knows who he is, and Dany knows who he is, you can draw a comparison to the conflict or the decision to come.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: The other powerful musical moment in that episode came with Brienne\u2019s knighting. What are we hearing in that scene?</b></p><p>Djawadi: That is actually a theme that we had used for Jaime and Brienne before: the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebt6aag3MN4\">Honor\u201d theme</a>. We\u2019ve used it in other moments when somebody does something honorable, [like] when the Hound <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMF72eOuYpU\">buries the bodies</a> in that house [in Season 7, Episode 1]. It\u2019s one of my favorites. It\u2019s such a beautiful and emotional theme we don\u2019t get to use as much.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: So it\u2019s a theme tied not to a character but rather to an abstract concept. What are the show\u2019s other themes like that?</b></p><p>Djawadi: One we had kind of became the Littlefinger theme. We called it the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT44WrZMXaM\">Conspiracy\u201d theme</a>. In the early seasons, there was a lot of backstabbing going on\u2014I guess it\u2019s the opposite of the \u201cHonor\u201d theme.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Jon and Daenerys have their \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78O0L3bhGV4\">Love\u201d theme</a>, which came out in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvtjhvWabc0\">dragon-riding portion</a> of the season premiere.</b></p><p>Djawadi: That was just a fun scene. It\u2019s playful in a way, but also very powerful because he\u2019s learning to ride the dragon. The arrangement was big, with percussion. There\u2019s a hint of danger.</p><p>What was interesting in Episode 1 was that a lot of the themes had callbacks to Season 1. For example, when Bran and Jaime meet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyYeWyM7upI\">at the very end of the episode</a>, that definitely is a callback <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcEqNiODyo\">to the original</a>, from their first interaction. Jon and Dany arriving at the beginning with their army was a callback to the king\u2019s arrival from Season 1. Obviously the footage is very similar\u2014how everybody in Winterfell was lined up\u2014so we drew similarities to the original cue there.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Did you write any other original songs for this last season?</b></p><p>Djawadi: Every season, I\u2019ve developed existing themes, and there\u2019s always been room to write some new material and new themes. We definitely have that as well this season. I can say that much.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Have any of those new themes shown up in these two episodes?</b></p><p>Djawadi: I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s coming.</p></blockquote>",

This conversation has been edited.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p><b>Spencer Kornhaber: Tell me about your assignment for \u201cJenny of Oldstones.\u201d</b></p><p>Ramin Djawadi: That came together like some of the other songs we\u2019ve done in the past, like \u201cRains of Castamere.\u201d The song was written into the show, so they needed this piece before they were shooting. Normally I come in after the episodes were shot. But this one, they gave me the lyrics and said, \u201cWrite us a song.\u201d</p><p><b>Kornhaber: How do you approach writing a song with lyrics when most of your music is instrumental?</b></p><p>Djawadi: It\u2019s definitely different because I already have something preexisting. I try to find the rhythm within the lyrics and put a melody to it where, when you sing the song, it just feels natural. A lot of times, you\u2019d think the song comes first and then you put lyrics to it, but there are definitely occasions\u2014Elton John being a very famous example\u2014where the lyrics exist before.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: So you read the lyrics and hear music in them. How would you describe the mood, the tone, that you felt the words called for?</b></p><p>Djawadi: Definitely something somber. Obviously it\u2019s the night before the big expected battle. It\u2019s haunting and lonely. Those things that go on in your head when you think, Are we going to die? That\u2019s what I was going for.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Florence Welch said it reminded her of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/arts/television/game-of-thrones-florence-and-the-machine.html\">a Celtic folk song</a>.\u201d When you\u2019re writing a song that\u2019s supposed to exist within the world of the show, do you look to any historical sources or styles of music that seem like what they\u2019d be singing in Westeros?</b></p><p>Djawadi: Not really. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. We\u2019ve done it with the score as well: I try to stay away from something that you might expect from a medieval time. Obviously it can\u2019t be a song that\u2019s so contemporary in terms of harmony and melody that it feels completely out of place. But also I don\u2019t want to write it specifically, stylistically, for medieval times. I just try to come up with a melody that is hummable and memorable.</p><p>I love [Welch\u2019s] version of it. It\u2019s beautifully performed. The version I sent to her was very stripped down, and she did an amazing interpretation.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: What did you think of the voice of Daniel Portman, the actor who plays Podrick?</b></p><p>Djawadi: I was really impressed. His version is very toned down and, in fact, the harmonies in that version I simplified even more from how I originally had written the song. I almost wanted him to sing it a cappella. Florence\u2019s version is like I originally wrote it, with more chord changes.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Do you think the lyrics are reflecting anything going on in the show, or is this just the song that happened to come into Podrick\u2019s mind?</b></p><p>Djawadi: That\u2019s open to interpretation, right? Clearly the relationship dilemma with Jon and Daenerys you could relate to Duncan and Jenny. Now that [Jon] knows who he is, and Dany knows who he is, you can draw a comparison to the conflict or the decision to come.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: The other powerful musical moment in that episode came with Brienne\u2019s knighting. What are we hearing in that scene?</b></p><p>Djawadi: That is actually a theme that we had used for Jaime and Brienne before: the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebt6aag3MN4\">Honor\u201d theme</a>. We\u2019ve used it in other moments when somebody does something honorable, [like] when the Hound <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMF72eOuYpU\">buries the bodies</a> in that house [in Season 7, Episode 1]. It\u2019s one of my favorites. It\u2019s such a beautiful and emotional theme we don\u2019t get to use as much.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: So it\u2019s a theme tied not to a character but rather to an abstract concept. What are the show\u2019s other themes like that?</b></p><p>Djawadi: One we had kind of became the Littlefinger theme. We called it the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT44WrZMXaM\">Conspiracy\u201d theme</a>. In the early seasons, there was a lot of backstabbing going on\u2014I guess it\u2019s the opposite of the \u201cHonor\u201d theme.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Jon and Daenerys have their \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78O0L3bhGV4\">Love\u201d theme</a>, which came out in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvtjhvWabc0\">dragon-riding portion</a> of the season premiere.</b></p><p>Djawadi: That was just a fun scene. It\u2019s playful in a way, but also very powerful because he\u2019s learning to ride the dragon. The arrangement was big, with percussion. There\u2019s a hint of danger.</p><p>What was interesting in Episode 1 was that a lot of the themes had callbacks to Season 1. For example, when Bran and Jaime meet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyYeWyM7upI\">at the very end of the episode</a>, that definitely is a callback <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcEqNiODyo\">to the original</a>, from their first interaction. Jon and Dany arriving at the beginning with their army was a callback to the king\u2019s arrival from Season 1. Obviously the footage is very similar\u2014how everybody in Winterfell was lined up\u2014so we drew similarities to the original cue there.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Did you write any other original songs for this last season?</b></p><p>Djawadi: Every season, I\u2019ve developed existing themes, and there\u2019s always been room to write some new material and new themes. We definitely have that as well this season. I can say that much.</p><p><b>Kornhaber: Have any of those new themes shown up in these two episodes?</b></p><p>Djawadi: I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s coming.</p></blockquote></p>",
