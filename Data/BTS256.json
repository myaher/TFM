Friday\u2026 On a Tuesday morning, Friday feels an eternity away. I slip out of bed and change clothes in my room. It looks cold outside so I opt for a beige knit sweater instead of a shirt this time. This morning (well, it\u2019s more brunch time than breakfast time) nobody sits at the dining table. Namjoon is out working the day shift at a local bar today, because even though he has a degree in literature, book deal don\u2019t just come flying through the window\u2014especially not the first one. Taehyung seems to be working as well and Hoseok must be away at the studio. I don\u2019t have enough confidence yet to simply knock next door and see if Jimin, Jeongguk or Yoongi are home and want to go out. It dawns on me that in between all the sightseeing I was subjected to the day prior, we completely forgot to stop by SNU to get my schedule and paperwork finished. Reluctantly, I decide to take matters into my own hands and just do it on my own. I scarf down a bowl of cereal in record time, before grabbing my dark red oversized corduroy jacket and the folder with my application documents. Quickly, I decide that walking is probably my best option, since the college is only a fifteen-minute walk away from Namjoon\u2019s apartment. I take a deep breath of air once I\u2019m on the street, walking. I\u2019ve only been here for a little over two days but I feel quite comfortable here. Even though the city is somewhat crowded, the urban areas like the one around SNU have a nice laid-back vibe to them with all of their green, the quaint streets and the view of Mt. Gwanak most houses in the area have. Lazily, I put my earphones on and stroll around the neighbourhood slowly. I know in which direction I have to go\u2014I remember the way to the underground station at SNU from the day before when Namjoon took me. A few cars roll past me as I go but I barely pay them any mind since I\u2019m still in one of the smaller side streets. After about a good five minutes of walking, I notice a car stopping just a few metres in front of me. I furrow my eyebrows at it. Why would anyone stop their car in the middle of the road? Only when I approach do I see that the window of the small silver Kia Morning is rolled down and Jimin\u2019s face peeks out at me from it. I remove my earphones and smile at him from the sidewalk. \u201cHey,\u201d he greets. \u201cHey, yourself.\u201d \u201cDo you need a ride?\u201d he asks coyly. \u201cWell, when you\u2019re already stopping for me in the middle of the road, I can\u2019t exactly decline, can I?\u201d I laugh and walk over the passenger side of Jimin\u2019s car, getting in in one swift motion. \u201cWhere to, milady?\u201d Jimin asks dramatically. I put on my seatbelt and answer, \u201cIf the kind sir would drive me to Seoul National University, it would be much appreciated.\u201d \u201cSNU it is, then.\u201d The car starts back up smoothly and we\u2019re down the narrow road and on a main road in a flash. \u201cSo whose car is this? Yours? I thought Namjoon said you can\u2019t drive.\u201d \u00a0Jimin scoffs and replies, \u201cYeah, he says that a lot but it\u2019s actually just because I just don\u2019t drive very often. I only ever use the car when I have to go somewhere that I can\u2019t easily reach by train or when there\u2019s no one else to drive.\u201d \u201cHuh. So where exactly do you have to go then?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my brother\u2019s birthday tomorrow, so I\u2019m driving down to Busan. Taking the car\u2019s just a bit cheaper than taking the train, is all,\u201d he explains as he pulls up into the Uni\u2019s car park. \u201cWell, thanks for the ride. Wish your brother a happy birthday from me. See you Friday?\u201d Jimin\u2019s eyes squish together as he smiles with his whole face. Honestly, it is almost unbearably cute. \u201cWill do. See you Friday!\u201d I slam the car door shut behind me, waving to Jimin as he does a U-turn and drives off again. I hug the bright yellow folder with my application papers firmly to my chest as I follow the signposts to the administrative building. Unsurprisingly, I have to wait in line behind a few other people before it\u2019s my turn.</p><p>\u201cGood morning! Uhm, I recently changed my university to this one and I was told to come by the week before orientation and get my application papers verified for my permanent visa? Oh, and also to get my schedule, too?\u201d The woman at the counter smiles at me and asks me to hand me the documents. I give them to her and she skims through them, asking for my ID and passport\u2014both of which I give her. She takes a few looks at both, then slides them back over the counter and presses a black stamp with the school\u2019s logo on it onto the last page of my applications. \u201cOne second, please,\u201d she says, not that I have any choice in the matter anyway. She turns her chair around and rummages through a file cabinet, pulling something out of one file, then turning back around. She slides a credit card-sized student ID followed by my yellow folder over the counter\u2014the ID has my face (forced camera smile and all) on it and beside it my name, birthdate and the words \u2018YEAR 2 BSc Biochemistry\u2019. \u201cAs you can see, this is your student ID. Use it to gain access to the computers in any of the libraries, for public transportation and as general identification. Please don\u2019t lose it. You can go use on of the computers over there to scan your ID and it\u2019ll show you your schedule,\u201d she points to a row of computers perched on waist-high tables attached to the wall. \u201cYou can also choose to see your schedule online anytime you wish if you simply log into your student e-mail with your ID code.\u201d \u201cOkay, cool. Thanks. Have a good day!\u201d The woman nods. \u201cYou too. Next!\u201d</p><p>I scram over to the wall of computers and scan my ID. Immediately, my schedule pops up, the different modules highlighted with different colours. Luckily, none of my classes ever start before 9am\u2014always either at 10am or later. The modules \u2018cell biology\u2019 and \u2018genetics ii\u2019 catch my eye. They\u2019re both on Wednesdays for me. The cell biology lecture being the first one for that day from 11am to 1pm and then genetics ii from 2pm to 4pm\u2014in fact, they\u2019re my only lectures on Wednesdays. I hope Jimin has them at the same time, so there\u2019s at least those two modules in which I know someone. Really, I catch myself looking forward to seeing Jimin again that Friday. I can\u2019t help but fantasise about what it would be like if he were my soulmate. I don\u2019t know him very well yet, but he\u2019s got something that draws me to him like a magnet. I hope it\u2019s the soulmate bond\u2014even though, I know that he\u2019s probably just trying to be a good friend to me. Like I do every so often, I wonder why my soulmate system couldn\u2019t have been something a little more straightforward. Like those people who just have their soulmate\u2019s voice in their head or the ones who have the first sentences they say to each other written on their arms. But no, it had to be some quote of a weird poem.</p><p>Sighing, I check out of the computer again, placing a reminder in my phone to print my schedule out at home later. Funny how I already call the apartment home even though it\u2019s barely been three days. I grab my folder from the table and return outside. The sun is shining now, so it\u2019s somewhat warmer than it was before. On a whim, I decide to walk around campus a bit. It\u2019s mostly empty at this time of year\u2014it\u2019s still the holidays after all. There\u2019s a lot of green areas and trees, the mountain peeking out behind the main building. I stroll around for a while until I start walking in the direction of the apartment again. By foot, the way is much longer than it was when Jimin drove me, even though it\u2019s still only a fifteen-minute walk. This time, no one comes to my rescue, asking me if I need a ride. By the time I get back home, it\u2019s a quarter to one. Still, there\u2019s no one home. Namjoon\u2019s shift at the bar doesn\u2019t end until four and I don\u2019t think Taehyung or Hoseok will be back before then either. I go scavenging the cupboards for food and, to my surprise, there are fresh vegetables in the fridge as well as some miso paste and soba noodles in one of the cupboards. Cooking something probably won\u2019t hurt, I decide and put a pot on the stove. A drama quietly plays in the background on the TV after I turn it on so it won\u2019t be so silent. The vegetables are chopped up pretty quickly and I add them to the water with some salt and miso paste. I let everything simmer for a good twenty minutes, watching the drama intently\u2014it\u2019s another one of the sappy soulmate ones\u2014then add the noodles to the pot. Everyone will have to have some of my improvised quick meal, because I realise I\u2019ve made far too much for one person only. The drama keeps playing in the background as I sit at the table and devour a bowl of my food\u2014it\u2019s pretty decent for something so simple. Suddenly, I hear a key jingling in front of the door and then a click. With a start, the door opens and Hoseok stumbles in. He\u2019s packed with two brown bags, scallions peeking out of one of them. He looks up in shock, crying, \u201cAh! I can\u2019t believe you beat me to it! I was going to cook for everyone!\u201d I laugh out loud and say, \u201cSorry, but I was hungry. You could still cook tomorrow? I could help you too since I\u2019ve ruined your surprise.\u201d \u201cYou better!\u201d he huffs as he sets down the bags on the counter and peeks inside the pot on the stove, sticking a finger inside and tasting the soup. His face lights up. \u201cYou know, this is actually pretty good. Certainly better than anything Namjoon and Tae \u2018cook\u2019.\u201d His hands imitate quotation marks. Again, I laugh at him and get up to help him with the groceries. Four hands obviously work faster than two do and we\u2019ve got everything stored in a matter of minutes. The TV is still playing and Hoseok comments, \u201cYou watch that?\u201d I reply with a shrug, \u201cThere was nothing else on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the studio?\u201d We both sit down in front of the TV, Hoseok balancing a bowl of my gourmet dish on his legs. \u201cSame old, same old. Had to teach a class earlier,\u201d he mumbles in between bites. \u201cIt\u2019s not as fun when Jimin isn\u2019t around to gossip with.\u201d I snort. \u201cHe gave me a lift earlier. He said he was going down to Busan for his brother\u2019s birthday?\u201d Hoseok grunts in agreement. \u201cJihyun-ah turns twenty-one tomorrow. He\u2019s the same age as Jeongguk,\u201d he explains, eyes fixed on the TV. \u201cHuh,\u201d I acknowledge the information, tucking it away for later use. \u201cSo you said Jimin gave you a lift? He wasn\u2019t scared he was going to crash the car with you in it?\u201d he jokes full-mouthed. Cackling, I reply, \u201cIf he was he hid it well.\u201d \u201cI swear that boy must be growing up all of a sudden or something. First England, now voluntary car rides. I can\u2019t believe it! He didn\u2019t speak a word of English when he went and yesterday he gave directions to foreigners in a perfect accent. It\u2019s like they sent a clone back on that plane,\u201d he jokingly complains and I raise my eyebrows at him. If they sent a clone, they sent a pretty cute one, I think. Hoseok returns to concentrating on the drama. It\u2019s about two people bound together by a red string of fate\u2014like the one on the statues, I looked at with Namjoon yesterday. They don\u2019t know it yet, though, because only one of them wants to find their soulmate and so the string is invisible to both of them until they want to find each other. The episode climaxes when the main character admits her desire to find her soulmate and the red string appears tied to her pinkie finger. It\u2019s over after that and the theme song plays over a preview of the next episode. Hoseok sighs, \u201cYou know, these shows are all the same. I wish it were really that easy to find your soulmate.\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d I ask. He shakes his head and places his empty bowl on the coffee table. \u201cNo, uhm, I actually don\u2019t see colour, so I know I haven\u2019t even passed them on the street or anything and I might never, actually. The only times I\u2019ve seen colours were when I visited Daegu with Tae a few years back. There was colour all over the place, but I haven\u2019t seen any since.\u201d I open and close my mouth. Hoseok not seeing colour seems so absurd to me. He has bright red hair, and he can\u2019t even see it properly. \u201cSo you only see colours in places that your soulmate has been?\u201d He nods. \u201cThen how come you haven\u2019t gone back to Daegu since it\u2019s the only place you\u2019ve seen colours at?\u201d He shrugs, explaining, \u201cI guess I\u2019m scared of finding them. You know, like that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the person I\u2019m destined to spend the rest of my life with. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that sort of commitment yet.\u201d I hum, countering, \u201cI totally get that. It\u2019s also one of the reasons why I keep telling myself I\u2019ll never find my soulmate. But then again, I learned Korean for that person and I\u2019m going to study at a university here because of them.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your system?\u201d Hoseok inquires and I pull the sleeve of my pullover up to reveal the line tattooed onto my wrist. He scoots closer to read it, then looks up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as bad as your system, but going half of your life not even knowing what the sentence on your wrist reads is kind of shitty, too.\u201d \u201cYou learned Korean just because of your mark?\u201d he demands, looking at me with big eyes. \u201cMy mum made me.\u201d \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, another set of keys jingles in the lock and Taehyung walks into the flat, followed by a tired-looking Namjoon. \u201cHey guys,\u201d Taehyung chimes happily, setting his bag down on the dining table. Namjoon immediately goes for the kitchen, his face lighting up when he sees that there\u2019s food on the stove. \u201cThere\u2019s food?\u201d Taehyung asks curiously. Namjoon nods, pulling two bowls from the cupboard. \u201cYou\u2019d better appreciate it. I made that,\u201d I command, Taehyung saluting and grabbing one of the bowls Namjoon has filled up. Hoseok and I join them at the dining table. \u201cSo what has everyone been up to today?\u201d I ask, even though I of course already know what Hoseok was up to. Taehyung starts telling us about his day. \u201cMh, well the gallery was pretty quiet today. There were some new deliveries but those aren\u2019t going up until next week, so no news, really.\u201d Namjoon sighs and props his head up on his hands. \u201cWell, the bar was a disaster, as always. I don\u2019t know why I always volunteer to take the day shift. Day drinkers are worse than any drunk college students could ever be,\u201d he complains and the group gives him a bunch of pitiful laughs. \u201cI, for one, had a good day,\u201d I try cheering the others up. \u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Hoseok agrees, \u201cBoring, but boring doesn\u2019t necessarily mean bad.\u201d \u201cI agree. I went by SNU today and got my application all checked out and went to get my schedule,\u201d I announce proudly, earning \u2018Ooh\u2019s from Hoseok and Taehyung. \u201cSo do you share those courses with Jimin? The ones you were talking about yesterday?\u201d Namjoon asks and I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019ll have to ask him on Friday.\u201d \u201cFriday?\u201d Taehyung raises his eyebrows questioningly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m coming along to the studio on Friday. It was Jimin\u2019s idea,\u201d I explain and Taehyung lets out a low whistle. I shake my head at his antics.</p><p>The evening continues in a similar fashion: everyone telling each other about their days and gossiping. The TV remains on in the background and it provides necessary white noise for when there\u2019s a pause in our conversation. Namjoon doesn\u2019t speak a word to me of his plans to come out to his friends on Sunday. Really, I\u2019m not so sure he\u2019s still set in wanting to do it. But I\u2019m meeting Jin on Saturday to plan the whole thing out and there will be no going back from it then. When I go to bed that evening, I receive another text from Jimin.</p><p><b>Park Jimin</b></p><p>I got to Busan safely! (See, my driving can\u2019t be that bad!)</p><p><i>11:08 pm</i></p><p><b>Me</b></p><p>I\u2019m glad you did! Come back safely, too, though! Still looking forward to Friday :)</p><p><i>11:09 pm</i></p><p><b>Park Jimin</b></p><p>Just for you, I\u2019ll drive back safely ;-)</p><p><i>11:10 pm</i></p><p>I don\u2019t know what to respond. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but it sounds like maybe Jimin might be flirting with me just a bit. Then again, I\u2019m probably reading too much into it. No, I definitely am.

Friday\u2026 On a Tuesday morning, Friday feels an eternity away. I slip out of bed and change clothes in my room. It looks cold outside so I opt for a beige knit sweater instead of a shirt this time. This morning (well, it\u2019s more brunch time than breakfast time) nobody sits at the dining table. Namjoon is out working the day shift at a local bar today, because even though he has a degree in literature, book deal don\u2019t just come flying through the window\u2014especially not the first one. Taehyung seems to be working as well and Hoseok must be away at the studio. I don\u2019t have enough confidence yet to simply knock next door and see if Jimin, Jeongguk or Yoongi are home and want to go out. It dawns on me that in between all the sightseeing I was subjected to the day prior, we completely forgot to stop by SNU to get my schedule and paperwork finished. Reluctantly, I decide to take matters into my own hands and just do it on my own. I scarf down a bowl of cereal in record time, before grabbing my dark red oversized corduroy jacket and the folder with my application documents. Quickly, I decide that walking is probably my best option, since the college is only a fifteen-minute walk away from Namjoon\u2019s apartment. I take a deep breath of air once I\u2019m on the street, walking. I\u2019ve only been here for a little over two days but I feel quite comfortable here. Even though the city is somewhat crowded, the urban areas like the one around SNU have a nice laid-back vibe to them with all of their green, the quaint streets and the view of Mt. Gwanak most houses in the area have. Lazily, I put my earphones on and stroll around the neighbourhood slowly. I know in which direction I have to go\u2014I remember the way to the underground station at SNU from the day before when Namjoon took me. A few cars roll past me as I go but I barely pay them any mind since I\u2019m still in one of the smaller side streets. After about a good five minutes of walking, I notice a car stopping just a few metres in front of me. I furrow my eyebrows at it. Why would anyone stop their car in the middle of the road? Only when I approach do I see that the window of the small silver Kia Morning is rolled down and Jimin\u2019s face peeks out at me from it. I remove my earphones and smile at him from the sidewalk. \u201cHey,\u201d he greets. \u201cHey, yourself.\u201d \u201cDo you need a ride?\u201d he asks coyly. \u201cWell, when you\u2019re already stopping for me in the middle of the road, I can\u2019t exactly decline, can I?\u201d I laugh and walk over the passenger side of Jimin\u2019s car, getting in in one swift motion. \u201cWhere to, milady?\u201d Jimin asks dramatically. I put on my seatbelt and answer, \u201cIf the kind sir would drive me to Seoul National University, it would be much appreciated.\u201d \u201cSNU it is, then.\u201d The car starts back up smoothly and we\u2019re down the narrow road and on a main road in a flash. \u201cSo whose car is this? Yours? I thought Namjoon said you can\u2019t drive.\u201d \u00a0Jimin scoffs and replies, \u201cYeah, he says that a lot but it\u2019s actually just because I just don\u2019t drive very often. I only ever use the car when I have to go somewhere that I can\u2019t easily reach by train or when there\u2019s no one else to drive.\u201d \u201cHuh. So where exactly do you have to go then?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my brother\u2019s birthday tomorrow, so I\u2019m driving down to Busan. Taking the car\u2019s just a bit cheaper than taking the train, is all,\u201d he explains as he pulls up into the Uni\u2019s car park. \u201cWell, thanks for the ride. Wish your brother a happy birthday from me. See you Friday?\u201d Jimin\u2019s eyes squish together as he smiles with his whole face. Honestly, it is almost unbearably cute. \u201cWill do. See you Friday!\u201d I slam the car door shut behind me, waving to Jimin as he does a U-turn and drives off again. I hug the bright yellow folder with my application papers firmly to my chest as I follow the signposts to the administrative building. Unsurprisingly, I have to wait in line behind a few other people before it\u2019s my turn.</p><p>\u201cGood morning! Uhm, I recently changed my university to this one and I was told to come by the week before orientation and get my application papers verified for my permanent visa? Oh, and also to get my schedule, too?\u201d The woman at the counter smiles at me and asks me to hand me the documents. I give them to her and she skims through them, asking for my ID and passport\u2014both of which I give her. She takes a few looks at both, then slides them back over the counter and presses a black stamp with the school\u2019s logo on it onto the last page of my applications. \u201cOne second, please,\u201d she says, not that I have any choice in the matter anyway. She turns her chair around and rummages through a file cabinet, pulling something out of one file, then turning back around. She slides a credit card-sized student ID followed by my yellow folder over the counter\u2014the ID has my face (forced camera smile and all) on it and beside it my name, birthdate and the words \u2018YEAR 2 BSc Biochemistry\u2019. \u201cAs you can see, this is your student ID. Use it to gain access to the computers in any of the libraries, for public transportation and as general identification. Please don\u2019t lose it. You can go use on of the computers over there to scan your ID and it\u2019ll show you your schedule,\u201d she points to a row of computers perched on waist-high tables attached to the wall. \u201cYou can also choose to see your schedule online anytime you wish if you simply log into your student e-mail with your ID code.\u201d \u201cOkay, cool. Thanks. Have a good day!\u201d The woman nods. \u201cYou too. Next!\u201d</p><p>I scram over to the wall of computers and scan my ID. Immediately, my schedule pops up, the different modules highlighted with different colours. Luckily, none of my classes ever start before 9am\u2014always either at 10am or later. The modules \u2018cell biology\u2019 and \u2018genetics ii\u2019 catch my eye. They\u2019re both on Wednesdays for me. The cell biology lecture being the first one for that day from 11am to 1pm and then genetics ii from 2pm to 4pm\u2014in fact, they\u2019re my only lectures on Wednesdays. I hope Jimin has them at the same time, so there\u2019s at least those two modules in which I know someone. Really, I catch myself looking forward to seeing Jimin again that Friday. I can\u2019t help but fantasise about what it would be like if he were my soulmate. I don\u2019t know him very well yet, but he\u2019s got something that draws me to him like a magnet. I hope it\u2019s the soulmate bond\u2014even though, I know that he\u2019s probably just trying to be a good friend to me. Like I do every so often, I wonder why my soulmate system couldn\u2019t have been something a little more straightforward. Like those people who just have their soulmate\u2019s voice in their head or the ones who have the first sentences they say to each other written on their arms. But no, it had to be some quote of a weird poem.</p><p>Sighing, I check out of the computer again, placing a reminder in my phone to print my schedule out at home later. Funny how I already call the apartment home even though it\u2019s barely been three days. I grab my folder from the table and return outside. The sun is shining now, so it\u2019s somewhat warmer than it was before. On a whim, I decide to walk around campus a bit. It\u2019s mostly empty at this time of year\u2014it\u2019s still the holidays after all. There\u2019s a lot of green areas and trees, the mountain peeking out behind the main building. I stroll around for a while until I start walking in the direction of the apartment again. By foot, the way is much longer than it was when Jimin drove me, even though it\u2019s still only a fifteen-minute walk. This time, no one comes to my rescue, asking me if I need a ride. By the time I get back home, it\u2019s a quarter to one. Still, there\u2019s no one home. Namjoon\u2019s shift at the bar doesn\u2019t end until four and I don\u2019t think Taehyung or Hoseok will be back before then either. I go scavenging the cupboards for food and, to my surprise, there are fresh vegetables in the fridge as well as some miso paste and soba noodles in one of the cupboards. Cooking something probably won\u2019t hurt, I decide and put a pot on the stove. A drama quietly plays in the background on the TV after I turn it on so it won\u2019t be so silent. The vegetables are chopped up pretty quickly and I add them to the water with some salt and miso paste. I let everything simmer for a good twenty minutes, watching the drama intently\u2014it\u2019s another one of the sappy soulmate ones\u2014then add the noodles to the pot. Everyone will have to have some of my improvised quick meal, because I realise I\u2019ve made far too much for one person only. The drama keeps playing in the background as I sit at the table and devour a bowl of my food\u2014it\u2019s pretty decent for something so simple. Suddenly, I hear a key jingling in front of the door and then a click. With a start, the door opens and Hoseok stumbles in. He\u2019s packed with two brown bags, scallions peeking out of one of them. He looks up in shock, crying, \u201cAh! I can\u2019t believe you beat me to it! I was going to cook for everyone!\u201d I laugh out loud and say, \u201cSorry, but I was hungry. You could still cook tomorrow? I could help you too since I\u2019ve ruined your surprise.\u201d \u201cYou better!\u201d he huffs as he sets down the bags on the counter and peeks inside the pot on the stove, sticking a finger inside and tasting the soup. His face lights up. \u201cYou know, this is actually pretty good. Certainly better than anything Namjoon and Tae \u2018cook\u2019.\u201d His hands imitate quotation marks. Again, I laugh at him and get up to help him with the groceries. Four hands obviously work faster than two do and we\u2019ve got everything stored in a matter of minutes. The TV is still playing and Hoseok comments, \u201cYou watch that?\u201d I reply with a shrug, \u201cThere was nothing else on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the studio?\u201d We both sit down in front of the TV, Hoseok balancing a bowl of my gourmet dish on his legs. \u201cSame old, same old. Had to teach a class earlier,\u201d he mumbles in between bites. \u201cIt\u2019s not as fun when Jimin isn\u2019t around to gossip with.\u201d I snort. \u201cHe gave me a lift earlier. He said he was going down to Busan for his brother\u2019s birthday?\u201d Hoseok grunts in agreement. \u201cJihyun-ah turns twenty-one tomorrow. He\u2019s the same age as Jeongguk,\u201d he explains, eyes fixed on the TV. \u201cHuh,\u201d I acknowledge the information, tucking it away for later use. \u201cSo you said Jimin gave you a lift? He wasn\u2019t scared he was going to crash the car with you in it?\u201d he jokes full-mouthed. Cackling, I reply, \u201cIf he was he hid it well.\u201d \u201cI swear that boy must be growing up all of a sudden or something. First England, now voluntary car rides. I can\u2019t believe it! He didn\u2019t speak a word of English when he went and yesterday he gave directions to foreigners in a perfect accent. It\u2019s like they sent a clone back on that plane,\u201d he jokingly complains and I raise my eyebrows at him. If they sent a clone, they sent a pretty cute one, I think. Hoseok returns to concentrating on the drama. It\u2019s about two people bound together by a red string of fate\u2014like the one on the statues, I looked at with Namjoon yesterday. They don\u2019t know it yet, though, because only one of them wants to find their soulmate and so the string is invisible to both of them until they want to find each other. The episode climaxes when the main character admits her desire to find her soulmate and the red string appears tied to her pinkie finger. It\u2019s over after that and the theme song plays over a preview of the next episode. Hoseok sighs, \u201cYou know, these shows are all the same. I wish it were really that easy to find your soulmate.\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d I ask. He shakes his head and places his empty bowl on the coffee table. \u201cNo, uhm, I actually don\u2019t see colour, so I know I haven\u2019t even passed them on the street or anything and I might never, actually. The only times I\u2019ve seen colours were when I visited Daegu with Tae a few years back. There was colour all over the place, but I haven\u2019t seen any since.\u201d I open and close my mouth. Hoseok not seeing colour seems so absurd to me. He has bright red hair, and he can\u2019t even see it properly. \u201cSo you only see colours in places that your soulmate has been?\u201d He nods. \u201cThen how come you haven\u2019t gone back to Daegu since it\u2019s the only place you\u2019ve seen colours at?\u201d He shrugs, explaining, \u201cI guess I\u2019m scared of finding them. You know, like that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the person I\u2019m destined to spend the rest of my life with. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that sort of commitment yet.\u201d I hum, countering, \u201cI totally get that. It\u2019s also one of the reasons why I keep telling myself I\u2019ll never find my soulmate. But then again, I learned Korean for that person and I\u2019m going to study at a university here because of them.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your system?\u201d Hoseok inquires and I pull the sleeve of my pullover up to reveal the line tattooed onto my wrist. He scoots closer to read it, then looks up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as bad as your system, but going half of your life not even knowing what the sentence on your wrist reads is kind of shitty, too.\u201d \u201cYou learned Korean just because of your mark?\u201d he demands, looking at me with big eyes. \u201cMy mum made me.\u201d \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, another set of keys jingles in the lock and Taehyung walks into the flat, followed by a tired-looking Namjoon. \u201cHey guys,\u201d Taehyung chimes happily, setting his bag down on the dining table. Namjoon immediately goes for the kitchen, his face lighting up when he sees that there\u2019s food on the stove. \u201cThere\u2019s food?\u201d Taehyung asks curiously. Namjoon nods, pulling two bowls from the cupboard. \u201cYou\u2019d better appreciate it. I made that,\u201d I command, Taehyung saluting and grabbing one of the bowls Namjoon has filled up. Hoseok and I join them at the dining table. \u201cSo what has everyone been up to today?\u201d I ask, even though I of course already know what Hoseok was up to. Taehyung starts telling us about his day. \u201cMh, well the gallery was pretty quiet today. There were some new deliveries but those aren\u2019t going up until next week, so no news, really.\u201d Namjoon sighs and props his head up on his hands. \u201cWell, the bar was a disaster, as always. I don\u2019t know why I always volunteer to take the day shift. Day drinkers are worse than any drunk college students could ever be,\u201d he complains and the group gives him a bunch of pitiful laughs. \u201cI, for one, had a good day,\u201d I try cheering the others up. \u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Hoseok agrees, \u201cBoring, but boring doesn\u2019t necessarily mean bad.\u201d \u201cI agree. I went by SNU today and got my application all checked out and went to get my schedule,\u201d I announce proudly, earning \u2018Ooh\u2019s from Hoseok and Taehyung. \u201cSo do you share those courses with Jimin? The ones you were talking about yesterday?\u201d Namjoon asks and I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019ll have to ask him on Friday.\u201d \u201cFriday?\u201d Taehyung raises his eyebrows questioningly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m coming along to the studio on Friday. It was Jimin\u2019s idea,\u201d I explain and Taehyung lets out a low whistle. I shake my head at his antics.</p><p>The evening continues in a similar fashion: everyone telling each other about their days and gossiping. The TV remains on in the background and it provides necessary white noise for when there\u2019s a pause in our conversation. Namjoon doesn\u2019t speak a word to me of his plans to come out to his friends on Sunday. Really, I\u2019m not so sure he\u2019s still set in wanting to do it. But I\u2019m meeting Jin on Saturday to plan the whole thing out and there will be no going back from it then. When I go to bed that evening, I receive another text from Jimin.</p><p><b>Park Jimin</b></p><p>I got to Busan safely! (See, my driving can\u2019t be that bad!)</p><p><i>11:08 pm</i></p><p><b>Me</b></p><p>I\u2019m glad you did! Come back safely, too, though! Still looking forward to Friday :)</p><p><i>11:09 pm</i></p><p><b>Park Jimin</b></p><p>Just for you, I\u2019ll drive back safely ;-)</p><p><i>11:10 pm</i></p><p>I don\u2019t know what to respond. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but it sounds like maybe Jimin might be flirting with me just a bit. Then again, I\u2019m probably reading too much into it. No, I definitely am. Somehow, I hope I am (because if he\u2019s not my soulmate, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do).</p></p>",

Friday\u2026 On a Tuesday morning, Friday feels an eternity away. I slip out of bed and change clothes in my room. It looks cold outside so I opt for a beige knit sweater instead of a shirt this time. This morning (well, it\u2019s more brunch time than breakfast time) nobody sits at the dining table. Namjoon is out working the day shift at a local bar today, because even though he has a degree in literature, book deal don\u2019t just come flying through the window\u2014especially not the first one. Taehyung seems to be working as well and Hoseok must be away at the studio. I don\u2019t have enough confidence yet to simply knock next door and see if Jimin, Jeongguk or Yoongi are home and want to go out. It dawns on me that in between all the sightseeing I was subjected to the day prior, we completely forgot to stop by SNU to get my schedule and paperwork finished. Reluctantly, I decide to take matters into my own hands and just do it on my own. I scarf down a bowl of cereal in record time, before grabbing my dark red oversized corduroy jacket and the folder with my application documents. Quickly, I decide that walking is probably my best option, since the college is only a fifteen-minute walk away from Namjoon\u2019s apartment. I take a deep breath of air once I\u2019m on the street, walking. I\u2019ve only been here for a little over two days but I feel quite comfortable here. Even though the city is somewhat crowded, the urban areas like the one around SNU have a nice laid-back vibe to them with all of their green, the quaint streets and the view of Mt. Gwanak most houses in the area have. Lazily, I put my earphones on and stroll around the neighbourhood slowly. I know in which direction I have to go\u2014I remember the way to the underground station at SNU from the day before when Namjoon took me. A few cars roll past me as I go but I barely pay them any mind since I\u2019m still in one of the smaller side streets. After about a good five minutes of walking, I notice a car stopping just a few metres in front of me. I furrow my eyebrows at it. Why would anyone stop their car in the middle of the road? Only when I approach do I see that the window of the small silver Kia Morning is rolled down and Jimin\u2019s face peeks out at me from it. I remove my earphones and smile at him from the sidewalk. \u201cHey,\u201d he greets. \u201cHey, yourself.\u201d \u201cDo you need a ride?\u201d he asks coyly. \u201cWell, when you\u2019re already stopping for me in the middle of the road, I can\u2019t exactly decline, can I?\u201d I laugh and walk over the passenger side of Jimin\u2019s car, getting in in one swift motion. \u201cWhere to, milady?\u201d Jimin asks dramatically. I put on my seatbelt and answer, \u201cIf the kind sir would drive me to Seoul National University, it would be much appreciated.\u201d \u201cSNU it is, then.\u201d The car starts back up smoothly and we\u2019re down the narrow road and on a main road in a flash. \u201cSo whose car is this? Yours? I thought Namjoon said you can\u2019t drive.\u201d \u00a0Jimin scoffs and replies, \u201cYeah, he says that a lot but it\u2019s actually just because I just don\u2019t drive very often. I only ever use the car when I have to go somewhere that I can\u2019t easily reach by train or when there\u2019s no one else to drive.\u201d \u201cHuh. So where exactly do you have to go then?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my brother\u2019s birthday tomorrow, so I\u2019m driving down to Busan. Taking the car\u2019s just a bit cheaper than taking the train, is all,\u201d he explains as he pulls up into the Uni\u2019s car park. \u201cWell, thanks for the ride. Wish your brother a happy birthday from me. See you Friday?\u201d Jimin\u2019s eyes squish together as he smiles with his whole face. Honestly, it is almost unbearably cute. \u201cWill do. See you Friday!\u201d I slam the car door shut behind me, waving to Jimin as he does a U-turn and drives off again. I hug the bright yellow folder with my application papers firmly to my chest as I follow the signposts to the administrative building. Unsurprisingly, I have to wait in line behind a few other people before it\u2019s my turn.</p><p>\u201cGood morning! Uhm, I recently changed my university to this one and I was told to come by the week before orientation and get my application papers verified for my permanent visa? Oh, and also to get my schedule, too?\u201d The woman at the counter smiles at me and asks me to hand me the documents. I give them to her and she skims through them, asking for my ID and passport\u2014both of which I give her. She takes a few looks at both, then slides them back over the counter and presses a black stamp with the school\u2019s logo on it onto the last page of my applications. \u201cOne second, please,\u201d she says, not that I have any choice in the matter anyway. She turns her chair around and rummages through a file cabinet, pulling something out of one file, then turning back around. She slides a credit card-sized student ID followed by my yellow folder over the counter\u2014the ID has my face (forced camera smile and all) on it and beside it my name, birthdate and the words \u2018YEAR 2 BSc Biochemistry\u2019. \u201cAs you can see, this is your student ID. Use it to gain access to the computers in any of the libraries, for public transportation and as general identification. Please don\u2019t lose it. You can go use on of the computers over there to scan your ID and it\u2019ll show you your schedule,\u201d she points to a row of computers perched on waist-high tables attached to the wall. \u201cYou can also choose to see your schedule online anytime you wish if you simply log into your student e-mail with your ID code.\u201d \u201cOkay, cool. Thanks. Have a good day!\u201d The woman nods. \u201cYou too. Next!\u201d</p><p>I scram over to the wall of computers and scan my ID. Immediately, my schedule pops up, the different modules highlighted with different colours. Luckily, none of my classes ever start before 9am\u2014always either at 10am or later. The modules \u2018cell biology\u2019 and \u2018genetics ii\u2019 catch my eye. They\u2019re both on Wednesdays for me. The cell biology lecture being the first one for that day from 11am to 1pm and then genetics ii from 2pm to 4pm\u2014in fact, they\u2019re my only lectures on Wednesdays. I hope Jimin has them at the same time, so there\u2019s at least those two modules in which I know someone. Really, I catch myself looking forward to seeing Jimin again that Friday. I can\u2019t help but fantasise about what it would be like if he were my soulmate. I don\u2019t know him very well yet, but he\u2019s got something that draws me to him like a magnet. I hope it\u2019s the soulmate bond\u2014even though, I know that he\u2019s probably just trying to be a good friend to me. Like I do every so often, I wonder why my soulmate system couldn\u2019t have been something a little more straightforward. Like those people who just have their soulmate\u2019s voice in their head or the ones who have the first sentences they say to each other written on their arms. But no, it had to be some quote of a weird poem.</p><p>Sighing, I check out of the computer again, placing a reminder in my phone to print my schedule out at home later. Funny how I already call the apartment home even though it\u2019s barely been three days. I grab my folder from the table and return outside. The sun is shining now, so it\u2019s somewhat warmer than it was before. On a whim, I decide to walk around campus a bit. It\u2019s mostly empty at this time of year\u2014it\u2019s still the holidays after all. There\u2019s a lot of green areas and trees, the mountain peeking out behind the main building. I stroll around for a while until I start walking in the direction of the apartment again. By foot, the way is much longer than it was when Jimin drove me, even though it\u2019s still only a fifteen-minute walk. This time, no one comes to my rescue, asking me if I need a ride. By the time I get back home, it\u2019s a quarter to one. Still, there\u2019s no one home. Namjoon\u2019s shift at the bar doesn\u2019t end until four and I don\u2019t think Taehyung or Hoseok will be back before then either. I go scavenging the cupboards for food and, to my surprise, there are fresh vegetables in the fridge as well as some miso paste and soba noodles in one of the cupboards. Cooking something probably won\u2019t hurt, I decide and put a pot on the stove. A drama quietly plays in the background on the TV after I turn it on so it won\u2019t be so silent. The vegetables are chopped up pretty quickly and I add them to the water with some salt and miso paste. I let everything simmer for a good twenty minutes, watching the drama intently\u2014it\u2019s another one of the sappy soulmate ones\u2014then add the noodles to the pot. Everyone will have to have some of my improvised quick meal, because I realise I\u2019ve made far too much for one person only. The drama keeps playing in the background as I sit at the table and devour a bowl of my food\u2014it\u2019s pretty decent for something so simple. Suddenly, I hear a key jingling in front of the door and then a click. With a start, the door opens and Hoseok stumbles in. He\u2019s packed with two brown bags, scallions peeking out of one of them. He looks up in shock, crying, \u201cAh! I can\u2019t believe you beat me to it! I was going to cook for everyone!\u201d I laugh out loud and say, \u201cSorry, but I was hungry. You could still cook tomorrow? I could help you too since I\u2019ve ruined your surprise.\u201d \u201cYou better!\u201d he huffs as he sets down the bags on the counter and peeks inside the pot on the stove, sticking a finger inside and tasting the soup. His face lights up. \u201cYou know, this is actually pretty good. Certainly better than anything Namjoon and Tae \u2018cook\u2019.\u201d His hands imitate quotation marks. Again, I laugh at him and get up to help him with the groceries. Four hands obviously work faster than two do and we\u2019ve got everything stored in a matter of minutes. The TV is still playing and Hoseok comments, \u201cYou watch that?\u201d I reply with a shrug, \u201cThere was nothing else on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the studio?\u201d We both sit down in front of the TV, Hoseok balancing a bowl of my gourmet dish on his legs. \u201cSame old, same old. Had to teach a class earlier,\u201d he mumbles in between bites. \u201cIt\u2019s not as fun when Jimin isn\u2019t around to gossip with.\u201d I snort. \u201cHe gave me a lift earlier. He said he was going down to Busan for his brother\u2019s birthday?\u201d Hoseok grunts in agreement. \u201cJihyun-ah turns twenty-one tomorrow. He\u2019s the same age as Jeongguk,\u201d he explains, eyes fixed on the TV. \u201cHuh,\u201d I acknowledge the information, tucking it away for later use. \u201cSo you said Jimin gave you a lift? He wasn\u2019t scared he was going to crash the car with you in it?\u201d he jokes full-mouthed. Cackling, I reply, \u201cIf he was he hid it well.\u201d \u201cI swear that boy must be growing up all of a sudden or something. First England, now voluntary car rides. I can\u2019t believe it! He didn\u2019t speak a word of English when he went and yesterday he gave directions to foreigners in a perfect accent. It\u2019s like they sent a clone back on that plane,\u201d he jokingly complains and I raise my eyebrows at him. If they sent a clone, they sent a pretty cute one, I think. Hoseok returns to concentrating on the drama. It\u2019s about two people bound together by a red string of fate\u2014like the one on the statues, I looked at with Namjoon yesterday. They don\u2019t know it yet, though, because only one of them wants to find their soulmate and so the string is invisible to both of them until they want to find each other. The episode climaxes when the main character admits her desire to find her soulmate and the red string appears tied to her pinkie finger. It\u2019s over after that and the theme song plays over a preview of the next episode. Hoseok sighs, \u201cYou know, these shows are all the same. I wish it were really that easy to find your soulmate.\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d I ask. He shakes his head and places his empty bowl on the coffee table. \u201cNo, uhm, I actually don\u2019t see colour, so I know I haven\u2019t even passed them on the street or anything and I might never, actually. The only times I\u2019ve seen colours were when I visited Daegu with Tae a few years back. There was colour all over the place, but I haven\u2019t seen any since.\u201d I open and close my mouth. Hoseok not seeing colour seems so absurd to me. He has bright red hair, and he can\u2019t even see it properly. \u201cSo you only see colours in places that your soulmate has been?\u201d He nods. \u201cThen how come you haven\u2019t gone back to Daegu since it\u2019s the only place you\u2019ve seen colours at?\u201d He shrugs, explaining, \u201cI guess I\u2019m scared of finding them. You know, like that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the person I\u2019m destined to spend the rest of my life with. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that sort of commitment yet.\u201d I hum, countering, \u201cI totally get that. It\u2019s also one of the reasons why I keep telling myself I\u2019ll never find my soulmate. But then again, I learned Korean for that person and I\u2019m going to study at a university here because of them.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your system?\u201d Hoseok inquires and I pull the sleeve of my pullover up to reveal the line tattooed onto my wrist. He scoots closer to read it, then looks up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as bad as your system, but going half of your life not even knowing what the sentence on your wrist reads is kind of shitty, too.\u201d \u201cYou learned Korean just because of your mark?\u201d he demands, looking at me with big eyes. \u201cMy mum made me.\u201d \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, another set of keys jingles in the lock and Taehyung walks into the flat, followed by a tired-looking Namjoon. \u201cHey guys,\u201d Taehyung chimes happily, setting his bag down on the dining table. Namjoon immediately goes for the kitchen, his face lighting up when he sees that there\u2019s food on the stove. \u201cThere\u2019s food?\u201d Taehyung asks curiously. Namjoon nods, pulling two bowls from the cupboard. \u201cYou\u2019d better appreciate it. I made that,\u201d I command, Taehyung saluting and grabbing one of the bowls Namjoon has filled up. Hoseok and I join them at the dining table. \u201cSo what has everyone been up to today?\u201d I ask, even though I of course already know what Hoseok was up to. Taehyung starts telling us about his day. \u201cMh, well the gallery was pretty quiet today. There were some new deliveries but those aren\u2019t going up until next week, so no news, really.\u201d Namjoon sighs and props his head up on his hands. \u201cWell, the bar was a disaster, as always. I don\u2019t know why I always volunteer to take the day shift. Day drinkers are worse than any drunk college students could ever be,\u201d he complains and the group gives him a bunch of pitiful laughs. \u201cI, for one, had a good day,\u201d I try cheering the others up. \u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Hoseok agrees, \u201cBoring, but boring doesn\u2019t necessarily mean bad.\u201d \u201cI agree. I went by SNU today and got my application all checked out and went to get my schedule,\u201d I announce proudly, earning \u2018Ooh\u2019s from Hoseok and Taehyung. \u201cSo do you share those courses with Jimin? The ones you were talking about yesterday?\u201d Namjoon asks and I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019ll have to ask him on Friday.\u201d \u201cFriday?\u201d Taehyung raises his eyebrows questioningly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m coming along to the studio on Friday. It was Jimin\u2019s idea,\u201d I explain and Taehyung lets out a low whistle. I shake my head at his antics.</p><p>The evening continues in a similar fashion: everyone telling each other about their days and gossiping. The TV remains on in the background and it provides necessary white noise for when there\u2019s a pause in our conversation. Namjoon doesn\u2019t speak a word to me of his plans to come out to his friends on Sunday. Really, I\u2019m not so sure he\u2019s still set in wanting to do it. But I\u2019m meeting Jin on Saturday to plan the whole thing out and there will be no going back from it then. When I go to bed that evening, I receive another text from Jimin.</p><p><b>Park Jimin</b></p><p>I got to Busan safely!

Somehow, I hope I am (because if he\u2019s not my soulmate, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do).</p></p>",

Friday&hellip; On a Tuesday morning, Friday feels an eternity away. I slip out of bed and change clothes in my room. It looks cold outside so I opt for a beige knit sweater instead of a shirt this time. This morning (well, it&rsquo;s more brunch time than breakfast time) nobody sits at the dining table. Namjoon is out working the day shift at a local bar today, because even though he has a degree in literature, book deal don&rsquo;t just come flying through the window&mdash;especially not the first one. Taehyung seems to be working as well and Hoseok must be away at the studio. I don&rsquo;t have enough confidence yet to simply knock next door and see if Jimin, Jeongguk or Yoongi are home and want to go out. It dawns on me that in between all the sightseeing I was subjected to the day prior, we completely forgot to stop by SNU to get my schedule and paperwork finished. Reluctantly, I decide to take matters into my own hands and just do it on my own. I scarf down a bowl of cereal in record time, before grabbing my dark red oversized corduroy jacket and the folder with my application documents. Quickly, I decide that walking is probably my best option, since the college is only a fifteen-minute walk away from Namjoon&rsquo;s apartment. I take a deep breath of air once I&rsquo;m on the street, walking. I&rsquo;ve only been here for a little over two days but I feel quite comfortable here. Even though the city is somewhat crowded, the urban areas like the one around SNU have a nice laid-back vibe to them with all of their green, the quaint streets and the view of Mt. Gwanak most houses in the area have. Lazily, I put my earphones on and stroll around the neighbourhood slowly. I know in which direction I have to go&mdash;I remember the way to the underground station at SNU from the day before when Namjoon took me. A few cars roll past me as I go but I barely pay them any mind since I&rsquo;m still in one of the smaller side streets. After about a good five minutes of walking, I notice a car stopping just a few metres in front of me. I furrow my eyebrows at it. Why would anyone stop their car in the middle of the road? Only when I approach do I see that the window of the small silver Kia Morning is rolled down and Jimin&rsquo;s face peeks out at me from it. I remove my earphones and smile at him from the sidewalk. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he greets. &ldquo;Hey, yourself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you need a ride?&rdquo; he asks coyly. &ldquo;Well, when you&rsquo;re already stopping for me in the middle of the road, I can&rsquo;t exactly decline, can I?&rdquo; I laugh and walk over the passenger side of Jimin&rsquo;s car, getting in in one swift motion. &ldquo;Where to, milady?&rdquo; Jimin asks dramatically. I put on my seatbelt and answer, &ldquo;If the kind sir would drive me to Seoul National University, it would be much appreciated.&rdquo; &ldquo;SNU it is, then.&rdquo; The car starts back up smoothly and we&rsquo;re down the narrow road and on a main road in a flash. &ldquo;So whose car is this? Yours? I thought Namjoon said you can&rsquo;t drive.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jimin scoffs and replies, &ldquo;Yeah, he says that a lot but it&rsquo;s actually just because I just don&rsquo;t drive very often. I only ever use the car when I have to go somewhere that I can&rsquo;t easily reach by train or when there&rsquo;s no one else to drive.&rdquo; &ldquo;Huh. So where exactly do you have to go then?&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s birthday tomorrow, so I&rsquo;m driving down to Busan. Taking the car&rsquo;s just a bit cheaper than taking the train, is all,&rdquo; he explains as he pulls up into the Uni&rsquo;s car park. &ldquo;Well, thanks for the ride. Wish your brother a happy birthday from me. See you Friday?&rdquo; Jimin&rsquo;s eyes squish together as he smiles with his whole face. Honestly, it is almost unbearably cute. &ldquo;Will do. See you Friday!&rdquo; I slam the car door shut behind me, waving to Jimin as he does a U-turn and drives off again. I hug the bright yellow folder with my application papers firmly to my chest as I follow the signposts to the administrative building. Unsurprisingly, I have to wait in line behind a few other people before it&rsquo;s my turn.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning! Uhm, I recently changed my university to this one and I was told to come by the week before orientation and get my application papers verified for my permanent visa? Oh, and also to get my schedule, too?&rdquo; The woman at the counter smiles at me and asks me to hand me the documents. I give them to her and she skims through them, asking for my ID and passport&mdash;both of which I give her. She takes a few looks at both, then slides them back over the counter and presses a black stamp with the school&rsquo;s logo on it onto the last page of my applications. &ldquo;One second, please,&rdquo; she says, not that I have any choice in the matter anyway. She turns her chair around and rummages through a file cabinet, pulling something out of one file, then turning back around. She slides a credit card-sized student ID followed by my yellow folder over the counter&mdash;the ID has my face (forced camera smile and all) on it and beside it my name, birthdate and the words &lsquo;YEAR 2 BSc Biochemistry&rsquo;. &ldquo;As you can see, this is your student ID. Use it to gain access to the computers in any of the libraries, for public transportation and as general identification. Please don&rsquo;t lose it. You can go use on of the computers over there to scan your ID and it&rsquo;ll show you your schedule,&rdquo; she points to a row of computers perched on waist-high tables attached to the wall. &ldquo;You can also choose to see your schedule online anytime you wish if you simply log into your student e-mail with your ID code.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay, cool. Thanks. Have a good day!&rdquo; The woman nods. &ldquo;You too. Next!&rdquo;</p><p>I scram over to the wall of computers and scan my ID. Immediately, my schedule pops up, the different modules highlighted with different colours. Luckily, none of my classes ever start before 9am&mdash;always either at 10am or later. The modules &lsquo;cell biology&rsquo; and &lsquo;genetics ii&rsquo; catch my eye. They&rsquo;re both on Wednesdays for me. The cell biology lecture being the first one for that day from 11am to 1pm and then genetics ii from 2pm to 4pm&mdash;in fact, they&rsquo;re my only lectures on Wednesdays. I hope Jimin has them at the same time, so there&rsquo;s at least those two modules in which I know someone. Really, I catch myself looking forward to seeing Jimin again that Friday. I can&rsquo;t help but fantasise about what it would be like if he were my soulmate. I don&rsquo;t know him very well yet, but he&rsquo;s got something that draws me to him like a magnet. I hope it&rsquo;s the soulmate bond&mdash;even though, I know that he&rsquo;s probably just trying to be a good friend to me. Like I do every so often, I wonder why my soulmate system couldn&rsquo;t have been something a little more straightforward. Like those people who just have their soulmate&rsquo;s voice in their head or the ones who have the first sentences they say to each other written on their arms. But no, it had to be some quote of a weird poem.</p><p>Sighing, I check out of the computer again, placing a reminder in my phone to print my schedule out at home later. Funny how I already call the apartment home even though it&rsquo;s barely been three days. I grab my folder from the table and return outside. The sun is shining now, so it&rsquo;s somewhat warmer than it was before. On a whim, I decide to walk around campus a bit. It&rsquo;s mostly empty at this time of year&mdash;it&rsquo;s still the holidays after all. There&rsquo;s a lot of green areas and trees, the mountain peeking out behind the main building. I stroll around for a while until I start walking in the direction of the apartment again. By foot, the way is much longer than it was when Jimin drove me, even though it&rsquo;s still only a fifteen-minute walk. This time, no one comes to my rescue, asking me if I need a ride. By the time I get back home, it&rsquo;s a quarter to one. Still, there&rsquo;s no one home. Namjoon&rsquo;s shift at the bar doesn&rsquo;t end until four and I don&rsquo;t think Taehyung or Hoseok will be back before then either. I go scavenging the cupboards for food and, to my surprise, there are fresh vegetables in the fridge as well as some miso paste and soba noodles in one of the cupboards. Cooking something probably won&rsquo;t hurt, I decide and put a pot on the stove. A drama quietly plays in the background on the TV after I turn it on so it won&rsquo;t be so silent. The vegetables are chopped up pretty quickly and I add them to the water with some salt and miso paste. I let everything simmer for a good twenty minutes, watching the drama intently&mdash;it&rsquo;s another one of the sappy soulmate ones&mdash;then add the noodles to the pot. Everyone will have to have some of my improvised quick meal, because I realise I&rsquo;ve made far too much for one person only. The drama keeps playing in the background as I sit at the table and devour a bowl of my food&mdash;it&rsquo;s pretty decent for something so simple. Suddenly, I hear a key jingling in front of the door and then a click. With a start, the door opens and Hoseok stumbles in. He&rsquo;s packed with two brown bags, scallions peeking out of one of them. He looks up in shock, crying, &ldquo;Ah! I can&rsquo;t believe you beat me to it! I was going to cook for everyone!&rdquo; I laugh out loud and say, &ldquo;Sorry, but I was hungry. You could still cook tomorrow? I could help you too since I&rsquo;ve ruined your surprise.&rdquo; &ldquo;You better!&rdquo; he huffs as he sets down the bags on the counter and peeks inside the pot on the stove, sticking a finger inside and tasting the soup. His face lights up. &ldquo;You know, this is actually pretty good. Certainly better than anything Namjoon and Tae &lsquo;cook&rsquo;.&rdquo; His hands imitate quotation marks. Again, I laugh at him and get up to help him with the groceries. Four hands obviously work faster than two do and we&rsquo;ve got everything stored in a matter of minutes. The TV is still playing and Hoseok comments, &ldquo;You watch that?&rdquo; I reply with a shrug, &ldquo;There was nothing else on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How was the studio?&rdquo; We both sit down in front of the TV, Hoseok balancing a bowl of my gourmet dish on his legs. &ldquo;Same old, same old. Had to teach a class earlier,&rdquo; he mumbles in between bites. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as fun when Jimin isn&rsquo;t around to gossip with.&rdquo; I snort. &ldquo;He gave me a lift earlier. He said he was going down to Busan for his brother&rsquo;s birthday?&rdquo; Hoseok grunts in agreement. &ldquo;Jihyun-ah turns twenty-one tomorrow. He&rsquo;s the same age as Jeongguk,&rdquo; he explains, eyes fixed on the TV. &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; I acknowledge the information, tucking it away for later use. &ldquo;So you said Jimin gave you a lift? He wasn&rsquo;t scared he was going to crash the car with you in it?&rdquo; he jokes full-mouthed. Cackling, I reply, &ldquo;If he was he hid it well.&rdquo; &ldquo;I swear that boy must be growing up all of a sudden or something. First England, now voluntary car rides. I can&rsquo;t believe it! He didn&rsquo;t speak a word of English when he went and yesterday he gave directions to foreigners in a perfect accent. It&rsquo;s like they sent a clone back on that plane,&rdquo; he jokingly complains and I raise my eyebrows at him. If they sent a clone, they sent a pretty cute one, I think. Hoseok returns to concentrating on the drama. It&rsquo;s about two people bound together by a red string of fate&mdash;like the one on the statues, I looked at with Namjoon yesterday. They don&rsquo;t know it yet, though, because only one of them wants to find their soulmate and so the string is invisible to both of them until they want to find each other. The episode climaxes when the main character admits her desire to find her soulmate and the red string appears tied to her pinkie finger. It&rsquo;s over after that and the theme song plays over a preview of the next episode. Hoseok sighs, &ldquo;You know, these shows are all the same. I wish it were really that easy to find your soulmate.&rdquo; &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; I ask. He shakes his head and places his empty bowl on the coffee table. &ldquo;No, uhm, I actually don&rsquo;t see colour, so I know I haven&rsquo;t even passed them on the street or anything and I might never, actually. The only times I&rsquo;ve seen colours were when I visited Daegu with Tae a few years back. There was colour all over the place, but I haven&rsquo;t seen any since.&rdquo; I open and close my mouth. Hoseok not seeing colour seems so absurd to me. He has bright red hair, and he can&rsquo;t even see it properly. &ldquo;So you only see colours in places that your soulmate has been?&rdquo; He nods. &ldquo;Then how come you haven&rsquo;t gone back to Daegu since it&rsquo;s the only place you&rsquo;ve seen colours at?&rdquo; He shrugs, explaining, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m scared of finding them. You know, like that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the person I&rsquo;m destined to spend the rest of my life with. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m ready for that sort of commitment yet.&rdquo; I hum, countering, &ldquo;I totally get that. It&rsquo;s also one of the reasons why I keep telling myself I&rsquo;ll never find my soulmate. But then again, I learned Korean for that person and I&rsquo;m going to study at a university here because of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your system?&rdquo; Hoseok inquires and I pull the sleeve of my pullover up to reveal the line tattooed onto my wrist. He scoots closer to read it, then looks up at me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nearly as bad as your system, but going half of your life not even knowing what the sentence on your wrist reads is kind of shitty, too.&rdquo; &ldquo;You learned Korean just because of your mark?&rdquo; he demands, looking at me with big eyes. &ldquo;My mum made me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damn.&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly, another set of keys jingles in the lock and Taehyung walks into the flat, followed by a tired-looking Namjoon. &ldquo;Hey guys,&rdquo; Taehyung chimes happily, setting his bag down on the dining table. Namjoon immediately goes for the kitchen, his face lighting up when he sees that there&rsquo;s food on the stove. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s food?&rdquo; Taehyung asks curiously. Namjoon nods, pulling two bowls from the cupboard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better appreciate it. I made that,&rdquo; I command, Taehyung saluting and grabbing one of the bowls Namjoon has filled up. Hoseok and I join them at the dining table. &ldquo;So what has everyone been up to today?&rdquo; I ask, even though I of course already know what Hoseok was up to. Taehyung starts telling us about his day. &ldquo;Mh, well the gallery was pretty quiet today. There were some new deliveries but those aren&rsquo;t going up until next week, so no news, really.&rdquo; Namjoon sighs and props his head up on his hands. &ldquo;Well, the bar was a disaster, as always. I don&rsquo;t know why I always volunteer to take the day shift. Day drinkers are worse than any drunk college students could ever be,&rdquo; he complains and the group gives him a bunch of pitiful laughs. &ldquo;I, for one, had a good day,&rdquo; I try cheering the others up. &ldquo;Yeah, me too,&rdquo; Hoseok agrees, &ldquo;Boring, but boring doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean bad.&rdquo; &ldquo;I agree. I went by SNU today and got my application all checked out and went to get my schedule,&rdquo; I announce proudly, earning &lsquo;Ooh&rsquo;s from Hoseok and Taehyung. &ldquo;So do you share those courses with Jimin? The ones you were talking about yesterday?&rdquo; Namjoon asks and I shrug. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. I&rsquo;ll have to ask him on Friday.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friday?&rdquo; Taehyung raises his eyebrows questioningly. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m coming along to the studio on Friday. It was Jimin&rsquo;s idea,&rdquo; I explain and Taehyung lets out a low whistle. I shake my head at his antics.</p><p>The evening continues in a similar fashion: everyone telling each other about their days and gossiping.
