        "body": "<p>Hi Princeharryandme. It would be better if I submit this regarding the Winter Is Coming ask earlier. Bear with me for the <b>long post.</b> Haha!</p>\n\n<p>1. Like what the majority of the viewers have said about the darkness of the whole episode, I understand the concept of darkness as the whole battle was against the Night King, White Walkers, wights and the Undead Army.</p>\n\n<p>However, they could have considered to adjust the darkness since TV viewers are not watching the episodes in \u201ccinemas or theaters\u201d. All have different sizes of their television plus the settings but it could have been appreciated if they did so post-production.</p>\n\n<p><i>The Long Night</i> is one of the stories people in the North have shared for generations. One can understand it deeply if you read the books for full details of the storylines because one will appreciate it all the more as compared to being a TV viewer only. The TV series has streamlined the storylines for brevity and practicality purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Most people have observed that after Seasons 1-4, the writing of the show suffered a bit. <i>It is due to the fact that there are no books anymore for the show creators and writers to follow as a guide for the storyline and dialogues.</i></p>\n\n<p><i>Seasons 1-4 were flawless because the dialogues of the characters came out straight from the books.</i> It\u2019s funny, substantial, logical and amusing if you have read all of them.</p>\n\n<p>Remember the moving scene between Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister in Season 1 where they had a conversation about Lyanna Stark and their marriage inside the room? I love that scene in Book 1 and the two actors (Mark Addy and Lena Headey) delivered it so well in the TV series.</p>\n\n<p>Moreoever, notice the inconsistencies of the characters and plot in Seasons 5-7. Except for the penultimate episodes of each season (Episode 9 per season), I have no question for the battle scenes. I appreciate the hard work, quality and fight scenes that the characters and crew have done.</p>\n\n<p><i>Season 5, Episode 9:\u00a0 Battle at Hardhome</i></p>\n<p><i>Season 6, Episode 9:\u00a0 Battle of the Bastards</i></p>\n<p><i>Season 7, Episode 6: Beyond the Wall</i></p>\n\n<p>2. House Stark\u2019s motto is Winter is Coming. Houses in the North know of the grave danger about the White Walkers generations ago. The Long Night of yore caused massive death because no one can ever survive the coldest winters for several years. Even Old Nan (old woman taking care of Bran after his accident) never failed to repeat the stories to the Stark children.</p>\n\n<p>Here comes the story of <i>Azor Ahai</i>, a legendary figure who forged the sword called <i>Lightbringer</i> used to defeat the darkness of the Great Other. In the show, the \u201cGreat Other\u201d is referred to as the Night King, White Walkers, wights and the undead army in general.</p>\n\n<p><b> A prophecy predicts that Azor Ahai shall be reborn as The Prince that was Promised.</b></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the hype on the White Walkers since Season 1 mainly focused on this great threat of long winter nights, the undead and on whether the prophecy of Azor Ahai will come into fruition.</p>\n\n<p>3. Fast forward to the final season where both book readers and tv viewers have been anticipating for the longest time ever only to be disappointed on the so-called Long Night. <b>It takes ONE EPISODE to end the Night King vis-a-vis the hype since Season 1.</b></p>\n\n<p>Just when you thought you couldn\u2019t get annoyed a little further, the show creators must have thought that Episode 3 would blow everyone\u2019s wits away only to find out that most have been dismayed by the ending.</p>\n\n<p>Arya, jumping out of nowhere, stabbed the Night King at the exact spot where he was initially created. <i>It was a dud and anticlimactic.</i> I know there are divided opinions on the Arya arc but seriously?</p>\n\n<p>I know there have easter eggs and signs on her since Season , Episode 1 started but why! A Song of Ice and Fire featuring Arya Stark?</p>\n\n<p><b>Easter Eggs for Arya:</b></p>\n\n<p>a. In Season 2, Melisandre told her: <b>\u201cI see darkness in you. Brown eyes, green eyes, blue eyes \u2013 eyes you\u2019ll shut forever.\u201d</b></p>\n\n<p>b. In Season 5-6, her journey in Braavos at the House of Black and White, a temple devoted to the Many-Faced God to which The Faceless Men stay.</p>\n\n<p>Arya met JaQen H'ghar in Season 2 where she was introduced to the Faceless Men\u2019s ability to change appearance at will and their being mysterious assassins.</p>\n\n<p>c. In Season 7, Bran gave Arya the valyrian steel dagger used to kill him in Season 2.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, I love that scene where Bran\u2019s direwolf saved him. I love the direwolves and dragons in the books. It\u2019s sad that direwolves don\u2019t have enough screen time in the TV series for being expensive to make compared to the dragons.</p>\n\n<p>d. In Season 8, Episode 1:</p>\n\n<p>\u2013 The Hound told her how she used to not shut up before</p>\n<p>\u2013 She sneaked up on Jon Snow aka Aegon Targaryen in godswood</p>\n\n<p>e. In Season 8, Episode 2, she asked Gendry how and what the undead are like. Gendy described them as \u201cDeath\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>f. In Season 8, Episode 3, Melisandre reminded her again about the \u201ceyes you\u2019ll shut forever\u201d bit coupled with the question: <b>\u201cAnd what do we say to the god of Death?\u201d</b>, to which she replied: <b>\u201cNot today\u201d.</b></p>\n\n<p>4.\u00a0 Then we see her jumping out of nowhere. End of the Night. Nada.</p>\n\n<p>As much as the easter eggs were there all along, I still believe that nowhere was her story arc focused on the undead since Season 1. As you have read from some comments, there was no connection between her and the Night King.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like the audience was slightly robbed of the notion of the prophecy all along. Prophecy may or may not happen but why the overhype then? In the books, it is always being talked about that even in my dreams, I can still hear the words ringing in my ears. Damn you, GRRM. Your words have deep impact on the book readers. Haha!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Add the \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d story on Jon being both a Stark and a Targaryen and/or Daenerys Targaryen. Both have suffered tremendously on their journeys since Season 1.</p>\n\n<p><i>Jon</i> went through countless battles in the North that started with the Wildlings, Thenn and the White Walkers. <i>Daenerys</i>, on the other hand, lost her Dothraki husband, followers and Viserion (sad), broke chains of the slaves, three full-grown dragons, the Unsullied, Second Sons and the Dothrakis.</p>\n\n<p>Disappointment is real whether everyone agrees or not.

                "content": "<p><p>Hi Princeharryandme. It would be better if I submit this regarding the Winter Is Coming ask earlier. Bear with me for the <b>long post.</b> Haha!</p>\n\n<p>1. Like what the majority of the viewers have said about the darkness of the whole episode, I understand the concept of darkness as the whole battle was against the Night King, White Walkers, wights and the Undead Army.</p>\n\n<p>However, they could have considered to adjust the darkness since TV viewers are not watching the episodes in &ldquo;cinemas or theaters&rdquo;. All have different sizes of their television plus the settings but it could have been appreciated if they did so post-production.</p>\n\n<p><i>The Long Night</i> is one of the stories people in the North have shared for generations. One can understand it deeply if you read the books for full details of the storylines because one will appreciate it all the more as compared to being a TV viewer only. The TV series has streamlined the storylines for brevity and practicality purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Most people have observed that after Seasons 1-4, the writing of the show suffered a bit. <i>It is due to the fact that there are no books anymore for the show creators and writers to follow as a guide for the storyline and dialogues.</i></p>\n\n<p><i>Seasons 1-4 were flawless because the dialogues of the characters came out straight from the books.</i> It&rsquo;s funny, substantial, logical and amusing if you have read all of them.</p>\n\n<p>Remember the moving scene between Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister in Season 1 where they had a conversation about Lyanna Stark and their marriage inside the room? I love that scene in Book 1 and the two actors (Mark Addy and Lena Headey) delivered it so well in the TV series.</p>\n\n<p>Moreoever, notice the inconsistencies of the characters and plot in Seasons 5-7. Except for the penultimate episodes of each season (Episode 9 per season), I have no question for the battle scenes. I appreciate the hard work, quality and fight scenes that the characters and crew have done.</p>\n\n<p><i>Season 5, Episode 9:&nbsp; Battle at Hardhome</i></p>\n<p><i>Season 6, Episode 9:&nbsp; Battle of the Bastards</i></p>\n<p><i>Season 7, Episode 6: Beyond the Wall</i></p>\n\n<p>2. House Stark&rsquo;s motto is Winter is Coming. Houses in the North know of the grave danger about the White Walkers generations ago. The Long Night of yore caused massive death because no one can ever survive the coldest winters for several years. Even Old Nan (old woman taking care of Bran after his accident) never failed to repeat the stories to the Stark children.</p>\n\n<p>Here comes the story of <i>Azor Ahai</i>, a legendary figure who forged the sword called <i>Lightbringer</i> used to defeat the darkness of the Great Other. In the show, the &ldquo;Great Other&rdquo; is referred to as the Night King, White Walkers, wights and the undead army in general.</p>\n\n<p><b> A prophecy predicts that Azor Ahai shall be reborn as The Prince that was Promised.</b></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the hype on the White Walkers since Season 1 mainly focused on this great threat of long winter nights, the undead and on whether the prophecy of Azor Ahai will come into fruition.</p>\n\n<p>3. Fast forward to the final season where both book readers and tv viewers have been anticipating for the longest time ever only to be disappointed on the so-called Long Night. <b>It takes ONE EPISODE to end the Night King vis-a-vis the hype since Season 1.</b></p>\n\n<p>Just when you thought you couldn&rsquo;t get annoyed a little further, the show creators must have thought that Episode 3 would blow everyone&rsquo;s wits away only to find out that most have been dismayed by the ending.</p>\n\n<p>Arya, jumping out of nowhere, stabbed the Night King at the exact spot where he was initially created. <i>It was a dud and anticlimactic.</i> I know there are divided opinions on the Arya arc but seriously?</p>\n\n<p>I know there have easter eggs and signs on her since Season , Episode 1 started but why! A Song of Ice and Fire featuring Arya Stark?</p>\n\n<p><b>Easter Eggs for Arya:</b></p>\n\n<p>a. In Season 2, Melisandre told her: <b>&ldquo;I see darkness in you. Brown eyes, green eyes, blue eyes &ndash; eyes you&rsquo;ll shut forever.&rdquo;</b></p>\n\n<p>b. In Season 5-6, her journey in Braavos at the House of Black and White, a temple devoted to the Many-Faced God to which The Faceless Men stay.</p>\n\n<p>Arya met JaQen H'ghar in Season 2 where she was introduced to the Faceless Men&rsquo;s ability to change appearance at will and their being mysterious assassins.</p>\n\n<p>c. In Season 7, Bran gave Arya the valyrian steel dagger used to kill him in Season 2.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, I love that scene where Bran&rsquo;s direwolf saved him. I love the direwolves and dragons in the books. It&rsquo;s sad that direwolves don&rsquo;t have enough screen time in the TV series for being expensive to make compared to the dragons.</p>\n\n<p>d. In Season 8, Episode 1:</p>\n\n<p>&ndash; The Hound told her how she used to not shut up before</p>\n<p>&ndash; She sneaked up on Jon Snow aka Aegon Targaryen in godswood</p>\n\n<p>e. In Season 8, Episode 2, she asked Gendry how and what the undead are like. Gendy described them as &ldquo;Death&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>f. In Season 8, Episode 3, Melisandre reminded her again about the &ldquo;eyes you&rsquo;ll shut forever&rdquo; bit coupled with the question: <b>&ldquo;And what do we say to the god of Death?&rdquo;</b>, to which she replied: <b>&ldquo;Not today&rdquo;.</b></p>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp; Then we see her jumping out of nowhere. End of the Night. Nada.</p>\n\n<p>As much as the easter eggs were there all along, I still believe that nowhere was her story arc focused on the undead since Season 1. As you have read from some comments, there was no connection between her and the Night King.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like the audience was slightly robbed of the notion of the prophecy all along. Prophecy may or may not happen but why the overhype then? In the books, it is always being talked about that even in my dreams, I can still hear the words ringing in my ears. Damn you, GRRM. Your words have deep impact on the book readers. Haha!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Add the &ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire&rdquo; story on Jon being both a Stark and a Targaryen and/or Daenerys Targaryen. Both have suffered tremendously on their journeys since Season 1.</p>\n\n<p><i>Jon</i> went through countless battles in the North that started with the Wildlings, Thenn and the White Walkers. <i>Daenerys</i>, on the other hand, lost her Dothraki husband, followers and Viserion (sad), broke chains of the slaves, three full-grown dragons, the Unsullied, Second Sons and the Dothrakis.</p>\n\n<p>Disappointment is real whether everyone agrees or not.
