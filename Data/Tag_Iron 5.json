You thought nothing of it and continued reading your book. It steadily built up to a thunderous deluge, so loud that you had to look up and peer out the window. The winds were driving the rain faster, harder, stronger than it had ever before. It died down a little, and you turned back to the book. But before you could read, lightning struck. It had hit an oak tree, legendary for surviving lightning strikes.</p><p>You sighed a quick sigh of relief, but all of a sudden a loud cracking sound was heard, and with a mighty groan the king of the trees split in half, charred and alight with fire. It was only then that you began to fear the storm.</p><p>&ldquo;Thor must be having a hell of a time up there&rdquo; you groaned placing your book down on the table next to you.</p><p>Yeah, you were an avenger but you were still scared of the simple things. You curled into a ball, covering yourself under the blanket. You counted in your head, trying to distract yourself from the thunderous booms outside.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tony was just finishing cleaning up in the kitchen. He placed the last dish in the cupboard and went to join you in your shared bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart?&rdquo; He said knocking before walking into the room, thinking about why he even knocked again. When he walked in, he saw you under the heap of blankets breathing shallowly.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey? Are you alright&rdquo; he said sitting down by you on the bed, his hand moved to your hair, stroking it as you opened an eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo; you sighed finally sitting up, it was then when crashes of lightening, startled air, and booming thunder filled your ears causing you to basically leap into Tony&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart, are you scared off storms?</p><p>&quot;No, I just don&rsquo;t like how loud it is&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled lowly before adjusting the both of you so you were sitting up against the back of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so sad.&rdquo; He poked your nose and held you close, brushing a strand of your hair away from your face. \u00a0You sniff dejectedly and bury your face in his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s watch a movie.&rdquo; He stands up and grabs the remote then comes back to the bed, the same position we were in before. \u00a0He eagerly wraps his arms around you waist, while you once again burying your face against his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this better?&rdquo; He asks as the movie starts, smiling gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course it is, you&rsquo;re here now&rdquo; you smile back, getting ready to cuddle into him more.</p><p>In the darkness your cuddles with Tony feel like a little touch of heaven, warm, together, and cozy. At times you wish you could extend the night just so You could stay close to him for longer, safe in his embrace. His arms always wrapped right around you bringing you a peace you&rsquo;ve never really known before, a calming of the storms in your heart.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you Tony&rdquo; you whispered looking up at him as he looked back down at you.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you more than you could ever know&rdquo; he said placing his lips on top of your hair. At that moment it seemed like the storm had actually calmed, you had realized Tony was and is your peace.</p>",

And also this is to make up for not posting any fics for like two weeks, and for those of you who have requested things, I am working on them right now!!</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just got to make this last adjustment-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to get some sleep, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, when was the last time he slept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark has not slept in three days.\u201d</p><p>Your boyfriend sighed in either irritation or exhaustion (or maybe both) before relenting. With a loving yet victorious smile, you led him to the kitchen where you fixed him breakfast before taking him to bed. \u201cHoney, you need to stop putting so much pressure on yourself. It\u2019s not healthy.\u201d</p><p>You could tell he would have made a sarcastic comeback if he had the energy to talk. You took advantage of his vulnerable silence, making your favorite point in times like this. \u201cI know why you stay up, love. But if you want to keep them safe, you can\u2019t be a drooling, sleep-deprived mess.\u201d</p><p>Tony makes a small grumbling noise in the back of his throat and you think that it\u2019s meant to be some sort of reply probably laced with profanities. With a slight heave, you got Tony into your shared bed (that he barely used) and slid his jeans off so he\u2019d be comfortable. You got him under the covers and was seconds away from leaving before he let out a small whine, hand extended towards you.</p><p>\u201cI would love to sleep right now, but I have a better idea,\u201d The gears turning in his head were probably thinking of something inappropriate, but you quelled those thoughts before they turned to reality. \u201cHow about you send me the updates you need to be done on your suit? I can get them done for you and you can get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked like he was on the edge of accepting your offer, but then he grabbed at you again. \u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d he mumbled. Tony, despite his bad boy persona, was an aggressive cuddler. Most of the time he was the little spoon, and you loved being able to take care of him when he needed a little extra help. You crawled over the bed and into where his arms were waiting, and he closed them around you.</p><p>He nuzzled his face into the crook of your neck, taking in the scent of your shampoo. You carded your fingers through his hair slowly in an attempt to soothe him. Expecting that you\u2019d have to do this until he was asleep, you were surprised when he broke the peaceful silence that had cocooned your bedroom.</p><p>\u201cTh\u2019 updat\u2019s are in the lab, hon\u2019y,\u201d His speech was slurred (you found it adorable whether he was sleepy or drunk) and it took a second to understand what he had said, but when you did, you felt victorious. \u201cI\u2019ll get them done before I come to bed, sweetie. Just rest for a little while and everything will be okay,\u201d you kiss his temple before crawling out of his arms.

Your brain realized with a start what exactly was causing your discomfort and you lost control of your vocal cords.</p><p>Your scream ricocheted out of the lab and through the living room as you clambered on top of the work table, your terror awakening your fight-or-flight instinct. FRIDAY had alerted Tony and the others about your increased heart rate and apparent distress (as if your shriek wouldn\u2019t alert them enough) immediately and you cursed. Whoever wasn\u2019t woken up from your scream was for sure going to be awake from FRIDAY\u2019s joyful little wake-up call.</p><p>Your boyfriend was the first one to arrive at the scene, fear in his eyes.

Instead of asking more questions, your loving boyfriend simply walked to you and pulled you into his arms as you shook, unable to speak coherently over your panic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2026 it t-touched me, T-Tone,\u201d You finally got out. \u201cIt c-crawled on mm-my foot!\u201d When you started sobbing more, he pulled you closer and began to run his fingers through your hair to try and calm you down.</p><p>More people dashed in within moments, all of them wondering what could have possibly penetrated the Avengers Tower at this hour without tripping any alarms. Without lifting your head from Tony\u2019s chest, you could feel the stares of the rest of the Avengers on you and oh how horrible it made you feel.</p><p>For most of everyone in the Tower, sleep was an elusive creature and your scream had chased it away. Your fear began to mesh with guilt and it made the tears on your face fall harder.

You wanted to climb off of the table and out of Tony\u2019s arms and calmly explain to them your phobia, but alas, it\u2019s a phobia. It&rsquo;s presence in your safe haven shook your resolve to the core and kept you from rationally discussing your current state with your friends.</p><p>Tony decided to answer for you, sparing you from babbling a reply through your hysteria. \u201cIt was a rat and it crawled on her while she was working. Go back to bed, I\u2019ve got her.\u201d They looked worried, but Tony\u2019s hard glare chased them away.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we can work on setting traps so we can catch it.

Name it Terminator and give it a little Iron Kitten suit.\u201d You laughed a little through the tears, the image of a kitten with its own suit flying around the Tower lightening the mood. Of course that would be the first thing to pop out of Sam\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry, guys.

Don\u2019t feel bad.\u201d Nat got a hard glare from the archer, but it weakened slightly at the sound of your laugh following the comment.</p><p>Everyone continued to joke around about the ordeal for a few minutes longer until Tony decided it was time to go to bed. \u201cAlright, this is starting to become a chick-flick, so I\u2019m gonna take her to bed.\u201d You moved to get out of his embrace and onto the floor, but he stopped you. \u201cNuh-uh, I\u2019m gonna carry you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You hear a few \u201caww\u201d sounds come from your friends and you giggle into Tony\u2019s neck as he lifted you from the work table. \u201cI thought you said this wasn\u2019t gonna be a chick flick!\u201d Clint shouted when Tony had you almost to the bedroom. </p><p>You and Tony shared a look for a moment before the two of you sent matching middle fingers toward your friend.

Instead of asking more questions, your loving boyfriend simply walked to you and pulled you into his arms as you shook, unable to speak coherently over your panic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2026 it t-touched me, T-Tone,\u201d You finally got out. \u201cIt c-crawled on mm-my foot!\u201d When you started sobbing more, he pulled you closer and began to run his fingers through your hair to try and calm you down.</p><p>More people dashed in within moments, all of them wondering what could have possibly penetrated the Avengers Tower at this hour without tripping any alarms. Without lifting your head from Tony\u2019s chest, you could feel the stares of the rest of the Avengers on you and oh how horrible it made you feel.</p><p>For most of everyone in the Tower, sleep was an elusive creature and your scream had chased it away. Your fear began to mesh with guilt and it made the tears on your face fall harder. Tony was shushing you gently as he rocked you back and forth, ignoring the stares and silent questions from his teammates.</p><p>\u201cTony, what\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Steve had broken the almost-silence with the most obvious question (you were still sobbing so it wasn\u2019t complete silence).</p><p>You wanted to answer him, you really did. You wanted to climb off of the table and out of Tony\u2019s arms and calmly explain to them your phobia, but alas, it\u2019s a phobia. It\u2019s presence in your safe haven shook your resolve to the core and kept you from rationally discussing your current state with your friends.</p><p>Tony decided to answer for you, sparing you from babbling a reply through your hysteria. \u201cIt was a rat and it crawled on her while she was working. Go back to bed, I\u2019ve got her.\u201d They looked worried, but Tony\u2019s hard glare chased them away.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we can work on setting traps so we can catch it. We\u2019ll get it out of here, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Bucky sympathised, wanting you to feel better.</p><p>\u201cWe could get a cat. Those things kill rats and stuff, and it\u2019s even cute. Name it Terminator and give it a little Iron Kitten suit.\u201d You laughed a little through the tears, the image of a kitten with its own suit flying around the Tower lightening the mood. Of course that would be the first thing to pop out of Sam\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry, guys. I didn\u2019t me-mean to wake everyone,\u201d You stuttered. \u201cIt just c-crawled on me an-and I panicked.\u201d Tony brought you a little closer to him while the others were quick to shrug it off like it was no big deal.</p><p>\u201cClint probably would have screamed louder than you did, hon. Don\u2019t feel bad.\u201d Nat got a hard glare from the archer, but it weakened slightly at the sound of your laugh following the comment.</p><p>Everyone continued to joke around about the ordeal for a few minutes longer until Tony decided it was time to go to bed. \u201cAlright, this is starting to become a chick-flick, so I\u2019m gonna take her to bed.\u201d You moved to get out of his embrace and onto the floor, but he stopped you. \u201cNuh-uh, I\u2019m gonna carry you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You hear a few \u201caww\u201d sounds come from your friends and you giggle into Tony\u2019s neck as he lifted you from the work table. \u201cI thought you said this wasn\u2019t gonna be a chick flick!\u201d Clint shouted when Tony had you almost to the bedroom. </p><p>You and Tony shared a look for a moment before the two of you sent matching middle fingers toward your friend. The team laughed at the interaction before retreating to their own rooms, eager to catch up on the sleep lost.</p><p>Once you and Tony were cuddled in bed, you were finally able to relax. There was nothing that could scare you as long as your loving boyfriend was beside you.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Title: They&rsquo;re Quite Repulsive</p><p>Pairing: Tony Stark x Reader</p><p>Summary: Normally you&rsquo;re not a klutz in the lab, but when you&rsquo;re the only one there at oh-god o&rsquo;clock at night and a disturbing foe invades your workspace, things happen.</p><p>Word Count: 1685</p><p>A/N: This is based on an actual phobia I have, don&rsquo;t @ me bro. And also this is to make up for not posting any fics for like two weeks, and for those of you who have requested things, I am working on them right now!!</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got to make this last adjustment-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have to get some sleep, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the boss of-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, when was the last time he slept?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark has not slept in three days.&rdquo;</p><p>Your boyfriend sighed in either irritation or exhaustion (or maybe both) before relenting. With a loving yet victorious smile, you led him to the kitchen where you fixed him breakfast before taking him to bed. &ldquo;Honey, you need to stop putting so much pressure on yourself. It&rsquo;s not healthy.&rdquo;</p><p>You could tell he would have made a sarcastic comeback if he had the energy to talk. You took advantage of his vulnerable silence, making your favorite point in times like this. &ldquo;I know why you stay up, love. But if you want to keep them safe, you can&rsquo;t be a drooling, sleep-deprived mess.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony makes a small grumbling noise in the back of his throat and you think that it&rsquo;s meant to be some sort of reply probably laced with profanities. With a slight heave, you got Tony into your shared bed (that he barely used) and slid his jeans off so he&rsquo;d be comfortable. You got him under the covers and was seconds away from leaving before he let out a small whine, hand extended towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;I would love to sleep right now, but I have a better idea,&rdquo; The gears turning in his head were probably thinking of something inappropriate, but you quelled those thoughts before they turned to reality. &ldquo;How about you send me the updates you need to be done on your suit? I can get them done for you and you can get some sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked like he was on the edge of accepting your offer, but then he grabbed at you again. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mere,&rdquo; he mumbled. Tony, despite his bad boy persona, was an aggressive cuddler. Most of the time he was the little spoon, and you loved being able to take care of him when he needed a little extra help. You crawled over the bed and into where his arms were waiting, and he closed them around you.</p><p>He nuzzled his face into the crook of your neck, taking in the scent of your shampoo. You carded your fingers through his hair slowly in an attempt to soothe him. Expecting that you&rsquo;d have to do this until he was asleep, you were surprised when he broke the peaceful silence that had cocooned your bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; updat&rsquo;s are in the lab, hon&rsquo;y,&rdquo; His speech was slurred (you found it adorable whether he was sleepy or drunk) and it took a second to understand what he had said, but when you did, you felt victorious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them done before I come to bed, sweetie. Just rest for a little while and everything will be okay,&rdquo; you kiss his temple before crawling out of his arms. Tony reached for your pillow as you walked out of the bedroom, him hugging it like you weren&rsquo;t going to be back in a few hours.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Seconds away from being done, you wipe the sweat from your brow with your free hand. &ldquo;Dum-E, soldering iron, please,&rdquo; the robot happily complies, handing you the tool while you try and keep yourself from messing up. You were adding the last adjustment to Tony&rsquo;s repulsor beams and struggling to make everything as perfect as your boyfriend would. Tony never let anyone work on his suit, so you doing this was a bigger deal than some would realize.</p><p>&ldquo;Steady, steady&hellip;&rdquo; you were talking to yourself in an attempt to help keep your hands from shaking. You knew your way around a lab (you met Tony at MIT long ago), but you had to admit that Tony made his suits so complicated that it wasn&rsquo;t a walk in the park.</p><p>&ldquo;Finally!&rdquo; You shout to no one, realizing seconds after you shout that it&rsquo;s some ungodly hour in the night. Cleaning up, you cross your fingers in the hopes that you didn&rsquo;t wake anybody up with your exclamation of victory.</p><p>Once the lab is somewhat clean, you sit in your previous chair and run a hand down your face. You were exhausted and clueless as to how your boyfriend does this for days on end, wanting nothing more to crawl back into your shared bed and sleep until the afternoon. Your body too fatigued to get up in that moment, you lay your head down in your arms, the worktable becoming your trusty substitute pillow.</p><p>You had no idea what time it was when you felt it. It was like a ghost, there one second and gone the next. The short time of its presence and the fact you were in between consciousness and not caused you to doubt whether it even happened, but when it happened again, you knew you weren&rsquo;t hallucinating the feeling of it on your feet.</p><p>You looked down the moment you felt it a second time, catching the culprit in the act. Two beady eyes peered back at you, silently daring you to do something about its presence. Your brain realized with a start what exactly was causing your discomfort and you lost control of your vocal cords.</p><p>Your scream ricocheted out of the lab and through the living room as you clambered on top of the work table, your terror awakening your fight-or-flight instinct. FRIDAY had alerted Tony and the others about your increased heart rate and apparent distress (as if your shriek wouldn&rsquo;t alert them enough) immediately and you cursed. Whoever wasn&rsquo;t woken up from your scream was for sure going to be awake from FRIDAY&rsquo;s joyful little wake-up call.</p><p>Your boyfriend was the first one to arrive at the scene, fear in his eyes. He most likely heard the scream instead of FRIDAY and you felt guilty for waking him how you did. He absorbed the scene of you cowering on the lab table and frantically searched for the threat before coming up empty.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; You stuttered out a broken reply, pointing towards where the rodent scurried to with a shaking finger. You looked horrible; tears were falling from darkened, hollow eyes that desperately needed to rest while frightened sobs escaped your lips.
