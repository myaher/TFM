He\u2019d done his best to behave himself in public all day, but it was night now, and he was back in the safety of his hotel room, and he didn\u2019t care anymore. </p><p>He stumbled over to one of the beds \u2014 the one closest to the bathroom that he <i>always </i>insisted on sleeping in \u2014 and pulled his laptop into his lap. Adaline followed behind him, padlocking the door and making her way to the other side of the room. </p><p>They were sharing a standard two bed hotel room, although they could have probably been upgraded to a suite if Dan had just asked the host of the concert. All of Dan\u2019s expenses were coming out of the charity money, though, so he was determined to use as little of the funds as possible. </p><p>Unfortunately for Adaline, that meant that instead of having her own room, she was forced to suffer through Dan\u2019s antics \u2014 something that Dan distantly realized was probably particularly painful right now. </p><p>\u201cNo, you stupid piece of <i>trash</i>,\u201d Dan muttered when the computer screen shook and informed him that he had the incorrect password. Dan punched each letter of his password into his keyboard forcefully.</p><p>The fucking computer just wasn\u2019t cooperating though. The screen shook and gave him an error message <i>again.</i> Dan entered his password a third time, this time saying the letters out loud as he entered them to make sure he typed it correctly.  \u201c<i>C-o-l-l-i-n-2-0-1-4.</i>\u201d</p><p>The login screen faded and his homescreen \u2014 a picture of him and Darcy smushed cheek to cheek \u2014 loaded. Dan glanced up, and saw that across the room Addie was drunkenly trying to wipe her makeup off. So far it looked like she\u2019d just manage to give herself dark raccoon eyes.</p><p>Dan opened skype, determined to talk to Phil tonight. Since the radio show, they\u2019d only been able to text and Dan missed his boyfr\u2014 <i>Phil\u2019s</i> face. They\u2019d been <i>so fucking close</i> to kissing on that night, and a small part of Dan wished he\u2019d thrown caution into the wind and said fuck the glass wall, fuck privacy, fuck everything, and just kissed him. But in a way, Dan was also grateful to Addie\u2019s phone call for stopping Dan from being <i>too</i> reckless. </p><p>Dan had worried that things might be weird between them, but the only change was that their texts had become impossibly flirtier since then.</p><p>When skype loaded, Dan didn\u2019t hesitate to click on Phil\u2019s name. He didn\u2019t even bother to check if there was a blue <i>online</i> dot next to Phil\u2019s name, he just aggressively smashed the button and watched the little <i>bloop bloop bloop </i>light up as it called Phil. </p><p>The skype ringtone rang <i>once</i>, <i>twice</i>, before Phil answered.</p><p>\u201cHi, Philly!\u201d Dan shrieked cheerfully when a grainy Phil loaded on his screen.</p><p>The Phil that Dan <i>could</i> see on skype looked soft, cozy, and tired. \u201cHi, Dan,\u201d Phil mumbled back, much sleepier. \u201cHow are you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Dan responded, definitely a little too loudly if the way both Phil and Adaline jumped was anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Phil nodded \u2014 or tried to, at least. He was laying in bed, his cheek resting on his blue-and-green checkered pillow.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019look tired.\u201d Dan frowned slightly as the skype call got clearer and he was able to take in the way Phil\u2019s eyelids looked heavy, and the fact that his voice was laced with croakiness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after two in the morning here, I was asleep,\u201d Phil said, rolling his eyes. He didn\u2019t sound upset though.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dan\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cWhy were ya on skype?\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s cheeks flushed, and for a moment, Dan wasn\u2019t sure why. Not until Phil explained, anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re out of town and I missed you, so, um, just in case, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Flattered, Dan bashfully buried his face in his hands and shook his head as he regained his composure. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d he mumbled into his palms. When he could look Phil in the eye again, Dan looked back up, a wide grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat did y\u2019do this weekend?\u201d Dan slurred, his smile never faltering. He leaned forward, resting his elbow on his knee and his chin in his hand.</p><p>\u201cPJ and his girlfriend came up to visit, which was good.\u201d Phil smiled softly, rubbing at his eyes sleepily. The screen turned into a pixelated blur of movement. When skype focused again, Phil was propped up against his headboard. His quiff was messy and his thick black frames were sitting crooked on his face. \u201cTell me about your night, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAds and I went out for beer an\u2019 did a lil\u2019 walking tour on our way back.\u201d Dan precariously leaned off the bed as he reached for the water bottle on the bedside table. </p><p>\u201cMmmmh,\u201d Phil hummed. \u201cI saw.\u201d</p><p>Dan shot back upright, launching himself into the frame. \u201cYa\u2019 did?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil confirmed, looking confused by Dan\u2019s reaction. \u201cI saw your instagram story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Dan murmured, more to himself than Phil. He didn\u2019t <i>quite</i> remember posting anything to instagram, but now that Phil mentioned it, he sort of remembered him and Adaline taking a lot of pictures on their way home. Were those instagram pictures? Dan grabbed his phone from the pillow, pressing his finger to the home button over and over, causing the screen to shake in protest. \u201cM\u2019phone won\u2019t unlock,\u201d he pouted at Phil.</p><p>\u201cType your passcode, then, you silly goose,\u201d Phil teased. </p><p>Dan dropped his phone back onto the bed. \u201cI\u2019m lazy. What\u2019d I post?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing big,\u201d Phil smiled. \u201cJust a few pictures of beer and you guys at some tourist spots.\u201d Phil\u2019s eyebrows rose skeptically. \u201cWhy, did something happen you didn\u2019t want the internet to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWah\u2019?\u201d Dan stammered. \u201cI - uh, well. We talked some.\u201d Dan had blurry memories of nearly shouting about how much he liked Phil Lester on the way home and it\u2019d be just his luck to film some monument during one of his speeches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all just pictures.\u201d Phil assured him. \u201cNo talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Dan smiled dopily.</p><p>Dan watched Phil\u2019s eyes rake up and down the screen and barely resisted the urge to slap his hand over the webcam. He couldn\u2019t handle being under Phil\u2019s scrutiny like that \u2014 not when he couldn\u2019t do something about it. Especially since that <i>something</i> was right on the verge of happening. \u201cI like your outfit tonight, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2019did?\u201d Dan asked, looking down at himself. \u201c<i>Oh</i>,\u201d he murmured. Dan vaguely felt his cheeks burn, so he grabbed the collar of his jumper and tugged it over the bottom half of his face. \u201cAre y\u2019mad?\u201d Dan asked timidly.</p><p>On the screen, Phil blinked back at Dan blankly. \u201cMad?\u201d </p><p>Dan fiddled with the hem of the <i>Pugs Not Drugs</i> jumper. \u201cY\u2019know, that I still have your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Phil shook his head, and for a long second, Dan was worried that Phil <i>was</i> upset with him. \u201cIt looks better on you, anyway.\u201d </p><p>The blush on Dan\u2019s face deepened, and he pulled the sweatshirt even further up, so that the collar was completely covering his head. \u201cThat\u2019s n\u2019 true,\u201d he muttered petulantly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Phil laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even seen me wear it.\u201d</p><p>Dan yanked the collar down again so he could see Phil again. \u201cI have too!\u201d Dan insisted indignantly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen y\u2019wear it <i>loads</i> on your channel!\u201d</p><p>Phil raised his eyebrows skeptically. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I wore it in, like, one video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um, may\u2019ve watched it a few times,\u201d Dan admitted, his eyes darting around the room shiftily.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Phil groaned, his hands shooting up to cover his face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that good of a video!\u201d</p><p>Feeling particularly brazen because of the alcohol coursing through his veins, Dan confessed the real reason he loved that video so much. \u201cI like watching it when \u2018m wearing this jumper.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a triumphant giggle when Phil\u2019s cheeks turned a dark red. </p><p>\u201cOh m\u2019god, <i>Dan</i>,\u201d Adaline whined as she marched across the room and over to Dan\u2019s bed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough of you gushing \u2018bout Phil, \u2018nd I don\u2019t need t\u2019hear you flirt with him on skype, too.\u201d She reached for his computer \u2014 for what, Dan wasn\u2019t sure. But he knew he didn\u2019t want to find out.</p><p>\u201cThen close y\u2019 ears,\u201d Dan grumbled, pulling his computer into his chest and away from Adaline.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no\u2019 how ears work.\u201d Adaline was just as drunk as Dan \u2014 if not drunker \u2014 but she managed to grab the computer of out Dan\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cHey!!!\u201d Dan protested and lunged for his computer a beat too late thanks to his alcohol-slowed reactions. Adaline had already moved to her bed, and without her weight to catch him, Dan fell to the floor of the narrow aisle between the beds. \u201cAdddddd<i>ieee</i>,\u201d he whined from the floor, staring up at his sister with wide, betrayed eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Adaline giggled, shaking her head and rolling her eyes to the camera. Dan watched in horror as she spun the computer around to face him and capture his humiliating position on the floor.</p><p>\u201cA cute idiot,\u201d Phil added. Even from down on the floor, Dan could see the smile on Phil\u2019s face and the twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\u201c<i>Gross</i>,\u201d Adaline groaned. \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 t\u2019bed. G\u2019night, Philip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d both Dan and Phil cried as she started to close the computer. </p><p>\u201cCan I say goodnight to Dan?\u201d Phil pleaded hopefully. </p><p>\u201cFine. Y\u2019get two minutes.\u201d Adaline dropped the computer off the bed and onto Dan\u2019s stomach without warning. </p><p>\u201c<i>Ooof</i>,\u201d Dan grunted as the computer landed on him heavily, nearly knocking the wind out of him. \u201cHi again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, you drunkard,\u201d Phil greeted with a smile. </p><p>\u201cRude,\u201d Dan pouted, unable to keep the smile off his face though. </p><p>\u201cWhen do you get home tomorrow?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cI think like three. Maybe four, I dunno.\u201d Dan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m taking Addie straight t\u2019 the train station when we get there, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Phil frowned.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019?\u201d Dan\u2019s brows furrowed and he moved his head closer to the screen, trying to figure out what was wrong with Phil.</p><p>\u201cI got called into work tomorrow evening,\u201d Phil explained.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he tried to think of why the BBC would want Phil to come in on a Monday. \u201cWhat does the BBC want?\u201d </p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cBeans and Grind, not the BBC,\u201d he corrected. \u201cEmmalee isn\u2019t feeling well so I\u2019m closing for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Dan\u2019s frown twisted into a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s easy, then. I\u2019ll try to come visit you.\u201d</p><p>A slow, matching smile spread onto Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes is up,\u201d Adaline called from above him. \u201cSay g\u2019bye to loverboy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight night, loverboy!\u201d Dan said eagerly with a dramatic wave to the camera. </p><p>A bright red blush spread across Phil\u2019s face. \u201cGoodnight, dear. I\u2019ll \u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t get to hear the rest of whatever Phil was saying, though, because Adaline leaned off the bed and slammed the laptop lid shut. </p><p>\u201cFuck you, sis,\u201d  Dan grumbled as he pushed himself off the floor.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed, bro,\u201d Adaline shot back.</p><p>******************************</p><p>On Monday afternoon, the shop was busier than normal. There was a large group of hipster uni students working on a group project \u2014 marketing, by the sounds of it \u2014 and every ten minutes, one of them would come up to the counter to order another pourover coffee (they refused to drink anything else, apparently), which was painstakingly slow to make, and prevented Phil from being able to do much else. He really wished they\u2019d all order at once so that he could make a larger batch. </p><p>Of course they didn\u2019t though, so Phil only had a few minutes of downtime between making each drink. He\u2019d brought his laptop to work with im, hoping that the shop would be slow enough that he could edit the collab that he\u2019d filmed with PJ over the weekend. So far, Phil had only had time to download the footage and import it into the program, though.</p><p>If he was going to be distracted from youtube work, Phil would have greatly preferred it to be because of Dan, not hipster uni students.</p><p>The truth was, working at Beans and Grind was starting to take up more time that Phil was able to dedicate to it. Over the past few weeks, he had cut back his hours pretty substantially, but it was still burdensome. He\u2019d originally taken the job for a little bit of financial security and so that he\u2019d have a way to make some new friends in London. But Phil didn\u2019t <i>need</i> extra money now \u2014 everything was going well with the BBC \u2014 and he\u2019d met enough people in London that he didn\u2019t feel so isolated anymore. </p><p>For a long time now, Phil had only kept the job because it was an easy excuse to see Dan. But their friendship had developed \u2014 and was teetering right on the edge of something <i>more</i> \u2014 and the need for the coffee shop had grown less and less until it was completely obsolete. Now, the only reason Phil kept the job was because of his friendship with Emmalee, and the knowledge that she struggled to find good help.</p><p>So here Phil was, working a shift that wasn\u2019t normally his, even though he had a video to edit and a boy he wanted to spend time with. </p><p>Phil hoped the group of hipsters left before Dan came so they could catch up in peace at least.</p><p>While Phil waited for the hipsters to leave, and Dan to arrive, Phil found himself growing distracted from working on his video, and watching a recap video of Dan\u2019s performance in Germany instead. The customers weren\u2019t paying him any attention, and Phil really didn\u2019t get a shit about their opinion of him, so he didn\u2019t even bother trying to hide the his earphones. </p><p>Just as Phil had expected, the new song \u2014 or snippet of a song, really, since it was only about a minute and a half long \u2014 was something Phil had heard before. It wasn\u2019t any of the songs Phil thought Dan might play, though. </p><p>No, it was the slow song, the one he\u2019d written the guitar part on skype with Phil during their first coproductive session. </p><p><i>\u201cThis song is really special to me,\u201d </i>Dan was saying in the video.<i> \u201cWriting it was really what inspired me to shape my new album around a concept.\u201d The crowd screamed loudly as Dan pulled up a wooden stool and took an acoustic guitar from a stagehand. \u201cI talked about it the other day on BBC Radio, but if any of you missed it, I\u2019m writing a concept album \u2014 it\u2019s centered around not liking what you have, about wanting something different, and, really, about just <b>going</b> for it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit different from my other stuff, but I hope you all like it.\u201d Dan smiled weakly, giving away just how nervous he was. \u201cThis song is about that middle part \u2014 wanting what you don\u2019t have.\u201d</i></p><p>Of course, Phil had heard the acoustic guitar portion of the song before, but Dan hadn\u2019t shared the lyrics with him yet. When Dan was originally writing the song, Phil hadn\u2019t known that Dan liked him \u2014 would never have even imagined that the song might be about, well, <i>him</i>.</p><p>But knowing that now, Phil suddenly understood why Dan had written <i>this</i> song when they were on skype together. That was well over a month ago, and Dan wasn\u2019t even here, but Phil felt his cheeks growing hot as he realized he\u2019d essentially been Dan\u2019s <i>muse</i> while writing this song. </p><p>Now Phil was getting the full experience though, and finally getting to hear the lyrics. Phil could hear the raw <i>want</i> that Dan was capturing with this song\u2026 And now that Phil knew the concept of this album and just how much it pertained to <i>him</i>\u2026</p><p>Well, now he was have trouble holding literal <i>tears </i>back. Based on the lyrics, it sounded like Dan was lusting after something and like he desperately wanted something he couldn\u2019t have. And, unbeknownst to the world, that something was <i>Phil</i>.</p><p>The song perfectly reflected how Phil felt at that time. Apparently Dan had felt exactly the same.</p><p>The last chords of the song had barely faded away before Phil restarted the clip and listened to it again and again and again. </p><p>He listened it it so many times over the course of the next hour that he\u2019d memorized the lyrics and could hum the melody from memory alone. </p><p>Phil absolutely loved it, and if this is what Dan\u2019s entire album was going to be like, Phil thought he was going to love it, too.</p><p>Afternoon faded into early evening. Much to Phil\u2019s displeasure, the hipsters were still there, and there was no sign of Dan. </p><p>Dejectedly, Phil wiped the counter down and willed Dan to come through the door, even though he\u2019d only promised to <i>try</i> to come by when he got home. The past three days felt like an eternity, though, and Phil <i>missed</i> Dan \u2014 far more than was probably reasonable for such a short period of time. </p><p>Three of the students packed up their laptops and messily discarded their dishes on the counter that Phil had <i>just</i> cleaned. Having to do and redo the same damn tasks back to back was Phil\u2019s <i>least </i>favorite part of the job. He moved the dishes to the sink and re-wet his washrag, not bothering to bid the customers a good day when he heard the door chime as they left. </p><p>Phil turned around to clean the counter for a second time, and was met with warm brown eyes, curly hair, and a wide smile. </p><p>\u201c<i>Dan</i>,\u201d Phil gasped, his lips turning up into a grin of his own. \u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d he added stupidly. The door hadn\u2019t chimed a second time; Dan must have slipped in while the hipsters were leaving. </p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Dan smiled. His eyes flicked over to the remaining customers. Phil\u2019s eyes followed Dan\u2019s gaze and he shrugged apathetically. </p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Dan suggested cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cDecaf or regular?\u201d Phil asked even as he grabbed a cup and stuck it beneath the espresso spout, anticipating Dan\u2019s answer.</p><p>\u201cRegular. You can make it a double instead of a triple, though.\u201d</p><p><i>Of course.</i> Phil shook his head in mock exasperation. \u201cYou do know that it\u2019s nearly six, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a long weekend and I\u2019m tired, let me live.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice was lower, scratchier, than normal, and Phil could see dark bags shining through what looked to be some sort of concealer under his eyes. Dan\u2019s trip to Germany had been short, and from both his texts and his instagram stories, it looked like he\u2019d been doing stuff nonstop. He was probably desperate to curl up in bed and do nothing \u2014 Phil would be anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou could go sleep if you want,\u201d Phil offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather talk to you.\u201d Dan winked. </p><p>Phil felt himself blush and funneled his energy into making Dan\u2019s espresso so that Dan wouldn\u2019t see how flustered he was. </p><p>The sun set, the remaining hipsters left, and Dan finished his coffee but didn\u2019t go home. Not long after arriving, he\u2019d pulled a stool over from the other end of the counter so that he could sit as close to Phil as possible. A small fire flickered in the fireplace, casting a warm glowing light onto the pair.</p><p>\u201cDid Adaline like Germany?\u201d Phil asked, leaning across the counter to shrink the distance between them even more.</p><p>\u201cShe <i>loved</i> it! She kept saying it was the best birthday present she\u2019d ever gotten.\u201d</p><p>As the evening wore on, Dan regaled Phil with stories from their trip, explaining the context of some of his instagram stories. Every tidbit Phil learned about Dan, about his relationship with his sister, about his eagerness to see the world and help people, made Phil like him <i>that much more</i>. </p><p>When his coffee was gone, Dan ordered a second one. It was a coffee that Phil thought Dan definitely didn\u2019t need since it was almost <i>eight</i> at this point, even if this one was decaf, but Dan was drinking it anyway. </p><p>\u201cAnyway, tell me more about your friend\u2019s visit,\u201d Dan said as he leaned in closer to Phil, looking particularly beautiful in the soft, flickering light of the fire. </p><p>\u201cWe filmed a couple of collabs, played a lot of board games, went out for a fancy dinner.\u201d Phil busied himself with wiping down the machines and stacking the dishes in the dishwasher. Talking about his weekend with PJ and Sophie without confessing how much time they had spent grilling him for information about his blossoming relationship with Dan was hard. </p><p>\u201cOooo, did you have good food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Phil huffed indignantly. \u201cWe got cheese fondue.\u201d</p><p>Dan cocked his head to the side, wrinkling his face up in confusion. \u201cBut you hate cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Phil cried, his voice coming out higher than normal. \u201cIt was awful, I basically just had bread and fruit for dinner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you go for that, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s  birthday \u2014 that\u2019s PJ\u2019s girlfriend \u2014 was back in February so we were having a belated celebration.\u201d Phil shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can make someone change their birthday restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I \u2014\u201d </p><p>Whatever Dan had been going to say was cut off by the door chime, which jarred them both out of the conversation. Instinctively, both Dan and Phil turned to look at the person entering.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan muttered under his breath as soon as he caught sight of them, swivelling back to Phil and resolutely turning his back on the door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Phil trailed off, eyes wide in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan confirmed. </p><p>Phil barely had time to utter a quiet <i>oh</i> before the high-pitched shrieking started.</p><p>\u201cI should have known I\u2019d find you here!\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was louder and more shrill than Phil had seen online. Her heels <i>clack clack clacked</i> as she made her way across the coffee shop, coming to a stop just behind Dan. In every picture that Phil had seen of this woman online, she\u2019d looked <i>immaculate</i>. But now that he was seeing her in person, she looked a little more <i>fake</i>. Phil could see just how much makeup was caked on her face, and there was no way that her nails were naturally that thick or long.  </p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you returned any of my calls?\u201d The woman aggressively snapped at Dan. </p><p>Dan shoved his coffee away from himself, but didn\u2019t turn to face the woman. If anything, he slumped even <i>further</i> forward, closing a bit more of the distance between Phil and him.</p><p>Phil could feel the wind from the sigh Dan exhaled, could see the subtle shake of his head and the lines forming around his eyes as he squeezed them tightly shut. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Izzy?\u201d Dan asked in a quiet, resigned voice. He sounded defeated, like he was still upset \u2014 maybe even hurt? Phil couldn\u2019t help wondering how Dan felt, couldn\u2019t help wishing that he could <i>ask</i>.</p><p>\u201cSo this is him,\u201d Isabella snapped. She was glaring daggers at the back of Dan\u2019s head. \u201cThe <i>cabr\u00f3n</i>.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to get Dan\u2019s attention; his back straightened and his already tense shoulders tightened even more. His eyes flew open and he stared at Phil in horror. </p><p>\u201cThis is who?\u201d he asked, his back still to Isabella. His tone was tense and came out more like a warning than anything else. </p><p>Isabella\u2019s eyes drifted to Phil, disdainfully raking up and down his body before settling on his face. The intense scrutiny \u2014 and her displeased expression\u2014 made Phil squirm awkwardly. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Phil, right?\u201d Isabella asked, not sounding like she really wanted an answer from Phil \u2014 or Dan for that matter. Phil flinched back, surprised by the derogatory tone she was using to talk about <i>him</i>; she didn\u2019t even <i>know</i> Phil.</p><p>Phil was <i>well aware</i> of the fact that Isabella and Dan didn\u2019t have the best of relationships, and had suspected that she was, well, kind of a bitch. And now that he was meeting her, now that he was hearing how she talked to Dan and seeing the way she looked at him, Phil suddenly felt like, if anything, he had <i>underestimated</i> how horrible she was. How <i>shitty</i> their relationship must have been at times. </p><p>How the <i>hell</i> had Dan managed to date her? Especially for almost a year.</p><p>\u201cIs this the fag who turned you into a full on homo?\u201d Her face was filled with disgust as she looked back and forth between Phil and Dan. Although Dan had sat up more rigidly, he was still <i>very</i> close to Phil \u2014 something Isabella was undoubtedly picking up on, and clearly not very happy about. </p><p>The comment seemed to be too much for Dan, though, because he forcefully stood up, finally spinning around to face Isabella. Phil caught sight of the angry glare on Dan\u2019s face before his back was fully to him.</p><p>\u201cLeave Phil out of this, Isabella,\u201d Dan ordered. </p><p>If Phil had felt awkward before, he was downright <i>uncomfortable</i> now. He wasn\u2019t particularly enjoying the way Isabella was talking about him as if he wasn\u2019t in the room. Whatever this fight was, Phil didn\u2019t want to be a part of it \u2014 and it sounded like Dan wanted Isabella to focus on something else, too. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to ask this one more time,\u201d Dan continued tersely. \u201c<i>What do you want?</i>\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes shifted from Dan to Isabella. Her hands were crossed in front of her chest, one hip popped out. </p><p>\u201cI want to get back together,\u201d she said, voice clipped, as if it were obvious. </p><p>From what Phil could tell, she actually looked serious, too. How the hell could she think that was a reasonable request? She\u2019d <i>cheated</i> on Dan!</p><p>Dan laughed, but it was a bitter chuckle, not the boisterous happy laugh Phil was accustomed to hearing. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he retorted harshly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Is it because of him?\u201d Isabella nodded her head towards Phil, who was still frozen in shock behind the counter. God, he <i>really</i> didn\u2019t want to witness this.</p><p>\u201cLook, can we talk about this in private?\u201d Dan gestured outside. </p><p>Isabella scoffed. \u201cIf you wanted to talk <i>in private,</i> you should have answered my phone calls. Now tell me, is it or is it not because of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it fucking matter?\u201d Dan spat. \u201cI don\u2019t love you, why the <i>hell</i> would I get back together with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d If Phil wasn\u2019t mistaken, Isabella sounded <i>hurt</i>, like she was <i>begging</i> Dan to not deny loving her. Phil wasn\u2019t sure what right she had to make such a request.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say whatever the hell I want, Izzy,\u201d Dan barked, rubbing his hands roughly down his face with an aggravated sigh. \u201cI <i>never</i> fucking loved you. I was too caught up in my fucking job to realize how shitty of a girlfriend you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! We were happy.\u201d Isabella\u2019s scornful eyes flickered back over to Phil, and he found himself automatically taking a few steps backwards. \u201cOr at least we were before <i>someone</i> came into the picture. Now fucking tell me, is <i>he</i> the reason you broke up with me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you forgetting the part where you <i>cheated</i> on me?\u201d Dan cried, sounding scandalized. \u201cOr the part where you fucking <i>used </i>me for <i>months</i>?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh. </i>That was new. Phil had no idea exactly what Dan meant by being <i>used</i>, but he could imagine \u2014 and everything he thought of was horrible. </p><p> \u201cI didn\u2019t <i>use</i> you, Danny,\u201d she argued, looking pissed off Dan would even suggest such a thing. </p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Dan sneered.</p><p>Isabella took a menacing step forward. \u201cWhatever. But you didn\u2019t answer my question about this <i>cabr\u00f3n</i>.\u201d Her voice was as harsh and sharp as the sound of her heels <i>clack clacking</i> with the movement. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a question worth answering.\u201d</p><p>Isabella scoffed. \u201cI should have known when you told me you liked guys you\u2019d dump me for one eventually.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise. What kind of biphobic bullshit was <i>that</i>? </p><p>Anger was practically <i>radiating</i> off Dan and the tension in the coffee shop felt thick enough to cut with a knife. Dan\u2019s hands stopped tapping against his thighs, and instead clamped into tight fists by his sides. Phil took a small step backwards towards the backroom, preparing to flee if things got any more heated.</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit, not <i>this</i> again.\u201d Dan glanced over his shoulder, sending Phil an apologetic look \u2014 for what, Phil wasn\u2019t sure. It\u2019s not like Dan could control the crap coming out of Isabella\u2019s mouth. \u201cFirst of fucking all, I told you I\u2019m <i>bi</i>sexual. That means I like boys <i>and</i> girls. It\u2019s not that hard of a fucking concept. Do you realize how offensive it is to accuse me of breaking up with you because you\u2019re not a guy, even though I like girls, too? <i>Bisexuality is a real fucking thing, Izzy</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hands unclenched, only to reach up and pull at his hair. \u201cSecond of fucking all, I broke up with you because you\u2019re a manipulative, cheating <i>bitch,</i> and were using me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only cheated on you because you stopped sleeping with me!\u201d Isabella argued. Something about the way she said it made Phil think she truly believed it was a legitimate excuse. </p><p>Phil sort of knew that Dan had stopped sleeping with her \u2014 although Phil wasn\u2019t exactly sure <i>when</i>.  Still, he couldn\u2019t help but take a <i>little</i> bit of satisfaction in that. Phil <i>hated</i> imagining Dan sleeping with someone else, someone that wasn\u2019t <i>him</i>, even though he knew most of Dan and Isabella\u2019s relationship was based on, well, physical <i>affection.</i></p><p>\u201cOh fuck off,\u201d Dan scoffed. \u201cUs not having sex anymore doesn\u2019t excuse you <i>fucking</i> those guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to tell me there was nothing going on with this <i>pendejo</i>?\u201d Isabella looked at Phil again. He didn\u2019t know spanish, didn\u2019t know what <i>pendejo</i> meant, but from the tone of her voice \u2014 and the hateful look on her face \u2014 Phil knew it wasn\u2019t flattering. \u201cYou can\u2019t really tell me you\u2019re any better than me! Is he the reason you stopped sleeping with me? Because you were fucking him instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI <i>never</i> would have cheated on you, and you know that!\u201d Dan shot back, enraged.</p><p>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d Isabella bit out. \u201cAre you with him now? Cause the media seems to think you are and I&rsquo;m inclined to believe it. Why else would you refuse me!?\u201d Isabella gestured toward herself as if she really couldn&rsquo;t understand </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your fucking business!\u201d Dan practically growled. He moved towards Isabella \u2014 a move that definitely would have intimated Phil if he was standing in Isabella\u2019s tall, pointy heels. \u201cYou and I are over. The end. Now get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>For a minute, Phil wasn\u2019t sure <i>what</i> Isabella was going to do. She was fuming, her face hard and her body tense. From what Phil had seen so far, Isabella had one <i>hell</i> of a temper and the fury etched in her body made him worry that it might escalate even more. </p><p>She was frozen like that for nearly a full minute, but eventually she turned around and made for the door. The echo of her heels on the floor was loud in the tense silence of the coffee shop. </p><p>She only made it halfway there before she turned back around and charged back to the counter, coming to a stop just in front of Dan. She was closer than before, close enough that Phil could smell her sickeningly sweet perfume. Her hand reached out to grab Dan\u2019s, but he pulled back. </p><p>The anger seemed to have dissipated, and was instead replaced with a sad, pitiful look.</p><p>\u201cWe were on a good path, Danny!\u201d She was pleading now. If Phil could stand her, he\u2019d probably feel embarrassed for her. \u201cThe media loved us, your fans loved us! I <i>miss </i>you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you miss the media and the fan attention, not me.\u201d Dan laughed coldly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice that the media has hardly been paying attention to you now that you\u2019re not <i>Dan Howell\u2019s Girlfriend</i>.\u201d </p><p>Isabella huffed, and the rage from earlier flickered in her eyes again. Phil genuinely expected her to retaliate.</p><p>But she took a few deep breaths and her shoulders deliberately relaxed as she stuck to her attempts to be sweet, maybe even <i>loving</i>. \u201cOf <i>course </i>I miss <i>you</i>.\u201d Isabella\u2019s eyes were wide and full of what Phil was sure was supposed to be innocence. \u201cI miss every single part of you, Danny.\u201d</p><p>Phil fought back a gag \u2014 he was pretty sure he knew what <i>that</i> meant, and the implication of it didn\u2019t sit well with him. </p><p>Maybe Phil\u2019s reaction, or Dan\u2019s silence, spurred her on, because Isabella continued talking. \u201cI miss spending time with you, I miss the way you used to hold me, and touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell too fucking bad,\u201d Dan said flippantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Isabella roared.</p><p>\u201cIt means I don\u2019t want to ever fucking touch you again,\u201d Dan spat.</p><p>Isabella stepped closer, anger creeping back onto her face. \u201cI think you need a reminder of what you\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t have time to prepare himself for what happened \u2014 and he doubted Dan did either.</p><p>Isabella launched herself forward, colliding with Dan and pressing her lips to his. </p><p>How fucking <i>dare</i> she? Phil\u2019s blood positively <i>boiled</i>. He <i>never</i> wanted to see Dan kiss someone else and now he was forced to stand here and watch Isabella glue her lips to Dan\u2019s. Isabella had <i>no</i> right to force herself on Dan, to kiss him when he didn\u2019t belong to her anymore. </p><p>Phil hadn\u2019t even had the opportunity to kiss Dan yet, but he still felt <i>so possessive</i> over him. </p><p>Dan was frozen for a split second, completely rigid and not moving. It felt like time stood still as Isabella insistently pressed her lips to a completely immobile Dan, and all Phil could do was <i>stare.</i></p><p>Something snapped in Dan, though, and Phil watched Dan\u2019s hands come up and land on her shoulders, forcefully pushing her away without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i> is wrong with you?\u201d Dan shouted. \u201cYou have <i>no</i> right to kiss me. Get out of my fucking face <i>right fucking now</i>,\u201d Dan seethed. </p><p>Isabella recoiled from Dan\u2019s touch, flinching back and stumbling on her tall heels. She looked shocked, and the hurt and rage were both back in full force. In fact, she looked more livid, more crazed, than she had thus far. </p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Isabella screeched, her voice full of venom. \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, Dan Howell!\u201d </p><p>Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel sharply and marched towards the door.</p><p>\u201cUnlikely!\u201d Dan roared after her, almost laughing as she stormed out the door.</p><p>Once Isabella was gone, the coffee shop fell into silence except for the sound of Dan\u2019s heavy breathing. Phil wasn\u2019t sure what to say, wasn\u2019t sure what to do. He felt like a lot of information \u2014 information he wasn\u2019t sure he was supposed to have \u2014 had just been dropped on him, and he didn\u2019t know what to do with it.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t Phil\u2019s battle, and Isabella was nothing but his almost-boyfriend\u2019s ex-girlfriend, but he was <i>pissed</i>. Pissed about the degrading way Isabella had talked about <i>both</i> of their sexualities. Pissed about the fact that Isabella kissed Dan without his consent. Pissed about Isabella\u2019s attempts to justify her cheating and get Dan back.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t even <i>begin</i> to fathom how Dan was feeling right now.</p><p>It took almost a full minute, but Dan\u2019s breathing eventually returned to normal, and he turned around, collapsing back on his stool.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Phil murmured when Dan looked up at him. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA giant fucking shitshow?\u201d Dan raised his eyebrows and smiled humorously.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to say \u2018unfair\u2019, but yeah, that works too.\u201d Phil offered Dan what he hoped was a reassuring smile. Phil <i>desperately</i> wanted to reach out and hold Dan\u2019s hand, run his fingers through Dan\u2019s hair. Something. <i>Anything</i>. </p><p>But Phil was hyper aware of the fact that they were in public \u2014 and that Isabella could come back in at any second \u2014 so he kept his hands to himself.</p><p>\u201cSorry you had to see that,\u201d Dan said, sounding genuinely apologetic. </p><p>After all of <i>that</i>, how could Dan\u2019s first reaction be to apologize to Phil? </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always been too dramatic for her own good,\u201d Dan continued. \u201cThank fuck there wasn\u2019t anyone else here today. But still, I\u2019m sorry you got roped into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Phil insisted, unable to understand why Dan was feeling guilty; there was nothing he could have done to stop it. Hell, Dan had tried to stop Isabella multiple times and she\u2019d just <i>kept going</i>. </p><p>Dan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI mean, it sort of is. She\u2019s not, like, entirely wrong.\u201d He averted his eyes. </p><p>Phil didn\u2019t know what to say, and wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure which accusations Dan seemed to think Isabella had some grounds to make. He wanted to ask, he wanted to <i>push</i>. </p><p>But then again, after learning about Dan\u2019s album, and hearing the lyrics to the song he\u2019d written, Phil was fairly certain he could guess which accusation held some truth. </p><p>\u201cThanks for the coffee,\u201d Dan muttered, looking back at Phil, \u201cBut I think I\u2019m going to go home and have something a bit stronger.\u201d Shifting off of his stool, Dan went to walk away. </p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t ready for him to go yet, though. </p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Phil said, grabbing Dan\u2019s arm before he could pull completely away. \u201cLet me buy you a drink. You can rant all you want to me if you feel like it.\u201d Phil realized that Dan might want to drop it and focus on something happier, so he softly added, \u201cOr not talk about it. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have, like, work?\u201d Dan asked, gesturing around the coffeeshop.</p><p>Phil glanced at the clock. </p><p>\u201cEh, we\u2019re set to close in half an hour and it\u2019s been dead since those kids left.\u201d Phil shrugged with his free arm. \u201cI think we can afford to close early for one night.\u201d What Emmalee didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes flickered down to his arm, which Phil was still holding onto. After only a moment\u2019s hesitation, he nodded slowly. \u201cYeah&hellip; Yeah, okay. That sounds good.\u201d A shy smile grew on his face.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips twitched up into a small smile, relieved that Dan wanted to spend time with him despite still looking riled up from the fight. \u201cI need like ten minutes to close up. Why don\u2019t you grab a warmer coat in the meantime and then we can go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d Dan smiled. \u201cWanna just meet me upstairs when you\u2019re done? Maybe we can, um, have a drink at mine or something before we go out?\u201d</p><p>Without his consent, Phil\u2019s eyebrows shot up, betraying his surprise that Dan was <i>inviting him up to his apartment.</i></p><p>Phil wanted that though. He <i>really</i> wanted that.</p><p>\u201cA drink at yours sounds great,\u201d Phil agreed. A drink, a cuddle, a kiss. Whatever. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dan said with a note of finality. \u201cIt\u2019s the building right next door. I\u2019m in apartment 701. I\u2019ll tell the doorman to let you in.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, that works,\u201d Phil smiled softly. </p><p>Dan grinned back, lingering for moment before grabbing his light jacket. He pulled it on, not bothering to zip it up, and smiled \u2014 a smile that was filled with excitement and anxiety. </p><p>\u201cSee you soon, Philly.\u201d Dan gave Phil a two-fingered salute and ducked out the door.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t waste any time in rinsing out Dan\u2019s mug and adding it to the dishwasher. The counters were clean, but he\u2019d never gotten around to wiping down the table that the uni students were at earlier. He grabbed a rag and the keys, planning to lock the door just in case anyone came. </p><p>Unfortunately, a customer walked in before Phil could make it to the door.</p><p>\u201cHi, welcome! We\u2019re closing in ten minutes, so it\u2019s to-go orders only now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cGreat! What can I get for you?\u201d Phil asked, not so subtly trying to hurry her along. Unfortunately for him, the lady was looking straight at the menu, and didn\u2019t even seem to be aware of Phil. Phil\u2019s heart sank. That didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I need just a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem! Just let me know when you\u2019re ready!\u201d Phil said in as chipper of a voice as he could manage and smiled a wide, fake grin despite the fact that he was very, <i>very</i> much annoyed.</p><p>Grabbing his phone, Phil hid it below the counter, and quickly texted Dan.</p><p><i>Sorry a customer just walked in so I might be a little bit longer. I told her we are only doing to-go orders though, so it shouldn\u2019t be that long.</i></p><p>Almost immediately, his phone lit up with a reply.</p><p><i>dw take your time</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have a toasted crumpet, please,\u201d the lady finally said a moment later, thankfully quicker than Phil had honestly been expecting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be right up!\u201d Phil replied quickly, and took the last crumpet from the display case in order to drop it in the toaster. Mentally, Phil urged the toaster to cook faster.</p><p>While the woman\u2019s order heated up, Phil glanced back at his phone and saw another message from Dan.</p><p><i>not too long though plz</i></p><p> Phil couldn\u2019t help the wide grin that spread across his face in response, because it was clear that Dan was just as impatient for <i>whatever</i> was about to happen as Phil was.</p><hr><p><b>a/n: </b>come scream at me! i will wait to post asks with spoilers for 24 hours though :)\u00a0</p>",
        "body_abstract": "<p><b>title: </b>Love Yourself<br><b>summary: </b>A lot of things about Dan&rsquo;s life are pretty great. He gets to make the music he wants, he&rsquo;s got a great fanbase, and his manager is his best friend. A few things about his life suck a bit more.

He\u2019d done his best to behave himself in public all day, but it was night now, and he was back in the safety of his hotel room, and he didn\u2019t care anymore. </p><p>He stumbled over to one of the beds \u2014 the one closest to the bathroom that he <i>always </i>insisted on sleeping in \u2014 and pulled his laptop into his lap. Adaline followed behind him, padlocking the door and making her way to the other side of the room. </p><p>They were sharing a standard two bed hotel room, although they could have probably been upgraded to a suite if Dan had just asked the host of the concert. All of Dan\u2019s expenses were coming out of the charity money, though, so he was determined to use as little of the funds as possible. </p><p>Unfortunately for Adaline, that meant that instead of having her own room, she was forced to suffer through Dan\u2019s antics \u2014 something that Dan distantly realized was probably particularly painful right now. </p><p>\u201cNo, you stupid piece of <i>trash</i>,\u201d Dan muttered when the computer screen shook and informed him that he had the incorrect password. Dan punched each letter of his password into his keyboard forcefully.</p><p>The fucking computer just wasn\u2019t cooperating though. The screen shook and gave him an error message <i>again.</i> Dan entered his password a third time, this time saying the letters out loud as he entered them to make sure he typed it correctly.  \u201c<i>C-o-l-l-i-n-2-0-1-4.</i>\u201d</p><p>The login screen faded and his homescreen \u2014 a picture of him and Darcy smushed cheek to cheek \u2014 loaded. Dan glanced up, and saw that across the room Addie was drunkenly trying to wipe her makeup off. So far it looked like she\u2019d just manage to give herself dark raccoon eyes.</p><p>Dan opened skype, determined to talk to Phil tonight. Since the radio show, they\u2019d only been able to text and Dan missed his boyfr\u2014 <i>Phil\u2019s</i> face. They\u2019d been <i>so fucking close</i> to kissing on that night, and a small part of Dan wished he\u2019d thrown caution into the wind and said fuck the glass wall, fuck privacy, fuck everything, and just kissed him. But in a way, Dan was also grateful to Addie\u2019s phone call for stopping Dan from being <i>too</i> reckless. </p><p>Dan had worried that things might be weird between them, but the only change was that their texts had become impossibly flirtier since then.</p><p>When skype loaded, Dan didn\u2019t hesitate to click on Phil\u2019s name. He didn\u2019t even bother to check if there was a blue <i>online</i> dot next to Phil\u2019s name, he just aggressively smashed the button and watched the little <i>bloop bloop bloop </i>light up as it called Phil. </p><p>The skype ringtone rang <i>once</i>, <i>twice</i>, before Phil answered.</p><p>\u201cHi, Philly!\u201d Dan shrieked cheerfully when a grainy Phil loaded on his screen.</p><p>The Phil that Dan <i>could</i> see on skype looked soft, cozy, and tired. \u201cHi, Dan,\u201d Phil mumbled back, much sleepier. \u201cHow are you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Dan responded, definitely a little too loudly if the way both Phil and Adaline jumped was anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Phil nodded \u2014 or tried to, at least. He was laying in bed, his cheek resting on his blue-and-green checkered pillow.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019look tired.\u201d Dan frowned slightly as the skype call got clearer and he was able to take in the way Phil\u2019s eyelids looked heavy, and the fact that his voice was laced with croakiness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after two in the morning here, I was asleep,\u201d Phil said, rolling his eyes. He didn\u2019t sound upset though.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dan\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cWhy were ya on skype?\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s cheeks flushed, and for a moment, Dan wasn\u2019t sure why. Not until Phil explained, anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re out of town and I missed you, so, um, just in case, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Flattered, Dan bashfully buried his face in his hands and shook his head as he regained his composure. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d he mumbled into his palms. When he could look Phil in the eye again, Dan looked back up, a wide grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat did y\u2019do this weekend?\u201d Dan slurred, his smile never faltering. He leaned forward, resting his elbow on his knee and his chin in his hand.</p><p>\u201cPJ and his girlfriend came up to visit, which was good.\u201d Phil smiled softly, rubbing at his eyes sleepily. The screen turned into a pixelated blur of movement. When skype focused again, Phil was propped up against his headboard. His quiff was messy and his thick black frames were sitting crooked on his face. \u201cTell me about your night, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAds and I went out for beer an\u2019 did a lil\u2019 walking tour on our way back.\u201d Dan precariously leaned off the bed as he reached for the water bottle on the bedside table. </p><p>\u201cMmmmh,\u201d Phil hummed. \u201cI saw.\u201d</p><p>Dan shot back upright, launching himself into the frame. \u201cYa\u2019 did?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil confirmed, looking confused by Dan\u2019s reaction. \u201cI saw your instagram story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Dan murmured, more to himself than Phil. He didn\u2019t <i>quite</i> remember posting anything to instagram, but now that Phil mentioned it, he sort of remembered him and Adaline taking a lot of pictures on their way home. Were those instagram pictures? Dan grabbed his phone from the pillow, pressing his finger to the home button over and over, causing the screen to shake in protest. \u201cM\u2019phone won\u2019t unlock,\u201d he pouted at Phil.</p><p>\u201cType your passcode, then, you silly goose,\u201d Phil teased. </p><p>Dan dropped his phone back onto the bed. \u201cI\u2019m lazy. What\u2019d I post?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing big,\u201d Phil smiled. \u201cJust a few pictures of beer and you guys at some tourist spots.\u201d Phil\u2019s eyebrows rose skeptically. \u201cWhy, did something happen you didn\u2019t want the internet to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWah\u2019?\u201d Dan stammered. \u201cI - uh, well. We talked some.\u201d Dan had blurry memories of nearly shouting about how much he liked Phil Lester on the way home and it\u2019d be just his luck to film some monument during one of his speeches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all just pictures.\u201d Phil assured him. \u201cNo talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Dan smiled dopily.</p><p>Dan watched Phil\u2019s eyes rake up and down the screen and barely resisted the urge to slap his hand over the webcam. He couldn\u2019t handle being under Phil\u2019s scrutiny like that \u2014 not when he couldn\u2019t do something about it. Especially since that <i>something</i> was right on the verge of happening. \u201cI like your outfit tonight, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2019did?\u201d Dan asked, looking down at himself. \u201c<i>Oh</i>,\u201d he murmured. Dan vaguely felt his cheeks burn, so he grabbed the collar of his jumper and tugged it over the bottom half of his face. \u201cAre y\u2019mad?\u201d Dan asked timidly.</p><p>On the screen, Phil blinked back at Dan blankly. \u201cMad?\u201d </p><p>Dan fiddled with the hem of the <i>Pugs Not Drugs</i> jumper. \u201cY\u2019know, that I still have your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Phil shook his head, and for a long second, Dan was worried that Phil <i>was</i> upset with him. \u201cIt looks better on you, anyway.\u201d </p><p>The blush on Dan\u2019s face deepened, and he pulled the sweatshirt even further up, so that the collar was completely covering his head. \u201cThat\u2019s n\u2019 true,\u201d he muttered petulantly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Phil laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even seen me wear it.\u201d</p><p>Dan yanked the collar down again so he could see Phil again. \u201cI have too!\u201d Dan insisted indignantly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen y\u2019wear it <i>loads</i> on your channel!\u201d</p><p>Phil raised his eyebrows skeptically. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I wore it in, like, one video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um, may\u2019ve watched it a few times,\u201d Dan admitted, his eyes darting around the room shiftily.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Phil groaned, his hands shooting up to cover his face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that good of a video!\u201d</p><p>Feeling particularly brazen because of the alcohol coursing through his veins, Dan confessed the real reason he loved that video so much. \u201cI like watching it when \u2018m wearing this jumper.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a triumphant giggle when Phil\u2019s cheeks turned a dark red. </p><p>\u201cOh m\u2019god, <i>Dan</i>,\u201d Adaline whined as she marched across the room and over to Dan\u2019s bed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough of you gushing \u2018bout Phil, \u2018nd I don\u2019t need t\u2019hear you flirt with him on skype, too.\u201d She reached for his computer \u2014 for what, Dan wasn\u2019t sure. But he knew he didn\u2019t want to find out.</p><p>\u201cThen close y\u2019 ears,\u201d Dan grumbled, pulling his computer into his chest and away from Adaline.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no\u2019 how ears work.\u201d Adaline was just as drunk as Dan \u2014 if not drunker \u2014 but she managed to grab the computer of out Dan\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cHey!!!\u201d Dan protested and lunged for his computer a beat too late thanks to his alcohol-slowed reactions. Adaline had already moved to her bed, and without her weight to catch him, Dan fell to the floor of the narrow aisle between the beds. \u201cAdddddd<i>ieee</i>,\u201d he whined from the floor, staring up at his sister with wide, betrayed eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Adaline giggled, shaking her head and rolling her eyes to the camera. Dan watched in horror as she spun the computer around to face him and capture his humiliating position on the floor.</p><p>\u201cA cute idiot,\u201d Phil added. Even from down on the floor, Dan could see the smile on Phil\u2019s face and the twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\u201c<i>Gross</i>,\u201d Adaline groaned. \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 t\u2019bed. G\u2019night, Philip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d both Dan and Phil cried as she started to close the computer. </p><p>\u201cCan I say goodnight to Dan?\u201d Phil pleaded hopefully. </p><p>\u201cFine. Y\u2019get two minutes.\u201d Adaline dropped the computer off the bed and onto Dan\u2019s stomach without warning. </p><p>\u201c<i>Ooof</i>,\u201d Dan grunted as the computer landed on him heavily, nearly knocking the wind out of him. \u201cHi again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, you drunkard,\u201d Phil greeted with a smile. </p><p>\u201cRude,\u201d Dan pouted, unable to keep the smile off his face though. </p><p>\u201cWhen do you get home tomorrow?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cI think like three. Maybe four, I dunno.\u201d Dan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m taking Addie straight t\u2019 the train station when we get there, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Phil frowned.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019?\u201d Dan\u2019s brows furrowed and he moved his head closer to the screen, trying to figure out what was wrong with Phil.</p><p>\u201cI got called into work tomorrow evening,\u201d Phil explained.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he tried to think of why the BBC would want Phil to come in on a Monday. \u201cWhat does the BBC want?\u201d </p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cBeans and Grind, not the BBC,\u201d he corrected. \u201cEmmalee isn\u2019t feeling well so I\u2019m closing for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Dan\u2019s frown twisted into a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s easy, then. I\u2019ll try to come visit you.\u201d</p><p>A slow, matching smile spread onto Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes is up,\u201d Adaline called from above him. \u201cSay g\u2019bye to loverboy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight night, loverboy!\u201d Dan said eagerly with a dramatic wave to the camera. </p><p>A bright red blush spread across Phil\u2019s face. \u201cGoodnight, dear. I\u2019ll \u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t get to hear the rest of whatever Phil was saying, though, because Adaline leaned off the bed and slammed the laptop lid shut. </p><p>\u201cFuck you, sis,\u201d  Dan grumbled as he pushed himself off the floor.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed, bro,\u201d Adaline shot back.</p><p>******************************</p><p>On Monday afternoon, the shop was busier than normal. There was a large group of hipster uni students working on a group project \u2014 marketing, by the sounds of it \u2014 and every ten minutes, one of them would come up to the counter to order another pourover coffee (they refused to drink anything else, apparently), which was painstakingly slow to make, and prevented Phil from being able to do much else. He really wished they\u2019d all order at once so that he could make a larger batch. </p><p>Of course they didn\u2019t though, so Phil only had a few minutes of downtime between making each drink. He\u2019d brought his laptop to work with im, hoping that the shop would be slow enough that he could edit the collab that he\u2019d filmed with PJ over the weekend. So far, Phil had only had time to download the footage and import it into the program, though.</p><p>If he was going to be distracted from youtube work, Phil would have greatly preferred it to be because of Dan, not hipster uni students.</p><p>The truth was, working at Beans and Grind was starting to take up more time that Phil was able to dedicate to it. Over the past few weeks, he had cut back his hours pretty substantially, but it was still burdensome. He\u2019d originally taken the job for a little bit of financial security and so that he\u2019d have a way to make some new friends in London. But Phil didn\u2019t <i>need</i> extra money now \u2014 everything was going well with the BBC \u2014 and he\u2019d met enough people in London that he didn\u2019t feel so isolated anymore. </p><p>For a long time now, Phil had only kept the job because it was an easy excuse to see Dan. But their friendship had developed \u2014 and was teetering right on the edge of something <i>more</i> \u2014 and the need for the coffee shop had grown less and less until it was completely obsolete. Now, the only reason Phil kept the job was because of his friendship with Emmalee, and the knowledge that she struggled to find good help.</p><p>So here Phil was, working a shift that wasn\u2019t normally his, even though he had a video to edit and a boy he wanted to spend time with. </p><p>Phil hoped the group of hipsters left before Dan came so they could catch up in peace at least.</p><p>While Phil waited for the hipsters to leave, and Dan to arrive, Phil found himself growing distracted from working on his video, and watching a recap video of Dan\u2019s performance in Germany instead. The customers weren\u2019t paying him any attention, and Phil really didn\u2019t get a shit about their opinion of him, so he didn\u2019t even bother trying to hide the his earphones. </p><p>Just as Phil had expected, the new song \u2014 or snippet of a song, really, since it was only about a minute and a half long \u2014 was something Phil had heard before. It wasn\u2019t any of the songs Phil thought Dan might play, though. </p><p>No, it was the slow song, the one he\u2019d written the guitar part on skype with Phil during their first coproductive session. </p><p><i>\u201cThis song is really special to me,\u201d </i>Dan was saying in the video.<i> \u201cWriting it was really what inspired me to shape my new album around a concept.\u201d The crowd screamed loudly as Dan pulled up a wooden stool and took an acoustic guitar from a stagehand. \u201cI talked about it the other day on BBC Radio, but if any of you missed it, I\u2019m writing a concept album \u2014 it\u2019s centered around not liking what you have, about wanting something different, and, really, about just <b>going</b> for it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit different from my other stuff, but I hope you all like it.\u201d Dan smiled weakly, giving away just how nervous he was. \u201cThis song is about that middle part \u2014 wanting what you don\u2019t have.\u201d</i></p><p>Of course, Phil had heard the acoustic guitar portion of the song before, but Dan hadn\u2019t shared the lyrics with him yet. When Dan was originally writing the song, Phil hadn\u2019t known that Dan liked him \u2014 would never have even imagined that the song might be about, well, <i>him</i>.</p><p>But knowing that now, Phil suddenly understood why Dan had written <i>this</i> song when they were on skype together. That was well over a month ago, and Dan wasn\u2019t even here, but Phil felt his cheeks growing hot as he realized he\u2019d essentially been Dan\u2019s <i>muse</i> while writing this song. </p><p>Now Phil was getting the full experience though, and finally getting to hear the lyrics. Phil could hear the raw <i>want</i> that Dan was capturing with this song\u2026 And now that Phil knew the concept of this album and just how much it pertained to <i>him</i>\u2026</p><p>Well, now he was have trouble holding literal <i>tears </i>back. Based on the lyrics, it sounded like Dan was lusting after something and like he desperately wanted something he couldn\u2019t have. And, unbeknownst to the world, that something was <i>Phil</i>.</p><p>The song perfectly reflected how Phil felt at that time. Apparently Dan had felt exactly the same.</p><p>The last chords of the song had barely faded away before Phil restarted the clip and listened to it again and again and again. </p><p>He listened it it so many times over the course of the next hour that he\u2019d memorized the lyrics and could hum the melody from memory alone. </p><p>Phil absolutely loved it, and if this is what Dan\u2019s entire album was going to be like, Phil thought he was going to love it, too.</p><p>Afternoon faded into early evening. Much to Phil\u2019s displeasure, the hipsters were still there, and there was no sign of Dan. </p><p>Dejectedly, Phil wiped the counter down and willed Dan to come through the door, even though he\u2019d only promised to <i>try</i> to come by when he got home. The past three days felt like an eternity, though, and Phil <i>missed</i> Dan \u2014 far more than was probably reasonable for such a short period of time. </p><p>Three of the students packed up their laptops and messily discarded their dishes on the counter that Phil had <i>just</i> cleaned. Having to do and redo the same damn tasks back to back was Phil\u2019s <i>least </i>favorite part of the job. He moved the dishes to the sink and re-wet his washrag, not bothering to bid the customers a good day when he heard the door chime as they left. </p><p>Phil turned around to clean the counter for a second time, and was met with warm brown eyes, curly hair, and a wide smile. </p><p>\u201c<i>Dan</i>,\u201d Phil gasped, his lips turning up into a grin of his own. \u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d he added stupidly. The door hadn\u2019t chimed a second time; Dan must have slipped in while the hipsters were leaving. </p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Dan smiled. His eyes flicked over to the remaining customers. Phil\u2019s eyes followed Dan\u2019s gaze and he shrugged apathetically. </p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Dan suggested cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cDecaf or regular?\u201d Phil asked even as he grabbed a cup and stuck it beneath the espresso spout, anticipating Dan\u2019s answer.</p><p>\u201cRegular. You can make it a double instead of a triple, though.\u201d</p><p><i>Of course.</i> Phil shook his head in mock exasperation. \u201cYou do know that it\u2019s nearly six, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a long weekend and I\u2019m tired, let me live.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice was lower, scratchier, than normal, and Phil could see dark bags shining through what looked to be some sort of concealer under his eyes. Dan\u2019s trip to Germany had been short, and from both his texts and his instagram stories, it looked like he\u2019d been doing stuff nonstop. He was probably desperate to curl up in bed and do nothing \u2014 Phil would be anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou could go sleep if you want,\u201d Phil offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather talk to you.\u201d Dan winked. </p><p>Phil felt himself blush and funneled his energy into making Dan\u2019s espresso so that Dan wouldn\u2019t see how flustered he was. </p><p>The sun set, the remaining hipsters left, and Dan finished his coffee but didn\u2019t go home. Not long after arriving, he\u2019d pulled a stool over from the other end of the counter so that he could sit as close to Phil as possible. A small fire flickered in the fireplace, casting a warm glowing light onto the pair.</p><p>\u201cDid Adaline like Germany?\u201d Phil asked, leaning across the counter to shrink the distance between them even more.</p><p>\u201cShe <i>loved</i> it! She kept saying it was the best birthday present she\u2019d ever gotten.\u201d</p><p>As the evening wore on, Dan regaled Phil with stories from their trip, explaining the context of some of his instagram stories. Every tidbit Phil learned about Dan, about his relationship with his sister, about his eagerness to see the world and help people, made Phil like him <i>that much more</i>. </p><p>When his coffee was gone, Dan ordered a second one. It was a coffee that Phil thought Dan definitely didn\u2019t need since it was almost <i>eight</i> at this point, even if this one was decaf, but Dan was drinking it anyway. </p><p>\u201cAnyway, tell me more about your friend\u2019s visit,\u201d Dan said as he leaned in closer to Phil, looking particularly beautiful in the soft, flickering light of the fire. </p><p>\u201cWe filmed a couple of collabs, played a lot of board games, went out for a fancy dinner.\u201d Phil busied himself with wiping down the machines and stacking the dishes in the dishwasher. Talking about his weekend with PJ and Sophie without confessing how much time they had spent grilling him for information about his blossoming relationship with Dan was hard. </p><p>\u201cOooo, did you have good food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Phil huffed indignantly. \u201cWe got cheese fondue.\u201d</p><p>Dan cocked his head to the side, wrinkling his face up in confusion. \u201cBut you hate cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Phil cried, his voice coming out higher than normal. \u201cIt was awful, I basically just had bread and fruit for dinner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you go for that, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s  birthday \u2014 that\u2019s PJ\u2019s girlfriend \u2014 was back in February so we were having a belated celebration.\u201d Phil shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can make someone change their birthday restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I \u2014\u201d </p><p>Whatever Dan had been going to say was cut off by the door chime, which jarred them both out of the conversation. Instinctively, both Dan and Phil turned to look at the person entering.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan muttered under his breath as soon as he caught sight of them, swivelling back to Phil and resolutely turning his back on the door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Phil trailed off, eyes wide in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan confirmed. </p><p>Phil barely had time to utter a quiet <i>oh</i> before the high-pitched shrieking started.</p><p>\u201cI should have known I\u2019d find you here!\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was louder and more shrill than Phil had seen online. Her heels <i>clack clack clacked</i> as she made her way across the coffee shop, coming to a stop just behind Dan. In every picture that Phil had seen of this woman online, she\u2019d looked <i>immaculate</i>. But now that he was seeing her in person, she looked a little more <i>fake</i>. Phil could see just how much makeup was caked on her face, and there was no way that her nails were naturally that thick or long.  </p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you returned any of my calls?\u201d The woman aggressively snapped at Dan. </p><p>Dan shoved his coffee away from himself, but didn\u2019t turn to face the woman. If anything, he slumped even <i>further</i> forward, closing a bit more of the distance between Phil and him.</p><p>Phil could feel the wind from the sigh Dan exhaled, could see the subtle shake of his head and the lines forming around his eyes as he squeezed them tightly shut. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Izzy?\u201d Dan asked in a quiet, resigned voice. He sounded defeated, like he was still upset \u2014 maybe even hurt? Phil couldn\u2019t help wondering how Dan felt, couldn\u2019t help wishing that he could <i>ask</i>.</p><p>\u201cSo this is him,\u201d Isabella snapped. She was glaring daggers at the back of Dan\u2019s head. \u201cThe <i>cabr\u00f3n</i>.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to get Dan\u2019s attention; his back straightened and his already tense shoulders tightened even more. His eyes flew open and he stared at Phil in horror. </p><p>\u201cThis is who?\u201d he asked, his back still to Isabella. His tone was tense and came out more like a warning than anything else. </p><p>Isabella\u2019s eyes drifted to Phil, disdainfully raking up and down his body before settling on his face. The intense scrutiny \u2014 and her displeased expression\u2014 made Phil squirm awkwardly. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Phil, right?\u201d Isabella asked, not sounding like she really wanted an answer from Phil \u2014 or Dan for that matter. Phil flinched back, surprised by the derogatory tone she was using to talk about <i>him</i>; she didn\u2019t even <i>know</i> Phil.</p><p>Phil was <i>well aware</i> of the fact that Isabella and Dan didn\u2019t have the best of relationships, and had suspected that she was, well, kind of a bitch. And now that he was meeting her, now that he was hearing how she talked to Dan and seeing the way she looked at him, Phil suddenly felt like, if anything, he had <i>underestimated</i> how horrible she was. How <i>shitty</i> their relationship must have been at times. </p><p>How the <i>hell</i> had Dan managed to date her? Especially for almost a year.</p><p>\u201cIs this the fag who turned you into a full on homo?\u201d Her face was filled with disgust as she looked back and forth between Phil and Dan. Although Dan had sat up more rigidly, he was still <i>very</i> close to Phil \u2014 something Isabella was undoubtedly picking up on, and clearly not very happy about. </p><p>The comment seemed to be too much for Dan, though, because he forcefully stood up, finally spinning around to face Isabella. Phil caught sight of the angry glare on Dan\u2019s face before his back was fully to him.</p><p>\u201cLeave Phil out of this, Isabella,\u201d Dan ordered. </p><p>If Phil had felt awkward before, he was downright <i>uncomfortable</i> now. He wasn\u2019t particularly enjoying the way Isabella was talking about him as if he wasn\u2019t in the room. Whatever this fight was, Phil didn\u2019t want to be a part of it \u2014 and it sounded like Dan wanted Isabella to focus on something else, too. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to ask this one more time,\u201d Dan continued tersely. \u201c<i>What do you want?</i>\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes shifted from Dan to Isabella. Her hands were crossed in front of her chest, one hip popped out. </p><p>\u201cI want to get back together,\u201d she said, voice clipped, as if it were obvious. </p><p>From what Phil could tell, she actually looked serious, too. How the hell could she think that was a reasonable request? She\u2019d <i>cheated</i> on Dan!</p><p>Dan laughed, but it was a bitter chuckle, not the boisterous happy laugh Phil was accustomed to hearing. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he retorted harshly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Is it because of him?\u201d Isabella nodded her head towards Phil, who was still frozen in shock behind the counter. God, he <i>really</i> didn\u2019t want to witness this.</p><p>\u201cLook, can we talk about this in private?\u201d Dan gestured outside. </p><p>Isabella scoffed. \u201cIf you wanted to talk <i>in private,</i> you should have answered my phone calls. Now tell me, is it or is it not because of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it fucking matter?\u201d Dan spat. \u201cI don\u2019t love you, why the <i>hell</i> would I get back together with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d If Phil wasn\u2019t mistaken, Isabella sounded <i>hurt</i>, like she was <i>begging</i> Dan to not deny loving her. Phil wasn\u2019t sure what right she had to make such a request.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say whatever the hell I want, Izzy,\u201d Dan barked, rubbing his hands roughly down his face with an aggravated sigh. \u201cI <i>never</i> fucking loved you. I was too caught up in my fucking job to realize how shitty of a girlfriend you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! We were happy.\u201d Isabella\u2019s scornful eyes flickered back over to Phil, and he found himself automatically taking a few steps backwards. \u201cOr at least we were before <i>someone</i> came into the picture. Now fucking tell me, is <i>he</i> the reason you broke up with me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you forgetting the part where you <i>cheated</i> on me?\u201d Dan cried, sounding scandalized. \u201cOr the part where you fucking <i>used </i>me for <i>months</i>?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh. </i>That was new. Phil had no idea exactly what Dan meant by being <i>used</i>, but he could imagine \u2014 and everything he thought of was horrible. </p><p> \u201cI didn\u2019t <i>use</i> you, Danny,\u201d she argued, looking pissed off Dan would even suggest such a thing. </p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Dan sneered.</p><p>Isabella took a menacing step forward. \u201cWhatever. But you didn\u2019t answer my question about this <i>cabr\u00f3n</i>.\u201d Her voice was as harsh and sharp as the sound of her heels <i>clack clacking</i> with the movement. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a question worth answering.\u201d</p><p>Isabella scoffed. \u201cI should have known when you told me you liked guys you\u2019d dump me for one eventually.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise. What kind of biphobic bullshit was <i>that</i>? </p><p>Anger was practically <i>radiating</i> off Dan and the tension in the coffee shop felt thick enough to cut with a knife. Dan\u2019s hands stopped tapping against his thighs, and instead clamped into tight fists by his sides. Phil took a small step backwards towards the backroom, preparing to flee if things got any more heated.</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit, not <i>this</i> again.\u201d Dan glanced over his shoulder, sending Phil an apologetic look \u2014 for what, Phil wasn\u2019t sure. It\u2019s not like Dan could control the crap coming out of Isabella\u2019s mouth. \u201cFirst of fucking all, I told you I\u2019m <i>bi</i>sexual. That means I like boys <i>and</i> girls. It\u2019s not that hard of a fucking concept. Do you realize how offensive it is to accuse me of breaking up with you because you\u2019re not a guy, even though I like girls, too? <i>Bisexuality is a real fucking thing, Izzy</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hands unclenched, only to reach up and pull at his hair. \u201cSecond of fucking all, I broke up with you because you\u2019re a manipulative, cheating <i>bitch,</i> and were using me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only cheated on you because you stopped sleeping with me!\u201d Isabella argued. Something about the way she said it made Phil think she truly believed it was a legitimate excuse. </p><p>Phil sort of knew that Dan had stopped sleeping with her \u2014 although Phil wasn\u2019t exactly sure <i>when</i>.  Still, he couldn\u2019t help but take a <i>little</i> bit of satisfaction in that. Phil <i>hated</i> imagining Dan sleeping with someone else, someone that wasn\u2019t <i>him</i>, even though he knew most of Dan and Isabella\u2019s relationship was based on, well, physical <i>affection.</i></p><p>\u201cOh fuck off,\u201d Dan scoffed. \u201cUs not having sex anymore doesn\u2019t excuse you <i>fucking</i> those guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to tell me there was nothing going on with this <i>pendejo</i>?\u201d Isabella looked at Phil again. He didn\u2019t know spanish, didn\u2019t know what <i>pendejo</i> meant, but from the tone of her voice \u2014 and the hateful look on her face \u2014 Phil knew it wasn\u2019t flattering. \u201cYou can\u2019t really tell me you\u2019re any better than me! Is he the reason you stopped sleeping with me? Because you were fucking him instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI <i>never</i> would have cheated on you, and you know that!\u201d Dan shot back, enraged.</p><p>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d Isabella bit out. \u201cAre you with him now? Cause the media seems to think you are and I\u2019m inclined to believe it. Why else would you refuse me!?\u201d Isabella gestured toward herself as if she really couldn\u2019t understand </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your fucking business!\u201d Dan practically growled. He moved towards Isabella \u2014 a move that definitely would have intimated Phil if he was standing in Isabella\u2019s tall, pointy heels. \u201cYou and I are over. The end. Now get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>For a minute, Phil wasn\u2019t sure <i>what</i> Isabella was going to do. She was fuming, her face hard and her body tense. From what Phil had seen so far, Isabella had one <i>hell</i> of a temper and the fury etched in her body made him worry that it might escalate even more. </p><p>She was frozen like that for nearly a full minute, but eventually she turned around and made for the door. The echo of her heels on the floor was loud in the tense silence of the coffee shop. </p><p>She only made it halfway there before she turned back around and charged back to the counter, coming to a stop just in front of Dan. She was closer than before, close enough that Phil could smell her sickeningly sweet perfume. Her hand reached out to grab Dan\u2019s, but he pulled back. </p><p>The anger seemed to have dissipated, and was instead replaced with a sad, pitiful look.</p><p>\u201cWe were on a good path, Danny!\u201d She was pleading now. If Phil could stand her, he\u2019d probably feel embarrassed for her. \u201cThe media loved us, your fans loved us! I <i>miss </i>you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you miss the media and the fan attention, not me.\u201d Dan laughed coldly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice that the media has hardly been paying attention to you now that you\u2019re not <i>Dan Howell\u2019s Girlfriend</i>.\u201d </p><p>Isabella huffed, and the rage from earlier flickered in her eyes again. Phil genuinely expected her to retaliate.</p><p>But she took a few deep breaths and her shoulders deliberately relaxed as she stuck to her attempts to be sweet, maybe even <i>loving</i>. \u201cOf <i>course </i>I miss <i>you</i>.\u201d Isabella\u2019s eyes were wide and full of what Phil was sure was supposed to be innocence. \u201cI miss every single part of you, Danny.\u201d</p><p>Phil fought back a gag \u2014 he was pretty sure he knew what <i>that</i> meant, and the implication of it didn\u2019t sit well with him. </p><p>Maybe Phil\u2019s reaction, or Dan\u2019s silence, spurred her on, because Isabella continued talking. \u201cI miss spending time with you, I miss the way you used to hold me, and touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell too fucking bad,\u201d Dan said flippantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Isabella roared.</p><p>\u201cIt means I don\u2019t want to ever fucking touch you again,\u201d Dan spat.</p><p>Isabella stepped closer, anger creeping back onto her face. \u201cI think you need a reminder of what you\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t have time to prepare himself for what happened \u2014 and he doubted Dan did either.</p><p>Isabella launched herself forward, colliding with Dan and pressing her lips to his. </p><p>How fucking <i>dare</i> she? Phil\u2019s blood positively <i>boiled</i>. He <i>never</i> wanted to see Dan kiss someone else and now he was forced to stand here and watch Isabella glue her lips to Dan\u2019s. Isabella had <i>no</i> right to force herself on Dan, to kiss him when he didn\u2019t belong to her anymore. </p><p>Phil hadn\u2019t even had the opportunity to kiss Dan yet, but he still felt <i>so possessive</i> over him. </p><p>Dan was frozen for a split second, completely rigid and not moving. It felt like time stood still as Isabella insistently pressed her lips to a completely immobile Dan, and all Phil could do was <i>stare.</i></p><p>Something snapped in Dan, though, and Phil watched Dan\u2019s hands come up and land on her shoulders, forcefully pushing her away without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i> is wrong with you?\u201d Dan shouted. \u201cYou have <i>no</i> right to kiss me. Get out of my fucking face <i>right fucking now</i>,\u201d Dan seethed. </p><p>Isabella recoiled from Dan\u2019s touch, flinching back and stumbling on her tall heels. She looked shocked, and the hurt and rage were both back in full force. In fact, she looked more livid, more crazed, than she had thus far. </p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Isabella screeched, her voice full of venom. \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, Dan Howell!\u201d </p><p>Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel sharply and marched towards the door.</p><p>\u201cUnlikely!\u201d Dan roared after her, almost laughing as she stormed out the door.</p><p>Once Isabella was gone, the coffee shop fell into silence except for the sound of Dan\u2019s heavy breathing. Phil wasn\u2019t sure what to say, wasn\u2019t sure what to do. He felt like a lot of information \u2014 information he wasn\u2019t sure he was supposed to have \u2014 had just been dropped on him, and he didn\u2019t know what to do with it.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t Phil\u2019s battle, and Isabella was nothing but his almost-boyfriend\u2019s ex-girlfriend, but he was <i>pissed</i>. Pissed about the degrading way Isabella had talked about <i>both</i> of their sexualities. Pissed about the fact that Isabella kissed Dan without his consent. Pissed about Isabella\u2019s attempts to justify her cheating and get Dan back.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t even <i>begin</i> to fathom how Dan was feeling right now.</p><p>It took almost a full minute, but Dan\u2019s breathing eventually returned to normal, and he turned around, collapsing back on his stool.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Phil murmured when Dan looked up at him. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA giant fucking shitshow?\u201d Dan raised his eyebrows and smiled humorously.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to say \u2018unfair\u2019, but yeah, that works too.\u201d Phil offered Dan what he hoped was a reassuring smile. Phil <i>desperately</i> wanted to reach out and hold Dan\u2019s hand, run his fingers through Dan\u2019s hair. Something. <i>Anything</i>. </p><p>But Phil was hyper aware of the fact that they were in public \u2014 and that Isabella could come back in at any second \u2014 so he kept his hands to himself.</p><p>\u201cSorry you had to see that,\u201d Dan said, sounding genuinely apologetic. </p><p>After all of <i>that</i>, how could Dan\u2019s first reaction be to apologize to Phil? </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always been too dramatic for her own good,\u201d Dan continued. \u201cThank fuck there wasn\u2019t anyone else here today. But still, I\u2019m sorry you got roped into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Phil insisted, unable to understand why Dan was feeling guilty; there was nothing he could have done to stop it. Hell, Dan had tried to stop Isabella multiple times and she\u2019d just <i>kept going</i>. </p><p>Dan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI mean, it sort of is. She\u2019s not, like, entirely wrong.\u201d He averted his eyes. </p><p>Phil didn\u2019t know what to say, and wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure which accusations Dan seemed to think Isabella had some grounds to make. He wanted to ask, he wanted to <i>push</i>. </p><p>But then again, after learning about Dan\u2019s album, and hearing the lyrics to the song he\u2019d written, Phil was fairly certain he could guess which accusation held some truth. </p><p>\u201cThanks for the coffee,\u201d Dan muttered, looking back at Phil, \u201cBut I think I\u2019m going to go home and have something a bit stronger.\u201d Shifting off of his stool, Dan went to walk away. </p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t ready for him to go yet, though. </p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Phil said, grabbing Dan\u2019s arm before he could pull completely away. \u201cLet me buy you a drink. You can rant all you want to me if you feel like it.\u201d Phil realized that Dan might want to drop it and focus on something happier, so he softly added, \u201cOr not talk about it. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have, like, work?\u201d Dan asked, gesturing around the coffeeshop.</p><p>Phil glanced at the clock. </p><p>\u201cEh, we\u2019re set to close in half an hour and it\u2019s been dead since those kids left.\u201d Phil shrugged with his free arm. \u201cI think we can afford to close early for one night.\u201d What Emmalee didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes flickered down to his arm, which Phil was still holding onto. After only a moment\u2019s hesitation, he nodded slowly. \u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah, okay. That sounds good.\u201d A shy smile grew on his face.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips twitched up into a small smile, relieved that Dan wanted to spend time with him despite still looking riled up from the fight. \u201cI need like ten minutes to close up. Why don\u2019t you grab a warmer coat in the meantime and then we can go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d Dan smiled. \u201cWanna just meet me upstairs when you\u2019re done? Maybe we can, um, have a drink at mine or something before we go out?\u201d</p><p>Without his consent, Phil\u2019s eyebrows shot up, betraying his surprise that Dan was <i>inviting him up to his apartment.</i></p><p>Phil wanted that though. He <i>really</i> wanted that.</p><p>\u201cA drink at yours sounds great,\u201d Phil agreed. A drink, a cuddle, a kiss. Whatever. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dan said with a note of finality. \u201cIt\u2019s the building right next door. I\u2019m in apartment 701. I\u2019ll tell the doorman to let you in.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, that works,\u201d Phil smiled softly. </p><p>Dan grinned back, lingering for moment before grabbing his light jacket. He pulled it on, not bothering to zip it up, and smiled \u2014 a smile that was filled with excitement and anxiety. </p><p>\u201cSee you soon, Philly.\u201d Dan gave Phil a two-fingered salute and ducked out the door.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t waste any time in rinsing out Dan\u2019s mug and adding it to the dishwasher. The counters were clean, but he\u2019d never gotten around to wiping down the table that the uni students were at earlier. He grabbed a rag and the keys, planning to lock the door just in case anyone came. </p><p>Unfortunately, a customer walked in before Phil could make it to the door.</p><p>\u201cHi, welcome! We\u2019re closing in ten minutes, so it\u2019s to-go orders only now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cGreat! What can I get for you?\u201d Phil asked, not so subtly trying to hurry her along. Unfortunately for him, the lady was looking straight at the menu, and didn\u2019t even seem to be aware of Phil. Phil\u2019s heart sank. That didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I need just a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem! Just let me know when you\u2019re ready!\u201d Phil said in as chipper of a voice as he could manage and smiled a wide, fake grin despite the fact that he was very, <i>very</i> much annoyed.</p><p>Grabbing his phone, Phil hid it below the counter, and quickly texted Dan.</p><p><i>Sorry a customer just walked in so I might be a little bit longer. I told her we are only doing to-go orders though, so it shouldn\u2019t be that long.</i></p><p>Almost immediately, his phone lit up with a reply.</p><p><i>dw take your time</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have a toasted crumpet, please,\u201d the lady finally said a moment later, thankfully quicker than Phil had honestly been expecting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be right up!\u201d Phil replied quickly, and took the last crumpet from the display case in order to drop it in the toaster. Mentally, Phil urged the toaster to cook faster.</p><p>While the woman\u2019s order heated up, Phil glanced back at his phone and saw another message from Dan.</p><p><i>not too long though plz</i></p><p> Phil couldn\u2019t help the wide grin that spread across his face in response, because it was clear that Dan was just as impatient for <i>whatever</i> was about to happen as Phil was.</p><hr><p><b>a/n: </b>come scream at me! i will wait to post asks with spoilers for 24 hours though :)\u00a0</p>",

It\u2019s quiet, it\u2019s quaint, it\u2019s near his home. Most importantly: none of the employees give a shit that\u2019s he a world-famous singer.

He\u2019d done his best to behave himself in public all day, but it was night now, and he was back in the safety of his hotel room, and he didn\u2019t care anymore. </p><p>He stumbled over to one of the beds \u2014 the one closest to the bathroom that he <i>always </i>insisted on sleeping in \u2014 and pulled his laptop into his lap. Adaline followed behind him, padlocking the door and making her way to the other side of the room. </p><p>They were sharing a standard two bed hotel room, although they could have probably been upgraded to a suite if Dan had just asked the host of the concert. All of Dan\u2019s expenses were coming out of the charity money, though, so he was determined to use as little of the funds as possible. </p><p>Unfortunately for Adaline, that meant that instead of having her own room, she was forced to suffer through Dan\u2019s antics \u2014 something that Dan distantly realized was probably particularly painful right now. </p><p>\u201cNo, you stupid piece of <i>trash</i>,\u201d Dan muttered when the computer screen shook and informed him that he had the incorrect password. Dan punched each letter of his password into his keyboard forcefully.</p><p>The fucking computer just wasn\u2019t cooperating though. The screen shook and gave him an error message <i>again.</i> Dan entered his password a third time, this time saying the letters out loud as he entered them to make sure he typed it correctly.  \u201c<i>C-o-l-l-i-n-2-0-1-4.</i>\u201d</p><p>The login screen faded and his homescreen \u2014 a picture of him and Darcy smushed cheek to cheek \u2014 loaded. Dan glanced up, and saw that across the room Addie was drunkenly trying to wipe her makeup off. So far it looked like she\u2019d just manage to give herself dark raccoon eyes.</p><p>Dan opened skype, determined to talk to Phil tonight. Since the radio show, they\u2019d only been able to text and Dan missed his boyfr\u2014 <i>Phil\u2019s</i> face. They\u2019d been <i>so fucking close</i> to kissing on that night, and a small part of Dan wished he\u2019d thrown caution into the wind and said fuck the glass wall, fuck privacy, fuck everything, and just kissed him. But in a way, Dan was also grateful to Addie\u2019s phone call for stopping Dan from being <i>too</i> reckless. </p><p>Dan had worried that things might be weird between them, but the only change was that their texts had become impossibly flirtier since then.</p><p>When skype loaded, Dan didn\u2019t hesitate to click on Phil\u2019s name. He didn\u2019t even bother to check if there was a blue <i>online</i> dot next to Phil\u2019s name, he just aggressively smashed the button and watched the little <i>bloop bloop bloop </i>light up as it called Phil. </p><p>The skype ringtone rang <i>once</i>, <i>twice</i>, before Phil answered.</p><p>\u201cHi, Philly!\u201d Dan shrieked cheerfully when a grainy Phil loaded on his screen.</p><p>The Phil that Dan <i>could</i> see on skype looked soft, cozy, and tired. \u201cHi, Dan,\u201d Phil mumbled back, much sleepier. \u201cHow are you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Dan responded, definitely a little too loudly if the way both Phil and Adaline jumped was anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Phil nodded \u2014 or tried to, at least. He was laying in bed, his cheek resting on his blue-and-green checkered pillow.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019look tired.\u201d Dan frowned slightly as the skype call got clearer and he was able to take in the way Phil\u2019s eyelids looked heavy, and the fact that his voice was laced with croakiness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after two in the morning here, I was asleep,\u201d Phil said, rolling his eyes. He didn\u2019t sound upset though.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dan\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cWhy were ya on skype?\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s cheeks flushed, and for a moment, Dan wasn\u2019t sure why. Not until Phil explained, anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re out of town and I missed you, so, um, just in case, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Flattered, Dan bashfully buried his face in his hands and shook his head as he regained his composure. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d he mumbled into his palms. When he could look Phil in the eye again, Dan looked back up, a wide grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat did y\u2019do this weekend?\u201d Dan slurred, his smile never faltering. He leaned forward, resting his elbow on his knee and his chin in his hand.</p><p>\u201cPJ and his girlfriend came up to visit, which was good.\u201d Phil smiled softly, rubbing at his eyes sleepily. The screen turned into a pixelated blur of movement. When skype focused again, Phil was propped up against his headboard. His quiff was messy and his thick black frames were sitting crooked on his face. \u201cTell me about your night, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAds and I went out for beer an\u2019 did a lil\u2019 walking tour on our way back.\u201d Dan precariously leaned off the bed as he reached for the water bottle on the bedside table. </p><p>\u201cMmmmh,\u201d Phil hummed. \u201cI saw.\u201d</p><p>Dan shot back upright, launching himself into the frame. \u201cYa\u2019 did?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil confirmed, looking confused by Dan\u2019s reaction. \u201cI saw your instagram story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Dan murmured, more to himself than Phil. He didn\u2019t <i>quite</i> remember posting anything to instagram, but now that Phil mentioned it, he sort of remembered him and Adaline taking a lot of pictures on their way home. Were those instagram pictures? Dan grabbed his phone from the pillow, pressing his finger to the home button over and over, causing the screen to shake in protest. \u201cM\u2019phone won\u2019t unlock,\u201d he pouted at Phil.</p><p>\u201cType your passcode, then, you silly goose,\u201d Phil teased. </p><p>Dan dropped his phone back onto the bed. \u201cI\u2019m lazy. What\u2019d I post?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing big,\u201d Phil smiled. \u201cJust a few pictures of beer and you guys at some tourist spots.\u201d Phil\u2019s eyebrows rose skeptically. \u201cWhy, did something happen you didn\u2019t want the internet to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWah\u2019?\u201d Dan stammered. \u201cI - uh, well. We talked some.\u201d Dan had blurry memories of nearly shouting about how much he liked Phil Lester on the way home and it\u2019d be just his luck to film some monument during one of his speeches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all just pictures.\u201d Phil assured him. \u201cNo talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Dan smiled dopily.</p><p>Dan watched Phil\u2019s eyes rake up and down the screen and barely resisted the urge to slap his hand over the webcam. He couldn\u2019t handle being under Phil\u2019s scrutiny like that \u2014 not when he couldn\u2019t do something about it. Especially since that <i>something</i> was right on the verge of happening. \u201cI like your outfit tonight, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2019did?\u201d Dan asked, looking down at himself. \u201c<i>Oh</i>,\u201d he murmured. Dan vaguely felt his cheeks burn, so he grabbed the collar of his jumper and tugged it over the bottom half of his face. \u201cAre y\u2019mad?\u201d Dan asked timidly.</p><p>On the screen, Phil blinked back at Dan blankly. \u201cMad?\u201d </p><p>Dan fiddled with the hem of the <i>Pugs Not Drugs</i> jumper. \u201cY\u2019know, that I still have your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Phil shook his head, and for a long second, Dan was worried that Phil <i>was</i> upset with him. \u201cIt looks better on you, anyway.\u201d </p><p>The blush on Dan\u2019s face deepened, and he pulled the sweatshirt even further up, so that the collar was completely covering his head. \u201cThat\u2019s n\u2019 true,\u201d he muttered petulantly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Phil laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even seen me wear it.\u201d</p><p>Dan yanked the collar down again so he could see Phil again. \u201cI have too!\u201d Dan insisted indignantly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen y\u2019wear it <i>loads</i> on your channel!\u201d</p><p>Phil raised his eyebrows skeptically. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I wore it in, like, one video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um, may\u2019ve watched it a few times,\u201d Dan admitted, his eyes darting around the room shiftily.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Phil groaned, his hands shooting up to cover his face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that good of a video!\u201d</p><p>Feeling particularly brazen because of the alcohol coursing through his veins, Dan confessed the real reason he loved that video so much. \u201cI like watching it when \u2018m wearing this jumper.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a triumphant giggle when Phil\u2019s cheeks turned a dark red. </p><p>\u201cOh m\u2019god, <i>Dan</i>,\u201d Adaline whined as she marched across the room and over to Dan\u2019s bed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough of you gushing \u2018bout Phil, \u2018nd I don\u2019t need t\u2019hear you flirt with him on skype, too.\u201d She reached for his computer \u2014 for what, Dan wasn\u2019t sure. But he knew he didn\u2019t want to find out.</p><p>\u201cThen close y\u2019 ears,\u201d Dan grumbled, pulling his computer into his chest and away from Adaline.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no\u2019 how ears work.\u201d Adaline was just as drunk as Dan \u2014 if not drunker \u2014 but she managed to grab the computer of out Dan\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cHey!!!\u201d Dan protested and lunged for his computer a beat too late thanks to his alcohol-slowed reactions. Adaline had already moved to her bed, and without her weight to catch him, Dan fell to the floor of the narrow aisle between the beds. \u201cAdddddd<i>ieee</i>,\u201d he whined from the floor, staring up at his sister with wide, betrayed eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Adaline giggled, shaking her head and rolling her eyes to the camera. Dan watched in horror as she spun the computer around to face him and capture his humiliating position on the floor.</p><p>\u201cA cute idiot,\u201d Phil added. Even from down on the floor, Dan could see the smile on Phil\u2019s face and the twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\u201c<i>Gross</i>,\u201d Adaline groaned. \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 t\u2019bed. G\u2019night, Philip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d both Dan and Phil cried as she started to close the computer. </p><p>\u201cCan I say goodnight to Dan?\u201d Phil pleaded hopefully. </p><p>\u201cFine. Y\u2019get two minutes.\u201d Adaline dropped the computer off the bed and onto Dan\u2019s stomach without warning. </p><p>\u201c<i>Ooof</i>,\u201d Dan grunted as the computer landed on him heavily, nearly knocking the wind out of him. \u201cHi again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, you drunkard,\u201d Phil greeted with a smile. </p><p>\u201cRude,\u201d Dan pouted, unable to keep the smile off his face though. </p><p>\u201cWhen do you get home tomorrow?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cI think like three. Maybe four, I dunno.\u201d Dan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m taking Addie straight t\u2019 the train station when we get there, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Phil frowned.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019?\u201d Dan\u2019s brows furrowed and he moved his head closer to the screen, trying to figure out what was wrong with Phil.</p><p>\u201cI got called into work tomorrow evening,\u201d Phil explained.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he tried to think of why the BBC would want Phil to come in on a Monday. \u201cWhat does the BBC want?\u201d </p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cBeans and Grind, not the BBC,\u201d he corrected. \u201cEmmalee isn\u2019t feeling well so I\u2019m closing for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Dan\u2019s frown twisted into a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s easy, then. I\u2019ll try to come visit you.\u201d</p><p>A slow, matching smile spread onto Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes is up,\u201d Adaline called from above him. \u201cSay g\u2019bye to loverboy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight night, loverboy!\u201d Dan said eagerly with a dramatic wave to the camera. </p><p>A bright red blush spread across Phil\u2019s face. \u201cGoodnight, dear. I\u2019ll \u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t get to hear the rest of whatever Phil was saying, though, because Adaline leaned off the bed and slammed the laptop lid shut. </p><p>\u201cFuck you, sis,\u201d  Dan grumbled as he pushed himself off the floor.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed, bro,\u201d Adaline shot back.</p><p>******************************</p><p>On Monday afternoon, the shop was busier than normal. There was a large group of hipster uni students working on a group project \u2014 marketing, by the sounds of it \u2014 and every ten minutes, one of them would come up to the counter to order another pourover coffee (they refused to drink anything else, apparently), which was painstakingly slow to make, and prevented Phil from being able to do much else. He really wished they\u2019d all order at once so that he could make a larger batch. </p><p>Of course they didn\u2019t though, so Phil only had a few minutes of downtime between making each drink. He\u2019d brought his laptop to work with im, hoping that the shop would be slow enough that he could edit the collab that he\u2019d filmed with PJ over the weekend. So far, Phil had only had time to download the footage and import it into the program, though.</p><p>If he was going to be distracted from youtube work, Phil would have greatly preferred it to be because of Dan, not hipster uni students.</p><p>The truth was, working at Beans and Grind was starting to take up more time that Phil was able to dedicate to it. Over the past few weeks, he had cut back his hours pretty substantially, but it was still burdensome. He\u2019d originally taken the job for a little bit of financial security and so that he\u2019d have a way to make some new friends in London. But Phil didn\u2019t <i>need</i> extra money now \u2014 everything was going well with the BBC \u2014 and he\u2019d met enough people in London that he didn\u2019t feel so isolated anymore. </p><p>For a long time now, Phil had only kept the job because it was an easy excuse to see Dan. But their friendship had developed \u2014 and was teetering right on the edge of something <i>more</i> \u2014 and the need for the coffee shop had grown less and less until it was completely obsolete. Now, the only reason Phil kept the job was because of his friendship with Emmalee, and the knowledge that she struggled to find good help.</p><p>So here Phil was, working a shift that wasn\u2019t normally his, even though he had a video to edit and a boy he wanted to spend time with. </p><p>Phil hoped the group of hipsters left before Dan came so they could catch up in peace at least.</p><p>While Phil waited for the hipsters to leave, and Dan to arrive, Phil found himself growing distracted from working on his video, and watching a recap video of Dan\u2019s performance in Germany instead. The customers weren\u2019t paying him any attention, and Phil really didn\u2019t get a shit about their opinion of him, so he didn\u2019t even bother trying to hide the his earphones. </p><p>Just as Phil had expected, the new song \u2014 or snippet of a song, really, since it was only about a minute and a half long \u2014 was something Phil had heard before. It wasn\u2019t any of the songs Phil thought Dan might play, though. </p><p>No, it was the slow song, the one he\u2019d written the guitar part on skype with Phil during their first coproductive session. </p><p><i>\u201cThis song is really special to me,\u201d </i>Dan was saying in the video.<i> \u201cWriting it was really what inspired me to shape my new album around a concept.\u201d The crowd screamed loudly as Dan pulled up a wooden stool and took an acoustic guitar from a stagehand. \u201cI talked about it the other day on BBC Radio, but if any of you missed it, I\u2019m writing a concept album \u2014 it\u2019s centered around not liking what you have, about wanting something different, and, really, about just <b>going</b> for it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit different from my other stuff, but I hope you all like it.\u201d Dan smiled weakly, giving away just how nervous he was. \u201cThis song is about that middle part \u2014 wanting what you don\u2019t have.\u201d</i></p><p>Of course, Phil had heard the acoustic guitar portion of the song before, but Dan hadn\u2019t shared the lyrics with him yet. When Dan was originally writing the song, Phil hadn\u2019t known that Dan liked him \u2014 would never have even imagined that the song might be about, well, <i>him</i>.</p><p>But knowing that now, Phil suddenly understood why Dan had written <i>this</i> song when they were on skype together. That was well over a month ago, and Dan wasn\u2019t even here, but Phil felt his cheeks growing hot as he realized he\u2019d essentially been Dan\u2019s <i>muse</i> while writing this song. </p><p>Now Phil was getting the full experience though, and finally getting to hear the lyrics. Phil could hear the raw <i>want</i> that Dan was capturing with this song\u2026 And now that Phil knew the concept of this album and just how much it pertained to <i>him</i>\u2026</p><p>Well, now he was have trouble holding literal <i>tears </i>back. Based on the lyrics, it sounded like Dan was lusting after something and like he desperately wanted something he couldn\u2019t have. And, unbeknownst to the world, that something was <i>Phil</i>.</p><p>The song perfectly reflected how Phil felt at that time. Apparently Dan had felt exactly the same.</p><p>The last chords of the song had barely faded away before Phil restarted the clip and listened to it again and again and again. </p><p>He listened it it so many times over the course of the next hour that he\u2019d memorized the lyrics and could hum the melody from memory alone. </p><p>Phil absolutely loved it, and if this is what Dan\u2019s entire album was going to be like, Phil thought he was going to love it, too.</p><p>Afternoon faded into early evening. Much to Phil\u2019s displeasure, the hipsters were still there, and there was no sign of Dan. </p><p>Dejectedly, Phil wiped the counter down and willed Dan to come through the door, even though he\u2019d only promised to <i>try</i> to come by when he got home. The past three days felt like an eternity, though, and Phil <i>missed</i> Dan \u2014 far more than was probably reasonable for such a short period of time. </p><p>Three of the students packed up their laptops and messily discarded their dishes on the counter that Phil had <i>just</i> cleaned. Having to do and redo the same damn tasks back to back was Phil\u2019s <i>least </i>favorite part of the job. He moved the dishes to the sink and re-wet his washrag, not bothering to bid the customers a good day when he heard the door chime as they left. </p><p>Phil turned around to clean the counter for a second time, and was met with warm brown eyes, curly hair, and a wide smile. </p><p>\u201c<i>Dan</i>,\u201d Phil gasped, his lips turning up into a grin of his own. \u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d he added stupidly. The door hadn\u2019t chimed a second time; Dan must have slipped in while the hipsters were leaving. </p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Dan smiled. His eyes flicked over to the remaining customers. Phil\u2019s eyes followed Dan\u2019s gaze and he shrugged apathetically. </p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Dan suggested cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cDecaf or regular?\u201d Phil asked even as he grabbed a cup and stuck it beneath the espresso spout, anticipating Dan\u2019s answer.</p><p>\u201cRegular. You can make it a double instead of a triple, though.\u201d</p><p><i>Of course.</i> Phil shook his head in mock exasperation. \u201cYou do know that it\u2019s nearly six, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a long weekend and I\u2019m tired, let me live.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice was lower, scratchier, than normal, and Phil could see dark bags shining through what looked to be some sort of concealer under his eyes. Dan\u2019s trip to Germany had been short, and from both his texts and his instagram stories, it looked like he\u2019d been doing stuff nonstop. He was probably desperate to curl up in bed and do nothing \u2014 Phil would be anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou could go sleep if you want,\u201d Phil offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather talk to you.\u201d Dan winked. </p><p>Phil felt himself blush and funneled his energy into making Dan\u2019s espresso so that Dan wouldn\u2019t see how flustered he was. </p><p>The sun set, the remaining hipsters left, and Dan finished his coffee but didn\u2019t go home. Not long after arriving, he\u2019d pulled a stool over from the other end of the counter so that he could sit as close to Phil as possible. A small fire flickered in the fireplace, casting a warm glowing light onto the pair.</p><p>\u201cDid Adaline like Germany?\u201d Phil asked, leaning across the counter to shrink the distance between them even more.</p><p>\u201cShe <i>loved</i> it! She kept saying it was the best birthday present she\u2019d ever gotten.\u201d</p><p>As the evening wore on, Dan regaled Phil with stories from their trip, explaining the context of some of his instagram stories. Every tidbit Phil learned about Dan, about his relationship with his sister, about his eagerness to see the world and help people, made Phil like him <i>that much more</i>. </p><p>When his coffee was gone, Dan ordered a second one. It was a coffee that Phil thought Dan definitely didn\u2019t need since it was almost <i>eight</i> at this point, even if this one was decaf, but Dan was drinking it anyway. </p><p>\u201cAnyway, tell me more about your friend\u2019s visit,\u201d Dan said as he leaned in closer to Phil, looking particularly beautiful in the soft, flickering light of the fire. </p><p>\u201cWe filmed a couple of collabs, played a lot of board games, went out for a fancy dinner.\u201d Phil busied himself with wiping down the machines and stacking the dishes in the dishwasher. Talking about his weekend with PJ and Sophie without confessing how much time they had spent grilling him for information about his blossoming relationship with Dan was hard. </p><p>\u201cOooo, did you have good food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Phil huffed indignantly. \u201cWe got cheese fondue.\u201d</p><p>Dan cocked his head to the side, wrinkling his face up in confusion. \u201cBut you hate cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Phil cried, his voice coming out higher than normal. \u201cIt was awful, I basically just had bread and fruit for dinner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you go for that, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s  birthday \u2014 that\u2019s PJ\u2019s girlfriend \u2014 was back in February so we were having a belated celebration.\u201d Phil shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can make someone change their birthday restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I \u2014\u201d </p><p>Whatever Dan had been going to say was cut off by the door chime, which jarred them both out of the conversation. Instinctively, both Dan and Phil turned to look at the person entering.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan muttered under his breath as soon as he caught sight of them, swivelling back to Phil and resolutely turning his back on the door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Phil trailed off, eyes wide in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan confirmed. </p><p>Phil barely had time to utter a quiet <i>oh</i> before the high-pitched shrieking started.</p><p>\u201cI should have known I\u2019d find you here!\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was louder and more shrill than Phil had seen online. Her heels <i>clack clack clacked</i> as she made her way across the coffee shop, coming to a stop just behind Dan. In every picture that Phil had seen of this woman online, she\u2019d looked <i>immaculate</i>. But now that he was seeing her in person, she looked a little more <i>fake</i>. Phil could see just how much makeup was caked on her face, and there was no way that her nails were naturally that thick or long.  </p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you returned any of my calls?\u201d The woman aggressively snapped at Dan. </p><p>Dan shoved his coffee away from himself, but didn\u2019t turn to face the woman. If anything, he slumped even <i>further</i> forward, closing a bit more of the distance between Phil and him.</p><p>Phil could feel the wind from the sigh Dan exhaled, could see the subtle shake of his head and the lines forming around his eyes as he squeezed them tightly shut. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Izzy?\u201d Dan asked in a quiet, resigned voice. He sounded defeated, like he was still upset \u2014 maybe even hurt? Phil couldn\u2019t help wondering how Dan felt, couldn\u2019t help wishing that he could <i>ask</i>.</p><p>\u201cSo this is him,\u201d Isabella snapped. She was glaring daggers at the back of Dan\u2019s head. \u201cThe <i>cabr\u00f3n</i>.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to get Dan\u2019s attention; his back straightened and his already tense shoulders tightened even more. His eyes flew open and he stared at Phil in horror. </p><p>\u201cThis is who?\u201d he asked, his back still to Isabella. His tone was tense and came out more like a warning than anything else. </p><p>Isabella\u2019s eyes drifted to Phil, disdainfully raking up and down his body before settling on his face. The intense scrutiny \u2014 and her displeased expression\u2014 made Phil squirm awkwardly. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Phil, right?\u201d Isabella asked, not sounding like she really wanted an answer from Phil \u2014 or Dan for that matter. Phil flinched back, surprised by the derogatory tone she was using to talk about <i>him</i>; she didn\u2019t even <i>know</i> Phil.</p><p>Phil was <i>well aware</i> of the fact that Isabella and Dan didn\u2019t have the best of relationships, and had suspected that she was, well, kind of a bitch. And now that he was meeting her, now that he was hearing how she talked to Dan and seeing the way she looked at him, Phil suddenly felt like, if anything, he had <i>underestimated</i> how horrible she was. How <i>shitty</i> their relationship must have been at times. </p><p>How the <i>hell</i> had Dan managed to date her? Especially for almost a year.</p><p>\u201cIs this the fag who turned you into a full on homo?\u201d Her face was filled with disgust as she looked back and forth between Phil and Dan. Although Dan had sat up more rigidly, he was still <i>very</i> close to Phil \u2014 something Isabella was undoubtedly picking up on, and clearly not very happy about. </p><p>The comment seemed to be too much for Dan, though, because he forcefully stood up, finally spinning around to face Isabella. Phil caught sight of the angry glare on Dan\u2019s face before his back was fully to him.</p><p>\u201cLeave Phil out of this, Isabella,\u201d Dan ordered. </p><p>If Phil had felt awkward before, he was downright <i>uncomfortable</i> now. He wasn\u2019t particularly enjoying the way Isabella was talking about him as if he wasn\u2019t in the room. Whatever this fight was, Phil didn\u2019t want to be a part of it \u2014 and it sounded like Dan wanted Isabella to focus on something else, too. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to ask this one more time,\u201d Dan continued tersely. \u201c<i>What do you want?</i>\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes shifted from Dan to Isabella. Her hands were crossed in front of her chest, one hip popped out. </p><p>\u201cI want to get back together,\u201d she said, voice clipped, as if it were obvious. </p><p>From what Phil could tell, she actually looked serious, too. How the hell could she think that was a reasonable request? She\u2019d <i>cheated</i> on Dan!</p><p>Dan laughed, but it was a bitter chuckle, not the boisterous happy laugh Phil was accustomed to hearing. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he retorted harshly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Is it because of him?\u201d Isabella nodded her head towards Phil, who was still frozen in shock behind the counter. God, he <i>really</i> didn\u2019t want to witness this.</p><p>\u201cLook, can we talk about this in private?\u201d Dan gestured outside. </p><p>Isabella scoffed. \u201cIf you wanted to talk <i>in private,</i> you should have answered my phone calls. Now tell me, is it or is it not because of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it fucking matter?\u201d Dan spat. \u201cI don\u2019t love you, why the <i>hell</i> would I get back together with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d If Phil wasn\u2019t mistaken, Isabella sounded <i>hurt</i>, like she was <i>begging</i> Dan to not deny loving her. Phil wasn\u2019t sure what right she had to make such a request.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say whatever the hell I want, Izzy,\u201d Dan barked, rubbing his hands roughly down his face with an aggravated sigh. \u201cI <i>never</i> fucking loved you. I was too caught up in my fucking job to realize how shitty of a girlfriend you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! We were happy.\u201d Isabella\u2019s scornful eyes flickered back over to Phil, and he found himself automatically taking a few steps backwards. \u201cOr at least we were before <i>someone</i> came into the picture. Now fucking tell me, is <i>he</i> the reason you broke up with me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you forgetting the part where you <i>cheated</i> on me?\u201d Dan cried, sounding scandalized. \u201cOr the part where you fucking <i>used </i>me for <i>months</i>?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh. </i>That was new. Phil had no idea exactly what Dan meant by being <i>used</i>, but he could imagine \u2014 and everything he thought of was horrible. </p><p> \u201cI didn\u2019t <i>use</i> you, Danny,\u201d she argued, looking pissed off Dan would even suggest such a thing. </p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Dan sneered.</p><p>Isabella took a menacing step forward. \u201cWhatever. But you didn\u2019t answer my question about this <i>cabr\u00f3n</i>.\u201d Her voice was as harsh and sharp as the sound of her heels <i>clack clacking</i> with the movement. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a question worth answering.\u201d</p><p>Isabella scoffed. \u201cI should have known when you told me you liked guys you\u2019d dump me for one eventually.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise. What kind of biphobic bullshit was <i>that</i>? </p><p>Anger was practically <i>radiating</i> off Dan and the tension in the coffee shop felt thick enough to cut with a knife. Dan\u2019s hands stopped tapping against his thighs, and instead clamped into tight fists by his sides. Phil took a small step backwards towards the backroom, preparing to flee if things got any more heated.</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit, not <i>this</i> again.\u201d Dan glanced over his shoulder, sending Phil an apologetic look \u2014 for what, Phil wasn\u2019t sure. It\u2019s not like Dan could control the crap coming out of Isabella\u2019s mouth. \u201cFirst of fucking all, I told you I\u2019m <i>bi</i>sexual. That means I like boys <i>and</i> girls. It\u2019s not that hard of a fucking concept. Do you realize how offensive it is to accuse me of breaking up with you because you\u2019re not a guy, even though I like girls, too? <i>Bisexuality is a real fucking thing, Izzy</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hands unclenched, only to reach up and pull at his hair. \u201cSecond of fucking all, I broke up with you because you\u2019re a manipulative, cheating <i>bitch,</i> and were using me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only cheated on you because you stopped sleeping with me!\u201d Isabella argued. Something about the way she said it made Phil think she truly believed it was a legitimate excuse. </p><p>Phil sort of knew that Dan had stopped sleeping with her \u2014 although Phil wasn\u2019t exactly sure <i>when</i>.  Still, he couldn\u2019t help but take a <i>little</i> bit of satisfaction in that. Phil <i>hated</i> imagining Dan sleeping with someone else, someone that wasn\u2019t <i>him</i>, even though he knew most of Dan and Isabella\u2019s relationship was based on, well, physical <i>affection.</i></p><p>\u201cOh fuck off,\u201d Dan scoffed. \u201cUs not having sex anymore doesn\u2019t excuse you <i>fucking</i> those guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to tell me there was nothing going on with this <i>pendejo</i>?\u201d Isabella looked at Phil again. He didn\u2019t know spanish, didn\u2019t know what <i>pendejo</i> meant, but from the tone of her voice \u2014 and the hateful look on her face \u2014 Phil knew it wasn\u2019t flattering. \u201cYou can\u2019t really tell me you\u2019re any better than me! Is he the reason you stopped sleeping with me? Because you were fucking him instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI <i>never</i> would have cheated on you, and you know that!\u201d Dan shot back, enraged.</p><p>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d Isabella bit out. \u201cAre you with him now? Cause the media seems to think you are and I\u2019m inclined to believe it. Why else would you refuse me!?\u201d Isabella gestured toward herself as if she really couldn\u2019t understand </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your fucking business!\u201d Dan practically growled. He moved towards Isabella \u2014 a move that definitely would have intimated Phil if he was standing in Isabella\u2019s tall, pointy heels. \u201cYou and I are over. The end. Now get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>For a minute, Phil wasn\u2019t sure <i>what</i> Isabella was going to do. She was fuming, her face hard and her body tense. From what Phil had seen so far, Isabella had one <i>hell</i> of a temper and the fury etched in her body made him worry that it might escalate even more. </p><p>She was frozen like that for nearly a full minute, but eventually she turned around and made for the door. The echo of her heels on the floor was loud in the tense silence of the coffee shop. </p><p>She only made it halfway there before she turned back around and charged back to the counter, coming to a stop just in front of Dan. She was closer than before, close enough that Phil could smell her sickeningly sweet perfume. Her hand reached out to grab Dan\u2019s, but he pulled back. </p><p>The anger seemed to have dissipated, and was instead replaced with a sad, pitiful look.</p><p>\u201cWe were on a good path, Danny!\u201d She was pleading now. If Phil could stand her, he\u2019d probably feel embarrassed for her. \u201cThe media loved us, your fans loved us! I <i>miss </i>you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you miss the media and the fan attention, not me.\u201d Dan laughed coldly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice that the media has hardly been paying attention to you now that you\u2019re not <i>Dan Howell\u2019s Girlfriend</i>.\u201d </p><p>Isabella huffed, and the rage from earlier flickered in her eyes again. Phil genuinely expected her to retaliate.</p><p>But she took a few deep breaths and her shoulders deliberately relaxed as she stuck to her attempts to be sweet, maybe even <i>loving</i>. \u201cOf <i>course </i>I miss <i>you</i>.\u201d Isabella\u2019s eyes were wide and full of what Phil was sure was supposed to be innocence. \u201cI miss every single part of you, Danny.\u201d</p><p>Phil fought back a gag \u2014 he was pretty sure he knew what <i>that</i> meant, and the implication of it didn\u2019t sit well with him. </p><p>Maybe Phil\u2019s reaction, or Dan\u2019s silence, spurred her on, because Isabella continued talking. \u201cI miss spending time with you, I miss the way you used to hold me, and touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell too fucking bad,\u201d Dan said flippantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Isabella roared.</p><p>\u201cIt means I don\u2019t want to ever fucking touch you again,\u201d Dan spat.</p><p>Isabella stepped closer, anger creeping back onto her face. \u201cI think you need a reminder of what you\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t have time to prepare himself for what happened \u2014 and he doubted Dan did either.</p><p>Isabella launched herself forward, colliding with Dan and pressing her lips to his. </p><p>How fucking <i>dare</i> she? Phil\u2019s blood positively <i>boiled</i>. He <i>never</i> wanted to see Dan kiss someone else and now he was forced to stand here and watch Isabella glue her lips to Dan\u2019s. Isabella had <i>no</i> right to force herself on Dan, to kiss him when he didn\u2019t belong to her anymore. </p><p>Phil hadn\u2019t even had the opportunity to kiss Dan yet, but he still felt <i>so possessive</i> over him. </p><p>Dan was frozen for a split second, completely rigid and not moving. It felt like time stood still as Isabella insistently pressed her lips to a completely immobile Dan, and all Phil could do was <i>stare.</i></p><p>Something snapped in Dan, though, and Phil watched Dan\u2019s hands come up and land on her shoulders, forcefully pushing her away without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i> is wrong with you?\u201d Dan shouted. \u201cYou have <i>no</i> right to kiss me. Get out of my fucking face <i>right fucking now</i>,\u201d Dan seethed. </p><p>Isabella recoiled from Dan\u2019s touch, flinching back and stumbling on her tall heels. She looked shocked, and the hurt and rage were both back in full force. In fact, she looked more livid, more crazed, than she had thus far. </p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Isabella screeched, her voice full of venom. \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, Dan Howell!\u201d </p><p>Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel sharply and marched towards the door.</p><p>\u201cUnlikely!\u201d Dan roared after her, almost laughing as she stormed out the door.</p><p>Once Isabella was gone, the coffee shop fell into silence except for the sound of Dan\u2019s heavy breathing. Phil wasn\u2019t sure what to say, wasn\u2019t sure what to do. He felt like a lot of information \u2014 information he wasn\u2019t sure he was supposed to have \u2014 had just been dropped on him, and he didn\u2019t know what to do with it.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t Phil\u2019s battle, and Isabella was nothing but his almost-boyfriend\u2019s ex-girlfriend, but he was <i>pissed</i>. Pissed about the degrading way Isabella had talked about <i>both</i> of their sexualities. Pissed about the fact that Isabella kissed Dan without his consent. Pissed about Isabella\u2019s attempts to justify her cheating and get Dan back.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t even <i>begin</i> to fathom how Dan was feeling right now.</p><p>It took almost a full minute, but Dan\u2019s breathing eventually returned to normal, and he turned around, collapsing back on his stool.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Phil murmured when Dan looked up at him. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA giant fucking shitshow?\u201d Dan raised his eyebrows and smiled humorously.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to say \u2018unfair\u2019, but yeah, that works too.\u201d Phil offered Dan what he hoped was a reassuring smile. Phil <i>desperately</i> wanted to reach out and hold Dan\u2019s hand, run his fingers through Dan\u2019s hair. Something. <i>Anything</i>. </p><p>But Phil was hyper aware of the fact that they were in public \u2014 and that Isabella could come back in at any second \u2014 so he kept his hands to himself.</p><p>\u201cSorry you had to see that,\u201d Dan said, sounding genuinely apologetic. </p><p>After all of <i>that</i>, how could Dan\u2019s first reaction be to apologize to Phil? </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always been too dramatic for her own good,\u201d Dan continued. \u201cThank fuck there wasn\u2019t anyone else here today. But still, I\u2019m sorry you got roped into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Phil insisted, unable to understand why Dan was feeling guilty; there was nothing he could have done to stop it. Hell, Dan had tried to stop Isabella multiple times and she\u2019d just <i>kept going</i>. </p><p>Dan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI mean, it sort of is. She\u2019s not, like, entirely wrong.\u201d He averted his eyes. </p><p>Phil didn\u2019t know what to say, and wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure which accusations Dan seemed to think Isabella had some grounds to make. He wanted to ask, he wanted to <i>push</i>. </p><p>But then again, after learning about Dan\u2019s album, and hearing the lyrics to the song he\u2019d written, Phil was fairly certain he could guess which accusation held some truth. </p><p>\u201cThanks for the coffee,\u201d Dan muttered, looking back at Phil, \u201cBut I think I\u2019m going to go home and have something a bit stronger.\u201d Shifting off of his stool, Dan went to walk away. </p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t ready for him to go yet, though. </p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Phil said, grabbing Dan\u2019s arm before he could pull completely away. \u201cLet me buy you a drink. You can rant all you want to me if you feel like it.\u201d Phil realized that Dan might want to drop it and focus on something happier, so he softly added, \u201cOr not talk about it. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have, like, work?\u201d Dan asked, gesturing around the coffeeshop.</p><p>Phil glanced at the clock. </p><p>\u201cEh, we\u2019re set to close in half an hour and it\u2019s been dead since those kids left.\u201d Phil shrugged with his free arm. \u201cI think we can afford to close early for one night.\u201d What Emmalee didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes flickered down to his arm, which Phil was still holding onto. After only a moment\u2019s hesitation, he nodded slowly. \u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah, okay. That sounds good.\u201d A shy smile grew on his face.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips twitched up into a small smile, relieved that Dan wanted to spend time with him despite still looking riled up from the fight. \u201cI need like ten minutes to close up. Why don\u2019t you grab a warmer coat in the meantime and then we can go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d Dan smiled. \u201cWanna just meet me upstairs when you\u2019re done? Maybe we can, um, have a drink at mine or something before we go out?\u201d</p><p>Without his consent, Phil\u2019s eyebrows shot up, betraying his surprise that Dan was <i>inviting him up to his apartment.</i></p><p>Phil wanted that though. He <i>really</i> wanted that.</p><p>\u201cA drink at yours sounds great,\u201d Phil agreed. A drink, a cuddle, a kiss. Whatever. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dan said with a note of finality. \u201cIt\u2019s the building right next door. I\u2019m in apartment 701. I\u2019ll tell the doorman to let you in.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, that works,\u201d Phil smiled softly. </p><p>Dan grinned back, lingering for moment before grabbing his light jacket. He pulled it on, not bothering to zip it up, and smiled \u2014 a smile that was filled with excitement and anxiety. </p><p>\u201cSee you soon, Philly.\u201d Dan gave Phil a two-fingered salute and ducked out the door.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t waste any time in rinsing out Dan\u2019s mug and adding it to the dishwasher. The counters were clean, but he\u2019d never gotten around to wiping down the table that the uni students were at earlier. He grabbed a rag and the keys, planning to lock the door just in case anyone came. </p><p>Unfortunately, a customer walked in before Phil could make it to the door.</p><p>\u201cHi, welcome! We\u2019re closing in ten minutes, so it\u2019s to-go orders only now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cGreat! What can I get for you?\u201d Phil asked, not so subtly trying to hurry her along. Unfortunately for him, the lady was looking straight at the menu, and didn\u2019t even seem to be aware of Phil. Phil\u2019s heart sank. That didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I need just a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem! Just let me know when you\u2019re ready!\u201d Phil said in as chipper of a voice as he could manage and smiled a wide, fake grin despite the fact that he was very, <i>very</i> much annoyed.</p><p>Grabbing his phone, Phil hid it below the counter, and quickly texted Dan.</p><p><i>Sorry a customer just walked in so I might be a little bit longer. I told her we are only doing to-go orders though, so it shouldn\u2019t be that long.</i></p><p>Almost immediately, his phone lit up with a reply.</p><p><i>dw take your time</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have a toasted crumpet, please,\u201d the lady finally said a moment later, thankfully quicker than Phil had honestly been expecting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be right up!\u201d Phil replied quickly, and took the last crumpet from the display case in order to drop it in the toaster. Mentally, Phil urged the toaster to cook faster.</p><p>While the woman\u2019s order heated up, Phil glanced back at his phone and saw another message from Dan.</p><p><i>not too long though plz</i></p><p> Phil couldn\u2019t help the wide grin that spread across his face in response, because it was clear that Dan was just as impatient for <i>whatever</i> was about to happen as Phil was.</p><hr><p><b>a/n: </b>come scream at me! i will wait to post asks with spoilers for 24 hours though :)\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>title: </b>Love Yourself<br /><b>summary: </b>A lot of things about Dan&rsquo;s life are pretty great. He gets to make the music he wants, he&rsquo;s got a great fanbase, and his manager is his best friend. A few things about his life suck a bit more. He&rsquo;s currently lacking inspiration, he&rsquo;s rather lonely, and he&rsquo;s stuck in a rut. Dan&rsquo;s been going to the same coffee shop for years. It&rsquo;s quiet, it&rsquo;s quaint, it&rsquo;s near his home. Most importantly: none of the employees give a shit that&rsquo;s he a world-famous singer.

He&rsquo;d done his best to behave himself in public all day, but it was night now, and he was back in the safety of his hotel room, and he didn&rsquo;t care anymore. </p><p>He stumbled over to one of the beds &mdash; the one closest to the bathroom that he <i>always </i>insisted on sleeping in &mdash; and pulled his laptop into his lap. Adaline followed behind him, padlocking the door and making her way to the other side of the room. </p><p>They were sharing a standard two bed hotel room, although they could have probably been upgraded to a suite if Dan had just asked the host of the concert. All of Dan&rsquo;s expenses were coming out of the charity money, though, so he was determined to use as little of the funds as possible. </p><p>Unfortunately for Adaline, that meant that instead of having her own room, she was forced to suffer through Dan&rsquo;s antics &mdash; something that Dan distantly realized was probably particularly painful right now. </p><p>&ldquo;No, you stupid piece of <i>trash</i>,&rdquo; Dan muttered when the computer screen shook and informed him that he had the incorrect password. Dan punched each letter of his password into his keyboard forcefully.</p><p>The fucking computer just wasn&rsquo;t cooperating though. The screen shook and gave him an error message <i>again.</i> Dan entered his password a third time, this time saying the letters out loud as he entered them to make sure he typed it correctly.  &ldquo;<i>C-o-l-l-i-n-2-0-1-4.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>The login screen faded and his homescreen &mdash; a picture of him and Darcy smushed cheek to cheek &mdash; loaded. Dan glanced up, and saw that across the room Addie was drunkenly trying to wipe her makeup off. So far it looked like she&rsquo;d just manage to give herself dark raccoon eyes.</p><p>Dan opened skype, determined to talk to Phil tonight. Since the radio show, they&rsquo;d only been able to text and Dan missed his boyfr&mdash; <i>Phil&rsquo;s</i> face. They&rsquo;d been <i>so fucking close</i> to kissing on that night, and a small part of Dan wished he&rsquo;d thrown caution into the wind and said fuck the glass wall, fuck privacy, fuck everything, and just kissed him. But in a way, Dan was also grateful to Addie&rsquo;s phone call for stopping Dan from being <i>too</i> reckless. </p><p>Dan had worried that things might be weird between them, but the only change was that their texts had become impossibly flirtier since then.</p><p>When skype loaded, Dan didn&rsquo;t hesitate to click on Phil&rsquo;s name. He didn&rsquo;t even bother to check if there was a blue <i>online</i> dot next to Phil&rsquo;s name, he just aggressively smashed the button and watched the little <i>bloop bloop bloop </i>light up as it called Phil. </p><p>The skype ringtone rang <i>once</i>, <i>twice</i>, before Phil answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Philly!&rdquo; Dan shrieked cheerfully when a grainy Phil loaded on his screen.</p><p>The Phil that Dan <i>could</i> see on skype looked soft, cozy, and tired. &ldquo;Hi, Dan,&rdquo; Phil mumbled back, much sleepier. &ldquo;How are you tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Dan responded, definitely a little too loudly if the way both Phil and Adaline jumped was anything to go by.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; Phil nodded &mdash; or tried to, at least. He was laying in bed, his cheek resting on his blue-and-green checkered pillow.</p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;look tired.&rdquo; Dan frowned slightly as the skype call got clearer and he was able to take in the way Phil&rsquo;s eyelids looked heavy, and the fact that his voice was laced with croakiness.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s after two in the morning here, I was asleep,&rdquo; Phil said, rolling his eyes. He didn&rsquo;t sound upset though.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s frown deepened. &ldquo;Why were ya on skype?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s cheeks flushed, and for a moment, Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure why. Not until Phil explained, anyway. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of town and I missed you, so, um, just in case, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>Flattered, Dan bashfully buried his face in his hands and shook his head as he regained his composure. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfect,&rdquo; he mumbled into his palms. When he could look Phil in the eye again, Dan looked back up, a wide grin on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;What did y&rsquo;do this weekend?&rdquo; Dan slurred, his smile never faltering. He leaned forward, resting his elbow on his knee and his chin in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;PJ and his girlfriend came up to visit, which was good.&rdquo; Phil smiled softly, rubbing at his eyes sleepily. The screen turned into a pixelated blur of movement. When skype focused again, Phil was propped up against his headboard. His quiff was messy and his thick black frames were sitting crooked on his face. &ldquo;Tell me about your night, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ads and I went out for beer an&rsquo; did a lil&rsquo; walking tour on our way back.&rdquo; Dan precariously leaned off the bed as he reached for the water bottle on the bedside table. </p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmh,&rdquo; Phil hummed. &ldquo;I saw.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shot back upright, launching himself into the frame. &ldquo;Ya&rsquo; did?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil confirmed, looking confused by Dan&rsquo;s reaction. &ldquo;I saw your instagram story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck,&rdquo; Dan murmured, more to himself than Phil. He didn&rsquo;t <i>quite</i> remember posting anything to instagram, but now that Phil mentioned it, he sort of remembered him and Adaline taking a lot of pictures on their way home. Were those instagram pictures? Dan grabbed his phone from the pillow, pressing his finger to the home button over and over, causing the screen to shake in protest. &ldquo;M&rsquo;phone won&rsquo;t unlock,&rdquo; he pouted at Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Type your passcode, then, you silly goose,&rdquo; Phil teased. </p><p>Dan dropped his phone back onto the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lazy. What&rsquo;d I post?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing big,&rdquo; Phil smiled. &ldquo;Just a few pictures of beer and you guys at some tourist spots.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s eyebrows rose skeptically. &ldquo;Why, did something happen you didn&rsquo;t want the internet to see?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wah&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dan stammered. &ldquo;I - uh, well. We talked some.&rdquo; Dan had blurry memories of nearly shouting about how much he liked Phil Lester on the way home and it&rsquo;d be just his luck to film some monument during one of his speeches.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all just pictures.&rdquo; Phil assured him. &ldquo;No talking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Dan smiled dopily.</p><p>Dan watched Phil&rsquo;s eyes rake up and down the screen and barely resisted the urge to slap his hand over the webcam. He couldn&rsquo;t handle being under Phil&rsquo;s scrutiny like that &mdash; not when he couldn&rsquo;t do something about it. Especially since that <i>something</i> was right on the verge of happening. &ldquo;I like your outfit tonight, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;did?&rdquo; Dan asked, looking down at himself. &ldquo;<i>Oh</i>,&rdquo; he murmured. Dan vaguely felt his cheeks burn, so he grabbed the collar of his jumper and tugged it over the bottom half of his face. &ldquo;Are y&rsquo;mad?&rdquo; Dan asked timidly.</p><p>On the screen, Phil blinked back at Dan blankly. &ldquo;Mad?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan fiddled with the hem of the <i>Pugs Not Drugs</i> jumper. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, that I still have your clothes.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shook his head, and for a long second, Dan was worried that Phil <i>was</i> upset with him. &ldquo;It looks better on you, anyway.&rdquo; </p><p>The blush on Dan&rsquo;s face deepened, and he pulled the sweatshirt even further up, so that the collar was completely covering his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s n&rsquo; true,&rdquo; he muttered petulantly.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Phil laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never even seen me wear it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan yanked the collar down again so he could see Phil again. &ldquo;I have too!&rdquo; Dan insisted indignantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen y&rsquo;wear it <i>loads</i> on your channel!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil raised his eyebrows skeptically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I wore it in, like, one video.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, um, may&rsquo;ve watched it a few times,&rdquo; Dan admitted, his eyes darting around the room shiftily.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Phil groaned, his hands shooting up to cover his face. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t even that good of a video!&rdquo;</p><p>Feeling particularly brazen because of the alcohol coursing through his veins, Dan confessed the real reason he loved that video so much. &ldquo;I like watching it when &lsquo;m wearing this jumper.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan let out a triumphant giggle when Phil&rsquo;s cheeks turned a dark red. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh m&rsquo;god, <i>Dan</i>,&rdquo; Adaline whined as she marched across the room and over to Dan&rsquo;s bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough of you gushing &lsquo;bout Phil, &lsquo;nd I don&rsquo;t need t&rsquo;hear you flirt with him on skype, too.&rdquo; She reached for his computer &mdash; for what, Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure. But he knew he didn&rsquo;t want to find out.</p><p>&ldquo;Then close y&rsquo; ears,&rdquo; Dan grumbled, pulling his computer into his chest and away from Adaline.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no&rsquo; how ears work.&rdquo; Adaline was just as drunk as Dan &mdash; if not drunker &mdash; but she managed to grab the computer of out Dan&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!!!&rdquo; Dan protested and lunged for his computer a beat too late thanks to his alcohol-slowed reactions. Adaline had already moved to her bed, and without her weight to catch him, Dan fell to the floor of the narrow aisle between the beds. &ldquo;Adddddd<i>ieee</i>,&rdquo; he whined from the floor, staring up at his sister with wide, betrayed eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s an idiot,&rdquo; Adaline giggled, shaking her head and rolling her eyes to the camera. Dan watched in horror as she spun the computer around to face him and capture his humiliating position on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;A cute idiot,&rdquo; Phil added. Even from down on the floor, Dan could see the smile on Phil&rsquo;s face and the twinkle in his eye.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Gross</i>,&rdquo; Adaline groaned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; t&rsquo;bed. G&rsquo;night, Philip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; both Dan and Phil cried as she started to close the computer. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I say goodnight to Dan?&rdquo; Phil pleaded hopefully. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine. Y&rsquo;get two minutes.&rdquo; Adaline dropped the computer off the bed and onto Dan&rsquo;s stomach without warning. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Ooof</i>,&rdquo; Dan grunted as the computer landed on him heavily, nearly knocking the wind out of him. &ldquo;Hi again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi there, you drunkard,&rdquo; Phil greeted with a smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Rude,&rdquo; Dan pouted, unable to keep the smile off his face though. </p><p>&ldquo;When do you get home tomorrow?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I think like three. Maybe four, I dunno.&rdquo; Dan shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking Addie straight t&rsquo; the train station when we get there, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Phil frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s brows furrowed and he moved his head closer to the screen, trying to figure out what was wrong with Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;I got called into work tomorrow evening,&rdquo; Phil explained.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he tried to think of why the BBC would want Phil to come in on a Monday. &ldquo;What does the BBC want?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil shook his head. &ldquo;Beans and Grind, not the BBC,&rdquo; he corrected. &ldquo;Emmalee isn&rsquo;t feeling well so I&rsquo;m closing for her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s frown twisted into a smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy, then. I&rsquo;ll try to come visit you.&rdquo;</p><p>A slow, matching smile spread onto Phil&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two minutes is up,&rdquo; Adaline called from above him. &ldquo;Say g&rsquo;bye to loverboy now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night night, loverboy!&rdquo; Dan said eagerly with a dramatic wave to the camera. </p><p>A bright red blush spread across Phil&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Goodnight, dear. I&rsquo;ll &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t get to hear the rest of whatever Phil was saying, though, because Adaline leaned off the bed and slammed the laptop lid shut. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you, sis,&rdquo;  Dan grumbled as he pushed himself off the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Go to bed, bro,&rdquo; Adaline shot back.</p><p>******************************</p><p>On Monday afternoon, the shop was busier than normal. There was a large group of hipster uni students working on a group project &mdash; marketing, by the sounds of it &mdash; and every ten minutes, one of them would come up to the counter to order another pourover coffee (they refused to drink anything else, apparently), which was painstakingly slow to make, and prevented Phil from being able to do much else. He really wished they&rsquo;d all order at once so that he could make a larger batch. </p><p>Of course they didn&rsquo;t though, so Phil only had a few minutes of downtime between making each drink. He&rsquo;d brought his laptop to work with im, hoping that the shop would be slow enough that he could edit the collab that he&rsquo;d filmed with PJ over the weekend. So far, Phil had only had time to download the footage and import it into the program, though.</p><p>If he was going to be distracted from youtube work, Phil would have greatly preferred it to be because of Dan, not hipster uni students.</p><p>The truth was, working at Beans and Grind was starting to take up more time that Phil was able to dedicate to it. Over the past few weeks, he had cut back his hours pretty substantially, but it was still burdensome. He&rsquo;d originally taken the job for a little bit of financial security and so that he&rsquo;d have a way to make some new friends in London. But Phil didn&rsquo;t <i>need</i> extra money now &mdash; everything was going well with the BBC &mdash; and he&rsquo;d met enough people in London that he didn&rsquo;t feel so isolated anymore. </p><p>For a long time now, Phil had only kept the job because it was an easy excuse to see Dan. But their friendship had developed &mdash; and was teetering right on the edge of something <i>more</i> &mdash; and the need for the coffee shop had grown less and less until it was completely obsolete. Now, the only reason Phil kept the job was because of his friendship with Emmalee, and the knowledge that she struggled to find good help.</p><p>So here Phil was, working a shift that wasn&rsquo;t normally his, even though he had a video to edit and a boy he wanted to spend time with. </p><p>Phil hoped the group of hipsters left before Dan came so they could catch up in peace at least.</p><p>While Phil waited for the hipsters to leave, and Dan to arrive, Phil found himself growing distracted from working on his video, and watching a recap video of Dan&rsquo;s performance in Germany instead. The customers weren&rsquo;t paying him any attention, and Phil really didn&rsquo;t get a shit about their opinion of him, so he didn&rsquo;t even bother trying to hide the his earphones. </p><p>Just as Phil had expected, the new song &mdash; or snippet of a song, really, since it was only about a minute and a half long &mdash; was something Phil had heard before. It wasn&rsquo;t any of the songs Phil thought Dan might play, though. </p><p>No, it was the slow song, the one he&rsquo;d written the guitar part on skype with Phil during their first coproductive session. </p><p><i>&ldquo;This song is really special to me,&rdquo; </i>Dan was saying in the video.<i> &ldquo;Writing it was really what inspired me to shape my new album around a concept.&rdquo; The crowd screamed loudly as Dan pulled up a wooden stool and took an acoustic guitar from a stagehand. &ldquo;I talked about it the other day on BBC Radio, but if any of you missed it, I&rsquo;m writing a concept album &mdash; it&rsquo;s centered around not liking what you have, about wanting something different, and, really, about just <b>going</b> for it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit different from my other stuff, but I hope you all like it.&rdquo; Dan smiled weakly, giving away just how nervous he was. &ldquo;This song is about that middle part &mdash; wanting what you don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Of course, Phil had heard the acoustic guitar portion of the song before, but Dan hadn&rsquo;t shared the lyrics with him yet. When Dan was originally writing the song, Phil hadn&rsquo;t known that Dan liked him &mdash; would never have even imagined that the song might be about, well, <i>him</i>.</p><p>But knowing that now, Phil suddenly understood why Dan had written <i>this</i> song when they were on skype together. That was well over a month ago, and Dan wasn&rsquo;t even here, but Phil felt his cheeks growing hot as he realized he&rsquo;d essentially been Dan&rsquo;s <i>muse</i> while writing this song. </p><p>Now Phil was getting the full experience though, and finally getting to hear the lyrics. Phil could hear the raw <i>want</i> that Dan was capturing with this song&hellip; And now that Phil knew the concept of this album and just how much it pertained to <i>him</i>&hellip;</p><p>Well, now he was have trouble holding literal <i>tears </i>back. Based on the lyrics, it sounded like Dan was lusting after something and like he desperately wanted something he couldn&rsquo;t have. And, unbeknownst to the world, that something was <i>Phil</i>.</p><p>The song perfectly reflected how Phil felt at that time. Apparently Dan had felt exactly the same.</p><p>The last chords of the song had barely faded away before Phil restarted the clip and listened to it again and again and again. </p><p>He listened it it so many times over the course of the next hour that he&rsquo;d memorized the lyrics and could hum the melody from memory alone. </p><p>Phil absolutely loved it, and if this is what Dan&rsquo;s entire album was going to be like, Phil thought he was going to love it, too.</p><p>Afternoon faded into early evening. Much to Phil&rsquo;s displeasure, the hipsters were still there, and there was no sign of Dan. </p><p>Dejectedly, Phil wiped the counter down and willed Dan to come through the door, even though he&rsquo;d only promised to <i>try</i> to come by when he got home. The past three days felt like an eternity, though, and Phil <i>missed</i> Dan &mdash; far more than was probably reasonable for such a short period of time. </p><p>Three of the students packed up their laptops and messily discarded their dishes on the counter that Phil had <i>just</i> cleaned. Having to do and redo the same damn tasks back to back was Phil&rsquo;s <i>least </i>favorite part of the job. He moved the dishes to the sink and re-wet his washrag, not bothering to bid the customers a good day when he heard the door chime as they left. </p><p>Phil turned around to clean the counter for a second time, and was met with warm brown eyes, curly hair, and a wide smile. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Dan</i>,&rdquo; Phil gasped, his lips turning up into a grin of his own. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; he added stupidly. The door hadn&rsquo;t chimed a second time; Dan must have slipped in while the hipsters were leaving. </p><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Dan smiled. His eyes flicked over to the remaining customers. Phil&rsquo;s eyes followed Dan&rsquo;s gaze and he shrugged apathetically. </p><p>&ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo; Dan suggested cheerfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Decaf or regular?&rdquo; Phil asked even as he grabbed a cup and stuck it beneath the espresso spout, anticipating Dan&rsquo;s answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Regular. You can make it a double instead of a triple, though.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Of course.</i> Phil shook his head in mock exasperation. &ldquo;You do know that it&rsquo;s nearly six, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had a long weekend and I&rsquo;m tired, let me live.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice was lower, scratchier, than normal, and Phil could see dark bags shining through what looked to be some sort of concealer under his eyes. Dan&rsquo;s trip to Germany had been short, and from both his texts and his instagram stories, it looked like he&rsquo;d been doing stuff nonstop. He was probably desperate to curl up in bed and do nothing &mdash; Phil would be anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;You could go sleep if you want,&rdquo; Phil offered.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather talk to you.&rdquo; Dan winked. </p><p>Phil felt himself blush and funneled his energy into making Dan&rsquo;s espresso so that Dan wouldn&rsquo;t see how flustered he was. </p><p>The sun set, the remaining hipsters left, and Dan finished his coffee but didn&rsquo;t go home. Not long after arriving, he&rsquo;d pulled a stool over from the other end of the counter so that he could sit as close to Phil as possible. A small fire flickered in the fireplace, casting a warm glowing light onto the pair.</p><p>&ldquo;Did Adaline like Germany?&rdquo; Phil asked, leaning across the counter to shrink the distance between them even more.</p><p>&ldquo;She <i>loved</i> it! She kept saying it was the best birthday present she&rsquo;d ever gotten.&rdquo;</p><p>As the evening wore on, Dan regaled Phil with stories from their trip, explaining the context of some of his instagram stories. Every tidbit Phil learned about Dan, about his relationship with his sister, about his eagerness to see the world and help people, made Phil like him <i>that much more</i>. </p><p>When his coffee was gone, Dan ordered a second one. It was a coffee that Phil thought Dan definitely didn&rsquo;t need since it was almost <i>eight</i> at this point, even if this one was decaf, but Dan was drinking it anyway. </p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, tell me more about your friend&rsquo;s visit,&rdquo; Dan said as he leaned in closer to Phil, looking particularly beautiful in the soft, flickering light of the fire. </p><p>&ldquo;We filmed a couple of collabs, played a lot of board games, went out for a fancy dinner.&rdquo; Phil busied himself with wiping down the machines and stacking the dishes in the dishwasher. Talking about his weekend with PJ and Sophie without confessing how much time they had spent grilling him for information about his blossoming relationship with Dan was hard. </p><p>&ldquo;Oooo, did you have good food?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Phil huffed indignantly. &ldquo;We got cheese fondue.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan cocked his head to the side, wrinkling his face up in confusion. &ldquo;But you hate cheese.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Phil cried, his voice coming out higher than normal. &ldquo;It was awful, I basically just had bread and fruit for dinner!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you go for that, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sophie&rsquo;s  birthday &mdash; that&rsquo;s PJ&rsquo;s girlfriend &mdash; was back in February so we were having a belated celebration.&rdquo; Phil shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you can make someone change their birthday restaurant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I &mdash;&rdquo; </p><p>Whatever Dan had been going to say was cut off by the door chime, which jarred them both out of the conversation. Instinctively, both Dan and Phil turned to look at the person entering.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Dan muttered under his breath as soon as he caught sight of them, swivelling back to Phil and resolutely turning his back on the door.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; Phil trailed off, eyes wide in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan confirmed. </p><p>Phil barely had time to utter a quiet <i>oh</i> before the high-pitched shrieking started.</p><p>&ldquo;I should have known I&rsquo;d find you here!&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s voice was louder and more shrill than Phil had seen online. Her heels <i>clack clack clacked</i> as she made her way across the coffee shop, coming to a stop just behind Dan. In every picture that Phil had seen of this woman online, she&rsquo;d looked <i>immaculate</i>. But now that he was seeing her in person, she looked a little more <i>fake</i>. Phil could see just how much makeup was caked on her face, and there was no way that her nails were naturally that thick or long.  </p><p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you returned any of my calls?&rdquo; The woman aggressively snapped at Dan. </p><p>Dan shoved his coffee away from himself, but didn&rsquo;t turn to face the woman. If anything, he slumped even <i>further</i> forward, closing a bit more of the distance between Phil and him.</p><p>Phil could feel the wind from the sigh Dan exhaled, could see the subtle shake of his head and the lines forming around his eyes as he squeezed them tightly shut. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you want, Izzy?&rdquo; Dan asked in a quiet, resigned voice. He sounded defeated, like he was still upset &mdash; maybe even hurt? Phil couldn&rsquo;t help wondering how Dan felt, couldn&rsquo;t help wishing that he could <i>ask</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;So this is him,&rdquo; Isabella snapped. She was glaring daggers at the back of Dan&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;The <i>cabr&oacute;n</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>That seemed to get Dan&rsquo;s attention; his back straightened and his already tense shoulders tightened even more. His eyes flew open and he stared at Phil in horror. </p><p>&ldquo;This is who?&rdquo; he asked, his back still to Isabella. His tone was tense and came out more like a warning than anything else. </p><p>Isabella&rsquo;s eyes drifted to Phil, disdainfully raking up and down his body before settling on his face. The intense scrutiny &mdash; and her displeased expression&mdash; made Phil squirm awkwardly. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Phil, right?&rdquo; Isabella asked, not sounding like she really wanted an answer from Phil &mdash; or Dan for that matter. Phil flinched back, surprised by the derogatory tone she was using to talk about <i>him</i>; she didn&rsquo;t even <i>know</i> Phil.</p><p>Phil was <i>well aware</i> of the fact that Isabella and Dan didn&rsquo;t have the best of relationships, and had suspected that she was, well, kind of a bitch. And now that he was meeting her, now that he was hearing how she talked to Dan and seeing the way she looked at him, Phil suddenly felt like, if anything, he had <i>underestimated</i> how horrible she was. How <i>shitty</i> their relationship must have been at times. </p><p>How the <i>hell</i> had Dan managed to date her? Especially for almost a year.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this the fag who turned you into a full on homo?&rdquo; Her face was filled with disgust as she looked back and forth between Phil and Dan. Although Dan had sat up more rigidly, he was still <i>very</i> close to Phil &mdash; something Isabella was undoubtedly picking up on, and clearly not very happy about. </p><p>The comment seemed to be too much for Dan, though, because he forcefully stood up, finally spinning around to face Isabella. Phil caught sight of the angry glare on Dan&rsquo;s face before his back was fully to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave Phil out of this, Isabella,&rdquo; Dan ordered. </p><p>If Phil had felt awkward before, he was downright <i>uncomfortable</i> now. He wasn&rsquo;t particularly enjoying the way Isabella was talking about him as if he wasn&rsquo;t in the room. Whatever this fight was, Phil didn&rsquo;t want to be a part of it &mdash; and it sounded like Dan wanted Isabella to focus on something else, too. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going to ask this one more time,&rdquo; Dan continued tersely. &ldquo;<i>What do you want?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes shifted from Dan to Isabella. Her hands were crossed in front of her chest, one hip popped out. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to get back together,&rdquo; she said, voice clipped, as if it were obvious. </p><p>From what Phil could tell, she actually looked serious, too. How the hell could she think that was a reasonable request? She&rsquo;d <i>cheated</i> on Dan!</p><p>Dan laughed, but it was a bitter chuckle, not the boisterous happy laugh Phil was accustomed to hearing. &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s not going to happen,&rdquo; he retorted harshly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not? Is it because of him?&rdquo; Isabella nodded her head towards Phil, who was still frozen in shock behind the counter. God, he <i>really</i> didn&rsquo;t want to witness this.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, can we talk about this in private?&rdquo; Dan gestured outside. </p><p>Isabella scoffed. &ldquo;If you wanted to talk <i>in private,</i> you should have answered my phone calls. Now tell me, is it or is it not because of him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it fucking matter?&rdquo; Dan spat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love you, why the <i>hell</i> would I get back together with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; If Phil wasn&rsquo;t mistaken, Isabella sounded <i>hurt</i>, like she was <i>begging</i> Dan to not deny loving her. Phil wasn&rsquo;t sure what right she had to make such a request.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say whatever the hell I want, Izzy,&rdquo; Dan barked, rubbing his hands roughly down his face with an aggravated sigh. &ldquo;I <i>never</i> fucking loved you. I was too caught up in my fucking job to realize how shitty of a girlfriend you were.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true! We were happy.&rdquo; Isabella&rsquo;s scornful eyes flickered back over to Phil, and he found himself automatically taking a few steps backwards. &ldquo;Or at least we were before <i>someone</i> came into the picture. Now fucking tell me, is <i>he</i> the reason you broke up with me or not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you forgetting the part where you <i>cheated</i> on me?&rdquo; Dan cried, sounding scandalized. &ldquo;Or the part where you fucking <i>used </i>me for <i>months</i>?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh. </i>That was new. Phil had no idea exactly what Dan meant by being <i>used</i>, but he could imagine &mdash; and everything he thought of was horrible. </p><p> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t <i>use</i> you, Danny,&rdquo; she argued, looking pissed off Dan would even suggest such a thing. </p><p>&ldquo;Bullshit,&rdquo; Dan sneered.</p><p>Isabella took a menacing step forward. &ldquo;Whatever. But you didn&rsquo;t answer my question about this <i>cabr&oacute;n</i>.&rdquo; Her voice was as harsh and sharp as the sound of her heels <i>clack clacking</i> with the movement. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it as a question worth answering.&rdquo;</p><p>Isabella scoffed. &ldquo;I should have known when you told me you liked guys you&rsquo;d dump me for one eventually.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up in surprise. What kind of biphobic bullshit was <i>that</i>? </p><p>Anger was practically <i>radiating</i> off Dan and the tension in the coffee shop felt thick enough to cut with a knife. Dan&rsquo;s hands stopped tapping against his thighs, and instead clamped into tight fists by his sides. Phil took a small step backwards towards the backroom, preparing to flee if things got any more heated.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy fucking shit, not <i>this</i> again.&rdquo; Dan glanced over his shoulder, sending Phil an apologetic look &mdash; for what, Phil wasn&rsquo;t sure. It&rsquo;s not like Dan could control the crap coming out of Isabella&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;First of fucking all, I told you I&rsquo;m <i>bi</i>sexual. That means I like boys <i>and</i> girls. It&rsquo;s not that hard of a fucking concept. Do you realize how offensive it is to accuse me of breaking up with you because you&rsquo;re not a guy, even though I like girls, too? <i>Bisexuality is a real fucking thing, Izzy</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hands unclenched, only to reach up and pull at his hair. &ldquo;Second of fucking all, I broke up with you because you&rsquo;re a manipulative, cheating <i>bitch,</i> and were using me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I only cheated on you because you stopped sleeping with me!&rdquo; Isabella argued. Something about the way she said it made Phil think she truly believed it was a legitimate excuse. </p><p>Phil sort of knew that Dan had stopped sleeping with her &mdash; although Phil wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure <i>when</i>.  Still, he couldn&rsquo;t help but take a <i>little</i> bit of satisfaction in that. Phil <i>hated</i> imagining Dan sleeping with someone else, someone that wasn&rsquo;t <i>him</i>, even though he knew most of Dan and Isabella&rsquo;s relationship was based on, well, physical <i>affection.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck off,&rdquo; Dan scoffed. &ldquo;Us not having sex anymore doesn&rsquo;t excuse you <i>fucking</i> those guys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you really going to tell me there was nothing going on with this <i>pendejo</i>?&rdquo; Isabella looked at Phil again. He didn&rsquo;t know spanish, didn&rsquo;t know what <i>pendejo</i> meant, but from the tone of her voice &mdash; and the hateful look on her face &mdash; Phil knew it wasn&rsquo;t flattering. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really tell me you&rsquo;re any better than me! Is he the reason you stopped sleeping with me? Because you were fucking him instead?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>never</i> would have cheated on you, and you know that!&rdquo; Dan shot back, enraged.</p><p>&ldquo;What about now?&rdquo; Isabella bit out. &ldquo;Are you with him now? Cause the media seems to think you are and I&rsquo;m inclined to believe it. Why else would you refuse me!?&rdquo; Isabella gestured toward herself as if she really couldn&rsquo;t understand </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your fucking business!&rdquo; Dan practically growled. He moved towards Isabella &mdash; a move that definitely would have intimated Phil if he was standing in Isabella&rsquo;s tall, pointy heels. &ldquo;You and I are over. The end. Now get the fuck out of here.&rdquo;</p><p>For a minute, Phil wasn&rsquo;t sure <i>what</i> Isabella was going to do. She was fuming, her face hard and her body tense. From what Phil had seen so far, Isabella had one <i>hell</i> of a temper and the fury etched in her body made him worry that it might escalate even more. </p><p>She was frozen like that for nearly a full minute, but eventually she turned around and made for the door. The echo of her heels on the floor was loud in the tense silence of the coffee shop. </p><p>She only made it halfway there before she turned back around and charged back to the counter, coming to a stop just in front of Dan. She was closer than before, close enough that Phil could smell her sickeningly sweet perfume. Her hand reached out to grab Dan&rsquo;s, but he pulled back. </p><p>The anger seemed to have dissipated, and was instead replaced with a sad, pitiful look.</p><p>&ldquo;We were on a good path, Danny!&rdquo; She was pleading now. If Phil could stand her, he&rsquo;d probably feel embarrassed for her. &ldquo;The media loved us, your fans loved us! I <i>miss </i>you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you miss the media and the fan attention, not me.&rdquo; Dan laughed coldly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that the media has hardly been paying attention to you now that you&rsquo;re not <i>Dan Howell&rsquo;s Girlfriend</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Isabella huffed, and the rage from earlier flickered in her eyes again. Phil genuinely expected her to retaliate.</p><p>But she took a few deep breaths and her shoulders deliberately relaxed as she stuck to her attempts to be sweet, maybe even <i>loving</i>. &ldquo;Of <i>course </i>I miss <i>you</i>.&rdquo; Isabella&rsquo;s eyes were wide and full of what Phil was sure was supposed to be innocence. &ldquo;I miss every single part of you, Danny.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil fought back a gag &mdash; he was pretty sure he knew what <i>that</i> meant, and the implication of it didn&rsquo;t sit well with him. </p><p>Maybe Phil&rsquo;s reaction, or Dan&rsquo;s silence, spurred her on, because Isabella continued talking. &ldquo;I miss spending time with you, I miss the way you used to hold me, and touch me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well too fucking bad,&rdquo; Dan said flippantly.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo; Isabella roared.</p><p>&ldquo;It means I don&rsquo;t want to ever fucking touch you again,&rdquo; Dan spat.</p><p>Isabella stepped closer, anger creeping back onto her face. &ldquo;I think you need a reminder of what you&rsquo;re missing.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t have time to prepare himself for what happened &mdash; and he doubted Dan did either.</p><p>Isabella launched herself forward, colliding with Dan and pressing her lips to his. </p><p>How fucking <i>dare</i> she? Phil&rsquo;s blood positively <i>boiled</i>. He <i>never</i> wanted to see Dan kiss someone else and now he was forced to stand here and watch Isabella glue her lips to Dan&rsquo;s. Isabella had <i>no</i> right to force herself on Dan, to kiss him when he didn&rsquo;t belong to her anymore. </p><p>Phil hadn&rsquo;t even had the opportunity to kiss Dan yet, but he still felt <i>so possessive</i> over him. </p><p>Dan was frozen for a split second, completely rigid and not moving. It felt like time stood still as Isabella insistently pressed her lips to a completely immobile Dan, and all Phil could do was <i>stare.</i></p><p>Something snapped in Dan, though, and Phil watched Dan&rsquo;s hands come up and land on her shoulders, forcefully pushing her away without hesitation.</p><p>&ldquo;What the <i>fuck</i> is wrong with you?&rdquo; Dan shouted. &ldquo;You have <i>no</i> right to kiss me. Get out of my fucking face <i>right fucking now</i>,&rdquo; Dan seethed. </p><p>Isabella recoiled from Dan&rsquo;s touch, flinching back and stumbling on her tall heels. She looked shocked, and the hurt and rage were both back in full force. In fact, she looked more livid, more crazed, than she had thus far. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo; Isabella screeched, her voice full of venom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to regret this, Dan Howell!&rdquo; </p><p>Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel sharply and marched towards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Unlikely!&rdquo; Dan roared after her, almost laughing as she stormed out the door.</p><p>Once Isabella was gone, the coffee shop fell into silence except for the sound of Dan&rsquo;s heavy breathing. Phil wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say, wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do. He felt like a lot of information &mdash; information he wasn&rsquo;t sure he was supposed to have &mdash; had just been dropped on him, and he didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t Phil&rsquo;s battle, and Isabella was nothing but his almost-boyfriend&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend, but he was <i>pissed</i>. Pissed about the degrading way Isabella had talked about <i>both</i> of their sexualities. Pissed about the fact that Isabella kissed Dan without his consent. Pissed about Isabella&rsquo;s attempts to justify her cheating and get Dan back.</p><p>And he couldn&rsquo;t even <i>begin</i> to fathom how Dan was feeling right now.</p><p>It took almost a full minute, but Dan&rsquo;s breathing eventually returned to normal, and he turned around, collapsing back on his stool.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Phil murmured when Dan looked up at him. &ldquo;That was&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A giant fucking shitshow?&rdquo; Dan raised his eyebrows and smiled humorously.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I was going to say &lsquo;unfair&rsquo;, but yeah, that works too.&rdquo; Phil offered Dan what he hoped was a reassuring smile. Phil <i>desperately</i> wanted to reach out and hold Dan&rsquo;s hand, run his fingers through Dan&rsquo;s hair. Something. <i>Anything</i>. </p><p>But Phil was hyper aware of the fact that they were in public &mdash; and that Isabella could come back in at any second &mdash; so he kept his hands to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry you had to see that,&rdquo; Dan said, sounding genuinely apologetic. </p><p>After all of <i>that</i>, how could Dan&rsquo;s first reaction be to apologize to Phil? </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always been too dramatic for her own good,&rdquo; Dan continued. &ldquo;Thank fuck there wasn&rsquo;t anyone else here today. But still, I&rsquo;m sorry you got roped into it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize, it&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo; Phil insisted, unable to understand why Dan was feeling guilty; there was nothing he could have done to stop it. Hell, Dan had tried to stop Isabella multiple times and she&rsquo;d just <i>kept going</i>. </p><p>Dan shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I mean, it sort of is. She&rsquo;s not, like, entirely wrong.&rdquo; He averted his eyes. </p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t know what to say, and wasn&rsquo;t one hundred percent sure which accusations Dan seemed to think Isabella had some grounds to make. He wanted to ask, he wanted to <i>push</i>. </p><p>But then again, after learning about Dan&rsquo;s album, and hearing the lyrics to the song he&rsquo;d written, Phil was fairly certain he could guess which accusation held some truth. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for the coffee,&rdquo; Dan muttered, looking back at Phil, &ldquo;But I think I&rsquo;m going to go home and have something a bit stronger.&rdquo; Shifting off of his stool, Dan went to walk away. </p><p>Phil wasn&rsquo;t ready for him to go yet, though. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;&rdquo; Phil said, grabbing Dan&rsquo;s arm before he could pull completely away. &ldquo;Let me buy you a drink. You can rant all you want to me if you feel like it.&rdquo; Phil realized that Dan might want to drop it and focus on something happier, so he softly added, &ldquo;Or not talk about it. Whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have, like, work?&rdquo; Dan asked, gesturing around the coffeeshop.</p><p>Phil glanced at the clock. </p><p>&ldquo;Eh, we&rsquo;re set to close in half an hour and it&rsquo;s been dead since those kids left.&rdquo; Phil shrugged with his free arm. &ldquo;I think we can afford to close early for one night.&rdquo; What Emmalee didn&rsquo;t know wouldn&rsquo;t hurt her.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes flickered down to his arm, which Phil was still holding onto. After only a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he nodded slowly. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; Yeah, okay. That sounds good.&rdquo; A shy smile grew on his face.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s lips twitched up into a small smile, relieved that Dan wanted to spend time with him despite still looking riled up from the fight. &ldquo;I need like ten minutes to close up. Why don&rsquo;t you grab a warmer coat in the meantime and then we can go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take your time.&rdquo; Dan smiled. &ldquo;Wanna just meet me upstairs when you&rsquo;re done? Maybe we can, um, have a drink at mine or something before we go out?&rdquo;</p><p>Without his consent, Phil&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up, betraying his surprise that Dan was <i>inviting him up to his apartment.</i></p><p>Phil wanted that though. He <i>really</i> wanted that.</p><p>&ldquo;A drink at yours sounds great,&rdquo; Phil agreed. A drink, a cuddle, a kiss. Whatever. </p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Dan said with a note of finality. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the building right next door. I&rsquo;m in apartment 701. I&rsquo;ll tell the doorman to let you in.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure, that works,&rdquo; Phil smiled softly. </p><p>Dan grinned back, lingering for moment before grabbing his light jacket. He pulled it on, not bothering to zip it up, and smiled &mdash; a smile that was filled with excitement and anxiety. </p><p>&ldquo;See you soon, Philly.&rdquo; Dan gave Phil a two-fingered salute and ducked out the door.</p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t waste any time in rinsing out Dan&rsquo;s mug and adding it to the dishwasher. The counters were clean, but he&rsquo;d never gotten around to wiping down the table that the uni students were at earlier. He grabbed a rag and the keys, planning to lock the door just in case anyone came. </p><p>Unfortunately, a customer walked in before Phil could make it to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, welcome! We&rsquo;re closing in ten minutes, so it&rsquo;s to-go orders only now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; the woman said.</p><p>&ldquo;Great! What can I get for you?&rdquo; Phil asked, not so subtly trying to hurry her along. Unfortunately for him, the lady was looking straight at the menu, and didn&rsquo;t even seem to be aware of Phil. Phil&rsquo;s heart sank. That didn&rsquo;t bode well.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I need just a minute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem! Just let me know when you&rsquo;re ready!&rdquo; Phil said in as chipper of a voice as he could manage and smiled a wide, fake grin despite the fact that he was very, <i>very</i> much annoyed.</p><p>Grabbing his phone, Phil hid it below the counter, and quickly texted Dan.</p><p><i>Sorry a customer just walked in so I might be a little bit longer. I told her we are only doing to-go orders though, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be that long.</i></p><p>Almost immediately, his phone lit up with a reply.</p><p><i>dw take your time</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just have a toasted crumpet, please,&rdquo; the lady finally said a moment later, thankfully quicker than Phil had honestly been expecting.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be right up!&rdquo; Phil replied quickly, and took the last crumpet from the display case in order to drop it in the toaster. Mentally, Phil urged the toaster to cook faster.</p><p>While the woman&rsquo;s order heated up, Phil glanced back at his phone and saw another message from Dan.</p><p><i>not too long though plz</i></p><p> Phil couldn&rsquo;t help the wide grin that spread across his face in response, because it was clear that Dan was just as impatient for <i>whatever</i> was about to happen as Phil was.</p><hr /><p><b>a/n: </b>come scream at me! i will wait to post asks with spoilers for 24 hours though :)&nbsp;</p>",
