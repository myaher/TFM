It could mean that they crave it even more. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamSansa?src=hash\">#<b>TeamSansa</b></a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SansaStark?src=hash\">#<b>SansaStark</b></a></i></p><p>The tweet was in response to an answer I received on a Quora question. The question was about Sansa\u2019s would-be wedding or coronation dress. A highly speculative question that I tossed up for fun. Because who doesn\u2019t like to speculate about what Sansa\u2019s dresses might look like. There were some great answers and not so great ones as is often the case with Quora.\u00a0You can read the question and answers <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-want-Sansa-Starks-final-dress-to-look-like-in-GoT-season-8-Do-you-think-it-will-be-a-wedding-dress-or-a-coronation-dress\">HERE</a>.</p><p>Of course, at least one person answered with the very tired idea of Sansa not wanting to get married because of everything she went through. My tweet was a much more diplomatic version of the thought that went through my head.\u00a0\u2018F-U just because a woman has been assaulted\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t want love. They literally have Littlefinger ask her\u00a0\u2018What do you want that you do not have?\u201d Answer\u201d\u00a0\u2018Love\u2019 you motherf*ckers.\u2019\u00a0</p><p>When did being assaulted, sexually or physically, become an impediment to wanting to find love or intimacy or marriage or family? For the record, Daenerys was also assaulted by her husband. And she seemed to be up for intimacy later on just fine. No one is saying Daenerys wouldn\u2019t want to marry anyone. But I digress, I\u2019m not here to stoke the flames of the Sansa v\u2019s Daenerys conversation.\u00a0</p><p>It might take a little more time and trust and a decent person. It is something that many want not in spite of their history with trauma but because of it. Casual dating or hooking up can feel scary to someone dealing with trauma. The idea of a trustworthy caring partner that can feel like a relief.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The song that plays when Sansa brings the Knights of the Vale to the BoTB is called\u00a0\u2018Trust Each Other\u2019. This is a sweeping epic track. Yet, the title refers to an act often more intimate, trust. Something Jon and Sansa need to do. They both need this. Sansa because of her abuse and Jon because he was betrayed by his own men. That\u2019s some heavy sh*t.\u00a0</p><p>Will Jon be the man that Sansa trusts enough to be intimate with? We can\u2019t say that for sure. I, of course, believe there is very strong evidence to suggest that he will. Trust is a running theme throughout their relationship. We see them grapple with asking for it, giving it, believing they have it from the other person.</p><p>Regardless of who the man she may marry is, Sansa\u2019s arc has long been tied to marriage and family. The pay off is not Sansa being alone. The pay off is Sansa finding that through it all she is in a place where she is able to choose for herself.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about how Sansa\u2019s costumes might help tell this story.\u00a0</p><p>The show by costuming Sansa very tightly wrapped in season 7 and presumably\u00a0again in season 8. with actual leather armor, Is trying to convey the idea that Sansa is protecting herself. No one is going to get in. No one is going to hurt her. I find it odd that this theme didn\u2019t come into play in the second half of season 6&hellip;but then there were different costume designers. Her look in season\u00a06 was about reclaiming her Stark identity.\u00a0 She spent most of the show trying to dress in Southron manner or as the Lady of Eyrie or in disguise when she traveled with Littlefinger. In season 5, we saw hints of Lyanna and Catelyn\u2019s looks in her costumes. It wasn\u2019t obvious and it didn\u2019t last long. And well once she married Ramsey we saw her hooded in grey, the girl in grey, a shadow or a ghost in Winterfell. The payoff\u00a0for all this was Sansa finally wearing the\u00a0\u2018wolf bit\u2019. Finally declaring her Starkness.</p><p>Well, some viewers might see the tightly wrapped and bound Sansa of season 7 to be indicative of how she will end her journey. They may think that in the end she will stay wrapped in her own version of armor not letting anyone in. But I ask, where is the pay off in that? There is none. There is no growth, no change. And what a heartwrenching ending for a character so tied to romance.\u00a0</p><p>The ties will be unbound, in her own time on her own terms and with the person of her choosing. The suffering and loss will never go away. There is bound to be more. That is the bittersweet part of the story. All this needless suffering. We weep for a girl who never should\u2019ve had to wrap herself in leather belts to feel safe in the first place. It\u2019s the same way we weep for ourselves. For the girls, we used to be. The girls we were before assaults and abuse marked us.\u00a0 For Sansa, the armor will come off. It must. Because that is a dream of spring. Because why else have we been watching this\u00a0\u2018d*mn\u2019 show.\u00a0</p>",

The pay off is Sansa finding that through it all she is in a place where she is able to choose for herself.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how Sansa&rsquo;s costumes might help tell this story.&nbsp;</p><p>The show by costuming Sansa very tightly wrapped in season 7 and presumably&nbsp;again in season 8. with actual leather armor, Is trying to convey the idea that Sansa is protecting herself. No one is going to get in. No one is going to hurt her. I find it odd that this theme didn&rsquo;t come into play in the second half of season 6&hellip;but then there were different costume designers. Her look in season&nbsp;6 was about reclaiming her Stark identity.&nbsp; She spent most of the show trying to dress in Southron manner or as the Lady of Eyrie or in disguise when she traveled with Littlefinger. In season 5, we saw hints of Lyanna and Catelyn&rsquo;s looks in her costumes. It wasn&rsquo;t obvious and it didn&rsquo;t last long. And well once she married Ramsey we saw her hooded in grey, the girl in grey, a shadow or a ghost in Winterfell. The payoff&nbsp;for all this was Sansa finally wearing the&nbsp;&lsquo;wolf bit&rsquo;. Finally declaring her Starkness.</p><p>Well, some viewers might see the tightly wrapped and bound Sansa of season 7 to be indicative of how she will end her journey. They may think that in the end she will stay wrapped in her own version of armor not letting anyone in. But I ask, where is the pay off in that? There is none. There is no growth, no change. And what a heartwrenching ending for a character so tied to romance.&nbsp;</p><p>The ties will be unbound, in her own time on her own terms and with the person of her choosing. The suffering and loss will never go away. There is bound to be more. That is the bittersweet part of the story. All this needless suffering. We weep for a girl who never should&rsquo;ve had to wrap herself in leather belts to feel safe in the first place. It&rsquo;s the same way we weep for ourselves. For the girls, we used to be. The girls we were before assaults and abuse marked us.&nbsp; For Sansa, the armor will come off. It must. Because that is a dream of spring. Because why else have we been watching this&nbsp;&lsquo;d*mn&rsquo; show.&nbsp;</p>",

He focussed on the sky just left of Sansa&rsquo;s face so intensely that Sansa\nwas tempted to turn around to check if Daenerys&rsquo; dragon had taken so the sky.\nBut there was nothing to see. It was a sunny day, if cold, and the sky was\nspotless.</p><p>&ldquo;If Jon\nwere here, it would have come to a fight.&rdquo;, Bran answered finally. &ldquo;I thought\nthat would be obvious.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa threw\nher hands in the air.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly,\nBran,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish you would share more of what you want and what you\nplan.&rdquo; </p><p>Bran gave\nher a smile, one of his new smiles that looked as if he just remembered how to\nmove the muscles in his face, and nothing more. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so\nsorry, Sansa. The future is a shifting river. A small thing I tell you might\ncause a maelstrom that carries us all to our death.&rdquo;</p><p>He gazed at\nhis lap. Sansa glanced at her brother, but he did not carry on. </p><p>&ldquo;I suggested\nnegotiations on a whim,&rdquo; she finally said. &ldquo;I just wanted to buy time. What do\nI even have to offer her? Apart from not blowing her up.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;She must\nknow that I cannot possibly carry through with this threat. We would destroy\nWinterfell.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran looked\nup again. &ldquo;You insist that I tell you something?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa\nlooked at him, and exasperation crept into her voice. &ldquo;Bran, you are a seer, I\ncould use some counsel.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran was\nsilent for such a long time, that Sansa contemplated turning on her heels. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell her,\nI&rsquo;ll give her a glimpse into the future, if she renews her promise to fight\nagainst the Walkers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that\nwill make her come around?&rdquo;</p><p>Bran\nshrugged. &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>A twinkle\nentered his eye. &ldquo;If she wants a marriage alliance, tell her I&rsquo;m available.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa\nlaughed despite herself. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know her.&rdquo;</p><p>The twinkle\nleft Bran&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I saw enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So that is\nyour counsel?&rdquo;, Sansa asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nneed to tell you to be careful, nor how to negotiate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you\ntell me whom I should take with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take Ser\nJaime and Arya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will she\nnot be angry if Jaime is with us?&rdquo; she wanted to know. </p><p>&ldquo;Jaime\ncould bring Tyrion around, if he happens to mention that he has no ambition to\nget Casterly Rock any longer. And he is a better choice than Brienne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why Arya?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If anything\ngoes wrong, she&rsquo;ll be there to avenge you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I ever\ntell you that you have become so comforting,&rdquo; Sansa told him.</p><p>&ldquo;Only a few\nthings are comforting in these times.&rdquo; Bran turned, his intent clearly on the\nweirwood.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, if\nyou excuse me. I have to plan.&rdquo; His hand hovered near the trunk of the\nweirwood.</p><p>Sansa glanced\nat him, half annoyed and half worried. She turned to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;One last\nthing,&rdquo; Bran called after her.</p><p>&ldquo;Do not\nunder any circumstances mention your condition, but I guess you know that.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa felt\nthe blood rising to her face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not\neven sure yet,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I just became suspicious this morning. My moon\nblood is only a few days late. Do you see everything?&rdquo;</p><p>Bran\nshrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t linger on unimportant things. There are quite a lot of\nchildren in your future, that is, if we have a future. How you get them is none\nof my business.&rdquo;</p>",

And these WW are monsters with superhuman strength, who can toss you across the room with a single hit, whose touch alone can freeze your weapons, and as the NK showed, they may even be able to turn you into one of them even if you're alive (the offered baby).
