She held you closely as she paused, hovering high up in the sky as you stared at the sun over the horizon. Surrounded by nothing but trees and mountains. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me go,&rdquo; you whispered. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; She kissed just beside your ear. </p><p><br /></p><p>She then took you to a mountain top, to watch the stars as they sparkled in the dark. But they weren&rsquo;t what was captivating. It was Carol. It was always Carol. She was pointing out constellations and telling stories of planets far far away. The woman of your dreams really knows how to get you to fall deeper in love with you and you were more than willing to let it happen. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",
