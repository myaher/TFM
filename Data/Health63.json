Any donation, no matter how seemingly small, is going to go a long way towards helping his family out.\u00a0</p><p><b>Khaled\u2019s Story</b></p><p>Khaled is a bright, funny and compassionate twenty-year-old, who, until recently, was in his first year studying an undergraduate&rsquo;s degree in Business at Wolverhampton University. He has a loving family and girlfriend, and enjoys playing football with his friends. </p><p>He also has Hodgkins Lymphoma- an agressive and complex form of cancer that affects, on average, 1 in 360 men at some point in their lifetimes. </p><p>Khaled received his cancer diagnosis after visiting his doctor multiple times complaining of what he believed to be reoccuring tonsillitis. Within a week, he was scheduled to have his first round of chemotherapy. Always upbeat, Khaled is now a popular patient at the cancer clinic, is always joking with the nurses and never stops smiling, despite, quite understandably, being concerned about what the next few years will hold. </p><p><b>What will your money do for Khaled?</b></p><p>With the main breadwinner being made redundant recently, Khaled&rsquo;s family of six has, until this point, been living off Khaled and his older brother&rsquo;s student loans.

All contributions will be gratefully received, no matter how small, and will go a long way to help make an already stressful situation easier by providing Khaled the peace of mind that his family are provided for, meaning he can concentrate on his recovery.</p>",

I\u2019ve reblogged many crowdfunding pages during the last six years I\u2019ve been on here, each with thousands of notes, and I\u2019m now here to ask if you could show some love for Khaled; Khaled has been dating my best friend for over a year, and he\u2019s in a tricky situation right now. Any donation, no matter how seemingly small, is going to go a long way towards helping his family out.\u00a0</p><p><b>Khaled\u2019s Story</b></p><p>Khaled is a bright, funny and compassionate twenty-year-old, who, until recently, was in his first year studying an undergraduate\u2019s degree in Business at Wolverhampton University. He has a loving family and girlfriend, and enjoys playing football with his friends. </p><p>He also has Hodgkins Lymphoma- an agressive and complex form of cancer that affects, on average, 1 in 360 men at some point in their lifetimes. </p><p>Khaled received his cancer diagnosis after visiting his doctor multiple times complaining of what he believed to be reoccuring tonsillitis. Within a week, he was scheduled to have his first round of chemotherapy. Always upbeat, Khaled is now a popular patient at the cancer clinic, is always joking with the nurses and never stops smiling, despite, quite understandably, being concerned about what the next few years will hold. </p><p><b>What will your money do for Khaled?</b></p><p>With the main breadwinner being made redundant recently, Khaled\u2019s family of six has, until this point, been living off Khaled and his older brother\u2019s student loans. Khaled has had to drop out of university and, therefore, is no longer entitled to student loan, cutting the family\u2019s income by half. </p><p>Any donation you can make will help pay for basic necessities like groceries, taxi fares to help get Khaled to and from his chemo appointments, and help his family keep on top of household bills. All contributions will be gratefully received, no matter how small, and will go a long way to help make an already stressful situation easier by providing Khaled the peace of mind that his family are provided for, meaning he can concentrate on his recovery.</p>",

Recently my mother was diagnosed with diabetes and I had my own \u201cpre-diabetic\u201d scare. I was also diagnosed with PCOS and some mental illness. I\u2019ve been eating the recommended diabetic carb intake since 9/12/18. I have also been a vegetarian for seven years now and I\u2019m allergic to gluten. I have a long way to go and wanted to keep a blog of my journey! Even if I\u2019m the only one reading this I want to be able to look back on my progress. However, I hope you come along for the ride and get something out of this! :)</p>",
