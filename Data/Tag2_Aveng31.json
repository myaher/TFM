After she\u2019s gone, Tony Stark asks if she had family they should notify, and it\u2019s pointed out again that the Avengers were the only ones she called family. All of this adds up to make it seem that Natasha\u2019s only true value was in loving the Avengers (and Clint) enough to be willing to take that leap for all of them.\n\n<br/></i></p></blockquote><p>Carol, Okoye, &amp; Wanda:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nCarol is brilliant throughout </i>Endgame<i>, but she\u2019s also underused because she\u2019s not been given any time at all to acclimate to the group setting. This is not her farewell tour, so she only shows up in special bursts, powered by fists of space-energy and little else. The same is true of Okoye, who Marvel rightfully gave top billing to, but never the screen time to match. Wanda Maximoff also shows up briefly to flex her extraordinarily powerful magic muscles, but her only stake in the film is being pissed with Thanos for killing her boyfriend Vision. All her fury gets her nowhere, which is hardly surprising because these films have never known what to do with someone as powerful as the Scarlet Witch is meant to be. She\u2019s always getting sidelined because dealing with her true skillset would make most of the other combatants seem superfluous. \n\n<br/></i></p></blockquote><p>Gamora &amp; Nebula:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nGamora and Nebula are pulled through the wringer and then some in </i>Endgame<i>, the former already dead and brought back from her past, the latter forced to confront an earlier and far crueler version of herself that she eventually murders. [&hellip;] Both Nebula and Gamora are extremely important to the plot of Endgame, with Nebula\u2019s appearance in the past accidentally notifying Thanos as to the Avengers\u2019 plans, and Gamora\u2019s decision to trust the future version of her sister being integral to the success of said plans. But the film seems to forget them once things get heated up; one brief re-meet of Peter Quill and Gamora disappears to who knows where, with Nebula left behind to hitch a ride again with the Guardians. We have no idea if the two said a proper goodbye to one another, or how they are both feeling now that they have to relearn their relationship all over again.\n\n<br/></i></p></blockquote><p>Valkyrie:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nBy the end, Thor abdicates the throne in her favor, noting that she has already been doing the job for him, and that she\u2019s an excellent leader. These things are true, but Valkyrie also expressed a hatred of Asgardian monarchy when Thor met her first. And more to the point, no matter how good Val is at steering their people, she is essentially being made to shoulder Thor\u2019s burden simply because he has decided he can\u2019t handle it anymore. Rather than offering to help her set up a new form of government, or see that the transition of power goes smoothly, he just up and leaves all of his responsibilities on her plate.\n\n<br/></i></p></blockquote><p>Peggy:</p><blockquote><p><i>While we\u2019re supposed to be happy for Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter finally getting their dance on at the end of this, it\u2019s hard not to be a little insulted over all the film is choosing to ignore in that tender moment. It is unclear if any of Peggy\u2019s former trials will come to pass with Steve Rogers back in her life, and the idea of all of her adventures\u2014in her own series </i>Agent Carter<i> and beyond\u2014being overwritten for a life in a cute suburb with her man is frankly just as depressing as them losing one another. Peggy Carter claims to know her value, but in this moment, it\u2019s hard to tell if the MCU knows it, or if they ever cared about it at all. Love is truly grand, but shoehorning Peggy in there for a kiss when we get no time with her at all feels like a particular kind of cheat.\n\n<br/></i></p></blockquote><p>Pepper &amp; Morgan:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n[Heroic death] is one of fiction\u2019s favorite noble ends, and it often sees a woman and a child who have to move on without a father and partner. And while it is great that Tony got to have some time with his daughter, she\u2019s barely five years old, which means that her memory of him is bound to get fuzzy as she gets older. She is cheated out of that relationship while Pepper is left alone, after spending years panicked for Tony\u2019s safety and well-being. It is the ending that Iron Man perhaps deserves, but it is not the ending that his family deserves, and there\u2019s no way around that plain truth. But we\u2019re conditioned to accept this as good and heroic tragedy, full of sorrow and therefore meaningful, rather than asking why these are always the people who pay the price for that heroism.\n\n</i><br/></p></blockquote>",

                "content": "<p><p>I figured I would share this article in general since it does such a good job summing up many of the quibbles I had with <i>Endgame </i>with regard to its treatment of female characters.&nbsp;</p><p>The article covers how the film handles Natasha, Carol, Okoye, Wanda, Gamora, Nebula, Valkyrie, Peggy, Pepper, and Morgan&ndash;and how it fails all of them. Here&rsquo;s some choice quotes from the piece, but I highly encourage reading the whole thing for better context.&nbsp;</p><p>Natasha:<br /></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nNatasha&rsquo;s inability to have children renders her&mdash;in the eyes of the narrative, and in her own summation&mdash;&ldquo;less valuable&rdquo; in terms of survival. After she&rsquo;s gone, Tony Stark asks if she had family they should notify, and it&rsquo;s pointed out again that the Avengers were the only ones she called family. All of this adds up to make it seem that Natasha&rsquo;s only true value was in loving the Avengers (and Clint) enough to be willing to take that leap for all of them.\n\n<br /></i></p></blockquote><p>Carol, Okoye, &amp; Wanda:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nCarol is brilliant throughout </i>Endgame<i>, but she&rsquo;s also underused because she&rsquo;s not been given any time at all to acclimate to the group setting. This is not her farewell tour, so she only shows up in special bursts, powered by fists of space-energy and little else. The same is true of Okoye, who Marvel rightfully gave top billing to, but never the screen time to match. Wanda Maximoff also shows up briefly to flex her extraordinarily powerful magic muscles, but her only stake in the film is being pissed with Thanos for killing her boyfriend Vision. All her fury gets her nowhere, which is hardly surprising because these films have never known what to do with someone as powerful as the Scarlet Witch is meant to be. She&rsquo;s always getting sidelined because dealing with her true skillset would make most of the other combatants seem superfluous. \n\n<br /></i></p></blockquote><p>Gamora &amp; Nebula:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nGamora and Nebula are pulled through the wringer and then some in </i>Endgame<i>, the former already dead and brought back from her past, the latter forced to confront an earlier and far crueler version of herself that she eventually murders. [&hellip;] Both Nebula and Gamora are extremely important to the plot of Endgame, with Nebula&rsquo;s appearance in the past accidentally notifying Thanos as to the Avengers&rsquo; plans, and Gamora&rsquo;s decision to trust the future version of her sister being integral to the success of said plans. But the film seems to forget them once things get heated up; one brief re-meet of Peter Quill and Gamora disappears to who knows where, with Nebula left behind to hitch a ride again with the Guardians. We have no idea if the two said a proper goodbye to one another, or how they are both feeling now that they have to relearn their relationship all over again.\n\n<br /></i></p></blockquote><p>Valkyrie:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nBy the end, Thor abdicates the throne in her favor, noting that she has already been doing the job for him, and that she&rsquo;s an excellent leader. These things are true, but Valkyrie also expressed a hatred of Asgardian monarchy when Thor met her first. And more to the point, no matter how good Val is at steering their people, she is essentially being made to shoulder Thor&rsquo;s burden simply because he has decided he can&rsquo;t handle it anymore. Rather than offering to help her set up a new form of government, or see that the transition of power goes smoothly, he just up and leaves all of his responsibilities on her plate.\n\n<br /></i></p></blockquote><p>Peggy:</p><blockquote><p><i>While we&rsquo;re supposed to be happy for Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter finally getting their dance on at the end of this, it&rsquo;s hard not to be a little insulted over all the film is choosing to ignore in that tender moment. It is unclear if any of Peggy&rsquo;s former trials will come to pass with Steve Rogers back in her life, and the idea of all of her adventures&mdash;in her own series </i>Agent Carter<i> and beyond&mdash;being overwritten for a life in a cute suburb with her man is frankly just as depressing as them losing one another. Peggy Carter claims to know her value, but in this moment, it&rsquo;s hard to tell if the MCU knows it, or if they ever cared about it at all. Love is truly grand, but shoehorning Peggy in there for a kiss when we get no time with her at all feels like a particular kind of cheat.\n\n<br /></i></p></blockquote><p>Pepper &amp; Morgan:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n[Heroic death] is one of fiction&rsquo;s favorite noble ends, and it often sees a woman and a child who have to move on without a father and partner. And while it is great that Tony got to have some time with his daughter, she&rsquo;s barely five years old, which means that her memory of him is bound to get fuzzy as she gets older. She is cheated out of that relationship while Pepper is left alone, after spending years panicked for Tony&rsquo;s safety and well-being.
