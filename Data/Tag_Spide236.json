Right now, it&rsquo;s only a few minutes until you&rsquo;re going to do your first mini stunt together. Since you play the love interest of Peter Parker, you&rsquo;ll both swing through the air a few times in Spiderman Far from Home. In a few minutes you&rsquo;re going to be held by Tom as you &ldquo;swing through the air&rdquo; together. </p><p>You don&rsquo;t know if your more terrified or happy. You&rsquo;ll be held by a rope and held by Tom, but you&rsquo;re still have your fear of heights and stunts in general. At the same time, you&rsquo;re a little proud of yourself to be doing this and playing a role in a Marvel movie. Even though you have mixed emotions about it all, the fans standing behind fences filming you, scream to you, supporting you every single day, keep you motivated. The fans is the ones who makes you keep going, and you enjoy trying out new things for them to enjoy. </p><p>The director comes over to you and Tom, which makes your heart beat quicken up.</p><p>&ldquo;Alight. Tom, you can stand right here.&rdquo; He says as Tom follows his lead.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be holing Y/N with one hand and hold on to the rope with the other.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom nods as he turns his head to you. You&rsquo;re a bit shaky, but it&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re going to be fine. </p><p>&ldquo;You ready love?&rdquo; Tom ask you with a soft voice.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t see his face but know he&rsquo;s smiling. He&rsquo;s been talking about the stunt for days. He, flying trough the air holding his girlfriend in his arms. What a wonderful feeling, how romantic. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; You let a fake smile appear on your lips. </p><p>Suddenly Tom places his hand on your hip and drag you close to his body. You quickly got the feeling of comfort.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be ok darling. I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo; Tom whispers in your ear, which gives you chills.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t deserve your amazing and caring boyfriend. He was always supporting you and making you feel comfortable in every situation. He was the best thing that could happen to you.</p><p>All you did was close your eyes and take a deep breath, leaning your head against his shoulder. As everyone were almost ready in their positions, you and Tom got ready too. He reached for the rope as he squatted, for you to sit on his lap. You soon placed your hands around his shoulder and your legs around his waist. He must be incredibly strong to stand like this while holding you. Damn!</p><p>&ldquo;Ok everyone, get ready!&rdquo; The director yelled and got into his own position. </p><p>The fans watching you were quieter now, exited to see you in action. Even though the move were to come out in almost 365 days, all of them were really excited already. You couldn&rsquo;t wait to lay in bed and watch all the videos recorded of you and Tom on set, with the other cast members. It&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve always enjoyed. You even follow a few fan accounts on Instagram. </p><p>The shot would start in a few seconds and everyone and you got into your role. You felt confident and ready to do you first stunt ever. What could possibly go wrong now?</p><p>&ldquo;And ACTION!&rdquo; The producer yelled.</p><p>The extras started walking around. Suddenly, you felt the ground disappear and your body becoming heavier. You were dragged up in the air, feeling the wind hit your face and your stomach tickling. It was wonderful and weird at the same time. </p><p>Then the unexpected happened. You could hear a loud uncomfortable crack and a few people gasping loudly. You weren&rsquo;t sure what happened, but it before you knew it people were shouting as Tom panicked. He lost the grip of you as your rope were completely broken. Only a second later you were falling towards the ground. Fans yelled, and everyone were looking at you. Suddenly, everything became black. </p><p>___</p><p>Tom landed safely on the ground as a few people rushed over to you. Your lifeless body were covered in wounds and blood. You literally hit the hard asphalt after a fall of five meters over ground. Could you even survive that?</p><p>Tom ran over to you in such a hurry, almost tripping, and quickly dragged of his mask. He looked devastated, his heart beating faster than a full speed racket. He couldn&rsquo;t speak. All he did was falling to his knees, shaking, crying. Looking like a hot mess, knowing he couldn&rsquo;t touch you. It would be risky to touch you if you had any broke bones. </p><p>&ldquo;We need to get her to a hospital! Quick!&rdquo; Someone shouted. </p><p>Not long after, you were in an ambulance driving towards the nearest hospital, leaving the cast, fans and everyone else worried and crying, devastated. &nbsp;The happening would-be all-over media in a few seconds. It didn&rsquo;t matter with your life at stake. Were you going to survive?</p><p>_____</p><p>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING!
