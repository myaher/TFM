No no no no no! </p><p>And even though he knew that, he looked so peaceful, almost happy, surrounded by the blood that gave such a huge contrast to his light skin.

How could he? How could he accept that his love would jump infront of hi- it was his fault. The revelation was like a punch in the face and he stared into the nothingness for a few moments, just before the guilt kicked in. And the tears found no end.

He had to be saved by someone else, even though it was <i>his fucking job</i> to save others\u2026</p><p>And when Eijirou acknowledged, that his boyfriend wasn\u2019t even breathing anymore, only one thing was left on his mind:</p><p> \u2018<i>I\u2019m sorry.

A whole riot took place around him and he couldn&rsquo;t move a single muscle. Everything hurt, his mind was screaming, but his body didn&rsquo;t take any orders. He was frozen in place while his friends, his <i>partner</i>, were fighting at their hardest.<br /></p><p>Just moments ago he was fighting among them, defending the school and the already hurt people around him, but at his only moment of negligence -</p><p>All he felt was pain. A sharp pain that made everything blurry; that made everything seem so unreal. And he stopped dead in his tracks, not being able to move. The pain was overwhelming, clouding his mind and he didn&rsquo;t know what was happening. He couldn&rsquo;t even pinpoint the location where he was hit; it hurt fucking everywhere! </p><p>Being a hero meant to put his life on the line, but how could he die, when he didn&rsquo;t save anyone yet? He was supposed to be a hero! Not some weakling who would cry out because of pain, who&rsquo;d stop fighting because he hurt! But he still couldn&rsquo;t move. He still couldn&rsquo;t step forward, activate his quirk and fucking blew everyone up that wanted to hurt his friends!!</p><p>And that was, when he saw Eijirou. His partner, his <i>love</i>! Fighting like there was no tomorrow; fighting to protect everything they stood for. Katsuki just wanted to <i>help</i>. Why couldn&rsquo;t he move? Why couldn&rsquo;t he fight?!</p><p>With everything that was left in him, he took one step forward, only one motivation clear on his mind: <i>protect</i>. He needed to fight. Everything after that didn&rsquo;t matter. But they needed him <i>now</i>.</p><p>So he fought. With teeth and claws and fire. His quirk going rampage and even though it blasted the skin off of his already bruised hands, he kept fighting. This was a fight he <i>needed</i> to win.
