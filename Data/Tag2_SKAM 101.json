They were obviously very curious about what happened last night, so Lucas tried his best to remember that messy chaos. He told them about getting basically shitfaced, which they already suspected, then about the guy he started making out with, and of course it was Yann giving him the disapproving father look for doing something so reckless. Then he finished his speech with Eliott heroic arrival.</p><p>\u201cAfter that I really don\u2019t remember anything. I don\u2019t know if I threw up on him or in my apartment at all, I don\u2019t know where he slept, because he was in my kitchen when I woke up&hellip;\u201d he explained and looked at his friends. All of them were really invested in his story, like it was the best gossip they ever heard. Lucas sighed.\u00a0\u201cAny questions?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say he has a girlfriend?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo he slept at your place?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat happened this morning?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs he still in your apartment?\u201d<br/></p><p>All those sudden questions came right into Lucas\u2019 face and he didn\u2019t had the time to answer them, cause his phone was buzzing in his pocket. He excused himself for a minute, getting up from the floor where he was sitting and walking to the window, picking up. It was an unknown number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLucas, am I interrupting?\u201d said a really soft voice from the other side of the line. Lucas\u2019 heart skipped a beat, just hearing Eliott was enough for him to feel better. He smiled like an idiot.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow did you get my number?\u201d he asked, leaning to the wall as he looked out of the window.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI have very special skills.\u201d the other boy replied and Lucas could hear his annoying grin forming on his face.\u00a0\u201cSo, am I interrupting?\u201d he asked.\u00a0\u201cI tried to go to your place, but it looks like you\u2019re not here.\u201d he explained. Lucas felt guilty and happy at the same time. He totally forgot to tell Eliott that he will spend a few hours with his friends, not like he owed him any explanations, but it was really sweet of Eliott wanting to meet up.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with my friends right now, but we can meet up a bit later if you want to.\u201d he offered with a soft smile. He already missed Eliott, though they were together a couple hours ago.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSounds cool. We should grab a coffee.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCoffee sounds good.\u201d Lucas said. He wished Eliott to be there with him, playing with his hair like in the morning. He just got shivers just by thinking about that moment. He never felt anything like this before, Eliott was really special.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo&hellip; in an hour maybe? I still gotta finish some sketches for this project, but after that I\u2019m free all day.\u201d he said with a little excitement in his voice, that warmed up Lucas\u2019 chest.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Let\u2019s meet up in front of the building, okay?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSure, see you then.\u201d he said and hung up. Lucas put away his phone and turned to his friends, being surprised that all three of them were watching him like he was some sort of rare animal. Basile kept chewing on pizza, but the others were staring at him, mouth slightly open. It was Yann who broke the awkward silence.<br/></p><p>\u201cDude, I\u2019ve never seen you being so smooth before.\u201d he said impressed.\u00a0\u201cI mean with Sara and Chlo\u00e9 you were smooth, but this is way more different.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou really fucking like this guy, don\u2019t you?\u201d Arthur asked, his lips starting to form a grin. Lucas sighed and sat back down to the floor, grabbing a slice of pizza.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious, we are just&hellip; flirting with each other.\u201d he finished his sentence a bit unsure, since he couldn\u2019t really describe the thing they had between each other. It was like there were special magnets inside their bodies that only reacted to each other, pulling them closer with sheer force. When Eliott was with him, he felt safe, he felt like he was his true self and could\u00a0 tell anything to him\u00a0without being afraid.</p><p>\u201cJust <i>flirting</i>?\u201d Arthur asked mockingly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCan we drop the topic now?\u201d Lucas sighed, shoving the pizza into his face, enoying every flavor on it. It was relieving to eat something delicious after Eliott\u2019s horrible try to cook this morning.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Thursday 17:14</b></p><p>Lucas was tired, his friends were obviously nice, caring and funny, but they could be too much at once, especially when they wanted to know something. He tried to tell them what happened in the morning as short as possible, because he kinda wanted to keep things to himself, like the way Eliott looked at him, his soft touches, the almost kiss and then his forehead kiss before he left. The feelings were so overwhelming, he felt like his heart would burst out of his chest when he sees Eliott again.</p><p>He got off the bus, walking towards the building he was living in, he was listening to some music through earphones, trying to close out the world and his thoughts of Eliott. He was everywhere in his head, which wasn\u2019t too bad, but Lucas needed time to breathe, which was really hard when you keep thinking of your crush.</p><p>Eliott was sitting on a bench in front of the apartment, looking at his phone. He fought back the urge to text Lucas. It was a hard thing to do, but he was successful in the last 20 minutes since he was sitting there. He finished his job kinda quickly, so after he couldn\u2019t find himself anything to do in his home, he decided to sit in the sunshine, enjoying the warmth, while waiting for his adorable neighbor to finally come home.\u00a0</p><p>He noticed him from far away, Lucas was wearing black jeans and a navy blue jacket with a giant, grey scarf in his neck. Eliott didn\u2019t even realize that the weather was windy, he wasn\u2019t cold at all, even if he was wearing jeans, a shirt and a warm sweater, He got up, smiling brightly when he saw that Lucas noticed him, putting away the earphones while walking.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said happily when Lucas was close enough to hear.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lucas said, he smiled softly. Eliott was really attractive even in sunshine, his hair was all over the place like always, but it looked much more lighter colored in the sunlight than in the apartment.\u00a0\u201cHow are you?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, finished my project now, so everything is fantastic.\u201d Eliott said, taking a step towards Lucas.\u00a0\u201cShall we go?\u201d he asked, trying to fight back the urge to touch Lucas, failing miserably. His hands moved before he could think, slowly stroking away some stray hair from the other\u2019s eyes. It was a short moment, but both of them took a sharp breath, not moving for a half minute. Then Lucas, as the brave, chaotic gay boy he is grabbed Eliott\u2019s hand, intertwining their fingers.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go.\u2019 he said with a confident smile, as he saw how happily Eliott looked at their hands.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Thursday 18:46</b></p><p>After their\u00a0\u201cdate\u201d in the coffee shop, Lucas and Eliott went out to the park for a romantic walk. It started to get dark, but not too much. The air was much colder than it was earlier, so they were holding each others hands, while they hide their free hands in their pockets to keep them warm. Since it was the middle of the week and also kinda late, the boys were almost alone in the park.</p><p>They talked about so many things in the last few hours, Eliott told Lucas how they were together with Lucille for years, then they decided to end the relationship, because neither of them were happy, but they stayed friends, because they knew one another better than anyone.\u00a0</p><p>Lucas talked about his hard years at high school, trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with him, before accepting his sexuality. He told Eliott how hard it was for him to come out, that not everything went smooth like in the movies, but his friends were just really supportive, helping him through the tough days. It was heartwarming to remember the reaction of Basile and Arthur. Also the enthusiasm of Daphn\u00e9 and the girls. He was lucky to have such good friends around him.</p><p>They arrived home late, Eliott\u2019s nose and cheeks were red because of the cold outside, but it made him look kinda cute. Lucas took off his scarf as soon as they stepped into the building. Now they were standing on the hallway, in front of their doors, not knowing what to do. Neither of them wanted to leave, this was just too good to end.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, this is where we say Good night.\u201d Eliott said after long minutes of silence. He had to say something, he couldn\u2019t just walk inside the apartment with Lucas.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna say Good night yet.\u201d Lucas said seriously, playing with the scarf in his hands. His face felt warm because of the blush that appeared on it. He couldn\u2019t say anything else, but this was more than enough.<br/></p><p>Eliott only hesitated for a few seconds before he pulled Lucas closer by his waist, pressing his lips on his gently. The kiss started off softly, Lucas wrapped his arms around Eliott\u2019s neck, standing on his tiptoes to make the position comfortable. They were playing for minutes before Eliott started to lick Lucas\u2019 lips, asking him to open it. That was more than enough, Lucas slowly opened his mouth to let Eliott\u2019s greedy and wild tongue inside.\u00a0</p><p>The kiss became much more intense and before Lucas could even realize it, Eliott pushed him to the door of his own apartment, holding his waist strongly. His fingers were wandering under the jacket, touching Lucas\u2019 skin. It was hard to focus his thoughts when such an attractive person tried to baisically fuck him with his clothes on in the middle of the hallway. Lucas played with Eliott\u2019s hair, enjoying the wild dance their tongue was doing at the moment, also enjoying the long, cold fingers touching his back and stomach.</p><p>Finally Lucas had the strength to pull his hands away from Eliott\u2019s hair, breaking their kiss with a soft smile. Eliott looked at him like a lost puppy. Their lips were red and swollen, but damn if his neighbour didn\u2019t look hot like this. Hair even more messy than usual, thanks to Lucas\u2019 wandering fingers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou wanna sleep at my place?\u201d he asked suddenly with all the bravery he had. Eliott smiled like the cute angel he was, stroking Lucas\u2019 cheek, kissing his lips again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d he said happily, planting another quick kiss on those swollen lips.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss the chance.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lucas mumbled, unable to form normal sentences when the tall boy was being so damn charming. He managed to open the front door before they started to make out again, much more wildly now.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Their way to the bedroom was chaotic as their tried to walk, kiss and undress at the same time. Sometimes they giggled at how stupidly they must look like. When they finally made it to Lucas\u2019 bed, they were only wearing shirts and briefs. Their hands were everywhere on each other, taking in everything, like they only have limited time to enjoy each others company, while in fact they had all the time in the world.\u00a0</p>",

Eliott looked at him like a lost puppy. Their lips were red and swollen, but damn if his neighbour didn\u2019t look hot like this. Hair even more messy than usual, thanks to Lucas\u2019 wandering fingers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou wanna sleep at my place?\u201d he asked suddenly with all the bravery he had. Eliott smiled like the cute angel he was, stroking Lucas\u2019 cheek, kissing his lips again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d he said happily, planting another quick kiss on those swollen lips.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss the chance.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lucas mumbled, unable to form normal sentences when the tall boy was being so damn charming. He managed to open the front door before they started to make out again, much more wildly now.\u00a0<br></p><p>Their way to the bedroom was chaotic as their tried to walk, kiss and undress at the same time. Sometimes they giggled at how stupidly they must look like. When they finally made it to Lucas\u2019 bed, they were only wearing shirts and briefs. Their hands were everywhere on each other, taking in everything, like they only have limited time to enjoy each others company, while in fact they had all the time in the world.\u00a0</p>",

They were obviously very curious about what happened last night, so Lucas tried his best to remember that messy chaos. He told them about getting basically shitfaced, which they already suspected, then about the guy he started making out with, and of course it was Yann giving him the disapproving father look for doing something so reckless. Then he finished his speech with Eliott heroic arrival.</p><p>\u201cAfter that I really don\u2019t remember anything. I don\u2019t know if I threw up on him or in my apartment at all, I don\u2019t know where he slept, because he was in my kitchen when I woke up\u2026\u201d he explained and looked at his friends. All of them were really invested in his story, like it was the best gossip they ever heard. Lucas sighed.\u00a0\u201cAny questions?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say he has a girlfriend?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo he slept at your place?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened this morning?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs he still in your apartment?\u201d<br></p><p>All those sudden questions came right into Lucas\u2019 face and he didn\u2019t had the time to answer them, cause his phone was buzzing in his pocket. He excused himself for a minute, getting up from the floor where he was sitting and walking to the window, picking up. It was an unknown number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLucas, am I interrupting?\u201d said a really soft voice from the other side of the line. Lucas\u2019 heart skipped a beat, just hearing Eliott was enough for him to feel better. He smiled like an idiot.<br></p><p>\u201cHow did you get my number?\u201d he asked, leaning to the wall as he looked out of the window.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI have very special skills.\u201d the other boy replied and Lucas could hear his annoying grin forming on his face.\u00a0\u201cSo, am I interrupting?\u201d he asked.\u00a0\u201cI tried to go to your place, but it looks like you\u2019re not here.\u201d he explained. Lucas felt guilty and happy at the same time. He totally forgot to tell Eliott that he will spend a few hours with his friends, not like he owed him any explanations, but it was really sweet of Eliott wanting to meet up.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with my friends right now, but we can meet up a bit later if you want to.\u201d he offered with a soft smile. He already missed Eliott, though they were together a couple hours ago.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSounds cool. We should grab a coffee.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCoffee sounds good.\u201d Lucas said. He wished Eliott to be there with him, playing with his hair like in the morning. He just got shivers just by thinking about that moment. He never felt anything like this before, Eliott was really special.<br></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 in an hour maybe? I still gotta finish some sketches for this project, but after that I\u2019m free all day.\u201d he said with a little excitement in his voice, that warmed up Lucas\u2019 chest.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Let\u2019s meet up in front of the building, okay?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSure, see you then.\u201d he said and hung up. Lucas put away his phone and turned to his friends, being surprised that all three of them were watching him like he was some sort of rare animal. Basile kept chewing on pizza, but the others were staring at him, mouth slightly open. It was Yann who broke the awkward silence.<br></p><p>\u201cDude, I\u2019ve never seen you being so smooth before.\u201d he said impressed.\u00a0\u201cI mean with Sara and Chlo\u00e9 you were smooth, but this is way more different.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou really fucking like this guy, don\u2019t you?\u201d Arthur asked, his lips starting to form a grin. Lucas sighed and sat back down to the floor, grabbing a slice of pizza.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious, we are just\u2026 flirting with each other.\u201d he finished his sentence a bit unsure, since he couldn\u2019t really describe the thing they had between each other. It was like there were special magnets inside their bodies that only reacted to each other, pulling them closer with sheer force. When Eliott was with him, he felt safe, he felt like he was his true self and could\u00a0 tell anything to him\u00a0without being afraid.</p><p>\u201cJust <i>flirting</i>?\u201d Arthur asked mockingly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCan we drop the topic now?\u201d Lucas sighed, shoving the pizza into his face, enoying every flavor on it. It was relieving to eat something delicious after Eliott\u2019s horrible try to cook this morning.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Thursday 17:14</b></p><p>Lucas was tired, his friends were obviously nice, caring and funny, but they could be too much at once, especially when they wanted to know something. He tried to tell them what happened in the morning as short as possible, because he kinda wanted to keep things to himself, like the way Eliott looked at him, his soft touches, the almost kiss and then his forehead kiss before he left. The feelings were so overwhelming, he felt like his heart would burst out of his chest when he sees Eliott again.</p><p>He got off the bus, walking towards the building he was living in, he was listening to some music through earphones, trying to close out the world and his thoughts of Eliott. He was everywhere in his head, which wasn\u2019t too bad, but Lucas needed time to breathe, which was really hard when you keep thinking of your crush.</p><p>Eliott was sitting on a bench in front of the apartment, looking at his phone. He fought back the urge to text Lucas. It was a hard thing to do, but he was successful in the last 20 minutes since he was sitting there. He finished his job kinda quickly, so after he couldn\u2019t find himself anything to do in his home, he decided to sit in the sunshine, enjoying the warmth, while waiting for his adorable neighbor to finally come home.\u00a0</p><p>He noticed him from far away, Lucas was wearing black jeans and a navy blue jacket with a giant, grey scarf in his neck. Eliott didn\u2019t even realize that the weather was windy, he wasn\u2019t cold at all, even if he was wearing jeans, a shirt and a warm sweater, He got up, smiling brightly when he saw that Lucas noticed him, putting away the earphones while walking.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said happily when Lucas was close enough to hear.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lucas said, he smiled softly. Eliott was really attractive even in sunshine, his hair was all over the place like always, but it looked much more lighter colored in the sunlight than in the apartment.\u00a0\u201cHow are you?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, finished my project now, so everything is fantastic.\u201d Eliott said, taking a step towards Lucas.\u00a0\u201cShall we go?\u201d he asked, trying to fight back the urge to touch Lucas, failing miserably. His hands moved before he could think, slowly stroking away some stray hair from the other\u2019s eyes. It was a short moment, but both of them took a sharp breath, not moving for a half minute. Then Lucas, as the brave, chaotic gay boy he is grabbed Eliott\u2019s hand, intertwining their fingers.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go.\u2019 he said with a confident smile, as he saw how happily Eliott looked at their hands.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Thursday 18:46</b></p><p>After their\u00a0\u201cdate\u201d in the coffee shop, Lucas and Eliott went out to the park for a romantic walk. It started to get dark, but not too much. The air was much colder than it was earlier, so they were holding each others hands, while they hide their free hands in their pockets to keep them warm. Since it was the middle of the week and also kinda late, the boys were almost alone in the park.</p><p>They talked about so many things in the last few hours, Eliott told Lucas how they were together with Lucille for years, then they decided to end the relationship, because neither of them were happy, but they stayed friends, because they knew one another better than anyone.\u00a0</p><p>Lucas talked about his hard years at high school, trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with him, before accepting his sexuality. He told Eliott how hard it was for him to come out, that not everything went smooth like in the movies, but his friends were just really supportive, helping him through the tough days. It was heartwarming to remember the reaction of Basile and Arthur. Also the enthusiasm of Daphn\u00e9 and the girls. He was lucky to have such good friends around him.</p><p>They arrived home late, Eliott\u2019s nose and cheeks were red because of the cold outside, but it made him look kinda cute. Lucas took off his scarf as soon as they stepped into the building. Now they were standing on the hallway, in front of their doors, not knowing what to do. Neither of them wanted to leave, this was just too good to end.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, this is where we say Good night.\u201d Eliott said after long minutes of silence. He had to say something, he couldn\u2019t just walk inside the apartment with Lucas.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna say Good night yet.\u201d Lucas said seriously, playing with the scarf in his hands. His face felt warm because of the blush that appeared on it. He couldn\u2019t say anything else, but this was more than enough.<br></p><p>Eliott only hesitated for a few seconds before he pulled Lucas closer by his waist, pressing his lips on his gently. The kiss started off softly, Lucas wrapped his arms around Eliott\u2019s neck, standing on his tiptoes to make the position comfortable. They were playing for minutes before Eliott started to lick Lucas\u2019 lips, asking him to open it. That was more than enough, Lucas slowly opened his mouth to let Eliott\u2019s greedy and wild tongue inside.\u00a0</p><p>The kiss became much more intense and before Lucas could even realize it, Eliott pushed him to the door of his own apartment, holding his waist strongly. His fingers were wandering under the jacket, touching Lucas\u2019 skin. It was hard to focus his thoughts when such an attractive person tried to baisically fuck him with his clothes on in the middle of the hallway. Lucas played with Eliott\u2019s hair, enjoying the wild dance their tongue was doing at the moment, also enjoying the long, cold fingers touching his back and stomach.</p><p>Finally Lucas had the strength to pull his hands away from Eliott\u2019s hair, breaking their kiss with a soft smile. Eliott looked at him like a lost puppy. Their lips were red and swollen, but damn if his neighbour didn\u2019t look hot like this. Hair even more messy than usual, thanks to Lucas\u2019 wandering fingers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou wanna sleep at my place?\u201d he asked suddenly with all the bravery he had. Eliott smiled like the cute angel he was, stroking Lucas\u2019 cheek, kissing his lips again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d he said happily, planting another quick kiss on those swollen lips.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss the chance.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lucas mumbled, unable to form normal sentences when the tall boy was being so damn charming.

He had to say something, he couldn&rsquo;t just walk inside the apartment with Lucas.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna say Good night yet.&rdquo; Lucas said seriously, playing with the scarf in his hands. His face felt warm because of the blush that appeared on it. He couldn&rsquo;t say anything else, but this was more than enough.<br /></p><p>Eliott only hesitated for a few seconds before he pulled Lucas closer by his waist, pressing his lips on his gently. The kiss started off softly, Lucas wrapped his arms around Eliott&rsquo;s neck, standing on his tiptoes to make the position comfortable. They were playing for minutes before Eliott started to lick Lucas&rsquo; lips, asking him to open it. That was more than enough, Lucas slowly opened his mouth to let Eliott&rsquo;s greedy and wild tongue inside.&nbsp;</p><p>The kiss became much more intense and before Lucas could even realize it, Eliott pushed him to the door of his own apartment, holding his waist strongly. His fingers were wandering under the jacket, touching Lucas&rsquo; skin. It was hard to focus his thoughts when such an attractive person tried to baisically fuck him with his clothes on in the middle of the hallway. Lucas played with Eliott&rsquo;s hair, enjoying the wild dance their tongue was doing at the moment, also enjoying the long, cold fingers touching his back and stomach.</p><p>Finally Lucas had the strength to pull his hands away from Eliott&rsquo;s hair, breaking their kiss with a soft smile. Eliott looked at him like a lost puppy. Their lips were red and swollen, but damn if his neighbour didn&rsquo;t look hot like this. Hair even more messy than usual, thanks to Lucas&rsquo; wandering fingers.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You wanna sleep at my place?&rdquo; he asked suddenly with all the bravery he had. Eliott smiled like the cute angel he was, stroking Lucas&rsquo; cheek, kissing his lips again.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo; he said happily, planting another quick kiss on those swollen lips.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss the chance.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Lucas mumbled, unable to form normal sentences when the tall boy was being so damn charming. He managed to open the front door before they started to make out again, much more wildly now.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Their way to the bedroom was chaotic as their tried to walk, kiss and undress at the same time. Sometimes they giggled at how stupidly they must look like. When they finally made it to Lucas&rsquo; bed, they were only wearing shirts and briefs. Their hands were everywhere on each other, taking in everything, like they only have limited time to enjoy each others company, while in fact they had all the time in the world.&nbsp;</p>",
