This was inspired when I decided to go out with friends and ended up alone on more than one occasion. I am at the point where being alone doesn\u2019t stop me from having fun.</p><hr><p>It had been a few months since the last girl\u2019s night you had with your friends. After officially moving into the new place things have been hectic with work and spending more time with your boyfriend before he jets off to somewhere new.</p><p>Alexa and Dani decided on a new club, that had good reviews. You had asked your boyfriend to join you because knowing your friends each one would find a guy to dance with and would probably try to drag you into it as well. He declined but told you to have fun but not too much fun.</p><p>He was leaving to dinner just as you were about to put on your outfit. The good thing you didn\u2019t need help with the zipper.</p><p>He gave you a small kiss on the lips with a promise to call him if you needed a ride home. You agreed happily stealing one more kiss before he walked out the door. You yelled out the name of the club just in case he changed his mind. </p><p>You hoped he changed his mind.</p><p>You had decided to wear a burgundy jumpsuit\u00a0with a deep v-neck and ruffle sleeves on the shoulders. It was not too much or too little plus you could send your love a photo to tease him a little. </p><p>Just as you placed your phone in your clutch a car outside honked signaling you ride was here. You walked out making sure the door locked behind you.</p><p>\u201cI am glad you chose us over lover boy tonight,\u201d Dani said as she pulled out of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well when all you do is get drunk and find a new lay it isn\u2019t always fun.\u201d You respond with a playful pout.</p><p>Alexa chuckles, \u201cThis time it will be different.\u201d You got her a look from the backseat as she was facing you. \u201cLet\u2019s bet on it.\u201d</p><p>You sat up at her choice of words. </p><p>\u201cIf Dani and I leave you alone then we\u2019ll buy you those new boots you are too stubborn to buy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on\u201d You reply.</p><p>\u201cWe want you to pay for the next mani and pedi we go to.\u201d</p><p>You stop to really think about it for a second. You know you aren\u2019t going to lose because they like dancing but they also don\u2019t like dancing alone. \u201cAdd some donuts to my list and I will shake on this.\u201d </p><p>Alexa stuck her hand out and you shook it. Donuts, what a win. </p><!-- more --><p>**</p><p>Alexa was going to be the designated driver because you all needed a ride home. You suggested that you would do it but they shut you down just as quickly because they say you needed to let loose. </p><p>As if you don\u2019t already do that. Well, obviously not a lot but on game nights you all end up a little too drunk. Especially when your boyfriend pulls a word that shouldn\u2019t be real on scabble and makes you drink a shot every time you dictionary him. </p><p>You entered the club and already were uncomfortable with how crowded it was. Dani pulled you over to the bar and ordered you each two shots. You knew their goal was to get you drunk but you had to be sober enough to catch them with a new partner.</p><p>They didn\u2019t inform you that the club was having latin night so all you could hear was everyone singing along to Maluma\u2019s \u201cFelices Los Cuatro\u201d. You were pretty good at Spanish having learned it from an after school program you took at a young age. </p><p>This always turned on your boyfriend too bad he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>**</p><p>You and your friends have been dancing for what seemed forever when you excused yourself to the bathroom. You saw that your curled hair was starting to stick to your neck because the dance floor was getting stuffy. You pulled a black scrunchie from you clutch and pulled your hair into a messy ponytail. It surprisingly still looked nice. You walked out dreading going to look for your friends in the crowd of people.</p><p>You stepped onto the dance floor when a guy grabbed your wrist. You were quick to snatch it away not bothering to look up at the person. \u201cNot interested.\u201d You said hoping the person heard you and hurried into the crowd.</p><p>You spotted Dani\u2019s bright pink top and make your way over to her. </p><p>\u201cDani, this person-\u201c you cut yourself off when you see her making out with a tall blonde buy with tattooed arms. </p><p>She pulls away out of breath and a bit surprised to see you. She laughs because she knows that mani pedi she was dreaming of is not happening. \u201cDo you remember Kevin? I told you I met him last summer at a yoga retreat I took with my mom.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t remember a Kevin but if she does then that\u2019s okay. She can do whatever she likes but you want to keep dancing so you hope Alexa didn\u2019t find a guy.  </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool, nice meeting you Kevin.\u201d you shout over a Shakira song. \u201cWhere\u2019s Alexa, I want to keep dancing.\u201d </p><p>Dani tells you to turn around. You turn quickly to see Alexa on a stage dancing with the DJ. You don\u2019t know how she did that in the span of ten minutes. Your friends honestly do come to leave you alone. This is why for girls night you always suggest dinner and bowling.</p><p>You shake your head and laugh because you can handle dancing on your own. \u201cSuavemente\u201d comes on and you get just a little too excited. You pout because you don\u2019t have someone or dance it with. </p><p>Just as you were starting to get lost in the rhythm of the song you feel a tap on your shoulder. You turn to find a girl around your age in a striped top and black ripped jeans smiling at you and you can\u2019t help but smile back. </p><p>\u201cI lost my friend and I love this song, Will you dance with me?\u201d She said boldly.</p><p>You\u2019re a bit shocked a stranger wanted to dance with another stranger. \u201cMy name\u2019s y/n.\u201d You tell her. \u201cI only dance with people I know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Valerie, can we dance now that we know each other.\u201d </p><p>You laugh and nod your head. She grabs your hand and moves with you to the beat of the song. The lyrics are definitely sexual but you don\u2019t mind especially since you\u2019ll probably never see this girl again. Just as the song is coming to a finish she pulls you into a hug. </p><p>\u201cMy friend texted me she\u2019s at the restroom. Thanks for the dance.\u201d She says a bit loud. </p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, my friends ditched me so that was fun.\u201d You tell her with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cBefore I go there\u2019s this guy that\u2019s been watching you like a hawk by the bar. He\u2019s wearing a red velvet blazer. Looks a bit like Harry Styles if you ask me.\u201d She says eyeing him a little but not looking away from you. </p><p>\u201cOh, please. Like Harry would come to a club where he could be easily spotted.\u201d You say. </p><p>\u201cBe careful either way. It was lovely meeting you\u201d She tells you and walks away. </p><p>\u201cSexy Movimento\u201d starts playing and you know exactly how to get the guy at the bar hot and bothered. You never turn around to meet his eyes but you do angle yourself in his direction. </p><p>You start by swaying your hips left and right moving to the rhythm of the song. You turn around with your back to him and move your hands down your hips hoping it looks as sensual as it feels. </p><p>As you threw your head back a little, it hit a hard chest. A hand fell on your right hip. You saw rings adorning their fingers and got excited because they had to be the prettiest hands you have ever seen. A bit of light was reflecting off them, and you saw black nails in contrast to your french tip nails. </p><p>He now has both hands on your hips and pulls you as close as he can to you. He lowers his lips to your eye and you close your mouth to contain the sound of surprise from leaving. </p><p>He places a small kiss under your earlobe, and you lean your head to the left to give him more access. </p><p>\u201cGreedy little thing you are.\u201d He whispers.</p><p>\u201cListen, I could say the same.\u201d You respond. \u201cHave felt your eyes on me for a while.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a chuckle. \u201cAre you here alone?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with friends.\u201d You search for Dani and Alexa and find them with their gentlemen for the night.</p><p>\u201cThey must be bad friends if I saw you dancing alone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cActually, I was just dancing with one. It felt nice having her pressed close to me. Almost like this.\u201d You say with a smirk.</p><p>He tightens his grip on  your hips just a bit more. You know you\u2019ll have bruises their tomorrow. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not playing nice.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho says I had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take you right here if I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>At this comment you have to laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that easy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, this stupid outfit restricts that from happening.\u201d He growls into your ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got no access to make you a moaning mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who says I would give you permission at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh baby\u201d He leaves a kiss on your jaw. \u201cYou can\u2019t say no to me.\u201d</p><p>With that final comment, you turn around. </p><p>You stare into your boyfriend\u2019s green eyes. Harry has that signature smirk on his face, eyes full of mischief. </p><p>\u201cIs my outfit really stupid,?\u201d You pout looking down at it. \u201cI thought I looked good, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry grins. \u201cBaby, if you had been dressed in this before I left neither one of us would have made it out the door.\u201d </p><p>You grin proudly at his comment. </p><p>\u201cI am upset, we can\u2019t have a bathroom quickie\u201d You groan at his comment to hide how turned on his words make you. </p><p>You smirk up at him, and he frowns not knowing what is going on. </p><p>\u201cWell Harry, the good thing about this outfit is that when you take this off there is nothing else to undress.\u201d You laugh as his eye darkened with lust.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s gets out of here\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy so soon, I haven\u2019t danced much\u201d You sigh because you were having fun.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you danced enough. That girl you danced with\u201d He says in a threatening tone, \u201cshe was too close with hands roaming to low on what is mine.\u201d </p><p>He pulls you close so you\u2019re chest to chest. \u201cI wanted to come in and take you here in front of everyone to remind you who you belong to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad I don\u2019t like sharing\u201d </p><p>Harry smirks because he doesn\u2019t like that idea either. \u201cThat\u2019s something we can agree on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we also agree that as soon as we get home you\u2019ll have me naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh baby, you won\u2019t be wearing clothes for the rest of the night.\u201d </p><p>You lean up to leave a kiss on his neck . You can\u2019t help but suck a bit hard on his neck because you want to leave your mark on him. Before you pull away you soothe the skin with your tongue. As you pulled away, you saw Harry biting his lip to hold in a moan. </p><p>You rub your thumb gently on his cheek to get him too look at you. He slowly opens his eyes and smiles at you. It\u2019s like your the only people in the room until someone knocks into Harry from behind. You\u2019re not bothered by it. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for, love.\u201d You pull away making sure to sway your hips a bit more to rile him up. You\u2019re by the bar when you blow him a kiss and make your way outside. </p><p>Harry quickly rushes after you desperate to get to get home. As he makes his way to you already sitting in the passenger seat of his car playing with the stereo. He stops to stare. You look at him from inside and smile at him.  The look in your eyes hold nothing but love and admiration. </p><p>Harry knows Y/N will be the death of him. </p><hr><p><b>Hope you enjoyed reading this.\u00a0</b><b>Feedback is always welcomed and appreciated</b></p>",

Harry has that signature smirk on his face, eyes full of mischief. </p><p>\u201cIs my outfit really stupid,?\u201d You pout looking down at it. \u201cI thought I looked good, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry grins. \u201cBaby, if you had been dressed in this before I left neither one of us would have made it out the door.\u201d </p><p>You grin proudly at his comment. </p><p>\u201cI am upset, we can\u2019t have a bathroom quickie\u201d You groan at his comment to hide how turned on his words make you. </p><p>You smirk up at him, and he frowns not knowing what is going on. </p><p>\u201cWell Harry, the good thing about this outfit is that when you take this off there is nothing else to undress.\u201d You laugh as his eye darkened with lust.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s gets out of here\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy so soon, I haven\u2019t danced much\u201d You sigh because you were having fun.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you danced enough.

This was inspired when I decided to go out with friends and ended up alone on more than one occasion. I am at the point where being alone doesn\u2019t stop me from having fun.</p><hr><p>It had been a few months since the last girl\u2019s night you had with your friends. After officially moving into the new place things have been hectic with work and spending more time with your boyfriend before he jets off to somewhere new.</p><p>Alexa and Dani decided on a new club, that had good reviews. You had asked your boyfriend to join you because knowing your friends each one would find a guy to dance with and would probably try to drag you into it as well. He declined but told you to have fun but not too much fun.</p><p>He was leaving to dinner just as you were about to put on your outfit. The good thing you didn\u2019t need help with the zipper.</p><p>He gave you a small kiss on the lips with a promise to call him if you needed a ride home. You agreed happily stealing one more kiss before he walked out the door. You yelled out the name of the club just in case he changed his mind. </p><p>You hoped he changed his mind.</p><p>You had decided to wear a burgundy jumpsuit\u00a0with a deep v-neck and ruffle sleeves on the shoulders. It was not too much or too little plus you could send your love a photo to tease him a little. </p><p>Just as you placed your phone in your clutch a car outside honked signaling you ride was here. You walked out making sure the door locked behind you.</p><p>\u201cI am glad you chose us over lover boy tonight,\u201d Dani said as she pulled out of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well when all you do is get drunk and find a new lay it isn\u2019t always fun.\u201d You respond with a playful pout.</p><p>Alexa chuckles, \u201cThis time it will be different.\u201d You got her a look from the backseat as she was facing you. \u201cLet\u2019s bet on it.\u201d</p><p>You sat up at her choice of words. </p><p>\u201cIf Dani and I leave you alone then we\u2019ll buy you those new boots you are too stubborn to buy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on\u201d You reply.</p><p>\u201cWe want you to pay for the next mani and pedi we go to.\u201d</p><p>You stop to really think about it for a second. You know you aren\u2019t going to lose because they like dancing but they also don\u2019t like dancing alone. \u201cAdd some donuts to my list and I will shake on this.\u201d </p><p>Alexa stuck her hand out and you shook it. Donuts, what a win. </p>[[MORE]]<p>**</p><p>Alexa was going to be the designated driver because you all needed a ride home. You suggested that you would do it but they shut you down just as quickly because they say you needed to let loose. </p><p>As if you don\u2019t already do that. Well, obviously not a lot but on game nights you all end up a little too drunk. Especially when your boyfriend pulls a word that shouldn\u2019t be real on scabble and makes you drink a shot every time you dictionary him. </p><p>You entered the club and already were uncomfortable with how crowded it was. Dani pulled you over to the bar and ordered you each two shots. You knew their goal was to get you drunk but you had to be sober enough to catch them with a new partner.</p><p>They didn\u2019t inform you that the club was having latin night so all you could hear was everyone singing along to Maluma\u2019s \u201cFelices Los Cuatro\u201d. You were pretty good at Spanish having learned it from an after school program you took at a young age. </p><p>This always turned on your boyfriend too bad he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>**</p><p>You and your friends have been dancing for what seemed forever when you excused yourself to the bathroom. You saw that your curled hair was starting to stick to your neck because the dance floor was getting stuffy. You pulled a black scrunchie from you clutch and pulled your hair into a messy ponytail. It surprisingly still looked nice. You walked out dreading going to look for your friends in the crowd of people.</p><p>You stepped onto the dance floor when a guy grabbed your wrist. You were quick to snatch it away not bothering to look up at the person. \u201cNot interested.\u201d You said hoping the person heard you and hurried into the crowd.</p><p>You spotted Dani\u2019s bright pink top and make your way over to her. </p><p>\u201cDani, this person-\u201c you cut yourself off when you see her making out with a tall blonde buy with tattooed arms. </p><p>She pulls away out of breath and a bit surprised to see you. She laughs because she knows that mani pedi she was dreaming of is not happening. \u201cDo you remember Kevin? I told you I met him last summer at a yoga retreat I took with my mom.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t remember a Kevin but if she does then that\u2019s okay. She can do whatever she likes but you want to keep dancing so you hope Alexa didn\u2019t find a guy.  </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool, nice meeting you Kevin.\u201d you shout over a Shakira song. \u201cWhere\u2019s Alexa, I want to keep dancing.\u201d </p><p>Dani tells you to turn around. You turn quickly to see Alexa on a stage dancing with the DJ. You don\u2019t know how she did that in the span of ten minutes. Your friends honestly do come to leave you alone. This is why for girls night you always suggest dinner and bowling.</p><p>You shake your head and laugh because you can handle dancing on your own. \u201cSuavemente\u201d comes on and you get just a little too excited. You pout because you don\u2019t have someone or dance it with. </p><p>Just as you were starting to get lost in the rhythm of the song you feel a tap on your shoulder. You turn to find a girl around your age in a striped top and black ripped jeans smiling at you and you can\u2019t help but smile back. </p><p>\u201cI lost my friend and I love this song, Will you dance with me?\u201d She said boldly.</p><p>You\u2019re a bit shocked a stranger wanted to dance with another stranger. \u201cMy name\u2019s y/n.\u201d You tell her. \u201cI only dance with people I know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Valerie, can we dance now that we know each other.\u201d </p><p>You laugh and nod your head. She grabs your hand and moves with you to the beat of the song. The lyrics are definitely sexual but you don\u2019t mind especially since you\u2019ll probably never see this girl again. Just as the song is coming to a finish she pulls you into a hug. </p><p>\u201cMy friend texted me she\u2019s at the restroom. Thanks for the dance.\u201d She says a bit loud. </p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, my friends ditched me so that was fun.\u201d You tell her with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cBefore I go there\u2019s this guy that\u2019s been watching you like a hawk by the bar. He\u2019s wearing a red velvet blazer. Looks a bit like Harry Styles if you ask me.\u201d She says eyeing him a little but not looking away from you. </p><p>\u201cOh, please. Like Harry would come to a club where he could be easily spotted.\u201d You say. </p><p>\u201cBe careful either way. It was lovely meeting you\u201d She tells you and walks away. </p><p>\u201cSexy Movimento\u201d starts playing and you know exactly how to get the guy at the bar hot and bothered. You never turn around to meet his eyes but you do angle yourself in his direction. </p><p>You start by swaying your hips left and right moving to the rhythm of the song. You turn around with your back to him and move your hands down your hips hoping it looks as sensual as it feels. </p><p>As you threw your head back a little, it hit a hard chest. A hand fell on your right hip. You saw rings adorning their fingers and got excited because they had to be the prettiest hands you have ever seen. A bit of light was reflecting off them, and you saw black nails in contrast to your french tip nails. </p><p>He now has both hands on your hips and pulls you as close as he can to you. He lowers his lips to your eye and you close your mouth to contain the sound of surprise from leaving. </p><p>He places a small kiss under your earlobe, and you lean your head to the left to give him more access. </p><p>\u201cGreedy little thing you are.\u201d He whispers.</p><p>\u201cListen, I could say the same.\u201d You respond. \u201cHave felt your eyes on me for a while.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a chuckle. \u201cAre you here alone?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with friends.\u201d You search for Dani and Alexa and find them with their gentlemen for the night.</p><p>\u201cThey must be bad friends if I saw you dancing alone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cActually, I was just dancing with one.

This is why for girls night you always suggest dinner and bowling.</p><p>You shake your head and laugh because you can handle dancing on your own. &ldquo;Suavemente&rdquo; comes on and you get just a little too excited. You pout because you don&rsquo;t have someone or dance it with. </p><p>Just as you were starting to get lost in the rhythm of the song you feel a tap on your shoulder. You turn to find a girl around your age in a striped top and black ripped jeans smiling at you and you can&rsquo;t help but smile back. </p><p>&ldquo;I lost my friend and I love this song, Will you dance with me?&rdquo; She said boldly.</p><p>You&rsquo;re a bit shocked a stranger wanted to dance with another stranger. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s y/n.&rdquo; You tell her. &ldquo;I only dance with people I know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Valerie, can we dance now that we know each other.&rdquo; </p><p>You laugh and nod your head. She grabs your hand and moves with you to the beat of the song. The lyrics are definitely sexual but you don&rsquo;t mind especially since you&rsquo;ll probably never see this girl again. Just as the song is coming to a finish she pulls you into a hug. </p><p>&ldquo;My friend texted me she&rsquo;s at the restroom. Thanks for the dance.&rdquo; She says a bit loud. </p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you, my friends ditched me so that was fun.&rdquo; You tell her with a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Before I go there&rsquo;s this guy that&rsquo;s been watching you like a hawk by the bar. He&rsquo;s wearing a red velvet blazer. Looks a bit like Harry Styles if you ask me.&rdquo; She says eyeing him a little but not looking away from you. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, please. Like Harry would come to a club where he could be easily spotted.&rdquo; You say. </p><p>&ldquo;Be careful either way. It was lovely meeting you&rdquo; She tells you and walks away. </p><p>&ldquo;Sexy Movimento&rdquo; starts playing and you know exactly how to get the guy at the bar hot and bothered. You never turn around to meet his eyes but you do angle yourself in his direction. </p><p>You start by swaying your hips left and right moving to the rhythm of the song. You turn around with your back to him and move your hands down your hips hoping it looks as sensual as it feels. </p><p>As you threw your head back a little, it hit a hard chest. A hand fell on your right hip. You saw rings adorning their fingers and got excited because they had to be the prettiest hands you have ever seen. A bit of light was reflecting off them, and you saw black nails in contrast to your french tip nails. </p><p>He now has both hands on your hips and pulls you as close as he can to you. He lowers his lips to your eye and you close your mouth to contain the sound of surprise from leaving. </p><p>He places a small kiss under your earlobe, and you lean your head to the left to give him more access. </p><p>&ldquo;Greedy little thing you are.&rdquo; He whispers.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, I could say the same.&rdquo; You respond. &ldquo;Have felt your eyes on me for a while.&rdquo;</p><p>He lets out a chuckle. &ldquo;Are you here alone?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here with friends.&rdquo; You search for Dani and Alexa and find them with their gentlemen for the night.</p><p>&ldquo;They must be bad friends if I saw you dancing alone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I was just dancing with one. It felt nice having her pressed close to me. Almost like this.&rdquo; You say with a smirk.</p><p>He tightens his grip on  your hips just a bit more. You know you&rsquo;ll have bruises their tomorrow. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not playing nice.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who says I had to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take you right here if I wanted to.&rdquo;</p><p>At this comment you have to laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that easy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, this stupid outfit restricts that from happening.&rdquo; He growls into your ear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no access to make you a moaning mess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, who says I would give you permission at all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh baby&rdquo; He leaves a kiss on your jaw. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say no to me.&rdquo;</p><p>With that final comment, you turn around. </p><p>You stare into your boyfriend&rsquo;s green eyes. Harry has that signature smirk on his face, eyes full of mischief. </p><p>&ldquo;Is my outfit really stupid,?&rdquo; You pout looking down at it. &ldquo;I thought I looked good, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry grins. &ldquo;Baby, if you had been dressed in this before I left neither one of us would have made it out the door.&rdquo; </p><p>You grin proudly at his comment. </p><p>&ldquo;I am upset, we can&rsquo;t have a bathroom quickie&rdquo; You groan at his comment to hide how turned on his words make you. </p><p>You smirk up at him, and he frowns not knowing what is going on. </p><p>&ldquo;Well Harry, the good thing about this outfit is that when you take this off there is nothing else to undress.&rdquo; You laugh as his eye darkened with lust.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s gets out of here&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why so soon, I haven&rsquo;t danced much&rdquo; You sigh because you were having fun.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, you danced enough. That girl you danced with&rdquo; He says in a threatening tone, &ldquo;she was too close with hands roaming to low on what is mine.&rdquo; </p><p>He pulls you close so you&rsquo;re chest to chest. &ldquo;I wanted to come in and take you here in front of everyone to remind you who you belong to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too bad I don&rsquo;t like sharing&rdquo; </p><p>Harry smirks because he doesn&rsquo;t like that idea either. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something we can agree on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can we also agree that as soon as we get home you&rsquo;ll have me naked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh baby, you won&rsquo;t be wearing clothes for the rest of the night.&rdquo; </p><p>You lean up to leave a kiss on his neck . You can&rsquo;t help but suck a bit hard on his neck because you want to leave your mark on him. Before you pull away you soothe the skin with your tongue. As you pulled away, you saw Harry biting his lip to hold in a moan. </p><p>You rub your thumb gently on his cheek to get him too look at you. He slowly opens his eyes and smiles at you. It&rsquo;s like your the only people in the room until someone knocks into Harry from behind. You&rsquo;re not bothered by it. </p><p>&ldquo;What are we waiting for, love.&rdquo; You pull away making sure to sway your hips a bit more to rile him up. You&rsquo;re by the bar when you blow him a kiss and make your way outside. </p><p>Harry quickly rushes after you desperate to get to get home. As he makes his way to you already sitting in the passenger seat of his car playing with the stereo. He stops to stare. You look at him from inside and smile at him.  The look in your eyes hold nothing but love and admiration. </p><p>Harry knows Y/N will be the death of him. </p><hr /><p><b>Hope you enjoyed reading this.&nbsp;</b><b>Feedback is always welcomed and appreciated</b></p>",

This was inspired when I decided to go out with friends and ended up alone on more than one occasion. I am at the point where being alone doesn&rsquo;t stop me from having fun.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It had been a few months since the last girl&rsquo;s night you had with your friends. After officially moving into the new place things have been hectic with work and spending more time with your boyfriend before he jets off to somewhere new.</p>\n<p>Alexa and Dani decided on a new club, that had good reviews. You had asked your boyfriend to join you because knowing your friends each one would find a guy to dance with and would probably try to drag you into it as well. He declined but told you to have fun but not too much fun.</p>\n<p>He was leaving to dinner just as you were about to put on your outfit. The good thing you didn&rsquo;t need help with the zipper.</p>\n<p>He gave you a small kiss on the lips with a promise to call him if you needed a ride home. You agreed happily stealing one more kiss before he walked out the door. You yelled out the name of the club just in case he changed his mind. </p>\n<p>You hoped he changed his mind.</p>\n<p>You had decided to wear a burgundy jumpsuit&nbsp;with a deep v-neck and ruffle sleeves on the shoulders. It was not too much or too little plus you could send your love a photo to tease him a little. </p>\n<p>Just as you placed your phone in your clutch a car outside honked signaling you ride was here. You walked out making sure the door locked behind you.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am glad you chose us over lover boy tonight,&rdquo; Dani said as she pulled out of the driveway.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, well when all you do is get drunk and find a new lay it isn&rsquo;t always fun.&rdquo; You respond with a playful pout.</p>\n<p>Alexa chuckles, &ldquo;This time it will be different.&rdquo; You got her a look from the backseat as she was facing you. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bet on it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You sat up at her choice of words. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;If Dani and I leave you alone then we&rsquo;ll buy you those new boots you are too stubborn to buy yourself.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Go on&rdquo; You reply.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We want you to pay for the next mani and pedi we go to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You stop to really think about it for a second. You know you aren&rsquo;t going to lose because they like dancing but they also don&rsquo;t like dancing alone. &ldquo;Add some donuts to my list and I will shake on this.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Alexa stuck her hand out and you shook it. Donuts, what a win. </p>\n</p>",

Thank you so much for being here tonight. I know a lot of you have flown a long way. I really appreciate you being here. When I booked this show, I wanted to celebrate with you guys. I\u2019ve played some of my favourite shows in Mexico, and it felt right to come and celebrate with you, but tonight doesn\u2019t feel like a night to celebrate. Last night, there was a tragedy in my hometown of Manchester, and I have been left with a hole in my heart.   I went to my first show in the arena, and I\u2019ve had some of the best experiences of my life playing in Manchester. We have a choice, every single day that we wake up, of what we can put into the world, and I ask you to please choose love every single day.

        "body": "<p>This clearly ran away with me! I imagine this is right before a theoretical second tour and about a year after Hada kissed for the first time. A couple years after the event of Tryst!</p><p>&ldquo;How long were you with her?&rdquo; Ada was seething. She was sure that if Harry wasn&rsquo;t floating on how excited he was about his tour and how it was coming together he would have noticed she was boiling. But he&rsquo;d been boyishly excited. She almost felt guilty to ruin his mood. Almost.</p><!-- more --><p>He should have told her. It wasn&rsquo;t a lie, just an omission. It was impossible to ride his high with him after she realized.</p><p>Ada had been captivated too, when he&rsquo;d told her his ideas for the staging. Still stripped back and musically focused, but with sentimental nuggets and images, she&rsquo;d whole heartedly loved the idea. When the images started arriving, they&rsquo;d spent hours pouring over them. The new album was less melancholic, he was happier. She&rsquo;d felt a bit responsible for that. Felt warm all over about it; she could take some credit. They&rsquo;d had a whirlwind year after the movie came out. They weren&rsquo;t living together, but they might as well have been. Things were good, she believed that.</p><p>She had nothing to worry about, right? So why didn&rsquo;t he tell her? Anytime between his request and now.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, we have a stage rehearsal, tomorrow, and I think my, like, tour family, will all be there,&rdquo; He&rsquo;d pinked up in the way she loved he still did. Like she didn&rsquo;t know he was soft and lovely most places, but not in the dark. &ldquo;Would you come with me, meet everybody? See the ideas realized. Tell me what you think, honestly?&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;d been afterglowing on their morning lie in, in a silly mood. &ldquo;Oh, am I known for sparing your feelings, Styles?&rdquo;</p><p>He burst a laugh, &ldquo;no, I suppose not.&rdquo; He took her hand. &ldquo;But I value your opinion. And I want it to be great. And you have an eye and experience.&rdquo; She nodded, kissed his earnest nose, where it curved down when he talked. She loved that little nuance of him. She kinda wanted to punch him in his wiggly nose right now, hours later. She felt like there were a few other details he should have given her before they&rsquo;d arrived.</p><p>That somebody else she&rsquo;d have to meet, that he&rsquo;d be around everyday, knew what he looked like across a pillow.</p><p>Ada would not have gone then though, maybe he knew that. She might have missed it. It had all been gorgeous and everybody lovely.</p><p>Speaking of lovely, the spritely little photographer hadn&rsquo;t registered immediately on Ada&rsquo;s relationship radar. They&rsquo;d shaken hands, kissed cheeks, while Harry was engaged, no red flag widening of eyes on, what was her name, when they&rsquo;d been introduced. She cast her mind back to and hour ago. Until Harry was oh so helpful.</p><p>&ldquo;Helene?&rdquo; Harry responded and that was what had peaked her interest. She wasn&rsquo;t the only small blonde. They were in LA after all.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t just the way Helene went from tiny and adorable to suddenly sexy when Harry was nearby. She hadn&rsquo;t done anything. Nothing discernible, really, but Ada read people, something about being the only black girl in most rooms, you learned who to talk to, avoid. \u00a0Helene, as Harry had helpfully supplied, had pouted her lips, jutted a hip, minutely.</p><p>And Harry. He&rsquo;d been Harry, warm and lovely and affectionate. The touch, though, had been familiar. Lingered one second to long.</p><p>And his eyes had closed when they hugged.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when Ada had known.</p><p>He closed his eyes. The way she caught him doing in the mirror when they hugged, Ada and Harry. What did that mean? What were their feelings? Repressed? Explored? Rejected? All the things she didn&rsquo;t know were what made her madder and madder, more alarmingly insecure on the way home.</p><p>Could two women be more different?</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Helene!&rdquo; She huffed and threw her jacket and the Gucci purse he&rsquo;d given her, that she sorta liked, on the floor. &ldquo;But thanks for confirming!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you upset?&rdquo; She whirled on him and he looked sincerely confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve fucked her!&rdquo; Her hands flashed up to her chin level where her shoulders were. His reaction would confirm or deny.</p><p>&ldquo;Ada,&rdquo; he hesitated. Bingo! Her anger could be hot, it would flare then disappear, unless it was fanned. He was tiptoeing, it pissed her off. &ldquo;Smokes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She warned.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I wasn&rsquo;t a virgin when we got together babe, you know where I&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;</p><p>She figured he meant his fluidity, but in this case, specificity was the problem. &ldquo;No, I actually don&rsquo;t! Which is the fucking problem! I know you fucked any willing tall, blonde groupie that one year, and a couple boys for your trouble. And your exes, Camille.&rdquo; Harry winced. She knew he could have loved that one. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you with her on tour? I didn&rsquo;t think you were a cheater.&rdquo;</p><p>He caught her hands, came close. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t cheat, she wanted it open. That&rsquo;s not fair, Ada, what are you really mad about here? I&rsquo;m lost. That I&rsquo;ve had sex before? That I slept with two women concurrently, with their knowledge? That you had to meet a person from my past? You know Kendall already.&rdquo;</p><p>Fucking Kendall, Ada didn&rsquo;t love that they were around each other so much. Fuck, she didn&rsquo;t know she was such a jealous person, maybe she usually didn&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m livid that you didn&rsquo;t respect me enough to give me a heads up that you were fucking your photographer before I had to meet her!&rdquo; She pushed his hand away and he went to re-establish the connection but she balled her fist.</p><p>&ldquo;Ada! I don&rsquo;t, it wasn&rsquo;t a relationship, I didn&hellip;.how&rsquo;d you even know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck you Styles! You meant to hide it?&rdquo; She went to push him and grabbed his shirt instead.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no!&rdquo; He repeated over and over. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I just didn&rsquo;t think about it! I&rsquo;ve told you about my relationships, all of them.&rdquo; He looked scared and she softened just a touch. &ldquo;I guess, because it was just a few times&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, she may not have been a girlfriend, but you&rsquo;ll be with her all the time, on tour, and you fell into something before, and I feel&hellip;.&rdquo; she searched for the word. Scared. &ldquo;Disrespected.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; he reached for her, lost like her, needing connection, \u00a0and she went to him this time. Anger still simmering. &ldquo;I can see that, and I&rsquo;m sorry. I just&hellip;you&rsquo;ve nothing to worry about, Smokes, I love you. I love you so.&rdquo; He said it against her mouth, and she went banked, coals in a grate, the heat into his mouth, her breath still huffed. Even the kiss he graced her with wasn&rsquo;t enough to extinguish her fire. Her worry.</p><p>The kiss was soft, a press of his gorgeous omitting mouth to hers. All full lipped and minted breath. Tentative, he kissed, provided the gentle suction she loved on her top lip, bottom lip, then top again before his tongue slide against her own to tangle and distract.</p><p>He gave her a cursory gentle nip, on the third retreat and parry and that was it. She bit him back and grabbed his hair, missing the slightly longer locks he had just sheared. They would be good to pull. She yanked his neck back, and he rolled his eyes down to her, gentled his neck. Ada guided him down, not so gentle pressure on his neck. Harry went easy to his knees, kissed hers, then her thighs, between, as penance. Asked forgiveness with his eyes and gentle neck, obedience. &ldquo;Lick me!&rdquo; And he&rsquo;d done until she said &ldquo;stop!&rdquo;</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t enough. Even when he let her tie him down, showed his belly and his ass in contrition. The marks on his ass felt right, he pinked up in a way she didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>It was an occasional reversal they played in. But it was more common after Ada met Helene, because she couldn&rsquo;t stop asking herself whether the photographer wasn&rsquo;t mentioned because she was didn&rsquo;t matter, or because she did.</p>",

She was sure that if Harry wasn\u2019t floating on how excited he was about his tour and how it was coming together he would have noticed she was boiling. But he\u2019d been boyishly excited. She almost felt guilty to ruin his mood. Almost.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He should have told her. It wasn\u2019t a lie, just an omission. It was impossible to ride his high with him after she realized.</p><p>Ada had been captivated too, when he\u2019d told her his ideas for the staging. Still stripped back and musically focused, but with sentimental nuggets and images, she\u2019d whole heartedly loved the idea. When the images started arriving, they\u2019d spent hours pouring over them. The new album was less melancholic, he was happier. She\u2019d felt a bit responsible for that. Felt warm all over about it; she could take some credit. They\u2019d had a whirlwind year after the movie came out. They weren\u2019t living together, but they might as well have been. Things were good, she believed that.</p><p>She had nothing to worry about, right? So why didn\u2019t he tell her? Anytime between his request and now.</p><p>\u201cHey, we have a stage rehearsal, tomorrow, and I think my, like, tour family, will all be there,\u201d He\u2019d pinked up in the way she loved he still did. Like she didn\u2019t know he was soft and lovely most places, but not in the dark. \u201cWould you come with me, meet everybody? See the ideas realized. Tell me what you think, honestly?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been afterglowing on their morning lie in, in a silly mood. \u201cOh, am I known for sparing your feelings, Styles?\u201d</p><p>He burst a laugh, \u201cno, I suppose not.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cBut I value your opinion. And I want it to be great. And you have an eye and experience.\u201d She nodded, kissed his earnest nose, where it curved down when he talked. She loved that little nuance of him. She kinda wanted to punch him in his wiggly nose right now, hours later. She felt like there were a few other details he should have given her before they\u2019d arrived.</p><p>That somebody else she\u2019d have to meet, that he\u2019d be around everyday, knew what he looked like across a pillow.</p><p>Ada would not have gone then though, maybe he knew that. She might have missed it. It had all been gorgeous and everybody lovely.</p><p>Speaking of lovely, the spritely little photographer hadn\u2019t registered immediately on Ada\u2019s relationship radar. They\u2019d shaken hands, kissed cheeks, while Harry was engaged, no red flag widening of eyes on, what was her name, when they\u2019d been introduced. She cast her mind back to and hour ago. Until Harry was oh so helpful.</p><p>\u201cHelene?\u201d Harry responded and that was what had peaked her interest. She wasn\u2019t the only small blonde. They were in LA after all.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the way Helene went from tiny and adorable to suddenly sexy when Harry was nearby. She hadn\u2019t done anything. Nothing discernible, really, but Ada read people, something about being the only black girl in most rooms, you learned who to talk to, avoid. \u00a0Helene, as Harry had helpfully supplied, had pouted her lips, jutted a hip, minutely.</p><p>And Harry. He\u2019d been Harry, warm and lovely and affectionate. The touch, though, had been familiar. Lingered one second to long.</p><p>And his eyes had closed when they hugged.</p><p>That\u2019s when Ada had known.</p><p>He closed his eyes. The way she caught him doing in the mirror when they hugged, Ada and Harry. What did that mean? What were their feelings? Repressed? Explored? Rejected? All the things she didn\u2019t know were what made her madder and madder, more alarmingly insecure on the way home.</p><p>Could two women be more different?</p><p>\u201cYes Helene!\u201d She huffed and threw her jacket and the Gucci purse he\u2019d given her, that she sorta liked, on the floor. \u201cBut thanks for confirming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you upset?\u201d She whirled on him and he looked sincerely confused.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve fucked her!\u201d Her hands flashed up to her chin level where her shoulders were. His reaction would confirm or deny.</p><p>\u201cAda,\u201d he hesitated. Bingo! Her anger could be hot, it would flare then disappear, unless it was fanned. He was tiptoeing, it pissed her off. \u201cSmokes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d She warned.</p><p>\u201cYou know I wasn\u2019t a virgin when we got together babe, you know where I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>She figured he meant his fluidity, but in this case, specificity was the problem. \u201cNo, I actually don\u2019t! Which is the fucking problem! I know you fucked any willing tall, blonde groupie that one year, and a couple boys for your trouble. And your exes, Camille.\u201d Harry winced. She knew he could have loved that one. \u201cWeren\u2019t you with her on tour? I didn\u2019t think you were a cheater.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hands, came close. \u201cI didn\u2019t cheat, she wanted it open. That\u2019s not fair, Ada, what are you really mad about here? I\u2019m lost. That I\u2019ve had sex before? That I slept with two women concurrently, with their knowledge? That you had to meet a person from my past? You know Kendall already.\u201d</p><p>Fucking Kendall, Ada didn\u2019t love that they were around each other so much. Fuck, she didn\u2019t know she was such a jealous person, maybe she usually didn\u2019t give a fuck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m livid that you didn\u2019t respect me enough to give me a heads up that you were fucking your photographer before I had to meet her!\u201d She pushed his hand away and he went to re-establish the connection but she balled her fist.</p><p>\u201cAda! I don\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t a relationship, I didn\u2026.how\u2019d you even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck you Styles! You meant to hide it?\u201d She went to push him and grabbed his shirt instead.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d He repeated over and over. \u201cI didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t, I just didn\u2019t think about it! I\u2019ve told you about my relationships, all of them.\u201d He looked scared and she softened just a touch. \u201cI guess, because it was just a few times\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, she may not have been a girlfriend, but you\u2019ll be with her all the time, on tour, and you fell into something before, and I feel\u2026.\u201d she searched for the word. Scared. \u201cDisrespected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d he reached for her, lost like her, needing connection, \u00a0and she went to him this time. Anger still simmering. \u201cI can see that, and I\u2019m sorry. I just\u2026you\u2019ve nothing to worry about, Smokes, I love you. I love you so.\u201d He said it against her mouth, and she went banked, coals in a grate, the heat into his mouth, her breath still huffed. Even the kiss he graced her with wasn\u2019t enough to extinguish her fire. Her worry.</p><p>The kiss was soft, a press of his gorgeous omitting mouth to hers. All full lipped and minted breath. Tentative, he kissed, provided the gentle suction she loved on her top lip, bottom lip, then top again before his tongue slide against her own to tangle and distract.</p><p>He gave her a cursory gentle nip, on the third retreat and parry and that was it. She bit him back and grabbed his hair, missing the slightly longer locks he had just sheared. They would be good to pull. She yanked his neck back, and he rolled his eyes down to her, gentled his neck. Ada guided him down, not so gentle pressure on his neck. Harry went easy to his knees, kissed hers, then her thighs, between, as penance. Asked forgiveness with his eyes and gentle neck, obedience. \u201cLick me!\u201d And he\u2019d done until she said \u201cstop!\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough. Even when he let her tie him down, showed his belly and his ass in contrition. The marks on his ass felt right, he pinked up in a way she didn\u2019t.</p><p>It was an occasional reversal they played in. But it was more common after Ada met Helene, because she couldn\u2019t stop asking herself whether the photographer wasn\u2019t mentioned because she was didn\u2019t matter, or because she did.</p>",

I&rsquo;m lost. That I&rsquo;ve had sex before? That I slept with two women concurrently, with their knowledge? That you had to meet a person from my past? You know Kendall already.&rdquo;</p><p>Fucking Kendall, Ada didn&rsquo;t love that they were around each other so much. Fuck, she didn&rsquo;t know she was such a jealous person, maybe she usually didn&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m livid that you didn&rsquo;t respect me enough to give me a heads up that you were fucking your photographer before I had to meet her!&rdquo; She pushed his hand away and he went to re-establish the connection but she balled her fist.</p><p>&ldquo;Ada! I don&rsquo;t, it wasn&rsquo;t a relationship, I didn&hellip;.how&rsquo;d you even know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck you Styles! You meant to hide it?&rdquo; She went to push him and grabbed his shirt instead.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no!&rdquo; He repeated over and over. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I just didn&rsquo;t think about it! I&rsquo;ve told you about my relationships, all of them.&rdquo; He looked scared and she softened just a touch. &ldquo;I guess, because it was just a few times&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, she may not have been a girlfriend, but you&rsquo;ll be with her all the time, on tour, and you fell into something before, and I feel&hellip;.&rdquo; she searched for the word. Scared. &ldquo;Disrespected.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; he reached for her, lost like her, needing connection, &nbsp;and she went to him this time. Anger still simmering. &ldquo;I can see that, and I&rsquo;m sorry. I just&hellip;you&rsquo;ve nothing to worry about, Smokes, I love you. I love you so.&rdquo; He said it against her mouth, and she went banked, coals in a grate, the heat into his mouth, her breath still huffed. Even the kiss he graced her with wasn&rsquo;t enough to extinguish her fire. Her worry.</p><p>The kiss was soft, a press of his gorgeous omitting mouth to hers. All full lipped and minted breath. Tentative, he kissed, provided the gentle suction she loved on her top lip, bottom lip, then top again before his tongue slide against her own to tangle and distract.</p><p>He gave her a cursory gentle nip, on the third retreat and parry and that was it. She bit him back and grabbed his hair, missing the slightly longer locks he had just sheared. They would be good to pull. She yanked his neck back, and he rolled his eyes down to her, gentled his neck. Ada guided him down, not so gentle pressure on his neck. Harry went easy to his knees, kissed hers, then her thighs, between, as penance. Asked forgiveness with his eyes and gentle neck, obedience. &ldquo;Lick me!&rdquo; And he&rsquo;d done until she said &ldquo;stop!&rdquo;</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t enough. Even when he let her tie him down, showed his belly and his ass in contrition. The marks on his ass felt right, he pinked up in a way she didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>It was an occasional reversal they played in. But it was more common after Ada met Helene, because she couldn&rsquo;t stop asking herself whether the photographer wasn&rsquo;t mentioned because she was didn&rsquo;t matter, or because she did.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>This clearly ran away with me! I imagine this is right before a theoretical second tour and about a year after Hada kissed for the first time. A couple years after the event of Tryst!</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How long were you with her?&rdquo; Ada was seething. She was sure that if Harry wasn&rsquo;t floating on how excited he was about his tour and how it was coming together he would have noticed she was boiling. But he&rsquo;d been boyishly excited. She almost felt guilty to ruin his mood. Almost.</p>\n</p>",

        "body": "<h2>(from the <i><b>Flatmate Trilogy</b>: <a href=\"https://heyyyharry.tumblr.com/post/184688087920/two-hearts-one-home\" target=\"_blank\">Two Hearts, One Home</a></i>)</h2><p><b>&hellip;in which Y/N deals with more problems at work, and Harry makes a life changing decision.</b></p><ul><li><b>Word count: </b><i>4.1k</i></li><li><b>Chapter 1: <a href=\"https://heyyyharry.tumblr.com/post/184893258044/honeymoon\" target=\"_blank\">Honeymoon</a> </b>- Y/N and Harry go to Greece for their honeymoon and run into a couple they hate.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/733251218-two-hearts-one-home-harry-styles-boss\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wattpad link</b></a></li></ul><p>.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N wasn&rsquo;t a workaholic, she kept telling herself that, but it did feel good to finally get back to work after her honeymoon. The trip was doubtlessly wonderful, and she&rsquo;d never felt more loved in her entire life. If she&rsquo;d had a choice, she probably would&rsquo;ve picked to stay on the island with Harry. But let&rsquo;s be realistic, how could they afford another expensive holiday if they neglected their jobs? Now it was time to focus on what really mattered for their future together. <i>Money.</i></p><p>Besides, Y/N did miss her desk at the office, and even though her co-workers weren&rsquo;t all angels. She was sure some of them missed her, if not all. When she came back, they would rush to her with open arms and said\u2014</p><p>&ldquo;The proposal you sent me was crap.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>All eyes in the room shifted to Y/N, who was still trying to figure out what was happening. She&rsquo;d heard that everyone who had worked with <i>Catherine Daniels</i> had all the worst things to say about this woman. They said that she was terrible to people, that she was afraid of no one and wouldn&rsquo;t take criticism from anyone in this firm, that the only reason she was head of Media Relations was because she&rsquo;d been here the longest. This was actually the first time Y/N had spoken face to face with Catherine, and she kind of understood why the nickname <i>Catherine &lsquo;Dictator&rsquo; </i>existed.</p><p>&ldquo;But that was what the client\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enough with the same excuses.&rdquo; Catherine scoffed. &ldquo;You people in Client Service has <i>one</i> simple job, to negotiate with the clients so it&rsquo;s easier for <i>us</i>, the ones who actually have to do the hard work and handle the journalists.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N almost said sorry for something that wasn&rsquo;t entirely her fault, in hope that it might put an end to the tension between them. Thankfully, Kate showed up just in time to back her up. She gave Catherine a dirty look, pulling Y/N to her side.</p><p>&ldquo;Go terrorize the people on your team, Catherine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Elizabeth is on maternity leave.&rdquo; Catherine responded with a sarcastic chuckle. &ldquo;Who else would I blame this for? You?&rdquo;</p><p>Elizabeth was the head of Client Service, Y/N&rsquo;s department. Unlike Catherine, that woman was the sweetest and she would never talk down to any of her team members. While watching Kate and Catherine arguing, Y/N really wished Elizabeth would magically appear and make everything better again.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Coleman will take over Liz&rsquo;s responsibilities until she gets back,&rdquo; Kate chided as she put both hands on her hips. &ldquo;So maybe you should go tell him how <i>crappy</i> you think the proposal is? He&rsquo;ll be in his office tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N almost forgot. There was <i>someone</i> in this company that Catherine was afraid of after all.</p><p>&ldquo;Feels good to be teacher&rsquo;s pet, huh?&rdquo; The hateful woman whispered to Y/N before turning back to Kate and said through gritted teeth, &ldquo;if she doesn&rsquo;t send me a better proposal by tomorrow, set me an appointment with Coleman. He needs to know when to fire his <i>favorite</i> employee.&rdquo;</p><p>As Catherine stormed away, Kate turned to her wide-eyed friend, looking extremely pissed off. It couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious that she loathed that woman as much as anyone here; however, Y/N&rsquo;s tolerance of such rude behaviors was the main reason she was fuming with rage.</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have let her talk to you like that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was just&hellip;trying to do her job,&rdquo; Y/N mumbled, giving Kate a shrug. &ldquo;I mean&hellip;it&rsquo;s probably difficult to deal with the media.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sis, it&rsquo;s the <i>client</i> who pays you money to deal with the media, so believe me, if the client wants the moon, you give them the moon! No question asked!&rdquo; Kate slammed both hands onto the table, nearly causing Y/N&rsquo;s coffee cup to fall over. &ldquo;Catherine always puts herself first and shits on all the others anyway. But don&rsquo;t worry, Jack will <i>definitely</i> defend you.&rdquo;</p><p>That was exactly what made Y/N worry. Jack would defend her, or at least try to fix her mistakes. After all she wasn&rsquo;t only his employee, but also his friend and might&rsquo;ve been something more in the past. Even though she knew he would always be fair, these people in the office did not, and they might just assume she was getting special treatments simply because she was his <i>favorite</i>. The smartest solution here was to give Catherine what she wanted. <i>Not</i> because she was afraid of Catherine (maybe a bit), but because she didn&rsquo;t want Jack&rsquo;s reputation ruined for helping her, <i>again</i>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Screw. Me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Later, I&rsquo;m washing dishes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haha, funny.&rdquo; Y/N shot her husband a glare as he turned to check her reaction. He expected her to laugh along. She always would no matter how lame his jokes were. But this time all she did was breathe out and carry on with whatever she was doing on her laptop. She&rsquo;d been working ever since she got home, and only stopped to eat dinner before getting back to work again. Harry was surely worried. The last time his wife worked this hard, she ended up passing out on her desk after consuming too much coffee, he nearly had a heart attack that day.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe&hellip;&rdquo; He dried his hands and headed towards where she sat at the table. &ldquo;Maybe you and I can Netflix and chill tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N giggled when his breath tickled her neck and he laid a soft kiss on her shoulder blade, throwing in a sweet <i>&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;</i> as if she didn&rsquo;t already know. Her husband was just trying to distract her from work, and even so, she let him. She should be distracted for a little while for her brain to function again, and he seemed to be in need of a little affection. When she turned to him, their lips met for an urgent wet kiss which sent him down on his knees by her side.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he muttered, all out of breath as his lips curved into a slop-sided grin. One of his hands were resting on her hip, the other on the backrest of the chair. &ldquo;Play with me and I&rsquo;ll let you go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Play with you?&rdquo; Y/N chuckled as she cupped his face. &ldquo;Is this why you let Layla and Niall watch Treasure tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of parent you think I am?&rdquo; The man faked a faint gasp that made his wife giggle. &ldquo;Actually, Layla&rsquo;s having dinner with her dad&rsquo;s family, and her stepmother is allergic to cats so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you let her use our daughter as a revenge tool.&rdquo; She jokingly lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you calling me a bad parent then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! No!&rdquo; Y/N burst out laughing when her husband took both of her wrists with one hand and started ticking her with the other. She fought to get away, accidentally slipping right off her chair and collapsing right on top of him. Now the table had turned, she blocked his arms and executed the tickle torture until he laughed so hard he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;I surrender! Surrender!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You cannot surrender after what you did to me, baby. That&rsquo;s not the rule.&rdquo; Y/N knew he could&rsquo;ve stopped her easily, yet he still let her win. So she showed some mercy by letting him suffer for a little more before raising her hands to call a truce. Harry combed his fingers through his messy locks, breathing heavily and flashing her a lazy smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done playing with you. Can I please go now?&rdquo;</p><p>When she patted his chest and attempted to move, Harry quickly sat up, fingers clutching her thighs to keep her still. He knew she could just brush off his hands and get back to work, but it was her choice to stay in his lap. So he flashed her a cheeky grin. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not done playing with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;m serious.&rdquo; She sighed, gently stroking his hair. He was like a baby now, pouting and nuzzling her neck, pleading for attention, which she would gladly give him if Jack&rsquo;s reputation and her own weren&rsquo;t hanging by a thread. &ldquo;I need to get this proposal done by morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always working overtime and now you&rsquo;re working at home too,&rdquo; he said with a big frown. &ldquo;I feel like no one beside Jack acknowledges your effort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly! Thank you! I mean, I love my job but I gotta admit most people in PR are assholes.&rdquo; Harry couldn&rsquo;t hold back another smile when she turned serious and started counting on her ten fingers to illustrate her point to him. &ldquo;So take ten people at my office, four of them will hate me, the next four don&rsquo;t give a damn about me but they love the drama and believe dumb rumors anyway, the two people left are Jack and Kate.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry pressed a kiss to his wife&rsquo;s cheek, laughing as he tried to cheer her up, &ldquo;positively speaking, your two supporters are your boss and your boss&rsquo; assistant. You still win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you put it that way,&rdquo; she said, beaming at him. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m only working this hard because we need money for our future family. So when we <i>finally</i> get super rich, it&rsquo;s <i>over</i> for them. I might even quit the job and we can go on honeymoon every weekend. Sounds great, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stayed on the floor after his wife had kissed him and returned to her laptop. &ldquo;Feels good to just imagine,&rdquo; she said in a sing-song voice. However, he knew there was also truth behind that joke, that everything could be much better if they were wealthy people, that she could have the life he&rsquo;d promised them both, no more extra hours at the office just to impress people who weren&rsquo;t so nice to her.</p><p>The opportunity was right on the table, all he needed was to swallow his pride and seize it. And because of her, he might actually consider working things out with his dad.</p><p>The next morning, Harry could barely pay attention to anything else. He sat in his office, staring at a half-finished email to his dad&rsquo;s assistant which he&rsquo;d written last night, trying to decide if he should send it. He just wanted an appointment with Devlin, but then what? What was he gonna say? He didn&rsquo;t want to just apologize for doing nothing wrong only to get this over with. And would Devlin trust him enough to hand him the CEO chair after everything? Maybe he should phone Y/N and ask for her opinion. Even though she&rsquo;d been on board with this idea since the beginning, and even trying to convince him to go for it, he didn&rsquo;t think he should make this decision on his own. But on second thought, he should wait until he saw her at home, because something like this shouldn&rsquo;t be discussed over a phone call.</p><p>There was a knock on the door when Harry was having a debate with himself. He shut the laptop and told the person to come in, Olivia then entered, wearing a massive grin on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Got you coffee!&rdquo; She exclaimed happily and placed the cup down on his desk. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks.&rdquo; He raised an eyebrow as she sat down in front of him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the occasion?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yesterday was my birthday so today I bought coffee for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as she said it, Harry&rsquo;s face scrunched up in guilt. He pinched the bride of his nose and muttered under his breath, &ldquo;shit. I&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry, Ollie&hellip;I forgot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; The blonde giggled as she shook her head. It didn&rsquo;t take an expert to see that she was in a <i>much</i> better mood than usual. And Harry was already suspecting a reason behind her strange attitude. &ldquo;I had the best birthday though,&rdquo; she confessed, the grin on her face grew twice bigger.</p><p>Harry recognized that grin. He&rsquo;d been in a relationship for five years, how could he not? It was as clear as daylight! &ldquo;Okay, who is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo; Olivia arched an eyebrow. Harry knew her better than most people, and <i>that</i> right there was her iconic <i>'I-know-what-you&rsquo;re-talking-about-but-I&rsquo;m-just-pretending&rsquo;</i> face.</p><p>&ldquo;The guy who made this birthday so<i> 'special&rsquo;</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why is the word special in air-quotes?&rdquo; Olivia giggled. Then it only took a couple seconds for reluctance to wash off the happiness on her face. He was second guessing if it was something he&rsquo;d said that unintentionally upset her, but he didn&rsquo;t really need to ask as she was gonna tell him anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I want you to know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He nodded, eyebrows furrowed as he leaned forward, getting a bit impatient. &ldquo;Is the guy a drug dealer or&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! Jesus no!&rdquo; Another soft giggle escaped her red lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jack, but\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; Harry shouted and slammed his fist onto the desk, almost giving the girl a heart attack. Then he started laughing as her cheeks turned pink. &ldquo;I saw you two dancing at my wedding and I knew it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, calm down,&rdquo; she told him, rolling her eyes even though his reaction was undeniably adorable. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about Jack. Well, it is kind of related to him, but mostly you and&hellip;<i>your dad</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dad? Are they doing business together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kind of&hellip;&rdquo; Olivia pursed her lips while fidgeting with the pencils right in front of her. It seemed like she was struggling to find the right way to break this news. &ldquo;More like&hellip;Devlin&rsquo;s selling Styles Corporation to the Colemans.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes went wide as his mouth hung opened. He was hoping Olivia would crack up and tell him he&rsquo;d been fooled, but she seemed too serious for him to believe this was just a lousy prank.</p><p>&ldquo;Jack told me last night. I just assumed after&hellip;what happened, Devlin wouldn&rsquo;t discuss this with you in advance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even talk.&rdquo; Harry blew up his cheeks, tapping his fingers on the desk impatiently. Now their conversation had sunk back to silence. While Olivia was trying to come up with something to say, Harry kept on staring at the email he&rsquo;d been hesitating to finish. After what seemed like five seconds, there was another knock on the door. A co-worker showed up to tell Olivia that Mr. Davis wanted to speak to her.</p><p>&ldquo;I gotta go now,&rdquo; she said, standing up fast. &ldquo;Talk to you later, Haz?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; He gave her a nod and watched her strut towards the door. But when Olivia reached for the handle, instead of leaving right away, she lingered there for a moment before turning back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you gonna do?&rdquo; She asked, looking slightly worried.</p><p>&ldquo;I have an email to send,&rdquo; he told her with a smile.</p><p>Even though Olivia didn&rsquo;t get what her friend meant, she accepted that simple answer anyway and walked out of his office.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, there you are!&rdquo;</p><p>Kate grabbed Y/N the moment she&rsquo;d just arrived at the office. She wasn&rsquo;t even late, but from the way many others were staring at her, she guessed she&rsquo;d missed a whole lot already.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell Catherine I&rsquo;m gonna send her the proposal right away,&rdquo; she uttered and attempted to walk away, but Kate pulled her back just as fast.</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shook her head quickly. She&rsquo;d rarely seen Kate this excited while at work, and now this girl was smiling as if she&rsquo;d just won a one-month trip to Bali. So what Y/N hadn&rsquo;t heard might be some actual good news.</p><p>&ldquo;Jack fired the bitch this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s jaw went slack as her eyes popped opened. &ldquo;Is it&hellip;because of me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, silly.&rdquo; Kate snorted, eyes rolled upward. &ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve heard, she&rsquo;s been selling our ideas to one of our competitors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For real?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup, that&rsquo;s why she got so fed up and asked for a more detailed proposal. The first one you did was great.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I just&hellip;stayed up all night for nothing?&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s face scrunched up in annoyance, but her question was ignored when Jack stepped out of his office and spotted her speaking to his assistant.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Styles?&rdquo; He raised his voice, causing everyone to stare at Y/N, who didn&rsquo;t even flinch. As he repeated once again, Kate had to nudge the girl to remind her she was being called, and it was only then that Y/N snapped back to reality. Her whole face turned red from all this excessive attention. It was ironic how she kept forgetting her new name which was probably the one thing she could never shut up about.</p><p>&ldquo;Five minutes,&rdquo; Jack simply said before shutting his door.</p><p>Even though Kate leaned in and told Y/N &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the last person he&rsquo;d fire, don&rsquo;t worry&rdquo;, the girl was already shaking in her boots. Catherine had been working at this company for ten years and Jack made the decision to fire her in a minute. What if he thought Y/N had something to do with this and fired her too?</p><p><i>Oh no. </i>She swallowed hard before heading straight to his office, ignoring curious stares that were shifting her way. She wondered how many of these people were wishing for her to suffer the same fate as Catherine, still she must put her trust in Jack Coleman.</p><p><i>Right? Right, </i>she assured herself.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Y/N opened the door slowly. The creaking sound caught Jack&rsquo;s attention as he looked up from the computer and urged her to hurry up.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, before you fire me, you need to hear me out,&rdquo; Y/N spoke as soon as she closed the door. &ldquo;I have absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo; The man looked so confused, and now she was <i>also</i> confused.</p><p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m not here because I&rsquo;m in trouble?&rdquo; She asked quietly.</p><p>At this point, Jack couldn&rsquo;t keep a straight face anymore. He shook his head and began with a chuckle. &ldquo;No, why would you be in trouble, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;Why am I here then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to discuss our new strategy with the head of Client Service.&rdquo; His answer seemed to confuse her even more, so he pressed his lips into a smile, and finally told her, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re promoted by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>Those words together had turned Y/N paralyzed. Her limbs became stiff and her expression hardened. Now she could only hear different voices in her head shouting at each other. <i>Was he joking? He can&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s not April&rsquo;s Fool! But even if it was, Jack&rsquo;s not the type of person to joke about these kinds of things. Am I dreaming? Should I pinch myself?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>She pinched her own arm when he called her name.</p><p><i>Yup, definitely not dreaming.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, I have a question&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, go ahead.&rdquo; Jack started beaming when he saw the way his employee was fidgeting with her own fingers and nipping her bottom lip. He had imagined a much worse reaction, so she was actually doing better than his expectation.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</i> Honestly, Y/N was very grateful that Jack was patient with her. But his calmness was driving her insane. Now she was on the edge of her seat and she wasn&rsquo;t even sitting down! She was literally sweating when he leaned back and knitted his hands together. &ldquo;Well, since Catherine no longer works here, Elizabeth will be the new head of Media Relations, leaving her spot empty. And I think you&rsquo;re a great choice for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure this is a good idea?&rdquo; This question made Jack lift an eyebrow. He didn&rsquo;t say a word, yet she knew he wanted her to explain. And so she did. &ldquo;Everyone here said that I got special treatments because you&hellip;uhm&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I had feelings for you?&rdquo;</p><p>She swallowed hard and nodded quickly. Now she was glancing at all directions in the room to avoid looking at her boss when he stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, they weren&rsquo;t entirely wrong,&rdquo; he said, leaning back against the edge of his desk and crossing his arms. Those words were all it took for her eyes to shift back to his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>did</i> have feelings for you, and I&rsquo;ve always thought you were a great person. But this isn&rsquo;t high school, Y/N. I don&rsquo;t make decisions based on my feelings for someone. If you can do the job well, then congrats, you get the job. If not, then you have five minutes to pack your things and go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But people\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When you work in this industry, you should care less about what people think of you, and more about what you think of yourself,&rdquo; Jack asserted, smiling back at her. &ldquo;Are we good now?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded to agree without adding anything else.</p><p>&ldquo;Great. Now bring your laptop in here, there&rsquo;s a lot of work for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Once again, her answer was a single nod as she hurriedly reached for the door handle. But right before she exited the room, Jack stopped her quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;I almost forgot,&rdquo; he said with a soft smile. &ldquo;Welcome back, <i>Mrs. Styles</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;m home!!!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry chuckled as his wife jumped right into his arms the moment she walked through the door. She held him so tight, almost squeezing the air out of him, and he could already tell that something <i>big</i> had happened to her at work.</p><p>&ldquo;I have <i>great</i> news!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; He happily declared while grinning from ear to ear. &ldquo;But you go first.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I got promoted!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Those words pierced right through his ears like a bullet. Speechless, he let her drag him into another hug but this time all that he could show was a half-broken smile. Y/N instantly felt his reluctance and drew back to look him in the eyes. Her grin fell as fast as his when she noticed something wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not happy for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am. I am, I&rsquo;m just\u2014&rdquo; He paused right there. What could he possibly say now? That he&rsquo;d had lunch with his father and agreed to take over Styles Corporation in San Francisco? That he&rsquo;d done it for her but now she&rsquo;d got promoted and would most likely not willing to quit and move to another country with him? No! He couldn&rsquo;t tell her any of that!</p><p>So instead of saying the truth, he gave her exactly what she wanted to hear. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m just shocked. Wow, baby, this is great!&rdquo; He laughed, squeezing her hands even though he&rsquo;d never been more anxious before. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you. You&rsquo;re a boss now!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N leaned in and kissed his lips, mumbling a quiet &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; as she believed without his support she wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten this far. Her excitement had put him in a much tougher spot and now his heart was beating like a drum.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she pulled back to hold his face, still smiling like the Cheshire Cat. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your good news, love?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Shit.</i></p><p>He widened his eyes at her question, lips pressed together tightly. &ldquo;Well&hellip;uhm&hellip;Olivia bought free coffee for everyone at the office today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; Y/N gave her man a funny look. However, there was no sign that showed she was suspecting anything. It was almost normal for him to make no sense sometimes that his excitement over free coffee would actually make sense.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Now that I think about it, it&rsquo;s actually not as exciting as your good news.&rdquo; That was a terrible white lie, but Y/N was too thrilled to see it through at this point.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to celebrate!&rdquo; She declared, bouncing up and down like a child on Christmas morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna cook a big meal for both of us and we&rsquo;re gonna get so drunk tonight!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry held his breath as he watched the woman he loved dance her way into the kitchen. She had never looked happier, which made him feel even worse. He was blaming himself, still a part of him justified his impulsive decision by saying he&rsquo;d been given no other choice. Had he waited to come home and discuss it with her, the Colemans could&rsquo;ve sealed the deal and taken the company right under his nose. He thought he was doing it for both of them, mostly for her. But unfortunately, he couldn&rsquo;t have seen this coming.</p><p>Now standing in the middle of his living room like a stone statue, Harry asked himself the same question Olivia had asked him before, <i>what are you gonna do, Harry?</i></p>",

The trip was doubtlessly wonderful, and she\u2019d never felt more loved in her entire life. If she\u2019d had a choice, she probably would\u2019ve picked to stay on the island with Harry. But let\u2019s be realistic, how could they afford another expensive holiday if they neglected their jobs? Now it was time to focus on what really mattered for their future together. <i>Money.</i></p><p>Besides, Y/N did miss her desk at the office, and even though her co-workers weren\u2019t all angels. She was sure some of them missed her, if not all. When she came back, they would rush to her with open arms and said\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe proposal you sent me was crap.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>All eyes in the room shifted to Y/N, who was still trying to figure out what was happening. She\u2019d heard that everyone who had worked with <i>Catherine Daniels</i> had all the worst things to say about this woman. They said that she was terrible to people, that she was afraid of no one and wouldn\u2019t take criticism from anyone in this firm, that the only reason she was head of Media Relations was because she\u2019d been here the longest. This was actually the first time Y/N had spoken face to face with Catherine, and she kind of understood why the nickname <i>Catherine \u2018Dictator\u2019 </i>existed.</p><p>\u201cBut that was what the client\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough with the same excuses.\u201d Catherine scoffed. \u201cYou people in Client Service has <i>one</i> simple job, to negotiate with the clients so it\u2019s easier for <i>us</i>, the ones who actually have to do the hard work and handle the journalists.\u201d</p><p>Y/N almost said sorry for something that wasn\u2019t entirely her fault, in hope that it might put an end to the tension between them. Thankfully, Kate showed up just in time to back her up. She gave Catherine a dirty look, pulling Y/N to her side.</p><p>\u201cGo terrorize the people on your team, Catherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth is on maternity leave.\u201d Catherine responded with a sarcastic chuckle. \u201cWho else would I blame this for? You?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth was the head of Client Service, Y/N\u2019s department. Unlike Catherine, that woman was the sweetest and she would never talk down to any of her team members. While watching Kate and Catherine arguing, Y/N really wished Elizabeth would magically appear and make everything better again.</p><p>\u201cMr. Coleman will take over Liz\u2019s responsibilities until she gets back,\u201d Kate chided as she put both hands on her hips. \u201cSo maybe you should go tell him how <i>crappy</i> you think the proposal is? He\u2019ll be in his office tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Y/N almost forgot. There was <i>someone</i> in this company that Catherine was afraid of after all.</p><p>\u201cFeels good to be teacher\u2019s pet, huh?\u201d The hateful woman whispered to Y/N before turning back to Kate and said through gritted teeth, \u201cif she doesn\u2019t send me a better proposal by tomorrow, set me an appointment with Coleman. He needs to know when to fire his <i>favorite</i> employee.\u201d</p><p>As Catherine stormed away, Kate turned to her wide-eyed friend, looking extremely pissed off. It couldn\u2019t be more obvious that she loathed that woman as much as anyone here; however, Y/N\u2019s tolerance of such rude behaviors was the main reason she was fuming with rage.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have let her talk to you like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was just\u2026trying to do her job,\u201d Y/N mumbled, giving Kate a shrug. \u201cI mean\u2026it\u2019s probably difficult to deal with the media.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSis, it\u2019s the <i>client</i> who pays you money to deal with the media, so believe me, if the client wants the moon, you give them the moon! No question asked!\u201d Kate slammed both hands onto the table, nearly causing Y/N\u2019s coffee cup to fall over. \u201cCatherine always puts herself first and shits on all the others anyway. But don\u2019t worry, Jack will <i>definitely</i> defend you.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly what made Y/N worry. Jack would defend her, or at least try to fix her mistakes. After all she wasn\u2019t only his employee, but also his friend and might\u2019ve been something more in the past. Even though she knew he would always be fair, these people in the office did not, and they might just assume she was getting special treatments simply because she was his <i>favorite</i>. The smartest solution here was to give Catherine what she wanted. <i>Not</i> because she was afraid of Catherine (maybe a bit), but because she didn\u2019t want Jack\u2019s reputation ruined for helping her, <i>again</i>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cScrew. Me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, I\u2019m washing dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha, funny.\u201d Y/N shot her husband a glare as he turned to check her reaction. He expected her to laugh along. She always would no matter how lame his jokes were. But this time all she did was breathe out and carry on with whatever she was doing on her laptop. She\u2019d been working ever since she got home, and only stopped to eat dinner before getting back to work again. Harry was surely worried. The last time his wife worked this hard, she ended up passing out on her desk after consuming too much coffee, he nearly had a heart attack that day.</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d He dried his hands and headed towards where she sat at the table. \u201cMaybe you and I can Netflix and chill tonight?\u201d</p><p>Y/N giggled when his breath tickled her neck and he laid a soft kiss on her shoulder blade, throwing in a sweet <i>\u201cI love you\u201d</i> as if she didn\u2019t already know. Her husband was just trying to distract her from work, and even so, she let him. She should be distracted for a little while for her brain to function again, and he seemed to be in need of a little affection. When she turned to him, their lips met for an urgent wet kiss which sent him down on his knees by her side.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he muttered, all out of breath as his lips curved into a slop-sided grin. One of his hands were resting on her hip, the other on the backrest of the chair. \u201cPlay with me and I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay with you?\u201d Y/N chuckled as she cupped his face. \u201cIs this why you let Layla and Niall watch Treasure tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of parent you think I am?\u201d The man faked a faint gasp that made his wife giggle. \u201cActually, Layla\u2019s having dinner with her dad\u2019s family, and her stepmother is allergic to cats so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you let her use our daughter as a revenge tool.\u201d She jokingly lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me a bad parent then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry! No!\u201d Y/N burst out laughing when her husband took both of her wrists with one hand and started ticking her with the other. She fought to get away, accidentally slipping right off her chair and collapsing right on top of him. Now the table had turned, she blocked his arms and executed the tickle torture until he laughed so hard he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cI surrender! Surrender!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot surrender after what you did to me, baby. That\u2019s not the rule.\u201d Y/N knew he could\u2019ve stopped her easily, yet he still let her win. So she showed some mercy by letting him suffer for a little more before raising her hands to call a truce. Harry combed his fingers through his messy locks, breathing heavily and flashing her a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done playing with you. Can I please go now?\u201d</p><p>When she patted his chest and attempted to move, Harry quickly sat up, fingers clutching her thighs to keep her still. He knew she could just brush off his hands and get back to work, but it was her choice to stay in his lap. So he flashed her a cheeky grin. \u201cBut I\u2019m not done playing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m serious.\u201d She sighed, gently stroking his hair. He was like a baby now, pouting and nuzzling her neck, pleading for attention, which she would gladly give him if Jack\u2019s reputation and her own weren\u2019t hanging by a thread. \u201cI need to get this proposal done by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always working overtime and now you\u2019re working at home too,\u201d he said with a big frown. \u201cI feel like no one beside Jack acknowledges your effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! Thank you! I mean, I love my job but I gotta admit most people in PR are assholes.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t hold back another smile when she turned serious and started counting on her ten fingers to illustrate her point to him. \u201cSo take ten people at my office, four of them will hate me, the next four don\u2019t give a damn about me but they love the drama and believe dumb rumors anyway, the two people left are Jack and Kate.\u201d</p><p>Harry pressed a kiss to his wife\u2019s cheek, laughing as he tried to cheer her up, \u201cpositively speaking, your two supporters are your boss and your boss\u2019 assistant. You still win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you put it that way,\u201d she said, beaming at him. \u201cWell, I\u2019m only working this hard because we need money for our future family. So when we <i>finally</i> get super rich, it\u2019s <i>over</i> for them. I might even quit the job and we can go on honeymoon every weekend. Sounds great, huh?\u201d</p><p>Harry stayed on the floor after his wife had kissed him and returned to her laptop. \u201cFeels good to just imagine,\u201d she said in a sing-song voice. However, he knew there was also truth behind that joke, that everything could be much better if they were wealthy people, that she could have the life he\u2019d promised them both, no more extra hours at the office just to impress people who weren\u2019t so nice to her.</p><p>The opportunity was right on the table, all he needed was to swallow his pride and seize it. And because of her, he might actually consider working things out with his dad.</p><p>The next morning, Harry could barely pay attention to anything else. He sat in his office, staring at a half-finished email to his dad\u2019s assistant which he\u2019d written last night, trying to decide if he should send it. He just wanted an appointment with Devlin, but then what? What was he gonna say? He didn\u2019t want to just apologize for doing nothing wrong only to get this over with. And would Devlin trust him enough to hand him the CEO chair after everything? Maybe he should phone Y/N and ask for her opinion. Even though she\u2019d been on board with this idea since the beginning, and even trying to convince him to go for it, he didn\u2019t think he should make this decision on his own. But on second thought, he should wait until he saw her at home, because something like this shouldn\u2019t be discussed over a phone call.</p><p>There was a knock on the door when Harry was having a debate with himself. He shut the laptop and told the person to come in, Olivia then entered, wearing a massive grin on her face.</p><p>\u201cGot you coffee!\u201d She exclaimed happily and placed the cup down on his desk. </p><p>\u201cOh, thanks.\u201d He raised an eyebrow as she sat down in front of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yesterday was my birthday so today I bought coffee for everyone.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she said it, Harry\u2019s face scrunched up in guilt. He pinched the bride of his nose and muttered under his breath, \u201cshit. I\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Ollie\u2026I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d The blonde giggled as she shook her head. It didn\u2019t take an expert to see that she was in a <i>much</i> better mood than usual. And Harry was already suspecting a reason behind her strange attitude. \u201cI had the best birthday though,\u201d she confessed, the grin on her face grew twice bigger.</p><p>Harry recognized that grin. He\u2019d been in a relationship for five years, how could he not? It was as clear as daylight! \u201cOkay, who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d Olivia arched an eyebrow. Harry knew her better than most people, and <i>that</i> right there was her iconic <i>'I-know-what-you\u2019re-talking-about-but-I\u2019m-just-pretending\u2019</i> face.</p><p>\u201cThe guy who made this birthday so<i> 'special\u2019</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is the word special in air-quotes?\u201d Olivia giggled. Then it only took a couple seconds for reluctance to wash off the happiness on her face. He was second guessing if it was something he\u2019d said that unintentionally upset her, but he didn\u2019t really need to ask as she was gonna tell him anyway.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded, eyebrows furrowed as he leaned forward, getting a bit impatient. \u201cIs the guy a drug dealer or\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Jesus no!\u201d Another soft giggle escaped her red lips. \u201cIt\u2019s Jack, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Harry shouted and slammed his fist onto the desk, almost giving the girl a heart attack. Then he started laughing as her cheeks turned pink. \u201cI saw you two dancing at my wedding and I knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, calm down,\u201d she told him, rolling her eyes even though his reaction was undeniably adorable. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Jack. Well, it is kind of related to him, but mostly you and\u2026<i>your dad</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad? Are they doing business together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of\u2026\u201d Olivia pursed her lips while fidgeting with the pencils right in front of her. It seemed like she was struggling to find the right way to break this news. \u201cMore like\u2026Devlin\u2019s selling Styles Corporation to the Colemans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking?\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes went wide as his mouth hung opened. He was hoping Olivia would crack up and tell him he\u2019d been fooled, but she seemed too serious for him to believe this was just a lousy prank.</p><p>\u201cJack told me last night. I just assumed after\u2026what happened, Devlin wouldn\u2019t discuss this with you in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even talk.\u201d Harry blew up his cheeks, tapping his fingers on the desk impatiently. Now their conversation had sunk back to silence. While Olivia was trying to come up with something to say, Harry kept on staring at the email he\u2019d been hesitating to finish. After what seemed like five seconds, there was another knock on the door. A co-worker showed up to tell Olivia that Mr. Davis wanted to speak to her.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go now,\u201d she said, standing up fast. \u201cTalk to you later, Haz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He gave her a nod and watched her strut towards the door. But when Olivia reached for the handle, instead of leaving right away, she lingered there for a moment before turning back to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d She asked, looking slightly worried.</p><p>\u201cI have an email to send,\u201d he told her with a smile.</p><p>Even though Olivia didn\u2019t get what her friend meant, she accepted that simple answer anyway and walked out of his office.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cY/N, there you are!\u201d</p><p>Kate grabbed Y/N the moment she\u2019d just arrived at the office. She wasn\u2019t even late, but from the way many others were staring at her, she guessed she\u2019d missed a whole lot already.</p><p>\u201cTell Catherine I\u2019m gonna send her the proposal right away,\u201d she uttered and attempted to walk away, but Kate pulled her back just as fast.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head quickly. She\u2019d rarely seen Kate this excited while at work, and now this girl was smiling as if she\u2019d just won a one-month trip to Bali. So what Y/N hadn\u2019t heard might be some actual good news.</p><p>\u201cJack fired the bitch this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N\u2019s jaw went slack as her eyes popped opened. \u201cIs it\u2026because of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, silly.\u201d Kate snorted, eyes rolled upward. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, she\u2019s been selling our ideas to one of our competitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, that\u2019s why she got so fed up and asked for a more detailed proposal. The first one you did was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I just\u2026stayed up all night for nothing?\u201d Y/N\u2019s face scrunched up in annoyance, but her question was ignored when Jack stepped out of his office and spotted her speaking to his assistant.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Styles?\u201d He raised his voice, causing everyone to stare at Y/N, who didn\u2019t even flinch. As he repeated once again, Kate had to nudge the girl to remind her she was being called, and it was only then that Y/N snapped back to reality. Her whole face turned red from all this excessive attention. It was ironic how she kept forgetting her new name which was probably the one thing she could never shut up about.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d Jack simply said before shutting his door.</p><p>Even though Kate leaned in and told Y/N \u201cyou\u2019re the last person he\u2019d fire, don\u2019t worry\u201d, the girl was already shaking in her boots. Catherine had been working at this company for ten years and Jack made the decision to fire her in a minute. What if he thought Y/N had something to do with this and fired her too?</p><p><i>Oh no. </i>She swallowed hard before heading straight to his office, ignoring curious stares that were shifting her way. She wondered how many of these people were wishing for her to suffer the same fate as Catherine, still she must put her trust in Jack Coleman.</p><p><i>Right? Right, </i>she assured herself.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Y/N opened the door slowly. The creaking sound caught Jack\u2019s attention as he looked up from the computer and urged her to hurry up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, before you fire me, you need to hear me out,\u201d Y/N spoke as soon as she closed the door. \u201cI have absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d The man looked so confused, and now she was <i>also</i> confused.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not here because I\u2019m in trouble?\u201d She asked quietly.</p><p>At this point, Jack couldn\u2019t keep a straight face anymore. He shook his head and began with a chuckle. \u201cNo, why would you be in trouble, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026Why am I here then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to discuss our new strategy with the head of Client Service.\u201d His answer seemed to confuse her even more, so he pressed his lips into a smile, and finally told her, \u201cyou\u2019re promoted by the way.\u201d</p><p>Those words together had turned Y/N paralyzed. Her limbs became stiff and her expression hardened. Now she could only hear different voices in her head shouting at each other. <i>Was he joking? He can\u2019t! It\u2019s not April\u2019s Fool! But even if it was, Jack\u2019s not the type of person to joke about these kinds of things. Am I dreaming? Should I pinch myself?</i></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>She pinched her own arm when he called her name.</p><p><i>Yup, definitely not dreaming.</i></p><p>\u201cUhm, I have a question\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d Jack started beaming when he saw the way his employee was fidgeting with her own fingers and nipping her bottom lip. He had imagined a much worse reaction, so she was actually doing better than his expectation.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d</i> Honestly, Y/N was very grateful that Jack was patient with her. But his calmness was driving her insane. Now she was on the edge of her seat and she wasn\u2019t even sitting down! She was literally sweating when he leaned back and knitted his hands together. \u201cWell, since Catherine no longer works here, Elizabeth will be the new head of Media Relations, leaving her spot empty. And I think you\u2019re a great choice for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is a good idea?\u201d This question made Jack lift an eyebrow. He didn\u2019t say a word, yet she knew he wanted her to explain. And so she did. \u201cEveryone here said that I got special treatments because you\u2026uhm\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I had feelings for you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and nodded quickly. Now she was glancing at all directions in the room to avoid looking at her boss when he stood up.</p><p>\u201cWell, they weren\u2019t entirely wrong,\u201d he said, leaning back against the edge of his desk and crossing his arms. Those words were all it took for her eyes to shift back to his face.</p><p>\u201cI <i>did</i> have feelings for you, and I\u2019ve always thought you were a great person. But this isn\u2019t high school, Y/N. I don\u2019t make decisions based on my feelings for someone. If you can do the job well, then congrats, you get the job. If not, then you have five minutes to pack your things and go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you work in this industry, you should care less about what people think of you, and more about what you think of yourself,\u201d Jack asserted, smiling back at her. \u201cAre we good now?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded to agree without adding anything else.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now bring your laptop in here, there\u2019s a lot of work for you.\u201d</p><p>Once again, her answer was a single nod as she hurriedly reached for the door handle. But right before she exited the room, Jack stopped her quickly.</p><p>\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d he said with a soft smile. \u201cWelcome back, <i>Mrs. Styles</i>.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m home!!!\u201d</i></p><p>Harry chuckled as his wife jumped right into his arms the moment she walked through the door. She held him so tight, almost squeezing the air out of him, and he could already tell that something <i>big</i> had happened to her at work.</p><p>\u201cI have <i>great</i> news!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I!\u201d He happily declared while grinning from ear to ear. \u201cBut you go first.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI got promoted!\u201d</i></p><p>Those words pierced right through his ears like a bullet. Speechless, he let her drag him into another hug but this time all that he could show was a half-broken smile. Y/N instantly felt his reluctance and drew back to look him in the eyes. Her grin fell as fast as his when she noticed something wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not happy for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I am, I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d He paused right there. What could he possibly say now? That he\u2019d had lunch with his father and agreed to take over Styles Corporation in San Francisco? That he\u2019d done it for her but now she\u2019d got promoted and would most likely not willing to quit and move to another country with him? No! He couldn\u2019t tell her any of that!</p><p>So instead of saying the truth, he gave her exactly what she wanted to hear. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just shocked. Wow, baby, this is great!\u201d He laughed, squeezing her hands even though he\u2019d never been more anxious before. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you. You\u2019re a boss now!\u201d</p><p>Y/N leaned in and kissed his lips, mumbling a quiet \u201cI love you\u201d as she believed without his support she wouldn\u2019t have gotten this far. Her excitement had put him in a much tougher spot and now his heart was beating like a drum.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she pulled back to hold his face, still smiling like the Cheshire Cat. \u201cWhat\u2019s your good news, love?\u201d</p><p><i>Shit.</i></p><p>He widened his eyes at her question, lips pressed together tightly. \u201cWell\u2026uhm\u2026Olivia bought free coffee for everyone at the office today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Y/N gave her man a funny look. However, there was no sign that showed she was suspecting anything. It was almost normal for him to make no sense sometimes that his excitement over free coffee would actually make sense.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Now that I think about it, it\u2019s actually not as exciting as your good news.\u201d That was a terrible white lie, but Y/N was too thrilled to see it through at this point.</p><p>\u201cWe need to celebrate!\u201d She declared, bouncing up and down like a child on Christmas morning. \u201cI\u2019m gonna cook a big meal for both of us and we\u2019re gonna get so drunk tonight!\u201d</p><p>Harry held his breath as he watched the woman he loved dance her way into the kitchen. She had never looked happier, which made him feel even worse. He was blaming himself, still a part of him justified his impulsive decision by saying he\u2019d been given no other choice. Had he waited to come home and discuss it with her, the Colemans could\u2019ve sealed the deal and taken the company right under his nose. He thought he was doing it for both of them, mostly for her. But unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t have seen this coming.</p><p>Now standing in the middle of his living room like a stone statue, Harry asked himself the same question Olivia had asked him before, <i>what are you gonna do, Harry?</i></p></p>",

The trip was doubtlessly wonderful, and she\u2019d never felt more loved in her entire life. If she\u2019d had a choice, she probably would\u2019ve picked to stay on the island with Harry. But let\u2019s be realistic, how could they afford another expensive holiday if they neglected their jobs? Now it was time to focus on what really mattered for their future together. <i>Money.</i></p><p>Besides, Y/N did miss her desk at the office, and even though her co-workers weren\u2019t all angels. She was sure some of them missed her, if not all. When she came back, they would rush to her with open arms and said\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe proposal you sent me was crap.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>All eyes in the room shifted to Y/N, who was still trying to figure out what was happening. She\u2019d heard that everyone who had worked with <i>Catherine Daniels</i> had all the worst things to say about this woman. They said that she was terrible to people, that she was afraid of no one and wouldn\u2019t take criticism from anyone in this firm, that the only reason she was head of Media Relations was because she\u2019d been here the longest. This was actually the first time Y/N had spoken face to face with Catherine, and she kind of understood why the nickname <i>Catherine \u2018Dictator\u2019 </i>existed.</p><p>\u201cBut that was what the client\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough with the same excuses.\u201d Catherine scoffed. \u201cYou people in Client Service has <i>one</i> simple job, to negotiate with the clients so it\u2019s easier for <i>us</i>, the ones who actually have to do the hard work and handle the journalists.\u201d</p><p>Y/N almost said sorry for something that wasn\u2019t entirely her fault, in hope that it might put an end to the tension between them. Thankfully, Kate showed up just in time to back her up. She gave Catherine a dirty look, pulling Y/N to her side.</p><p>\u201cGo terrorize the people on your team, Catherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth is on maternity leave.\u201d Catherine responded with a sarcastic chuckle. \u201cWho else would I blame this for? You?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth was the head of Client Service, Y/N\u2019s department. Unlike Catherine, that woman was the sweetest and she would never talk down to any of her team members. While watching Kate and Catherine arguing, Y/N really wished Elizabeth would magically appear and make everything better again.</p><p>\u201cMr. Coleman will take over Liz\u2019s responsibilities until she gets back,\u201d Kate chided as she put both hands on her hips. \u201cSo maybe you should go tell him how <i>crappy</i> you think the proposal is? He\u2019ll be in his office tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Y/N almost forgot. There was <i>someone</i> in this company that Catherine was afraid of after all.</p><p>\u201cFeels good to be teacher\u2019s pet, huh?\u201d The hateful woman whispered to Y/N before turning back to Kate and said through gritted teeth, \u201cif she doesn\u2019t send me a better proposal by tomorrow, set me an appointment with Coleman. He needs to know when to fire his <i>favorite</i> employee.\u201d</p><p>As Catherine stormed away, Kate turned to her wide-eyed friend, looking extremely pissed off. It couldn\u2019t be more obvious that she loathed that woman as much as anyone here; however, Y/N\u2019s tolerance of such rude behaviors was the main reason she was fuming with rage.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have let her talk to you like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was just\u2026trying to do her job,\u201d Y/N mumbled, giving Kate a shrug. \u201cI mean\u2026it\u2019s probably difficult to deal with the media.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSis, it\u2019s the <i>client</i> who pays you money to deal with the media, so believe me, if the client wants the moon, you give them the moon! No question asked!\u201d Kate slammed both hands onto the table, nearly causing Y/N\u2019s coffee cup to fall over. \u201cCatherine always puts herself first and shits on all the others anyway. But don\u2019t worry, Jack will <i>definitely</i> defend you.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly what made Y/N worry. Jack would defend her, or at least try to fix her mistakes. After all she wasn\u2019t only his employee, but also his friend and might\u2019ve been something more in the past. Even though she knew he would always be fair, these people in the office did not, and they might just assume she was getting special treatments simply because she was his <i>favorite</i>. The smartest solution here was to give Catherine what she wanted. <i>Not</i> because she was afraid of Catherine (maybe a bit), but because she didn\u2019t want Jack\u2019s reputation ruined for helping her, <i>again</i>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cScrew. Me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, I\u2019m washing dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha, funny.\u201d Y/N shot her husband a glare as he turned to check her reaction. He expected her to laugh along. She always would no matter how lame his jokes were. But this time all she did was breathe out and carry on with whatever she was doing on her laptop. She\u2019d been working ever since she got home, and only stopped to eat dinner before getting back to work again. Harry was surely worried. The last time his wife worked this hard, she ended up passing out on her desk after consuming too much coffee, he nearly had a heart attack that day.</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d He dried his hands and headed towards where she sat at the table. \u201cMaybe you and I can Netflix and chill tonight?\u201d</p><p>Y/N giggled when his breath tickled her neck and he laid a soft kiss on her shoulder blade, throwing in a sweet <i>\u201cI love you\u201d</i> as if she didn\u2019t already know. Her husband was just trying to distract her from work, and even so, she let him. She should be distracted for a little while for her brain to function again, and he seemed to be in need of a little affection. When she turned to him, their lips met for an urgent wet kiss which sent him down on his knees by her side.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he muttered, all out of breath as his lips curved into a slop-sided grin. One of his hands were resting on her hip, the other on the backrest of the chair. \u201cPlay with me and I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay with you?\u201d Y/N chuckled as she cupped his face. \u201cIs this why you let Layla and Niall watch Treasure tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of parent you think I am?\u201d The man faked a faint gasp that made his wife giggle. \u201cActually, Layla\u2019s having dinner with her dad\u2019s family, and her stepmother is allergic to cats so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you let her use our daughter as a revenge tool.\u201d She jokingly lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me a bad parent then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry! No!\u201d Y/N burst out laughing when her husband took both of her wrists with one hand and started ticking her with the other. She fought to get away, accidentally slipping right off her chair and collapsing right on top of him. Now the table had turned, she blocked his arms and executed the tickle torture until he laughed so hard he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cI surrender! Surrender!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot surrender after what you did to me, baby. That\u2019s not the rule.\u201d Y/N knew he could\u2019ve stopped her easily, yet he still let her win. So she showed some mercy by letting him suffer for a little more before raising her hands to call a truce. Harry combed his fingers through his messy locks, breathing heavily and flashing her a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done playing with you. Can I please go now?\u201d</p><p>When she patted his chest and attempted to move, Harry quickly sat up, fingers clutching her thighs to keep her still. He knew she could just brush off his hands and get back to work, but it was her choice to stay in his lap. So he flashed her a cheeky grin. \u201cBut I\u2019m not done playing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m serious.\u201d She sighed, gently stroking his hair. He was like a baby now, pouting and nuzzling her neck, pleading for attention, which she would gladly give him if Jack\u2019s reputation and her own weren\u2019t hanging by a thread. \u201cI need to get this proposal done by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always working overtime and now you\u2019re working at home too,\u201d he said with a big frown. \u201cI feel like no one beside Jack acknowledges your effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! Thank you! I mean, I love my job but I gotta admit most people in PR are assholes.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t hold back another smile when she turned serious and started counting on her ten fingers to illustrate her point to him. \u201cSo take ten people at my office, four of them will hate me, the next four don\u2019t give a damn about me but they love the drama and believe dumb rumors anyway, the two people left are Jack and Kate.\u201d</p><p>Harry pressed a kiss to his wife\u2019s cheek, laughing as he tried to cheer her up, \u201cpositively speaking, your two supporters are your boss and your boss\u2019 assistant. You still win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you put it that way,\u201d she said, beaming at him. \u201cWell, I\u2019m only working this hard because we need money for our future family. So when we <i>finally</i> get super rich, it\u2019s <i>over</i> for them. I might even quit the job and we can go on honeymoon every weekend. Sounds great, huh?\u201d</p><p>Harry stayed on the floor after his wife had kissed him and returned to her laptop. \u201cFeels good to just imagine,\u201d she said in a sing-song voice. However, he knew there was also truth behind that joke, that everything could be much better if they were wealthy people, that she could have the life he\u2019d promised them both, no more extra hours at the office just to impress people who weren\u2019t so nice to her.</p><p>The opportunity was right on the table, all he needed was to swallow his pride and seize it. And because of her, he might actually consider working things out with his dad.</p><p>The next morning, Harry could barely pay attention to anything else. He sat in his office, staring at a half-finished email to his dad\u2019s assistant which he\u2019d written last night, trying to decide if he should send it. He just wanted an appointment with Devlin, but then what? What was he gonna say? He didn\u2019t want to just apologize for doing nothing wrong only to get this over with. And would Devlin trust him enough to hand him the CEO chair after everything? Maybe he should phone Y/N and ask for her opinion. Even though she\u2019d been on board with this idea since the beginning, and even trying to convince him to go for it, he didn\u2019t think he should make this decision on his own. But on second thought, he should wait until he saw her at home, because something like this shouldn\u2019t be discussed over a phone call.</p><p>There was a knock on the door when Harry was having a debate with himself. He shut the laptop and told the person to come in, Olivia then entered, wearing a massive grin on her face.</p><p>\u201cGot you coffee!\u201d She exclaimed happily and placed the cup down on his desk. </p><p>\u201cOh, thanks.\u201d He raised an eyebrow as she sat down in front of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yesterday was my birthday so today I bought coffee for everyone.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she said it, Harry\u2019s face scrunched up in guilt. He pinched the bride of his nose and muttered under his breath, \u201cshit. I\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Ollie\u2026I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d The blonde giggled as she shook her head. It didn\u2019t take an expert to see that she was in a <i>much</i> better mood than usual. And Harry was already suspecting a reason behind her strange attitude. \u201cI had the best birthday though,\u201d she confessed, the grin on her face grew twice bigger.</p><p>Harry recognized that grin. He\u2019d been in a relationship for five years, how could he not? It was as clear as daylight! \u201cOkay, who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d Olivia arched an eyebrow. Harry knew her better than most people, and <i>that</i> right there was her iconic <i>'I-know-what-you\u2019re-talking-about-but-I\u2019m-just-pretending\u2019</i> face.</p><p>\u201cThe guy who made this birthday so<i> 'special\u2019</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is the word special in air-quotes?\u201d Olivia giggled. Then it only took a couple seconds for reluctance to wash off the happiness on her face. He was second guessing if it was something he\u2019d said that unintentionally upset her, but he didn\u2019t really need to ask as she was gonna tell him anyway.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded, eyebrows furrowed as he leaned forward, getting a bit impatient. \u201cIs the guy a drug dealer or\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Jesus no!\u201d Another soft giggle escaped her red lips. \u201cIt\u2019s Jack, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Harry shouted and slammed his fist onto the desk, almost giving the girl a heart attack. Then he started laughing as her cheeks turned pink. \u201cI saw you two dancing at my wedding and I knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, calm down,\u201d she told him, rolling her eyes even though his reaction was undeniably adorable. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Jack. Well, it is kind of related to him, but mostly you and\u2026<i>your dad</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad? Are they doing business together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of\u2026\u201d Olivia pursed her lips while fidgeting with the pencils right in front of her. It seemed like she was struggling to find the right way to break this news. \u201cMore like\u2026Devlin\u2019s selling Styles Corporation to the Colemans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking?\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes went wide as his mouth hung opened. He was hoping Olivia would crack up and tell him he\u2019d been fooled, but she seemed too serious for him to believe this was just a lousy prank.</p><p>\u201cJack told me last night. I just assumed after\u2026what happened, Devlin wouldn\u2019t discuss this with you in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even talk.\u201d Harry blew up his cheeks, tapping his fingers on the desk impatiently. Now their conversation had sunk back to silence. While Olivia was trying to come up with something to say, Harry kept on staring at the email he\u2019d been hesitating to finish. After what seemed like five seconds, there was another knock on the door. A co-worker showed up to tell Olivia that Mr. Davis wanted to speak to her.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go now,\u201d she said, standing up fast. \u201cTalk to you later, Haz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He gave her a nod and watched her strut towards the door. But when Olivia reached for the handle, instead of leaving right away, she lingered there for a moment before turning back to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d She asked, looking slightly worried.</p><p>\u201cI have an email to send,\u201d he told her with a smile.</p><p>Even though Olivia didn\u2019t get what her friend meant, she accepted that simple answer anyway and walked out of his office.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cY/N, there you are!\u201d</p><p>Kate grabbed Y/N the moment she\u2019d just arrived at the office. She wasn\u2019t even late, but from the way many others were staring at her, she guessed she\u2019d missed a whole lot already.</p><p>\u201cTell Catherine I\u2019m gonna send her the proposal right away,\u201d she uttered and attempted to walk away, but Kate pulled her back just as fast.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head quickly. She\u2019d rarely seen Kate this excited while at work, and now this girl was smiling as if she\u2019d just won a one-month trip to Bali. So what Y/N hadn\u2019t heard might be some actual good news.</p><p>\u201cJack fired the bitch this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N\u2019s jaw went slack as her eyes popped opened. \u201cIs it\u2026because of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, silly.\u201d Kate snorted, eyes rolled upward. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, she\u2019s been selling our ideas to one of our competitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, that\u2019s why she got so fed up and asked for a more detailed proposal. The first one you did was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I just\u2026stayed up all night for nothing?\u201d Y/N\u2019s face scrunched up in annoyance, but her question was ignored when Jack stepped out of his office and spotted her speaking to his assistant.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Styles?\u201d He raised his voice, causing everyone to stare at Y/N, who didn\u2019t even flinch. As he repeated once again, Kate had to nudge the girl to remind her she was being called, and it was only then that Y/N snapped back to reality. Her whole face turned red from all this excessive attention. It was ironic how she kept forgetting her new name which was probably the one thing she could never shut up about.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d Jack simply said before shutting his door.</p><p>Even though Kate leaned in and told Y/N \u201cyou\u2019re the last person he\u2019d fire, don\u2019t worry\u201d, the girl was already shaking in her boots. Catherine had been working at this company for ten years and Jack made the decision to fire her in a minute. What if he thought Y/N had something to do with this and fired her too?</p><p><i>Oh no. </i>She swallowed hard before heading straight to his office, ignoring curious stares that were shifting her way. She wondered how many of these people were wishing for her to suffer the same fate as Catherine, still she must put her trust in Jack Coleman.</p><p><i>Right? Right, </i>she assured herself.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Y/N opened the door slowly. The creaking sound caught Jack\u2019s attention as he looked up from the computer and urged her to hurry up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, before you fire me, you need to hear me out,\u201d Y/N spoke as soon as she closed the door. \u201cI have absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d The man looked so confused, and now she was <i>also</i> confused.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not here because I\u2019m in trouble?\u201d She asked quietly.</p><p>At this point, Jack couldn\u2019t keep a straight face anymore. He shook his head and began with a chuckle. \u201cNo, why would you be in trouble, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026Why am I here then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to discuss our new strategy with the head of Client Service.\u201d His answer seemed to confuse her even more, so he pressed his lips into a smile, and finally told her, \u201cyou\u2019re promoted by the way.\u201d</p><p>Those words together had turned Y/N paralyzed. Her limbs became stiff and her expression hardened. Now she could only hear different voices in her head shouting at each other. <i>Was he joking? He can\u2019t! It\u2019s not April\u2019s Fool! But even if it was, Jack\u2019s not the type of person to joke about these kinds of things. Am I dreaming? Should I pinch myself?</i></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>She pinched her own arm when he called her name.</p><p><i>Yup, definitely not dreaming.</i></p><p>\u201cUhm, I have a question\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d Jack started beaming when he saw the way his employee was fidgeting with her own fingers and nipping her bottom lip. He had imagined a much worse reaction, so she was actually doing better than his expectation.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d</i> Honestly, Y/N was very grateful that Jack was patient with her. But his calmness was driving her insane. Now she was on the edge of her seat and she wasn\u2019t even sitting down! She was literally sweating when he leaned back and knitted his hands together. \u201cWell, since Catherine no longer works here, Elizabeth will be the new head of Media Relations, leaving her spot empty. And I think you\u2019re a great choice for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is a good idea?\u201d This question made Jack lift an eyebrow. He didn\u2019t say a word, yet she knew he wanted her to explain. And so she did. \u201cEveryone here said that I got special treatments because you\u2026uhm\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I had feelings for you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and nodded quickly. Now she was glancing at all directions in the room to avoid looking at her boss when he stood up.</p><p>\u201cWell, they weren\u2019t entirely wrong,\u201d he said, leaning back against the edge of his desk and crossing his arms. Those words were all it took for her eyes to shift back to his face.</p><p>\u201cI <i>did</i> have feelings for you, and I\u2019ve always thought you were a great person. But this isn\u2019t high school, Y/N. I don\u2019t make decisions based on my feelings for someone. If you can do the job well, then congrats, you get the job. If not, then you have five minutes to pack your things and go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you work in this industry, you should care less about what people think of you, and more about what you think of yourself,\u201d Jack asserted, smiling back at her. \u201cAre we good now?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded to agree without adding anything else.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now bring your laptop in here, there\u2019s a lot of work for you.\u201d</p><p>Once again, her answer was a single nod as she hurriedly reached for the door handle. But right before she exited the room, Jack stopped her quickly.</p><p>\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d he said with a soft smile. \u201cWelcome back, <i>Mrs. Styles</i>.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m home!!!\u201d</i></p><p>Harry chuckled as his wife jumped right into his arms the moment she walked through the door. She held him so tight, almost squeezing the air out of him, and he could already tell that something <i>big</i> had happened to her at work.</p><p>\u201cI have <i>great</i> news!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I!\u201d He happily declared while grinning from ear to ear. \u201cBut you go first.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI got promoted!\u201d</i></p><p>Those words pierced right through his ears like a bullet. Speechless, he let her drag him into another hug but this time all that he could show was a half-broken smile. Y/N instantly felt his reluctance and drew back to look him in the eyes. Her grin fell as fast as his when she noticed something wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not happy for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I am, I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d He paused right there. What could he possibly say now? That he\u2019d had lunch with his father and agreed to take over Styles Corporation in San Francisco? That he\u2019d done it for her but now she\u2019d got promoted and would most likely not willing to quit and move to another country with him? No! He couldn\u2019t tell her any of that!</p><p>So instead of saying the truth, he gave her exactly what she wanted to hear. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just shocked. Wow, baby, this is great!\u201d He laughed, squeezing her hands even though he\u2019d never been more anxious before. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you. You\u2019re a boss now!\u201d</p><p>Y/N leaned in and kissed his lips, mumbling a quiet \u201cI love you\u201d as she believed without his support she wouldn\u2019t have gotten this far. Her excitement had put him in a much tougher spot and now his heart was beating like a drum.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she pulled back to hold his face, still smiling like the Cheshire Cat. \u201cWhat\u2019s your good news, love?\u201d</p><p><i>Shit.</i></p><p>He widened his eyes at her question, lips pressed together tightly. \u201cWell\u2026uhm\u2026Olivia bought free coffee for everyone at the office today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Y/N gave her man a funny look. However, there was no sign that showed she was suspecting anything. It was almost normal for him to make no sense sometimes that his excitement over free coffee would actually make sense.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Now that I think about it, it\u2019s actually not as exciting as your good news.\u201d That was a terrible white lie, but Y/N was too thrilled to see it through at this point.</p><p>\u201cWe need to celebrate!\u201d She declared, bouncing up and down like a child on Christmas morning. \u201cI\u2019m gonna cook a big meal for both of us and we\u2019re gonna get so drunk tonight!\u201d</p><p>Harry held his breath as he watched the woman he loved dance her way into the kitchen. She had never looked happier, which made him feel even worse. He was blaming himself, still a part of him justified his impulsive decision by saying he\u2019d been given no other choice. Had he waited to come home and discuss it with her, the Colemans could\u2019ve sealed the deal and taken the company right under his nose. He thought he was doing it for both of them, mostly for her. But unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t have seen this coming.</p><p>Now standing in the middle of his living room like a stone statue, Harry asked himself the same question Olivia had asked him before, <i>what are you gonna do, Harry?</i></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>(from the <i><b>Flatmate Trilogy</b>: <a href=\"https://heyyyharry.tumblr.com/post/184688087920/two-hearts-one-home\" target=\"_blank\">Two Hearts, One Home</a></i>)</h2><p><b>&hellip;in which Y/N deals with more problems at work, and Harry makes a life changing decision.</b></p><ul><li><b>Word count: </b><i>4.1k</i></li><li><b>Chapter 1: <a href=\"https://heyyyharry.tumblr.com/post/184893258044/honeymoon\" target=\"_blank\">Honeymoon</a> </b>- Y/N and Harry go to Greece for their honeymoon and run into a couple they hate.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/733251218-two-hearts-one-home-harry-styles-boss\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wattpad link</b></a></li></ul><p>.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Y/N wasn&rsquo;t a workaholic, she kept telling herself that, but it did feel good to finally get back to work after her honeymoon. The trip was doubtlessly wonderful, and she&rsquo;d never felt more loved in her entire life. If she&rsquo;d had a choice, she probably would&rsquo;ve picked to stay on the island with Harry. But let&rsquo;s be realistic, how could they afford another expensive holiday if they neglected their jobs? Now it was time to focus on what really mattered for their future together. <i>Money.</i></p><p>Besides, Y/N did miss her desk at the office, and even though her co-workers weren&rsquo;t all angels. She was sure some of them missed her, if not all. When she came back, they would rush to her with open arms and said&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The proposal you sent me was crap.&rdquo;</p><p>All eyes in the room shifted to Y/N, who was still trying to figure out what was happening. She&rsquo;d heard that everyone who had worked with <i>Catherine Daniels</i> had all the worst things to say about this woman. They said that she was terrible to people, that she was afraid of no one and wouldn&rsquo;t take criticism from anyone in this firm, that the only reason she was head of Media Relations was because she&rsquo;d been here the longest. This was actually the first time Y/N had spoken face to face with Catherine, and she kind of understood why the nickname <i>Catherine &lsquo;Dictator&rsquo; </i>existed.</p><p>&ldquo;But that was what the client&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enough with the same excuses.&rdquo; Catherine scoffed. &ldquo;You people in Client Service has <i>one</i> simple job, to negotiate with the clients so it&rsquo;s easier for <i>us</i>, the ones who actually have to do the hard work and handle the journalists.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N almost said sorry for something that wasn&rsquo;t entirely her fault, in hope that it might put an end to the tension between them. Thankfully, Kate showed up just in time to back her up. She gave Catherine a dirty look, pulling Y/N to her side.</p><p>&ldquo;Go terrorize the people on your team, Catherine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Elizabeth is on maternity leave.&rdquo; Catherine responded with a sarcastic chuckle. &ldquo;Who else would I blame this for? You?&rdquo;</p><p>Elizabeth was the head of Client Service, Y/N&rsquo;s department. Unlike Catherine, that woman was the sweetest and she would never talk down to any of her team members. While watching Kate and Catherine arguing, Y/N really wished Elizabeth would magically appear and make everything better again.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Coleman will take over Liz&rsquo;s responsibilities until she gets back,&rdquo; Kate chided as she put both hands on her hips. &ldquo;So maybe you should go tell him how <i>crappy</i> you think the proposal is? He&rsquo;ll be in his office tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N almost forgot. There was <i>someone</i> in this company that Catherine was afraid of after all.</p><p>&ldquo;Feels good to be teacher&rsquo;s pet, huh?&rdquo; The hateful woman whispered to Y/N before turning back to Kate and said through gritted teeth, &ldquo;if she doesn&rsquo;t send me a better proposal by tomorrow, set me an appointment with Coleman. He needs to know when to fire his <i>favorite</i> employee.&rdquo;</p><p>As Catherine stormed away, Kate turned to her wide-eyed friend, looking extremely pissed off. It couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious that she loathed that woman as much as anyone here; however, Y/N&rsquo;s tolerance of such rude behaviors was the main reason she was fuming with rage.</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have let her talk to you like that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was just&hellip;trying to do her job,&rdquo; Y/N mumbled, giving Kate a shrug. &ldquo;I mean&hellip;it&rsquo;s probably difficult to deal with the media.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sis, it&rsquo;s the <i>client</i> who pays you money to deal with the media, so believe me, if the client wants the moon, you give them the moon! No question asked!&rdquo; Kate slammed both hands onto the table, nearly causing Y/N&rsquo;s coffee cup to fall over. &ldquo;Catherine always puts herself first and shits on all the others anyway. But don&rsquo;t worry, Jack will <i>definitely</i> defend you.&rdquo;</p><p>That was exactly what made Y/N worry. Jack would defend her, or at least try to fix her mistakes. After all she wasn&rsquo;t only his employee, but also his friend and might&rsquo;ve been something more in the past. Even though she knew he would always be fair, these people in the office did not, and they might just assume she was getting special treatments simply because she was his <i>favorite</i>. The smartest solution here was to give Catherine what she wanted. <i>Not</i> because she was afraid of Catherine (maybe a bit), but because she didn&rsquo;t want Jack&rsquo;s reputation ruined for helping her, <i>again</i>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Screw. Me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Later, I&rsquo;m washing dishes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haha, funny.&rdquo; Y/N shot her husband a glare as he turned to check her reaction. He expected her to laugh along. She always would no matter how lame his jokes were. But this time all she did was breathe out and carry on with whatever she was doing on her laptop. She&rsquo;d been working ever since she got home, and only stopped to eat dinner before getting back to work again. Harry was surely worried. The last time his wife worked this hard, she ended up passing out on her desk after consuming too much coffee, he nearly had a heart attack that day.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe&hellip;&rdquo; He dried his hands and headed towards where she sat at the table. &ldquo;Maybe you and I can Netflix and chill tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N giggled when his breath tickled her neck and he laid a soft kiss on her shoulder blade, throwing in a sweet <i>&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;</i> as if she didn&rsquo;t already know. Her husband was just trying to distract her from work, and even so, she let him. She should be distracted for a little while for her brain to function again, and he seemed to be in need of a little affection. When she turned to him, their lips met for an urgent wet kiss which sent him down on his knees by her side.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he muttered, all out of breath as his lips curved into a slop-sided grin. One of his hands were resting on her hip, the other on the backrest of the chair. &ldquo;Play with me and I&rsquo;ll let you go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Play with you?&rdquo; Y/N chuckled as she cupped his face. &ldquo;Is this why you let Layla and Niall watch Treasure tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of parent you think I am?&rdquo; The man faked a faint gasp that made his wife giggle. &ldquo;Actually, Layla&rsquo;s having dinner with her dad&rsquo;s family, and her stepmother is allergic to cats so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you let her use our daughter as a revenge tool.&rdquo; She jokingly lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you calling me a bad parent then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! No!&rdquo; Y/N burst out laughing when her husband took both of her wrists with one hand and started ticking her with the other. She fought to get away, accidentally slipping right off her chair and collapsing right on top of him. Now the table had turned, she blocked his arms and executed the tickle torture until he laughed so hard he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;I surrender! Surrender!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You cannot surrender after what you did to me, baby. That&rsquo;s not the rule.&rdquo; Y/N knew he could&rsquo;ve stopped her easily, yet he still let her win. So she showed some mercy by letting him suffer for a little more before raising her hands to call a truce. Harry combed his fingers through his messy locks, breathing heavily and flashing her a lazy smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done playing with you. Can I please go now?&rdquo;</p><p>When she patted his chest and attempted to move, Harry quickly sat up, fingers clutching her thighs to keep her still. He knew she could just brush off his hands and get back to work, but it was her choice to stay in his lap. So he flashed her a cheeky grin. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not done playing with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;m serious.&rdquo; She sighed, gently stroking his hair. He was like a baby now, pouting and nuzzling her neck, pleading for attention, which she would gladly give him if Jack&rsquo;s reputation and her own weren&rsquo;t hanging by a thread. &ldquo;I need to get this proposal done by morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always working overtime and now you&rsquo;re working at home too,&rdquo; he said with a big frown. &ldquo;I feel like no one beside Jack acknowledges your effort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly! Thank you! I mean, I love my job but I gotta admit most people in PR are assholes.&rdquo; Harry couldn&rsquo;t hold back another smile when she turned serious and started counting on her ten fingers to illustrate her point to him. &ldquo;So take ten people at my office, four of them will hate me, the next four don&rsquo;t give a damn about me but they love the drama and believe dumb rumors anyway, the two people left are Jack and Kate.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry pressed a kiss to his wife&rsquo;s cheek, laughing as he tried to cheer her up, &ldquo;positively speaking, your two supporters are your boss and your boss&rsquo; assistant. You still win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you put it that way,&rdquo; she said, beaming at him. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m only working this hard because we need money for our future family. So when we <i>finally</i> get super rich, it&rsquo;s <i>over</i> for them. I might even quit the job and we can go on honeymoon every weekend. Sounds great, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stayed on the floor after his wife had kissed him and returned to her laptop. &ldquo;Feels good to just imagine,&rdquo; she said in a sing-song voice. However, he knew there was also truth behind that joke, that everything could be much better if they were wealthy people, that she could have the life he&rsquo;d promised them both, no more extra hours at the office just to impress people who weren&rsquo;t so nice to her.</p><p>The opportunity was right on the table, all he needed was to swallow his pride and seize it. And because of her, he might actually consider working things out with his dad.</p><p>The next morning, Harry could barely pay attention to anything else. He sat in his office, staring at a half-finished email to his dad&rsquo;s assistant which he&rsquo;d written last night, trying to decide if he should send it. He just wanted an appointment with Devlin, but then what? What was he gonna say? He didn&rsquo;t want to just apologize for doing nothing wrong only to get this over with. And would Devlin trust him enough to hand him the CEO chair after everything? Maybe he should phone Y/N and ask for her opinion. Even though she&rsquo;d been on board with this idea since the beginning, and even trying to convince him to go for it, he didn&rsquo;t think he should make this decision on his own. But on second thought, he should wait until he saw her at home, because something like this shouldn&rsquo;t be discussed over a phone call.</p><p>There was a knock on the door when Harry was having a debate with himself. He shut the laptop and told the person to come in, Olivia then entered, wearing a massive grin on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Got you coffee!&rdquo; She exclaimed happily and placed the cup down on his desk. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks.&rdquo; He raised an eyebrow as she sat down in front of him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the occasion?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yesterday was my birthday so today I bought coffee for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as she said it, Harry&rsquo;s face scrunched up in guilt. He pinched the bride of his nose and muttered under his breath, &ldquo;shit. I&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry, Ollie&hellip;I forgot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; The blonde giggled as she shook her head. It didn&rsquo;t take an expert to see that she was in a <i>much</i> better mood than usual. And Harry was already suspecting a reason behind her strange attitude. &ldquo;I had the best birthday though,&rdquo; she confessed, the grin on her face grew twice bigger.</p><p>Harry recognized that grin. He&rsquo;d been in a relationship for five years, how could he not? It was as clear as daylight! &ldquo;Okay, who is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo; Olivia arched an eyebrow. Harry knew her better than most people, and <i>that</i> right there was her iconic <i>'I-know-what-you&rsquo;re-talking-about-but-I&rsquo;m-just-pretending&rsquo;</i> face.</p><p>&ldquo;The guy who made this birthday so<i> 'special&rsquo;</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why is the word special in air-quotes?&rdquo; Olivia giggled. Then it only took a couple seconds for reluctance to wash off the happiness on her face. He was second guessing if it was something he&rsquo;d said that unintentionally upset her, but he didn&rsquo;t really need to ask as she was gonna tell him anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I want you to know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He nodded, eyebrows furrowed as he leaned forward, getting a bit impatient. &ldquo;Is the guy a drug dealer or&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! Jesus no!&rdquo; Another soft giggle escaped her red lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jack, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; Harry shouted and slammed his fist onto the desk, almost giving the girl a heart attack. Then he started laughing as her cheeks turned pink. &ldquo;I saw you two dancing at my wedding and I knew it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, calm down,&rdquo; she told him, rolling her eyes even though his reaction was undeniably adorable. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about Jack. Well, it is kind of related to him, but mostly you and&hellip;<i>your dad</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dad? Are they doing business together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kind of&hellip;&rdquo; Olivia pursed her lips while fidgeting with the pencils right in front of her. It seemed like she was struggling to find the right way to break this news. &ldquo;More like&hellip;Devlin&rsquo;s selling Styles Corporation to the Colemans.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes went wide as his mouth hung opened. He was hoping Olivia would crack up and tell him he&rsquo;d been fooled, but she seemed too serious for him to believe this was just a lousy prank.</p><p>&ldquo;Jack told me last night. I just assumed after&hellip;what happened, Devlin wouldn&rsquo;t discuss this with you in advance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even talk.&rdquo; Harry blew up his cheeks, tapping his fingers on the desk impatiently. Now their conversation had sunk back to silence. While Olivia was trying to come up with something to say, Harry kept on staring at the email he&rsquo;d been hesitating to finish. After what seemed like five seconds, there was another knock on the door. A co-worker showed up to tell Olivia that Mr. Davis wanted to speak to her.</p><p>&ldquo;I gotta go now,&rdquo; she said, standing up fast. &ldquo;Talk to you later, Haz?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; He gave her a nod and watched her strut towards the door. But when Olivia reached for the handle, instead of leaving right away, she lingered there for a moment before turning back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you gonna do?&rdquo; She asked, looking slightly worried.</p><p>&ldquo;I have an email to send,&rdquo; he told her with a smile.</p><p>Even though Olivia didn&rsquo;t get what her friend meant, she accepted that simple answer anyway and walked out of his office.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, there you are!&rdquo;</p><p>Kate grabbed Y/N the moment she&rsquo;d just arrived at the office. She wasn&rsquo;t even late, but from the way many others were staring at her, she guessed she&rsquo;d missed a whole lot already.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell Catherine I&rsquo;m gonna send her the proposal right away,&rdquo; she uttered and attempted to walk away, but Kate pulled her back just as fast.</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shook her head quickly. She&rsquo;d rarely seen Kate this excited while at work, and now this girl was smiling as if she&rsquo;d just won a one-month trip to Bali. So what Y/N hadn&rsquo;t heard might be some actual good news.</p><p>&ldquo;Jack fired the bitch this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s jaw went slack as her eyes popped opened. &ldquo;Is it&hellip;because of me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, silly.&rdquo; Kate snorted, eyes rolled upward. &ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve heard, she&rsquo;s been selling our ideas to one of our competitors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For real?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup, that&rsquo;s why she got so fed up and asked for a more detailed proposal. The first one you did was great.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I just&hellip;stayed up all night for nothing?&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s face scrunched up in annoyance, but her question was ignored when Jack stepped out of his office and spotted her speaking to his assistant.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Styles?&rdquo; He raised his voice, causing everyone to stare at Y/N, who didn&rsquo;t even flinch. As he repeated once again, Kate had to nudge the girl to remind her she was being called, and it was only then that Y/N snapped back to reality. Her whole face turned red from all this excessive attention. It was ironic how she kept forgetting her new name which was probably the one thing she could never shut up about.</p><p>&ldquo;Five minutes,&rdquo; Jack simply said before shutting his door.</p><p>Even though Kate leaned in and told Y/N &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the last person he&rsquo;d fire, don&rsquo;t worry&rdquo;, the girl was already shaking in her boots. Catherine had been working at this company for ten years and Jack made the decision to fire her in a minute. What if he thought Y/N had something to do with this and fired her too?</p><p><i>Oh no. </i>She swallowed hard before heading straight to his office, ignoring curious stares that were shifting her way. She wondered how many of these people were wishing for her to suffer the same fate as Catherine, still she must put her trust in Jack Coleman.</p><p><i>Right? Right, </i>she assured herself.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Y/N opened the door slowly. The creaking sound caught Jack&rsquo;s attention as he looked up from the computer and urged her to hurry up.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, before you fire me, you need to hear me out,&rdquo; Y/N spoke as soon as she closed the door. &ldquo;I have absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo; The man looked so confused, and now she was <i>also</i> confused.</p><p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m not here because I&rsquo;m in trouble?&rdquo; She asked quietly.</p><p>At this point, Jack couldn&rsquo;t keep a straight face anymore. He shook his head and began with a chuckle. &ldquo;No, why would you be in trouble, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;Why am I here then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to discuss our new strategy with the head of Client Service.&rdquo; His answer seemed to confuse her even more, so he pressed his lips into a smile, and finally told her, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re promoted by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>Those words together had turned Y/N paralyzed. Her limbs became stiff and her expression hardened. Now she could only hear different voices in her head shouting at each other. <i>Was he joking? He can&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s not April&rsquo;s Fool! But even if it was, Jack&rsquo;s not the type of person to joke about these kinds of things. Am I dreaming? Should I pinch myself?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>She pinched her own arm when he called her name.</p><p><i>Yup, definitely not dreaming.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, I have a question&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, go ahead.&rdquo; Jack started beaming when he saw the way his employee was fidgeting with her own fingers and nipping her bottom lip. He had imagined a much worse reaction, so she was actually doing better than his expectation.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</i> Honestly, Y/N was very grateful that Jack was patient with her. But his calmness was driving her insane. Now she was on the edge of her seat and she wasn&rsquo;t even sitting down! She was literally sweating when he leaned back and knitted his hands together. &ldquo;Well, since Catherine no longer works here, Elizabeth will be the new head of Media Relations, leaving her spot empty. And I think you&rsquo;re a great choice for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure this is a good idea?&rdquo; This question made Jack lift an eyebrow. He didn&rsquo;t say a word, yet she knew he wanted her to explain. And so she did. &ldquo;Everyone here said that I got special treatments because you&hellip;uhm&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I had feelings for you?&rdquo;</p><p>She swallowed hard and nodded quickly. Now she was glancing at all directions in the room to avoid looking at her boss when he stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, they weren&rsquo;t entirely wrong,&rdquo; he said, leaning back against the edge of his desk and crossing his arms. Those words were all it took for her eyes to shift back to his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>did</i> have feelings for you, and I&rsquo;ve always thought you were a great person. But this isn&rsquo;t high school, Y/N. I don&rsquo;t make decisions based on my feelings for someone. If you can do the job well, then congrats, you get the job. If not, then you have five minutes to pack your things and go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But people&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When you work in this industry, you should care less about what people think of you, and more about what you think of yourself,&rdquo; Jack asserted, smiling back at her. &ldquo;Are we good now?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded to agree without adding anything else.</p><p>&ldquo;Great. Now bring your laptop in here, there&rsquo;s a lot of work for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Once again, her answer was a single nod as she hurriedly reached for the door handle. But right before she exited the room, Jack stopped her quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;I almost forgot,&rdquo; he said with a soft smile. &ldquo;Welcome back, <i>Mrs. Styles</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;m home!!!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry chuckled as his wife jumped right into his arms the moment she walked through the door. She held him so tight, almost squeezing the air out of him, and he could already tell that something <i>big</i> had happened to her at work.</p><p>&ldquo;I have <i>great</i> news!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; He happily declared while grinning from ear to ear. &ldquo;But you go first.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I got promoted!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Those words pierced right through his ears like a bullet. Speechless, he let her drag him into another hug but this time all that he could show was a half-broken smile. Y/N instantly felt his reluctance and drew back to look him in the eyes. Her grin fell as fast as his when she noticed something wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not happy for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am. I am, I&rsquo;m just&mdash;&rdquo; He paused right there. What could he possibly say now? That he&rsquo;d had lunch with his father and agreed to take over Styles Corporation in San Francisco? That he&rsquo;d done it for her but now she&rsquo;d got promoted and would most likely not willing to quit and move to another country with him? No! He couldn&rsquo;t tell her any of that!</p><p>So instead of saying the truth, he gave her exactly what she wanted to hear. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m just shocked. Wow, baby, this is great!&rdquo; He laughed, squeezing her hands even though he&rsquo;d never been more anxious before. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you. You&rsquo;re a boss now!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N leaned in and kissed his lips, mumbling a quiet &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; as she believed without his support she wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten this far. Her excitement had put him in a much tougher spot and now his heart was beating like a drum.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she pulled back to hold his face, still smiling like the Cheshire Cat. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your good news, love?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Shit.</i></p><p>He widened his eyes at her question, lips pressed together tightly. &ldquo;Well&hellip;uhm&hellip;Olivia bought free coffee for everyone at the office today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; Y/N gave her man a funny look. However, there was no sign that showed she was suspecting anything. It was almost normal for him to make no sense sometimes that his excitement over free coffee would actually make sense.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Now that I think about it, it&rsquo;s actually not as exciting as your good news.&rdquo; That was a terrible white lie, but Y/N was too thrilled to see it through at this point.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to celebrate!&rdquo; She declared, bouncing up and down like a child on Christmas morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna cook a big meal for both of us and we&rsquo;re gonna get so drunk tonight!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry held his breath as he watched the woman he loved dance her way into the kitchen. She had never looked happier, which made him feel even worse. He was blaming himself, still a part of him justified his impulsive decision by saying he&rsquo;d been given no other choice. Had he waited to come home and discuss it with her, the Colemans could&rsquo;ve sealed the deal and taken the company right under his nose. He thought he was doing it for both of them, mostly for her. But unfortunately, he couldn&rsquo;t have seen this coming.</p><p>Now standing in the middle of his living room like a stone statue, Harry asked himself the same question Olivia had asked him before, <i>what are you gonna do, Harry?</i></p></p>",

It is Saturday night, he has tomorrow off, and somehow\nhe\u2019s found his way to this awesome\ndive bar in eastern Phoenix together with Mitchell, Sarah, and a guy\nwho Mitch has known since they were 12. Toby\u2019s cool and local, so\nhe knows all the best places to go. They\nhave been sampling various spirits from Arizona-based distilleries\nall night, and Harry has a small buzz going. Tonight is nice and\neasy. Just hanging out with\nfriends, drinking and listening to music. Life is good.</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nme. Excuse me. I said, excuse me!\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry\nsighs and turns around. A\npretty blond girl in jeans and a floral top is wagging her finger at\nhim. He had done well up until now, his hair covered by a beanie, his\ntattoos hidden by a long-sleeved shirt, wearing\nhis prescription glasses, and\nhis fingers free of rings. He\nopens his mouth, but before he can offer a professionally friendly\ngreeting, she shoves him aside and shouts at the bartender. He cannot\nhelp his cackle.<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry,\nbut nothing stands between Lauren and drinks.\u201d<br/></p><!-- more --><p>A\nshort girl with brown hair smiles at him as her friend fires off a\nrapid round of orders.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell,\nthe place is jumpin\u2019 jumpin\u2019 so I don\u2019t blame her.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs\nthat your friend over there? The cute dark-haired guy in the Rolling\nStones t-shirt?\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry\nhas never thought of Mitch as being particularly cute, and right now\nhis mate just looks dorky as he is gesturing wildly about .. probably\nguitars .. while Toby and\nSarah look on patiently.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d\nhe offers, scratching his\nhead, trying to figure out\nwhat makes Mitch look cute when he is just being his big dork self.\nHarry\u2019s slight buzz isn\u2019t helping with\nlogical thinking.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>The\ngirl is about to say something else, but her blonde friend grabs her\nattention with several glasses of frozen\nmargaritas. She shoots Mitch another glance before they walk away.\nHarry makes a mental note to tell Mitch about the girl calling him\ncute. Mitch isn\u2019t the most confident of guys, and Harry loves him\nso much and wants to see him blossom. Surely being told that random\ngirls were checking him out would help with that confidence. He\norders another drink. Maybe just tell Mitch\nwhen Sarah\u2019s not around. She\nknows how to punch people.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>The\nDestiny Child\u2019s cover band is replaced by an enthusiastic\nsinger-songwriter whose voice doesn\u2019t quite\nmatch her\nenthusiasm. Harry is nursing\na glass of water \u2013 old habits die hard \u2013 and watches the crowd\ndancing to a hokey song about truck drivers. The short girl from\nbefore pops into view as she bounces towards\nthe bar singing along to\nevery word.<br/></p><p>This\ntime Harry pays attention.<br/></p><p>She\ndance-walks up to the bar, orders another margarita, and then turns\nto him with a big grin on her face. She\nhas big, brown eyes and a wide mouth.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cKristen\nis really terrible, but we try to support her the best we can. But I\nneed alcohol if I have to endure another song.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry,\nwho is Kristen?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh,\nKristen\u2019s my friend. She\u2019s the girl on stage,\u201d she nods towards\nthe stage where the singer-songwriter has indeed begun another song.\n\u201cWe all come out like once a month or whenever, and we do it out of\nlove and friendship. Girls support each other, y\u2019know? But she\nain\u2019t no Taylor Swift, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ve tried getting her\ninterested in crochet\nor something, but Kristen\u2019s determined.\nBless her heart.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cUhm,\u201d\nHarry says, trying to think of something to say that doesn\u2019t\ninvolve Taylor or the music business. \u201cUhm, your\nfriend has interesting songs,\nabsolutely.\nDoes she, er, write her own\nlyrics?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHer\nex-boyfriend was a truck driver, so she has an entire collection of\nsongs about trucks\u201d The girl rolls her eyes fondly. \u201cShe\nreally needs to get laid by someone who doesn\u2019t give a shit about\nbig wheels. Speaking\nof getting laid, let\u2019s talk\nabout that cute friend of yours.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMitch\nis already seeing someone,\nsorry.\u201d<br/></p><p>Her\nface falls a bit, but a sip of margarita restores her\nsoon enough.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nhave an accent. Where you from?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cEngland.\nAre you from Phoenix?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nEngland? That\u2019s so cool. Do you live here or something?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJust\nhere for a few days. For work.\u201d He shoots her a dimpled smile, the\nsmile that always works. It\nis Saturday night, he\u2019s had a few drinks, and she\u2019s kinda\nsweet. Behind them, Kristen\nbegins a new song. The sweet girl in front of him grabs Harry\u2019s\nhand, leaves her drink on the counter, and drags him to the dance\nfloor. Harry throws back his head and laughs.<br/></p><p>Later,\nthey are against a wall outside the club. Harry\nisn\u2019t sure but he thinks\nthe girl\u2019s name is Ella. He\nknows she tastes like oranges\nand sunshine. She is short,\ncurvy, and a good kisser.<br/></p><p>Even\nlater, they are in an Uber on the way to her place. Ella\nis soft and warm and\nfull of laughter. He hides\nhis face in her neck and she strokes his hair. She is so very sweet\nand he could stay here all night. Ella pulls on his hair, so his face\nshoots back up, she catches his mouth and bites his lower lip. Maybe\nshe isn\u2019t as sweet as Harry first thought. Interesting.<br/></p><p>And\nthen it is very, very late. Harry is getting dressed, while Ella is\ncalling him an Uber. Ella doesn\u2019t ask for his number and he doesn\u2019t\nask for hers.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nbeen fun,\u201d he tells her, looking at her fondly. Her skin is still\nflushed, her brown hair still messy, and he thinks she is beautiful.\nHe loves the slow, lazy way she is getting out of bed, and shuffling\ninto a dressing gown. There is something about women at this part of\nthe night. They are soft, and languid, and relaxed. Impulsively\nhe leans over and kisses her.<br/></p><p>She\nleans back to look at him.<br/></p><p>\u201cThis\nis going to sound really bad, but I don\u2019t think I got your name at\nany stage. And you know what?\nI don\u2019t think I want to know. Have\na nice life, mystery boy. It\u2019s been good meeting you\u201d<br/></p><p>And\nwith those words she presses one last kiss to his lips, Harry slips\nout to the waiting car, and the night is over.<br/></p>",

Toby&rsquo;s cool and local, so\nhe knows all the best places to go. They\nhave been sampling various spirits from Arizona-based distilleries\nall night, and Harry has a small buzz going. Tonight is nice and\neasy. Just hanging out with\nfriends, drinking and listening to music. Life is good.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Excuse\nme. Excuse me. I said, excuse me!&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>Harry\nsighs and turns around. A\npretty blond girl in jeans and a floral top is wagging her finger at\nhim. He had done well up until now, his hair covered by a beanie, his\ntattoos hidden by a long-sleeved shirt, wearing\nhis prescription glasses, and\nhis fingers free of rings. He\nopens his mouth, but before he can offer a professionally friendly\ngreeting, she shoves him aside and shouts at the bartender. He cannot\nhelp his cackle.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry,\nbut nothing stands between Lauren and drinks.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n</p>",
