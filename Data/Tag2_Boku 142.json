High, seeing as that was the day the previous week\u2019s assignments were due for grading. Granted, you were thankful that it wasn\u2019t Monday\u2019s, but seven days was still seven days, no matter which day you started from.</p><p>Of course today was Tuesday, and you were not in class today. No, you were holed up in your room back at the dorms, attempting to smother yourself in your multitude of blankets and tissues. Tears streamed freely down your face, and it took everything in you to force yourself to breath, although your body seemed to have forgotten how to do so. Despite the lack of oxygen all you wanted to do was scream, but you couldn\u2019t do that, then someone would know that there was something wrong, and you couldn\u2019t have that. No, your pain needed to remain a secret, to protect you from ridicule and to save everyone from having another burden. </p><p>Little did you know, your classmates were spending their free study period (graciously given by Aizawa, so that he could take a nap) discussing your whereabouts. Many of them had begun to worry about you, having noticed that you\u2019d become less social, and spent more time alone in your room than you normally would have.

They had both shouted at you through the small speaker of your cell phone, the volume jarring your thoughts, rendering you unable to respond. Did they not understand how terrible you had already felt upon seeing the grade for yourself yesterday morning? You could feel tears begin to well up in your eyes again, but this time they were accompanied by choked sobs as you retreated into your own figure, eyes screwing shut painfully. You wrapped your arms around yourself, fingers digging into the flesh of your upper arms as you tilted your body to the side, falling to the floor and trying to condense yourself even further. </p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be as smart as everyone else?\u201d You whispered to yourself, earning no response from your empty room, you sobbed into your arms again, burrowing your face into them. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be as smart as Katsuki?..\u201d</p><p>The doorknob to your room rattled, twisting open aggressively, and Bakugo swung it open, despite how dark it was beyond your door, his eyes immediately landing on your meek figure that lay collapsed on the floor.

You didn\u2019t fight him, you didn\u2019t have the energy to. All the crying, the stress, and the ensuing exhaustion making your limbs too heavy to use against him. You were yanked upright and situated in his lap, your back pressed against his chest. He lifted one of your hands to his mouth, pressing a kiss to the knuckle of each finger before replying to you. </p><p>\u201cHow could you think that? </p><p>Your eyebrows knitted together, how could you <i>not</i> think that?

I hope this makes you feel a little bit better though! </p><p><b>Warnings: Fluff, description/mentions of a panic attack &amp; self doubt, swearing</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br /></p><p>Tuesday&rsquo;s were the worst day of the week at U.A. High, seeing as that was the day the previous week&rsquo;s assignments were due for grading. Granted, you were thankful that it wasn&rsquo;t Monday&rsquo;s, but seven days was still seven days, no matter which day you started from.</p><p>Of course today was Tuesday, and you were not in class today. No, you were holed up in your room back at the dorms, attempting to smother yourself in your multitude of blankets and tissues. Tears streamed freely down your face, and it took everything in you to force yourself to breath, although your body seemed to have forgotten how to do so. Despite the lack of oxygen all you wanted to do was scream, but you couldn&rsquo;t do that, then someone would know that there was something wrong, and you couldn&rsquo;t have that. No, your pain needed to remain a secret, to protect you from ridicule and to save everyone from having another burden. </p><p>Little did you know, your classmates were spending their free study period (graciously given by Aizawa, so that he could take a nap) discussing your whereabouts. Many of them had begun to worry about you, having noticed that you&rsquo;d become less social, and spent more time alone in your room than you normally would have. You had always enjoyed being with everyone, and coming to class to learn and improve your quirk, so why were you not here today? Several of them had jumped to the worst, and most ridiculous conclusions, that they could come up with. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe something bad happened? What if she&rsquo;s sick and she can&rsquo;t even get out of bed!&rdquo; Midoriya was panicking, Iida and Uraraka stood nearby, seemingly sharing his worry. </p><p>&ldquo;I think one of us should go check on her? (Y/n) isn&rsquo;t like this, she would have told one of us if she couldn&rsquo;t be here today,&rdquo; Uraraka rubbed the back of her neck as she spoke, looking around for a volunteer. </p><p>The students of class 1-A looked at each other expectantly and hesitantly. What if you wanted to be left alone, could any of them truly handle being shut out by you? The emotional light of the entire class depended on you, whether you realized it or not. On numerous occasions you had been there for each of them at least once, if not several times. For crying out loud, you were more defensive of those you cared for than Midoriya himself, and you cared for everyone. You jumped headfirst into arguments, playing the mediator, and you even jumped in front of people in battle. What were they to do if you suddenly didn&rsquo;t want to surround yourself with them anymore, to provide the support they all needed, and to provide you with the same support. </p><p>&ldquo;How about you idiots leave me to worry about <i>my</i> girlfriend, huh? All you fucking extras, standing around like a bunch of weaklings. Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to be heroes?&rdquo; Bakugo stood on the outskirts of the group of students, his backed turned to the rest of them as he made his way to the door. &ldquo;If (y/n) needs us, then it&rsquo;s our job as heroes to help those in need, and here you all are, sitting on your asses like a bunch of idiots!&rdquo;</p><p>The door to the classroom slammed open and shut again in the blink of an eye, leaving the remaining students with a sense of shame. Bakugo was right, they all knew he was. You were there anytime anyone needed anything, and none of them had the courage to reach out to you when you needed them most. Hopefully Bakugo would be able to bring you back if he returned, so they could express themselves to you. </p><p>&mdash; </p><p>You slowly let your phone drift from between your fingertips, allowing it to fall to the floor. You had just received a call from your parents, who were absolutely <i>livid</i> about your slipping grades upon seeing that you had failed a test from last week. They had both shouted at you through the small speaker of your cell phone, the volume jarring your thoughts, rendering you unable to respond. Did they not understand how terrible you had already felt upon seeing the grade for yourself yesterday morning? You could feel tears begin to well up in your eyes again, but this time they were accompanied by choked sobs as you retreated into your own figure, eyes screwing shut painfully. You wrapped your arms around yourself, fingers digging into the flesh of your upper arms as you tilted your body to the side, falling to the floor and trying to condense yourself even further. </p><p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I just be as smart as everyone else?&rdquo; You whispered to yourself, earning no response from your empty room, you sobbed into your arms again, burrowing your face into them. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I just be as smart as Katsuki?..&rdquo;</p><p>The doorknob to your room rattled, twisting open aggressively, and Bakugo swung it open, despite how dark it was beyond your door, his eyes immediately landing on your meek figure that lay collapsed on the floor.

He has slim arms and torso, small shoulders, narrow eyes that dip at the edges. He seems to get easily confused based on his expressions I was looking at or is expressive when he is concerned, angry. Similar to kiri, he too talks with his hands just in a different way. He points at things a lot both using and while not using his quirk, or in some way always expresses his emotions outward with his hand and arm gestures if that makes any sense. Hands are away from his body a lot of the time and makes sense with his quirk. (Cant be carrying electricity off his clothes.) That\u2019s my little observations.</p>",
