        "body": "<h1>It&rsquo;s 2 am and wanted to write some multiverse stuff lol</h1><p>Summary: Tony messed up something in the lab. The result is two versions of himself appearing in the middle of his kitchen. (I feel like I should mention, the two universes are pretty much made up and not Marvel canon)</p><p>&ldquo;Why am I so short? Forgot to take my vitamins or something?&rdquo; Stark from earth 8001 snorted and looked down at Tony as he took off his sunglasses, an amused smile playing on his face at Tony&rsquo;s scrunched up angry expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down short stuff, before your goatee catches on fire and you explode.&rdquo; That seemed to earn a &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; From the Earth 2990 version of himself that just made Tony&rsquo;s list.</p><p>Although they were versions of himself, they didn&rsquo;t look identical like Tony. They were taller and a bit more muscular, one of them almost as tall as Steve, and their eyes were of electric blue instead of amber brown like his own. </p><p>&ldquo;Am I always this annoying?&rdquo; Tony huffed and turned to Stephen, who has been levitating in the common room for the past 10 minutes. The man ignored him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, pretty much,&rdquo; Rhodey said instead with a fond smile  &ldquo;but we don&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself.&rdquo; Pepper playfully shoved him in the shoulder at that, and the two of them giggled on the couch like a pair of teenage girls. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, can you hear me from down there, or do I need to get a megaphone? You copy? Good. I&rsquo;m not annoying, I&rsquo;m charismatic, Tinkerbell. There&rsquo;s a difference. You&rsquo;re just mad you can&rsquo;t grasp it yet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also a line between being a jackass and a comedian, and you&rsquo;ve crossed it since you arrived.&rdquo; Earth 2990 said with a be amused chuckle, typing something on his watch. At the frustrated sigh, the other man (the other him?) Let out, Tony guessed the job wasn&rsquo;t doing it for him. &ldquo;Me. We. You, whatever. I can&rsquo;t get this thing to work. You had any luck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tsk.&rdquo; Stark shook his head &ldquo; Thought it makes sense. Communication Networks must be different in every universe and their signal must be jacked because of the time and location difference. There could be a possibility that the phone numbers or communication links we&rsquo;re trying to access got&hellip;messed up in a way. </p><p>Like, maybe now that we&rsquo;re in this universe, we&rsquo;re a part of it and everything that tied us to our world can&rsquo;t be accessed anymore?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that seems right,&rdquo;  Earth 2990 nodded, and Tony decided that he&rsquo;ll have to find names for him too. &ldquo;but how do we find a way to communicate with the people in our world?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we can create a communication link of our own.&rdquo; Tony jumped in the conversation &ldquo; a common network if you will.

                "content": "<p><h1>It&rsquo;s 2 am and wanted to write some multiverse stuff lol</h1><p>Summary: Tony messed up something in the lab. The result is two versions of himself appearing in the middle of his kitchen. (I feel like I should mention, the two universes are pretty much made up and not Marvel canon)</p><p>&ldquo;Why am I so short? Forgot to take my vitamins or something?&rdquo; Stark from earth 8001 snorted and looked down at Tony as he took off his sunglasses, an amused smile playing on his face at Tony&rsquo;s scrunched up angry expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down short stuff, before your goatee catches on fire and you explode.&rdquo; That seemed to earn a &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; From the Earth 2990 version of himself that just made Tony&rsquo;s list.</p><p>Although they were versions of himself, they didn&rsquo;t look identical like Tony. They were taller and a bit more muscular, one of them almost as tall as Steve, and their eyes were of electric blue instead of amber brown like his own. </p><p>&ldquo;Am I always this annoying?&rdquo; Tony huffed and turned to Stephen, who has been levitating in the common room for the past 10 minutes. The man ignored him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, pretty much,&rdquo; Rhodey said instead with a fond smile  &ldquo;but we don&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself.&rdquo; Pepper playfully shoved him in the shoulder at that, and the two of them giggled on the couch like a pair of teenage girls. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, can you hear me from down there, or do I need to get a megaphone? You copy? Good. I&rsquo;m not annoying, I&rsquo;m charismatic, Tinkerbell. There&rsquo;s a difference. You&rsquo;re just mad you can&rsquo;t grasp it yet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also a line between being a jackass and a comedian, and you&rsquo;ve crossed it since you arrived.&rdquo; Earth 2990 said with a be amused chuckle, typing something on his watch. At the frustrated sigh, the other man (the other him?) Let out, Tony guessed the job wasn&rsquo;t doing it for him. &ldquo;Me. We. You, whatever. I can&rsquo;t get this thing to work. You had any luck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tsk.&rdquo; Stark shook his head &ldquo; Thought it makes sense. Communication Networks must be different in every universe and their signal must be jacked because of the time and location difference. There could be a possibility that the phone numbers or communication links we&rsquo;re trying to access got&hellip;messed up in a way. </p><p>Like, maybe now that we&rsquo;re in this universe, we&rsquo;re a part of it and everything that tied us to our world can&rsquo;t be accessed anymore?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that seems right,&rdquo;  Earth 2990 nodded, and Tony decided that he&rsquo;ll have to find names for him too. &ldquo;but how do we find a way to communicate with the people in our world?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we can create a communication link of our own.&rdquo; Tony jumped in the conversation &ldquo; a common network if you will. Also, you&rsquo;re Stark,&rdquo; he annoiunced, pointitng at the taller alter, then at the orher one who shyly stayed back and played with his fingers. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re gonna be Anthony. I&rsquo;m copyrighting Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh, so I&rsquo;m not a complete idiot in this world, that&rsquo;s good to know,&rdquo; Stark muttered and started looking for something in the kitchen. &ldquo;Jesus, where&rsquo;s the alcohol in this place?&rdquo; He muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t gonna find any,&rdquo; Friday&rsquo;s voice rang in the room &ldquo;Boss quit last year.&rdquo; Something like pride hugged her robotic voice as she informed them. Tony probably shouldn&rsquo;t have taken that to heart too much, but he did.</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Stark&rsquo;s eyes were narrowed and his lips were in a thin line before answer &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not Jarvis. Where&rsquo;s Jarvis? &rdquo; </p><p>The room seemed to freeze as Tony&rsquo;s face became steely as he answered stiffly &ldquo; Gone.&rdquo; </p><p>It was a moment of silence for the three Starks in the room, a moment of understanding and shared pained over the same loyal butler they all lost before and once again in this life. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Well, I can&rsquo;t work till I don&rsquo;t drink at least 10 cups of whiskey, and Rhodey&rsquo;s not here on my ass so I don&rsquo;t know about you two, but I&rsquo;m having my drinking party in the lab. Friday, order some whiskey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How much, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; Uhh, &lsquo;till it&rsquo;s enough to fill a small pub, preferably.&rdquo; He then turned to Tony &ldquo;You know what you need? A meeting with your old friend, Mr. Whiskey and Mrs. Vodka. I&rsquo;m sure they miss you.&rdquo; </p><p>Despite Tony&rsquo;s mouth suddenly going dry, desperate for the hot liquid that once made a home in his belly to burn his neck again, he shook his head and licked his lips, crossing his arms over his chest &ldquo;I promised  some friends that I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Stark asked with an arched eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Friends? Buddies? Pals You don&rsquo;t have that in your world?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo; Not that I know of. &rdquo; Stark shrugged and turned to 2990 &ldquo;How about you? Wanna come with me? It&rsquo;ll be the night of your life.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;First of all, that sounded like a sex proposition, which, ew. You&rsquo;re technically me, and I may be a narcissist, but this takes the phrase of 'loving myself &rsquo; to a whole different level,&rdquo; 2990 cringed. &ldquo;and second of all, I&rsquo;ll pass. Promised my Rhodey I wouldn&rsquo;t drink.&rdquo; </p><p>Stark sighed and looked down &ldquo;Yeah. Me too.&rdquo; His fingers tapped on the bottom of the counter. Tony observed how his breathing quickened a bit and how his eyes wandered around aimlessly. It was subtle, but noticeable, because Tony could see his old self who freshly gave up drinking in him. </p><p>Anxious, stress filled, trying not to breakdown on the spot. It was easy to pinpoint what you&rsquo;ve lived. Tony opened his mouth, ready to reassure him, but Stark&rsquo;s finger snapping interrupted him. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, no drinking. Yet. What other unhealthy coping mechanism beside living in the bottle until we have to be a big boys and get over ourselves do we have, hm? Beating up an innocent boxing bag? Work 'till we drop dead? Throw a party? Prank call NASA?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony had to frown. &ldquo;Pranking NASA isn&rsquo;t an unhealthy coping mechanism.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s an unhealthy coping mechanism if you&rsquo;re fucked up enough. And yeah It is, if you do it long enough you forget how the sun looks,&rdquo; Stark nodded. &ldquo; let&rsquo;s just say I&rsquo;ve lived through some pretty dark times.&rdquo; </p><p>As deranged as he looked, Anthony chose not to tell Stark of how bad that sounded. Mostly because he knew the other him was aware. Instead, he suggested: &ldquo;Well, I mean, baking and knitting usually help me get over stress. They&rsquo;re really fun! Happy&rsquo;s mom actually took me to one of her yoga classes last week, so maybe&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;As awesome as my ass looks in yoga pants, I&rsquo;m not doing any of that,&rdquo; Stark interrupted crudly. He stole the coffee Tony was holding from his hand and walked towards the lab with a confident step, as though he owned the place. </p><p>&ldquo;&ndash; I&rsquo;m gonna inspect the lab to see at what level of shitty you are when it comes to handling it.
