And greetings to you Mr. Stark, Agent Carter. Sir has been informed of the most recent developments, and he has asked that you wait in the common room for his and Dr. Banner&rsquo;s arrival.&rdquo;</i> The two out-of-timers raised an eyebrow as Rogers casually responded as they stepped onto a fancy looking elevator.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks, J.A.R.V.I.S. Take us up, would you?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Of course, Captain Rogers.&rdquo;</i> The elevator ride was awkwardly silent, with Steve glancing over at his friends from the past every few seconds to Howard and Peggy openly staring at the two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Once the doors opened Clint wiggled his eyebrows and led them to the couches.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>As they settled onto the couches, the elevator dinged open once more, and the sound of Dr. Banner and Dr. Stark&rsquo;s banter brought smiles to their teammate&rsquo;s faces. Cap cleared his throat once the two were sitting.&nbsp;&ldquo;Guys, this is Peggy Carter and Howard Stark. Peggy, Howard, these are my teammates Clint Barton, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off and looked awkwardly between the two Starks.</p><p>Tony grimaced, standing and walking over to where Howard sat, holding out his hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Anthony, Anthony Edward Stark.&rdquo; At Howard and Peggy&rsquo;s shocked stares, he smirked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, father.&rdquo;&nbsp; Howard stuttered out a dazed &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit older than when I last saw you.&rdquo; Tony rolled his eyes&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, no kidding.&rdquo; He looked at Peggy and visibly relaxed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Aunt Peggy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peggy stood and walked up to him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Anthony, darling, you&rsquo;ve aged so well.&rdquo; His smile faded as she reached out and placed a hand over the arc reactor.</p><p>She frowned at feeling the arc&rsquo;s surface and reached her hands to unbutton his shirt, revealing the scarring and reactor to those in the room&nbsp;&ldquo;Anthony, what&hellip;?&rdquo; He reached up and gently grabbed her hands, dropping them as he backed away towards Bruce.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think that story is best left for another time. We still need to figure out how you got here. Can you tell us what happened?&rdquo; Peggy nodded and took her seat next to Howard once more, jarring him out of his own thoughts. He took a breath and looked over at his friend, wincing at the glare she gave him and began speaking.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I created a machine to travel through time.&rdquo; He looked towards Steve, &ldquo;Had it worked like it was supposed to, we would&rsquo;ve been able to travel through a portal to the day before Rogers took the plane down. But something happened, I don&rsquo;t know what, <i>yet</i>, and took us to this time period instead.&rdquo; Tony scoffed and Howard raised an eyebrow in his direction.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there a problem, Anthony?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shrugged and smirked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nah, I&rsquo;m just remembering Mom sitting me down and telling me you and Aunt Peggy were missing. That also explains why you-&rdquo; Steve interrupted him with a stern, &ldquo;<i>Tony.</i>..why don&rsquo;t you and Bruce go down to the lab and search through old SI files. Maybe there&rsquo;s something in there that can help us send them back.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The younger genius looked like he was going to protest. Before he could start though, the elevator doors opened, depositing one CEO of Stark Industries onto their floor, StarkPad in hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony, I need you at a board meeting in one hour, please don&rsquo;t forget. And Natasha, please make sure he doesn&rsquo;t escape the tower beforehand, I need to sway the board on the new budget-&rdquo; She looked up, freezing in place at the guests on her couch. A beat later, she turned to her fiance, fire in her eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What the hell did you do?!&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>If you&rsquo;d like to be tagged send me an ask, or comment below!</p><p>Tags: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFtyLrmNPqPN93HiCzUjQEw\">@fanfic-loverr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrhRKyNFRa4d3jbfIq8gZVw\">@kimmycup</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYgWTqGlYcEyt4YhGRcpdEQ\">@elisabpshady</a> </p>",
