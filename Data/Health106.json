                "content": "<p><p>I found that there are 2 ways people exersize , they either hit each muscle group once or twice per weak like chest and shoulders on Monday , arms and abbs on Tuesday , back and legs on Wednesday and so on, but I&rsquo;ve also found people who do full body workouts everyday where they do less reps for every set but keep it consistant , so now I&rsquo;m confused on wich is the best option, should I target each muscle group once ir twice every 1 weak? Or should I just do a consistant full body light workout everyday ? Also if you happen to know the pros and cons to both I&rsquo;d appreciate ir a lot.</p> <br /><br />\nSubmitted February 05, 2019 at 04:25AM by no14now<br />\nvia reddit <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2MQHLuT\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2MQHLuT</a></p>",
