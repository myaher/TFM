(Y/N) knows that sometimes when she gets a little insecure and can get a little overbearing with how clingy she gets to Harry. She doesn\u2019t mean to, really! She never felt comfortable with her parents growing up, so she never had the feeling of wanting, really <i>wanting</i> to be with somebody. So with the way things were with Harry, where she\u2019s never felt so comfortable with someone, she sometimes gets little overbearing. She\u2019s usually very good at hiding it; leaving it at longing little glances and holding his hand a little tighter when she needed him, and kissing him lightly on the cheek when they were in front of others. But today she figures she might have crossed a line she didn\u2019t know was there.\u00a0</p><p>While (Y/N)\u2019s summer was in full swing, Harry\u2019s just getting busier. Now all of these impulsive college kids and rebellious high school children had all the time in the world to spend money on things they don\u2019t really need nor want. Not only were his books full for the next few weeks to come, walk ins would come rushing in at any free moment he and any of the artists might have. Of course the business was good, and Harry was proud that his little passion project was still going so strong, but it gets stressful. When all of your creativity goes into creating art for others and nothing that really comes out of your own interest and vision, it gets hard to keep your head level. (Y/N) understands that and knows that sometimes Harry isn\u2019t ready to spill every thought he has as soon as he comes over, but today was also a tiny bit tough on her.\u00a0</p><p>She knows it\u2019s nothing compared to running her own business, but sometimes when she\u2019s alone for too long (Sarah and Mitch had decided to go on a little vacation of their own, before they all started getting more serious about recording these albums Harry\u2019s apparently written), things get hard. Her parents hadn\u2019t made any effort to speak to her in months, and as much anxiety as they incited in her, it still hurt knowing that she hadn\u2019t even been moved out a year before they decided to forget about her. Nothing even on the last day of school, congratulating her on her final and getting through the year. They didn\u2019t even send a text letting her know that they had gallivanted off on a three week vacation to Spain, as she had to find out through facebook. It just hurt.\u00a0</p><p>Through all of this, though, she knew she just wanted her Harry. He treats her so softly and carefully, and just everything she needed right then. So she waited all day for him to get off work and come to her apartment, and cuddle away every bad thought and doubt she had. And make out a little. Finally\u2013<i>finally</i>\u2013he had texted he was just about there. He seemed short in the text, but, then again, he was always very quick and to the point in his messages, so she thought nothing of it. When he knocked on the door and she opened the door to see him, she knew something was off. He didn\u2019t have any of his eyeliner on or his rings, his hair was pulled tightly back into a bun and the usual roundedness he gains when he\u2019s around her was absent.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t act too different, just being a tiny bit more quiet than usual and not following her around as he usually does, but he wasn\u2019t outright rude. She talked to him; asking about his day, telling him about her\u2019s and even telling him about this zoo trip she wanted to make because one of the Rhinos just had a baby. He gave quick answers, nodding his head and awing at the right spots. It honestly reminded her of when they had met for the very first time and he had nothing he wanted to say to her. But she knew Harry; she knew <i>her</i> Harry, and just because he\u2019s quiet didn\u2019t mean he was upset or suddenly hated her and didn\u2019t want to be with her anymore.\u00a0</p><p>So she asked him why he was so quiet. And he snapped. Harry never swears at her, so to hear him use the f-word with her, really hurt her feelings. Harry\u2019s given her a lot of confidence throughout their time getting closer together, and although she\u2019s not confrontational, she was able to express herself a little better. And she didn\u2019t like the way Harry had spoken to her.\u00a0</p><p>She took a little breath, and took up the small amount of courage she still had after his outburst and spoke up.\u00a0\u201cH-Harry, please don\u2019t swear at me like that, again. You know I had a rough day.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), so did I. Can y\u2019jus\u2019 stop please,\u201d Harry continued, his voice strained as he rubbed his tattooed fingers on his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>(Y/N) huffed, not liking the way he undermined the exact problems she just told him she was going through today.\u00a0\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry if I made you upset, but I just need you to be nicer to me today. I know I don\u2019t have my own business or anything like you do, but my problem still matter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>All she received was an exasperated sigh in response. Harry rolled his head to the back cushion, the heels of his palms pressing into his eyes. (Y/N) waited for him to say something back, anything really. She at least apologized, even when she didn\u2019t think she had to, and he can\u2019t say anything back?\u00a0</p><p>Harry removed his hands from his eyes, letting them flop on the couch cushions next to him. He sucked in a deep breath, his eyes still closed.\u00a0\u201cNot now, love, please. I don\u2019t need this right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she squeaked, angry tears filling her eyes. She didn\u2019t say anything else as she got off the couch. Harry didn\u2019t bother to look as she left the living room in her own apartment, and went to her room to get away from this before she got anymore hurt.\u00a0<br/></p><p>She knows its hard on him, how busy he is and how he\u2019s not able to creatively express himself, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can treat her like this. He knows its not anything like most fights couples get into, as there was barely any shouting and she left before it got too intense, but they never fight. She doesn\u2019t really count the time he had raised his voice at her all that time ago as a fight, and this was the closest he\u2019s ever been to being mean to her since they came clean about their feelings. And it hurt. Harry was her soft place, the one place she knew she would be cared for and it hurt that he didn\u2019t care about anything she had told him.\u00a0</p><p>She wanted to be alone.\u00a0</p><p>(Y/N) thinks she got about seven minutes, tops, of lying on her bed alone before Harry followed her in.\u00a0</p><p>It was a rare sight, seeing him so undone. He never shows how deeply he feels, aside from his affections for her. Everything\u2013stress, anger, anxiety, sadness\u2013was always wrapped up neatly in a little box, with no overflow or disorganization. But she could practically see the guilt, the frustration, and stress flowing off him like a river.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything as he crawled onto the bed next to her, flipping back the covers and wrapping an arm around her middle. He wiggled his face into the space between her shoulder and neck, planting little kisses on the skin not covered by her t-shirt. His fingers flexed against her side affectionately.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry,\u201d he breathed onto her skin.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah? For what?\u201d she pressed, not wanting to let him get away with this one. She wanted to hear the whole thing from him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry I wasn\u2019t talkin\u2019 to you,\u201d he started, pulling his head away from its burrowed home and propping himself up on an elbow to look at her,\u00a0\u201cAnd for swearin\u2019 at you and shoutin\u2019. I know y\u2019had a rough day, and m\u2019sorry I wasn\u2019t takin\u2019 y\u2019seriously.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tears settled on her waterline again, listening to him apologize. She look to him, her voice wavering as she spoke,\u00a0\u201cIts okay. I know you had a bad day, too. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t let you relax.\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head at her apology, moving to where he was laid atop her, with his forearms by her head to keep him up.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s jus\u2019 relax now, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry leaned down, spreading kisses all along her skin. She whispered an<i> I love you</i>\u00a0into the space between them. Harry settled himself between her legs and relaxing just as he said, placing his lips anywhere he could touch. (Y/N)\u2019s arms wrapped around his neck, keeping him down within kissing distance of her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, s\u2019much,\u201d his voice rasped against the skin of her jaw, the tip of his tongue lining along the bone for a second,\u00a0\u201cCan I show y\u2019how much?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He pulled back, letting her see his hooded eyes, feeling his grabbing hands, remembering his sponged kisses.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>___________</p><p><i>fijdis this one is not good im SO SORRY JSJDOS anyway!!!! <a href=\"https://adashofniallandasprinkleoflunacy.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">andrea</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://moonchildstyles.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">i</a> are doing a<a href=\"https://adashofniallandasprinkleoflunacy.tumblr.com/post/184980076852/were-doing-a-concept-night-send-in-whatever\" target=\"_blank\"> concept night</a>!!</i></p>",

(Y/N) knows that sometimes when she gets a little insecure and can get a little overbearing with how clingy she gets to Harry. She doesn\u2019t mean to, really! She never felt comfortable with her parents growing up, so she never had the feeling of wanting, really <i>wanting</i> to be with somebody. So with the way things were with Harry, where she\u2019s never felt so comfortable with someone, she sometimes gets little overbearing. She\u2019s usually very good at hiding it; leaving it at longing little glances and holding his hand a little tighter when she needed him, and kissing him lightly on the cheek when they were in front of others. But today she figures she might have crossed a line she didn\u2019t know was there.\u00a0</p><p>While (Y/N)\u2019s summer was in full swing, Harry\u2019s just getting busier. Now all of these impulsive college kids and rebellious high school children had all the time in the world to spend money on things they don\u2019t really need nor want. Not only were his books full for the next few weeks to come, walk ins would come rushing in at any free moment he and any of the artists might have. Of course the business was good, and Harry was proud that his little passion project was still going so strong, but it gets stressful. When all of your creativity goes into creating art for others and nothing that really comes out of your own interest and vision, it gets hard to keep your head level. (Y/N) understands that and knows that sometimes Harry isn\u2019t ready to spill every thought he has as soon as he comes over, but today was also a tiny bit tough on her.\u00a0</p><p>She knows it\u2019s nothing compared to running her own business, but sometimes when she\u2019s alone for too long (Sarah and Mitch had decided to go on a little vacation of their own, before they all started getting more serious about recording these albums Harry\u2019s apparently written), things get hard. Her parents hadn\u2019t made any effort to speak to her in months, and as much anxiety as they incited in her, it still hurt knowing that she hadn\u2019t even been moved out a year before they decided to forget about her. Nothing even on the last day of school, congratulating her on her final and getting through the year. They didn\u2019t even send a text letting her know that they had gallivanted off on a three week vacation to Spain, as she had to find out through facebook. It just hurt.\u00a0</p><p>Through all of this, though, she knew she just wanted her Harry. He treats her so softly and carefully, and just everything she needed right then. So she waited all day for him to get off work and come to her apartment, and cuddle away every bad thought and doubt she had. And make out a little. Finally\u2013<i>finally</i>\u2013he had texted he was just about there.

I know I don\u2019t have my own business or anything like you do, but my problem still matter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>All she received was an exasperated sigh in response. Harry rolled his head to the back cushion, the heels of his palms pressing into his eyes. (Y/N) waited for him to say something back, anything really. She at least apologized, even when she didn\u2019t think she had to, and he can\u2019t say anything back?\u00a0</p><p>Harry removed his hands from his eyes, letting them flop on the couch cushions next to him. He sucked in a deep breath, his eyes still closed.\u00a0\u201cNot now, love, please. I don\u2019t need this right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she squeaked, angry tears filling her eyes. She didn\u2019t say anything else as she got off the couch. Harry didn\u2019t bother to look as she left the living room in her own apartment, and went to her room to get away from this before she got anymore hurt.\u00a0<br></p><p>She knows its hard on him, how busy he is and how he\u2019s not able to creatively express himself, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can treat her like this. He knows its not anything like most fights couples get into, as there was barely any shouting and she left before it got too intense, but they never fight. She doesn\u2019t really count the time he had raised his voice at her all that time ago as a fight, and this was the closest he\u2019s ever been to being mean to her since they came clean about their feelings. And it hurt. Harry was her soft place, the one place she knew she would be cared for and it hurt that he didn\u2019t care about anything she had told him.\u00a0</p><p>She wanted to be alone.\u00a0</p><p>(Y/N) thinks she got about seven minutes, tops, of lying on her bed alone before Harry followed her in.\u00a0</p><p>It was a rare sight, seeing him so undone. He never shows how deeply he feels, aside from his affections for her. Everything\u2013stress, anger, anxiety, sadness\u2013was always wrapped up neatly in a little box, with no overflow or disorganization. But she could practically see the guilt, the frustration, and stress flowing off him like a river.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything as he crawled onto the bed next to her, flipping back the covers and wrapping an arm around her middle. He wiggled his face into the space between her shoulder and neck, planting little kisses on the skin not covered by her t-shirt. His fingers flexed against her side affectionately.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry,\u201d he breathed onto her skin.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah? For what?\u201d she pressed, not wanting to let him get away with this one. She wanted to hear the whole thing from him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry I wasn\u2019t talkin\u2019 to you,\u201d he started, pulling his head away from its burrowed home and propping himself up on an elbow to look at her,\u00a0\u201cAnd for swearin\u2019 at you and shoutin\u2019. I know y\u2019had a rough day, and m\u2019sorry I wasn\u2019t takin\u2019 y\u2019seriously.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Tears settled on her waterline again, listening to him apologize. She look to him, her voice wavering as she spoke,\u00a0\u201cIts okay. I know you had a bad day, too. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t let you relax.\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head at her apology, moving to where he was laid atop her, with his forearms by her head to keep him up.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s jus\u2019 relax now, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry leaned down, spreading kisses all along her skin. She whispered an<i> I love you</i>\u00a0into the space between them. Harry settled himself between her legs and relaxing just as he said, placing his lips anywhere he could touch. (Y/N)\u2019s arms wrapped around his neck, keeping him down within kissing distance of her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, s\u2019much,\u201d his voice rasped against the skin of her jaw, the tip of his tongue lining along the bone for a second,\u00a0\u201cCan I show y\u2019how much?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He pulled back, letting her see his hooded eyes, feeling his grabbing hands, remembering his sponged kisses.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>___________</p><p><i>fijdis this one is not good im SO SORRY JSJDOS anyway!!!! <a href=\"https://adashofniallandasprinkleoflunacy.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">andrea</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://moonchildstyles.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">i</a> are doing a<a href=\"https://adashofniallandasprinkleoflunacy.tumblr.com/post/184980076852/were-doing-a-concept-night-send-in-whatever\" target=\"_blank\"> concept night</a>!!</i></p>",
                "content": "<p><i>the first aster blurb!!!</i></p><p><i>________</i></p><p>&ldquo;Harry, why aren&rsquo;t you talking to me?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t fucking want to talk right now, (Y/N)!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Oh.</p><p>Now she wasn&rsquo;t expecting that. (Y/N) knows that sometimes when she gets a little insecure and can get a little overbearing with how clingy she gets to Harry. She doesn&rsquo;t mean to, really! She never felt comfortable with her parents growing up, so she never had the feeling of wanting, really <i>wanting</i> to be with somebody. So with the way things were with Harry, where she&rsquo;s never felt so comfortable with someone, she sometimes gets little overbearing. She&rsquo;s usually very good at hiding it; leaving it at longing little glances and holding his hand a little tighter when she needed him, and kissing him lightly on the cheek when they were in front of others. But today she figures she might have crossed a line she didn&rsquo;t know was there.&nbsp;</p><p>While (Y/N)&rsquo;s summer was in full swing, Harry&rsquo;s just getting busier. Now all of these impulsive college kids and rebellious high school children had all the time in the world to spend money on things they don&rsquo;t really need nor want. Not only were his books full for the next few weeks to come, walk ins would come rushing in at any free moment he and any of the artists might have. Of course the business was good, and Harry was proud that his little passion project was still going so strong, but it gets stressful. When all of your creativity goes into creating art for others and nothing that really comes out of your own interest and vision, it gets hard to keep your head level. (Y/N) understands that and knows that sometimes Harry isn&rsquo;t ready to spill every thought he has as soon as he comes over, but today was also a tiny bit tough on her.&nbsp;</p><p>She knows it&rsquo;s nothing compared to running her own business, but sometimes when she&rsquo;s alone for too long (Sarah and Mitch had decided to go on a little vacation of their own, before they all started getting more serious about recording these albums Harry&rsquo;s apparently written), things get hard. Her parents hadn&rsquo;t made any effort to speak to her in months, and as much anxiety as they incited in her, it still hurt knowing that she hadn&rsquo;t even been moved out a year before they decided to forget about her. Nothing even on the last day of school, congratulating her on her final and getting through the year. They didn&rsquo;t even send a text letting her know that they had gallivanted off on a three week vacation to Spain, as she had to find out through facebook. It just hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>Through all of this, though, she knew she just wanted her Harry. He treats her so softly and carefully, and just everything she needed right then. So she waited all day for him to get off work and come to her apartment, and cuddle away every bad thought and doubt she had. And make out a little. Finally&ndash;<i>finally</i>&ndash;he had texted he was just about there. He seemed short in the text, but, then again, he was always very quick and to the point in his messages, so she thought nothing of it. When he knocked on the door and she opened the door to see him, she knew something was off. He didn&rsquo;t have any of his eyeliner on or his rings, his hair was pulled tightly back into a bun and the usual roundedness he gains when he&rsquo;s around her was absent.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t act too different, just being a tiny bit more quiet than usual and not following her around as he usually does, but he wasn&rsquo;t outright rude. She talked to him; asking about his day, telling him about her&rsquo;s and even telling him about this zoo trip she wanted to make because one of the Rhinos just had a baby. He gave quick answers, nodding his head and awing at the right spots. It honestly reminded her of when they had met for the very first time and he had nothing he wanted to say to her. But she knew Harry; she knew <i>her</i> Harry, and just because he&rsquo;s quiet didn&rsquo;t mean he was upset or suddenly hated her and didn&rsquo;t want to be with her anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>So she asked him why he was so quiet. And he snapped. Harry never swears at her, so to hear him use the f-word with her, really hurt her feelings. Harry&rsquo;s given her a lot of confidence throughout their time getting closer together, and although she&rsquo;s not confrontational, she was able to express herself a little better. And she didn&rsquo;t like the way Harry had spoken to her.&nbsp;</p><p>She took a little breath, and took up the small amount of courage she still had after his outburst and spoke up.&nbsp;&ldquo;H-Harry, please don&rsquo;t swear at me like that, again. You know I had a rough day.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N), so did I. Can y&rsquo;jus&rsquo; stop please,&rdquo; Harry continued, his voice strained as he rubbed his tattooed fingers on his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>(Y/N) huffed, not liking the way he undermined the exact problems she just told him she was going through today.&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry if I made you upset, but I just need you to be nicer to me today. I know I don&rsquo;t have my own business or anything like you do, but my problem still matter.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>All she received was an exasperated sigh in response.
