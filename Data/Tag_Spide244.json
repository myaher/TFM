The first person to\nnotice our bracelets was Ned, of course. That boy has eagle eyes.</p><p>We were in\nmath class when he switched his gaze between me and Peter, who were\nconcentrating on the demon&rsquo;s exercise the teacher had been through.

It was inevitable not to feel a shiver running through my spine.</p><p>On Tuesday, we were using the cell phone plugs. MJ\nnoticed at lunch. We were talking about the last episode of Lucifer when Peter\ntook his cell phone to read some news about the show, and I got my cell phone\nto read too, that&rsquo;s when she decided to ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you are not dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are sure.\u201d I said, eating the candy that Peter\ngave into my mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you using double\naccessories?&rdquo; Half the little table looked in our direction, waiting for\nthe answer, including Flash, who had arrived a few minutes ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; yeah &hellip;&rdquo; I curled up a bit because\nI knew I&rsquo;d leave MJ with a flea behind her ear.</p><p>&ldquo;It was on sale; take two for the price of one. So\nY/N bought it and gave me one.\u201d Peter said,without taking his eyes from his phone.</p><p>On Wednesday, someone announced that he would hold a\nparty on Saturday to commemorate the victory of the basketball team and I knew\nthat Flash would try to call me again to go, so Peter decided we would make our\nfriends discover in that day.\u00a0</p><p>Instead of running off to buy our cookie, he\nwhispered in my ear that he would wait behind the bleachers on the court, so we\ncould spend some time alone. I knew that Ned had heard because he kept watching\nus. I tried to disguise it and nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cHm? Oh &hellip; I have to go to the teachers&rsquo; room &hellip; You\nknow I&rsquo;m bad at chemistry, I&rsquo;m going to look for the teacher to see if she can\nhelp me, maybe tell me a tutor or something.\u201d</p><p>&quot;Oh, of course. It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll wait for you\nat the table.\u201d I nodded, leaving the room. Ned waited for me to leave the room\nto follow me; when I got on the court, I almost jumped when Peter pulled me by\nthe wrist and pressed me to the wall, making our bodies stick together. I could\nsmell the delicious chocolate that came from him.</p><p>\u201cNed sucks at following people.\u201d He whispered close to\nmy lips. &quot;I see him standing there near the locker room, he&rsquo;s looking here\n&hellip; Hm &hellip; I really can &hellip; You know &hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kiss me?&rdquo; I asked quietly, and he nodded.\nFuck, what a strange situation. Having him so close to me that way and knowing\nwhat would happen next, I felt my heart race. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want, we can only act &hellip; There is an angle\nthat looks &hellip; &ldquo; He stopped talking as soon as I kissed him.</p><p>When I heard people talking about how they felt in the\nclouds kissing someone they liked, I thought it was a litany of romantic\npeople, but at that moment, as I closed my eyes to experience the kiss, I felt\na strange numbness in my legs, as if I was really floating.\u00a0</p><p>If I didn\u2019t feel\nanything for him, why did I feel that way about our kiss?</p><p>I stared at his face as I opened my eyes. He kept his\nmouth open, letting out his breath with a little difficulty. His face was so\nhandsome that I wanted to kiss him completely, and so I did. At that moment, I\neven forgot that Ned was there and that he was the reason for it all. Peter\nlaughed as he felt my lips trailing down his neck in a calm, non-malicious way.\u00a0</p><p>It was when I realized the situation and I was bewildered for a few seconds,\nnot knowing what to do, because it seemed that the control I had had escaped my\nfingers.</p><p>\u201cI think we&rsquo;re great actors.\u201d Peter whispered still\nwith his eyes closed. We stayed a little like that as I tried to calm my heart.</p><p>As I said, I had kissed only one person in my life,\nand it wasn\u2019t a very good experience, and for that reason, I kept in my head\nthat all kisses would be disgusting like that, but no. His lips tasted of mint,\nsince he was addicted to those gums, and my God, thank you, sir, for not being\na frilly kiss.</p><p>\u201cWe should win an Oscar.\u201d I said with a low laugh,\neven though I felt my heart might come out of my mouth at any moment.</p><p>It&rsquo;s normal for a kiss to cause this in people, right?</p><p>\u201cPete &hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it normal for people&rsquo;s hearts to beat quickly\nafter a kiss?\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything at that moment, just took my hand and\ncarried it to his chest, making me feel his heart, which looked like a little\nanimal caged in the chest.</p><p>&quot;Considering mine is too, I think so.Let&rsquo;s go to the cafeteria, I&rsquo;m sure Ned&rsquo;s going\nto rub it in our face, I saw he recording. He is a traitor indeed.\u201d He took my hand and pulled me away.\u00a0</p><p>We continued hand in\nhand as we walked the corridors, the students weren\u2019t surprised, since we used to do that everyday. It wasn\u2019t long before we arrived at the table, Ned was sitting\nthere talking to MJ.\u00a0</p><p>We sat there and Peter opened his backpack and took\nout some chips from there, we began to eat while he took his cell phone from his\npocket and stretched an earphone in my direction. As always, he laid his head on my\nshoulder and I brought my finger to his lips, wiping them, since they were\ndirty, making him smile with the act.</p><p>&quot;Are you sure you&rsquo;re not dating yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have, yes, why?&rdquo; I asked, without much\neffort.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;And best friends kiss each other in the\nmouth?&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cWhat you mean?\u201d Peter asked, pausing the song while Ned reached for his cell phone in his pocket as planned.</p><p>I wanted to smile because our plan was working, our\nfriends were really believing. He approached it to our faces, where we could see each other perfectly, so he pressed play and\neveryone&rsquo;s eyes widened, including Flash&rsquo;s who was sitting in front of us.\nEveryone looked surprised by the scene.</p><p>&quot;Where did you get that? Wait! Did you follow us?\u201d</p><p>&quot;Sorry, I was just curious. You can see the way\nyou look at each other, I thought you were being stupid for not seeing it. But\napparently, you have seen, and you have seen it very well.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I felt my cheeks warm.</p><p>&quot;Okay, you were right, we are dating. We have not\ntalked before because no one here has anything to do with it.\u201d Peter said</p><p>&quot;Oh, so it was true,&rdquo; Flash whispered.\n&ldquo;They told me you were together, but I did not believe it &hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry\nfor being pushy, I thought Y/N was single.\u201d</p><p>&quot;Oh, it&rsquo;s okay, Flash.\u201d Parker smiled. &quot;You\nhad no way of knowing, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I&rsquo;ll be going. Congratulations to you.\u201d He said\nand left. Everyone began to get up and leave the table when the signal hit.</p><p>I should be glad that I was\u00a0\u201cfree\u201d from Flash, right? But I\nfelt bad for fooling everyone.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look sad?\u201d Peter asked after everyone\nleft.</p><p>&quot;I feel bad for fooling everyone. I&rsquo;m a lousy\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>&quot;Sometimes, love, lying is better than telling\nthe truth. You wanted a way to get him out of your foot without hurting him,\ndidn\u2019t you?\u201d I nodded. \u201cThen, he&rsquo;s going to be a little sad, but if you had said in all letters that you didn\u2019t want to go out with him, he\nwould be much more hurt, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe &hellip; I guess I should have been honest with him\nfrom the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, like, sorry for doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I think I am.\u201d</p><p>&quot;Even &hellip; for kissing me?&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cWhat?

The first person to\nnotice our bracelets was Ned, of course. That boy has eagle eyes.</p><p>We were in\nmath class when he switched his gaze between me and Peter, who were\nconcentrating on the demon\u2019s exercise the teacher had been through. He nudged MJ\nand whispered something in her ear, and even without hearing, I knew it was\nabout us.</p><p>He stood quietly, glancing at us both, his curiosity\nseemed to increase even more when Parker came too close, whispering something\nin my ear about class. Since he knew Ned was looking, just like MJ, he slid his\nnose lightly on my cheek before moving away, and shit, I wasn\u2019t expecting it. It was inevitable not to feel a shiver running through my spine.</p><p>On Tuesday, we were using the cell phone plugs. MJ\nnoticed at lunch. We were talking about the last episode of Lucifer when Peter\ntook his cell phone to read some news about the show, and I got my cell phone\nto read too, that\u2019s when she decided to ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you are not dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are sure.\u201d I said, eating the candy that Peter\ngave into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you using double\naccessories?\u201d Half the little table looked in our direction, waiting for\nthe answer, including Flash, who had arrived a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cOh \u2026 yeah \u2026\u201d I curled up a bit because\nI knew I\u2019d leave MJ with a flea behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cIt was on sale; take two for the price of one. So\nY/N bought it and gave me one.\u201d Peter said,without taking his eyes from his phone.</p><p>On Wednesday, someone announced that he would hold a\nparty on Saturday to commemorate the victory of the basketball team and I knew\nthat Flash would try to call me again to go, so Peter decided we would make our\nfriends discover in that day.\u00a0</p><p>Instead of running off to buy our cookie, he\nwhispered in my ear that he would wait behind the bleachers on the court, so we\ncould spend some time alone. I knew that Ned had heard because he kept watching\nus. I tried to disguise it and nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cHm? Oh \u2026 I have to go to the teachers\u2019 room \u2026 You\nknow I\u2019m bad at chemistry, I\u2019m going to look for the teacher to see if she can\nhelp me, maybe tell me a tutor or something.\u201d</p><p>\"Oh, of course. It\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll wait for you\nat the table.\u201d I nodded, leaving the room. Ned waited for me to leave the room\nto follow me; when I got on the court, I almost jumped when Peter pulled me by\nthe wrist and pressed me to the wall, making our bodies stick together. I could\nsmell the delicious chocolate that came from him.</p><p>\u201cNed sucks at following people.\u201d He whispered close to\nmy lips. \"I see him standing there near the locker room, he\u2019s looking here\n\u2026 Hm \u2026 I really can \u2026 You know \u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me?\u201d I asked quietly, and he nodded.\nFuck, what a strange situation. Having him so close to me that way and knowing\nwhat would happen next, I felt my heart race. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want, we can only act \u2026 There is an angle\nthat looks \u2026 \u201c He stopped talking as soon as I kissed him.</p><p>When I heard people talking about how they felt in the\nclouds kissing someone they liked, I thought it was a litany of romantic\npeople, but at that moment, as I closed my eyes to experience the kiss, I felt\na strange numbness in my legs, as if I was really floating.\u00a0</p><p>If I didn\u2019t feel\nanything for him, why did I feel that way about our kiss?</p><p>I stared at his face as I opened my eyes. He kept his\nmouth open, letting out his breath with a little difficulty. His face was so\nhandsome that I wanted to kiss him completely, and so I did. At that moment, I\neven forgot that Ned was there and that he was the reason for it all. Peter\nlaughed as he felt my lips trailing down his neck in a calm, non-malicious way.\u00a0</p><p>It was when I realized the situation and I was bewildered for a few seconds,\nnot knowing what to do, because it seemed that the control I had had escaped my\nfingers.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re great actors.\u201d Peter whispered still\nwith his eyes closed. We stayed a little like that as I tried to calm my heart.</p><p>As I said, I had kissed only one person in my life,\nand it wasn\u2019t a very good experience, and for that reason, I kept in my head\nthat all kisses would be disgusting like that, but no. His lips tasted of mint,\nsince he was addicted to those gums, and my God, thank you, sir, for not being\na frilly kiss.</p><p>\u201cWe should win an Oscar.\u201d I said with a low laugh,\neven though I felt my heart might come out of my mouth at any moment.</p><p>It\u2019s normal for a kiss to cause this in people, right?</p><p>\u201cPete \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it normal for people\u2019s hearts to beat quickly\nafter a kiss?\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything at that moment, just took my hand and\ncarried it to his chest, making me feel his heart, which looked like a little\nanimal caged in the chest.</p><p>\"Considering mine is too, I think so.Let\u2019s go to the cafeteria, I\u2019m sure Ned\u2019s going\nto rub it in our face, I saw he recording. He is a traitor indeed.\u201d He took my hand and pulled me away.\u00a0</p><p>We continued hand in\nhand as we walked the corridors, the students weren\u2019t surprised, since we used to do that everyday. It wasn\u2019t long before we arrived at the table, Ned was sitting\nthere talking to MJ.\u00a0</p><p>We sat there and Peter opened his backpack and took\nout some chips from there, we began to eat while he took his cell phone from his\npocket and stretched an earphone in my direction. As always, he laid his head on my\nshoulder and I brought my finger to his lips, wiping them, since they were\ndirty, making him smile with the act.</p><p>\"Are you sure you\u2019re not dating yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have, yes, why?\u201d I asked, without much\neffort.</p><p>\u00a0\"And best friends kiss each other in the\nmouth?\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat you mean?\u201d Peter asked, pausing the song while Ned reached for his cell phone in his pocket as planned.</p><p>I wanted to smile because our plan was working, our\nfriends were really believing. He approached it to our faces, where we could see each other perfectly, so he pressed play and\neveryone\u2019s eyes widened, including Flash\u2019s who was sitting in front of us.\nEveryone looked surprised by the scene.</p><p>\"Where did you get that? Wait! Did you follow us?\u201d</p><p>\"Sorry, I was just curious. You can see the way\nyou look at each other, I thought you were being stupid for not seeing it. But\napparently, you have seen, and you have seen it very well.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I felt my cheeks warm.</p><p>\"Okay, you were right, we are dating. We have not\ntalked before because no one here has anything to do with it.\u201d Peter said</p><p>\"Oh, so it was true,\u201d Flash whispered.\n\u201cThey told me you were together, but I did not believe it \u2026 I\u2019m sorry\nfor being pushy, I thought Y/N was single.\u201d</p><p>\"Oh, it\u2019s okay, Flash.\u201d Parker smiled. \"You\nhad no way of knowing, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be going. Congratulations to you.\u201d He said\nand left. Everyone began to get up and leave the table when the signal hit.</p><p>I should be glad that I was\u00a0\u201cfree\u201d from Flash, right? But I\nfelt bad for fooling everyone.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look sad?\u201d Peter asked after everyone\nleft.</p><p>\"I feel bad for fooling everyone. I\u2019m a lousy\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>\"Sometimes, love, lying is better than telling\nthe truth. You wanted a way to get him out of your foot without hurting him,\ndidn\u2019t you?\u201d I nodded. \u201cThen, he\u2019s going to be a little sad, but if you had said in all letters that you didn\u2019t want to go out with him, he\nwould be much more hurt, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe \u2026 I guess I should have been honest with him\nfrom the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, like, sorry for doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I think I am.\u201d</p><p>\"Even \u2026 for kissing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Kissing was good, I just \u2026 \u201cI widened my\neyes when I realized what I was saying, hearing a giggle come from his handsome\nlips. He leaned in a little and left a kiss on my lips before he got up.</p><p>\"Come on, class will start, and I don\u2019t want to\nget on my knees in the hallway for being late again.\u201d I took his hand, and\nstill feeling a warm warmth on my lips, we went to attend physics class.</p><p>But I still had one doubt that didn\u2019t want to leave my mind.</p><p>If it was a lie, why was my heart pounding for real?</p><hr><p><b>Taglist:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC6OpDEQesVvB38EXqzivbg\">@tokoyamisstuff</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDJQd2na_MMP1CNIZ14z8MQ\">@imrllybored</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUkEFgAFhXeXKJJSUj_9itg\">@xxxxdelenaxxxx</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFgZnY-g4nbWkau96Tu2euQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFgZnY-g4nbWkau96Tu2euQ\">@saturnspiderman</a></p><p><i><b>send me an ask or message if you want to be on my taglist and which character you want (Bucky, Peter, Avengers, all of them\u2026)</b></i></p><p><i><b>leave a comment on this post if you\u2019d like to be tagged ONLY in this fic series</b></i></p><p><b>A/N: hmmm lies, lies</b></p>",
