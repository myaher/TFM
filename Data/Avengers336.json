I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to live with myself if i hurt you or anyone else,\u201d He finished, as he walked over to the one chair at the dining table, leaning against it for support.

Now please\u2026 please just leave me alone,\u201d He practically begged her, but Natasha didn\u2019t move one inch.</p><p>\u201cNatasha\u2026\u201d He said warningly, his voice deep and husky as he gripped the chair tightly.</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving unless-\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cI SAID GO!\u201d </b>He bellowed, and Natasha practically jumped out of her skin from the sudden voice change.</p><p>Bruce chest moved harshly up and down at his quickened breathing, but he showed no signs of changing. not yet, at least. </p><p>Natasha watched Bruce\u2019s movement carefully, watching for his next move. He could be so predictable but yet unpredictable at the same time. SHe knew the amount of stress he was undergoing right now, but she wouldn\u2019t- couldn\u2019t leave him alone out here. He finally had a home, had someone who loved him, friends who adored him, but yet he didn\u2019t want any of it. What would she have to do to convince him?</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d She said slowly and softly, Bruce knew how stubborn she was. She wasn&rsquo;t going to give up after a little scare.</p><p>\u201cYou have friends who love you, a home, me-\u201c she stopped, her voice catching in her throat, god she felt so stupid being so vulnerable. It wasn\u2019t normal for her to be like this, and Bruce saw that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want any of that?\u201d Bruce scoffed, snapping his head up to look at the assassin.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do! But I cant put you all in any more danger, can&rsquo;t you just understand that- please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hearing yourself right?\u201d</p><p>Bruce frowned slightly, why couldn\u2019t she just understand?!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a god, a super soldier, two assassins and well- the Tony Stark. Do you honestly think anyone can hurt us?\u201d</p><p>Well, she had a point. Bruce was acting as though his friends were nothing. As if they couldn\u2019t handle someone like Ross? They were the Avengers for christ sake! But Ross wasnt just the problem, he was! He was the real monster. The monster that nobody could ever get rid of or kill.</p><p>Bruce was silent for a beat, unable to say anything other than \u2018Im so sorry, i shouldnt have left you. I promise you i wont ever do it again,\u2019. But the thing was he didnt know if he could say that. Could he live a life with Natasha? Does he deserve a life like that?</p><p>\u201cPlease, just say something-\u201d Nat quitely spoke up, her fragie shaky voice breaking through. God, did she hate herself at the moment for being so weak and vulnerable.</p><p>But Bruce didn&rsquo;t respond. Only keeping his dark glassy eyes on the chair his hands were tightly grasping. He couldn&rsquo;t respond, he didn&rsquo;t know how to respond.</p><p>And so with that Natasha scoffed, shaking her head upon him, tears beginning to fall down her soft cheeks.</p><p>\u201cA coward, that&rsquo;s all you are. And here i was thinking you were different from all the rest.\u201d Natasha snarled, venom dripping from each word as she looked at Bruce carefully.</p><p>With that, Natasha left. She left behind the man she fell so deeply in love with from the day she met him. The man she felt as though she could truly be herself with. The man she had hoped would disappear and run away with. This was the man who she thought she would spend the rest of her life with.</p><p>\u201cIs he coming?\u201d Steve asked carefully, as she saw Natasha storm out of the run down house. He could feel the tension practically radiating from her and knew it didn&rsquo;t end well.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>And so they left, hearing nothing but the distance roars of the man she will forever yearn for.</p>",

Now please\u2026 please just leave me alone,\u201d He practically begged her, but Natasha didn\u2019t move one inch.</p><p>\u201cNatasha\u2026\u201d He said warningly, his voice deep and husky as he gripped the chair tightly.</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving unless-\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cI SAID GO!\u201d </b>He bellowed, and Natasha practically jumped out of her skin from the sudden voice change.</p><p>Bruce chest moved harshly up and down at his quickened breathing, but he showed no signs of changing. not yet, at least. </p><p>Natasha watched Bruce\u2019s movement carefully, watching for his next move. He could be so predictable but yet unpredictable at the same time. SHe knew the amount of stress he was undergoing right now, but she wouldn\u2019t- couldn\u2019t leave him alone out here. He finally had a home, had someone who loved him, friends who adored him, but yet he didn\u2019t want any of it. What would she have to do to convince him?</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d She said slowly and softly, Bruce knew how stubborn she was. She wasn\u2019t going to give up after a little scare.</p><p>\u201cYou have friends who love you, a home, me-\u201c she stopped, her voice catching in her throat, god she felt so stupid being so vulnerable. It wasn\u2019t normal for her to be like this, and Bruce saw that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want any of that?\u201d Bruce scoffed, snapping his head up to look at the assassin.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do! But I cant put you all in any more danger, can\u2019t you just understand that- please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hearing yourself right?\u201d</p><p>Bruce frowned slightly, why couldn\u2019t she just understand?!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a god, a super soldier, two assassins and well- the Tony Stark. Do you honestly think anyone can hurt us?\u201d</p><p>Well, she had a point. Bruce was acting as though his friends were nothing. As if they couldn\u2019t handle someone like Ross? They were the Avengers for christ sake! But Ross wasnt just the problem, he was! He was the real monster. The monster that nobody could ever get rid of or kill.</p><p>Bruce was silent for a beat, unable to say anything other than \u2018Im so sorry, i shouldnt have left you. I promise you i wont ever do it again,\u2019. But the thing was he didnt know if he could say that. Could he live a life with Natasha? Does he deserve a life like that?</p><p>\u201cPlease, just say something-\u201d Nat quitely spoke up, her fragie shaky voice breaking through. God, did she hate herself at the moment for being so weak and vulnerable.</p><p>But Bruce didn\u2019t respond. Only keeping his dark glassy eyes on the chair his hands were tightly grasping. He couldn\u2019t respond, he didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><p>And so with that Natasha scoffed, shaking her head upon him, tears beginning to fall down her soft cheeks.</p><p>\u201cA coward, that\u2019s all you are. And here i was thinking you were different from all the rest.\u201d Natasha snarled, venom dripping from each word as she looked at Bruce carefully.</p><p>With that, Natasha left. She left behind the man she fell so deeply in love with from the day she met him. The man she felt as though she could truly be herself with. The man she had hoped would disappear and run away with. This was the man who she thought she would spend the rest of her life with.</p><p>\u201cIs he coming?\u201d Steve asked carefully, as she saw Natasha storm out of the run down house. He could feel the tension practically radiating from her and knew it didn\u2019t end well.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>And so they left, hearing nothing but the distance roars of the man she will forever yearn for.</p>",

That was what you thought as you got up in the morning and sat at the breakfast table in your parent\u2019s home eating your cereal. Your school day wouldn\u2019t be particularly long, for the first time in ages you wouldn\u2019t have to write an exam or hold a presentation and most important of all it was Friday and that meant you would go to the tower after school and spend the entirety of your weekend with the avengers.</p><p>So, when you got out of the bus smiling and walked up the front stairs of your school you completely missed the nasty glances or the whispers that followed you inside.</p><p>You had just turned around the corner to the floor your locker was on when your best friend rushed towards you and stopped you in your tracks by putting his hands on your shoulders. He tried to turn you around and pull you along with him but you wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what\u2019s going on?\u201d You frowned.</p><p>\u201cPlease Y/N, you don\u2019t want to go there, just let us leave or something. In fact why don\u2019t we skip school? We\u2019re graduating in a week and have all the important stuff done, let\u2019s just go grab some cake and a coffee\u2026\u201d </p><p>You frowned at Peter\u2019s agitated state, sure, he was always jumpy but now there was a look of panic in his eyes and you would have lied if you said it didn\u2019t make you uneasy.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you gave in, \u201cJust let me get some things\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter vehemently shook his head, but before he could elaborate Flash passed you by smirking.</p><p>\u201cNice decoration on your locker, L/N,\u201d he called towards you and a few guys around started to snicker.</p><p>That was it, despite of his powers you were able to yank your arm free from Peter\u2019s grasp and pushed past the people around you. You wished you hadn\u2019t done it, in the moment you saw the door of your locker you really really wished you had just gone for the cake.</p><p>You swallowed as you took a step closer in a dazed state. Tears pooled in your eyes as you looked over the things attached to your locker. There was a picture of you from the pride parade last weekend, you would have actually liked the photo a lot since it showed you being quite happy, a bi pride flag hung around your shoulders and your friends from the community were by your side, but someone had scribbled over it with a red sharpie in messy handwriting, now SLUT was written over your face and that wasn\u2019t everything\u2026 Aside from the picture other insults had been sprayed over the door with graffiti spray. \u201cFag\u201d, \u201cDrag your disgusting ass out of our school\u201d and \u201cAbomination\u201d were among the nicer things your classmates had come up with.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know how long you had stood there, gaping at the sight in front of you. You had held this secret for so long, had avoided any bullying and now mere weeks before leaving your personal hell crushed down over you. </p><p>Someone gently putting his hand on your shoulder and tugging slightly brought you back into reality, the sound of laughing and voices calling names at you filled your ears, but there also was something soft, something kind.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Peter spoke against your ear.</p><p>You let him pull you along with him and you barely noticed the way the hand that wasn\u2019t holding yours was clenched into a fist at his side. His muscles were tense in anger but he tried to keep himself together for you.</p><p>It was only when you reached the exit that you registered what exactly his plan was. Immediately you halted forcing him to stop with you.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave,\u201d your voice was silent but firm.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay Y/N, these people, they are going to be horrible!\u201d</p><p>You nodded. \u201cBut they are going to be worse if I let them get to me, I have to manage today Peter, they\u2019ll tear me into shreds on Monday if I run away now.\u201d</p><p>Your friend looked worried at you. \u201cI just want you to be safe,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know, but you know, Natasha has been giving me self-defense classes\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter managed a small smile and nodded shortly. \u201cI\u2019ll be beside you the whole day.\u201d</p><p>You grinned back, he truly was the best friend you could have wished for, he had always been\u2026 So far he was the only person in the world you had told about your sexuality and you were the only one knowing about him being spider-man. You were a good team and today you would prove it once again.</p><p>.</p><p>The day was\u2026 draining. While most people opted for gaping at you, some even with full blown disgust displayed on their faces, others didn\u2019t refrain from calling you names or even get rough. Luckily you weren\u2019t alone, Peter, Ned and MJ made sure that at least one of them were always with you and there were even a few people who gave you sympathetic smiles or nods of encouragement. Those were definitely the minority however&hellip;</p><p>You had reached the last period of your day and to your disdain your three friends all had to be somewhere else. That\u2019s why you now stood shaking in front of the door to the changing room. Hesitantly you reached for the door handle, pushed it down and hurried into the room, at least that\u2019s what you tried. </p><p>You hadn\u2019t even sat two feet inside, with your head bent down to avoid as many glances as possible when one of the girls stepped up in front of you, blocking your way.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? Do you think we\u2019ll keep letting you creep on us?\u201d the harsh voice of a tall brunette you had assumed to be rather nice until now made you look up.</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cCut it, nobody wants you here, just go and leave us alone, it\u2019s the least you can do after all these years you exploited our nescience for your own purposes.\u201d</p><p>You swallowed heavily as tears threatened to spill out of your eyes, you couldn\u2019t quite place why after all the insults and meanness you endured that day this would throw you off as much as it did. Maybe it was the fact that you had considered the girl who threatened you now a somewhat friend, but most likely it was that for the first time the words hurled at you were true, or at least that was what you thought in that moment. It hadn\u2019t been fair that they didn\u2019t know, you told yourself, it had been so wrong of you, you were disgusting after all\u2026</p><p>Without another word you left through the still open door, not caring that you had let your fa\u00e7ade fall, not caring that the people in the hallways could see your tears. You went to the next best bathroom and locked yourself into a cubicle. Without thinking you started to dial Peter\u2019s number, you needed him to take you away from here.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter was there in a matter of seconds, not bothering that you sat in the girl\u2019s bathroom, he came inside and knocked on the cubicle you were on, you tensed at first not sure if it was him, until he spoke up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Breathing shakily you unlocked the door and stepped outside, you were immediately engulfed in a hug and for a while you simply let Peter hold you as you cried into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you out of here,\u201d Peter mumbled and pressed a kiss to your temple.</p><p>When you had nodded, he guided you outside the building and after a quick glance around he wrapped one arm around your waist and the next thing you knew was you were swinging through New York straight towards the tower.</p><p>.</p><p>You reached the tower safely but with puffy and red eyes from crying. You were feeling rather numb and if it weren\u2019t for Peter you didn\u2019t know if you would have managed your way upstairs.</p><p>The doors of the elevator dinged open and you walked into the kitchen to take a seat at the counter. Peter didn\u2019t know quite what to say, so he started to fuss around you making you a cup of tea and putting a plate with cookies in front of you. You smiled thankfully at him and upon seeing how sad you looked anger flared up in the young boy.</p><p>He was about to say something when voices neared the kitchen you scrambled to make yourself look a bit more decent but of course that didn\u2019t work. Thor and Loki entered the kitchen bantering about something, but stopped their conversation after seeing you two.</p><p>\u201cLady Y/N! Peter! We thought you\u2019d be back later,\u201d the elder of the brothers greeted you, not having had a proper look at you yet.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Loki asked confused that you didn\u2019t jump up immediately to greet them in your usual manner with a tight hug.</p><p>It was then that they had walked in enough to see you.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Loki crouched down beside you.</p><p>\u201cWho hurt you?\u201d Thor seemed furious.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to kill someone?\u201d Loki suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe could make it look like an accident\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not, we would also make it as public as possible, I wouldn\u2019t have any problems with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wait, I\u2019ll make you a hot chocolate first\u2026\u201d</p><p>A teary chuckle escaped your lips and everyone was immediately a bit less tense.</p><p>Thor looked at Peter questioningly who only gave him a sad smile, he would tell them everything in your stead, but it really wasn\u2019t his place to do that. He comfortingly rubbed over your back as you sat up a bit straighter to look at your two favorite gods. You were about to tell them about today\u2019s occurrences when the rest of the team strolled in apparently after a team training session.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take everyone long to access your state and fall quiet for a second before bombarding you with questions and hugs. They too suggested fairly often killing someone for you and if you wouldn\u2019t have been so upset you certainly would have made a joke about earth\u2019s greatest heroes turning into contract killers.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, give her some space!\u201d Peter finally called the adults to order.</p><p>A few apologies were said after realizing they might have indeed overwhelmed you a bit, but you didn\u2019t mind too much it was nice to be drowned in so much kindness and feel cared for after such a day.</p><p>After everyone gathered around you and Peter, it was Clint who dared to ask again.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI-\u201c Your voice was shaky from crying so much and from the fear of telling the avengers about everything, what if they would react badly as well? Sensing your doubts Loki reached for your hand and squeezed gently smiling reassuringly at you. \u201cToday at school, uhm someone- someone found out about me being bi and outed me.\u201d </p><p>You looked down into your lap and started to fidget with your fingers, a tear rolled down your cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d Natasha who stood a bit behind you hugged you tightly and pressed a kiss on the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cYou- You don\u2019t mind?\u201d you whispered, \u201cI mean me being bi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d A few of the guys said simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cWhy would we?\u201d Natasha combed her fingers through your hair. \u201cBesides it doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise\u2026\u201d </p><p>You looked up to see her give you a crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d You deadpanned.</p><p>Natasha only laughed and hugged you again, making the others and you join in.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Tony perked up after a while, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we order some pizza, watch a movie and talk about the best ways to turn those kid\u2019s lives into hell?\u201d</p><p>.</p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndJHIKwtItZS9uo6y2Qalg\">@pamplemousse-m</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXeese0H3qAL8DvIHbxZ1bw\">@marvelouspottering</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJpId-roCBDnwYkTTpTbAAQ\">@aspiring-bookcollector</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA-Vch4D2cJCsJ-81Tu2riQ\">@angelklementieffs</a> </p>",

You had held this secret for so long, had avoided any bullying and now mere weeks before leaving your personal hell crushed down over you. </p><p>Someone gently putting his hand on your shoulder and tugging slightly brought you back into reality, the sound of laughing and voices calling names at you filled your ears, but there also was something soft, something kind.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Peter spoke against your ear.</p><p>You let him pull you along with him and you barely noticed the way the hand that wasn\u2019t holding yours was clenched into a fist at his side. His muscles were tense in anger but he tried to keep himself together for you.</p><p>It was only when you reached the exit that you registered what exactly his plan was. Immediately you halted forcing him to stop with you.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave,\u201d your voice was silent but firm.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay Y/N, these people, they are going to be horrible!\u201d</p><p>You nodded. \u201cBut they are going to be worse if I let them get to me, I have to manage today Peter, they\u2019ll tear me into shreds on Monday if I run away now.\u201d</p><p>Your friend looked worried at you. \u201cI just want you to be safe,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know, but you know, Natasha has been giving me self-defense classes\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter managed a small smile and nodded shortly. \u201cI\u2019ll be beside you the whole day.\u201d</p><p>You grinned back, he truly was the best friend you could have wished for, he had always been\u2026 So far he was the only person in the world you had told about your sexuality and you were the only one knowing about him being spider-man. You were a good team and today you would prove it once again.</p><p>.</p><p>The day was\u2026 draining. While most people opted for gaping at you, some even with full blown disgust displayed on their faces, others didn\u2019t refrain from calling you names or even get rough. Luckily you weren\u2019t alone, Peter, Ned and MJ made sure that at least one of them were always with you and there were even a few people who gave you sympathetic smiles or nods of encouragement. Those were definitely the minority however\u2026</p><p>You had reached the last period of your day and to your disdain your three friends all had to be somewhere else. That\u2019s why you now stood shaking in front of the door to the changing room. Hesitantly you reached for the door handle, pushed it down and hurried into the room, at least that\u2019s what you tried. </p><p>You hadn\u2019t even sat two feet inside, with your head bent down to avoid as many glances as possible when one of the girls stepped up in front of you, blocking your way.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? Do you think we\u2019ll keep letting you creep on us?\u201d the harsh voice of a tall brunette you had assumed to be rather nice until now made you look up.</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cCut it, nobody wants you here, just go and leave us alone, it\u2019s the least you can do after all these years you exploited our nescience for your own purposes.\u201d</p><p>You swallowed heavily as tears threatened to spill out of your eyes, you couldn\u2019t quite place why after all the insults and meanness you endured that day this would throw you off as much as it did. Maybe it was the fact that you had considered the girl who threatened you now a somewhat friend, but most likely it was that for the first time the words hurled at you were true, or at least that was what you thought in that moment. It hadn\u2019t been fair that they didn\u2019t know, you told yourself, it had been so wrong of you, you were disgusting after all\u2026</p><p>Without another word you left through the still open door, not caring that you had let your fa\u00e7ade fall, not caring that the people in the hallways could see your tears. You went to the next best bathroom and locked yourself into a cubicle. Without thinking you started to dial Peter\u2019s number, you needed him to take you away from here.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter was there in a matter of seconds, not bothering that you sat in the girl\u2019s bathroom, he came inside and knocked on the cubicle you were on, you tensed at first not sure if it was him, until he spoke up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Breathing shakily you unlocked the door and stepped outside, you were immediately engulfed in a hug and for a while you simply let Peter hold you as you cried into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you out of here,\u201d Peter mumbled and pressed a kiss to your temple.</p><p>When you had nodded, he guided you outside the building and after a quick glance around he wrapped one arm around your waist and the next thing you knew was you were swinging through New York straight towards the tower.</p><p>.</p><p>You reached the tower safely but with puffy and red eyes from crying. You were feeling rather numb and if it weren\u2019t for Peter you didn\u2019t know if you would have managed your way upstairs.</p><p>The doors of the elevator dinged open and you walked into the kitchen to take a seat at the counter. Peter didn\u2019t know quite what to say, so he started to fuss around you making you a cup of tea and putting a plate with cookies in front of you. You smiled thankfully at him and upon seeing how sad you looked anger flared up in the young boy.</p><p>He was about to say something when voices neared the kitchen you scrambled to make yourself look a bit more decent but of course that didn\u2019t work. Thor and Loki entered the kitchen bantering about something, but stopped their conversation after seeing you two.</p><p>\u201cLady Y/N! Peter! We thought you\u2019d be back later,\u201d the elder of the brothers greeted you, not having had a proper look at you yet.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Loki asked confused that you didn\u2019t jump up immediately to greet them in your usual manner with a tight hug.</p><p>It was then that they had walked in enough to see you.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Loki crouched down beside you.</p><p>\u201cWho hurt you?\u201d Thor seemed furious.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to kill someone?\u201d Loki suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe could make it look like an accident\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not, we would also make it as public as possible, I wouldn\u2019t have any problems with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wait, I\u2019ll make you a hot chocolate first\u2026\u201d</p><p>A teary chuckle escaped your lips and everyone was immediately a bit less tense.</p><p>Thor looked at Peter questioningly who only gave him a sad smile, he would tell them everything in your stead, but it really wasn\u2019t his place to do that. He comfortingly rubbed over your back as you sat up a bit straighter to look at your two favorite gods. You were about to tell them about today\u2019s occurrences when the rest of the team strolled in apparently after a team training session.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take everyone long to access your state and fall quiet for a second before bombarding you with questions and hugs. They too suggested fairly often killing someone for you and if you wouldn\u2019t have been so upset you certainly would have made a joke about earth\u2019s greatest heroes turning into contract killers.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, give her some space!\u201d Peter finally called the adults to order.</p><p>A few apologies were said after realizing they might have indeed overwhelmed you a bit, but you didn\u2019t mind too much it was nice to be drowned in so much kindness and feel cared for after such a day.</p><p>After everyone gathered around you and Peter, it was Clint who dared to ask again.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI-\u201c Your voice was shaky from crying so much and from the fear of telling the avengers about everything, what if they would react badly as well? Sensing your doubts Loki reached for your hand and squeezed gently smiling reassuringly at you. \u201cToday at school, uhm someone- someone found out about me being bi and outed me.\u201d </p><p>You looked down into your lap and started to fidget with your fingers, a tear rolled down your cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d Natasha who stood a bit behind you hugged you tightly and pressed a kiss on the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cYou- You don\u2019t mind?\u201d you whispered, \u201cI mean me being bi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d A few of the guys said simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cWhy would we?\u201d Natasha combed her fingers through your hair. \u201cBesides it doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise\u2026\u201d </p><p>You looked up to see her give you a crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d You deadpanned.</p><p>Natasha only laughed and hugged you again, making the others and you join in.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Tony perked up after a while, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we order some pizza, watch a movie and talk about the best ways to turn those kid\u2019s lives into hell?\u201d</p><p>.</p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndJHIKwtItZS9uo6y2Qalg\">@pamplemousse-m</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXeese0H3qAL8DvIHbxZ1bw\">@marvelouspottering</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJpId-roCBDnwYkTTpTbAAQ\">@aspiring-bookcollector</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA-Vch4D2cJCsJ-81Tu2riQ\">@angelklementieffs</a> </p></p>",

Could you write one (an angsty one I guess) where the reader (female, teen, and bi) is outed at school and she comes back to the tower really sad. And maybe Loki, Thor, and Peter, are all like \u201cwhAT HAPPENED WHO HURT YOU?!\u201d And basically she explains what happened and they just comfort her? And then maybe at the end it\u2019s just the entire tower being supportive and comforting. Lol and maybe Natasha\u2019s like \u201cI had a hunch.\u201d Thanks\ud83d\udc96</p><p><b>Note:</b> Okay, remember how I said this month woud be 100 percent fluffy? Well, this one\u2019s a bit angsty. Really, there are a lot of nasty kids in this one, but the avengers definitely make up for it, sooo enjoy &lt;3</p><p>Tags and requests are open :D</p><p><b>Warnings:</b> angst, insecurities, but I promise there\u2019s fluff at the end</p><p><b>Pairing:</b> avengers x bi!fem!teen!reader (mainly peter p., thor and loki)</p><p><b>Words:</b> 1.998</p><p><a href=\"https://wokeupinawalnut.tumblr.com/post/169012698167/wokeupinawalnuts-masterlist\">Masterlist</a></p><p>Check out my other pride fics <a href=\"https://wokeupinawalnut.tumblr.com/post/174751590622/pride-month-fics\">here</a> :)</p><p>.</p><p>Today would be a great day. That was what you thought as you got up in the morning and sat at the breakfast table in your parent\u2019s home eating your cereal. Your school day wouldn\u2019t be particularly long, for the first time in ages you wouldn\u2019t have to write an exam or hold a presentation and most important of all it was Friday and that meant you would go to the tower after school and spend the entirety of your weekend with the avengers.</p><p>So, when you got out of the bus smiling and walked up the front stairs of your school you completely missed the nasty glances or the whispers that followed you inside.</p><p>You had just turned around the corner to the floor your locker was on when your best friend rushed towards you and stopped you in your tracks by putting his hands on your shoulders. He tried to turn you around and pull you along with him but you wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what\u2019s going on?\u201d You frowned.</p><p>\u201cPlease Y/N, you don\u2019t want to go there, just let us leave or something. In fact why don\u2019t we skip school? We\u2019re graduating in a week and have all the important stuff done, let\u2019s just go grab some cake and a coffee\u2026\u201d </p><p>You frowned at Peter\u2019s agitated state, sure, he was always jumpy but now there was a look of panic in his eyes and you would have lied if you said it didn\u2019t make you uneasy.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you gave in, \u201cJust let me get some things\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter vehemently shook his head, but before he could elaborate Flash passed you by smirking.</p><p>\u201cNice decoration on your locker, L/N,\u201d he called towards you and a few guys around started to snicker.</p><p>That was it, despite of his powers you were able to yank your arm free from Peter\u2019s grasp and pushed past the people around you. You wished you hadn\u2019t done it, in the moment you saw the door of your locker you really really wished you had just gone for the cake.</p><p>You swallowed as you took a step closer in a dazed state. Tears pooled in your eyes as you looked over the things attached to your locker. There was a picture of you from the pride parade last weekend, you would have actually liked the photo a lot since it showed you being quite happy, a bi pride flag hung around your shoulders and your friends from the community were by your side, but someone had scribbled over it with a red sharpie in messy handwriting, now SLUT was written over your face and that wasn\u2019t everything\u2026 Aside from the picture other insults had been sprayed over the door with graffiti spray. \u201cFag\u201d, \u201cDrag your disgusting ass out of our school\u201d and \u201cAbomination\u201d were among the nicer things your classmates had come up with.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know how long you had stood there, gaping at the sight in front of you.

Could you write one (an angsty one I guess) where the reader (female, teen, and bi) is outed at school and she comes back to the tower really sad. And maybe Loki, Thor, and Peter, are all like &ldquo;whAT HAPPENED WHO HURT YOU?!&rdquo; And basically she explains what happened and they just comfort her? And then maybe at the end it&rsquo;s just the entire tower being supportive and comforting. Lol and maybe Natasha&rsquo;s like &ldquo;I had a hunch.&rdquo; Thanks&#128150;</p><p><b>Note:</b> Okay, remember how I said this month woud be 100 percent fluffy? Well, this one&rsquo;s a bit angsty. Really, there are a lot of nasty kids in this one, but the avengers definitely make up for it, sooo enjoy &lt;3</p><p>Tags and requests are open :D</p><p><b>Warnings:</b> angst, insecurities, but I promise there&rsquo;s fluff at the end</p><p><b>Pairing:</b> avengers x bi!fem!teen!reader (mainly peter p., thor and loki)</p><p><b>Words:</b> 1.998</p><p><a href=\"https://wokeupinawalnut.tumblr.com/post/169012698167/wokeupinawalnuts-masterlist\">Masterlist</a></p><p>Check out my other pride fics <a href=\"https://wokeupinawalnut.tumblr.com/post/174751590622/pride-month-fics\">here</a> :)</p><p>.</p><p>Today would be a great day. That was what you thought as you got up in the morning and sat at the breakfast table in your parent&rsquo;s home eating your cereal. Your school day wouldn&rsquo;t be particularly long, for the first time in ages you wouldn&rsquo;t have to write an exam or hold a presentation and most important of all it was Friday and that meant you would go to the tower after school and spend the entirety of your weekend with the avengers.</p><p>So, when you got out of the bus smiling and walked up the front stairs of your school you completely missed the nasty glances or the whispers that followed you inside.</p><p>You had just turned around the corner to the floor your locker was on when your best friend rushed towards you and stopped you in your tracks by putting his hands on your shoulders. He tried to turn you around and pull you along with him but you wouldn&rsquo;t budge.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; You frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Please Y/N, you don&rsquo;t want to go there, just let us leave or something. In fact why don&rsquo;t we skip school? We&rsquo;re graduating in a week and have all the important stuff done, let&rsquo;s just go grab some cake and a coffee&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You frowned at Peter&rsquo;s agitated state, sure, he was always jumpy but now there was a look of panic in his eyes and you would have lied if you said it didn&rsquo;t make you uneasy.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you gave in, &ldquo;Just let me get some things&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Peter vehemently shook his head, but before he could elaborate Flash passed you by smirking.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice decoration on your locker, L/N,&rdquo; he called towards you and a few guys around started to snicker.</p><p>That was it, despite of his powers you were able to yank your arm free from Peter&rsquo;s grasp and pushed past the people around you. You wished you hadn&rsquo;t done it, in the moment you saw the door of your locker you really really wished you had just gone for the cake.</p><p>You swallowed as you took a step closer in a dazed state. Tears pooled in your eyes as you looked over the things attached to your locker. There was a picture of you from the pride parade last weekend, you would have actually liked the photo a lot since it showed you being quite happy, a bi pride flag hung around your shoulders and your friends from the community were by your side, but someone had scribbled over it with a red sharpie in messy handwriting, now SLUT was written over your face and that wasn&rsquo;t everything&hellip; Aside from the picture other insults had been sprayed over the door with graffiti spray. &ldquo;Fag&rdquo;, &ldquo;Drag your disgusting ass out of our school&rdquo; and &ldquo;Abomination&rdquo; were among the nicer things your classmates had come up with.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know how long you had stood there, gaping at the sight in front of you. You had held this secret for so long, had avoided any bullying and now mere weeks before leaving your personal hell crushed down over you. </p><p>Someone gently putting his hand on your shoulder and tugging slightly brought you back into reality, the sound of laughing and voices calling names at you filled your ears, but there also was something soft, something kind.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; Peter spoke against your ear.</p><p>You let him pull you along with him and you barely noticed the way the hand that wasn&rsquo;t holding yours was clenched into a fist at his side. His muscles were tense in anger but he tried to keep himself together for you.</p><p>It was only when you reached the exit that you registered what exactly his plan was. Immediately you halted forcing him to stop with you.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave,&rdquo; your voice was silent but firm.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay Y/N, these people, they are going to be horrible!&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded. &ldquo;But they are going to be worse if I let them get to me, I have to manage today Peter, they&rsquo;ll tear me into shreds on Monday if I run away now.&rdquo;</p><p>Your friend looked worried at you. &ldquo;I just want you to be safe,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but you know, Natasha has been giving me self-defense classes&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Peter managed a small smile and nodded shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be beside you the whole day.&rdquo;</p><p>You grinned back, he truly was the best friend you could have wished for, he had always been&hellip; So far he was the only person in the world you had told about your sexuality and you were the only one knowing about him being spider-man. You were a good team and today you would prove it once again.</p><p>.</p><p>The day was&hellip; draining. While most people opted for gaping at you, some even with full blown disgust displayed on their faces, others didn&rsquo;t refrain from calling you names or even get rough. Luckily you weren&rsquo;t alone, Peter, Ned and MJ made sure that at least one of them were always with you and there were even a few people who gave you sympathetic smiles or nods of encouragement. Those were definitely the minority however&hellip;</p><p>You had reached the last period of your day and to your disdain your three friends all had to be somewhere else. That&rsquo;s why you now stood shaking in front of the door to the changing room. Hesitantly you reached for the door handle, pushed it down and hurried into the room, at least that&rsquo;s what you tried. </p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t even sat two feet inside, with your head bent down to avoid as many glances as possible when one of the girls stepped up in front of you, blocking your way.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here? Do you think we&rsquo;ll keep letting you creep on us?&rdquo; the harsh voice of a tall brunette you had assumed to be rather nice until now made you look up.</p><p>&ldquo;I- I don&rsquo;t-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cut it, nobody wants you here, just go and leave us alone, it&rsquo;s the least you can do after all these years you exploited our nescience for your own purposes.&rdquo;</p><p>You swallowed heavily as tears threatened to spill out of your eyes, you couldn&rsquo;t quite place why after all the insults and meanness you endured that day this would throw you off as much as it did. Maybe it was the fact that you had considered the girl who threatened you now a somewhat friend, but most likely it was that for the first time the words hurled at you were true, or at least that was what you thought in that moment. It hadn&rsquo;t been fair that they didn&rsquo;t know, you told yourself, it had been so wrong of you, you were disgusting after all&hellip;</p><p>Without another word you left through the still open door, not caring that you had let your fa&ccedil;ade fall, not caring that the people in the hallways could see your tears. You went to the next best bathroom and locked yourself into a cubicle. Without thinking you started to dial Peter&rsquo;s number, you needed him to take you away from here.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter was there in a matter of seconds, not bothering that you sat in the girl&rsquo;s bathroom, he came inside and knocked on the cubicle you were on, you tensed at first not sure if it was him, until he spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p><p>Breathing shakily you unlocked the door and stepped outside, you were immediately engulfed in a hug and for a while you simply let Peter hold you as you cried into his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get you out of here,&rdquo; Peter mumbled and pressed a kiss to your temple.</p><p>When you had nodded, he guided you outside the building and after a quick glance around he wrapped one arm around your waist and the next thing you knew was you were swinging through New York straight towards the tower.</p><p>.</p><p>You reached the tower safely but with puffy and red eyes from crying. You were feeling rather numb and if it weren&rsquo;t for Peter you didn&rsquo;t know if you would have managed your way upstairs.</p><p>The doors of the elevator dinged open and you walked into the kitchen to take a seat at the counter. Peter didn&rsquo;t know quite what to say, so he started to fuss around you making you a cup of tea and putting a plate with cookies in front of you. You smiled thankfully at him and upon seeing how sad you looked anger flared up in the young boy.</p><p>He was about to say something when voices neared the kitchen you scrambled to make yourself look a bit more decent but of course that didn&rsquo;t work. Thor and Loki entered the kitchen bantering about something, but stopped their conversation after seeing you two.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Y/N! Peter! We thought you&rsquo;d be back later,&rdquo; the elder of the brothers greeted you, not having had a proper look at you yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Loki asked confused that you didn&rsquo;t jump up immediately to greet them in your usual manner with a tight hug.</p><p>It was then that they had walked in enough to see you.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Loki crouched down beside you.</p><p>&ldquo;Who hurt you?&rdquo; Thor seemed furious.</p><p>&ldquo;Do we have to kill someone?&rdquo; Loki suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;We could make it look like an accident&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or not, we would also make it as public as possible, I wouldn&rsquo;t have any problems with that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But wait, I&rsquo;ll make you a hot chocolate first&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>A teary chuckle escaped your lips and everyone was immediately a bit less tense.</p><p>Thor looked at Peter questioningly who only gave him a sad smile, he would tell them everything in your stead, but it really wasn&rsquo;t his place to do that. He comfortingly rubbed over your back as you sat up a bit straighter to look at your two favorite gods. You were about to tell them about today&rsquo;s occurrences when the rest of the team strolled in apparently after a team training session.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take everyone long to access your state and fall quiet for a second before bombarding you with questions and hugs. They too suggested fairly often killing someone for you and if you wouldn&rsquo;t have been so upset you certainly would have made a joke about earth&rsquo;s greatest heroes turning into contract killers.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ, give her some space!&rdquo; Peter finally called the adults to order.</p><p>A few apologies were said after realizing they might have indeed overwhelmed you a bit, but you didn&rsquo;t mind too much it was nice to be drowned in so much kindness and feel cared for after such a day.</p><p>After everyone gathered around you and Peter, it was Clint who dared to ask again.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I-&ldquo; Your voice was shaky from crying so much and from the fear of telling the avengers about everything, what if they would react badly as well?
