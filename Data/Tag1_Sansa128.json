Walking was better than standing still. Going anywhere was better than stay where she had been for way too long already.</p><!-- more --><p>But quite soon her teeth clattered and her entire body trembled. Every bit of skin hurt and tingled and the tips of her fingers turned bluer and bluer. Each next step was harder than the step before and eventually she fell down on her knees in the middle of the road. </p><p>She had to keep going. She would freeze to death if she stayed here. </p><p>But death was still better than going back to a life that suffocated and tormented her. </p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d A hand touched her shoulder en Sansa screamed, the heat of his body clashing with her own frozen limbs. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d </p><p>Help. The word tasted sweet on her lips, but she was too weak and too cold to answer.</p><p>\u201cThis will hurt, but I promise you\u2019ll feel better soon.\u201d The stranger\u2019s voice was soothing and calming when he kneeled down and wrapped his arms around her to press his entire body to hers. He was right.</p><p>It hurt. It felt like her body was on fire. It felt like she was perishing here and now.</p><p>But no matter how loud she screamed and how many tears she cried, the stranger didn\u2019t let go off her. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry.\u201d He whispered that same word over and over in her ear. \u201cI&rsquo;m so sorry.\u201d </p><p>When her throat was soar for screaming and she had no more tears to cry, she realised that the burning pain had faded. Her blue fingers turned pink again. Her shivering stopped. She could wiggle her toes and her joints didn\u2019t protest anymore when she tried to push herself up. </p><p>But the stranger didn\u2019t let her go and kept his arms firmly around her.</p><p>Sansa noticed that he was wearing nothing but his pants, but still his skin seemed to glow. He didn\u2019t tremble. His teeth didn\u2019t clatter. His fingers and toes weren\u2019t blue. </p><p>\u201cLet me go\u2026\u201d She whispered, but the stranger refused. </p><p>\u201cNot until you\u2019re completely warmed up again and I can get you home without you freezing to death.\u201d</p><p>Home.</p><p>\u201cMy home is a hundred miles away from here.\u201d She thought about Robb, about Arya, about Rickon and Bran, about her father and her mother.</p><p>They all believed Sansa was happily married to a wealthy nobleman. And she had never dared to tell them differently.</p><p>\u201cYou traveled a hundred miles in this weather dressed like that?\u201d The stranger raised his eyebrows and Sansa quickly shook her head. </p><p>She swallowed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m married to Ramsay Bolton.\u201d She felt the adrenaline rushing through her veins when she said his name out loud. \u201cBut I don\u2019t love him. And his house is not my home. It\u2019s a prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry.\u201d The stranger whispered. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said something he didn\u2019t like.\u201d Sansa let out a deep sigh, not ready to admit that she had simply refused to have sex with him. </p><p>People started whispering he said. Why, after all those months, she wasn\u2019t pregnant yet. If there was anything wrong with her, or even worse, with him. He couldn\u2019t have that. And then he had said that he would fuck her until she couldn\u2019t walk or breath anymore, but was carrying his child. </p><p>\u201cHe threw me out and expected me to crawl back to him on my bare knees.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going back. I\u2019d rather die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d The young man pushed himself up and lifted her up in his arms as if she didn\u2019t weigh a thing. \u201cYou can come home with me for the night and then I\u2019ll get you to your parents tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled, despite everything that had happened tonight she smiled. \u201cI&rsquo;d love that.\u201d</p><p>//</p><p>Jon smiled back at her. He knew the questions would come eventually. </p><p>Why his skin was so hot and glowing. Why he was walking around in the middle of the night all on his own wearing nothing but his pants. \u00a0How he had find her and why he had bothered saving her life.</p><p>And for the first time in all the different lives he had lead, he felt the need to tell someone the truth. And for the first time in all the different lives he had lead, he dared to hope that he had finally found someone to share a life with, until he would perish and go up in flames.</p><p>And then he would be reborn in a world without her. But hopefully that was years and years and years away from today.</p>",

The cobbles were cold beneath her bare feet. The winter wind blew in her face and a shiver rolled down her spine. But she refused to turn around and knock on the door. She refused to beg him if she could come in again. She refused to give into him once more. </p>\n<p>She was done with it. </p>\n<p>She was done with playing the loving wife even though she hated him with ever fibre of her being. She was done satisfying his never ending greed and never getting anything in return. She was done withering away because he never loved her, never appreciated her, saw her as nothing but a pretty jewel he could wear to parties and expensive dinners.</p>\n<p>But she had no idea what to do now. She had no money to get a carriage to drive her home, to her parents, to tell them everything and to ask them to please take her back in. She had no friends anywhere near she could turn to. And in the middle of the night she couldn&rsquo;t just knock on a stranger&rsquo;s door to ask for help.</p>\n<p>After all, Ramsay probably wasn&rsquo;t the only villain in this world.</p>\n<p>She started walking anyway, even though she didn&rsquo;t know where she was going. Walking was better than standing still. Going anywhere was better than stay where she had been for way too long already.</p>\n</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Of course! I\u2019d be happy to. So before Sansa appears at Castle Black we have that scene where Jon is saying that he\u2019s leaving. We get the impression that he\u2019s been beaten down, that he\u2019s disillusioned with the world after what he\u2019s been through. He\u2019s essentially saying he\u2019s done, he\u2019s out, he knows the white walkers are coming for them all and he doesn\u2019t care anymore, he\u2019s going to go carve out a nice spot somewhere warm and wait for death basically.</p><p>Then Sansa shows up. Like Sophie said in one of her interviews, she galvanizes Jon and stirs him back into action. <i>Sansa</i> gives him a purpose again. He knows that he has to protect her now.
