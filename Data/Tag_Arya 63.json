Sansa shouldn\u2019t have been sorry for letting him down&hellip; <i>but I am</i>.</p><p>Instead of responding, she wrapped her arms around Arya\u2019s back, knotted and tight from the perils she had gone through for years. Sansa used to sleep with all of her siblings, but it seemed Arya was the only one left (she didn\u2019t count Bran, because he claimed to be \u201cabove sleep\u201d as the Three-Eyed Raven).</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell him you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Arya breathed into her ear, both of their eyes closing as they readied themselves to dream. \u201cHe\u2019ll mock you, and I don\u2019t want to kill someone you seem to like.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Sansa awoke to her sister\u2019s body fully entangled in her own. Growing up in Winterfell, Sansa always had to curl up with one of her siblings to sleep. Robb was her go-to, since he was bigger and older than her. Then it was Arya, and the two of them normally disbanded their daily-feuds to sleep together. Bran was after, and Sansa had to admit he was her favorite. At least, he was before. Finally it was little Rickon, although she wished she had gotten to see him more before his death.</p><p>To get out from the mess of limbs, Sansa had to wriggle through hands and feet. Of course, she tried not to wake Arya, but instead she managed to fall off the bed when she finally freed herself, and the noise immediately made her sister\u2019s eyes open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d Arya groaned, still tired.</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d Sansa didn\u2019t bother changing out of her nightgown and proceeded out of her chambers. </p><p>She was lucky enough to have found him sitting against a wall outside, displaying the vast environment around Winterfell. \u201cSer.\u201d</p><p>His head moved slightly to face her. \u201cI\u2019m not a knight, little bird. You should know that.\u201d His eyes examined her face. \u201cYou survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d </p><p>The Hound turned his head away, taking a swing at his drink. \u201cYou also changed quite a bit, little bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did as well.\u201d Sansa took a step closer. \u201cI told you to change when we were in King\u2019s Landing. You were mean, cruel-\u201c</p><p>Sandor laughed. \u201cAye, that I was.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s eyebrows creased. \u201c<b>When I told you to \u201cchange\u201d, I didn\u2019t mean for you to leave me behind.</b>\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicked to hers. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you arrived at Winterfell with Daenerys and Jon, you avoided me. I tried to find you, to talk to you, but you kept walking away. Gods! It was like walking in circles, and then I\u2019d get lost and reconcile with someone along the way and forget all about my quest in search of you.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Sandor handed her the drink. He thought she seemed frustrated, and drinking was the only thing that made his problems go away. That and killing people.</p><p>Sansa grabbed it with little hesitation, tilting her head back and letting the liquid pour down her throat. She didn\u2019t realize how strong it tasted, and when her head moved down she broke into a fit of coughs. Sandor forced out a rumbling laugh, and following soon was Sansa\u2019s own giggles.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he started. \u201cYour sister never used to shut up about you when we traveled together. She complained about you and Joffrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard she had a kill list, right?\u201d Sansa looked over. \u201cWas I ever on it?\u201d</p><p>Sandor frowned. \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t.\u201d Looking past the wall, he continued. \u201cI was, once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d Her voice rose in interest. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of things.\u201d The Hound trailed off. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave you behind when I changed. I thought about what a stupid fucking man I was as the King\u2019s bodyguard. I took care of Arya, partly because I wanted money, but also because I felt I let you down. I should have taken you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI felt guilty, going to speak with you.

He told me I was a cold little bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like him.\u201d Sansa still couldn\u2019t believe it was him who Arya journeyed with. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s been avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he doesn\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Arya offered. \u201cWhat did you last talk about?\u201d</p><p>Sansa knew immediately. \u201cHe offered to take me with him. Away from King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you denied?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Arya\u2019s arms fell off of Sansa\u2019s shoulders and suddenly she felt cold. \u201cWell that\u2019s why. He\u2019s probably embarrassed. I can go speak to him-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she blurted. \u201cArya, if he feels that way, I should go and talk to him myself. That way I can apologize.\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s brow creased. \u201cWhy would you apologize?\u201d</p><p>Her sister was right. Why was she going to apologize? Sansa shouldn\u2019t have been sorry for letting him down\u2026 <i>but I am</i>.</p><p>Instead of responding, she wrapped her arms around Arya\u2019s back, knotted and tight from the perils she had gone through for years. Sansa used to sleep with all of her siblings, but it seemed Arya was the only one left (she didn\u2019t count Bran, because he claimed to be \u201cabove sleep\u201d as the Three-Eyed Raven).</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell him you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Arya breathed into her ear, both of their eyes closing as they readied themselves to dream. \u201cHe\u2019ll mock you, and I don\u2019t want to kill someone you seem to like.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Sansa awoke to her sister\u2019s body fully entangled in her own. Growing up in Winterfell, Sansa always had to curl up with one of her siblings to sleep. Robb was her go-to, since he was bigger and older than her. Then it was Arya, and the two of them normally disbanded their daily-feuds to sleep together. Bran was after, and Sansa had to admit he was her favorite. At least, he was before. Finally it was little Rickon, although she wished she had gotten to see him more before his death.</p><p>To get out from the mess of limbs, Sansa had to wriggle through hands and feet. Of course, she tried not to wake Arya, but instead she managed to fall off the bed when she finally freed herself, and the noise immediately made her sister\u2019s eyes open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d Arya groaned, still tired.</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d Sansa didn\u2019t bother changing out of her nightgown and proceeded out of her chambers. </p><p>She was lucky enough to have found him sitting against a wall outside, displaying the vast environment around Winterfell. \u201cSer.\u201d</p><p>His head moved slightly to face her. \u201cI\u2019m not a knight, little bird. You should know that.\u201d His eyes examined her face. \u201cYou survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d </p><p>The Hound turned his head away, taking a swing at his drink. \u201cYou also changed quite a bit, little bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did as well.\u201d Sansa took a step closer. \u201cI told you to change when we were in King\u2019s Landing. You were mean, cruel-\u201c</p><p>Sandor laughed. \u201cAye, that I was.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s eyebrows creased. \u201c<b>When I told you to \u201cchange\u201d, I didn\u2019t mean for you to leave me behind.</b>\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicked to hers. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you arrived at Winterfell with Daenerys and Jon, you avoided me. I tried to find you, to talk to you, but you kept walking away. Gods! It was like walking in circles, and then I\u2019d get lost and reconcile with someone along the way and forget all about my quest in search of you.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Sandor handed her the drink. He thought she seemed frustrated, and drinking was the only thing that made his problems go away. That and killing people.</p><p>Sansa grabbed it with little hesitation, tilting her head back and letting the liquid pour down her throat. She didn\u2019t realize how strong it tasted, and when her head moved down she broke into a fit of coughs. Sandor forced out a rumbling laugh, and following soon was Sansa\u2019s own giggles.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he started. \u201cYour sister never used to shut up about you when we traveled together. She complained about you and Joffrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard she had a kill list, right?\u201d Sansa looked over. \u201cWas I ever on it?\u201d</p><p>Sandor frowned. \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t.\u201d Looking past the wall, he continued. \u201cI was, once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d Her voice rose in interest. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of things.\u201d The Hound trailed off. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave you behind when I changed. I thought about what a stupid fucking man I was as the King\u2019s bodyguard. I took care of Arya, partly because I wanted money, but also because I felt I let you down. I should have taken you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI felt guilty, going to speak with you. You\u2019re much less of a little bird now than before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve both changed,\u201d she restated.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Sandor tipped his head back and sent the alcohol down his throat. The only good thing about staying in Winterfell was seeing the Stark girls again and drinking.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"officerhaughtismygirlfriend:Jyo3GodcliWCjJJbj1Ge2Q:ZkQHpg2PUAflx\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ab08fed7c62a11d7b40cb84840b63e4/tumblr_ovi5mtc1JW1vwh6d6o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>tagging: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJBJtScsiD6fnU6R8FIOT2Q\">@downwithwritersblock</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLgIYaOZMNY2KSUMJ9o2ebA\">@passion-of-the-stark</a> </p></p>",
