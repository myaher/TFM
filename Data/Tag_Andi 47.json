They always talk to each other as if they are miles away, and even though everyone around them gets tired of it, they never do. TJ Kippen, basketball enthusiast, calmly walked up to his locker to throw in his science binder and grab his one for English. He was calm until his eye caught Cyrus Goodman: not a disaster enthusiast, just disaster. He was running on 3 hours of sleep, a migraine, two caramel macchiatos, and a can of Red Bull. How he\u2019s alive? Who knows. Cyrus is trying to get his locker open, and quick to the rescue, TJ Kippen is there to sweep his prince off his feet. TJ dropped his binder on the floor and helped Cyrus. </p><p>TJ: \u201cHey, do you need help?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cActually yeah, that would be greatly appreciated.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cAlright, what\u2019s your combination?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cMy birthday.\u201d </p><p>TJ punches in the combination but no luck.</p><p>Cyrus: \u201cHang on, let me try again.\u201d </p><p>Once again Cyrus tries but nothing. His frustration kicks in and he\u2019s flooring \u201chis\u201d locker. </p><p>TJ: \u201cHere, let me help.\u201d </p><p>As Cyrus is angrily throwing numbers into the lock, TJ shyly throws his hand onto Cyrus\u2019 hand. </p><p>A red storm sweeps across TJ\u2019s face and moves onto Cyrus\u2019. </p><p>TJ: \u201cSorry Cyrus, I touched your Cyrus- uHH I mean your sand- wAIT nO! Wow! I\u2019m making SUCH a foOl of myself RIGHT NOW! TJ I\u2019m sorry for- wait no I\u2019m TJ YOURE TYRUS! GOD NO WAIT I-\u201c </p><p>Flustered, TJ dipped, picking up his binder and leaving a confused Cyrus behind. </p><p>Cyrus doesn\u2019t know what just happened but he shakes it off and tries to open his locker again. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cUgh!\u201d </p><p>He looks up. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cCome ON, locker 307- wait 307 is TJ\u2019s loc- oh god. Oh god oh god oh god OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!!! I\u2019ve been trying to open TJ\u2019s locker this whole- wait but he knew it was his locker&hellip;. Why would he help me open his OWN locker that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Maybe he\u2019s tired like me? Maybe he\u2019s distracted? There is a game next week wait no TJ is benched for that game after he locked Metcalf\u2019s door and played music on the speakers.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus laughed, letting the memory absorb his thoughts. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cAll you could hear was WHO LET THE DOGS WHO WHO WHO WHO WHO LET THE DOGS OUT WHO WHO WHO WHO that was a good prank but he\u2019s benched so the game isn\u2019t distracting him and I can\u2019t think of anything else so it must be fatigue- it has to be&hellip;. Right?\u201d </p><p>Confused, Cyrus moved to his locker and wondered about TJ. </p><h2>Meanwhile: TJ </h2><p>TJ was feeling all kinds of emotions: he felt like the world\u2019s biggest idiot, he felt anxious, frustrated, confused, and embarrassed. </p><p>What must Cyrus think of me now? Why was I feeling so nervous? Cyrus and I have been friends for months and I\u2019ve always felt the same way&hellip;. Right? No, not right. Definitely not right. Ever since we made up after the gun incident I\u2019ve felt&hellip;. Diffrent around Cyrus. I felt like I was gonna throw up. My stomach might implode and my heart might combust! Ever since that day at the swings, I\u2019ve felt&hellip;. I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been feeling different. TJ is more confused than ever. He\u2019s not sure <i><b>what </b></i>he\u2019s feeling, but he wants to throw up. </p><p>Marty: \u201cEarth to TJ?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cWhat? Oh hey!\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cAre you okay?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201c Yeah! I\u2019m fine, why do you ask?\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the bathroom for ten minutes mumbling something about your heart throwing up and your stomach exploding when you see&hellip;. Papyrus?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cThat\u2019s not even close to what I was thin- wait what have you been doing in here for the last 10 minutes?\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cWell, it\u2019s the bathroom, which means you do anything but actually go to the bathroom. So since I stole Buffy\u2019s lipstick earlier, I wrote \u2018Mr. The Party\u2019 on the mirror, then I ate my sandwich, then I drank my juice, then I-\u201c </p><p>TJ: \u201cAlright I get it. Bye Marty.\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cTo make things right.\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cOh with that papyrus plant? I\u2019m not sure where you found papyrus in Shadyside I mean it\u2019s only available in exotic places like Sears.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cDid you just- Marty there is a Sears in the mall like 30 minutes away- I\u2019m sorry <b><i>that\u2019s </i></b>exotic?

He made his way to his locker hoping to see Cyrus. Fortunately, Cyrus was at his locker. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cOkay, what was that?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cWhy are you so mad?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to sound mad.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cOh.\u201d </p><p>TJ averted his gaze. This was all becoming too real, he didn\u2019t think this through he just wanted to leave Marty. He wasn\u2019t ready to talk about what he\u2019s feeling yet- whatever, he\u2019s feeling, he wasn\u2019t sure. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cTJ. I-\u201c</p><p>Cyrus let out a deep breath. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cI feel different around you.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cI feel diffrent around you too.\u201d </p><p>There was a pause. </p><p>TJ and Cyrus: \u201cEver since that day at the swings I don\u2019t know&hellip;.

They always talk to each other as if they are miles away, and even though everyone around them gets tired of it, they never do. TJ Kippen, basketball enthusiast, calmly walked up to his locker to throw in his science binder and grab his one for English. He was calm until his eye caught Cyrus Goodman: not a disaster enthusiast, just disaster. He was running on 3 hours of sleep, a migraine, two caramel macchiatos, and a can of Red Bull. How he\u2019s alive? Who knows. Cyrus is trying to get his locker open, and quick to the rescue, TJ Kippen is there to sweep his prince off his feet. TJ dropped his binder on the floor and helped Cyrus. </p><p>TJ: \u201cHey, do you need help?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cActually yeah, that would be greatly appreciated.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cAlright, what\u2019s your combination?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cMy birthday.\u201d </p><p>TJ punches in the combination but no luck.</p><p>Cyrus: \u201cHang on, let me try again.\u201d </p><p>Once again Cyrus tries but nothing. His frustration kicks in and he\u2019s flooring \u201chis\u201d locker. </p><p>TJ: \u201cHere, let me help.\u201d </p><p>As Cyrus is angrily throwing numbers into the lock, TJ shyly throws his hand onto Cyrus\u2019 hand. </p><p>A red storm sweeps across TJ\u2019s face and moves onto Cyrus\u2019. </p><p>TJ: \u201cSorry Cyrus, I touched your Cyrus- uHH I mean your sand- wAIT nO! Wow! I\u2019m making SUCH a foOl of myself RIGHT NOW! TJ I\u2019m sorry for- wait no I\u2019m TJ YOURE TYRUS! GOD NO WAIT I-\u201c </p><p>Flustered, TJ dipped, picking up his binder and leaving a confused Cyrus behind. </p><p>Cyrus doesn\u2019t know what just happened but he shakes it off and tries to open his locker again. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cUgh!\u201d </p><p>He looks up. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cCome ON, locker 307- wait 307 is TJ\u2019s loc- oh god. Oh god oh god oh god OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!!! I\u2019ve been trying to open TJ\u2019s locker this whole- wait but he knew it was his locker\u2026. Why would he help me open his OWN locker that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Maybe he\u2019s tired like me? Maybe he\u2019s distracted? There is a game next week wait no TJ is benched for that game after he locked Metcalf\u2019s door and played music on the speakers.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus laughed, letting the memory absorb his thoughts. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cAll you could hear was WHO LET THE DOGS WHO WHO WHO WHO WHO LET THE DOGS OUT WHO WHO WHO WHO that was a good prank but he\u2019s benched so the game isn\u2019t distracting him and I can\u2019t think of anything else so it must be fatigue- it has to be\u2026. Right?\u201d </p><p>Confused, Cyrus moved to his locker and wondered about TJ. </p><h2>Meanwhile: TJ </h2><p>TJ was feeling all kinds of emotions: he felt like the world\u2019s biggest idiot, he felt anxious, frustrated, confused, and embarrassed. </p><p>What must Cyrus think of me now? Why was I feeling so nervous? Cyrus and I have been friends for months and I\u2019ve always felt the same way\u2026. Right? No, not right. Definitely not right. Ever since we made up after the gun incident I\u2019ve felt\u2026. Diffrent around Cyrus. I felt like I was gonna throw up. My stomach might implode and my heart might combust! Ever since that day at the swings, I\u2019ve felt\u2026. I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been feeling different. TJ is more confused than ever. He\u2019s not sure <i><b>what </b></i>he\u2019s feeling, but he wants to throw up. </p><p>Marty: \u201cEarth to TJ?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cWhat? Oh hey!\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cAre you okay?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201c Yeah! I\u2019m fine, why do you ask?\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the bathroom for ten minutes mumbling something about your heart throwing up and your stomach exploding when you see\u2026. Papyrus?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cThat\u2019s not even close to what I was thin- wait what have you been doing in here for the last 10 minutes?\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cWell, it\u2019s the bathroom, which means you do anything but actually go to the bathroom. So since I stole Buffy\u2019s lipstick earlier, I wrote \u2018Mr. The Party\u2019 on the mirror, then I ate my sandwich, then I drank my juice, then I-\u201c </p><p>TJ: \u201cAlright I get it. Bye Marty.\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cTo make things right.\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cOh with that papyrus plant? I\u2019m not sure where you found papyrus in Shadyside I mean it\u2019s only available in exotic places like Sears.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cDid you just- Marty there is a Sears in the mall like 30 minutes away- I\u2019m sorry <b><i>that\u2019s </i></b>exotic? Marty you seriously have like (1) one brain cell.\u201d </p><p>Marty: \u201cDawg, what\u2019s a brain cell?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cOh dear GOD I rest my case. Goodbye hopefully forever Marty.\u201d </p><p>TJ left the bathroom feeling sorry for Marty\u2019s parents. </p><p>Marty: \u201cI don\u2019t know why homie left I was gonna show him my second sandwich.\u201d </p><h2>Anyway\u2026. </h2><p>TJ clutched his binder since the comfort of Cyrus\u2019s hand was not an option. He made his way to his locker hoping to see Cyrus. Fortunately, Cyrus was at his locker. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cOkay, what was that?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cWhy are you so mad?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to sound mad.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cOh.\u201d </p><p>TJ averted his gaze. This was all becoming too real, he didn\u2019t think this through he just wanted to leave Marty. He wasn\u2019t ready to talk about what he\u2019s feeling yet- whatever, he\u2019s feeling, he wasn\u2019t sure. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cTJ. I-\u201c</p><p>Cyrus let out a deep breath. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cI feel different around you.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cI feel diffrent around you too.\u201d </p><p>There was a pause. </p><p>TJ and Cyrus: \u201cEver since that day at the swings I don\u2019t know\u2026. I have just felt.. Different.\u201d </p><p>Both boys let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>TJ: \u201cHow do you feel diffrent?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cI feel\u2026. Happier. You?\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cI feel happier too.\u201d </p><p>That was a lie. He didn\u2019t know what he felt. </p><p>Cyrus smiled. </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cI have to go.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cOh? Where if you don\u2019t mind me asking.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cI have a doctors appointment.\u201d </p><p>TJ: \u201cOkay! Well, I\u2019ll text you later.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus: \u201cSee you!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus skipped happily away. TJ stood by his locker, smiling over Cyrus.

I've recently catch up on the episodes and Pey and Asher do have a lot chemistry and I feel like the problems they faced when they were together back then are very common around people their age. I don't think it's fair to just completely shut down opportunities for the couple to redeem itself, specially now that they've grown and matured and probably wouldn't make the same mistakes",
        "answer": "<p>I can\u2019t speak for everyone in the fandom, but I can speak for myself!\u00a0</p><p>I actually <i>loved </i>what we saw with Jandi in the early days of the show. Andi\u2019s crush on him was so realistic and perfectly reminded me of what it was like to be 13. When I eventually get around to rewatching the series and hopefully making discussion videos about it, this is something I want to talk more about since it happened prior to this blog existing and people don\u2019t really discuss the events of season 1 a lot. I don\u2019t hate Jandi because of their mistakes or the problems they faced. I still think all of that was incredibly realistic and well-done from a human perspective.\u00a0However, from a story-telling perspective, I think that having the two characters end up in a romantic relationship would be counterproductive and unsatisfying.\u00a0</p><p>A huge part of Andi\u2019s character development has been in her learning to stand up for herself, to be independent, and to be able to free herself from the drama of relationships. Some of her best scenes have been her freeing herself from Jonah Beck. Back in season one, when she quit the Ultimate team and ran away with an expression of pure bliss. At Cyrus\u2019 Bar Mitzvah party, when she points out how she didn\u2019t like feeling so obsessed with him, etc. and feels free in breaking up with him. Even how happy they were following the no-breakup-breakup. Having her end up with Jonah in the finale would just feel like backtracking and erasing all of that.\u00a0</p><p>And the thing about Jonah\u2019s character is that he still hasn\u2019t been given the space to be independent and to be ble to free himself from the drama of relationships. He has constantly been in some sort of relationship pretty much from the start of the show. He hasn\u2019t been given the chance to BREATHE. And for his character development to feel complete, I think he needs to be single for awhile. Especially because his dating habits are directly connected to his mental health (he seeks comfort in romantic relationships to cope with his anxiety, which only makes his anxiety worse). He deserves to be single and to love himself.\u00a0</p><p>The characters really don\u2019t even have romantic chemistry anymore. Andi has stood firm in the fact that she no longer has interest in Jonah, which we saw in the scene after Jamber kissed on the bench (\u201dMack out!\u201d). And Jonah hasn\u2019t shown romantic interest in <i>anybody </i>since Libby either, despite literally being in a relationship right now. So they\u2019re going to have a hard time making these two fall ~in love~ again if that\u2019s the route they take.\u00a0</p><p>I would much rather the characters end on platonic terms, with the possibility of a future together. Rather than them become official endgame. But I guess we\u2019ll see what happens!\u00a0</p><p>I think a lot of the fanbase dislikes Jandi for reasons other than this.
