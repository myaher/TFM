The Russos and Markus/McFeely on Apple Podcasts</a></p><p>Part two of this series of posts where I listen to the writers and directors of ENDGAME. </p><p>They talk about Joe\u2019s cameo how \u201crepresentation is huge\u201d for them. Blah blah. </p><p>Asked how old Cap is in this timeline at the end of the movie and the Russos are like \u201cthere\u2019s some missing story there.\u201d Some people would call that a plot HOLE. That is an interesting dodge. </p><p>Re: Clint. \u201cHe didn\u2019t lose to Thanos.\u201d His experience is different. They talk about him losing his family as one of the \u201cmost interesting\u201d to them. Joe talks about having dour kids (two of which are in the movie). </p><p>Interviewer suggests each of the Avengers has responds with one of the traditional \u201cFive Stages of Grief.\u201d I think that is giving them too much credit.</p><p>They call Thor \u201ctragic\u201d and say he is \u201cbeating himself up physically\u201d for his failure. The interviewer asks about playing that for comedy, which I think is a good question. They say they don\u2019t say the movie is funny until Hulk in the diner, then Joe backtracks and says \u201cwhen Rudd shows up\u201d is when there is hope and that is when there is allowed to be humor. </p><p>Interviewer asks why he doesn\u2019t get his body back when Mjolnir comes to him and they say \u201cThor can\u2019t wash this off that quickly,\u201d that this has \u201cchanged him.\u201d Definitely use the word \u201cdepressed\u201d for him. </p><p>They say Thor is ready to go on a journey of self disovery which is where a lot of the Guardians are. </p><p>\u201cDad bod Thor\u201d can still kick ass they say. I just realized this movie is basically all about fatherhood. </p><p>Regarding Steve, they say Tony and Steve\u2019s are intertwined and since Tony was meant to die&hellip; then they trail off. I think they maybe forced Steve into what they think is a \u201chappy\u201d ending because Tony couldn\u2019t have that? That talk about what he \u201cdeserved\u201d and I guess my question is why is getting married and having kids the only happy ending that was on the table? </p><p>[i take a break] </p>",

It\u2019s that when the final battle happens and the\u00a0\u201csnapped\u201d characters come back, along with their respectful supporting cast, it feels&hellip; earned. It feels like this is what all those ten years were building up for - every superhero, from every corner of the established universe (minus TV shows; which is a shame).</p><p>Then we have Tony Stark\u2019s funeral and the camera is moving slowly from main Avengers, through Spiderman, Guardians of the Galaxy, Scarlet Witch etc, and the finishes on the kid from <i>Iron Man 3</i> and Nick Fury. It\u2019s like a beautiful send-off to a character that started the franchise.</p><p>And <i>then</i> there are the closing credits which list all the heroes that made this beautiful extended universe and there is a sense of closure.</p><p>Now, you know me - I\u2019m not very fond of Tony Stark. And I agree that his rant where he basically calls Cap a liar is bullshit. However, I\u2019ve got a sense that right after he figures out how to make time travel non-lethal he tried to subtly make up for certain things. For example, I\u2019ve seen him giving Steve back his shield as a form of peace offering. Like he was trying to say:\u00a0\u201cI want to help you know. Let\u2019s save the world together.\u201d</p><p>Then there is the segment in 1970 which is very special to me, because once upon a time I\u2019ve written two fics in which - thanks to time travel - Tony Stark and other Avengers get to meet younger Howard Stark and Tony manages to talk with him. In the second fic there is a plot point where Steve assumes the alias of captain Roger Stevens, so yeah&hellip; pretty cool.</p><p>I don\u2019t hate Steve\u2019s ending.

All of it, every file related to the Decimation, every folder with information on how we could get you back. I had F.R.I.D.A.Y. burn it, burn it all. </p><p>I changed the name from &lsquo;Project Parker&rsquo; to just &lsquo;Project&rsquo; before I did it. I don&rsquo;t think I could delete it all with your name still attached. But getting rid of a few words doesn&rsquo;t make me feel any better. It makes me feel like a monster. Because I know I let you- and the rest of the universe- down. </p><p>Selfish is what I&rsquo;ve been called more times than I can remember. But it hit me different when I finally realized it was every bit true. While the world mourns, I&rsquo;ve moved to a cabin away from reality. While the rest of civilization is in chaos, I&rsquo;ve started a new life- the best life than I&rsquo;ve ever had. And now, when I finally realized that maybe, just maybe, the answer to reversing what happened might be <i>time-travel</i>, I give up. </p><p>Time-travel, which would also reverse everything I&rsquo;ve had these last four years, which would take away Morgan- my daughter I would die for any day. Time-travel, which would bring you back, but in the back of my head, it&rsquo;s become just a blur of a thought. There&rsquo;s so many things that could go wrong. Catastrophically. It could make things worse than they are now. Four years ago, I would have gone for it anyways, ignoring any consequences and taking a leap of faith. But now, I&rsquo;ve realized I don&rsquo;t want to dwell on the past- I want to move on. And it hurts like hell to think that. But, at the same time, I feel relieved. </p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry, Peter.
