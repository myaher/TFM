It\u2019s a creative writing trick that tests the reader\u2019s critical skills. In Sansa\u2019s case, as much as I think Arya\u2019s POV isn\u2019t as reliable as people think, Sansa\u2019s own POV also tricks the reader because she hides from the truth and it\u2019s only later one starts realising <i>why</i> that\u2019s happening on a Watsonian level (apart from the zeitgeist). She misremembers traumatic events, she doesn\u2019t want her dreams to shatter and she has issues with Ned, like Arya does with Cat. But unlike Arya, Sansa never spells her issues out and she acts out, especially after Lady\u2019s death and doesn\u2019t reflect on the true roots of it. They\u2019re laying under the surface, covered up by other things but it\u2019s there, and you only realise it as you keep reading and re-reading.

It\u2019s his death that breaks the spell. Despite misremembering a number of other things in the future because they\u2019re traumatic, she never forgets what the Lannisters did to Ned. She never lets herself forget that because although he didn\u2019t explain himself completely and didn\u2019t do a lot of things she was promised, he wanted to protect her.\u00a0</p><p>Was Sansa to blame for Ned\u2019s death? Not exactly. She ran to Cersei because she didn\u2019t trust Ned and she didn\u2019t want to go back to Winterfell where there weren\u2019t singers and the courtly life wasn\u2019t as colourful. She was defying her father on such a scale for the <i>first</i> time and she didn\u2019t go there thinking she would get him arrested. It\u2019s honestly not that different from Lyanna running away with Rhaegar without realising the consequences and the possibility of what it could mean for her father and brothers. The only reason people don\u2019t see it immediately is because the text keeps spelling out Arya and Lyanna parallels, but <a href=\"http://bluecichlid.tumblr.com/post/98692702679/ned-sansa-and-joffrey-part-iii\" target=\"_blank\">there\u2019s a lot of phrases within AGOT</a> that hint that Ned is focusing on the wrong daughter to repeat Lyanna\u2019s mistake.\u00a0</p><p>It was others who wanted Ned arrested/sent to the Wall/dead. Sansa wrote those letters to save Ned and prevent a war from breaking out. She pleaded Joffrey for mercy for her father and was already thinking about convincing Joffrey to shorten Ned\u2019s sentence after a few years of exile. If she unwittingly gave the Lannisters a heads up to trap him (after Ned anyway told Cersei what he was going to do), she did everything she could do after to save him.\u00a0</p><p>But does it matter that that horrific incident makes her realise that her actions - even if unwittingly - have impact and she has to be mindful of that? Yes. And there is weight in acknowledging that <i>because</i> she learns from it.\u00a0</p><p>I get why people could see it as carelessly said because people have been quick to blame a 11-12 year old\u2019s naivety over the actual perpetrators who exploited it.\u00a0The thing with GRRM is the harder questions get, the more meandering his answers become and you have to read between the lines. Again, it\u2019s not to say his internalised issues don\u2019t show. But he spends the rest of the series proving how wrong people were about Sansa. It\u2019s not a redemption arc for unwittingly playing a part in Ned\u2019s fall as much as it is a sympathising arc because of the unreliable POV(s) that convinces you otherwise before. Not that he doesn\u2019t test the boundaries like he does with every character.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",
