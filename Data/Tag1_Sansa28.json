Daenerys knew herself well enough to know this, she was jealous of Sansa Stark. She shouldn&rsquo;t be, but she was.</p><p>Sansa was a beautiful woman. She herself had been called beautiful. Some would even said she was the most beautiful woman in the world, yet, standing next to Sansa, she felt plain. Her hair shone like silver, her eyes were deep amethysts, but&hellip; Sansa was tall and lean, but with curves that made many men look at her. Her face seemed to be made of the finest marble. High cheekbones, rosy lips, sparkling blue eyes and hair that shone like copper. A soft and kind voice rounded her physical attributes.</p><p>And Sansa was loved, deeply. Oh she was.</p><p>Unlike herself, at least, for the most part.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>While people both lowborn and noble alike flocked to her, she was under no delusions as to why. Her throne had been gained by conquest. Three growing dragons had ensured that people followed her, bow to her as their new queen. But many were not pleased, she was, for many of them, a foreigner. Someone who was bringing strange people with her.</p><p>So people came to her, for power, for greed, for desired, only those whose chains she broke, came to her freely. They saw her as their savior, they were grateful and swore themselves to her easily and readily. Seldom came to her with, for and out of love.</p><p>Sansa was loved in court, she made herself loved by being kind and gentle. She had time for all who went to her. War and suffering had made her wise, and she used her wisdom in favor for those who needed it. People whispered of her suffering of in the Red Keep, and only spoke loudly of her virtues. Of how even after her suffering, she still was kind and gentle.</p><p>She had been the one to answer the call in the name of little Lord Arryn when it came to the battle to prevent the Long Night. She had been wise when distributing food in both the Riverlands and the North.</p><p>And whenever she came to the Red Keep, she did charity. Sewed clothes for the poor, gave a few coins here and there. Listened to people&rsquo;s problems and advocated for them. Oh people grew to love her. While she was only tolerated. Indulged. Obeyed, mostly out of fear.</p><p>And she was loved in a more intimate manner too.</p><p>Her own marriage lacked love, it had yet to come and she wanted it. She hoped for it, but so far, it was only a political marriage, no more. Her marriage to Prince Trystane had been a compromise. A bandage to sooth Dorne after Prince Quentyn&rsquo;s unfortunate passing. And of Aegon&rsquo;s rejection of Ariannne. But Trystane seemed almost a child and she, well, she felt almost ancient. He was a kind young man, he treated her with respect and she did in turn. But love had yet to bloom or grow, she hoped that some day, they would love one another.</p><p>She had seen the way her nephew looked at Sansa. Every time she felt a knot in her throat, it was the same way her Sun and Stars looked at her. So full of love and devotion, like she could do no wrong. But then, maybe in his eyes, she didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s marriage to her nephew had also been a political compromise. The North, the Riverlands and the Vale saw no reason to follow either of them. The North had been reluctant to follow her, even with her dragons. The Riverlands were tired of war, but they would not follow her easily. And the Vale? Well, little Lord Arryn did not like them much.</p><p>So, a match between Sansa and Aegon had been put forth. Sansa herself had been reluctant, weary of them both, but specially of Aegon.
