Lay em on me fam.</p><hr><p>When your words first appeared, your heart sang. </p><p>Of course, the words themselves were a reason to celebrate,\nbut as the days went on and the words slowly came into view, your heart was\nfull of love for the one that would someday say those words to you. They were\nbeautiful, and though they were written in shaky handwriting, the feelings\nbehind them drove you to be better and better to be deserving of them. </p><p>They\u2019re part of the reason you wanted to be a hero, so you\ncould push yourself to be the best version of yourself you could be, so you\ncould help as many people as possible and be worthy of the words written across\nyour collarbone. </p><p>That\u2019s why when you were accepted to U.A. High School, you\nwere elated. Another step to becoming the kind of person your soul mate thought\nyou were. All the hard work hadn\u2019t been for nothing, and every night before you\nwent to sleep you ran your fingertips over the words and wished that wherever\nthey were out in the world, they were happy and warm and smiling. </p><p><br/></p><p>U.A. was intimidating, with its sprawling floor plan and looming\nhallways. Finding your classroom had been easy, and you settled yourself\nquickly in your assigned seat, practically vibrating in excitement for the rest\nof your career here. You would excel, you felt it inside of every bone in your\nbody.</p><p>A piece of you was disappointed that you hadn\u2019t met your\nsoulmate today, though the words you exchanged with others in class had been\nfew and far between. Aizawa had been adamant about the quirk appraisal testing\nand didn\u2019t leave much room for chatter. Still, when you went home and laid in\nbed that night, you were hopeful. There was always tomorrow, right?</p><p><br/></p><p>Something inside your heart pulled you to the infirmary\nafter your first Hero training. No one had been seriously hurt with the\nexception of Midoriya Izuku, a boy you hadn\u2019t given much of a glance to, but\nyou had admired his conviction during his practice today. It made you a bit\nworried that he hurt himself so much using his quirk, but he had done it to\nprotect Uraraka and help his team win. Determination like that was enviable. </p><p>Recovery Girl only waved you through as you entered the\ninfirmary, and you followed her direction to one of the cots in the back of the\nroom with a curtain around it. Midoriya was sitting up, one of his arms\nbandaged tightly to his chest while the other was the entry point for an IV\ndrip. He looked worse for the wear, but his face turned into a hesitant smile\nwhen you entered through the curtains. </p><p>His mouth opened for a moment, a slight flush on his cheeks\nat the sight of you, but you cut him off before he could begin and spoke instead,\n\u201cI know we don\u2019t know each other that well, but I just wanted to say that I\nreally admire what you did today. You\u2019re going to be a great hero, I believe\nthat in my heart, and if it\u2019s not too much to ask, I\u2019d really like to be your\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>Midoriya\u2019s mouth clapped shut with a click of his teeth, his\nlower lip wobbling, and immediately his eyes started to well up in tears. With\nboth of his arms out of commission, he could do nothing but bow his head and\nopenly cry with quiet sobs that slowly got louder. Immediately, you thought you\nhad said something insensitive and moved to sit on the bed next to him with\nyour hand reaching out for his un-injured hand, \u201cDid I say something wrong? I\u2019m\nsorry, I can be forward sometimes, but I really\u2014\u201d</p><p>Midoriya\u2019s head snapped up and you finally got a look at his\nexpression. He was crying\u2026 with a smile on his face? His cheeks were still\nflushed, but the light behind his eyes illuminated his features despite his wet\ncheeks, \u201cI-I\u2019ve waited so long to hear that, to hear <i>y-you</i>\u2026 I love you, I\u2019ve loved you since the first second I could\nread your words t-to me\u2026 I knew you were special, a w-wonderful person that I never\nwanted to\u2026 t-to let down\u2026\u201d</p><p>The breath left your lungs in one squeeze, and you knew your\nexpression slowly started to mirror Midoriya\u2019s, tears and all, \u201cY-You\u2019re my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoulmate,\u201d Midoriya laughed out, and you couldn\u2019t help\nyourself from flinging an arm around his shoulders and pulling yourself to his\nchest. His wince made you mindful of his injured arm, but the weight of his head\nsettling on top of yours was more than enough to distract you from\nunintentionally hurting him. </p><p>Slowly, you opened your eyes again and his collarbone was in\nyour sights. You hadn\u2019t looked before, it was considered rude to read someone\u2019s\nsoulmark without asking, but now it was staring you in the face. Your words,\nwritten in your handwriting, were placed delicately along the lines of his\ncollarbone. Reaching a hand up, you ran a fingertip along them, and Midoriya\nlet out a small laugh that was weak from his tears. </p><p>\u201cM-My whole life I\u2026 I\u2019ve wanted to be a hero, a-and when I\nwas told I was quirkless\u2026 I was l-lost\u2026 Then your words came, and e-every night\nI\u2019ve read them and hoped you were out there happy and safe, until I-I could be a\nstrong enough hero to keep you safe myself, the one person that believed in me\nbefore they had even spoke to me for the first time\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tears welled up in your eyes again from his heartfelt words,\nand you buried your face in his neck again. Midoriya\u2019s chest shook from his\nbreath, the long sigh of contentment wavering from the weight of everything\nthat had transpired in the few short minutes since you arrived. His heartbeat\nraced against your cheek, and you were sure yours matched it when you felt the\ngentle press of a kiss on the top of your head. </p>",
