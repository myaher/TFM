The life where you put yourself in danger to save people. He wanted you to have every chance to change the world, but not the way he did. Not the way that brought nightmares and unease. Not the way of a superhero. Not the way of a young woman pushing herself past every breaking point.</p><p>He sacrificed everything for you, to bring you back. So that you\u2019d get to have the life he always wanted you to have.</p><p>God, you were only 16. You were too young to lose your dad. You were too young to step up the way you had. You were too young to be worrying about your little sisters future the way you did, you weren\u2019t even present for those first 5 years of her life. Your dad wanted your life to be amazing, he wanted that for Morgan too, and you\u2019d be damned sure she got to have that.</p><p>You\u2019d make sure she remembered every last good thing your father did to save the entire universe and then some.</p><p>Even if it meant that you wouldn\u2019t have that. Because when your dad told you take care of your mom and sister and that was exactly what you\u2019d do. Even through the darkness. Even through losing people you never thought you would. Even if you had to lose yourself in the process. You would do anything your dad asked you to do.</p><p>After the battle with Thanos, after everything you\u2019d been through, nothing was the same. Your mother said she told him that you\u2019d all be okay, that he could rest. You hadn\u2019t made it to them in time to say any form of goodbye. It tore you apart. How you wondered what your father would think now if he saw the people he loved.</p><p>Pepper knew nothing but work now. She loved her girls, but they were so much like him. Family was her top priority, she loved with everything she had, but you knew she took longer work trips and stayed late just so she wouldn\u2019t have to spend so much time with the two of you.</p><p>Morgan, well, she missed him everyday. She wished every single day she could have had more time with him. She wished that instead of you holding the family together the way you did wasn\u2019t how things were. But, she was grateful for all of it. She loved you with everything she had. It broke her heart seeing you the way you\u2019d become, seeing other become different too.</p><p>Every single person that Tony Stark touched was different now that he was gone.</p><p>However, you\u2019d argue there was one in particular that changed even more than you had.</p><p>You hated yourself for letting it happen. He tried so hard to reach out to you. He tried to help you when someone should have been helping him. In the end, when you pushed him away, you regretted it instantly. Your dad brought you back with everyone else that was lost to the snap. You hadn\u2019t been there with them on Titan when the snap happened. But the second the two of you found each other on the battlefield for that final fight, the two of you fell into the sync you\u2019d both grown accustomed to.</p><p>You and Peter had it, whatever it was. You always had. He cared so deeply for your father and for you. You could feel it in your bones how much he cared.</p><p>You only wished you could have been less focused on other things to notice. He was slipping and you practically stomped on his fingers. He held onto you for as long as he could. He tried being there for you and you could only manage to push him away. You\u2019d been so concerned about so many other things and people, and with how he was trying to be there for you, you hadn\u2019t realized he needed someone too. He needed you because you weren\u2019t just Tony\u2019s daughter to him.</p><p>You were so much more to him, he loved you, even at 16.</p><p>Well, now it was 6 years later and things were so much different.</p><p>Your sister was away for school, your mother was still living on the lake, and you were in the city. You kept it safe the best you could.</p><p>However, every so often he\u2019d come along, just to chat. Oh but it wasn\u2019t because he cared.</p><p>No, Peter didn\u2019t care for much of anything anymore. Only the monster that ran through his veins.</p><p>You were sat on the railing out on the towers balcony. It wasn\u2019t Avengers tower anymore, but it was once your home and you still came back every now and then. The company that bought it those many years ago went bankrupt, it was all but empty now, you bought it back and lived there, all the way at the top. You sat on the edge whenever you had bad nights, contemplating if you\u2019d really just let yourself fall this time.</p><p>The last time you had finally started your decline you were picked right out of the sky. He wouldn\u2019t talk about that night with you.</p><p>There was the soft pad of feet behind you. You didn\u2019t bother to turn around, you knew.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t catch you this time,\u201d his voice sounded deeper and frankly distorted. It was so different than it had been when the two of you were young and still light hearted.</p><p>You wiped the tears from your face as he got closer. \u201cDon\u2019t you have trouble to be getting into, Pete?\u201d You didn\u2019t look back, knowing that you would not find the sweet Peter Parker from long ago. Instead you knew you\u2019d find him donned in what looked like his Spider-Man suit, but what was actually an alien species that called itself Venom.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing here?\u201d He asked.</p><p>You could hear the smirk in his voice. \u201cGo\u2026 I\u2019m in no mood for you to tell me of all the horrible things you\u2019ve been up to, or to argue let alone fight you. We are not friends.\u201d Even though they were your own words they broke you up. You wanted nothing more than for him to stay.</p><p>A low growl was released in your ear. He was practically against your back, but he left enough space so he wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhat about being in the mood for something else?\u201d</p><p>A shiver swept down your spine. You stayed silent for a moment, you knew what he meant. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer you, but you were sure he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>You listened to the sound of Venom retracting. It was nothing like the sound of the nano tech that made up your own suit. Then a pair of lips settled against your shoulder, pulling your from your thoughts and making you pull away. You slipped off the side of the rail, quickly you tapped the arc reactor on your chest. Your all (your fave color) suit formed over your body as you fell.</p><p>As tempting as it was, you flew right back up. </p><p>\u201cCome on Y/N, you know hate sex is the best outlet.\u201d</p><p>You scoffed and shook your head. \u201cI told you. That was a mistake. One I\u2019m never making again.\u201d</p><p>Peter smirked at you, a brow arched. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d The black symbiote shot out for you, it wrapped around your waist and pulled you right into him. He tapped your arc reactor and loosened his grip on you once your suit was gone.</p><p>You looked away from him, knowing struggling against him would only make him hold you tighter.</p><p>His hand came up and stroked through your hair. His other cupped your chin and turned your head back towards him.</p><p>His eyes were so much darker than you remember. You missed the sweet brown they used to be. How bright they were. Now the darkness around them practically made them black.</p><p>Yet even through that darkness you could see it, the want he had for you.</p><p>It was undeniable. It was always there, and the first time you gave into him, you didn\u2019t regret it. You just wished the circumstances were different. But here you were, falling back into him.</p><p>He pulled you in closer and kissed you.</p><p>It happened quickly, you ended up back in the penthouse, not even making it to your room the two of you wound up on the couch.</p><p>Clothes were shed, bodies pressed together, being with Peter was pure ecstacy.</p><p>It was the only time you didn\u2019t feel alone.</p><p>The only moments where you felt something other than the pain of your past.</p><p>You laid on Peter\u2019s chest, both of you panting.</p><p>And even covered in sweat, being there like that felt right. Like nothing was ever going to be as right as you being with him.</p><p>Perhaps it was all of the pain you\u2019d been thinking about prior to all of this. Or maybe it was because deep down you knew how you felt for him. But the words slipped passed your lips so quietly and without warning.</p><p>\u201cStay with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>You could feel his body tense, you almost backpedaled but his words silenced anything that may have come to mind.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said firmly, like he was making sure not only you knew but almost as if he was trying to convince himself of the answer as well.</p><p>You tried to stop the tears that filled your eyes but they slipped to his chest before you could will them away. \u201cPlease, I-&hellip; I don\u2019t trust myself to be alone\u2026\u201d</p><p>He sat up, taking you with him. His hands held your shoulders and he forced you to look at him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t trust myself to be alone with you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it any different than this right now?\u201d You asked, timidly.</p><p>He shook his head as if you should understand exactly what he meant. He shifted you from his lap and started replacing his clothes. You followed suit and put your own back on, expecting an uncomfortable conversation to happen was not something you wanted to do naked.</p><p>He answered you once his pants were back on. \u201cThis\u2026 this is just sex, Y/N. That\u2019s how it\u2019s different. Nothing is going to come from this. It can\u2019t, I won\u2019t let it. I won\u2019t let you get hurt by us. You have no idea what I am now. What we can do and not even know it. We could kill you in your sleep and you wouldn\u2019t even see it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Pete\u2026\u201d you said it barely above a whisper. You were not one to beg but you couldn\u2019t help yourself. You needed him.</p><p>The symbiote covered his skin. The man you just gave your body to, was replaced by his monstrous other half. \u201cFind someone else if you need someone that bad. I\u2019ve hurt you enough. I won\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Rage filled your heart. If only he knew that his solution was more painful than anything else he could have done. \u201cGo.\u201d You said it with such anger in your voice he thought he just misheard you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGET OUT AND NEVER COME BACK,\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs.</p><p>Venom retracted, Peter could only look at you in utter shock.</p><p>\u201cOne night!\u201d You sobbed. \u201cThat was all I was asking for\u2026 jus-just a few hours of not being fucking alone and miserable. But it\u2019s fine. Really Peter, go and leave me alone so I can stop acting like you care about anything other than yourself! I\u2019m the biggest fucking idiot to ever think you could care about me anymore. I\u2019m just the only person stupid enough to let you fuck them, right? That\u2019s why you came, not for any other reason. You act like you were the only person to lose my dad to that fucking war. Everyone just worried about my mom and Morgan, and I got to pick up the pieces with no one there for me! At least you had people! Even I tried to help you and what did I get for it? Absolutely no concern at all! Not even a fucking are you doing okay? And after all these years I finally had the courage to ask for something, anything to keep me from killing myself and you can\u2019t even just be honest and tell me you hate me! Face it, I know you can\u2019t stand being around me. That you\u2019re just using me. I won\u2019t make this mistake again.\u201d</p><p>You stormed off to your bedroom as he stood there, completely in shock and pain at your words.</p><p>He never wanted to hurt you. Why did he have to be this way? He followed after you, not even sure what he\u2019d say to you after that.</p><p>You could feel him following you, so instead of continuing on you whipped around on him and went for him. You shoved him, as hard as you could but he barely even took a step back.</p><p>He grabbed your wrists and pulled you into his arms. </p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d you said, struggling against him.</p><p>He only held you tighter. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you actually care,\u201d you sobbed, not even bothering to continue struggling against him.</p><p>But then his body shook against yours.</p><p>You stilled completely.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t lose you,\u201d he said quietly as he sobbed against you. \u201cPlease\u2026 believe me\u2026 I do care. I-I just don\u2019t know how to show that anymore\u2026I would stay if I could, if I could I\u2019d never leave your side, Y/N\u2026 but I\u2019m not who I used to be\u2026 and I don\u2019t expect you to accept me like this\u2026 you deserve better than me\u2026 I\u2019ve hurt you too much already.\u201d</p><p>You pulled back and forced him to look at you. \u201cPete\u2026\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you even speaking to me let alone anything more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. We\u2019ve both had things tough\u2026 we both have made mistakes\u2026 but\u2026 how about we don\u2019t let this be a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust Venom to not hurt you,\u201d he pressed his forehead to yours. </p><p>You wiped some tears from his cheeks as well as your own. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be your fault if he did and I don\u2019t believe he would or he would have done it by now, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter was quiet for a moment as if he was listening to something, you assumed it was to the symbiote. \u201cHe said you\u2019re right\u2026 but what if he\u2019s lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take,\u201d you said before pulling him towards your room.</p><p>That was the best night&rsquo;s sleep both of you had in as long as you could remember.<br/></p><p><i>Tags: Wanna be tagged?

The life where you put yourself in danger to save people. He wanted you to have every chance to change the world, but not the way he did. Not the way that brought nightmares and unease. Not the way of a superhero. Not the way of a young woman pushing herself past every breaking point.</p><p>He sacrificed everything for you, to bring you back. So that you\u2019d get to have the life he always wanted you to have.</p><p>God, you were only 16. You were too young to lose your dad. You were too young to step up the way you had. You were too young to be worrying about your little sisters future the way you did, you weren\u2019t even present for those first 5 years of her life. Your dad wanted your life to be amazing, he wanted that for Morgan too, and you\u2019d be damned sure she got to have that.</p><p>You\u2019d make sure she remembered every last good thing your father did to save the entire universe and then some.</p><p>Even if it meant that you wouldn\u2019t have that. Because when your dad told you take care of your mom and sister and that was exactly what you\u2019d do. Even through the darkness. Even through losing people you never thought you would. Even if you had to lose yourself in the process. You would do anything your dad asked you to do.</p><p>After the battle with Thanos, after everything you\u2019d been through, nothing was the same. Your mother said she told him that you\u2019d all be okay, that he could rest. You hadn\u2019t made it to them in time to say any form of goodbye. It tore you apart. How you wondered what your father would think now if he saw the people he loved.</p><p>Pepper knew nothing but work now. She loved her girls, but they were so much like him. Family was her top priority, she loved with everything she had, but you knew she took longer work trips and stayed late just so she wouldn\u2019t have to spend so much time with the two of you.</p><p>Morgan, well, she missed him everyday. She wished every single day she could have had more time with him. She wished that instead of you holding the family together the way you did wasn\u2019t how things were. But, she was grateful for all of it. She loved you with everything she had. It broke her heart seeing you the way you\u2019d become, seeing other become different too.</p><p>Every single person that Tony Stark touched was different now that he was gone.</p><p>However, you\u2019d argue there was one in particular that changed even more than you had.</p><p>You hated yourself for letting it happen. He tried so hard to reach out to you. He tried to help you when someone should have been helping him. In the end, when you pushed him away, you regretted it instantly. Your dad brought you back with everyone else that was lost to the snap. You hadn\u2019t been there with them on Titan when the snap happened. But the second the two of you found each other on the battlefield for that final fight, the two of you fell into the sync you\u2019d both grown accustomed to.</p><p>You and Peter had it, whatever it was. You always had. He cared so deeply for your father and for you. You could feel it in your bones how much he cared.</p><p>You only wished you could have been less focused on other things to notice. He was slipping and you practically stomped on his fingers. He held onto you for as long as he could. He tried being there for you and you could only manage to push him away. You\u2019d been so concerned about so many other things and people, and with how he was trying to be there for you, you hadn\u2019t realized he needed someone too. He needed you because you weren\u2019t just Tony\u2019s daughter to him.</p><p>You were so much more to him, he loved you, even at 16.</p><p>Well, now it was 6 years later and things were so much different.</p><p>Your sister was away for school, your mother was still living on the lake, and you were in the city. You kept it safe the best you could.</p><p>However, every so often he\u2019d come along, just to chat. Oh but it wasn\u2019t because he cared.</p><p>No, Peter didn\u2019t care for much of anything anymore. Only the monster that ran through his veins.</p><p>You were sat on the railing out on the towers balcony. It wasn\u2019t Avengers tower anymore, but it was once your home and you still came back every now and then. The company that bought it those many years ago went bankrupt, it was all but empty now, you bought it back and lived there, all the way at the top. You sat on the edge whenever you had bad nights, contemplating if you\u2019d really just let yourself fall this time.</p><p>The last time you had finally started your decline you were picked right out of the sky. He wouldn\u2019t talk about that night with you.</p><p>There was the soft pad of feet behind you. You didn\u2019t bother to turn around, you knew.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t catch you this time,\u201d his voice sounded deeper and frankly distorted. It was so different than it had been when the two of you were young and still light hearted.</p><p>You wiped the tears from your face as he got closer. \u201cDon\u2019t you have trouble to be getting into, Pete?\u201d You didn\u2019t look back, knowing that you would not find the sweet Peter Parker from long ago. Instead you knew you\u2019d find him donned in what looked like his Spider-Man suit, but what was actually an alien species that called itself Venom.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing here?\u201d He asked.</p><p>You could hear the smirk in his voice. \u201cGo\u2026 I\u2019m in no mood for you to tell me of all the horrible things you\u2019ve been up to, or to argue let alone fight you. We are not friends.\u201d Even though they were your own words they broke you up. You wanted nothing more than for him to stay.</p><p>A low growl was released in your ear. He was practically against your back, but he left enough space so he wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhat about being in the mood for something else?\u201d</p><p>A shiver swept down your spine. You stayed silent for a moment, you knew what he meant. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer you, but you were sure he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>You listened to the sound of Venom retracting. It was nothing like the sound of the nano tech that made up your own suit. Then a pair of lips settled against your shoulder, pulling your from your thoughts and making you pull away. You slipped off the side of the rail, quickly you tapped the arc reactor on your chest. Your all (your fave color) suit formed over your body as you fell.</p><p>As tempting as it was, you flew right back up. </p><p>\u201cCome on Y/N, you know hate sex is the best outlet.\u201d</p><p>You scoffed and shook your head. \u201cI told you. That was a mistake. One I\u2019m never making again.\u201d</p><p>Peter smirked at you, a brow arched. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d The black symbiote shot out for you, it wrapped around your waist and pulled you right into him. He tapped your arc reactor and loosened his grip on you once your suit was gone.</p><p>You looked away from him, knowing struggling against him would only make him hold you tighter.</p><p>His hand came up and stroked through your hair. His other cupped your chin and turned your head back towards him.</p><p>His eyes were so much darker than you remember. You missed the sweet brown they used to be. How bright they were. Now the darkness around them practically made them black.</p><p>Yet even through that darkness you could see it, the want he had for you.</p><p>It was undeniable. It was always there, and the first time you gave into him, you didn\u2019t regret it. You just wished the circumstances were different. But here you were, falling back into him.</p><p>He pulled you in closer and kissed you.</p><p>It happened quickly, you ended up back in the penthouse, not even making it to your room the two of you wound up on the couch.</p><p>Clothes were shed, bodies pressed together, being with Peter was pure ecstacy.</p><p>It was the only time you didn\u2019t feel alone.</p><p>The only moments where you felt something other than the pain of your past.</p><p>You laid on Peter\u2019s chest, both of you panting.</p><p>And even covered in sweat, being there like that felt right. Like nothing was ever going to be as right as you being with him.</p><p>Perhaps it was all of the pain you\u2019d been thinking about prior to all of this. Or maybe it was because deep down you knew how you felt for him. But the words slipped passed your lips so quietly and without warning.</p><p>\u201cStay with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>You could feel his body tense, you almost backpedaled but his words silenced anything that may have come to mind.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said firmly, like he was making sure not only you knew but almost as if he was trying to convince himself of the answer as well.</p><p>You tried to stop the tears that filled your eyes but they slipped to his chest before you could will them away. \u201cPlease, I-\u2026 I don\u2019t trust myself to be alone\u2026\u201d</p><p>He sat up, taking you with him. His hands held your shoulders and he forced you to look at him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t trust myself to be alone with you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it any different than this right now?\u201d You asked, timidly.</p><p>He shook his head as if you should understand exactly what he meant. He shifted you from his lap and started replacing his clothes. You followed suit and put your own back on, expecting an uncomfortable conversation to happen was not something you wanted to do naked.</p><p>He answered you once his pants were back on. \u201cThis\u2026 this is just sex, Y/N. That\u2019s how it\u2019s different. Nothing is going to come from this. It can\u2019t, I won\u2019t let it. I won\u2019t let you get hurt by us. You have no idea what I am now. What we can do and not even know it. We could kill you in your sleep and you wouldn\u2019t even see it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Pete\u2026\u201d you said it barely above a whisper. You were not one to beg but you couldn\u2019t help yourself. You needed him.</p><p>The symbiote covered his skin. The man you just gave your body to, was replaced by his monstrous other half. \u201cFind someone else if you need someone that bad. I\u2019ve hurt you enough. I won\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Rage filled your heart. If only he knew that his solution was more painful than anything else he could have done. \u201cGo.\u201d You said it with such anger in your voice he thought he just misheard you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGET OUT AND NEVER COME BACK,\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs.</p><p>Venom retracted, Peter could only look at you in utter shock.</p><p>\u201cOne night!\u201d You sobbed. \u201cThat was all I was asking for\u2026 jus-just a few hours of not being fucking alone and miserable. But it\u2019s fine. Really Peter, go and leave me alone so I can stop acting like you care about anything other than yourself! I\u2019m the biggest fucking idiot to ever think you could care about me anymore. I\u2019m just the only person stupid enough to let you fuck them, right?

Face it, I know you can\u2019t stand being around me. That you\u2019re just using me. I won\u2019t make this mistake again.\u201d</p><p>You stormed off to your bedroom as he stood there, completely in shock and pain at your words.</p><p>He never wanted to hurt you.

We\u2019ve both had things tough\u2026 we both have made mistakes\u2026 but\u2026 how about we don\u2019t let this be a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust Venom to not hurt you,\u201d he pressed his forehead to yours. </p><p>You wiped some tears from his cheeks as well as your own. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be your fault if he did and I don\u2019t believe he would or he would have done it by now, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter was quiet for a moment as if he was listening to something, you assumed it was to the symbiote. \u201cHe said you\u2019re right\u2026 but what if he\u2019s lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take,\u201d you said before pulling him towards your room.</p><p>That was the best night\u2019s sleep both of you had in as long as you could remember.<br></p><p><i>Tags: Wanna be tagged?

The life where you put yourself in danger to save people. He wanted you to have every chance to change the world, but not the way he did. Not the way that brought nightmares and unease. Not the way of a superhero. Not the way of a young woman pushing herself past every breaking point.</p><p>He sacrificed everything for you, to bring you back. So that you\u2019d get to have the life he always wanted you to have.</p><p>God, you were only 16. You were too young to lose your dad. You were too young to step up the way you had. You were too young to be worrying about your little sisters future the way you did, you weren\u2019t even present for those first 5 years of her life. Your dad wanted your life to be amazing, he wanted that for Morgan too, and you\u2019d be damned sure she got to have that.</p><p>You\u2019d make sure she remembered every last good thing your father did to save the entire universe and then some.</p><p>Even if it meant that you wouldn\u2019t have that. Because when your dad told you take care of your mom and sister and that was exactly what you\u2019d do. Even through the darkness. Even through losing people you never thought you would. Even if you had to lose yourself in the process. You would do anything your dad asked you to do.</p><p>After the battle with Thanos, after everything you\u2019d been through, nothing was the same. Your mother said she told him that you\u2019d all be okay, that he could rest. You hadn\u2019t made it to them in time to say any form of goodbye. It tore you apart. How you wondered what your father would think now if he saw the people he loved.</p><p>Pepper knew nothing but work now. She loved her girls, but they were so much like him. Family was her top priority, she loved with everything she had, but you knew she took longer work trips and stayed late just so she wouldn\u2019t have to spend so much time with the two of you.</p><p>Morgan, well, she missed him everyday. She wished every single day she could have had more time with him. She wished that instead of you holding the family together the way you did wasn\u2019t how things were. But, she was grateful for all of it. She loved you with everything she had. It broke her heart seeing you the way you\u2019d become, seeing other become different too.</p><p>Every single person that Tony Stark touched was different now that he was gone.</p><p>However, you\u2019d argue there was one in particular that changed even more than you had.</p><p>You hated yourself for letting it happen. He tried so hard to reach out to you. He tried to help you when someone should have been helping him. In the end, when you pushed him away, you regretted it instantly. Your dad brought you back with everyone else that was lost to the snap. You hadn\u2019t been there with them on Titan when the snap happened. But the second the two of you found each other on the battlefield for that final fight, the two of you fell into the sync you\u2019d both grown accustomed to.</p><p>You and Peter had it, whatever it was. You always had. He cared so deeply for your father and for you. You could feel it in your bones how much he cared.</p><p>You only wished you could have been less focused on other things to notice. He was slipping and you practically stomped on his fingers. He held onto you for as long as he could. He tried being there for you and you could only manage to push him away. You\u2019d been so concerned about so many other things and people, and with how he was trying to be there for you, you hadn\u2019t realized he needed someone too. He needed you because you weren\u2019t just Tony\u2019s daughter to him.</p><p>You were so much more to him, he loved you, even at 16.</p><p>Well, now it was 6 years later and things were so much different.</p><p>Your sister was away for school, your mother was still living on the lake, and you were in the city. You kept it safe the best you could.</p><p>However, every so often he\u2019d come along, just to chat. Oh but it wasn\u2019t because he cared.</p><p>No, Peter didn\u2019t care for much of anything anymore. Only the monster that ran through his veins.</p><p>You were sat on the railing out on the towers balcony. It wasn\u2019t Avengers tower anymore, but it was once your home and you still came back every now and then. The company that bought it those many years ago went bankrupt, it was all but empty now, you bought it back and lived there, all the way at the top. You sat on the edge whenever you had bad nights, contemplating if you\u2019d really just let yourself fall this time.</p><p>The last time you had finally started your decline you were picked right out of the sky. He wouldn\u2019t talk about that night with you.</p><p>There was the soft pad of feet behind you. You didn\u2019t bother to turn around, you knew.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t catch you this time,\u201d his voice sounded deeper and frankly distorted. It was so different than it had been when the two of you were young and still light hearted.</p><p>You wiped the tears from your face as he got closer. \u201cDon\u2019t you have trouble to be getting into, Pete?\u201d You didn\u2019t look back, knowing that you would not find the sweet Peter Parker from long ago. Instead you knew you\u2019d find him donned in what looked like his Spider-Man suit, but what was actually an alien species that called itself Venom.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing here?\u201d He asked.</p><p>You could hear the smirk in his voice. \u201cGo\u2026 I\u2019m in no mood for you to tell me of all the horrible things you\u2019ve been up to, or to argue let alone fight you. We are not friends.\u201d Even though they were your own words they broke you up. You wanted nothing more than for him to stay.</p><p>A low growl was released in your ear. He was practically against your back, but he left enough space so he wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhat about being in the mood for something else?\u201d</p><p>A shiver swept down your spine. You stayed silent for a moment, you knew what he meant. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer you, but you were sure he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>You listened to the sound of Venom retracting. It was nothing like the sound of the nano tech that made up your own suit. Then a pair of lips settled against your shoulder, pulling your from your thoughts and making you pull away. You slipped off the side of the rail, quickly you tapped the arc reactor on your chest. Your all (your fave color) suit formed over your body as you fell.</p><p>As tempting as it was, you flew right back up. </p><p>\u201cCome on Y/N, you know hate sex is the best outlet.\u201d</p><p>You scoffed and shook your head. \u201cI told you. That was a mistake. One I\u2019m never making again.\u201d</p><p>Peter smirked at you, a brow arched. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d The black symbiote shot out for you, it wrapped around your waist and pulled you right into him. He tapped your arc reactor and loosened his grip on you once your suit was gone.</p><p>You looked away from him, knowing struggling against him would only make him hold you tighter.</p><p>His hand came up and stroked through your hair. His other cupped your chin and turned your head back towards him.</p><p>His eyes were so much darker than you remember. You missed the sweet brown they used to be. How bright they were. Now the darkness around them practically made them black.</p><p>Yet even through that darkness you could see it, the want he had for you.</p><p>It was undeniable. It was always there, and the first time you gave into him, you didn\u2019t regret it. You just wished the circumstances were different. But here you were, falling back into him.</p><p>He pulled you in closer and kissed you.</p><p>It happened quickly, you ended up back in the penthouse, not even making it to your room the two of you wound up on the couch.</p><p>Clothes were shed, bodies pressed together, being with Peter was pure ecstacy.</p><p>It was the only time you didn\u2019t feel alone.</p><p>The only moments where you felt something other than the pain of your past.</p><p>You laid on Peter\u2019s chest, both of you panting.</p><p>And even covered in sweat, being there like that felt right. Like nothing was ever going to be as right as you being with him.</p><p>Perhaps it was all of the pain you\u2019d been thinking about prior to all of this. Or maybe it was because deep down you knew how you felt for him. But the words slipped passed your lips so quietly and without warning.</p><p>\u201cStay with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>You could feel his body tense, you almost backpedaled but his words silenced anything that may have come to mind.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said firmly, like he was making sure not only you knew but almost as if he was trying to convince himself of the answer as well.</p><p>You tried to stop the tears that filled your eyes but they slipped to his chest before you could will them away. \u201cPlease, I-\u2026 I don\u2019t trust myself to be alone\u2026\u201d</p><p>He sat up, taking you with him. His hands held your shoulders and he forced you to look at him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t trust myself to be alone with you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it any different than this right now?\u201d You asked, timidly.</p><p>He shook his head as if you should understand exactly what he meant. He shifted you from his lap and started replacing his clothes. You followed suit and put your own back on, expecting an uncomfortable conversation to happen was not something you wanted to do naked.</p><p>He answered you once his pants were back on. \u201cThis\u2026 this is just sex, Y/N. That\u2019s how it\u2019s different. Nothing is going to come from this. It can\u2019t, I won\u2019t let it. I won\u2019t let you get hurt by us. You have no idea what I am now. What we can do and not even know it. We could kill you in your sleep and you wouldn\u2019t even see it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Pete\u2026\u201d you said it barely above a whisper. You were not one to beg but you couldn\u2019t help yourself. You needed him.</p><p>The symbiote covered his skin. The man you just gave your body to, was replaced by his monstrous other half. \u201cFind someone else if you need someone that bad. I\u2019ve hurt you enough. I won\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Rage filled your heart. If only he knew that his solution was more painful than anything else he could have done. \u201cGo.\u201d You said it with such anger in your voice he thought he just misheard you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGET OUT AND NEVER COME BACK,\u201d you screamed at the top of your lungs.</p><p>Venom retracted, Peter could only look at you in utter shock.</p><p>\u201cOne night!\u201d You sobbed. \u201cThat was all I was asking for\u2026 jus-just a few hours of not being fucking alone and miserable. But it\u2019s fine. Really Peter, go and leave me alone so I can stop acting like you care about anything other than yourself! I\u2019m the biggest fucking idiot to ever think you could care about me anymore. I\u2019m just the only person stupid enough to let you fuck them, right? That\u2019s why you came, not for any other reason. You act like you were the only person to lose my dad to that fucking war. Everyone just worried about my mom and Morgan, and I got to pick up the pieces with no one there for me! At least you had people! Even I tried to help you and what did I get for it? Absolutely no concern at all! Not even a fucking are you doing okay? And after all these years I finally had the courage to ask for something, anything to keep me from killing myself and you can\u2019t even just be honest and tell me you hate me! Face it, I know you can\u2019t stand being around me. That you\u2019re just using me. I won\u2019t make this mistake again.\u201d</p><p>You stormed off to your bedroom as he stood there, completely in shock and pain at your words.</p><p>He never wanted to hurt you. Why did he have to be this way? He followed after you, not even sure what he\u2019d say to you after that.</p><p>You could feel him following you, so instead of continuing on you whipped around on him and went for him. You shoved him, as hard as you could but he barely even took a step back.</p><p>He grabbed your wrists and pulled you into his arms. </p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d you said, struggling against him.</p><p>He only held you tighter. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you actually care,\u201d you sobbed, not even bothering to continue struggling against him.</p><p>But then his body shook against yours.</p><p>You stilled completely.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t lose you,\u201d he said quietly as he sobbed against you. \u201cPlease\u2026 believe me\u2026 I do care. I-I just don\u2019t know how to show that anymore\u2026I would stay if I could, if I could I\u2019d never leave your side, Y/N\u2026 but I\u2019m not who I used to be\u2026 and I don\u2019t expect you to accept me like this\u2026 you deserve better than me\u2026 I\u2019ve hurt you too much already.\u201d</p><p>You pulled back and forced him to look at you. \u201cPete\u2026\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you even speaking to me let alone anything more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. We\u2019ve both had things tough\u2026 we both have made mistakes\u2026 but\u2026 how about we don\u2019t let this be a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust Venom to not hurt you,\u201d he pressed his forehead to yours. </p><p>You wiped some tears from his cheeks as well as your own. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be your fault if he did and I don\u2019t believe he would or he would have done it by now, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter was quiet for a moment as if he was listening to something, you assumed it was to the symbiote. \u201cHe said you\u2019re right\u2026 but what if he\u2019s lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take,\u201d you said before pulling him towards your room.</p><p>That was the best night\u2019s sleep both of you had in as long as you could remember.<br></p><p><i>Tags: Wanna be tagged?

That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s different. Nothing is going to come from this. It can&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t let it. I won&rsquo;t let you get hurt by us. You have no idea what I am now. What we can do and not even know it. We could kill you in your sleep and you wouldn&rsquo;t even see it coming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Pete&hellip;&rdquo; you said it barely above a whisper. You were not one to beg but you couldn&rsquo;t help yourself. You needed him.</p><p>The symbiote covered his skin. The man you just gave your body to, was replaced by his monstrous other half. &ldquo;Find someone else if you need someone that bad. I&rsquo;ve hurt you enough. I won&rsquo;t do it anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Rage filled your heart. If only he knew that his solution was more painful than anything else he could have done. &ldquo;Go.&rdquo; You said it with such anger in your voice he thought he just misheard you.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;GET OUT AND NEVER COME BACK,&rdquo; you screamed at the top of your lungs.</p><p>Venom retracted, Peter could only look at you in utter shock.</p><p>&ldquo;One night!&rdquo; You sobbed. &ldquo;That was all I was asking for&hellip; jus-just a few hours of not being fucking alone and miserable. But it&rsquo;s fine. Really Peter, go and leave me alone so I can stop acting like you care about anything other than yourself! I&rsquo;m the biggest fucking idiot to ever think you could care about me anymore. I&rsquo;m just the only person stupid enough to let you fuck them, right? That&rsquo;s why you came, not for any other reason. You act like you were the only person to lose my dad to that fucking war. Everyone just worried about my mom and Morgan, and I got to pick up the pieces with no one there for me! At least you had people! Even I tried to help you and what did I get for it? Absolutely no concern at all! Not even a fucking are you doing okay? And after all these years I finally had the courage to ask for something, anything to keep me from killing myself and you can&rsquo;t even just be honest and tell me you hate me! Face it, I know you can&rsquo;t stand being around me. That you&rsquo;re just using me. I won&rsquo;t make this mistake again.&rdquo;</p><p>You stormed off to your bedroom as he stood there, completely in shock and pain at your words.</p><p>He never wanted to hurt you. Why did he have to be this way? He followed after you, not even sure what he&rsquo;d say to you after that.</p><p>You could feel him following you, so instead of continuing on you whipped around on him and went for him. You shoved him, as hard as you could but he barely even took a step back.</p><p>He grabbed your wrists and pulled you into his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Let go,&rdquo; you said, struggling against him.</p><p>He only held you tighter. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pretend you actually care,&rdquo; you sobbed, not even bothering to continue struggling against him.</p><p>But then his body shook against yours.</p><p>You stilled completely.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t lose you,&rdquo; he said quietly as he sobbed against you. &ldquo;Please&hellip; believe me&hellip; I do care. I-I just don&rsquo;t know how to show that anymore&hellip;I would stay if I could, if I could I&rsquo;d never leave your side, Y/N&hellip; but I&rsquo;m not who I used to be&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t expect you to accept me like this&hellip; you deserve better than me&hellip; I&rsquo;ve hurt you too much already.&rdquo;</p><p>You pulled back and forced him to look at you. &ldquo;Pete&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve you even speaking to me let alone anything more than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you do. We&rsquo;ve both had things tough&hellip; we both have made mistakes&hellip; but&hellip; how about we don&rsquo;t let this be a mistake?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust Venom to not hurt you,&rdquo; he pressed his forehead to yours. </p><p>You wiped some tears from his cheeks as well as your own. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be your fault if he did and I don&rsquo;t believe he would or he would have done it by now, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was quiet for a moment as if he was listening to something, you assumed it was to the symbiote. &ldquo;He said you&rsquo;re right&hellip; but what if he&rsquo;s lying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a risk I&rsquo;m willing to take,&rdquo; you said before pulling him towards your room.</p><p>That was the best night&rsquo;s sleep both of you had in as long as you could remember.<br /></p><p><i>Tags: Wanna be tagged?
