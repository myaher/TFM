That\u2019s why I love Arya so much I was a tomboy when I was little and I was never good at girly stuff",

I hope those guys don&rsquo;t claim to be asoiaf fans because the author deserves a better fandom than this. </p>\n\n<p><br/>\nI don&rsquo;t think that asoiaf series falling into the fantasy genre stops the characters from being retalable. Yes, they experience some extraordinary situations that don&rsquo;t happen on the real world but on the same time their feelings, their hopes and fears are so painfully human. I could see myself in a lot of them while I was reading their point of view and I&rsquo;ve never encounter a dragon or lived in a medieval society.</p>\n\n<p><br/>\nMoving on to Sansa, I don&rsquo;t think that the people who find her flawless and retalable at the same time fully gasp her pesponality. I&rsquo;d say that their reading on her is superficial. Sansa like the rest of the asoiaf cast has her fair amount of flaws and that makes her a realistic character, someone people can relate to.</p>\n\n<p><br/>\nFinally, in my humble opinion Arya is one of the most retalable characters on the book. Unlike Arya or you, anon, I was never tomboy and still I can relate to Arya and the struggles she faces on her narrow minded society so much. Because I was also once a little girl that did things that society didn&rsquo;t deem proper for girls, because I have been also critized for any feature straying from the &ldquo;ideal beauty&rdquo; to the point questioning my own worth and I have been also worrying that maybe as was not performing womanhood right before I realised that there is no right way to be a woman&ndash; all you have to do is be yourself.</p>",

Third time\u2019s the charm! <br/><br/></li></ul><li>Robert and Lyanna are a lot like Gendry and Arya, both in looks and some of their major personality traits.\u00a0\u00a0 And we see they have similar relationships to Ned and Jon respectively. See how much Robert and Ned\u2019s first scene parallels Gendry and Jon\u2019s meeting- these first serious and solemn-looking exchanges end in smiles and good natured ribbing. Jon and Arya are especially close, just like Ned and Lyanna were. Also, Lyanna\u2019s introduction\u2014 showing off her horseback riding in front of her brothers\u2014 feels similar to Arya shooting an arrow into Bran\u2019s target in the pilot episode.\u00a0 But Robert and Lyanna didn\u2019t know each other very well, unlike Arya and Gendry who were friends and companions for a long time. Not to mention that Gendry and Arya are much better people than Robert and Lyanna. Gendry is not a drunken philanderer and Arya isn\u2019t as thoughtless (and selfish?) as Lyanna.<br/><br/></li><li>Compare Arya\u2019s first meeting with Hot Pie in season 1 to their final goodbye in season 7. In season 1, they met just after Arya lost her family. She was already devastated when Hot Pie insulted her and tried to intimidate her. Arya threatened him and it was one of the first times we see the depths of her fierceness. In season 7, Arya finds Hot Pie just after she avenged her family. She\u2019s already feeling pretty happy(ish) when Hot Pie tells her that Jon has Winterfell, that she\u2019s pretty and calls her his friend. It is the first time in awhile we see her heart and emotions absolutely unguarded.\u00a0 Hot Pie and Arya\u2019s reunion highlights how he went from her bully to her friend, from kicking her while she was already down to giving her the best news she had heard in years when she was as happy as she ever expected to be again. So Arya and Gendry reuniting ought to show us how much their relationship has changed too; from friends to something more. <br/><br/></li><li>So far, very few reunion scenes have featured both<i> </i>characters being taken by surprise. Sansa went looking for Jon. Bran knew when he\u2019d see his siblings. Arya probably hoped to see Hot Pie at that inn. Davos tracked down Gendry.

We\u2019ll join our houses.\u201d <br></li><ul><li>They have tried to marry a Stark girl with a Baratheon twice now. Robert and Lyanna. Joffrey and Sansa. Third time\u2019s the charm! <br><br></li></ul><li>Robert and Lyanna are a lot like Gendry and Arya, both in looks and some of their major personality traits.\u00a0\u00a0 And we see they have similar relationships to Ned and Jon respectively. See how much Robert and Ned\u2019s first scene parallels Gendry and Jon\u2019s meeting- these first serious and solemn-looking exchanges end in smiles and good natured ribbing. Jon and Arya are especially close, just like Ned and Lyanna were. Also, Lyanna\u2019s introduction\u2014 showing off her horseback riding in front of her brothers\u2014 feels similar to Arya shooting an arrow into Bran\u2019s target in the pilot episode.\u00a0 But Robert and Lyanna didn\u2019t know each other very well, unlike Arya and Gendry who were friends and companions for a long time. Not to mention that Gendry and Arya are much better people than Robert and Lyanna. Gendry is not a drunken philanderer and Arya isn\u2019t as thoughtless (and selfish?) as Lyanna.<br><br></li><li>Compare Arya\u2019s first meeting with Hot Pie in season 1 to their final goodbye in season 7. In season 1, they met just after Arya lost her family. She was already devastated when Hot Pie insulted her and tried to intimidate her. Arya threatened him and it was one of the first times we see the depths of her fierceness. In season 7, Arya finds Hot Pie just after she avenged her family. She\u2019s already feeling pretty happy(ish) when Hot Pie tells her that Jon has Winterfell, that she\u2019s pretty and calls her his friend. It is the first time in awhile we see her heart and emotions absolutely unguarded.\u00a0 Hot Pie and Arya\u2019s reunion highlights how he went from her bully to her friend, from kicking her while she was already down to giving her the best news she had heard in years when she was as happy as she ever expected to be again. So Arya and Gendry reuniting ought to show us how much their relationship has changed too; from friends to something more. <br><br></li><li>So far, very few reunion scenes have featured both<i> </i>characters being taken by surprise. Sansa went looking for Jon. Bran knew when he\u2019d see his siblings. Arya probably hoped to see Hot Pie at that inn. Davos tracked down Gendry. The guards told Arya that Sansa was at Winterfell and they told Sansa that Arya was there. Arya learned from Sansa that Bran was home. Jon knows that Bran and Arya are at Winterfell. Sandor knows that Arya survived. So I think it\u2019s <i>very </i>interesting that at this point, <i>both</i> Arya and Gendry are completely unaware that the other is still alive.

It\u2019s not their literal goodbye scene, but it figuratively is. The audience learns that they will soon be parting ways and it<i> is</i> the last time they really speak to each other on screen. Obviously, since their actual separation would be caused by Mel dragging him away, they wouldn\u2019t get an actual, proper goodbye.

We learn in season 6 that Arya wants to travel the world and see what\u2019s west of Westeros. In season 7, we see that Nymeria has formed her own pack and is forging her own, unconventional path. Clearly, Arya is heading to a similar lifestyle. She is not a lone wolf, however, and she\u2019s going to want someone to go with her. Jon, Sansa, and Bran couldn\u2019t accompany her even if they wanted to. Hot Pie is happy where he is. Sandor is probably going to be 100% done with road trips. If Brienne isn\u2019t too busy with Jaime (let me have my <strike>delusions</strike> dreams), she\u2019ll probably feel more obligated to stay with Sansa. That pretty much leaves Gendry.

                "content": "<p><p><b>&nbsp;Reasons to be Hopeful for Gendrya season 8:</b></p><ul><li>&ldquo;I have a son. You have a daughter. We&rsquo;ll join our houses.&rdquo; <br /></li><ul><li>They have tried to marry a Stark girl with a Baratheon twice now. Robert and Lyanna. Joffrey and Sansa. Third time&rsquo;s the charm! <br /><br /></li></ul><li>Robert and Lyanna are a lot like Gendry and Arya, both in looks and some of their major personality traits.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we see they have similar relationships to Ned and Jon respectively. See how much Robert and Ned&rsquo;s first scene parallels Gendry and Jon&rsquo;s meeting- these first serious and solemn-looking exchanges end in smiles and good natured ribbing. Jon and Arya are especially close, just like Ned and Lyanna were. Also, Lyanna&rsquo;s introduction&mdash; showing off her horseback riding in front of her brothers&mdash; feels similar to Arya shooting an arrow into Bran&rsquo;s target in the pilot episode.&nbsp; But Robert and Lyanna didn&rsquo;t know each other very well, unlike Arya and Gendry who were friends and companions for a long time. Not to mention that Gendry and Arya are much better people than Robert and Lyanna. Gendry is not a drunken philanderer and Arya isn&rsquo;t as thoughtless (and selfish?) as Lyanna.<br /><br /></li><li>Compare Arya&rsquo;s first meeting with Hot Pie in season 1 to their final goodbye in season 7. In season 1, they met just after Arya lost her family. She was already devastated when Hot Pie insulted her and tried to intimidate her. Arya threatened him and it was one of the first times we see the depths of her fierceness. In season 7, Arya finds Hot Pie just after she avenged her family. She&rsquo;s already feeling pretty happy(ish) when Hot Pie tells her that Jon has Winterfell, that she&rsquo;s pretty and calls her his friend. It is the first time in awhile we see her heart and emotions absolutely unguarded.&nbsp; Hot Pie and Arya&rsquo;s reunion highlights how he went from her bully to her friend, from kicking her while she was already down to giving her the best news she had heard in years when she was as happy as she ever expected to be again. So Arya and Gendry reuniting ought to show us how much their relationship has changed too; from friends to something more. <br /><br /></li><li>So far, very few reunion scenes have featured both<i> </i>characters being taken by surprise. Sansa went looking for Jon. Bran knew when he&rsquo;d see his siblings. Arya probably hoped to see Hot Pie at that inn. Davos tracked down Gendry. The guards told Arya that Sansa was at Winterfell and they told Sansa that Arya was there. Arya learned from Sansa that Bran was home. Jon knows that Bran and Arya are at Winterfell. Sandor knows that Arya survived. So I think it&rsquo;s <i>very </i>interesting that at this point, <i>both</i> Arya and Gendry are completely unaware that the other is still alive. I think it&rsquo;s intentional so that it can be one of the few reunions where it&rsquo;s a complete surprise to both of them. <br /><br /></li><li>Just generally speaking, they were as heavy-handed with shippiness as they could get away with in seasons 1- 3 considering the age difference.They had a hard line to walk between &ldquo;planting the seeds&rdquo; of a future relationship and not making Gendry look creepy and I think they handled well:</li><ul><li>Their first meeting is a classic &ldquo;meet cute,&rdquo; especially among kids and/or in adventure stories, where A defends B from danger or harassment.&nbsp; <br /><br /></li><li>Gendry realized Arya was a girl pretty quickly or maybe even immediately. In the books, it&rsquo;s only after their little group is on their own for awhile that he notices she goes far away to pee. I know a factor might be simplifying things because of time constraints. But I think it&rsquo;s worth noting that in these situations, the love interest will often see through the disguise. It also gets bonus points because even with long hair, Arya had been frequently mistaken for a boy.<br /><br /></li><li>&ldquo;As my lady commands&rdquo; can be seen as having a similar vibe as Robb and Theon laughing hysterically after Arya throws some food at Sansa. But it definitely can be seen a flirting&ndash; if in a &ldquo;kids in the school yard&rdquo; kind of way. <br /><br /></li><li>She ogles him blatantly while he is shirtless. Growing up with lots of brothers and their friends and swimming with them and stuff&hellip;. it&rsquo;s not like male anatomy is a mystery to her. It&rsquo;s basically a big flashing sign telling the audience that Arya does <i>not</i> see Gendry as some kind of big brother replacement.\n\n<br /><br /></li><li>When they leave \nHarrenhal, it&rsquo;s clear that Gendry doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s safe to do so. But Arya goes and he follows rather quickly. Either he <i>really </i>trusts her judgement or he&rsquo;s willing to die with her.&nbsp;\n\n<br /><br /></li><li>We often see them exchanging meaningful looks and/or practically reading each other&rsquo;s minds. When they hear that lady talk about how they&rsquo;re all slowly being tortured and killed in Harrenhal. When the Mountain picks Gendry to be rat food. How Gendry checks with her before he tells Thoros the blacksmith he used to train with. When they say goodbye to Hot Pie and he gives them that misshapen wolf bread. Or when Arya tries to stab the Hound, Gendry stops her when the rest of the Brotherhood is still dumbstruck. I almost always only see that kind of non-verbal communication in characters that are siblings (twins more specifically) or a couple.&nbsp; <br /><br /></li><li>They get a pretty long one-on-one farewell. This show is not big on goodbye scenes. Most are off screen and if not, tend to be rather brief and the characters have to have a stiff upper lip because there are other people around or because they can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t open up. But the scene where Gendry tells Arya that he wants to stay with the Brotherhood is <i>very </i>emotional and both of them get a bit teary-eyed. It&rsquo;s not their literal goodbye scene, but it figuratively is. The audience learns that they will soon be parting ways and it<i> is</i> the last time they really speak to each other on screen.
