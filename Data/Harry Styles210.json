I wasn\u2019t sure where I was, sky was roaring and rain was falling down on me. I\u2019m not sure how I get here, all I remember was feeling so suffocated that I needed some air but now looking around the unfamiliar neighborhood in darkness makes chills through my bones. How long was outside?</p><p><br/></p><p>A man with suit on was passing , actually he\u2019s the only person I see around the street \u201csorry sir\u201d I call out for him, he comes to a jolt looking around until he spot me on another side of street ,soaking and shaking \u201ccan I use your phone? I need to call my boyfriend, I\u2019ll pay for the call when he gets here\u201d I hadn\u2019t anything with me, not even a cent in my pocket. </p><p>He hesitated a little, I mean if it was me I was running miles away, how can you be sure I\u2019m not some robs or some mad woman?</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cPlease , just a few seconds\u201d I plead , tears gather in my eyes. I was scared, how could I not be ? </p><p>\u201cHere\u201d he hand me his iPhone after unlocked it. \u201cThank you so much\u201d I dialed Harry\u2019s number as soon as my fingers can , with second ring I heard his voice, kind of ruth, like he was yelling for the past hours. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d If I was holding my tears at bay, I couldn\u2019t anymore, my sobs came out sooner than any word \u201charry\u201d I kind of plead his name. Like I want him to appear in front of me, I was scared. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh y/n sweetheart, where are you? I\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere\u201d he said kind of pleading as well. I need him to find me and he needs to find me as well. </p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, I-I &hellip;. t-this m-man\u2019s phone &hellip; I-I \u201c I couldn\u2019t even understand my self \u201cit\u2019s ok, take a breath and stand just where you are, did you borrowed someone\u2019s phone?\u201d He asked trying to stay calm for my sake. </p><p>\u201cYes\u201d it\u2019s all I could get out of my lips \u201cok , gave him the phone please, I\u2019ll be there in minutes sweetheart\u201d I nod , however he can\u2019t see me. </p><p>I gave the man the phone , he hesitantly puts it on his ear, the rest I wasn\u2019t giving attention, looking around holding my arms around me. </p><p>The man puts his umbrella over my head, when I look up he was over with talking to harry, is he gonna come?

Still not quite used to actually writing smut but anyways here ya go* </p><p>A small bump in the road jolts you awake, and you can\u2019t help but smile a little bit as you glance over at Harry in the driver\u2019s seat of the car. The two of you have just gotten back into London from staying at Anne\u2019s house last night in order to spend Christmas Day with her, Gemma, and the rest of Harry\u2019s family. </p><p>Your boyfriend slowly glances over at you, and smiles lightly. \u201cTired, petal?\u201d He asks as he reaches over to give your knee a squeeze. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean t\u2019wake yeh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm not so much anymore,\u201d you tell him, and move your gaze to look out the window; realizing he\u2019s taking a different way home than usual. \u201cAnd no worries, but where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, um, just need to pick up something,\u201d he states awkwardly, and tries to avoid your questioning gaze. </p><p>\u201cHarry it\u2019s Christmas, barely anything is open,\u201d you explain. \u201cWhat could you possibly need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, erm\u2026 Condoms,\u201d he mutters so quietly, you\u2019re unsure if you heard him correctly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d You ask with a chuckle. </p><p>\u201c<i>Condoms</i>,\u201d he replies a bit louder, and his face instantly reddens as you start laughing more. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out of your way on <i>Christmas</i> to get condoms?\u201d You joke, and he just glances at you disapprovingly. \u201cOh Harry, you couldn\u2019t just wait one more day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell after what you pulled last night, no. I can\u2019t,\u201d he pouts, referring to what happened while the two of you were at Anne\u2019s house. \u201cA bit unfair, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most unfair,\u201d you tell him with a smirk, and reach over to put a hand on his cheek; just as he pulls into the parking lot of a small pharmacy; it\u2019s open sign faintly blinking in the snowy weather. He puts the car in park, and looks over to you; as if expecting some sort of sinde comment, but you don\u2019t. \u201cWell, get a move on then. It\u2019s cold. And I did promise I\u2019d make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he says with a wide smile as he leans over for a kiss, before exiting out of the car and making way to the store; trying not to slip on the snow covered ground as he goes. </p><p>A few minutes pass, and he soon emerges from the store holding a bag of things; obviously he didn\u2019t want to go in there <i>just</i> for condoms. You can\u2019t help but chuckle as he walks towards the car, and he gives you a knowing look. He shakes his head at you for laughing at him, until suddenly he slips on some of the snow covered ice, and falls to the cold ground; all of the items in the bag sprawling around him as he does so. </p><p>He lays there motionless for a second, and a panicky feeling takes over while you open the door to climb out of the Range Rover. \u201cOh my god, Harry, are you ok?\u201d You ask worriedly as you shuffle towards him as fast as you can. </p><p>\u201cPhysically I\u2019m fine,\u201d he groans, and leans onto his elbows so he can a better look at you. \u201cEmotionally-.\u201d</p><p>He goes to complete his sentence but is cut off by a screech coming from you, as you step onto a similar icy patch, and fall back onto your ass. You sit there staring at each other for a moment until he starts bursting out laughing, and stands up to come over and help you. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m bruised,\u201d you finish for him with a pout. </p><p>The look of pure amusement that\u2019s on his face as he walks towards you, causes a similar look to form on your features when he sticks his hand out to help pull you back up. With a playful smirk; you take his hand, and yank on it so he\u2019ll fall back down to the ground beside you. </p><p>He falls face first into the snow, and now it\u2019s your turn to laugh as he wipes the snow off his face; turning to glare at you. \u201cThink you\u2019re funny?\u201d He asks, and shakes his hair free of the snowflakes that resided in his curls. </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d you squeak, and try to compose yourself\u2026 but it only results in you laughing even more. He let\u2019s you laugh for a moment as he subtly forms a snowball in his hands, and tosses it at your shoulder when you\u2019re least expecting; causing you to gasp loudly. \u201cHarry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry\u2026 but not really,\u201d he shrugs with a smug grin, and you scowl. You move to make a snowball of your own, preparing to throw it at him as he looks back at you with wide eyes. \u201cY/N, don\u2019t. Let\u2019s just go to the car like the adults we both are, and go home\u2026 No more snowballs.\u201d</p><p>You move your gaze from him to the ball of snow that slowly starts melting in your hold, and agree with his words. A sigh of relief escapes his mouth as you begin lowering your hand, and snap your gaze back to him; changing your mind. \u201cNah,\u201d you tell him, and launch the snowball right at his face. </p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s it,\u201d he growls and lunges at you; tackling you to the ground, but rolling so that you land on top of him as his back meets the cold ground again, and he starts pinching your sides. \u201cNot so tough now, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-harry stop,\u201d you whine as you squirm in his hold, but he refuses to let go. Chuckles ripple through him as you continue to struggle, and he rolls the two of you over so he can get a better look at your pouting face. </p><p>\u201cAwe is someone upset they\u2019re loosing?\u201d He taunts as the pinching comes to a stop, and he leans down to press a sweet kiss against your lips. You moan against his lips, and grab a fist full of his jacket so he can be even closer. He breaks away slightly, and takes a breath before his eyes bore into yours. \u201cDon\u2019t do that petal, you know what that does to me.\u201d</p><p>You smirk; knowing he was referring to your moaning, and start sliding your hands around his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s a method to my madness,\u201d You tell him, and pull him down for another kiss. </p><p>The kiss becomes heated as he lays your back gently against the ground, and presses his lips harder to yours; not giving you the option to deny his tongue as it makes way into your mouth\u2026 not like you were wanting to do that anyways. His hold on you tightens, and an idea springs to your mind as you feel his hardening bulge rub against your leg. Your hand slowly makes it\u2019s way down and starts palming his dick through his pants, causing a moan to escape from his mouth this time. </p><p>\u201cYou play dirty,\u201d he mumbles against your lips, and you just chuckle in response before he kisses you again; not stopping the hold you have on him. He\u2019s quick to pull away again though, and your eyes instantly lock with his enticing green ones. \u201c<b>Are you sure you wanna do this?</b> Because if we start, there\u2019s no stopping until it\u2019s all over, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we better get home than cause we\u2019re <i>not</i> doing this in a parking lot\u2026 or in the snow for that matter,\u201d you state as you place a quick peck onto his lips before breaking free from his hold, and standing back up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m getting snubbed again,\u201d he mumbles as he stands up, and the two of you move to pick up the items that have been laying on the ground for the past few minutes. \u201cWhen we get home, Y/N\u2026 <b>I\u2019ll have you up against the wall in a second.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Harry,\u201d you tell him firmly as you toss the box of condoms to him, and he rolls his eyes as he catches it. \u201cAnd is that a threat, or a promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen for interpretation,\u201d he huffs, and pulls the car keys out from his pocket; sulking as you\u2019s climb in and head on home. </p><p>The whole drive home consists of you teasing you boyfriend, as he scowls; and you\u2019s trying your best not to freeze from the wet clothes you\u2019re wearing. A loud sigh of relief leaves Harry\u2019s mouth as he turns onto a street and the townhouse the two of you share comes into view, causing you to smirk yet again. Once he pulls into the driveway, and puts the car in park; he turns to face you, giving you a certain, suggestive <i>look</i>.</p><p>Knowing what he was doing; you just send him a wink and stay silent as you climb out of the vehicle, and make your way up the stairs towards the front door. You take your set of keys out of your purse, and use them to unlock the door as Harry slowly comes up the stairs behind you. </p><p>Inside, you toss your keys onto the small table that resides in the hallway by the stairs as Harry closes and locks the door behind him, slowly turning to face you. A smug grin returns to your mouth as you wriggle your eyebrows at him teasingly, and move to take off your coat and boots. Just as you finish hanging your coat up, you turn around and are met by Harry\u2019s lips attacking yours, as he pushes you up against the wall; keeping true to his words. You respond instantly by moving to help with removing his coat, and tangling your hands into his curls as the piece of clothing falls to the ground. </p><p>\u201cEager?\u201d You ask teasingly, and he just pulls you in for another kiss. </p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he replies huskily, and starts placing kisses down your neck; nipping, and sucking as he goes. <b>\u201cWanna take this to the bed? Or the table, bench, shower, you choose.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cMmm bed sounds perfect,\u201d you hum in response, and move to lead him up the stairs towards the master bedroom. As soon as you are through the door; your lips are on each others again as he leads you to the bed, and gently lays you down so he can hover over you. </p><p>He instantly starts working on removing your clothes, as you assist in taking off his as well; letting the cold air nip at both of your\u2019s exposed skin, rather than the cold wet clothes you\u2019s were wearing. His ring covered fingers leave tingles along your skin everywhere they touch, and unsurprisingly causes you to let out a gasp as they come in contact with your soaking wet core. \u201cSo ready for me already,\u201d he states with a grin, and you let out a whimper; the need for him growing substantially. </p><p>\u201cStop teasing,\u201d you whine, and start moving away from him; earning yourself a questioning glance from the man of your dreams. You stand up from the bed, and walk around him; his eyes never leaving you. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn, remember? I can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I ever get so lucky finding you?\u201d He asks as you start gently pushing him down so he sits on the edge of the bed, separating his legs so you can kneel down between them; but he stops you by placing his hand under your chin, and moving your gaze to meet his so you can\u2019t avoid what he\u2019s saying. \u201cI mean it Y/N. You\u2019re <i>so</i> perfect, I can\u2019t even explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sex is that good, hmm?\u201d You joke, and he looks at you disapprovingly. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, H. You really don\u2019t have to tell me this. I mean yes it\u2019s nice to hear, but I really hope that you know I feel the same way about you\u2026 God, I can\u2019t even put into words how much I love you. I just love you <i>so</i> much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d he states, as he moves to kiss you desperately. You stumble slightly at the contact, and grip onto his thigh to balance yourself out; leaning against him as he wraps his arms around your waist. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d you tell him with a smile, and start kneeling down again; pulling his boxers down as you go, and watch as his throbbing cock springs up. He goes to respond, but doesn\u2019t get the chance to as your mouth makes way over his leaking tip, and he sucks in a deep breath. The saltiness of his pre-cum mixes with your saliva as you bob your mouth up and down his shaft, taking him in as much as you can. You do this until his tip hits the back of your throat, letting the hand that isn\u2019t gripping his thigh play with his balls; repeating your same actions over and over again for the next few minutes. </p><p>His hand massages into your hair as you do this; moaning your name, and sweet nothings as you bring him closer to his high. Your tongue continues dancing around his prick, and you flutter your eyes up to make eye contact with him; causing him to almost loose it right then and there. \u201cFuck, Y/N,\u201d he groans, and leans his head back, as you suck hard. \u201cI-I\u2019m gonna cum\u2026 <b>Need to be quick lovie</b>, I-I.\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish his sentence as he comes undone, and warm sticky strings of cum start shooting to the back of your throat, as you continue with your movements until you\u2019ve swallowed every last bit. </p><p>You move away slowly; wiping his remnants away from your mouth as you stand back up, and watch him take a couple of breaths. A smirk falls across your mouth again as you crawl onto the bed, and start leaving a trail of kisses up his chest, to his neck and eventually his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re not done already, are you?\u201d You mumble against his skin, before finally meet his lips again. </p><p>\u201cNot even close,\u201d he replies, and smirks as he rolls away to reach into the drawer in the bedside table next to his side of the bed; pulling out a single condom. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were out of those,\u201d you scoff, and smack his arm. </p><p>\u201cThis is my last one,\u201d he chuckles and rips open the small package, so he can slide the rubber onto his erected penis. \u201cHave to keep stocked up, y\u2019know, in case we don\u2019t leave the house and need each other for warmth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready convinced we\u2019re going to get hypothermia from rolling in the snow,\u201d you state in a matter of factly tone, and he rolls his eyes as he rolls back towards you; pulling you so you\u2019re leaning on top of him, giving you yet another smug grin. You start chuckling lightly as you lean against his chest, and shake your head. \u201c<b>Look at what\u2019s happened to us.</b> Geez, we\u2019re worse than a pair of sex-crazed teenagers\u2026 It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I think we were more embarrassing as teens in general,\u201d he states with a laugh, and starts gently stroking your sides. \u201cI mean, it took us until we weren\u2019t teens anymore to realize that we wanted to be more than friends. Teenage us didn\u2019t know what they were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk valid,\u201d you agree with a smile. \u201cActually, teenage me knew she wanted to end up with you; despite you being away all the time touring, and being my best friend. Now look where that\u2019s gotten us\u2026 poor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh get off it,\u201d he snarks, and leans up to meet your lips in another heated kiss. After a moment of making out, you pull away and remove your underwear swiftly. You start kneeling again over his semi-hard dick, and reach down to hold onto his long length, and align it with your dripping wet slit as you slide yourself down it; his hands guiding your hips at the same time, before gripping onto your ass, and smacking it. It\u2019s been a while since the two of you have done this seeing as he got home from LA just before the two of you left for Holmes Chapel, and you can\u2019t help but let out a quick breath as he stretches your walls. \u201cYou alright, petal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d you tell him, and start rocking your hips against his. </p><p>\u201cGod, yer so tight,\u201d he groans as you start picking up the pace with faster movements. \u201cBut still feels as if that pussy of your\u2019s was made specifically for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was,\u201d you hum as his hands start massaging your exposed breasts; his cold rings sending shivers through your body each time the come in contact with your hard nipples. He then moves one hand to start rubbing your clit as you continue riding him, and the sensation is overwhelming. You gasp, and lean forward against him; various grunts and moans leaving the two of you, as you struggle to catch you breath. </p><p>His hands move to your back and thigh as he flips the two of you over, so your back is on the mattress, and he starts quick, hard thrusts into your middle. More moans escape your mouth as you get closer to your high, and his pace quickens even more. You bite down on your bottom lip to keep yourself quiet, but Harry isn\u2019t having it as he leans down to whisper into you ear. \u201cWe\u2019re home now, love,\u201d he starts. \u201cDon\u2019t gotta quiet yourself here, I want to hear you. Need to hear yeh say my name.\u201d </p><p>He attacks your clit again, rubbing the sensitive nub in just the right spot to set you over the edge. \u201cH-Harry oh <i>fuck</i>,\u201d you groan as your back arches off the mattress, and you clench around his hardened cock. This initiates his second orgasm of the night, as his thrusts slow down and become sloppy; allowing him to ride out his own high with you. </p><p>Once you are both done, he slides out of you and flops down onto the bed as well; sending you the goofiest grin. \u201cRound two?\u201d He asks, as you continue panting beside him. </p><p>You shake your head, and run a hand through his curls. \u201cRun us a bath, and then maybe we can talk,\u201d you tell him, and he perks right up. </p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d he state\u2019s and rolls away from you, before running butt-naked towards the en-suite door, and disappearing behind it; causing you to laugh, as you follow after him. </p>",

Still not quite used to actually writing smut but anyways here ya go* </p><p>A small bump in the road jolts you awake, and you can\u2019t help but smile a little bit as you glance over at Harry in the driver\u2019s seat of the car. The two of you have just gotten back into London from staying at Anne\u2019s house last night in order to spend Christmas Day with her, Gemma, and the rest of Harry\u2019s family. </p><p>Your boyfriend slowly glances over at you, and smiles lightly. \u201cTired, petal?\u201d He asks as he reaches over to give your knee a squeeze. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean t\u2019wake yeh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm not so much anymore,\u201d you tell him, and move your gaze to look out the window; realizing he\u2019s taking a different way home than usual. \u201cAnd no worries, but where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, um, just need to pick up something,\u201d he states awkwardly, and tries to avoid your questioning gaze. </p><p>\u201cHarry it\u2019s Christmas, barely anything is open,\u201d you explain. \u201cWhat could you possibly need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, erm\u2026 Condoms,\u201d he mutters so quietly, you\u2019re unsure if you heard him correctly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d You ask with a chuckle. </p><p>\u201c<i>Condoms</i>,\u201d he replies a bit louder, and his face instantly reddens as you start laughing more. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out of your way on <i>Christmas</i> to get condoms?\u201d You joke, and he just glances at you disapprovingly. \u201cOh Harry, you couldn\u2019t just wait one more day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell after what you pulled last night, no. I can\u2019t,\u201d he pouts, referring to what happened while the two of you were at Anne\u2019s house. \u201cA bit unfair, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most unfair,\u201d you tell him with a smirk, and reach over to put a hand on his cheek; just as he pulls into the parking lot of a small pharmacy; it\u2019s open sign faintly blinking in the snowy weather. He puts the car in park, and looks over to you; as if expecting some sort of sinde comment, but you don\u2019t. \u201cWell, get a move on then. It\u2019s cold. And I did promise I\u2019d make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he says with a wide smile as he leans over for a kiss, before exiting out of the car and making way to the store; trying not to slip on the snow covered ground as he goes. </p><p>A few minutes pass, and he soon emerges from the store holding a bag of things; obviously he didn\u2019t want to go in there <i>just</i> for condoms. You can\u2019t help but chuckle as he walks towards the car, and he gives you a knowing look. He shakes his head at you for laughing at him, until suddenly he slips on some of the snow covered ice, and falls to the cold ground; all of the items in the bag sprawling around him as he does so. </p><p>He lays there motionless for a second, and a panicky feeling takes over while you open the door to climb out of the Range Rover. \u201cOh my god, Harry, are you ok?\u201d You ask worriedly as you shuffle towards him as fast as you can. </p><p>\u201cPhysically I\u2019m fine,\u201d he groans, and leans onto his elbows so he can a better look at you. \u201cEmotionally-.\u201d</p><p>He goes to complete his sentence but is cut off by a screech coming from you, as you step onto a similar icy patch, and fall back onto your ass. You sit there staring at each other for a moment until he starts bursting out laughing, and stands up to come over and help you. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m bruised,\u201d you finish for him with a pout. </p><p>The look of pure amusement that\u2019s on his face as he walks towards you, causes a similar look to form on your features when he sticks his hand out to help pull you back up. With a playful smirk; you take his hand, and yank on it so he\u2019ll fall back down to the ground beside you. </p><p>He falls face first into the snow, and now it\u2019s your turn to laugh as he wipes the snow off his face; turning to glare at you. \u201cThink you\u2019re funny?\u201d He asks, and shakes his hair free of the snowflakes that resided in his curls. </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d you squeak, and try to compose yourself\u2026 but it only results in you laughing even more. He let\u2019s you laugh for a moment as he subtly forms a snowball in his hands, and tosses it at your shoulder when you\u2019re least expecting; causing you to gasp loudly. \u201cHarry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry\u2026 but not really,\u201d he shrugs with a smug grin, and you scowl. You move to make a snowball of your own, preparing to throw it at him as he looks back at you with wide eyes. \u201cY/N, don\u2019t. Let\u2019s just go to the car like the adults we both are, and go home\u2026 No more snowballs.\u201d</p><p>You move your gaze from him to the ball of snow that slowly starts melting in your hold, and agree with his words. A sigh of relief escapes his mouth as you begin lowering your hand, and snap your gaze back to him; changing your mind. \u201cNah,\u201d you tell him, and launch the snowball right at his face. </p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s it,\u201d he growls and lunges at you; tackling you to the ground, but rolling so that you land on top of him as his back meets the cold ground again, and he starts pinching your sides. \u201cNot so tough now, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-harry stop,\u201d you whine as you squirm in his hold, but he refuses to let go. Chuckles ripple through him as you continue to struggle, and he rolls the two of you over so he can get a better look at your pouting face. </p><p>\u201cAwe is someone upset they\u2019re loosing?\u201d He taunts as the pinching comes to a stop, and he leans down to press a sweet kiss against your lips. You moan against his lips, and grab a fist full of his jacket so he can be even closer. He breaks away slightly, and takes a breath before his eyes bore into yours. \u201cDon\u2019t do that petal, you know what that does to me.\u201d</p><p>You smirk; knowing he was referring to your moaning, and start sliding your hands around his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s a method to my madness,\u201d You tell him, and pull him down for another kiss. </p><p>The kiss becomes heated as he lays your back gently against the ground, and presses his lips harder to yours; not giving you the option to deny his tongue as it makes way into your mouth\u2026 not like you were wanting to do that anyways. His hold on you tightens, and an idea springs to your mind as you feel his hardening bulge rub against your leg. Your hand slowly makes it\u2019s way down and starts palming his dick through his pants, causing a moan to escape from his mouth this time. </p><p>\u201cYou play dirty,\u201d he mumbles against your lips, and you just chuckle in response before he kisses you again; not stopping the hold you have on him. He\u2019s quick to pull away again though, and your eyes instantly lock with his enticing green ones. \u201c<b>Are you sure you wanna do this?</b> Because if we start, there\u2019s no stopping until it\u2019s all over, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we better get home than cause we\u2019re <i>not</i> doing this in a parking lot\u2026 or in the snow for that matter,\u201d you state as you place a quick peck onto his lips before breaking free from his hold, and standing back up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m getting snubbed again,\u201d he mumbles as he stands up, and the two of you move to pick up the items that have been laying on the ground for the past few minutes. \u201cWhen we get home, Y/N\u2026 <b>I\u2019ll have you up against the wall in a second.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Harry,\u201d you tell him firmly as you toss the box of condoms to him, and he rolls his eyes as he catches it. \u201cAnd is that a threat, or a promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen for interpretation,\u201d he huffs, and pulls the car keys out from his pocket; sulking as you\u2019s climb in and head on home. </p><p>The whole drive home consists of you teasing you boyfriend, as he scowls; and you\u2019s trying your best not to freeze from the wet clothes you\u2019re wearing. A loud sigh of relief leaves Harry\u2019s mouth as he turns onto a street and the townhouse the two of you share comes into view, causing you to smirk yet again. Once he pulls into the driveway, and puts the car in park; he turns to face you, giving you a certain, suggestive <i>look</i>.</p><p>Knowing what he was doing; you just send him a wink and stay silent as you climb out of the vehicle, and make your way up the stairs towards the front door. You take your set of keys out of your purse, and use them to unlock the door as Harry slowly comes up the stairs behind you. </p><p>Inside, you toss your keys onto the small table that resides in the hallway by the stairs as Harry closes and locks the door behind him, slowly turning to face you. A smug grin returns to your mouth as you wriggle your eyebrows at him teasingly, and move to take off your coat and boots. Just as you finish hanging your coat up, you turn around and are met by Harry\u2019s lips attacking yours, as he pushes you up against the wall; keeping true to his words. You respond instantly by moving to help with removing his coat, and tangling your hands into his curls as the piece of clothing falls to the ground. </p><p>\u201cEager?\u201d You ask teasingly, and he just pulls you in for another kiss. </p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he replies huskily, and starts placing kisses down your neck; nipping, and sucking as he goes. <b>\u201cWanna take this to the bed? Or the table, bench, shower, you choose.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cMmm bed sounds perfect,\u201d you hum in response, and move to lead him up the stairs towards the master bedroom. As soon as you are through the door; your lips are on each others again as he leads you to the bed, and gently lays you down so he can hover over you. </p><p>He instantly starts working on removing your clothes, as you assist in taking off his as well; letting the cold air nip at both of your\u2019s exposed skin, rather than the cold wet clothes you\u2019s were wearing. His ring covered fingers leave tingles along your skin everywhere they touch, and unsurprisingly causes you to let out a gasp as they come in contact with your soaking wet core. \u201cSo ready for me already,\u201d he states with a grin, and you let out a whimper; the need for him growing substantially. </p><p>\u201cStop teasing,\u201d you whine, and start moving away from him; earning yourself a questioning glance from the man of your dreams. You stand up from the bed, and walk around him; his eyes never leaving you. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn, remember? I can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I ever get so lucky finding you?\u201d He asks as you start gently pushing him down so he sits on the edge of the bed, separating his legs so you can kneel down between them; but he stops you by placing his hand under your chin, and moving your gaze to meet his so you can\u2019t avoid what he\u2019s saying. \u201cI mean it Y/N. You\u2019re <i>so</i> perfect, I can\u2019t even explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sex is that good, hmm?\u201d You joke, and he looks at you disapprovingly. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, H. You really don\u2019t have to tell me this. I mean yes it\u2019s nice to hear, but I really hope that you know I feel the same way about you\u2026 God, I can\u2019t even put into words how much I love you. I just love you <i>so</i> much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d he states, as he moves to kiss you desperately. You stumble slightly at the contact, and grip onto his thigh to balance yourself out; leaning against him as he wraps his arms around your waist. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d you tell him with a smile, and start kneeling down again; pulling his boxers down as you go, and watch as his throbbing cock springs up. He goes to respond, but doesn\u2019t get the chance to as your mouth makes way over his leaking tip, and he sucks in a deep breath. The saltiness of his pre-cum mixes with your saliva as you bob your mouth up and down his shaft, taking him in as much as you can. You do this until his tip hits the back of your throat, letting the hand that isn\u2019t gripping his thigh play with his balls; repeating your same actions over and over again for the next few minutes. </p><p>His hand massages into your hair as you do this; moaning your name, and sweet nothings as you bring him closer to his high. Your tongue continues dancing around his prick, and you flutter your eyes up to make eye contact with him; causing him to almost loose it right then and there. \u201cFuck, Y/N,\u201d he groans, and leans his head back, as you suck hard. \u201cI-I\u2019m gonna cum\u2026 <b>Need to be quick lovie</b>, I-I.\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish his sentence as he comes undone, and warm sticky strings of cum start shooting to the back of your throat, as you continue with your movements until you\u2019ve swallowed every last bit. </p><p>You move away slowly; wiping his remnants away from your mouth as you stand back up, and watch him take a couple of breaths. A smirk falls across your mouth again as you crawl onto the bed, and start leaving a trail of kisses up his chest, to his neck and eventually his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re not done already, are you?\u201d You mumble against his skin, before finally meet his lips again. </p><p>\u201cNot even close,\u201d he replies, and smirks as he rolls away to reach into the drawer in the bedside table next to his side of the bed; pulling out a single condom. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were out of those,\u201d you scoff, and smack his arm. </p><p>\u201cThis is my last one,\u201d he chuckles and rips open the small package, so he can slide the rubber onto his erected penis. \u201cHave to keep stocked up, y\u2019know, in case we don\u2019t leave the house and need each other for warmth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready convinced we\u2019re going to get hypothermia from rolling in the snow,\u201d you state in a matter of factly tone, and he rolls his eyes as he rolls back towards you; pulling you so you\u2019re leaning on top of him, giving you yet another smug grin. You start chuckling lightly as you lean against his chest, and shake your head. \u201c<b>Look at what\u2019s happened to us.</b> Geez, we\u2019re worse than a pair of sex-crazed teenagers\u2026 It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I think we were more embarrassing as teens in general,\u201d he states with a laugh, and starts gently stroking your sides. \u201cI mean, it took us until we weren\u2019t teens anymore to realize that we wanted to be more than friends.

Now look where that\u2019s gotten us\u2026 poor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh get off it,\u201d he snarks, and leans up to meet your lips in another heated kiss. After a moment of making out, you pull away and remove your underwear swiftly. You start kneeling again over his semi-hard dick, and reach down to hold onto his long length, and align it with your dripping wet slit as you slide yourself down it; his hands guiding your hips at the same time, before gripping onto your ass, and smacking it. It\u2019s been a while since the two of you have done this seeing as he got home from LA just before the two of you left for Holmes Chapel, and you can\u2019t help but let out a quick breath as he stretches your walls. \u201cYou alright, petal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d you tell him, and start rocking your hips against his. </p><p>\u201cGod, yer so tight,\u201d he groans as you start picking up the pace with faster movements. \u201cBut still feels as if that pussy of your\u2019s was made specifically for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was,\u201d you hum as his hands start massaging your exposed breasts; his cold rings sending shivers through your body each time the come in contact with your hard nipples.

The two of you have just gotten back into London from staying at Anne\u2019s house last night in order to spend Christmas Day with her, Gemma, and the rest of Harry\u2019s family. </p><p>Your boyfriend slowly glances over at you, and smiles lightly. \u201cTired, petal?\u201d He asks as he reaches over to give your knee a squeeze. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean t\u2019wake yeh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm not so much anymore,\u201d you tell him, and move your gaze to look out the window; realizing he\u2019s taking a different way home than usual. \u201cAnd no worries, but where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, um, just need to pick up something,\u201d he states awkwardly, and tries to avoid your questioning gaze. </p><p>\u201cHarry it\u2019s Christmas, barely anything is open,\u201d you explain. \u201cWhat could you possibly need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, erm\u2026 Condoms,\u201d he mutters so quietly, you\u2019re unsure if you heard him correctly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d You ask with a chuckle. </p><p>\u201c<i>Condoms</i>,\u201d he replies a bit louder, and his face instantly reddens as you start laughing more. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out of your way on <i>Christmas</i> to get condoms?\u201d You joke, and he just glances at you disapprovingly. \u201cOh Harry, you couldn\u2019t just wait one more day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell after what you pulled last night, no. I can\u2019t,\u201d he pouts, referring to what happened while the two of you were at Anne\u2019s house. \u201cA bit unfair, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most unfair,\u201d you tell him with a smirk, and reach over to put a hand on his cheek; just as he pulls into the parking lot of a small pharmacy; it\u2019s open sign faintly blinking in the snowy weather. He puts the car in park, and looks over to you; as if expecting some sort of sinde comment, but you don\u2019t. \u201cWell, get a move on then. It\u2019s cold. And I did promise I\u2019d make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he says with a wide smile as he leans over for a kiss, before exiting out of the car and making way to the store; trying not to slip on the snow covered ground as he goes. </p><p>A few minutes pass, and he soon emerges from the store holding a bag of things; obviously he didn\u2019t want to go in there <i>just</i> for condoms. You can\u2019t help but chuckle as he walks towards the car, and he gives you a knowing look. He shakes his head at you for laughing at him, until suddenly he slips on some of the snow covered ice, and falls to the cold ground; all of the items in the bag sprawling around him as he does so. </p><p>He lays there motionless for a second, and a panicky feeling takes over while you open the door to climb out of the Range Rover. \u201cOh my god, Harry, are you ok?\u201d You ask worriedly as you shuffle towards him as fast as you can. </p><p>\u201cPhysically I\u2019m fine,\u201d he groans, and leans onto his elbows so he can a better look at you. \u201cEmotionally-.\u201d</p><p>He goes to complete his sentence but is cut off by a screech coming from you, as you step onto a similar icy patch, and fall back onto your ass. You sit there staring at each other for a moment until he starts bursting out laughing, and stands up to come over and help you. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m bruised,\u201d you finish for him with a pout. </p><p>The look of pure amusement that\u2019s on his face as he walks towards you, causes a similar look to form on your features when he sticks his hand out to help pull you back up. With a playful smirk; you take his hand, and yank on it so he\u2019ll fall back down to the ground beside you. </p><p>He falls face first into the snow, and now it\u2019s your turn to laugh as he wipes the snow off his face; turning to glare at you. \u201cThink you\u2019re funny?\u201d He asks, and shakes his hair free of the snowflakes that resided in his curls. </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d you squeak, and try to compose yourself\u2026 but it only results in you laughing even more. He let\u2019s you laugh for a moment as he subtly forms a snowball in his hands, and tosses it at your shoulder when you\u2019re least expecting; causing you to gasp loudly. \u201cHarry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry\u2026 but not really,\u201d he shrugs with a smug grin, and you scowl. You move to make a snowball of your own, preparing to throw it at him as he looks back at you with wide eyes. \u201cY/N, don\u2019t. Let\u2019s just go to the car like the adults we both are, and go home\u2026 No more snowballs.\u201d</p><p>You move your gaze from him to the ball of snow that slowly starts melting in your hold, and agree with his words. A sigh of relief escapes his mouth as you begin lowering your hand, and snap your gaze back to him; changing your mind. \u201cNah,\u201d you tell him, and launch the snowball right at his face. </p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s it,\u201d he growls and lunges at you; tackling you to the ground, but rolling so that you land on top of him as his back meets the cold ground again, and he starts pinching your sides. \u201cNot so tough now, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-harry stop,\u201d you whine as you squirm in his hold, but he refuses to let go. Chuckles ripple through him as you continue to struggle, and he rolls the two of you over so he can get a better look at your pouting face. </p><p>\u201cAwe is someone upset they\u2019re loosing?\u201d He taunts as the pinching comes to a stop, and he leans down to press a sweet kiss against your lips. You moan against his lips, and grab a fist full of his jacket so he can be even closer. He breaks away slightly, and takes a breath before his eyes bore into yours. \u201cDon\u2019t do that petal, you know what that does to me.\u201d</p><p>You smirk; knowing he was referring to your moaning, and start sliding your hands around his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s a method to my madness,\u201d You tell him, and pull him down for another kiss. </p><p>The kiss becomes heated as he lays your back gently against the ground, and presses his lips harder to yours; not giving you the option to deny his tongue as it makes way into your mouth\u2026 not like you were wanting to do that anyways. His hold on you tightens, and an idea springs to your mind as you feel his hardening bulge rub against your leg. Your hand slowly makes it\u2019s way down and starts palming his dick through his pants, causing a moan to escape from his mouth this time. </p><p>\u201cYou play dirty,\u201d he mumbles against your lips, and you just chuckle in response before he kisses you again; not stopping the hold you have on him. He\u2019s quick to pull away again though, and your eyes instantly lock with his enticing green ones. \u201c<b>Are you sure you wanna do this?</b> Because if we start, there\u2019s no stopping until it\u2019s all over, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we better get home than cause we\u2019re <i>not</i> doing this in a parking lot\u2026 or in the snow for that matter,\u201d you state as you place a quick peck onto his lips before breaking free from his hold, and standing back up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m getting snubbed again,\u201d he mumbles as he stands up, and the two of you move to pick up the items that have been laying on the ground for the past few minutes. \u201cWhen we get home, Y/N\u2026 <b>I\u2019ll have you up against the wall in a second.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Harry,\u201d you tell him firmly as you toss the box of condoms to him, and he rolls his eyes as he catches it. \u201cAnd is that a threat, or a promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen for interpretation,\u201d he huffs, and pulls the car keys out from his pocket; sulking as you\u2019s climb in and head on home. </p><p>The whole drive home consists of you teasing you boyfriend, as he scowls; and you\u2019s trying your best not to freeze from the wet clothes you\u2019re wearing. A loud sigh of relief leaves Harry\u2019s mouth as he turns onto a street and the townhouse the two of you share comes into view, causing you to smirk yet again. Once he pulls into the driveway, and puts the car in park; he turns to face you, giving you a certain, suggestive <i>look</i>.</p><p>Knowing what he was doing; you just send him a wink and stay silent as you climb out of the vehicle, and make your way up the stairs towards the front door. You take your set of keys out of your purse, and use them to unlock the door as Harry slowly comes up the stairs behind you. </p><p>Inside, you toss your keys onto the small table that resides in the hallway by the stairs as Harry closes and locks the door behind him, slowly turning to face you. A smug grin returns to your mouth as you wriggle your eyebrows at him teasingly, and move to take off your coat and boots. Just as you finish hanging your coat up, you turn around and are met by Harry\u2019s lips attacking yours, as he pushes you up against the wall; keeping true to his words. You respond instantly by moving to help with removing his coat, and tangling your hands into his curls as the piece of clothing falls to the ground. </p><p>\u201cEager?\u201d You ask teasingly, and he just pulls you in for another kiss. </p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he replies huskily, and starts placing kisses down your neck; nipping, and sucking as he goes. <b>\u201cWanna take this to the bed? Or the table, bench, shower, you choose.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cMmm bed sounds perfect,\u201d you hum in response, and move to lead him up the stairs towards the master bedroom. As soon as you are through the door; your lips are on each others again as he leads you to the bed, and gently lays you down so he can hover over you. </p><p>He instantly starts working on removing your clothes, as you assist in taking off his as well; letting the cold air nip at both of your\u2019s exposed skin, rather than the cold wet clothes you\u2019s were wearing. His ring covered fingers leave tingles along your skin everywhere they touch, and unsurprisingly causes you to let out a gasp as they come in contact with your soaking wet core. \u201cSo ready for me already,\u201d he states with a grin, and you let out a whimper; the need for him growing substantially. </p><p>\u201cStop teasing,\u201d you whine, and start moving away from him; earning yourself a questioning glance from the man of your dreams. You stand up from the bed, and walk around him; his eyes never leaving you. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn, remember? I can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I ever get so lucky finding you?\u201d He asks as you start gently pushing him down so he sits on the edge of the bed, separating his legs so you can kneel down between them; but he stops you by placing his hand under your chin, and moving your gaze to meet his so you can\u2019t avoid what he\u2019s saying. \u201cI mean it Y/N. You\u2019re <i>so</i> perfect, I can\u2019t even explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sex is that good, hmm?\u201d You joke, and he looks at you disapprovingly. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, H. You really don\u2019t have to tell me this. I mean yes it\u2019s nice to hear, but I really hope that you know I feel the same way about you\u2026 God, I can\u2019t even put into words how much I love you. I just love you <i>so</i> much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d he states, as he moves to kiss you desperately. You stumble slightly at the contact, and grip onto his thigh to balance yourself out; leaning against him as he wraps his arms around your waist. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d you tell him with a smile, and start kneeling down again; pulling his boxers down as you go, and watch as his throbbing cock springs up. He goes to respond, but doesn\u2019t get the chance to as your mouth makes way over his leaking tip, and he sucks in a deep breath. The saltiness of his pre-cum mixes with your saliva as you bob your mouth up and down his shaft, taking him in as much as you can. You do this until his tip hits the back of your throat, letting the hand that isn\u2019t gripping his thigh play with his balls; repeating your same actions over and over again for the next few minutes. </p><p>His hand massages into your hair as you do this; moaning your name, and sweet nothings as you bring him closer to his high. Your tongue continues dancing around his prick, and you flutter your eyes up to make eye contact with him; causing him to almost loose it right then and there. \u201cFuck, Y/N,\u201d he groans, and leans his head back, as you suck hard. \u201cI-I\u2019m gonna cum\u2026 <b>Need to be quick lovie</b>, I-I.\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish his sentence as he comes undone, and warm sticky strings of cum start shooting to the back of your throat, as you continue with your movements until you\u2019ve swallowed every last bit. </p><p>You move away slowly; wiping his remnants away from your mouth as you stand back up, and watch him take a couple of breaths. A smirk falls across your mouth again as you crawl onto the bed, and start leaving a trail of kisses up his chest, to his neck and eventually his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re not done already, are you?\u201d You mumble against his skin, before finally meet his lips again. </p><p>\u201cNot even close,\u201d he replies, and smirks as he rolls away to reach into the drawer in the bedside table next to his side of the bed; pulling out a single condom. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were out of those,\u201d you scoff, and smack his arm. </p><p>\u201cThis is my last one,\u201d he chuckles and rips open the small package, so he can slide the rubber onto his erected penis. \u201cHave to keep stocked up, y\u2019know, in case we don\u2019t leave the house and need each other for warmth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready convinced we\u2019re going to get hypothermia from rolling in the snow,\u201d you state in a matter of factly tone, and he rolls his eyes as he rolls back towards you; pulling you so you\u2019re leaning on top of him, giving you yet another smug grin. You start chuckling lightly as you lean against his chest, and shake your head. \u201c<b>Look at what\u2019s happened to us.</b> Geez, we\u2019re worse than a pair of sex-crazed teenagers\u2026 It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I think we were more embarrassing as teens in general,\u201d he states with a laugh, and starts gently stroking your sides. \u201cI mean, it took us until we weren\u2019t teens anymore to realize that we wanted to be more than friends. Teenage us didn\u2019t know what they were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk valid,\u201d you agree with a smile. \u201cActually, teenage me knew she wanted to end up with you; despite you being away all the time touring, and being my best friend. Now look where that\u2019s gotten us\u2026 poor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh get off it,\u201d he snarks, and leans up to meet your lips in another heated kiss. After a moment of making out, you pull away and remove your underwear swiftly. You start kneeling again over his semi-hard dick, and reach down to hold onto his long length, and align it with your dripping wet slit as you slide yourself down it; his hands guiding your hips at the same time, before gripping onto your ass, and smacking it. It\u2019s been a while since the two of you have done this seeing as he got home from LA just before the two of you left for Holmes Chapel, and you can\u2019t help but let out a quick breath as he stretches your walls. \u201cYou alright, petal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d you tell him, and start rocking your hips against his. </p><p>\u201cGod, yer so tight,\u201d he groans as you start picking up the pace with faster movements. \u201cBut still feels as if that pussy of your\u2019s was made specifically for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was,\u201d you hum as his hands start massaging your exposed breasts; his cold rings sending shivers through your body each time the come in contact with your hard nipples. He then moves one hand to start rubbing your clit as you continue riding him, and the sensation is overwhelming. You gasp, and lean forward against him; various grunts and moans leaving the two of you, as you struggle to catch you breath. </p><p>His hands move to your back and thigh as he flips the two of you over, so your back is on the mattress, and he starts quick, hard thrusts into your middle. More moans escape your mouth as you get closer to your high, and his pace quickens even more. You bite down on your bottom lip to keep yourself quiet, but Harry isn\u2019t having it as he leans down to whisper into you ear. \u201cWe\u2019re home now, love,\u201d he starts. \u201cDon\u2019t gotta quiet yourself here, I want to hear you. Need to hear yeh say my name.\u201d </p><p>He attacks your clit again, rubbing the sensitive nub in just the right spot to set you over the edge. \u201cH-Harry oh <i>fuck</i>,\u201d you groan as your back arches off the mattress, and you clench around his hardened cock. This initiates his second orgasm of the night, as his thrusts slow down and become sloppy; allowing him to ride out his own high with you. </p><p>Once you are both done, he slides out of you and flops down onto the bed as well; sending you the goofiest grin. \u201cRound two?\u201d He asks, as you continue panting beside him. </p><p>You shake your head, and run a hand through his curls. \u201cRun us a bath, and then maybe we can talk,\u201d you tell him, and he perks right up. </p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d he state\u2019s and rolls away from you, before running butt-naked towards the en-suite door, and disappearing behind it; causing you to laugh, as you follow after him. </p>",

You sit there staring at each other for a moment until he starts bursting out laughing, and stands up to come over and help you. &ldquo;&hellip; I&rsquo;m bruised,&rdquo; you finish for him with a pout. </p><p>The look of pure amusement that&rsquo;s on his face as he walks towards you, causes a similar look to form on your features when he sticks his hand out to help pull you back up. With a playful smirk; you take his hand, and yank on it so he&rsquo;ll fall back down to the ground beside you. </p><p>He falls face first into the snow, and now it&rsquo;s your turn to laugh as he wipes the snow off his face; turning to glare at you. &ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re funny?&rdquo; He asks, and shakes his hair free of the snowflakes that resided in his curls. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; you squeak, and try to compose yourself&hellip; but it only results in you laughing even more. He let&rsquo;s you laugh for a moment as he subtly forms a snowball in his hands, and tosses it at your shoulder when you&rsquo;re least expecting; causing you to gasp loudly. &ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;sorry&hellip; but not really,&rdquo; he shrugs with a smug grin, and you scowl. You move to make a snowball of your own, preparing to throw it at him as he looks back at you with wide eyes. &ldquo;Y/N, don&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s just go to the car like the adults we both are, and go home&hellip; No more snowballs.&rdquo;</p><p>You move your gaze from him to the ball of snow that slowly starts melting in your hold, and agree with his words. A sigh of relief escapes his mouth as you begin lowering your hand, and snap your gaze back to him; changing your mind. &ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; you tell him, and launch the snowball right at his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he growls and lunges at you; tackling you to the ground, but rolling so that you land on top of him as his back meets the cold ground again, and he starts pinching your sides. &ldquo;Not so tough now, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;H-harry stop,&rdquo; you whine as you squirm in his hold, but he refuses to let go. Chuckles ripple through him as you continue to struggle, and he rolls the two of you over so he can get a better look at your pouting face. </p><p>&ldquo;Awe is someone upset they&rsquo;re loosing?&rdquo; He taunts as the pinching comes to a stop, and he leans down to press a sweet kiss against your lips. You moan against his lips, and grab a fist full of his jacket so he can be even closer. He breaks away slightly, and takes a breath before his eyes bore into yours. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that petal, you know what that does to me.&rdquo;</p><p>You smirk; knowing he was referring to your moaning, and start sliding your hands around his chest. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a method to my madness,&rdquo; You tell him, and pull him down for another kiss. </p><p>The kiss becomes heated as he lays your back gently against the ground, and presses his lips harder to yours; not giving you the option to deny his tongue as it makes way into your mouth&hellip; not like you were wanting to do that anyways. His hold on you tightens, and an idea springs to your mind as you feel his hardening bulge rub against your leg. Your hand slowly makes it&rsquo;s way down and starts palming his dick through his pants, causing a moan to escape from his mouth this time. </p><p>&ldquo;You play dirty,&rdquo; he mumbles against your lips, and you just chuckle in response before he kisses you again; not stopping the hold you have on him. He&rsquo;s quick to pull away again though, and your eyes instantly lock with his enticing green ones. &ldquo;<b>Are you sure you wanna do this?</b> Because if we start, there&rsquo;s no stopping until it&rsquo;s all over, pet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Guess we better get home than cause we&rsquo;re <i>not</i> doing this in a parking lot&hellip; or in the snow for that matter,&rdquo; you state as you place a quick peck onto his lips before breaking free from his hold, and standing back up. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do I feel like I&rsquo;m getting snubbed again,&rdquo; he mumbles as he stands up, and the two of you move to pick up the items that have been laying on the ground for the past few minutes. &ldquo;When we get home, Y/N&hellip; <b>I&rsquo;ll have you up against the wall in a second.&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine, Harry,&rdquo; you tell him firmly as you toss the box of condoms to him, and he rolls his eyes as he catches it. &ldquo;And is that a threat, or a promise?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Open for interpretation,&rdquo; he huffs, and pulls the car keys out from his pocket; sulking as you&rsquo;s climb in and head on home. </p><p>The whole drive home consists of you teasing you boyfriend, as he scowls; and you&rsquo;s trying your best not to freeze from the wet clothes you&rsquo;re wearing. A loud sigh of relief leaves Harry&rsquo;s mouth as he turns onto a street and the townhouse the two of you share comes into view, causing you to smirk yet again. Once he pulls into the driveway, and puts the car in park; he turns to face you, giving you a certain, suggestive <i>look</i>.</p><p>Knowing what he was doing; you just send him a wink and stay silent as you climb out of the vehicle, and make your way up the stairs towards the front door. You take your set of keys out of your purse, and use them to unlock the door as Harry slowly comes up the stairs behind you. </p><p>Inside, you toss your keys onto the small table that resides in the hallway by the stairs as Harry closes and locks the door behind him, slowly turning to face you. A smug grin returns to your mouth as you wriggle your eyebrows at him teasingly, and move to take off your coat and boots. Just as you finish hanging your coat up, you turn around and are met by Harry&rsquo;s lips attacking yours, as he pushes you up against the wall; keeping true to his words. You respond instantly by moving to help with removing his coat, and tangling your hands into his curls as the piece of clothing falls to the ground. </p><p>&ldquo;Eager?&rdquo; You ask teasingly, and he just pulls you in for another kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea,&rdquo; he replies huskily, and starts placing kisses down your neck; nipping, and sucking as he goes. <b>&ldquo;Wanna take this to the bed? Or the table, bench, shower, you choose.&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;Mmm bed sounds perfect,&rdquo; you hum in response, and move to lead him up the stairs towards the master bedroom. As soon as you are through the door; your lips are on each others again as he leads you to the bed, and gently lays you down so he can hover over you. </p><p>He instantly starts working on removing your clothes, as you assist in taking off his as well; letting the cold air nip at both of your&rsquo;s exposed skin, rather than the cold wet clothes you&rsquo;s were wearing. His ring covered fingers leave tingles along your skin everywhere they touch, and unsurprisingly causes you to let out a gasp as they come in contact with your soaking wet core. &ldquo;So ready for me already,&rdquo; he states with a grin, and you let out a whimper; the need for him growing substantially. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop teasing,&rdquo; you whine, and start moving away from him; earning yourself a questioning glance from the man of your dreams. You stand up from the bed, and walk around him; his eyes never leaving you. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn, remember? I can wait.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did I ever get so lucky finding you?&rdquo; He asks as you start gently pushing him down so he sits on the edge of the bed, separating his legs so you can kneel down between them; but he stops you by placing his hand under your chin, and moving your gaze to meet his so you can&rsquo;t avoid what he&rsquo;s saying. &ldquo;I mean it Y/N. You&rsquo;re <i>so</i> perfect, I can&rsquo;t even explain it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The sex is that good, hmm?&rdquo; You joke, and he looks at you disapprovingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding, H. You really don&rsquo;t have to tell me this. I mean yes it&rsquo;s nice to hear, but I really hope that you know I feel the same way about you&hellip; God, I can&rsquo;t even put into words how much I love you. I just love you <i>so</i> much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I love you,&rdquo; he states, as he moves to kiss you desperately. You stumble slightly at the contact, and grip onto his thigh to balance yourself out; leaning against him as he wraps his arms around your waist. </p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; you tell him with a smile, and start kneeling down again; pulling his boxers down as you go, and watch as his throbbing cock springs up. He goes to respond, but doesn&rsquo;t get the chance to as your mouth makes way over his leaking tip, and he sucks in a deep breath. The saltiness of his pre-cum mixes with your saliva as you bob your mouth up and down his shaft, taking him in as much as you can. You do this until his tip hits the back of your throat, letting the hand that isn&rsquo;t gripping his thigh play with his balls; repeating your same actions over and over again for the next few minutes. </p><p>His hand massages into your hair as you do this; moaning your name, and sweet nothings as you bring him closer to his high. Your tongue continues dancing around his prick, and you flutter your eyes up to make eye contact with him; causing him to almost loose it right then and there. &ldquo;Fuck, Y/N,&rdquo; he groans, and leans his head back, as you suck hard. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m gonna cum&hellip; <b>Need to be quick lovie</b>, I-I.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t finish his sentence as he comes undone, and warm sticky strings of cum start shooting to the back of your throat, as you continue with your movements until you&rsquo;ve swallowed every last bit. </p><p>You move away slowly; wiping his remnants away from your mouth as you stand back up, and watch him take a couple of breaths. A smirk falls across your mouth again as you crawl onto the bed, and start leaving a trail of kisses up his chest, to his neck and eventually his jaw. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not done already, are you?&rdquo; You mumble against his skin, before finally meet his lips again. </p><p>&ldquo;Not even close,&rdquo; he replies, and smirks as he rolls away to reach into the drawer in the bedside table next to his side of the bed; pulling out a single condom. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were out of those,&rdquo; you scoff, and smack his arm. </p><p>&ldquo;This is my last one,&rdquo; he chuckles and rips open the small package, so he can slide the rubber onto his erected penis. &ldquo;Have to keep stocked up, y&rsquo;know, in case we don&rsquo;t leave the house and need each other for warmth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Already convinced we&rsquo;re going to get hypothermia from rolling in the snow,&rdquo; you state in a matter of factly tone, and he rolls his eyes as he rolls back towards you; pulling you so you&rsquo;re leaning on top of him, giving you yet another smug grin. You start chuckling lightly as you lean against his chest, and shake your head. &ldquo;<b>Look at what&rsquo;s happened to us.</b> Geez, we&rsquo;re worse than a pair of sex-crazed teenagers&hellip; It&rsquo;s embarrassing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No I think we were more embarrassing as teens in general,&rdquo; he states with a laugh, and starts gently stroking your sides. &ldquo;I mean, it took us until we weren&rsquo;t teens anymore to realize that we wanted to be more than friends. Teenage us didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok valid,&rdquo; you agree with a smile. &ldquo;Actually, teenage me knew she wanted to end up with you; despite you being away all the time touring, and being my best friend. Now look where that&rsquo;s gotten us&hellip; poor me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh get off it,&rdquo; he snarks, and leans up to meet your lips in another heated kiss. After a moment of making out, you pull away and remove your underwear swiftly. You start kneeling again over his semi-hard dick, and reach down to hold onto his long length, and align it with your dripping wet slit as you slide yourself down it; his hands guiding your hips at the same time, before gripping onto your ass, and smacking it. It&rsquo;s been a while since the two of you have done this seeing as he got home from LA just before the two of you left for Holmes Chapel, and you can&rsquo;t help but let out a quick breath as he stretches your walls. &ldquo;You alright, petal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm,&rdquo; you tell him, and start rocking your hips against his. </p><p>&ldquo;God, yer so tight,&rdquo; he groans as you start picking up the pace with faster movements. &ldquo;But still feels as if that pussy of your&rsquo;s was made specifically for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it was,&rdquo; you hum as his hands start massaging your exposed breasts; his cold rings sending shivers through your body each time the come in contact with your hard nipples. He then moves one hand to start rubbing your clit as you continue riding him, and the sensation is overwhelming. You gasp, and lean forward against him; various grunts and moans leaving the two of you, as you struggle to catch you breath. </p><p>His hands move to your back and thigh as he flips the two of you over, so your back is on the mattress, and he starts quick, hard thrusts into your middle. More moans escape your mouth as you get closer to your high, and his pace quickens even more. You bite down on your bottom lip to keep yourself quiet, but Harry isn&rsquo;t having it as he leans down to whisper into you ear. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re home now, love,&rdquo; he starts. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t gotta quiet yourself here, I want to hear you. Need to hear yeh say my name.&rdquo; </p><p>He attacks your clit again, rubbing the sensitive nub in just the right spot to set you over the edge. &ldquo;H-Harry oh <i>fuck</i>,&rdquo; you groan as your back arches off the mattress, and you clench around his hardened cock. This initiates his second orgasm of the night, as his thrusts slow down and become sloppy; allowing him to ride out his own high with you. </p><p>Once you are both done, he slides out of you and flops down onto the bed as well; sending you the goofiest grin. &ldquo;Round two?&rdquo; He asks, as you continue panting beside him. </p><p>You shake your head, and run a hand through his curls. &ldquo;Run us a bath, and then maybe we can talk,&rdquo; you tell him, and he perks right up. </p><p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; he state&rsquo;s and rolls away from you, before running butt-naked towards the en-suite door, and disappearing behind it; causing you to laugh, as you follow after him. </p>",
