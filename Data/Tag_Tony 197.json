        "body": "<p>Not to toot my own horn, but I\u2019m about to save some lives. Buckle up.<b><br/></b></p><p>Six months ago, I was asked for comic recs. I\u2019m posting those recs today. Why so long? Because I couldn\u2019t just make a rec list, no, I\u2019m too extra for that. I had to go and make, to the best of my ability and knowledge, my own entire personal guide to Iron Man comics. I also have a tendency to start projects and not do them. But I did this one! And now I share it with you.</p><p>For your assistance, I\u2019m going to link <a href=\"https://www.comicbookherald.com/iron-man-reading-order/\">this Comic Book Herald</a> article which is a full Iron Man reading order (LIFESAVER) and has links to amazon to buy the collections &amp; arcs being talked about if you are so inclined.</p><p>You can find comics on amazon, ebay, the marvel website or Marvel Digital Comics Store (you can buy digital versions of comics), or just find a local comic shop and see what they have. You can easily find any comic you want free to read online, but the websites are a little shady. I\u2019ll leave it to your discretion.</p><p>Disclaimer: Remember that these are all my personal opinions. Often, they will not line up with popular opinions. You might really like stuff that I didn\u2019t care for. You might dislike my favorites. You might agree with my opinions. If any comic fans read this and are offended by any of my opinions, please don\u2019t be!! Opinions on comics are SO subjective, just find out what you like and stick to it. I just figured I\u2019d lend my own personal helping hand for you get started, because doing so can be intimidating.</p><p>WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, let\u2019s begin under the cut! (If you are on mobile&hellip;I am so, so sorry about this)</p><!-- more --><h2>Short version (the recommendation-y part)</h2><p><b>Recs because I like them:</b></p><p>Iron Man Volume 3 (1998)- #1-25 (my actual absolute FAVORITE RUN of all time and my number one recommendation. It\u2019s by Kurt Busiek, Roger Stern, and Sean Chen), #26-30, #62-63, #73-78. Iron Man Volume 4 (2005) #1-35. \u00a0Invincible Iron Man (2008) spanned many years so you should read at least some, and it has many fans, but I am not one of them, so I\u2019m not gonna rec too much. Issues #1-6 and its epilogue, #7, are worth a read and the arc spanning #8-19 is probably the best from the era, I would say that I enjoyed that arc. Next is Brian Michael Bendis\u2019 stuff, which has a pretty bad rep and while I don\u2019t hate it as much as others do, I wouldn\u2019t say I love it. It is, however, the most recent completed run &amp; important stuff happens, and there\u2019s some good stuff here and there, so yeah. I don\u2019t really have any specific recs from here&hellip;just read the whole thing and see what you get out of it or scroll down to the guide section and see the highlights I picked out. Invincible Iron Man (2015) #1-25, and Invincible Iron Man (2016) #1-600 (they changed the numbering halfway through, it\u2019s not 600 issues it\u2019s only I think 19).</p><p><b>Recs because important stuff happens even if I don\u2019t necessarily like them:</b></p><p>Civil War I (occurs during the Iron Man run starting in 2005), Civil War II (occurs during Brian Michael Bendis era), Iron Man (2012) #9-17 \u201cThe Secret Origin of Tony Stark.\u201d</p><h2>Long version (the guide-y part)</h2><p>First off, I\u2019m going to tell you that my suggested starting points are Invincible Iron Man (1998) which was my starting point, and Invincible Iron Man (2005). Much more on those below.</p><p>I haven\u2019t read Mr. Stark\u2019s classic adventures yet because there\u2019s a daunting number of them and I still need to find a starting point, so we\u2019re gonna start with&hellip;</p><p><b>Volume 3 (1998):</b></p><p>Okay I have SO MUCH to say here because I\u2019d die for this volume!! It\u2019s considered by many to be nothing special but there\u2019s a lot to appreciate if you\u2019re a fan of Tony in the way that many are here on tumblr- caring about character development &amp; character moments first and foremost. I\u2019ll break down my favorites for ya</p><p>#1- does a good job of setting the tone for Tony and this era of Invincible Iron Man. Some nice Tony character details are in there. Volume 3 is started with Kurt Busiek writing (later joined by Roger Stern) and Sean Chen on pencils. I LOVED this team, this is my FAVORITE run of Iron Man that I\u2019ve read, PLEASE read all 25 issues. I thought Busiek understood Tony really well and I just loved the way Chen drew Tony (and everything else), and their first issue is surprisingly enjoyable for mostly existing to set the groundwork for a fresh start.</p><p>#4-5- I think this is where the run starts to kick into gear. Tony\u2019s on-and-off girlfriend for the era, Rumiko, is introduced and she\u2019s fun (but as the years went on, deserved much better writing). Tony kicks some butt &amp; is a hero.</p><p>#6- an awesome Iron Man/Black Widow team up. It shows a really nice friendship between Tony &amp; Nat. Also, Nat kicks butt &amp; it\u2019s great</p><p>I\u2019m recommending every issue that builds Tony\u2019s relationship with Carol Danvers (at this time, she was Warbird, not Captain Marvel). #7, #11-12, #18, #19, #21, and #23-25. Their storyline details Tony\u2019s endeavors to help Carol overcome alcoholism. At least read the Carol parts of the issues she\u2019s only in a few panels of. Major highlight of the Iron Man comics I\u2019ve read. Also- knowing this background will definitely make Civil War II have more weight</p><p>#8-12- Tony gets the actual daylights beaten out of him and then some, leading into a compelling 2-issue Mandarin arc, this then leads into an interesting 2-issue team up with Warbird that gives us an answer as to why his injuries were so bad. It hurts but it\u2019s good</p><p>#13- an actually really compelling single-issue story that involves some trippy, creepy mind control stuff and takes a look into Tony\u2019s head- specifically questioning whether or not being Iron Man has become an addiction. You can\u2019t tell yet but I\u2019m trying my hardest to not recommend every single issue</p><p>#26-30- The Mask in the Iron Man arc. This is the first issue without Busiek writing- Joe Quesada steps in and it\u2019s good stuff. It\u2019s also Sean Chen\u2019s last arc. It starts with Tony punching a guy in the face to protect Rumiko but getting punched back and having to wear a nose splint- it\u2019s really cute. Then Tony and Ru run into relationship problems. Then the Iron Man armor becomes sentient, basically falls in love with Tony, and kidnaps him on a remote island. Wait-what? Yeah, it\u2019s really weird in hindsight, but while you\u2019re reading it, it sure does pull you in. One of the biggest standouts of the whole era and something of an instant classic. Also, the first few pages of #31 give you a little aftermath.</p><p>#37-40- this wasn\u2019t my favorite arc but I\u2019m recommending it just because of how wild it ends up being. These were the days when IIM wasn\u2019t afraid to have a big imagination. And I mean big, like, who thought of this? Well, Frank Tieri is writing at this point (he\u2019s okay, not my favorite of the volume), and Alitha Martinez &amp; Paul Ryan are on pencils (it\u2019s fine, but you\u2019ll miss Sean Chen) (you\u2019ll always miss Sean Chen). Also, a major player in this arc is Tiberius Stone so maybe read it to know who he is.</p><p>#50- \u201cTinman\u201d. Issue 50 was meant to be a place for new readers to jump in. Mike Grell &amp; Michael Ryan are at the reigns as writer and artist. Grell\u2019s characterization was fairly solid, my favorite next to Busiek in this era. His version of Tony is more in touch with his emotions, I guess, than some like to characterize him. Sometimes he gets aggressive when he\u2019s angry but there\u2019s also a lot of really sweet moments and they portray him as doing a lot of good, like funding a rehab/safehouse for kids on the street. Grell\u2019s stories are generally grittier and more violent but Tony himself doesn\u2019t really take a dark turn. Issue #50 has both action and a VERY SOFT Tony, definitely recommend it</p><p>#53-55- \u201cBook of the Ten Rings\u201d. Again, it\u2019s grittier than the stuff that came before it, but it\u2019s good. Once the main story wraps up, something really important happens at the end. Also, it\u2019s important to note here for people that weren\u2019t previously into comics that at this point, Pepper and Happy are a thing, not Pepper and Tony as seen in the MCU</p><p>#59-61- \u201cIn Shining Armor\u201d. Tony travels back to Medieval times and it\u2019s not exactly a good time for him but it\u2019s a wild time for us. Gotta love a good old fashioned time travel arc</p><p>#62-63- \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get\u201d. Oh god PLEASE read this one, if you only listen to one of my post-Busiek &amp; Chen recs this is the one, the Tony content is so precious</p><p>#73-78- \u201cThe Best Defense\u201d. The arc detailing Tony\u2019s journey to becoming Secretary of Defense because yes, that happened. A very interesting concept to watch Tony go through and one of the most notable stories in this era.</p><p><b>Volume 4 (2005):</b></p><p>This is the last of what I consider the Really Good Stuff (except for Civil War, but we\u2019ll get there). These comics defined Tony Stark as we know him today, and you\u2019ll notice that MCU Tony was definitely influenced by them. If you\u2019re starting here, it\u2019ll be Iron Man as you basically already know it. If you\u2019re coming here off of Volume 3, then you\u2019ll notice the tone of not just the stories but of Tony himself get darker. For whatever reason, writers looked at Tony and said \u201clet\u2019s find ways to bring his morals into question bc that\u2019s Interesting!\u201d It\u2019s not bad (the Iron Man title, that is- Civil War is bad) but it doesn\u2019t really reflect what came before it, I guess. I\u2019m recommending all 35 issues bc why not but I\u2019ll break it down for ya &amp; make sure to point out my favorites </p><p>#1-6- \u201cExtremis\u201d. A must read. One of the most iconic Iron Man stories in 21st century comic history. It\u2019s on everyone\u2019s list. You are, as an Iron Man fan looking to get into IM comics, legally obligated to read this. This would also be the arc where I believe the MCU looked for inspiration for Tony characterization. Also Extremis obviously ended up in the MCU but it\u2019s like way different in the MCU than in the source material</p><p>#7-12- \u201cExecute Program\u201d- Basically, Tony is screwed up post-Extremis. Poor guy. Please read this. Directly leads to Civil War\u2026</p><p>Civil War (2006) #1-7- Ugh. So. Civil War. In my personal opinion- not a fan. I actually like the movie MUCH better and imo the movie is the way this should have been written. Unfortunately, you\u2019ve gotta read it because it\u2019s an important event. You\u2019ll see people calling it \u201cTony Stark characterization murder\u201d and THAT\u2019S VALID. Like. Tony suddenly became&hellip;a villain?? literally the worst?? under the poorly written guise of \u201cjust doing what I have to do\u201d but the stuff that happens\u2026.it just can\u2019t be explained with \u201cdoing what I have to do\u201d. Honestly it reads like the writers just wanted to pit Tony against Steve and didn\u2019t care about keeping him in character. Tony basically had to be turned into a villain to make the story work because In-Character Tony would not have fit their needs. It sucks and I don\u2019t want to recommend it but you have to read it because it affects so much that comes after it.</p><p>THE ONLY CIVIL WAR ANYTHING YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER are tie ins and oneshots and I will tell you a couple</p><p>Invincible Iron Man #13-14- IIM\u2019s CW tie ins. Issue 13 comes after CW #2, issue 14 after CW #5. Read these read these read these!!!!</p><p>Captain America/Iron Man: Casualties of War- oneshot to be read after Civil War #4. Tony offers Steve the chance to try and talk it out. Both explain their positions and a lot of comic history between them is brought up.</p><p>Civil War: The Confession: SO after CW, SPOILER SPOILER poor Steve is assassinated in Captain America #25 (it\u2019s actually more wild than that bc superheroes don\u2019t just die but whatever) and this is a oneshot with two halves, the first takes place after Steve is dead and is Tony-centric and I LITERALLY CRIED and the second takes place when Steve is imprisoned before he is killed. PLEASE read this</p><p>There\u2019s more tie ins involving Tony that you should read but I\u2019m sick of talking abt CW </p><p>BACK TO THE IRON MAN SOLO TITLE</p><p>Sooooo the title now changes from Invincible Iron Man to Iron Man: Director of SHIELD but it\u2019s the same book</p><p>#15-18- It\u2019s Tony\u2019s first story arc as Director and it ends up being kind of wild actually</p><p>#21-28- \u2018Haunted\u2019. Starts out as a sort of murder mystery thing, spirals into something much bigger. Also, poor Tony is so screwed up in the head but what\u2019s new. Definitely read this one</p><p>#29-32- \u2018With Iron Hands\u2019. Basically, an entire arc of Tony feeling guilty about his past?? Pretty much. There\u2019s also a terrorist and a giant weapon and more fun stuff. The last you\u2019ll see of Tony for the volume bc stuff goes down in the Secret Invasion event and War Machine takes over for the last 3 issues of the title. Wish I could be of help in regards to Secret Invasion, but I haven\u2019t actually read it because I haven\u2019t been able to find it. Just, idk, google search the plot of Secret Invasion like I did and you should be able to get by</p><p><b>Invincible Iron Man (2008) AKA Other Volume 4:</b></p><p>Okay lots of comics fans think this is one of the best Iron Man runs in history and I respect their opinions and perhaps you will share them but I\u2019m gonna cut to the chase here: I am not one of those people. Look, I read all 62 issues so I have a fair opinion, and I\u2019m just not a huge fan. Matt Fraction is writing and Salvador Larroca is drawing. In my experience, the stories drag on and it gets to the point where you\u2019re just bored. I think I read the 89 issues of volume 3 faster than I read the 62 issues of this because I was just so bored with it. Also, I\u2019m really not a fan of Larroca\u2019s work on the book. I really disliked the way he drew Tony and the more I looked at it, it almost made me&hellip;uncomfortable? Some of his art is kind of gross imo. Plus, I didn\u2019t love Fraction\u2019s Tony characterization. I can\u2019t quite articulate why, it just didn\u2019t sit nicely w me. There were some moments where I thought \u201coh yeah that\u2019s Correct\u201d but many other moments where I thought \u201cNo Why Did You Write That\u201d. He was good at writing some wild and intricate stories but sometimes I felt that character got lost in the midst of the action. That\u2019s just me though, you might really like Fraction\u2019s run, and there is some stuff worth pointing out.</p><p>#1-6- \u2018The Five Nightmares\u2019. A fairly iconic modern Iron Man story. Tony\u2019s worst nightmare comes true when the son of Obadiah Stane uses Stark tech to cause absolutely horrific acts of terrorism. It gets pretty serious, but it sets the groundwork for this entire era of Iron Man. As far as Fraction stories go for me, it\u2019s one of the better ones. </p><p>#7- Five Nightmares Epilogue. A team-up of sorts with Spider-Man that I actually genuinely think you should read, especially for the ending (and because Peter &amp; Tony clearly wish they could be buddies again in this post-Civil War world).</p><p>#8-19- Okay it\u2019s really long but I remember it stood out to me, all I remember is that it\u2019s basically Tony Stark Brain Annihilation over the course of 12 issues and it hurts like heecckkk. Actually I\u2019m gonna say definitely read this one. Also Rescue happens and that\u2019s A Thing you should know about. Stuff gets fixed in the next arc, #20-24, but it\u2019s not worth recommending imo so don\u2019t read this if you\u2019re gonna read it but if you\u2019re not just know that SPOILER SPOILER Tony is fine except he accidentally erased Civil War from his memory (god I wish I could do that). SPOILER OVER</p><p>I think I\u2019m gonna end it there for Fraction issues of interest. There\u2019s probably more in there I should be recommending but I just. Can\u2019t be bothered to comb through Fraction\u2019s volume sorryyyyy I\u2019m just not a fan</p><p><b>Iron Man (2012):</b></p><p>So this run is by Kieron Gillen and I don\u2019t really want to recommend anything from it. I didn\u2019t love it as a whole. Gillen laid way to heavily into the idea of \u201cTony Stark is a walking ego\u201d. The stories were kind of interesting in theory but I thought the execution was mediocre for some reason. Although, not necessarily the art but specifically the coloring was nice- very vibrant. The actual art was by Greg Land who comic fans really seem to hate. I didn\u2019t think his work on this was too bad idk. Again I don\u2019t really want to recommend anything so there\u2019s only one thing I\u2019m putting on here and it\u2019s:</p><p>#9-17- \u201cThe Secret Origin of Tony Stark\u201d. So here\u2019s the thing. Kieron Gillen said to himself \u201cI need to do something that turns Tony Stark\u2019s identity on its head. I need to redefine him\u201d. And he actually kind of succeeded in that. And it\u2019s actually annoying and it actually feels like something that should be retconned\u2026. but hasn\u2019t been?? And since it hasn\u2019t been, it\u2019s going to be important going forward so you should probably know about it. You could also just google it.</p><p><b>Invincible Iron (2015) by Man-Brian Michael Bendis</b></p><p>Yes, the infamous BMB. So, what\u2019s the truth about his run on Iron Man? Is the amount of hate warranted? Well\u2026that\u2019ll be for you to decide. Personally, I think it was generally&hellip;meh. Not necessarily terrible just. Meh. Many fanboys act like this run is the bane of their existence and I don\u2019t think I dislike it to that extent at all. I mean, it gets boring after a while, but the good moments are really enjoyable and I think it\u2019s worth reading. Bendis\u2019 characterization was sometimes weird because it felt notably inconsistent. However, the moments when he nailed it, he really did nail it. His Tony is a bit of a dork, a bit of a hot mess, a little vulnerable, and the moments when that\u2019s at the forefront are great. There\u2019s also some notable stuff going on here- Civil War 2 falls under this era (I hate it less than the first one but Marvel could do 50 Civil War events and I will probably not like any of them), and so does Riri Williams (who I love, just to get that opinion over with). Finding recs for this era is kind of weird for me because the things that stood out were almost never actual issues or stories, but rather specific character moments, so like, the volume is only 14 issues so tbh you can just trudge through them all and savor the good moments, but I\u2019ll try to pull some recs out for ya</p><p>#2, #3- just for some character moments. These two are a part of a larger arc so it might be a little confusing to read them on their own but who cares</p><p>#4, #5- Tony fights ninjas and visits kids at a hospital and MJ Watson &amp; Doctor Strange make appearances so it\u2019s kinda cool idk</p><p>#9-11- only because you meet Miss Riri Williams, the other parts won\u2019t make sense since it\u2019s in the middle of an arc but eh. Honestly the actual story didn\u2019t strike me as being very special so like unless you\u2019re into it you <i>can</i> just skim for the parts that Riri is in since she\u2019ll be important later</p><p>Aaaand CIVIL WAR 2 </p><p>Civil War II #0-8- okay I don\u2019t dislike it as strongly as I dislike the first CW but I still?? Don\u2019t like it?? But something really important to Tony\u2019s stories happens at the end and Tony is one of the main characters in the event so like. You should read it. The main problem I remember is that the pace felt so <i>slow</i>. This event is Iron Man vs Captain Marvel which kinda hurt me bc of how much I loved them from 1998\u2019s volume but it\u2019s fine!! They never address their past in the actual event but there\u2019s a tie-in that does so that\u2019s good I guess. Just get through it idk what to tell you</p><p>Back to Invincible Iron Man</p><p>#12, #13, #14- tie-ins to Civil War II. #12 and #13 I think come after CW2 #2?? Maybe?? And I think #14 comes after CW2 #6?? Anyway #14 actually acknowledges Tony &amp; Carol\u2019s past so you should give that a read while going through the event. </p><p><b>Invincible Iron Man (2016)</b></p><p>Sooo some Serious Stuff happened in Civil War II that\u2019s going to have an effect that lasts a while. I don\u2019t wanna spoil it, though. When you do get to the end of CW2, you can rest assured that Tony will still have a major presence as a character in this title, but Riri Williams takes the spotlight. Opinions on her are mixed, I personally love her. This, like its 2015 sister, can honestly just be read all the way through, it\u2019s only 19 issues, but I\u2019ll try to find stuff. Also, Tony &amp; Riri\u2019s banter is ALWAYS golden so just read to enjoy it tbh. On we go!</p><p>#1, #2- gives you the background on Riri now that she\u2019s taking center stage. She\u2019s just so darn endearing.</p><p>#11- It\u2019s basically an issue about everyone reflecting on how Tony is a good person and different from how the public perceives him. He holds orphaned babies from around the world. It\u2019s good stuff.</p><p>#593-600- the numbering changed, there\u2019s obviously not actually 600 issues lol. So yes this is kind of long for an arc, but it\u2019s important because it resolves what happened to Tony in Civil War 2. I remember getting bored with it after a few issues, like it wasn\u2019t bad I just remember it feeling slow. Idk. It\u2019s important. Just read it.</p><p><b>Stuff that I don\u2019t think is worth your time:</b></p><p>Invincible Iron Man volume 2 (1996)- I think Marvel was doing some kind of reboot or something because Iron Man\u2019s origin was redone as well as The Hulk\u2019s. It\u2019s amazing how a run that was only 13 issues felt like such a large waste of my time. I didn\u2019t think there was anything of note. I basically don\u2019t even remember what happened in it. Also the sexualization of women was so casual and constant on top of the run not being particularly remarkable so yeah don\u2019t waste your time \u00a0</p><p>Superior Iron Man (2015)- I dislike the idea of this so much that I don\u2019t even want to explain it ugh it\u2019s a spin off of an event called Axis that involved some psychic type stuff that altered the personalities of those involved, boosting Tony\u2019s worst qualities and making him evil. Marvel then decided to make a series about it and it\u2019s only 9 issues but wow it\u2019s amazing how hard it can be for me to get through 9 issues. I could barely read it I just so strongly dislike this idea ok so basically Evil Tony creates Extremis 3.0 which is an app that lets a person make themselves physically into the person they wish they were (In the pages of Axis, Tony personally made himself not an alcoholic because that\u2019s not disrespecting an incredibly important character detail and there was one particularly awful panel of him drinking alcohol in front of a crowd of cheering people and saying \u201cI missed you, sweetheart\u201d). He is testing this app on San Francisco and effectively creates two classes of people- the \u201cperfect\u201d people who could access the app and the \u201cimperfect\u201d people who can\u2019t and that goes about as well as you\u2019d think. Then he makes it obscenely expensive to use which also goes about as well as you\u2019d think. And more stuff happens. Here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m sure many people thought the concept of a villainous Tony Stark was cool, but I just don\u2019t like the implications of it. The way it\u2019s written kind of gives the idea that, with his personality, Tony could easily become a villain. Given that some people already think of Tony Stark as a villain, reading it just made me cringe. And the WORST thing about it is that, while this is a result of Axis, it\u2019s still Tony himself. According to the writers, he has \u201csurrendered to his id and his legendary ego\u201d (god I\u2019m about to gag) after the mind-altering events of Axis brought those things out in him. Despite my qualms, was the book well-written? I will never be able to read it that objectively, so I can\u2019t say. But clearly, as you can see by the size of this here rant (sorry), I dislike the very idea of it enough to put it on my \u201cdo not touch\u201d list.</p><p>Okay. Wow. I finally did it. Wow. Six months and it\u2019s done. </p><p>I am simply the mentor figure in your hero\u2019s journey. As you get used to navigating comics and reading orders, you\u2019ll find it easier to venture out, and there\u2019s so many ways to go. A character crossed over into something you read and you liked them a lot? Look up their reading order. A writer or artist really impressed you? Do a google search and find what else they\u2019ve worked on. There\u2019s a whole world of comics out there. Go have some fun.</p><p>I leave you with 3 rules of being a comic fan:</p><p>1. No one hates comics more than comic book readers. We\u2019re bitter because we care. You\u2019ll be like a jaded war veteran who writes a thousand word rant about why a certain author\u2019s mischaracterization of your fave offended you personally way faster than you\u2019d think.</p><p>2. Follow the trail of what interests you and, while acknowledging what may be widely believed, proudly own your personal opinions.</p><p>3. It\u2019s addictive. Embrace it. You start with one issue, and before you know it, you\u2019ve read 200 issues and know 20 years of history on one character in less than a year. That might be how it goes for you. Just go with it.</p><p>Happy reading!</p>",

(If you are on mobile\u2026I am so, so sorry about this)</p>[[MORE]]<h2>Short version (the recommendation-y part)</h2><p><b>Recs because I like them:</b></p><p>Iron Man Volume 3 (1998)- #1-25 (my actual absolute FAVORITE RUN of all time and my number one recommendation. It\u2019s by Kurt Busiek, Roger Stern, and Sean Chen), #26-30, #62-63, #73-78. Iron Man Volume 4 (2005) #1-35. \u00a0Invincible Iron Man (2008) spanned many years so you should read at least some, and it has many fans, but I am not one of them, so I\u2019m not gonna rec too much. Issues #1-6 and its epilogue, #7, are worth a read and the arc spanning #8-19 is probably the best from the era, I would say that I enjoyed that arc. Next is Brian Michael Bendis\u2019 stuff, which has a pretty bad rep and while I don\u2019t hate it as much as others do, I wouldn\u2019t say I love it. It is, however, the most recent completed run &amp; important stuff happens, and there\u2019s some good stuff here and there, so yeah. I don\u2019t really have any specific recs from here\u2026just read the whole thing and see what you get out of it or scroll down to the guide section and see the highlights I picked out. Invincible Iron Man (2015) #1-25, and Invincible Iron Man (2016) #1-600 (they changed the numbering halfway through, it\u2019s not 600 issues it\u2019s only I think 19).</p><p><b>Recs because important stuff happens even if I don\u2019t necessarily like them:</b></p><p>Civil War I (occurs during the Iron Man run starting in 2005), Civil War II (occurs during Brian Michael Bendis era), Iron Man (2012) #9-17 \u201cThe Secret Origin of Tony Stark.\u201d</p><h2>Long version (the guide-y part)</h2><p>First off, I\u2019m going to tell you that my suggested starting points are Invincible Iron Man (1998) which was my starting point, and Invincible Iron Man (2005). Much more on those below.</p><p>I haven\u2019t read Mr. Stark\u2019s classic adventures yet because there\u2019s a daunting number of them and I still need to find a starting point, so we\u2019re gonna start with\u2026</p><p><b>Volume 3 (1998):</b></p><p>Okay I have SO MUCH to say here because I\u2019d die for this volume!! It\u2019s considered by many to be nothing special but there\u2019s a lot to appreciate if you\u2019re a fan of Tony in the way that many are here on tumblr- caring about character development &amp; character moments first and foremost. I\u2019ll break down my favorites for ya</p><p>#1- does a good job of setting the tone for Tony and this era of Invincible Iron Man. Some nice Tony character details are in there. Volume 3 is started with Kurt Busiek writing (later joined by Roger Stern) and Sean Chen on pencils. I LOVED this team, this is my FAVORITE run of Iron Man that I\u2019ve read, PLEASE read all 25 issues. I thought Busiek understood Tony really well and I just loved the way Chen drew Tony (and everything else), and their first issue is surprisingly enjoyable for mostly existing to set the groundwork for a fresh start.</p><p>#4-5- I think this is where the run starts to kick into gear. Tony\u2019s on-and-off girlfriend for the era, Rumiko, is introduced and she\u2019s fun (but as the years went on, deserved much better writing). Tony kicks some butt &amp; is a hero.</p><p>#6- an awesome Iron Man/Black Widow team up. It shows a really nice friendship between Tony &amp; Nat. Also, Nat kicks butt &amp; it\u2019s great</p><p>I\u2019m recommending every issue that builds Tony\u2019s relationship with Carol Danvers (at this time, she was Warbird, not Captain Marvel). #7, #11-12, #18, #19, #21, and #23-25. Their storyline details Tony\u2019s endeavors to help Carol overcome alcoholism. At least read the Carol parts of the issues she\u2019s only in a few panels of. Major highlight of the Iron Man comics I\u2019ve read. Also- knowing this background will definitely make Civil War II have more weight</p><p>#8-12- Tony gets the actual daylights beaten out of him and then some, leading into a compelling 2-issue Mandarin arc, this then leads into an interesting 2-issue team up with Warbird that gives us an answer as to why his injuries were so bad. It hurts but it\u2019s good</p><p>#13- an actually really compelling single-issue story that involves some trippy, creepy mind control stuff and takes a look into Tony\u2019s head- specifically questioning whether or not being Iron Man has become an addiction. You can\u2019t tell yet but I\u2019m trying my hardest to not recommend every single issue</p><p>#26-30- The Mask in the Iron Man arc. This is the first issue without Busiek writing- Joe Quesada steps in and it\u2019s good stuff. It\u2019s also Sean Chen\u2019s last arc. It starts with Tony punching a guy in the face to protect Rumiko but getting punched back and having to wear a nose splint- it\u2019s really cute. Then Tony and Ru run into relationship problems. Then the Iron Man armor becomes sentient, basically falls in love with Tony, and kidnaps him on a remote island. Wait-what? Yeah, it\u2019s really weird in hindsight, but while you\u2019re reading it, it sure does pull you in. One of the biggest standouts of the whole era and something of an instant classic. Also, the first few pages of #31 give you a little aftermath.</p><p>#37-40- this wasn\u2019t my favorite arc but I\u2019m recommending it just because of how wild it ends up being. These were the days when IIM wasn\u2019t afraid to have a big imagination. And I mean big, like, who thought of this? Well, Frank Tieri is writing at this point (he\u2019s okay, not my favorite of the volume), and Alitha Martinez &amp; Paul Ryan are on pencils (it\u2019s fine, but you\u2019ll miss Sean Chen) (you\u2019ll always miss Sean Chen). Also, a major player in this arc is Tiberius Stone so maybe read it to know who he is.</p><p>#50- \u201cTinman\u201d. Issue 50 was meant to be a place for new readers to jump in. Mike Grell &amp; Michael Ryan are at the reigns as writer and artist. Grell\u2019s characterization was fairly solid, my favorite next to Busiek in this era. His version of Tony is more in touch with his emotions, I guess, than some like to characterize him. Sometimes he gets aggressive when he\u2019s angry but there\u2019s also a lot of really sweet moments and they portray him as doing a lot of good, like funding a rehab/safehouse for kids on the street. Grell\u2019s stories are generally grittier and more violent but Tony himself doesn\u2019t really take a dark turn. Issue #50 has both action and a VERY SOFT Tony, definitely recommend it</p><p>#53-55- \u201cBook of the Ten Rings\u201d. Again, it\u2019s grittier than the stuff that came before it, but it\u2019s good. Once the main story wraps up, something really important happens at the end. Also, it\u2019s important to note here for people that weren\u2019t previously into comics that at this point, Pepper and Happy are a thing, not Pepper and Tony as seen in the MCU</p><p>#59-61- \u201cIn Shining Armor\u201d. Tony travels back to Medieval times and it\u2019s not exactly a good time for him but it\u2019s a wild time for us. Gotta love a good old fashioned time travel arc</p><p>#62-63- \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get\u201d. Oh god PLEASE read this one, if you only listen to one of my post-Busiek &amp; Chen recs this is the one, the Tony content is so precious</p><p>#73-78- \u201cThe Best Defense\u201d. The arc detailing Tony\u2019s journey to becoming Secretary of Defense because yes, that happened. A very interesting concept to watch Tony go through and one of the most notable stories in this era.</p><p><b>Volume 4 (2005):</b></p><p>This is the last of what I consider the Really Good Stuff (except for Civil War, but we\u2019ll get there). These comics defined Tony Stark as we know him today, and you\u2019ll notice that MCU Tony was definitely influenced by them. If you\u2019re starting here, it\u2019ll be Iron Man as you basically already know it. If you\u2019re coming here off of Volume 3, then you\u2019ll notice the tone of not just the stories but of Tony himself get darker. For whatever reason, writers looked at Tony and said \u201clet\u2019s find ways to bring his morals into question bc that\u2019s Interesting!\u201d It\u2019s not bad (the Iron Man title, that is- Civil War is bad) but it doesn\u2019t really reflect what came before it, I guess. I\u2019m recommending all 35 issues bc why not but I\u2019ll break it down for ya &amp; make sure to point out my favorites </p><p>#1-6- \u201cExtremis\u201d. A must read. One of the most iconic Iron Man stories in 21st century comic history. It\u2019s on everyone\u2019s list. You are, as an Iron Man fan looking to get into IM comics, legally obligated to read this. This would also be the arc where I believe the MCU looked for inspiration for Tony characterization. Also Extremis obviously ended up in the MCU but it\u2019s like way different in the MCU than in the source material</p><p>#7-12- \u201cExecute Program\u201d- Basically, Tony is screwed up post-Extremis. Poor guy. Please read this. Directly leads to Civil War\u2026</p><p>Civil War (2006) #1-7- Ugh. So. Civil War. In my personal opinion- not a fan. I actually like the movie MUCH better and imo the movie is the way this should have been written. Unfortunately, you\u2019ve gotta read it because it\u2019s an important event. You\u2019ll see people calling it \u201cTony Stark characterization murder\u201d and THAT\u2019S VALID. Like. Tony suddenly became\u2026a villain?? literally the worst?? under the poorly written guise of \u201cjust doing what I have to do\u201d but the stuff that happens\u2026.it just can\u2019t be explained with \u201cdoing what I have to do\u201d. Honestly it reads like the writers just wanted to pit Tony against Steve and didn\u2019t care about keeping him in character. Tony basically had to be turned into a villain to make the story work because In-Character Tony would not have fit their needs. It sucks and I don\u2019t want to recommend it but you have to read it because it affects so much that comes after it.</p><p>THE ONLY CIVIL WAR ANYTHING YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER are tie ins and oneshots and I will tell you a couple</p><p>Invincible Iron Man #13-14- IIM\u2019s CW tie ins. Issue 13 comes after CW #2, issue 14 after CW #5. Read these read these read these!!!!</p><p>Captain America/Iron Man: Casualties of War- oneshot to be read after Civil War #4. Tony offers Steve the chance to try and talk it out. Both explain their positions and a lot of comic history between them is brought up.</p><p>Civil War: The Confession: SO after CW, SPOILER SPOILER poor Steve is assassinated in Captain America #25 (it\u2019s actually more wild than that bc superheroes don\u2019t just die but whatever) and this is a oneshot with two halves, the first takes place after Steve is dead and is Tony-centric and I LITERALLY CRIED and the second takes place when Steve is imprisoned before he is killed. PLEASE read this</p><p>There\u2019s more tie ins involving Tony that you should read but I\u2019m sick of talking abt CW </p><p>BACK TO THE IRON MAN SOLO TITLE</p><p>Sooooo the title now changes from Invincible Iron Man to Iron Man: Director of SHIELD but it\u2019s the same book</p><p>#15-18- It\u2019s Tony\u2019s first story arc as Director and it ends up being kind of wild actually</p><p>#21-28- \u2018Haunted\u2019. Starts out as a sort of murder mystery thing, spirals into something much bigger. Also, poor Tony is so screwed up in the head but what\u2019s new. Definitely read this one</p><p>#29-32- \u2018With Iron Hands\u2019. Basically, an entire arc of Tony feeling guilty about his past?? Pretty much. There\u2019s also a terrorist and a giant weapon and more fun stuff. The last you\u2019ll see of Tony for the volume bc stuff goes down in the Secret Invasion event and War Machine takes over for the last 3 issues of the title. Wish I could be of help in regards to Secret Invasion, but I haven\u2019t actually read it because I haven\u2019t been able to find it. Just, idk, google search the plot of Secret Invasion like I did and you should be able to get by</p><p><b>Invincible Iron Man (2008) AKA Other Volume 4:</b></p><p>Okay lots of comics fans think this is one of the best Iron Man runs in history and I respect their opinions and perhaps you will share them but I\u2019m gonna cut to the chase here: I am not one of those people. Look, I read all 62 issues so I have a fair opinion, and I\u2019m just not a huge fan. Matt Fraction is writing and Salvador Larroca is drawing. In my experience, the stories drag on and it gets to the point where you\u2019re just bored. I think I read the 89 issues of volume 3 faster than I read the 62 issues of this because I was just so bored with it. Also, I\u2019m really not a fan of Larroca\u2019s work on the book. I really disliked the way he drew Tony and the more I looked at it, it almost made me\u2026uncomfortable? Some of his art is kind of gross imo. Plus, I didn\u2019t love Fraction\u2019s Tony characterization. I can\u2019t quite articulate why, it just didn\u2019t sit nicely w me. There were some moments where I thought \u201coh yeah that\u2019s Correct\u201d but many other moments where I thought \u201cNo Why Did You Write That\u201d. He was good at writing some wild and intricate stories but sometimes I felt that character got lost in the midst of the action. That\u2019s just me though, you might really like Fraction\u2019s run, and there is some stuff worth pointing out.</p><p>#1-6- \u2018The Five Nightmares\u2019. A fairly iconic modern Iron Man story. Tony\u2019s worst nightmare comes true when the son of Obadiah Stane uses Stark tech to cause absolutely horrific acts of terrorism. It gets pretty serious, but it sets the groundwork for this entire era of Iron Man. As far as Fraction stories go for me, it\u2019s one of the better ones. </p><p>#7- Five Nightmares Epilogue. A team-up of sorts with Spider-Man that I actually genuinely think you should read, especially for the ending (and because Peter &amp; Tony clearly wish they could be buddies again in this post-Civil War world).</p><p>#8-19- Okay it\u2019s really long but I remember it stood out to me, all I remember is that it\u2019s basically Tony Stark Brain Annihilation over the course of 12 issues and it hurts like heecckkk. Actually I\u2019m gonna say definitely read this one. Also Rescue happens and that\u2019s A Thing you should know about. Stuff gets fixed in the next arc, #20-24, but it\u2019s not worth recommending imo so don\u2019t read this if you\u2019re gonna read it but if you\u2019re not just know that SPOILER SPOILER Tony is fine except he accidentally erased Civil War from his memory (god I wish I could do that). SPOILER OVER</p><p>I think I\u2019m gonna end it there for Fraction issues of interest. There\u2019s probably more in there I should be recommending but I just. Can\u2019t be bothered to comb through Fraction\u2019s volume sorryyyyy I\u2019m just not a fan</p><p><b>Iron Man (2012):</b></p><p>So this run is by Kieron Gillen and I don\u2019t really want to recommend anything from it. I didn\u2019t love it as a whole. Gillen laid way to heavily into the idea of \u201cTony Stark is a walking ego\u201d. The stories were kind of interesting in theory but I thought the execution was mediocre for some reason. Although, not necessarily the art but specifically the coloring was nice- very vibrant. The actual art was by Greg Land who comic fans really seem to hate. I didn\u2019t think his work on this was too bad idk. Again I don\u2019t really want to recommend anything so there\u2019s only one thing I\u2019m putting on here and it\u2019s:</p><p>#9-17- \u201cThe Secret Origin of Tony Stark\u201d. So here\u2019s the thing. Kieron Gillen said to himself \u201cI need to do something that turns Tony Stark\u2019s identity on its head. I need to redefine him\u201d. And he actually kind of succeeded in that. And it\u2019s actually annoying and it actually feels like something that should be retconned\u2026. but hasn\u2019t been?? And since it hasn\u2019t been, it\u2019s going to be important going forward so you should probably know about it. You could also just google it.</p><p><b>Invincible Iron (2015) by Man-Brian Michael Bendis</b></p><p>Yes, the infamous BMB. So, what\u2019s the truth about his run on Iron Man? Is the amount of hate warranted? Well\u2026that\u2019ll be for you to decide. Personally, I think it was generally\u2026meh. Not necessarily terrible just. Meh. Many fanboys act like this run is the bane of their existence and I don\u2019t think I dislike it to that extent at all. I mean, it gets boring after a while, but the good moments are really enjoyable and I think it\u2019s worth reading. Bendis\u2019 characterization was sometimes weird because it felt notably inconsistent. However, the moments when he nailed it, he really did nail it. His Tony is a bit of a dork, a bit of a hot mess, a little vulnerable, and the moments when that\u2019s at the forefront are great. There\u2019s also some notable stuff going on here- Civil War 2 falls under this era (I hate it less than the first one but Marvel could do 50 Civil War events and I will probably not like any of them), and so does Riri Williams (who I love, just to get that opinion over with). Finding recs for this era is kind of weird for me because the things that stood out were almost never actual issues or stories, but rather specific character moments, so like, the volume is only 14 issues so tbh you can just trudge through them all and savor the good moments, but I\u2019ll try to pull some recs out for ya</p><p>#2, #3- just for some character moments. These two are a part of a larger arc so it might be a little confusing to read them on their own but who cares</p><p>#4, #5- Tony fights ninjas and visits kids at a hospital and MJ Watson &amp; Doctor Strange make appearances so it\u2019s kinda cool idk</p><p>#9-11- only because you meet Miss Riri Williams, the other parts won\u2019t make sense since it\u2019s in the middle of an arc but eh. Honestly the actual story didn\u2019t strike me as being very special so like unless you\u2019re into it you <i>can</i> just skim for the parts that Riri is in since she\u2019ll be important later</p><p>Aaaand CIVIL WAR 2 </p><p>Civil War II #0-8- okay I don\u2019t dislike it as strongly as I dislike the first CW but I still?? Don\u2019t like it?? But something really important to Tony\u2019s stories happens at the end and Tony is one of the main characters in the event so like. You should read it. The main problem I remember is that the pace felt so <i>slow</i>. This event is Iron Man vs Captain Marvel which kinda hurt me bc of how much I loved them from 1998\u2019s volume but it\u2019s fine!! They never address their past in the actual event but there\u2019s a tie-in that does so that\u2019s good I guess. Just get through it idk what to tell you</p><p>Back to Invincible Iron Man</p><p>#12, #13, #14- tie-ins to Civil War II. #12 and #13 I think come after CW2 #2?? Maybe?? And I think #14 comes after CW2 #6?? Anyway #14 actually acknowledges Tony &amp; Carol\u2019s past so you should give that a read while going through the event. </p><p><b>Invincible Iron Man (2016)</b></p><p>Sooo some Serious Stuff happened in Civil War II that\u2019s going to have an effect that lasts a while. I don\u2019t wanna spoil it, though. When you do get to the end of CW2, you can rest assured that Tony will still have a major presence as a character in this title, but Riri Williams takes the spotlight. Opinions on her are mixed, I personally love her. This, like its 2015 sister, can honestly just be read all the way through, it\u2019s only 19 issues, but I\u2019ll try to find stuff. Also, Tony &amp; Riri\u2019s banter is ALWAYS golden so just read to enjoy it tbh. On we go!</p><p>#1, #2- gives you the background on Riri now that she\u2019s taking center stage. She\u2019s just so darn endearing.</p><p>#11- It\u2019s basically an issue about everyone reflecting on how Tony is a good person and different from how the public perceives him. He holds orphaned babies from around the world. It\u2019s good stuff.</p><p>#593-600- the numbering changed, there\u2019s obviously not actually 600 issues lol. So yes this is kind of long for an arc, but it\u2019s important because it resolves what happened to Tony in Civil War 2. I remember getting bored with it after a few issues, like it wasn\u2019t bad I just remember it feeling slow. Idk. It\u2019s important. Just read it.</p><p><b>Stuff that I don\u2019t think is worth your time:</b></p><p>Invincible Iron Man volume 2 (1996)- I think Marvel was doing some kind of reboot or something because Iron Man\u2019s origin was redone as well as The Hulk\u2019s. It\u2019s amazing how a run that was only 13 issues felt like such a large waste of my time. I didn\u2019t think there was anything of note. I basically don\u2019t even remember what happened in it. Also the sexualization of women was so casual and constant on top of the run not being particularly remarkable so yeah don\u2019t waste your time \u00a0</p><p>Superior Iron Man (2015)- I dislike the idea of this so much that I don\u2019t even want to explain it ugh it\u2019s a spin off of an event called Axis that involved some psychic type stuff that altered the personalities of those involved, boosting Tony\u2019s worst qualities and making him evil. Marvel then decided to make a series about it and it\u2019s only 9 issues but wow it\u2019s amazing how hard it can be for me to get through 9 issues. I could barely read it I just so strongly dislike this idea ok so basically Evil Tony creates Extremis 3.0 which is an app that lets a person make themselves physically into the person they wish they were (In the pages of Axis, Tony personally made himself not an alcoholic because that\u2019s not disrespecting an incredibly important character detail and there was one particularly awful panel of him drinking alcohol in front of a crowd of cheering people and saying \u201cI missed you, sweetheart\u201d). He is testing this app on San Francisco and effectively creates two classes of people- the \u201cperfect\u201d people who could access the app and the \u201cimperfect\u201d people who can\u2019t and that goes about as well as you\u2019d think. Then he makes it obscenely expensive to use which also goes about as well as you\u2019d think. And more stuff happens. Here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m sure many people thought the concept of a villainous Tony Stark was cool, but I just don\u2019t like the implications of it. The way it\u2019s written kind of gives the idea that, with his personality, Tony could easily become a villain. Given that some people already think of Tony Stark as a villain, reading it just made me cringe. And the WORST thing about it is that, while this is a result of Axis, it\u2019s still Tony himself. According to the writers, he has \u201csurrendered to his id and his legendary ego\u201d (god I\u2019m about to gag) after the mind-altering events of Axis brought those things out in him. Despite my qualms, was the book well-written? I will never be able to read it that objectively, so I can\u2019t say. But clearly, as you can see by the size of this here rant (sorry), I dislike the very idea of it enough to put it on my \u201cdo not touch\u201d list.</p><p>Okay. Wow. I finally did it. Wow. Six months and it\u2019s done. </p><p>I am simply the mentor figure in your hero\u2019s journey. As you get used to navigating comics and reading orders, you\u2019ll find it easier to venture out, and there\u2019s so many ways to go. A character crossed over into something you read and you liked them a lot? Look up their reading order. A writer or artist really impressed you? Do a google search and find what else they\u2019ve worked on. There\u2019s a whole world of comics out there. Go have some fun.</p><p>I leave you with 3 rules of being a comic fan:</p><p>1. No one hates comics more than comic book readers. We\u2019re bitter because we care. You\u2019ll be like a jaded war veteran who writes a thousand word rant about why a certain author\u2019s mischaracterization of your fave offended you personally way faster than you\u2019d think.</p><p>2. Follow the trail of what interests you and, while acknowledging what may be widely believed, proudly own your personal opinions.</p><p>3. It\u2019s addictive. Embrace it. You start with one issue, and before you know it, you\u2019ve read 200 issues and know 20 years of history on one character in less than a year. That might be how it goes for you. Just go with it.</p><p>Happy reading!</p>",

(If you are on mobile\u2026I am so, so sorry about this)</p>[[MORE]]<h2>Short version (the recommendation-y part)</h2><p><b>Recs because I like them:</b></p><p>Iron Man Volume 3 (1998)- #1-25 (my actual absolute FAVORITE RUN of all time and my number one recommendation. It\u2019s by Kurt Busiek, Roger Stern, and Sean Chen), #26-30, #62-63, #73-78. Iron Man Volume 4 (2005) #1-35. \u00a0Invincible Iron Man (2008) spanned many years so you should read at least some, and it has many fans, but I am not one of them, so I\u2019m not gonna rec too much. Issues #1-6 and its epilogue, #7, are worth a read and the arc spanning #8-19 is probably the best from the era, I would say that I enjoyed that arc. Next is Brian Michael Bendis\u2019 stuff, which has a pretty bad rep and while I don\u2019t hate it as much as others do, I wouldn\u2019t say I love it. It is, however, the most recent completed run &amp; important stuff happens, and there\u2019s some good stuff here and there, so yeah. I don\u2019t really have any specific recs from here\u2026just read the whole thing and see what you get out of it or scroll down to the guide section and see the highlights I picked out. Invincible Iron Man (2015) #1-25, and Invincible Iron Man (2016) #1-600 (they changed the numbering halfway through, it\u2019s not 600 issues it\u2019s only I think 19).</p><p><b>Recs because important stuff happens even if I don\u2019t necessarily like them:</b></p><p>Civil War I (occurs during the Iron Man run starting in 2005), Civil War II (occurs during Brian Michael Bendis era), Iron Man (2012) #9-17 \u201cThe Secret Origin of Tony Stark.\u201d</p><h2>Long version (the guide-y part)</h2><p>First off, I\u2019m going to tell you that my suggested starting points are Invincible Iron Man (1998) which was my starting point, and Invincible Iron Man (2005). Much more on those below.</p><p>I haven\u2019t read Mr. Stark\u2019s classic adventures yet because there\u2019s a daunting number of them and I still need to find a starting point, so we\u2019re gonna start with\u2026</p><p><b>Volume 3 (1998):</b></p><p>Okay I have SO MUCH to say here because I\u2019d die for this volume!! It\u2019s considered by many to be nothing special but there\u2019s a lot to appreciate if you\u2019re a fan of Tony in the way that many are here on tumblr- caring about character development &amp; character moments first and foremost. I\u2019ll break down my favorites for ya</p><p>#1- does a good job of setting the tone for Tony and this era of Invincible Iron Man. Some nice Tony character details are in there. Volume 3 is started with Kurt Busiek writing (later joined by Roger Stern) and Sean Chen on pencils. I LOVED this team, this is my FAVORITE run of Iron Man that I\u2019ve read, PLEASE read all 25 issues. I thought Busiek understood Tony really well and I just loved the way Chen drew Tony (and everything else), and their first issue is surprisingly enjoyable for mostly existing to set the groundwork for a fresh start.</p><p>#4-5- I think this is where the run starts to kick into gear. Tony\u2019s on-and-off girlfriend for the era, Rumiko, is introduced and she\u2019s fun (but as the years went on, deserved much better writing). Tony kicks some butt &amp; is a hero.</p><p>#6- an awesome Iron Man/Black Widow team up. It shows a really nice friendship between Tony &amp; Nat. Also, Nat kicks butt &amp; it\u2019s great</p><p>I\u2019m recommending every issue that builds Tony\u2019s relationship with Carol Danvers (at this time, she was Warbird, not Captain Marvel). #7, #11-12, #18, #19, #21, and #23-25. Their storyline details Tony\u2019s endeavors to help Carol overcome alcoholism. At least read the Carol parts of the issues she\u2019s only in a few panels of. Major highlight of the Iron Man comics I\u2019ve read. Also- knowing this background will definitely make Civil War II have more weight</p><p>#8-12- Tony gets the actual daylights beaten out of him and then some, leading into a compelling 2-issue Mandarin arc, this then leads into an interesting 2-issue team up with Warbird that gives us an answer as to why his injuries were so bad. It hurts but it\u2019s good</p><p>#13- an actually really compelling single-issue story that involves some trippy, creepy mind control stuff and takes a look into Tony\u2019s head- specifically questioning whether or not being Iron Man has become an addiction. You can\u2019t tell yet but I\u2019m trying my hardest to not recommend every single issue</p><p>#26-30- The Mask in the Iron Man arc. This is the first issue without Busiek writing- Joe Quesada steps in and it\u2019s good stuff. It\u2019s also Sean Chen\u2019s last arc. It starts with Tony punching a guy in the face to protect Rumiko but getting punched back and having to wear a nose splint- it\u2019s really cute. Then Tony and Ru run into relationship problems. Then the Iron Man armor becomes sentient, basically falls in love with Tony, and kidnaps him on a remote island. Wait-what? Yeah, it\u2019s really weird in hindsight, but while you\u2019re reading it, it sure does pull you in. One of the biggest standouts of the whole era and something of an instant classic. Also, the first few pages of #31 give you a little aftermath.</p><p>#37-40- this wasn\u2019t my favorite arc but I\u2019m recommending it just because of how wild it ends up being. These were the days when IIM wasn\u2019t afraid to have a big imagination. And I mean big, like, who thought of this? Well, Frank Tieri is writing at this point (he\u2019s okay, not my favorite of the volume), and Alitha Martinez &amp; Paul Ryan are on pencils (it\u2019s fine, but you\u2019ll miss Sean Chen) (you\u2019ll always miss Sean Chen). Also, a major player in this arc is Tiberius Stone so maybe read it to know who he is.</p><p>#50- \u201cTinman\u201d. Issue 50 was meant to be a place for new readers to jump in. Mike Grell &amp; Michael Ryan are at the reigns as writer and artist. Grell\u2019s characterization was fairly solid, my favorite next to Busiek in this era. His version of Tony is more in touch with his emotions, I guess, than some like to characterize him. Sometimes he gets aggressive when he\u2019s angry but there\u2019s also a lot of really sweet moments and they portray him as doing a lot of good, like funding a rehab/safehouse for kids on the street. Grell\u2019s stories are generally grittier and more violent but Tony himself doesn\u2019t really take a dark turn. Issue #50 has both action and a VERY SOFT Tony, definitely recommend it</p><p>#53-55- \u201cBook of the Ten Rings\u201d. Again, it\u2019s grittier than the stuff that came before it, but it\u2019s good. Once the main story wraps up, something really important happens at the end. Also, it\u2019s important to note here for people that weren\u2019t previously into comics that at this point, Pepper and Happy are a thing, not Pepper and Tony as seen in the MCU</p><p>#59-61- \u201cIn Shining Armor\u201d. Tony travels back to Medieval times and it\u2019s not exactly a good time for him but it\u2019s a wild time for us. Gotta love a good old fashioned time travel arc</p><p>#62-63- \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get\u201d. Oh god PLEASE read this one, if you only listen to one of my post-Busiek &amp; Chen recs this is the one, the Tony content is so precious</p><p>#73-78- \u201cThe Best Defense\u201d. The arc detailing Tony\u2019s journey to becoming Secretary of Defense because yes, that happened. A very interesting concept to watch Tony go through and one of the most notable stories in this era.</p><p><b>Volume 4 (2005):</b></p><p>This is the last of what I consider the Really Good Stuff (except for Civil War, but we\u2019ll get there). These comics defined Tony Stark as we know him today, and you\u2019ll notice that MCU Tony was definitely influenced by them. If you\u2019re starting here, it\u2019ll be Iron Man as you basically already know it. If you\u2019re coming here off of Volume 3, then you\u2019ll notice the tone of not just the stories but of Tony himself get darker. For whatever reason, writers looked at Tony and said \u201clet\u2019s find ways to bring his morals into question bc that\u2019s Interesting!\u201d It\u2019s not bad (the Iron Man title, that is- Civil War is bad) but it doesn\u2019t really reflect what came before it, I guess. I\u2019m recommending all 35 issues bc why not but I\u2019ll break it down for ya &amp; make sure to point out my favorites </p><p>#1-6- \u201cExtremis\u201d. A must read. One of the most iconic Iron Man stories in 21st century comic history. It\u2019s on everyone\u2019s list. You are, as an Iron Man fan looking to get into IM comics, legally obligated to read this. This would also be the arc where I believe the MCU looked for inspiration for Tony characterization. Also Extremis obviously ended up in the MCU but it\u2019s like way different in the MCU than in the source material</p><p>#7-12- \u201cExecute Program\u201d- Basically, Tony is screwed up post-Extremis. Poor guy. Please read this. Directly leads to Civil War\u2026</p><p>Civil War (2006) #1-7- Ugh. So. Civil War. In my personal opinion- not a fan. I actually like the movie MUCH better and imo the movie is the way this should have been written. Unfortunately, you\u2019ve gotta read it because it\u2019s an important event. You\u2019ll see people calling it \u201cTony Stark characterization murder\u201d and THAT\u2019S VALID. Like. Tony suddenly became\u2026a villain?? literally the worst?? under the poorly written guise of \u201cjust doing what I have to do\u201d but the stuff that happens\u2026.it just can\u2019t be explained with \u201cdoing what I have to do\u201d. Honestly it reads like the writers just wanted to pit Tony against Steve and didn\u2019t care about keeping him in character. Tony basically had to be turned into a villain to make the story work because In-Character Tony would not have fit their needs. It sucks and I don\u2019t want to recommend it but you have to read it because it affects so much that comes after it.</p><p>THE ONLY CIVIL WAR ANYTHING YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER are tie ins and oneshots and I will tell you a couple</p><p>Invincible Iron Man #13-14- IIM\u2019s CW tie ins. Issue 13 comes after CW #2, issue 14 after CW #5. Read these read these read these!!!!</p><p>Captain America/Iron Man: Casualties of War- oneshot to be read after Civil War #4. Tony offers Steve the chance to try and talk it out. Both explain their positions and a lot of comic history between them is brought up.</p><p>Civil War: The Confession: SO after CW, SPOILER SPOILER poor Steve is assassinated in Captain America #25 (it\u2019s actually more wild than that bc superheroes don\u2019t just die but whatever) and this is a oneshot with two halves, the first takes place after Steve is dead and is Tony-centric and I LITERALLY CRIED and the second takes place when Steve is imprisoned before he is killed. PLEASE read this</p><p>There\u2019s more tie ins involving Tony that you should read but I\u2019m sick of talking abt CW </p><p>BACK TO THE IRON MAN SOLO TITLE</p><p>Sooooo the title now changes from Invincible Iron Man to Iron Man: Director of SHIELD but it\u2019s the same book</p><p>#15-18- It\u2019s Tony\u2019s first story arc as Director and it ends up being kind of wild actually</p><p>#21-28- \u2018Haunted\u2019. Starts out as a sort of murder mystery thing, spirals into something much bigger. Also, poor Tony is so screwed up in the head but what\u2019s new. Definitely read this one</p><p>#29-32- \u2018With Iron Hands\u2019. Basically, an entire arc of Tony feeling guilty about his past?? Pretty much. There\u2019s also a terrorist and a giant weapon and more fun stuff. The last you\u2019ll see of Tony for the volume bc stuff goes down in the Secret Invasion event and War Machine takes over for the last 3 issues of the title. Wish I could be of help in regards to Secret Invasion, but I haven\u2019t actually read it because I haven\u2019t been able to find it. Just, idk, google search the plot of Secret Invasion like I did and you should be able to get by</p><p><b>Invincible Iron Man (2008) AKA Other Volume 4:</b></p><p>Okay lots of comics fans think this is one of the best Iron Man runs in history and I respect their opinions and perhaps you will share them but I\u2019m gonna cut to the chase here: I am not one of those people. Look, I read all 62 issues so I have a fair opinion, and I\u2019m just not a huge fan. Matt Fraction is writing and Salvador Larroca is drawing. In my experience, the stories drag on and it gets to the point where you\u2019re just bored. I think I read the 89 issues of volume 3 faster than I read the 62 issues of this because I was just so bored with it. Also, I\u2019m really not a fan of Larroca\u2019s work on the book. I really disliked the way he drew Tony and the more I looked at it, it almost made me\u2026uncomfortable? Some of his art is kind of gross imo. Plus, I didn\u2019t love Fraction\u2019s Tony characterization. I can\u2019t quite articulate why, it just didn\u2019t sit nicely w me. There were some moments where I thought \u201coh yeah that\u2019s Correct\u201d but many other moments where I thought \u201cNo Why Did You Write That\u201d. He was good at writing some wild and intricate stories but sometimes I felt that character got lost in the midst of the action. That\u2019s just me though, you might really like Fraction\u2019s run, and there is some stuff worth pointing out.</p><p>#1-6- \u2018The Five Nightmares\u2019. A fairly iconic modern Iron Man story. Tony\u2019s worst nightmare comes true when the son of Obadiah Stane uses Stark tech to cause absolutely horrific acts of terrorism. It gets pretty serious, but it sets the groundwork for this entire era of Iron Man. As far as Fraction stories go for me, it\u2019s one of the better ones. </p><p>#7- Five Nightmares Epilogue. A team-up of sorts with Spider-Man that I actually genuinely think you should read, especially for the ending (and because Peter &amp; Tony clearly wish they could be buddies again in this post-Civil War world).</p><p>#8-19- Okay it\u2019s really long but I remember it stood out to me, all I remember is that it\u2019s basically Tony Stark Brain Annihilation over the course of 12 issues and it hurts like heecckkk. Actually I\u2019m gonna say definitely read this one. Also Rescue happens and that\u2019s A Thing you should know about. Stuff gets fixed in the next arc, #20-24, but it\u2019s not worth recommending imo so don\u2019t read this if you\u2019re gonna read it but if you\u2019re not just know that SPOILER SPOILER Tony is fine except he accidentally erased Civil War from his memory (god I wish I could do that). SPOILER OVER</p><p>I think I\u2019m gonna end it there for Fraction issues of interest. There\u2019s probably more in there I should be recommending but I just. Can\u2019t be bothered to comb through Fraction\u2019s volume sorryyyyy I\u2019m just not a fan</p><p><b>Iron Man (2012):</b></p><p>So this run is by Kieron Gillen and I don\u2019t really want to recommend anything from it. I didn\u2019t love it as a whole. Gillen laid way to heavily into the idea of \u201cTony Stark is a walking ego\u201d. The stories were kind of interesting in theory but I thought the execution was mediocre for some reason. Although, not necessarily the art but specifically the coloring was nice- very vibrant. The actual art was by Greg Land who comic fans really seem to hate. I didn\u2019t think his work on this was too bad idk. Again I don\u2019t really want to recommend anything so there\u2019s only one thing I\u2019m putting on here and it\u2019s:</p><p>#9-17- \u201cThe Secret Origin of Tony Stark\u201d. So here\u2019s the thing. Kieron Gillen said to himself \u201cI need to do something that turns Tony Stark\u2019s identity on its head. I need to redefine him\u201d. And he actually kind of succeeded in that. And it\u2019s actually annoying and it actually feels like something that should be retconned\u2026. but hasn\u2019t been?? And since it hasn\u2019t been, it\u2019s going to be important going forward so you should probably know about it. You could also just google it.</p><p><b>Invincible Iron (2015) by Man-Brian Michael Bendis</b></p><p>Yes, the infamous BMB. So, what\u2019s the truth about his run on Iron Man? Is the amount of hate warranted? Well\u2026that\u2019ll be for you to decide. Personally, I think it was generally\u2026meh. Not necessarily terrible just. Meh. Many fanboys act like this run is the bane of their existence and I don\u2019t think I dislike it to that extent at all. I mean, it gets boring after a while, but the good moments are really enjoyable and I think it\u2019s worth reading. Bendis\u2019 characterization was sometimes weird because it felt notably inconsistent. However, the moments when he nailed it, he really did nail it. His Tony is a bit of a dork, a bit of a hot mess, a little vulnerable, and the moments when that\u2019s at the forefront are great. There\u2019s also some notable stuff going on here- Civil War 2 falls under this era (I hate it less than the first one but Marvel could do 50 Civil War events and I will probably not like any of them), and so does Riri Williams (who I love, just to get that opinion over with). Finding recs for this era is kind of weird for me because the things that stood out were almost never actual issues or stories, but rather specific character moments, so like, the volume is only 14 issues so tbh you can just trudge through them all and savor the good moments, but I\u2019ll try to pull some recs out for ya</p><p>#2, #3- just for some character moments. These two are a part of a larger arc so it might be a little confusing to read them on their own but who cares</p><p>#4, #5- Tony fights ninjas and visits kids at a hospital and MJ Watson &amp; Doctor Strange make appearances so it\u2019s kinda cool idk</p><p>#9-11- only because you meet Miss Riri Williams, the other parts won\u2019t make sense since it\u2019s in the middle of an arc but eh. Honestly the actual story didn\u2019t strike me as being very special so like unless you\u2019re into it you <i>can</i> just skim for the parts that Riri is in since she\u2019ll be important later</p><p>Aaaand CIVIL WAR 2 </p><p>Civil War II #0-8- okay I don\u2019t dislike it as strongly as I dislike the first CW but I still?? Don\u2019t like it?? But something really important to Tony\u2019s stories happens at the end and Tony is one of the main characters in the event so like. You should read it. The main problem I remember is that the pace felt so <i>slow</i>. This event is Iron Man vs Captain Marvel which kinda hurt me bc of how much I loved them from 1998\u2019s volume but it\u2019s fine!! They never address their past in the actual event but there\u2019s a tie-in that does so that\u2019s good I guess. Just get through it idk what to tell you</p><p>Back to Invincible Iron Man</p><p>#12, #13, #14- tie-ins to Civil War II. #12 and #13 I think come after CW2 #2?? Maybe?? And I think #14 comes after CW2 #6?? Anyway #14 actually acknowledges Tony &amp; Carol\u2019s past so you should give that a read while going through the event. </p><p><b>Invincible Iron Man (2016)</b></p><p>Sooo some Serious Stuff happened in Civil War II that\u2019s going to have an effect that lasts a while. I don\u2019t wanna spoil it, though. When you do get to the end of CW2, you can rest assured that Tony will still have a major presence as a character in this title, but Riri Williams takes the spotlight. Opinions on her are mixed, I personally love her. This, like its 2015 sister, can honestly just be read all the way through, it\u2019s only 19 issues, but I\u2019ll try to find stuff. Also, Tony &amp; Riri\u2019s banter is ALWAYS golden so just read to enjoy it tbh. On we go!</p><p>#1, #2- gives you the background on Riri now that she\u2019s taking center stage. She\u2019s just so darn endearing.</p><p>#11- It\u2019s basically an issue about everyone reflecting on how Tony is a good person and different from how the public perceives him. He holds orphaned babies from around the world. It\u2019s good stuff.</p><p>#593-600- the numbering changed, there\u2019s obviously not actually 600 issues lol. So yes this is kind of long for an arc, but it\u2019s important because it resolves what happened to Tony in Civil War 2. I remember getting bored with it after a few issues, like it wasn\u2019t bad I just remember it feeling slow. Idk. It\u2019s important. Just read it.</p><p><b>Stuff that I don\u2019t think is worth your time:</b></p><p>Invincible Iron Man volume 2 (1996)- I think Marvel was doing some kind of reboot or something because Iron Man\u2019s origin was redone as well as The Hulk\u2019s. It\u2019s amazing how a run that was only 13 issues felt like such a large waste of my time. I didn\u2019t think there was anything of note. I basically don\u2019t even remember what happened in it. Also the sexualization of women was so casual and constant on top of the run not being particularly remarkable so yeah don\u2019t waste your time \u00a0</p><p>Superior Iron Man (2015)- I dislike the idea of this so much that I don\u2019t even want to explain it ugh it\u2019s a spin off of an event called Axis that involved some psychic type stuff that altered the personalities of those involved, boosting Tony\u2019s worst qualities and making him evil. Marvel then decided to make a series about it and it\u2019s only 9 issues but wow it\u2019s amazing how hard it can be for me to get through 9 issues. I could barely read it I just so strongly dislike this idea ok so basically Evil Tony creates Extremis 3.0 which is an app that lets a person make themselves physically into the person they wish they were (In the pages of Axis, Tony personally made himself not an alcoholic because that\u2019s not disrespecting an incredibly important character detail and there was one particularly awful panel of him drinking alcohol in front of a crowd of cheering people and saying \u201cI missed you, sweetheart\u201d). He is testing this app on San Francisco and effectively creates two classes of people- the \u201cperfect\u201d people who could access the app and the \u201cimperfect\u201d people who can\u2019t and that goes about as well as you\u2019d think. Then he makes it obscenely expensive to use which also goes about as well as you\u2019d think. And more stuff happens. Here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m sure many people thought the concept of a villainous Tony Stark was cool, but I just don\u2019t like the implications of it. The way it\u2019s written kind of gives the idea that, with his personality, Tony could easily become a villain. Given that some people already think of Tony Stark as a villain, reading it just made me cringe. And the WORST thing about it is that, while this is a result of Axis, it\u2019s still Tony himself. According to the writers, he has \u201csurrendered to his id and his legendary ego\u201d (god I\u2019m about to gag) after the mind-altering events of Axis brought those things out in him. Despite my qualms, was the book well-written? I will never be able to read it that objectively, so I can\u2019t say. But clearly, as you can see by the size of this here rant (sorry), I dislike the very idea of it enough to put it on my \u201cdo not touch\u201d list.</p><p>Okay. Wow. I finally did it. Wow. Six months and it\u2019s done. </p><p>I am simply the mentor figure in your hero\u2019s journey. As you get used to navigating comics and reading orders, you\u2019ll find it easier to venture out, and there\u2019s so many ways to go. A character crossed over into something you read and you liked them a lot? Look up their reading order. A writer or artist really impressed you? Do a google search and find what else they\u2019ve worked on. There\u2019s a whole world of comics out there. Go have some fun.</p><p>I leave you with 3 rules of being a comic fan:</p><p>1. No one hates comics more than comic book readers. We\u2019re bitter because we care. You\u2019ll be like a jaded war veteran who writes a thousand word rant about why a certain author\u2019s mischaracterization of your fave offended you personally way faster than you\u2019d think.</p><p>2. Follow the trail of what interests you and, while acknowledging what may be widely believed, proudly own your personal opinions.</p><p>3. It\u2019s addictive. Embrace it. You start with one issue, and before you know it, you\u2019ve read 200 issues and know 20 years of history on one character in less than a year. That might be how it goes for you. Just go with it.</p><p>Happy reading!</p>",

(If you are on mobile&hellip;I am so, so sorry about this)</p><h2>Short version (the recommendation-y part)</h2><p><b>Recs because I like them:</b></p><p>Iron Man Volume 3 (1998)- #1-25 (my actual absolute FAVORITE RUN of all time and my number one recommendation. It&rsquo;s by Kurt Busiek, Roger Stern, and Sean Chen), #26-30, #62-63, #73-78. Iron Man Volume 4 (2005) #1-35. &nbsp;Invincible Iron Man (2008) spanned many years so you should read at least some, and it has many fans, but I am not one of them, so I&rsquo;m not gonna rec too much. Issues #1-6 and its epilogue, #7, are worth a read and the arc spanning #8-19 is probably the best from the era, I would say that I enjoyed that arc. Next is Brian Michael Bendis&rsquo; stuff, which has a pretty bad rep and while I don&rsquo;t hate it as much as others do, I wouldn&rsquo;t say I love it. It is, however, the most recent completed run &amp; important stuff happens, and there&rsquo;s some good stuff here and there, so yeah. I don&rsquo;t really have any specific recs from here&hellip;just read the whole thing and see what you get out of it or scroll down to the guide section and see the highlights I picked out. Invincible Iron Man (2015) #1-25, and Invincible Iron Man (2016) #1-600 (they changed the numbering halfway through, it&rsquo;s not 600 issues it&rsquo;s only I think 19).</p><p><b>Recs because important stuff happens even if I don&rsquo;t necessarily like them:</b></p><p>Civil War I (occurs during the Iron Man run starting in 2005), Civil War II (occurs during Brian Michael Bendis era), Iron Man (2012) #9-17 &ldquo;The Secret Origin of Tony Stark.&rdquo;</p><h2>Long version (the guide-y part)</h2><p>First off, I&rsquo;m going to tell you that my suggested starting points are Invincible Iron Man (1998) which was my starting point, and Invincible Iron Man (2005). Much more on those below.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t read Mr. Stark&rsquo;s classic adventures yet because there&rsquo;s a daunting number of them and I still need to find a starting point, so we&rsquo;re gonna start with&hellip;</p><p><b>Volume 3 (1998):</b></p><p>Okay I have SO MUCH to say here because I&rsquo;d die for this volume!! It&rsquo;s considered by many to be nothing special but there&rsquo;s a lot to appreciate if you&rsquo;re a fan of Tony in the way that many are here on tumblr- caring about character development &amp; character moments first and foremost. I&rsquo;ll break down my favorites for ya</p><p>#1- does a good job of setting the tone for Tony and this era of Invincible Iron Man. Some nice Tony character details are in there. Volume 3 is started with Kurt Busiek writing (later joined by Roger Stern) and Sean Chen on pencils. I LOVED this team, this is my FAVORITE run of Iron Man that I&rsquo;ve read, PLEASE read all 25 issues. I thought Busiek understood Tony really well and I just loved the way Chen drew Tony (and everything else), and their first issue is surprisingly enjoyable for mostly existing to set the groundwork for a fresh start.</p><p>#4-5- I think this is where the run starts to kick into gear. Tony&rsquo;s on-and-off girlfriend for the era, Rumiko, is introduced and she&rsquo;s fun (but as the years went on, deserved much better writing). Tony kicks some butt &amp; is a hero.</p><p>#6- an awesome Iron Man/Black Widow team up. It shows a really nice friendship between Tony &amp; Nat. Also, Nat kicks butt &amp; it&rsquo;s great</p><p>I&rsquo;m recommending every issue that builds Tony&rsquo;s relationship with Carol Danvers (at this time, she was Warbird, not Captain Marvel). #7, #11-12, #18, #19, #21, and #23-25. Their storyline details Tony&rsquo;s endeavors to help Carol overcome alcoholism. At least read the Carol parts of the issues she&rsquo;s only in a few panels of. Major highlight of the Iron Man comics I&rsquo;ve read. Also- knowing this background will definitely make Civil War II have more weight</p><p>#8-12- Tony gets the actual daylights beaten out of him and then some, leading into a compelling 2-issue Mandarin arc, this then leads into an interesting 2-issue team up with Warbird that gives us an answer as to why his injuries were so bad. It hurts but it&rsquo;s good</p><p>#13- an actually really compelling single-issue story that involves some trippy, creepy mind control stuff and takes a look into Tony&rsquo;s head- specifically questioning whether or not being Iron Man has become an addiction. You can&rsquo;t tell yet but I&rsquo;m trying my hardest to not recommend every single issue</p><p>#26-30- The Mask in the Iron Man arc. This is the first issue without Busiek writing- Joe Quesada steps in and it&rsquo;s good stuff. It&rsquo;s also Sean Chen&rsquo;s last arc. It starts with Tony punching a guy in the face to protect Rumiko but getting punched back and having to wear a nose splint- it&rsquo;s really cute. Then Tony and Ru run into relationship problems. Then the Iron Man armor becomes sentient, basically falls in love with Tony, and kidnaps him on a remote island. Wait-what? Yeah, it&rsquo;s really weird in hindsight, but while you&rsquo;re reading it, it sure does pull you in. One of the biggest standouts of the whole era and something of an instant classic. Also, the first few pages of #31 give you a little aftermath.</p><p>#37-40- this wasn&rsquo;t my favorite arc but I&rsquo;m recommending it just because of how wild it ends up being. These were the days when IIM wasn&rsquo;t afraid to have a big imagination. And I mean big, like, who thought of this? Well, Frank Tieri is writing at this point (he&rsquo;s okay, not my favorite of the volume), and Alitha Martinez &amp; Paul Ryan are on pencils (it&rsquo;s fine, but you&rsquo;ll miss Sean Chen) (you&rsquo;ll always miss Sean Chen). Also, a major player in this arc is Tiberius Stone so maybe read it to know who he is.</p><p>#50- &ldquo;Tinman&rdquo;. Issue 50 was meant to be a place for new readers to jump in. Mike Grell &amp; Michael Ryan are at the reigns as writer and artist. Grell&rsquo;s characterization was fairly solid, my favorite next to Busiek in this era. His version of Tony is more in touch with his emotions, I guess, than some like to characterize him. Sometimes he gets aggressive when he&rsquo;s angry but there&rsquo;s also a lot of really sweet moments and they portray him as doing a lot of good, like funding a rehab/safehouse for kids on the street. Grell&rsquo;s stories are generally grittier and more violent but Tony himself doesn&rsquo;t really take a dark turn. Issue #50 has both action and a VERY SOFT Tony, definitely recommend it</p><p>#53-55- &ldquo;Book of the Ten Rings&rdquo;. Again, it&rsquo;s grittier than the stuff that came before it, but it&rsquo;s good. Once the main story wraps up, something really important happens at the end. Also, it&rsquo;s important to note here for people that weren&rsquo;t previously into comics that at this point, Pepper and Happy are a thing, not Pepper and Tony as seen in the MCU</p><p>#59-61- &ldquo;In Shining Armor&rdquo;. Tony travels back to Medieval times and it&rsquo;s not exactly a good time for him but it&rsquo;s a wild time for us. Gotta love a good old fashioned time travel arc</p><p>#62-63- &ldquo;You Can&rsquo;t Always Get&rdquo;. Oh god PLEASE read this one, if you only listen to one of my post-Busiek &amp; Chen recs this is the one, the Tony content is so precious</p><p>#73-78- &ldquo;The Best Defense&rdquo;. The arc detailing Tony&rsquo;s journey to becoming Secretary of Defense because yes, that happened. A very interesting concept to watch Tony go through and one of the most notable stories in this era.</p><p><b>Volume 4 (2005):</b></p><p>This is the last of what I consider the Really Good Stuff (except for Civil War, but we&rsquo;ll get there). These comics defined Tony Stark as we know him today, and you&rsquo;ll notice that MCU Tony was definitely influenced by them. If you&rsquo;re starting here, it&rsquo;ll be Iron Man as you basically already know it. If you&rsquo;re coming here off of Volume 3, then you&rsquo;ll notice the tone of not just the stories but of Tony himself get darker. For whatever reason, writers looked at Tony and said &ldquo;let&rsquo;s find ways to bring his morals into question bc that&rsquo;s Interesting!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not bad (the Iron Man title, that is- Civil War is bad) but it doesn&rsquo;t really reflect what came before it, I guess. I&rsquo;m recommending all 35 issues bc why not but I&rsquo;ll break it down for ya &amp; make sure to point out my favorites </p><p>#1-6- &ldquo;Extremis&rdquo;. A must read. One of the most iconic Iron Man stories in 21st century comic history. It&rsquo;s on everyone&rsquo;s list. You are, as an Iron Man fan looking to get into IM comics, legally obligated to read this. This would also be the arc where I believe the MCU looked for inspiration for Tony characterization. Also Extremis obviously ended up in the MCU but it&rsquo;s like way different in the MCU than in the source material</p><p>#7-12- &ldquo;Execute Program&rdquo;- Basically, Tony is screwed up post-Extremis. Poor guy. Please read this. Directly leads to Civil War&hellip;</p><p>Civil War (2006) #1-7- Ugh. So. Civil War. In my personal opinion- not a fan. I actually like the movie MUCH better and imo the movie is the way this should have been written. Unfortunately, you&rsquo;ve gotta read it because it&rsquo;s an important event. You&rsquo;ll see people calling it &ldquo;Tony Stark characterization murder&rdquo; and THAT&rsquo;S VALID. Like. Tony suddenly became&hellip;a villain?? literally the worst?? under the poorly written guise of &ldquo;just doing what I have to do&rdquo; but the stuff that happens&hellip;.it just can&rsquo;t be explained with &ldquo;doing what I have to do&rdquo;. Honestly it reads like the writers just wanted to pit Tony against Steve and didn&rsquo;t care about keeping him in character. Tony basically had to be turned into a villain to make the story work because In-Character Tony would not have fit their needs. It sucks and I don&rsquo;t want to recommend it but you have to read it because it affects so much that comes after it.</p><p>THE ONLY CIVIL WAR ANYTHING YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER are tie ins and oneshots and I will tell you a couple</p><p>Invincible Iron Man #13-14- IIM&rsquo;s CW tie ins. Issue 13 comes after CW #2, issue 14 after CW #5. Read these read these read these!!!!</p><p>Captain America/Iron Man: Casualties of War- oneshot to be read after Civil War #4. Tony offers Steve the chance to try and talk it out. Both explain their positions and a lot of comic history between them is brought up.</p><p>Civil War: The Confession: SO after CW, SPOILER SPOILER poor Steve is assassinated in Captain America #25 (it&rsquo;s actually more wild than that bc superheroes don&rsquo;t just die but whatever) and this is a oneshot with two halves, the first takes place after Steve is dead and is Tony-centric and I LITERALLY CRIED and the second takes place when Steve is imprisoned before he is killed. PLEASE read this</p><p>There&rsquo;s more tie ins involving Tony that you should read but I&rsquo;m sick of talking abt CW </p><p>BACK TO THE IRON MAN SOLO TITLE</p><p>Sooooo the title now changes from Invincible Iron Man to Iron Man: Director of SHIELD but it&rsquo;s the same book</p><p>#15-18- It&rsquo;s Tony&rsquo;s first story arc as Director and it ends up being kind of wild actually</p><p>#21-28- &lsquo;Haunted&rsquo;. Starts out as a sort of murder mystery thing, spirals into something much bigger. Also, poor Tony is so screwed up in the head but what&rsquo;s new. Definitely read this one</p><p>#29-32- &lsquo;With Iron Hands&rsquo;. Basically, an entire arc of Tony feeling guilty about his past?? Pretty much. There&rsquo;s also a terrorist and a giant weapon and more fun stuff. The last you&rsquo;ll see of Tony for the volume bc stuff goes down in the Secret Invasion event and War Machine takes over for the last 3 issues of the title. Wish I could be of help in regards to Secret Invasion, but I haven&rsquo;t actually read it because I haven&rsquo;t been able to find it. Just, idk, google search the plot of Secret Invasion like I did and you should be able to get by</p><p><b>Invincible Iron Man (2008) AKA Other Volume 4:</b></p><p>Okay lots of comics fans think this is one of the best Iron Man runs in history and I respect their opinions and perhaps you will share them but I&rsquo;m gonna cut to the chase here: I am not one of those people. Look, I read all 62 issues so I have a fair opinion, and I&rsquo;m just not a huge fan. Matt Fraction is writing and Salvador Larroca is drawing. In my experience, the stories drag on and it gets to the point where you&rsquo;re just bored. I think I read the 89 issues of volume 3 faster than I read the 62 issues of this because I was just so bored with it. Also, I&rsquo;m really not a fan of Larroca&rsquo;s work on the book. I really disliked the way he drew Tony and the more I looked at it, it almost made me&hellip;uncomfortable? Some of his art is kind of gross imo. Plus, I didn&rsquo;t love Fraction&rsquo;s Tony characterization. I can&rsquo;t quite articulate why, it just didn&rsquo;t sit nicely w me. There were some moments where I thought &ldquo;oh yeah that&rsquo;s Correct&rdquo; but many other moments where I thought &ldquo;No Why Did You Write That&rdquo;. He was good at writing some wild and intricate stories but sometimes I felt that character got lost in the midst of the action. That&rsquo;s just me though, you might really like Fraction&rsquo;s run, and there is some stuff worth pointing out.</p><p>#1-6- &lsquo;The Five Nightmares&rsquo;. A fairly iconic modern Iron Man story. Tony&rsquo;s worst nightmare comes true when the son of Obadiah Stane uses Stark tech to cause absolutely horrific acts of terrorism. It gets pretty serious, but it sets the groundwork for this entire era of Iron Man. As far as Fraction stories go for me, it&rsquo;s one of the better ones. </p><p>#7- Five Nightmares Epilogue. A team-up of sorts with Spider-Man that I actually genuinely think you should read, especially for the ending (and because Peter &amp; Tony clearly wish they could be buddies again in this post-Civil War world).</p><p>#8-19- Okay it&rsquo;s really long but I remember it stood out to me, all I remember is that it&rsquo;s basically Tony Stark Brain Annihilation over the course of 12 issues and it hurts like heecckkk. Actually I&rsquo;m gonna say definitely read this one. Also Rescue happens and that&rsquo;s A Thing you should know about. Stuff gets fixed in the next arc, #20-24, but it&rsquo;s not worth recommending imo so don&rsquo;t read this if you&rsquo;re gonna read it but if you&rsquo;re not just know that SPOILER SPOILER Tony is fine except he accidentally erased Civil War from his memory (god I wish I could do that). SPOILER OVER</p><p>I think I&rsquo;m gonna end it there for Fraction issues of interest. There&rsquo;s probably more in there I should be recommending but I just. Can&rsquo;t be bothered to comb through Fraction&rsquo;s volume sorryyyyy I&rsquo;m just not a fan</p><p><b>Iron Man (2012):</b></p><p>So this run is by Kieron Gillen and I don&rsquo;t really want to recommend anything from it. I didn&rsquo;t love it as a whole. Gillen laid way to heavily into the idea of &ldquo;Tony Stark is a walking ego&rdquo;. The stories were kind of interesting in theory but I thought the execution was mediocre for some reason. Although, not necessarily the art but specifically the coloring was nice- very vibrant. The actual art was by Greg Land who comic fans really seem to hate. I didn&rsquo;t think his work on this was too bad idk. Again I don&rsquo;t really want to recommend anything so there&rsquo;s only one thing I&rsquo;m putting on here and it&rsquo;s:</p><p>#9-17- &ldquo;The Secret Origin of Tony Stark&rdquo;. So here&rsquo;s the thing. Kieron Gillen said to himself &ldquo;I need to do something that turns Tony Stark&rsquo;s identity on its head. I need to redefine him&rdquo;. And he actually kind of succeeded in that. And it&rsquo;s actually annoying and it actually feels like something that should be retconned&hellip;. but hasn&rsquo;t been?? And since it hasn&rsquo;t been, it&rsquo;s going to be important going forward so you should probably know about it. You could also just google it.</p><p><b>Invincible Iron (2015) by Man-Brian Michael Bendis</b></p><p>Yes, the infamous BMB. So, what&rsquo;s the truth about his run on Iron Man? Is the amount of hate warranted? Well&hellip;that&rsquo;ll be for you to decide. Personally, I think it was generally&hellip;meh. Not necessarily terrible just. Meh. Many fanboys act like this run is the bane of their existence and I don&rsquo;t think I dislike it to that extent at all. I mean, it gets boring after a while, but the good moments are really enjoyable and I think it&rsquo;s worth reading. Bendis&rsquo; characterization was sometimes weird because it felt notably inconsistent. However, the moments when he nailed it, he really did nail it. His Tony is a bit of a dork, a bit of a hot mess, a little vulnerable, and the moments when that&rsquo;s at the forefront are great. There&rsquo;s also some notable stuff going on here- Civil War 2 falls under this era (I hate it less than the first one but Marvel could do 50 Civil War events and I will probably not like any of them), and so does Riri Williams (who I love, just to get that opinion over with). Finding recs for this era is kind of weird for me because the things that stood out were almost never actual issues or stories, but rather specific character moments, so like, the volume is only 14 issues so tbh you can just trudge through them all and savor the good moments, but I&rsquo;ll try to pull some recs out for ya</p><p>#2, #3- just for some character moments. These two are a part of a larger arc so it might be a little confusing to read them on their own but who cares</p><p>#4, #5- Tony fights ninjas and visits kids at a hospital and MJ Watson &amp; Doctor Strange make appearances so it&rsquo;s kinda cool idk</p><p>#9-11- only because you meet Miss Riri Williams, the other parts won&rsquo;t make sense since it&rsquo;s in the middle of an arc but eh. Honestly the actual story didn&rsquo;t strike me as being very special so like unless you&rsquo;re into it you <i>can</i> just skim for the parts that Riri is in since she&rsquo;ll be important later</p><p>Aaaand CIVIL WAR 2 </p><p>Civil War II #0-8- okay I don&rsquo;t dislike it as strongly as I dislike the first CW but I still?? Don&rsquo;t like it?? But something really important to Tony&rsquo;s stories happens at the end and Tony is one of the main characters in the event so like. You should read it. The main problem I remember is that the pace felt so <i>slow</i>. This event is Iron Man vs Captain Marvel which kinda hurt me bc of how much I loved them from 1998&rsquo;s volume but it&rsquo;s fine!! They never address their past in the actual event but there&rsquo;s a tie-in that does so that&rsquo;s good I guess. Just get through it idk what to tell you</p><p>Back to Invincible Iron Man</p><p>#12, #13, #14- tie-ins to Civil War II. #12 and #13 I think come after CW2 #2?? Maybe?? And I think #14 comes after CW2 #6?? Anyway #14 actually acknowledges Tony &amp; Carol&rsquo;s past so you should give that a read while going through the event. </p><p><b>Invincible Iron Man (2016)</b></p><p>Sooo some Serious Stuff happened in Civil War II that&rsquo;s going to have an effect that lasts a while. I don&rsquo;t wanna spoil it, though. When you do get to the end of CW2, you can rest assured that Tony will still have a major presence as a character in this title, but Riri Williams takes the spotlight. Opinions on her are mixed, I personally love her. This, like its 2015 sister, can honestly just be read all the way through, it&rsquo;s only 19 issues, but I&rsquo;ll try to find stuff. Also, Tony &amp; Riri&rsquo;s banter is ALWAYS golden so just read to enjoy it tbh. On we go!</p><p>#1, #2- gives you the background on Riri now that she&rsquo;s taking center stage. She&rsquo;s just so darn endearing.</p><p>#11- It&rsquo;s basically an issue about everyone reflecting on how Tony is a good person and different from how the public perceives him. He holds orphaned babies from around the world. It&rsquo;s good stuff.</p><p>#593-600- the numbering changed, there&rsquo;s obviously not actually 600 issues lol. So yes this is kind of long for an arc, but it&rsquo;s important because it resolves what happened to Tony in Civil War 2. I remember getting bored with it after a few issues, like it wasn&rsquo;t bad I just remember it feeling slow. Idk. It&rsquo;s important. Just read it.</p><p><b>Stuff that I don&rsquo;t think is worth your time:</b></p><p>Invincible Iron Man volume 2 (1996)- I think Marvel was doing some kind of reboot or something because Iron Man&rsquo;s origin was redone as well as The Hulk&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s amazing how a run that was only 13 issues felt like such a large waste of my time. I didn&rsquo;t think there was anything of note. I basically don&rsquo;t even remember what happened in it. Also the sexualization of women was so casual and constant on top of the run not being particularly remarkable so yeah don&rsquo;t waste your time &nbsp;</p><p>Superior Iron Man (2015)- I dislike the idea of this so much that I don&rsquo;t even want to explain it ugh it&rsquo;s a spin off of an event called Axis that involved some psychic type stuff that altered the personalities of those involved, boosting Tony&rsquo;s worst qualities and making him evil. Marvel then decided to make a series about it and it&rsquo;s only 9 issues but wow it&rsquo;s amazing how hard it can be for me to get through 9 issues. I could barely read it I just so strongly dislike this idea ok so basically Evil Tony creates Extremis 3.0 which is an app that lets a person make themselves physically into the person they wish they were (In the pages of Axis, Tony personally made himself not an alcoholic because that&rsquo;s not disrespecting an incredibly important character detail and there was one particularly awful panel of him drinking alcohol in front of a crowd of cheering people and saying &ldquo;I missed you, sweetheart&rdquo;). He is testing this app on San Francisco and effectively creates two classes of people- the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; people who could access the app and the &ldquo;imperfect&rdquo; people who can&rsquo;t and that goes about as well as you&rsquo;d think. Then he makes it obscenely expensive to use which also goes about as well as you&rsquo;d think. And more stuff happens. Here&rsquo;s the thing. I&rsquo;m sure many people thought the concept of a villainous Tony Stark was cool, but I just don&rsquo;t like the implications of it. The way it&rsquo;s written kind of gives the idea that, with his personality, Tony could easily become a villain. Given that some people already think of Tony Stark as a villain, reading it just made me cringe. And the WORST thing about it is that, while this is a result of Axis, it&rsquo;s still Tony himself. According to the writers, he has &ldquo;surrendered to his id and his legendary ego&rdquo; (god I&rsquo;m about to gag) after the mind-altering events of Axis brought those things out in him. Despite my qualms, was the book well-written? I will never be able to read it that objectively, so I can&rsquo;t say. But clearly, as you can see by the size of this here rant (sorry), I dislike the very idea of it enough to put it on my &ldquo;do not touch&rdquo; list.</p><p>Okay. Wow. I finally did it. Wow. Six months and it&rsquo;s done. </p><p>I am simply the mentor figure in your hero&rsquo;s journey. As you get used to navigating comics and reading orders, you&rsquo;ll find it easier to venture out, and there&rsquo;s so many ways to go. A character crossed over into something you read and you liked them a lot? Look up their reading order. A writer or artist really impressed you? Do a google search and find what else they&rsquo;ve worked on. There&rsquo;s a whole world of comics out there. Go have some fun.</p><p>I leave you with 3 rules of being a comic fan:</p><p>1. No one hates comics more than comic book readers. We&rsquo;re bitter because we care. You&rsquo;ll be like a jaded war veteran who writes a thousand word rant about why a certain author&rsquo;s mischaracterization of your fave offended you personally way faster than you&rsquo;d think.</p><p>2. Follow the trail of what interests you and, while acknowledging what may be widely believed, proudly own your personal opinions.</p><p>3. It&rsquo;s addictive. Embrace it. You start with one issue, and before you know it, you&rsquo;ve read 200 issues and know 20 years of history on one character in less than a year. That might be how it goes for you. Just go with it.</p><p>Happy reading!</p>",

Listen, I met a young girl today. She needs a leg, but her family, well&hellip; they&rsquo;re broke. Well, almost broke. She was in an accident and they&rsquo;re still paying hospital bills, so I was wondering if you wanted to make someone&rsquo;s day. No, Morgan, no!\u201d And you heard a shriek on the background. \u201cLet me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he send this?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201cTell him I&rsquo;m on my way,\u201d you said and resumed your run, the Stark Tower in the distance.</p><hr><p>After the family left crying and thanking Tony like he was a deity and thanking you for taking on the creation of a leg for their daughter, Tony found you in the kitchen sitting on a stool while drinking coffee and working on designs and ideas for the leg.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;re you thinking?\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201cShe wants for it to look like a normal leg and no superheroe-like features, so I&rsquo;m working on functionality: water, electricity, energy&hellip; Maybe I&rsquo;ll work with Bruce, go for a way where there&rsquo;s no pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart move. You need assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for now.\u201d You threw your pen inside your notebook and closed it. \u201cIt&rsquo;s late. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy&rsquo;s at the lobby. I&rsquo;ll tell him to drive you.\u201d</p><p>You nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cAre you okay, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you lied. \u201cJust tired. I&rsquo;ll see you later, Mr. Stark.\u201d You waved him goodbye and left him in the kitchen, frowning to your shadow.</p><hr><p>Tony, who now had a wife and daughter and had spent too much time mentoring teenagers, knew something was wrong with you. He didn&rsquo;t know what, and he didn&rsquo;t want to ask you personally because the last ten times he&rsquo;d even come near the topic, you escaped.</p><p>So he asked another teenager.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete, how&rsquo;s it going?\u201d He asked him on the phone, Tony hearing the students&rsquo; despair and chaos on the background.</p><p>\u201cOh, just&hellip; you know, an exam destroyed my brain. Nothing new.\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled. \u201cAP Chem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAP Chem II.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, kid.\u201d Tony smiled to himself. \u201cSo I&rsquo;ve got a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)&rsquo;s been weird these days, and I mean extremely weird. Like&hellip; not even synthetic skin for robotic limbs got through to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don&rsquo;t know?\u201d Peter replied. \u201cHer application for Financial Aid got rejected,\u201d he informed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. MIT accepted her, but she figured there was no point in attending if she couldn&rsquo;t afford to go. Her mom even thought about selling the house, but (Y/N) stopped her. She knew it meant a lot to her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;Oh.\u201d And as Tony came up with a sentence, Morgan&rsquo;s cries interrupted his train of thought. \u201cSorry, Pete. Morgan is crying again. I should go help Pepper,\u201d he explained. \u201cThanks for the intel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony hung up and went up to his bedroom, hoping the sane part of him could give him guidance.</p><hr><p>It was Monday. Every time you checked the date, it baffled you how fast Graduation Day was coming. You&rsquo;d been dwelling on your MIT grief for a week now, and not having answers for what came next for you kept you up at night with a rushing heartbeat.</p><p>That afternoon, you were doing homework on your living room (per your mother&rsquo;s request) when someone ringed the doorbell.</p><p>It was Tony.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d You exclaimed, frowning. \u201cWhat&hellip; What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Your mother showed up behind you. \u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, (Y/M/N), I came to drop something for (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don&rsquo;t just stand there! Come in! I made cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>Tony entered your house, closing the door behind him. Your mother went to the kitchen. \u201cWhat&rsquo;re you doing here?\u201d You asked him.</p><p>\u201cHm&hellip; I came to discuss schedules for Claudia,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re an awful liar, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, his hands behind his back. \u201cI am aware, yes.\u201d</p><p>Your mother brought the cupcakes to the living room, where you all settled in. Tony had an hour until he had to return to the tower so Pepper could prepare for a conference she had with executives from the Phillippines.</p><p>He took that one-hour window to catch your mother up on what you were doing with Claudia, how you&rsquo;d helped Rhodey get back on his feet, how you&rsquo;d made come true the fantasy of a child of being Iron Man for a day by making an exact replica of an arm from one of Tony&rsquo;s suits.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take much for your mother to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, no&hellip; What did I say? Did I say something wrong?\u201d Tony asked, leaning forward on his seat, eyes wide open.</p><p>You put your hands on your mother&rsquo;s shoulders. \u201cNo&hellip; Not at all, Tony, just&hellip;\u201d She put a hand on your cheek. \u201cI&rsquo;m so proud of my baby&hellip; I wish I could make her as happy as she makes me.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes welled up with tears. \u201cYou do, mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about MIT?\u201d</p><p>Your head snapped to Tony&rsquo;s direction. \u201cWho told\u2014&quot; You sighed. \u201cDamnit, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn&rsquo;t you tell me?\u201d You grunted, picking up the remaining cupcakes to take them to the kitchen. Tony got up and stood on your way. \u201cYou could be a phone call away from going for free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s exactly why,\u201d you responded. \u201cYou&rsquo;ve done too much for me already, I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to be a burden or\u2014 or a pity project, I\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cOkay, no, that&rsquo;s so wrong.\u201d Tony took the tray of cupcakes from your hands and put them on the centre table. \u201c(Y/N), I&rsquo;ve known you for four years, and since our first conversation, I knew you were exceptional. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was signing up for when I agreed to mentor you, but to this day, I believe it&rsquo;s one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made. You&hellip; You encourage me to think outside the box. You&rsquo;ve taught me perseverance. You taught me how to make three dozen brownies in a span of thirty minutes.\u201d You chuckled, a tear rolling down your cheek. \u201cIt&rsquo;s not only your brains, it&rsquo;s your heart. I mean&hellip; we&rsquo;re talking about the girl who took intermitent naps on my laboratory&rsquo;s floor while working on Rhodey&rsquo;s pants for days on end. You&rsquo;ve done more for me than I&rsquo;ve done for you. You&rsquo;re like a daughter to me and I know this is the only thing you&rsquo;ve had faith in since your father died, so&hellip; please, let me do this.\u201d</p><p>You let out a hard sob, but you tried to keep your emotions inside as the light of your hope beamed through your whole body. \u201cOkay,\u201d you muttered.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded. \u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>You hugged Tony, and this took him by surprise. He grinned, hugging you back. Your mother stared at the scene, her palms united, her index fingers touching her lips. When you ended the hug, Tony sniffled maintaing a straight face, like he did when he was about to get emotional. He pulled out an envelope from his back pocket and handed it to you.</p><p>\u201cA card and the bank account details.\u201d</p><p>You let out a sharp breath, your eyes wide and a smile on your face. \u201cWh&hellip; What? You had this prepared?\u201d You inquired. \u201cYou knew I&rsquo;d say yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would.\u201d</p><p>You laughed. You turned to your mother and said, \u201cMom, I&rsquo;m going to MIT!\u201d Tears filled your eyes, and you knew there was no point in stopping the incoming waterworks.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby, you are!\u201d</p><p>You ran to your mother and wrapped her body in a tight embrace. Her, with tears she didn&rsquo;t bother in masking, mouthed to Tony. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in return.</p><hr><p><b>Please; fanfic writers are struggling right now to get notes, so try reblogging and commenting instead of just liking.</b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://young-and-bitchy.tumblr.com/post/178398781557/masterlist\">masterlist</a> / <a href=\"https://digitaltipjar.com/youngandbitchy\">tip jar</a> / <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/youngandbitchy\">AO3.</a></b></p>",

Like\u2026 not even synthetic skin for robotic limbs got through to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know?\u201d Peter replied. \u201cHer application for Financial Aid got rejected,\u201d he informed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. MIT accepted her, but she figured there was no point in attending if she couldn\u2019t afford to go. Her mom even thought about selling the house, but (Y/N) stopped her. She knew it meant a lot to her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201d And as Tony came up with a sentence, Morgan\u2019s cries interrupted his train of thought. \u201cSorry, Pete. Morgan is crying again. I should go help Pepper,\u201d he explained. \u201cThanks for the intel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony hung up and went up to his bedroom, hoping the sane part of him could give him guidance.</p><hr><p>It was Monday. Every time you checked the date, it baffled you how fast Graduation Day was coming. You\u2019d been dwelling on your MIT grief for a week now, and not having answers for what came next for you kept you up at night with a rushing heartbeat.</p><p>That afternoon, you were doing homework on your living room (per your mother\u2019s request) when someone ringed the doorbell.</p><p>It was Tony.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d You exclaimed, frowning. \u201cWhat\u2026 What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Your mother showed up behind you. \u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, (Y/M/N), I came to drop something for (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t just stand there! Come in! I made cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>Tony entered your house, closing the door behind him.

Tony had an hour until he had to return to the tower so Pepper could prepare for a conference she had with executives from the Phillippines.</p><p>He took that one-hour window to catch your mother up on what you were doing with Claudia, how you\u2019d helped Rhodey get back on his feet, how you\u2019d made come true the fantasy of a child of being Iron Man for a day by making an exact replica of an arm from one of Tony\u2019s suits.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take much for your mother to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, no\u2026 What did I say? Did I say something wrong?\u201d Tony asked, leaning forward on his seat, eyes wide open.</p><p>You put your hands on your mother\u2019s shoulders. \u201cNo\u2026 Not at all, Tony, just\u2026\u201d She put a hand on your cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of my baby\u2026 I wish I could make her as happy as she makes me.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes welled up with tears. \u201cYou do, mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about MIT?\u201d</p><p>Your head snapped to Tony\u2019s direction. \u201cWho told\u2014\" You sighed. \u201cDamnit, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d You grunted, picking up the remaining cupcakes to take them to the kitchen. Tony got up and stood on your way. \u201cYou could be a phone call away from going for free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why,\u201d you responded. \u201cYou\u2019ve done too much for me already, I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be a burden or\u2014 or a pity project, I\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cOkay, no, that\u2019s so wrong.\u201d Tony took the tray of cupcakes from your hands and put them on the centre table. \u201c(Y/N), I\u2019ve known you for four years, and since our first conversation, I knew you were exceptional. I didn\u2019t know what I was signing up for when I agreed to mentor you, but to this day, I believe it\u2019s one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made. You\u2026 You encourage me to think outside the box. You\u2019ve taught me perseverance. You taught me how to make three dozen brownies in a span of thirty minutes.\u201d You chuckled, a tear rolling down your cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s not only your brains, it\u2019s your heart. I mean\u2026 we\u2019re talking about the girl who took intermitent naps on my laboratory\u2019s floor while working on Rhodey\u2019s pants for days on end. You\u2019ve done more for me than I\u2019ve done for you. You\u2019re like a daughter to me and I know this is the only thing you\u2019ve had faith in since your father died, so\u2026 please, let me do this.\u201d</p><p>You let out a hard sob, but you tried to keep your emotions inside as the light of your hope beamed through your whole body. \u201cOkay,\u201d you muttered.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded. \u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>You hugged Tony, and this took him by surprise. He grinned, hugging you back. Your mother stared at the scene, her palms united, her index fingers touching her lips.

I particularly wrote this because I\u2019m aware I\u2019m not the only one who has the potential to turn the world around and is being held back by money, so this is to those of you who are\u2026 including me. I also want to welcome you to tell me your injust stories with the education system (with or without anon) \u2014 Let\u2019s bond!</p><p><b>Inspiration</b>: Grace \u2014 Florence + The Machine.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Application and Financial Aids offices sent out their responses without giving it a second though, indifferent to the fact that the impact of their decisions lasted a lifetime.</p><p><br></p><p><i>\u201cDear (Y/N), we regret to inform you that you don\u2019t qualify for financial aid.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>Huh. So much for regretting.</p><p>You were about to go on a jog, so you left the letter with your mother. \u201cFuck this shit,\u201d you muttered, and you slammed the door of the house shut as she called out for you.</p><p>Outside, rain was pouring down. You put on the hood of your raincoat and channelled your anger, running from the start instead of going slow.</p><p>Since you were eight years old, MIT had been the dream. You\u2019d get in and you\u2019d pay back the money on its entirety from one month of salary. You had a project: help those who needed it through your goals. A small kid didn\u2019t have an arm? You\u2019d build one specially designed for them. A person couldn\u2019t walk? If they desired it, you\u2019d make them a new pair of robotic legs (after all, it wasn\u2019t the first time you took on that challenge, and Rhodey never complained).</p><p>And you told yourself money wouldn\u2019t be a problem for those people, because of all the times it\u2019d been for you.</p><p><i>Shit.</i></p><p>When you stopped to take a breath, the air itched in your throat and your heart was beating so fast it hurt your chest.</p><p>In your earbuds, Florence, an AI Tony and Peter designed for your birthday, spoke, \u201c(Y/N), you have a voicenote from Mr. Stark.\u201d You stood in the middle of the sidewalk, the rain blending with your tears, pedestrians avoiding to crash with you and glaring. \u201c(Y/N), you will get a cold.\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath and found refugee in a bus stop. \u201cPlay the voicenote for me, please.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Tony\u2019s voice drowned your ears. \u201cHey, kid. Listen, I met a young girl today. She needs a leg, but her family, well\u2026 they\u2019re broke. Well, almost broke. She was in an accident and they\u2019re still paying hospital bills, so I was wondering if you wanted to make someone\u2019s day. No, Morgan, no!\u201d And you heard a shriek on the background. \u201cLet me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he send this?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201cTell him I\u2019m on my way,\u201d you said and resumed your run, the Stark Tower in the distance.</p><hr><p>After the family left crying and thanking Tony like he was a deity and thanking you for taking on the creation of a leg for their daughter, Tony found you in the kitchen sitting on a stool while drinking coffee and working on designs and ideas for the leg.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking?\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201cShe wants for it to look like a normal leg and no superheroe-like features, so I\u2019m working on functionality: water, electricity, energy\u2026 Maybe I\u2019ll work with Bruce, go for a way where there\u2019s no pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart move. You need assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for now.\u201d You threw your pen inside your notebook and closed it. \u201cIt\u2019s late. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy\u2019s at the lobby. I\u2019ll tell him to drive you.\u201d</p><p>You nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cAre you okay, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you lied. \u201cJust tired. I\u2019ll see you later, Mr. Stark.\u201d You waved him goodbye and left him in the kitchen, frowning to your shadow.</p><hr><p>Tony, who now had a wife and daughter and had spent too much time mentoring teenagers, knew something was wrong with you. He didn\u2019t know what, and he didn\u2019t want to ask you personally because the last ten times he\u2019d even come near the topic, you escaped.</p><p>So he asked another teenager.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete, how\u2019s it going?\u201d He asked him on the phone, Tony hearing the students\u2019 despair and chaos on the background.</p><p>\u201cOh, just\u2026 you know, an exam destroyed my brain.

I also want to welcome you to tell me your injust stories with the education system (with or without anon) &mdash; Let&rsquo;s bond!</p><p><b>Inspiration</b>: Grace &mdash; Florence + The Machine.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>Application and Financial Aids offices sent out their responses without giving it a second though, indifferent to the fact that the impact of their decisions lasted a lifetime.</p><p><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Dear (Y/N), we regret to inform you that you don&rsquo;t qualify for financial aid.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>Huh. So much for regretting.</p><p>You were about to go on a jog, so you left the letter with your mother. &ldquo;Fuck this shit,&rdquo; you muttered, and you slammed the door of the house shut as she called out for you.</p><p>Outside, rain was pouring down. You put on the hood of your raincoat and channelled your anger, running from the start instead of going slow.</p><p>Since you were eight years old, MIT had been the dream. You&rsquo;d get in and you&rsquo;d pay back the money on its entirety from one month of salary. You had a project: help those who needed it through your goals. A small kid didn&rsquo;t have an arm? You&rsquo;d build one specially designed for them. A person couldn&rsquo;t walk? If they desired it, you&rsquo;d make them a new pair of robotic legs (after all, it wasn&rsquo;t the first time you took on that challenge, and Rhodey never complained).</p><p>And you told yourself money wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for those people, because of all the times it&rsquo;d been for you.</p><p><i>Shit.</i></p><p>When you stopped to take a breath, the air itched in your throat and your heart was beating so fast it hurt your chest.</p><p>In your earbuds, Florence, an AI Tony and Peter designed for your birthday, spoke, &ldquo;(Y/N), you have a voicenote from Mr. Stark.&rdquo; You stood in the middle of the sidewalk, the rain blending with your tears, pedestrians avoiding to crash with you and glaring. &ldquo;(Y/N), you will get a cold.&rdquo;</p><p>You took a deep breath and found refugee in a bus stop. &ldquo;Play the voicenote for me, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Immediately, Tony&rsquo;s voice drowned your ears. &ldquo;Hey, kid. Listen, I met a young girl today. She needs a leg, but her family, well&hellip; they&rsquo;re broke. Well, almost broke. She was in an accident and they&rsquo;re still paying hospital bills, so I was wondering if you wanted to make someone&rsquo;s day. No, Morgan, no!&rdquo; And you heard a shriek on the background. &ldquo;Let me know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When did he send this?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Half an hour ago.&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed. &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m on my way,&rdquo; you said and resumed your run, the Stark Tower in the distance.</p><hr /><p>After the family left crying and thanking Tony like he was a deity and thanking you for taking on the creation of a leg for their daughter, Tony found you in the kitchen sitting on a stool while drinking coffee and working on designs and ideas for the leg.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you thinking?&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed. &ldquo;She wants for it to look like a normal leg and no superheroe-like features, so I&rsquo;m working on functionality: water, electricity, energy&hellip; Maybe I&rsquo;ll work with Bruce, go for a way where there&rsquo;s no pain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Smart move. You need assistance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not for now.&rdquo; You threw your pen inside your notebook and closed it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late. I should go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Happy&rsquo;s at the lobby. I&rsquo;ll tell him to drive you.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony frowned. &ldquo;Are you okay, kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you lied. &ldquo;Just tired. I&rsquo;ll see you later, Mr. Stark.&rdquo; You waved him goodbye and left him in the kitchen, frowning to your shadow.</p><hr /><p>Tony, who now had a wife and daughter and had spent too much time mentoring teenagers, knew something was wrong with you. He didn&rsquo;t know what, and he didn&rsquo;t want to ask you personally because the last ten times he&rsquo;d even come near the topic, you escaped.</p><p>So he asked another teenager.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Pete, how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; He asked him on the phone, Tony hearing the students&rsquo; despair and chaos on the background.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, just&hellip; you know, an exam destroyed my brain. Nothing new.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckled. &ldquo;AP Chem?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;AP Chem II.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn, kid.&rdquo; Tony smiled to himself. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve got a question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shoot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)&rsquo;s been weird these days, and I mean extremely weird. Like&hellip; not even synthetic skin for robotic limbs got through to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;Her application for Financial Aid got rejected,&rdquo; he informed him.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. MIT accepted her, but she figured there was no point in attending if she couldn&rsquo;t afford to go. Her mom even thought about selling the house, but (Y/N) stopped her. She knew it meant a lot to her family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Oh.&rdquo; And as Tony came up with a sentence, Morgan&rsquo;s cries interrupted his train of thought. &ldquo;Sorry, Pete. Morgan is crying again. I should go help Pepper,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Thanks for the intel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, Mr. Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony hung up and went up to his bedroom, hoping the sane part of him could give him guidance.</p><hr /><p>It was Monday. Every time you checked the date, it baffled you how fast Graduation Day was coming. You&rsquo;d been dwelling on your MIT grief for a week now, and not having answers for what came next for you kept you up at night with a rushing heartbeat.</p><p>That afternoon, you were doing homework on your living room (per your mother&rsquo;s request) when someone ringed the doorbell.</p><p>It was Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark!&rdquo; You exclaimed, frowning. &ldquo;What&hellip; What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Your mother showed up behind you. &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, (Y/M/N), I came to drop something for (Y/N).&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t just stand there! Come in! I made cupcakes.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony entered your house, closing the door behind him. Your mother went to the kitchen. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing here?&rdquo; You asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm&hellip; I came to discuss schedules for Claudia,&rdquo; he lied.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an awful liar, you know that, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded, his hands behind his back. &ldquo;I am aware, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Your mother brought the cupcakes to the living room, where you all settled in. Tony had an hour until he had to return to the tower so Pepper could prepare for a conference she had with executives from the Phillippines.</p><p>He took that one-hour window to catch your mother up on what you were doing with Claudia, how you&rsquo;d helped Rhodey get back on his feet, how you&rsquo;d made come true the fantasy of a child of being Iron Man for a day by making an exact replica of an arm from one of Tony&rsquo;s suits.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take much for your mother to burst into tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no&hellip; What did I say? Did I say something wrong?&rdquo; Tony asked, leaning forward on his seat, eyes wide open.</p><p>You put your hands on your mother&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;No&hellip; Not at all, Tony, just&hellip;&rdquo; She put a hand on your cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of my baby&hellip; I wish I could make her as happy as she makes me.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes welled up with tears. &ldquo;You do, mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is this about MIT?&rdquo;</p><p>Your head snapped to Tony&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Who told&mdash;\" You sighed. &ldquo;Damnit, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; You grunted, picking up the remaining cupcakes to take them to the kitchen. Tony got up and stood on your way. &ldquo;You could be a phone call away from going for free.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly why,&rdquo; you responded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done too much for me already, I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to be a burden or&mdash; or a pity project, I&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, no, that&rsquo;s so wrong.&rdquo; Tony took the tray of cupcakes from your hands and put them on the centre table. &ldquo;(Y/N), I&rsquo;ve known you for four years, and since our first conversation, I knew you were exceptional. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was signing up for when I agreed to mentor you, but to this day, I believe it&rsquo;s one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made. You&hellip; You encourage me to think outside the box. You&rsquo;ve taught me perseverance. You taught me how to make three dozen brownies in a span of thirty minutes.&rdquo; You chuckled, a tear rolling down your cheek. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only your brains, it&rsquo;s your heart. I mean&hellip; we&rsquo;re talking about the girl who took intermitent naps on my laboratory&rsquo;s floor while working on Rhodey&rsquo;s pants for days on end. You&rsquo;ve done more for me than I&rsquo;ve done for you. You&rsquo;re like a daughter to me and I know this is the only thing you&rsquo;ve had faith in since your father died, so&hellip; please, let me do this.&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a hard sob, but you tried to keep your emotions inside as the light of your hope beamed through your whole body. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded. &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p><p>You hugged Tony, and this took him by surprise. He grinned, hugging you back. Your mother stared at the scene, her palms united, her index fingers touching her lips. When you ended the hug, Tony sniffled maintaing a straight face, like he did when he was about to get emotional. He pulled out an envelope from his back pocket and handed it to you.</p><p>&ldquo;A card and the bank account details.&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a sharp breath, your eyes wide and a smile on your face. &ldquo;Wh&hellip; What? You had this prepared?&rdquo; You inquired. &ldquo;You knew I&rsquo;d say yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was hoping you would.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed. You turned to your mother and said, &ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m going to MIT!&rdquo; Tears filled your eyes, and you knew there was no point in stopping the incoming waterworks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, baby, you are!&rdquo;</p><p>You ran to your mother and wrapped her body in a tight embrace. Her, with tears she didn&rsquo;t bother in masking, mouthed to Tony. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded in return.</p><hr /><p><b>Please; fanfic writers are struggling right now to get notes, so try reblogging and commenting instead of just liking.</b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://young-and-bitchy.tumblr.com/post/178398781557/masterlist\">masterlist</a> / <a href=\"https://digitaltipjar.com/youngandbitchy\">tip jar</a> / <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/youngandbitchy\">AO3.</a></b></p>",

How can I help him with this? I mean, Cap, even Banner would be better at this kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, maybe they can help him later, when he needs to talk through things, but neither of them is Peter\u2019s father, you are. You can help him right now by going in that room and sitting next to him, like he has always done for you every time you ended up in a hospital bed. He just needs his Dad, Tony, and that\u2019s you. Yes, he needs both of us, but you\u2019re his Dad, and he needs to know you still love him, no matter what happens to him next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly think - of course I do, I will, I am, I\u2019m here, Stephen. I pulled him out of the damn river and thought he was dead, Stephen. He was frozen, and I thought I was too late, he was supposed to be at school, in gym class -\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Remember, I know you, Tony. I heard it in your voice, I know. I saw your face before you took off again. He just needs you. I needed, I need you. Need to know we can do this, together, for him, for us - if anyone can, it\u2019s the three of us, right?\u201d</p><p>\"Stephen. I\u2019m so sorry. I was just hoping he wouldn\u2019t have to - I wanted him to have the chance to have a real life, a chance to be happy and now, his life - it won\u2019t ever be his own, once people know who, what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still Pete, Tony.
