Nice for a person, but terrible for fiction. If a character never changes then why are we watching them? To see how good and pure they are? Because I never got the impression that Molly actually cared about anyone. He cared about them as people, yes, but as an <i>idea</i> of people&ndash;an abstraction.

His family comes to say goodbye.\u00a0</p><p><i>a/n: the title is from Deuteronomy 2:10 by the mountain goats.</i><i>\u00a0this is mostly me getting closure and telling Beau i love her\u00a0</i></p><!-- more --><hr><p><b></b></p><p>Mollymauk Tealeaf does not like to be alone. Mollymauk Tealeaf does not like the dark. So, when he opens his eyes to find himself alone and in total darkness, it\u2019s disorienting to say the least. He fights back the panic by closing his eyes and going over what he knows, for sure.</p><p>He knows he is Mollymauk Tealeaf. He knows he has friends, they\u2019re waiting for him somewhere. Why were they waiting? He knows something is wrong. He knows he shouldn\u2019t be where he is, and yet it feels familiar somehow. </p><p>The darkness around him doesn\u2019t change. For hours, he sits(is he sitting? It feels more like floating), trying to remember everything. He remembers chasing something, he remembers Keg, he remembers a plan, and a fight, and Lorenzo. And then it hits him. </p><p>Mollymauk Tealeaf is dead.</p><p>He laughs when he realizes it. He doesn\u2019t know why. He thought he\u2019d be afraid or sad or angry when it finally came. But all he can think about is how <i>funny</i> it is, how poetically <i>Mollymauk</i> it is for him to have died the way he did. </p><p>Eventually, the laughter fades. And all that\u2019s left is an overwhelming sense of \u201cWhat now?\u201d. This can\u2019t be his afterlife, it was so boring.</p><p>Nothing happens, for a bit. And then he hears it.</p><p>\u201cMolly?\u201d a timid, shrill voice penetrates the silence. He turns around, and he sees Nott, sitting anxiously and holding her flask as she speaks, her eyes fixated on the body lying next to her. Molly\u2019s body. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can hear me, but\u2026 I wanted to say thank you. I feel like I never told you that. But you were nice to me and you made me laugh and now, you\u2019re gone, and I really miss you, and I\u2019m sorry i never told you before.\u201d Molly smiles, and he kneels down next to Nott and puts a hand on her face. He wipes away a tear that falls down her face, and presses a gentle kiss to her forehead. He doesn\u2019t know if she can feel it, but it\u2019s all he can do to comfort her. After a moment, she takes a swig of her flask, and disappears as she stands up.</p><p>It\u2019s only a moment before Caleb appears instead, a somber look on his face. He\u2019s kneeling next to Molly\u2019s body, and he takes one of Molly\u2019s hands and grips it tightly. He doesn\u2019t say anything for a moment. Then he clears his throat and begins, his voice hoarse and tired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no good with words, Mollymauk, you know that.\u201d He hesitates for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to you. You always do that, you know. I. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do without you, Mollymauk.\u201d \u00a0Caleb falls down to his knees as tears start rolling down his face. Molly wraps his arms around Caleb, holding him tightly and fiercely. </p><p>They stay like that for a few moments, and then Mollymauk pulls away before pressing a kiss to Caleb\u2019s forehead, as he did for Nott. Caleb wipes his eyes, and stands up, turning and beginning to walk away.</p><p>Before he disappears, he turns back and says \u201cGoodbye, Mollymauk. I am sorry we cannot bring you back.\u201d</p><p>A few moments pass in the darkness. And then he sees Beau. She looks exhausted, still covered in blood from the battle. Her eyes are red and angry, and he knows she\u2019s trying so hard not to cry. She sighs and sits down next to him, running her hands over the patterns on his coat.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you have to do that, asshole?\u201d She said, her voice shaky. \u201cYou can\u2019t just leave like that. We need you. Fjord, Jester, Yasha, they need you to come rescue them. Caleb needs you, Nott needs you.\u201d Her voice gets quiet as she hesitates, and her next sentence is barely a whisper. \u201cI need you.\u201d As she says it, she curls in on herself, her hands balling into fists clinging to his jacket. He can see her shaking with tears, and he puts a hand on her back as she cries. Through her sobs, she starts muttering, talking more than she usually does, as if she\u2019s trying to get out every thought as soon as it comes through her mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to protect you. How are we gonna get them back without you, Molly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou\u2019re a strong girl, you\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough for this,\u201d she says, almost as if she could hear him. She stayed there for a little bit, her forehead resting on Molly\u2019s bodies chest, her hands holding tightly onto his coat.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mollymauk,\u201d she said quietly, hoarsely, like she was confessing a secret to him. \u201cYou\u2019re my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he whispers back to her as she sits up. She starts to get up, but pauses for a moment. She runs her hand over his coat once more, and she begins to take it off of him.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I borrow this for a little bit,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll bring it back, mostly. I promise.\u201d Then she got up and left, taking the coat with her.</p><p><i>What the hell does she mean by \u2018mostly\u2019?</i> Mollymauk wondered.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t very long before she came back. When she did, he noticed the hem was shorter, and it looked messily torn. And then he saw the fabric tied around her waist, the familiar and ostentatious patterns contrasting the rest of her fairly simple outfit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, putting the cloak back on him. \u201cI just wanted to, y\u2019know, keep part of you with me. A souvenir, I guess.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou look great.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if she could hear him. He kind of hoped she couldn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t let this asshole hear him <i>complementing</i> her, gods no. </p><p>She sat there for a moment, not saying anything. She just looked at him, exhausted and sad and lonely. He kneeled next to her and pressed a kiss into her forehead.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Mollymauk,\u201d She said, laughing softly, trying hard not to cry again.</p><p>\u201cFuck you too, Beauregard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d And, after a moment. \u201cGood luck. Kill those bastards for me.\u201d</p>",

Mollymauk Tealeaf does not like the dark. So, when he opens his eyes to find himself alone and in total darkness, it\u2019s disorienting to say the least. He fights back the panic by closing his eyes and going over what he knows, for sure.</p><p>He knows he is Mollymauk Tealeaf. He knows he has friends, they\u2019re waiting for him somewhere. Why were they waiting? He knows something is wrong. He knows he shouldn\u2019t be where he is, and yet it feels familiar somehow. </p><p>The darkness around him doesn\u2019t change. For hours, he sits(is he sitting? It feels more like floating), trying to remember everything. He remembers chasing something, he remembers Keg, he remembers a plan, and a fight, and Lorenzo. And then it hits him. </p><p>Mollymauk Tealeaf is dead.</p><p>He laughs when he realizes it. He doesn\u2019t know why. He thought he\u2019d be afraid or sad or angry when it finally came. But all he can think about is how <i>funny</i> it is, how poetically <i>Mollymauk</i> it is for him to have died the way he did. </p><p>Eventually, the laughter fades. And all that\u2019s left is an overwhelming sense of \u201cWhat now?\u201d. This can\u2019t be his afterlife, it was so boring.</p><p>Nothing happens, for a bit. And then he hears it.</p><p>\u201cMolly?\u201d a timid, shrill voice penetrates the silence. He turns around, and he sees Nott, sitting anxiously and holding her flask as she speaks, her eyes fixated on the body lying next to her. Molly\u2019s body. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can hear me, but\u2026 I wanted to say thank you. I feel like I never told you that. But you were nice to me and you made me laugh and now, you\u2019re gone, and I really miss you, and I\u2019m sorry i never told you before.\u201d Molly smiles, and he kneels down next to Nott and puts a hand on her face. He wipes away a tear that falls down her face, and presses a gentle kiss to her forehead. He doesn\u2019t know if she can feel it, but it\u2019s all he can do to comfort her. After a moment, she takes a swig of her flask, and disappears as she stands up.</p><p>It\u2019s only a moment before Caleb appears instead, a somber look on his face. He\u2019s kneeling next to Molly\u2019s body, and he takes one of Molly\u2019s hands and grips it tightly. He doesn\u2019t say anything for a moment. Then he clears his throat and begins, his voice hoarse and tired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no good with words, Mollymauk, you know that.\u201d He hesitates for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to you. You always do that, you know. I. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do without you, Mollymauk.\u201d \u00a0Caleb falls down to his knees as tears start rolling down his face. Molly wraps his arms around Caleb, holding him tightly and fiercely. </p><p>They stay like that for a few moments, and then Mollymauk pulls away before pressing a kiss to Caleb\u2019s forehead, as he did for Nott. Caleb wipes his eyes, and stands up, turning and beginning to walk away.</p><p>Before he disappears, he turns back and says \u201cGoodbye, Mollymauk. I am sorry we cannot bring you back.\u201d</p><p>A few moments pass in the darkness. And then he sees Beau. She looks exhausted, still covered in blood from the battle. Her eyes are red and angry, and he knows she\u2019s trying so hard not to cry. She sighs and sits down next to him, running her hands over the patterns on his coat.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you have to do that, asshole?\u201d She said, her voice shaky. \u201cYou can\u2019t just leave like that. We need you. Fjord, Jester, Yasha, they need you to come rescue them. Caleb needs you, Nott needs you.\u201d Her voice gets quiet as she hesitates, and her next sentence is barely a whisper. \u201cI need you.\u201d As she says it, she curls in on herself, her hands balling into fists clinging to his jacket. He can see her shaking with tears, and he puts a hand on her back as she cries. Through her sobs, she starts muttering, talking more than she usually does, as if she\u2019s trying to get out every thought as soon as it comes through her mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to protect you. How are we gonna get them back without you, Molly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou\u2019re a strong girl, you\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough for this,\u201d she says, almost as if she could hear him. She stayed there for a little bit, her forehead resting on Molly\u2019s bodies chest, her hands holding tightly onto his coat.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mollymauk,\u201d she said quietly, hoarsely, like she was confessing a secret to him. \u201cYou\u2019re my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he whispers back to her as she sits up. She starts to get up, but pauses for a moment. She runs her hand over his coat once more, and she begins to take it off of him.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I borrow this for a little bit,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll bring it back, mostly. I promise.\u201d Then she got up and left, taking the coat with her.</p><p><i>What the hell does she mean by \u2018mostly\u2019?</i> Mollymauk wondered.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t very long before she came back. When she did, he noticed the hem was shorter, and it looked messily torn. And then he saw the fabric tied around her waist, the familiar and ostentatious patterns contrasting the rest of her fairly simple outfit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, putting the cloak back on him. \u201cI just wanted to, y\u2019know, keep part of you with me. A souvenir, I guess.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou look great.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if she could hear him. He kind of hoped she couldn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t let this asshole hear him <i>complementing</i> her, gods no. </p><p>She sat there for a moment, not saying anything. She just looked at him, exhausted and sad and lonely. He kneeled next to her and pressed a kiss into her forehead.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Mollymauk,\u201d She said, laughing softly, trying hard not to cry again.</p><p>\u201cFuck you too, Beauregard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d And, after a moment. \u201cGood luck. Kill those bastards for me.\u201d</p>",

The blades dancing about him, all movements sharp and powerful, his eyes filled with absolute bloodlust. </p>\n\n<p>He bleeds neon. He bleeds confetti and glitter and laughter.</p>\n\n<p>He bleeds ice. He bleeds destruction. He is nothing more than the blood he bleeds. </p>\n\n<p>You get used to seeing him bleed, it&rsquo;s how he lives, on the field of battle and off it.</p>\n\n<p>But then one day you see him bleed and the look on his face is none of those things. It&rsquo;s equal parts scared and calm, the face of a man who doesn&rsquo;t fully understand what is to come but that he will accept it, whatever it may be. He bleeds and bleeds and bleeds and you scream and cry to make him stop but he doesn&rsquo;t. </p>\n\n<p>The boy who lived his life bleeding dies just the very same.</p>\n\n<p>And oh lord, how the sun bows it&rsquo;s mighty head at his passing. </p>\n\n<p>***</p>\n\n<p>Mollymauk Tealeaf&hellip; you will be missed</p>",
