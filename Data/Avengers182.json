I&rsquo;ve moved all the locations in CAWS to New York so that it ties in with the end of The Avengers; that includes the Barton&rsquo;s farm being in some kind of rural area outside NYC. Written for marvel-bang 2018.<br /><br /><b>Summary:</b> \n\nWhen he got back from New Mexico, Clint was given the incredibly boring task of watching the newly defrosted Captain America adjust to modern life. He didn&rsquo;t expect it to lead to a misunderstanding, an impromptu make-out session and a blown mission. But that&rsquo;s alright because he was unlikely to run into Steve Rogers again.

A satisfied smirk played on his lips as he watched the blood come gushing out of my nose and down my face. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you learn your place little girl.\u201d As he leaned in to continue his boring ass rant about me being insubordinate I spat the blood that had been collecting in my mouth directly into his face. He stood there dumbfounded with his mouth open.<i> It was so worth it.</i></p><p>He yelled out in rage and I knew what was coming next, he sent a flurry of fists flying directly at my face, each hit seemed harder than the last. The door opened again and in walked three more guards all with amused smirks gracing there lips. They unstrapped me from the table, it\u2019s honestly like the were asking for me to kick there asses, as soon as both my wrists and ankles were unbound I leapt off the table and onto my feet ready in a fighting stance, knocking one of the guards over in the process. </p><p>Blood was falling from my face in a steady stream now but I didn\u2019t care, I was used to the pain. The guard on the floor swiftly stood up and sent a glare my way, I smirked challenging him to make a move, he lunged at me with his knife, I easily avoided his attack and grabbed his arm maneuvering it so that I could grab his knife, he lunged again and quickly regretted it as the knife pierced his chest, he fell to the floor with a deafening thud. The three remaining agents looked at each other as if silently coming up with a plan to take me down.</p><p>They nodded at each other and tried to ambush me, I quickly ducked and rolled over to the dead body on the floor, pulling the knife out of his chest, I swiftly threw it at another agent where it lodged itself in his throat, he grasped at his neck trying to stop the blood that poured out of him like a fountain. Before I had a chance to execute my next attack the door clanged open and a swarm of agents swarmed into the room with riot shields, they raised their guns and aimed them directly as me, as I turned to attack once more I felt a searing pain in my right shoulder, I looked down to see the bullet wound oozing black blood. <i>Why did they always have to lace the bullets with poison?! </i></p><p>My eyes struggled open as the effects of the poison wore off, it felt like my head was literally splitting in half. I realised I was back in my cell, I struggled to sit up on the bed (if you can call it that). I looked down to see my clothes soaked in my blood, apparently me being unconscious gave them the perfect chance to beat the shit out of me. My skin was littered in bruises and cuts varying in size, it also felt like I had a broken ankle and dislocated shoulder. I sighed to myself as I lay down on the bed slowly drifting back into the comfort of unconsciousness.</p><!-- more --><p>\u2022\u2022</p><p>I was pulled back to the world at the sound of my cell door being unlocked, a single agent entered the room with his gun drawn looking anxious, \u201c Get up, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d I nodded and slowly lifted myself of the bed and began walking over to the agent. \u201cNo funny business.\u201d he stated as he aimed his gun at my head and gestured for me to exit first.</p><p>Walking through the halls of the building I knew something was wrong, agents ran back and forth preparing to abandon anything that wasn\u2019t of value to them. I scanned the area trying to figure out what had everyone so worked up, I felt the agent that was escorting me press his gun against the back of my head, I rolled my eyes. <i>Enough of this shit. </i></p><p>I spun around quickly grabbing the agents gun, he fired a shot that skimmed my neck, I twisted his arm until I heard the crack and he released the gun, before he even had time to react he was on the ground with a bullet between his eyes. <i>Time to get out of this shit hole.</i></p><p>I took off running as best I could with the crippling pain coming from my ankle. <i>Definitely broken</i>. I took out every Hydra agent I came into contact with, by the time I made it to the exit I was caked in both my blood and the blood of the agents I\u2019d killed. Taking in a deep breath I opened the door to freedom, the wind whipped my hair around as I relished in the feeling of finally being in the outdoors. I heard the door I had just escaped from opening, I aimed my gun at whoever was brave enough to exit. <i>I won\u2019t go back.</i> As the door opened I prepared to take the shot when the familiar glint of a red and blue shield caught my eye making me remove my finger from the trigger, while still keeping the gun trained on the door.</p><p>\u201cDrop the gun kid.\u201d</p>",

I tried to sit up but soon realised my wrists and ankles were bound to a metal table. <i>Oh great, I must have passed out from the pain.</i></p><p>I looked around the room as best I could given my current position, it was then that I noticed that there were no guards or doctors in the room with me. Strange, there\u2019s normally at least one guard here when I wake up. I tried to yank my arm free from its restraints even though I knew it was pointless but hey, you can\u2019t blame a girl for trying right. </p><p>I heard the muffled voices through the metal door, seconds later it opened to reveal a Hydra agent. He entered the room and locked the door behind him, he smirked at me and I rolled my eyes in response. <i>What a dick.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat have you been told about rolling your fucking eyes?!\u201d he growled at me as he stalked closer. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too sure, you see torture kind of fucks up my memory.\u201d I said casually as I smirked at his enraged face. <i>God it was just too fucking easy to piss him off.</i> He stepped up next to my head and grabbed my chin harshly in his rough hand.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck do you think you\u2019re talking you little bitch?!\u201d he hissed in my ear before sending a hard punch straight to my nose, I heard the crack and knew instantly that he had broken it. <i>Fucking perfect, it\u2019s only just healed from the last break</i>. A satisfied smirk played on his lips as he watched the blood come gushing out of my nose and down my face. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you learn your place little girl.\u201d As he leaned in to continue his boring ass rant about me being insubordinate I spat the blood that had been collecting in my mouth directly into his face. He stood there dumbfounded with his mouth open.<i> It was so worth it.</i></p><p>He yelled out in rage and I knew what was coming next, he sent a flurry of fists flying directly at my face, each hit seemed harder than the last. The door opened again and in walked three more guards all with amused smirks gracing there lips. They unstrapped me from the table, it\u2019s honestly like the were asking for me to kick there asses, as soon as both my wrists and ankles were unbound I leapt off the table and onto my feet ready in a fighting stance, knocking one of the guards over in the process. </p><p>Blood was falling from my face in a steady stream now but I didn\u2019t care, I was used to the pain. The guard on the floor swiftly stood up and sent a glare my way, I smirked challenging him to make a move, he lunged at me with his knife, I easily avoided his attack and grabbed his arm maneuvering it so that I could grab his knife, he lunged again and quickly regretted it as the knife pierced his chest, he fell to the floor with a deafening thud. The three remaining agents looked at each other as if silently coming up with a plan to take me down.</p><p>They nodded at each other and tried to ambush me, I quickly ducked and rolled over to the dead body on the floor, pulling the knife out of his chest, I swiftly threw it at another agent where it lodged itself in his throat, he grasped at his neck trying to stop the blood that poured out of him like a fountain. Before I had a chance to execute my next attack the door clanged open and a swarm of agents swarmed into the room with riot shields, they raised their guns and aimed them directly as me, as I turned to attack once more I felt a searing pain in my right shoulder, I looked down to see the bullet wound oozing black blood. <i>Why did they always have to lace the bullets with poison?! </i></p><p>My eyes struggled open as the effects of the poison wore off, it felt like my head was literally splitting in half. I realised I was back in my cell, I struggled to sit up on the bed (if you can call it that). I looked down to see my clothes soaked in my blood, apparently me being unconscious gave them the perfect chance to beat the shit out of me. My skin was littered in bruises and cuts varying in size, it also felt like I had a broken ankle and dislocated shoulder. I sighed to myself as I lay down on the bed slowly drifting back into the comfort of unconsciousness.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2022\u2022</p><p>I was pulled back to the world at the sound of my cell door being unlocked, a single agent entered the room with his gun drawn looking anxious, \u201c Get up, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d I nodded and slowly lifted myself of the bed and began walking over to the agent. \u201cNo funny business.\u201d he stated as he aimed his gun at my head and gestured for me to exit first.</p><p>Walking through the halls of the building I knew something was wrong, agents ran back and forth preparing to abandon anything that wasn\u2019t of value to them. I scanned the area trying to figure out what had everyone so worked up, I felt the agent that was escorting me press his gun against the back of my head, I rolled my eyes. <i>Enough of this shit. </i></p><p>I spun around quickly grabbing the agents gun, he fired a shot that skimmed my neck, I twisted his arm until I heard the crack and he released the gun, before he even had time to react he was on the ground with a bullet between his eyes. <i>Time to get out of this shit hole.</i></p><p>I took off running as best I could with the crippling pain coming from my ankle. <i>Definitely broken</i>. I took out every Hydra agent I came into contact with, by the time I made it to the exit I was caked in both my blood and the blood of the agents I\u2019d killed. Taking in a deep breath I opened the door to freedom, the wind whipped my hair around as I relished in the feeling of finally being in the outdoors. I heard the door I had just escaped from opening, I aimed my gun at whoever was brave enough to exit. <i>I won\u2019t go back.</i> As the door opened I prepared to take the shot when the familiar glint of a red and blue shield caught my eye making me remove my finger from the trigger, while still keeping the gun trained on the door.</p><p>\u201cDrop the gun kid.\u201d</p>",

The three remaining agents looked at each other as if silently coming up with a plan to take me down.</p>\n<p>They nodded at each other and tried to ambush me, I quickly ducked and rolled over to the dead body on the floor, pulling the knife out of his chest, I swiftly threw it at another agent where it lodged itself in his throat, he grasped at his neck trying to stop the blood that poured out of him like a fountain. Before I had a chance to execute my next attack the door clanged open and a swarm of agents swarmed into the room with riot shields, they raised their guns and aimed them directly as me, as I turned to attack once more I felt a searing pain in my right shoulder, I looked down to see the bullet wound oozing black blood. <i>Why did they always have to lace the bullets with poison?! </i></p>\n<p>My eyes struggled open as the effects of the poison wore off, it felt like my head was literally splitting in half. I realised I was back in my cell, I struggled to sit up on the bed (if you can call it that). I looked down to see my clothes soaked in my blood, apparently me being unconscious gave them the perfect chance to beat the shit out of me. My skin was littered in bruises and cuts varying in size, it also felt like I had a broken ankle and dislocated shoulder. I sighed to myself as I lay down on the bed slowly drifting back into the comfort of unconsciousness.</p>\n</p>",
