In the Santa Monica series, as in Greek mythology, the gods\u2019 fathers are overthrown by their children, and Kratos has already felt the consequences of his actions, dealing with his own anger and thirst for violence. Where have we seen this rabid behavior in search of revenge? Well, surprise, in Star Wars. Darth Vader succumbed to the dark side of the force as well as the quality of the films in episode I, II and III. Luke was close to following his father\u2019s path, but with the help of his mentors and friends he had enough strength to resist.</p><p>Kratos is the brute with difficulties in coping with his feelings and his son, but the character has grown and gained a lot of depth.
