It was small and had basic furniture that looked as if it had come from the same dull color scheme, but Dan didn&rsquo;t really mind. He wouldn&rsquo;t be here very long.<b><br/></b></p><!-- more --><p>A tired secretary looked up at him as he entered, but when Dan settled in one of the seats in front of the television, she looked back down at her paperwork, a frown still on her face. </p><p>Dan looked up at the TV and smiled wide. It was on the same channel that the weather station aired, and on it Phil was grinning and relaying the temperatures for the day and how the sun for once would be shining for most of the afternoon. </p><p>Dan sat and watched the whole time Phil was on, a goofy smile on his face. When the angle switched to the news anchors, Dan&rsquo;s attention drifted to his phone, where he scrolled through twitter for a little. Now that Phil wasn&rsquo;t on the live broadcast he&rsquo;d be in a separate room, recording a few different takes of a handful of different weather broadcasts that the station could air later in the day, depending on which of their predictions were correct. And since Phil was here as an employee and not an intern today, as soon as he was done, they could leave. </p><p>They&rsquo;d been dating for a few weeks at this point, and with Dan&rsquo;s workaholic schedule and Phil&rsquo;s two jobs, most time between them had been lunch breaks and an impromptu sleepover, or a few hours together of kissing and movies and video games before reality once again rained on their parade. Today however, Dan was off due to the shop being closed so it could get some of its appliances replaced, and Phil had his whole day off as well minus his morning broadcast. They were planning on spending it together and to shop and wander around Manchester as it rapidly neared the holiday season. </p><p>Dan thought that a day just for the two of them was <i>long</i> overdue. </p><p>A few people came and went while Dan was sitting there, and he eventually stopped looking up so hopefully since every time he only got a stranger returning his excitement with a look of bewilderment at Dan&rsquo;s gaze. And besides, had he gotten a little caught up in scrolling through the various threads? Maybe. Had he gotten comfortable in his seat and popped his earbuds in? Possibly. Did Phil ever give him a ball-park time as to when he would be done? No. So he really had no business materializing out of nowhere and hooking a finger under Dan&rsquo;s chin, tilting his head up and kissing him in greeting. Dan&rsquo;s legs just went jelly even though he wasn&rsquo;t standing, and his thoughts flatlined. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; Dan said eloquently when Phil pulled back. Phil laughed and helped Dan up. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello to you too. I&rsquo;m all done by the way\u2014are you ready to get out of here? I distinctly remember planning a whole day together with my boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan managed something between a breathy &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; and &ldquo;of course&rdquo; and let Phil grab his hand, leading him outside dumbly, still overwhelmed with how easily this cliche bastard could knock all of the breath out of his lungs. He simultaneously hoped that he would eventually get used to it\u2014becoming a stuttering mess was highly inconvenient at times\u2014and also never wanted that feeling of devotion to go away. </p><p>The sun was surprisingly warm for early December, and the sky was clearer than Dan had seen it in an awfully long time. Topped with all of the Christmas decorations around and nestled into Phil&rsquo;s side, their hands threaded, Dan really couldn&rsquo;t imagine a better way of spending his day off. </p><p>Their first stop was Starbucks\u2014a Dan and Phil tradition. They&rsquo;d gone to a Starbucks for their first &ldquo;date&rdquo; on one of Dan&rsquo;s lunch breaks, and ever since, they&rsquo;d hit it a half a dozen times together in the several weeks of their relationship. </p><p>Phil ordered while Dan snagged them a table in the corner. He returned however, with a horrendous amount of foam on his coffee and a simple protest of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s flavored leave me alone.&rdquo; Phil then proceeded to take a huge sip, leaving a hefty foam mustache on his upper lip. Dan laughed hysterically and couldn&rsquo;t help but snap a picture of Phil&rsquo;s adorable pout, sending it to Jaime after saving it to his phone. He was surprised when his phone beeped almost right away. She was down in London today working on the play, and it was too early for her to be on her lunch break already. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>&gt;&gt; From: my maraschino cherry<br/></b><i>look at you two and ur coffee dates ur<br/></i><i>sickening</i></p><p><i>also</i></p><p><i>how much foam did he ask for that man<br/></i>is living in a world w/o god</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>&gt;&gt; To: my maraschino cherry<br/></b><i>too much. the answer is too much</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>&ldquo;Is that Jaime? You two aren&rsquo;t conspiring against me again, are you?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan snorted and took a sip of his own coffee (with a normal amount of foam, thank you very much). </p><p>&ldquo;If you count conspiring as us dragging you for the sheer amount of foam on that coffee, then yes, absolutely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Unlike <i>you</i>, I refuse to be subjected to society&rsquo;s standards as to what is acceptable with coffee. Besides, what do you know? My coffee is <i>fantastic</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Some lines just shouldn&rsquo;t be crossed, mate, and a gallon of foam is one of them. And you&rsquo;re forgetting\u2014I literally <i>make</i> coffee for a living. I think I have the right to judge.&rdquo; Dan said, rolling his eyes in the fondest way possible. Phil grumbled as if he was annoyed, but Dan could tell that he didn&rsquo;t really mean it. </p><p>Dan leaned back against the chair and watched Phil as he used the front camera on his phone to make sure he wiped away all of the foam from the top of his lip. Was that creepy? Maybe. But Dan just couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes off of Phil, as cliche as it was. Phil was just <i>Phil</i>\u2014Dan couldn&rsquo;t ignore him if he tried. </p><p>&ldquo;What, did I miss some of it?&rdquo; Phil asked, already pulling his phone back out of his pocket. Dan grabbed his hand to stop the movement. </p><p>&ldquo;No, you spork, you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Dan said softly. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s face brightened and a sly smile spread across his face. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;whatcha looking at then?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan let his thumb flitter over the tops of Phil&rsquo;s knuckles before answering. </p><p>&ldquo;A dork.&rdquo; </p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Dan cackled as Phil crossed his arms and pouted. He started whining about how Dan was being a &ldquo;terrible boyfriend&rdquo; and &ldquo;first the foam now this,&rdquo; and he was being so ridiculous that Dan only laughed harder. Phil just kept going though, and Dan tried to shush him in between giggles, but to no avail. </p><p><i>What an absolute fucking nerd,</i> Dan thought as he gave up trying to stop Phil with words and instead pulled him forward into a kiss. Dan was still trying to control his laughter so he wasn&rsquo;t even really kissing properly and pretty much just smiling against Phil&rsquo;s mouth, but it worked perfectly. Phil shut up instantly and kissed back. His arm snaked around Dan&rsquo;s waist loosely, but it still sent a tingle up Dan&rsquo;s spine anyways. </p><p>Dan pulled back a little, his cheeks aching from laughing. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No no, come back here.&rdquo; Phil dragged Dan right back to his side, and this time the kiss was a proper one. When Phil let go of him Dan knew his cheeks were dusted pink, and in his own opinion the blush probably matched the warm feeling in his chest. </p><p>Phil hummed, smiling softly down at Dan. &ldquo;Cute.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but they both knew that didn&rsquo;t mean anything. </p><p>After they finished their coffees, they wandered out into the city. Earlier in the week they had planned out all of the stores they had wanted to visit, but things ended up taking longer than expected because they couldn&rsquo;t stop themselves from walking into every building that had something that caught their eye. With all of the extra stops, the shopping trip had to be split in half by lunch. Dan didn&rsquo;t mind though. A nice lunch in a little corner cafe with Phil was a pleasant and welcomed surprise. </p><p>Dan found his Christmas present for Jaime, and nearly bought one for Phil as well. The only thing that stopped Dan from buying the galaxy jumper was the fact that it was about twice as much as Dan&rsquo;s already small and strained budget. </p><p>It was nearing the evening when they stepped through the threshold of Phil&rsquo;s apartment. The day had been incredibly fun, and Dan didn&rsquo;t even mind that he was tired from all of the walking that they had done, or that the tip of his nose was near froze from the cold air. </p><p>Dan dropped the bags in his hands down onto the floor next to Phil&rsquo;s. He reached back up for the zipper on his coat, but Phil&rsquo;s hands batted it out of the way. Surprised, Dan raised an eyebrow at Phil, but it went unaddressed by the older man. Phil slipped the coat from Dan&rsquo;s shoulders and hung it up. </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go pick out a movie, Dan? I&rsquo;m in a bit of a mood for popcorn and snuggling under a blanket.&rdquo; </p><p>He retreated back to the lounge, the faint blush on his cheeks from Phil taking his coat off for him dissipating. It had been domestic and Dan enjoyed being taken care of, shoot him. </p><p>Dan settled on a bit of a classic and popped it into the DVD player. Behind him he could hear Phil starting the microwave, and even though they had ate not that long ago, Dan&rsquo;s stomach grumbled at the smell of the butter. Dan pulled one of the many blankets Phil had off of the back of the couch and wrapped it around him. He left half of it off to the side for Phil. </p><p>&ldquo;You can start it! I&rsquo;ll be right in.&rdquo; </p><p>The opening credits of <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> had finished playing by the time Phil surfaced, but it was with a large bowl of popcorn and accompanying sweets, which made up for lost cuddle time in Dan&rsquo;s mind. </p><p>A few moments later Phil was settled under the blanket, pressed next to Dan. The snacks were in a pile on their laps, and they frequently snuck a hand out from under the blanket to munch on them. </p><p>The movie was one of Dan&rsquo;s favorites, and he decided that watching it with Phil&rsquo;s body curled around his, tucked away in their little corner of the world, made it even better. </p><p>Phil had also never seen the movie before, and Dan had brought his own copy of it over ages ago with the intention of watching it. Unfortunately, they had never gotten the chance to until now, but it was hardly an issue. Dan enjoyed Phil&rsquo;s gasps of surprise, and his frantic panic towards the end of the movie when things were hitting the climax. When the screen faded to the end credits, Phil&rsquo;s jaw was dropped, shock on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it you enjoyed it?&rdquo; Dan asked, a smiling. Phil stared at the television for another moment before snapping to attention. </p><p>&ldquo;Like it? Dan, that was one of the <i>coolest</i> movies I&rsquo;ve ever seen. And it&rsquo;s based off of a book, you said? God, I need to read it, oh my gosh.&rdquo; Phil continued rambling about his favorite parts, and he talked about his thought process through the movie. &ldquo;I swear I thought Andy was guilty! But then he got some proof that he wasn\u2019t, and they <i>shot</i> the guy!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep. Really makes you think, huh?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil laughed. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it does.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan smiled, happy that Phil had enjoyed something that Dan loved. He pecked Phil&rsquo;s lips with his own before mustering the willpower to scoot out of their little blanket cocoon. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you take it out of the DVD player? I&rsquo;ll take care of our scraps.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil was still smiling softly at him, and the look was making Dan&rsquo;s insides feel all warm and gooey. Not that long ago that would have terrified him, but now it just made Dan&rsquo;s grin go wider. </p><p>He quickly washed the bowl to get the butter off of the sides and put it back in Phil&rsquo;s cabinet. Before he left he shut the rest of Phil&rsquo;s cabinet doors, rolling his eyes. Phil could look at a bunch of nonsense numbers and measurements and predict the weather, but the man couldn&rsquo;t bother himself to close a cabinet door. </p><p>Dan walked back into the lounge, ready to tease Phil about it, but stopped when he found him standing next to the couch, reading something on his phone. His eyebrows were crinkled and the corners of his mouth were turned down in something between a frown and a grimace. The expression caused the joke on Dan&rsquo;s lips to wither, and for a moment Dan just stood there, watching Phil. He didn&rsquo;t seem to know that Dan was back in the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil jumped at Dan&rsquo;s voice shattering the silence, and slipped his phone back into his pocket. The small smile plastered on Phil&rsquo;s face was fake, and Dan could tell that Phil was trying to figure out what to say. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s just an email from work.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tesco emailed you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, the weatherstation.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Dan didn&rsquo;t know if he should keep pushing, but when he thought about the frown on Phil&rsquo;s face just a little bit ago and how his shoulders were curled in anxiety, Dan&rsquo;s resolution hardened. He knew first hand what something negative could do if it was allowed to fester, and he didn&rsquo;t want that to happen to Phil. &ldquo;Was it something bad?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, not really.&rdquo; Phil said, his fingers sliding into his pockets. Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but frown at that. Phil stuck his hands in his pockets when he was uncomfortable. Was Dan making him feel like that? &ldquo;My schedule just got changed up a bit. I&rsquo;m going to have to ring Tesco to have them adjust my shifts so none of them overlap.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nodded, but there was no doubt in his mind that Phil wasn&rsquo;t telling the truth. Another glance at Phil&rsquo;s hands in his pockets held back Dan&rsquo;s tongue, however. He didn&rsquo;t want to make Phil uncomfortable or anxious. </p><p>Dan decided to drop the subject, but he didn&rsquo;t let his suspicions fall. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you want to call them now? I can step back into the kitchen if you want?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Phil said, his arms flinching like he wanted to move them, but decided not to at the last minute. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I promise. I&rsquo;ll call them in the morning\u2014I don&rsquo;t think anybody would pick up, anyways. Come on, it&rsquo;s my turn to pick a movie.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil gave Dan one last strained smile before turning all of his attention to the shelf of movies he owned. Dan was still frowning, worried about what had really been on Phil&rsquo;s phone, and even more worried about Phil, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Dan didn&rsquo;t think that Phil really looked at the selection and more-or-less just popped a random disc into the DVD player. After pressing play, Phil caught Dan&rsquo;s wrists and pulled him to the sofa. They settled back under the blanket, but this time Phil was holding Dan against his chest, his arms wrapped around Dan to keep him close. He pressed a soft kiss to Dan&rsquo;s temple. </p><p>&ldquo;Relax, everything&rsquo;s fine, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t do much to ease Dan&rsquo;s thoughts, but he did relax his body, as well as tuck his worried thoughts away to deal with later. For now, he just wanted to enjoy this time with Phil.</p>",

It was small and had basic furniture that looked as if it had come from the same dull color scheme, but Dan didn\u2019t really mind. He wouldn\u2019t be here very long.<b><br></b></p>[[MORE]]<p>A tired secretary looked up at him as he entered, but when Dan settled in one of the seats in front of the television, she looked back down at her paperwork, a frown still on her face. </p><p>Dan looked up at the TV and smiled wide. It was on the same channel that the weather station aired, and on it Phil was grinning and relaying the temperatures for the day and how the sun for once would be shining for most of the afternoon. </p><p>Dan sat and watched the whole time Phil was on, a goofy smile on his face. When the angle switched to the news anchors, Dan\u2019s attention drifted to his phone, where he scrolled through twitter for a little. Now that Phil wasn\u2019t on the live broadcast he\u2019d be in a separate room, recording a few different takes of a handful of different weather broadcasts that the station could air later in the day, depending on which of their predictions were correct. And since Phil was here as an employee and not an intern today, as soon as he was done, they could leave. </p><p>They\u2019d been dating for a few weeks at this point, and with Dan\u2019s workaholic schedule and Phil\u2019s two jobs, most time between them had been lunch breaks and an impromptu sleepover, or a few hours together of kissing and movies and video games before reality once again rained on their parade. Today however, Dan was off due to the shop being closed so it could get some of its appliances replaced, and Phil had his whole day off as well minus his morning broadcast. They were planning on spending it together and to shop and wander around Manchester as it rapidly neared the holiday season. </p><p>Dan thought that a day just for the two of them was <i>long</i> overdue. </p><p>A few people came and went while Dan was sitting there, and he eventually stopped looking up so hopefully since every time he only got a stranger returning his excitement with a look of bewilderment at Dan\u2019s gaze. And besides, had he gotten a little caught up in scrolling through the various threads? Maybe. Had he gotten comfortable in his seat and popped his earbuds in? Possibly. Did Phil ever give him a ball-park time as to when he would be done? No. So he really had no business materializing out of nowhere and hooking a finger under Dan\u2019s chin, tilting his head up and kissing him in greeting. Dan\u2019s legs just went jelly even though he wasn\u2019t standing, and his thoughts flatlined. </p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Dan said eloquently when Phil pulled back. Phil laughed and helped Dan up. </p><p>\u201cHello to you too. I\u2019m all done by the way\u2014are you ready to get out of here? I distinctly remember planning a whole day together with my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Dan managed something between a breathy \u201cyeah\u201d and \u201cof course\u201d and let Phil grab his hand, leading him outside dumbly, still overwhelmed with how easily this cliche bastard could knock all of the breath out of his lungs. He simultaneously hoped that he would eventually get used to it\u2014becoming a stuttering mess was highly inconvenient at times\u2014and also never wanted that feeling of devotion to go away. </p><p>The sun was surprisingly warm for early December, and the sky was clearer than Dan had seen it in an awfully long time. Topped with all of the Christmas decorations around and nestled into Phil\u2019s side, their hands threaded, Dan really couldn\u2019t imagine a better way of spending his day off. </p><p>Their first stop was Starbucks\u2014a Dan and Phil tradition. They\u2019d gone to a Starbucks for their first \u201cdate\u201d on one of Dan\u2019s lunch breaks, and ever since, they\u2019d hit it a half a dozen times together in the several weeks of their relationship. </p><p>Phil ordered while Dan snagged them a table in the corner. He returned however, with a horrendous amount of foam on his coffee and a simple protest of \u201cit\u2019s flavored leave me alone.\u201d Phil then proceeded to take a huge sip, leaving a hefty foam mustache on his upper lip. Dan laughed hysterically and couldn\u2019t help but snap a picture of Phil\u2019s adorable pout, sending it to Jaime after saving it to his phone. He was surprised when his phone beeped almost right away. She was down in London today working on the play, and it was too early for her to be on her lunch break already. </p><p><br></p><p><b>&gt;&gt; From: my maraschino cherry<br></b><i>look at you two and ur coffee dates ur<br></i><i>sickening</i></p><p><i>also</i></p><p><i>how much foam did he ask for that man<br></i>is living in a world w/o god</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>&gt;&gt; To: my maraschino cherry<br></b><i>too much. the answer is too much</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>\u201cIs that Jaime? You two aren\u2019t conspiring against me again, are you?\u201d </p><p>Dan snorted and took a sip of his own coffee (with a normal amount of foam, thank you very much). </p><p>\u201cIf you count conspiring as us dragging you for the sheer amount of foam on that coffee, then yes, absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Unlike <i>you</i>, I refuse to be subjected to society\u2019s standards as to what is acceptable with coffee. Besides, what do you know? My coffee is <i>fantastic</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSome lines just shouldn\u2019t be crossed, mate, and a gallon of foam is one of them. And you\u2019re forgetting\u2014I literally <i>make</i> coffee for a living. I think I have the right to judge.\u201d Dan said, rolling his eyes in the fondest way possible. Phil grumbled as if he was annoyed, but Dan could tell that he didn\u2019t really mean it. </p><p>Dan leaned back against the chair and watched Phil as he used the front camera on his phone to make sure he wiped away all of the foam from the top of his lip. Was that creepy? Maybe. But Dan just couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off of Phil, as cliche as it was. Phil was just <i>Phil</i>\u2014Dan couldn\u2019t ignore him if he tried. </p><p>\u201cWhat, did I miss some of it?\u201d Phil asked, already pulling his phone back out of his pocket. Dan grabbed his hand to stop the movement. </p><p>\u201cNo, you spork, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Dan said softly. </p><p>Phil\u2019s face brightened and a sly smile spread across his face. \u201cSo,\u201d he drawled, \u201cwhatcha looking at then?\u201d </p><p>Dan let his thumb flitter over the tops of Phil\u2019s knuckles before answering. </p><p>\u201cA dork.\u201d </p><p><i>\u201cHey!\u201d</i></p><p>Dan cackled as Phil crossed his arms and pouted. He started whining about how Dan was being a \u201cterrible boyfriend\u201d and \u201cfirst the foam now this,\u201d and he was being so ridiculous that Dan only laughed harder. Phil just kept going though, and Dan tried to shush him in between giggles, but to no avail. </p><p><i>What an absolute fucking nerd,</i> Dan thought as he gave up trying to stop Phil with words and instead pulled him forward into a kiss. Dan was still trying to control his laughter so he wasn\u2019t even really kissing properly and pretty much just smiling against Phil\u2019s mouth, but it worked perfectly. Phil shut up instantly and kissed back. His arm snaked around Dan\u2019s waist loosely, but it still sent a tingle up Dan\u2019s spine anyways. </p><p>Dan pulled back a little, his cheeks aching from laughing. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no, come back here.\u201d Phil dragged Dan right back to his side, and this time the kiss was a proper one. When Phil let go of him Dan knew his cheeks were dusted pink, and in his own opinion the blush probably matched the warm feeling in his chest. </p><p>Phil hummed, smiling softly down at Dan. \u201cCute.\u201d </p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but they both knew that didn\u2019t mean anything. </p><p>After they finished their coffees, they wandered out into the city. Earlier in the week they had planned out all of the stores they had wanted to visit, but things ended up taking longer than expected because they couldn\u2019t stop themselves from walking into every building that had something that caught their eye. With all of the extra stops, the shopping trip had to be split in half by lunch. Dan didn\u2019t mind though. A nice lunch in a little corner cafe with Phil was a pleasant and welcomed surprise. </p><p>Dan found his Christmas present for Jaime, and nearly bought one for Phil as well. The only thing that stopped Dan from buying the galaxy jumper was the fact that it was about twice as much as Dan\u2019s already small and strained budget. </p><p>It was nearing the evening when they stepped through the threshold of Phil\u2019s apartment. The day had been incredibly fun, and Dan didn\u2019t even mind that he was tired from all of the walking that they had done, or that the tip of his nose was near froze from the cold air. </p><p>Dan dropped the bags in his hands down onto the floor next to Phil\u2019s. He reached back up for the zipper on his coat, but Phil\u2019s hands batted it out of the way. Surprised, Dan raised an eyebrow at Phil, but it went unaddressed by the older man. Phil slipped the coat from Dan\u2019s shoulders and hung it up. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go pick out a movie, Dan? I\u2019m in a bit of a mood for popcorn and snuggling under a blanket.\u201d </p><p>He retreated back to the lounge, the faint blush on his cheeks from Phil taking his coat off for him dissipating. It had been domestic and Dan enjoyed being taken care of, shoot him. </p><p>Dan settled on a bit of a classic and popped it into the DVD player. Behind him he could hear Phil starting the microwave, and even though they had ate not that long ago, Dan\u2019s stomach grumbled at the smell of the butter. Dan pulled one of the many blankets Phil had off of the back of the couch and wrapped it around him. He left half of it off to the side for Phil. </p><p>\u201cYou can start it! I\u2019ll be right in.\u201d </p><p>The opening credits of <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> had finished playing by the time Phil surfaced, but it was with a large bowl of popcorn and accompanying sweets, which made up for lost cuddle time in Dan\u2019s mind. </p><p>A few moments later Phil was settled under the blanket, pressed next to Dan. The snacks were in a pile on their laps, and they frequently snuck a hand out from under the blanket to munch on them. </p><p>The movie was one of Dan\u2019s favorites, and he decided that watching it with Phil\u2019s body curled around his, tucked away in their little corner of the world, made it even better. </p><p>Phil had also never seen the movie before, and Dan had brought his own copy of it over ages ago with the intention of watching it. Unfortunately, they had never gotten the chance to until now, but it was hardly an issue. Dan enjoyed Phil\u2019s gasps of surprise, and his frantic panic towards the end of the movie when things were hitting the climax. When the screen faded to the end credits, Phil\u2019s jaw was dropped, shock on his face. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it you enjoyed it?\u201d Dan asked, a smiling. Phil stared at the television for another moment before snapping to attention. </p><p>\u201cLike it? Dan, that was one of the <i>coolest</i> movies I\u2019ve ever seen. And it\u2019s based off of a book, you said? God, I need to read it, oh my gosh.\u201d Phil continued rambling about his favorite parts, and he talked about his thought process through the movie. \u201cI swear I thought Andy was guilty! But then he got some proof that he wasn\u2019t, and they <i>shot</i> the guy!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep. Really makes you think, huh?\u201d </p><p>Phil laughed. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d </p><p>Dan smiled, happy that Phil had enjoyed something that Dan loved. He pecked Phil\u2019s lips with his own before mustering the willpower to scoot out of their little blanket cocoon. </p><p>\u201cCan you take it out of the DVD player? I\u2019ll take care of our scraps.\u201d </p><p>Phil was still smiling softly at him, and the look was making Dan\u2019s insides feel all warm and gooey. Not that long ago that would have terrified him, but now it just made Dan\u2019s grin go wider. </p><p>He quickly washed the bowl to get the butter off of the sides and put it back in Phil\u2019s cabinet. Before he left he shut the rest of Phil\u2019s cabinet doors, rolling his eyes. Phil could look at a bunch of nonsense numbers and measurements and predict the weather, but the man couldn\u2019t bother himself to close a cabinet door. </p><p>Dan walked back into the lounge, ready to tease Phil about it, but stopped when he found him standing next to the couch, reading something on his phone. His eyebrows were crinkled and the corners of his mouth were turned down in something between a frown and a grimace. The expression caused the joke on Dan\u2019s lips to wither, and for a moment Dan just stood there, watching Phil. He didn\u2019t seem to know that Dan was back in the room. </p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d </p><p>Phil jumped at Dan\u2019s voice shattering the silence, and slipped his phone back into his pocket. The small smile plastered on Phil\u2019s face was fake, and Dan could tell that Phil was trying to figure out what to say. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just an email from work.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTesco emailed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the weatherstation.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dan didn\u2019t know if he should keep pushing, but when he thought about the frown on Phil\u2019s face just a little bit ago and how his shoulders were curled in anxiety, Dan\u2019s resolution hardened. He knew first hand what something negative could do if it was allowed to fester, and he didn\u2019t want that to happen to Phil. \u201cWas it something bad?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d Phil said, his fingers sliding into his pockets. Dan couldn\u2019t help but frown at that. Phil stuck his hands in his pockets when he was uncomfortable. Was Dan making him feel like that? \u201cMy schedule just got changed up a bit. I\u2019m going to have to ring Tesco to have them adjust my shifts so none of them overlap.\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded, but there was no doubt in his mind that Phil wasn\u2019t telling the truth. Another glance at Phil\u2019s hands in his pockets held back Dan\u2019s tongue, however. He didn\u2019t want to make Phil uncomfortable or anxious. </p><p>Dan decided to drop the subject, but he didn\u2019t let his suspicions fall. </p><p>\u201cDid you want to call them now? I can step back into the kitchen if you want?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Phil said, his arms flinching like he wanted to move them, but decided not to at the last minute. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I promise. I\u2019ll call them in the morning\u2014I don\u2019t think anybody would pick up, anyways. Come on, it\u2019s my turn to pick a movie.\u201d </p><p>Phil gave Dan one last strained smile before turning all of his attention to the shelf of movies he owned. Dan was still frowning, worried about what had really been on Phil\u2019s phone, and even more worried about Phil, but he didn\u2019t say anything. Dan didn\u2019t think that Phil really looked at the selection and more-or-less just popped a random disc into the DVD player. After pressing play, Phil caught Dan\u2019s wrists and pulled him to the sofa. They settled back under the blanket, but this time Phil was holding Dan against his chest, his arms wrapped around Dan to keep him close. He pressed a soft kiss to Dan\u2019s temple. </p><p>\u201cRelax, everything\u2019s fine, I promise.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t do much to ease Dan\u2019s thoughts, but he did relax his body, as well as tuck his worried thoughts away to deal with later. For now, he just wanted to enjoy this time with Phil.</p>",

Topped with all of the Christmas decorations around and nestled into Phil\u2019s side, their hands threaded, Dan really couldn\u2019t imagine a better way of spending his day off. </p><p>Their first stop was Starbucks\u2014a Dan and Phil tradition. They\u2019d gone to a Starbucks for their first \u201cdate\u201d on one of Dan\u2019s lunch breaks, and ever since, they\u2019d hit it a half a dozen times together in the several weeks of their relationship. </p><p>Phil ordered while Dan snagged them a table in the corner. He returned however, with a horrendous amount of foam on his coffee and a simple protest of \u201cit\u2019s flavored leave me alone.\u201d Phil then proceeded to take a huge sip, leaving a hefty foam mustache on his upper lip. Dan laughed hysterically and couldn\u2019t help but snap a picture of Phil\u2019s adorable pout, sending it to Jaime after saving it to his phone. He was surprised when his phone beeped almost right away. She was down in London today working on the play, and it was too early for her to be on her lunch break already. </p><p><br></p><p><b>&gt;&gt; From: my maraschino cherry<br></b><i>look at you two and ur coffee dates ur<br></i><i>sickening</i></p><p><i>also</i></p><p><i>how much foam did he ask for that man<br></i>is living in a world w/o god</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>&gt;&gt; To: my maraschino cherry<br></b><i>too much. the answer is too much</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>\u201cIs that Jaime? You two aren\u2019t conspiring against me again, are you?\u201d </p><p>Dan snorted and took a sip of his own coffee (with a normal amount of foam, thank you very much). </p><p>\u201cIf you count conspiring as us dragging you for the sheer amount of foam on that coffee, then yes, absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Unlike <i>you</i>, I refuse to be subjected to society\u2019s standards as to what is acceptable with coffee. Besides, what do you know? My coffee is <i>fantastic</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSome lines just shouldn\u2019t be crossed, mate, and a gallon of foam is one of them. And you\u2019re forgetting\u2014I literally <i>make</i> coffee for a living. I think I have the right to judge.\u201d Dan said, rolling his eyes in the fondest way possible. Phil grumbled as if he was annoyed, but Dan could tell that he didn\u2019t really mean it. </p><p>Dan leaned back against the chair and watched Phil as he used the front camera on his phone to make sure he wiped away all of the foam from the top of his lip. Was that creepy? Maybe. But Dan just couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off of Phil, as cliche as it was. Phil was just <i>Phil</i>\u2014Dan couldn\u2019t ignore him if he tried. </p><p>\u201cWhat, did I miss some of it?\u201d Phil asked, already pulling his phone back out of his pocket. Dan grabbed his hand to stop the movement. </p><p>\u201cNo, you spork, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Dan said softly. </p><p>Phil\u2019s face brightened and a sly smile spread across his face. \u201cSo,\u201d he drawled, \u201cwhatcha looking at then?\u201d </p><p>Dan let his thumb flitter over the tops of Phil\u2019s knuckles before answering. </p><p>\u201cA dork.\u201d </p><p><i>\u201cHey!\u201d</i></p><p>Dan cackled as Phil crossed his arms and pouted. He started whining about how Dan was being a \u201cterrible boyfriend\u201d and \u201cfirst the foam now this,\u201d and he was being so ridiculous that Dan only laughed harder. Phil just kept going though, and Dan tried to shush him in between giggles, but to no avail. </p><p><i>What an absolute fucking nerd,</i> Dan thought as he gave up trying to stop Phil with words and instead pulled him forward into a kiss. Dan was still trying to control his laughter so he wasn\u2019t even really kissing properly and pretty much just smiling against Phil\u2019s mouth, but it worked perfectly. Phil shut up instantly and kissed back. His arm snaked around Dan\u2019s waist loosely, but it still sent a tingle up Dan\u2019s spine anyways. </p><p>Dan pulled back a little, his cheeks aching from laughing. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no, come back here.\u201d Phil dragged Dan right back to his side, and this time the kiss was a proper one. When Phil let go of him Dan knew his cheeks were dusted pink, and in his own opinion the blush probably matched the warm feeling in his chest. </p><p>Phil hummed, smiling softly down at Dan. \u201cCute.\u201d </p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but they both knew that didn\u2019t mean anything. </p><p>After they finished their coffees, they wandered out into the city. Earlier in the week they had planned out all of the stores they had wanted to visit, but things ended up taking longer than expected because they couldn\u2019t stop themselves from walking into every building that had something that caught their eye. With all of the extra stops, the shopping trip had to be split in half by lunch. Dan didn\u2019t mind though. A nice lunch in a little corner cafe with Phil was a pleasant and welcomed surprise. </p><p>Dan found his Christmas present for Jaime, and nearly bought one for Phil as well. The only thing that stopped Dan from buying the galaxy jumper was the fact that it was about twice as much as Dan\u2019s already small and strained budget. </p><p>It was nearing the evening when they stepped through the threshold of Phil\u2019s apartment. The day had been incredibly fun, and Dan didn\u2019t even mind that he was tired from all of the walking that they had done, or that the tip of his nose was near froze from the cold air. </p><p>Dan dropped the bags in his hands down onto the floor next to Phil\u2019s. He reached back up for the zipper on his coat, but Phil\u2019s hands batted it out of the way. Surprised, Dan raised an eyebrow at Phil, but it went unaddressed by the older man. Phil slipped the coat from Dan\u2019s shoulders and hung it up. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go pick out a movie, Dan? I\u2019m in a bit of a mood for popcorn and snuggling under a blanket.\u201d </p><p>He retreated back to the lounge, the faint blush on his cheeks from Phil taking his coat off for him dissipating. It had been domestic and Dan enjoyed being taken care of, shoot him. </p><p>Dan settled on a bit of a classic and popped it into the DVD player. Behind him he could hear Phil starting the microwave, and even though they had ate not that long ago, Dan\u2019s stomach grumbled at the smell of the butter. Dan pulled one of the many blankets Phil had off of the back of the couch and wrapped it around him. He left half of it off to the side for Phil. </p><p>\u201cYou can start it! I\u2019ll be right in.\u201d </p><p>The opening credits of <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> had finished playing by the time Phil surfaced, but it was with a large bowl of popcorn and accompanying sweets, which made up for lost cuddle time in Dan\u2019s mind. </p><p>A few moments later Phil was settled under the blanket, pressed next to Dan. The snacks were in a pile on their laps, and they frequently snuck a hand out from under the blanket to munch on them. </p><p>The movie was one of Dan\u2019s favorites, and he decided that watching it with Phil\u2019s body curled around his, tucked away in their little corner of the world, made it even better. </p><p>Phil had also never seen the movie before, and Dan had brought his own copy of it over ages ago with the intention of watching it. Unfortunately, they had never gotten the chance to until now, but it was hardly an issue. Dan enjoyed Phil\u2019s gasps of surprise, and his frantic panic towards the end of the movie when things were hitting the climax. When the screen faded to the end credits, Phil\u2019s jaw was dropped, shock on his face. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it you enjoyed it?\u201d Dan asked, a smiling. Phil stared at the television for another moment before snapping to attention. </p><p>\u201cLike it? Dan, that was one of the <i>coolest</i> movies I\u2019ve ever seen. And it\u2019s based off of a book, you said? God, I need to read it, oh my gosh.\u201d Phil continued rambling about his favorite parts, and he talked about his thought process through the movie. \u201cI swear I thought Andy was guilty! But then he got some proof that he wasn\u2019t, and they <i>shot</i> the guy!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep. Really makes you think, huh?\u201d </p><p>Phil laughed. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d </p><p>Dan smiled, happy that Phil had enjoyed something that Dan loved. He pecked Phil\u2019s lips with his own before mustering the willpower to scoot out of their little blanket cocoon. </p><p>\u201cCan you take it out of the DVD player? I\u2019ll take care of our scraps.\u201d </p><p>Phil was still smiling softly at him, and the look was making Dan\u2019s insides feel all warm and gooey. Not that long ago that would have terrified him, but now it just made Dan\u2019s grin go wider. </p><p>He quickly washed the bowl to get the butter off of the sides and put it back in Phil\u2019s cabinet. Before he left he shut the rest of Phil\u2019s cabinet doors, rolling his eyes. Phil could look at a bunch of nonsense numbers and measurements and predict the weather, but the man couldn\u2019t bother himself to close a cabinet door. </p><p>Dan walked back into the lounge, ready to tease Phil about it, but stopped when he found him standing next to the couch, reading something on his phone. His eyebrows were crinkled and the corners of his mouth were turned down in something between a frown and a grimace. The expression caused the joke on Dan\u2019s lips to wither, and for a moment Dan just stood there, watching Phil. He didn\u2019t seem to know that Dan was back in the room. </p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d </p><p>Phil jumped at Dan\u2019s voice shattering the silence, and slipped his phone back into his pocket. The small smile plastered on Phil\u2019s face was fake, and Dan could tell that Phil was trying to figure out what to say. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just an email from work.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTesco emailed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the weatherstation.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dan didn\u2019t know if he should keep pushing, but when he thought about the frown on Phil\u2019s face just a little bit ago and how his shoulders were curled in anxiety, Dan\u2019s resolution hardened. He knew first hand what something negative could do if it was allowed to fester, and he didn\u2019t want that to happen to Phil. \u201cWas it something bad?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d Phil said, his fingers sliding into his pockets. Dan couldn\u2019t help but frown at that. Phil stuck his hands in his pockets when he was uncomfortable. Was Dan making him feel like that? \u201cMy schedule just got changed up a bit. I\u2019m going to have to ring Tesco to have them adjust my shifts so none of them overlap.\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded, but there was no doubt in his mind that Phil wasn\u2019t telling the truth. Another glance at Phil\u2019s hands in his pockets held back Dan\u2019s tongue, however. He didn\u2019t want to make Phil uncomfortable or anxious. </p><p>Dan decided to drop the subject, but he didn\u2019t let his suspicions fall. </p><p>\u201cDid you want to call them now? I can step back into the kitchen if you want?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Phil said, his arms flinching like he wanted to move them, but decided not to at the last minute. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I promise. I\u2019ll call them in the morning\u2014I don\u2019t think anybody would pick up, anyways. Come on, it\u2019s my turn to pick a movie.\u201d </p><p>Phil gave Dan one last strained smile before turning all of his attention to the shelf of movies he owned. Dan was still frowning, worried about what had really been on Phil\u2019s phone, and even more worried about Phil, but he didn\u2019t say anything. Dan didn\u2019t think that Phil really looked at the selection and more-or-less just popped a random disc into the DVD player. After pressing play, Phil caught Dan\u2019s wrists and pulled him to the sofa. They settled back under the blanket, but this time Phil was holding Dan against his chest, his arms wrapped around Dan to keep him close. He pressed a soft kiss to Dan\u2019s temple. </p><p>\u201cRelax, everything\u2019s fine, I promise.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t do much to ease Dan\u2019s thoughts, but he did relax his body, as well as tuck his worried thoughts away to deal with later. For now, he just wanted to enjoy this time with Phil.</p>",

It was small and had basic furniture that looked as if it had come from the same dull color scheme, but Dan didn&rsquo;t really mind. He wouldn&rsquo;t be here very long.<b><br /></b></p><p>A tired secretary looked up at him as he entered, but when Dan settled in one of the seats in front of the television, she looked back down at her paperwork, a frown still on her face. </p><p>Dan looked up at the TV and smiled wide. It was on the same channel that the weather station aired, and on it Phil was grinning and relaying the temperatures for the day and how the sun for once would be shining for most of the afternoon. </p><p>Dan sat and watched the whole time Phil was on, a goofy smile on his face. When the angle switched to the news anchors, Dan&rsquo;s attention drifted to his phone, where he scrolled through twitter for a little. Now that Phil wasn&rsquo;t on the live broadcast he&rsquo;d be in a separate room, recording a few different takes of a handful of different weather broadcasts that the station could air later in the day, depending on which of their predictions were correct. And since Phil was here as an employee and not an intern today, as soon as he was done, they could leave. </p><p>They&rsquo;d been dating for a few weeks at this point, and with Dan&rsquo;s workaholic schedule and Phil&rsquo;s two jobs, most time between them had been lunch breaks and an impromptu sleepover, or a few hours together of kissing and movies and video games before reality once again rained on their parade. Today however, Dan was off due to the shop being closed so it could get some of its appliances replaced, and Phil had his whole day off as well minus his morning broadcast. They were planning on spending it together and to shop and wander around Manchester as it rapidly neared the holiday season. </p><p>Dan thought that a day just for the two of them was <i>long</i> overdue. </p><p>A few people came and went while Dan was sitting there, and he eventually stopped looking up so hopefully since every time he only got a stranger returning his excitement with a look of bewilderment at Dan&rsquo;s gaze. And besides, had he gotten a little caught up in scrolling through the various threads? Maybe. Had he gotten comfortable in his seat and popped his earbuds in? Possibly. Did Phil ever give him a ball-park time as to when he would be done? No. So he really had no business materializing out of nowhere and hooking a finger under Dan&rsquo;s chin, tilting his head up and kissing him in greeting. Dan&rsquo;s legs just went jelly even though he wasn&rsquo;t standing, and his thoughts flatlined. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; Dan said eloquently when Phil pulled back. Phil laughed and helped Dan up. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello to you too. I&rsquo;m all done by the way&mdash;are you ready to get out of here? I distinctly remember planning a whole day together with my boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan managed something between a breathy &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; and &ldquo;of course&rdquo; and let Phil grab his hand, leading him outside dumbly, still overwhelmed with how easily this cliche bastard could knock all of the breath out of his lungs. He simultaneously hoped that he would eventually get used to it&mdash;becoming a stuttering mess was highly inconvenient at times&mdash;and also never wanted that feeling of devotion to go away. </p><p>The sun was surprisingly warm for early December, and the sky was clearer than Dan had seen it in an awfully long time.

The small smile plastered on Phil&rsquo;s face was fake, and Dan could tell that Phil was trying to figure out what to say. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s just an email from work.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tesco emailed you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, the weatherstation.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Dan didn&rsquo;t know if he should keep pushing, but when he thought about the frown on Phil&rsquo;s face just a little bit ago and how his shoulders were curled in anxiety, Dan&rsquo;s resolution hardened. He knew first hand what something negative could do if it was allowed to fester, and he didn&rsquo;t want that to happen to Phil. &ldquo;Was it something bad?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, not really.&rdquo; Phil said, his fingers sliding into his pockets. Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but frown at that. Phil stuck his hands in his pockets when he was uncomfortable. Was Dan making him feel like that? &ldquo;My schedule just got changed up a bit. I&rsquo;m going to have to ring Tesco to have them adjust my shifts so none of them overlap.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nodded, but there was no doubt in his mind that Phil wasn&rsquo;t telling the truth. Another glance at Phil&rsquo;s hands in his pockets held back Dan&rsquo;s tongue, however. He didn&rsquo;t want to make Phil uncomfortable or anxious. </p><p>Dan decided to drop the subject, but he didn&rsquo;t let his suspicions fall. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you want to call them now? I can step back into the kitchen if you want?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Phil said, his arms flinching like he wanted to move them, but decided not to at the last minute. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I promise. I&rsquo;ll call them in the morning&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think anybody would pick up, anyways. Come on, it&rsquo;s my turn to pick a movie.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil gave Dan one last strained smile before turning all of his attention to the shelf of movies he owned. Dan was still frowning, worried about what had really been on Phil&rsquo;s phone, and even more worried about Phil, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Dan didn&rsquo;t think that Phil really looked at the selection and more-or-less just popped a random disc into the DVD player. After pressing play, Phil caught Dan&rsquo;s wrists and pulled him to the sofa. They settled back under the blanket, but this time Phil was holding Dan against his chest, his arms wrapped around Dan to keep him close. He pressed a soft kiss to Dan&rsquo;s temple. </p><p>&ldquo;Relax, everything&rsquo;s fine, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t do much to ease Dan&rsquo;s thoughts, but he did relax his body, as well as tuck his worried thoughts away to deal with later. For now, he just wanted to enjoy this time with Phil.</p>",
