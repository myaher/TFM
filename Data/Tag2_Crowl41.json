The boy scurried back to his parents and Crowley picked up his sunglasses from near Aziraphale&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;<i>Tartan socks. I should&rsquo;ve known.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;he thought to himself and smiled.</p><p>He hurriedly put on his glasses and quickly looked around. No one had noticed them. &ldquo;<i>Great,\"&nbsp;</i>Crowley thought&nbsp;<i>\"think I spooked this one too.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Aziraphale was still staring at him and Crowley shrank in his seat. Aziraphale broke out of his trance and immediately apologized for staring. Thankfully, the waiter arrived with their sushi and broke the awkward tension between them.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you always wear those?&rdquo; Aziraphale asked softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, well, people get freaked out quite a lot,&rdquo; Crowley muttered, &ldquo;so I cover &lsquo;em up.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale tilted his head to the side. He let out a small laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should hide those beautiful eyes behind your sunglasses.&rdquo; He said.</p><p>Crowley choked on a piece of fish but immediately covered it up to look like a cough. He drank some wine while Aziraphale ate his own food.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; He finally said. Crowley couldn&rsquo;t believe someone called his eyes beautiful. His brain stopped processing everything else Aziraphale had started saying and kept repeating the same phrase back to back in Aziraphale&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>Aziraphale, however, kept babbling on about how global warming had started to affect the planet to change the topic but he soon realised Crowley wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. He truly didn&rsquo;t want to lose Crowley&rsquo;s friendship over such a trivial compliment.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Well all you did was call his eyes beautiful! It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal&rdquo;</i>His thoughts rushed,&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;he called you angel no less than an hour ago. You&rsquo;re both even now.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Slowly they both realised that neither of them was talking to the other. They had just sat there staring at one another and delving into their own thoughts. Neither of them moved because they had no idea how to get out of this situation without making it any more awkward.</p><p>Aziraphale decided that an apology would be the simplest way. Crowley decided to continue talking about what Aziraphale was saying. Unfortunately, he had no idea as to what had been said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sor-&rdquo; Aziraphale started.</p><p>&ldquo;So you were talking about your favourite book right?&rdquo; Crowley interrupted. He winced behind his glasses realising that this was probably not what Aziraphale was talking about and how he could have just said sorry but too late now.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah yes, my dear. I was in the middle of telling you how much I love Shakespeare\"&nbsp; Aziraphale smiled as he grabbed the opportunity to change the subject and make Crowley feel more at ease.</p><p>Crowley relaxed in his chair and grinned as Aziraphale rambled about Othello and Hamlet and all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays. Crowley paid attention to every word this time. Well not every word, he sometimes got lost in Aziraphale&rsquo;s sweet voice and miss out on a few sentences, but he tried his best to pay his full attention.</p><p>Aziraphale on the other hand was happily analysing all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works and somewhere in the midst of his rambles he realised that he might be boring Crowley to death. However, one glance at his companion told him that Crowley was one of, if not the only person who liked listening to what Aziraphale had to say.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s how the pair spent their day. One listening to the other passionately talk about something they liked. One silently sipping wine and nodding at parts where they agreed with the other. And both of them having a great long&nbsp;<strike>debate</strike>&nbsp;discussion about a matter they both were passionate about.&nbsp;</p></p>",
