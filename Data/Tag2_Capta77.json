your daughter needs you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>carols head snaps up. she blinks slowly, unfurling her hand from around the warm glass of her beer&nbsp;&ldquo;i thought&hellip;&rdquo; she starts, stops.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;i know what you thought, it&rsquo;s a lot of the same things my daughter thought. but she&rsquo;s,&rdquo; mrs. rambeau slips&nbsp;&ldquo;she&rsquo;s gone and i&rsquo;ve found myself doing a lot of thinking, a lot of praying. i do not understand what you and my daughter shared. but i do understand that you love monica, and that your absence in her life is causing her more pain. pain she does not need.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>carol doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. she swallows hard, and mrs. rambeau continues&nbsp;&ldquo;also,&rdquo; she takes a shaking breath, &ldquo;you loved my daughter. that much i think i&rsquo;ve known for a long time and it would be a dishonour on her memory if you drowned yourself in a bottle, and if i let you do it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>faced with that, carol finds herself staggering into the passenger seat of a car and then, in what feels like the blink of an eye, waking up on the rambeau&rsquo;s couch.&nbsp;</p><p>she&rsquo;s hungover.&nbsp;</p><p>she&rsquo;s hurting in more ways than she knows how to describe, and,&nbsp;</p><p>she sees monica watching her from the doorway, asking in a small voice&nbsp;&ldquo;can we watch cartoons? it&rsquo;s saturday.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>carol decides she can do this.&nbsp;</p><p>for maria. for monica.&nbsp;</p><p>later on, when monica is playing outside, carol and the rambeau&rsquo;s have a conversation in the cramped kitchen. they explain to her that if she&rsquo;s going to be here, play a pivotal role in monica&rsquo;s life, she&rsquo;s going to be sober and employed.&nbsp;</p><p>they care very little for the amount of money in carol&rsquo;s bank account, but they do agree that a swath of land in lousiana could serve as a fresh start. something that could do them all a great deal of good.&nbsp;</p><p>so they move.&nbsp;</p><p>carol thinks about how maria would have loved it here, in the quiet and the fresh air.&nbsp;</p><p>carol thinks about maria every day.&nbsp;</p><p>every day for six years.&nbsp;</p><p>time passes, she works as a mechanic and then more or less runs her own shop. less of a shop and more of a drop in service that gives her the free time to be with monica and the rambeau&rsquo;s. it&rsquo;s not the life she imagined.&nbsp;</p><p>but it&rsquo;s something.&nbsp;</p><p>it&rsquo;s a life.&nbsp;</p><p>it&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp;</p><p>then, of course, someone sidles into her workshop all&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m looking for someone named carol danvers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p>and monica is running over because this goddamn ghost of a person looks just like her mom and carol is,&nbsp;</p><p>well,&nbsp;</p><p>she is skeptical in the same moment that her heart is soaring. she&rsquo;s grabbing a wrench and she&rsquo;s saying&nbsp;</p><p><i>monica, honey, get behind me.&nbsp;</i></p><p>because maria was dead and gone and she can&rsquo;t possibly be standing here, with some strange dude behind her. he&rsquo;s a government type, that much is obvious maria though? carol can&rsquo;t pin her down. she looks the same, and yet different.&nbsp;</p><p>it scares her.&nbsp;</p><p>she has monica behind her back with one hand, and a wrench in the other.&nbsp;</p><p>she&rsquo;s facing monica down and saying&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;what, no, honey i&rsquo;m home?&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;</p><p>monica blinks, no smile, no recognition, only&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m not the person you think i am.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p>carol&rsquo;s stomach twists.&nbsp;</p><p>of course, mrs. rambeau, three years a widow, comes running out from the house. before carol can stop her, and not as if carol could stop her if she wanted to because, well&nbsp;</p><p>mrs. rambeau has no question about the fact that the woman standing before her is her previously dead daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>things get even less straight forward after that.&nbsp;</p><p>carol finds herself sitting in the kitchen with her sort of no-longer-dead-wife, explaining that her name isn&rsquo;t beau, that she&rsquo;s not a kree. carol finds herself with tears in her eyes and fighting to reach across the table and take her not-so-dead-wife&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;</p><p>carol also finds herself putting down the wrench because this woman, this woman is her wife. it&rsquo;s her wife and her wife isn&rsquo;t dead. she has these superpowers and this sadness in her eyes. but she&rsquo;s alive, and that&rsquo;s enough for carol.&nbsp;</p><p>not long after that, carol is shamed into participating in a rescue mission of sorts by both her daughter and her mother-in-law. she finds herself a cockpit for the first time in six years. she finds herself in space, then a spaceship, and then a dogfight.&nbsp;</p><p>she finds herself watching her wife, fly around, glowing like a goddamn glowstick.&nbsp;</p><p>she finds herself in lousiana, having dinner with aliens and fielding a job offer from some guy named nick and,&nbsp;</p><p>and preparing to say good-bye to her wife. she can tell from the look in maria&rsquo;s eyes as the aliens talk that she&rsquo;s going to help them&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;i&rsquo;ve found my family, i have to help them find theirs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p>and of course she is, carol expects nothing less.&nbsp;</p><p>it hurts all the same though. monica standing by carols side, watching her mom prepare to leave, leather jacket around her shoulders. she swims in it.&nbsp;</p><p>carol watches maria leave, unsure when she&rsquo;ll be back, but holding a pager in her hand carol knows that at some point,&nbsp;</p><p>maria will return.&nbsp;</p>",
