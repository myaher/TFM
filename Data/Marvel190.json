Hope your nights good. Seeing\nyou, it\u2019s stuck in my head now. Not to sound heavy, but it all came rushing\nback. I wonder if you remember the silly string fights? The countless football\ngames? Spring break Jr. year? I was thinking about the first time we met\ntonight. I remember the way you smiled at me. It was so different from today.\nYet the same in so many ways. I\u2019m rambling, guess you still have that effect on\nme.</i></p><p><br/></p><p><b>You:</b> <i>Hey love. Seeing you, wow. You ever need\nsomething so bad, but you don\u2019t know you need it till it happens? If that makes\nsense, I guess. You mean the week of hell? Nat and Buck broke up. She spent the\nwhole trip crying, drunk and throwing up. God, I can\u2019t stop laughing now. How\ndo you still do that, after all this time? Make me laugh when I\u2019m lying on rock\nbottom. Of course I remember that day, it changed my whole life. I smiled at\nyou, and you lit up like you won the Jackpot. Tell me something about you from\nthe last eight years. Something about you, I don\u2019t know<b>.</b></i><b><br/></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Steve:</b> <i>No, that makes sense, I get that. I think\nthat\u2019s how it was for me too. Buck was no better. He was drunk, angry and\nthrowing up, it was a long week. Are you okay? I mean, I know it\u2019s been a long\ntime, but you know I\u2019ll do anything to make you smile. That\u2019s cause, when you\nsmiled at me, I felt like I won the Jackpot. That\u2019s how it always felt with\nyou. As long as you were smiling everything in the world was right. Something\nabout me, wow not much has changed. It\u2019s getting late, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re\nfalling asleep. Guess something about me would be, I\u2019m still hopelessly in love\nwith you. You\u2019re still the only girl for me, you\u2019re still my girl, eight years\nlater.<br/>\nIf you have a boyfriend, he better be ready for a fight. I\u2019m not walking away\nagain. I love you Y/N and I\u2019m never going to stop.</i></p><p>Your hands shake as you set your phone on the bed. Your body\nflushes warm, your throat tightens. You were going to be sick. You manage to\nget to your feet, shuffling across the bedroom floor. Your heart felt like it\nwas going to burst from your chest and skitter across the wood floor. </p><p>Your breath came short and staggered. The room didn\u2019t shift,\nand it didn\u2019t spin, it was just as if someone flipped the light off. Your body\nwent limp, dropping to the bedroom floor with a audible thump. Your bedroom\ndoor flew open moments after.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cY/N?!\u201d Howie rushes in, dropping to the ground next to his\nsister. He rolls her over, checking her pulse. \u201cPeter!\u201d He yells, his voice\nfrantic and scared. Hurried footsteps rush down the hallway, before Peter was\ndropping to the ground next to him and their sisters unconscious body.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter brushes her hair back from her face,\nputting his ear up to her nose and mouth.<br/></p><p>\u201cI just heard her collapse.\u201d Howie shakes his head.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab her tank, you call the doctor.\u201d Peter nods, pushing himself up off\nthe floor. Howie fumbles for his phone in his sweatpants pocket.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You could feel the tube, it laced itself around your ears,\nand tickled your nose. Your lungs gave a raspy breathe in your chest. It was\ntoo bright to be home, the smell of hospital hit you, followed with the sound\nof a heart monitor and the faint paging of doctors from the hall. Your eyes\nopen, Howie sat in the chair, pulled close to your bedside. His hands in his\nhair, his head hung, his elbows on the edge of your bed.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d You croak. Trying to piece together how you got to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Howie looks up, relief floods his face, his eyes\nblood shot \u201cyou\u2019re awake.\u201d He sound close to tears.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You blink, patting the bed for his hand. You could feel the IV\njammed into your vein and taped down on your hand.<br/></p><p>\u201cUm you blacked out.\u201d Howie swallows, squeezing your fingers.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d You look around. Did you black out all night? It\ntypically only lasted a short while.<br/></p><p>\u201cBip,\u201d Howie\u2019s brow pulls together \u201cyou blacked out two days ago.\u201d His bottom\nlip trembled.<br/></p><p>\u201cFuck, no.\u201d You grip his fingers.<br/></p><p>\u201cBreathe, Bip. Stay calm.\u201d He moves, sitting on the edge of the bed.<br/></p><p>\u201cHowie.\u201d Your eyes well up and your voice cracks.<br/></p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d He shakes his head, he kisses the top of your head, his hands\nsmoothing over your cheek and hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He mumbles into your hair. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d He sounded more like he was reassuring himself than you.</p><p>\u201cMae? Is she okay?\u201d You look up panicked at your brother.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scared. She woke up, it was a mess.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cFuck I need to see her.\u201d You swallow the lump in your\nthroat.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick her up and bring her over for you.\u201d He nods.<br/></p><p>\u201cHowie, my phone?\u201d You ask, looking around. He nods, standing up he pulls your\nphone from his pocket.<br/></p><p>\u201cI have it. You have a bunch of unread texts.\u201d He hands it over.<br/></p><p>You\u2019d been texting Steve. Steve\u2019s confessional text message, you left him on\nread. Your body sags with regret. He was probably going nuts, or heart broken.\nWhy did it always come down to you hurting him?</p><p>\u201cThanks How.\u201d You glance at your phone, unsure what you were\ngoing to say to Steve. How did you explain your disappearance? You couldn\u2019t\ntell him the truth, there was too much buried with your lie.</p><p>\u201cYou two texting?\u201d Howie asks, sitting on the edge of the\nbed again.<br/></p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Your lips tremble as you look up from your phone.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you an owl now?\u201d He smirks at you. \u201cThe only person in the world I know\nthat makes your lips do that tremble thing they do.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy does it always come down to me having to hurt him?\u201d You look from your\nphone to Howie.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to hurt him?\u201d His head tips and you hated the way he was\nreading you.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t destroy him the way I am you and Peter. I can\u2019t give him front\nrow seats to watch me die, Howie. He can\u2019t know everything that happened, with\nher,\u201d your eyes well up, tears slip slowly down your cheeks \u201cwas all my fault.\nThat I\u2019m to blame. I can\u2019t destroy him like that.\u201d You swallow, brushing at the\ntears.<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing is your fault Y/N. If you don\u2019t want to give him front row seats, than\nstart fighting.\u201d His tone serious, you refuse to meet his eye.</p><hr><p><b>Everything Peaches 8/23/18:</b><br/><a class=\"tumblelog\"

Hope your nights good. Seeing\nyou, it\u2019s stuck in my head now. Not to sound heavy, but it all came rushing\nback. I wonder if you remember the silly string fights? The countless football\ngames? Spring break Jr. year? I was thinking about the first time we met\ntonight. I remember the way you smiled at me. It was so different from today.\nYet the same in so many ways. I\u2019m rambling, guess you still have that effect on\nme.</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>You:</b> <i>Hey love. Seeing you, wow. You ever need\nsomething so bad, but you don\u2019t know you need it till it happens? If that makes\nsense, I guess. You mean the week of hell? Nat and Buck broke up. She spent the\nwhole trip crying, drunk and throwing up. God, I can\u2019t stop laughing now. How\ndo you still do that, after all this time? Make me laugh when I\u2019m lying on rock\nbottom. Of course I remember that day, it changed my whole life. I smiled at\nyou, and you lit up like you won the Jackpot. Tell me something about you from\nthe last eight years. Something about you, I don\u2019t know<b>.</b></i><b><br></b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Steve:</b> <i>No, that makes sense, I get that. I think\nthat\u2019s how it was for me too. Buck was no better. He was drunk, angry and\nthrowing up, it was a long week. Are you okay? I mean, I know it\u2019s been a long\ntime, but you know I\u2019ll do anything to make you smile. That\u2019s cause, when you\nsmiled at me, I felt like I won the Jackpot. That\u2019s how it always felt with\nyou. As long as you were smiling everything in the world was right. Something\nabout me, wow not much has changed. It\u2019s getting late, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re\nfalling asleep. Guess something about me would be, I\u2019m still hopelessly in love\nwith you. You\u2019re still the only girl for me, you\u2019re still my girl, eight years\nlater.<br>\nIf you have a boyfriend, he better be ready for a fight. I\u2019m not walking away\nagain. I love you Y/N and I\u2019m never going to stop.</i></p><p>Your hands shake as you set your phone on the bed. Your body\nflushes warm, your throat tightens. You were going to be sick. You manage to\nget to your feet, shuffling across the bedroom floor. Your heart felt like it\nwas going to burst from your chest and skitter across the wood floor. </p><p>Your breath came short and staggered. The room didn\u2019t shift,\nand it didn\u2019t spin, it was just as if someone flipped the light off. Your body\nwent limp, dropping to the bedroom floor with a audible thump. Your bedroom\ndoor flew open moments after.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/N?!\u201d Howie rushes in, dropping to the ground next to his\nsister. He rolls her over, checking her pulse. \u201cPeter!\u201d He yells, his voice\nfrantic and scared. Hurried footsteps rush down the hallway, before Peter was\ndropping to the ground next to him and their sisters unconscious body.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter brushes her hair back from her face,\nputting his ear up to her nose and mouth.<br></p><p>\u201cI just heard her collapse.\u201d Howie shakes his head.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab her tank, you call the doctor.\u201d Peter nods, pushing himself up off\nthe floor. Howie fumbles for his phone in his sweatpants pocket.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>You could feel the tube, it laced itself around your ears,\nand tickled your nose. Your lungs gave a raspy breathe in your chest. It was\ntoo bright to be home, the smell of hospital hit you, followed with the sound\nof a heart monitor and the faint paging of doctors from the hall. Your eyes\nopen, Howie sat in the chair, pulled close to your bedside. His hands in his\nhair, his head hung, his elbows on the edge of your bed.<br></p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d You croak. Trying to piece together how you got to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Howie looks up, relief floods his face, his eyes\nblood shot \u201cyou\u2019re awake.\u201d He sound close to tears.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You blink, patting the bed for his hand. You could feel the IV\njammed into your vein and taped down on your hand.<br></p><p>\u201cUm you blacked out.\u201d Howie swallows, squeezing your fingers.<br></p><p>\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d You look around. Did you black out all night? It\ntypically only lasted a short while.<br></p><p>\u201cBip,\u201d Howie\u2019s brow pulls together \u201cyou blacked out two days ago.\u201d His bottom\nlip trembled.<br></p><p>\u201cFuck, no.\u201d You grip his fingers.<br></p><p>\u201cBreathe, Bip. Stay calm.\u201d He moves, sitting on the edge of the bed.<br></p><p>\u201cHowie.\u201d Your eyes well up and your voice cracks.<br></p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d He shakes his head, he kisses the top of your head, his hands\nsmoothing over your cheek and hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He mumbles into your hair. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d He sounded more like he was reassuring himself than you.</p><p>\u201cMae? Is she okay?\u201d You look up panicked at your brother.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scared. She woke up, it was a mess.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cFuck I need to see her.\u201d You swallow the lump in your\nthroat.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick her up and bring her over for you.\u201d He nods.<br></p><p>\u201cHowie, my phone?\u201d You ask, looking around. He nods, standing up he pulls your\nphone from his pocket.<br></p><p>\u201cI have it. You have a bunch of unread texts.\u201d He hands it over.<br></p><p>You\u2019d been texting Steve. Steve\u2019s confessional text message, you left him on\nread. Your body sags with regret. He was probably going nuts, or heart broken.\nWhy did it always come down to you hurting him?</p><p>\u201cThanks How.\u201d You glance at your phone, unsure what you were\ngoing to say to Steve. How did you explain your disappearance? You couldn\u2019t\ntell him the truth, there was too much buried with your lie.</p><p>\u201cYou two texting?\u201d Howie asks, sitting on the edge of the\nbed again.<br></p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Your lips tremble as you look up from your phone.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you an owl now?\u201d He smirks at you. \u201cThe only person in the world I know\nthat makes your lips do that tremble thing they do.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy does it always come down to me having to hurt him?\u201d You look from your\nphone to Howie.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to hurt him?\u201d His head tips and you hated the way he was\nreading you.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t destroy him the way I am you and Peter. I can\u2019t give him front\nrow seats to watch me die, Howie. He can\u2019t know everything that happened, with\nher,\u201d your eyes well up, tears slip slowly down your cheeks \u201cwas all my fault.\nThat I\u2019m to blame. I can\u2019t destroy him like that.\u201d You swallow, brushing at the\ntears.<br></p><p>\u201cNothing is your fault Y/N. If you don\u2019t want to give him front row seats, than\nstart fighting.\u201d His tone serious, you refuse to meet his eye.</p><hr><p><b>Everything Peaches 8/23/18:</b><br><a class=\"tumblelog\"

I love you Y/N and I\u2019m never going to stop.</i></p><p>Your hands shake as you set your phone on the bed. Your body\nflushes warm, your throat tightens. You were going to be sick. You manage to\nget to your feet, shuffling across the bedroom floor. Your heart felt like it\nwas going to burst from your chest and skitter across the wood floor. </p><p>Your breath came short and staggered. The room didn\u2019t shift,\nand it didn\u2019t spin, it was just as if someone flipped the light off. Your body\nwent limp, dropping to the bedroom floor with a audible thump. Your bedroom\ndoor flew open moments after.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/N?!\u201d Howie rushes in, dropping to the ground next to his\nsister. He rolls her over, checking her pulse. \u201cPeter!\u201d He yells, his voice\nfrantic and scared. Hurried footsteps rush down the hallway, before Peter was\ndropping to the ground next to him and their sisters unconscious body.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter brushes her hair back from her face,\nputting his ear up to her nose and mouth.<br></p><p>\u201cI just heard her collapse.\u201d Howie shakes his head.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab her tank, you call the doctor.\u201d Peter nods, pushing himself up off\nthe floor. Howie fumbles for his phone in his sweatpants pocket.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>You could feel the tube, it laced itself around your ears,\nand tickled your nose. Your lungs gave a raspy breathe in your chest. It was\ntoo bright to be home, the smell of hospital hit you, followed with the sound\nof a heart monitor and the faint paging of doctors from the hall. Your eyes\nopen, Howie sat in the chair, pulled close to your bedside. His hands in his\nhair, his head hung, his elbows on the edge of your bed.<br></p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d You croak. Trying to piece together how you got to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Howie looks up, relief floods his face, his eyes\nblood shot \u201cyou\u2019re awake.\u201d He sound close to tears.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You blink, patting the bed for his hand. You could feel the IV\njammed into your vein and taped down on your hand.<br></p><p>\u201cUm you blacked out.\u201d Howie swallows, squeezing your fingers.<br></p><p>\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d You look around. Did you black out all night? It\ntypically only lasted a short while.<br></p><p>\u201cBip,\u201d Howie\u2019s brow pulls together \u201cyou blacked out two days ago.\u201d His bottom\nlip trembled.<br></p><p>\u201cFuck, no.\u201d You grip his fingers.<br></p><p>\u201cBreathe, Bip. Stay calm.\u201d He moves, sitting on the edge of the bed.<br></p><p>\u201cHowie.\u201d Your eyes well up and your voice cracks.<br></p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d He shakes his head, he kisses the top of your head, his hands\nsmoothing over your cheek and hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He mumbles into your hair. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d He sounded more like he was reassuring himself than you.</p><p>\u201cMae? Is she okay?\u201d You look up panicked at your brother.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scared. She woke up, it was a mess.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cFuck I need to see her.\u201d You swallow the lump in your\nthroat.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick her up and bring her over for you.\u201d He nods.<br></p><p>\u201cHowie, my phone?\u201d You ask, looking around. He nods, standing up he pulls your\nphone from his pocket.<br></p><p>\u201cI have it. You have a bunch of unread texts.\u201d He hands it over.<br></p><p>You\u2019d been texting Steve. Steve\u2019s confessional text message, you left him on\nread. Your body sags with regret. He was probably going nuts, or heart broken.\nWhy did it always come down to you hurting him?</p><p>\u201cThanks How.\u201d You glance at your phone, unsure what you were\ngoing to say to Steve. How did you explain your disappearance? You couldn\u2019t\ntell him the truth, there was too much buried with your lie.</p><p>\u201cYou two texting?\u201d Howie asks, sitting on the edge of the\nbed again.<br></p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Your lips tremble as you look up from your phone.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you an owl now?\u201d He smirks at you. \u201cThe only person in the world I know\nthat makes your lips do that tremble thing they do.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy does it always come down to me having to hurt him?\u201d You look from your\nphone to Howie.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to hurt him?\u201d His head tips and you hated the way he was\nreading you.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t destroy him the way I am you and Peter. I can\u2019t give him front\nrow seats to watch me die, Howie. He can\u2019t know everything that happened, with\nher,\u201d your eyes well up, tears slip slowly down your cheeks \u201cwas all my fault.\nThat I\u2019m to blame. I can\u2019t destroy him like that.\u201d You swallow, brushing at the\ntears.<br></p><p>\u201cNothing is your fault Y/N. If you don\u2019t want to give him front row seats, than\nstart fighting.\u201d His tone serious, you refuse to meet his eye.</p><hr><p><b>Everything Peaches 8/23/18:</b><br><a class=\"tumblelog\"

Something about you, I don&rsquo;t know<b>.</b></i><b><br /></b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Steve:</b> <i>No, that makes sense, I get that. I think\nthat&rsquo;s how it was for me too. Buck was no better. He was drunk, angry and\nthrowing up, it was a long week. Are you okay? I mean, I know it&rsquo;s been a long\ntime, but you know I&rsquo;ll do anything to make you smile. That&rsquo;s cause, when you\nsmiled at me, I felt like I won the Jackpot. That&rsquo;s how it always felt with\nyou. As long as you were smiling everything in the world was right. Something\nabout me, wow not much has changed. It&rsquo;s getting late, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re\nfalling asleep. Guess something about me would be, I&rsquo;m still hopelessly in love\nwith you. You&rsquo;re still the only girl for me, you&rsquo;re still my girl, eight years\nlater.<br />\nIf you have a boyfriend, he better be ready for a fight. I&rsquo;m not walking away\nagain. I love you Y/N and I&rsquo;m never going to stop.</i></p><p>Your hands shake as you set your phone on the bed. Your body\nflushes warm, your throat tightens. You were going to be sick. You manage to\nget to your feet, shuffling across the bedroom floor. Your heart felt like it\nwas going to burst from your chest and skitter across the wood floor. </p><p>Your breath came short and staggered. The room didn&rsquo;t shift,\nand it didn&rsquo;t spin, it was just as if someone flipped the light off. Your body\nwent limp, dropping to the bedroom floor with a audible thump. Your bedroom\ndoor flew open moments after.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?!&rdquo; Howie rushes in, dropping to the ground next to his\nsister. He rolls her over, checking her pulse. &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; He yells, his voice\nfrantic and scared. Hurried footsteps rush down the hallway, before Peter was\ndropping to the ground next to him and their sisters unconscious body.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Peter brushes her hair back from her face,\nputting his ear up to her nose and mouth.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I just heard her collapse.&rdquo; Howie shakes his head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grab her tank, you call the doctor.&rdquo; Peter nods, pushing himself up off\nthe floor. Howie fumbles for his phone in his sweatpants pocket.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You could feel the tube, it laced itself around your ears,\nand tickled your nose. Your lungs gave a raspy breathe in your chest. It was\ntoo bright to be home, the smell of hospital hit you, followed with the sound\nof a heart monitor and the faint paging of doctors from the hall. Your eyes\nopen, Howie sat in the chair, pulled close to your bedside. His hands in his\nhair, his head hung, his elbows on the edge of your bed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Whoa.&rdquo; You croak. Trying to piece together how you got to the hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Howie looks up, relief floods his face, his eyes\nblood shot &ldquo;you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; He sound close to tears.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; You blink, patting the bed for his hand. You could feel the IV\njammed into your vein and taped down on your hand.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Um you blacked out.&rdquo; Howie swallows, squeezing your fingers.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How did we get here?&rdquo; You look around. Did you black out all night? It\ntypically only lasted a short while.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bip,&rdquo; Howie&rsquo;s brow pulls together &ldquo;you blacked out two days ago.&rdquo; His bottom\nlip trembled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, no.&rdquo; You grip his fingers.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Breathe, Bip. Stay calm.&rdquo; He moves, sitting on the edge of the bed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Howie.&rdquo; Your eyes well up and your voice cracks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Shush.&rdquo; He shakes his head, he kisses the top of your head, his hands\nsmoothing over your cheek and hair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; He mumbles into your hair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; He sounded more like he was reassuring himself than you.</p><p>&ldquo;Mae? Is she okay?&rdquo; You look up panicked at your brother.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s scared. She woke up, it was a mess.&rdquo; He nods.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck I need to see her.&rdquo; You swallow the lump in your\nthroat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick her up and bring her over for you.&rdquo; He nods.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Howie, my phone?&rdquo; You ask, looking around. He nods, standing up he pulls your\nphone from his pocket.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I have it. You have a bunch of unread texts.&rdquo; He hands it over.<br /></p><p>You&rsquo;d been texting Steve. Steve&rsquo;s confessional text message, you left him on\nread. Your body sags with regret. He was probably going nuts, or heart broken.\nWhy did it always come down to you hurting him?</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks How.&rdquo; You glance at your phone, unsure what you were\ngoing to say to Steve. How did you explain your disappearance? You couldn&rsquo;t\ntell him the truth, there was too much buried with your lie.</p><p>&ldquo;You two texting?&rdquo; Howie asks, sitting on the edge of the\nbed again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Your lips tremble as you look up from your phone.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you an owl now?&rdquo; He smirks at you. &ldquo;The only person in the world I know\nthat makes your lips do that tremble thing they do.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why does it always come down to me having to hurt him?&rdquo; You look from your\nphone to Howie.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have to hurt him?&rdquo; His head tips and you hated the way he was\nreading you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t destroy him the way I am you and Peter. I can&rsquo;t give him front\nrow seats to watch me die, Howie. He can&rsquo;t know everything that happened, with\nher,&rdquo; your eyes well up, tears slip slowly down your cheeks &ldquo;was all my fault.\nThat I&rsquo;m to blame. I can&rsquo;t destroy him like that.&rdquo; You swallow, brushing at the\ntears.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing is your fault Y/N. If you don&rsquo;t want to give him front row seats, than\nstart fighting.&rdquo; His tone serious, you refuse to meet his eye.</p><hr /><p><b>Everything Peaches 8/23/18:</b><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJMZIYfYDu01BG_CqBel1ew\">@mo320</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIQ5QuBQV9nZuFdOAC9trzQ\">@izzy&ndash;lee</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7hp9PrwhrlgcxqOFy7_Iw\">@irepeldirt</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMuNunj8Xpa7tNnCVSiiDjQ\">@alyssaj23</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTPuoRdEQ7d2cGyn1T0UHxg\">@elle88531</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml54HW9XgjnYRS5IySPyLmg\">@allyp1023</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NVT36WtTA9yZHRpgKDp0g\">@itsemmyb</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1YMu3WxBCnnIZhTYWC07Ew\">@kgbrenner</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_d5TEDyyflGSxhvGDYd3nw\">@violinbetty</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdCEpSWXTDp4RlmDZEKlsRQ\">@jade-taillia</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-rphpEN2JYj5ks7GhXT2NA\">@sarahp879</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQrgsmzlp43kRsBK1OgYU3A\">@raquegp02</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjW7i5rkE1EoH84r-7psX6g\">@rileyloves5</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVBwwh7FYw8NqsOxw5lU5A\">@flashfanfics</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-DRdd55zVXiUAeCSgnUnhQ\">@pigwidgexn</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrKxLogMT8ZRX6bEe4cre_A\">@bfuckjames</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzmhiAhdx-r0LJpHZ3QJJKQ\">@pcterpvrker</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/manO6wuvKs0i-zALO25W5Eg\">@bluebird214</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5-W4-BFZ2Pcyrs7hE510bg\">@teller258316</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSnTWCmjnS-bS7Fbhpj3rag\">@wandressfox</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNp3ooDgio73B-I_XHqvVPQ\">@amandab-ftw</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQxq9pqtJWSHDaPfB-ilG_g\">@henrietteoaks</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4W3-6NwgB8G7UzMqEwJQzQ\">@bettercallsabs</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvukr8lRkKPc7nG2z1tYUkA\">@queenforatime</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcR8Qy5H7_sxinRp4AIausQ\">@lucifersnipnips</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIHYPrA9K17DaZ-8cJT_QYA\">@queenkrissy11</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mheS4EfFwvnlNLEuAFjkgbA\">@destiel-artemis</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\">@paintballkid711</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhEWNzhyqv9JOab4jt8q_hw\">@freakingnerd99</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDLcx0ai0Bge8ukv6L-7sHg\">@sweet-honey15</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFwsC3hNBmAK7tQoOGbY-_w\">@mellxander1993</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\">@geeksareunique</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZrDKOEjDHfGdcOpeVeVPCw\">@spookygrantaire</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFgUWNDbx_5iFCFmLgYTbfA\">@supernatural508</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXQg3IwvcpFIyAZa3X7hzg\">@mariekoukie6661</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwKU-V9XlfGAXwQ_VKpKGcg\">@futuremrsb-r-main</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLKe0ai32q0pHD9A1g2R2g\">@lovemarvelousfics</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m12TpFK-9Q5fJI1M4amPi5Q\">@petersunderoos96</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mATyRLXXpY4c6rZ3JG4ilDQ\">@booktvmoviefangirl</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNJoAjB3Kx4KCu03jmPRzpA\">@justmeinthisworldblr</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myyceKIAqMHADYyZ86ZepwA\">@nerdyandexhausted</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcaAvC1NlufQCEvr3kkgotA\">@kingarthurofslytherin</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8uLNHbhfehEqvAArAxhOVQ\">@supernaturaldean67</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mksApY5mU-BllwX2TyuEkJA\">@xqueenofthecraziesx</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqTRDgsPHPygUiOmoEFRgNQ\">@writingaworldofmyown</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9FbkwjNxTKhnd1j8rudhlQ\">@villainsaremorerelatable</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOy4iqFrF2gcYgDHCYnyIbw\">@ocaptain-mycaptainmorgan</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJHPIWxWGczWtrGZUmZoAbg\">@extreme-supernatural-lover</a><a><br /></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myih3tdt6P1IhC0C7ppuZgg\">@wonderlandfandomkingdom</a>\n\n<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqQfVkahriCCsdQewDmhMnA\">@crazy-little-thing-called-buck</a>&nbsp;

Like when avengers are spending christmas together and give each other super funny presents. Of course everything goes wild and y/n breaks her leg and they all freak out. You can change the plot if you don&rsquo;t like it. (Did I mention ily?\ud83d\ude0d)</i> \u2014 <i><b>Anonymous</b></i></p><p><b>Author\u2019s Note</b>: <i>I wanted to say thank you so much for all the love! I\u2019m so happy you enjoy my imagines! It makes me so happy! I loved making this imagine, but I sadly couldn\u2019t work in the broken leg scenario. I tried really hard for the funny presents, though! Feel free to request more!</i></p><p>Tony was normally not a holiday enjoyer, partly due to the fact he never had anyone to spend it with other than girls he managed to get into his bed. He hadn&rsquo;t realized how much everything had changed since then, now standing within a team of Earth&rsquo;s mightiest heroes while simultaneously trying his hardest to be a good father to Y/N, who had joined the picture not long after he was Iron Man. Nowadays, the tower was somehow coated in green and red lights that glimmered from the city&rsquo;s help, every floor in said tower having at least two Christmas trees all decorated by each of the heroes, himself, or Y/N.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tony felt Christmases were much better now, holding Pepper close as he watched his, well&hellip;family enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. Thor finally managed to convince everybody to allow Loki to appear as well. Clint brought his entire family, every year coming adorned in ugly Christmas sweaters for tradition. Bruce and Natasha kept, somehow, finding each other underneath the mistletoe(Bucky and Sam did, too, much to their displeasure). Steve always overdid it with the presents, wanting to put so much effort into every gift for everyone. T'Challa and Shuri tried their best to make appearances, but as a monarch and an influence for Wakanda, they struggled to. (Although, they never missed a chance to upstage Tony in his extravagant gifts). Stephen always said he only came because he had nothing better to do, yet he was always the first guest to arrive. Wanda and Vision always showed up wearing cheesy, matching couple outfits. And, finally, Peter always managed to slip away once his Christmas with Aunt May and Ned were done to visit the Avengers. Overall, Tony thought it was perfect. </p><p>This Christmas, however, everyone was there. Everyone arrived with armfuls of gifts and food, while others brought some old Christmas movies they thought the heroes would enjoy. Soon enough, the topmost floor was full with all the heroes and Y/N alike, conversations booming across everyone. </p><p>Y/N was, as always, speaking quietly with a blushing Peter and amused Shuri as she waved her arms exaggeratingly, her right hand clasped around a cup of eggnog. She was having such a good time as she laughed with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s set a wager, then, Stark girl,&rdquo; Shuri grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet the White Wolf and Falcon will be caught underneath the mistletoe at least four more times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;ll just be one more time,&rdquo; Peter disagreed, eyeing the two in bemusement. Bucky was sitting, pouting more like, with his arms crossed on the sofa while Loki sat beside him, relishing in the man&rsquo;s grumpiness as he offered him a Christmas cookie. Sam had downed four glasses of &lsquo;Adult Eggnog&rsquo; to try to get the taste out of his mouth since he had been forced to kiss Bucky three times from the stupid mistletoe. </p><p>&ldquo;I say just two more before Bucky decides he&rsquo;ll start bringing Steve around with him everywhere so Steve can kiss Sam instead,&rdquo; Y/N guessed, pointing to the blond who was watching blank faced as Thor danced aggressively to the Christmas music playing from the radio. </p><p>&ldquo;Winner gets what?&rdquo; Shuri asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. If I win, you have to build me a blaster like I&rsquo;ve been begging you to,&rdquo; Y/N demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, ooh! If I win, we have to have a sleepover at Wakanda!&rdquo; Peter jumped up and down.</p><p>&ldquo;And if I win, you sign the Stark tower to my brother and we get to evict you,&rdquo; Shuri demanded, suddenly serious.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! Only joking! You should&rsquo;ve seen your face!&rdquo; Shuri snickered before throwing a friendly arm over her shoulders as well as Peter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Nah, if I win, you guys have to watch a show of my choice with me until the series ends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; Y/N and Peter agreed. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, everyone!&rdquo; Steve suddenly called, looking appalled at Thor&rsquo;s dancing. He figured this would be a way to get it to finally stop. &ldquo;Presents!&rdquo; </p><p>As the three walked over, they could see Bucky and Sam also making their way over, unfortunately falling back to the mistletoe again and letting out distressed cries. Everyone else laughed as the two cursed loudly before pecking each other on the lips. Finally, they marched towards the tree to meet their third friend who was doubled over in laughter. </p><p>&ldquo;If they do it one more time, Parker, you&rsquo;re out,&rdquo; Shuri reminded, prodding him on the forehead playfully before she went to meet her brother at the tree who was laughing with Y/N&rsquo;s father about something. Finally, everyone arrived, sitting criss-cross with their families so it&rsquo;d be easier to pass the presents around. </p><p>Thor and Loki sat beside each other, Thor looking very excited and Loki very bored. Clint sat with his family, his wife leaning against him with a soft smile. Natasha and Bruce ended up sitting beside each other, discreetly hiding their interlocked hands. T'Challa, of course, sat with Shuri nearest the tree. Steve sat in the middle of Sam and Bucky, both of which looked very annoyed. Stephen was going to sit by himself, but Wanda and Vision insisted he sit with them. And last, there was the Stark family, Tony kissing his daughter&rsquo;s forehead before he sat beside her with Pepper on the other, also giving her step-daughter a kiss on the forehead. Peter, blushing, went to join them as he got Y/N&rsquo;s other side, smiling crookedly at her. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s get started,&rdquo; Steve smiled, clapping his hands together as he grabbed the first gift. It looked as if it were wrapped by a toddler, since it crinkled around all the edges and there was far too much tape than was actually needed. &ldquo;This one is for, uh&hellip;Spider-Child. From Thor.&rdquo; Thor looked proud as Steve handed it to Peter. Y/N snorted behind her hand, but she hid it with a cough. </p><p>On and on it went, everybody waiting until everyone had their gifts. You could really tell who wrapped what since Thor&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t the best, Steve&rsquo;s had precision, and Natasha wrote little notes on hers for everyone. Even Loki had received three presents(they were from Thor, Steve, and Y/N). </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, why don&rsquo;t we go around and each open one? Bucky, you start,&rdquo; Steve said, nudging him slightly. The brunette nodded and picked up Steve&rsquo;s first, gently shaking it near his ear before he carefully peeled off the blue wrapping paper, finally getting down to a large brown box. He looked confused at first before he opened the box and grinned. &ldquo;Hoodies! And they&rsquo;re all&hellip;they&rsquo;re Avenger hoodies&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Show us, Cyborg,&rdquo; Tony called. He still struggled to speak to him, but Y/N was glad to see he was still trying with Bucky, which both she and Steve really appreciated. Bucky nodded and pulled out one that was a dark green with black lettering on the front that read, 'You won&rsquo;t like me when I&rsquo;m angry&rsquo;. Bruce sighed heavily and covered his red face. Natasha laughed as she nudged him. Bucky pulled out another for them to see, this one red and blue with a black spider on the front. </p><p>&ldquo;No way! You got a Spiderman hoodie? I didn&rsquo;t even know they made those! That&rsquo;s so cool!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed, nearly jumping to his feet if it weren&rsquo;t for Y/N holding him down. Bucky looked very happy about his new clothes as he sat down, still clutching the Hulk and Spiderman hoodies to his chest. He elbowed Steve playfully and thanked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, it&rsquo;s your turn, Cap,&rdquo; Tony smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay! Uh&hellip;this one is from&hellip;Y/N!&rdquo; Steve smiled as he pulled up a lavender wrapped present. He opened it quickly and looked at the plastic wrapped package. He looked excited. &ldquo;The Harry Potter movies!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know you really liked the books when I showed you, so I figured you should see the movies, too,&rdquo; Y/N nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Awesome, thank you!&rdquo; Steve smiled, before pausing, &ldquo;How do I play them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, alright, it&rsquo;s my turn!&rdquo; Sam demanded, taking the attention to himself as he grabbed a present from Bucky. It was small and rectangular shaped. He opened it and held it up so he could read the words on the front. To everyone else, it appeared to be just a regular book. That is, until Sam revealed what it was about, &ldquo;The Mating Lives of Birds&hellip;by James Parry.&rdquo; He slowly turned to Bucky, who seemed to be trying to curb his instant laughter.</p><p>Sam squinted as he gripped the book harshly. &ldquo;I hate you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My turn!&rdquo; Thor declared, unaware of the newfound tension between the two frenemies. He lifted a gold wrapped gift. &ldquo;From Stark!&rdquo; He opened it quickly and gasped at what appeared inside. &ldquo;It says Trojan on the front! That must mean it is mighty!&rdquo; It was a tiny box. Clint suddenly jumped and blocked his daughter&rsquo;s eyes, his wife doing the same for their baby. Loki looked confused as he grabbed the small box and read it aloud, &ldquo;Trojan condoms&hellip;it is protection for&hellip;why would you gift him this, Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thought he was with that Valkyrie chick or whatever,&rdquo; Tony shrugged. &ldquo;Thought he might wanna use 'em.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She needs no protection. She is very strong. But thank you,&rdquo; Thor smiled, taking his 'gift&rsquo; back and setting them down. </p><p>Loki rolled his eyes and went next, opening the gift Y/N had gotten him. &ldquo;Hm&hellip;they are Harry Potter books? Aren&rsquo;t these what you had given Steve?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. He already read the books. He got the movies. Thought you would wanna read 'em next.&rdquo; Y/N shrugged.</p><p>Loki nodded slowly as he glared down at them. Finally, he grunted a gruff, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled and went next. &ldquo;Okay! So this one is from&hellip;Mr. Stark!&rdquo; His eyes suddenly gained a spark in them as he ripped open his gift and looked at what it was. &ldquo;No way! No way! No way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? What is it?&rdquo; Y/N asked in eagerness to see what her father had gotten him. He wouldn&rsquo;t even let her see it. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the LEGO Star Wars: Betrayal at Cloud City set! It&rsquo;s 350 dollars! I&rsquo;ve been saving up so me and Ned could&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off with a red face as he realized everyone was watching him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;I really like it. Thank you&hellip;Mr. Stark.&rdquo; Tony chortled and patted him across the back gingerly.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, kid. Y/N, it&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded and looked over her gifts, deciding which one she should open. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open Peter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened as he looked away from his LEGO set to her, waving his arm frantically. &ldquo;Wait, wait, wait! You could wait to open that one, really! I can&rsquo;t&hellip;you shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; His blush deepened as she opened the small gift and popped open the box, her own eyes widened as she looked at what was inside. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;my name&hellip;.on a necklace.&rdquo; Y/N said, pulling out the silver jewelry and holding it for everyone to see. &ldquo;Oh, wow&hellip;Peter, it&rsquo;s&hellip;it&rsquo;s beautiful. Thank you.&rdquo; She smiled and pulled him close to press a kiss to his cheek. Tony looked pointedly away, but he didn&rsquo;t stop them. </p><p>From there on, several more gifts were opened and everyone enjoyed them all. Although, Sam was still put out from Bucky&rsquo;s gift. He got his revenge, though, when Bucky opened the gift from him and just found a box full of refrigerator magnets for his arm. Nevertheless, everyone got what they wanted and they were all so happy. Tony had gotten Y/N a necklace, too, though this one was a locket. On the inside had two pictures on either side of the heart charm. One was of Tony grinning cockily and the other with Pepper giving a gentle smile. Y/N loved it. Upon the end of the gift opening, she was wearing both of her new necklaces, Bucky was wearing a Captain America hoodie, Sam was thumbing through his new book, Thor had finally realized what Tony&rsquo;s present was, and Loki had already propped open the first book and began reading, already enthralled with J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s work. </p><p>On the way back to other activities, Sam and Bucky had been caught under the mistletoe AGAIN, throwing Peter out of the running and skyrocketing Y/N to the winning circle since the two of them marched over to Steve after their next kiss in order to drag him around with them in case. </p><p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll be getting that blaster after all!&rdquo; Shuri laughed. &ldquo;Thankfully, I had already built it. I was gonna give it to you on your birthday, but this works, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it definitely works for me,&rdquo; Y/N giggled, thumbing at the necklace Peter had given her. Overall, this was a fantastic Christmas&hellip;</p>",

Sam had downed four glasses of \u2018Adult Eggnog\u2019 to try to get the taste out of his mouth since he had been forced to kiss Bucky three times from the stupid mistletoe. </p><p>\u201cI say just two more before Bucky decides he\u2019ll start bringing Steve around with him everywhere so Steve can kiss Sam instead,\u201d Y/N guessed, pointing to the blond who was watching blank faced as Thor danced aggressively to the Christmas music playing from the radio. </p><p>\u201cWinner gets what?\u201d Shuri asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. If I win, you have to build me a blaster like I\u2019ve been begging you to,\u201d Y/N demanded.</p><p>\u201cOoh, ooh! If I win, we have to have a sleepover at Wakanda!\u201d Peter jumped up and down.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I win, you sign the Stark tower to my brother and we get to evict you,\u201d Shuri demanded, suddenly serious.</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Only joking! You should\u2019ve seen your face!\u201d Shuri snickered before throwing a friendly arm over her shoulders as well as Peter\u2019s. \u201cNah, if I win, you guys have to watch a show of my choice with me until the series ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Y/N and Peter agreed. </p><p>\u201cOkay, everyone!\u201d Steve suddenly called, looking appalled at Thor\u2019s dancing. He figured this would be a way to get it to finally stop. \u201cPresents!\u201d </p><p>As the three walked over, they could see Bucky and Sam also making their way over, unfortunately falling back to the mistletoe again and letting out distressed cries. Everyone else laughed as the two cursed loudly before pecking each other on the lips. Finally, they marched towards the tree to meet their third friend who was doubled over in laughter. </p><p>\u201cIf they do it one more time, Parker, you\u2019re out,\u201d Shuri reminded, prodding him on the forehead playfully before she went to meet her brother at the tree who was laughing with Y/N\u2019s father about something. Finally, everyone arrived, sitting criss-cross with their families so it\u2019d be easier to pass the presents around. </p><p>Thor and Loki sat beside each other, Thor looking very excited and Loki very bored. Clint sat with his family, his wife leaning against him with a soft smile. Natasha and Bruce ended up sitting beside each other, discreetly hiding their interlocked hands. T'Challa, of course, sat with Shuri nearest the tree. Steve sat in the middle of Sam and Bucky, both of which looked very annoyed. Stephen was going to sit by himself, but Wanda and Vision insisted he sit with them. And last, there was the Stark family, Tony kissing his daughter\u2019s forehead before he sat beside her with Pepper on the other, also giving her step-daughter a kiss on the forehead. Peter, blushing, went to join them as he got Y/N\u2019s other side, smiling crookedly at her. </p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get started,\u201d Steve smiled, clapping his hands together as he grabbed the first gift. It looked as if it were wrapped by a toddler, since it crinkled around all the edges and there was far too much tape than was actually needed. \u201cThis one is for, uh\u2026Spider-Child. From Thor.\u201d Thor looked proud as Steve handed it to Peter. Y/N snorted behind her hand, but she hid it with a cough. </p><p>On and on it went, everybody waiting until everyone had their gifts. You could really tell who wrapped what since Thor\u2019s weren\u2019t the best, Steve\u2019s had precision, and Natasha wrote little notes on hers for everyone. Even Loki had received three presents(they were from Thor, Steve, and Y/N). </p><p>\u201cOkay, why don\u2019t we go around and each open one? Bucky, you start,\u201d Steve said, nudging him slightly. The brunette nodded and picked up Steve\u2019s first, gently shaking it near his ear before he carefully peeled off the blue wrapping paper, finally getting down to a large brown box. He looked confused at first before he opened the box and grinned. \u201cHoodies! And they\u2019re all\u2026they\u2019re Avenger hoodies\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow us, Cyborg,\u201d Tony called. He still struggled to speak to him, but Y/N was glad to see he was still trying with Bucky, which both she and Steve really appreciated. Bucky nodded and pulled out one that was a dark green with black lettering on the front that read, 'You won\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry\u2019. Bruce sighed heavily and covered his red face. Natasha laughed as she nudged him. Bucky pulled out another for them to see, this one red and blue with a black spider on the front. </p><p>\u201cNo way! You got a Spiderman hoodie? I didn\u2019t even know they made those! That\u2019s so cool!\u201d Peter exclaimed, nearly jumping to his feet if it weren\u2019t for Y/N holding him down. Bucky looked very happy about his new clothes as he sat down, still clutching the Hulk and Spiderman hoodies to his chest. He elbowed Steve playfully and thanked him.</p><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s your turn, Cap,\u201d Tony smiled. </p><p>\u201cOh, okay! Uh\u2026this one is from\u2026Y/N!\u201d Steve smiled as he pulled up a lavender wrapped present. He opened it quickly and looked at the plastic wrapped package. He looked excited. \u201cThe Harry Potter movies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you really liked the books when I showed you, so I figured you should see the movies, too,\u201d Y/N nodded.</p><p>\u201cAwesome, thank you!\u201d Steve smiled, before pausing, \u201cHow do I play them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, it\u2019s my turn!\u201d Sam demanded, taking the attention to himself as he grabbed a present from Bucky. It was small and rectangular shaped. He opened it and held it up so he could read the words on the front. To everyone else, it appeared to be just a regular book. That is, until Sam revealed what it was about, \u201cThe Mating Lives of Birds\u2026by James Parry.\u201d He slowly turned to Bucky, who seemed to be trying to curb his instant laughter.</p><p>Sam squinted as he gripped the book harshly. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Thor declared, unaware of the newfound tension between the two frenemies. He lifted a gold wrapped gift. \u201cFrom Stark!\u201d He opened it quickly and gasped at what appeared inside. \u201cIt says Trojan on the front! That must mean it is mighty!\u201d It was a tiny box. Clint suddenly jumped and blocked his daughter\u2019s eyes, his wife doing the same for their baby. Loki looked confused as he grabbed the small box and read it aloud, \u201cTrojan condoms\u2026it is protection for\u2026why would you gift him this, Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought he was with that Valkyrie chick or whatever,\u201d Tony shrugged. \u201cThought he might wanna use 'em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs no protection. She is very strong. But thank you,\u201d Thor smiled, taking his 'gift\u2019 back and setting them down. </p><p>Loki rolled his eyes and went next, opening the gift Y/N had gotten him. \u201cHm\u2026they are Harry Potter books? Aren\u2019t these what you had given Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. He already read the books. He got the movies. Thought you would wanna read 'em next.\u201d Y/N shrugged.</p><p>Loki nodded slowly as he glared down at them. Finally, he grunted a gruff, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled and went next. \u201cOkay! So this one is from\u2026Mr. Stark!\u201d His eyes suddenly gained a spark in them as he ripped open his gift and looked at what it was. \u201cNo way! No way! No way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d Y/N asked in eagerness to see what her father had gotten him. He wouldn\u2019t even let her see it. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the LEGO Star Wars: Betrayal at Cloud City set! It\u2019s 350 dollars! I\u2019ve been saving up so me and Ned could\u2026\u201d he trailed off with a red face as he realized everyone was watching him. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026I really like it. Thank you\u2026Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony chortled and patted him across the back gingerly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, kid. Y/N, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded and looked over her gifts, deciding which one she should open. \u201cI\u2019ll open Peter\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened as he looked away from his LEGO set to her, waving his arm frantically. \u201cWait, wait, wait! You could wait to open that one, really! I can\u2019t\u2026you shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d His blush deepened as she opened the small gift and popped open the box, her own eyes widened as she looked at what was inside. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026my name\u2026.on a necklace.\u201d Y/N said, pulling out the silver jewelry and holding it for everyone to see. \u201cOh, wow\u2026Peter, it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s beautiful. Thank you.\u201d She smiled and pulled him close to press a kiss to his cheek. Tony looked pointedly away, but he didn\u2019t stop them. </p><p>From there on, several more gifts were opened and everyone enjoyed them all. Although, Sam was still put out from Bucky\u2019s gift. He got his revenge, though, when Bucky opened the gift from him and just found a box full of refrigerator magnets for his arm. Nevertheless, everyone got what they wanted and they were all so happy. Tony had gotten Y/N a necklace, too, though this one was a locket. On the inside had two pictures on either side of the heart charm. One was of Tony grinning cockily and the other with Pepper giving a gentle smile. Y/N loved it. Upon the end of the gift opening, she was wearing both of her new necklaces, Bucky was wearing a Captain America hoodie, Sam was thumbing through his new book, Thor had finally realized what Tony\u2019s present was, and Loki had already propped open the first book and began reading, already enthralled with J.K. Rowling\u2019s work. </p><p>On the way back to other activities, Sam and Bucky had been caught under the mistletoe AGAIN, throwing Peter out of the running and skyrocketing Y/N to the winning circle since the two of them marched over to Steve after their next kiss in order to drag him around with them in case. </p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll be getting that blaster after all!\u201d Shuri laughed. \u201cThankfully, I had already built it. I was gonna give it to you on your birthday, but this works, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it definitely works for me,\u201d Y/N giggled, thumbing at the necklace Peter had given her. Overall, this was a fantastic Christmas\u2026</p></p>",

Like when avengers are spending christmas together and give each other super funny presents. Of course everything goes wild and y/n breaks her leg and they all freak out. You can change the plot if you don\u2019t like it. (Did I mention ily?\ud83d\ude0d)</i> \u2014 <i><b>Anonymous</b></i></p><p><b>Author\u2019s Note</b>: <i>I wanted to say thank you so much for all the love! I\u2019m so happy you enjoy my imagines! It makes me so happy! I loved making this imagine, but I sadly couldn\u2019t work in the broken leg scenario. I tried really hard for the funny presents, though! Feel free to request more!</i></p><p>Tony was normally not a holiday enjoyer, partly due to the fact he never had anyone to spend it with other than girls he managed to get into his bed. He hadn\u2019t realized how much everything had changed since then, now standing within a team of Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes while simultaneously trying his hardest to be a good father to Y/N, who had joined the picture not long after he was Iron Man. Nowadays, the tower was somehow coated in green and red lights that glimmered from the city\u2019s help, every floor in said tower having at least two Christmas trees all decorated by each of the heroes, himself, or Y/N.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tony felt Christmases were much better now, holding Pepper close as he watched his, well\u2026family enjoy each other\u2019s company. Thor finally managed to convince everybody to allow Loki to appear as well. Clint brought his entire family, every year coming adorned in ugly Christmas sweaters for tradition. Bruce and Natasha kept, somehow, finding each other underneath the mistletoe(Bucky and Sam did, too, much to their displeasure). Steve always overdid it with the presents, wanting to put so much effort into every gift for everyone. T'Challa and Shuri tried their best to make appearances, but as a monarch and an influence for Wakanda, they struggled to. (Although, they never missed a chance to upstage Tony in his extravagant gifts). Stephen always said he only came because he had nothing better to do, yet he was always the first guest to arrive. Wanda and Vision always showed up wearing cheesy, matching couple outfits. And, finally, Peter always managed to slip away once his Christmas with Aunt May and Ned were done to visit the Avengers. Overall, Tony thought it was perfect. </p><p>This Christmas, however, everyone was there. Everyone arrived with armfuls of gifts and food, while others brought some old Christmas movies they thought the heroes would enjoy. Soon enough, the topmost floor was full with all the heroes and Y/N alike, conversations booming across everyone. </p><p>Y/N was, as always, speaking quietly with a blushing Peter and amused Shuri as she waved her arms exaggeratingly, her right hand clasped around a cup of eggnog. She was having such a good time as she laughed with them.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s set a wager, then, Stark girl,\u201d Shuri grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll bet the White Wolf and Falcon will be caught underneath the mistletoe at least four more times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll just be one more time,\u201d Peter disagreed, eyeing the two in bemusement. Bucky was sitting, pouting more like, with his arms crossed on the sofa while Loki sat beside him, relishing in the man\u2019s grumpiness as he offered him a Christmas cookie.

Uh\u2026this one is from\u2026Y/N!\u201d Steve smiled as he pulled up a lavender wrapped present. He opened it quickly and looked at the plastic wrapped package. He looked excited. \u201cThe Harry Potter movies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you really liked the books when I showed you, so I figured you should see the movies, too,\u201d Y/N nodded.</p><p>\u201cAwesome, thank you!\u201d Steve smiled, before pausing, \u201cHow do I play them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, it\u2019s my turn!\u201d Sam demanded, taking the attention to himself as he grabbed a present from Bucky.

What is it?\u201d Y/N asked in eagerness to see what her father had gotten him. He wouldn\u2019t even let her see it. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the LEGO Star Wars: Betrayal at Cloud City set! It\u2019s 350 dollars! I\u2019ve been saving up so me and Ned could\u2026\u201d he trailed off with a red face as he realized everyone was watching him. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026I really like it. Thank you\u2026Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony chortled and patted him across the back gingerly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, kid. Y/N, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded and looked over her gifts, deciding which one she should open. \u201cI\u2019ll open Peter\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened as he looked away from his LEGO set to her, waving his arm frantically. \u201cWait, wait, wait! You could wait to open that one, really! I can\u2019t\u2026you shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d His blush deepened as she opened the small gift and popped open the box, her own eyes widened as she looked at what was inside. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026my name\u2026.on a necklace.\u201d Y/N said, pulling out the silver jewelry and holding it for everyone to see. \u201cOh, wow\u2026Peter, it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s beautiful. Thank you.\u201d She smiled and pulled him close to press a kiss to his cheek. Tony looked pointedly away, but he didn\u2019t stop them. </p><p>From there on, several more gifts were opened and everyone enjoyed them all. Although, Sam was still put out from Bucky\u2019s gift. He got his revenge, though, when Bucky opened the gift from him and just found a box full of refrigerator magnets for his arm. Nevertheless, everyone got what they wanted and they were all so happy. Tony had gotten Y/N a necklace, too, though this one was a locket. On the inside had two pictures on either side of the heart charm. One was of Tony grinning cockily and the other with Pepper giving a gentle smile. Y/N loved it. Upon the end of the gift opening, she was wearing both of her new necklaces, Bucky was wearing a Captain America hoodie, Sam was thumbing through his new book, Thor had finally realized what Tony\u2019s present was, and Loki had already propped open the first book and began reading, already enthralled with J.K. Rowling\u2019s work. </p><p>On the way back to other activities, Sam and Bucky had been caught under the mistletoe AGAIN, throwing Peter out of the running and skyrocketing Y/N to the winning circle since the two of them marched over to Steve after their next kiss in order to drag him around with them in case. </p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll be getting that blaster after all!\u201d Shuri laughed. \u201cThankfully, I had already built it. I was gonna give it to you on your birthday, but this works, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it definitely works for me,\u201d Y/N giggled, thumbing at the necklace Peter had given her. Overall, this was a fantastic Christmas\u2026</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Imagine spending Christmas with the Avengers</h1><p><b>Request</b>: <i>Hey there! I absolutely love your imagines&#10084;&#10084;. So can I request one? Like when avengers are spending christmas together and give each other super funny presents. Of course everything goes wild and y/n breaks her leg and they all freak out. You can change the plot if you don&rsquo;t like it. (Did I mention ily?&#128525;)</i> &mdash; <i><b>Anonymous</b></i></p><p><b>Author&rsquo;s Note</b>: <i>I wanted to say thank you so much for all the love! I&rsquo;m so happy you enjoy my imagines! It makes me so happy! I loved making this imagine, but I sadly couldn&rsquo;t work in the broken leg scenario. I tried really hard for the funny presents, though! Feel free to request more!</i></p><p>Tony was normally not a holiday enjoyer, partly due to the fact he never had anyone to spend it with other than girls he managed to get into his bed. He hadn&rsquo;t realized how much everything had changed since then, now standing within a team of Earth&rsquo;s mightiest heroes while simultaneously trying his hardest to be a good father to Y/N, who had joined the picture not long after he was Iron Man. Nowadays, the tower was somehow coated in green and red lights that glimmered from the city&rsquo;s help, every floor in said tower having at least two Christmas trees all decorated by each of the heroes, himself, or Y/N.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tony felt Christmases were much better now, holding Pepper close as he watched his, well&hellip;family enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. Thor finally managed to convince everybody to allow Loki to appear as well. Clint brought his entire family, every year coming adorned in ugly Christmas sweaters for tradition. Bruce and Natasha kept, somehow, finding each other underneath the mistletoe(Bucky and Sam did, too, much to their displeasure). Steve always overdid it with the presents, wanting to put so much effort into every gift for everyone. T'Challa and Shuri tried their best to make appearances, but as a monarch and an influence for Wakanda, they struggled to. (Although, they never missed a chance to upstage Tony in his extravagant gifts). Stephen always said he only came because he had nothing better to do, yet he was always the first guest to arrive. Wanda and Vision always showed up wearing cheesy, matching couple outfits. And, finally, Peter always managed to slip away once his Christmas with Aunt May and Ned were done to visit the Avengers. Overall, Tony thought it was perfect. </p><p>This Christmas, however, everyone was there. Everyone arrived with armfuls of gifts and food, while others brought some old Christmas movies they thought the heroes would enjoy. Soon enough, the topmost floor was full with all the heroes and Y/N alike, conversations booming across everyone. </p><p>Y/N was, as always, speaking quietly with a blushing Peter and amused Shuri as she waved her arms exaggeratingly, her right hand clasped around a cup of eggnog. She was having such a good time as she laughed with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s set a wager, then, Stark girl,&rdquo; Shuri grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet the White Wolf and Falcon will be caught underneath the mistletoe at least four more times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;ll just be one more time,&rdquo; Peter disagreed, eyeing the two in bemusement. Bucky was sitting, pouting more like, with his arms crossed on the sofa while Loki sat beside him, relishing in the man&rsquo;s grumpiness as he offered him a Christmas cookie. Sam had downed four glasses of &lsquo;Adult Eggnog&rsquo; to try to get the taste out of his mouth since he had been forced to kiss Bucky three times from the stupid mistletoe. </p><p>&ldquo;I say just two more before Bucky decides he&rsquo;ll start bringing Steve around with him everywhere so Steve can kiss Sam instead,&rdquo; Y/N guessed, pointing to the blond who was watching blank faced as Thor danced aggressively to the Christmas music playing from the radio. </p><p>&ldquo;Winner gets what?&rdquo; Shuri asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. If I win, you have to build me a blaster like I&rsquo;ve been begging you to,&rdquo; Y/N demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, ooh! If I win, we have to have a sleepover at Wakanda!&rdquo; Peter jumped up and down.</p><p>&ldquo;And if I win, you sign the Stark tower to my brother and we get to evict you,&rdquo; Shuri demanded, suddenly serious.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! Only joking! You should&rsquo;ve seen your face!&rdquo; Shuri snickered before throwing a friendly arm over her shoulders as well as Peter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Nah, if I win, you guys have to watch a show of my choice with me until the series ends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; Y/N and Peter agreed. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, everyone!&rdquo; Steve suddenly called, looking appalled at Thor&rsquo;s dancing. He figured this would be a way to get it to finally stop. &ldquo;Presents!&rdquo; </p><p>As the three walked over, they could see Bucky and Sam also making their way over, unfortunately falling back to the mistletoe again and letting out distressed cries. Everyone else laughed as the two cursed loudly before pecking each other on the lips. Finally, they marched towards the tree to meet their third friend who was doubled over in laughter. </p><p>&ldquo;If they do it one more time, Parker, you&rsquo;re out,&rdquo; Shuri reminded, prodding him on the forehead playfully before she went to meet her brother at the tree who was laughing with Y/N&rsquo;s father about something. Finally, everyone arrived, sitting criss-cross with their families so it&rsquo;d be easier to pass the presents around. </p><p>Thor and Loki sat beside each other, Thor looking very excited and Loki very bored. Clint sat with his family, his wife leaning against him with a soft smile. Natasha and Bruce ended up sitting beside each other, discreetly hiding their interlocked hands. T'Challa, of course, sat with Shuri nearest the tree. Steve sat in the middle of Sam and Bucky, both of which looked very annoyed. Stephen was going to sit by himself, but Wanda and Vision insisted he sit with them. And last, there was the Stark family, Tony kissing his daughter&rsquo;s forehead before he sat beside her with Pepper on the other, also giving her step-daughter a kiss on the forehead. Peter, blushing, went to join them as he got Y/N&rsquo;s other side, smiling crookedly at her. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s get started,&rdquo; Steve smiled, clapping his hands together as he grabbed the first gift. It looked as if it were wrapped by a toddler, since it crinkled around all the edges and there was far too much tape than was actually needed. &ldquo;This one is for, uh&hellip;Spider-Child. From Thor.&rdquo; Thor looked proud as Steve handed it to Peter. Y/N snorted behind her hand, but she hid it with a cough. </p><p>On and on it went, everybody waiting until everyone had their gifts. You could really tell who wrapped what since Thor&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t the best, Steve&rsquo;s had precision, and Natasha wrote little notes on hers for everyone. Even Loki had received three presents(they were from Thor, Steve, and Y/N). </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, why don&rsquo;t we go around and each open one? Bucky, you start,&rdquo; Steve said, nudging him slightly. The brunette nodded and picked up Steve&rsquo;s first, gently shaking it near his ear before he carefully peeled off the blue wrapping paper, finally getting down to a large brown box. He looked confused at first before he opened the box and grinned. &ldquo;Hoodies! And they&rsquo;re all&hellip;they&rsquo;re Avenger hoodies&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Show us, Cyborg,&rdquo; Tony called. He still struggled to speak to him, but Y/N was glad to see he was still trying with Bucky, which both she and Steve really appreciated. Bucky nodded and pulled out one that was a dark green with black lettering on the front that read, 'You won&rsquo;t like me when I&rsquo;m angry&rsquo;. Bruce sighed heavily and covered his red face. Natasha laughed as she nudged him. Bucky pulled out another for them to see, this one red and blue with a black spider on the front. </p><p>&ldquo;No way! You got a Spiderman hoodie? I didn&rsquo;t even know they made those! That&rsquo;s so cool!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed, nearly jumping to his feet if it weren&rsquo;t for Y/N holding him down. Bucky looked very happy about his new clothes as he sat down, still clutching the Hulk and Spiderman hoodies to his chest. He elbowed Steve playfully and thanked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, it&rsquo;s your turn, Cap,&rdquo; Tony smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay! Uh&hellip;this one is from&hellip;Y/N!&rdquo; Steve smiled as he pulled up a lavender wrapped present. He opened it quickly and looked at the plastic wrapped package. He looked excited. &ldquo;The Harry Potter movies!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know you really liked the books when I showed you, so I figured you should see the movies, too,&rdquo; Y/N nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Awesome, thank you!&rdquo; Steve smiled, before pausing, &ldquo;How do I play them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, alright, it&rsquo;s my turn!&rdquo; Sam demanded, taking the attention to himself as he grabbed a present from Bucky. It was small and rectangular shaped. He opened it and held it up so he could read the words on the front. To everyone else, it appeared to be just a regular book. That is, until Sam revealed what it was about, &ldquo;The Mating Lives of Birds&hellip;by James Parry.&rdquo; He slowly turned to Bucky, who seemed to be trying to curb his instant laughter.</p><p>Sam squinted as he gripped the book harshly. &ldquo;I hate you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My turn!&rdquo; Thor declared, unaware of the newfound tension between the two frenemies. He lifted a gold wrapped gift. &ldquo;From Stark!&rdquo; He opened it quickly and gasped at what appeared inside. &ldquo;It says Trojan on the front! That must mean it is mighty!&rdquo; It was a tiny box. Clint suddenly jumped and blocked his daughter&rsquo;s eyes, his wife doing the same for their baby. Loki looked confused as he grabbed the small box and read it aloud, &ldquo;Trojan condoms&hellip;it is protection for&hellip;why would you gift him this, Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thought he was with that Valkyrie chick or whatever,&rdquo; Tony shrugged. &ldquo;Thought he might wanna use 'em.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She needs no protection. She is very strong. But thank you,&rdquo; Thor smiled, taking his 'gift&rsquo; back and setting them down. </p><p>Loki rolled his eyes and went next, opening the gift Y/N had gotten him. &ldquo;Hm&hellip;they are Harry Potter books? Aren&rsquo;t these what you had given Steve?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. He already read the books. He got the movies. Thought you would wanna read 'em next.&rdquo; Y/N shrugged.</p><p>Loki nodded slowly as he glared down at them. Finally, he grunted a gruff, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled and went next. &ldquo;Okay! So this one is from&hellip;Mr. Stark!&rdquo; His eyes suddenly gained a spark in them as he ripped open his gift and looked at what it was. &ldquo;No way! No way! No way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?

You could wait to open that one, really! I can&rsquo;t&hellip;you shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; His blush deepened as she opened the small gift and popped open the box, her own eyes widened as she looked at what was inside. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;my name&hellip;.on a necklace.&rdquo; Y/N said, pulling out the silver jewelry and holding it for everyone to see. &ldquo;Oh, wow&hellip;Peter, it&rsquo;s&hellip;it&rsquo;s beautiful.
