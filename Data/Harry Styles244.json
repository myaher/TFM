Nothing ever really did when you worked yourself up this much. You couldn&rsquo;t even figure out why you were so anxious, it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a problem, but here you were, muscles tense, weight on your chest, struggling to breathe and tears stinging at the edge of your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to get you a water?&rdquo; Harry asked softly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; You moaned, trying to concentrate on his touch instead of the weight pressing down on you.<br /></p><p>Harry snuggled in closer, trying his best to wrap himself around you.&nbsp;&ldquo;If it helps, I love you. H-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you interrupted him, the weight quickly lifting from your chest, your breathe steadying.</p><p>The tears were still brimming in your eyes but it was for a different reason now. Harry had never said that to you before. Your eyes moved down to look at him, heart beating a little erratically as he watched you softly, his hand coming up to wipe at your tears.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you YN, and I hate seeing you like this, hurts me to.&rdquo;</p><p>You chuckled a little. All the anxiety had left your body at those words. You didn&rsquo;t imagine him saying that to you for the first time like that but it happened and it felt perfect. In that moment it was exactly what you needed to hear to snap you from your toxic thoughts and back to him. He was a perfect and loving source in your life and sometimes through the haze you couldn&rsquo;t see that but he tried his best to keep you concentrated on him and all the good that was in your life.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Harry.&rdquo; turning you rolled down onto his chest, cupping his face in your hands and pressing your lips hard against his.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you and I love you so much.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Oh gorgeous I&rsquo;m so sorry that has happened. I care about you and I&rsquo;m sure your family does as well and if not, it&rsquo;s their lose and they&rsquo;re assholes. I&rsquo;m going to write something a bit closer to anxiety then depression even though anxiety comes from depression, well that&rsquo;s what my doctor said. This is just because I think this is an insanely sensitive and triggering topic so I don&rsquo;t want to offend anyone or you by bringing up stuff that is best left in the past or by writing it wrong. So this is mostly of me having an anxiety attack the other night and a little thing Harry could have done to help it.</p>\n<p>Also may I add this guy jumped a rope and by passed his security to hug a girl who was crying and shaking and hugged and asked her if she was okay until she was, so he would definitely be very very caring and sensitive to it he would know the second you were feeling down and he&rsquo;d just cuddle you up in his arms and press kisses to your cheek and all over your face asking what was wrong and if he could help with anything and if you didn&rsquo;t want to talk he would just shrug his shoulders and be like that&rsquo;s okay I&rsquo;ll be here when you&rsquo;re ready and just keep holding you until you felt better, his hand gently stroking through your hair and maybe he&rsquo;d start to hum a song and you can feel the vibrations of it through his chest. He would definitely care love.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n</p>",
