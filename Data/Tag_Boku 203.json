He really shouldn\u2019t be rushing Kurogiri and he knew it, considering the warp villain was kind enough to put them all up and deal with their shitty attitudes with no complaints. \u201cNope,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Toga complained immediately, though she didn\u2019t push her food away like she had the first time he\u2019d made food and it had been found out that he used his quirk rather than a stove to make it. </p><p>\u201cYeah, come on, finish eating, we have stuff to do!\u201d Dabi snapped back, giving the blond a dark look. </p><p>Kurogiri moved behind the bar as this exchange was happening, setting to mixing drinks - Dabi knew that most of them were just so the other villain wouldn\u2019t kill them before they completed their planning and finished the job. </p><p>Still, the next question caught him off guard. \u201cDid you sleep at all? You\u2019re rather animated this morning, Dabi,\u201d</p><p>Dabi blinked, staring at the figure behind the bar before he stretched across again and rested his chin on his arms. \u201cNope. I\u2019ll sleep either when I\u2019m dead or we have this done, whichever happens last.\u201d</p><p>This got a disappointed sound and a weird look from the rest of the villains, but that was fine. No big deal, he wouldn\u2019t be dealing with this much longer either way this went. </p><hr><p><b></b></p><p>It was weird, Dabi had decided one night while he was half asleep, having Shoto know who he was, that he was still <i>alive</i>, but not having contacted their other siblings since leaving. </p><p>Sure, he\u2019d visited their mom, he\u2019d even sent out those letters he\u2019d been hoarding for years despite not knowing if they\u2019d ever reach their recipients. Either way was fine by him, honestly. </p><p>Still, that didn\u2019t feel like enough. </p><p>And really, he\u2019d forever blame the fact that he hadn\u2019t slept well at all since running into Shoto at the grocery shop a while back on the fact that he\u2019d dialed Fuyumi\u2019s number as he stared blankly at the ceiling one night. He hadn\u2019t even expected an answer, so he\u2019d nearly dropped the device when he got one. </p><p>He didn\u2019t hear what she said, fumbling with the device and sitting upright suddenly, eyes wide as he brought his phone back up to his ear just in time to hear Fuyumi ask if he was still there. </p><p>\u201c&hellip;yeah.\u201d Oh god, his voice sounded like he\u2019d been smoking - he hadn\u2019t, but his heart felt like it was in his throat, he couldn\u2019t exactly <i>help</i> how it sounded. </p><p><i>\u201cOkay, making sure. I\u2019m so glad to hear from you! Are you okay? Have you contacted anyone else?\u201d</i></p><p>Dabi went to respond, then just let out a disoriented sound and plopped back down on the futon. What was he supposed to tell her? <i>Yeah, I\u2019m fine, villainy is treating me just fine. I didn\u2019t mean to call, though? </i>He wasn\u2019t sure that would go over well with his younger sister. </p><p>His name brought him back from his thoughts, and he blinked to reorient himself again. \u201cSorry, Fuyu. I\u2019m fine, I\u2019ve talked to Shoto and Mom. You and Natsuo have some letters coming in the mail. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d</p><p>He hung up before she could respond, not entirely sure he could handle more of a conversation than that. He didn\u2019t want to answer questions. </p><hr><p><b></b></p><p>As soon as Shoto was back at U.A. and Dabi had made himself comfortable inside again, he let out a tired groan.</p><p>Fighting Shoto took a lot out of him, especially since he really didn\u2019t even want to be fighting the kid. </p><p>He understood they weren\u2019t on the same side, but really, he had better things to do than play spy and hurt a bunch of kids who were just trying to fucking survive at this point. </p><p>Even if he acted otherwise. </p><p>Still, now that it was just him, he went about checking out his own injuries, changing a few of the staples that had been bent when he hit the tree - and god damn it, he was glad he\u2019d waited because it hurt like a bitch and even clenched teeth couldn\u2019t keep the whimper silent. </p><p>He didn\u2019t ever want Shoto to know about the aftermath. He never wanted to leave his baby brother with any regrets. </p><p>Besides, the pain wasn\u2019t so unusual - he\u2019d been living in a state of constant pain long enough to be able to handle a bit more for the sake of his brother. </p><p>Though, he really did hope that he didn\u2019t want another fight any time soon. He\u2019d risked enough this time, using his Quirk like he had without giving himself enough of a cool down period on it until the fight had ended. </p><p>Shoto was strong, and while he was proud of that, he really fucking hated it because it caused his life to be difficult and it meant their father really was a piece of shit. </p><p>It\u2019d be fine. He\u2019d spend the next couple days curled up healing, only moving for food and other basic necessities, and that\u2019d be that. No big deal.</p>",

I&rsquo;ll sleep either when I&rsquo;m dead or we have this done, whichever happens last.&rdquo;</p><p>This got a disappointed sound and a weird look from the rest of the villains, but that was fine. No big deal, he wouldn&rsquo;t be dealing with this much longer either way this went. </p><hr /><p><b></b></p><p>It was weird, Dabi had decided one night while he was half asleep, having Shoto know who he was, that he was still <i>alive</i>, but not having contacted their other siblings since leaving. </p><p>Sure, he&rsquo;d visited their mom, he&rsquo;d even sent out those letters he&rsquo;d been hoarding for years despite not knowing if they&rsquo;d ever reach their recipients. Either way was fine by him, honestly. </p><p>Still, that didn&rsquo;t feel like enough. </p><p>And really, he&rsquo;d forever blame the fact that he hadn&rsquo;t slept well at all since running into Shoto at the grocery shop a while back on the fact that he&rsquo;d dialed Fuyumi&rsquo;s number as he stared blankly at the ceiling one night. He hadn&rsquo;t even expected an answer, so he&rsquo;d nearly dropped the device when he got one. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t hear what she said, fumbling with the device and sitting upright suddenly, eyes wide as he brought his phone back up to his ear just in time to hear Fuyumi ask if he was still there. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;yeah.&rdquo; Oh god, his voice sounded like he&rsquo;d been smoking - he hadn&rsquo;t, but his heart felt like it was in his throat, he couldn&rsquo;t exactly <i>help</i> how it sounded. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay, making sure. I&rsquo;m so glad to hear from you! Are you okay? Have you contacted anyone else?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Dabi went to respond, then just let out a disoriented sound and plopped back down on the futon. What was he supposed to tell her? <i>Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine, villainy is treating me just fine. I didn&rsquo;t mean to call, though? </i>He wasn&rsquo;t sure that would go over well with his younger sister. </p><p>His name brought him back from his thoughts, and he blinked to reorient himself again. &ldquo;Sorry, Fuyu. I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;ve talked to Shoto and Mom. You and Natsuo have some letters coming in the mail. I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;</p><p>He hung up before she could respond, not entirely sure he could handle more of a conversation than that. He didn&rsquo;t want to answer questions. </p><hr /><p><b></b></p><p>As soon as Shoto was back at U.A. and Dabi had made himself comfortable inside again, he let out a tired groan.</p><p>Fighting Shoto took a lot out of him, especially since he really didn&rsquo;t even want to be fighting the kid. </p><p>He understood they weren&rsquo;t on the same side, but really, he had better things to do than play spy and hurt a bunch of kids who were just trying to fucking survive at this point. </p><p>Even if he acted otherwise. </p><p>Still, now that it was just him, he went about checking out his own injuries, changing a few of the staples that had been bent when he hit the tree - and god damn it, he was glad he&rsquo;d waited because it hurt like a bitch and even clenched teeth couldn&rsquo;t keep the whimper silent. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t ever want Shoto to know about the aftermath. He never wanted to leave his baby brother with any regrets. </p><p>Besides, the pain wasn&rsquo;t so unusual - he&rsquo;d been living in a state of constant pain long enough to be able to handle a bit more for the sake of his brother. </p><p>Though, he really did hope that he didn&rsquo;t want another fight any time soon. He&rsquo;d risked enough this time, using his Quirk like he had without giving himself enough of a cool down period on it until the fight had ended. </p><p>Shoto was strong, and while he was proud of that, he really fucking hated it because it caused his life to be difficult and it meant their father really was a piece of shit. </p><p>It&rsquo;d be fine. He&rsquo;d spend the next couple days curled up healing, only moving for food and other basic necessities, and that&rsquo;d be that. No big deal.</p>",
