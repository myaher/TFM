That she is only capable of being a cold-blooded assassin.  That she has no interest in marriage.</p><p>To all of this, I say bullshit. Arya is human. She can feel love like any other human being. Yes, she has been severely traumatized. I concede that a romantic relationship will not be easy and something she will struggle with. I also say that Gendry will as well after going through what happened with Melisandre. I hope that we will see this struggle between them both. I want them to open up to each other and talk about their trauma and find comfort and healing from each other.</p><p> Yes, Arya is a killer and was trained as an assassin. She has done terrible things. Things I myself would never condone but I can understand her reasons. However, if all she was is just a killer then why the hell would she have gone home? She is so much more and we can now see what she wants is her family. Who did she once offer to be family with? Oh yeah, that was Gendry.</p><p>When most people bring up the fact of Arya not wanting to be married they reference the &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not me&rdquo; scene between her and her father in season 1. She was asking her father if she could ever be able to fulfill roles that had been designated to only men so far in her current time. He says no you will be married, have kids and take care of your home. She replies no that&rsquo;s not me. From what I observed it wasn&rsquo;t marriage that was the problem or having kids. It was being forced into the traditionally submissive role of high born women during that time. She would, in my opinion, want an equal relationship with her partner. They would rule and share responsibilities and raising children together. They would also not object to her pursuing interests that didn&rsquo;t conform to expectations of her gender. Gendy has teased her about not being ladylike but in a fond manner. Hell, it seems to make him smile and endear her to him. He likes that she isn&rsquo;t like most girls. Also, I never see him once say hey you are a girl and you shouldn&rsquo;t be handling weapons or fighting. The most negative reaction I have seen Gendry have to Arya being a girl and a Lady at that is due to him not being respectful in using proper titles. Gendry is the only man besides Jon to not have any problems or expectations so far for Arya to behave and submit to being a typical Lady.  </p><p>They are both adults now who have shared a past. A past of which consisted of them both depending on one another to survive. They have positive feelings for each other. Did it hurt Arya that he wanted to stay with the brotherhood? yes, it did but that never stopped her from fighting for him. She begged the brotherhood not to sell him and even confronted Melisandre about hurting him. Not to mention she added the names of those responsible for Gendry having to leave to her kill list. They have a foundation to build upon for a relationship. Not to mention that this would actually be one of if not the healthiest pairings in the show. So yes 100% I support this ship.</p>",

        "body": "<p><i>Gendrya\u00a0Drabble. First time\u00a0writing, so this is gonna be trash, but I have a lot of feelings about Gendrya and need to get them off my\u00a0chest!!</i></p><p><i>Melisandre comes to Winterfell.\u00a0San POV because I love her, and I like seeing Gendrya from a\u00a0third\u00a0perspective.</i></p><!-- more --><p>Jon had called them to a meeting to discuss\u00a0\u201csomething important\u201d. When Sansa entered the room, the Dragon Queen was sitting in the center of the long table - alone.\u00a0</p><p>Logically, it made sense. Jon named her Queen, but Sansa couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy at the sight. Just weeks prior, she had sat in that very seat with Bran to her right as she sentenced Littlefinger to death. She sat there when she addressed Winterfell, and when Jon had introduced Danerys Targaryen to the less than thrilled Lords and Ladies of the North. Sansa worked hard to sit in that seat, suffered even more, and to see the white-haired beauty sitting in it felt like a slight on her.\u00a0</p><p>Jon stood next to the Queen like a knight, and Sansa took her place next to Arya and Bran behind them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you for meeting me,\u201d commanded Jon like the king he should have been. People looked in rapt attention.\u00a0\u201cThank you for your patience as the Queen and her troops get settled in, and as we wait for the Lannister army to ride North to help us fight the Night King.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Adding to the weather, the room got colder at the mention of the Lannisters. Sansa made a point to look at Tyrion, who grimaced as he recalled their earlier conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhile we wait, I thought it would be proper to introduce us to the people who have come to help in their own ways, and will in effect be the leaders in the fight. God forbid I or our Queen are ever in a situation where we cannot help you, please answer to them.</p><p>\u201cFirstly, the Queen\u2019s Hand, Lord Tyrion. I had introduced him along with the Queen at their arrival. Ser Davvos and Lord Varys each know their share of wars, and we will be discussing most battle plans with the three. If anyone knows that is going to happen next, it will be them.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa will be taking over as Wardeness of the North until the threat beyond the Wall is resolved. Arya will act as our lead strategist in the endeavors ahead,\u201d\u00a0continued Jon. He looked proudly at each of his sisters as he spoke about them. Although she did not show much emotion since her return, Sansa could see her little sister straighten at her brother\u2019s words. Sometimes, Sansa missed the excitement her sister\u2019s temper caused.\u00a0\u201cHer and Brienne of Tarth will work to train the soldiers on advance combat techniques, as well as the common folk on basic battle strategies to prepare them if things should get worse.\u201d</p><p>An Unsullied boy walked into the room and motioned to the Queen something Sansa did not understand. The Queen nodded her head slowly, as to not distract anyone from Jon\u2019s words, but Sansa still noticed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFinally, the men and woman who helped me beyond the wall not to long ago- Lord Gendry will act as the head blacksmith at Winterfell, where he will be making us weapons out of dragon glass.\u201d<br/></p><p>The broad-man Jon had walked into Winterfell with not to long ago stood at the mention of his name.\u00a0\u201cForgive me, Ser, but I am not a Lord.\u201d said Gendry.</p><p>Sansa and many of the Lords in the room looked shocked that the boy had the gall to interrupt Jon in the middle of his speech- Davvos looked especially tired and went as far as to rub his forehead so aggressively Sansa thought he would crack his skull. Jon, however, only laughed at his friend. As did Arya, who was actively trying to hold back a smirk next to her sister.</p><p>Sansa had never formally introduced to the blacksmith yet, but from what she has heard and what she could tell, he was hard working and stoic. He had grown up in Fleabottom, and did not know much about high-born customs - such as not interrupting the Lord you served during a speech to other high-born lord and ladies. That was part of the reason Sansa believed Jon enjoyed his company so much.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am very sorry, Gendry,\u201d replied Jon.\u00a0\u201cI would like to point out to the room, though, that Gendry is the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, if that at all helps to explain his temper in the near future.\u201d\u00a0A murmur of laughter rippled through he room, and Sandor Clegane takes the moment to grab Gendry by the scruff of his neck and pull him back to his seat. Next to her, Area seems to stiffen.\u00a0</p><p>The Queen speaks up for the first time, smiling as she does. \u201cIf I may, after I reclaim the Iron Throne, I will be legitimizing Ser Gendry, so please treat him as such.\u201d</p><p>Arya takes in a breath, and when Sansa looks out, she sees the blacksmith pale. His eyes are locked on her sister.\u00a0</p><p>At that moment, the door opens and a quartet of Unsullied lead a woman in a red robe into the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, and if everyone could welcome the Red Preistess, Melis-\u201d before Jon could finish his sentence, a lot happened. Sansa felt a wind as Arya shot past her, towards the woman. Sandor yelled an annoyed <i>Shit!</i>\u00a0as he and Gendry both stood and ran after her sister. As they did, Arya pulled out her Valarian-steel dagger and held it to the woman\u2019s throat while the Unsullied guards held their spears at Arya. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cArya!\u201d scolded Sansa. Danerys stood in confusion as Jon moved to where they were, yelling to the Unsullied to put down their weapons.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDo you remember me, bitch?\u201d Arya whispered coldly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d replied the woman. Sandor grabbed Arya and lifted her up as Gendry struggled to rip the dagger from her tight fist.\u00a0<br/></p><p>After the dagger was successfully manhandled from her grasp and gently thrown across the floor away from her reach, Gendry made motions for Sandor to put her down. It proved difficult because Arya was kicking and screaming the entire time, yelling <i>You bitch! You fucking cunt!</i>. Gendry then tried to hold her face, being whipped around by the force of the girls anger, saying <i>Arry! I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m here! I\u2019m fine!</i>\u00a0</p><p>Sandor eventually had to pull the two a few feet away as Jon stepped in front of the red-cloaked woman, putting distance between the two parties.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI demand an explanation for this,\u201d the Dragon Queen appeared at Jon\u2019s side instantly. Sansa had to stop herself from rolling her eyes as the Queen practically grabbed Jon\u2019s arm in a wedding position as she spoke.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat <i>bitch </i>tried to kill Gendry!\u201d shouted Arya as the said blacksmith pushed her head into his chest and wrapped his other arm around her torso to calm her movements.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMelissandre is my friend, and as your Queen I command you show her the same respect-\u201d Jon grabbed Danerys\u2019s hand before she said anymore and became the new subject to Arya\u2019s fury.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The Red Woman, unfazed by the entire situation, looked at Arya as if she was studying her.\u00a0\u201cThat darkness has over taken you, girl. Those eyes I had seen before&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She motioned to grab her face, but Gendry slapped her hand out of the way.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t. Touch. Her.\u201d he growled.\u00a0</p><p>Jon lead the woman in a wide arc away from the two and to a seat nearby as the room began to settle again. Sansa watched as Gendry cradled her sister\u2019s head again, looking down at her with a look of absolute sorrow and admiration. Scenes of her parents in a similar position flashed against Sansa\u2019s vision, and she noted that she had to speak to Arya later about this.\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps her sister hadn\u2019t become\u00a0as cold as she had thought.\u00a0</p>",

The Queen nodded her head slowly, as to not distract anyone from Jon\u2019s words, but Sansa still noticed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFinally, the men and woman who helped me beyond the wall not to long ago- Lord Gendry will act as the head blacksmith at Winterfell, where he will be making us weapons out of dragon glass.\u201d<br></p><p>The broad-man Jon had walked into Winterfell with not to long ago stood at the mention of his name.\u00a0\u201cForgive me, Ser, but I am not a Lord.\u201d said Gendry.</p><p>Sansa and many of the Lords in the room looked shocked that the boy had the gall to interrupt Jon in the middle of his speech- Davvos looked especially tired and went as far as to rub his forehead so aggressively Sansa thought he would crack his skull. Jon, however, only laughed at his friend. As did Arya, who was actively trying to hold back a smirk next to her sister.</p><p>Sansa had never formally introduced to the blacksmith yet, but from what she has heard and what she could tell, he was hard working and stoic. He had grown up in Fleabottom, and did not know much about high-born customs - such as not interrupting the Lord you served during a speech to other high-born lord and ladies. That was part of the reason Sansa believed Jon enjoyed his company so much.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am very sorry, Gendry,\u201d replied Jon.\u00a0\u201cI would like to point out to the room, though, that Gendry is the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, if that at all helps to explain his temper in the near future.\u201d\u00a0A murmur of laughter rippled through he room, and Sandor Clegane takes the moment to grab Gendry by the scruff of his neck and pull him back to his seat. Next to her, Area seems to stiffen.\u00a0</p><p>The Queen speaks up for the first time, smiling as she does. \u201cIf I may, after I reclaim the Iron Throne, I will be legitimizing Ser Gendry, so please treat him as such.\u201d</p><p>Arya takes in a breath, and when Sansa looks out, she sees the blacksmith pale. His eyes are locked on her sister.\u00a0</p><p>At that moment, the door opens and a quartet of Unsullied lead a woman in a red robe into the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, and if everyone could welcome the Red Preistess, Melis-\u201d before Jon could finish his sentence, a lot happened. Sansa felt a wind as Arya shot past her, towards the woman. Sandor yelled an annoyed <i>Shit!</i>\u00a0as he and Gendry both stood and ran after her sister. As they did, Arya pulled out her Valarian-steel dagger and held it to the woman\u2019s throat while the Unsullied guards held their spears at Arya. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cArya!\u201d scolded Sansa. Danerys stood in confusion as Jon moved to where they were, yelling to the Unsullied to put down their weapons.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDo you remember me, bitch?\u201d Arya whispered coldly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d replied the woman. Sandor grabbed Arya and lifted her up as Gendry struggled to rip the dagger from her tight fist.\u00a0<br></p><p>After the dagger was successfully manhandled from her grasp and gently thrown across the floor away from her reach, Gendry made motions for Sandor to put her down. It proved difficult because Arya was kicking and screaming the entire time, yelling <i>You bitch! You fucking cunt!</i>. Gendry then tried to hold her face, being whipped around by the force of the girls anger, saying <i>Arry! I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m here! I\u2019m fine!</i>\u00a0</p><p>Sandor eventually had to pull the two a few feet away as Jon stepped in front of the red-cloaked woman, putting distance between the two parties.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI demand an explanation for this,\u201d the Dragon Queen appeared at Jon\u2019s side instantly. Sansa had to stop herself from rolling her eyes as the Queen practically grabbed Jon\u2019s arm in a wedding position as she spoke.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat <i>bitch </i>tried to kill Gendry!\u201d shouted Arya as the said blacksmith pushed her head into his chest and wrapped his other arm around her torso to calm her movements.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMelissandre is my friend, and as your Queen I command you show her the same respect-\u201d Jon grabbed Danerys\u2019s hand before she said anymore and became the new subject to Arya\u2019s fury.\u00a0<br></p><p>The Red Woman, unfazed by the entire situation, looked at Arya as if she was studying her.\u00a0\u201cThat darkness has over taken you, girl. Those eyes I had seen before\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She motioned to grab her face, but Gendry slapped her hand out of the way.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t. Touch. Her.\u201d he growled.\u00a0</p><p>Jon lead the woman in a wide arc away from the two and to a seat nearby as the room began to settle again. Sansa watched as Gendry cradled her sister\u2019s head again, looking down at her with a look of absolute sorrow and admiration. Scenes of her parents in a similar position flashed against Sansa\u2019s vision, and she noted that she had to speak to Arya later about this.\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps her sister hadn\u2019t become\u00a0as cold as she had thought.\u00a0</p>",

When Sansa entered the room, the Dragon Queen was sitting in the center of the long table - alone.\u00a0</p><p>Logically, it made sense. Jon named her Queen, but Sansa couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy at the sight. Just weeks prior, she had sat in that very seat with Bran to her right as she sentenced Littlefinger to death. She sat there when she addressed Winterfell, and when Jon had introduced Danerys Targaryen to the less than thrilled Lords and Ladies of the North. Sansa worked hard to sit in that seat, suffered even more, and to see the white-haired beauty sitting in it felt like a slight on her.\u00a0</p><p>Jon stood next to the Queen like a knight, and Sansa took her place next to Arya and Bran behind them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you for meeting me,\u201d commanded Jon like the king he should have been. People looked in rapt attention.\u00a0\u201cThank you for your patience as the Queen and her troops get settled in, and as we wait for the Lannister army to ride North to help us fight the Night King.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Adding to the weather, the room got colder at the mention of the Lannisters. Sansa made a point to look at Tyrion, who grimaced as he recalled their earlier conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhile we wait, I thought it would be proper to introduce us to the people who have come to help in their own ways, and will in effect be the leaders in the fight. God forbid I or our Queen are ever in a situation where we cannot help you, please answer to them.</p><p>\u201cFirstly, the Queen\u2019s Hand, Lord Tyrion. I had introduced him along with the Queen at their arrival. Ser Davvos and Lord Varys each know their share of wars, and we will be discussing most battle plans with the three. If anyone knows that is going to happen next, it will be them.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa will be taking over as Wardeness of the North until the threat beyond the Wall is resolved. Arya will act as our lead strategist in the endeavors ahead,\u201d\u00a0continued Jon. He looked proudly at each of his sisters as he spoke about them. Although she did not show much emotion since her return, Sansa could see her little sister straighten at her brother\u2019s words.

It doesn&rsquo;t change a thing between them and at the same time it does.)</p><p>* </p><p>It&rsquo;s the first time they are alone since the first night. Not that it&rsquo;s a surprise. Both have been busy with the growing tasks related to the upcoming war. If before the cohabitation between their allies already seemed complicated and required great diplomacy, with the arrival of Jaime Lannister at any time could lead to disaster.</p><p>Last time, she asked him a very specific question. He didn&rsquo;t answer, but isn&rsquo;t silence itself a sort of answer? A silent assent?</p><p>Her fingers shake and Sansa close them in a fist. There is something\u00a0in his eyes\u00a0when he looks at her. She used to think that she&rsquo;d see Father there, but she never found anyone else outside Jon. (Always Jon. Only Jon). There is a tension between them that cannot be explained. It&rsquo;s not unpleasant in and of itself, just different from anything she has ever felt. A quiver in the limbs as if she wanted to run away, a weight in the chest like the one after a long run, the desire to touch, to placate this&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is Ghost?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa blinks. &ldquo;Probably in the crypts or in the godswood.&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t tell him that it is rare to see him inside the castle these days. It&rsquo;s as if the presence of the new guests annoys him. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the dragons. She doesn&rsquo;t say anything, but she sees Jon nod, as if he had come to the same conclusion. <i>What do you know? What are you thinking about?</i></p><p>Jon has his hands resting on the stone mantel. He gives her his back and Sansa watches the curve of his spine, troubled.</p><p>When he turns, she looks away quickly. The weight of Jon&rsquo;s eyes is familiar. His silence is not. Therefore when he speaks, she doesn&rsquo;t know what to feel, whether relief or rather annoyance.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>She frowns. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cersei,&rdquo; he replies with a smile that is not quite a smile, not really. The mere sight causes something to contract painfully inside her. It makes her want to cry and scream. &ldquo;You were right. We should never have trusted her. You were right,&rdquo; he says again, more forcefully. &ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p><p>Nobody makes him angry like you, Arya told her a couple of days ago. You make him furious.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the same for her. Every time, Jon surprises her and most of the time not in a positive way. He confuse her, pulls the ground out from under her feet, shakes every painfully obtained certainty.</p><p>She clenches the jaw. &ldquo;Is this what you think of me? That I am so petty as to take pleasure in something like that?&rdquo;</p><p>When she meets Jon&rsquo;s eyes, she finds the same confusion and frustration reflected there. Not for the first time with him, she is overwhelmed by her own emotions. Vulnerable. Exposed.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I think because I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo; The admission seems to irritate and exhaust him at the same time. It sounds like an accusation against her. It hurts, but Sansa is used to far worse. To being distrusted, to being underestimated and mocked. This doesn&rsquo;t make it less bitter, especially if it comes from Jon. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you want. I don&rsquo;t understand what you think.&rdquo;</p><p>He wants trust, but doesn&rsquo;t know that it should be mutual?</p><p>Sansa is about to argue harshly, but Jon&rsquo;s hunched shoulders and his stance hold her back. It&rsquo;s as if he expects the conflict, as if he <i>want</i> it.</p><p>Instead she sighs. &ldquo;What I want is exactly what you want. For our family to survive. To protect our home.&rdquo; She sees how his eyes widen. &ldquo;What I think howewer&hellip; there was no other way? To secure her help,&rdquo; she clarifies. &ldquo;You just had to give up the crown.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t respond immediately and when he does it&rsquo;s with a non-response. &ldquo;It should never have been mine,&rdquo; he says finally, weary as if every word had been torn away by force.</p><p>She knows. Of course she knows. It had to be-</p><p>&ldquo;It had to be Robb&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she hears.</p><p>Sansa inhales deeply. She might cry and so she closes her eyes, breathing and counting her heartbeats. The ghosts of loved and lost people lie between them, together with the shadows projected by the fire against the walls.</p><p>She would like to console him, but there are no words to assuage the grief that runs through her veins like poison, like wildfire.</p><p>They never really talked about Robb. Only once she mentioned him, in a moment of anger, while trying to convince him to be more cautious and learn from past mistakes. And now, now it seems she has a chasm instead of a heart.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Jon says softly. He is looking at her regretful, angry with himself. There are forbidden arguments that both prefer not to touch. The empty spaces in their hearts.</p><p>Sansa shakes her head slowly. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. &ldquo;For food supplies,&rdquo; she says mildly and picks up the maps in front of her. It costs all her energy to regain control over her mind and body. &ldquo;Maybe there is a solution.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon would clearly like to add something, but in the end he gives up. He runs his hand through his hair and approaches her. Instead of occupying the chair in front of her, he stands beside her and reaches out. His body is close enough that she can feel the heat emanating, his breath against one side of her face.</p><p>&ldquo;With the stocks in our possession we can resist, but for how much? Less than a year, according to the calculations. Tyrion said that Daenerys has a fleet.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon is so close that the angry flash in his eyes doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed. It&rsquo;s only a moment before that fleeting spark is replaced by appreciation. Jon studies the route plotted on the maps and nods with approval. &ldquo;Do you already have a man in mind to send?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have two.&rdquo; She looks at him out of the corner of her eye. &ldquo;Ser Davos and Varys.&rdquo; She waits for a reaction or a comment and when both don&rsquo;t arrive, she forces herself to ask him, &ldquo;Do you approve?&rdquo;</p><p>The request seems to surprise him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need my permission. You&rsquo;re the Lady of Winterfell.&rdquo; He gently pulls the map from her hands to watch it more carefully against the light of the candle. &ldquo;For what it&rsquo;s worth, I approve.&rdquo;</p><p>It should end there. Sansa got what she wanted. Her choice wasn&rsquo;t casual. Varys, the master of whispers, who sees and knows everything. His presence in Winterfell worries her more than any dragon could ever do. There are secrets that must remain such, upon which lives depend. &ldquo;It means something to me,&rdquo; she says softly.</p><p>The bad blood and the last traces of hostility between them seem finally dispelled.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have to be so irritating?&rdquo; Jon asks, but there is no real bite in his voice. A corner of his mouth is arched in a hint of smile, a genuine one. </p><p>&ldquo;I grew up among irritating people.&rdquo; She smiles in turn, maintaining eye contact. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I&rsquo;m not <i>that</i> irritating.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckles, always without averting his eyes and then his expression radically changes. It gets intense and full of light and warmth and -</p><p>Arya enters without knocking and stops after just a few steps, looking at them with an arched eyebrow. &ldquo;Did I interrupt something?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon flinches as if burned. Sansa stiffens. She takes the map he hands her and rolls it up. &ldquo;Do you agree?&rdquo; She questions without looking at him.</p><p>Jon clears his throat. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya keeps looking at them like a hawk and her silence irritates her more than would yellings and recriminations.</p><p>When Jon leaves, Arya is still staring at her with that inquisitive look that reveals nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you looking at me like that?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya shrugs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just unusual to see you two get along so well.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Nobody makes him angry like you</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve smiled more since Jon came back,&rdquo; she adds without any connection.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point, Arya?&rdquo; She rolls her eyes. &ldquo;If you have a question, say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t going to be,&rdquo; she replies. &ldquo;It was a simple statement. Are you happy that he came back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be? He is our family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even thougt-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We had decided not to talk about it,&rdquo; she hisses, hushing her.</p><p>&ldquo;So is what we&rsquo;re going to do? Pretend not to know? That this doesn&rsquo;t change everything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing changes between us. You heard what Jon said. Titles doesn&rsquo;t matter. We need to focus on pressing issues, what needs to be done in order to survive.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya doesn&rsquo;t seem convinced yet. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t care?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What would you like me to say? Of course I care, but that&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t have to change anything. Jon remains Jon. He&rsquo;s a Stark. He&rsquo;s part of our family and we protect our family.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s not the first time they talk about this. Arya should know, understand why it&rsquo;s so important. At least until she gets rid of Varys, of the danger he represents. Her face is flushed and she frowns at the wolfish expression in Arya&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Why are you smiling? Are you making fun of me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a little.&rdquo;</p><p>Because of course Arya knows that she cares. <i>Of course</i>. Maybe Varys isn&rsquo;t the dangerous one after all.</p>",

Exposed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I think because I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d The admission seems to irritate and exhaust him at the same time. It sounds like an accusation against her. It hurts, but Sansa is used to far worse. To being distrusted, to being underestimated and mocked. This doesn\u2019t make it less bitter, especially if it comes from Jon. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want. I don\u2019t understand what you think.\u201d</p><p>He wants trust, but doesn\u2019t know that it should be mutual?</p><p>Sansa is about to argue harshly, but Jon\u2019s hunched shoulders and his stance hold her back.

To protect our home.\u201d She sees how his eyes widen. \u201cWhat I think howewer\u2026 there was no other way?

Of course she knows. It had to be-</p><p>\u201cIt had to be Robb\u2019s,\u201d she hears.</p><p>Sansa inhales deeply. She might cry and so she closes her eyes, breathing and counting her heartbeats. The ghosts of loved and lost people lie between them, together with the shadows projected by the fire against the walls.</p><p>She would like to console him, but there are no words to assuage the grief that runs through her veins like poison, like wildfire.</p><p>They never really talked about Robb. Only once she mentioned him, in a moment of anger, while trying to convince him to be more cautious and learn from past mistakes. And now, now it seems she has a chasm instead of a heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jon says softly. He is looking at her regretful, angry with himself. There are forbidden arguments that both prefer not to touch. The empty spaces in their hearts.</p><p>Sansa shakes her head slowly. It doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cFor food supplies,\u201d she says mildly and picks up the maps in front of her. It costs all her energy to regain control over her mind and body. \u201cMaybe there is a solution.\u201d</p><p>Jon would clearly like to add something, but in the end he gives up. He runs his hand through his hair and approaches her. Instead of occupying the chair in front of her, he stands beside her and reaches out. His body is close enough that she can feel the heat emanating, his breath against one side of her face.</p><p>\u201cWith the stocks in our possession we can resist, but for how much? Less than a year, according to the calculations. Tyrion said that Daenerys has a fleet.\u201d</p><p>Jon is so close that the angry flash in his eyes doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. It\u2019s only a moment before that fleeting spark is replaced by appreciation. Jon studies the route plotted on the maps and nods with approval. \u201cDo you already have a man in mind to send?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have two.\u201d She looks at him out of the corner of her eye. \u201cSer Davos and Varys.\u201d She waits for a reaction or a comment and when both don\u2019t arrive, she forces herself to ask him, \u201cDo you approve?\u201d</p><p>The request seems to surprise him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need my permission. You\u2019re the Lady of Winterfell.\u201d He gently pulls the map from her hands to watch it more carefully against the light of the candle. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I approve.\u201d</p><p>It should end there. Sansa got what she wanted. Her choice wasn\u2019t casual. Varys, the master of whispers, who sees and knows everything. His presence in Winterfell worries her more than any dragon could ever do. There are secrets that must remain such, upon which lives depend. \u201cIt means something to me,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>The bad blood and the last traces of hostility between them seem finally dispelled.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so irritating?\u201d Jon asks, but there is no real bite in his voice. A corner of his mouth is arched in a hint of smile, a genuine one. </p><p>\u201cI grew up among irritating people.\u201d She smiles in turn, maintaining eye contact. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m not <i>that</i> irritating.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, always without averting his eyes and then his expression radically changes. It gets intense and full of light and warmth and -</p><p>Arya enters without knocking and stops after just a few steps, looking at them with an arched eyebrow. \u201cDid I interrupt something?\u201d</p><p>Jon flinches as if burned. Sansa stiffens. She takes the map he hands her and rolls it up. \u201cDo you agree?\u201d She questions without looking at him.</p><p>Jon clears his throat. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Arya keeps looking at them like a hawk and her silence irritates her more than would yellings and recriminations.</p><p>When Jon leaves, Arya is still staring at her with that inquisitive look that reveals nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>Arya shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s just unusual to see you two get along so well.\u201d</p><p><i>Nobody makes him angry like you</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve smiled more since Jon came back,\u201d she adds without any connection.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point, Arya?\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cIf you have a question, say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt was a simple statement. Are you happy that he came back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be? He is our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven thougt-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had decided not to talk about it,\u201d she hisses, hushing her.</p><p>\u201cSo is what we\u2019re going to do? Pretend not to know? That this doesn\u2019t change everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing changes between us. You heard what Jon said. Titles doesn\u2019t matter. We need to focus on pressing issues, what needs to be done in order to survive.\u201d</p><p>Arya doesn\u2019t seem convinced yet. \u201cYou really don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to say? Of course I care, but that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t have to change anything. Jon remains Jon. He\u2019s a Stark. He\u2019s part of our family and we protect our family.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s not the first time they talk about this. Arya should know, understand why it\u2019s so important. At least until she gets rid of Varys, of the danger he represents. Her face is flushed and she frowns at the wolfish expression in Arya\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy are you smiling? Are you making fun of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little.\u201d</p><p>Because of course Arya knows that she cares. <i>Of course</i>. Maybe Varys isn\u2019t the dangerous one after all.</p>",

Of course she knows. It had to be-</p><p>&ldquo;It had to be Robb&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she hears.</p><p>Sansa inhales deeply. She might cry and so she closes her eyes, breathing and counting her heartbeats. The ghosts of loved and lost people lie between them, together with the shadows projected by the fire against the walls.</p><p>She would like to console him, but there are no words to assuage the grief that runs through her veins like poison, like wildfire.</p><p>They never really talked about Robb. Only once she mentioned him, in a moment of anger, while trying to convince him to be more cautious and learn from past mistakes. And now, now it seems she has a chasm instead of a heart.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Jon says softly. He is looking at her regretful, angry with himself. There are forbidden arguments that both prefer not to touch. The empty spaces in their hearts.</p><p>Sansa shakes her head slowly. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. &ldquo;For food supplies,&rdquo; she says mildly and picks up the maps in front of her. It costs all her energy to regain control over her mind and body. &ldquo;Maybe there is a solution.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon would clearly like to add something, but in the end he gives up. He runs his hand through his hair and approaches her. Instead of occupying the chair in front of her, he stands beside her and reaches out. His body is close enough that she can feel the heat emanating, his breath against one side of her face.</p><p>&ldquo;With the stocks in our possession we can resist, but for how much? Less than a year, according to the calculations. Tyrion said that Daenerys has a fleet.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon is so close that the angry flash in his eyes doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed. It&rsquo;s only a moment before that fleeting spark is replaced by appreciation. Jon studies the route plotted on the maps and nods with approval. &ldquo;Do you already have a man in mind to send?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have two.&rdquo; She looks at him out of the corner of her eye. &ldquo;Ser Davos and Varys.&rdquo; She waits for a reaction or a comment and when both don&rsquo;t arrive, she forces herself to ask him, &ldquo;Do you approve?&rdquo;</p><p>The request seems to surprise him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need my permission. You&rsquo;re the Lady of Winterfell.&rdquo; He gently pulls the map from her hands to watch it more carefully against the light of the candle. &ldquo;For what it&rsquo;s worth, I approve.&rdquo;</p><p>It should end there. Sansa got what she wanted. Her choice wasn&rsquo;t casual. Varys, the master of whispers, who sees and knows everything. His presence in Winterfell worries her more than any dragon could ever do. There are secrets that must remain such, upon which lives depend. &ldquo;It means something to me,&rdquo; she says softly.</p><p>The bad blood and the last traces of hostility between them seem finally dispelled.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have to be so irritating?&rdquo; Jon asks, but there is no real bite in his voice. A corner of his mouth is arched in a hint of smile, a genuine one. </p><p>&ldquo;I grew up among irritating people.&rdquo; She smiles in turn, maintaining eye contact. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I&rsquo;m not <i>that</i> irritating.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckles, always without averting his eyes and then his expression radically changes. It gets intense and full of light and warmth and -</p><p>Arya enters without knocking and stops after just a few steps, looking at them with an arched eyebrow. &ldquo;Did I interrupt something?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon flinches as if burned. Sansa stiffens. She takes the map he hands her and rolls it up. &ldquo;Do you agree?&rdquo; She questions without looking at him.</p><p>Jon clears his throat. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya keeps looking at them like a hawk and her silence irritates her more than would yellings and recriminations.</p><p>When Jon leaves, Arya is still staring at her with that inquisitive look that reveals nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you looking at me like that?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya shrugs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just unusual to see you two get along so well.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Nobody makes him angry like you</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve smiled more since Jon came back,&rdquo; she adds without any connection.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point, Arya?&rdquo; She rolls her eyes. &ldquo;If you have a question, say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t going to be,&rdquo; she replies. &ldquo;It was a simple statement. Are you happy that he came back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be? He is our family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even thougt-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We had decided not to talk about it,&rdquo; she hisses, hushing her.</p><p>&ldquo;So is what we&rsquo;re going to do? Pretend not to know? That this doesn&rsquo;t change everything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing changes between us. You heard what Jon said. Titles doesn&rsquo;t matter. We need to focus on pressing issues, what needs to be done in order to survive.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya doesn&rsquo;t seem convinced yet. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t care?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What would you like me to say? Of course I care, but that&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t have to change anything. Jon remains Jon. He&rsquo;s a Stark. He&rsquo;s part of our family and we protect our family.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s not the first time they talk about this. Arya should know, understand why it&rsquo;s so important. At least until she gets rid of Varys, of the danger he represents. Her face is flushed and she frowns at the wolfish expression in Arya&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Why are you smiling? Are you making fun of me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a little.&rdquo;</p><p>Because of course Arya knows that she cares. <i>Of course</i>. Maybe Varys isn&rsquo;t the dangerous one after all.</p>",
