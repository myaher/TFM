Clint smiles seeing Peter around the Avengers Compound.</p><p>He definitely thinks the teenager is too young to be in this madness but it wasn\u2019t like it was his choice, the kid gets bitten by a spider, and the responsibility is thrust into his hands. The archer smiles and pats the empty seat next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, buddy?\u201d\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Peter, had bit his lip before making direct eye contact,\u00a0\u201cDo you know sign language?\u201d</p><p>Clint was taken aback, sometimes the boy would come to him if he could babysit his kids or even challenge him on the game console, but this was entirely different. Clint looked at him with furrowed eyebrows and tilted head, what could this boy be up to?</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend is deaf like you, and erm, whenever we\u2019re in school or in large crowds which is like all the time since we live in New York, but erm, he can\u2019t lipread that well but he can understand sign language, he\u2019s too busy to teach me it so I figured you can teach me because you\u2019re deaf too&hellip;?\u201d</p><p>Clint\u2019s heart could melt, damn Parker when he thought that this kid couldn\u2019t get any more adorable and sweet, and then he does this. Clint turns to look at Peter with an easy smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re in luck kid, I can do sign language, learnt it a few years back, it wasn\u2019t easy but Nat did it with me,\u201d Clint had boasted, a proud smirk on his face, \u201cWhy not ask Nat too? She can teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe scares me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she?\u201d Clint laughs, despite being Nat\u2019s best friend, sometimes she was just terrifying,\u00a0\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll teach you, when are you here? You know my schedule.\u201d</p><p>Peter knows his schedule, Clint is around the compound when school is on as he can\u2019t hang out with his kids or wife, leaves the compound around five to get back home to his family. Clint hangs around later on Fridays, pushing it to eight. However, weekends are strictly family time and only call Clint if there is an emergency and so far there hasn\u2019t been. - Luckily for Clint.</p><p>Peter comes over Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and the weekends. In which Fridays and over the weekend he sleeps over. Monday and Thursday are spent with Aunt May, but since she\u2019s working more often in night shift - he feels less lonely at the compound. Tuesday and Wednesday are purely to hang around with the team, and luckily for the two of them that gives them at least eleven hours in total if they were to use the time left fully.</p><p>\u201cBut, if you want to learn quick, and let me remind you that sign language is hard, Nat will have to keep up with the lessons over the weekend,\u201d Clint advised, giving Peter a pointed look as Peter sends him a small smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Tony and Steve enter the room, noticing there was no loud music or competitive races going on about.</p><p>Clint beams at his friends and pats the spider on the knee,\u00a0\u201cKid is gonna be learning sign language from me and Nat to impress his boyfriend,\u201d He whistles as he looks at Peter before standing up to stretch,\u00a0\u201cWe start next week, buckle up dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever say buckle up ever,\u201d Peter cringes, his nose scrunched up,\u00a0\u201cDude.\u201d</p><p>The archer happily walks out of the room to find his best friend to tell her the plan. Steve and Tony share a look before looking at Peter, who was left sitting on the sofa confused and alone.</p><p>\u201cSo, boyfriend?\u201d Tony looked mischievous,\u00a0\u201cWhen will we meet said boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Steve warns, before giving Peter a smile,\u00a0\u201cI think you should invite him for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, not yet,\u201d Peter jumps up, shaking his head,\u00a0\u201cyou guys are&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d Peter spoke after Tony and Steve\u2019s suggestion,\u00a0\u201cYou guys can be a little full on and I haven\u2019t even told (Y/n) that I\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s his name?\u201d Tony teases, as Peter reddens,\u00a0\u201cCome on, Underroos, heart to heart at the lab, you can gush about your boyfriend and hope you won\u2019t get murdered by either assassin in the forthcoming weeks of you learning sign language.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"143\" data-orig-width=\"2210\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_psr1do0V7h1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"143\" data-orig-width=\"2210\"/></figure><p>Peter worked as hard as he could, and like Clint had said sign language is hard. He\u2019s been through everything the two assassins have to offer. Clint was a patience guy, he\u2019s dealt with his own kids who have tested his patience from their birth, so teaching Peter was easy enough.</p><p>Peter was eager to learn, but he got easily frustrated and would start to give up when stuff started to get mixed up. Clint was good with these interactions, he was a father after all.</p><p>\u201cAlright, bud, your fingers are too stiff, relax a little or it\u2019ll look awkward.\u201d</p><p>Clint was good at motivating Peter. Natasha on the other hand, whilst loving her spider son, she could feel Peter\u2019s frustration all too well. She was a good teacher, slightly stricter, but she got the point across. She would make sure that Peter would watch her fingers, even making him watch it time after time because finger placement was funny, hand placement, hell even facial expression was important and Natasha reminds him he looks like he is struggling 24/7.</p><p>Tuesdays when he comes from school the first thing they did after three weeks of learning was a surprise test to make sure he was practising in his spare time.</p><p>Peter was making progress, the team enjoyed watching the three of them sitting around, sometimes on the floor in the living room crossed legged as they would teach the teenager in sign language.\u00a0</p><p>Two months into the learning, Peter has 17 hours per week of learning and lessons. In total, he\u2019s had, give or take, 136 hours of learning. Five surprise tests and he wasn\u2019t going to give up.</p><p>\u201cI want to be fluent, not learn conventional phrases for him,\u201d Peter emphasised,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m willing to put the time and effort.\u201d</p><p>Nat chuckles as she scruffs up his hair,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry Parker, we all know you would which is why we like you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lucky to have you,\u201d Clint bumps his shoulders with Peter,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a real catch.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head,\u00a0\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think so, I\u2019m really lucky to have him.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"143\" data-orig-width=\"2210\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_psr2ffP40R1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"143\" data-orig-width=\"2210\"/></figure><p>Peter had become fluent in some areas, there were parts he was still tripping over but he had two great teachers that were committed to this cause as he was. He kisses your cheek as he greets you at your locker.</p><p>You smile, tilt your head and gaze at upon your boyfriend,\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s up babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much,\u201d Peter sighs, leaning his back against the locker next to you as you grab your books from your locker,\u00a0\u201cWhat do you have first? Chemistry?\u201d</p><p>You nodded, whilst your boyfriend sounded a little faded you could hear him when he was closer to you but the look on your face Peter turns to face you so you could read his lips if you were having troubles,\u00a0\u201cYup, and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysics,\u201d Peter replied as you grinned at him,\u00a0\u201cFlash is being a dick again, I can say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer, Parker, hey are you free tonight? I found this cool restaurant near the park and we should check it out.\u201d You planned as you shut your locker, spinning the coded lock as you leaned against the metal compartment.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Monday right?\u201d Peter questions, he had to make sure he had time for you,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m free every Monday, so what\u2019s this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know it\u2019s mostly desserts but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do love desserts, do they have-\u201d<br/></p><p>The bell had rung and suddenly everyone was getting louder and louder, drowning out Peter. You looked at him with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cI got to go,\u201d You kiss him on the cheek.</p><p>You had seen Peter\u2019s lips move, his voice is very distant and your brain wasn\u2019t able to process what he was saying. Knitting your eyebrows together in confusion as you slightly tilt your head to the side. Peter looked nervous at first as he lifts his hands causing you to look even more confused. Before you had seen the familiar finger movements.</p><p>You\u2019ve seen your parents, your siblings, your close family sign it out for you. It\u2019s integrated into your mind and watching Peter do it made you feel so excited. Your heart was racing as you looked at him with shining eyes.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>You were almost jumping in your spot, despite the phrase being very simple you couldn\u2019t help feel so blessed. You could tell that Peter was learning, you didn\u2019t know who or where from but you weren\u2019t complaining as Peter\u2019s signing was pretty slick.</p><p>You started to get excited when he continues to sigh, it was slow but his movements were graceful.</p><p><i>I\u2019ll see you during break, my love.</i></p><p>There was no shiner thing than your smile going to be impossible to remove from your face. You were excited to see him during break just to test his ability as you lifted your hands to sign back to him before placing one last kiss on him before moving quickly to your first lesson. Peter almost missed his first lesson, but he enters his class with his chest puffed out and pride in his heart.</p><p>Flash couldn\u2019t even dampen his mood. He has a little memory to keep and store, and to repeat in his head. Something he\u2019ll have to savour for forever. Your hands lifting up on view signing four words.</p><p><i>I love you too.</i></p>",

Clint looked at him with furrowed eyebrows and tilted head, what could this boy be up to?</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend is deaf like you, and erm, whenever we\u2019re in school or in large crowds which is like all the time since we live in New York, but erm, he can\u2019t lipread that well but he can understand sign language, he\u2019s too busy to teach me it so I figured you can teach me because you\u2019re deaf too\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Clint\u2019s heart could melt, damn Parker when he thought that this kid couldn\u2019t get any more adorable and sweet, and then he does this. Clint turns to look at Peter with an easy smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re in luck kid, I can do sign language, learnt it a few years back, it wasn\u2019t easy but Nat did it with me,\u201d Clint had boasted, a proud smirk on his face, \u201cWhy not ask Nat too? She can teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe scares me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she?\u201d Clint laughs, despite being Nat\u2019s best friend, sometimes she was just terrifying,\u00a0\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll teach you, when are you here? You know my schedule.\u201d</p><p>Peter knows his schedule, Clint is around the compound when school is on as he can\u2019t hang out with his kids or wife, leaves the compound around five to get back home to his family. Clint hangs around later on Fridays, pushing it to eight. However, weekends are strictly family time and only call Clint if there is an emergency and so far there hasn\u2019t been. - Luckily for Clint.</p><p>Peter comes over Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and the weekends. In which Fridays and over the weekend he sleeps over. Monday and Thursday are spent with Aunt May, but since she\u2019s working more often in night shift - he feels less lonely at the compound. Tuesday and Wednesday are purely to hang around with the team, and luckily for the two of them that gives them at least eleven hours in total if they were to use the time left fully.</p><p>\u201cBut, if you want to learn quick, and let me remind you that sign language is hard, Nat will have to keep up with the lessons over the weekend,\u201d Clint advised, giving Peter a pointed look as Peter sends him a small smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Tony and Steve enter the room, noticing there was no loud music or competitive races going on about.</p><p>Clint beams at his friends and pats the spider on the knee,\u00a0\u201cKid is gonna be learning sign language from me and Nat to impress his boyfriend,\u201d He whistles as he looks at Peter before standing up to stretch,\u00a0\u201cWe start next week, buckle up dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever say buckle up ever,\u201d Peter cringes, his nose scrunched up,\u00a0\u201cDude.\u201d</p><p>The archer happily walks out of the room to find his best friend to tell her the plan. Steve and Tony share a look before looking at Peter, who was left sitting on the sofa confused and alone.</p><p>\u201cSo, boyfriend?\u201d Tony looked mischievous,\u00a0\u201cWhen will we meet said boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Steve warns, before giving Peter a smile,\u00a0\u201cI think you should invite him for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, not yet,\u201d Peter jumps up, shaking his head,\u00a0\u201cyou guys are\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d Peter spoke after Tony and Steve\u2019s suggestion,\u00a0\u201cYou guys can be a little full on and I haven\u2019t even told (Y/n) that I\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s his name?\u201d Tony teases, as Peter reddens,\u00a0\u201cCome on, Underroos, heart to heart at the lab, you can gush about your boyfriend and hope you won\u2019t get murdered by either assassin in the forthcoming weeks of you learning sign language.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"143\" data-orig-width=\"2210\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_psr1do0V7h1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"143\" data-orig-width=\"2210\"></figure><p>Peter worked as hard as he could, and like Clint had said sign language is hard. He\u2019s been through everything the two assassins have to offer. Clint was a patience guy, he\u2019s dealt with his own kids who have tested his patience from their birth, so teaching Peter was easy enough.</p><p>Peter was eager to learn, but he got easily frustrated and would start to give up when stuff started to get mixed up. Clint was good with these interactions, he was a father after all.</p><p>\u201cAlright, bud, your fingers are too stiff, relax a little or it\u2019ll look awkward.\u201d</p><p>Clint was good at motivating Peter. Natasha on the other hand, whilst loving her spider son, she could feel Peter\u2019s frustration all too well. She was a good teacher, slightly stricter, but she got the point across. She would make sure that Peter would watch her fingers, even making him watch it time after time because finger placement was funny, hand placement, hell even facial expression was important and Natasha reminds him he looks like he is struggling 24/7.</p><p>Tuesdays when he comes from school the first thing they did after three weeks of learning was a surprise test to make sure he was practising in his spare time.</p><p>Peter was making progress, the team enjoyed watching the three of them sitting around, sometimes on the floor in the living room crossed legged as they would teach the teenager in sign language.\u00a0</p><p>Two months into the learning, Peter has 17 hours per week of learning and lessons. In total, he\u2019s had, give or take, 136 hours of learning. Five surprise tests and he wasn\u2019t going to give up.</p><p>\u201cI want to be fluent, not learn conventional phrases for him,\u201d Peter emphasised,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m willing to put the time and effort.\u201d</p><p>Nat chuckles as she scruffs up his hair,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry Parker, we all know you would which is why we like you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lucky to have you,\u201d Clint bumps his shoulders with Peter,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a real catch.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head,\u00a0\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think so, I\u2019m really lucky to have him.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"143\" data-orig-width=\"2210\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_psr2ffP40R1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"143\" data-orig-width=\"2210\"></figure><p>Peter had become fluent in some areas, there were parts he was still tripping over but he had two great teachers that were committed to this cause as he was.

Chemistry?\u201d</p><p>You nodded, whilst your boyfriend sounded a little faded you could hear him when he was closer to you but the look on your face Peter turns to face you so you could read his lips if you were having troubles,\u00a0\u201cYup, and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysics,\u201d Peter replied as you grinned at him,\u00a0\u201cFlash is being a dick again, I can say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer, Parker, hey are you free tonight? I found this cool restaurant near the park and we should check it out.\u201d You planned as you shut your locker, spinning the coded lock as you leaned against the metal compartment.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Monday right?\u201d Peter questions, he had to make sure he had time for you,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m free every Monday, so what\u2019s this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know it\u2019s mostly desserts but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do love desserts, do they have-\u201d<br></p><p>The bell had rung and suddenly everyone was getting louder and louder, drowning out Peter. You looked at him with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cI got to go,\u201d You kiss him on the cheek.</p><p>You had seen Peter\u2019s lips move, his voice is very distant and your brain wasn\u2019t able to process what he was saying. Knitting your eyebrows together in confusion as you slightly tilt your head to the side. Peter looked nervous at first as he lifts his hands causing you to look even more confused. Before you had seen the familiar finger movements.</p><p>You\u2019ve seen your parents, your siblings, your close family sign it out for you. It\u2019s integrated into your mind and watching Peter do it made you feel so excited. Your heart was racing as you looked at him with shining eyes.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>You were almost jumping in your spot, despite the phrase being very simple you couldn\u2019t help feel so blessed. You could tell that Peter was learning, you didn\u2019t know who or where from but you weren\u2019t complaining as Peter\u2019s signing was pretty slick.</p><p>You started to get excited when he continues to sigh, it was slow but his movements were graceful.</p><p><i>I\u2019ll see you during break, my love.</i></p><p>There was no shiner thing than your smile going to be impossible to remove from your face. You were excited to see him during break just to test his ability as you lifted your hands to sign back to him before placing one last kiss on him before moving quickly to your first lesson. Peter almost missed his first lesson, but he enters his class with his chest puffed out and pride in his heart.</p><p>Flash couldn\u2019t even dampen his mood. He has a little memory to keep and store, and to repeat in his head. Something he\u2019ll have to savour for forever. Your hands lifting up on view signing four words.</p><p><i>I love you too.</i></p>",

Clint smiles seeing Peter around the Avengers Compound.</p><p>He definitely thinks the teenager is too young to be in this madness but it wasn&rsquo;t like it was his choice, the kid gets bitten by a spider, and the responsibility is thrust into his hands. The archer smiles and pats the empty seat next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, buddy?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Peter, had bit his lip before making direct eye contact,&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you know sign language?&rdquo;</p><p>Clint was taken aback, sometimes the boy would come to him if he could babysit his kids or even challenge him on the game console, but this was entirely different. Clint looked at him with furrowed eyebrows and tilted head, what could this boy be up to?</p><p>&ldquo;My boyfriend is deaf like you, and erm, whenever we&rsquo;re in school or in large crowds which is like all the time since we live in New York, but erm, he can&rsquo;t lipread that well but he can understand sign language, he&rsquo;s too busy to teach me it so I figured you can teach me because you&rsquo;re deaf too&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>Clint&rsquo;s heart could melt, damn Parker when he thought that this kid couldn&rsquo;t get any more adorable and sweet, and then he does this. Clint turns to look at Peter with an easy smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re in luck kid, I can do sign language, learnt it a few years back, it wasn&rsquo;t easy but Nat did it with me,&rdquo; Clint had boasted, a proud smirk on his face, &ldquo;Why not ask Nat too? She can teach you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She scares me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Clint laughs, despite being Nat&rsquo;s best friend, sometimes she was just terrifying,&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll teach you, when are you here? You know my schedule.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter knows his schedule, Clint is around the compound when school is on as he can&rsquo;t hang out with his kids or wife, leaves the compound around five to get back home to his family. Clint hangs around later on Fridays, pushing it to eight. However, weekends are strictly family time and only call Clint if there is an emergency and so far there hasn&rsquo;t been. - Luckily for Clint.</p><p>Peter comes over Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and the weekends. In which Fridays and over the weekend he sleeps over. Monday and Thursday are spent with Aunt May, but since she&rsquo;s working more often in night shift - he feels less lonely at the compound. Tuesday and Wednesday are purely to hang around with the team, and luckily for the two of them that gives them at least eleven hours in total if they were to use the time left fully.</p><p>&ldquo;But, if you want to learn quick, and let me remind you that sign language is hard, Nat will have to keep up with the lessons over the weekend,&rdquo; Clint advised, giving Peter a pointed look as Peter sends him a small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; Tony and Steve enter the room, noticing there was no loud music or competitive races going on about.</p><p>Clint beams at his friends and pats the spider on the knee,&nbsp;&ldquo;Kid is gonna be learning sign language from me and Nat to impress his boyfriend,&rdquo; He whistles as he looks at Peter before standing up to stretch,&nbsp;&ldquo;We start next week, buckle up dude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never say buckle up ever,&rdquo; Peter cringes, his nose scrunched up,&nbsp;&ldquo;Dude.&rdquo;</p><p>The archer happily walks out of the room to find his best friend to tell her the plan. Steve and Tony share a look before looking at Peter, who was left sitting on the sofa confused and alone.</p><p>&ldquo;So, boyfriend?&rdquo; Tony looked mischievous,&nbsp;&ldquo;When will we meet said boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; Steve warns, before giving Peter a smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;I think you should invite him for dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, not yet,&rdquo; Peter jumps up, shaking his head,&nbsp;&ldquo;you guys are&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wonderful?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Weird,&rdquo; Peter spoke after Tony and Steve&rsquo;s suggestion,&nbsp;&ldquo;You guys can be a little full on and I haven&rsquo;t even told (Y/n) that I&rsquo;m Spider-Man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; Tony teases, as Peter reddens,&nbsp;&ldquo;Come on, Underroos, heart to heart at the lab, you can gush about your boyfriend and hope you won&rsquo;t get murdered by either assassin in the forthcoming weeks of you learning sign language.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_psr1do0V7h1sngn50_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Peter worked as hard as he could, and like Clint had said sign language is hard. He&rsquo;s been through everything the two assassins have to offer. Clint was a patience guy, he&rsquo;s dealt with his own kids who have tested his patience from their birth, so teaching Peter was easy enough.</p><p>Peter was eager to learn, but he got easily frustrated and would start to give up when stuff started to get mixed up. Clint was good with these interactions, he was a father after all.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, bud, your fingers are too stiff, relax a little or it&rsquo;ll look awkward.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint was good at motivating Peter. Natasha on the other hand, whilst loving her spider son, she could feel Peter&rsquo;s frustration all too well. She was a good teacher, slightly stricter, but she got the point across. She would make sure that Peter would watch her fingers, even making him watch it time after time because finger placement was funny, hand placement, hell even facial expression was important and Natasha reminds him he looks like he is struggling 24/7.</p><p>Tuesdays when he comes from school the first thing they did after three weeks of learning was a surprise test to make sure he was practising in his spare time.</p><p>Peter was making progress, the team enjoyed watching the three of them sitting around, sometimes on the floor in the living room crossed legged as they would teach the teenager in sign language.&nbsp;</p><p>Two months into the learning, Peter has 17 hours per week of learning and lessons. In total, he&rsquo;s had, give or take, 136 hours of learning. Five surprise tests and he wasn&rsquo;t going to give up.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to be fluent, not learn conventional phrases for him,&rdquo; Peter emphasised,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to put the time and effort.&rdquo;</p><p>Nat chuckles as she scruffs up his hair,&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Parker, we all know you would which is why we like you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lucky to have you,&rdquo; Clint bumps his shoulders with Peter,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real catch.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shakes his head,&nbsp;&ldquo;Nah, I don&rsquo;t think so, I&rsquo;m really lucky to have him.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_psr2ffP40R1sngn50_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Peter had become fluent in some areas, there were parts he was still tripping over but he had two great teachers that were committed to this cause as he was. He kisses your cheek as he greets you at your locker.</p><p>You smile, tilt your head and gaze at upon your boyfriend,&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up babe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; Peter sighs, leaning his back against the locker next to you as you grab your books from your locker,&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you have first? Chemistry?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, whilst your boyfriend sounded a little faded you could hear him when he was closer to you but the look on your face Peter turns to face you so you could read his lips if you were having troubles,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yup, and you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Physics,&rdquo; Peter replied as you grinned at him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Flash is being a dick again, I can say that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bummer, Parker, hey are you free tonight? I found this cool restaurant near the park and we should check it out.&rdquo; You planned as you shut your locker, spinning the coded lock as you leaned against the metal compartment.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s Monday right?&rdquo; Peter questions, he had to make sure he had time for you,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m free every Monday, so what&rsquo;s this place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know it&rsquo;s mostly desserts but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do love desserts, do they have-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The bell had rung and suddenly everyone was getting louder and louder, drowning out Peter. You looked at him with a soft smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I got to go,&rdquo; You kiss him on the cheek.</p><p>You had seen Peter&rsquo;s lips move, his voice is very distant and your brain wasn&rsquo;t able to process what he was saying. Knitting your eyebrows together in confusion as you slightly tilt your head to the side. Peter looked nervous at first as he lifts his hands causing you to look even more confused. Before you had seen the familiar finger movements.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve seen your parents, your siblings, your close family sign it out for you. It&rsquo;s integrated into your mind and watching Peter do it made you feel so excited. Your heart was racing as you looked at him with shining eyes.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>You were almost jumping in your spot, despite the phrase being very simple you couldn&rsquo;t help feel so blessed. You could tell that Peter was learning, you didn&rsquo;t know who or where from but you weren&rsquo;t complaining as Peter&rsquo;s signing was pretty slick.</p><p>You started to get excited when he continues to sigh, it was slow but his movements were graceful.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;ll see you during break, my love.</i></p><p>There was no shiner thing than your smile going to be impossible to remove from your face. You were excited to see him during break just to test his ability as you lifted your hands to sign back to him before placing one last kiss on him before moving quickly to your first lesson. Peter almost missed his first lesson, but he enters his class with his chest puffed out and pride in his heart.</p><p>Flash couldn&rsquo;t even dampen his mood. He has a little memory to keep and store, and to repeat in his head. Something he&rsquo;ll have to savour for forever. Your hands lifting up on view signing four words.</p><p><i>I love you too.</i></p>",

        "answer": "<p>Sorry this is short &lt;3</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>Toni Stark is a bitch. She\u2019s a bitch, that\u2019s covered in ugly scars, stretch marks, cellulite, and other ugly marks.\u00a0</p><p>She\u2019s a bitch that can\u2019t have kids anymore\u2013or at least, give birth. She can technically get pregnant.\u00a0</p><p>And Toni Stark is completely and utterly in love with Peter Parker.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s way too young for her, he\u2019s not even 21 yet. He\u2019s only 20, he\u2019s in college, he\u2019s <i>young</i>. Peter Parker is smart and strong and hot as hell. He has no scars or blemishes, he\u2019s muscular and just\u2013so handsome. He can get any girl in the entire world, any <i>virgin</i> in the entire world.\u00a0</p><p>Toni is not a virgin. She\u2019s a borderline porn star, with how many sex tapes are out there with her in them.</p><p>(Not that she knew about all of them being filmed, but she figures that having sex with many people is a pretty big sign she doesn\u2019t care if people know.)</p><p>Toni has a pussy that\u2019s stretched and used and\u2013don\u2019t get her wrong, she knows her pussy is still hot and sexy. She still has men drooling and tripping over themselves to beg for her to let them lick her pussy and leave them hanging.</p><p>But she isn\u2019t a virgin, and Peter Parker deserves someone who is young and tight and perfect and not covered in scars and ugly marks.\u00a0</p><p>So she usually turns down Peter\u2019s advances, saying he should find someone his own age. He should be with someone who can give him kids. He should be with someone who isn\u2019t a slut.</p><p>But Peter keeps trying.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cMs. Stark, I really think you think I care about your age more than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, find someone who isn\u2019t ugly and covered in scars.\u201d She huffs angrily.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath hitches, and he walks closer, kissing her on the lips softly.\u00a0</p><p>Toni gasps and pulls back.\u00a0\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>Peter pushes her against the wall. He pulls her shirt slightly.\u00a0</p><p>Toni swallows thickly.\u00a0\u201cFine, but I warned you.\u201d She closes her eyes and tears her shirt off. She hasn\u2019t been able to war a real bra in years, due to the arc reactor, so there\u2019s no need to take that off. She keeps her eyes closed, not ready to see the look of disgust in his eyes, the horror in his face. She takes in sharp breaths, trying not to cry.\u00a0</p><p>So when Peter grabs her hips, her eyes fly open in surprise.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Ms. Stark.\u201d</p><p>Toni shakes her head, looking down at the reactor in her chest.\u00a0\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m covered in scars and ugly.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowns and leans forward, kissing around the arc reactor in a circle. He feels her gasp against his lips, her chest fluttering too fast to not notice she\u2019s going to cry. He kisses down, to more scars and marks and ugly ugly parts of Toni.\u00a0</p><p>But\u2026 he isn\u2019t disgusted? Toni whimpers as he kisses her hips, falling to his knees.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re perfect, Toni. You\u2019re beautiful and sexy, and you\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>Toni shakes her head, pushing her pants and panties down.\u00a0\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Peter gasps and his eyes darken. He kisses her clit, licking a stripe up her pussy. He relishes in her surprised moan, licking inside her and moaning more.\u00a0\u201cYour pussy is so pretty Toni, and I\u2019ve seen a lot.\u201d He smiles up at her, standing again.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a clueless virgin when you finally said yes.\u201d</p><p>Toni breathes heavily.\u00a0\u201cYou-you don\u2019t think I\u2019m ugly?\u201d She asks.</p><p>The sincere shock in her voice breaks Peter\u2019s heart.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you for years, Toni.</p><p>~</p><p>Toni sobs, chest heaving.

She closed the door behind her when the soles of her feet transitioned from cool wood to icy tile and she flipped on the overhead light, washing the darkness out of the room.</p><p>Y/N caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror and she cracked a small grin at the ridiculousness of her disheveled hair and the familiarity of the dark circles beneath her eyes.

In fact, she kind of felt beautiful.</p><p>As she reached for her packet of makeup wipes, she thought of the man laying in their shared bed in their shared room of their shared apartment and, even after six years, she couldn&rsquo;t fight that giddy little smile that crept onto her face. <i>God, I love him</i>.

She remembered his laughter and the roll of Mr. Delmar&rsquo;s eyes. <i>Could you squish it down real flat? </i>Fifteen year-old Peter had asked in that squeaky voice of his and her heart had been his in an instant.</p><p>Y/N shook her head and smiled sentimentally to herself at the memory as she tossed her makeup wipe in the trash and turned off the bathroom light. She made her way back to their bedroom as quietly as she could in the dark, using whatever walls and furniture were around her to keep from tripping.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; She whispered when she&rsquo;d reached their bedside, part of her hoping that he&rsquo;d still be awake, but judging by the lack of a response and the steadiness of his breathing, he wasn&rsquo;t. She sighed quietly\u2014<i>tiredly</i>\u2014and slipped into her place beneath the comforter. It was soft and it was cozy, so she pulled it all the way up to her chin.</p><p>Y/N turned her body to face Peter&rsquo;s since he always radiated warmth and the fact that he&rsquo;d be the first thing she saw when she woke up was just a bonus. She let her eyes close when she was all settled in and total relaxation seemed to engulf her body.</p><p>It lasted for all of two seconds before Peter&rsquo;s quiet voice roused her from her almost-slumber. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he croaked softly, like a sleepy toddler after a long car ride, and her heart was a puddle of mush in her chest.</p><p>A swarm of butterflies fluttered to life in her stomach and she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself from smiling at him through the dark. &ldquo;Hey, I thought you were asleep,&rdquo; she whispered quietly and she could hear the gentle rustle of his hair against his pillowcase as he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; he explained, sleep weighing down his voice. &ldquo;I remembered I wanted to tell you that first, though,&rdquo; he hummed loopily and she could just barely see the outline of his sleep-deprived smile. &ldquo;And also to cuddle you a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>A soft laugh pushed its way out of her lips at his words and she scooted slightly closer to him. &ldquo;Well, I love you, too, Pete,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get some rest now, though, okay?&rdquo; She suggested.</p><p>He nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, okay,&rdquo; he agreed and she could feel the heat of his hand as it slid over her waist beneath the covers and pulled her body against his. Warmth and comfort rolled off of his bare torso in waves and she curled into it. &ldquo;Goodnight, Y/N/N,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Pete,&rdquo; she replied, and with tired smiles on their lips, they both drifted off.</p><p><b>\u21b4</b></p><p><b>author&rsquo;s note </b>/ so, it&rsquo;s definitely been a while. i&rsquo;m not gonna say i&rsquo;m gonna be more active because let&rsquo;s be real here, i&rsquo;m terrible at running a blog, but i&rsquo;m definitely in the process of writing a crap ton of things, as i always am, and maybe i&rsquo;ll finish some soon. thanks for bearing with me and this mediocre return imagine, but i appreciate you for reading!</p><p><b>tag list </b>/ <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moG5XgGh0AL4BMKIgSENeyw\">@umchrisevans</a> @theofriendly</p>",

She remembered the way he looked in Mr. Delmar\u2019s shop, buying them each a sandwich for the rest of their walk home, and the way his eyes crinkled as he made a joke in Spanish. She remembered his laughter and the roll of Mr. Delmar\u2019s eyes. <i>Could you squish it down real flat? </i>Fifteen year-old Peter had asked in that squeaky voice of his and her heart had been his in an instant.</p><p>Y/N shook her head and smiled sentimentally to herself at the memory as she tossed her makeup wipe in the trash and turned off the bathroom light.

She sighed quietly\u2014<i>tiredly</i>\u2014and slipped into her place beneath the comforter. It was soft and it was cozy, so she pulled it all the way up to her chin.</p><p>Y/N turned her body to face Peter\u2019s since he always radiated warmth and the fact that he\u2019d be the first thing she saw when she woke up was just a bonus.
