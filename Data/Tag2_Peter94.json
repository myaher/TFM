how could he? she was such an angel, he would do anything that she asked of him. </p><p>\u201cof course\u201d, peter whispers. y/n smiles and tells him to meet her by her window around 11pm. peter agrees excitedly to her plan and watches her walk slowly back into the hotel after ending their conversation with a light kiss. peter sighs happily as he tilts his head up towards the sky again.</p><p>he\u2019s never been so intensely infatuated with anything as much as he is with her. peter likes her more than just <i>likes</i>. he thinks he really has a shot at something special. and although he\u2019s never felt this emotion before, he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s the same feeling that aunt may and uncle ben had. a little short, romantic word that started with an L&hellip;</p><p>-</p><p>\u201ci have a surprise for you\u201d. the tip of her nose is red as she holds back a smile. peter stands in front of her with his palms supporting her jaw and thumbs lightly running over the soft skin of her rosy cheeks. he can see the spark in her eyes and the devious smile she wore on her lips. </p><p>\u201cwhat are you up to?\u201d, he curiously asks with an eye brown raised. she giggles in excitement and quickly crouches down, reaching under her bed. peter\u2019s ears pick up the sound of glass rolling against the floor and he curiously eyes her as she takes out a fancy bottle of red wine. </p><p>\u201cmama lets me drink sometimes\u201d. her cheeks are a light shade of red as she blushes. there were only a handful of times that she was allowed a glass of wine, a few being important events like celebrating the new year or at a wedding. but she had never drank just to do it. this was a whole new experience for her. </p><p>y/n can tell peter had never done anything so rebellious in his life by the way his eyes were glancing between her and the dark bottle. \u201ca-are you sure?\u201d, peter\u2019s voice wavers. he hopes it isn\u2019t too obvious that he\u2019s never broken the rules. but it is, and it\u2019s very obvious and very sweet to her. she loves the fact that he isn\u2019t a bad boy, just a sweet and affectionate one. y/n sets the bottle on her bed and smiles at the very frightened boy. </p><p>\u201covviamente (of course)\u201d, she whispers as she slides her arms around his neck. she takes her time pressing soft kisses against his cheek and temple and under the skin of his jaw. her kisses symbolize that she <i>had him.</i> that as long as he was with her he would be safe and protected and loved. and that\u2019s exactly what he felt. peter melts in her embrace and softly slips his arms around her waist, eyes closed so he can enjoy the moment. \u201cnon ti preoccupare, amore mio (don\u2019t worry, my love)\u201d.</p><p>y/n holds peter\u2019s hand as she sits back comfortably against her pillows. he follows and streches his legs and realizes he\u2019s a bit too big for the bed, his heels almost hanging off of the edge. y/n takes the two large wine glasses from her dresser and fills them almost half way, handing one to her love. peter eyes it curiously, swirling it around in the glass. </p><p>she drinks first, smiling as she appreciates the delicious flavor. y/n\u2019s eyes soften as she sees peter hesistate. her hand comfortingly rubs peter\u2019s knee and she softly tells him that he doesn\u2019t have to drink if he isn\u2019t in the mood. but he shakes his head and follows her lead, taking a small sip after a moment of hesitation. </p><p>peter moans as the drink slides down with ease. it was everything he thought it would be and more. the two sit in comfortable silence, just enjoying each other\u2019s company for a while. and it\u2019s not long before peter reaches for another sip from his glass, his nerves fading away with each taste. </p><p>peter lays comfortably as y/n places her leg softly around his waist, head resting on his shoulder. her hand creeps up to draw shapes along his stomach and she can feel the hint of abs from under his shirt. it takes everything in peter not to gasp at her touch. </p><p>the pair talk more about their personal lives; peter discussing all the things he misses from back home -which wasn\u2019t much. it was mostly may and the sandwiches at delmar\u2019s. </p><p>peter listens closely as y/n talks about how she has always wanted to visit new york. and it was surprising because she didn\u2019t seem to be the type of girl that would enjoy the busy city. peter describes everything he can remember about his beautiful neighborhood and where he grew up, painting an even more beautiful picture in y/n\u2019s mind. they both imagine themselves wandering the busy streets and enjoying each other\u2019s company in his small apartment. </p><p>\u201cpeter\u201d, y/n softly calls out. she props herself up by her arm, softly gazing at her sweet boy. a small smile is on his lips and she can see that his eyes are slightly glazed over. </p><p>\u201cyes?\u201d, he calls back softly. peter\u2019s fingertips delicately run through the front of her hair, tucking loose strands back in place. y/n gets lost in his touch, staring back at her sensitive love. \u201cyou are so beautiful\u201d. peter\u2019s words are slightly slurred together, a hint that he isn\u2019t entirely sober. \u201cso lovely\u201d. he compliments. y/n\u2019s cheeks heat up and she whispers for him to stop. not because she doesn\u2019t like the compliments, but because if he continued she would have to look away to hide her red cheeks. but peter doesn\u2019t stop. he can\u2019t. there aren\u2019t enough words to describe how perfect she is. \u201c<i>gorgeous&hellip;. amazing&hellip; angel</i>\u201d, he continues. she rests her forehead against his and traces the edge of his bottom lip with her thumb. \u201cmy dream girl\u201d, he whispers sweetly. peter doesn\u2019t realize just how much he\u2019s making y/n melt at his words. so much so that she can feel herself sink into him. </p><p>\u201cTu sei cosi speciale per me (you are so special to me)\u201d, she whispers lovingly. </p><p>peter smiles and tilts his head forward, catching her lips with his. she feels so comforting, like home. peter feels so safe and confident and nurtured when she\u2019s around and it\u2019s reassured with every kiss. his hand falls down the side of her face to hold the back of her head, not wanting the kiss to end any time soon. </p><p>peter starts giggling as they kiss more passionately and y/n pulls away. she knows he isn\u2019t in the right state of mind at the moment, but she doesn\u2019t blame him. it\u2019s sweet how soft he was when he had a little alcohol in his system. </p><p>he\u2019s almost wine drunk&hellip; <i>almost</i>. he can still comprehend what is happening but it\u2019s almost as if his head is in a cloud. everything was just a bit fuzzy. \u201cyou\u2019re the most incredible person i\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of meeting\u201d. peter smiles lazily at her. it was obvious that the drink was affecting him. y/n smiles as she presses light kisses around his nose and lips. </p><p>\u201ci love you\u201d, he whispers as he lets out a soft laugh. she holds back a gasp. it\u2019s the most wonderful feeling to her, of course she loved him back. but it wasn\u2019t the right moment. not yet. she didn\u2019t want peter to be half of himself when they shared their most special moment. it wasn\u2019t time yet. </p><p>\u201cyou need rest\u201d, she says in a soft voice. peter laughs at her as she rolls him over to lay on his stomach. </p><p>\u201ci\u2019m not tired\u201d, he says sleepily. a yawn contradicts him and she runs her fingertips along his back, coaxing him into a deep sleep. </p><p>\u201ci love you\u201d, he sleepily whispers again. soft sighs escape from him as he falls asleep quickly. y/n plants a light kiss on the shell of his ear and lays down next to him, finding sleep quickly as well. </p><p>something was so personal about their situation. maybe it was the fact that they had never felt this way about another person before&hellip; or maybe it was because they were both sound asleep in her delicate bed&hellip; whatever it was, it was perfect. </p><p>it was a perfect night spent with a perfect girl. </p><p>-</p><p>taglist: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\">@ephermcls</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgBdjiEx-XekIk42rd3j2Tg\">@directionerfae</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGhBmOGAKWn64S3vnTKIx_Q\">@milkyholland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQyXOvj9_hioJ6wpWmnFl9g\">@unicorntrooper</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mheeISf-lyR1lEb7Lihgmbg\">@cloudyyparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFx7iXyI_qZrKs0B3K652yA\">@spideyphysics</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRv05MeFFlWVocJcCjUNZtg\">@evrthngblvk</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mie33jH3ipMayoL2D38UnCQ\">@im-marvels-slut</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAHd-9vcc7WPHoPvg6ynP8g\">@sarepurdy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnX4d4dUBM-pCa6Wrzic0g\">@marvelousmorales</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miZCy8PMm16tc1wcQst1AKA\">@legendarypenofeating</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z8zrsHqre5rYL1lY1StWw\">@mrvlfangirl3190</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSsB6nPpfV88EVlk9tG570w\">@bbscx1987</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msWN5GUjMZ2yvDIh3DYgeNA\">@honeymarvel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdgIs-alHcc-EE31U4fs1VQ\">@emistrash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0EEZcozuia10J2yV6KDsZQ\">@imhappybutimalsosad</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi33B092yENBfzf0WO8ReAw\">@stylemute</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvSRgzLjSPsk6u-5e_tTycA\">@shuriwithparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgJhwm1N8BcbixN_utZP-Vw\">@unknwn98</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlXMgM6Q9E35qoTSstc7vvg\">@unusual-kindred-spirits</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQyyZjq1cC-uQ15CXbbruQ\">@bands-and-shietz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_TQBn45ScplC6jx3USobPg\">@midtownhighs</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/max0GS6jQBJVZoqcvZZz3jQ\">@godisavalkyrie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL5ioo93YPr5IXYLdpa_N9w\">@alina-margaret</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZPQYryl7RGgCxZB_JNUZKg\">@iwillalwaysreturm</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYE_dyuSoUZaeBQQeR-4ymw\">@softestgalaxy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mssPQToRVOWFCc02gx4PR1w\">@peterbparkerthsecondblog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meVnOPXGqlsY-VDJ681sHZA\">@tangledmusee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXJ4IyK9LrnY6JNCeGSYn0Q\">@stydia-4-ever</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH2nSJTPEVDlFm1upOJhzLg\">@bbyeliza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msDXO4bX2X1sUllxtTRcfIg\">@spideylovely</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myA14InDu7X77s-aCwP4uuA\">@spidey-holland67</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHeksqB1hnRuxf3NgrycBjQ\">@grayxswan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAU0ZbdOol8N91oufWyxgAA\">@mewcury</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m89yRBH0mHtrNd8CAxCdElw\">@holland-peters</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhC5N-PR0CeY8wzz2xT5p6g\">@holsterfieldxdreams</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-tOoZ5kZMoCAHwvJ2e5XEA\">@jin-hyuks</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf4bG-UqFoch8brGUD-eoBg\">@swtnrholland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMNzIU9LqySaw8VXyIGthHQ\">@marvel-musicals</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE5azESzHGLJDcjlXxfILCQ\">@fanboy-tom</a></p><p>petey-verse taglist: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vUxZR8qg4e8iMYkr_TigQ\">@embrace-themagic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1azhW4gnh8K9SN2Vf8nSSQ\">@musicgirl234</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBxDx83_DKff8gQYN60KVbw\">@tominhoodies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2A5hP_yFWgXsCAXfXZ7WBw\">@tom-hollands-eyelash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGPu3C1uGC4J7tnZ0gQ8Ghg\">@dangerousluv1</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3LdJaBeGunMLMn8_McpeJQ\">@gentlethunderstorm</a> </p>",

experience for her. </p><p>y/n can tell peter had never done anything so rebellious in his life by the way his eyes were glancing between her and the dark bottle. \u201ca-are you sure?\u201d, peter\u2019s voice wavers. he hopes it isn\u2019t too obvious that he\u2019s never broken the rules. but it is, and it\u2019s very obvious and very sweet to her. she loves the fact that he isn\u2019t a bad boy, just a sweet and affectionate one. y/n sets the bottle on her bed and smiles at the very frightened boy. </p><p>\u201covviamente (of course)\u201d, she whispers as she slides her arms around his neck. she takes her time pressing soft kisses against his cheek and temple and under the skin of his jaw. her kisses symbolize that she <i>had him.</i> that as long as he was with her he would be safe and protected and loved. and that\u2019s exactly what he felt. peter melts in her embrace and softly slips his arms around her waist, eyes closed so he can enjoy the moment. \u201cnon ti preoccupare, amore mio (don\u2019t worry, my love)\u201d.</p><p>y/n holds peter\u2019s hand as she sits back comfortably against her pillows. he follows and streches his legs and realizes he\u2019s a bit too big for the bed, his heels almost hanging off of the edge. y/n takes the two large wine glasses from her dresser and fills them almost half way, handing one to her love. peter eyes it curiously, swirling it around in the glass. </p><p>she drinks first, smiling as she appreciates the delicious flavor. y/n\u2019s eyes soften as she sees peter hesistate. her hand comfortingly rubs peter\u2019s knee and she softly tells him that he doesn\u2019t have to drink if he isn\u2019t in the mood. but he shakes his head and follows her lead, taking a small sip after a moment of hesitation. </p><p>peter moans as the drink slides down with ease. it was everything he thought it would be and more. the two sit in comfortable silence, just enjoying each other\u2019s company for a while. and it\u2019s not long before peter reaches for another sip from his glass, his nerves fading away with each taste. </p><p>peter lays comfortably as y/n places her leg softly around his waist, head resting on his shoulder. her hand creeps up to draw shapes along his stomach and she can feel the hint of abs from under his shirt. it takes everything in peter not to gasp at her touch. </p><p>the pair talk more about their personal lives; peter discussing all the things he misses from back home -which wasn\u2019t much. it was mostly may and the sandwiches at delmar\u2019s. </p><p>peter listens closely as y/n talks about how she has always wanted to visit new york. and it was surprising because she didn\u2019t seem to be the type of girl that would enjoy the busy city. peter describes everything he can remember about his beautiful neighborhood and where he grew up, painting an even more beautiful picture in y/n\u2019s mind. they both imagine themselves wandering the busy streets and enjoying each other\u2019s company in his small apartment. </p><p>\u201cpeter\u201d, y/n softly calls out. she props herself up by her arm, softly gazing at her sweet boy. a small smile is on his lips and she can see that his eyes are slightly glazed over. </p><p>\u201cyes?\u201d, he calls back softly. peter\u2019s fingertips delicately run through the front of her hair, tucking loose strands back in place. y/n gets lost in his touch, staring back at her sensitive love. \u201cyou are so beautiful\u201d. peter\u2019s words are slightly slurred together, a hint that he isn\u2019t entirely sober. \u201cso lovely\u201d. he compliments. y/n\u2019s cheeks heat up and she whispers for him to stop. not because she doesn\u2019t like the compliments, but because if he continued she would have to look away to hide her red cheeks. but peter doesn\u2019t stop. he can\u2019t. there aren\u2019t enough words to describe how perfect she is. \u201c<i>gorgeous\u2026. amazing\u2026 angel</i>\u201d, he continues. she rests her forehead against his and traces the edge of his bottom lip with her thumb. \u201cmy dream girl\u201d, he whispers sweetly. peter doesn\u2019t realize just how much he\u2019s making y/n melt at his words. so much so that she can feel herself sink into him. </p><p>\u201cTu sei cosi speciale per me (you are so special to me)\u201d, she whispers lovingly. </p><p>peter smiles and tilts his head forward, catching her lips with his. she feels so comforting, like home. peter feels so safe and confident and nurtured when she\u2019s around and it\u2019s reassured with every kiss. his hand falls down the side of her face to hold the back of her head, not wanting the kiss to end any time soon. </p><p>peter starts giggling as they kiss more passionately and y/n pulls away. she knows he isn\u2019t in the right state of mind at the moment, but she doesn\u2019t blame him. it\u2019s sweet how soft he was when he had a little alcohol in his system. </p><p>he\u2019s almost wine drunk\u2026 <i>almost</i>. he can still comprehend what is happening but it\u2019s almost as if his head is in a cloud. everything was just a bit fuzzy. \u201cyou\u2019re the most incredible person i\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of meeting\u201d. peter smiles lazily at her. it was obvious that the drink was affecting him. y/n smiles as she presses light kisses around his nose and lips. </p><p>\u201ci love you\u201d, he whispers as he lets out a soft laugh. she holds back a gasp. it\u2019s the most wonderful feeling to her, of course she loved him back. but it wasn\u2019t the right moment. not yet. she didn\u2019t want peter to be half of himself when they shared their most special moment. it wasn\u2019t time yet. </p><p>\u201cyou need rest\u201d, she says in a soft voice. peter laughs at her as she rolls him over to lay on his stomach. </p><p>\u201ci\u2019m not tired\u201d, he says sleepily. a yawn contradicts him and she runs her fingertips along his back, coaxing him into a deep sleep. </p><p>\u201ci love you\u201d, he sleepily whispers again. soft sighs escape from him as he falls asleep quickly. y/n plants a light kiss on the shell of his ear and lays down next to him, finding sleep quickly as well. </p><p>something was so personal about their situation. maybe it was the fact that they had never felt this way about another person before\u2026 or maybe it was because they were both sound asleep in her delicate bed\u2026 whatever it was, it was perfect. </p><p>it was a perfect night spent with a perfect girl.

a nice thing to think about on this warm and beautiful night. the skies were clear and there was not a single hint of a breeze. it was perfect. a perfect night with a perfect girl. </p><p>y/n\u2019s head tilts up as her finger slips under the neckline of his shirt, tracing the skin along his prominent collarbone. she smiles as goosebumps appears around the skin. it was so cute how much she affected him. </p><p>\u201cplease, come to my window tonight. ho in programma qualcosa di speciale (i have something special planned)\u201d. her words are soft and peter doesn\u2019t resist her offer. because\u2026 how could he? she was such an angel, he would do anything that she asked of him. </p><p>\u201cof course\u201d, peter whispers. y/n smiles and tells him to meet her by her window around 11pm. peter agrees excitedly to her plan and watches her walk slowly back into the hotel after ending their conversation with a light kiss. peter sighs happily as he tilts his head up towards the sky again.</p><p>he\u2019s never been so intensely infatuated with anything as much as he is with her. peter likes her more than just <i>likes</i>. he thinks he really has a shot at something special. and although he\u2019s never felt this emotion before, he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s the same feeling that aunt may and uncle ben had. a little short, romantic word that started with an L\u2026</p><p>-</p><p>\u201ci have a surprise for you\u201d. the tip of her nose is red as she holds back a smile. peter stands in front of her with his palms supporting her jaw and thumbs lightly running over the soft skin of her rosy cheeks. he can see the spark in her eyes and the devious smile she wore on her lips. </p><p>\u201cwhat are you up to?\u201d, he curiously asks with an eye brown raised. she giggles in excitement and quickly crouches down, reaching under her bed. peter\u2019s ears pick up the sound of glass rolling against the floor and he curiously eyes her as she takes out a fancy bottle of red wine. </p><p>\u201cmama lets me drink sometimes\u201d. her cheeks are a light shade of red as she blushes. there were only a handful of times that she was allowed a glass of wine, a few being important events like celebrating the new year or at a wedding. but she had never drank just to do it. this was a whole new experience for her. </p><p>y/n can tell peter had never done anything so rebellious in his life by the way his eyes were glancing between her and the dark bottle. \u201ca-are you sure?\u201d, peter\u2019s voice wavers. he hopes it isn\u2019t too obvious that he\u2019s never broken the rules. but it is, and it\u2019s very obvious and very sweet to her. she loves the fact that he isn\u2019t a bad boy, just a sweet and affectionate one. y/n sets the bottle on her bed and smiles at the very frightened boy. </p><p>\u201covviamente (of course)\u201d, she whispers as she slides her arms around his neck. she takes her time pressing soft kisses against his cheek and temple and under the skin of his jaw. her kisses symbolize that she <i>had him.</i> that as long as he was with her he would be safe and protected and loved. and that\u2019s exactly what he

how could he? she was such an angel, he would do anything that she asked of him. </p><p>&ldquo;of course&rdquo;, peter whispers. y/n smiles and tells him to meet her by her window around 11pm. peter agrees excitedly to her plan and watches her walk slowly back into the hotel after ending their conversation with a light kiss. peter sighs happily as he tilts his head up towards the sky again.</p><p>he&rsquo;s never been so intensely infatuated with anything as much as he is with her. peter likes her more than just <i>likes</i>. he thinks he really has a shot at something special. and although he&rsquo;s never felt this emotion before, he&rsquo;s pretty sure it&rsquo;s the same feeling that aunt may and uncle ben had. a little short, romantic word that started with an L&hellip;</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;i have a surprise for you&rdquo;. the tip of her nose is red as she holds back a smile. peter stands in front of her with his palms supporting her jaw and thumbs lightly running over the soft skin of her rosy cheeks. he can see the spark in her eyes and the devious smile she wore on her lips. </p><p>&ldquo;what are you up to?&rdquo;, he curiously asks with an eye brown raised. she giggles in excitement and quickly crouches down, reaching under her bed. peter&rsquo;s ears pick up the sound of glass rolling against the floor and he curiously eyes her as she takes out a fancy bottle of red wine. </p><p>&ldquo;mama lets me drink sometimes&rdquo;. her cheeks are a light shade of red as she blushes. there were only a handful of times that she was allowed a glass of wine, a few being important events like celebrating the new year or at a wedding. but she had never drank just to do it. this was a whole new experience for her. </p><p>y/n can tell peter had never done anything so rebellious in his life by the way his eyes were glancing between her and the dark bottle. &ldquo;a-are you sure?&rdquo;, peter&rsquo;s voice wavers. he hopes it isn&rsquo;t too obvious that he&rsquo;s never broken the rules. but it is, and it&rsquo;s very obvious and very sweet to her. she loves the fact that he isn&rsquo;t a bad boy, just a sweet and affectionate one. y/n sets the bottle on her bed and smiles at the very frightened boy. </p><p>&ldquo;ovviamente (of course)&rdquo;, she whispers as she slides her arms around his neck. she takes her time pressing soft kisses against his cheek and temple and under the skin of his jaw. her kisses symbolize that she <i>had him.</i> that as long as he was with her he would be safe and protected and loved. and that&rsquo;s exactly what he felt. peter melts in her embrace and softly slips his arms around her waist, eyes closed so he can enjoy the moment. &ldquo;non ti preoccupare, amore mio (don&rsquo;t worry, my love)&rdquo;.</p><p>y/n holds peter&rsquo;s hand as she sits back comfortably against her pillows. he follows and streches his legs and realizes he&rsquo;s a bit too big for the bed, his heels almost hanging off of the edge. y/n takes the two large wine glasses from her dresser and fills them almost half way, handing one to her love. peter eyes it curiously, swirling it around in the glass. </p><p>she drinks first, smiling as she appreciates the delicious flavor. y/n&rsquo;s eyes soften as she sees peter hesistate. her hand comfortingly rubs peter&rsquo;s knee and she softly tells him that he doesn&rsquo;t have to drink if he isn&rsquo;t in the mood. but he shakes his head and follows her lead, taking a small sip after a moment of hesitation. </p><p>peter moans as the drink slides down with ease. it was everything he thought it would be and more. the two sit in comfortable silence, just enjoying each other&rsquo;s company for a while. and it&rsquo;s not long before peter reaches for another sip from his glass, his nerves fading away with each taste. </p><p>peter lays comfortably as y/n places her leg softly around his waist, head resting on his shoulder. her hand creeps up to draw shapes along his stomach and she can feel the hint of abs from under his shirt. it takes everything in peter not to gasp at her touch. </p><p>the pair talk more about their personal lives; peter discussing all the things he misses from back home -which wasn&rsquo;t much. it was mostly may and the sandwiches at delmar&rsquo;s. </p><p>peter listens closely as y/n talks about how she has always wanted to visit new york. and it was surprising because she didn&rsquo;t seem to be the type of girl that would enjoy the busy city. peter describes everything he can remember about his beautiful neighborhood and where he grew up, painting an even more beautiful picture in y/n&rsquo;s mind. they both imagine themselves wandering the busy streets and enjoying each other&rsquo;s company in his small apartment. </p><p>&ldquo;peter&rdquo;, y/n softly calls out. she props herself up by her arm, softly gazing at her sweet boy. a small smile is on his lips and she can see that his eyes are slightly glazed over. </p><p>&ldquo;yes?&rdquo;, he calls back softly. peter&rsquo;s fingertips delicately run through the front of her hair, tucking loose strands back in place. y/n gets lost in his touch, staring back at her sensitive love. &ldquo;you are so beautiful&rdquo;. peter&rsquo;s words are slightly slurred together, a hint that he isn&rsquo;t entirely sober. &ldquo;so lovely&rdquo;. he compliments. y/n&rsquo;s cheeks heat up and she whispers for him to stop. not because she doesn&rsquo;t like the compliments, but because if he continued she would have to look away to hide her red cheeks. but peter doesn&rsquo;t stop. he can&rsquo;t. there aren&rsquo;t enough words to describe how perfect she is. &ldquo;<i>gorgeous&hellip;. amazing&hellip; angel</i>&rdquo;, he continues. she rests her forehead against his and traces the edge of his bottom lip with her thumb. &ldquo;my dream girl&rdquo;, he whispers sweetly. peter doesn&rsquo;t realize just how much he&rsquo;s making y/n melt at his words. so much so that she can feel herself sink into him. </p><p>&ldquo;Tu sei cosi speciale per me (you are so special to me)&rdquo;, she whispers lovingly. </p><p>peter smiles and tilts his head forward, catching her lips with his. she feels so comforting, like home. peter feels so safe and confident and nurtured when she&rsquo;s around and it&rsquo;s reassured with every kiss. his hand falls down the side of her face to hold the back of her head, not wanting the kiss to end any time soon. </p><p>peter starts giggling as they kiss more passionately and y/n pulls away. she knows he isn&rsquo;t in the right state of mind at the moment, but she doesn&rsquo;t blame him. it&rsquo;s sweet how soft he was when he had a little alcohol in his system. </p><p>he&rsquo;s almost wine drunk&hellip; <i>almost</i>. he can still comprehend what is happening but it&rsquo;s almost as if his head is in a cloud. everything was just a bit fuzzy. &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the most incredible person i&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of meeting&rdquo;. peter smiles lazily at her. it was obvious that the drink was affecting him. y/n smiles as she presses light kisses around his nose and lips. </p><p>&ldquo;i love you&rdquo;, he whispers as he lets out a soft laugh. she holds back a gasp. it&rsquo;s the most wonderful feeling to her, of course she loved him back. but it wasn&rsquo;t the right moment. not yet. she didn&rsquo;t want peter to be half of himself when they shared their most special moment. it wasn&rsquo;t time yet. </p><p>&ldquo;you need rest&rdquo;, she says in a soft voice. peter laughs at her as she rolls him over to lay on his stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m not tired&rdquo;, he says sleepily. a yawn contradicts him and she runs her fingertips along his back, coaxing him into a deep sleep. </p><p>&ldquo;i love you&rdquo;, he sleepily whispers again. soft sighs escape from him as he falls asleep quickly. y/n plants a light kiss on the shell of his ear and lays down next to him, finding sleep quickly as well. </p><p>something was so personal about their situation. maybe it was the fact that they had never felt this way about another person before&hellip; or maybe it was because they were both sound asleep in her delicate bed&hellip; whatever it was, it was perfect. </p><p>it was a perfect night spent with a perfect girl. </p><p>-</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\">@ephermcls</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgBdjiEx-XekIk42rd3j2Tg\">@directionerfae</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGhBmOGAKWn64S3vnTKIx_Q\">@milkyholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQyXOvj9_hioJ6wpWmnFl9g\">@unicorntrooper</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mheeISf-lyR1lEb7Lihgmbg\">@cloudyyparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFx7iXyI_qZrKs0B3K652yA\">@spideyphysics</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRv05MeFFlWVocJcCjUNZtg\">@evrthngblvk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mie33jH3ipMayoL2D38UnCQ\">@im-marvels-slut</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAHd-9vcc7WPHoPvg6ynP8g\">@sarepurdy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnX4d4dUBM-pCa6Wrzic0g\">@marvelousmorales</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miZCy8PMm16tc1wcQst1AKA\">@legendarypenofeating</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z8zrsHqre5rYL1lY1StWw\">@mrvlfangirl3190</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSsB6nPpfV88EVlk9tG570w\">@bbscx1987</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msWN5GUjMZ2yvDIh3DYgeNA\">@honeymarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdgIs-alHcc-EE31U4fs1VQ\">@emistrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0EEZcozuia10J2yV6KDsZQ\">@imhappybutimalsosad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi33B092yENBfzf0WO8ReAw\">@stylemute</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvSRgzLjSPsk6u-5e_tTycA\">@shuriwithparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgJhwm1N8BcbixN_utZP-Vw\">@unknwn98</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlXMgM6Q9E35qoTSstc7vvg\">@unusual-kindred-spirits</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQyyZjq1cC-uQ15CXbbruQ\">@bands-and-shietz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_TQBn45ScplC6jx3USobPg\">@midtownhighs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/max0GS6jQBJVZoqcvZZz3jQ\">@godisavalkyrie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL5ioo93YPr5IXYLdpa_N9w\">@alina-margaret</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZPQYryl7RGgCxZB_JNUZKg\">@iwillalwaysreturm</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYE_dyuSoUZaeBQQeR-4ymw\">@softestgalaxy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mssPQToRVOWFCc02gx4PR1w\">@peterbparkerthsecondblog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meVnOPXGqlsY-VDJ681sHZA\">@tangledmusee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXJ4IyK9LrnY6JNCeGSYn0Q\">@stydia-4-ever</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH2nSJTPEVDlFm1upOJhzLg\">@bbyeliza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msDXO4bX2X1sUllxtTRcfIg\">@spideylovely</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myA14InDu7X77s-aCwP4uuA\">@spidey-holland67</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHeksqB1hnRuxf3NgrycBjQ\">@grayxswan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAU0ZbdOol8N91oufWyxgAA\">@mewcury</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m89yRBH0mHtrNd8CAxCdElw\">@holland-peters</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhC5N-PR0CeY8wzz2xT5p6g\">@holsterfieldxdreams</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-tOoZ5kZMoCAHwvJ2e5XEA\">@jin-hyuks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf4bG-UqFoch8brGUD-eoBg\">@swtnrholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMNzIU9LqySaw8VXyIGthHQ\">@marvel-musicals</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE5azESzHGLJDcjlXxfILCQ\">@fanboy-tom</a></p><p>petey-verse taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vUxZR8qg4e8iMYkr_TigQ\">@embrace-themagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1azhW4gnh8K9SN2Vf8nSSQ\">@musicgirl234</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBxDx83_DKff8gQYN60KVbw\">@tominhoodies</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2A5hP_yFWgXsCAXfXZ7WBw\">@tom-hollands-eyelash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGPu3C1uGC4J7tnZ0gQ8Ghg\">@dangerousluv1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3LdJaBeGunMLMn8_McpeJQ\">@gentlethunderstorm</a> </p>",

I did support her, I too wanted revenge.</i></p><p>It&rsquo;s been 3 days, Y/n is in SHIELD custody. I never expected she would lie to me! I used to love her, for her being a pure soul, but it turns out that people come in disguises. Se tried to kill us?! She&rsquo;s one of the bad guys, I fought every now and then. She told me, that she has changed, but Fury informed me about her, contacting her boss!!!</p><p><i>Everything is temporary, </i><i>this was merely one of those things.</i></p><!-- more --><p>I was recalling everything, lying on my bed, staring at the ceiling, it was just 2 pm when I heard a doorbell. May wasn&rsquo;t home, so I rushed to receive the door. As I opened the door, I saw Y/n&rsquo;s foster mom standing there.</p><p><i>What is she doing here?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Ah, hi!&rdquo; I greeted, with loads of questions wandering inside my head.<br/>&ldquo;Is Y/n with you?&rdquo; she asked, a little worried.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she&hellip;? You aren&rsquo;t informed&mdash;-?&rdquo; <br/>I don&rsquo;t know what to say, how is this even possible?! SHIELD always informs the captured culprit&rsquo;s family within the first 24 hours of custody, and it&rsquo;s freaking more than 72 hours!!</p><p>&ldquo;Informed of what? I know I didn&rsquo;t do good to her, but still, she&rsquo;s part of my family. I realized I took her for granted. If she ran off to you then please help me meet her.&rdquo; Her words sounded <i>genuine</i>.</p><p><i>How is this possible? SHIELD isn&rsquo;t this irresponsible, why didn&rsquo;t they inform her?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you replying? Is she fine? Tell me! Please!&rdquo; she demanded, I could see tears forming in her eyes.</p><p><i>Wasn&rsquo;t she the one who hurt her?</i> <br/>And now she&rsquo;s shedding tears in her absence! <i>Y/n is a girl with value.</i> There is something weird going over here, something beyond my understanding&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s safe. Don&rsquo;t worry. I will tell you about her, just give me some time.&rdquo; I said trying to make her calm down. I slowly shut the door giving her a weak smile, instantly rushing to my room, wearing my suit and mask, swinging towards the SHIELD headquarters.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br/>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Spider-Man?&rdquo; Agent Koenig welcomed me with his amusing voice. With a proud look, he lifted his double chin to take a glance of my masked eyes. <br/>&ldquo;Just wanting to meet Fury,&rdquo; I responded, walking inside the headquarters swiftly, as he followed me behind. <br/>&ldquo;Fury&rsquo;s not in town.&rdquo; he conceded, making me stop on my path.<br/>&ldquo;What? Where is he then, Sam?&rdquo; I asked, turning my face towards him. <br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Billy, Sam is the shorter one!&rdquo; he said reaching near my face. <br/>&ldquo;Okay okay, Billy. You&rsquo;re twins?&hellip; &rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Quadruplets&rdquo; he interjected. <br/>&ldquo;Fine&hellip; All four of you &rsquo;<i>quadruplet</i>&rsquo; Koenig brothers are tell that the other one is shorter, and fuckin&rsquo; all of you are absolutely identical.&rdquo; I said, frustrated. <br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the tallest of the four, Sam is 160.98 centimetres, while I&rsquo;m 161.04 centimetres. And talking of Eric and Thurston, they are 161.01 and 160.91 centimeters respectively,&rdquo; he said straightening his chest, in a proud gesticulation.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t interrupt him in between, cause interrupting any of the Koenig brothers in the middle, would only result in an extra ten minutes of extremely aggravating speech. When he was done with all the unnecessary nonsense, I clenched my fist trying to calm myself down, as the possibility of him continuing that speech was high. But he stopped.</p><p><i>Thank God!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Fury?&rdquo; I asked again. <br/>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s somewhere in a secret mission, out of the American continent since a week. I don&rsquo;t know his location as it&rsquo;s classified for a level 6 agent,&rdquo; he stated, touching the SHIELD identification card, pinned to his coat. <br/>&ldquo;A week!!!&rdquo; I yelled, stunned. <br/>&ldquo;Yeah, a week,&rdquo; he repeated, surprised by my thunderbolt reaction. <br/>&ldquo;No, a week?! Are you sure! Where was he 3 days before?! &rdquo; a rude awakening filled my tone. <br/>&ldquo;He was not in America since a week, it&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo; he clarified confidently, with his voice free from any ambiguity.</p><p><i>Then who was the one, </i><br/><i>who captured Y/n that day?!</i></p><p>I was lost in my thoughts, trying to think, when &lsquo;Billy&rsquo; Koenig cut in. <br/>&ldquo;Is there something wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, absolutely not.&rdquo; I lied.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t wait to hear his response and at a gallop, moved out of the headquarters, straight to the building from where Y/n was abducted.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br/><i>What is the missing piece? </i><br/><i>What&rsquo;s going on here?</i></p><p>I questioned myself, trying to search for a clue on that rooftop, but in <i>vain</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing&rdquo; I yelled to myself, slapping my waist in discontent, until a sharp pain was experienced beneath my skin where I slapped myself, like if a metal piece was pressed on my skin. I touched at the skin through my spandex suit, where the sharp pain was witnessed. I felt like something was kept inside my pocket, something like a ring!</p><p>My breath hitched, thinking of the possibility, as my hand slid slowly, inside my pocket, revealing a ring.</p><p><i>Wait!</i> Not <i>a ring</i>, but <i>the ring</i>.</p><p><i>Y/n&rsquo;s ring! </i><br/>The one that gave her powers.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it doing here? How is this ring with me?&rdquo; I panicked trying to recall everything that happened that day.</p><p><i>She was trembling, because of that taser treatment. She fell on me. I held her unconscious body, but before that, I could feel her hand in my pocket.</i></p><p><i>She intentionally put this ring in my pocket. But why?</i></p><p>That man can&rsquo;t be Fury. I&rsquo;m sure he was someone else. <i>Is Y/n in danger?</i> Where is she? How am I gonna find her?!</p><p>I was anxiously walking on the roof with at least a zillion questions racing inside my head, but suddenly I felt a tingling sensation in my head, I could feel goosebumps rising on my skin.</p><p><i>My spidey senses were activated. </i><br/><i>Something dangerous is going to happen.</i></p><p>And in the other moment, I saw an intense flash of orange light in the sky, accompanied by a loud <i>thud</i> sound, making me instantly turn back. I could see a large amount of black smoke coming from the nearby historical museum. I slid back the ring in my pocket and swung towards the smoke. The museum was on fire, car alarms were all off, people are running, <i>chaos</i> everywhere.</p><p>&ldquo;Spider-Man! Finally, we met.&rdquo; an unfamiliar, high pitched female voice welcomed me. I turned back to see a girl near about my age wearing an armour <i>kind of</i> outfit.</p><p>&ldquo;You are?&rdquo; I squinted my eyes, questioning her.</p><p>&ldquo;Dorothea, Y/n must have mentioned me earlier,&rdquo; she replied with a grin.</p><p>I felt like I was getting paralyzed. The woman Y/n warned me about was right in front of me.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you explode this place?&rdquo; I questioned.<br/>&ldquo;I had to contact you somehow, and unfortunately I was devoid of your phone number, so&hellip; &rdquo; she shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is Y/n?&rdquo; I almost yelled.<br/>&ldquo;Aww&hellip; both of you are so worried about each other. I would have really shipped you both if she was still alive,&rdquo; she said pouting, making me feel like the floor slipped under my feet.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by was still alive?

May wasn\u2019t home, so I rushed to receive the door. As I opened the door, I saw Y/n\u2019s foster mom standing there.</p><p><i>What is she doing here?</i></p><p>\u201cAh, hi!\u201d I greeted, with loads of questions wandering inside my head.<br>\u201cIs Y/n with you?\u201d she asked, a little worried.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she\u2026? You aren\u2019t informed\u2014-?\u201d <br>I don\u2019t know what to say, how is this even possible?! SHIELD always informs the captured culprit\u2019s family within the first 24 hours of custody, and it\u2019s freaking more than 72 hours!!</p><p>\u201cInformed of what? I know I didn\u2019t do good to her, but still, she\u2019s part of my family. I realized I took her for granted. If she ran off to you then please help me meet her.\u201d Her words sounded <i>genuine</i>.</p><p><i>How is this possible? SHIELD isn\u2019t this irresponsible, why didn\u2019t they inform her?</i></p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you replying? Is she fine? Tell me! Please!\u201d she demanded, I could see tears forming in her eyes.</p><p><i>Wasn\u2019t she the one who hurt her?</i> <br>And now she\u2019s shedding tears in her absence! <i>Y/n is a girl with value.</i> There is something weird going over here, something beyond my understanding\u2026</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe. Don\u2019t worry. I will tell you about her, just give me some time.\u201d I said trying to make her calm down. I slowly shut the door giving her a weak smile, instantly rushing to my room, wearing my suit and mask, swinging towards the SHIELD headquarters.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\u201cWhat\u2019s up Spider-Man?\u201d Agent Koenig welcomed me with his amusing voice. With a proud look, he lifted his double chin to take a glance of my masked eyes. <br>\u201cJust wanting to meet Fury,\u201d I responded, walking inside the headquarters swiftly, as he followed me behind. <br>\u201cFury\u2019s not in town.\u201d he conceded, making me stop on my path.<br>\u201cWhat? Where is he then, Sam?\u201d I asked, turning my face towards him. <br>\u201cI\u2019m Billy, Sam is the shorter one!\u201d he said reaching near my face. <br>\u201cOkay okay, Billy. You\u2019re twins?\u2026 \u201d<br>\u201cQuadruplets\u201d he interjected. <br>\u201cFine\u2026 All four of you \u2019<i>quadruplet</i>\u2019 Koenig brothers are tell that the other one is shorter, and fuckin\u2019 all of you are absolutely identical.\u201d I said, frustrated. <br>\u201cI\u2019m the tallest of the four, Sam is 160.98 centimetres, while I\u2019m 161.04 centimetres. And talking of Eric and Thurston, they are 161.01 and 160.91 centimeters respectively,\u201d he said straightening his chest, in a proud gesticulation.</p><p>I didn\u2019t interrupt him in between, cause interrupting any of the Koenig brothers in the middle, would only result in an extra ten minutes of extremely aggravating speech. When he was done with all the unnecessary nonsense, I clenched my fist trying to calm myself down, as the possibility of him continuing that speech was high. But he stopped.</p><p><i>Thank God!</i></p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Fury?\u201d I asked again. <br>\u201cHe\u2019s somewhere in a secret mission, out of the American continent since a week. I don\u2019t know his location as it\u2019s classified for a level 6 agent,\u201d he stated, touching the SHIELD identification card, pinned to his coat. <br>\u201cA week!!!\u201d I yelled, stunned. <br>\u201cYeah, a week,\u201d he repeated, surprised by my thunderbolt reaction. <br>\u201cNo, a week?! Are you sure! Where was he 3 days before?! \u201d a rude awakening filled my tone. <br>\u201cHe was not in America since a week, it\u2019s for sure.\u201d he clarified confidently, with his voice free from any ambiguity.</p><p><i>Then who was the one, </i><br><i>who captured Y/n that day?!</i></p><p>I was lost in my thoughts, trying to think, when \u2018Billy\u2019 Koenig cut in. <br>\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2026\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait to hear his response and at a gallop, moved out of the headquarters, straight to the building from where Y/n was abducted.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br><i>What is the missing piece? </i><br><i>What\u2019s going on here?</i></p><p>I questioned myself, trying to search for a clue on that rooftop, but in <i>vain</i>.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u201d I yelled to myself, slapping my waist in discontent, until a sharp pain was experienced beneath my skin where I slapped myself, like if a metal piece was pressed on my skin. I touched at the skin through my spandex suit, where the sharp pain was witnessed. I felt like something was kept inside my pocket, something like a ring!</p><p>My breath hitched, thinking of the possibility, as my hand slid slowly, inside my pocket, revealing a ring.</p><p><i>Wait!</i> Not <i>a ring</i>, but <i>the ring</i>.</p><p><i>Y/n\u2019s ring! </i><br>The one that gave her powers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it doing here? How is this ring with me?\u201d I panicked trying to recall everything that happened that day.</p><p><i>She was trembling, because of that taser treatment. She fell on me. I held her unconscious body, but before that, I could feel her hand in my pocket.</i></p><p><i>She intentionally put this ring in my pocket. But why?</i></p><p>That man can\u2019t be Fury. I\u2019m sure he was someone else. <i>Is Y/n in danger?</i> Where is she? How am I gonna find her?!</p><p>I was anxiously walking on the roof with at least a zillion questions racing inside my head, but suddenly I felt a tingling sensation in my head, I could feel goosebumps rising on my skin.</p><p><i>My spidey senses were activated. </i><br><i>Something dangerous is going to happen.</i></p><p>And in the other moment, I saw an intense flash of orange light in the sky, accompanied by a loud <i>thud</i> sound, making me instantly turn back. I could see a large amount of black smoke coming from the nearby historical museum. I slid back the ring in my pocket and swung towards the smoke. The museum was on fire, car alarms were all off, people are running, <i>chaos</i> everywhere.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man! Finally, we met.\u201d an unfamiliar, high pitched female voice welcomed me. I turned back to see a girl near about my age wearing an armour <i>kind of</i> outfit.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d I squinted my eyes, questioning her.</p><p>\u201cDorothea, Y/n must have mentioned me earlier,\u201d she replied with a grin.</p><p>I felt like I was getting paralyzed. The woman Y/n warned me about was right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you explode this place?\u201d I questioned.<br>\u201cI had to contact you somehow, and unfortunately I was devoid of your phone number, so\u2026 \u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Y/n?\u201d I almost yelled.<br>\u201cAww\u2026 both of you are so worried about each other. I would have really shipped you both if she was still alive,\u201d she said pouting, making me feel like the floor slipped under my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by was still alive? Does she \u2014 is she dead?!\u201d I was hunted by my own words.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"103\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f88ec0d2f640ef101e628985825d905/tumblr_inline_pozw1qGE1i1wsc5ww_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"103\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><b>(TBC) <b>Taglist in the reblogged post.

I did support her, I too wanted revenge.</i></p><p>It&rsquo;s been 3 days, Y/n is in SHIELD custody. I never expected she would lie to me! I used to love her, for her being a pure soul, but it turns out that people come in disguises. Se tried to kill us?! She&rsquo;s one of the bad guys, I fought every now and then. She told me, that she has changed, but Fury informed me about her, contacting her boss!!!</p><p><i>Everything is temporary, </i><i>this was merely one of those things.</i></p><p>I was recalling everything, lying on my bed, staring at the ceiling, it was just 2 pm when I heard a doorbell. May wasn&rsquo;t home, so I rushed to receive the door. As I opened the door, I saw Y/n&rsquo;s foster mom standing there.</p><p><i>What is she doing here?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Ah, hi!&rdquo; I greeted, with loads of questions wandering inside my head.<br />&ldquo;Is Y/n with you?&rdquo; she asked, a little worried.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she&hellip;? You aren&rsquo;t informed&mdash;-?&rdquo; <br />I don&rsquo;t know what to say, how is this even possible?! SHIELD always informs the captured culprit&rsquo;s family within the first 24 hours of custody, and it&rsquo;s freaking more than 72 hours!!</p><p>&ldquo;Informed of what? I know I didn&rsquo;t do good to her, but still, she&rsquo;s part of my family. I realized I took her for granted. If she ran off to you then please help me meet her.&rdquo; Her words sounded <i>genuine</i>.</p><p><i>How is this possible? SHIELD isn&rsquo;t this irresponsible, why didn&rsquo;t they inform her?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you replying? Is she fine? Tell me! Please!&rdquo; she demanded, I could see tears forming in her eyes.</p><p><i>Wasn&rsquo;t she the one who hurt her?</i> <br />And now she&rsquo;s shedding tears in her absence! <i>Y/n is a girl with value.</i> There is something weird going over here, something beyond my understanding&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s safe. Don&rsquo;t worry. I will tell you about her, just give me some time.&rdquo; I said trying to make her calm down. I slowly shut the door giving her a weak smile, instantly rushing to my room, wearing my suit and mask, swinging towards the SHIELD headquarters.</p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Spider-Man?&rdquo; Agent Koenig welcomed me with his amusing voice. With a proud look, he lifted his double chin to take a glance of my masked eyes. <br />&ldquo;Just wanting to meet Fury,&rdquo; I responded, walking inside the headquarters swiftly, as he followed me behind. <br />&ldquo;Fury&rsquo;s not in town.&rdquo; he conceded, making me stop on my path.<br />&ldquo;What? Where is he then, Sam?&rdquo; I asked, turning my face towards him. <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Billy, Sam is the shorter one!&rdquo; he said reaching near my face. <br />&ldquo;Okay okay, Billy. You&rsquo;re twins?&hellip; &rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Quadruplets&rdquo; he interjected. <br />&ldquo;Fine&hellip; All four of you &rsquo;<i>quadruplet</i>&rsquo; Koenig brothers are tell that the other one is shorter, and fuckin&rsquo; all of you are absolutely identical.&rdquo; I said, frustrated. <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the tallest of the four, Sam is 160.98 centimetres, while I&rsquo;m 161.04 centimetres. And talking of Eric and Thurston, they are 161.01 and 160.91 centimeters respectively,&rdquo; he said straightening his chest, in a proud gesticulation.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t interrupt him in between, cause interrupting any of the Koenig brothers in the middle, would only result in an extra ten minutes of extremely aggravating speech. When he was done with all the unnecessary nonsense, I clenched my fist trying to calm myself down, as the possibility of him continuing that speech was high. But he stopped.</p><p><i>Thank God!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Fury?&rdquo; I asked again. <br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s somewhere in a secret mission, out of the American continent since a week. I don&rsquo;t know his location as it&rsquo;s classified for a level 6 agent,&rdquo; he stated, touching the SHIELD identification card, pinned to his coat. <br />&ldquo;A week!!!&rdquo; I yelled, stunned. <br />&ldquo;Yeah, a week,&rdquo; he repeated, surprised by my thunderbolt reaction. <br />&ldquo;No, a week?! Are you sure! Where was he 3 days before?! &rdquo; a rude awakening filled my tone. <br />&ldquo;He was not in America since a week, it&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo; he clarified confidently, with his voice free from any ambiguity.</p><p><i>Then who was the one, </i><br /><i>who captured Y/n that day?!</i></p><p>I was lost in my thoughts, trying to think, when &lsquo;Billy&rsquo; Koenig cut in. <br />&ldquo;Is there something wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, absolutely not.&rdquo; I lied.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t wait to hear his response and at a gallop, moved out of the headquarters, straight to the building from where Y/n was abducted.</p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br /><i>What is the missing piece? </i><br /><i>What&rsquo;s going on here?</i></p><p>I questioned myself, trying to search for a clue on that rooftop, but in <i>vain</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing&rdquo; I yelled to myself, slapping my waist in discontent, until a sharp pain was experienced beneath my skin where I slapped myself, like if a metal piece was pressed on my skin. I touched at the skin through my spandex suit, where the sharp pain was witnessed. I felt like something was kept inside my pocket, something like a ring!</p><p>My breath hitched, thinking of the possibility, as my hand slid slowly, inside my pocket, revealing a ring.</p><p><i>Wait!</i> Not <i>a ring</i>, but <i>the ring</i>.</p><p><i>Y/n&rsquo;s ring! </i><br />The one that gave her powers.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it doing here? How is this ring with me?&rdquo; I panicked trying to recall everything that happened that day.</p><p><i>She was trembling, because of that taser treatment. She fell on me. I held her unconscious body, but before that, I could feel her hand in my pocket.</i></p><p><i>She intentionally put this ring in my pocket. But why?</i></p><p>That man can&rsquo;t be Fury. I&rsquo;m sure he was someone else. <i>Is Y/n in danger?</i> Where is she? How am I gonna find her?!</p><p>I was anxiously walking on the roof with at least a zillion questions racing inside my head, but suddenly I felt a tingling sensation in my head, I could feel goosebumps rising on my skin.</p><p><i>My spidey senses were activated. </i><br /><i>Something dangerous is going to happen.</i></p><p>And in the other moment, I saw an intense flash of orange light in the sky, accompanied by a loud <i>thud</i> sound, making me instantly turn back. I could see a large amount of black smoke coming from the nearby historical museum. I slid back the ring in my pocket and swung towards the smoke. The museum was on fire, car alarms were all off, people are running, <i>chaos</i> everywhere.</p><p>&ldquo;Spider-Man! Finally, we met.&rdquo; an unfamiliar, high pitched female voice welcomed me.
