        "body": "<p>With the arrival\nof the <i>Captain Marvel</i> movie only\nweeks away, the release of Carol Danvers material ratchets up with the\ncollection <i>Ms. Marvel: This Woman, This\nWarrior</i>, collecting her earliest costumed adventures.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"264\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbb098acc797951b68070eafcd648345/tumblr_inline_plbtq4lq4b1up58e9_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"264\"/></figure><p>Some time\nafter absorbing a blast of alien radiation, former NASA security chief Carol\nDanvers discovers she\u2019s acquired both powers similar to her old ally Captain\nMarvel (Mar-Vell) and extensive knowledge of the militaristic Kree. Carol\u2019s new\npowers manifest in an alternate personality, the forceful heroine Ms. Marvel.\nShe also acquires a \u201cSeventh Sense\u201d that warns her of danger and occasionally\nassails her with a physically painful vision of the future. Now a successful\nwriter, Carol accepts an offer from Daily Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson to\nbecome editor of the new \u201cWoman\u201d magazine. Carol struggles with her debilitating\nprecognition flashes, lack of control over her transformations into Ms. Marvel\nand the demands of her new role. The criminal scientists A.I.M. are eager to\ncapture Ms. Marvel and unlock the secrets of her human/Kree hybrid physiology.\nMs. Marvel comes up against a variety of other enemies, from the familiar to\nthe brand new, including Scorpion, MODOK, the Destructor, the Doomsday Man,\nGrotesk, Deathbird, Super Skrull and Steeplejack. Over the course of these\nadventures, Carol struggles to reconcile her two warring personas, while\nbeginning to make a name for herself as a costumed hero, teaming up along the way\nwith the Vision, Spider-Man and the Defenders.</p><p>At the time\nof <i>Ms. Marvel</i>\u2019s mid-70s debut, Carol\nDanvers had been kicking around the Marvel Universe for several years. She\u2019d\nbeen a key part of the supporting cast for the first couple of years of Captain\nMarvel\u2019s original run, but had fallen from prominence once Mar-Vell\u2019s\nadventures shifted away from the NASA setting. Marvel in the \u201870s eagerly mined\na variety of sub-cultures and movements for new character ideas, and Ms. Marvel\nrepresented a deliberate intention to reflect the feminist movement of the era.\nWriter Gerry Conway and artist John Buscema (with design input from the\nlegendary John Romita, Sr.) made use of the climax of Carol\u2019s <i>Captain Marvel</i> run to craft her new\npersona.</p><p>As was\nstandard practice at the time, new female characters were often based on\nexisting male heroes. So Ms. Marvel was closely related to Captain Marvel, with\nsimilar powers that literally came from him (the radiation filtered through his\nbody as he tried to shield Carol), a costume derived from his, and even an echo\non the situation where he was forced to \u201cshare\u201d a body with another character.\nThe Carol/Ms. Marvel dichotomy also famously tracked a key element of one of\nMarvel\u2019s marquee characters, the Hulk (especially Carol\u2019s lack of control over\nher transformations and a somewhat antagonistic attitude toward her alter ego).\nMarvel went a step further, borrowing the Spider-Man set-up of Carol working\nfor Jonah, who had a grudge against her heroic alter ego (Peter Parker and Mary\nJane Watson turned up early on, with MJ being an initial part of the supporting\ncast).</p><p>It was a\nsolid set-up, though Conway dropped out fairly early on and turned the reins\nover to Chris Claremont, then the writer of Marvel\u2019s hottest book, <i>Uncanny X-Men</i>. Claremont did a nice job\nof developing Carol and dramatizing her struggle to understand and cope with\nher heroic alter ego.

Her Ms. Marvel powers were as often a hindrance to Carol&rsquo;s\nlife as they were an asset and Carol&rsquo;s struggle to integrate her two halves was\na key part of the first year of stories.</p><p>Claremont\nwisely moved away from the borrowed Spider-Man characters (MJ disappeared\nwithout comment after a couple of issues and Jonah transitioned into an\noften-unseen background presence), in favor of developing Carol&rsquo;s own\nsupporting cast. That included her co-workers and an array of friends, former\ncolleagues and relatives, as well as a problematic love interest in her\npsychiatrist. The debut of Deathbird should be of significant interest to\nlong-time fans, as Claremont would later successfully transplant her to <i>Uncanny X-Men</i> and develop her into a\nmajor villain. Claremont did an effective job with Carol, making her\nstrong-willed, but also flawed. She was interesting, imperfect and actually\nwent through a learning curve of figuring out how to be an effective hero.</p><p>The art side\nboasted a cadre of familiar Marvel Bullpen names that ensured that <i>Ms. Marvel</i> was done very much in the\ncompany&rsquo;s well-known &ldquo;house&rdquo; style. John &amp; Sal Buscema, Joe Sinnott, Jim\nMooney, Keith Pollard, Carmine Infantino, Dave Cockrum, Steve Leialoha and\nothers contributed to the usual set-up, with a dramatic splash page followed by\ntightly-packed panels that kept the action moving briskly throughout. With\nClaremont&rsquo;s imaginative plotting and strong characterization, it was a state of\nthe art Marvel book for its time, boasting all the usual tics (copious\nflashbacks, recaps and expository dialogue) that current fans often find\ncharming and frustrating in equal doses. Of note, superstar artist John Byrne\nhandled the pencils for the Spider-Man/Ms. Marvel team-up, bringing to the mix his\nwell-known fluidity, creativity and way of pushing the limits of the page\nlayouts typical of the time.</p><p>As an\nexploration of feminism, these early <i>Ms.\nMarvel</i> stories were a mixed bag. The series was on firmer ground when they\nshowed instead of told, so that both Carol and Ms. Marvel were strong,\nintelligent women who were succeeding in male-dominated arenas. Just presenting\na successful woman as though it were normal was the best aspect of the book&rsquo;s\nexploration of feminism. Unfortunately, a lot of the rest of the time, the book&rsquo;s\nhandling of the topic could be rather shallow, when it remembered to tackle it\nat all. That could range from simplistic Women&rsquo;s Studies 101 moments, like\nCarol instructing someone to call her &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; or overly broad\nsituations like random extras goggling that the fights Ms. Marvel tackled weren&rsquo;t\nappropriate &ldquo;for a girl.&rdquo; Jonah was an overly obvious strawman, demanding the\nmagazine run articles on fashion, recipes and diets, while Carol fought for\narticles of substance. Potentially more interesting was Carol&rsquo;s relationship\nwith her chauvinistic construction worker father, introduced near the end of\nthe run collected here. Claremont teased at that tension, but it would be left\nto writers many years down the road to more fully explore Carol&rsquo;s problematic\nrelationship with her father. Tellingly, for a series with a female lead that\nintended to explore feminist ideas, the book had only three female creators\ninvolved, all as colorists (including the legendary Marie Severin, who would\nhave made an excellent primary artist for the series, had anyone at the time\nbothered to think about it).</p><p>The biggest\nproblem that <i>Ms. Marvel</i> faced in\nestablishing its feminist bonafides was the character&rsquo;s visual presentation.\nBecause leave it to a bunch of &lsquo;70s comic book men to produce a &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; book\nthat presented its lead wearing hot pants, with bare legs and a top that was\nboth backless and midriff-baring. That overly sexualized early look was\nmoderated after a few issues, with Ms. Marvel at least getting a full shirt.</p><p>\n\nDespite a few missteps,&nbsp;<i>Ms. Marvel: This Woman, This Warrior&nbsp;</i>is an enjoyable collection\nwith involving stories and good character work that showcase the early costumed\nadventures of a character that has in recent years developed into one of Marvel&rsquo;s\nA-list properties.</p>",
