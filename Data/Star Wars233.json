He wasn\u2019t as fragile as Bail seemed to\nthink he was. But communication, communication, communication, Bail liked to\nrepeat, and as Obi-Wan\u2019s experience in sex and love before Bail and Breha had\nentered his life had been sparse, and frankly better not thought about, he was\nin the habit to defer to Bail\u2019s opinion on the subject of communication. </p><p>He still grumbled\nabout it. </p><p>He had been a\nlittle surprised about the multitude of possibilities Bail had unveiled for him\nduring their conversation. </p><p>Position, ok, he\ncould have thought about different positions for a good spanking. But the rest?\nWhen sometimes, when he was tired and less on guard and touching himself, he\nhad thought about it, it had always been Bail\u2019s hands, larges, strong. He had\nnever even thought people could use objects. Bail had searched paddles on the\nholonets, and then spanking bench, to let him see how they looked and it had\nbeen a long time since Obi-Wan had blushed so much. Bail hadn\u2019t laughed, just\nkissed him tenderly. </p><p>Bail never\nlaughed. </p><p>He had encouraged\nhim to take the subject with Breha. </p><p>\u201cBut you said she\ndidn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t. But\nthat doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t be an excellent advisor. And even if we try it, you\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019ll like it or not, like her. And it will be totally ok.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan had brooded\nover the subject for a few days, gone to Breha, then brooded a little more. </p><p>\u201cI want to try it,\u201d\nhe had said one evening to Bail. Breha wasn\u2019t home and wouldn\u2019t be for three\ndays more. The perfect moment to play with things that didn\u2019t interest her,\nlike Obi-Wan and Breha played with bondage when Bail wasn\u2019t there. </p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Bail\nasked, as calm as ever, which Obi-Wan found a little infuriating. </p><p>Obi-Wan nodded. </p><p>He saw Bail\nobserving him. He thought the other man would say something about Obi-Wan\u2019s\nobvious tension, but Bail only pulled him on his lap and kissed him. </p><p>That Obi-Wan knew\nhow to do. Bail\u2019s kisses were poems and he lost himself in them, letting the\nspark of anxiety fade. The scratch of their beards, the warmth between them,\nthe dance of their lips\u2026Bail\u2019s hands were caressing his back, his neck, and\ntension fled a little more. </p><p>Obi-Wan didn\u2019t\nprotest when his lover put him flat on his back on the sofa, like he weighted\nnothing. He adored how strong Bail was, and how he would never abuse that strength.\nThe Senator opened his tunic, covered his torso in kisses and Obi-Wan soon was\nkeening, his pants opened, his hands buried in Bail\u2019s hair, as his lover\nswallowed him down. </p><p>Orgasm came quick\nand Bail definitely looked smug about that, but Obi-Wan couldn\u2019t be annoyed\nwith him for a good orgasm! </p><p>\u201cNo spanking?\u201d He\nstill asked, because he wasn\u2019t on the habit to let anything go that easily. Also,\nhe suspected that had been a ploy to help him shed his tension about the\nsubject. </p><p>Bail kissed him\nquick. </p><p>\u201cOh yes, if you\u2019re\nstill interested. Let me make an offer. A shower, you and me. I want more to\ncome against your backside that to put colour on it right now. Then, if you\u2019re\nnot too tired\u2026Something simple. We\u2019ll see roleplay or more advanced ideas if\nyou like it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal!!\u201d</p><p>And, strangely,\nnow Obi-Wan was eager for it. It was Bail, why would he be nervous? </p><p>Bail would never\ngive him more than Obi-Wan could take. </p><p>He fondled Bail\u2019s\nerection in the shower, caressed him, played with him, whispering all the\nthings he never dare to say outside of the noises of water right into his ear,\nsharing playful kisses and the shivers he felt when his lover crowned him\nagainst the wall of the shower just before coming were anticipatory. He felt\nsmall, deliciously vulnerable, against Bail\u2019s tall mass, and he adored it. </p><p>When they were\ndry, Bail put some pants before sitting down on the bed, surprising him. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try it that\nway. You like when I take you still dressed and you naked, no? I suspect it\nwill be the same. Do you want to put something? Some underwear, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan hesitated,\nthen naked, he draped himself over Bail\u2019s knees. </p><p>A large hand immediately\nwent to caress his back, like he was a spooked animal. </p><p>\u201cRemember, the\nsecond you want it to stop, it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you\ncall me naughty, instead of reassuring me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo role play,\ndear heart. A few sessions later, perhaps, if that interest you. I want to <i>share</i> that with you, not\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d\nObi-Wan said. It was rare he put it in words, and he even more rarely said it\nin bed, but how could he express in any other ways how he adored this man. </p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d\nBail answered and Obi-Wan heard his smile. </p><p>Bail caressed his\nback a little more, his ass, his hips, the caress light and gentle\u2026.</p><p>\u201cI will go gentle\non the beginning, and then harder,\u201d he warned, \u201cand I will count and stop at\nfifteen. If you squirm, I will stop. There is no risk I could hurt you with\njust my hand, going slowly and nicely like that, but no reason good habits can\u2019t\nstart from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>The first smack resonated\nin the room. Obi-Wan had knew it would come, of course, but it was still some\nshock. Bail had aimed on the more round part of his ass and when Obi-Wan was\nstill trying to think what to thought, he doubled down on the same place. </p><p>Obi-Wan\u2019s heart\nstarted to beat wildly and he realized his mouth was open. </p><p>Another smack, on\nthe other cheek. Another. </p><p>\u201cFour\u2019, Bail was\ncounting, and Obi-Wan realized he had totally missed the first three counts. </p><p>Bail alternated\nbetween the cheeks and the crease of his thigh. By eight, Obi-Wan was panting,\nrocking with the impact. </p><p>At ten, Bail\nstopped and Obi-Wan squirmed, mewling in protest. Everything felt\u2026more. The texture\nof his lover\u2019s pants against his skin was almost too much. Bail had a shhh\nnoise, caressed the skin and it tingled and it felt warm, Obi-Wan was sure he\nwas red right there. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing perfectly\u201d,\nBail said, \u201cJust five more. You\u2019re doing so well, darling.\u201d</p><p>His hand came down\nagain, harder this time. Obi-Wan yelped. Bail didn\u2019t stop. The sound of flesh\nagainst flesh and the numbers Bail counted made perfect counterpoints to\nObi-Wan\u2019s noises. </p><p>At fifteen,\nObi-Wan gulped air. It was\u2026it was really not as he had thought it would be.\nBail helped him on the bed and Obi-Wan latched on him like some demented\noctopus. </p><p>Bail kissed his\nbrow, his cheeks, his lips. </p><p>\u201cShhh, shh,\nperfect, dear, love, shh\u2026\u201d </p><p>Obi-Wan realized\nhe was half hard. Usually, he needed more time for that. He whined and Bail\nunderstood immediately, palmed his cock. </p><p>\u201cJust a minute\u2026\u201d</p><p>Bail turned a\nlittle, there was some click, then the odour of lube that he smeared down\nObi-Wan\u2019s shaft, and then he made him come efficiently, Obi-Wan mewling in\ntheir kisses. </p><p>Bail gave him a\nfew minutes of cuddling, then insisted for Obi-Wan to sit. </p><p>The Jedi yelped\nand immediately glared at him. </p><p>\u201cSurprised, love?\u201d\nBail kissed his brow then took the glass of the water on the nightstand. </p><p>\u201cI have some cream\nfor that if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps tomorrow\nmorning.

And it will be totally ok.\u201d</p><p>Obi-Wan had brooded\nover the subject for a few days, gone to Breha, then brooded a little more. </p><p>\u201cI want to try it,\u201d\nhe had said one evening to Bail. Breha wasn\u2019t home and wouldn\u2019t be for three\ndays more. The perfect moment to play with things that didn\u2019t interest her,\nlike Obi-Wan and Breha played with bondage when Bail wasn\u2019t there. </p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Bail\nasked, as calm as ever, which Obi-Wan found a little infuriating. </p><p>Obi-Wan nodded. </p><p>He saw Bail\nobserving him. He thought the other man would say something about Obi-Wan\u2019s\nobvious tension, but Bail only pulled him on his lap and kissed him. </p><p>That Obi-Wan knew\nhow to do. Bail\u2019s kisses were poems and he lost himself in them, letting the\nspark of anxiety fade. The scratch of their beards, the warmth between them,\nthe dance of their lips\u2026Bail\u2019s hands were caressing his back, his neck, and\ntension fled a little more. </p><p>Obi-Wan didn\u2019t\nprotest when his lover put him flat on his back on the sofa, like he weighted\nnothing.

Also,\nhe suspected that had been a ploy to help him shed his tension about the\nsubject. </p><p>Bail kissed him\nquick. </p><p>\u201cOh yes, if you\u2019re\nstill interested. Let me make an offer. A shower, you and me. I want more to\ncome against your backside that to put colour on it right now. Then, if you\u2019re\nnot too tired\u2026Something simple.

It was Bail, why would he be nervous? </p><p>Bail would never\ngive him more than Obi-Wan could take. </p><p>He fondled Bail\u2019s\nerection in the shower, caressed him, played with him, whispering all the\nthings he never dare to say outside of the noises of water right into his ear,\nsharing playful kisses and the shivers he felt when his lover crowned him\nagainst the wall of the shower just before coming were anticipatory. He felt\nsmall, deliciously vulnerable, against Bail\u2019s tall mass, and he adored it. </p><p>When they were\ndry, Bail put some pants before sitting down on the bed, surprising him. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try it that\nway.

A few sessions later, perhaps, if that interest you. I want to <i>share</i> that with you, not\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d\nObi-Wan said. It was rare he put it in words, and he even more rarely said it\nin bed, but how could he express in any other ways how he adored this man. </p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d\nBail answered and Obi-Wan heard his smile. </p><p>Bail caressed his\nback a little more, his ass, his hips, the caress light and gentle\u2026.</p><p>\u201cI will go gentle\non the beginning, and then harder,\u201d he warned, \u201cand I will count and stop at\nfifteen. If you squirm, I will stop. There is no risk I could hurt you with\njust my hand, going slowly and nicely like that, but no reason good habits can\u2019t\nstart from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>The first smack resonated\nin the room. Obi-Wan had knew it would come, of course, but it was still some\nshock. Bail had aimed on the more round part of his ass and when Obi-Wan was\nstill trying to think what to thought, he doubled down on the same place. </p><p>Obi-Wan\u2019s heart\nstarted to beat wildly and he realized his mouth was open. </p><p>Another smack, on\nthe other cheek. Another. </p><p>\u201cFour\u2019, Bail was\ncounting, and Obi-Wan realized he had totally missed the first three counts. </p><p>Bail alternated\nbetween the cheeks and the crease of his thigh. By eight, Obi-Wan was panting,\nrocking with the impact. </p><p>At ten, Bail\nstopped and Obi-Wan squirmed, mewling in protest. Everything felt\u2026more. The texture\nof his lover\u2019s pants against his skin was almost too much. Bail had a shhh\nnoise, caressed the skin and it tingled and it felt warm, Obi-Wan was sure he\nwas red right there. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing perfectly\u201d,\nBail said, \u201cJust five more.

                "content": "<p>Under the cut A little spanking story for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWRebAf5j11feUKxo5CzhZw\">@nyelung</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Even if it&rsquo;s explicit, it&rsquo;s probably the fluffiest thing I have written in a while ^^&nbsp; I imagine them so in love!&nbsp;</p><p>They had talked\nabout it so much Obi-Wan was almost sick of the idea. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t\nunderstood what all the fuss was about. He wasn&rsquo;t as fragile as Bail seemed to\nthink he was. But communication, communication, communication, Bail liked to\nrepeat, and as Obi-Wan&rsquo;s experience in sex and love before Bail and Breha had\nentered his life had been sparse, and frankly better not thought about, he was\nin the habit to defer to Bail&rsquo;s opinion on the subject of communication. </p><p>He still grumbled\nabout it. </p><p>He had been a\nlittle surprised about the multitude of possibilities Bail had unveiled for him\nduring their conversation. </p><p>Position, ok, he\ncould have thought about different positions for a good spanking. But the rest?\nWhen sometimes, when he was tired and less on guard and touching himself, he\nhad thought about it, it had always been Bail&rsquo;s hands, larges, strong. He had\nnever even thought people could use objects. Bail had searched paddles on the\nholonets, and then spanking bench, to let him see how they looked and it had\nbeen a long time since Obi-Wan had blushed so much. Bail hadn&rsquo;t laughed, just\nkissed him tenderly. </p><p>Bail never\nlaughed. </p><p>He had encouraged\nhim to take the subject with Breha. </p><p>&ldquo;But you said she\ndidn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t. But\nthat doesn&rsquo;t mean she can&rsquo;t be an excellent advisor. And even if we try it, you\ndon&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ll like it or not, like her. And it will be totally ok.&rdquo;</p><p>Obi-Wan had brooded\nover the subject for a few days, gone to Breha, then brooded a little more. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to try it,&rdquo;\nhe had said one evening to Bail. Breha wasn&rsquo;t home and wouldn&rsquo;t be for three\ndays more. The perfect moment to play with things that didn&rsquo;t interest her,\nlike Obi-Wan and Breha played with bondage when Bail wasn&rsquo;t there. </p><p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Bail\nasked, as calm as ever, which Obi-Wan found a little infuriating. </p><p>Obi-Wan nodded. </p><p>He saw Bail\nobserving him. He thought the other man would say something about Obi-Wan&rsquo;s\nobvious tension, but Bail only pulled him on his lap and kissed him. </p><p>That Obi-Wan knew\nhow to do. Bail&rsquo;s kisses were poems and he lost himself in them, letting the\nspark of anxiety fade. The scratch of their beards, the warmth between them,\nthe dance of their lips&hellip;Bail&rsquo;s hands were caressing his back, his neck, and\ntension fled a little more. </p><p>Obi-Wan didn&rsquo;t\nprotest when his lover put him flat on his back on the sofa, like he weighted\nnothing. He adored how strong Bail was, and how he would never abuse that strength.\nThe Senator opened his tunic, covered his torso in kisses and Obi-Wan soon was\nkeening, his pants opened, his hands buried in Bail&rsquo;s hair, as his lover\nswallowed him down. </p><p>Orgasm came quick\nand Bail definitely looked smug about that, but Obi-Wan couldn&rsquo;t be annoyed\nwith him for a good orgasm! </p><p>&ldquo;No spanking?&rdquo; He\nstill asked, because he wasn&rsquo;t on the habit to let anything go that easily. Also,\nhe suspected that had been a ploy to help him shed his tension about the\nsubject. </p><p>Bail kissed him\nquick. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, if you&rsquo;re\nstill interested. Let me make an offer. A shower, you and me. I want more to\ncome against your backside that to put colour on it right now. Then, if you&rsquo;re\nnot too tired&hellip;Something simple. We&rsquo;ll see roleplay or more advanced ideas if\nyou like it like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Deal!!&rdquo;</p><p>And, strangely,\nnow Obi-Wan was eager for it. It was Bail, why would he be nervous? </p><p>Bail would never\ngive him more than Obi-Wan could take. </p><p>He fondled Bail&rsquo;s\nerection in the shower, caressed him, played with him, whispering all the\nthings he never dare to say outside of the noises of water right into his ear,\nsharing playful kisses and the shivers he felt when his lover crowned him\nagainst the wall of the shower just before coming were anticipatory. He felt\nsmall, deliciously vulnerable, against Bail&rsquo;s tall mass, and he adored it. </p><p>When they were\ndry, Bail put some pants before sitting down on the bed, surprising him. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it that\nway. You like when I take you still dressed and you naked, no? I suspect it\nwill be the same. Do you want to put something? Some underwear, perhaps.&rdquo;</p><p>Obi-Wan hesitated,\nthen naked, he draped himself over Bail&rsquo;s knees. </p><p>A large hand immediately\nwent to caress his back, like he was a spooked animal. </p><p>&ldquo;Remember, the\nsecond you want it to stop, it does.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you\ncall me naughty, instead of reassuring me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No role play,\ndear heart. A few sessions later, perhaps, if that interest you. I want to <i>share</i> that with you, not&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;\nObi-Wan said. It was rare he put it in words, and he even more rarely said it\nin bed, but how could he express in any other ways how he adored this man. </p><p>&ldquo;And I love you,&rdquo;\nBail answered and Obi-Wan heard his smile. </p><p>Bail caressed his\nback a little more, his ass, his hips, the caress light and gentle&hellip;.</p><p>&ldquo;I will go gentle\non the beginning, and then harder,&rdquo; he warned, &ldquo;and I will count and stop at\nfifteen. If you squirm, I will stop. There is no risk I could hurt you with\njust my hand, going slowly and nicely like that, but no reason good habits can&rsquo;t\nstart from the beginning.&rdquo;</p><p>The first smack resonated\nin the room. Obi-Wan had knew it would come, of course, but it was still some\nshock. Bail had aimed on the more round part of his ass and when Obi-Wan was\nstill trying to think what to thought, he doubled down on the same place. </p><p>Obi-Wan&rsquo;s heart\nstarted to beat wildly and he realized his mouth was open. </p><p>Another smack, on\nthe other cheek. Another. </p><p>&ldquo;Four&rsquo;, Bail was\ncounting, and Obi-Wan realized he had totally missed the first three counts. </p><p>Bail alternated\nbetween the cheeks and the crease of his thigh. By eight, Obi-Wan was panting,\nrocking with the impact. </p><p>At ten, Bail\nstopped and Obi-Wan squirmed, mewling in protest. Everything felt&hellip;more. The texture\nof his lover&rsquo;s pants against his skin was almost too much. Bail had a shhh\nnoise, caressed the skin and it tingled and it felt warm, Obi-Wan was sure he\nwas red right there. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing perfectly&rdquo;,\nBail said, &ldquo;Just five more. You&rsquo;re doing so well, darling.&rdquo;</p><p>His hand came down\nagain, harder this time. Obi-Wan yelped. Bail didn&rsquo;t stop. The sound of flesh\nagainst flesh and the numbers Bail counted made perfect counterpoints to\nObi-Wan&rsquo;s noises. </p><p>At fifteen,\nObi-Wan gulped air. It was&hellip;it was really not as he had thought it would be.\nBail helped him on the bed and Obi-Wan latched on him like some demented\noctopus. </p><p>Bail kissed his\nbrow, his cheeks, his lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Shhh, shh,\nperfect, dear, love, shh&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Obi-Wan realized\nhe was half hard. Usually, he needed more time for that. He whined and Bail\nunderstood immediately, palmed his cock. </p><p>&ldquo;Just a minute&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Bail turned a\nlittle, there was some click, then the odour of lube that he smeared down\nObi-Wan&rsquo;s shaft, and then he made him come efficiently, Obi-Wan mewling in\ntheir kisses. </p><p>Bail gave him a\nfew minutes of cuddling, then insisted for Obi-Wan to sit. </p><p>The Jedi yelped\nand immediately glared at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Surprised, love?&rdquo;\nBail kissed his brow then took the glass of the water on the nightstand. </p><p>&ldquo;I have some cream\nfor that if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow\nmorning. I have too much meetings. But not right now&hellip;I want&hellip;I want to feel it a\nlittle more.&rdquo;</p><p>He sipped his\nwater, observing his lover. He didn&rsquo;t find words to explain to Bail what he had\nthought of the experience, but the other man didn&rsquo;t push. A good thing, Obi-Wan\nprobably couldn&rsquo;t negotiate his way out of a flimsy bag in that instant. </p><p>When the Jedi had\ndrunk the whole glass, Bail nudged him until Obi-wan was under the sheet,\nplastered again Bail, his head on a strong shoulder. </p><p>Bail kissed his\nhair. </p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo;\nObi-Wan said. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly\nabout coming for me. And as beautiful and trusting as you were, I had come not\neven twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;</p><p>Obi-Wan would have\nasked another question, but a yawn surprised him. Chronic insomniac as he was,\nhe had never felt more ready for sleep. </p><p>&ldquo;I think I liked\nit,&rdquo; he said in the dark of the bedroom. Bail kissed his hair again.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about\nit again later, my dear heart. Think you can sleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For a week.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; </p>",
