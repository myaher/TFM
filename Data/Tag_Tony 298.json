He&rsquo;d never expected to find himself snuggling with a Frost Giant to prevent his body from overheating.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/13623420\">[read on ao3]</a></p><p>They\u2019re trapped. For real, this time \u2013 the door is shut, and they don\u2019t have the force to get it open. There aren\u2019t any windows, and the walls are too thick and made of steel. Even if Tony\u2019s suit was operational at the moment \u2013 and thanks to the decidedly effective variant of an EMP that he got shot with, it isn\u2019t \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be a way to get out of the room.<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2019I thought you said your suit could withstand devices such as these,\u2019\u2019 Loki drawls beside him, seemingly unimpressed.</p><p>Tony inspects his suit one last time, but gets up as it becomes apparent that the power won\u2019t restart. The arc reactor is strong enough to be undamaged, but that won\u2019t be much of a help if the rest of the suit is not working. The reactor can\u2019t function on its own.</p><p>\u2018\u2019They must\u2019ve made some alterations,\u2019\u2019 Tony says. Being stuck with Loki isn\u2019t the worse thing, but he does hope the rest of the team will be able to take down the bad guy with them unavailable. They\u2019re efficient, sure, but Iron Man is a very helpful team member, and Loki\u2019s magic has proven itself unbelievably valuable during missions.</p><p>Okay, there are some downsides to being stuck with Loki. The most important one is that Tony has been crushing on his teammate since forever and Loki being Loki, it\u2019s probably not going to be very long until he finds it out.</p><!-- more --><p>Another one is that Tony tends to say the wrong thing around Loki. He will never forget the time he called Loki \u2018princess\u2019 and found himself pinned to the wall. It\u2019s just \u2013 they seem to argue more often than not. Tony doesn\u2019t mean any of it, and it\u2019s fun for a while, but then Loki seems to take it personal.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I am afraid it is time we admit defeat and wait for a rescue party,\u2019\u2019 Loki says. \u2018\u2019It will be impossible to get through these walls. Perhaps the Hulk could, if he deemed it necessary.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Hulk doesn\u2019t need an excuse to smash,\u2019\u2019 Tony quips.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I am well aware.\u2019\u2019 Loki\u2019s tone is a bit dry, and Tony is never sure if he means it or not. He thinks Loki is just joking with him, but Tony finds it kind of hard to figure him out sometimes.</p><p>They\u2019re sitting beside each other for some time, just waiting it out. It\u2019s not the first time someone in the team got stuck somewhere, and there\u2019s not much reason for panic. The villain they\u2019re fighting is minor, and their being stuck here merely an inconvenience.</p><p>But then Tony starts sweating. \u2018\u2019Do you think it\u2019s hot in here?\u2019\u2019 he asks Loki, who has a pensive look on his face.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I think they\u2019re turning up the heat,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, swiftly standing up. \u2018\u2019Perhaps they mean to weaken us without facing us directly.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony isn\u2019t bothered by the heat. He thinks about the cave in Afghanistan for a second, but it was mainly the cold, there, that got to him. The cold would maybe trigger him, but the heat \u2013 that will only be a discomfort, at most.</p><p>Until it gets hotter, and hotter. \u2018\u2019That\u2019s it,\u2019\u2019 Tony decides, after wiping the sweat from his brow once again. \u2018\u2019I\u2019m going to strip.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a sight to behold,\u2019\u2019 Loki says.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Darling, if you wanted me naked, all you had to do was ask.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Well, this is more fun.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony shoots Loki a glance. The god seems unperturbed by the heat. Maybe he can handle more of it, Tony wouldn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s obvious that Loki isn\u2019t as affected as Tony is.</p><p>First he takes off his shirt. He can feel Loki eyeing his back as he throws the garb on the floor. He was in the lab when the alarm went off, so he\u2019s still wearing his oil-stained pants, which he also takes off, until he\u2019s only wearing his socks and his underwear. After a split second, he also decided to get rid of the socks.</p><p>It works for a while. But the heat gets oppressing, and Tony has to close his eyes so the world will stop swinging. He\u2019s sweating profusely, and his dizziness makes his nausea only worse.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Stark.\u2019\u2019 Someone is holding him by the shoulders. Sitting up is a task too hard for Tony, right now. \u2018\u2019Stark, are you with me? Stark!\u2019\u2019</p><p>Oh yeah, it\u2019s Loki. Tony manages to open his eyes. There is more than one Loki in front of him. There\u2019s some sweat on his brow, but he seems to be holding up against the heat far more effectually than Tony is.</p><p>His head is aching, and thinking seems to be impossible. \u2018\u2019Loki,\u2019\u2019 he manages to say, holding onto the god\u2019s arm. It\u2019s impossible to hold himself up.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Did you hear what I was saying? Stark?\u2019\u2019 Loki sounds worried. Tony wonders what\u2019s going on, because he doesn\u2019t hear Loki like that very often. Loki seems above these human emotions, always composed and ready for everything the world will throw at him. Tony admires that, as someone who always has to appear composed too. He\u2019s a Stark, and that brings expectations with it.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You\u2019re not well,\u2019\u2019 Loki states. \u2018\u2019You are overheating, Tony. Do you understand me?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki is really very attractive. He\u2019s also very strong, Tony thinks as he pinches Loki\u2019s arms. Since when is he lying in Loki\u2019s arms?</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m going to take that as a no,\u2019\u2019 Loki states. \u2018\u2019You\u2019re truly out of it, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Very, very nice biceps. Tony didn\u2019t know that there were two of Loki. Double the fun. Maybe also double the arguing, though, and Tony doesn\u2019t want to fight with Loki. He wants to kiss him. Maybe double the kisses?</p><p>But two times none is still zero.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Well, there is nothing wrong with your calculations, at least,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, and he moves to lay Tony down on the floor. Tony makes a noise. He doesn\u2019t want Loki to leave.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m not leaving,\u2019\u2019 Loki tells him. A few moments later, he is unclothed with the exception of his briefs, his skin blue, and his eyes are red. Not a sliver of the green is left. Tony can only stare, until the god lies down next to him. He\u2019s cool, and Tony clutches at him.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Relax,\u2019\u2019 Loki murmurs. \u2018\u2019This will allow you to hold out a bit longer. Until we are rescued, alright? I know it\u2019s not perfect, but you will die if I don\u2019t.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony can\u2019t help but cuddle into Loki\u2019s arms. The cold of Loki\u2019s body makes the heat a bit more bearable, and he stares at the markings on the god\u2019s bare chest. He has never seen him like this, but he\u2019s equally certain he\u2019s never seen anything more beautiful.</p><p>Loki turns his face against Tony\u2019s cheek, and Tony presses into Loki\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I only hope we will last like this until they come,\u2019\u2019 he hears Loki whisper. Then Tony falls asleep in the cool of Loki\u2019s embrace.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Tony wakes up with a giant headache.</p><p>He makes the mistake of opening his eyes and is blinded by the light. \u2018\u2019Lights off,\u2019\u2019 he moans, trying to cover his head with his blanket. His muscles are aching, too, and not in a pleasant way.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Not even you can find a way to turn off the sun, Tony,\u2019\u2019 he hears an amused voice beside him. Pepper is sitting there. Tony can\u2019t find it in himself to be surprised.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You know I could find a way, if I tried hard enough.\u2019\u2019 He tries sitting up, and Pepper helps him.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You had us scared there, for a moment,\u2019\u2019 Pepper tells him, and Tony searches his memories for what he\u2019s done now. However, he comes up with nothing.</p><p>She seems to notice his confused look. \u2018\u2019You were overheating. The doctors say you wouldn\u2019t have made it, if it wasn\u2019t for Loki.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t remember any of it, except \u2013 maybe a bit. He remembers Loki being stuck with him, but he doesn\u2019t know what happened after that. He thinks he lay in Loki\u2019s arms, but he\u2019s hardly going to ask Pepper about that. In any case, it\u2019s improbable that she even knows what exactly happened.</p><p>\u2018\u2019What about Loki?\u2019\u2019 he asks.</p><p>Pepper shrugs. \u2018\u2019Still on bed rest, and bitching about it, I heard. There\u2019s something about him being a Frost Giant, or something like that, and apparently it made him more vulnerable to the heat than being a regular god. I didn\u2019t ask for details.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki, a Frost Giant. Okay, well, Tony knew Loki is adopted, and isn\u2019t a regular Asgardian, but he hadn\u2019t thought much more about it. \u2018\u2019Can I see him?\u2019\u2019 Tony asks.</p><p>Pepper hesitates for a moment. \u2018\u2019There\u2019s something else you should know. The room was being recorded, apparently, and the Avengers saw the video of the two of you there. Tony, do you \u2013 are you in love with Loki?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Um,\u2019\u2019 Tony says.</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s okay if you are,\u2019\u2019 Pepper adds, \u2018\u2019I mean, I\u2019m rooting for you, Tony, really. But if I were you, I\u2019d prepare yourself for everyone knowing about it.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Including Loki?\u2019\u2019 Tony asks. Because that won\u2019t make it Tony\u2019s crush more awkward than it already is.</p><p>Pepper smiles tightly. \u2018\u2019Including Loki.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony lets his head fall back on the pillow. He\u2019s doomed.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It takes him a few days to get back to his usual strength, and in those days, he doesn\u2019t see Loki even once.</p><p>The other Avengers tease him about liking the god, but aren\u2019t worried, because Loki has been part of their team for long enough that there\u2019s at least some trust between them and their old enemy-turned-ally. Even Thor doesn\u2019t seem bothered by it, and when Tony asks him why, Thor says that Loki is more than capable of taking care of himself.</p><p>Tony supposes that\u2019s true.</p><p>He tries to find Loki, but every time he comes even close to the god, Loki disappears. Tony tries not to take it as a hint, and thinks that maybe he\u2019s said or done something weird during their time stuck together, so he finally goes to see the video.</p><p>And \u2013 well, okay. He\u2019s blatantly told Loki, in his stupid overheated state, that he basically thinks Loki is the best thing on Earth, or any other planet, as it may be. But besides that \u2013 it\u2019s not like he has insulted him, or done something spectacularly stupid, except being his usual brand of Tony Stark.</p><p>It\u2019s still stupidly hot to see Loki turn to his Frost Giant form, though, and Tony may secretly have taken a few screenshots. He and Loki are blatantly cuddling by the end of the video. He\u2019s touched that Loki gave up his Asgardian physique, that protected him from the heat, to give Tony the cold he needed and thus putting himself at risk.</p><p>But seeing as Loki is avoiding him now, that was nothing more than a teammate helping him out of a life-threatening situation, like they do on a daily basis. He has to forget about Loki cuddling up to him, and accept that the god is giving him a clear hint that he doesn\u2019t want Tony.</p><p>Tony can\u2019t exactly blame him.</p><p>He stops trying to go and see Loki, and focuses on other things, instead. Like figuring out what kind of EMP those bad guys had used to override his suit. It\u2019s obviously a more fruitful endeavour.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It\u2019s Loki that comes to find him, in the end.</p><p>Tony is so surprised that he nearly drops the device he\u2019s using to weld some parts of his suits together.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Careful with that,\u2019\u2019 Loki advices him. \u2018\u2019I think we\u2019ve both dealt with enough heat, for the foreseeable future.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Tell me about it,\u2019\u2019 Tony answers easily, even if his heartbeat is much faster than usual. He removes his goggles, and walks away from the suit, to Loki. \u2018\u2019What, um. Can I help you with something?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki gives a fleeting smile, as if he\u2019s nervous about something, and looks away for a second before focusing on Tony again. \u2018\u2019I had a question, actually.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Shoot away,\u2019\u2019 Tony says, with a wave of his hand.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Are you in love with me?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony blinks. \u2018\u2019Except for that, holy shit,\u2019\u2019 he manages. \u2018\u2019Weren\u2019t you the subtle one on this team? I thought, um, I thought the answer to that was pretty clear. Considering my apparent inability to keep my mouth shut when overheating.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki shrugs. \u2018\u2019I did not mean to take whatever you said in that state too seriously. You were pretty far gone, honestly.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Yeah.\u2019\u2019 Tony coughs. \u2018\u2019I never got to thank you for saving me. But, as to your question, I, um, watched the video. Pretty much all I said can be taken seriously. So. There\u2019s that.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki takes a step forward, near Tony, tilting his head. He\u2019s looking at Tony as if trying to figure out a particularly hard problem. \u2018\u2019And do you still feel the same way?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s been a week, Loki, seriously, give me some time,\u2019\u2019 Tony says. Loki is probably here to figure out how fast Tony can get over this. He\u2019s crushing pretty hard on the god, actually, so it may take a bit longer than he wants to admit to himself.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I don\u2019t mean to,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, and then they\u2019re crashing into each other. Loki is cupping Tony\u2019s head with his right hand, pressing their lips together. Tony can do nothing but kiss back, even as his mind goes blank.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how long they stand like this, but when they break apart, he finds his own hands on Loki\u2019s waist, pressing him closer, and Loki\u2019s other hand on the small of Tony\u2019s back, under his shirt.</p><p>\u2018\u2019What?\u2019\u2019 Tony says.</p><p>Loki huffs out a laugh. \u2018\u2019You do want this, am I right?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I do, but you don\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 Tony points out, taking a step back, getting away from Loki. \u2018\u2019You\u2019ve been avoiding me ever since being stuck together, when you saved my life at the risk of your own, and then you come and do that? You can see how I have a little trouble figuring this out, can\u2019t you?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Tony,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, and taking a step forward so they\u2019re just as close again. \u2018\u2019This is not a trick. I am being honest with you, believe me. It\u2019s just \u2013 not many people have seen me as a Frost Giant, before. They\u2019re monsters. I knew I had to do it, when you were overheating, you wouldn\u2019t have made it much longer. But when you saw me \u2013 you were afraid. Your eyes were so wide, and you didn\u2019t say anything. I was afraid that you\u2019d be disgusted, after seeing me like that. But hearing you still feel the same \u2013 I do want this. You have to believe me.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I wasn\u2019t afraid,\u2019\u2019 Tony says, dumbfounded. \u2018\u2019Shit, Loki, I was awed. The only thing I could think about is how beautiful you are, like that. I mean, you are now, too, but that \u2013 that was breath-taking. Don\u2019t you see? I wasn\u2019t afraid.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m a monster,\u2019\u2019 Loki says. \u2018\u2019There\u2019s nothing beautiful about that.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Can you\u2026\u2019\u2019 Tony hesitates for a second. \u2018\u2019Can you turn, now? For me?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki gives him an indecipherable look, but his face starts turning blue, and his eyes red. The marking are all over his body, and Tony lays his hand on Loki\u2019s face, tenderly. For a moment, neither of them move, and then Tony lets out a deep breath and smiles.</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s beautiful,\u2019\u2019 he says simply. \u2018\u2019You\u2019re not a monster, Loki. I don\u2019t know why you think so. You saved me, and you did it knowing it would harm you.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Then he kisses the blue lips, and shivers at the cold. When Loki wants to pull away, Tony holds him in place a bit longer before letting him go.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You truly think so?\u2019\u2019 Loki asks, and his skin turns back to its usual colour.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I know so,\u2019\u2019 Tony says, and kisses him again.</p>",

The most important one is that Tony has been crushing on his teammate since forever and Loki being Loki, it\u2019s probably not going to be very long until he finds it out.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Another one is that Tony tends to say the wrong thing around Loki. He will never forget the time he called Loki \u2018princess\u2019 and found himself pinned to the wall. It\u2019s just \u2013 they seem to argue more often than not. Tony doesn\u2019t mean any of it, and it\u2019s fun for a while, but then Loki seems to take it personal.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I am afraid it is time we admit defeat and wait for a rescue party,\u2019\u2019 Loki says. \u2018\u2019It will be impossible to get through these walls. Perhaps the Hulk could, if he deemed it necessary.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Hulk doesn\u2019t need an excuse to smash,\u2019\u2019 Tony quips.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I am well aware.\u2019\u2019 Loki\u2019s tone is a bit dry, and Tony is never sure if he means it or not. He thinks Loki is just joking with him, but Tony finds it kind of hard to figure him out sometimes.</p><p>They\u2019re sitting beside each other for some time, just waiting it out. It\u2019s not the first time someone in the team got stuck somewhere, and there\u2019s not much reason for panic. The villain they\u2019re fighting is minor, and their being stuck here merely an inconvenience.</p><p>But then Tony starts sweating. \u2018\u2019Do you think it\u2019s hot in here?\u2019\u2019 he asks Loki, who has a pensive look on his face.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I think they\u2019re turning up the heat,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, swiftly standing up. \u2018\u2019Perhaps they mean to weaken us without facing us directly.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony isn\u2019t bothered by the heat. He thinks about the cave in Afghanistan for a second, but it was mainly the cold, there, that got to him. The cold would maybe trigger him, but the heat \u2013 that will only be a discomfort, at most.</p><p>Until it gets hotter, and hotter. \u2018\u2019That\u2019s it,\u2019\u2019 Tony decides, after wiping the sweat from his brow once again. \u2018\u2019I\u2019m going to strip.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a sight to behold,\u2019\u2019 Loki says.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Darling, if you wanted me naked, all you had to do was ask.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Well, this is more fun.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony shoots Loki a glance. The god seems unperturbed by the heat. Maybe he can handle more of it, Tony wouldn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s obvious that Loki isn\u2019t as affected as Tony is.</p><p>First he takes off his shirt. He can feel Loki eyeing his back as he throws the garb on the floor. He was in the lab when the alarm went off, so he\u2019s still wearing his oil-stained pants, which he also takes off, until he\u2019s only wearing his socks and his underwear. After a split second, he also decided to get rid of the socks.</p><p>It works for a while. But the heat gets oppressing, and Tony has to close his eyes so the world will stop swinging. He\u2019s sweating profusely, and his dizziness makes his nausea only worse.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Stark.\u2019\u2019 Someone is holding him by the shoulders. Sitting up is a task too hard for Tony, right now. \u2018\u2019Stark, are you with me? Stark!\u2019\u2019</p><p>Oh yeah, it\u2019s Loki. Tony manages to open his eyes. There is more than one Loki in front of him. There\u2019s some sweat on his brow, but he seems to be holding up against the heat far more effectually than Tony is.</p><p>His head is aching, and thinking seems to be impossible. \u2018\u2019Loki,\u2019\u2019 he manages to say, holding onto the god\u2019s arm. It\u2019s impossible to hold himself up.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Did you hear what I was saying? Stark?\u2019\u2019 Loki sounds worried. Tony wonders what\u2019s going on, because he doesn\u2019t hear Loki like that very often. Loki seems above these human emotions, always composed and ready for everything the world will throw at him. Tony admires that, as someone who always has to appear composed too. He\u2019s a Stark, and that brings expectations with it.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You\u2019re not well,\u2019\u2019 Loki states. \u2018\u2019You are overheating, Tony. Do you understand me?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki is really very attractive. He\u2019s also very strong, Tony thinks as he pinches Loki\u2019s arms. Since when is he lying in Loki\u2019s arms?</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m going to take that as a no,\u2019\u2019 Loki states. \u2018\u2019You\u2019re truly out of it, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Very, very nice biceps. Tony didn\u2019t know that there were two of Loki. Double the fun. Maybe also double the arguing, though, and Tony doesn\u2019t want to fight with Loki. He wants to kiss him. Maybe double the kisses?</p><p>But two times none is still zero.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Well, there is nothing wrong with your calculations, at least,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, and he moves to lay Tony down on the floor. Tony makes a noise. He doesn\u2019t want Loki to leave.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m not leaving,\u2019\u2019 Loki tells him. A few moments later, he is unclothed with the exception of his briefs, his skin blue, and his eyes are red. Not a sliver of the green is left. Tony can only stare, until the god lies down next to him. He\u2019s cool, and Tony clutches at him.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Relax,\u2019\u2019 Loki murmurs. \u2018\u2019This will allow you to hold out a bit longer. Until we are rescued, alright? I know it\u2019s not perfect, but you will die if I don\u2019t.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony can\u2019t help but cuddle into Loki\u2019s arms. The cold of Loki\u2019s body makes the heat a bit more bearable, and he stares at the markings on the god\u2019s bare chest. He has never seen him like this, but he\u2019s equally certain he\u2019s never seen anything more beautiful.</p><p>Loki turns his face against Tony\u2019s cheek, and Tony presses into Loki\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I only hope we will last like this until they come,\u2019\u2019 he hears Loki whisper. Then Tony falls asleep in the cool of Loki\u2019s embrace.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Tony wakes up with a giant headache.</p><p>He makes the mistake of opening his eyes and is blinded by the light. \u2018\u2019Lights off,\u2019\u2019 he moans, trying to cover his head with his blanket. His muscles are aching, too, and not in a pleasant way.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Not even you can find a way to turn off the sun, Tony,\u2019\u2019 he hears an amused voice beside him. Pepper is sitting there. Tony can\u2019t find it in himself to be surprised.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You know I could find a way, if I tried hard enough.\u2019\u2019 He tries sitting up, and Pepper helps him.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You had us scared there, for a moment,\u2019\u2019 Pepper tells him, and Tony searches his memories for what he\u2019s done now. However, he comes up with nothing.</p><p>She seems to notice his confused look. \u2018\u2019You were overheating. The doctors say you wouldn\u2019t have made it, if it wasn\u2019t for Loki.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t remember any of it, except \u2013 maybe a bit. He remembers Loki being stuck with him, but he doesn\u2019t know what happened after that. He thinks he lay in Loki\u2019s arms, but he\u2019s hardly going to ask Pepper about that. In any case, it\u2019s improbable that she even knows what exactly happened.</p><p>\u2018\u2019What about Loki?\u2019\u2019 he asks.</p><p>Pepper shrugs. \u2018\u2019Still on bed rest, and bitching about it, I heard. There\u2019s something about him being a Frost Giant, or something like that, and apparently it made him more vulnerable to the heat than being a regular god. I didn\u2019t ask for details.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki, a Frost Giant. Okay, well, Tony knew Loki is adopted, and isn\u2019t a regular Asgardian, but he hadn\u2019t thought much more about it. \u2018\u2019Can I see him?\u2019\u2019 Tony asks.</p><p>Pepper hesitates for a moment. \u2018\u2019There\u2019s something else you should know. The room was being recorded, apparently, and the Avengers saw the video of the two of you there. Tony, do you \u2013 are you in love with Loki?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Um,\u2019\u2019 Tony says.</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s okay if you are,\u2019\u2019 Pepper adds, \u2018\u2019I mean, I\u2019m rooting for you, Tony, really. But if I were you, I\u2019d prepare yourself for everyone knowing about it.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Including Loki?\u2019\u2019 Tony asks. Because that won\u2019t make it Tony\u2019s crush more awkward than it already is.</p><p>Pepper smiles tightly. \u2018\u2019Including Loki.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony lets his head fall back on the pillow. He\u2019s doomed.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It takes him a few days to get back to his usual strength, and in those days, he doesn\u2019t see Loki even once.</p><p>The other Avengers tease him about liking the god, but aren\u2019t worried, because Loki has been part of their team for long enough that there\u2019s at least some trust between them and their old enemy-turned-ally. Even Thor doesn\u2019t seem bothered by it, and when Tony asks him why, Thor says that Loki is more than capable of taking care of himself.</p><p>Tony supposes that\u2019s true.</p><p>He tries to find Loki, but every time he comes even close to the god, Loki disappears. Tony tries not to take it as a hint, and thinks that maybe he\u2019s said or done something weird during their time stuck together, so he finally goes to see the video.</p><p>And \u2013 well, okay. He\u2019s blatantly told Loki, in his stupid overheated state, that he basically thinks Loki is the best thing on Earth, or any other planet, as it may be. But besides that \u2013 it\u2019s not like he has insulted him, or done something spectacularly stupid, except being his usual brand of Tony Stark.</p><p>It\u2019s still stupidly hot to see Loki turn to his Frost Giant form, though, and Tony may secretly have taken a few screenshots. He and Loki are blatantly cuddling by the end of the video. He\u2019s touched that Loki gave up his Asgardian physique, that protected him from the heat, to give Tony the cold he needed and thus putting himself at risk.</p><p>But seeing as Loki is avoiding him now, that was nothing more than a teammate helping him out of a life-threatening situation, like they do on a daily basis. He has to forget about Loki cuddling up to him, and accept that the god is giving him a clear hint that he doesn\u2019t want Tony.</p><p>Tony can\u2019t exactly blame him.</p><p>He stops trying to go and see Loki, and focuses on other things, instead. Like figuring out what kind of EMP those bad guys had used to override his suit. It\u2019s obviously a more fruitful endeavour.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It\u2019s Loki that comes to find him, in the end.</p><p>Tony is so surprised that he nearly drops the device he\u2019s using to weld some parts of his suits together.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Careful with that,\u2019\u2019 Loki advices him. \u2018\u2019I think we\u2019ve both dealt with enough heat, for the foreseeable future.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Tell me about it,\u2019\u2019 Tony answers easily, even if his heartbeat is much faster than usual. He removes his goggles, and walks away from the suit, to Loki. \u2018\u2019What, um. Can I help you with something?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki gives a fleeting smile, as if he\u2019s nervous about something, and looks away for a second before focusing on Tony again. \u2018\u2019I had a question, actually.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Shoot away,\u2019\u2019 Tony says, with a wave of his hand.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Are you in love with me?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony blinks. \u2018\u2019Except for that, holy shit,\u2019\u2019 he manages. \u2018\u2019Weren\u2019t you the subtle one on this team? I thought, um, I thought the answer to that was pretty clear. Considering my apparent inability to keep my mouth shut when overheating.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki shrugs. \u2018\u2019I did not mean to take whatever you said in that state too seriously. You were pretty far gone, honestly.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Yeah.\u2019\u2019 Tony coughs. \u2018\u2019I never got to thank you for saving me. But, as to your question, I, um, watched the video. Pretty much all I said can be taken seriously. So. There\u2019s that.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki takes a step forward, near Tony, tilting his head. He\u2019s looking at Tony as if trying to figure out a particularly hard problem. \u2018\u2019And do you still feel the same way?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s been a week, Loki, seriously, give me some time,\u2019\u2019 Tony says. Loki is probably here to figure out how fast Tony can get over this. He\u2019s crushing pretty hard on the god, actually, so it may take a bit longer than he wants to admit to himself.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I don\u2019t mean to,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, and then they\u2019re crashing into each other. Loki is cupping Tony\u2019s head with his right hand, pressing their lips together. Tony can do nothing but kiss back, even as his mind goes blank.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how long they stand like this, but when they break apart, he finds his own hands on Loki\u2019s waist, pressing him closer, and Loki\u2019s other hand on the small of Tony\u2019s back, under his shirt.</p><p>\u2018\u2019What?\u2019\u2019 Tony says.</p><p>Loki huffs out a laugh. \u2018\u2019You do want this, am I right?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I do, but you don\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 Tony points out, taking a step back, getting away from Loki. \u2018\u2019You\u2019ve been avoiding me ever since being stuck together, when you saved my life at the risk of your own, and then you come and do that? You can see how I have a little trouble figuring this out, can\u2019t you?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Tony,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, and taking a step forward so they\u2019re just as close again. \u2018\u2019This is not a trick. I am being honest with you, believe me. It\u2019s just \u2013 not many people have seen me as a Frost Giant, before. They\u2019re monsters. I knew I had to do it, when you were overheating, you wouldn\u2019t have made it much longer. But when you saw me \u2013 you were afraid. Your eyes were so wide, and you didn\u2019t say anything. I was afraid that you\u2019d be disgusted, after seeing me like that. But hearing you still feel the same \u2013 I do want this. You have to believe me.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I wasn\u2019t afraid,\u2019\u2019 Tony says, dumbfounded. \u2018\u2019Shit, Loki, I was awed. The only thing I could think about is how beautiful you are, like that. I mean, you are now, too, but that \u2013 that was breath-taking. Don\u2019t you see? I wasn\u2019t afraid.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m a monster,\u2019\u2019 Loki says. \u2018\u2019There\u2019s nothing beautiful about that.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Can you\u2026\u2019\u2019 Tony hesitates for a second. \u2018\u2019Can you turn, now? For me?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki gives him an indecipherable look, but his face starts turning blue, and his eyes red. The marking are all over his body, and Tony lays his hand on Loki\u2019s face, tenderly. For a moment, neither of them move, and then Tony lets out a deep breath and smiles.</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s beautiful,\u2019\u2019 he says simply. \u2018\u2019You\u2019re not a monster, Loki. I don\u2019t know why you think so. You saved me, and you did it knowing it would harm you.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Then he kisses the blue lips, and shivers at the cold. When Loki wants to pull away, Tony holds him in place a bit longer before letting him go.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You truly think so?\u2019\u2019 Loki asks, and his skin turns back to its usual colour.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I know so,\u2019\u2019 Tony says, and kisses him again.</p>",

He\u2019d never expected to find himself snuggling with a Frost Giant to prevent his body from overheating.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/13623420\">[read on ao3]</a></p><p>They\u2019re trapped. For real, this time \u2013 the door is shut, and they don\u2019t have the force to get it open. There aren\u2019t any windows, and the walls are too thick and made of steel. Even if Tony\u2019s suit was operational at the moment \u2013 and thanks to the decidedly effective variant of an EMP that he got shot with, it isn\u2019t \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be a way to get out of the room.<br></p><p>\u2018\u2019I thought you said your suit could withstand devices such as these,\u2019\u2019 Loki drawls beside him, seemingly unimpressed.</p><p>Tony inspects his suit one last time, but gets up as it becomes apparent that the power won\u2019t restart. The arc reactor is strong enough to be undamaged, but that won\u2019t be much of a help if the rest of the suit is not working. The reactor can\u2019t function on its own.</p><p>\u2018\u2019They must\u2019ve made some alterations,\u2019\u2019 Tony says. Being stuck with Loki isn\u2019t the worse thing, but he does hope the rest of the team will be able to take down the bad guy with them unavailable. They\u2019re efficient, sure, but Iron Man is a very helpful team member, and Loki\u2019s magic has proven itself unbelievably valuable during missions.</p><p>Okay, there are some downsides to being stuck with Loki. The most important one is that Tony has been crushing on his teammate since forever and Loki being Loki, it\u2019s probably not going to be very long until he finds it out.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Another one is that Tony tends to say the wrong thing around Loki. He will never forget the time he called Loki \u2018princess\u2019 and found himself pinned to the wall. It\u2019s just \u2013 they seem to argue more often than not. Tony doesn\u2019t mean any of it, and it\u2019s fun for a while, but then Loki seems to take it personal.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I am afraid it is time we admit defeat and wait for a rescue party,\u2019\u2019 Loki says. \u2018\u2019It will be impossible to get through these walls. Perhaps the Hulk could, if he deemed it necessary.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Hulk doesn\u2019t need an excuse to smash,\u2019\u2019 Tony quips.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I am well aware.\u2019\u2019 Loki\u2019s tone is a bit dry, and Tony is never sure if he means it or not. He thinks Loki is just joking with him, but Tony finds it kind of hard to figure him out sometimes.</p><p>They\u2019re sitting beside each other for some time, just waiting it out. It\u2019s not the first time someone in the team got stuck somewhere, and there\u2019s not much reason for panic. The villain they\u2019re fighting is minor, and their being stuck here merely an inconvenience.</p><p>But then Tony starts sweating. \u2018\u2019Do you think it\u2019s hot in here?\u2019\u2019 he asks Loki, who has a pensive look on his face.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I think they\u2019re turning up the heat,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, swiftly standing up. \u2018\u2019Perhaps they mean to weaken us without facing us directly.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony isn\u2019t bothered by the heat. He thinks about the cave in Afghanistan for a second, but it was mainly the cold, there, that got to him. The cold would maybe trigger him, but the heat \u2013 that will only be a discomfort, at most.</p><p>Until it gets hotter, and hotter. \u2018\u2019That\u2019s it,\u2019\u2019 Tony decides, after wiping the sweat from his brow once again. \u2018\u2019I\u2019m going to strip.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a sight to behold,\u2019\u2019 Loki says.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Darling, if you wanted me naked, all you had to do was ask.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Well, this is more fun.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony shoots Loki a glance. The god seems unperturbed by the heat. Maybe he can handle more of it, Tony wouldn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s obvious that Loki isn\u2019t as affected as Tony is.</p><p>First he takes off his shirt. He can feel Loki eyeing his back as he throws the garb on the floor. He was in the lab when the alarm went off, so he\u2019s still wearing his oil-stained pants, which he also takes off, until he\u2019s only wearing his socks and his underwear. After a split second, he also decided to get rid of the socks.</p><p>It works for a while. But the heat gets oppressing, and Tony has to close his eyes so the world will stop swinging. He\u2019s sweating profusely, and his dizziness makes his nausea only worse.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Stark.\u2019\u2019 Someone is holding him by the shoulders. Sitting up is a task too hard for Tony, right now. \u2018\u2019Stark, are you with me? Stark!\u2019\u2019</p><p>Oh yeah, it\u2019s Loki. Tony manages to open his eyes. There is more than one Loki in front of him. There\u2019s some sweat on his brow, but he seems to be holding up against the heat far more effectually than Tony is.</p><p>His head is aching, and thinking seems to be impossible. \u2018\u2019Loki,\u2019\u2019 he manages to say, holding onto the god\u2019s arm. It\u2019s impossible to hold himself up.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Did you hear what I was saying? Stark?\u2019\u2019 Loki sounds worried. Tony wonders what\u2019s going on, because he doesn\u2019t hear Loki like that very often. Loki seems above these human emotions, always composed and ready for everything the world will throw at him. Tony admires that, as someone who always has to appear composed too. He\u2019s a Stark, and that brings expectations with it.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You\u2019re not well,\u2019\u2019 Loki states. \u2018\u2019You are overheating, Tony. Do you understand me?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki is really very attractive. He\u2019s also very strong, Tony thinks as he pinches Loki\u2019s arms. Since when is he lying in Loki\u2019s arms?</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m going to take that as a no,\u2019\u2019 Loki states. \u2018\u2019You\u2019re truly out of it, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Very, very nice biceps. Tony didn\u2019t know that there were two of Loki. Double the fun. Maybe also double the arguing, though, and Tony doesn\u2019t want to fight with Loki. He wants to kiss him. Maybe double the kisses?</p><p>But two times none is still zero.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Well, there is nothing wrong with your calculations, at least,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, and he moves to lay Tony down on the floor. Tony makes a noise. He doesn\u2019t want Loki to leave.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m not leaving,\u2019\u2019 Loki tells him. A few moments later, he is unclothed with the exception of his briefs, his skin blue, and his eyes are red. Not a sliver of the green is left. Tony can only stare, until the god lies down next to him. He\u2019s cool, and Tony clutches at him.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Relax,\u2019\u2019 Loki murmurs. \u2018\u2019This will allow you to hold out a bit longer. Until we are rescued, alright? I know it\u2019s not perfect, but you will die if I don\u2019t.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony can\u2019t help but cuddle into Loki\u2019s arms. The cold of Loki\u2019s body makes the heat a bit more bearable, and he stares at the markings on the god\u2019s bare chest. He has never seen him like this, but he\u2019s equally certain he\u2019s never seen anything more beautiful.</p><p>Loki turns his face against Tony\u2019s cheek, and Tony presses into Loki\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I only hope we will last like this until they come,\u2019\u2019 he hears Loki whisper. Then Tony falls asleep in the cool of Loki\u2019s embrace.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Tony wakes up with a giant headache.</p><p>He makes the mistake of opening his eyes and is blinded by the light. \u2018\u2019Lights off,\u2019\u2019 he moans, trying to cover his head with his blanket. His muscles are aching, too, and not in a pleasant way.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Not even you can find a way to turn off the sun, Tony,\u2019\u2019 he hears an amused voice beside him. Pepper is sitting there. Tony can\u2019t find it in himself to be surprised.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You know I could find a way, if I tried hard enough.\u2019\u2019 He tries sitting up, and Pepper helps him.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You had us scared there, for a moment,\u2019\u2019 Pepper tells him, and Tony searches his memories for what he\u2019s done now. However, he comes up with nothing.</p><p>She seems to notice his confused look. \u2018\u2019You were overheating. The doctors say you wouldn\u2019t have made it, if it wasn\u2019t for Loki.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t remember any of it, except \u2013 maybe a bit. He remembers Loki being stuck with him, but he doesn\u2019t know what happened after that. He thinks he lay in Loki\u2019s arms, but he\u2019s hardly going to ask Pepper about that. In any case, it\u2019s improbable that she even knows what exactly happened.</p><p>\u2018\u2019What about Loki?\u2019\u2019 he asks.</p><p>Pepper shrugs. \u2018\u2019Still on bed rest, and bitching about it, I heard. There\u2019s something about him being a Frost Giant, or something like that, and apparently it made him more vulnerable to the heat than being a regular god. I didn\u2019t ask for details.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki, a Frost Giant. Okay, well, Tony knew Loki is adopted, and isn\u2019t a regular Asgardian, but he hadn\u2019t thought much more about it. \u2018\u2019Can I see him?\u2019\u2019 Tony asks.</p><p>Pepper hesitates for a moment. \u2018\u2019There\u2019s something else you should know. The room was being recorded, apparently, and the Avengers saw the video of the two of you there. Tony, do you \u2013 are you in love with Loki?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Um,\u2019\u2019 Tony says.</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s okay if you are,\u2019\u2019 Pepper adds, \u2018\u2019I mean, I\u2019m rooting for you, Tony, really. But if I were you, I\u2019d prepare yourself for everyone knowing about it.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Including Loki?\u2019\u2019 Tony asks. Because that won\u2019t make it Tony\u2019s crush more awkward than it already is.</p><p>Pepper smiles tightly. \u2018\u2019Including Loki.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony lets his head fall back on the pillow. He\u2019s doomed.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It takes him a few days to get back to his usual strength, and in those days, he doesn\u2019t see Loki even once.</p><p>The other Avengers tease him about liking the god, but aren\u2019t worried, because Loki has been part of their team for long enough that there\u2019s at least some trust between them and their old enemy-turned-ally. Even Thor doesn\u2019t seem bothered by it, and when Tony asks him why, Thor says that Loki is more than capable of taking care of himself.</p><p>Tony supposes that\u2019s true.</p><p>He tries to find Loki, but every time he comes even close to the god, Loki disappears. Tony tries not to take it as a hint, and thinks that maybe he\u2019s said or done something weird during their time stuck together, so he finally goes to see the video.</p><p>And \u2013 well, okay. He\u2019s blatantly told Loki, in his stupid overheated state, that he basically thinks Loki is the best thing on Earth, or any other planet, as it may be. But besides that \u2013 it\u2019s not like he has insulted him, or done something spectacularly stupid, except being his usual brand of Tony Stark.</p><p>It\u2019s still stupidly hot to see Loki turn to his Frost Giant form, though, and Tony may secretly have taken a few screenshots. He and Loki are blatantly cuddling by the end of the video. He\u2019s touched that Loki gave up his Asgardian physique, that protected him from the heat, to give Tony the cold he needed and thus putting himself at risk.</p><p>But seeing as Loki is avoiding him now, that was nothing more than a teammate helping him out of a life-threatening situation, like they do on a daily basis. He has to forget about Loki cuddling up to him, and accept that the god is giving him a clear hint that he doesn\u2019t want Tony.</p><p>Tony can\u2019t exactly blame him.</p><p>He stops trying to go and see Loki, and focuses on other things, instead. Like figuring out what kind of EMP those bad guys had used to override his suit. It\u2019s obviously a more fruitful endeavour.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It\u2019s Loki that comes to find him, in the end.</p><p>Tony is so surprised that he nearly drops the device he\u2019s using to weld some parts of his suits together.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Careful with that,\u2019\u2019 Loki advices him. \u2018\u2019I think we\u2019ve both dealt with enough heat, for the foreseeable future.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Tell me about it,\u2019\u2019 Tony answers easily, even if his heartbeat is much faster than usual. He removes his goggles, and walks away from the suit, to Loki. \u2018\u2019What, um. Can I help you with something?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki gives a fleeting smile, as if he\u2019s nervous about something, and looks away for a second before focusing on Tony again. \u2018\u2019I had a question, actually.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Shoot away,\u2019\u2019 Tony says, with a wave of his hand.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Are you in love with me?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Tony blinks. \u2018\u2019Except for that, holy shit,\u2019\u2019 he manages. \u2018\u2019Weren\u2019t you the subtle one on this team? I thought, um, I thought the answer to that was pretty clear. Considering my apparent inability to keep my mouth shut when overheating.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki shrugs. \u2018\u2019I did not mean to take whatever you said in that state too seriously. You were pretty far gone, honestly.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Yeah.\u2019\u2019 Tony coughs. \u2018\u2019I never got to thank you for saving me. But, as to your question, I, um, watched the video. Pretty much all I said can be taken seriously. So. There\u2019s that.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki takes a step forward, near Tony, tilting his head. He\u2019s looking at Tony as if trying to figure out a particularly hard problem. \u2018\u2019And do you still feel the same way?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s been a week, Loki, seriously, give me some time,\u2019\u2019 Tony says. Loki is probably here to figure out how fast Tony can get over this. He\u2019s crushing pretty hard on the god, actually, so it may take a bit longer than he wants to admit to himself.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I don\u2019t mean to,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, and then they\u2019re crashing into each other. Loki is cupping Tony\u2019s head with his right hand, pressing their lips together. Tony can do nothing but kiss back, even as his mind goes blank.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how long they stand like this, but when they break apart, he finds his own hands on Loki\u2019s waist, pressing him closer, and Loki\u2019s other hand on the small of Tony\u2019s back, under his shirt.</p><p>\u2018\u2019What?\u2019\u2019 Tony says.</p><p>Loki huffs out a laugh. \u2018\u2019You do want this, am I right?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I do, but you don\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 Tony points out, taking a step back, getting away from Loki. \u2018\u2019You\u2019ve been avoiding me ever since being stuck together, when you saved my life at the risk of your own, and then you come and do that? You can see how I have a little trouble figuring this out, can\u2019t you?\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Tony,\u2019\u2019 Loki says, and taking a step forward so they\u2019re just as close again. \u2018\u2019This is not a trick. I am being honest with you, believe me. It\u2019s just \u2013 not many people have seen me as a Frost Giant, before. They\u2019re monsters. I knew I had to do it, when you were overheating, you wouldn\u2019t have made it much longer. But when you saw me \u2013 you were afraid. Your eyes were so wide, and you didn\u2019t say anything. I was afraid that you\u2019d be disgusted, after seeing me like that. But hearing you still feel the same \u2013 I do want this. You have to believe me.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I wasn\u2019t afraid,\u2019\u2019 Tony says, dumbfounded. \u2018\u2019Shit, Loki, I was awed. The only thing I could think about is how beautiful you are, like that. I mean, you are now, too, but that \u2013 that was breath-taking. Don\u2019t you see? I wasn\u2019t afraid.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m a monster,\u2019\u2019 Loki says. \u2018\u2019There\u2019s nothing beautiful about that.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2019Can you\u2026\u2019\u2019 Tony hesitates for a second. \u2018\u2019Can you turn, now? For me?\u2019\u2019</p><p>Loki gives him an indecipherable look, but his face starts turning blue, and his eyes red. The marking are all over his body, and Tony lays his hand on Loki\u2019s face, tenderly. For a moment, neither of them move, and then Tony lets out a deep breath and smiles.</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s beautiful,\u2019\u2019 he says simply. \u2018\u2019You\u2019re not a monster, Loki. I don\u2019t know why you think so. You saved me, and you did it knowing it would harm you.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Then he kisses the blue lips, and shivers at the cold. When Loki wants to pull away, Tony holds him in place a bit longer before letting him go.</p><p>\u2018\u2019You truly think so?\u2019\u2019 Loki asks, and his skin turns back to its usual colour.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I know so,\u2019\u2019 Tony says, and kisses him again.</p>",

He&rsquo;d never expected to find himself snuggling with a Frost Giant to prevent his body from overheating.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/13623420\">[read on ao3]</a></p><p>They&rsquo;re trapped. For real, this time &ndash; the door is shut, and they don&rsquo;t have the force to get it open. There aren&rsquo;t any windows, and the walls are too thick and made of steel. Even if Tony&rsquo;s suit was operational at the moment &ndash; and thanks to the decidedly effective variant of an EMP that he got shot with, it isn&rsquo;t &ndash; there wouldn&rsquo;t be a way to get out of the room.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I thought you said your suit could withstand devices such as these,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki drawls beside him, seemingly unimpressed.</p><p>Tony inspects his suit one last time, but gets up as it becomes apparent that the power won&rsquo;t restart. The arc reactor is strong enough to be undamaged, but that won&rsquo;t be much of a help if the rest of the suit is not working. The reactor can&rsquo;t function on its own.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;They must&rsquo;ve made some alterations,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony says. Being stuck with Loki isn&rsquo;t the worse thing, but he does hope the rest of the team will be able to take down the bad guy with them unavailable. They&rsquo;re efficient, sure, but Iron Man is a very helpful team member, and Loki&rsquo;s magic has proven itself unbelievably valuable during missions.</p><p>Okay, there are some downsides to being stuck with Loki. The most important one is that Tony has been crushing on his teammate since forever and Loki being Loki, it&rsquo;s probably not going to be very long until he finds it out.</p><p>Another one is that Tony tends to say the wrong thing around Loki. He will never forget the time he called Loki &lsquo;princess&rsquo; and found himself pinned to the wall. It&rsquo;s just &ndash; they seem to argue more often than not. Tony doesn&rsquo;t mean any of it, and it&rsquo;s fun for a while, but then Loki seems to take it personal.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I am afraid it is time we admit defeat and wait for a rescue party,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki says. &lsquo;&rsquo;It will be impossible to get through these walls. Perhaps the Hulk could, if he deemed it necessary.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Hulk doesn&rsquo;t need an excuse to smash,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony quips.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I am well aware.&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki&rsquo;s tone is a bit dry, and Tony is never sure if he means it or not. He thinks Loki is just joking with him, but Tony finds it kind of hard to figure him out sometimes.</p><p>They&rsquo;re sitting beside each other for some time, just waiting it out. It&rsquo;s not the first time someone in the team got stuck somewhere, and there&rsquo;s not much reason for panic. The villain they&rsquo;re fighting is minor, and their being stuck here merely an inconvenience.</p><p>But then Tony starts sweating. &lsquo;&rsquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s hot in here?&rsquo;&rsquo; he asks Loki, who has a pensive look on his face.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I think they&rsquo;re turning up the heat,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki says, swiftly standing up. &lsquo;&rsquo;Perhaps they mean to weaken us without facing us directly.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Tony isn&rsquo;t bothered by the heat. He thinks about the cave in Afghanistan for a second, but it was mainly the cold, there, that got to him. The cold would maybe trigger him, but the heat &ndash; that will only be a discomfort, at most.</p><p>Until it gets hotter, and hotter. &lsquo;&rsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony decides, after wiping the sweat from his brow once again. &lsquo;&rsquo;I&rsquo;m going to strip.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a sight to behold,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki says.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Darling, if you wanted me naked, all you had to do was ask.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Well, this is more fun.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Tony shoots Loki a glance. The god seems unperturbed by the heat. Maybe he can handle more of it, Tony wouldn&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s obvious that Loki isn&rsquo;t as affected as Tony is.</p><p>First he takes off his shirt. He can feel Loki eyeing his back as he throws the garb on the floor. He was in the lab when the alarm went off, so he&rsquo;s still wearing his oil-stained pants, which he also takes off, until he&rsquo;s only wearing his socks and his underwear. After a split second, he also decided to get rid of the socks.</p><p>It works for a while. But the heat gets oppressing, and Tony has to close his eyes so the world will stop swinging. He&rsquo;s sweating profusely, and his dizziness makes his nausea only worse.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Stark.&rsquo;&rsquo; Someone is holding him by the shoulders. Sitting up is a task too hard for Tony, right now. &lsquo;&rsquo;Stark, are you with me? Stark!&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s Loki. Tony manages to open his eyes. There is more than one Loki in front of him. There&rsquo;s some sweat on his brow, but he seems to be holding up against the heat far more effectually than Tony is.</p><p>His head is aching, and thinking seems to be impossible. &lsquo;&rsquo;Loki,&rsquo;&rsquo; he manages to say, holding onto the god&rsquo;s arm. It&rsquo;s impossible to hold himself up.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Did you hear what I was saying? Stark?&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki sounds worried. Tony wonders what&rsquo;s going on, because he doesn&rsquo;t hear Loki like that very often. Loki seems above these human emotions, always composed and ready for everything the world will throw at him. Tony admires that, as someone who always has to appear composed too. He&rsquo;s a Stark, and that brings expectations with it.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;You&rsquo;re not well,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki states. &lsquo;&rsquo;You are overheating, Tony. Do you understand me?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Loki is really very attractive. He&rsquo;s also very strong, Tony thinks as he pinches Loki&rsquo;s arms. Since when is he lying in Loki&rsquo;s arms?</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I&rsquo;m going to take that as a no,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki states. &lsquo;&rsquo;You&rsquo;re truly out of it, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Very, very nice biceps. Tony didn&rsquo;t know that there were two of Loki. Double the fun. Maybe also double the arguing, though, and Tony doesn&rsquo;t want to fight with Loki. He wants to kiss him. Maybe double the kisses?</p><p>But two times none is still zero.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Well, there is nothing wrong with your calculations, at least,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki says, and he moves to lay Tony down on the floor. Tony makes a noise. He doesn&rsquo;t want Loki to leave.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki tells him. A few moments later, he is unclothed with the exception of his briefs, his skin blue, and his eyes are red. Not a sliver of the green is left. Tony can only stare, until the god lies down next to him. He&rsquo;s cool, and Tony clutches at him.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Relax,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki murmurs. &lsquo;&rsquo;This will allow you to hold out a bit longer. Until we are rescued, alright? I know it&rsquo;s not perfect, but you will die if I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Tony can&rsquo;t help but cuddle into Loki&rsquo;s arms. The cold of Loki&rsquo;s body makes the heat a bit more bearable, and he stares at the markings on the god&rsquo;s bare chest. He has never seen him like this, but he&rsquo;s equally certain he&rsquo;s never seen anything more beautiful.</p><p>Loki turns his face against Tony&rsquo;s cheek, and Tony presses into Loki&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I only hope we will last like this until they come,&rsquo;&rsquo; he hears Loki whisper. Then Tony falls asleep in the cool of Loki&rsquo;s embrace.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Tony wakes up with a giant headache.</p><p>He makes the mistake of opening his eyes and is blinded by the light. &lsquo;&rsquo;Lights off,&rsquo;&rsquo; he moans, trying to cover his head with his blanket. His muscles are aching, too, and not in a pleasant way.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Not even you can find a way to turn off the sun, Tony,&rsquo;&rsquo; he hears an amused voice beside him. Pepper is sitting there. Tony can&rsquo;t find it in himself to be surprised.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;You know I could find a way, if I tried hard enough.&rsquo;&rsquo; He tries sitting up, and Pepper helps him.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;You had us scared there, for a moment,&rsquo;&rsquo; Pepper tells him, and Tony searches his memories for what he&rsquo;s done now. However, he comes up with nothing.</p><p>She seems to notice his confused look. &lsquo;&rsquo;You were overheating. The doctors say you wouldn&rsquo;t have made it, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Loki.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t remember any of it, except &ndash; maybe a bit. He remembers Loki being stuck with him, but he doesn&rsquo;t know what happened after that. He thinks he lay in Loki&rsquo;s arms, but he&rsquo;s hardly going to ask Pepper about that. In any case, it&rsquo;s improbable that she even knows what exactly happened.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;What about Loki?&rsquo;&rsquo; he asks.</p><p>Pepper shrugs. &lsquo;&rsquo;Still on bed rest, and bitching about it, I heard. There&rsquo;s something about him being a Frost Giant, or something like that, and apparently it made him more vulnerable to the heat than being a regular god. I didn&rsquo;t ask for details.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Loki, a Frost Giant. Okay, well, Tony knew Loki is adopted, and isn&rsquo;t a regular Asgardian, but he hadn&rsquo;t thought much more about it. &lsquo;&rsquo;Can I see him?&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony asks.</p><p>Pepper hesitates for a moment. &lsquo;&rsquo;There&rsquo;s something else you should know. The room was being recorded, apparently, and the Avengers saw the video of the two of you there. Tony, do you &ndash; are you in love with Loki?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Um,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony says.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;It&rsquo;s okay if you are,&rsquo;&rsquo; Pepper adds, &lsquo;&rsquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m rooting for you, Tony, really. But if I were you, I&rsquo;d prepare yourself for everyone knowing about it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Including Loki?&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony asks. Because that won&rsquo;t make it Tony&rsquo;s crush more awkward than it already is.</p><p>Pepper smiles tightly. &lsquo;&rsquo;Including Loki.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Tony lets his head fall back on the pillow. He&rsquo;s doomed.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It takes him a few days to get back to his usual strength, and in those days, he doesn&rsquo;t see Loki even once.</p><p>The other Avengers tease him about liking the god, but aren&rsquo;t worried, because Loki has been part of their team for long enough that there&rsquo;s at least some trust between them and their old enemy-turned-ally. Even Thor doesn&rsquo;t seem bothered by it, and when Tony asks him why, Thor says that Loki is more than capable of taking care of himself.</p><p>Tony supposes that&rsquo;s true.</p><p>He tries to find Loki, but every time he comes even close to the god, Loki disappears. Tony tries not to take it as a hint, and thinks that maybe he&rsquo;s said or done something weird during their time stuck together, so he finally goes to see the video.</p><p>And &ndash; well, okay. He&rsquo;s blatantly told Loki, in his stupid overheated state, that he basically thinks Loki is the best thing on Earth, or any other planet, as it may be. But besides that &ndash; it&rsquo;s not like he has insulted him, or done something spectacularly stupid, except being his usual brand of Tony Stark.</p><p>It&rsquo;s still stupidly hot to see Loki turn to his Frost Giant form, though, and Tony may secretly have taken a few screenshots. He and Loki are blatantly cuddling by the end of the video. He&rsquo;s touched that Loki gave up his Asgardian physique, that protected him from the heat, to give Tony the cold he needed and thus putting himself at risk.</p><p>But seeing as Loki is avoiding him now, that was nothing more than a teammate helping him out of a life-threatening situation, like they do on a daily basis. He has to forget about Loki cuddling up to him, and accept that the god is giving him a clear hint that he doesn&rsquo;t want Tony.</p><p>Tony can&rsquo;t exactly blame him.</p><p>He stops trying to go and see Loki, and focuses on other things, instead. Like figuring out what kind of EMP those bad guys had used to override his suit. It&rsquo;s obviously a more fruitful endeavour.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It&rsquo;s Loki that comes to find him, in the end.</p><p>Tony is so surprised that he nearly drops the device he&rsquo;s using to weld some parts of his suits together.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Careful with that,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki advices him. &lsquo;&rsquo;I think we&rsquo;ve both dealt with enough heat, for the foreseeable future.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tell me about it,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony answers easily, even if his heartbeat is much faster than usual. He removes his goggles, and walks away from the suit, to Loki. &lsquo;&rsquo;What, um. Can I help you with something?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Loki gives a fleeting smile, as if he&rsquo;s nervous about something, and looks away for a second before focusing on Tony again. &lsquo;&rsquo;I had a question, actually.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Shoot away,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony says, with a wave of his hand.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Are you in love with me?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Tony blinks. &lsquo;&rsquo;Except for that, holy shit,&rsquo;&rsquo; he manages. &lsquo;&rsquo;Weren&rsquo;t you the subtle one on this team? I thought, um, I thought the answer to that was pretty clear. Considering my apparent inability to keep my mouth shut when overheating.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Loki shrugs. &lsquo;&rsquo;I did not mean to take whatever you said in that state too seriously. You were pretty far gone, honestly.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Yeah.&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony coughs. &lsquo;&rsquo;I never got to thank you for saving me. But, as to your question, I, um, watched the video. Pretty much all I said can be taken seriously. So. There&rsquo;s that.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Loki takes a step forward, near Tony, tilting his head. He&rsquo;s looking at Tony as if trying to figure out a particularly hard problem. &lsquo;&rsquo;And do you still feel the same way?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;It&rsquo;s been a week, Loki, seriously, give me some time,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony says. Loki is probably here to figure out how fast Tony can get over this. He&rsquo;s crushing pretty hard on the god, actually, so it may take a bit longer than he wants to admit to himself.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki says, and then they&rsquo;re crashing into each other. Loki is cupping Tony&rsquo;s head with his right hand, pressing their lips together. Tony can do nothing but kiss back, even as his mind goes blank.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know how long they stand like this, but when they break apart, he finds his own hands on Loki&rsquo;s waist, pressing him closer, and Loki&rsquo;s other hand on the small of Tony&rsquo;s back, under his shirt.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;What?&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony says.</p><p>Loki huffs out a laugh. &lsquo;&rsquo;You do want this, am I right?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I do, but you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony points out, taking a step back, getting away from Loki. &lsquo;&rsquo;You&rsquo;ve been avoiding me ever since being stuck together, when you saved my life at the risk of your own, and then you come and do that? You can see how I have a little trouble figuring this out, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tony,&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki says, and taking a step forward so they&rsquo;re just as close again. &lsquo;&rsquo;This is not a trick. I am being honest with you, believe me. It&rsquo;s just &ndash; not many people have seen me as a Frost Giant, before. They&rsquo;re monsters.

When Loki wants to pull away, Tony holds him in place a bit longer before letting him go.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;You truly think so?&rsquo;&rsquo; Loki asks, and his skin turns back to its usual colour.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I know so,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony says, and kisses him again.</p>",
