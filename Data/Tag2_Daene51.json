Dickon, however, seemed like a decent man. That\u2019s why I took issue with Daenerys burning Dickon alive, especially since he was the brother of the same man who cured one of her closest friends.",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p><i>(2) I\u2019m surprised Jon didn\u2019t make a bigger issue out of that with Daenerys. If Sansa and Arya found out about that as well, then I would understand their refusal to trust her. However, the writers just make the Stark sisters seem xenophobic and ungrateful toward the woman who helped ensure their survival against the White Walkers.<br/></i></p><p><i>(3) Then, there\u2019s the hype around Daenerys becoming a \u201cMad Queen\u201d similar to how her father became the \u201cMad King.\u201d Do people realize how prejudiced that is toward people with family histories of mental health issues?</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Well, I do think that it\u2019s worth noting that Dany did not know Sam had cured Jorah at that point&ndash;she and Jorah did not reunite until later that same episode. She\u2019d have no way of knowing Dickon was a decent man (and he did seem to be) and he was supporting someone who was not (his father).\u00a0</p><p>That said, I actually <i>completely</i> agree that her burning them was stupid strategically and bad morally, but I don\u2019t think Dany realized just how bad it was and people forget that just because we the audience knew, <b>she absolutely did not</b>. I do appreciate that the show shows consequences for her for that though and actually think Sam\u2019s mistrust was justified.</p><p>But exactly like you say, Sansa and Arya\u2019s mistrust is ridiculous. If they\u2019re playing Tyrion and Varys like they played Littlefinger I can forgive a bit though it\u2019s still, just like the Sansa vs. Arya plot last season, just plain bad writing, but if not&hellip; like #yikes. You can\u2019t have your heroes say the exact same thing your villain said (\u201dshe\u2019s not one of us\u201d) and frame them as right for it. You just can\u2019t. And they forgave Theon and Sansa gave Littlefinger chance after chance after chance and doesn\u2019t give that to Dany&hellip; why exactly? We\u2019re never given a concrete reason and it is just so out of character. It also doesn\u2019t play well when such a statement is coupled with the blatant and deliberate displays of racism in the North. You really wanna endorse the racism which at least several leaked possible endings would? You sure, HBO? D&amp;D can kiss Star Wars goodbye if so.\u00a0</p><p>YEAH. That\u2019s a big thing with the ableism. Racist, misogynistic, and ableist, what a winning combo. Like, really HBO? Really? Even if this <i>is</i> just baiting, and I have to believe it is because I can\u2019t fathom the show putting her down as a mad dog (yes I\u2019m up to date on leaks and the confusion continues), it\u2019s irresponsible of the showrunners to set it up like this and to (apparently) actually hire people to drop half-true half-false leaks (according to a reliable source&ndash;Javi) so no one knows what the truth is. And they\u2019ve yet to show us any kind of evidence she\u2019s unstable and not just, idk, experiencing emotions like a normal person going through loss. At this point it\u2019s too late for them to pull it off in a believable way; even if the story does go there, they will be rightfully excoriated for it, for sending the message that if you experience just enough tragedy even if your motif through 7 seasons has always been bringing life from death, you might just go insane.\u00a0</p><p>We know Dany has a good heart. IF she goes mad, it\u2019s not her revealing what she\u2019s always been deep down. It\u2019s her breaking after so much tragedy. That\u2019s not a villain; that\u2019s a tragedy.

        "answer": "<hr><p>Hi Nonny,</p><p>The problem is that the leaks have multiple characters behaving completely out of character. Behaving in ways that the preparatory groundwork (needed for the audience to suspect that something like this was coming) done in seven and a half seasons simply would not lead us to expect.</p><p>We are to believe that Dany just completely loses her mind\u2026 after hearing bells. As if she has not known loss before. As if there is some significant trauma in her life that would be triggered by hearing bells. And the Unsullied are shown to lose their discipline. The guys who didn\u2019t lose discipline in the face of the Army of the Dead (where many of their colleagues died) are to lose their discipline. I can understand this for Grey Worm, but what of the rest of the unit?</p><p>Then we have Jon killing the love of his life. If this is to be made palatable at all then Dany has to be so dangerous and insane at this juncture that she\u2019d make Viserys look like Bran. You know like trying to Dracarys Jon etc. Otherwise why would he just blindly believe that Tyrion\u2019s account of her going full-on Aerys insane was the truth? Wouldn\u2019t he try to verify this himself?</p><p>And the problem with Tyrion is that as of 8x04 I still don\u2019t really detect treason from him. He does seem to have divided loyalties between wanting to keep his sister safe and serving Dany. If consistency is to be maintained in any sense then their ought to be some continuity to his motivations. What will this be?</p><p>The problem, however, is that right now the confidence level in D&amp;D\u2019s desire to maintain logic and consistency is at an all time low. They simply don\u2019t seem interested in it so far this season. It really seems like they are willing to throw logic to the wind to get cool shots and shocking scenes. What else is one to make of an entire fleet being missed by Dany and her fleet on the open sea under a clear sky, and Euron just managing to kill Rhaegal like this?</p><p>Here is what happened to Prince Morion (these Scorpions are not a new technology you know)</p><blockquote><p><br/>Dorne had not boasted any strength at sea since Nymeria burned her ten thousand ships, but Prince Morion did have gold, and he found willing allies in the pirates of the Stepstones, the sellsails of Myr, and the corsairs of the Pepper Coast. Though it took him the best part of a year, eventually the ships came straggling in, and the prince and his spearmen were loaded aboard. <i><b>Morion had been weaned on the tales of past Dornish glory, and like many young Dornish lords he had seen the sun mottled bones of the dragon Meraxes at the Hellholt. Every ship in his fleet was therefore manned with crossbowmen and equipped with massive scorpions of the sort that had felled Meraxes. If the Targaryens dared to send dragons against him, he would fill the air with bolts and kill them all\u2026</b></i></p><p>Jaehaerys Targaryen and his sons Aemon and Baelon had been waiting as well, and as Morion\u2019s fleet beat its way across the Sea of Dorne, the dragons Vermithor, Caraxes, and Vhagar fell on them from out of the clouds.<i><b> Shouts rang out, and the Dornish filled the air with scorpion bolts, but firing at a dragon is one thing, and killing it quite another. A few bolts glanced off the scales of the dragons, and one punched through Vhagar\u2019s wing, but none of them found any vulnerable spots as the dragons swooped and banked and loosed great blasts of fire. One by one the ships went up in gouts of flame</b></i>. They were still burning when the sun went down, \u201clike a hundred candles floating on the sea.\u201d Burned bodies would wash up on the shores of Cape Wrath for half a year, but not a single living Dornishman set foot upon the stormlands.</p><p>The Fourth Dornish War was fought and won in a single day. The pirates of the Stepstones, the sellsails of Myr, and the corsairs of the Pepper Coast became less troublesome for a time, and Mara Martell became the Princess of Dorne. Back in King\u2019s Landing, King Jaehaerys and his sons received a riotous welcome. Even Aegon the Conqueror had never won a war without losing a man. (F&amp;B)</p></blockquote><p>When the show goes in this direction it becomes very hard to trust anything.</p><p>For example before 8x04 I would have said that a leak saying that Jon just leaves Ghost without so much as a pet and sends him North would not happen. That the showrunners know that the audience itself has adopted Ghost as a pet and there needs to be more emotion in this scene. But it did happen. So that is what makes it hard to rule things out on logic.</p>",

I would do the same thing in her situation. Who wouldn\u2019t? Yet everyone is now calling her a mad queen ,like wtf? Do we watch the same show? So mad at the writers and everyone else because a strong female character can\u2019t show anger without being called crazy, and go mad, or become a villain. Fuck you all. I know they intend to make her a bad person and I don\u2019t believe it for a second. They gonna kill her character and i\u2019m gonna kill someone for that. Fuck.",
