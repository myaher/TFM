Almost everyone knew it. As if the way that he lost focus or stopped mid-sentence when you entered a room wasn\u2019t enough to tell, he even stuttered over his words and his voice got deeper and more \u201cmacho\u201d. The nights that you stay over at the Tower, he tends to walk around in sleeveless muscle shirts and tighter fitting sweats. Tony noticed right away, finding it a little gross but also hilarious.</p><p>\u201cHey guys!\u201d You exclaim, treading into the room with a bag over your shoulder and a suitcase in your other hand. Stephen jumps, startled by your voice. He jolts around, his eyes landing on you. \u201cY/N. Didn\u2019t know you were coming!\u201d Steve exclaims, striding over to you and giving you a friendly hug. Stephen watches Steve\u2019s hands closely, uncomfortable with his hands on you. Yeah, Cap is old-fashioned and a gentleman, but he\u2019s still a man. \u201cDad didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d You respond as he pulls away, his gentle hands falling back to his sides before he takes notice of your bags and goes to pick them up for you. This makes Stephen a little more pissed, believing that Steve is trying to win you over.</p><p>\u201cHello, Y/N.\u201d He greets as he strides over to you, his hard eyes landing on Steve for a moment as he begins walking toward one of the guest rooms. You wrap your arms around Stephen\u2019s larger form, smiling against his chest contently as his large rough hands find your back, holding you close. You subtly inhale the intoxicating smell of whatever cologne he is wearing, making him all the more appealing. You are sure that no one other than Steve knows about your serious crush on Doctor Strange himself, so you pull away before the hug can be considered too long. \u201cHow are you, Stephen?\u201d You ask him.</p><p>Little do you know how weak you make him in the knees at hearing his name on your tongue. \u201cI am well. How have you been, Y/N?\u201d He responds. Little does he know that your name on his lips has the same effect on you. \u201cI\u2019ve been alright.\u201d You say, your eyes leaving his as you notice Natasha approaching you. Something about the look in your eyes makes Stephen not believe you, feeling like there is something bothering you. Before he can think anything of it, your father comes booming into the room, as per usual. \u201cStrange! Good to see you!\u201d Thor exclaims, giving his friend a hefty pat on the shoulder as he heads past him toward the fridge. \u201cLady Natasha! Has Tony bought what Y/N requested?\u201d Thor questions Widow, whom takes a casual seat on one of Tony\u2019s luxurious sofas. \u201cYes Thor. Top shelf.\u201d She responds. Stephen raises his brow curiously at Y/N, who chuckles lightly, approaching her father. \u201cDaddy, I told you not to bother them. It was mostly a joke.\u201d Stephen bites his lip, almost not hearing anything you said after \u201cdaddy\u201d. He doesn\u2019t have a daddy kink, but something about the way you said it, although totally innocent, makes him want you to say it to him. For you to submit yourself to him, want to please him, to be his innocent little girl.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, being that you are Thor\u2019s twenty-three year old daughter, you are off-limits to each and every member of the team. Thor wants Steve and Tony to protect you from men attempting to make advances on you, as a matter of fact. \u201cUncle Loki!\u201d You exclaim, causing every head in the room to turn towards the door. Loki stands there, a slightly stunned look on his face. You run over to him, clearly very excited to see him, which confuses Stephen very much. He knows that the god of mischief is your uncle, but he didn\u2019t think you were very close to him. \u201cHello, dove.\u201d He greets, opening his arms to you as you leap into them dramatically. It had been a while since you saw him, after he disappeared for a while after faking his death. Stephen wishes that you would leap into his arms like that, causing him to look away as you clung onto your uncle, overjoyed to see him.</p><p>Later in the day, you had decided to take a nap, due to the long plane-ride from India where you were doing some overseas charity work, building homes and helping those in need. You apparently insisted that Thor not teleport you, because you enjoyed the human experiences, even jet-lag. Stephen watched longingly as you trudged into the room sleepily, in more comfortable clothes than earlier, which consisted of sleeping shorts and a t-shirt, your hair in a messy bun. You swear that you look like a mess, but Stephen is captivated. So much so, that he forgets not to stare, and Loki catches him watching you.</p><p>He clears his throat, bringing Stephen back to reality, his head shooting to the mischievous man. \u201cSee something you like?\u201d He asks, his face anything but playful. He has that same look that Thor had when he overheard Tony making a flirty comment toward you when he first met you. Not quite as \u201cready to kill\u201d but still very dangerous. \u201cWhat? No?\u201d He responds, awkwardly attempting to play off the fact that he was just literally entranced by your presence alone. You are paying no attention to them, too busy searching for the cereal that Thor asked Tony to get for you.</p><p>Loki continues staring at Stephen, trying to figure out what to do. He could lash out at him, could tell Thor or you, or he could do the responsible thing. He\u2019s supposed to be trying to turn a new leaf, and he knows that you care for Stephen, therefore harming him would be harming you. \u201cRight. Do tell why you are staring at my niece then.\u201d He presses, unfamiliar with this protective feeling he has over you. \u201cWho is staring at your niece?\u201d Booms throughout the room. Stephen\u2019s eyes shoot up at Thor\u2019s very large, aggravated body towering over him from the sofa. You obviously hear Thor and started approaching the three men in the sitting room. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d You ask, wondering why your uncle and father are gathered around Stephen. \u201cDo you have feelings for my daughter?!\u201d Thor booms, his muscles tensing, very irritated that one of his colleagues is seriously interested in his precious not-so-little girl.</p><p>\u201cHold on hold on hold on. You guys are jumping the gun.\u201d Stephen defends himself, until his eyes fall on you. They immediately soften, a look that both Loki and Thor are very much familiar with. As opposed to normal, this enrages Thor more, whereas it softens Loki. \u201cBrother\u2026 He is looking at her the way you look at Jane.\u201d Loki reasons, bewildering Stephen. He turns away from you, embarrassed that his secret is out. \u201cDad. Stop it. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d You demand, stepping between Stephen and Thor. He glares at the man behind you, then finally sighs and relaxes a little. \u201cDo not hurt her.\u201d He threatens, then retreats off to another room, probably to sulk about how you\u2019re growing up, even though you already did quite a few years ago. Loki looks between the two of you, before slowing heading out of the room as well. \u201cSo is it true?\u201d You ask once the two of you are alone. Stephen doesn\u2019t meet your eye at first, unsure if he should try to play it off or not. He isn\u2019t even sure what he wants at this point.</p><p>\u201cI hope so, cuz I have feelings for you, Stephen.\u201d You mutter, ducking your eyes, not catching his stunned face as you walk out of the room, leaving him standing there frozen in place, attempting to process what just happened. </p>",

Almost everyone knew it. As if the way that he lost focus or stopped mid-sentence when you entered a room wasn\u2019t enough to tell, he even stuttered over his words and his voice got deeper and more \u201cmacho\u201d. The nights that you stay over at the Tower, he tends to walk around in sleeveless muscle shirts and tighter fitting sweats. Tony noticed right away, finding it a little gross but also hilarious.</p><p>\u201cHey guys!\u201d You exclaim, treading into the room with a bag over your shoulder and a suitcase in your other hand. Stephen jumps, startled by your voice. He jolts around, his eyes landing on you. \u201cY/N. Didn\u2019t know you were coming!\u201d Steve exclaims, striding over to you and giving you a friendly hug. Stephen watches Steve\u2019s hands closely, uncomfortable with his hands on you. Yeah, Cap is old-fashioned and a gentleman, but he\u2019s still a man. \u201cDad didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d You respond as he pulls away, his gentle hands falling back to his sides before he takes notice of your bags and goes to pick them up for you. This makes Stephen a little more pissed, believing that Steve is trying to win you over.</p><p>\u201cHello, Y/N.\u201d He greets as he strides over to you, his hard eyes landing on Steve for a moment as he begins walking toward one of the guest rooms. You wrap your arms around Stephen\u2019s larger form, smiling against his chest contently as his large rough hands find your back, holding you close. You subtly inhale the intoxicating smell of whatever cologne he is wearing, making him all the more appealing. You are sure that no one other than Steve knows about your serious crush on Doctor Strange himself, so you pull away before the hug can be considered too long. \u201cHow are you, Stephen?\u201d You ask him.</p><p>Little do you know how weak you make him in the knees at hearing his name on your tongue. \u201cI am well. How have you been, Y/N?\u201d He responds. Little does he know that your name on his lips has the same effect on you. \u201cI\u2019ve been alright.\u201d You say, your eyes leaving his as you notice Natasha approaching you. Something about the look in your eyes makes Stephen not believe you, feeling like there is something bothering you. Before he can think anything of it, your father comes booming into the room, as per usual. \u201cStrange! Good to see you!\u201d Thor exclaims, giving his friend a hefty pat on the shoulder as he heads past him toward the fridge. \u201cLady Natasha! Has Tony bought what Y/N requested?\u201d Thor questions Widow, whom takes a casual seat on one of Tony\u2019s luxurious sofas. \u201cYes Thor. Top shelf.\u201d She responds. Stephen raises his brow curiously at Y/N, who chuckles lightly, approaching her father. \u201cDaddy, I told you not to bother them. It was mostly a joke.\u201d Stephen bites his lip, almost not hearing anything you said after \u201cdaddy\u201d. He doesn\u2019t have a daddy kink, but something about the way you said it, although totally innocent, makes him want you to say it to him. For you to submit yourself to him, want to please him, to be his innocent little girl.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, being that you are Thor\u2019s twenty-three year old daughter, you are off-limits to each and every member of the team. Thor wants Steve and Tony to protect you from men attempting to make advances on you, as a matter of fact. \u201cUncle Loki!\u201d You exclaim, causing every head in the room to turn towards the door. Loki stands there, a slightly stunned look on his face. You run over to him, clearly very excited to see him, which confuses Stephen very much. He knows that the god of mischief is your uncle, but he didn\u2019t think you were very close to him. \u201cHello, dove.\u201d He greets, opening his arms to you as you leap into them dramatically. It had been a while since you saw him, after he disappeared for a while after faking his death. Stephen wishes that you would leap into his arms like that, causing him to look away as you clung onto your uncle, overjoyed to see him.</p><p>Later in the day, you had decided to take a nap, due to the long plane-ride from India where you were doing some overseas charity work, building homes and helping those in need. You apparently insisted that Thor not teleport you, because you enjoyed the human experiences, even jet-lag. Stephen watched longingly as you trudged into the room sleepily, in more comfortable clothes than earlier, which consisted of sleeping shorts and a t-shirt, your hair in a messy bun. You swear that you look like a mess, but Stephen is captivated. So much so, that he forgets not to stare, and Loki catches him watching you.</p><p>He clears his throat, bringing Stephen back to reality, his head shooting to the mischievous man. \u201cSee something you like?\u201d He asks, his face anything but playful. He has that same look that Thor had when he overheard Tony making a flirty comment toward you when he first met you. Not quite as \u201cready to kill\u201d but still very dangerous. \u201cWhat? No?\u201d He responds, awkwardly attempting to play off the fact that he was just literally entranced by your presence alone. You are paying no attention to them, too busy searching for the cereal that Thor asked Tony to get for you.</p><p>Loki continues staring at Stephen, trying to figure out what to do. He could lash out at him, could tell Thor or you, or he could do the responsible thing. He\u2019s supposed to be trying to turn a new leaf, and he knows that you care for Stephen, therefore harming him would be harming you. \u201cRight. Do tell why you are staring at my niece then.\u201d He presses, unfamiliar with this protective feeling he has over you. \u201cWho is staring at your niece?\u201d Booms throughout the room. Stephen\u2019s eyes shoot up at Thor\u2019s very large, aggravated body towering over him from the sofa. You obviously hear Thor and started approaching the three men in the sitting room. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d You ask, wondering why your uncle and father are gathered around Stephen. \u201cDo you have feelings for my daughter?!\u201d Thor booms, his muscles tensing, very irritated that one of his colleagues is seriously interested in his precious not-so-little girl.</p><p>\u201cHold on hold on hold on. You guys are jumping the gun.\u201d Stephen defends himself, until his eyes fall on you. They immediately soften, a look that both Loki and Thor are very much familiar with. As opposed to normal, this enrages Thor more, whereas it softens Loki. \u201cBrother\u2026 He is looking at her the way you look at Jane.\u201d Loki reasons, bewildering Stephen. He turns away from you, embarrassed that his secret is out. \u201cDad. Stop it. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d You demand, stepping between Stephen and Thor. He glares at the man behind you, then finally sighs and relaxes a little. \u201cDo not hurt her.\u201d He threatens, then retreats off to another room, probably to sulk about how you\u2019re growing up, even though you already did quite a few years ago. Loki looks between the two of you, before slowing heading out of the room as well. \u201cSo is it true?\u201d You ask once the two of you are alone. Stephen doesn\u2019t meet your eye at first, unsure if he should try to play it off or not. He isn\u2019t even sure what he wants at this point.</p><p>\u201cI hope so, cuz I have feelings for you, Stephen.\u201d You mutter, ducking your eyes, not catching his stunned face as you walk out of the room, leaving him standing there frozen in place, attempting to process what just happened. </p></p>",
