        "answer": "<p><b>I don&rsquo;t know if this is what you meant but I enjoyed writing this \ud83d\ude0a Thanks for the suggestion, love \ud83d\udc9e</b></p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d Peter spoke, voice barely above a whisper as his gaze fell from the screen in front of him and to his lap, where his fingers were restlessly fidgeting.\r</p><p>There was an audible sigh from Peter&rsquo;s laptop, drawing his eyes back up.

Tony chuckled, nodding his head.\r</p><p>\u201cOf course, darling; anything for my boy.\u201d he spoke, hands coming up to sit in front of him, his stubble-covered chin resting in his palms.\r</p><p>Peter smiled to himself, already imagining Tony being back \u2013 the way that the older man managed to make him feel safe in a few words and a press to his hair, the intoxicating scent of his cologne mixed with sweat (something that sounds horrible but is actually the most comforting smell that Peter knows). \r</p><p>He was soon brought out of his daydream as Tony cleared his throat to speak again, the pixelated image of the man distorting as he moved too quick for the basic Skype webcam connected to his laptop. \u201cWhat time is it over there?\u201d\r</p><p>Peter almost didn\u2019t catch what Tony had asked, eyes too focused on the now bare chest of Tony Stark pictured over his laptop screen. Tony threw is shirt somewhere behind him, not even bothering to check where it had landed as he watched Peter struggle to answer.\r</p><p>\u201cSomething distracting you there, baby boy?\u201d Tony asked, tone laced with an extra dose of smugness as a wide smirk crawled onto his face. He lazily pushed his desk chair back slightly to give Peter a wider view, chuckling as he saw Peter&rsquo;s eyes flutter closed momentarily.\r</p><p>\u201cFuck, can&rsquo;t you just fly over here? You could probably get back before anybody notices you\u2019ve gone.\u201d Peter spoke, eyes trailing over Tony\u2019s revealed tan skin, hungrily.\r</p><p>Tony sighed, \u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that, babe.\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cI know, I know&hellip;\u201d Peter mumbled, teeth sinking dangerously low into his bottom lip. Tony fought back a quiet growl, cursing himself for being so easily turned on.\r</p><p>Though, Tony didn\u2019t believe it was him being turned on so easily and rather it was Peter being undeniably attractive.\r</p><p>Peter was about to say something when there was a series of light knocks, followed by the click of a door. \u201cShit!\u201d Peter breathed out, shooting a quick, panicked look at Tony before pushing his laptop&rsquo;s screen down just enough to hide the half-naked man pictured over it but not enough to turn the laptop off.\r</p><p>\u201cPeter, are you still awake?\u201d Aunt May\u2019s voice was heard before Peter saw her slip into his crowded and messy bedroom. \r</p><p>\u201cUh yeah, I had h-homework?\u201d he stuttered, searching for a reasonable excuse for being awake at almost 1am despite it being a Monday night. He knew he should really get some sleep \u2013 he still had school, after all \u2013 but he&rsquo;d be damned if he were to miss the only opportunity he had to Skype with Tony since the older man had left on a business trip almost 5 days ago. He couldn\u2019t exactly tell May that, though.\r</p><p>May frowned, stepping further into the room. \u201cI thought I heard you speaking to someone, that&rsquo;s all.&ldquo;\r</p><p>Shit. Peter ran a hand over his face, mind racing to come up with a believable response.\r</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah, no I was just asking Ned about one of the questions. Chemistry&hellip;\u201d he trailed off with a wave of his hands, tongue lost for words.\r</p><p>\u201cChemistry? I thought Chemistry was one of your stronger subjects?\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 uh&hellip;\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cActually, Peter&rsquo;s particularly skilled in Biology.\u201d a deep voice spoke, humour evident in the words.\r</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened almost comically as he swivelled back to his laptop where the voice had come from. May was already stepping closer and he could feel his heart speed up dangerously.\r</p><p>Fuck. Tony, what the fuck?!\r</p><p>\u201cPeter, who&rsquo;s that?\u201d May questioned.\r</p><p>Peter looked up to meet her stern gaze, wringing his lower lip between his teeth. How was he going to get out of this one?\r</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s, umm&hellip;\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cTony. It&rsquo;s Tony.\u201d Tony answered for Peter, clearly unbothered by the situation. \r</p><p>May didn\u2019t even give Peter the chance to stop her, leaning forward and pulling the laptop screen up until Tony\u2019s exposed torso, smiling face, and unruly hair was in full show. She sent a questioning look between the man on the screen and Peter \u2013 now sat with his head in his hands.\r</p><p>\u201cDo either of you want to explain what on Earth is going on here?\u201d she asked in her most demanding motherly tone.\r</p><p>Peter peeked at Tony through the gaps in his fingers, willing his boyfriend to not say something ridiculously stupid.\r</p><p>\u201cHello, May, how are you? You&rsquo;re looking lovely as always.\u201d Tony said, and Peter swore he saw a flustered look fly across May&rsquo;s face. It was, however, very quickly disguised. \u201cI&rsquo;m currently in Sacramento on business and this was the only time I had free to speak with Peter. I assure you, I\u2019ve tried to make him hang up and get some sleep but he&rsquo;s quite stubborn when he chooses to be.\u201d\r</p><p>May rose an eyebrow, glancing down at Peter. She didn\u2019t ask anything else, telling Tony that she hopes his trip goes well and that he flies home safely before turning to leave the room. As she reaches the door, she faces Peter once again and spoke with a knowing smile, \u201cDon\u2019t stay up too late, yeah? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have enough chances to be with Mr Stark once he&rsquo;s back in New York.\u201d\r</p><p>With that, she left, clicking the door softly behind her.\r</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t move for a whole minute, and when he did he let out a long and loud exhale. \u201cOh my God.\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cI reckon that went better than expected.\u201d Tony mused, eyes watching Peter with amusement and an obvious amount of love.\r</p><p>\u201cNo thanks to you.\u201d Peter muttered, darkly. \u201cWhy&rsquo;d you go and say anything anyway?\u201d\r</p><p>Tony shrugged in his signature \u2018I\u2019m Tony Stark, why not\u2019 way.\r</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d Peter said with an eye roll, but the smile on his face was undeniable. \u201cYou\u2019re such an annoying jerk sometimes.\u201d\r</p><p>Tony let out a laugh at that, a proper laugh where the corners of his eyes crinkled and his head bent backwards. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, biting his lip as he faced Peter again, \u201cbut I\u2019m your jerk.\u201d\r</p><p>Peter blushed, leaning closer to the screen. One side of his mouth twisted into a small smile and he dropped his gaze to meet Tony&rsquo;s molten brown eyes. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p>",

He couldn\u2019t exactly tell May that, though.\r</p><p>May frowned, stepping further into the room. \u201cI thought I heard you speaking to someone, that\u2019s all.\u201c\r</p><p>Shit. Peter ran a hand over his face, mind racing to come up with a believable response.\r</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah, no I was just asking Ned about one of the questions. Chemistry\u2026\u201d he trailed off with a wave of his hands, tongue lost for words.\r</p><p>\u201cChemistry? I thought Chemistry was one of your stronger subjects?\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 uh\u2026\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cActually, Peter\u2019s particularly skilled in Biology.\u201d a deep voice spoke, humour evident in the words.\r</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened almost comically as he swivelled back to his laptop where the voice had come from. May was already stepping closer and he could feel his heart speed up dangerously.\r</p><p>Fuck. Tony, what the fuck?!\r</p><p>\u201cPeter, who\u2019s that?\u201d May questioned.\r</p><p>Peter looked up to meet her stern gaze, wringing his lower lip between his teeth. How was he going to get out of this one?\r</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, umm\u2026\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cTony. It\u2019s Tony.\u201d Tony answered for Peter, clearly unbothered by the situation. \r</p><p>May didn\u2019t even give Peter the chance to stop her, leaning forward and pulling the laptop screen up until Tony\u2019s exposed torso, smiling face, and unruly hair was in full show. She sent a questioning look between the man on the screen and Peter \u2013 now sat with his head in his hands.\r</p><p>\u201cDo either of you want to explain what on Earth is going on here?\u201d she asked in her most demanding motherly tone.\r</p><p>Peter peeked at Tony through the gaps in his fingers, willing his boyfriend to not say something ridiculously stupid.\r</p><p>\u201cHello, May, how are you? You\u2019re looking lovely as always.\u201d Tony said, and Peter swore he saw a flustered look fly across May\u2019s face. It was, however, very quickly disguised. \u201cI\u2019m currently in Sacramento on business and this was the only time I had free to speak with Peter. I assure you, I\u2019ve tried to make him hang up and get some sleep but he\u2019s quite stubborn when he chooses to be.\u201d\r</p><p>May rose an eyebrow, glancing down at Peter. She didn\u2019t ask anything else, telling Tony that she hopes his trip goes well and that he flies home safely before turning to leave the room. As she reaches the door, she faces Peter once again and spoke with a knowing smile, \u201cDon\u2019t stay up too late, yeah? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have enough chances to be with Mr Stark once he\u2019s back in New York.\u201d\r</p><p>With that, she left, clicking the door softly behind her.\r</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t move for a whole minute, and when he did he let out a long and loud exhale. \u201cOh my God.\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cI reckon that went better than expected.\u201d Tony mused, eyes watching Peter with amusement and an obvious amount of love.\r</p><p>\u201cNo thanks to you.\u201d Peter muttered, darkly. \u201cWhy\u2019d you go and say anything anyway?\u201d\r</p><p>Tony shrugged in his signature \u2018I\u2019m Tony Stark, why not\u2019 way.\r</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d Peter said with an eye roll, but the smile on his face was undeniable. \u201cYou\u2019re such an annoying jerk sometimes.\u201d\r</p><p>Tony let out a laugh at that, a proper laugh where the corners of his eyes crinkled and his head bent backwards. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, biting his lip as he faced Peter again, \u201cbut I\u2019m your jerk.\u201d\r</p><p>Peter blushed, leaning closer to the screen. One side of his mouth twisted into a small smile and he dropped his gaze to meet Tony\u2019s molten brown eyes. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>I don&rsquo;t know if this is what you meant but I enjoyed writing this &#128522; Thanks for the suggestion, love &#128158;</b></p><p>&ldquo;I miss you,&rdquo; Peter spoke, voice barely above a whisper as his gaze fell from the screen in front of him and to his lap, where his fingers were restlessly fidgeting.\r</p><p>There was an audible sigh from Peter&rsquo;s laptop, drawing his eyes back up. Tony rubbed a hand over his tired and worn face, hair sticking up in a way that would have usually been amusing to Peter. Today, it was just another painful reminder of the distance between the two.\r</p><p>&ldquo;I know, baby boy.&rdquo; the casual use of the nickname brought welcome butterflies to Peter&rsquo;s stomach, &ldquo;I promise, it won&rsquo;t be too long before I&rsquo;m back in New York.&rdquo;\r</p><p>&ldquo;And we can cuddle?&rdquo; Peter asked in his innocently hopeful tone of voice, cherry red lips curling up into a sweet smile. Tony chuckled, nodding his head.\r</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, darling; anything for my boy.&rdquo; he spoke, hands coming up to sit in front of him, his stubble-covered chin resting in his palms.\r</p><p>Peter smiled to himself, already imagining Tony being back &ndash; the way that the older man managed to make him feel safe in a few words and a press to his hair, the intoxicating scent of his cologne mixed with sweat (something that sounds horrible but is actually the most comforting smell that Peter knows). \r</p><p>He was soon brought out of his daydream as Tony cleared his throat to speak again, the pixelated image of the man distorting as he moved too quick for the basic Skype webcam connected to his laptop. &ldquo;What time is it over there?&rdquo;\r</p><p>Peter almost didn&rsquo;t catch what Tony had asked, eyes too focused on the now bare chest of Tony Stark pictured over his laptop screen. Tony threw is shirt somewhere behind him, not even bothering to check where it had landed as he watched Peter struggle to answer.\r</p><p>&ldquo;Something distracting you there, baby boy?&rdquo; Tony asked, tone laced with an extra dose of smugness as a wide smirk crawled onto his face. He lazily pushed his desk chair back slightly to give Peter a wider view, chuckling as he saw Peter&rsquo;s eyes flutter closed momentarily.\r</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, can&rsquo;t you just fly over here? You could probably get back before anybody notices you&rsquo;ve gone.&rdquo; Peter spoke, eyes trailing over Tony&rsquo;s revealed tan skin, hungrily.\r</p><p>Tony sighed, &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t do that, babe.&rdquo;\r</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know&hellip;&rdquo; Peter mumbled, teeth sinking dangerously low into his bottom lip. Tony fought back a quiet growl, cursing himself for being so easily turned on.\r</p><p>Though, Tony didn&rsquo;t believe it was him being turned on so easily and rather it was Peter being undeniably attractive.\r</p><p>Peter was about to say something when there was a series of light knocks, followed by the click of a door. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; Peter breathed out, shooting a quick, panicked look at Tony before pushing his laptop&rsquo;s screen down just enough to hide the half-naked man pictured over it but not enough to turn the laptop off.\r</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, are you still awake?&rdquo; Aunt May&rsquo;s voice was heard before Peter saw her slip into his crowded and messy bedroom. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Uh yeah, I had h-homework?&rdquo; he stuttered, searching for a reasonable excuse for being awake at almost 1am despite it being a Monday night.

He was picking up Peter from school the windows were tinted so no one could see him but he made sure Peter knew what car he was in. Soon as the school door opened she was the first one out the door speedily walking down the sidewalk clenching books to her chest as other students slowly trickled out of the building everyone else taking their time. Back then he didn\u2019t think much of it maybe she had work or homework to do either way it wasn\u2019t his business. He had to focus on Peter and his recklessness.</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when he first took an interest in her. It all started with her notebook.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cawe man,\u201d Peter said as he took out a notebook from his backpack.</p><p>\u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d Tony asked not really caring but he felt the need to ask.</p><p>\u201cMy lab partner got and I our notebooks mixed up\u201d</p><p>\u201cjust called Ned up and have him bring it over\u201d</p><p>\u201cnew semester teacher changed the seating chart so we\u2019ll have new partners.

She\u2019ll usually do her work by herself or whatever I say &hellip; she agrees with me a lot&hellip; I guess I\u2019m the leader of our team.\u201d</p><p>As Peter rambled on about his new lab partner Tony picked up the notebook and flipped through it. It was amazing on the side of her notes she managed to make little blueprints for small devices to anyone else they would have looked like small doodles but Tony could make out everything and this girl was a genius.</p><p>\u201cwhat\u2019s her name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/n), (y/n) (l/n)\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered the first time they first officially met.

Taking her notebooks he found out where she lived he went to meet her parents first.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. (l/n)\u201d\u00a0 a woman came to the door she opened the door with her cell phone in her hand she didn\u2019t even bother looking up to see who was at the door. She looked just liked (y/n) besides the hair and eyes, but her hair was obviously dyed.\u00a0\u201c I\u2019m here to talk to you about your daughter\u201d she still didn\u2019t look up\u00a0\u201c I\u2019m Tony Stark\u201d That seemed to get her attention she immediately looked up and was shocked she put away her phone and smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh my, Mr.Stark to whom do we oh this visit too\u201d she opened the door further waving him in</p><p>\u201cum, your daughter (Y/n)\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat did she do?\u201d she said dread she imagined the worse but quickly changed her attitude now showing cheer \u201cI mean, um, what did she do to get your attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cnothing bad I can assure you,\u201d He said as she leads him to the living room\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about I get us some snacks? be right back\u201d as she rushed to the kitchen Tony looked around the room. There were no family pictures on the wall nothing to imply that they even had a child which was strange most families put up family pictures and if not they\u2019d put up awards from there child there was always something to imply children or a child. It was strange there was no sign of her existing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cyou have a beautiful home\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you. I hope you like sugar cookies and tea,\u201d she said setting a trace on the coffee table.\u00a0\u201cnow, may I asked how my daughter managed to get your attention? I mean she doesn\u2019t do much\u201d</p><p>\u201cactually your daughter is very intelligent. My intern told me about your daughter and I decided to look more into her and your daughter is very gifted. I have this internship program I\u2019d like her to be a part of.\u201d and that\u2019s how the conversation began.</p><p>Mrs. (l/n) seemed clueless of her daughter\u2019s talent, not caring for her daughter much at all, and trying to steer the conversation elsewhere he always brought it back on topic or mentioned his soon to be wive Pepper.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until an hour later that (y/n) walked in the door completely exhausted and looked ready to pass out. Tony took note of her wet pants and the busted lip but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cOh (y/n) sweetheart where have you been? someone is here to see you\u201d Mrs. (L/n) mother didn\u2019t notice her daughter\u2019s exhausted and distressed look.\u00a0\u201c Come have a seat, come and have a seat\u00a0\u201c her mother encouraged. It wasn\u2019t until she was seated that her mother noticed her appearances.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, honey what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwalked to close to the curve and got soaked. And slipped on the stairs up to the subway. You\u2019re Tony Stark\u201d (y/n) took note of the celebrate sitting on the couch across from her.</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Mr.Stark is here to offer you an Internship. Someone put in a good word for you\u201d her mother said squeezing her with excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you know Peter Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cyes\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when she moved in it was a few months after she accepted the internship. He started noticing how she came in looking exhausted and when he took her how he noticed how her parents didn\u2019t notice it. They were clueless about her struggles. It was then that he decided to move her and Peter into the Tower. Aunt May was hesitant at first but after a lot of convincing and promises she said yes as long as he called every day and visit home once a week.\u00a0 (y/n) parents didn\u2019t hesitate said yes immediately and started packing for her, much to both their daughter and Tony\u2019s shock.<br/></p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t put up much of a fight,\u201d Tony said as he leaned up against (y/n) new bedroom door as he watched her put up her belongings.</p><p>\u201cyeah&hellip; My family is close we aren\u2019t the lovey-dovey cuddly type. If I\u00a0 tell my parents what\u2019s wrong and ask for help they\u2019ll deliberately ignore it or be clueless to the problem. That\u2019s how my family is.\u201d (y/n) said putting knick-knacks on her new dresser.</p><p>\u201cwell, I\u2019m sorry to say this family is different. Your problems will be our problems and we\u2019re always here to help\u201d Tony said smiling\u00a0\u201cnow excuse me while I got admire the Iron Man shrine in Peter\u2019s room\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when she became an unofficial official Avenger just like Peter. She also found out he was Spider-Man.</p><p>\u00a0It was when they were on a mission when Friday stopped working. Everyone had become a bit clueless as to where they were going since Tony no longer had eyes and ears. (y/n) managed to hack into everyone&rsquo;s comms and helping out. Using a computer she pulled up the building blueprints and hacked into the security feed and began to give everyone instruction on where to go and what to do and how many enemies there were. By the end, everything went smoothly and everyone was okay.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing (y/n), how did you do that?\u201d Steve asked when everyone returned\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very good with computers, hacking, and my hands, \u201c\u00a0 she said\u00a0</p><p>\u201creally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should have seen her in the robotic competition she got second place. I\u2019m pretty sure first place had connections to the judges so yeah. But her bot was amazing\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, how did you know I did the Robot competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cteachers were talking about it. I may or may not have been snooping\u201d Peter laughed and (y/n) blushed.<br/></p><p>\u201c(y/n) have you ever thought about being an Avenger,\u201d Tony said surprising (y/n) and the others</p><p>\u201c I&hellip;um&hellip; I don\u2019t have powers there\u2019s nothing special about me. I couldn\u2019t help\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have power neither doesn\u2019t Natasha, Clint, Rhodey, and Sam but we still help. There are other ways you could help\u201d</p><p>And she did with the help of Tony she built weapons and iron suits for the team. With the help of Natasha and Clint, she trained in combat and weapons. Everyone on the team pinched in to help (y/n) and Peter, but mostly (y/n), train to become Avengers. Before long just like Peter, she was doing small missions and rescues in the city.</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered their worse day together the day she stopped hiding.</p><p>It was a rainy day the clouds gathered so tight it made mid-day look like early night. Everyone was gathered in the common room watching a movie when (y/n) rushed in and up the stairs to her room. Everyone noticed her arrive but didn\u2019t say anything she was soaked to the bone from the rain and they figured she went to change. It was only Tony who noticed her red eyes and sniffling as she practically ran away.</p><p>Tony quickly followed her to her room\u00a0\u201c (y/n), sweetheart, Babygirl\u201d he knocked on her door hearing her sniffle\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s wrong, what happened?\u201d he slowly opened the door inviting himself in. She was sitting on the floor in front of the window her back towards him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore\u201d he heard her cry and saw her shoulders shake\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t want this anymore. I can\u2019t do this anymore, I\u2019m so tired. I tried I really did but I can\u2019t&hellip;.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony took a seat next to (y/n) on the floor he tried to pull her into a hug but she flinched away he was then he took notice of the bruises on her arms and face.\u00a0\u201coh baby, who did this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cit doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t want to be here\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou don\u2018t want to be here? do you want to go back to your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she cried\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t want to live\u00a0\u201c she collapsed into Tony\u2019s chest. He himself let out a sob as his own tears spilled out. He hugged her tight without hurting her.\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t want this. I can\u2019t I don\u2019t know how anymore\u201d</p><p>\u201cy-you don\u2019t have to not alone, just breathe,\u201d Tony said crying with her. It broke his heart he loved (y/n) like a daughter and would never want anything bad to happen to her. Yet here she was struggling and he didn\u2019t even notice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t -\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou can I\u2019ll help, I promise I\u2019ll help. Please, breath darling breath\u201d Tony cried as he held her close and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts, I\u2019m so tired, it hurts\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, It\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Tony said kissing her forehead as she cried herself to sleep on his chest. And as she slept on his chest and the other watched a movie downstairs unaware of the distress and pain (y/n) was in. Tony promised he\u2019d help his little girl and make up for being blind this whole time.</p><p>\u201cBreathe &hellip; it\u2019ll be okay\u201d now he\u2019s just saying it for himself.</p><hr><p><br/></p><h2>Request tags and/or stories up to anything <strike>(within reason)</strike></h2><p><b>Permanent tags</b></p><p><a

He had to focus on Peter and his recklessness.</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when he first took an interest in her. It all started with her notebook.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cawe man,\u201d Peter said as he took out a notebook from his backpack.</p><p>\u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d Tony asked not really caring but he felt the need to ask.</p><p>\u201cMy lab partner got and I our notebooks mixed up\u201d</p><p>\u201cjust called Ned up and have him bring it over\u201d</p><p>\u201cnew semester teacher changed the seating chart so we\u2019ll have new partners. My New Partner is a girl name (y/n) I don\u2019t have her number\u201d</p><p>\u201doh\u2026 a girl,\u201d Tony asked he was going to tease him to no end. Now he was happy he asked.</p><p>\u201cno, not like that. She doesn\u2019t even talk to me unless it has to do with class and even that is rare. Although she is very smart. She\u2019ll usually do her work by herself or whatever I say \u2026 she agrees with me a lot\u2026 I guess I\u2019m the leader of our team.\u201d</p><p>As Peter rambled on about his new lab partner Tony picked up the notebook and flipped through it. It was amazing on the side of her notes she managed to make little blueprints for small devices to anyone else they would have looked like small doodles but Tony could make out everything and this girl was a genius.</p><p>\u201cwhat\u2019s her name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/n), (y/n) (l/n)\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered the first time they first officially met. After talking to Peter and looking through her notebook some more he decided he needs to meet her. Taking her notebooks he found out where she lived he went to meet her parents first.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. (l/n)\u201d\u00a0 a woman came to the door she opened the door with her cell phone in her hand she didn\u2019t even bother looking up to see who was at the door. She looked just liked (y/n) besides the hair and eyes, but her hair was obviously dyed.\u00a0\u201c I\u2019m here to talk to you about your daughter\u201d she still didn\u2019t look up\u00a0\u201c I\u2019m Tony Stark\u201d That seemed to get her attention she immediately looked up and was shocked she put away her phone and smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh my, Mr.Stark to whom do we oh this visit too\u201d she opened the door further waving him in</p><p>\u201cum, your daughter (Y/n)\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat did she do?\u201d she said dread she imagined the worse but quickly changed her attitude now showing cheer \u201cI mean, um, what did she do to get your attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cnothing bad I can assure you,\u201d He said as she leads him to the living room\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about I get us some snacks? be right back\u201d as she rushed to the kitchen Tony looked around the room. There were no family pictures on the wall nothing to imply that they even had a child which was strange most families put up family pictures and if not they\u2019d put up awards from there child there was always something to imply children or a child. It was strange there was no sign of her existing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cyou have a beautiful home\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThank you. I hope you like sugar cookies and tea,\u201d she said setting a trace on the coffee table.\u00a0\u201cnow, may I asked how my daughter managed to get your attention? I mean she doesn\u2019t do much\u201d</p><p>\u201cactually your daughter is very intelligent. My intern told me about your daughter and I decided to look more into her and your daughter is very gifted. I have this internship program I\u2019d like her to be a part of.\u201d and that\u2019s how the conversation began.</p><p>Mrs. (l/n) seemed clueless of her daughter\u2019s talent, not caring for her daughter much at all, and trying to steer the conversation elsewhere he always brought it back on topic or mentioned his soon to be wive Pepper.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until an hour later that (y/n) walked in the door completely exhausted and looked ready to pass out. Tony took note of her wet pants and the busted lip but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cOh (y/n) sweetheart where have you been? someone is here to see you\u201d Mrs. (L/n) mother didn\u2019t notice her daughter\u2019s exhausted and distressed look.\u00a0\u201c Come have a seat, come and have a seat\u00a0\u201c her mother encouraged. It wasn\u2019t until she was seated that her mother noticed her appearances.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, honey what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwalked to close to the curve and got soaked. And slipped on the stairs up to the subway. You\u2019re Tony Stark\u201d (y/n) took note of the celebrate sitting on the couch across from her.</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Mr.Stark is here to offer you an Internship. Someone put in a good word for you\u201d her mother said squeezing her with excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you know Peter Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cyes\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when she moved in it was a few months after she accepted the internship. He started noticing how she came in looking exhausted and when he took her how he noticed how her parents didn\u2019t notice it. They were clueless about her struggles. It was then that he decided to move her and Peter into the Tower. Aunt May was hesitant at first but after a lot of convincing and promises she said yes as long as he called every day and visit home once a week.\u00a0 (y/n) parents didn\u2019t hesitate said yes immediately and started packing for her, much to both their daughter and Tony\u2019s shock.<br></p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t put up much of a fight,\u201d Tony said as he leaned up against (y/n) new bedroom door as he watched her put up her belongings.</p><p>\u201cyeah\u2026 My family is close we aren\u2019t the lovey-dovey cuddly type. If I\u00a0 tell my parents what\u2019s wrong and ask for help they\u2019ll deliberately ignore it or be clueless to the problem. That\u2019s how my family is.\u201d (y/n) said putting knick-knacks on her new dresser.</p><p>\u201cwell, I\u2019m sorry to say this family is different. Your problems will be our problems and we\u2019re always here to help\u201d Tony said smiling\u00a0\u201cnow excuse me while I got admire the Iron Man shrine in Peter\u2019s room\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when she became an unofficial official Avenger just like Peter. She also found out he was Spider-Man.</p><p>\u00a0It was when they were on a mission when Friday stopped working. Everyone had become a bit clueless as to where they were going since Tony no longer had eyes and ears. (y/n) managed to hack into everyone\u2019s comms and helping out. Using a computer she pulled up the building blueprints and hacked into the security feed and began to give everyone instruction on where to go and what to do and how many enemies there were. By the end, everything went smoothly and everyone was okay.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing (y/n), how did you do that?\u201d Steve asked when everyone returned\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very good with computers, hacking, and my hands, \u201c\u00a0 she said\u00a0</p><p>\u201creally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should have seen her in the robotic competition she got second place. I\u2019m pretty sure first place had connections to the judges so yeah. But her bot was amazing\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, how did you know I did the Robot competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cteachers were talking about it. I may or may not have been snooping\u201d Peter laughed and (y/n) blushed.<br></p><p>\u201c(y/n) have you ever thought about being an Avenger,\u201d Tony said surprising (y/n) and the others</p><p>\u201c I\u2026um\u2026 I don\u2019t have powers there\u2019s nothing special about me. I couldn\u2019t help\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have power neither doesn\u2019t Natasha, Clint, Rhodey, and Sam but we still help. There are other ways you could help\u201d</p><p>And she did with the help of Tony she built weapons and iron suits for the team. With the help of Natasha and Clint, she trained in combat and weapons. Everyone on the team pinched in to help (y/n) and Peter, but mostly (y/n), train to become Avengers. Before long just like Peter, she was doing small missions and rescues in the city.</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered their worse day together the day she stopped hiding.</p><p>It was a rainy day the clouds gathered so tight it made mid-day look like early night. Everyone was gathered in the common room watching a movie when (y/n) rushed in and up the stairs to her room. Everyone noticed her arrive but didn\u2019t say anything she was soaked to the bone from the rain and they figured she went to change. It was only Tony who noticed her red eyes and sniffling as she practically ran away.</p><p>Tony quickly followed her to her room\u00a0\u201c (y/n), sweetheart, Babygirl\u201d he knocked on her door hearing her sniffle\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s wrong, what happened?\u201d he slowly opened the door inviting himself in. She was sitting on the floor in front of the window her back towards him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore\u201d he heard her cry and saw her shoulders shake\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t want this anymore. I can\u2019t do this anymore, I\u2019m so tired. I tried I really did but I can\u2019t\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony took a seat next to (y/n) on the floor he tried to pull her into a hug but she flinched away he was then he took notice of the bruises on her arms and face.\u00a0\u201coh baby, who did this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cit doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t want to be here\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou don\u2018t want to be here? do you want to go back to your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she cried\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t want to live\u00a0\u201c she collapsed into Tony\u2019s chest. He himself let out a sob as his own tears spilled out. He hugged her tight without hurting her.\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t want this. I can\u2019t I don\u2019t know how anymore\u201d</p><p>\u201cy-you don\u2019t have to not alone, just breathe,\u201d Tony said crying with her. It broke his heart he loved (y/n) like a daughter and would never want anything bad to happen to her. Yet here she was struggling and he didn\u2019t even notice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t -\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou can I\u2019ll help, I promise I\u2019ll help. Please, breath darling breath\u201d Tony cried as he held her close and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts, I\u2019m so tired, it hurts\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, It\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Tony said kissing her forehead as she cried herself to sleep on his chest. And as she slept on his chest and the other watched a movie downstairs unaware of the distress and pain (y/n) was in. Tony promised he\u2019d help his little girl and make up for being blind this whole time.</p><p>\u201cBreathe \u2026 it\u2019ll be okay\u201d now he\u2019s just saying it for himself.</p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Request tags and/or stories up to anything <strike>(within reason)</strike></h2><p><b>Permanent tags</b></p><p><a

He was picking up Peter from school the windows were tinted so no one could see him but he made sure Peter knew what car he was in. Soon as the school door opened she was the first one out the door speedily walking down the sidewalk clenching books to her chest as other students slowly trickled out of the building everyone else taking their time. Back then he didn\u2019t think much of it maybe she had work or homework to do either way it wasn\u2019t his business. He had to focus on Peter and his recklessness.</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when he first took an interest in her. It all started with her notebook.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cawe man,\u201d Peter said as he took out a notebook from his backpack.</p><p>\u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d Tony asked not really caring but he felt the need to ask.</p><p>\u201cMy lab partner got and I our notebooks mixed up\u201d</p><p>\u201cjust called Ned up and have him bring it over\u201d</p><p>\u201cnew semester teacher changed the seating chart so we\u2019ll have new partners. My New Partner is a girl name (y/n) I don\u2019t have her number\u201d</p><p>\u201doh\u2026 a girl,\u201d Tony asked he was going to tease him to no end. Now he was happy he asked.</p><p>\u201cno, not like that. She doesn\u2019t even talk to me unless it has to do with class and even that is rare. Although she is very smart. She\u2019ll usually do her work by herself or whatever I say \u2026 she agrees with me a lot\u2026 I guess I\u2019m the leader of our team.\u201d</p><p>As Peter rambled on about his new lab partner Tony picked up the notebook and flipped through it. It was amazing on the side of her notes she managed to make little blueprints for small devices to anyone else they would have looked like small doodles but Tony could make out everything and this girl was a genius.</p><p>\u201cwhat\u2019s her name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/n), (y/n) (l/n)\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered the first time they first officially met. After talking to Peter and looking through her notebook some more he decided he needs to meet her. Taking her notebooks he found out where she lived he went to meet her parents first.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. (l/n)\u201d\u00a0 a woman came to the door she opened the door with her cell phone in her hand she didn\u2019t even bother looking up to see who was at the door. She looked just liked (y/n) besides the hair and eyes, but her hair was obviously dyed.\u00a0\u201c I\u2019m here to talk to you about your daughter\u201d she still didn\u2019t look up\u00a0\u201c I\u2019m Tony Stark\u201d That seemed to get her attention she immediately looked up and was shocked she put away her phone and smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh my, Mr.Stark to whom do we oh this visit too\u201d she opened the door further waving him in</p><p>\u201cum, your daughter (Y/n)\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat did she do?\u201d she said dread she imagined the worse but quickly changed her attitude now showing cheer \u201cI mean, um, what did she do to get your attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cnothing bad I can assure you,\u201d He said as she leads him to the living room\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about I get us some snacks? be right back\u201d as she rushed to the kitchen Tony looked around the room. There were no family pictures on the wall nothing to imply that they even had a child which was strange most families put up family pictures and if not they\u2019d put up awards from there child there was always something to imply children or a child. It was strange there was no sign of her existing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cyou have a beautiful home\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThank you. I hope you like sugar cookies and tea,\u201d she said setting a trace on the coffee table.\u00a0\u201cnow, may I asked how my daughter managed to get your attention? I mean she doesn\u2019t do much\u201d</p><p>\u201cactually your daughter is very intelligent. My intern told me about your daughter and I decided to look more into her and your daughter is very gifted. I have this internship program I\u2019d like her to be a part of.\u201d and that\u2019s how the conversation began.</p><p>Mrs. (l/n) seemed clueless of her daughter\u2019s talent, not caring for her daughter much at all, and trying to steer the conversation elsewhere he always brought it back on topic or mentioned his soon to be wive Pepper.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until an hour later that (y/n) walked in the door completely exhausted and looked ready to pass out. Tony took note of her wet pants and the busted lip but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cOh (y/n) sweetheart where have you been? someone is here to see you\u201d Mrs. (L/n) mother didn\u2019t notice her daughter\u2019s exhausted and distressed look.\u00a0\u201c Come have a seat, come and have a seat\u00a0\u201c her mother encouraged. It wasn\u2019t until she was seated that her mother noticed her appearances.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, honey what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwalked to close to the curve and got soaked. And slipped on the stairs up to the subway. You\u2019re Tony Stark\u201d (y/n) took note of the celebrate sitting on the couch across from her.</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Mr.Stark is here to offer you an Internship. Someone put in a good word for you\u201d her mother said squeezing her with excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you know Peter Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cyes\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when she moved in it was a few months after she accepted the internship. He started noticing how she came in looking exhausted and when he took her how he noticed how her parents didn\u2019t notice it. They were clueless about her struggles. It was then that he decided to move her and Peter into the Tower. Aunt May was hesitant at first but after a lot of convincing and promises she said yes as long as he called every day and visit home once a week.\u00a0 (y/n) parents didn\u2019t hesitate said yes immediately and started packing for her, much to both their daughter and Tony\u2019s shock.<br></p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t put up much of a fight,\u201d Tony said as he leaned up against (y/n) new bedroom door as he watched her put up her belongings.</p><p>\u201cyeah\u2026 My family is close we aren\u2019t the lovey-dovey cuddly type. If I\u00a0 tell my parents what\u2019s wrong and ask for help they\u2019ll deliberately ignore it or be clueless to the problem. That\u2019s how my family is.\u201d (y/n) said putting knick-knacks on her new dresser.</p><p>\u201cwell, I\u2019m sorry to say this family is different. Your problems will be our problems and we\u2019re always here to help\u201d Tony said smiling\u00a0\u201cnow excuse me while I got admire the Iron Man shrine in Peter\u2019s room\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when she became an unofficial official Avenger just like Peter. She also found out he was Spider-Man.</p><p>\u00a0It was when they were on a mission when Friday stopped working. Everyone had become a bit clueless as to where they were going since Tony no longer had eyes and ears. (y/n) managed to hack into everyone\u2019s comms and helping out. Using a computer she pulled up the building blueprints and hacked into the security feed and began to give everyone instruction on where to go and what to do and how many enemies there were. By the end, everything went smoothly and everyone was okay.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing (y/n), how did you do that?\u201d Steve asked when everyone returned\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very good with computers, hacking, and my hands, \u201c\u00a0 she said\u00a0</p><p>\u201creally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should have seen her in the robotic competition she got second place. I\u2019m pretty sure first place had connections to the judges so yeah. But her bot was amazing\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, how did you know I did the Robot competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cteachers were talking about it. I may or may not have been snooping\u201d Peter laughed and (y/n) blushed.<br></p><p>\u201c(y/n) have you ever thought about being an Avenger,\u201d Tony said surprising (y/n) and the others</p><p>\u201c I\u2026um\u2026 I don\u2019t have powers there\u2019s nothing special about me. I couldn\u2019t help\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have power neither doesn\u2019t Natasha, Clint, Rhodey, and Sam but we still help. There are other ways you could help\u201d</p><p>And she did with the help of Tony she built weapons and iron suits for the team. With the help of Natasha and Clint, she trained in combat and weapons. Everyone on the team pinched in to help (y/n) and Peter, but mostly (y/n), train to become Avengers. Before long just like Peter, she was doing small missions and rescues in the city.</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered their worse day together the day she stopped hiding.</p><p>It was a rainy day the clouds gathered so tight it made mid-day look like early night. Everyone was gathered in the common room watching a movie when (y/n) rushed in and up the stairs to her room. Everyone noticed her arrive but didn\u2019t say anything she was soaked to the bone from the rain and they figured she went to change. It was only Tony who noticed her red eyes and sniffling as she practically ran away.</p><p>Tony quickly followed her to her room\u00a0\u201c (y/n), sweetheart, Babygirl\u201d he knocked on her door hearing her sniffle\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s wrong, what happened?\u201d he slowly opened the door inviting himself in. She was sitting on the floor in front of the window her back towards him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore\u201d he heard her cry and saw her shoulders shake\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t want this anymore. I can\u2019t do this anymore, I\u2019m so tired. I tried I really did but I can\u2019t\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony took a seat next to (y/n) on the floor he tried to pull her into a hug but she flinched away he was then he took notice of the bruises on her arms and face.\u00a0\u201coh baby, who did this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cit doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t want to be here\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou don\u2018t want to be here? do you want to go back to your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she cried\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t want to live\u00a0\u201c she collapsed into Tony\u2019s chest. He himself let out a sob as his own tears spilled out. He hugged her tight without hurting her.\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t want this. I can\u2019t I don\u2019t know how anymore\u201d</p><p>\u201cy-you don\u2019t have to not alone, just breathe,\u201d Tony said crying with her. It broke his heart he loved (y/n) like a daughter and would never want anything bad to happen to her. Yet here she was struggling and he didn\u2019t even notice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t -\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou can I\u2019ll help, I promise I\u2019ll help. Please, breath darling breath\u201d Tony cried as he held her close and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts, I\u2019m so tired, it hurts\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, It\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Tony said kissing her forehead as she cried herself to sleep on his chest. And as she slept on his chest and the other watched a movie downstairs unaware of the distress and pain (y/n) was in. Tony promised he\u2019d help his little girl and make up for being blind this whole time.</p><p>\u201cBreathe \u2026 it\u2019ll be okay\u201d now he\u2019s just saying it for himself.</p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Request tags and/or stories up to anything <strike>(within reason)</strike></h2><p><b>Permanent tags</b></p><p><a

He was picking up Peter from school the windows were tinted so no one could see him but he made sure Peter knew what car he was in. Soon as the school door opened she was the first one out the door speedily walking down the sidewalk clenching books to her chest as other students slowly trickled out of the building everyone else taking their time. Back then he didn&rsquo;t think much of it maybe she had work or homework to do either way it wasn&rsquo;t his business. He had to focus on Peter and his recklessness.</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when he first took an interest in her. It all started with her notebook.</p><p>&ldquo;awe man,&rdquo; Peter said as he took out a notebook from his backpack.</p><p>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Tony asked not really caring but he felt the need to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;My lab partner got and I our notebooks mixed up&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;just called Ned up and have him bring it over&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;new semester teacher changed the seating chart so we&rsquo;ll have new partners. My New Partner is a girl name (y/n) I don&rsquo;t have her number&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;oh&hellip; a girl,&rdquo; Tony asked he was going to tease him to no end. Now he was happy he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;no, not like that. She doesn&rsquo;t even talk to me unless it has to do with class and even that is rare. Although she is very smart. She&rsquo;ll usually do her work by herself or whatever I say &hellip; she agrees with me a lot&hellip; I guess I&rsquo;m the leader of our team.&rdquo;</p><p>As Peter rambled on about his new lab partner Tony picked up the notebook and flipped through it. It was amazing on the side of her notes she managed to make little blueprints for small devices to anyone else they would have looked like small doodles but Tony could make out everything and this girl was a genius.</p><p>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s her name again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/n), (y/n) (l/n)&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered the first time they first officially met. After talking to Peter and looking through her notebook some more he decided he needs to meet her. Taking her notebooks he found out where she lived he went to meet her parents first.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Mrs. (l/n)&rdquo;&nbsp; a woman came to the door she opened the door with her cell phone in her hand she didn&rsquo;t even bother looking up to see who was at the door. She looked just liked (y/n) besides the hair and eyes, but her hair was obviously dyed.&nbsp;&ldquo; I&rsquo;m here to talk to you about your daughter&rdquo; she still didn&rsquo;t look up&nbsp;&ldquo; I&rsquo;m Tony Stark&rdquo; That seemed to get her attention she immediately looked up and was shocked she put away her phone and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my, Mr.Stark to whom do we oh this visit too&rdquo; she opened the door further waving him in</p><p>&ldquo;um, your daughter (Y/n)&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;what did she do?&rdquo; she said dread she imagined the worse but quickly changed her attitude now showing cheer &ldquo;I mean, um, what did she do to get your attention?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;nothing bad I can assure you,&rdquo; He said as she leads him to the living room&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How about I get us some snacks? be right back&rdquo; as she rushed to the kitchen Tony looked around the room. There were no family pictures on the wall nothing to imply that they even had a child which was strange most families put up family pictures and if not they&rsquo;d put up awards from there child there was always something to imply children or a child. It was strange there was no sign of her existing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;you have a beautiful home&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. I hope you like sugar cookies and tea,&rdquo; she said setting a trace on the coffee table.&nbsp;&ldquo;now, may I asked how my daughter managed to get your attention? I mean she doesn&rsquo;t do much&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;actually your daughter is very intelligent. My intern told me about your daughter and I decided to look more into her and your daughter is very gifted. I have this internship program I&rsquo;d like her to be a part of.&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s how the conversation began.</p><p>Mrs. (l/n) seemed clueless of her daughter&rsquo;s talent, not caring for her daughter much at all, and trying to steer the conversation elsewhere he always brought it back on topic or mentioned his soon to be wive Pepper.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until an hour later that (y/n) walked in the door completely exhausted and looked ready to pass out. Tony took note of her wet pants and the busted lip but didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh (y/n) sweetheart where have you been? someone is here to see you&rdquo; Mrs. (L/n) mother didn&rsquo;t notice her daughter&rsquo;s exhausted and distressed look.&nbsp;&ldquo; Come have a seat, come and have a seat&nbsp;&ldquo; her mother encouraged. It wasn&rsquo;t until she was seated that her mother noticed her appearances.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, honey what happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;walked to close to the curve and got soaked. And slipped on the stairs up to the subway. You&rsquo;re Tony Stark&rdquo; (y/n) took note of the celebrate sitting on the couch across from her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes. Mr.Stark is here to offer you an Internship. Someone put in a good word for you&rdquo; her mother said squeezing her with excitement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know Peter Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;yes&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when she moved in it was a few months after she accepted the internship. He started noticing how she came in looking exhausted and when he took her how he noticed how her parents didn&rsquo;t notice it. They were clueless about her struggles. It was then that he decided to move her and Peter into the Tower. Aunt May was hesitant at first but after a lot of convincing and promises she said yes as long as he called every day and visit home once a week.&nbsp; (y/n) parents didn&rsquo;t hesitate said yes immediately and started packing for her, much to both their daughter and Tony&rsquo;s shock.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t put up much of a fight,&rdquo; Tony said as he leaned up against (y/n) new bedroom door as he watched her put up her belongings.</p><p>&ldquo;yeah&hellip; My family is close we aren&rsquo;t the lovey-dovey cuddly type. If I&nbsp; tell my parents what&rsquo;s wrong and ask for help they&rsquo;ll deliberately ignore it or be clueless to the problem. That&rsquo;s how my family is.&rdquo; (y/n) said putting knick-knacks on her new dresser.</p><p>&ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m sorry to say this family is different. Your problems will be our problems and we&rsquo;re always here to help&rdquo; Tony said smiling&nbsp;&ldquo;now excuse me while I got admire the Iron Man shrine in Peter&rsquo;s room&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered when she became an unofficial official Avenger just like Peter. She also found out he was Spider-Man.</p><p>&nbsp;It was when they were on a mission when Friday stopped working. Everyone had become a bit clueless as to where they were going since Tony no longer had eyes and ears. (y/n) managed to hack into everyone&rsquo;s comms and helping out. Using a computer she pulled up the building blueprints and hacked into the security feed and began to give everyone instruction on where to go and what to do and how many enemies there were. By the end, everything went smoothly and everyone was okay.</p><p>&ldquo;That was amazing (y/n), how did you do that?&rdquo; Steve asked when everyone returned&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very good with computers, hacking, and my hands, &ldquo;&nbsp; she said&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you should have seen her in the robotic competition she got second place. I&rsquo;m pretty sure first place had connections to the judges so yeah. But her bot was amazing&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, how did you know I did the Robot competition?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;teachers were talking about it. I may or may not have been snooping&rdquo; Peter laughed and (y/n) blushed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;(y/n) have you ever thought about being an Avenger,&rdquo; Tony said surprising (y/n) and the others</p><p>&ldquo; I&hellip;um&hellip; I don&rsquo;t have powers there&rsquo;s nothing special about me. I couldn&rsquo;t help&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have power neither doesn&rsquo;t Natasha, Clint, Rhodey, and Sam but we still help. There are other ways you could help&rdquo;</p><p>And she did with the help of Tony she built weapons and iron suits for the team. With the help of Natasha and Clint, she trained in combat and weapons. Everyone on the team pinched in to help (y/n) and Peter, but mostly (y/n), train to become Avengers. Before long just like Peter, she was doing small missions and rescues in the city.</p><p>-</p><p>He remembered their worse day together the day she stopped hiding.</p><p>It was a rainy day the clouds gathered so tight it made mid-day look like early night. Everyone was gathered in the common room watching a movie when (y/n) rushed in and up the stairs to her room. Everyone noticed her arrive but didn&rsquo;t say anything she was soaked to the bone from the rain and they figured she went to change. It was only Tony who noticed her red eyes and sniffling as she practically ran away.</p><p>Tony quickly followed her to her room&nbsp;&ldquo; (y/n), sweetheart, Babygirl&rdquo; he knocked on her door hearing her sniffle&nbsp;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong, what happened?&rdquo; he slowly opened the door inviting himself in. She was sitting on the floor in front of the window her back towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take it anymore&rdquo; he heard her cry and saw her shoulders shake&nbsp;&ldquo; I don&rsquo;t want this anymore. I can&rsquo;t do this anymore, I&rsquo;m so tired. I tried I really did but I can&rsquo;t&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony took a seat next to (y/n) on the floor he tried to pull her into a hug but she flinched away he was then he took notice of the bruises on her arms and face.&nbsp;&ldquo;oh baby, who did this to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I don&rsquo;t want to be here&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;you don&lsquo;t want to be here? do you want to go back to your parents?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; she cried&nbsp;&ldquo; I don&rsquo;t want to live&nbsp;&ldquo; she collapsed into Tony&rsquo;s chest. He himself let out a sob as his own tears spilled out. He hugged her tight without hurting her.&nbsp;&ldquo; I don&rsquo;t want this. I can&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know how anymore&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;y-you don&rsquo;t have to not alone, just breathe,&rdquo; Tony said crying with her. It broke his heart he loved (y/n) like a daughter and would never want anything bad to happen to her. Yet here she was struggling and he didn&rsquo;t even notice.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;you can I&rsquo;ll help, I promise I&rsquo;ll help. Please, breath darling breath&rdquo; Tony cried as he held her close and kissed her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;It hurts, I&rsquo;m so tired, it hurts&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay, It&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; Tony said kissing her forehead as she cried herself to sleep on his chest. And as she slept on his chest and the other watched a movie downstairs unaware of the distress and pain (y/n) was in. Tony promised he&rsquo;d help his little girl and make up for being blind this whole time.</p><p>&ldquo;Breathe &hellip; it&rsquo;ll be okay&rdquo; now he&rsquo;s just saying it for himself.</p><hr

He smirked walking his way over to Tony. &ldquo;Now do you understand why you shouldn&rsquo;t have let your team of rouge Avengers embarrass me in front of the UN?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony scoffed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sick man Ross.&rdquo; Peter whimpered in pain trying to get some weight of his shoulder. &ldquo;Sick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like being made a fool, Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault the UN decided to change the Accords.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you helped the rest of your criminal teammates clear their name don&rsquo;t lie to me,&rdquo; Ross huffed. &ldquo;Do you know how it feels to have everyone turn against you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You be surprised.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter now,&rdquo; Ross smiled evilly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to hurt the one thing you would do anything for.&rdquo; His eyes glanced at Peter. &ldquo;My men have something special for the boy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo; Tony yelled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not involved in this Ross!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Ross you can kiss my-&ldquo; Peter yelled before Ross&rsquo; fist collided with his jaw. </p><p>&ldquo;What was that boy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kiss my fucking ass,&rdquo; Peter huffed.</p><p>Tony wanted to be proud but the look on Ross&rsquo; face made him worry instead. </p><p>&ldquo;My men are going to have a field day with you,&rdquo; He said pushing the hook in Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. As the Peter let out a yelp of pain Ross smiled as his men ready their tools. &ldquo;This going to be fun.&rdquo;</p><p>____</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t know what was worst, watching the men putting the hook into Peter&rsquo;s shoulder or the fact that his body looked like a hanging corpse. Ross&rsquo;s men didn&rsquo;t hold back, they threw everything they had into torture Peter. </p><p>Their fists were covered in metal knuckles and their punches definitely broke a few ribs. What scared Tony though was the high tech tasers that made Peter&rsquo;s body crumble in seconds. It only took one hit before his whole body seized in pain.</p><p>After another scream escaped Peter&rsquo;s lips Tony had enough. &ldquo;Stop! Just please stop!&rdquo; He begged wanting nothing more than to trade places with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything please!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look at this, Tony Stark begging to me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Please, just stop hurting him.&rdquo;</p><p>Ross laughed quietly taking a taser from one of his men. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony watched as turned the taser onto the highest setting. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a kid!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Ross pointed the taser at Peter&rsquo;s chest watching him whither in pain. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Peter cried. </p><p>Ross grabbed another taser putting in on the same place. </p><p>&ldquo;S-Stop please!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s body seized in pain as he gasped for air. His shoulder bleeding down his arm. His eyes grew heavy, his body until able to take the pain. Just as he let out another scream, Ross stopped putting down the taser.</p><p>Motioning to his men, Peter was lowered to the ground his body giving out from under him. Ross turned his body overstepping on his bad shoulder. Tony cringed at the sound of his kid&rsquo;s sobs. </p><p>&ldquo;Pull it out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-Wait,&rdquo; Peter gasped. </p><p>Before he could react, Ross&rsquo; men ripping the hook out. Peter screamed louder than when they put it in. Tony felt like he was going to puke at the blood pooling underneath his kid. </p><p>&ldquo;Hate to have a torture session if my subject is unconscious.&rdquo; Ross loosens Tony&rsquo;s restrains. &ldquo;Go comfort the kid he looks pathetic right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rushed over to his kid ignoring Ross leaving the room. Carefully, he picked Peter&rsquo;s body upsetting in in his lap trying to comfort him. He didn&rsquo;t care about the blood, he only cared about getting his kid out of here. </p><p>&ldquo;It hurts,&rdquo; Peter cried gripping onto Tony&rsquo;s shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Pete.&rdquo; Tony was on the verge of tears himself. </p><p><i>This was all his fault.</i></p><hr /><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSAoXn7rDKTQ-SDQxNVGeAg\">@winteriscomingidjits</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mANuzPF2mJ6WzfNF_feQprQ\">@lizgchamp</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2CKgaSTJTCjMH-zHQXoGzw\">@theflameofdeath</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo1EWywR0ccRgrmOc0jyBvQ\">@jaderbugz</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfoPV1Ui7yX-K4v94t3R7tg\">@queenmira29</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB-BRcATjRvvVf-wcKsaeiw\">@that-sokovian-bastard</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTL_fBdzW5DV5gqufjzLz9A\">@love-allthingsmarvel</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8gkvVO6zlA4ee95PGAYa-A\">@satanandblade</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU1QmiATgpQD5Iu2P2ERQBA\">@yourcaitlinraye</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqyi0AE8b8Vu4wbSPtRxApg\">@fanobsessed</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mewUy_XelSasFGtxS5vBRvQ\">@grantward3</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxFlKSjxkyTLa9S-0xos4YQ\">@camila1818</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6p1YEmE0Qbkr4Ns0UGLIcw\">@divergentseagreengirl</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2nW_T8ialWJHy7lteytuMg\">@bobbyrocha20</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxKW9HvPyrdXVuvoWeIyv3g\">@capbuckthor</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdn1sI03iVG0cTZly9hABww\">@buckysendoftheline</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmxj6dCflGVofFYyoOyBbmw\">@graysonmalfoy</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtTiaTbO-mBahLbup3actVw\">@8181pjh</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHMAe5ZiH1b_S3jsSSYUUtw\">@they-are-not-only-fandoms</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn0sfvpo23beszFoU6yfj7w\">@niyaslife13</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meerNkTiABW5dWq5OaCd1PA\">@queenshipper63</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m66FQFLkc7scpxt_GYjBmhQ\">@buckys-newarm</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miP3cE4YMZhN3GCzmU37_1A\">@dolan-hollander</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\">@theshortegg</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf1n848G1wIm0T4kZ_epceA\">@topjean</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDMxStN2oLDhlEHXolvQ3hg\">@hunters-from-stark-tower</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpRzNb0VH4mKtBGw_dURFSQ\">@fullofsasstiel</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6-bf6s2SIze9i8e1xmhBzg\">@ilovetvshowsblog</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m92sOrWGQh4fo_HHXwt_CJw\">@its-destiel-ass-butt</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml6gRKooUky0BvQACA69JuA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml6gRKooUky0BvQACA69JuA\">@muggle-who-lived</a>| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBVhlXxyikz14d7VOmFef4A\">@wronglanemendes</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtG0pLUGW0dDfFLts8cfM5g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtG0pLUGW0dDfFLts8cfM5g\">@loony-luju</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPaHUhIrm3xUpdbTJeQTVlg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPaHUhIrm3xUpdbTJeQTVlg\">@emilydiangelo</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnRyYF33YU6iDIALdO-UlPQ\">@the-last&ndash;time-saving</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/micVMIU8USJ0eVFNz1tipjw\">@omegatomato</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTnrA5UKprJ6EI9pTVYTs4Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTnrA5UKprJ6EI9pTVYTs4Q\">@liljeknott</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk9-afrd9aDF9NVAm-MnY3A\">@kirakatze</a></p><p>Whumptober Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZt7Oc9qpicqLlHjHPJpndA\">@parkrstark</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msKGQqv2ibLw0rJG3ybtpzg\">@dissupanatrlbish</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVfrjQbOKBs5jEcSgtp3vHQ\">@pookiethefrickinbunn</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNk_H7PLSRr0JI-13XShCrw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNk_H7PLSRr0JI-13XShCrw\">@thepanthatcanwithoutaplan</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-9L9VyDsvpkcqEL0n1m39g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-9L9VyDsvpkcqEL0n1m39g\">@a-distressed-fan</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbvm2sEzD6riXaeYhCZjLyQ\">@sunny-after-all</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfCUDDTejTVrMaDJAQlyw7g\">@wisehokte</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWc1e_Sxqybw1Ja9tHyf5OA\">@marvelwallet</a></p><p>Peter Parker Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMnjBH8VtbHN4L258wgqf7w\">@mainspidey</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX25ZtVXMCTRTmh1eOUU7Lg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX25ZtVXMCTRTmh1eOUU7Lg\">@mcheung0314</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m60ljilaA1xdYQ8l46fbpGg\">@marvelbased</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCWYPQdGnC8zqqRCJydNIQA\">@wtfwolfstar</a></p><p>Tony Stark Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1ybOYA-ncRK7OsGkgMgn2g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1ybOYA-ncRK7OsGkgMgn2g\">@dressed-up-just-like-z1ggy</a></p><h2>If anyone wants to be tagged just send an ask!</h2></p>",
