        "answer": "<p>I get where you\u2019re coming from, Anon, and I agree to some extent. However, the only POV that really feels <i>way</i> too old to me is Bran\u2019s. GRRM has said that he has trouble with Bran\u2019s POV the most because it\u2019s hard to write from the mind of someone that young, and yeah, it shows in his writing sometimes. Even with Bran, though, there are plenty of times when Bran sounds age appropriate (Like \u201cWhy would anyone kill Jory?\u201d or\u00a0\u201cHe sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them.\u201d)</p><p>But, you asked for examples, so here\u2019s my thoughts on it:</p><p>Jon\u2019s POV is age appropriate, to an extent. At the start of his story, he\u2019s an angsty, bratty teen with a good heart, and reads like it, for the most part.<br/></p><p>I think Sansa and Arya start off acting their age, for sure. Sansa\u2019s romanticism in the beginning of her arc is age appropriate, and written accordingly. I love that Arya calls everything and everyone \u201cstupid,\u201d and Sansa refers to her stomach as her \u201ctummy.\u201d Language like that definitely shows their age. Also, Sansa and Arya\u2019s sisterly beef with each other is written perfectly, considering their ages.</p><p>However, after Sansa goes through her trauma and has grown accustomed to being a prisoner, her POV matures in a way that, while fascinating to read, still feels a bit too\u00a0\u201cold\u201d sometimes in my opinion, if that makes sense. Like, she\u2019s just 13, but she tends to sound like someone in their later teens, and though that doesn\u2019t sound like a huge difference, the mind of someone who\u2019s 17-19 is far different from someone who just turned 13. I get why GRRM would do that, because trauma can definitely age a child, and it\u2019s beautiful writing, but I think sometimes it\u2019s just too old in how it reads. IIRC, though (correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m not a Sansa expert), she still calls her stomach her\u00a0\u201ctummy,\u201d so there\u2019s that. That word is associated with youth and innocence, so when Sansa starts saying\u00a0\u201cstomach\u201d or\u00a0\u201cbelly\u201d more than\u00a0\u201ctummy\u201d &hellip; I think it\u2019ll be kinda sad, because it will represent more of her lost/stolen innocence, due to her trauma.</p><p>I think George does a better job with making Arya still sound childish, even after she\u2019s traumatized. The way she thinks of her lost identity (\u201chad she dreamed Arya Stark?\u201d) gets the job done as far as storytelling and characterization goes, while saying it in a\u00a0\u201cchildish\u201d way.</p><p>Dany\u2019s POV is weird. Sometimes she sounds young \u2014 maybe not as young as 13, but considering her backstory, she\u2019s been forced to grow up long before the Stark children, so that makes sense. I think if her story started when she was 15 instead of 13, it would sound more\u00a0\u201cright,\u201d but honestly, with the whole dramatically written crush over Daario and the mistakes she makes as a ruler, I think you can tell that she\u2019s a teenager.</p><p>I think Theon\u2019s POV is age appropriate. He\u2019s college age, and acts like a particularly douchey frat boy. And when the Reek thing happens, he\u2019s old enough that the change in prose doesn\u2019t sound awkward. It\u2019s all written perfectly.</p><p>Also, if non-POV characters count, Tommen and Sweetrobin act pretty age appropriate. Myrcella feels like an intelligent child. I don\u2019t know, I think GRRM does a good job on this for the most part.\u00a0</p>",

That word is associated with youth and innocence, so when Sansa starts saying\u00a0\u201cstomach\u201d or\u00a0\u201cbelly\u201d more than\u00a0\u201ctummy\u201d \u2026 I think it\u2019ll be kinda sad, because it will represent more of her lost/stolen innocence, due to her trauma.</p><p>I think George does a better job with making Arya still sound childish, even after she\u2019s traumatized. The way she thinks of her lost identity (\u201chad she dreamed Arya Stark?\u201d) gets the job done as far as storytelling and characterization goes, while saying it in a\u00a0\u201cchildish\u201d way.</p><p>Dany\u2019s POV is weird. Sometimes she sounds young \u2014 maybe not as young as 13, but considering her backstory, she\u2019s been forced to grow up long before the Stark children, so that makes sense. I think if her story started when she was 15 instead of 13, it would sound more\u00a0\u201cright,\u201d but honestly, with the whole dramatically written crush over Daario and the mistakes she makes as a ruler, I think you can tell that she\u2019s a teenager.</p><p>I think Theon\u2019s POV is age appropriate.

                "content": "<p>I get where you&rsquo;re coming from, Anon, and I agree to some extent. However, the only POV that really feels <i>way</i> too old to me is Bran&rsquo;s. GRRM has said that he has trouble with Bran&rsquo;s POV the most because it&rsquo;s hard to write from the mind of someone that young, and yeah, it shows in his writing sometimes. Even with Bran, though, there are plenty of times when Bran sounds age appropriate (Like &ldquo;Why would anyone kill Jory?&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;He sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them.&rdquo;)</p><p>But, you asked for examples, so here&rsquo;s my thoughts on it:</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s POV is age appropriate, to an extent. At the start of his story, he&rsquo;s an angsty, bratty teen with a good heart, and reads like it, for the most part.<br /></p><p>I think Sansa and Arya start off acting their age, for sure. Sansa&rsquo;s romanticism in the beginning of her arc is age appropriate, and written accordingly. I love that Arya calls everything and everyone &ldquo;stupid,&rdquo; and Sansa refers to her stomach as her &ldquo;tummy.&rdquo; Language like that definitely shows their age. Also, Sansa and Arya&rsquo;s sisterly beef with each other is written perfectly, considering their ages.</p><p>However, after Sansa goes through her trauma and has grown accustomed to being a prisoner, her POV matures in a way that, while fascinating to read, still feels a bit too&nbsp;&ldquo;old&rdquo; sometimes in my opinion, if that makes sense. Like, she&rsquo;s just 13, but she tends to sound like someone in their later teens, and though that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a huge difference, the mind of someone who&rsquo;s 17-19 is far different from someone who just turned 13. I get why GRRM would do that, because trauma can definitely age a child, and it&rsquo;s beautiful writing, but I think sometimes it&rsquo;s just too old in how it reads. IIRC, though (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, I&rsquo;m not a Sansa expert), she still calls her stomach her&nbsp;&ldquo;tummy,&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s that. That word is associated with youth and innocence, so when Sansa starts saying&nbsp;&ldquo;stomach&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;belly&rdquo; more than&nbsp;&ldquo;tummy&rdquo; &hellip; I think it&rsquo;ll be kinda sad, because it will represent more of her lost/stolen innocence, due to her trauma.</p><p>I think George does a better job with making Arya still sound childish, even after she&rsquo;s traumatized. The way she thinks of her lost identity (&ldquo;had she dreamed Arya Stark?&rdquo;) gets the job done as far as storytelling and characterization goes, while saying it in a&nbsp;&ldquo;childish&rdquo; way.</p><p>Dany&rsquo;s POV is weird.

Your mother had brought you the best handmaidens out there to groom you for your first meeting to your betrothed.</p><p>You hated it. You felt a absolutely ridiculous with the gown they had chosen for you to wear today: it was a baby pink gown with very long sleeves you were afraid to step on. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless&rdquo; you thought. Your betrothed was from the noble House Stark, located in the North, you&rsquo;d have to wear a furry coat on top of it so you didn&rsquo;t die from the cold, no one was going to notice the dress.</p><p>That was not the worst thing. You almost begged your mother to let you wear something black. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous, we&rsquo;re not attending a funeral Y/N&rdquo; she said. </p><p>You wanted wear black because it&rsquo;s the color you felt comfortable with, now they were dressing you up like you were a doll. Sometimes you just wished you could look like your sisters, with their thin and delicate bodies. </p><p>That way people wouldn&rsquo;t give you &lsquo;looks&rsquo; while you&rsquo;re just walking around, whispering behind your back, thinking you can&rsquo;t hear them. And you couldn&rsquo;t. But you could imagine what they were saying. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s nothing like her mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;her sisters are so beautiful&rdquo;, &ldquo;she should take care of her self more&rdquo; </p><p>The list continued. The thing was: you didn&rsquo;t care, not anymore at least. You had grown as a woman, for the better; you didn&rsquo;t listen to what those people said because the only one who knew you really was yourself and that was more than enough for you. </p><p>The trip didn&rsquo;t take more than 2 days, your city wasn&rsquo;t so far from Winterfell so it was good. If you were nervous before, now you felt like dying. </p><p>Once the doors opened, you tried your best to take a look from inside the carriage. The Starks where the people standing at the front, you assumed. </p><p>There were only two boys, one of them had curly hair and beautiful eyes but he was holding hands with a woman; 'he&rsquo;s already married, that&rsquo;s not Bran Stark&rsquo;, you thought. The other one was blonde ish, but he was too young to be Bran, would your father be capable of marrying you with someone younger? </p><p>The Herald of Arms announced each member of your family. Once you were out of the carriage your father took your hand carefully and gave you a loving look. He might not be present most of the time but he was a great father and with that gesture you felt a little less nervous. </p><p>You found yourself about to pass out because of the nerves when you stood in front of the Starks. Your father and Lord Stark shared a hug, while your mother was greeted by Lady Stark. She was a beautiful woman, your thought. </p><p>When they finished talking your father reached to you, signaling you to take a step closer. </p><p>\u201cThis is my beautiful daughter, Y/N&quot; your father said and you felt like dying when everyone standing in front of you looked in your direction. </p><p>You looked down, not wanting to see their expressions, but you had to be polite. When you lifted your head, everyone had a smile on their faces, <i>honest smiles.</i> They made you feel so welcome you were in complete awe. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to Winterfell, Y/N&rdquo; Lord Stark reached to you and took your hand in his, giving you a smile, so genuine. </p><p>&ldquo;Please, let me introduce you to my son Bran&rdquo; you were ready to greet to young blonde boy but then he took step aside and you were able to see the boy sitting on a wheelchair, staring a you. You weren\u2019t really surprised but you felt kind of bad knowing that you hadn\u2019t acknowledged him before. </p><p>&ldquo;Lady Y/N, it&rsquo;s nice too meet you&rdquo; he said to you. He sounded so sincere, you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile widely at him. </p><p>The day went by, while both families were sharing a fest. Bran and you tried several times to star a conversation but the music was so loud, you just couldn\u2019t hear each other. He suggested you to join him for a walk so he could show you Winterfell around. Of course you said yes. </p><p>Bran showed you every little thing. Winterfell was incredibly beautiful, it wasn&rsquo;t very far from your city but it was surprisingly different, the architecture was breathtaking and what surprised you the most was the dire wolves running around like dogs. The weather was also different, you weren\u2019t used to this much cold. </p><p>You had to carry him around but you didn&rsquo;t care, you had so much fun with him and it was so easy to start conversation, there were no uncomfortable silences. </p><p>When you were finishing your little tour, you reached the Weirwood, your family was devoted to the Old Gods too so you were familiar with it and even though you had seen paintings of this tree from your maester&rsquo;s book several times, clearly it didn\u2019t compare to see it in all its glory. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s so beautiful, I&rsquo;ve never seen one of them&rdquo; you looked at Bran and he was smiling at you. </p><p>Your felt the heat on your cheeks. You were stupidly surprised by a tree. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;ve just&hellip; I&rsquo;ve just never seen one of them and I grew up with stories about the Old Gods, I got a little excited&rdquo; you sat next to him. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Y/N, really, I like that you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself, this will be your home soon&rdquo; he said and you looked at him, he was a beautiful boy for sure: pale skin that looked so soft and pink lips, he was actually breathtaking and you suddenly felt bad for him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry&rdquo; you blurted. </p><p>Bran looked at you with a confused expression. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re betrothed to me, there are plenty of better options.&rdquo; </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t dare to look at him but you were surprised when he took your hand and interlaced your fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N please, look at me&rdquo; </p><p>Slowly, you did. He was looking at you tenderly, and when you connected your eyes with his, you both smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful, and I don&rsquo;t really need five years of marriage to know you&rsquo;re a very fun person with an amazing personality, our little Winterfell tour was all I needed to know I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m betrothed to you&rdquo; you didn&rsquo;t want to, but you could feel the tears about to enter the scene &ldquo;Look at me, I&rsquo;m a cripple, but I know I&rsquo;m so much more. And there&rsquo;s you, you don&rsquo;t have to look like every girl to be breathtaking, you already are&rdquo; you couldn&rsquo;t help it you hugged him tightly and he embraced you letting out a little laugh.  </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an amazing person Bran Stark&rdquo; you said to and then realized you were inches apart when you said so. He looked at you intently. </p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a beautiful girl and a good person, I&rsquo;m thankful I get to marry you soon&rdquo; the two of you stared at each other, wondering if it was okay. You surely didn&rsquo;t want to rush things, you had meet him not so long ago but he already had your heart. </p><p>No one ever, who wasn&rsquo;t a part of your family, was interested on knowing you and then Bran came in the picture all of a sudden, appreciating you for who you were and not asking for more or less. </p><p>And you did the same for him. Because you were able to see more than Bran the cripple, he was so much more and he was your future husband. </p><p>You stared into each other eyes and then Bran closed the distance between the two of you. His lips were soft against yours, and moved slowly, one of his hands was caressing your cheek lovingly, you never expected for this to happen, it felt unreal.  </p><p>But right in this boy&rsquo;s arms you felt safe. You felt home</p>",

Your mother had brought you the best handmaidens out there to groom you for your first meeting to your betrothed.</p><p>You hated it. You felt a absolutely ridiculous with the gown they had chosen for you to wear today: it was a baby pink gown with very long sleeves you were afraid to step on. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless\u201d you thought. Your betrothed was from the noble House Stark, located in the North, you\u2019d have to wear a furry coat on top of it so you didn\u2019t die from the cold, no one was going to notice the dress.</p><p>That was not the worst thing. You almost begged your mother to let you wear something black. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, we\u2019re not attending a funeral Y/N\u201d she said. </p><p>You wanted wear black because it\u2019s the color you felt comfortable with, now they were dressing you up like you were a doll. Sometimes you just wished you could look like your sisters, with their thin and delicate bodies. </p><p>That way people wouldn\u2019t give you \u2018looks\u2019 while you\u2019re just walking around, whispering behind your back, thinking you can\u2019t hear them. And you couldn\u2019t. But you could imagine what they were saying. </p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s nothing like her mother\u201d, \u201cher sisters are so beautiful\u201d, \u201cshe should take care of her self more\u201d </p><p>The list continued. The thing was: you didn\u2019t care, not anymore at least. You had grown as a woman, for the better; you didn\u2019t listen to what those people said because the only one who knew you really was yourself and that was more than enough for you. </p><p>The trip didn\u2019t take more than 2 days, your city wasn\u2019t so far from Winterfell so it was good. If you were nervous before, now you felt like dying. </p><p>Once the doors opened, you tried your best to take a look from inside the carriage. The Starks where the people standing at the front, you assumed. </p><p>There were only two boys, one of them had curly hair and beautiful eyes but he was holding hands with a woman; 'he\u2019s already married, that\u2019s not Bran Stark\u2019, you thought. The other one was blonde ish, but he was too young to be Bran, would your father be capable of marrying you with someone younger? </p><p>The Herald of Arms announced each member of your family. Once you were out of the carriage your father took your hand carefully and gave you a loving look. He might not be present most of the time but he was a great father and with that gesture you felt a little less nervous. </p><p>You found yourself about to pass out because of the nerves when you stood in front of the Starks. Your father and Lord Stark shared a hug, while your mother was greeted by Lady Stark. She was a beautiful woman, your thought. </p><p>When they finished talking your father reached to you, signaling you to take a step closer. </p><p>\u201cThis is my beautiful daughter, Y/N\" your father said and you felt like dying when everyone standing in front of you looked in your direction. </p><p>You looked down, not wanting to see their expressions, but you had to be polite. When you lifted your head, everyone had a smile on their faces, <i>honest smiles.</i> They made you feel so welcome you were in complete awe. </p><p>\u201cWelcome to Winterfell, Y/N\u201d Lord Stark reached to you and took your hand in his, giving you a smile, so genuine. </p><p>\u201cPlease, let me introduce you to my son Bran\u201d you were ready to greet to young blonde boy but then he took step aside and you were able to see the boy sitting on a wheelchair, staring a you. You weren\u2019t really surprised but you felt kind of bad knowing that you hadn\u2019t acknowledged him before. </p><p>\u201cLady Y/N, it\u2019s nice too meet you\u201d he said to you. He sounded so sincere, you couldn\u2019t help but smile widely at him. </p><p>The day went by, while both families were sharing a fest. Bran and you tried several times to star a conversation but the music was so loud, you just couldn\u2019t hear each other. He suggested you to join him for a walk so he could show you Winterfell around. Of course you said yes. </p><p>Bran showed you every little thing. Winterfell was incredibly beautiful, it wasn\u2019t very far from your city but it was surprisingly different, the architecture was breathtaking and what surprised you the most was the dire wolves running around like dogs. The weather was also different, you weren\u2019t used to this much cold. </p><p>You had to carry him around but you didn\u2019t care, you had so much fun with him and it was so easy to start conversation, there were no uncomfortable silences. </p><p>When you were finishing your little tour, you reached the Weirwood, your family was devoted to the Old Gods too so you were familiar with it and even though you had seen paintings of this tree from your maester\u2019s book several times, clearly it didn\u2019t compare to see it in all its glory. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s so beautiful, I\u2019ve never seen one of them\u201d you looked at Bran and he was smiling at you. </p><p>Your felt the heat on your cheeks. You were stupidly surprised by a tree. </p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve just\u2026 I\u2019ve just never seen one of them and I grew up with stories about the Old Gods, I got a little excited\u201d you sat next to him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Y/N, really, I like that you\u2019re enjoying yourself, this will be your home soon\u201d he said and you looked at him, he was a beautiful boy for sure: pale skin that looked so soft and pink lips, he was actually breathtaking and you suddenly felt bad for him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u201d you blurted. </p><p>Bran looked at you with a confused expression. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re betrothed to me, there are plenty of better options.\u201d </p><p>You didn\u2019t dare to look at him but you were surprised when he took your hand and interlaced your fingers. </p><p>\u201cY/N please, look at me\u201d </p><p>Slowly, you did. He was looking at you tenderly, and when you connected your eyes with his, you both smiled. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, and I don\u2019t really need five years of marriage to know you\u2019re a very fun person with an amazing personality, our little Winterfell tour was all I needed to know I\u2019m glad I\u2019m betrothed to you\u201d you didn\u2019t want to, but you could feel the tears about to enter the scene \u201cLook at me, I\u2019m a cripple, but I know I\u2019m so much more. And there\u2019s you, you don\u2019t have to look like every girl to be breathtaking, you already are\u201d you couldn\u2019t help it you hugged him tightly and he embraced you letting out a little laugh.  </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an amazing person Bran Stark\u201d you said to and then realized you were inches apart when you said so. He looked at you intently. </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a beautiful girl and a good person, I\u2019m thankful I get to marry you soon\u201d the two of you stared at each other, wondering if it was okay. You surely didn\u2019t want to rush things, you had meet him not so long ago but he already had your heart. </p><p>No one ever, who wasn\u2019t a part of your family, was interested on knowing you and then Bran came in the picture all of a sudden, appreciating you for who you were and not asking for more or less. </p><p>And you did the same for him.

        "answer": "<p>Warging into dragons would be supremely difficult, since dragons have been established to be some of the most intelligent and dangerous creatures within the <i>ASOIAF</i> world.

You may have been a girl from the North, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you had to love the cold.</p><p>\u201cThe lilies are beginning to bloom,\u201d you said with a gesture to the pink blossoms.\u00a0\u201cThey look so beautiful.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot as beautiful as you, my dear,\u201d replied your fiance Bran. As Queen-To-Be you took it upon yourself to brighten up the Red Keep yourself. While the builders worked on restoring the inside of the building, you got your hands dirty in the garden. You may have earned yourself a sunburn or two, but you didn\u2019t mind so long as something beautiful could grow again in King\u2019s Landing. After the battle most of the plants were destroyed, either burned or covered in ash and debris. Finally, the new seeds were blooming vibrantly.<br/></p><p>As you came to the end of the garden path you saw a short figure making his way towards the two of you.</p><p>\u201cLord Tyrion, how lovely to see you on this fine morning.\u201d You say with a smile. Tyrion smiles a small smile in return.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt is lovely to see you as well, Lady Y/N. I would like to congratulate you on how the garden is coming, I must admit that the lavender blooms are my favorite.\u201d You beamed at the compliment.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not just here to admire your handiwork though, I have come to remind your fiance about the small council meeting that started nearly twenty minutes ago.\u201d He shot a sharp look at Bran.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d You exclaimed as you flushed.\u00a0\u201cThat was all my fault! I lost track of time showing Bran around the gardens, I am so sorry Tyrion.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright Darling, I forgot as well.\u201d Said Bran comfortingly, looking up at you with those deep eyes you loved yo much. He reached back to grab your hand in his. Tyrion looked at Bran knowingly; Bran does not forget.<br/></p><p>Podrick came up to assist Bran to the small council chamber, and you began making your way through the castle. While your future husband worked on fixing the political climate of the six kingdoms, you took it upon yourself to renew the beauty of the Red Keep and King\u2019s Landing. You made many trips around the halls, looking for projects to be done. Just last week you had commissioned a series of paintings to hang in the new throne room when it was finished. You wanted scenes of the war to be depicted, both good and bad. This way future generations would have a reminder of the horror right in the room in which they ruled.</p><p>As you meandered down the corridors for a considerable amount of time until you began to hear a small commotion coming from one of the rooms. The closer you got to the room, the more apparent it became that it was full of ladies from the court, chattering and occasionally roaring with laughter. You had never really fit in with the rest of the ladies, but you figured it was worth a shot to try. After all, as Queen you would have to interact with these ladies much more frequently. You began to enter the room, but stopped dead in your tracks as their words found their way to your ears.</p><p>\u201cI bet he doesn\u2019t really even like her,\u201d said one of the ladies as the rest had giggled. <i>They could be talking about anyone,</i>\u00a0you reminded yourself from your place in the doorway. However, you had a knowing, sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach. You decided to listen in but not move, as they had not noticed you quite yet.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t!\u201d Yelled one women as they all erupted into chuckles.\u00a0\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like anyone! He\u2019s the\u00a0\u2018three-eyed-raven\u2019 who doesn\u2019t want!\u201d The woman did a horrendous impression of Bran at the end, making tears spring to your eyes. Not only were they mocking Bran, but also speaking of his false love for you.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want, how could he want her? If he is just choosing at random, he could have at least chosen somebody beautiful.\u201d The tears threatened to slip.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if she is so stupid that she is unaware of how insincere his affection towards her.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd it is as if you are all so stupid that you are unaware of your surroundings,\u201d you said, mustering all your courage so that it did not sound as if you were on the verge of tears. It worked, making all the ladies turn towards you with a gasp. Their reaction spurred you on, taking on a cold demeanor.\u00a0\u201cYou speak of the future Queen behind her back as if she is not there. Though, of course, you had assumed that I was not. Perhaps you should have taken notice of who was entering the room instead of carrying on like children.\u201d<br/></p><p>Despite gossiping about you mere seconds ago, this shift in your personality left them speechless and wide-eyed. You held the power, and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cDo not talk about me and my husband-to-be like this again, or there will be consequences.\u201d Your delivery rivaled even Cersei\u2019s, surprising you with just how cold and calculated the words sounded coming from your lips. The ladies nodded, hurrying to leave the room.\u00a0<br/></p><p>As they left, you too began the walk back to your chambers. It was getting rather late anyway, and the sun was beginning its descent through the sky as the moon began to appear. You slowly made your way back down the corridor to your bedroom. With every step you took, the bravado began to fade and the doubt began to surge through your mind again. The ladies were right. As the Three-Eyed-Raven, Bran was free from earthly wants and desires. It is what made him a good King; he is not selfish or greedy.\u00a0 But you had not thought about what that meant for the two of you.</p><p>You had met as children, running around and getting into loads of trouble when your father would make his monthly visits to Winterfell. House (L/N) may be a small house, but it is a house of proud Northerners who used their closeness to the Lord and Lady Stark to their advantage. You looked back on those memories fondly. Bran and you would always climb anything you could get your hands and feet on, and you would always have to endure a scolding from your father afterwards. You never minded the trouble, so long as you got to hang out with your best friend.\u00a0</p><p>When you heard of Bran\u2019s fall, you fell to your knees and cried. You thought that your friend would die. By some miracle of the Gods he did not, and you went to visit him as he lie in bed. You were told he would never walk again, and you knew that your climbing days were over. You didn\u2019t mind. All you wanted was to spend time with him, whatever way you could.</p><p>The visits to the Starks became less frequent after Ned left for King\u2019s Landing. After his execution, your father raced to Winterfell to help Robb and his army in any way that he could. You got to accompany him, but after Theon returned to take Winterfell you were whisked away to the Riverlands. You were informed of Bran and Rickard\u2019s passing weeks later, falling into a deep lull for many months.</p><p>As Sansa and the other Starks returned to Winterfell years later, you returned as well. You reunited with Bran, feeling something special spark as your eyes landed on him for the first time in years. It was more than just seeing an old friend. In fact, it was even more than just seeing your best childhood friend who you had believed was dead for years It was as if you were seeing your soulmate.</p><p>Now looking back on that memory, the way you felt, you realized that it may have been one-sided. You knew that he did not desire as he had before disappearing behind the wall, but you thought that you were different. You thought that he had loved you. Maybe instead he was able to read you like a book, realizing that you would be the easiest to have by his side because you would be there out of devotion instead of greed. Perhaps you were merely the most convenient.</p><p>Tears made their way from your eyes and down your cheeks as you finally reached the door, closing it behind you. To your surprise, Bran was already inside. You must have wandered the castle halls for longer than you thought. He turned his chair from where he had been sitting at the window so that he could face you.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong, my dear?\u201d He asked, using his arms to wheel his way over to you. Despite your obvious unhappiness, you did not want to admit to him your weakness.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Bran,\u2019 you replied. He cocked his head.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou never call me that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell it is your name.\u201d<br/></p><p>You began to get ready for bed, feeling Bran\u2019s eyes on you as you did so.</p><p>\u201cMy love, I cannot help you unless you tell me what is wrong.\u201d He said. You could hear the pain in his voice.<br/></p><p>\u201cAs if you couldn\u2019t just read my mind,\u201d you retort hotly. Bran let out a sigh.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know that I promised never to do that to you, Y/N. You know that I love you and I respect your privacy. I would never use my greensight against you to see what has happened to make you so upset. I want you to tell me yourself if you decide to of your own accord.\u201d<br/></p><p>You took a deep, shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cBut do you?\u201d You asked. Bran furrowed his brows.</p><p>\u201cDo I what, Y/N?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou said you love me. Do you?\u201d The tears began again, leaving hot trails on your face. His face fell. He reached out to you, pulling you to him so that you sat sideways across his lap. He held you with one arm as he wiped the tears as they fell from your eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, my dear. You are so special to me. You are a light shining in my life every day and I am lucky to be able to call you my own. What would make you think that I may feel any other way about you?\u201d Bran stared into your eyes and you knew he was telling the truth. His eyes were full of love and devotion, and you knew it. You leaned against his chest.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Three-Eyed-Raven,\u201d you say.<br/></p><p>\u201cDoes that make me any less your fiance as well?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, but it means that you do not have wants as normal people do.\u201d<br/></p><p>Realizing what you thought, Bran pulling you into a tight hug, caressing your hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are right Y/N, I do not desire things as I did before I was pushed from that tower. But that does not mean that I do not desire you.\u201d<br/></p><p>You pulled back from him, looking into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI may not want land, or wealth, or power, and I may not desire in the same way. But you, my darling,\u201d said Bran, looking at you with admiration,\u00a0\u201care my exception. I want you more than anyone could ever want anything. The first time I saw you again after the start of the war I felt something change in me. You sparked desire that I thought I could never feel. I have full faith that fate brought us together, whether because I am the Three-Eyed-Raven or in spite of that. I do love you Y/N, with all of my heart.\u201d<br/></p><p>You crashed your lips to Bran\u2019s, his moving in sync with yours as you moved your body to straddle him instead of sitting sideways.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too Bran,\u201d you said between kisses as you pulled back for air. He wheeled the two of you towards the bed that you shared, making you squeal and wrap your arms around his neck so that you wouldn\u2019t fall.</p><p>\u201cCome love, let\u2019s get into bed so that I may lay with the woman I love. My fiancee.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBran, that was rather cheesy. Especially for you.\u201d He smiled up at you as you helped him into bed, sliding in beside him and letting his arms wrap around you.</p><p>\u201cBut you loved it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMy love, if you don\u2019t hush up I won\u2019t help you get up in the morning and you\u2019ll be stuck here all day.\u201d You retort with a blush.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel woman,\u201d he teased.\u00a0\u201cBut I love you anyway.\u201d<br/></p><p>You turned to face him and see his smiling face. You snuggled closer to his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you too, my dear.\u201d<br/></p>",

You may have been a girl from the North, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you had to love the cold.</p><p>\u201cThe lilies are beginning to bloom,\u201d you said with a gesture to the pink blossoms.\u00a0\u201cThey look so beautiful.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot as beautiful as you, my dear,\u201d replied your fiance Bran. As Queen-To-Be you took it upon yourself to brighten up the Red Keep yourself. While the builders worked on restoring the inside of the building, you got your hands dirty in the garden. You may have earned yourself a sunburn or two, but you didn\u2019t mind so long as something beautiful could grow again in King\u2019s Landing. After the battle most of the plants were destroyed, either burned or covered in ash and debris. Finally, the new seeds were blooming vibrantly.<br></p><p>As you came to the end of the garden path you saw a short figure making his way towards the two of you.</p><p>\u201cLord Tyrion, how lovely to see you on this fine morning.\u201d You say with a smile. Tyrion smiles a small smile in return.<br></p><p>\u201cIt is lovely to see you as well, Lady Y/N. I would like to congratulate you on how the garden is coming, I must admit that the lavender blooms are my favorite.\u201d You beamed at the compliment.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not just here to admire your handiwork though, I have come to remind your fiance about the small council meeting that started nearly twenty minutes ago.\u201d He shot a sharp look at Bran.<br></p><p>\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d You exclaimed as you flushed.\u00a0\u201cThat was all my fault! I lost track of time showing Bran around the gardens, I am so sorry Tyrion.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright Darling, I forgot as well.\u201d Said Bran comfortingly, looking up at you with those deep eyes you loved yo much. He reached back to grab your hand in his. Tyrion looked at Bran knowingly; Bran does not forget.<br></p><p>Podrick came up to assist Bran to the small council chamber, and you began making your way through the castle. While your future husband worked on fixing the political climate of the six kingdoms, you took it upon yourself to renew the beauty of the Red Keep and King\u2019s Landing. You made many trips around the halls, looking for projects to be done. Just last week you had commissioned a series of paintings to hang in the new throne room when it was finished. You wanted scenes of the war to be depicted, both good and bad. This way future generations would have a reminder of the horror right in the room in which they ruled.</p><p>As you meandered down the corridors for a considerable amount of time until you began to hear a small commotion coming from one of the rooms. The closer you got to the room, the more apparent it became that it was full of ladies from the court, chattering and occasionally roaring with laughter. You had never really fit in with the rest of the ladies, but you figured it was worth a shot to try. After all, as Queen you would have to interact with these ladies much more frequently. You began to enter the room, but stopped dead in your tracks as their words found their way to your ears.</p><p>\u201cI bet he doesn\u2019t really even like her,\u201d said one of the ladies as the rest had giggled. <i>They could be talking about anyone,</i>\u00a0you reminded yourself from your place in the doorway. However, you had a knowing, sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach. You decided to listen in but not move, as they had not noticed you quite yet.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t!\u201d Yelled one women as they all erupted into chuckles.\u00a0\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like anyone! He\u2019s the\u00a0\u2018three-eyed-raven\u2019 who doesn\u2019t want!\u201d The woman did a horrendous impression of Bran at the end, making tears spring to your eyes. Not only were they mocking Bran, but also speaking of his false love for you.<br></p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want, how could he want her? If he is just choosing at random, he could have at least chosen somebody beautiful.\u201d The tears threatened to slip.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if she is so stupid that she is unaware of how insincere his affection towards her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd it is as if you are all so stupid that you are unaware of your surroundings,\u201d you said, mustering all your courage so that it did not sound as if you were on the verge of tears. It worked, making all the ladies turn towards you with a gasp. Their reaction spurred you on, taking on a cold demeanor.\u00a0\u201cYou speak of the future Queen behind her back as if she is not there. Though, of course, you had assumed that I was not. Perhaps you should have taken notice of who was entering the room instead of carrying on like children.\u201d<br></p><p>Despite gossiping about you mere seconds ago, this shift in your personality left them speechless and wide-eyed. You held the power, and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cDo not talk about me and my husband-to-be like this again, or there will be consequences.\u201d Your delivery rivaled even Cersei\u2019s, surprising you with just how cold and calculated the words sounded coming from your lips. The ladies nodded, hurrying to leave the room.\u00a0<br></p><p>As they left, you too began the walk back to your chambers. It was getting rather late anyway, and the sun was beginning its descent through the sky as the moon began to appear. You slowly made your way back down the corridor to your bedroom. With every step you took, the bravado began to fade and the doubt began to surge through your mind again. The ladies were right. As the Three-Eyed-Raven, Bran was free from earthly wants and desires. It is what made him a good King; he is not selfish or greedy.\u00a0 But you had not thought about what that meant for the two of you.</p><p>You had met as children, running around and getting into loads of trouble when your father would make his monthly visits to Winterfell. House (L/N) may be a small house, but it is a house of proud Northerners who used their closeness to the Lord and Lady Stark to their advantage. You looked back on those memories fondly. Bran and you would always climb anything you could get your hands and feet on, and you would always have to endure a scolding from your father afterwards. You never minded the trouble, so long as you got to hang out with your best friend.\u00a0</p><p>When you heard of Bran\u2019s fall, you fell to your knees and cried. You thought that your friend would die. By some miracle of the Gods he did not, and you went to visit him as he lie in bed. You were told he would never walk again, and you knew that your climbing days were over. You didn\u2019t mind. All you wanted was to spend time with him, whatever way you could.</p><p>The visits to the Starks became less frequent after Ned left for King\u2019s Landing. After his execution, your father raced to Winterfell to help Robb and his army in any way that he could. You got to accompany him, but after Theon returned to take Winterfell you were whisked away to the Riverlands. You were informed of Bran and Rickard\u2019s passing weeks later, falling into a deep lull for many months.</p><p>As Sansa and the other Starks returned to Winterfell years later, you returned as well. You reunited with Bran, feeling something special spark as your eyes landed on him for the first time in years. It was more than just seeing an old friend. In fact, it was even more than just seeing your best childhood friend who you had believed was dead for years It was as if you were seeing your soulmate.</p><p>Now looking back on that memory, the way you felt, you realized that it may have been one-sided. You knew that he did not desire as he had before disappearing behind the wall, but you thought that you were different. You thought that he had loved you. Maybe instead he was able to read you like a book, realizing that you would be the easiest to have by his side because you would be there out of devotion instead of greed. Perhaps you were merely the most convenient.</p><p>Tears made their way from your eyes and down your cheeks as you finally reached the door, closing it behind you. To your surprise, Bran was already inside. You must have wandered the castle halls for longer than you thought. He turned his chair from where he had been sitting at the window so that he could face you.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong, my dear?\u201d He asked, using his arms to wheel his way over to you. Despite your obvious unhappiness, you did not want to admit to him your weakness.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Bran,\u2019 you replied.

He\u2019s the\u00a0\u2018three-eyed-raven\u2019 who doesn\u2019t want!\u201d The woman did a horrendous impression of Bran at the end, making tears spring to your eyes. Not only were they mocking Bran, but also speaking of his false love for you.<br></p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want, how could he want her? If he is just choosing at random, he could have at least chosen somebody beautiful.\u201d The tears threatened to slip.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if she is so stupid that she is unaware of how insincere his affection towards her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd it is as if you are all so stupid that you are unaware of your surroundings,\u201d you said, mustering all your courage so that it did not sound as if you were on the verge of tears. It worked, making all the ladies turn towards you with a gasp. Their reaction spurred you on, taking on a cold demeanor.\u00a0\u201cYou speak of the future Queen behind her back as if she is not there. Though, of course, you had assumed that I was not. Perhaps you should have taken notice of who was entering the room instead of carrying on like children.\u201d<br></p><p>Despite gossiping about you mere seconds ago, this shift in your personality left them speechless and wide-eyed. You held the power, and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cDo not talk about me and my husband-to-be like this again, or there will be consequences.\u201d Your delivery rivaled even Cersei\u2019s, surprising you with just how cold and calculated the words sounded coming from your lips. The ladies nodded, hurrying to leave the room.\u00a0<br></p><p>As they left, you too began the walk back to your chambers. It was getting rather late anyway, and the sun was beginning its descent through the sky as the moon began to appear. You slowly made your way back down the corridor to your bedroom. With every step you took, the bravado began to fade and the doubt began to surge through your mind again. The ladies were right. As the Three-Eyed-Raven, Bran was free from earthly wants and desires. It is what made him a good King; he is not selfish or greedy.\u00a0 But you had not thought about what that meant for the two of you.</p><p>You had met as children, running around and getting into loads of trouble when your father would make his monthly visits to Winterfell. House (L/N) may be a small house, but it is a house of proud Northerners who used their closeness to the Lord and Lady Stark to their advantage. You looked back on those memories fondly. Bran and you would always climb anything you could get your hands and feet on, and you would always have to endure a scolding from your father afterwards. You never minded the trouble, so long as you got to hang out with your best friend.\u00a0</p><p>When you heard of Bran\u2019s fall, you fell to your knees and cried. You thought that your friend would die. By some miracle of the Gods he did not, and you went to visit him as he lie in bed. You were told he would never walk again, and you knew that your climbing days were over. You didn\u2019t mind. All you wanted was to spend time with him, whatever way you could.</p><p>The visits to the Starks became less frequent after Ned left for King\u2019s Landing. After his execution, your father raced to Winterfell to help Robb and his army in any way that he could. You got to accompany him, but after Theon returned to take Winterfell you were whisked away to the Riverlands. You were informed of Bran and Rickard\u2019s passing weeks later, falling into a deep lull for many months.</p><p>As Sansa and the other Starks returned to Winterfell years later, you returned as well. You reunited with Bran, feeling something special spark as your eyes landed on him for the first time in years. It was more than just seeing an old friend. In fact, it was even more than just seeing your best childhood friend who you had believed was dead for years It was as if you were seeing your soulmate.</p><p>Now looking back on that memory, the way you felt, you realized that it may have been one-sided. You knew that he did not desire as he had before disappearing behind the wall, but you thought that you were different. You thought that he had loved you. Maybe instead he was able to read you like a book, realizing that you would be the easiest to have by his side because you would be there out of devotion instead of greed. Perhaps you were merely the most convenient.</p><p>Tears made their way from your eyes and down your cheeks as you finally reached the door, closing it behind you. To your surprise, Bran was already inside. You must have wandered the castle halls for longer than you thought. He turned his chair from where he had been sitting at the window so that he could face you.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong, my dear?\u201d He asked, using his arms to wheel his way over to you. Despite your obvious unhappiness, you did not want to admit to him your weakness.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Bran,\u2019 you replied. He cocked his head.<br></p><p>\u201cYou never call me that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell it is your name.\u201d<br></p><p>You began to get ready for bed, feeling Bran\u2019s eyes on you as you did so.</p><p>\u201cMy love, I cannot help you unless you tell me what is wrong.\u201d He said. You could hear the pain in his voice.<br></p><p>\u201cAs if you couldn\u2019t just read my mind,\u201d you retort hotly. Bran let out a sigh.<br></p><p>\u201cYou know that I promised never to do that to you, Y/N. You know that I love you and I respect your privacy. I would never use my greensight against you to see what has happened to make you so upset. I want you to tell me yourself if you decide to of your own accord.\u201d<br></p><p>You took a deep, shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cBut do you?\u201d You asked. Bran furrowed his brows.</p><p>\u201cDo I what, Y/N?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou said you love me. Do you?\u201d The tears began again, leaving hot trails on your face. His face fell. He reached out to you, pulling you to him so that you sat sideways across his lap. He held you with one arm as he wiped the tears as they fell from your eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, my dear. You are so special to me. You are a light shining in my life every day and I am lucky to be able to call you my own. What would make you think that I may feel any other way about you?\u201d Bran stared into your eyes and you knew he was telling the truth. His eyes were full of love and devotion, and you knew it. You leaned against his chest.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Three-Eyed-Raven,\u201d you say.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes that make me any less your fiance as well?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, but it means that you do not have wants as normal people do.\u201d<br></p><p>Realizing what you thought, Bran pulling you into a tight hug, caressing your hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are right Y/N, I do not desire things as I did before I was pushed from that tower. But that does not mean that I do not desire you.\u201d<br></p><p>You pulled back from him, looking into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI may not want land, or wealth, or power, and I may not desire in the same way. But you, my darling,\u201d said Bran, looking at you with admiration,\u00a0\u201care my exception. I want you more than anyone could ever want anything. The first time I saw you again after the start of the war I felt something change in me. You sparked desire that I thought I could never feel. I have full faith that fate brought us together, whether because I am the Three-Eyed-Raven or in spite of that. I do love you Y/N, with all of my heart.\u201d<br></p><p>You crashed your lips to Bran\u2019s, his moving in sync with yours as you moved your body to straddle him instead of sitting sideways.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too Bran,\u201d you said between kisses as you pulled back for air. He wheeled the two of you towards the bed that you shared, making you squeal and wrap your arms around his neck so that you wouldn\u2019t fall.</p><p>\u201cCome love, let\u2019s get into bed so that I may lay with the woman I love. My fiancee.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBran, that was rather cheesy. Especially for you.\u201d He smiled up at you as you helped him into bed, sliding in beside him and letting his arms wrap around you.</p><p>\u201cBut you loved it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMy love, if you don\u2019t hush up I won\u2019t help you get up in the morning and you\u2019ll be stuck here all day.\u201d You retort with a blush.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel woman,\u201d he teased.\u00a0\u201cBut I love you anyway.\u201d<br></p><p>You turned to face him and see his smiling face. You snuggled closer to his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you too, my dear.\u201d<br></p>",

You may have been a girl from the North, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you had to love the cold.</p><p>&ldquo;The lilies are beginning to bloom,&rdquo; you said with a gesture to the pink blossoms.&nbsp;&ldquo;They look so beautiful.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not as beautiful as you, my dear,&rdquo; replied your fiance Bran. As Queen-To-Be you took it upon yourself to brighten up the Red Keep yourself. While the builders worked on restoring the inside of the building, you got your hands dirty in the garden. You may have earned yourself a sunburn or two, but you didn&rsquo;t mind so long as something beautiful could grow again in King&rsquo;s Landing. After the battle most of the plants were destroyed, either burned or covered in ash and debris. Finally, the new seeds were blooming vibrantly.<br /></p><p>As you came to the end of the garden path you saw a short figure making his way towards the two of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Lord Tyrion, how lovely to see you on this fine morning.&rdquo; You say with a smile. Tyrion smiles a small smile in return.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It is lovely to see you as well, Lady Y/N. I would like to congratulate you on how the garden is coming, I must admit that the lavender blooms are my favorite.&rdquo; You beamed at the compliment.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just here to admire your handiwork though, I have come to remind your fiance about the small council meeting that started nearly twenty minutes ago.&rdquo; He shot a sharp look at Bran.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my goodness!&rdquo; You exclaimed as you flushed.&nbsp;&ldquo;That was all my fault! I lost track of time showing Bran around the gardens, I am so sorry Tyrion.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright Darling, I forgot as well.&rdquo; Said Bran comfortingly, looking up at you with those deep eyes you loved yo much. He reached back to grab your hand in his. Tyrion looked at Bran knowingly; Bran does not forget.<br /></p><p>Podrick came up to assist Bran to the small council chamber, and you began making your way through the castle. While your future husband worked on fixing the political climate of the six kingdoms, you took it upon yourself to renew the beauty of the Red Keep and King&rsquo;s Landing. You made many trips around the halls, looking for projects to be done. Just last week you had commissioned a series of paintings to hang in the new throne room when it was finished. You wanted scenes of the war to be depicted, both good and bad. This way future generations would have a reminder of the horror right in the room in which they ruled.</p><p>As you meandered down the corridors for a considerable amount of time until you began to hear a small commotion coming from one of the rooms. The closer you got to the room, the more apparent it became that it was full of ladies from the court, chattering and occasionally roaring with laughter. You had never really fit in with the rest of the ladies, but you figured it was worth a shot to try. After all, as Queen you would have to interact with these ladies much more frequently. You began to enter the room, but stopped dead in your tracks as their words found their way to your ears.</p><p>&ldquo;I bet he doesn&rsquo;t really even like her,&rdquo; said one of the ladies as the rest had giggled. <i>They could be talking about anyone,</i>&nbsp;you reminded yourself from your place in the doorway. However, you had a knowing, sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach. You decided to listen in but not move, as they had not noticed you quite yet.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course he doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Yelled one women as they all erupted into chuckles.&nbsp;&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like anyone!
