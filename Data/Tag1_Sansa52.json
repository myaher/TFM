He had his soldiers attack Kings Landing and slaughter and rape everyone. He instructed the Mountain to slaughter babies as they slept. When Tyrion was captured he had the Mountain go to the villages in the Riverlands and destroy towns of innocent people. The list goes on. But what does everyone call him? Cunning, merciless, ruthless, a badass. A bad guy, sure, but nobody ever questions his sanity. So why, again, is Dany mad? Because she\u2019s arrogant? So is Sansa. And I LOVE Sansa. But I also love Daenerys. So why, when a woman, (who mind you, has always been TRYING to do good, even if it didn\u2019t go well) does something like want revenge, her sanity is put into question. I mean I know why, but I need everyone else to understand why. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right to burn a city, what I\u2019m saying is Dany is angry and hurt and alone and has every right to feel the emotions she is feeling. I\u2019m sick of every time a female character shows anything beyond docile and kind, she is a \u201cCrazy bitch\u201d. (Unless of course you show masculine traits, but that\u2019s a whole different post). </p>",

It was like that every month, where for a few days Tyrion would have to leave and meet up with the newly-formed government in Westeros, where men from all the kingdoms discussed issues and affairs under the watchful eyes of her brother, Bran.</p><p>While she practiced needlework in their shared bedroom, a handmaiden walked in. \u201cLord Tyrion has just arrived back,\u201d she spoke quickly, almost flustered. Sansa looked up from her newest design and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come see to him. Thank you.\u201d Her manners always got the best of her, and her husband always remarked on it before they went to bed. \u201c<i>You don\u2019t have to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d to the servants,\u201d </i>he\u2019d say, smiling and laughing. She always giggled along, but her mannerisms never seemed to change.</p><p>She turned her head to look out their window, accessible from her velvet-colored chair, and noticed a group of horses entering the gates of the Rock. Quickly, Sansa changed herself into a red and gold dress, letting her hair flow down in soft curls. When she finished, she left the room and moved down the long lengths of stairs, hoping to reach her lord husband before he began his hike all the way up.</p><p>It took her a bit, but she did get down to him first. Tyrion waited by the doorway, talking with a few of his guards. She exhaled in relief, glad he wasn\u2019t arguing, for then her entrance would be unfortunate. As she took a few slow steps, Sansa realized how her shoes made only soft sounds. He wasn\u2019t going to hear her. Instead, she spoke, \u201cMy lord husband.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion handed one of the other men a scroll, turning to face Sansa. \u201cMy lady wife.\u201d She could see him clear his throat. \u201cYou look radiant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home.\u201d <i>Home</i>. The word seemed so foreign as she looked around. Winterfell was her real home, not the Rock! Yet, some feeling made her stomach flutter everytime she heard the place aloud. <i>Casterly Rock.</i></p><p>As she climbed down the steps to meet him, he moved forwards to her. She wanted to reach down and cup his face with her hands, to press her lips to his own or even to his forehead. Sansa supposed it was just the fact that they had been gone for so long that she was so happy, but when she looked at him she felt drunk on his image.</p><p>They walked up the stairs together towards their room. Sansa wanted to link their arms, but due to their height difference she didn\u2019t believe it would work. Of course, they held hands and stood close to each other. The time they spent now as husband and wife was much different than when they were married in King\u2019s Landing. \u201cHow was the Council? And Bran?\u201d</p><p>He looked over the side of the stairs as he ascended with her. \u201cI would have much rather stayed here than leave. Your brother was fine. He\u2019s taking up the position very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he changed much?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion shrugged his shoulders, and the two reached a new set of stairs. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a beard like me, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying.\u201d He grinned a bit. \u201cI suppose he seems more interested in current affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran was always the best of us Starks,\u201d Sansa murmured. She felt her husband squeeze her hand softly. \u201cMy lady mother always said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he affirmed, and internally Sansa beamed with pride. \u201cI can\u2019t vouch for your sister, but I enjoy spending my company with you rather than your brother.\u201d</p><p>The two of them made it to the hallway where their room was, and she carefully let go of his hand to smooth out her dress. \u201cYou only say that because I\u2019m your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Bran is my superior, so what?\u201d When Sansa moved her hand down to grab his, he took it and pressed it to his lips, causing her to turn to him slightly. \u201cDid I ever tell you how gorgeous you are in that dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite,\u201d she noted. \u201cI thought it would be a good way to surprise you when you returned home.\u201d</p><p>They made it to their room, and Sansa pushed open the door. \u201cIt was a good choice.\u201d</p><p>Inside, they ate their dinner together as Tyrion went on about the Council. Sansa listened in interest, though she did occasionally drift off and think about his beard, her brother, and sometimes even the bane of her existence, Littlefinger.</p><p>When they went to bed, Sansa took longer than her husband to fall asleep. Her dreams had kept her up the nights he was gone, as normally Tyrion would allow his fingers to roam her hair, and she enjoyed his warmth under their furs.</p><p>The moon was still high in the sky, and with her eyes closed all Sansa could see was Littlefinger\u2019s begging. She saw the pain and misery in his eyes, and felt guilty. Tyrion heard her whining, mumbling in her sleep. He waited, like he always did, until she started screaming.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he soothed, \u201cSansa.\u201d She seemed stuck in a dream. Groggily, he prodded at her shoulder.</p><p>She mumbled again. <i>You\u2019re a <b>late bloomer</b>, Sansa. You should have realized what I am. I\u2019m evil. I sent you into a marriage you didn\u2019t want, and you failed to realize it sooner. How pathetic. </i>She felt guilty for planning his murder, and yet he taunted her through her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Tyrion repeated, a bit louder. \u201cIt\u2019s only a nightmare. Please, wake up.\u201d Her voice faded into a soft murmur, and soon her eyes opened as a cold sweat fell down her face. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>She let the tears fall from her eyes, and Tyrion was quick to wrap his arms around her body. Sansa sobbed and let her emotions pour out to the Lannister, and he comforted her as he enjoyed doing. When she finally leaned back into the bed, he kept his hands entangled in her hair, and she slowly drifted off into a more peaceful slumber.</p><p>Together they would awake, and no one mentioned the night before. It was a silent arrangement: if she wanted to speak about it, she would. Sansa never did.</p><p>They ate breakfast together, the Sansa began her needlework while Tyrion began his own tasks as Lord of Casterly Rock. \u201cI would like to go and look at the plants outside today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rock isn\u2019t known for its gardens, my lady.\u201d Tyrion was too focused on his work, so he didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>Placing down her needles, Sansa got to her feet. The white nightgown she wore clung to her figure, not too tight but just enough to keep her comfortable. \u201cI know, but I think it\u2019s best we get some fresh air.\u201d She used the word \u201cwe\u201d to get his attention, and it did the job.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>They walked together, down the stairs hand-in-hand and didn\u2019t speak, but a comfortable silence passed through them. When they arrived outside, a few plants surrounded the entrance to the Rock. Sansa noticed the flowers blooming, all but a small yellow one. \u201cA late bloomer,\u201d she murmured, and thought silently of her dream.</p><p>\u201cI told you, our plants aren\u2019t as well-kept as, say, Highgarden.\u201d He watched the yellow flower, just like she did. \u201cOf course, now that Bronn has taken over I\u2019m not so sure those gardens are much better than ours.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, and instead pressed two of her fingers to her lips. Slowly, gently, she bent down and pressed the two fingers onto the flower. As she turned to look at him, Tyrion smiled with a fondness and affection he hadn\u2019t shown any other woman before. </p><p>Her home was at the Rock now. Sansa enjoyed it.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>sanrion goals am i right</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"186\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"maisieswilliams:041btLOVbJFe9KNvihq0HA:ZNRK4k2hZEz8F\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b57cee618ffb0c360fb92c46eff973f9/tumblr_pq01uldxU41ua7zt5o1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"186\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p>tagging: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJBJtScsiD6fnU6R8FIOT2Q\">@downwithwritersblock</a> </p>",

The word seemed so foreign as she looked around. Winterfell was her real home, not the Rock! Yet, some feeling made her stomach flutter everytime she heard the place aloud. <i>Casterly Rock.</i></p><p>As she climbed down the steps to meet him, he moved forwards to her. She wanted to reach down and cup his face with her hands, to press her lips to his own or even to his forehead. Sansa supposed it was just the fact that they had been gone for so long that she was so happy, but when she looked at him she felt drunk on his image.</p><p>They walked up the stairs together towards their room. Sansa wanted to link their arms, but due to their height difference she didn\u2019t believe it would work. Of course, they held hands and stood close to each other. The time they spent now as husband and wife was much different than when they were married in King\u2019s Landing. \u201cHow was the Council? And Bran?\u201d</p><p>He looked over the side of the stairs as he ascended with her. \u201cI would have much rather stayed here than leave. Your brother was fine. He\u2019s taking up the position very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he changed much?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion shrugged his shoulders, and the two reached a new set of stairs. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a beard like me, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying.\u201d He grinned a bit. \u201cI suppose he seems more interested in current affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran was always the best of us Starks,\u201d Sansa murmured. She felt her husband squeeze her hand softly. \u201cMy lady mother always said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he affirmed, and internally Sansa beamed with pride. \u201cI can\u2019t vouch for your sister, but I enjoy spending my company with you rather than your brother.\u201d</p><p>The two of them made it to the hallway where their room was, and she carefully let go of his hand to smooth out her dress. \u201cYou only say that because I\u2019m your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Bran is my superior, so what?\u201d When Sansa moved her hand down to grab his, he took it and pressed it to his lips, causing her to turn to him slightly. \u201cDid I ever tell you how gorgeous you are in that dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite,\u201d she noted. \u201cI thought it would be a good way to surprise you when you returned home.\u201d</p><p>They made it to their room, and Sansa pushed open the door. \u201cIt was a good choice.\u201d</p><p>Inside, they ate their dinner together as Tyrion went on about the Council. Sansa listened in interest, though she did occasionally drift off and think about his beard, her brother, and sometimes even the bane of her existence, Littlefinger.</p><p>When they went to bed, Sansa took longer than her husband to fall asleep. Her dreams had kept her up the nights he was gone, as normally Tyrion would allow his fingers to roam her hair, and she enjoyed his warmth under their furs.</p><p>The moon was still high in the sky, and with her eyes closed all Sansa could see was Littlefinger\u2019s begging. She saw the pain and misery in his eyes, and felt guilty. Tyrion heard her whining, mumbling in her sleep. He waited, like he always did, until she started screaming.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he soothed, \u201cSansa.\u201d She seemed stuck in a dream. Groggily, he prodded at her shoulder.</p><p>She mumbled again. <i>You\u2019re a <b>late bloomer</b>, Sansa. You should have realized what I am. I\u2019m evil. I sent you into a marriage you didn\u2019t want, and you failed to realize it sooner. How pathetic. </i>She felt guilty for planning his murder, and yet he taunted her through her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Tyrion repeated, a bit louder. \u201cIt\u2019s only a nightmare. Please, wake up.\u201d Her voice faded into a soft murmur, and soon her eyes opened as a cold sweat fell down her face. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>She let the tears fall from her eyes, and Tyrion was quick to wrap his arms around her body. Sansa sobbed and let her emotions pour out to the Lannister, and he comforted her as he enjoyed doing. When she finally leaned back into the bed, he kept his hands entangled in her hair, and she slowly drifted off into a more peaceful slumber.</p><p>Together they would awake, and no one mentioned the night before. It was a silent arrangement: if she wanted to speak about it, she would. Sansa never did.</p><p>They ate breakfast together, the Sansa began her needlework while Tyrion began his own tasks as Lord of Casterly Rock. \u201cI would like to go and look at the plants outside today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rock isn\u2019t known for its gardens, my lady.\u201d Tyrion was too focused on his work, so he didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>Placing down her needles, Sansa got to her feet. The white nightgown she wore clung to her figure, not too tight but just enough to keep her comfortable. \u201cI know, but I think it\u2019s best we get some fresh air.\u201d She used the word \u201cwe\u201d to get his attention, and it did the job.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>They walked together, down the stairs hand-in-hand and didn\u2019t speak, but a comfortable silence passed through them. When they arrived outside, a few plants surrounded the entrance to the Rock. Sansa noticed the flowers blooming, all but a small yellow one. \u201cA late bloomer,\u201d she murmured, and thought silently of her dream.</p><p>\u201cI told you, our plants aren\u2019t as well-kept as, say, Highgarden.\u201d He watched the yellow flower, just like she did. \u201cOf course, now that Bronn has taken over I\u2019m not so sure those gardens are much better than ours.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, and instead pressed two of her fingers to her lips. Slowly, gently, she bent down and pressed the two fingers onto the flower. As she turned to look at him, Tyrion smiled with a fondness and affection he hadn\u2019t shown any other woman before. </p><p>Her home was at the Rock now. Sansa enjoyed it.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>sanrion goals am i right</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"186\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"maisieswilliams:041btLOVbJFe9KNvihq0HA:ZNRK4k2hZEz8F\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b57cee618ffb0c360fb92c46eff973f9/tumblr_pq01uldxU41ua7zt5o1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"186\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p>tagging: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJBJtScsiD6fnU6R8FIOT2Q\">@downwithwritersblock</a> </p></p>",

It was like that every month, where for a few days Tyrion would have to leave and meet up with the newly-formed government in Westeros, where men from all the kingdoms discussed issues and affairs under the watchful eyes of her brother, Bran.</p><p>While she practiced needlework in their shared bedroom, a handmaiden walked in. &ldquo;Lord Tyrion has just arrived back,&rdquo; she spoke quickly, almost flustered. Sansa looked up from her newest design and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come see to him. Thank you.&rdquo; Her manners always got the best of her, and her husband always remarked on it before they went to bed. &ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t have to say &ldquo;please&rdquo; and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to the servants,&rdquo; </i>he&rsquo;d say, smiling and laughing. She always giggled along, but her mannerisms never seemed to change.</p><p>She turned her head to look out their window, accessible from her velvet-colored chair, and noticed a group of horses entering the gates of the Rock. Quickly, Sansa changed herself into a red and gold dress, letting her hair flow down in soft curls. When she finished, she left the room and moved down the long lengths of stairs, hoping to reach her lord husband before he began his hike all the way up.</p><p>It took her a bit, but she did get down to him first. Tyrion waited by the doorway, talking with a few of his guards. She exhaled in relief, glad he wasn&rsquo;t arguing, for then her entrance would be unfortunate. As she took a few slow steps, Sansa realized how her shoes made only soft sounds. He wasn&rsquo;t going to hear her. Instead, she spoke, &ldquo;My lord husband.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion handed one of the other men a scroll, turning to face Sansa. &ldquo;My lady wife.&rdquo; She could see him clear his throat. &ldquo;You look radiant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re home.&rdquo; <i>Home</i>.

Granted it could\u2019ve been worded better, but context is key. </p><p>Who is Sansa now? Is she the Sansa from season 1? No. The girl from season 2 or 3? Hardly. She has evolved much farther from those Sansas. Season 1 Sansa was a child, a little girl who loved handsome Knights in shining armour and beautiful princesses. </p><p>Season 8 Sansa knows that not all Knights wear shining armour, some wear dirty old leathers. They are not all handsome, some have very little (or broken) teeth, missing fingers, or disfiguring scars or deformities. They are CERTAINLY not all chivalrous either, there were plenty in the Kings Guard that proved that to her in King\u2019s Landing. Season 8 Sansa knows that princesses may not be beautiful on the inside, despite their outward appearance. Perhaps they are not loving and kind to their subjects. </p><p>Season 8 Sansa is colder and harsher than her previous self. She\u2019s seen much and done plenty (both willingly and forced) and has emerged in the way you\u2019d expect. Years of abuse (from Joffrey onward really), torture, and rape have shaped her into who she is now. I echo Cersei\u2019s words from Season 1, \u201cYou either play the Game of Thrones, or you die.\u201d This \u201cgame\u201d is not pretty or easy. It is dirty and tough. Only the strong survive this game. For Sansa, learning how to play the game was not like learning how to sew from her Septa. It was beaten into her, tortured into her, and yes, raped into her. </p><p>Granted, the scene needed better execution, but Sansa is looking at all of the negative in her life and forming a positive. Yes she was abused, yes she was tortured, yes she was raped&hellip;BUT SHE SURVIVED. She learned how to play the game the way EVERYONE in Westeros learns how to play it. No one who plays the game well has clean hands, no one. You may counter with Cersei probably not going through the same shit Sansa has endured and you\u2019re right. But Cersei is a murderer, she has killed for her own gain. She has no remorse and she wasn\u2019t prompted by anything other than her own jealousy. </p><p>In the scene in question, Sansa is talking with Sandor Clegane. He had just brought up how none of the things that have happened to her, would\u2019ve happened if she had left with him. His voice and facial expression convey remorse and perhaps guilt at not forcing her to leave with him. But it can be taken in two ways. </p><p>1) if she had left with him, she would\u2019ve avoided the torture, abuse, and rape. Sandor would\u2019ve protected her from that. I believe he could have been successful given his track record with keeping Arya safe for as long as he could. </p><p>2) if she had left with him, it\u2019s possible she\u2019d have never learned to play the game well. He could be expressing that the person she is now wouldn\u2019t exist if she had left with him. </p><p>There is a process my therapist has taught me about called Post Traumatic Growth. It\u2019s something not everyone knows about. Post Traumatic Growth (or benefit finding) is \u201cpositive psychological change experienced as a result of adversity and other challenges in order to rise to a higher level of functioning.\u201d I think that this is what Sansa is experiencing. It\u2019s a healthy way of dealing with and overcoming trauma. It\u2019s literally \u201clooking on the bright side of things\u201d. </p><p>People are coming back with \u201cwomen don\u2019t need tough experiences to be strong\u201d and that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s also pretty narrow-minded. You\u2019re not talking about someone who had never been through tough events. You\u2019re talking about someone who had been a victim of abuse for YEARS. Someone who had been told she was a \u201cstupid little girl\u201d for YEARS! That takes a toll on someone\u2019s self esteem and they start to believe it after a while. For Sansa, it took surviving and learning from these events to realise how strong she is. How strong she has always been, but hasn\u2019t been able to see it. </p><p>Not everyone has to experience the worse life has to offer to be strong, but how dare you imply that horrible events can\u2019t and don\u2019t shape you into adulthood. That\u2019s like telling a current victim of abuse that nothing they\u2019ve endured will make an impact on their life. </p>",

Granted it could\u2019ve been worded better, but context is key. </p><p>Who is Sansa now? Is she the Sansa from season 1? No. The girl from season 2 or 3? Hardly. She has evolved much farther from those Sansas. Season 1 Sansa was a child, a little girl who loved handsome Knights in shining armour and beautiful princesses. </p><p>Season 8 Sansa knows that not all Knights wear shining armour, some wear dirty old leathers. They are not all handsome, some have very little (or broken) teeth, missing fingers, or disfiguring scars or deformities. They are CERTAINLY not all chivalrous either, there were plenty in the Kings Guard that proved that to her in King\u2019s Landing. Season 8 Sansa knows that princesses may not be beautiful on the inside, despite their outward appearance. Perhaps they are not loving and kind to their subjects. </p><p>Season 8 Sansa is colder and harsher than her previous self. She\u2019s seen much and done plenty (both willingly and forced) and has emerged in the way you\u2019d expect. Years of abuse (from Joffrey onward really), torture, and rape have shaped her into who she is now. I echo Cersei\u2019s words from Season 1, \u201cYou either play the Game of Thrones, or you die.\u201d This \u201cgame\u201d is not pretty or easy. It is dirty and tough. Only the strong survive this game. For Sansa, learning how to play the game was not like learning how to sew from her Septa. It was beaten into her, tortured into her, and yes, raped into her. </p><p>Granted, the scene needed better execution, but Sansa is looking at all of the negative in her life and forming a positive. Yes she was abused, yes she was tortured, yes she was raped\u2026BUT SHE SURVIVED. She learned how to play the game the way EVERYONE in Westeros learns how to play it. No one who plays the game well has clean hands, no one. You may counter with Cersei probably not going through the same shit Sansa has endured and you\u2019re right. But Cersei is a murderer, she has killed for her own gain. She has no remorse and she wasn\u2019t prompted by anything other than her own jealousy. </p><p>In the scene in question, Sansa is talking with Sandor Clegane. He had just brought up how none of the things that have happened to her, would\u2019ve happened if she had left with him. His voice and facial expression convey remorse and perhaps guilt at not forcing her to leave with him. But it can be taken in two ways. </p><p>1) if she had left with him, she would\u2019ve avoided the torture, abuse, and rape. Sandor would\u2019ve protected her from that. I believe he could have been successful given his track record with keeping Arya safe for as long as he could. </p><p>2) if she had left with him, it\u2019s possible she\u2019d have never learned to play the game well. He could be expressing that the person she is now wouldn\u2019t exist if she had left with him. </p><p>There is a process my therapist has taught me about called Post Traumatic Growth. It\u2019s something not everyone knows about. Post Traumatic Growth (or benefit finding) is \u201cpositive psychological change experienced as a result of adversity and other challenges in order to rise to a higher level of functioning.\u201d I think that this is what Sansa is experiencing. It\u2019s a healthy way of dealing with and overcoming trauma. It\u2019s literally \u201clooking on the bright side of things\u201d. </p><p>People are coming back with \u201cwomen don\u2019t need tough experiences to be strong\u201d and that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s also pretty narrow-minded. You\u2019re not talking about someone who had never been through tough events. You\u2019re talking about someone who had been a victim of abuse for YEARS. Someone who had been told she was a \u201cstupid little girl\u201d for YEARS! That takes a toll on someone\u2019s self esteem and they start to believe it after a while. For Sansa, it took surviving and learning from these events to realise how strong she is. How strong she has always been, but hasn\u2019t been able to see it. </p><p>Not everyone has to experience the worse life has to offer to be strong, but how dare you imply that horrible events can\u2019t and don\u2019t shape you into adulthood.
