I can&rsquo;t go into any more details without getting spoilery, so let&rsquo;s move on to the other aspects of this great novel!</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe supposed he&rsquo;d learned that strength could be hidden beneath the most unlikely faces.\u201d\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p><b>- Setting -</b></p><p>The setting in <i>Tower of Dawn</i> was beautifully written, and very immersive. This book introduces new lands into the world of <i>Throne of Glass</i> that are absolutely amazing and added some fascinating dynamics to the political aspects of the plot, as well as epic new creatures.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cEvery step. Every curve into darkness. Every moment of despair and rage and pain. It had led him to precisely where he needed to be. Where he wanted to be.\u201d\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p><b>- Writing -</b>\u00a0</p><p>Sarah J. Maas&rsquo; writing style fully immerses you into her world, to the point where I was genuinely terrified in several scenes, something that she hasn&rsquo;t done before in any other books in this series. There were multiple times where I was biting my nails, due to Maas&rsquo; atmospheric writing and beautifully crafted tension. Also, due to this book leaving behind Aelin and focusing more on Chaol, Nesryn, and Yrene, a lot fo the repetitive phrases and words weren&rsquo;t used! For once, I was glad at the lack of &ldquo;fae males&rdquo; because I was so sick of seeing those words on the page. However, this book is still as mature as the ones right before it, toeing the line between YA and Adult, but not quite to the same extent as <i>Empire of Storms</i>.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt was agony and despair and fear. It was joy and laughter and rest. It was life, all of it&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p><b>- Plot-</b></p><p>The pacing in this book was fairly good. It occasionally suffered due to the amount of new information that was exposited, but there were plenty of action scenes and tense moments to make up for it. The overall mystery was very interesting, and there were plenty of plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. I can see what Maas changed this from a novella to a full-length novel, and why it&rsquo;s required reading for this series. This book ties together a lot of major characters and plot points in ways that will be crucial for the final novel.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDesperation breeds people who are willing to do anything to get what they need.\u201d\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p><b>- Characters -\u00a0</b></p><p>Sorry, this may be long&hellip;.<br/>When I first heard of this book (back when it was a novella), I wasn&rsquo;t excited. I didn&rsquo;t like <b>Chaol</b>, I never really did, and I didn&rsquo;t want an entire book focusing on him instead of Aelin (especially after the ending of <i>Empire of Storms</i>!) I was prepared to push through this book and get it over with, but it actually ended up being one of my favorites, and changing my mind about Chaol. His growth in <i>Tower of Dawn</i> is amazing. He became a character I could respect and like over these 600+ pages. Due to the events of the <i>Queen of Shadows</i>(I won&rsquo;t spoil what events), obviously Chaol has a lot of work to do, and this book really emphasizes the mental and psychological aspect of said work. I was afraid of how they would deal with what happened to him, but I was very happy with the result. <br/><b>Nesyrn</b> was another interesting and complex character, who in the previous books I liked but didn&rsquo;t feel a connection toward. This book changed that and made me really love her. She is strong, both physically and mentally, and very admirable. She is also very caring and dedicated to her biological family, not just the protagonists, something that isn&rsquo;t really a trait in many other characters in this series (mostly because their families are dead, but still). <b>Yrene </b>is our third main character of this book. You might remember her from <i>The Assassin&rsquo;s Blade</i>.

Maas\u2019 writing style fully immerses you into her world, to the point where I was genuinely terrified in several scenes, something that she hasn\u2019t done before in any other books in this series. There were multiple times where I was biting my nails, due to Maas\u2019 atmospheric writing and beautifully crafted tension. Also, due to this book leaving behind Aelin and focusing more on Chaol, Nesryn, and Yrene, a lot fo the repetitive phrases and words weren\u2019t used! For once, I was glad at the lack of \u201cfae males\u201d because I was so sick of seeing those words on the page. However, this book is still as mature as the ones right before it, toeing the line between YA and Adult, but not quite to the same extent as <i>Empire of Storms</i>.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt was agony and despair and fear.

It occasionally suffered due to the amount of new information that was exposited, but there were plenty of action scenes and tense moments to make up for it. The overall mystery was very interesting, and there were plenty of plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. I can see what Maas changed this from a novella to a full-length novel, and why it\u2019s required reading for this series. This book ties together a lot of major characters and plot points in ways that will be crucial for the final novel.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDesperation breeds people who are willing to do anything to get what they need.\u201d\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p><b>- Characters -\u00a0</b></p><p>Sorry, this may be long\u2026.<br>When I first heard of this book (back when it was a novella), I wasn\u2019t excited. I didn\u2019t like <b>Chaol</b>, I never really did, and I didn\u2019t want an entire book focusing on him instead of Aelin (especially after the ending of <i>Empire of Storms</i>!) I was prepared to push through this book and get it over with, but it actually ended up being one of my favorites, and changing my mind about Chaol. His growth in <i>Tower of Dawn</i> is amazing. He became a character I could respect and like over these 600+ pages. Due to the events of the <i>Queen of Shadows</i>(I won\u2019t spoil what events), obviously Chaol has a lot of work to do, and this book really emphasizes the mental and psychological aspect of said work. I was afraid of how they would deal with what happened to him, but I was very happy with the result. <br><b>Nesyrn</b> was another interesting and complex character, who in the previous books I liked but didn\u2019t feel a connection toward. This book changed that and made me really love her. She is strong, both physically and mentally, and very admirable. She is also very caring and dedicated to her biological family, not just the protagonists, something that isn\u2019t really a trait in many other characters in this series (mostly because their families are dead, but still). <b>Yrene </b>is our third main character of this book.
