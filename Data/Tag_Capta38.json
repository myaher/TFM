Upon Theo Adam&rsquo;s return to the United States, Adam&rsquo;s sister learns what Theo has done and takes <b>Mary </b>into her care. Primm has <b>Mary </b>illegally adopted by Primm&rsquo;s childless employers, Nick and Nora Bromfield. As Mary Bromfield, the young girl grows up living an idyllic life in a wealthy family but continuously dreams of another family with a brother she has never seen.</p><p>Meanwhile Billy, eventually finding himself on the streets, is given the power to become Captain Marvel. He learns that <b>Mary </b>is still alive. But after four years of searching, neither he nor his benefactor, the wizard Shazam, can find the girl.

A note from Freddy Freeman left with a nurse asked her not to look for him. When <b>Mary </b>attempted to call on the power of Shazam, she found that she was still powerless. Madame Xanadu warned <b>Mary </b>not to visit Gotham City, telling her it would be especially dangerous, but she made her way there nonetheless. <b>Mary </b>is drawn to the abandoned Kahndaqi embassy, where she is attacked by squatting criminals. As they cornered her, her pursuers were attacked by a fully-powered, unhinged Black Adam, who then directed his fury at her. But after nearly choking her, Adam took pity on the powerless <b>Mary </b>and instead gave her his powers. While Adam once again became his mortal alter-ego, Teth-Adam, <b>Mary </b>transformed back into her adult <b>Marvel </b>form, but this time she was wearing a black, form-fitting costume with a skirt and since Adam was not sharing his powers with anyone else when he granted them to <b>Mary</b>, she held all of Black Adam&rsquo;s powers.</p><p>Finding Adam&rsquo;s power to be more than she bargained for, <b>Mary </b>went in search of a tutor. She first sought out Zatanna, who took her to Shadowcrest for training. But when Zatanna refused to give her access to any of the magical weapons, <b>Mary</b> began to believe that Zatanna was merely planning to steal her power and attacked her. Zatanna thus banished Mary from Shadowcrest.</p><p>Wandering around, <b>Mary </b>ended up in Chung Ling Soo Square, a flea market of magic located in China. When one of the locals attacked her, she was saved by the witch-boy, Klarion Bleak, who offered to help her control her powers in exchange for a small fraction of it. She accepted, but when he tried to steal all her power, she defeated him and left him to the mercies of Chun Ling Soo&rsquo;s locals.</p><p>Drawn away by a mysterious voice, she arrived in Ephesus, Turkey, where she found Eclipso, who offered mentorship with seemingly no strings attached. Under her tutelage, <b>Mary </b>went on a campaign of cruelly-twisted justice, punishing terrible crimes in an excessive manner.</p><p>Their alliance, however, seemed to break down when Eclipso, hoping to please her master, Darkseid, offered him the young and pretty <b>Mary </b>to serve as his new concubine, reasoning that the two women could always leech Darkseid&rsquo;s arcane knowledge, slay him and take his place. <b>Mary </b>refused to sell herself for more power, beat Eclipso with her own crystal, and fled. Eclipso caught up to her and regained the diamond. Eclipso then departed, leaving <b>Mary </b>alone again. Some time later, Eclipso returned to try and finish her off, but <b>Mary </b>was too strong for her.</p><p><b>Mary </b>experienced a change of heart, and upon realizing that Black Adam&rsquo;s powers were as responsible for her corruption as Eclipso, divested herself of them, feeding the lighting bolt into Eclipso. Both women lost their powers and fell into the ocean. However an unpowered <b>Mary </b>landed on Themysciran soil, where Queen Hippolyta drafted her in the rebellion against Granny Goodness, who was posing as the goddess Athena.</p><p><b>Mary</b>, Holly Robinson and Harley Quinn managed to reveal Granny&rsquo;s deception, and the trio followed her to Apokolips. After escaping the Female Furies, <b>Mary </b>started to hear the voices of the gods. The group managed to free the gods from an Apokaliptan chamber, and <b>Mary Marvel&rsquo;s </b>powers and a new variation of her classic costume, now with a gray lightning bolt and long sleeves, were restored.</p><p>After journeying with the Challengers to Earth-51 and witnessing the Great Disaster occurring there, <b>Mary</b> finally returns home to find Darkseid waiting for her. Reminding her of how strong she felt using Black Adam&rsquo;s powers, he returns them to her, restoring her black costume. She then confronts Donna Troy, Kyle Rayner, Forager, and Jimmy Olsen, seizing Jimmy to take him back to Darkseid. When Donna questions <b>Mary&rsquo;s </b>use of the powers, <b>Mary </b>insists that she is not evil, merely &ldquo;driven&rdquo;.\u00a0After Darkseid&rsquo;s defeat, <b>Mary </b>returns to Black Adam, asking to be a part of a new Black Marvel Family. Adam refuses her, and she decides to become a solo superheroine.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"960\" data-orig-width=\"518\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f112d7c68050c91a9bab2fcbcd119a5a/tumblr_inline_pqqgprSVXC1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"960\" data-orig-width=\"518\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Final Crisis</i></b></h2><p>Still under the dark influence of Darkseid, <b>Mary </b>was corrupted and turned into a vessel for one of Darkseid&rsquo;s servants.

She clashed with Freddy, Tawky Tawny, and Black Adam. Almost immediately, Adam tried to kill her, telling Freddy that it was not <b>Mary </b>who was in control \u2014 just &ldquo;a leering old man&rdquo; as Adam put it. As the battle continued, <b>Mary </b>focused on Supergirl, flying across the city and damaging the remaining buildings. Finally, Freddy managed to grab ahold of <b>Mary </b>and shouted &ldquo;Shazam&rdquo;, transforming them both back to normal and suppressing or removing DeSaad&rsquo;s influence from <b>Mary</b>. She broke down crying over what she had done, as Freddy reassured her that it wasn&rsquo;t her fault.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"800\" data-orig-width=\"620\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1610b39de34c22b9f5fa9fc946e901bc/tumblr_inline_pqqgpzgwJy1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"800\" data-orig-width=\"620\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Shazam One-Shot</i></b></h2><p>Desiring the power of the Marvels, Blaze strikes a deal with <b>Mary</b>.

A note from Freddy Freeman left with a nurse asked her not to look for him. When <b>Mary </b>attempted to call on the power of Shazam, she found that she was still powerless. Madame Xanadu warned <b>Mary </b>not to visit Gotham City, telling her it would be especially dangerous, but she made her way there nonetheless. <b>Mary </b>is drawn to the abandoned Kahndaqi embassy, where she is attacked by squatting criminals. As they cornered her, her pursuers were attacked by a fully-powered, unhinged Black Adam, who then directed his fury at her. But after nearly choking her, Adam took pity on the powerless <b>Mary </b>and instead gave her his powers. While Adam once again became his mortal alter-ego, Teth-Adam, <b>Mary </b>transformed back into her adult <b>Marvel </b>form, but this time she was wearing a black, form-fitting costume with a skirt and since Adam was not sharing his powers with anyone else when he granted them to <b>Mary</b>, she held all of Black Adam\u2019s powers.</p><p>Finding Adam\u2019s power to be more than she bargained for, <b>Mary </b>went in search of a tutor. She first sought out Zatanna, who took her to Shadowcrest for training. But when Zatanna refused to give her access to any of the magical weapons, <b>Mary</b> began to believe that Zatanna was merely planning to steal her power and attacked her. Zatanna thus banished Mary from Shadowcrest.</p><p>Wandering around, <b>Mary </b>ended up in Chung Ling Soo Square, a flea market of magic located in China. When one of the locals attacked her, she was saved by the witch-boy, Klarion Bleak, who offered to help her control her powers in exchange for a small fraction of it. She accepted, but when he tried to steal all her power, she defeated him and left him to the mercies of Chun Ling Soo\u2019s locals.</p><p>Drawn away by a mysterious voice, she arrived in Ephesus, Turkey, where she found Eclipso, who offered mentorship with seemingly no strings attached. Under her tutelage, <b>Mary </b>went on a campaign of cruelly-twisted justice, punishing terrible crimes in an excessive manner.</p><p>Their alliance, however, seemed to break down when Eclipso, hoping to please her master, Darkseid, offered him the young and pretty <b>Mary </b>to serve as his new concubine, reasoning that the two women could always leech Darkseid\u2019s arcane knowledge, slay him and take his place. <b>Mary </b>refused to sell herself for more power, beat Eclipso with her own crystal, and fled. Eclipso caught up to her and regained the diamond. Eclipso then departed, leaving <b>Mary </b>alone again. Some time later, Eclipso returned to try and finish her off, but <b>Mary </b>was too strong for her.</p><p><b>Mary </b>experienced a change of heart, and upon realizing that Black Adam\u2019s powers were as responsible for her corruption as Eclipso, divested herself of them, feeding the lighting bolt into Eclipso. Both women lost their powers and fell into the ocean. However an unpowered <b>Mary </b>landed on Themysciran soil, where Queen Hippolyta drafted her in the rebellion against Granny Goodness, who was posing as the goddess Athena.</p><p><b>Mary</b>, Holly Robinson and Harley Quinn managed to reveal Granny\u2019s deception, and the trio followed her to Apokolips. After escaping the Female Furies, <b>Mary </b>started to hear the voices of the gods.

Reminding her of how strong she felt using Black Adam\u2019s powers, he returns them to her, restoring her black costume. She then confronts Donna Troy, Kyle Rayner, Forager, and Jimmy Olsen, seizing Jimmy to take him back to Darkseid. When Donna questions <b>Mary\u2019s </b>use of the powers, <b>Mary </b>insists that she is not evil, merely \u201cdriven\u201d.\u00a0After Darkseid\u2019s defeat, <b>Mary </b>returns to Black Adam, asking to be a part of a new Black Marvel Family.
