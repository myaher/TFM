The first 6 movies are about the Skywalkers, so it makes perfect sense that Anakin should be the protagonist of the Star Wars Prequels. It\u2019s about how Anakin born a slave on Tatooine, after he wins his freedom, he leaves to start his hero\u2019s journey. Luke is the hero\u2019s journey. Anakain is how a hero falls.</li><li>\n\nAnakin grew up with his mother Shimi and they took in Owen Lars and they became as close as brothers. When Anakin tragically falls, the love Owen had for Anakin died which explains his attitude towards him in A New Hope. Owen volunteered to fight in The Clone Wars to keep his brother safe, he didn\u2019t want to fight, but he loved Anakin too much, but Owen was basically Anakin\u2019s pilot. Beru was a handmaiden to\u00a0 Padme and Owen and Beru met during the war and fell in love. Owen and Beru got along great with Anakin, Padme, Ahsoka and Obi-Wan. It is only after Anakin\u2019s fall that everything went bad. Owen blamed Obi-Wan and the Jedi for what happened to Anakin. But out of love for Anakin and Padme, he and Beru adopted Luke and raised him like he was their own.\u00a0<br/></li><li>\n\nIt is Alderaan and not Naboo.\u00a0 We should know the planet that is getting destroyed in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nand It is not Amidala, it is Padme Organa, Bail is her brother. It\u2019s involvement in the prequel trilogy would have had a much greater impact; the efforts to free it from the Trade Federation ultimately pointless as audiences knew its ultimate fate. It would have also made sense that Leia grew up on her mother\u2019s home world.</li><li>Rather than Qui-Gon, Padme and Jar Jar, it\u2019s Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Padme who go to Tatooine and meet Anakin and Shmi. This way Obi-Wan establishes a bond with Anakin early on and Obi-Wan meets Shmi. When it\u2019s revealed that Qui-Gon wants to train Anakin as a Jedi, Obi-Wan agrees that he should, he is jealous that his master wants him replaced but he understands that the chosen one must become a Jedi. But Qui-Gon tells Obi-Wan that no one could ever replace him,\u00a0\u201cBen, you are like a son to me and I have loved you ever since I took you on as my Padawan</li><li>To avoid the racist stereotypes that are Jar Jar and Watto. I would cut the Gungans out entirely and replace Jar Jar and the Gungans with Ackbar and The Mon Calamari.\u00a0\n\nI feel that Jar Jar brought nothing to the story and was a unfunny racial stereotype and only there for kids appeal and because Lucas wanted to make toys.\n\nAckbar however would be crucial for The Clone Wars as an effective military leader and would be crucial in the creation of The Rebel Alliance and would be a great central character to have in the prequels.\u00a0<br/>As for Watto. I would replace Watto as Anakin\u2019s master and make it so Jabba The Hutt is who is the master of Anakin and Shmi.\u00a0\n\nJabba uses Anakin to repair his droids and Pods. Shmi became in debt to the Hutts so she had to sell herself and Anakin so they could simply live. Jabba uses Bib Fortuna to crack the whip on Anakin. When Anakin enters and wins the race, Jabba is enraged and sends his thugs to kill the Skywalkers, this will begin Jabba\u2019s hatred of the Jedi. Much like Luke was helpless as The Empire kills Owen and Beru, Anakin watched helplessly as Jabba\u2019s thugs kills Shmi and as they attempt to kill him, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon saves Anakin\u2019s life.\u00a0</li><li>Make Anakin flying in the Alderaanian starship to destroy the Droid Controller matter. Have it be that Anakin wants to help Padme and her people, they would be skeptical that a child could help stop the invasion, but Padme has seen first hand how skilled Anakin is, so she agrees. So instead of Anakin not knowing how to close the ship door and destroy the controller on accident, Captain Panaka would teach Anakin how to pilot the ship and so Anakin destroys the droid controller knowing that it would stop the droids. So like Luke, Anakin helped saved the day.\u00a0</li><li>Padme is Queen, not a senator. To go with the change that Naboo should have been Alderaan and Padme Amidala should have been Padme Organa Queen Of Alderaan and head of house Organa.\n\n\nNo \u201cI was elected queen\u201d she was next in line and rules until she dies, because that\u2019s how Monarchy works.<br/>Bail is her brother and prince, Breha is one of \u00a0her handmaidens and instead of doubles, she is a Queen who takes charge much like Leia was as a princess. <br/>We see more scenes like the deleted scenes in ROTS and in The Clone Wars cartoon of Padme, Mon Motha, Bail Organa and the other senators. They all see how corrupt the Republic has become and view how liberty is truly lost and must fight the influence Palpatine has gotten and try to prevent the rise of the empire, but because of the clone wars, it is too late.</li><li>Use Midichlorians the same way The Clone Wars and the Darth Plagueis novel uses them.</li><li>\n\nThe Jedi Code is spoken and taught to Anakin by Obi-Wan and he learns of the Sith code by Palpatine. So that way we can learn what teachings and beliefs The Jedi and Sith believe in.<br/>Jedi Code.<br/><i>There is no emotion, there is peace.</i><i>There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.</i><i>There is no passion, there is serenity.</i><i>There is no chaos, there is harmony.</i><i>There is no death, there is the Force.\u201d</i>\u00a0</li><li>Palpatine would teach the Sith Code to Anakin and Maul.<br/>\n\nSith Code<br/>\u201c <i>Peace is a lie, there is only passion.<br/></i><i>Through passion, I gain strength.<br/></i><i>Through strength, I gain power.<br/></i><i>Through power, I gain victory.<br/></i><i>Through victory, my chains are broken.<br/></i><i>The Force shall free me.\u201d</i> \n\n<br/></li><li>\n\nDarth Maul is kept alive and made the main villain of the prequel trilogy. I\u2019d also give Maul a reason to want to destroy the Jedi.\u00a0<br/>&ldquo;At last we will reveal ourselves, at last we shall have our revenge&rdquo; Those words always made me thought. Why does Maul want revenge on the Jedi? So my own origin for Maul is that Maul was a Zabrak born on Irodonia. The Jedi thought there was a disturbance in the force on the village where Maul was, they thought it was the dark side and the Jedi&rsquo;s judgement were clouded and massacred the village with Maul&rsquo;s family. Maul survived. It&rsquo;s revealed that Palpatine clouded the Jedi&rsquo;s mind. The two Jedi involved were Dooku and Qui-Gon and that began their distrust and disillusion of the Council. And thus we have a personal reason for Maul wanting to have revenge against the Jedi and Qui-Gon in particular.<br/>\n\nHe is however cut in half by Obi-Wan, but Palpatine saves him and his lower half is cybernetics like in the Clone Wars, because he put so much value and training into him and Maul is the perfect weapon.\u00a0\n<br/>\u00a0Asajj Ventress would be Maul\u2019s apprentice. But Palpatine is pulling the strings. He would have made a great recurring villain and given Obi-Wan Kenobi greater depth too, giving him an arc over the whole trilogy. Narratively speaking, Maul\u2019s death could have fit the same role as General Grievous; an act that would end the Clone Wars and bring his story full circle.<br/>Now speaking of \u00a0Asajj Ventress as Maul\u2019s apprentice. <br/>Maul would have found Ventress on Dathomir and he would train her to be his apprentice. \u00a0But their relationship would be different from Dooku and Ventress and Maul and Savage, Maul and Ventress would be lovers and their combined passion is what makes them together deadly. Unlike Dooku, he would not attempt to kill her, he would instead plot with her to take over the Sith and otherthrow Sidious as Mother Talzin would instruct them to get revenge on Sidious for her. Ventress would attempt to assassinate Palpatine and of course he kills her, so in revenge Maul and Grievous \u00a0kidnaps Sidious and in ROTS, Maul is responsible for cutting off Anakin\u2019s arm and killing Satine. Both Anakin and Obi-Wan have reasons for wanting Maul dead and Maul has been dying to kill Obi-Wan ever since Alderaan and he has always seen the chosen one as a threat. Together Anakin and Obi-Wan defeat Maul. Obi-Wan would restrain himself for taking revenge on Maul. But because of this, Maul force pushes Obi-Wan and with him out of the way, Anakin and Obi-Wan fight to the death. They are equally matched, but in the end, Anakin destroys Maul\u2019s double bladed lightsaber and chops his arms off. Maul is at Anakin\u2019s mercy and Palpatine demands him to kill Maul and that is the end of Maul<br/></li><li>\n\nWe could either have the Clone Wars being similar with the Clones being Clones of Jango, Mandalorians led by Jango Fett vs able bodied men who are trained and drafted from each of the republic\u2019s worlds. They are Stormtroopers. It is called The Clone Wars because of the Mandalorians and Stormtroopers\u2019 armor look the same and the fight with the Mandalorians are never ending. or\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtU_eTf6wdrs%26t%3D4s&amp;t=YzA2ZjQ2Mzc3ZTJhODVlY2FlMmMxNzk2YmZiYzlhYTNiODM3ZTNjNixmaTFPNlh5bQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AH7fufnj4oDBHXG8OLtOW1A&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdalekofchaos.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F120833241057%2Fthings-i-would-change-about-the-star-wars-prequels&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Clone Wars would be completely different. </a> Basically what was originally intended. The Clones were meant to be the villains. in The Thrawn Trilogy, cast the Clone Masters as the opponents of the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars, as several authors of the \u201890s considered that the cloners and their clones were the \u201cvillains.\u201d fighting the Jedi and the Republic. You can have the CIS leaders and Jango Fett aiding the Clone Masters, if anything, The Clone Masters were the original Rebels.\n\n<br/></li><li>Ahsoka\u2019s characterization would be the same as would the Jedi.</li><li>The main leaders of the Separatists are Count Dooku, Darth Maul and General Grievous, along with the other various leaders we have seen in the Clone Wars.<br/></li><li>Count Dooku would not be the Sith Lord we knew, but he would be a Grey Jedi. He was Qui-Gon\u2019s master, so naturally he would have the same views of the force and distrust in the Council as Qui-Gon did. He would still be one of the leaders of the separatists but unlike in canon, Dooku\u2019s reasons for defecting to the CIS is exactly what he told Obi-Wan in Attack Of The Clones. The Sith control the senate and the Republic. The Republic has become a pawn of the Sith and the Jedi have become to arrogant and complacent and wanting to free the galaxy from a corrupt Republic and from the Sith. But before it\u2019s too late Dooku realizes he was an unwilling pawn of Darth SIdious in creating The Clone Wars and when he has outlived his usefulness, Sidious sends Darth Maul to silence Dooku.<br/></li><li>General Grievous \u00a0is like he was in the 2003 Clone Wars Cartoon and his EU comics who was a badass general capable of strategic thinking and the badass cyborg who was capable of killing entire teams of Jedi Knights and capable of fighting Jedi Masters with ease. He is nothing like he was in The Clone Wars show and Revenge Of The Sith which portrays him as an incapable and incompetent general who was taken down by Gungans.. He is brutal, efficient, calculating, trained by both Count Dooku and Darth Maul showing why he is deadly with the lightsaber. Instead of showing him beaten time and time again by people who he would have killed in his old lore and the 2003 Clone Wars cartoon and running away like a pathetic coward, we actually see Grievous get to kill the Jedi, even showing the best Knights and even some masters die by his hands. There\u2019s a reason he was a warlord of his people and supreme commander of the CIS and put fear in the Jedi.<br/>His backstory would be like what he had in the EU<br/></li><li>Jango Fett lives longer and is Mandalore and leads The Mandalorians against The Republic and Separatists. Instead of being asked to be a donor for the Clone army, Jango at first joins the Separatists, however he views them as weak and would not allow the Mandalorians to become pawns of the Sith once again. Boba would be a teenager and not a kid so we can see that Boba Fett is a Mandalorian warrior and just as great as Jango and we are seen how badass Boba Fett really is since we were cheated out of him as a great villain in ROTJ.<br/>Before I talk more I must tell fans what Mandalore and who The Mandalorians are. <br/>The title of Mandalore was the Galactic Basic Standard transliteration of the Mando'a word Mand'alor, which meant \u201csole ruler\u201d in the Mandalorian language. The position of Mand'alor was a combination of king, warlord, and general in function, often carrying with it the additional title of Al'Ori'Ramikade, \u201cCommander of Supercommandos.\u201d A non-hereditary role, only a Mandalorian deemed worthy could claim the title of Mand'alor, exemplifying the Mandalorian meritocracy ideal. When the previous Mandalore fell or stepped down, a Mandalorian with both vision and strength could make a claim for the title, but if the other clans did not accept the individual as the new Mand'alor and recognize their authority, their duty was to remove the unsuitable claimant and institute a more favorable leader. The significance of the Mand'alor\u2019s role in Mandalorian society was so great that one of the Resol'nare\u2014the six basic tenets that defined Mandalorian culture\u2014detailed the importance of loyalty toward the Mand'alor, and rallying to the Mandalorian leader when called upon. <br/>The Mandalorians\u2014known in Mando'a as the Mando'ade, or \u201cChildren of Mandalore&quot;\u2014were a nomadic group of clan-based people consisting of members from multiple species and multiple genders, all bound by a common culture.In their early years, Mandalorian culture revolved around battle, with war being a source of honor and pride in their community. <br/>Now the comic Open Seasons would indeed be Jango\u2019s origin, however I would change it so that his tribe wasn\u2019t wiped out by the Jedi, instead what happens is a fight to the death between Jango Fett and Tor Vizla would determine who controls the Mandalorian clans. Jango Fett of course wins and becomes Mandalore. Jango is not killed by Mace, however Jango is able to wound and scar Mace with his flamethrower, the Jedi\u2019s arrogance cloud\u2019s his judgement and is beaten by Jango but does not die. Jango betraying Darth Maul and The Separatists is not taken lightly. Darth Maul fights Jango Fett for everyone to see and Darth Maul kills him. Boba enraged, continues his father\u2019s war and takes up the mantle of Mandalore. However Boba Fett does not see a difference between Jedi and Sith, he sees them one in the same and blame\u2019s his father\u2019s death on the Jedi for allowing the Sith to exist and for former Jedi to fall to the dark side. Where Obi-Wan\u2019s villain would be Darth Maul, Anakin\u2019s would be Boba Fett. In The Clone Wars, Boba Fett would be just annihilating The Republic until Anakin and the 501st fights back and Boba meets his match, Boba Fett a worthy antagonist and Anakin\u2019s campaign with The Mandalorians would test him and it ends with Anakin destroying the Mandalorians and leaving Boba Fett a broken man who is forced to become a Bounty Hunter with the Mandalorians all but destroyed, showing us the Bounty Hunter he became working for Jabba The Hutt. \u00a0\u00a0<br/></li><li>Palpatine is not the two dimensional laughable villain we got in the prequels, he is written to be a more complex villain. \u00a0Basically I believe Palpatine should have been like Alexander Pierce from CATWS. Pierce is cold. He is calculating. He knows how to manipulate people into doing what he wants. He\u2019s not afraid to use pawns and sacrifice them accordingly. He\u2019s an abuser and unapologetic and willing to take out millions of people for his vision, however fucked up that vision is, of the greater good. This is the Palpatine I wanted, however in this case it would be on a galactic scale. Tired of corruption and unrest in the senate, he is greeted by Darth Plaugeis and offers to give what Palpatine has always wanted, peace and offers to train him in the dark side of the force. Palpatine would learn everything Plagueis knew, even his ability to create life and then killing him. Palpatine\u2019s motivation would be wanting to force peace, stability and order in the Republic, however to ensure this he had to create The Clones and The Clone Wars. He needed Dooku to create unrest and to create the CIS and he needed the jedi out of the way. Then he would have completely justified his every action. Every action that destroys democracy, every action that causes civil unrest and it\u2019s all in the name of &ldquo;peace\u201d The Prequels would explore his decent into madness and meglomania. Palpatine slowly becomes more power-hungry and how he keeps justifying himself with all the horrible things he does until he\u2019s the cackling \u201cAnd now, young Skywalker\u2026you will die\u2026\u201d man we see in Return of the Jedi.<br/></li><li>\n\nIt would be revealed that Palpatine learned all there is to know from Darth Plagueis so he used his power to create life, to create Anakin manipulating the events throughout his life and used him to be his ultimate tool to destroy the Jedi\n\n<br/></li><li>Yoda and Obi-Wan go into exile \u00a0not only because they are in hiding from Vader and The Empire, but because they realized The Jedi failed the galaxy, they created Darth Vader and the Empire, they feel guilt and when he is fighting Anakin and after he defeats his former friend, he tells him how much not only he but the Jedi have failed Anakin and the galaxy.<br/></li><li>Padme\u2019s character is not fridged just so Anakin can become Darth Vader. I love and adore Padme but her character drastically changed in ROTS. She was this strong willed character who would fight for what\u2019s right, fight to keep democracy alive, she does love Anakin, but the Padme we all know in TPM, AOTC and TCW would not sit by and act like Anakin is not capable of the things he\u2019s done. <br/>Throughout ROTS, I would have it that Padme is starting the Rebellion.<br/>\n\nPadme didn&rsquo;t just meet with fellow concerned Senators; she realized that the Republic she knew, loved and fought for is dead. Padme meets with her brother Bail, Mon Mothma, Ackbar and the other leaders of The Rebellion. It is Padme\u2019s idea to start the Rebellion. She\u2019s not just meeting with concerned senators. Padme is also meeting with the Separatists.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Padme has been at war with The Separatists since she was a teenager, since The Trade Federation invaded her home Alderaan, and yet, despite all this, Padme realize that The Sith have orchestrated this war and realizes Count Dooku died because he knew too much, Padme realizes that The Republic became evil, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoWWMyFlFsU\" target=\"_blank\">The Separatists were the good guys</a>. She realizes Palpatine is the mastermind and he is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and that her husband is falling to the dark side.\u00a0\n\nPadme is willing to meet with the Separatists in order to work out how to oppose them.\u00a0<br/>When Padme realizes Anakin fell to the dark side, she realizes\u00a0the boy she knew and loved died and goes to Mustafar to try to stop him herself, she is force choked but she still lives. After the fight, Padme gives birth. Padme lives, she takes care of Leia while Luke is looked after Owen and Beru on Tatooine. Padme is not only the mother of Luke and Leia, Padme is the mother of the Rebellion. Padme\u00a0\n\n fakes her death, and goes on to lead the Rebellion to fight Palpatine and Vader. Known across the Empire as a mysterious and unknown but powerful political figure, she is among the Empire\u2019s Most Wanted. Padme made the hard decision to raise Leia while giving her son away to keep him safe. She takes charge of the mission to destroy the superweapon built by the Empire that threatens the entire galaxy. With a victory on the horizon, she takes an opportunity to reunite her family.</li><li>Anakin is a tragic character.\u00a0 There is an actual sense of friendship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, you feel a connection and not whining and loathing, you feel that Obi-Wan is glad and proud to have Anakin as his apprentice and his friend, not complaining. There is chemistry and love between Anakin and Padme, not just because we are told they are supposed to be in love. They are genuinely in love\u00a0 something that is built in the relationship along with chemistry is the relationship is not based on the superficial or lust. Padme is someone who fight\u2019s for freedom, democracy and justice. Anakin was a slave his whole life(more on that later) so I think it would be best to not just show better on screen chemistry and better writing, but both of them would have fought for each other and have their love built on freedom. It would fit for what Anidala was meant to be, both of them heroes but of course everything would fall apart once Anakin falls to the Dark Side.<br/>Now to the tragedy. Anakin\u2019s fall would actually be tragic. Anakin would have the hero\u2019s journey but it would be like a Greek tragedy. Anakin believes the Jedi are corrupt and evil. Before I go on that, I will state what the Prophecy to bring balance to the force SHOULD HAVE BEEN. <br/>I believe the \u201cBring balance to the force\u201d prophecy meant to balance and means to understand \u00a0BOTH Light and Dark sides of the force and the Jedi changed the prophecy to fit their views so the Sith can be destroyed since religions can twist things to their own benefits. <br/>The reason would be that the Jedi have become too complacent and arrogant. Believing themselves too powerful and allow their judgement to cloud their judgement and abandon the Jedi Code and Anakin realizes they are not like the Jedi of Old. He would feel that this is the only way to save the Republic. He didn\u2019t do this because of a dream(a dream in which Palpatine most likely put in his head), he did this for the future of the Republic, Padme and future of his family. I would also like to add that Anakin\u2019s slavery should be touched upon more, it should be his backstory, overcoming slavery as a young adult that he was shackled to for most of his life, proving himself as a brilliant pilot, proving himself to be a powerful and gifted Jedi strong in the force, but come to terms that he has always been a slave. Slave to the hutts, slave to his Jedi masters and he has always been Palpatine\u2019s slave(more on that later) and he goes from being a slave to being someone whose life is supposed to exist in self-denial/restraint. \u00a0the power he attains through that role is not even his own to use as he chooses, and he\u2019s constantly being told his judgement is bad (which it is, but that serves to reinforce the whole lack-of-freedom thing). \u00a0of course he\u2019s going to want freedom, and is going to associate that with power, and as he gains more power, he\u2019s going want to use that to gain more freedom. \u00a0he\u2019s never had any freedom in his life. When he becomes Darth Vader Anakin was willing to destroy himself for power and control, so he was really building up his own tomb. Making that more powerful when he asks Luke to take his mask off. He recognizes what he\u2019s always been, he was a slave all his life last to the dark side. But in choosing to take the mask off, to embrace the good in him is his casting off his shackles and in death, for the first time he is finally free. And if you view all 6 movies they are the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker.<br/></li></ul><p>James McAvoy as Obi-Wan Kenobi</p><figure data-orig-width=\"543\" data-orig-height=\"331\"

The first 6 movies are about the Skywalkers, so it makes perfect sense that Anakin should be the protagonist of the Star Wars Prequels. It\u2019s about how Anakin born a slave on Tatooine, after he wins his freedom, he leaves to start his hero\u2019s journey. Luke is the hero\u2019s journey. Anakain is how a hero falls.</li><li>\n\nAnakin grew up with his mother Shimi and they took in Owen Lars and they became as close as brothers. When Anakin tragically falls, the love Owen had for Anakin died which explains his attitude towards him in A New Hope. Owen volunteered to fight in The Clone Wars to keep his brother safe, he didn\u2019t want to fight, but he loved Anakin too much, but Owen was basically Anakin\u2019s pilot. Beru was a handmaiden to\u00a0 Padme and Owen and Beru met during the war and fell in love. Owen and Beru got along great with Anakin, Padme, Ahsoka and Obi-Wan. It is only after Anakin\u2019s fall that everything went bad. Owen blamed Obi-Wan and the Jedi for what happened to Anakin. But out of love for Anakin and Padme, he and Beru adopted Luke and raised him like he was their own.\u00a0<br></li><li>\n\nIt is Alderaan and not Naboo.\u00a0 We should know the planet that is getting destroyed in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nand It is not Amidala, it is Padme Organa, Bail is her brother. It\u2019s involvement in the prequel trilogy would have had a much greater impact; the efforts to free it from the Trade Federation ultimately pointless as audiences knew its ultimate fate. It would have also made sense that Leia grew up on her mother\u2019s home world.</li><li>Rather than Qui-Gon, Padme and Jar Jar, it\u2019s Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Padme who go to Tatooine and meet Anakin and Shmi. This way Obi-Wan establishes a bond with Anakin early on and Obi-Wan meets Shmi. When it\u2019s revealed that Qui-Gon wants to train Anakin as a Jedi, Obi-Wan agrees that he should, he is jealous that his master wants him replaced but he understands that the chosen one must become a Jedi. But Qui-Gon tells Obi-Wan that no one could ever replace him,\u00a0\u201cBen, you are like a son to me and I have loved you ever since I took you on as my Padawan</li><li>To avoid the racist stereotypes that are Jar Jar and Watto. I would cut the Gungans out entirely and replace Jar Jar and the Gungans with Ackbar and The Mon Calamari.\u00a0\n\nI feel that Jar Jar brought nothing to the story and was a unfunny racial stereotype and only there for kids appeal and because Lucas wanted to make toys.\n\nAckbar however would be crucial for The Clone Wars as an effective military leader and would be crucial in the creation of The Rebel Alliance and would be a great central character to have in the prequels.\u00a0<br>As for Watto. I would replace Watto as Anakin\u2019s master and make it so Jabba The Hutt is who is the master of Anakin and Shmi.\u00a0\n\nJabba uses Anakin to repair his droids and Pods. Shmi became in debt to the Hutts so she had to sell herself and Anakin so they could simply live. Jabba uses Bib Fortuna to crack the whip on Anakin. When Anakin enters and wins the race, Jabba is enraged and sends his thugs to kill the Skywalkers, this will begin Jabba\u2019s hatred of the Jedi. Much like Luke was helpless as The Empire kills Owen and Beru, Anakin watched helplessly as Jabba\u2019s thugs kills Shmi and as they attempt to kill him, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon saves Anakin\u2019s life.\u00a0</li><li>Make Anakin flying in the Alderaanian starship to destroy the Droid Controller matter. Have it be that Anakin wants to help Padme and her people, they would be skeptical that a child could help stop the invasion, but Padme has seen first hand how skilled Anakin is, so she agrees. So instead of Anakin not knowing how to close the ship door and destroy the controller on accident, Captain Panaka would teach Anakin how to pilot the ship and so Anakin destroys the droid controller knowing that it would stop the droids. So like Luke, Anakin helped saved the day.\u00a0</li><li>Padme is Queen, not a senator. To go with the change that Naboo should have been Alderaan and Padme Amidala should have been Padme Organa Queen Of Alderaan and head of house Organa.\n\n\nNo \u201cI was elected queen\u201d she was next in line and rules until she dies, because that\u2019s how Monarchy works.<br>Bail is her brother and prince, Breha is one of \u00a0her handmaidens and instead of doubles, she is a Queen who takes charge much like Leia was as a princess. <br>We see more scenes like the deleted scenes in ROTS and in The Clone Wars cartoon of Padme, Mon Motha, Bail Organa and the other senators. They all see how corrupt the Republic has become and view how liberty is truly lost and must fight the influence Palpatine has gotten and try to prevent the rise of the empire, but because of the clone wars, it is too late.</li><li>Use Midichlorians the same way The Clone Wars and the Darth Plagueis novel uses them.</li><li>\n\nThe Jedi Code is spoken and taught to Anakin by Obi-Wan and he learns of the Sith code by Palpatine. So that way we can learn what teachings and beliefs The Jedi and Sith believe in.<br>Jedi Code.<br><i>There is no emotion, there is peace.</i><i>There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.</i><i>There is no passion, there is serenity.</i><i>There is no chaos, there is harmony.</i><i>There is no death, there is the Force.\u201d</i>\u00a0</li><li>Palpatine would teach the Sith Code to Anakin and Maul.<br>\n\nSith Code<br>\u201c <i>Peace is a lie, there is only passion.<br></i><i>Through passion, I gain strength.<br></i><i>Through strength, I gain power.<br></i><i>Through power, I gain victory.<br></i><i>Through victory, my chains are broken.<br></i><i>The Force shall free me.\u201d</i> \n\n<br></li><li>\n\nDarth Maul is kept alive and made the main villain of the prequel trilogy. I\u2019d also give Maul a reason to want to destroy the Jedi.\u00a0<br>\u201cAt last we will reveal ourselves, at last we shall have our revenge\u201d Those words always made me thought. Why does Maul want revenge on the Jedi? So my own origin for Maul is that Maul was a Zabrak born on Irodonia. The Jedi thought there was a disturbance in the force on the village where Maul was, they thought it was the dark side and the Jedi\u2019s judgement were clouded and massacred the village with Maul\u2019s family. Maul survived. It\u2019s revealed that Palpatine clouded the Jedi\u2019s mind. The two Jedi involved were Dooku and Qui-Gon and that began their distrust and disillusion of the Council. And thus we have a personal reason for Maul wanting to have revenge against the Jedi and Qui-Gon in particular.<br>\n\nHe is however cut in half by Obi-Wan, but Palpatine saves him and his lower half is cybernetics like in the Clone Wars, because he put so much value and training into him and Maul is the perfect weapon.\u00a0\n<br>\u00a0Asajj Ventress would be Maul\u2019s apprentice. But Palpatine is pulling the strings. He would have made a great recurring villain and given Obi-Wan Kenobi greater depth too, giving him an arc over the whole trilogy. Narratively speaking, Maul\u2019s death could have fit the same role as General Grievous; an act that would end the Clone Wars and bring his story full circle.<br>Now speaking of \u00a0Asajj Ventress as Maul\u2019s apprentice. <br>Maul would have found Ventress on Dathomir and he would train her to be his apprentice. \u00a0But their relationship would be different from Dooku and Ventress and Maul and Savage, Maul and Ventress would be lovers and their combined passion is what makes them together deadly. Unlike Dooku, he would not attempt to kill her, he would instead plot with her to take over the Sith and otherthrow Sidious as Mother Talzin would instruct them to get revenge on Sidious for her. Ventress would attempt to assassinate Palpatine and of course he kills her, so in revenge Maul and Grievous \u00a0kidnaps Sidious and in ROTS, Maul is responsible for cutting off Anakin\u2019s arm and killing Satine. Both Anakin and Obi-Wan have reasons for wanting Maul dead and Maul has been dying to kill Obi-Wan ever since Alderaan and he has always seen the chosen one as a threat. Together Anakin and Obi-Wan defeat Maul. Obi-Wan would restrain himself for taking revenge on Maul. But because of this, Maul force pushes Obi-Wan and with him out of the way, Anakin and Obi-Wan fight to the death. They are equally matched, but in the end, Anakin destroys Maul\u2019s double bladed lightsaber and chops his arms off. Maul is at Anakin\u2019s mercy and Palpatine demands him to kill Maul and that is the end of Maul<br></li><li>\n\nWe could either have the Clone Wars being similar with the Clones being Clones of Jango, Mandalorians led by Jango Fett vs able bodied men who are trained and drafted from each of the republic\u2019s worlds. They are Stormtroopers. It is called The Clone Wars because of the Mandalorians and Stormtroopers\u2019 armor look the same and the fight with the Mandalorians are never ending. or\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtU_eTf6wdrs%26t%3D4s&amp;t=YzA2ZjQ2Mzc3ZTJhODVlY2FlMmMxNzk2YmZiYzlhYTNiODM3ZTNjNixmaTFPNlh5bQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AH7fufnj4oDBHXG8OLtOW1A&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdalekofchaos.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F120833241057%2Fthings-i-would-change-about-the-star-wars-prequels&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Clone Wars would be completely different. </a> Basically what was originally intended. The Clones were meant to be the villains. in The Thrawn Trilogy, cast the Clone Masters as the opponents of the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars, as several authors of the \u201890s considered that the cloners and their clones were the \u201cvillains.\u201d fighting the Jedi and the Republic. You can have the CIS leaders and Jango Fett aiding the Clone Masters, if anything, The Clone Masters were the original Rebels.\n\n<br></li><li>Ahsoka\u2019s characterization would be the same as would the Jedi.</li><li>The main leaders of the Separatists are Count Dooku, Darth Maul and General Grievous, along with the other various leaders we have seen in the Clone Wars.<br></li><li>Count Dooku would not be the Sith Lord we knew, but he would be a Grey Jedi. He was Qui-Gon\u2019s master, so naturally he would have the same views of the force and distrust in the Council as Qui-Gon did. He would still be one of the leaders of the separatists but unlike in canon, Dooku\u2019s reasons for defecting to the CIS is exactly what he told Obi-Wan in Attack Of The Clones. The Sith control the senate and the Republic. The Republic has become a pawn of the Sith and the Jedi have become to arrogant and complacent and wanting to free the galaxy from a corrupt Republic and from the Sith. But before it\u2019s too late Dooku realizes he was an unwilling pawn of Darth SIdious in creating The Clone Wars and when he has outlived his usefulness, Sidious sends Darth Maul to silence Dooku.<br></li><li>General Grievous \u00a0is like he was in the 2003 Clone Wars Cartoon and his EU comics who was a badass general capable of strategic thinking and the badass cyborg who was capable of killing entire teams of Jedi Knights and capable of fighting Jedi Masters with ease. He is nothing like he was in The Clone Wars show and Revenge Of The Sith which portrays him as an incapable and incompetent general who was taken down by Gungans.. He is brutal, efficient, calculating, trained by both Count Dooku and Darth Maul showing why he is deadly with the lightsaber. Instead of showing him beaten time and time again by people who he would have killed in his old lore and the 2003 Clone Wars cartoon and running away like a pathetic coward, we actually see Grievous get to kill the Jedi, even showing the best Knights and even some masters die by his hands. There\u2019s a reason he was a warlord of his people and supreme commander of the CIS and put fear in the Jedi.<br>His backstory would be like what he had in the EU<br></li><li>Jango Fett lives longer and is Mandalore and leads The Mandalorians against The Republic and Separatists. Instead of being asked to be a donor for the Clone army, Jango at first joins the Separatists, however he views them as weak and would not allow the Mandalorians to become pawns of the Sith once again. Boba would be a teenager and not a kid so we can see that Boba Fett is a Mandalorian warrior and just as great as Jango and we are seen how badass Boba Fett really is since we were cheated out of him as a great villain in ROTJ.<br>Before I talk more I must tell fans what Mandalore and who The Mandalorians are. <br>The title of Mandalore was the Galactic Basic Standard transliteration of the Mando'a word Mand'alor, which meant \u201csole ruler\u201d in the Mandalorian language. The position of Mand'alor was a combination of king, warlord, and general in function, often carrying with it the additional title of Al'Ori'Ramikade, \u201cCommander of Supercommandos.\u201d A non-hereditary role, only a Mandalorian deemed worthy could claim the title of Mand'alor, exemplifying the Mandalorian meritocracy ideal. When the previous Mandalore fell or stepped down, a Mandalorian with both vision and strength could make a claim for the title, but if the other clans did not accept the individual as the new Mand'alor and recognize their authority, their duty was to remove the unsuitable claimant and institute a more favorable leader. The significance of the Mand'alor\u2019s role in Mandalorian society was so great that one of the Resol'nare\u2014the six basic tenets that defined Mandalorian culture\u2014detailed the importance of loyalty toward the Mand'alor, and rallying to the Mandalorian leader when called upon. <br>The Mandalorians\u2014known in Mando'a as the Mando'ade, or \u201cChildren of Mandalore\"\u2014were a nomadic group of clan-based people consisting of members from multiple species and multiple genders, all bound by a common culture.In their early years, Mandalorian culture revolved around battle, with war being a source of honor and pride in their community. <br>Now the comic Open Seasons would indeed be Jango\u2019s origin, however I would change it so that his tribe wasn\u2019t wiped out by the Jedi, instead what happens is a fight to the death between Jango Fett and Tor Vizla would determine who controls the Mandalorian clans. Jango Fett of course wins and becomes Mandalore. Jango is not killed by Mace, however Jango is able to wound and scar Mace with his flamethrower, the Jedi\u2019s arrogance cloud\u2019s his judgement and is beaten by Jango but does not die. Jango betraying Darth Maul and The Separatists is not taken lightly. Darth Maul fights Jango Fett for everyone to see and Darth Maul kills him. Boba enraged, continues his father\u2019s war and takes up the mantle of Mandalore. However Boba Fett does not see a difference between Jedi and Sith, he sees them one in the same and blame\u2019s his father\u2019s death on the Jedi for allowing the Sith to exist and for former Jedi to fall to the dark side. Where Obi-Wan\u2019s villain would be Darth Maul, Anakin\u2019s would be Boba Fett. In The Clone Wars, Boba Fett would be just annihilating The Republic until Anakin and the 501st fights back and Boba meets his match, Boba Fett a worthy antagonist and Anakin\u2019s campaign with The Mandalorians would test him and it ends with Anakin destroying the Mandalorians and leaving Boba Fett a broken man who is forced to become a Bounty Hunter with the Mandalorians all but destroyed, showing us the Bounty Hunter he became working for Jabba The Hutt. \u00a0\u00a0<br></li><li>Palpatine is not the two dimensional laughable villain we got in the prequels, he is written to be a more complex villain. \u00a0Basically I believe Palpatine should have been like Alexander Pierce from CATWS. Pierce is cold. He is calculating. He knows how to manipulate people into doing what he wants. He\u2019s not afraid to use pawns and sacrifice them accordingly. He\u2019s an abuser and unapologetic and willing to take out millions of people for his vision, however fucked up that vision is, of the greater good. This is the Palpatine I wanted, however in this case it would be on a galactic scale. Tired of corruption and unrest in the senate, he is greeted by Darth Plaugeis and offers to give what Palpatine has always wanted, peace and offers to train him in the dark side of the force. Palpatine would learn everything Plagueis knew, even his ability to create life and then killing him. Palpatine\u2019s motivation would be wanting to force peace, stability and order in the Republic, however to ensure this he had to create The Clones and The Clone Wars. He needed Dooku to create unrest and to create the CIS and he needed the jedi out of the way. Then he would have completely justified his every action. Every action that destroys democracy, every action that causes civil unrest and it\u2019s all in the name of \u201cpeace\u201d The Prequels would explore his decent into madness and meglomania. Palpatine slowly becomes more power-hungry and how he keeps justifying himself with all the horrible things he does until he\u2019s the cackling \u201cAnd now, young Skywalker\u2026you will die\u2026\u201d man we see in Return of the Jedi.<br></li><li>\n\nIt would be revealed that Palpatine learned all there is to know from Darth Plagueis so he used his power to create life, to create Anakin manipulating the events throughout his life and used him to be his ultimate tool to destroy the Jedi\n\n<br></li><li>Yoda and Obi-Wan go into exile \u00a0not only because they are in hiding from Vader and The Empire, but because they realized The Jedi failed the galaxy, they created Darth Vader and the Empire, they feel guilt and when he is fighting Anakin and after he defeats his former friend, he tells him how much not only he but the Jedi have failed Anakin and the galaxy.<br></li><li>Padme\u2019s character is not fridged just so Anakin can become Darth Vader. I love and adore Padme but her character drastically changed in ROTS. She was this strong willed character who would fight for what\u2019s right, fight to keep democracy alive, she does love Anakin, but the Padme we all know in TPM, AOTC and TCW would not sit by and act like Anakin is not capable of the things he\u2019s done. <br>Throughout ROTS, I would have it that Padme is starting the Rebellion.<br>\n\nPadme didn\u2019t just meet with fellow concerned Senators; she realized that the Republic she knew, loved and fought for is dead. Padme meets with her brother Bail, Mon Mothma, Ackbar and the other leaders of The Rebellion. It is Padme\u2019s idea to start the Rebellion. She\u2019s not just meeting with concerned senators. Padme is also meeting with the Separatists.\u00a0\u00a0<br>Padme has been at war with The Separatists since she was a teenager, since The Trade Federation invaded her home Alderaan, and yet, despite all this, Padme realize that The Sith have orchestrated this war and realizes Count Dooku died because he knew too much, Padme realizes that The Republic became evil, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoWWMyFlFsU\" target=\"_blank\">The Separatists were the good guys</a>. She realizes Palpatine is the mastermind and he is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and that her husband is falling to the dark side.\u00a0\n\nPadme is willing to meet with the Separatists in order to work out how to oppose them.\u00a0<br>When Padme realizes Anakin fell to the dark side, she realizes\u00a0the boy she knew and loved died and goes to Mustafar to try to stop him herself, she is force choked but she still lives. After the fight, Padme gives birth. Padme lives, she takes care of Leia while Luke is looked after Owen and Beru on Tatooine. Padme is not only the mother of Luke and Leia, Padme is the mother of the Rebellion. Padme\u00a0\n\n fakes her death, and goes on to lead the Rebellion to fight Palpatine and Vader. Known across the Empire as a mysterious and unknown but powerful political figure, she is among the Empire\u2019s Most Wanted. Padme made the hard decision to raise Leia while giving her son away to keep him safe. She takes charge of the mission to destroy the superweapon built by the Empire that threatens the entire galaxy. With a victory on the horizon, she takes an opportunity to reunite her family.</li><li>Anakin is a tragic character.\u00a0 There is an actual sense of friendship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, you feel a connection and not whining and loathing, you feel that Obi-Wan is glad and proud to have Anakin as his apprentice and his friend, not complaining. There is chemistry and love between Anakin and Padme, not just because we are told they are supposed to be in love. They are genuinely in love\u00a0 something that is built in the relationship along with chemistry is the relationship is not based on the superficial or lust. Padme is someone who fight\u2019s for freedom, democracy and justice. Anakin was a slave his whole life(more on that later) so I think it would be best to not just show better on screen chemistry and better writing, but both of them would have fought for each other and have their love built on freedom. It would fit for what Anidala was meant to be, both of them heroes but of course everything would fall apart once Anakin falls to the Dark Side.<br>Now to the tragedy. Anakin\u2019s fall would actually be tragic. Anakin would have the hero\u2019s journey but it would be like a Greek tragedy. Anakin believes the Jedi are corrupt and evil. Before I go on that, I will state what the Prophecy to bring balance to the force SHOULD HAVE BEEN. <br>I believe the \u201cBring balance to the force\u201d prophecy meant to balance and means to understand \u00a0BOTH Light and Dark sides of the force and the Jedi changed the prophecy to fit their views so the Sith can be destroyed since religions can twist things to their own benefits. <br>The reason would be that the Jedi have become too complacent and arrogant. Believing themselves too powerful and allow their judgement to cloud their judgement and abandon the Jedi Code and Anakin realizes they are not like the Jedi of Old. He would feel that this is the only way to save the Republic. He didn\u2019t do this because of a dream(a dream in which Palpatine most likely put in his head), he did this for the future of the Republic, Padme and future of his family. I would also like to add that Anakin\u2019s slavery should be touched upon more, it should be his backstory, overcoming slavery as a young adult that he was shackled to for most of his life, proving himself as a brilliant pilot, proving himself to be a powerful and gifted Jedi strong in the force, but come to terms that he has always been a slave. Slave to the hutts, slave to his Jedi masters and he has always been Palpatine\u2019s slave(more on that later) and he goes from being a slave to being someone whose life is supposed to exist in self-denial/restraint. \u00a0the power he attains through that role is not even his own to use as he chooses, and he\u2019s constantly being told his judgement is bad (which it is, but that serves to reinforce the whole lack-of-freedom thing). \u00a0of course he\u2019s going to want freedom, and is going to associate that with power, and as he gains more power, he\u2019s going want to use that to gain more freedom. \u00a0he\u2019s never had any freedom in his life. When he becomes Darth Vader Anakin was willing to destroy himself for power and control, so he was really building up his own tomb. Making that more powerful when he asks Luke to take his mask off. He recognizes what he\u2019s always been, he was a slave all his life last to the dark side. But in choosing to take the mask off, to embrace the good in him is his casting off his shackles and in death, for the first time he is finally free. And if you view all 6 movies they are the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker.<br></li></ul><p>James McAvoy as Obi-Wan Kenobi</p><figure data-orig-width=\"543\" data-orig-height=\"331\"

The first 6 movies are about the Skywalkers, so it makes perfect sense that Anakin should be the protagonist of the Star Wars Prequels. It\u2019s about how Anakin born a slave on Tatooine, after he wins his freedom, he leaves to start his hero\u2019s journey. Luke is the hero\u2019s journey. Anakain is how a hero falls.</li><li>\n\nAnakin grew up with his mother Shimi and they took in Owen Lars and they became as close as brothers. When Anakin tragically falls, the love Owen had for Anakin died which explains his attitude towards him in A New Hope. Owen volunteered to fight in The Clone Wars to keep his brother safe, he didn\u2019t want to fight, but he loved Anakin too much, but Owen was basically Anakin\u2019s pilot. Beru was a handmaiden to\u00a0 Padme and Owen and Beru met during the war and fell in love. Owen and Beru got along great with Anakin, Padme, Ahsoka and Obi-Wan. It is only after Anakin\u2019s fall that everything went bad. Owen blamed Obi-Wan and the Jedi for what happened to Anakin. But out of love for Anakin and Padme, he and Beru adopted Luke and raised him like he was their own.\u00a0<br></li><li>\n\nIt is Alderaan and not Naboo.\u00a0 We should know the planet that is getting destroyed in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nand It is not Amidala, it is Padme Organa, Bail is her brother. It\u2019s involvement in the prequel trilogy would have had a much greater impact; the efforts to free it from the Trade Federation ultimately pointless as audiences knew its ultimate fate. It would have also made sense that Leia grew up on her mother\u2019s home world.</li><li>Rather than Qui-Gon, Padme and Jar Jar, it\u2019s Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Padme who go to Tatooine and meet Anakin and Shmi. This way Obi-Wan establishes a bond with Anakin early on and Obi-Wan meets Shmi. When it\u2019s revealed that Qui-Gon wants to train Anakin as a Jedi, Obi-Wan agrees that he should, he is jealous that his master wants him replaced but he understands that the chosen one must become a Jedi. But Qui-Gon tells Obi-Wan that no one could ever replace him,\u00a0\u201cBen, you are like a son to me and I have loved you ever since I took you on as my Padawan</li><li>To avoid the racist stereotypes that are Jar Jar and Watto. I would cut the Gungans out entirely and replace Jar Jar and the Gungans with Ackbar and The Mon Calamari.\u00a0\n\nI feel that Jar Jar brought nothing to the story and was a unfunny racial stereotype and only there for kids appeal and because Lucas wanted to make toys.\n\nAckbar however would be crucial for The Clone Wars as an effective military leader and would be crucial in the creation of The Rebel Alliance and would be a great central character to have in the prequels.\u00a0<br>As for Watto. I would replace Watto as Anakin\u2019s master and make it so Jabba The Hutt is who is the master of Anakin and Shmi.\u00a0\n\nJabba uses Anakin to repair his droids and Pods. Shmi became in debt to the Hutts so she had to sell herself and Anakin so they could simply live. Jabba uses Bib Fortuna to crack the whip on Anakin. When Anakin enters and wins the race, Jabba is enraged and sends his thugs to kill the Skywalkers, this will begin Jabba\u2019s hatred of the Jedi. Much like Luke was helpless as The Empire kills Owen and Beru, Anakin watched helplessly as Jabba\u2019s thugs kills Shmi and as they attempt to kill him, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon saves Anakin\u2019s life.\u00a0</li><li>Make Anakin flying in the Alderaanian starship to destroy the Droid Controller matter. Have it be that Anakin wants to help Padme and her people, they would be skeptical that a child could help stop the invasion, but Padme has seen first hand how skilled Anakin is, so she agrees. So instead of Anakin not knowing how to close the ship door and destroy the controller on accident, Captain Panaka would teach Anakin how to pilot the ship and so Anakin destroys the droid controller knowing that it would stop the droids. So like Luke, Anakin helped saved the day.\u00a0</li><li>Padme is Queen, not a senator. To go with the change that Naboo should have been Alderaan and Padme Amidala should have been Padme Organa Queen Of Alderaan and head of house Organa.\n\n\nNo \u201cI was elected queen\u201d she was next in line and rules until she dies, because that\u2019s how Monarchy works.<br>Bail is her brother and prince, Breha is one of \u00a0her handmaidens and instead of doubles, she is a Queen who takes charge much like Leia was as a princess. <br>We see more scenes like the deleted scenes in ROTS and in The Clone Wars cartoon of Padme, Mon Motha, Bail Organa and the other senators. They all see how corrupt the Republic has become and view how liberty is truly lost and must fight the influence Palpatine has gotten and try to prevent the rise of the empire, but because of the clone wars, it is too late.</li><li>Use Midichlorians the same way The Clone Wars and the Darth Plagueis novel uses them.</li><li>\n\nThe Jedi Code is spoken and taught to Anakin by Obi-Wan and he learns of the Sith code by Palpatine. So that way we can learn what teachings and beliefs The Jedi and Sith believe in.<br>Jedi Code.<br><i>There is no emotion, there is peace.</i><i>There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.</i><i>There is no passion, there is serenity.</i><i>There is no chaos, there is harmony.</i><i>There is no death, there is the Force.\u201d</i>\u00a0</li><li>Palpatine would teach the Sith Code to Anakin and Maul.<br>\n\nSith Code<br>\u201c <i>Peace is a lie, there is only passion.<br></i><i>Through passion, I gain strength.<br></i><i>Through strength, I gain power.<br></i><i>Through power, I gain victory.<br></i><i>Through victory, my chains are broken.<br></i><i>The Force shall free me.\u201d</i> \n\n<br></li><li>\n\nDarth Maul is kept alive and made the main villain of the prequel trilogy. I\u2019d also give Maul a reason to want to destroy the Jedi.\u00a0<br>\u201cAt last we will reveal ourselves, at last we shall have our revenge\u201d Those words always made me thought. Why does Maul want revenge on the Jedi? So my own origin for Maul is that Maul was a Zabrak born on Irodonia. The Jedi thought there was a disturbance in the force on the village where Maul was, they thought it was the dark side and the Jedi\u2019s judgement were clouded and massacred the village with Maul\u2019s family. Maul survived. It\u2019s revealed that Palpatine clouded the Jedi\u2019s mind. The two Jedi involved were Dooku and Qui-Gon and that began their distrust and disillusion of the Council. And thus we have a personal reason for Maul wanting to have revenge against the Jedi and Qui-Gon in particular.<br>\n\nHe is however cut in half by Obi-Wan, but Palpatine saves him and his lower half is cybernetics like in the Clone Wars, because he put so much value and training into him and Maul is the perfect weapon.\u00a0\n<br>\u00a0Asajj Ventress would be Maul\u2019s apprentice. But Palpatine is pulling the strings. He would have made a great recurring villain and given Obi-Wan Kenobi greater depth too, giving him an arc over the whole trilogy. Narratively speaking, Maul\u2019s death could have fit the same role as General Grievous; an act that would end the Clone Wars and bring his story full circle.<br>Now speaking of \u00a0Asajj Ventress as Maul\u2019s apprentice. <br>Maul would have found Ventress on Dathomir and he would train her to be his apprentice. \u00a0But their relationship would be different from Dooku and Ventress and Maul and Savage, Maul and Ventress would be lovers and their combined passion is what makes them together deadly. Unlike Dooku, he would not attempt to kill her, he would instead plot with her to take over the Sith and otherthrow Sidious as Mother Talzin would instruct them to get revenge on Sidious for her. Ventress would attempt to assassinate Palpatine and of course he kills her, so in revenge Maul and Grievous \u00a0kidnaps Sidious and in ROTS, Maul is responsible for cutting off Anakin\u2019s arm and killing Satine. Both Anakin and Obi-Wan have reasons for wanting Maul dead and Maul has been dying to kill Obi-Wan ever since Alderaan and he has always seen the chosen one as a threat. Together Anakin and Obi-Wan defeat Maul. Obi-Wan would restrain himself for taking revenge on Maul. But because of this, Maul force pushes Obi-Wan and with him out of the way, Anakin and Obi-Wan fight to the death. They are equally matched, but in the end, Anakin destroys Maul\u2019s double bladed lightsaber and chops his arms off. Maul is at Anakin\u2019s mercy and Palpatine demands him to kill Maul and that is the end of Maul<br></li><li>\n\nWe could either have the Clone Wars being similar with the Clones being Clones of Jango, Mandalorians led by Jango Fett vs able bodied men who are trained and drafted from each of the republic\u2019s worlds. They are Stormtroopers. It is called The Clone Wars because of the Mandalorians and Stormtroopers\u2019 armor look the same and the fight with the Mandalorians are never ending. or\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtU_eTf6wdrs%26t%3D4s&amp;t=YzA2ZjQ2Mzc3ZTJhODVlY2FlMmMxNzk2YmZiYzlhYTNiODM3ZTNjNixmaTFPNlh5bQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AH7fufnj4oDBHXG8OLtOW1A&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdalekofchaos.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F120833241057%2Fthings-i-would-change-about-the-star-wars-prequels&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Clone Wars would be completely different. </a> Basically what was originally intended. The Clones were meant to be the villains. in The Thrawn Trilogy, cast the Clone Masters as the opponents of the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars, as several authors of the \u201890s considered that the cloners and their clones were the \u201cvillains.\u201d fighting the Jedi and the Republic. You can have the CIS leaders and Jango Fett aiding the Clone Masters, if anything, The Clone Masters were the original Rebels.\n\n<br></li><li>Ahsoka\u2019s characterization would be the same as would the Jedi.</li><li>The main leaders of the Separatists are Count Dooku, Darth Maul and General Grievous, along with the other various leaders we have seen in the Clone Wars.<br></li><li>Count Dooku would not be the Sith Lord we knew, but he would be a Grey Jedi. He was Qui-Gon\u2019s master, so naturally he would have the same views of the force and distrust in the Council as Qui-Gon did. He would still be one of the leaders of the separatists but unlike in canon, Dooku\u2019s reasons for defecting to the CIS is exactly what he told Obi-Wan in Attack Of The Clones. The Sith control the senate and the Republic. The Republic has become a pawn of the Sith and the Jedi have become to arrogant and complacent and wanting to free the galaxy from a corrupt Republic and from the Sith. But before it\u2019s too late Dooku realizes he was an unwilling pawn of Darth SIdious in creating The Clone Wars and when he has outlived his usefulness, Sidious sends Darth Maul to silence Dooku.<br></li><li>General Grievous \u00a0is like he was in the 2003 Clone Wars Cartoon and his EU comics who was a badass general capable of strategic thinking and the badass cyborg who was capable of killing entire teams of Jedi Knights and capable of fighting Jedi Masters with ease. He is nothing like he was in The Clone Wars show and Revenge Of The Sith which portrays him as an incapable and incompetent general who was taken down by Gungans.. He is brutal, efficient, calculating, trained by both Count Dooku and Darth Maul showing why he is deadly with the lightsaber. Instead of showing him beaten time and time again by people who he would have killed in his old lore and the 2003 Clone Wars cartoon and running away like a pathetic coward, we actually see Grievous get to kill the Jedi, even showing the best Knights and even some masters die by his hands. There\u2019s a reason he was a warlord of his people and supreme commander of the CIS and put fear in the Jedi.<br>His backstory would be like what he had in the EU<br></li><li>Jango Fett lives longer and is Mandalore and leads The Mandalorians against The Republic and Separatists. Instead of being asked to be a donor for the Clone army, Jango at first joins the Separatists, however he views them as weak and would not allow the Mandalorians to become pawns of the Sith once again. Boba would be a teenager and not a kid so we can see that Boba Fett is a Mandalorian warrior and just as great as Jango and we are seen how badass Boba Fett really is since we were cheated out of him as a great villain in ROTJ.<br>Before I talk more I must tell fans what Mandalore and who The Mandalorians are. <br>The title of Mandalore was the Galactic Basic Standard transliteration of the Mando'a word Mand'alor, which meant \u201csole ruler\u201d in the Mandalorian language. The position of Mand'alor was a combination of king, warlord, and general in function, often carrying with it the additional title of Al'Ori'Ramikade, \u201cCommander of Supercommandos.\u201d A non-hereditary role, only a Mandalorian deemed worthy could claim the title of Mand'alor, exemplifying the Mandalorian meritocracy ideal. When the previous Mandalore fell or stepped down, a Mandalorian with both vision and strength could make a claim for the title, but if the other clans did not accept the individual as the new Mand'alor and recognize their authority, their duty was to remove the unsuitable claimant and institute a more favorable leader. The significance of the Mand'alor\u2019s role in Mandalorian society was so great that one of the Resol'nare\u2014the six basic tenets that defined Mandalorian culture\u2014detailed the importance of loyalty toward the Mand'alor, and rallying to the Mandalorian leader when called upon. <br>The Mandalorians\u2014known in Mando'a as the Mando'ade, or \u201cChildren of Mandalore\"\u2014were a nomadic group of clan-based people consisting of members from multiple species and multiple genders, all bound by a common culture.In their early years, Mandalorian culture revolved around battle, with war being a source of honor and pride in their community. <br>Now the comic Open Seasons would indeed be Jango\u2019s origin, however I would change it so that his tribe wasn\u2019t wiped out by the Jedi, instead what happens is a fight to the death between Jango Fett and Tor Vizla would determine who controls the Mandalorian clans. Jango Fett of course wins and becomes Mandalore. Jango is not killed by Mace, however Jango is able to wound and scar Mace with his flamethrower, the Jedi\u2019s arrogance cloud\u2019s his judgement and is beaten by Jango but does not die. Jango betraying Darth Maul and The Separatists is not taken lightly. Darth Maul fights Jango Fett for everyone to see and Darth Maul kills him. Boba enraged, continues his father\u2019s war and takes up the mantle of Mandalore. However Boba Fett does not see a difference between Jedi and Sith, he sees them one in the same and blame\u2019s his father\u2019s death on the Jedi for allowing the Sith to exist and for former Jedi to fall to the dark side. Where Obi-Wan\u2019s villain would be Darth Maul, Anakin\u2019s would be Boba Fett. In The Clone Wars, Boba Fett would be just annihilating The Republic until Anakin and the 501st fights back and Boba meets his match, Boba Fett a worthy antagonist and Anakin\u2019s campaign with The Mandalorians would test him and it ends with Anakin destroying the Mandalorians and leaving Boba Fett a broken man who is forced to become a Bounty Hunter with the Mandalorians all but destroyed, showing us the Bounty Hunter he became working for Jabba The Hutt. \u00a0\u00a0<br></li><li>Palpatine is not the two dimensional laughable villain we got in the prequels, he is written to be a more complex villain. \u00a0Basically I believe Palpatine should have been like Alexander Pierce from CATWS. Pierce is cold. He is calculating. He knows how to manipulate people into doing what he wants. He\u2019s not afraid to use pawns and sacrifice them accordingly. He\u2019s an abuser and unapologetic and willing to take out millions of people for his vision, however fucked up that vision is, of the greater good. This is the Palpatine I wanted, however in this case it would be on a galactic scale. Tired of corruption and unrest in the senate, he is greeted by Darth Plaugeis and offers to give what Palpatine has always wanted, peace and offers to train him in the dark side of the force. Palpatine would learn everything Plagueis knew, even his ability to create life and then killing him. Palpatine\u2019s motivation would be wanting to force peace, stability and order in the Republic, however to ensure this he had to create The Clones and The Clone Wars. He needed Dooku to create unrest and to create the CIS and he needed the jedi out of the way. Then he would have completely justified his every action. Every action that destroys democracy, every action that causes civil unrest and it\u2019s all in the name of \u201cpeace\u201d The Prequels would explore his decent into madness and meglomania. Palpatine slowly becomes more power-hungry and how he keeps justifying himself with all the horrible things he does until he\u2019s the cackling \u201cAnd now, young Skywalker\u2026you will die\u2026\u201d man we see in Return of the Jedi.<br></li><li>\n\nIt would be revealed that Palpatine learned all there is to know from Darth Plagueis so he used his power to create life, to create Anakin manipulating the events throughout his life and used him to be his ultimate tool to destroy the Jedi\n\n<br></li><li>Yoda and Obi-Wan go into exile \u00a0not only because they are in hiding from Vader and The Empire, but because they realized The Jedi failed the galaxy, they created Darth Vader and the Empire, they feel guilt and when he is fighting Anakin and after he defeats his former friend, he tells him how much not only he but the Jedi have failed Anakin and the galaxy.<br></li><li>Padme\u2019s character is not fridged just so Anakin can become Darth Vader. I love and adore Padme but her character drastically changed in ROTS. She was this strong willed character who would fight for what\u2019s right, fight to keep democracy alive, she does love Anakin, but the Padme we all know in TPM, AOTC and TCW would not sit by and act like Anakin is not capable of the things he\u2019s done. <br>Throughout ROTS, I would have it that Padme is starting the Rebellion.<br>\n\nPadme didn\u2019t just meet with fellow concerned Senators; she realized that the Republic she knew, loved and fought for is dead. Padme meets with her brother Bail, Mon Mothma, Ackbar and the other leaders of The Rebellion. It is Padme\u2019s idea to start the Rebellion. She\u2019s not just meeting with concerned senators. Padme is also meeting with the Separatists.\u00a0\u00a0<br>Padme has been at war with The Separatists since she was a teenager, since The Trade Federation invaded her home Alderaan, and yet, despite all this, Padme realize that The Sith have orchestrated this war and realizes Count Dooku died because he knew too much, Padme realizes that The Republic became evil, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoWWMyFlFsU\" target=\"_blank\">The Separatists were the good guys</a>. She realizes Palpatine is the mastermind and he is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and that her husband is falling to the dark side.\u00a0\n\nPadme is willing to meet with the Separatists in order to work out how to oppose them.\u00a0<br>When Padme realizes Anakin fell to the dark side, she realizes\u00a0the boy she knew and loved died and goes to Mustafar to try to stop him herself, she is force choked but she still lives. After the fight, Padme gives birth. Padme lives, she takes care of Leia while Luke is looked after Owen and Beru on Tatooine. Padme is not only the mother of Luke and Leia, Padme is the mother of the Rebellion. Padme\u00a0\n\n fakes her death, and goes on to lead the Rebellion to fight Palpatine and Vader. Known across the Empire as a mysterious and unknown but powerful political figure, she is among the Empire\u2019s Most Wanted. Padme made the hard decision to raise Leia while giving her son away to keep him safe. She takes charge of the mission to destroy the superweapon built by the Empire that threatens the entire galaxy. With a victory on the horizon, she takes an opportunity to reunite her family.</li><li>Anakin is a tragic character.\u00a0 There is an actual sense of friendship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, you feel a connection and not whining and loathing, you feel that Obi-Wan is glad and proud to have Anakin as his apprentice and his friend, not complaining. There is chemistry and love between Anakin and Padme, not just because we are told they are supposed to be in love. They are genuinely in love\u00a0 something that is built in the relationship along with chemistry is the relationship is not based on the superficial or lust. Padme is someone who fight\u2019s for freedom, democracy and justice. Anakin was a slave his whole life(more on that later) so I think it would be best to not just show better on screen chemistry and better writing, but both of them would have fought for each other and have their love built on freedom. It would fit for what Anidala was meant to be, both of them heroes but of course everything would fall apart once Anakin falls to the Dark Side.<br>Now to the tragedy. Anakin\u2019s fall would actually be tragic. Anakin would have the hero\u2019s journey but it would be like a Greek tragedy. Anakin believes the Jedi are corrupt and evil. Before I go on that, I will state what the Prophecy to bring balance to the force SHOULD HAVE BEEN. <br>I believe the \u201cBring balance to the force\u201d prophecy meant to balance and means to understand \u00a0BOTH Light and Dark sides of the force and the Jedi changed the prophecy to fit their views so the Sith can be destroyed since religions can twist things to their own benefits. <br>The reason would be that the Jedi have become too complacent and arrogant. Believing themselves too powerful and allow their judgement to cloud their judgement and abandon the Jedi Code and Anakin realizes they are not like the Jedi of Old. He would feel that this is the only way to save the Republic. He didn\u2019t do this because of a dream(a dream in which Palpatine most likely put in his head), he did this for the future of the Republic, Padme and future of his family. I would also like to add that Anakin\u2019s slavery should be touched upon more, it should be his backstory, overcoming slavery as a young adult that he was shackled to for most of his life, proving himself as a brilliant pilot, proving himself to be a powerful and gifted Jedi strong in the force, but come to terms that he has always been a slave. Slave to the hutts, slave to his Jedi masters and he has always been Palpatine\u2019s slave(more on that later) and he goes from being a slave to being someone whose life is supposed to exist in self-denial/restraint. \u00a0the power he attains through that role is not even his own to use as he chooses, and he\u2019s constantly being told his judgement is bad (which it is, but that serves to reinforce the whole lack-of-freedom thing). \u00a0of course he\u2019s going to want freedom, and is going to associate that with power, and as he gains more power, he\u2019s going want to use that to gain more freedom. \u00a0he\u2019s never had any freedom in his life. When he becomes Darth Vader Anakin was willing to destroy himself for power and control, so he was really building up his own tomb. Making that more powerful when he asks Luke to take his mask off. He recognizes what he\u2019s always been, he was a slave all his life last to the dark side. But in choosing to take the mask off, to embrace the good in him is his casting off his shackles and in death, for the first time he is finally free. And if you view all 6 movies they are the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker.<br></li></ul><p>James McAvoy as Obi-Wan Kenobi</p><figure data-orig-width=\"543\" data-orig-height=\"331\"

The first 6 movies are about the Skywalkers, so it makes perfect sense that Anakin should be the protagonist of the Star Wars Prequels. It&rsquo;s about how Anakin born a slave on Tatooine, after he wins his freedom, he leaves to start his hero&rsquo;s journey. Luke is the hero&rsquo;s journey. Anakain is how a hero falls.</li><li>\n\nAnakin grew up with his mother Shimi and they took in Owen Lars and they became as close as brothers. When Anakin tragically falls, the love Owen had for Anakin died which explains his attitude towards him in A New Hope. Owen volunteered to fight in The Clone Wars to keep his brother safe, he didn&rsquo;t want to fight, but he loved Anakin too much, but Owen was basically Anakin&rsquo;s pilot. Beru was a handmaiden to&nbsp; Padme and Owen and Beru met during the war and fell in love. Owen and Beru got along great with Anakin, Padme, Ahsoka and Obi-Wan. It is only after Anakin&rsquo;s fall that everything went bad. Owen blamed Obi-Wan and the Jedi for what happened to Anakin. But out of love for Anakin and Padme, he and Beru adopted Luke and raised him like he was their own.&nbsp;<br /></li><li>\n\nIt is Alderaan and not Naboo.&nbsp; We should know the planet that is getting destroyed in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nand It is not Amidala, it is Padme Organa, Bail is her brother. It&rsquo;s involvement in the prequel trilogy would have had a much greater impact; the efforts to free it from the Trade Federation ultimately pointless as audiences knew its ultimate fate. It would have also made sense that Leia grew up on her mother&rsquo;s home world.</li><li>Rather than Qui-Gon, Padme and Jar Jar, it&rsquo;s Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Padme who go to Tatooine and meet Anakin and Shmi. This way Obi-Wan establishes a bond with Anakin early on and Obi-Wan meets Shmi. When it&rsquo;s revealed that Qui-Gon wants to train Anakin as a Jedi, Obi-Wan agrees that he should, he is jealous that his master wants him replaced but he understands that the chosen one must become a Jedi. But Qui-Gon tells Obi-Wan that no one could ever replace him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Ben, you are like a son to me and I have loved you ever since I took you on as my Padawan</li><li>To avoid the racist stereotypes that are Jar Jar and Watto. I would cut the Gungans out entirely and replace Jar Jar and the Gungans with Ackbar and The Mon Calamari.&nbsp;\n\nI feel that Jar Jar brought nothing to the story and was a unfunny racial stereotype and only there for kids appeal and because Lucas wanted to make toys.\n\nAckbar however would be crucial for The Clone Wars as an effective military leader and would be crucial in the creation of The Rebel Alliance and would be a great central character to have in the prequels.&nbsp;<br />As for Watto. I would replace Watto as Anakin&rsquo;s master and make it so Jabba The Hutt is who is the master of Anakin and Shmi.&nbsp;\n\nJabba uses Anakin to repair his droids and Pods. Shmi became in debt to the Hutts so she had to sell herself and Anakin so they could simply live. Jabba uses Bib Fortuna to crack the whip on Anakin. When Anakin enters and wins the race, Jabba is enraged and sends his thugs to kill the Skywalkers, this will begin Jabba&rsquo;s hatred of the Jedi. Much like Luke was helpless as The Empire kills Owen and Beru, Anakin watched helplessly as Jabba&rsquo;s thugs kills Shmi and as they attempt to kill him, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon saves Anakin&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;</li><li>Make Anakin flying in the Alderaanian starship to destroy the Droid Controller matter. Have it be that Anakin wants to help Padme and her people, they would be skeptical that a child could help stop the invasion, but Padme has seen first hand how skilled Anakin is, so she agrees. So instead of Anakin not knowing how to close the ship door and destroy the controller on accident, Captain Panaka would teach Anakin how to pilot the ship and so Anakin destroys the droid controller knowing that it would stop the droids. So like Luke, Anakin helped saved the day.&nbsp;</li><li>Padme is Queen, not a senator. To go with the change that Naboo should have been Alderaan and Padme Amidala should have been Padme Organa Queen Of Alderaan and head of house Organa.\n\n\nNo &ldquo;I was elected queen&rdquo; she was next in line and rules until she dies, because that&rsquo;s how Monarchy works.<br />Bail is her brother and prince, Breha is one of &nbsp;her handmaidens and instead of doubles, she is a Queen who takes charge much like Leia was as a princess. <br />We see more scenes like the deleted scenes in ROTS and in The Clone Wars cartoon of Padme, Mon Motha, Bail Organa and the other senators. They all see how corrupt the Republic has become and view how liberty is truly lost and must fight the influence Palpatine has gotten and try to prevent the rise of the empire, but because of the clone wars, it is too late.</li><li>Use Midichlorians the same way The Clone Wars and the Darth Plagueis novel uses them.</li><li>\n\nThe Jedi Code is spoken and taught to Anakin by Obi-Wan and he learns of the Sith code by Palpatine. So that way we can learn what teachings and beliefs The Jedi and Sith believe in.<br />Jedi Code.<br /><i>There is no emotion, there is peace.</i><i>There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.</i><i>There is no passion, there is serenity.</i><i>There is no chaos, there is harmony.</i><i>There is no death, there is the Force.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;</li><li>Palpatine would teach the Sith Code to Anakin and Maul.<br />\n\nSith Code<br />&ldquo; <i>Peace is a lie, there is only passion.<br /></i><i>Through passion, I gain strength.<br /></i><i>Through strength, I gain power.<br /></i><i>Through power, I gain victory.<br /></i><i>Through victory, my chains are broken.<br /></i><i>The Force shall free me.&rdquo;</i> \n\n<br /></li><li>\n\nDarth Maul is kept alive and made the main villain of the prequel trilogy. I&rsquo;d also give Maul a reason to want to destroy the Jedi.&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;At last we will reveal ourselves, at last we shall have our revenge&rdquo; Those words always made me thought. Why does Maul want revenge on the Jedi? So my own origin for Maul is that Maul was a Zabrak born on Irodonia. The Jedi thought there was a disturbance in the force on the village where Maul was, they thought it was the dark side and the Jedi&rsquo;s judgement were clouded and massacred the village with Maul&rsquo;s family. Maul survived. It&rsquo;s revealed that Palpatine clouded the Jedi&rsquo;s mind. The two Jedi involved were Dooku and Qui-Gon and that began their distrust and disillusion of the Council. And thus we have a personal reason for Maul wanting to have revenge against the Jedi and Qui-Gon in particular.<br />\n\nHe is however cut in half by Obi-Wan, but Palpatine saves him and his lower half is cybernetics like in the Clone Wars, because he put so much value and training into him and Maul is the perfect weapon.&nbsp;\n<br />&nbsp;Asajj Ventress would be Maul&rsquo;s apprentice. But Palpatine is pulling the strings. He would have made a great recurring villain and given Obi-Wan Kenobi greater depth too, giving him an arc over the whole trilogy. Narratively speaking, Maul&rsquo;s death could have fit the same role as General Grievous; an act that would end the Clone Wars and bring his story full circle.<br />Now speaking of &nbsp;Asajj Ventress as Maul&rsquo;s apprentice. <br />Maul would have found Ventress on Dathomir and he would train her to be his apprentice. &nbsp;But their relationship would be different from Dooku and Ventress and Maul and Savage, Maul and Ventress would be lovers and their combined passion is what makes them together deadly. Unlike Dooku, he would not attempt to kill her, he would instead plot with her to take over the Sith and otherthrow Sidious as Mother Talzin would instruct them to get revenge on Sidious for her. Ventress would attempt to assassinate Palpatine and of course he kills her, so in revenge Maul and Grievous &nbsp;kidnaps Sidious and in ROTS, Maul is responsible for cutting off Anakin&rsquo;s arm and killing Satine. Both Anakin and Obi-Wan have reasons for wanting Maul dead and Maul has been dying to kill Obi-Wan ever since Alderaan and he has always seen the chosen one as a threat. Together Anakin and Obi-Wan defeat Maul. Obi-Wan would restrain himself for taking revenge on Maul. But because of this, Maul force pushes Obi-Wan and with him out of the way, Anakin and Obi-Wan fight to the death. They are equally matched, but in the end, Anakin destroys Maul&rsquo;s double bladed lightsaber and chops his arms off. Maul is at Anakin&rsquo;s mercy and Palpatine demands him to kill Maul and that is the end of Maul<br /></li><li>\n\nWe could either have the Clone Wars being similar with the Clones being Clones of Jango, Mandalorians led by Jango Fett vs able bodied men who are trained and drafted from each of the republic&rsquo;s worlds. They are Stormtroopers. It is called The Clone Wars because of the Mandalorians and Stormtroopers&rsquo; armor look the same and the fight with the Mandalorians are never ending. or&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtU_eTf6wdrs%26t%3D4s&amp;t=YzA2ZjQ2Mzc3ZTJhODVlY2FlMmMxNzk2YmZiYzlhYTNiODM3ZTNjNixmaTFPNlh5bQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AH7fufnj4oDBHXG8OLtOW1A&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdalekofchaos.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F120833241057%2Fthings-i-would-change-about-the-star-wars-prequels&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Clone Wars would be completely different. </a> Basically what was originally intended. The Clones were meant to be the villains. in The Thrawn Trilogy, cast the Clone Masters as the opponents of the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars, as several authors of the &lsquo;90s considered that the cloners and their clones were the &ldquo;villains.&rdquo; fighting the Jedi and the Republic. You can have the CIS leaders and Jango Fett aiding the Clone Masters, if anything, The Clone Masters were the original Rebels.\n\n<br /></li><li>Ahsoka&rsquo;s characterization would be the same as would the Jedi.</li><li>The main leaders of the Separatists are Count Dooku, Darth Maul and General Grievous, along with the other various leaders we have seen in the Clone Wars.<br /></li><li>Count Dooku would not be the Sith Lord we knew, but he would be a Grey Jedi. He was Qui-Gon&rsquo;s master, so naturally he would have the same views of the force and distrust in the Council as Qui-Gon did. He would still be one of the leaders of the separatists but unlike in canon, Dooku&rsquo;s reasons for defecting to the CIS is exactly what he told Obi-Wan in Attack Of The Clones. The Sith control the senate and the Republic. The Republic has become a pawn of the Sith and the Jedi have become to arrogant and complacent and wanting to free the galaxy from a corrupt Republic and from the Sith. But before it&rsquo;s too late Dooku realizes he was an unwilling pawn of Darth SIdious in creating The Clone Wars and when he has outlived his usefulness, Sidious sends Darth Maul to silence Dooku.<br /></li><li>General Grievous &nbsp;is like he was in the 2003 Clone Wars Cartoon and his EU comics who was a badass general capable of strategic thinking and the badass cyborg who was capable of killing entire teams of Jedi Knights and capable of fighting Jedi Masters with ease. He is nothing like he was in The Clone Wars show and Revenge Of The Sith which portrays him as an incapable and incompetent general who was taken down by Gungans.. He is brutal, efficient, calculating, trained by both Count Dooku and Darth Maul showing why he is deadly with the lightsaber. Instead of showing him beaten time and time again by people who he would have killed in his old lore and the 2003 Clone Wars cartoon and running away like a pathetic coward, we actually see Grievous get to kill the Jedi, even showing the best Knights and even some masters die by his hands. There&rsquo;s a reason he was a warlord of his people and supreme commander of the CIS and put fear in the Jedi.<br />His backstory would be like what he had in the EU<br /></li><li>Jango Fett lives longer and is Mandalore and leads The Mandalorians against The Republic and Separatists. Instead of being asked to be a donor for the Clone army, Jango at first joins the Separatists, however he views them as weak and would not allow the Mandalorians to become pawns of the Sith once again. Boba would be a teenager and not a kid so we can see that Boba Fett is a Mandalorian warrior and just as great as Jango and we are seen how badass Boba Fett really is since we were cheated out of him as a great villain in ROTJ.<br />Before I talk more I must tell fans what Mandalore and who The Mandalorians are. <br />The title of Mandalore was the Galactic Basic Standard transliteration of the Mando'a word Mand'alor, which meant &ldquo;sole ruler&rdquo; in the Mandalorian language. The position of Mand'alor was a combination of king, warlord, and general in function, often carrying with it the additional title of Al'Ori'Ramikade, &ldquo;Commander of Supercommandos.&rdquo; A non-hereditary role, only a Mandalorian deemed worthy could claim the title of Mand'alor, exemplifying the Mandalorian meritocracy ideal. When the previous Mandalore fell or stepped down, a Mandalorian with both vision and strength could make a claim for the title, but if the other clans did not accept the individual as the new Mand'alor and recognize their authority, their duty was to remove the unsuitable claimant and institute a more favorable leader. The significance of the Mand'alor&rsquo;s role in Mandalorian society was so great that one of the Resol'nare&mdash;the six basic tenets that defined Mandalorian culture&mdash;detailed the importance of loyalty toward the Mand'alor, and rallying to the Mandalorian leader when called upon. <br />The Mandalorians&mdash;known in Mando'a as the Mando'ade, or &ldquo;Children of Mandalore\"&mdash;were a nomadic group of clan-based people consisting of members from multiple species and multiple genders, all bound by a common culture.In their early years, Mandalorian culture revolved around battle, with war being a source of honor and pride in their community. <br />Now the comic Open Seasons would indeed be Jango&rsquo;s origin, however I would change it so that his tribe wasn&rsquo;t wiped out by the Jedi, instead what happens is a fight to the death between Jango Fett and Tor Vizla would determine who controls the Mandalorian clans. Jango Fett of course wins and becomes Mandalore. Jango is not killed by Mace, however Jango is able to wound and scar Mace with his flamethrower, the Jedi&rsquo;s arrogance cloud&rsquo;s his judgement and is beaten by Jango but does not die. Jango betraying Darth Maul and The Separatists is not taken lightly. Darth Maul fights Jango Fett for everyone to see and Darth Maul kills him. Boba enraged, continues his father&rsquo;s war and takes up the mantle of Mandalore. However Boba Fett does not see a difference between Jedi and Sith, he sees them one in the same and blame&rsquo;s his father&rsquo;s death on the Jedi for allowing the Sith to exist and for former Jedi to fall to the dark side. Where Obi-Wan&rsquo;s villain would be Darth Maul, Anakin&rsquo;s would be Boba Fett. In The Clone Wars, Boba Fett would be just annihilating The Republic until Anakin and the 501st fights back and Boba meets his match, Boba Fett a worthy antagonist and Anakin&rsquo;s campaign with The Mandalorians would test him and it ends with Anakin destroying the Mandalorians and leaving Boba Fett a broken man who is forced to become a Bounty Hunter with the Mandalorians all but destroyed, showing us the Bounty Hunter he became working for Jabba The Hutt. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></li><li>Palpatine is not the two dimensional laughable villain we got in the prequels, he is written to be a more complex villain. &nbsp;Basically I believe Palpatine should have been like Alexander Pierce from CATWS. Pierce is cold. He is calculating. He knows how to manipulate people into doing what he wants. He&rsquo;s not afraid to use pawns and sacrifice them accordingly. He&rsquo;s an abuser and unapologetic and willing to take out millions of people for his vision, however fucked up that vision is, of the greater good. This is the Palpatine I wanted, however in this case it would be on a galactic scale. Tired of corruption and unrest in the senate, he is greeted by Darth Plaugeis and offers to give what Palpatine has always wanted, peace and offers to train him in the dark side of the force. Palpatine would learn everything Plagueis knew, even his ability to create life and then killing him. Palpatine&rsquo;s motivation would be wanting to force peace, stability and order in the Republic, however to ensure this he had to create The Clones and The Clone Wars. He needed Dooku to create unrest and to create the CIS and he needed the jedi out of the way. Then he would have completely justified his every action. Every action that destroys democracy, every action that causes civil unrest and it&rsquo;s all in the name of &ldquo;peace&rdquo; The Prequels would explore his decent into madness and meglomania. Palpatine slowly becomes more power-hungry and how he keeps justifying himself with all the horrible things he does until he&rsquo;s the cackling &ldquo;And now, young Skywalker&hellip;you will die&hellip;&rdquo; man we see in Return of the Jedi.<br /></li><li>\n\nIt would be revealed that Palpatine learned all there is to know from Darth Plagueis so he used his power to create life, to create Anakin manipulating the events throughout his life and used him to be his ultimate tool to destroy the Jedi\n\n<br /></li><li>Yoda and Obi-Wan go into exile &nbsp;not only because they are in hiding from Vader and The Empire, but because they realized The Jedi failed the galaxy, they created Darth Vader and the Empire, they feel guilt and when he is fighting Anakin and after he defeats his former friend, he tells him how much not only he but the Jedi have failed Anakin and the galaxy.<br /></li><li>Padme&rsquo;s character is not fridged just so Anakin can become Darth Vader. I love and adore Padme but her character drastically changed in ROTS. She was this strong willed character who would fight for what&rsquo;s right, fight to keep democracy alive, she does love Anakin, but the Padme we all know in TPM, AOTC and TCW would not sit by and act like Anakin is not capable of the things he&rsquo;s done. <br />Throughout ROTS, I would have it that Padme is starting the Rebellion.<br />\n\nPadme didn&rsquo;t just meet with fellow concerned Senators; she realized that the Republic she knew, loved and fought for is dead. Padme meets with her brother Bail, Mon Mothma, Ackbar and the other leaders of The Rebellion. It is Padme&rsquo;s idea to start the Rebellion. She&rsquo;s not just meeting with concerned senators. Padme is also meeting with the Separatists.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Padme has been at war with The Separatists since she was a teenager, since The Trade Federation invaded her home Alderaan, and yet, despite all this, Padme realize that The Sith have orchestrated this war and realizes Count Dooku died because he knew too much, Padme realizes that The Republic became evil, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoWWMyFlFsU\" target=\"_blank\">The Separatists were the good guys</a>. She realizes Palpatine is the mastermind and he is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and that her husband is falling to the dark side.&nbsp;\n\nPadme is willing to meet with the Separatists in order to work out how to oppose them.&nbsp;<br />When Padme realizes Anakin fell to the dark side, she realizes&nbsp;the boy she knew and loved died and goes to Mustafar to try to stop him herself, she is force choked but she still lives. After the fight, Padme gives birth. Padme lives, she takes care of Leia while Luke is looked after Owen and Beru on Tatooine. Padme is not only the mother of Luke and Leia, Padme is the mother of the Rebellion. Padme&nbsp;\n\n fakes her death, and goes on to lead the Rebellion to fight Palpatine and Vader. Known across the Empire as a mysterious and unknown but powerful political figure, she is among the Empire&rsquo;s Most Wanted. Padme made the hard decision to raise Leia while giving her son away to keep him safe. She takes charge of the mission to destroy the superweapon built by the Empire that threatens the entire galaxy. With a victory on the horizon, she takes an opportunity to reunite her family.</li><li>Anakin is a tragic character.&nbsp; There is an actual sense of friendship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, you feel a connection and not whining and loathing, you feel that Obi-Wan is glad and proud to have Anakin as his apprentice and his friend, not complaining. There is chemistry and love between Anakin and Padme, not just because we are told they are supposed to be in love. They are genuinely in love&nbsp; something that is built in the relationship along with chemistry is the relationship is not based on the superficial or lust. Padme is someone who fight&rsquo;s for freedom, democracy and justice. Anakin was a slave his whole life(more on that later) so I think it would be best to not just show better on screen chemistry and better writing, but both of them would have fought for each other and have their love built on freedom. It would fit for what Anidala was meant to be, both of them heroes but of course everything would fall apart once Anakin falls to the Dark Side.<br />Now to the tragedy. Anakin&rsquo;s fall would actually be tragic. Anakin would have the hero&rsquo;s journey but it would be like a Greek tragedy. Anakin believes the Jedi are corrupt and evil. Before I go on that, I will state what the Prophecy to bring balance to the force SHOULD HAVE BEEN. <br />I believe the &ldquo;Bring balance to the force&rdquo; prophecy meant to balance and means to understand &nbsp;BOTH Light and Dark sides of the force and the Jedi changed the prophecy to fit their views so the Sith can be destroyed since religions can twist things to their own benefits. <br />The reason would be that the Jedi have become too complacent and arrogant. Believing themselves too powerful and allow their judgement to cloud their judgement and abandon the Jedi Code and Anakin realizes they are not like the Jedi of Old. He would feel that this is the only way to save the Republic. He didn&rsquo;t do this because of a dream(a dream in which Palpatine most likely put in his head), he did this for the future of the Republic, Padme and future of his family. I would also like to add that Anakin&rsquo;s slavery should be touched upon more, it should be his backstory, overcoming slavery as a young adult that he was shackled to for most of his life, proving himself as a brilliant pilot, proving himself to be a powerful and gifted Jedi strong in the force, but come to terms that he has always been a slave. Slave to the hutts, slave to his Jedi masters and he has always been Palpatine&rsquo;s slave(more on that later) and he goes from being a slave to being someone whose life is supposed to exist in self-denial/restraint. &nbsp;the power he attains through that role is not even his own to use as he chooses, and he&rsquo;s constantly being told his judgement is bad (which it is, but that serves to reinforce the whole lack-of-freedom thing). &nbsp;of course he&rsquo;s going to want freedom, and is going to associate that with power, and as he gains more power, he&rsquo;s going want to use that to gain more freedom. &nbsp;he&rsquo;s never had any freedom in his life. When he becomes Darth Vader Anakin was willing to destroy himself for power and control, so he was really building up his own tomb. Making that more powerful when he asks Luke to take his mask off. He recognizes what he&rsquo;s always been, he was a slave all his life last to the dark side. But in choosing to take the mask off, to embrace the good in him is his casting off his shackles and in death, for the first time he is finally free. And if you view all 6 movies they are the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker.<br /></li></ul><p>James McAvoy as Obi-Wan Kenobi</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img
