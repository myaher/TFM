It was romantic and a surprise for Laura after prom. Peter wanted it to be special so he told her that the room was booked but not what it looked like. He could wait to see Laura in her dress. He also imagined what she&rsquo;d look like in a wedding dress to but that was after he imagined prom night. </p><p>Tonight will be perfect. May made Peter leave with Tony to the hotel room to get ready while Laura got ready at the apartment. &ldquo;May! I&rsquo;ve never been to prom! I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo; Laura freaked out.</p><p> May calmed her down and chuckled remembering that she too was like this on prom night. &ldquo;Sweetie everything will be alright. I&rsquo;ve got you covered. The only thing I can&rsquo;t help you with is your makeup.&rdquo; Laura let out a loud sigh of relief. </p><p>May chuckled and lead her to the bedroom. May turned around as Laura got on the right garments until she needed help clipping her bra. She put pajamas back on to do her makeup. This is the most makeup she&rsquo;s ever worn and she hopes to the high heavens the she doesn&rsquo;t butcher it. </p><p>As she put the finishing touches on May started on her hair. Her hair has never been curled except when she has them in braids. Seeing the spirals for the very first time was like a puppy seeing snow for the first time. She was unsure if she should touch it. </p><p>The end results were amazing. She didn&rsquo;t look like herself but she looked like the person she would&rsquo;ve been if life didn&rsquo;t have its issues. They headed back to the room to get her dress on. May helped Laura into her dress and zipped it. </p><p>She put her heels on before turning around. Laura took a deep breath and then turned. Just May&rsquo;s reaction of seeing her &ldquo;baby girl all grown up&rdquo; put her nerves at ease a bit. May started tearing up. Laura&rsquo;s only instinct is to hug her or she too will start crying. </p><p>May wiping the tears away gestures to head to the door. Laura grabbed her hand held wallet thing and headed out. On the way to meet up with Tony and Peter she checked and the things she needed in her thing. </p><p>Oil pads, lipstick, mints, condoms&hellip; Laura chuckled at how protective May was about the whole thing. They made it to the location where they were going to take pictures. Peter and Tony were standing there looking around and talking. Laura&rsquo;s breath hitched and jaw dropped. Goddamn did Peter look amazing.</p><p>Her heart started beating faster and her palms started to sweat. The two got out of the car. Once both doors were closed Peter&rsquo;s attention was all on Laura. Just like Laura, his breath hitched, jaw dropped and heart pounded. </p><p>It was like everyone else in the world disappeared and it was just her. His girl. His future. Laura smiled knowing that not a minute ago she was doing that too. &ldquo;Laura, you look&hellip;&rdquo; Peter couldn&rsquo;t even finish. &ldquo;You too&hellip; Spider-Man.&rdquo; She whispered the last part.</p><p>Laura leaned up for a kiss. &ldquo;Woah! Won&rsquo;t ruin your makeup?&rdquo; Peter asked. &ldquo;Water proof am smudge proof. You&rsquo;re good.&rdquo; Without hesitating he kissed her. &ldquo;Alright you two love birds. Let&rsquo;s get to pictures before you&rsquo;re to the prom.&rdquo; Tiny clapped his hands.</p><p> As pictures were being taken May started crying again which lead to both kids consoling her before continuing. They did a few poses and then said they&rsquo;re good byes. &ldquo;Happy isn&rsquo;t your driver today but he will be in the morning. Peter don&rsquo;t ask too many questions.&rdquo; Tony joked.</p><p>Laura snickered knowing it&rsquo;s true. They get in the super high tech Audi Tony owned. The driver introduced himself and told them drinks were back there with them. &ldquo;Drinks?&rdquo; Laura questioned. Peter shrugged. Knowing how Tony works, he&rsquo;s full of surprises so who knows. Laura opened the cooler and pulled out two champagne glasses and a note that read:</p><p>Dear kiddos, have a great time at prom but not too much because May and I don&rsquo;t want to be looking after a kid. ~TS</p><p>Laura laughed and showed Peter the note and he just shook his head. Typical Tony, always finding ways to throw in a dirty joke. They opened the strawberry flavored champagne and poured it. </p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to tonight.&rdquo; Laura said raising her glass. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s to the future&rdquo; Peter added before they tapped glasses and took a sip. After drinking it and setting it down Laura snuggled the best she could into Peter&rsquo;s side. When they got there their driver side he&rsquo;ll bring the champagne up to their room. </p><p>Peter held out his elbow for her to take. &ldquo;Ma lady.&rdquo; He wiggled his eyebrows. &ldquo;Ma man.&rdquo; She gave a devilish smile back. Like the gentleman he is he opened the door for her. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to a night I&rsquo;ll never forget.&rdquo; Laura whispered to herself.</p>",

Tony pulled through and got the hotel room that was basically a mini apartment. It was romantic and a surprise for Laura after prom. Peter wanted it to be special so he told her that the room was booked but not what it looked like. He could wait to see Laura in her dress. He also imagined what she\u2019d look like in a wedding dress to but that was after he imagined prom night. </p><p>Tonight will be perfect. May made Peter leave with Tony to the hotel room to get ready while Laura got ready at the apartment. \u201cMay! I\u2019ve never been to prom! I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d Laura freaked out.</p><p> May calmed her down and chuckled remembering that she too was like this on prom night. \u201cSweetie everything will be alright. I\u2019ve got you covered. The only thing I can\u2019t help you with is your makeup.\u201d Laura let out a loud sigh of relief. </p><p>May chuckled and lead her to the bedroom. May turned around as Laura got on the right garments until she needed help clipping her bra. She put pajamas back on to do her makeup. This is the most makeup she\u2019s ever worn and she hopes to the high heavens the she doesn\u2019t butcher it. </p><p>As she put the finishing touches on May started on her hair. Her hair has never been curled except when she has them in braids. Seeing the spirals for the very first time was like a puppy seeing snow for the first time. She was unsure if she should touch it. </p><p>The end results were amazing. She didn\u2019t look like herself but she looked like the person she would\u2019ve been if life didn\u2019t have its issues. They headed back to the room to get her dress on. May helped Laura into her dress and zipped it. </p><p>She put her heels on before turning around. Laura took a deep breath and then turned. Just May\u2019s reaction of seeing her \u201cbaby girl all grown up\u201d put her nerves at ease a bit. May started tearing up. Laura\u2019s only instinct is to hug her or she too will start crying. </p><p>May wiping the tears away gestures to head to the door. Laura grabbed her hand held wallet thing and headed out. On the way to meet up with Tony and Peter she checked and the things she needed in her thing. </p><p>Oil pads, lipstick, mints, condoms\u2026 Laura chuckled at how protective May was about the whole thing. They made it to the location where they were going to take pictures. Peter and Tony were standing there looking around and talking. Laura\u2019s breath hitched and jaw dropped. Goddamn did Peter look amazing.</p><p>Her heart started beating faster and her palms started to sweat. The two got out of the car. Once both doors were closed Peter\u2019s attention was all on Laura. Just like Laura, his breath hitched, jaw dropped and heart pounded. </p><p>It was like everyone else in the world disappeared and it was just her. His girl. His future. Laura smiled knowing that not a minute ago she was doing that too. \u201cLaura, you look\u2026\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t even finish. \u201cYou too\u2026 Spider-Man.\u201d She whispered the last part.</p><p>Laura leaned up for a kiss. \u201cWoah! Won\u2019t ruin your makeup?\u201d Peter asked. \u201cWater proof am smudge proof. You\u2019re good.\u201d Without hesitating he kissed her. \u201cAlright you two love birds. Let\u2019s get to pictures before you\u2019re to the prom.\u201d Tiny clapped his hands.</p><p> As pictures were being taken May started crying again which lead to both kids consoling her before continuing. They did a few poses and then said they\u2019re good byes. \u201cHappy isn\u2019t your driver today but he will be in the morning. Peter don\u2019t ask too many questions.\u201d Tony joked.</p><p>Laura snickered knowing it\u2019s true. They get in the super high tech Audi Tony owned. The driver introduced himself and told them drinks were back there with them. \u201cDrinks?\u201d Laura questioned. Peter shrugged. Knowing how Tony works, he\u2019s full of surprises so who knows. Laura opened the cooler and pulled out two champagne glasses and a note that read:</p><p>Dear kiddos, have a great time at prom but not too much because May and I don\u2019t want to be looking after a kid. ~TS</p><p>Laura laughed and showed Peter the note and he just shook his head. Typical Tony, always finding ways to throw in a dirty joke. They opened the strawberry flavored champagne and poured it. </p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to tonight.\u201d Laura said raising her glass. \u201cAnd here\u2019s to the future\u201d Peter added before they tapped glasses and took a sip. After drinking it and setting it down Laura snuggled the best she could into Peter\u2019s side. When they got there their driver side he\u2019ll bring the champagne up to their room. </p><p>Peter held out his elbow for her to take. \u201cMa lady.\u201d He wiggled his eyebrows. \u201cMa man.\u201d She gave a devilish smile back. Like the gentleman he is he opened the door for her. \u201cHere\u2019s to a night I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Laura whispered to herself.</p>",

Get out!<br><br>\nI love photography and philosophy, so you will find some cool pics and random quotes.<br><br>\nI love powerful scenes, with strong women and a nice script.<br><br>\nI'm not a huge fan of movie theaters. My anxiety hates a room full of strangers and loud sounds...Ironically, because\nI have been working in the music industry for at least 15 years.<br><br>\nI'm such an easy-going person, if you call me 'ignorant' or wtvr; name calling does not make me read your argument...Try to educate me, I'm open for it.<br><br>\nThat's not all, but that's it for now.",
