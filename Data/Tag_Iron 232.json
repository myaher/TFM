        "body": "<h1>Peter Parker is an exhausted boy, and Iron Dad can always relate</h1><p><b>i think a lotta people forget peter is a teenager sometimes tbh. appreciate this one shot i made</b></p><p><b>Words: 1927</b></p><p>\u201cMr. Parker, where is your assignment?\u201d Miss Warren asked, startling the sleepy boy out of his exhausted state. He raised a brow, mind sluggish, running at a pace of a turtle before he could reply.</p><p>\u201cHere, Miss. Lemme&hellip; lemme just get it out for you,\u201d he croaked while reaching into his backpack. Peter had being staying up all night- all nights, the whole week- leaving him weary and stressed. Well, he was stressed anyway, and was actually a factor of why he had sleeping issues, but the problems kept building up.</p><p>First there was school. That was in the homework aspect, Flash picking on him and the fact he had a creeping suspicion Michelle knew who he was. The whole idea of someone so close to him, not including Ned, knowing who he was? That kept him up at night. The last thing he wanted was to put them in harm\u2019s way. </p><p>Then there was the pressure of being Spider-Man, the crippling weight on his shoulders that made him wilt, slowly becoming deader as the seemingly endless nights dragged out. Everyone expected the hero to save them now. He wasn\u2019t big like Iron Man, but New Yorkers who knew Spider-Man was. He could see some t-shirts being worn every so often with his small, iconic symbol on them, and while that was heart-warming and absolutely hilarious to see, it also meant people relied on him. That was okay. He had taken that responsibility when Uncle Ben had mentioned that other\u2019s would rely on him, \u00a0but God, thousands- no, millions of people of the city relied on him to come save them, from muggings, from assaulters, to robbers, to simple drunk people stumbling around, yelling curses like they were Deadpool or just some deranged mercenary.</p><p>Peter accepted the responsibility.</p><p><i>\u201cAre you an Avenger, Spider-Man?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSpider-Man, you\u2019re the best!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSpider-man could never fail us!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSpider-Man, <b>help me!\u201d</b></i></p><p>People expected him to be the next Iron Man, the next Thor, even the next Hulk, hell, even the next Scarlett Witch. The stress was overwhelming. Not just the people expected it; Tony-freaking-Stark expected it. And the last thing he wanted to do was disappoint him- <i>never again.</i></p><p>With Bugle-named \u2018Green Goblin\u2019 began creeping around; Peter\u2019s life became insanely hard. He had bruises all over his body, and bones that were either cracked or bruised as well. Whatever it was, whatever he was doing, that mentally unstable guy would ruin his night, strangling him, blowing him up, shouting puns that weren\u2019t even funny because he was so scary (some could argue though that puns are the scariest form of humour.)</p><p>Of course, the most pressuring of all, Harry Osborn. Aside from Ned, he was his best friend. No, Ned came second in the friend race, actually&hellip; Something was off with him.  He was turning up late; his hair tussled; sunglasses resting on his perfectly angled nose, all the while he sported a fake grin. Peter knew that grin anywhere. It was the kind that took years to perfect, the ones celebrities used in front of paparazzi to get them to leave. His father, Norman Osborn, also did this. Even Tony Stark, too.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t fool Peter. He knew what his real smile was like, dazzling and pretty.</p><p>He wanted to ask what was wrong, but it never seemed like the right time to ask, because every time he did those eyes of his would turn so sad, so full of pain and agony his heart clenched and yearned to support him. He couldn\u2019t force him to share, so all he could offer was a shoulder to cry on. And Harry had never cried in front of him through their years of being friends.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker?\u201d</p><p>While Peter had been drowning in somewhat self-pity and sadness, he had forgotten to hand in his over-due paper. He did, avoiding her eyes, and Miss Warren looked at him expectedly.</p><p>\u201cHave you been sleeping lately? You look tired.\u201d She motioned to the dark bags under his eyes. Peter blushed.</p><p>\u201cYep, been sleeping&hellip; Um&hellip; Can I go now, Miss? I need to get home.\u201d For a moment, the teacher hesitated, before sighing and moving out the way. He bucked out the room. Out there was Osborn himself, sunglasses perched on his nose and he licked his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cPete, come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d He smiled, only to receive a small shake of Peter\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cNot today, sorry, Har. I&hellip; um&hellip; I really have to go to the Stark Internship.\u201d A frown tugged at Harry\u2019s face, bitter and harsh, and it rolled so quickly into sympathy and genuine sadness that Peter thought his mind had deceived him.</p><p>\u201cOh. I get it,\u201d his voice was soft, \u201cyeah. You need to go. Go.\u201d Harry said and put his hands in his designer jacket. Peter rubbed the back of his neck and pulled the taller boy in for a quick hug, smiled, then pulled back. \u201cThanks, Har. But I\u2019ve got to go. Bye!\u201d He grinned. Harry mirrored his expression, \u201cgo get \u2018em, tiger.\u201d He said teasingly, knowing what was happening between MJ and Peter.</p><p>The boy flushed a dark red all over again, and he was reminded harshly that MJ liked him. Like a hammer on an iron, pain hurt his heart. He wasn\u2019t good enough for her. He always let her down. \u201cShut up, Osborn.\u201d He snapped playfully and attempted to ruffle his hair, but Harry pulled back. His hair was \u201cstyled,\u201d Harry reminded, winking at him. \u201cMy hair is styled, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Perfect. I have to go, bye!\u201d He grinned and began to run down the now empty hallways.</p><p>Harry sighed under his breath and pulled the sunglasses off, rubbing the bridge of his nose. <i>Good</i>, he thought, <i>he hasn\u2019t noticed.</i></p><p>After a hurried train journey where he was itching to be the web-slinger again, he burst through Avenger\u2019s HQ (or \u2018America\u2019s dreamboat meet up place\u2019 he had once called it as a joke.) Tony was in his office as usual and the excited boy ran up the stairs since he hated his strength to be wasted with a slow elevator ride, and halted outside the door. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a mess,\u201d he murmured to himself and sorted his shirt out. He suddenly found himself out of breath, and at the first moment he wondered if he was having a panic attack. But then he realised he was out of breath from running up the stairs. Huh. Weird. That doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Despite this, he raised his fist to knock at the door but Pepper gladly opened it. FRIDAY had most likely announced his arrival. </p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she smiled warmly, and a small spark of happiness brought a smirk to his face. He strolled in, the faint smell of alcohol in the air (thanks heightened senses) and nothing had changed since he last came there, which was yesterday.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his office,\u201d she supplied and went back to the paperwork she was assigned. Peter nodded.</p><p>He slowly opened the door and noticed Tony working on some new suit, eyes focused and sweat trickling down his forehead. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d he said, trying to make his voice enthusiastic and not drag and slur with the need to sleep.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, kid- whoa, what happened to you?\u201d He asked, half joking and half concerned. Peter let ou a breathless laugh at sat beside him. \u201cJust stress. School and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded seriously, \u201cyeah, school and stuff.\u201d It took his slow mind to realise he was actually teasing him, and he was tempted to lightly punch him in the shoulder for fun, but they weren\u2019t there yet.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cPsh, nothing \u00a0 I can bore you with.\u201d He said and stared at the thing he was tinkering with, slowly realising it was a boot for the upcoming Iron Man suit.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m bored enough. You think i do this for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo having a teen ranting about his issues is your fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever know.\u201d</p><p>It was an hour of bouncing back ideas from one and other when Peter covered a yawn with the back of his hand, muffling the sound.</p><p>\u201cYou tired?\u201d Stark asked, lifting up his eye protection to see the boy.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Peter had slumped against his chair and cradled his head in his hands. He then lifted his eyes up and tried to grab his tea Mrs Potts (or Stark, now) had given him, but dizziness caused him to completely miss. </p><p>No&hellip; Not in front of Mr. Stark. What would he think if he couldn\u2019t even pick up a mug for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>Tony frowned and sat on his own chair, using the desk to push off and roll all the way over to him. \u201cMan, I wish actually made eye contact. Those eye bags are bigger than my ego, kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter wanted to roll his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he grumbled. </p><p>\u201cWhoa, you getting moody with me? Tellin\u2019 you, there\u2019s no reason to get bitchy with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, sorry, I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Stark. Really, I am&hellip;\u201d He sighed, feeling dreadful of how he wa such a teenager towards Stark. Tony shrugged, \u201cwanna talk about what\u2019s keeping you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh&hellip; Spider-Man stuff?\u201d He offered, but his heart wasn\u2019t in his words.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be the only thing keeping you up, Pete, can it?\u201d He asked, and Peter\u2019s heart throbbed. He wanted to tell him, tell him what was going on inside his busy mind of his, how he felt, how much he was aching and how much he just wanted to sob.</p><p>So, Peter started out with the simplest thing of homework and ended up sobbing huge tears that rolled down his face like rivers, talking about Green Goblin, Harry, the fact everyone was expecting him to do so good, but the pressure was getting to him. Really, really badly. His face was flushed and nose was running, and his hair had puffed up since he was stressfully tugging at his curls left and right. His chest constricted, and he found it hard to breathe, so he choked on air, making small, retching sounds between broken sentences. </p><p>He closed his mouth after a good half-an-hour, feeling so, so embarrassed that Mr. Stark had seen him whimper and sob like a traumatised child, and he pulled his legs up to his chest. His breaths were wet and thick. \u201cSorry, Mr. Stark&hellip; You have your own problems to worry about, didn\u2019t mean to burden you with-\u201c</p><p>And before he could finish his sentence, Tony\u2019s arms had wrapped around him and he gently stroked up his back.

Tony smiled, and jumped when Pepper whispered, \u201cyou said you wanted a kid, right? You seem like perfect dad.\u201d She smiled, and he lightly pushed her away.

He raised a brow, mind sluggish, running at a pace of a turtle before he could reply.</p><p>\u201cHere, Miss. Lemme\u2026 lemme just get it out for you,\u201d he croaked while reaching into his backpack. Peter had being staying up all night- all nights, the whole week- leaving him weary and stressed. Well, he was stressed anyway, and was actually a factor of why he had sleeping issues, but the problems kept building up.</p><p>First there was school. That was in the homework aspect, Flash picking on him and the fact he had a creeping suspicion Michelle knew who he was. The whole idea of someone so close to him, not including Ned, knowing who he was? That kept him up at night. The last thing he wanted was to put them in harm\u2019s way. </p><p>Then there was the pressure of being Spider-Man, the crippling weight on his shoulders that made him wilt, slowly becoming deader as the seemingly endless nights dragged out. Everyone expected the hero to save them now. He wasn\u2019t big like Iron Man, but New Yorkers who knew Spider-Man was. He could see some t-shirts being worn every so often with his small, iconic symbol on them, and while that was heart-warming and absolutely hilarious to see, it also meant people relied on him. That was okay. He had taken that responsibility when Uncle Ben had mentioned that other\u2019s would rely on him, \u00a0but God, thousands- no, millions of people of the city relied on him to come save them, from muggings, from assaulters, to robbers, to simple drunk people stumbling around, yelling curses like they were Deadpool or just some deranged mercenary.</p><p>Peter accepted the responsibility.</p><p><i>\u201cAre you an Avenger, Spider-Man?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSpider-Man, you\u2019re the best!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSpider-man could never fail us!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSpider-Man, <b>help me!\u201d</b></i></p><p>People expected him to be the next Iron Man, the next Thor, even the next Hulk, hell, even the next Scarlett Witch. The stress was overwhelming. Not just the people expected it; Tony-freaking-Stark expected it. And the last thing he wanted to do was disappoint him- <i>never again.</i></p><p>With Bugle-named \u2018Green Goblin\u2019 began creeping around; Peter\u2019s life became insanely hard. He had bruises all over his body, and bones that were either cracked or bruised as well. Whatever it was, whatever he was doing, that mentally unstable guy would ruin his night, strangling him, blowing him up, shouting puns that weren\u2019t even funny because he was so scary (some could argue though that puns are the scariest form of humour.)</p><p>Of course, the most pressuring of all, Harry Osborn. Aside from Ned, he was his best friend. No, Ned came second in the friend race, actually\u2026 Something was off with him.  He was turning up late; his hair tussled; sunglasses resting on his perfectly angled nose, all the while he sported a fake grin. Peter knew that grin anywhere. It was the kind that took years to perfect, the ones celebrities used in front of paparazzi to get them to leave. His father, Norman Osborn, also did this. Even Tony Stark, too.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t fool Peter. He knew what his real smile was like, dazzling and pretty.</p><p>He wanted to ask what was wrong, but it never seemed like the right time to ask, because every time he did those eyes of his would turn so sad, so full of pain and agony his heart clenched and yearned to support him. He couldn\u2019t force him to share, so all he could offer was a shoulder to cry on. And Harry had never cried in front of him through their years of being friends.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker?\u201d</p><p>While Peter had been drowning in somewhat self-pity and sadness, he had forgotten to hand in his over-due paper. He did, avoiding her eyes, and Miss Warren looked at him expectedly.</p><p>\u201cHave you been sleeping lately? You look tired.\u201d She motioned to the dark bags under his eyes. Peter blushed.</p><p>\u201cYep, been sleeping\u2026 Um\u2026 Can I go now, Miss? I need to get home.\u201d For a moment, the teacher hesitated, before sighing and moving out the way. He bucked out the room. Out there was Osborn himself, sunglasses perched on his nose and he licked his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cPete, come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d He smiled, only to receive a small shake of Peter\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cNot today, sorry, Har. I\u2026 um\u2026 I really have to go to the Stark Internship.\u201d A frown tugged at Harry\u2019s face, bitter and harsh, and it rolled so quickly into sympathy and genuine sadness that Peter thought his mind had deceived him.</p><p>\u201cOh. I get it,\u201d his voice was soft, \u201cyeah. You need to go. Go.\u201d Harry said and put his hands in his designer jacket. Peter rubbed the back of his neck and pulled the taller boy in for a quick hug, smiled, then pulled back. \u201cThanks, Har. But I\u2019ve got to go. Bye!\u201d He grinned. Harry mirrored his expression, \u201cgo get \u2018em, tiger.\u201d He said teasingly, knowing what was happening between MJ and Peter.</p><p>The boy flushed a dark red all over again, and he was reminded harshly that MJ liked him. Like a hammer on an iron, pain hurt his heart. He wasn\u2019t good enough for her. He always let her down. \u201cShut up, Osborn.\u201d He snapped playfully and attempted to ruffle his hair, but Harry pulled back. His hair was \u201cstyled,\u201d Harry reminded, winking at him. \u201cMy hair is styled, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Perfect. I have to go, bye!\u201d He grinned and began to run down the now empty hallways.</p><p>Harry sighed under his breath and pulled the sunglasses off, rubbing the bridge of his nose. <i>Good</i>, he thought, <i>he hasn\u2019t noticed.</i></p><p>After a hurried train journey where he was itching to be the web-slinger again, he burst through Avenger\u2019s HQ (or \u2018America\u2019s dreamboat meet up place\u2019 he had once called it as a joke.) Tony was in his office as usual and the excited boy ran up the stairs since he hated his strength to be wasted with a slow elevator ride, and halted outside the door. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a mess,\u201d he murmured to himself and sorted his shirt out. He suddenly found himself out of breath, and at the first moment he wondered if he was having a panic attack. But then he realised he was out of breath from running up the stairs. Huh. Weird. That doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Despite this, he raised his fist to knock at the door but Pepper gladly opened it. FRIDAY had most likely announced his arrival. </p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she smiled warmly, and a small spark of happiness brought a smirk to his face. He strolled in, the faint smell of alcohol in the air (thanks heightened senses) and nothing had changed since he last came there, which was yesterday.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his office,\u201d she supplied and went back to the paperwork she was assigned. Peter nodded.</p><p>He slowly opened the door and noticed Tony working on some new suit, eyes focused and sweat trickling down his forehead. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d he said, trying to make his voice enthusiastic and not drag and slur with the need to sleep.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, kid- whoa, what happened to you?\u201d He asked, half joking and half concerned. Peter let ou a breathless laugh at sat beside him. \u201cJust stress. School and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded seriously, \u201cyeah, school and stuff.\u201d It took his slow mind to realise he was actually teasing him, and he was tempted to lightly punch him in the shoulder for fun, but they weren\u2019t there yet.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cPsh, nothing \u00a0 I can bore you with.\u201d He said and stared at the thing he was tinkering with, slowly realising it was a boot for the upcoming Iron Man suit.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m bored enough. You think i do this for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo having a teen ranting about his issues is your fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever know.\u201d</p><p>It was an hour of bouncing back ideas from one and other when Peter covered a yawn with the back of his hand, muffling the sound.</p><p>\u201cYou tired?\u201d Stark asked, lifting up his eye protection to see the boy.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Peter had slumped against his chair and cradled his head in his hands. He then lifted his eyes up and tried to grab his tea Mrs Potts (or Stark, now) had given him, but dizziness caused him to completely miss. </p><p>No\u2026 Not in front of Mr. Stark. What would he think if he couldn\u2019t even pick up a mug for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>Tony frowned and sat on his own chair, using the desk to push off and roll all the way over to him. \u201cMan, I wish actually made eye contact. Those eye bags are bigger than my ego, kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter wanted to roll his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he grumbled. </p><p>\u201cWhoa, you getting moody with me? Tellin\u2019 you, there\u2019s no reason to get bitchy with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, sorry, I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Stark. Really, I am\u2026\u201d He sighed, feeling dreadful of how he wa such a teenager towards Stark. Tony shrugged, \u201cwanna talk about what\u2019s keeping you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 Spider-Man stuff?\u201d He offered, but his heart wasn\u2019t in his words.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be the only thing keeping you up, Pete, can it?\u201d He asked, and Peter\u2019s heart throbbed. He wanted to tell him, tell him what was going on inside his busy mind of his, how he felt, how much he was aching and how much he just wanted to sob.</p><p>So, Peter started out with the simplest thing of homework and ended up sobbing huge tears that rolled down his face like rivers, talking about Green Goblin, Harry, the fact everyone was expecting him to do so good, but the pressure was getting to him. Really, really badly. His face was flushed and nose was running, and his hair had puffed up since he was stressfully tugging at his curls left and right. His chest constricted, and he found it hard to breathe, so he choked on air, making small, retching sounds between broken sentences. </p><p>He closed his mouth after a good half-an-hour, feeling so, so embarrassed that Mr. Stark had seen him whimper and sob like a traumatised child, and he pulled his legs up to his chest. His breaths were wet and thick. \u201cSorry, Mr. Stark\u2026 You have your own problems to worry about, didn\u2019t mean to burden you with-\u201c</p><p>And before he could finish his sentence, Tony\u2019s arms had wrapped around him and he gently stroked up his back. Not like Tony Stark at all. All the same, Peter clung onto him like a life line, sniffling as to not get any snot on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, kid. It\u2019s alright. Take a nap- go on- go take a nap on my couch,\u201d he register to his rich sofa, and Peter shook his head, and the millionaire pulled away awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I couldn\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cGo.

What would he think if he couldn\u2019t even pick up a mug for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>Tony frowned and sat on his own chair, using the desk to push off and roll all the way over to him. \u201cMan, I wish actually made eye contact. Those eye bags are bigger than my ego, kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter wanted to roll his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he grumbled. </p><p>\u201cWhoa, you getting moody with me? Tellin\u2019 you, there\u2019s no reason to get bitchy with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, sorry, I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Stark. Really, I am\u2026\u201d He sighed, feeling dreadful of how he wa such a teenager towards Stark. Tony shrugged, \u201cwanna talk about what\u2019s keeping you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 Spider-Man stuff?\u201d He offered, but his heart wasn\u2019t in his words.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be the only thing keeping you up, Pete, can it?\u201d He asked, and Peter\u2019s heart throbbed. He wanted to tell him, tell him what was going on inside his busy mind of his, how he felt, how much he was aching and how much he just wanted to sob.</p><p>So, Peter started out with the simplest thing of homework and ended up sobbing huge tears that rolled down his face like rivers, talking about Green Goblin, Harry, the fact everyone was expecting him to do so good, but the pressure was getting to him. Really, really badly. His face was flushed and nose was running, and his hair had puffed up since he was stressfully tugging at his curls left and right. His chest constricted, and he found it hard to breathe, so he choked on air, making small, retching sounds between broken sentences. </p><p>He closed his mouth after a good half-an-hour, feeling so, so embarrassed that Mr. Stark had seen him whimper and sob like a traumatised child, and he pulled his legs up to his chest. His breaths were wet and thick. \u201cSorry, Mr. Stark\u2026 You have your own problems to worry about, didn\u2019t mean to burden you with-\u201c</p><p>And before he could finish his sentence, Tony\u2019s arms had wrapped around him and he gently stroked up his back. Not like Tony Stark at all. All the same, Peter clung onto him like a life line, sniffling as to not get any snot on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, kid. It\u2019s alright. Take a nap- go on- go take a nap on my couch,\u201d he register to his rich sofa, and Peter shook his head, and the millionaire pulled away awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I couldn\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cGo. Now.\u201d He said, and Peter got up, shameful and bashful, and laid himself down, draping his limbs uncomfortably over it. He didn\u2019t want to seem rude. \u201cI\u2019ll tinker around but won\u2019t make too much noise, okay? Get some rest, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Peter shut down like a light. Tony smiled, and jumped when Pepper whispered, \u201cyou said you wanted a kid, right? You seem like perfect dad.\u201d She smiled, and he lightly pushed her away. No words were needed but for them to kiss, and everything was explained simple as that.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Peter Parker is an exhausted boy, and Iron Dad can always relate</h1><p><b>i think a lotta people forget peter is a teenager sometimes tbh. appreciate this one shot i made</b></p><p><b>Words: 1927</b></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker, where is your assignment?&rdquo; Miss Warren asked, startling the sleepy boy out of his exhausted state. He raised a brow, mind sluggish, running at a pace of a turtle before he could reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, Miss. Lemme&hellip; lemme just get it out for you,&rdquo; he croaked while reaching into his backpack. Peter had being staying up all night- all nights, the whole week- leaving him weary and stressed. Well, he was stressed anyway, and was actually a factor of why he had sleeping issues, but the problems kept building up.</p><p>First there was school. That was in the homework aspect, Flash picking on him and the fact he had a creeping suspicion Michelle knew who he was. The whole idea of someone so close to him, not including Ned, knowing who he was? That kept him up at night. The last thing he wanted was to put them in harm&rsquo;s way. </p><p>Then there was the pressure of being Spider-Man, the crippling weight on his shoulders that made him wilt, slowly becoming deader as the seemingly endless nights dragged out. Everyone expected the hero to save them now. He wasn&rsquo;t big like Iron Man, but New Yorkers who knew Spider-Man was. He could see some t-shirts being worn every so often with his small, iconic symbol on them, and while that was heart-warming and absolutely hilarious to see, it also meant people relied on him. That was okay. He had taken that responsibility when Uncle Ben had mentioned that other&rsquo;s would rely on him, &nbsp;but God, thousands- no, millions of people of the city relied on him to come save them, from muggings, from assaulters, to robbers, to simple drunk people stumbling around, yelling curses like they were Deadpool or just some deranged mercenary.</p><p>Peter accepted the responsibility.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you an Avenger, Spider-Man?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Spider-Man, you&rsquo;re the best!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Spider-man could never fail us!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Spider-Man, <b>help me!&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>People expected him to be the next Iron Man, the next Thor, even the next Hulk, hell, even the next Scarlett Witch. The stress was overwhelming. Not just the people expected it; Tony-freaking-Stark expected it. And the last thing he wanted to do was disappoint him- <i>never again.</i></p><p>With Bugle-named &lsquo;Green Goblin&rsquo; began creeping around; Peter&rsquo;s life became insanely hard. He had bruises all over his body, and bones that were either cracked or bruised as well. Whatever it was, whatever he was doing, that mentally unstable guy would ruin his night, strangling him, blowing him up, shouting puns that weren&rsquo;t even funny because he was so scary (some could argue though that puns are the scariest form of humour.)</p><p>Of course, the most pressuring of all, Harry Osborn. Aside from Ned, he was his best friend. No, Ned came second in the friend race, actually&hellip; Something was off with him.  He was turning up late; his hair tussled; sunglasses resting on his perfectly angled nose, all the while he sported a fake grin. Peter knew that grin anywhere. It was the kind that took years to perfect, the ones celebrities used in front of paparazzi to get them to leave. His father, Norman Osborn, also did this. Even Tony Stark, too.</p><p>But it didn&rsquo;t fool Peter. He knew what his real smile was like, dazzling and pretty.</p><p>He wanted to ask what was wrong, but it never seemed like the right time to ask, because every time he did those eyes of his would turn so sad, so full of pain and agony his heart clenched and yearned to support him. He couldn&rsquo;t force him to share, so all he could offer was a shoulder to cry on. And Harry had never cried in front of him through their years of being friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>While Peter had been drowning in somewhat self-pity and sadness, he had forgotten to hand in his over-due paper. He did, avoiding her eyes, and Miss Warren looked at him expectedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you been sleeping lately? You look tired.&rdquo; She motioned to the dark bags under his eyes. Peter blushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, been sleeping&hellip; Um&hellip; Can I go now, Miss? I need to get home.&rdquo; For a moment, the teacher hesitated, before sighing and moving out the way. He bucked out the room. Out there was Osborn himself, sunglasses perched on his nose and he licked his bottom lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, come on, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He smiled, only to receive a small shake of Peter&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&ldquo;Not today, sorry, Har. I&hellip; um&hellip; I really have to go to the Stark Internship.&rdquo; A frown tugged at Harry&rsquo;s face, bitter and harsh, and it rolled so quickly into sympathy and genuine sadness that Peter thought his mind had deceived him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. I get it,&rdquo; his voice was soft, &ldquo;yeah. You need to go. Go.&rdquo; Harry said and put his hands in his designer jacket. Peter rubbed the back of his neck and pulled the taller boy in for a quick hug, smiled, then pulled back. &ldquo;Thanks, Har. But I&rsquo;ve got to go. Bye!&rdquo; He grinned. Harry mirrored his expression, &ldquo;go get &lsquo;em, tiger.&rdquo; He said teasingly, knowing what was happening between MJ and Peter.</p><p>The boy flushed a dark red all over again, and he was reminded harshly that MJ liked him. Like a hammer on an iron, pain hurt his heart. He wasn&rsquo;t good enough for her. He always let her down. &ldquo;Shut up, Osborn.&rdquo; He snapped playfully and attempted to ruffle his hair, but Harry pulled back. His hair was &ldquo;styled,&rdquo; Harry reminded, winking at him. &ldquo;My hair is styled, Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Mr. Perfect. I have to go, bye!&rdquo; He grinned and began to run down the now empty hallways.</p><p>Harry sighed under his breath and pulled the sunglasses off, rubbing the bridge of his nose. <i>Good</i>, he thought, <i>he hasn&rsquo;t noticed.</i></p><p>After a hurried train journey where he was itching to be the web-slinger again, he burst through Avenger&rsquo;s HQ (or &lsquo;America&rsquo;s dreamboat meet up place&rsquo; he had once called it as a joke.) Tony was in his office as usual and the excited boy ran up the stairs since he hated his strength to be wasted with a slow elevator ride, and halted outside the door. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mess,&rdquo; he murmured to himself and sorted his shirt out. He suddenly found himself out of breath, and at the first moment he wondered if he was having a panic attack. But then he realised he was out of breath from running up the stairs. Huh. Weird. That doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p><p>Despite this, he raised his fist to knock at the door but Pepper gladly opened it. FRIDAY had most likely announced his arrival. </p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she smiled warmly, and a small spark of happiness brought a smirk to his face. He strolled in, the faint smell of alcohol in the air (thanks heightened senses) and nothing had changed since he last came there, which was yesterday.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his office,&rdquo; she supplied and went back to the paperwork she was assigned. Peter nodded.</p><p>He slowly opened the door and noticed Tony working on some new suit, eyes focused and sweat trickling down his forehead. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark,&rdquo; he said, trying to make his voice enthusiastic and not drag and slur with the need to sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hey, kid- whoa, what happened to you?&rdquo; He asked, half joking and half concerned. Peter let ou a breathless laugh at sat beside him. &ldquo;Just stress. School and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded seriously, &ldquo;yeah, school and stuff.&rdquo; It took his slow mind to realise he was actually teasing him, and he was tempted to lightly punch him in the shoulder for fun, but they weren&rsquo;t there yet.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Psh, nothing &nbsp; I can bore you with.&rdquo; He said and stared at the thing he was tinkering with, slowly realising it was a boot for the upcoming Iron Man suit.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m bored enough. You think i do this for fun?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So having a teen ranting about his issues is your fun?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never know.&rdquo;</p><p>It was an hour of bouncing back ideas from one and other when Peter covered a yawn with the back of his hand, muffling the sound.</p><p>&ldquo;You tired?&rdquo; Stark asked, lifting up his eye protection to see the boy.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; Peter had slumped against his chair and cradled his head in his hands.
