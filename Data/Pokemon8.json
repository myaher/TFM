I\u2019m obsessed with music from video game soundtracks, death metal, Indie Pop and classic rock. Also I\u2019m fan of Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, Game Grumps and Pewdiepie. Animals are the best, mostly dogs. I just do my own thing and that\u2019s pretty much it. Kinda Hipster and Punk, and have stupid your sense of humor. I also do have an art blog where I post some of my personal artwork, sketches and illustrations. So yeah there\u2019s that.

Those are everyone&rsquo;s favorite! I liked Pikachu even before I ever liked Pok&eacute;mon. And I was often on the fence over whether or not I even liked Pok&eacute;mon back in the day. But Pikachu is just so perfectly cute! I also love everything Dragon and mythical already. </p><p>I originally never wanted to play Pok&eacute;mon Go because it seemed to be causing trouble IRL. But, my daughter wouldn&rsquo;t give up n lobbied me as nausium to play w her n the local little children in the neighborhood who needed an adult to go outside with them. &#65288;human abduction trafficking is a serious problem)  So, to humor the kids I downloaded the app n reluctantly began playing&hellip;. not long after the 1st hour, I couldn&rsquo;t stop playing, n played every day for weeks! </p><p>I noticed there were a number of unicorns that were Pok&eacute;mon n I love unicorns &#129412;! </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8017666cc1d5a6f4f9495efe9089f331/tumblr_prtb2gOAc01qbwdyb_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c90efb970ac784cb7728ed7df90e1d9a/tumblr_prtb2hFPGY1qbwdyb_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe51c9ab52f1ce07727132d6760d104d/tumblr_prtb2iGQsy1qbwdyb_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>So, at first I was very fond of Weedle. I took a number of photos w Weedle. </p><p>Then, I started going to classes at UMASS Boston. So, I kept playing, and I really liked #Gengar: </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30f7ad37e8695516aed3cb502110058d/tumblr_prtb2j1u2Y1qbwdyb_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8fa872d7c249f894ec44d49a49a1be8/tumblr_prtb2ktvqZ1qbwdyb_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I would&rsquo;ve continued to play but the size of the app got so large that by early 2018, I had to delete it off of my old original iPhone. </p><p>But after a videography gig I did in May last year, my coworker told me the game was updated n better than ever. I&rsquo;d made the conscious decision in June to completely leave Facebook n deactivated my account there. </p><p>So, I needed something to fill the void. </p><p>I was overwhelmed when I went back to play and forgot everything. I forgot what to do, and how to play. I also felt pretty lost in my life n spent much of my time working on video &amp; animation. </p><p>But, by the end of August I started playing here and there. By September my kid n spouse went back to school, but I didn&rsquo;t. So I had ample time to play. </p><p>But my iPhone kept getting hacked. It destroyed my old iPhone so by October Apple got me a new replacement. (Id been having a terrorism hacker problem for several years) </p><p>But, once I got that new iPhone I went fully hardcore. I pushed myself to do raids, Level up, and try to take on the gym myself. Eventually I started doing it. I never really did raids before that. </p><p>I noticed that when I played Pok&eacute;mon Go I actually felt happy. I already enjoyed going outside whenever the weather was good. </p><p>I started to notice that a certain Pok&eacute;mon used to make me feel especially happy inside which was #squirtle! I would feel very giddy and excited! So I would often try to find them! It soon became my favorite! </p><p>Then #Mudkip was out, and I was just as enamored w that one! I only have 2! </p><p>Then, #Lickitung! Lickitung is like a weird funny cute cute that&rsquo;s adorable! </p><p>Those were my top favorites this year&hellip;. </p><p>Until I started finding #Bulbasaur everywhere! </p><p>Currently Bulbasaur n all the Evolutions of it are my favorites! </p><p>I just love the cute moody Bulbasaur! It&rsquo;s so adorable! </p><p>#MyPokemonGoLife #PokemonGo </p></p>",
