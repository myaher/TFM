Like i know what you are gone say, but just hear me out here. Imagine this: </p><p>Peter Parker, who enjoys showing off &amp; being much better at academics &amp; P.E. then almost everyone. Many are jealous of him but also fear him. But everyone else loves this guy. The Peter Parker, who all the girls at Midtown have a crush on, but he only wants to win the heart of a certain blonde nerdy girl, Gwen Stacy, who too likes him enough but wishes he was less of a showoff and more kind towards everyone else. A great model, arrogant but still has a good heart and all. So when the radioactive spider bites him, it only increases his deeper self-centered ego and he starts to become more of an asshole. As a result, his relationship with uncle Ben is greatly damaged and he becomes more distant and bitter towards Ben, who justifyingly calls him out on how him being better than others doesn\u2019t automatically turn him into a bigger man and that he no longer is the same Peter, who despite everything, still showed his soft side towards the lesser, smaller students. He leaves after a fight with Ben, resulting him telling his uncle to stop trying to be his father and saying he was too soft himself when he was younger. He then goes to a wrestling ring just to vent off some frustration. He not only beats the wrestler, Crusher Hogan, but also severely injured him by breaking his leg and arm. Despite being a bit disturbed by this, he is granted money by the promoter. His fame grows as he selfishly uses his powers to fight in wrestling matches to gain more money as well as occasionally torment some freshman and sophomore kids for \u2018fun\u2019. One late night after another successful match, he is exiting when he hears a cop yelling for someone to stop an escaping convict. And as always, the burglar shows up but Peter lets him get away. And as he walks home, he starts to reflect how his powers have turned his ego into something of a superiority complex. This wasn\u2019t what he was supposed to be. And when he arrives, the shock at learning that his uncle was shot leaves him heartbroken and would trigger a need to kill the bastard responsible. He would then angrily swing to where the burglar was hiding. After disarming the guy, which results in breaking both of the bastard\u2019s hands, he would remove the man\u2019s mask and to his utter horror, the same man he himself allowed to escape. Instead of stopping him when he had the chance. For a couple of minutes, Peter considers ending the man\u2019s life. But stops and instead knocks him out. And leaves the warehouse. He mourns the death of his uncle, a man who was the closest thing to a father he never had. And reflecting on how much he had been reckless and misused his gifts for his own desires. He remembers the phrase Uncle Ben used to say sometimes, that he always dismissed jokingly, <i>with great power comes great responsibility</i>. He promises to from then on, become a better person as a result of his one terrible mistake along with working to control his own ego.                                                        (Don\u2019t know about y\u2019all, but this be a different but unique take on the character. Seeing as how we are so used to the standard underdog loser who becomes a hero after being a little irresponsible )</p>",
