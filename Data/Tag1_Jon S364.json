        "answer": "<p>Well - yes, Ned loved Lyanna and part of the reason we can tell is his commitment to the promise he made her. That doesn\u2019t mean Ned didn\u2019t love Jon in his own right, which he certainly did.</p><p>Going to put this under a cut for length.</p><!-- more --><p>Let\u2019s start with the fact that Ned named Jon Snow after Jon Arryn. That\u2019s an indicator and a public announcement of Ned\u2019s regard for the kid right there. On the first level, the kid\u2019s named for the Lord of the Vale and someone Ned cared for deeply, that\u2019s a simple mark of affection and regard. On the next level, by giving Jon Snow the name of Ned\u2019s\u00a0\u201csecond father,\u201d who he loves as a father despite the lack of the actual blood relationship, so Ned indicates that he loves Jon Snow as a son, again despite the lack of the actual blood relationship.</p><p>Then there\u2019s what we see in Bran III, ADWD.</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard seemed much younger this time. His hair was brown, with no hint of grey in it, his head bowed. \u201c\u2026 let them grow up close as brothers, with only love between them,\u201d he prayed, \u201cand let my lady wife find it in her heart to forgive \u2026\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><p>Context suggests that Ned\u2019s praying for Jon\u2019s happiness and welcome into the family. We see from Jon\u2019s PoV that Ned was unable to protect Jon from everything that flowed from his bastard status; we can also see from various other PoVs\u00a0that Ned did his best. Catelyn and Theon both note this.\u00a0One of the most poignant examples is in the very first chapter proper of the series.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLord Stark,\u201d Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at\u00a0him with desperate hope. \u201cThere are five pups,\u201d he told Father. \u201cThree male, two female.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat of it, Jon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have five trueborn children,\u201d Jon said. \u201cThree sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the\u00a0sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Bran saw his father\u2019s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count\u00a0had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</p><p>Their father understood as well. \u201cYou want no pup for yourself, Jon?\u201d he asked softly.<br/></p><p>- Bran I, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>Ned understands that symbolically excluding himself from a count of Ned\u2019s children hurts Jon, and he\u2019s not keen on the idea.\u00a0Over in Catelyn\u2019s PoV, we see Ned get angry at the prospect of Catelyn kicking Jon out of the house.</p><blockquote><p>The look Ned gave her was anguished. \u201cYou know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for him at court. A boy with a bastard\u2019s name\u2026 you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned.\u201d</p><p>Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband\u2019s eyes. \u201cThey say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd none of them has ever been seen at court!\u201d Ned blazed. \u201cThe Lannister woman has seen to that. How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He-\u201d</p><p>His fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in.</p><p>- Catelyn II, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>He\u2019s actually <i>angry</i>. There\u2019s more going on here than Catelyn knows, since while Ned could quite possibly find a place for his bastard son at court, there\u2019s no way in hell Ned\u2019s bringing Rhaegar Targaryen\u2019s biological son to the Red Keep and putting him in the proximity of Robert or the Lannisters. Nevertheless, Ned\u2019s anger reflects his commitment to Jon\u2019s welfare, and the fact that he argues using Jon\u2019s welfare as the reason behind his actions doesn\u2019t make Catelyn bat an eyelid with how unusual this is.</p><p>Ironically, one of the stronger bits of evidence that Jon isn\u2019t Ned\u2019s son also goes to show Ned\u2019s paternal love for him.</p><blockquote><p>Ned thought, if it came to that, the life of some child I did not know, against Robb and Sansa and Arya and Bran and Rickon, what would I do? Even more so, what would Catelyn do, if it were Jon\u2019s life, against the children of her body? He did not know. He prayed he never would.</p><p>- Eddard XII, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>No, Ned does not list Jon amongst his children. However, his questions about what Catelyn would do if it were Jon\u2019s life demonstrate that, though he might not think of Jon as his son, he would <i>act</i>\u00a0as though Jon were his son. The distinction between Ned\u2019s hypothetical actions and Catelyn\u2019s hypothetical actions is necessary - because Ned loves Jon as much as he loves his biological children.</p><p>This is not to say that Ned was a perfect parent to Jon. Jon certainly is under the impression that Ned\u2019s ashamed of both him and his mother. This sense of shame is part and parcel of a bastard\u2019s existence.\u00a0As Littlefinger tells Sansa,</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAlayne is pretty.\u201d Sansa hoped she would remember. \u201cBut couldn\u2019t I be the trueborn daughter of some knight in your service? Perhaps he died gallantly in the battle, and \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no gallant knights in my service, Alayne. Such a tale would draw unwanted questions as a corpse draws crows. <b>It is rude to pry into the origins of a man\u2019s natural children, however.</b>&ldquo;\u00a0<br/></p><p>- Sansa VI, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Ned isn\u2019t ashamed of Jon himself, but nor does he feel himself able to correct this misconception. (After all, if it\u2019s not shame holding Ned\u2019s tongue, what reason does he have to be so closemouthed about Jon\u2019s parentage?)\u00a0When Ned himself is in the black cells, then he feels shame.</p><blockquote><p>The thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame, and a sorrow too deep for words. If only he could see the boy again, sit and talk with him\u2026 </p><p>- Eddard XV, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>This shame comes from his awareness of how he\u2019s failed Jon as a parent. Specifically, the addition of Ned\u2019s\u00a0desire to talk to Jon (and, the implication is, to tell him about his mother) would indicate his awareness of how Ned\u2019s secrecy has hurt Jon, serious regret for that fact, and a desire to correct it.</p><p>While the situation surrounding Jon\u2019s adoption is complicated and painful, and for more than just Ned, it\u2019s still clear that Ned did his level best as a parent for Jon\u2019s own sake, not just Lyanna\u2019s. He is Jon\u2019s father in every sense but the biological one. It\u2019s a relationship of love.</p>",

He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count\u00a0had come right only because Jon had omitted himself.

He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in.</p><p>- Catelyn II, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>He\u2019s actually <i>angry</i>. There\u2019s more going on here than Catelyn knows, since while Ned could quite possibly find a place for his bastard son at court, there\u2019s no way in hell Ned\u2019s bringing Rhaegar Targaryen\u2019s biological son to the Red Keep and putting him in the proximity of Robert or the Lannisters. Nevertheless, Ned\u2019s anger reflects his commitment to Jon\u2019s welfare, and the fact that he argues using Jon\u2019s welfare as the reason behind his actions doesn\u2019t make Catelyn bat an eyelid with how unusual this is.</p><p>Ironically, one of the stronger bits of evidence that Jon isn\u2019t Ned\u2019s son also goes to show Ned\u2019s paternal love for him.</p><blockquote><p>Ned thought, if it came to that, the life of some child I did not know, against Robb and Sansa and Arya and Bran and Rickon, what would I do? Even more so, what would Catelyn do, if it were Jon\u2019s life, against the children of her body? He did not know. He prayed he never would.</p><p>- Eddard XII, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>No, Ned does not list Jon amongst his children. However, his questions about what Catelyn would do if it were Jon\u2019s life demonstrate that, though he might not think of Jon as his son, he would <i>act</i>\u00a0as though Jon were his son. The distinction between Ned\u2019s hypothetical actions and Catelyn\u2019s hypothetical actions is necessary - because Ned loves Jon as much as he loves his biological children.</p><p>This is not to say that Ned was a perfect parent to Jon. Jon certainly is under the impression that Ned\u2019s ashamed of both him and his mother. This sense of shame is part and parcel of a bastard\u2019s existence.\u00a0As Littlefinger tells Sansa,</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAlayne is pretty.\u201d Sansa hoped she would remember. \u201cBut couldn\u2019t I be the trueborn daughter of some knight in your service? Perhaps he died gallantly in the battle, and \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no gallant knights in my service, Alayne. Such a tale would draw unwanted questions as a corpse draws crows. <b>It is rude to pry into the origins of a man\u2019s natural children, however.</b>\u201c\u00a0<br></p><p>- Sansa VI, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Ned isn\u2019t ashamed of Jon himself, but nor does he feel himself able to correct this misconception. (After all, if it\u2019s not shame holding Ned\u2019s tongue, what reason does he have to be so closemouthed about Jon\u2019s parentage?)\u00a0When Ned himself is in the black cells, then he feels shame.</p><blockquote><p>The thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame, and a sorrow too deep for words. If only he could see the boy again, sit and talk with him\u2026 </p><p>- Eddard XV, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>This shame comes from his awareness of how he\u2019s failed Jon as a parent. Specifically, the addition of Ned\u2019s\u00a0desire to talk to Jon (and, the implication is, to tell him about his mother) would indicate his awareness of how Ned\u2019s secrecy has hurt Jon, serious regret for that fact, and a desire to correct it.</p><p>While the situation surrounding Jon\u2019s adoption is complicated and painful, and for more than just Ned, it\u2019s still clear that Ned did his level best as a parent for Jon\u2019s own sake, not just Lyanna\u2019s. He is Jon\u2019s father in every sense but the biological one. It\u2019s a relationship of love.</p>",

That\u2019s an indicator and a public announcement of Ned\u2019s regard for the kid right there. On the first level, the kid\u2019s named for the Lord of the Vale and someone Ned cared for deeply, that\u2019s a simple mark of affection and regard. On the next level, by giving Jon Snow the name of Ned\u2019s\u00a0\u201csecond father,\u201d who he loves as a father despite the lack of the actual blood relationship, so Ned indicates that he loves Jon Snow as a son, again despite the lack of the actual blood relationship.</p><p>Then there\u2019s what we see in Bran III, ADWD.</p><blockquote><p>Lord Eddard seemed much younger this time.

We see from Jon\u2019s PoV that Ned was unable to protect Jon from everything that flowed from his bastard status; we can also see from various other PoVs\u00a0that Ned did his best. Catelyn and Theon both note this.\u00a0One of the most poignant examples is in the very first chapter proper of the series.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLord Stark,\u201d Jon said.

Instead, she made plans with Mya and Myranda, went to drama practice to help with costumes, and cheered Arya on at her fencing competitions.</p><p><br/></p><p>When she did go back, it was her father who offered to drive her. They went on a Sunday afternoon, and Arya tagged along, as well.</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya chattered on about the highlights from her last fencing match and what to expect in her next competition from the back seat. Sansa stayed quiet, lost in thought, trying to chase away her sad feelings and growing anxiety. When they arrived at the reservation, Arya disappeared within the first ten seconds, off to find Nymeria.</p><p><br/></p><p>Ned wrapped his arm around Sansa. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you show me your pup?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sansa gave him a smile and led the way. When they reached the pen, she spotted Ghost, who seemed to have grown over double in size since she\u2019d last seen him. \u201cHe\u2019s not really a pup anymore,\u201d she observed.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNed! Is that you? How are you doing, old friend?\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Sansa watched as Mr. Mormont embraces her father and slapped him on the back. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cFinally come to see how your money\u2019s being used, eh?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Ned laughed. \u201cTrust me, these checks I am happy to write, Mormont. Tell me how this beast is getting on.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYour girl has a better idea than me,\u201d Mormont told him, with his eyes on Sansa. \u201cThough I haven\u2019t seen her in a while. Ghost has missed you, Sansa. Both you and Jon. I\u2019ve missed you, too, if I\u2019m being honest. It was always nice to see you kids. Not many folk who are so caring around the wolves as you. Not many visitors who go through the trouble of making an old bear Christmas presents neither.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sansa gave her best attempt at a smile. \u201cI missed you both too.\u201d She walked into the pen, and Ghost all but tackled her. Sansa crouched down to rub behind his ears. She threw her arms around his warm fur, and held him close. \u201cOh, I missed you, my sweet boy.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Ned and Mormont continued to talk as Sansa scratched Ghost\u2019s belly and brushed his coat, until Mormont had to go check on another wolf and Ned joined them. He ran his fingers through Ghost\u2019s fur.</p><p><br/></p><p>They were quiet for a few minutes, petting Ghost and laughing at his lolling tongue. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a loyal beast,\u201d Ned said softly. \u201cWhen Lady died, you wouldn\u2019t go near wolves for months. Just the mention of them made you cry. I felt like it was my fault for bringing you here, only to have it bring you so much pain.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Dad,\u201d Sansa told him, her eyes glistening. \u201cLady was sick.\u201d And it was horrible when she died, like a part of Sansa had died with her. But somehow she survived it, and maybe Lady\u2019s spirit stayed with her\u2014and help her survive now. \u201cI\u2019m glad I got to spend time with her when I did.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Ned wrapped his arm around her. \u201cI don\u2019t need to know all the details about what happened between you and Jon. I know that the two of you developed a bond, and I know you\u2019ve seemed sad ever since you stopped coming here with him. But I just want you to know, you don\u2019t need Jon to spend time with wolves, Sansa. They\u2019ll always be a part of who you are.\u201d He kissed the crown of her head.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cD\u2014do you think we could come back next week?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>They visited Ghost together regularly, though not on any fixed day, given her Dad\u2019s duties at work, their family\u2019s busy schedule, and Sansa\u2019s own responsibilities. </p><p><br/></p><p>A couple of months later, fitting in a visit to the reservation with her dad was starting to feel like part of the routine\u2014as was not seeing Jon.</p><p><br/></p><p>He hadn\u2019t disappeared completely.

                "content": "<p><h1>Time with Wolves &mdash; Chapter 8</h1><p>Sansa didn&rsquo;t go back to the wolf reservation for over two months. Instead, she made plans with Mya and Myranda, went to drama practice to help with costumes, and cheered Arya on at her fencing competitions.</p><p><br /></p><p>When she did go back, it was her father who offered to drive her. They went on a Sunday afternoon, and Arya tagged along, as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>Arya chattered on about the highlights from her last fencing match and what to expect in her next competition from the back seat. Sansa stayed quiet, lost in thought, trying to chase away her sad feelings and growing anxiety. When they arrived at the reservation, Arya disappeared within the first ten seconds, off to find Nymeria.</p><p><br /></p><p>Ned wrapped his arm around Sansa. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you show me your pup?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sansa gave him a smile and led the way. When they reached the pen, she spotted Ghost, who seemed to have grown over double in size since she&rsquo;d last seen him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not really a pup anymore,&rdquo; she observed.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ned! Is that you? How are you doing, old friend?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Sansa watched as Mr. Mormont embraces her father and slapped him on the back. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Finally come to see how your money&rsquo;s being used, eh?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Ned laughed. &ldquo;Trust me, these checks I am happy to write, Mormont. Tell me how this beast is getting on.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your girl has a better idea than me,&rdquo; Mormont told him, with his eyes on Sansa. &ldquo;Though I haven&rsquo;t seen her in a while. Ghost has missed you, Sansa. Both you and Jon. I&rsquo;ve missed you, too, if I&rsquo;m being honest. It was always nice to see you kids. Not many folk who are so caring around the wolves as you. Not many visitors who go through the trouble of making an old bear Christmas presents neither.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sansa gave her best attempt at a smile. &ldquo;I missed you both too.&rdquo; She walked into the pen, and Ghost all but tackled her. Sansa crouched down to rub behind his ears. She threw her arms around his warm fur, and held him close. &ldquo;Oh, I missed you, my sweet boy.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Ned and Mormont continued to talk as Sansa scratched Ghost&rsquo;s belly and brushed his coat, until Mormont had to go check on another wolf and Ned joined them. He ran his fingers through Ghost&rsquo;s fur.</p><p><br /></p><p>They were quiet for a few minutes, petting Ghost and laughing at his lolling tongue. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a loyal beast,&rdquo; Ned said softly. &ldquo;When Lady died, you wouldn&rsquo;t go near wolves for months. Just the mention of them made you cry. I felt like it was my fault for bringing you here, only to have it bring you so much pain.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault, Dad,&rdquo; Sansa told him, her eyes glistening. &ldquo;Lady was sick.&rdquo; And it was horrible when she died, like a part of Sansa had died with her. But somehow she survived it, and maybe Lady&rsquo;s spirit stayed with her&mdash;and help her survive now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I got to spend time with her when I did.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Ned wrapped his arm around her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to know all the details about what happened between you and Jon. I know that the two of you developed a bond, and I know you&rsquo;ve seemed sad ever since you stopped coming here with him. But I just want you to know, you don&rsquo;t need Jon to spend time with wolves, Sansa. They&rsquo;ll always be a part of who you are.&rdquo; He kissed the crown of her head.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;D&mdash;do you think we could come back next week?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>They visited Ghost together regularly, though not on any fixed day, given her Dad&rsquo;s duties at work, their family&rsquo;s busy schedule, and Sansa&rsquo;s own responsibilities. </p><p><br /></p><p>A couple of months later, fitting in a visit to the reservation with her dad was starting to feel like part of the routine&mdash;as was not seeing Jon.</p><p><br /></p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t disappeared completely. She still saw him sometimes at school and a couple of times around town. He even swung by the house to meet Robb, though he never stayed for dinner anymore. He was always polite, always said hello. But their interactions were stilted, as though the months of sitting in his car together every week had never happened. </p><p><br /></p><p>Sansa would be lying to herself if she said that she&rsquo;d forgotten a moment of that time. It hurt deeply that he seemed so keen on creating a distance between them. But she&rsquo;d already cried her tears. And there was nothing to be gained by dwelling on whatever it was they shared now that it was over. </p><p><br /></p><p>She tried not to think too much on Jon, but some days it felt like she was just waiting to see a glimpse of his face or hear someone mention his name.</p><p><br /></p><p>One night after dinner, Sansa took extra time drying the dishes so she could eavesdrop on a conversation Robb and Theon were having in the other room. As Jon no longer came round for dinner, Theon was taking his place&mdash;a poor consolation prize, Sansa felt. Theon wasn&rsquo;t such a bad guy, but he was crass and a giant perv. She could hear him describing some girl in graphic detail.</p><p><br /></p><p>Ordinarily, Sansa would try to tune Theon out when he did this, but she&rsquo;d heard him mention Jon&rsquo;s name. So instead she strained her ears as hard as she could.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure she&rsquo;s 21?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, man! I bet she&rsquo;d buy us some booze if we paid her.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;But why would she be hanging out with Jon if she&rsquo;s 21?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I told you. He said they met at those meetings he goes to for the army.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sansa didn&rsquo;t realize Jon had told Robb or Theon about his plans.
