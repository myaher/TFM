        "body": "<p>(I am not Englisch, so sorry for mistakes)<br/><br/>It was just an ordinary day at Hogwarts. Sherlock was brewing some \npotions for an experiment, while John was fascinated by Sherlocks \nknowledge.<br/>Sherlock was sorted into Ravenclaw, because he was \nsmart and he loved to study. John was a Gryffindor, he loved adventure \nand he was never afraid. He always follows Sherlock on his adventures, \nat that part he was a bit like a Hufflepuff, always wanted to help \nSherlock.<br/>Once they had a mystery which leaded the boys to the \nforbidden forest. Nobody goes there, but John and Sherlock did. Sherlock\n goes often to the forest for some of his experiments. Sometimes John \nand Sherlock walked deep into the forest. Many mysteries had waited for \nthem there. For John was living with Sherlock one big adventure, he \nnever gets bored.<br/>Sherlock was a Ravenclaw, but he was also part \nSlytherin. He always strives for success and wanted to show how good he \nis in what he does. For Sherlock was solving mysteries like the drugs \nthey had in the muggle world.<br/>\u2018John, give me some ingredients.\u2019 Sherlock asked.<br/>\u2018Why don\u2019t you do it yourself?\u2019<br/>\u2018Because I need to keep this steady. Otherwise it will explode.\u2019<br/>John\n sighs, but still walks to the other table for ingredients. He looked \ntrough the window. It was dark outside during this winter. The castle \ngrounds where filled with snow. The moon slowly rises upon the sky. It \nwas a full moon, beautiful, like a silver piece of the universe.<br/>Johns\n thoughts where roughly interrupted by a loud scream. Sherlock looked \ndirectly at John. &lsquo;Murder.&rsquo; He said as a small smile appeared on his \nface. Sherlock jumps off his chair and drops everything he had in his \nhands.<br/>'Come on John! We got a new mystery!&rsquo;<br/>Sherlock and \nJohn had just left the room, when John heard a pop. The potion was \nexploded and probably left a mess. Snape won\u2019t be happy.</p><p>The two \nlast years ran towards the origin of the scream. It was in one of the \nother dungeons where they found the body. It was a boy with brown hair.<br/>\u2018First years, I think. A Ravenclaw.\u2019 John said.<br/>\u2018First\n years, I know, he doesn\u2019t have books from the second year in his bag.\u2019 \nSherlock dropped the bag and looked at the boy. The body was full of \nblood and in a horrible condition. From the murderer was no sign.<br/>\u2018The\n wounds are about four centimetres deep, but look at his chest.\u2019 John \nsaid. The chest was ripped open. It looked like some kind of animal.<br/>\u2018Werewolf.\u2019 Sherlock said. John looks up from the body.<br/>\u2018Werewolf?\u2019<br/>\u2018Yes, a werewolf, are you deaf.\u2019<br/>\u2018How do you know?\u2019<br/>\u2018Look\n at the wounds. The most of them are like lines, scratches of a claw. \nThey are four centimetres deep as you mentioned earlier. The scratches \nare at a certain distance from each other. Not more than two \ncentimetres. Spread your fingers and look at them, the distance is not \nvery far from each other, just like these scratches. Besides, Hogwarts \nis extremely secured. Only a teacher or a student could do this, but \nthis looks like an animal. What animal do we know with a human form, or \nbetter, what kind of human has the form of an animal? Yes, the \nwerewolf.\u2019 Sherlock looked at the bleeding body on the ground.<br/>\u2018One\n of the students is the werewolf, look again at the distance between the\n scratches. The hands can\u2019t be from an adult. The deepest wounds bend to\n the right, so the Murderer is right-handed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You two, go away!\u2019 Professor McGonagall said as she walked into the dungeon, followed by professor Snape.<br/>\u201950 points from Gryffindor and Ravenclaw.\u2019 Snape said full of anger.<br/>\u2018What?! Why!\u2019 John said surprised.<br/>\u2018Because you two ruined my classroom and are always the first persons at things like this!\u2019<br/>John wanted to protest, but he knew it was better not to argue with Snape.<br/>\u2018It was a werewolf, I don\u2019t need any thanks.\u2019 Sherlock said when he got up.<br/>\u2018Clean my classroom and go to your dormitories.\u2019 Ordered Snape grumpy.</p><p>The\n next day Sherlock and John where in the Great hall with all the other \nstudents. Professor Dumbledore tried to get the students quiet.<br/>\u2018A\n student was murdered last night.\u2019 He said. Some students began to \nscream, while others began to talk loudly. Sherlock and John looked at \neach other, this was old news for them.<br/>\u2018We don\u2019t know who or what\n did this.\u2019 Dumbledore said, when the room had come to rest again. \nSherlock rolls his eyes, they knew it, he had said it yesterday, but \nthey won\u2019t believe him. Why do they never believe him?!<br/>\u2018There is no reason for panic! Professor Lupin and professor Snape will keep an eye out.\u2019<br/>Sherlock\n hated it when there where more professors awake at night. It only \nhindered his investigation, but he had to deal with it.<br/>Dumbledore\n was still talking, but Sherlock wasn\u2019t listening anymore. He was \nlooking at the other students, observing them. Too young, too tall, too \nsmall, his eyes went from one to the other, but he did not see the \npossible perpetrator so quickly.</p><p>\u2018Sherlock, we need to find the killer, before the next full moon!\u2019 John said when they left the Great hall.<br/>\u2018We will find the killer John\u2019 Sherlock looked at his friend.<br/>\u2018You saw the body, we can\u2019t let that happen to anyone else.\u2019<br/>\u2018I agree.\u2019<br/>\u00b4So, are we searching for a first years? They are new, just like this wolf.\u2019<br/>They walked to Lupins classroom.<br/>\u2018No, it could just as well be a fourth-year student who just has been bitten.\u2019<br/>Sherlock held his hands under his chin and thought.<br/>\u2018Maybe someone with scars or wounds.. Or someone who is scared of the moon.. someone who can disappear without anyone noticing.\u2019<br/>\u2018Maybe a twin?\u2019<br/>\u2018Indeed John, a twin!\u2019</p><p>The boys walked into the classroom. Lupin was already talking.<br/>\u2018Today\n we repeat the Patronus Charm, because the dementors are coming. They \nheard about the murder and will be on the castle grounds. For your own \nsafety, we repeat this charm.\u2019 Lupin went to Sherlock and John.<br/>\u2018Sherlock, can you give an example?\u2019<br/>\u2018Of course I can. Expecto patronum.\u2019 A silvery-white otter appeared from Sherlocks wand and dances through the classroom.<br/>\u2018Now John.\u2019 Lupin said.<br/>\u2018Expecto patronum.\u2019 A small hedgehog appeared from Johns wand. Lupin applauded for the boys.<br/>\u2018Well done!\u2019 He said. \u2018Well done, both of you. 10 Points to Gryffindor and Ravenclaw!\u2019</p><p>After class Lupin called Sherlock and John.<br/>\u2018I know you two like adventure and mysteries, but stay away from this one. Werewolves are dangerous.\u2019<br/>\u2018You can know, you are one yourself.\u2019 Sherlock said with a face of steal. Lupin looked surprised at him.<br/>\u2018Yes, that\u2019s true.\u2019<br/>\u2018So you are the killer?\u2019 John mentions.<br/>\u2018No, Snape makes potions for him every month, so he can control himself when he takes one. Am I right professor?\u2019<br/>\u2018Yes Sherlock, you are right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are we going to listen to him?\u2019 John asked when they left the classroom.<br/>\u2018No.\u2019<br/>\u2018So tonight..\u2019<br/>\u2018Yes, we will find this wolf. The game is on!\u2019</p><p>That\n same night Sherlock and John were on their way to the dungeons. \nSherlock wanted to see the crime scene again. When they arrived, \nSherlock went straight ahead. He looked at the place where the body was.<br/>\u2018Clothes.\u2019 John mentioned.<br/>\u2018At\n least a piece of it.\u2019 Sherlock said when he picks it up. \u2018From a new \ncloak. I also saw some hair, long hair so our killer is very likely a \ngirl.\u2019<br/>\u2018There are like six girl twins at Hogwarts.\u2019<br/>\u2018We go to the Slytherins, maybe they will tell something about their friends.\u2019<br/><br/>\u2018Sarah and Laurel often come here.\u2019 One of the Slytherins said.<br/>\u2018Jade and Amy are my best friends.\u2019 Another one said. Sherlock looked at John. This twin had blind hair.<br/>\u2018Both of the twins often come here.\u2019 The last one said. John and Sherlock had new suspects.<br/>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 John asks Sherlock.<br/>\u2018We need to go to the Hufflepuffs.\u2019</p><p>The\n common room of the Hufflepuffs was very quiet. Everyone was asleep when\n Sherlock and John walked in. Upstairs Sherlock heard a noise. It was \ntalking.. from two people. Why where they awake so late?<br/>\u2018John, upstairs, do you hear that?\u2019 Sherlock asked. John listens very carefully.<br/>\u2018Girls? Talking?\u2019<br/>\u2018Grab\n your wand.\u2019 John grabs his wand and walked upstairs with Sherlock \nbehind him. His wand ready to attack. The door creaked when John \ncarefully opened it. The talking fell silent and the room filled with \nsoft snoring. It was dark, the boys could barely see. John walked into \nthe room with Sherlock right behind him.<br/>Sherlock heard someone \ngasp for breath. Alarmed by the sound he turned. Two girls where sitting\n in the corner. One of them was crying.<br/>\u2018The wolf I suppose.\u2019 \nSherlock said as he points his wand at the girls. The girls got up, they\n had their wands in their hands. One of them had the wand in the left \nhand, the other in the right.<br/>\u2018Flipendo!\u2019 Sherlock was blown back with a tremendous force. The girl ran out of the room, John ran after her.<br/>The\n other girls in the room startled awake and started talking. Sherlock \nran trough the door. He ran to a secret passage, his mind says they are \ngoing to the castle grounds.</p><p>Sherlock was right. He got out of the castle at the same time as John and the girl.<br/>\u2018Jade, stop! We know what you are!\u2019 The Hufflepuff began to run faster.<br/>\u2018Petrificus totalus!\u2019 Sherlock missed the girl barely. \u2018Colloshoo.\u2019 Again he missed. They\n ran further and further. Then suddenly everything went cold. It was \nwinter, so the grounds couldn\u2019t freeze any further, but Sherlock knew \nwhat was coming.<br/>\u2018Dementors?\u2019 John asked.<br/>\u2018Obviously.\u2019<br/>The black shadow appeared for Jade. She started screaming, but felt in silence when the dementor started eating.<br/>\u2018Expecto\n patronum!\u2019 John and Sherlock screamed together. The hedgehog and the \notter stormed at the creature that drew backwards. The light was shining\n so bright that it blinded Sherlock and John for a moment. Another \ndementor showed up before Sherlock.<br/>\u2018Jawn!\u2019 Sherlock screamed. John pushed Sherlock away from the dark creature.<br/>\u2018Expecto\n patronum!\u2019 Sherlock stands and John didn\u2019t had to think any longer. He \ngrabbed Jade by her arm and threw her away from the dementor into the \ncastle. Sherlock followed right behind.</p><p>\u2018We are alive.\u2019 John laughs. Sherlock looked at the girl. She was shaking all over her body.<br/>\u2018You were very stupid, everyone knows there are dementors outside right now!\u2019 Jade didn\u2019t say anything.<br/>\u2018Here, some chocolate. I had it in my pocket, because of the dementors.\u2019 John breaks the chocolate and held a piece to Jade.<br/>\u2018Eat it, you will feel better.\u2019<br/>\u2018Stop the nonsense John, we got our killer.\u2019 Jade looked directly at Sherlock.<br/>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody.\u2019 She started crying. \u2018I don\u2019t know what happened.\u2019<br/>\u2018You are a werewolf, you know what you did, you talked to your sister about that.\u2019 John looked from his friend to the girl and back.<br/>\u2018How did you knew it was her?\u2019 He asked.<br/>\u2018She\n has long blond hair, she is a Hufflepuff, the cloak we found was new, \nshe is a last years student, but she got recently a new cloak. In the \ngreat hall she castes her Patronus charm, I noticed it had changed into a\n wolf. Before it was a mastiff. She is right-handed, because she holds \nher wand in the right hand. And she is a twin, so she could easily \ndisappear without anyone noticing. Besides, she has friends in \nSlytherin, so that was her reason for being in the dungeons. She felt \nthere was something wrong, so she ran to the other dungeon where she \nkilled someone.\u2019<br/>\u2018How did she became a werewolf?\u2019 John asked.<br/>\u2018A\n wolf named Moriary bit me after flying class last week. He said he \nwanted to create panic in the school. Please don\u2019t tell anyone.\u2019<br/>\u2018Don\u2019t be scared only Dumbledore will know about this.\u2019 John said.<br/>\u2018Obviously. The rest will kill you if they knew.\u2019<br/>John gave Sherlock an angry look.<br/>'But that won\u2019t happen.\u2019 Sherlock said quickly.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing here?!\u2019 Professor Lupin asked. Snape stand behind him and looked really angry.<br/>'We..\u2019 John fell silent.<br/>'Sherlock\n and John. I could know. Always on an adventure.\u2019 Dumbledore walked in \nto the room. \u2018You can go, I think I need to talk to them alone.\u2019 He \nsaid. The professors leaved the room.<br/>'We got your killer.\u2019 Sherlock said. Dumbledore looked at Jade. She was still shaking.<br/>\u2018Get\n her to Madam Pomfrey John. We will give her potions every month. She \ncan stay at Hogwarts.\u2019 John left the room with Jade. Sherlock looked at \nDumbledore.<br/>'You did believe me. I knew it, you didn\u2019t tell it, so\n the wolf could stay at Hogwarts when you found out who it was.\u2019 \nDumbledore smiled.<br/>'You are smart Sherlock. 100 points to Ravenclaw and Gryffindor. You solved the mystery.\u2019<br/>'As always.\u2019 Sherlock mentioned.</p><p>John will write the story in his book.

Or someone who is scared of the moon.. someone who can disappear without anyone noticing.\u2019<br>\u2018Maybe a twin?\u2019<br>\u2018Indeed John, a twin!\u2019</p><p>The boys walked into the classroom. Lupin was already talking.<br>\u2018Today\n we repeat the Patronus Charm, because the dementors are coming. They \nheard about the murder and will be on the castle grounds. For your own \nsafety, we repeat this charm.\u2019 Lupin went to Sherlock and John.<br>\u2018Sherlock, can you give an example?\u2019<br>\u2018Of course I can. Expecto patronum.\u2019 A silvery-white otter appeared from Sherlocks wand and dances through the classroom.<br>\u2018Now John.\u2019 Lupin said.<br>\u2018Expecto patronum.\u2019 A small hedgehog appeared from Johns wand. Lupin applauded for the boys.<br>\u2018Well done!\u2019 He said. \u2018Well done, both of you. 10 Points to Gryffindor and Ravenclaw!\u2019</p><p>After class Lupin called Sherlock and John.<br>\u2018I know you two like adventure and mysteries, but stay away from this one. Werewolves are dangerous.\u2019<br>\u2018You can know, you are one yourself.\u2019 Sherlock said with a face of steal. Lupin looked surprised at him.<br>\u2018Yes, that\u2019s true.\u2019<br>\u2018So you are the killer?\u2019 John mentions.<br>\u2018No, Snape makes potions for him every month, so he can control himself when he takes one. Am I right professor?\u2019<br>\u2018Yes Sherlock, you are right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are we going to listen to him?\u2019 John asked when they left the classroom.<br>\u2018No.\u2019<br>\u2018So tonight..\u2019<br>\u2018Yes, we will find this wolf. The game is on!\u2019</p><p>That\n same night Sherlock and John were on their way to the dungeons. \nSherlock wanted to see the crime scene again. When they arrived, \nSherlock went straight ahead. He looked at the place where the body was.<br>\u2018Clothes.\u2019 John mentioned.<br>\u2018At\n least a piece of it.\u2019 Sherlock said when he picks it up. \u2018From a new \ncloak. I also saw some hair, long hair so our killer is very likely a \ngirl.\u2019<br>\u2018There are like six girl twins at Hogwarts.\u2019<br>\u2018We go to the Slytherins, maybe they will tell something about their friends.\u2019<br><br>\u2018Sarah and Laurel often come here.\u2019 One of the Slytherins said.<br>\u2018Jade and Amy are my best friends.\u2019 Another one said. Sherlock looked at John. This twin had blind hair.<br>\u2018Both of the twins often come here.\u2019 The last one said. John and Sherlock had new suspects.<br>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 John asks Sherlock.<br>\u2018We need to go to the Hufflepuffs.\u2019</p><p>The\n common room of the Hufflepuffs was very quiet. Everyone was asleep when\n Sherlock and John walked in. Upstairs Sherlock heard a noise. It was \ntalking.. from two people. Why where they awake so late?<br>\u2018John, upstairs, do you hear that?\u2019 Sherlock asked. John listens very carefully.<br>\u2018Girls? Talking?\u2019<br>\u2018Grab\n your wand.\u2019 John grabs his wand and walked upstairs with Sherlock \nbehind him. His wand ready to attack. The door creaked when John \ncarefully opened it. The talking fell silent and the room filled with \nsoft snoring. It was dark, the boys could barely see. John walked into \nthe room with Sherlock right behind him.<br>Sherlock heard someone \ngasp for breath. Alarmed by the sound he turned. Two girls where sitting\n in the corner. One of them was crying.<br>\u2018The wolf I suppose.\u2019 \nSherlock said as he points his wand at the girls. The girls got up, they\n had their wands in their hands. One of them had the wand in the left \nhand, the other in the right.<br>\u2018Flipendo!\u2019 Sherlock was blown back with a tremendous force. The girl ran out of the room, John ran after her.<br>The\n other girls in the room startled awake and started talking. Sherlock \nran trough the door. He ran to a secret passage, his mind says they are \ngoing to the castle grounds.</p><p>Sherlock was right. He got out of the castle at the same time as John and the girl.<br>\u2018Jade, stop! We know what you are!\u2019 The Hufflepuff began to run faster.<br>\u2018Petrificus totalus!\u2019 Sherlock missed the girl barely. \u2018Colloshoo.\u2019 Again he missed. They\n ran further and further. Then suddenly everything went cold. It was \nwinter, so the grounds couldn\u2019t freeze any further, but Sherlock knew \nwhat was coming.<br>\u2018Dementors?\u2019 John asked.<br>\u2018Obviously.\u2019<br>The black shadow appeared for Jade. She started screaming, but felt in silence when the dementor started eating.<br>\u2018Expecto\n patronum!\u2019 John and Sherlock screamed together. The hedgehog and the \notter stormed at the creature that drew backwards. The light was shining\n so bright that it blinded Sherlock and John for a moment. Another \ndementor showed up before Sherlock.<br>\u2018Jawn!\u2019 Sherlock screamed. John pushed Sherlock away from the dark creature.<br>\u2018Expecto\n patronum!\u2019 Sherlock stands and John didn\u2019t had to think any longer. He \ngrabbed Jade by her arm and threw her away from the dementor into the \ncastle. Sherlock followed right behind.</p><p>\u2018We are alive.\u2019 John laughs. Sherlock looked at the girl. She was shaking all over her body.<br>\u2018You were very stupid, everyone knows there are dementors outside right now!\u2019 Jade didn\u2019t say anything.<br>\u2018Here, some chocolate. I had it in my pocket, because of the dementors.\u2019 John breaks the chocolate and held a piece to Jade.<br>\u2018Eat it, you will feel better.\u2019<br>\u2018Stop the nonsense John, we got our killer.\u2019 Jade looked directly at Sherlock.<br>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody.\u2019 She started crying. \u2018I don\u2019t know what happened.\u2019<br>\u2018You are a werewolf, you know what you did, you talked to your sister about that.\u2019 John looked from his friend to the girl and back.<br>\u2018How did you knew it was her?\u2019 He asked.<br>\u2018She\n has long blond hair, she is a Hufflepuff, the cloak we found was new, \nshe is a last years student, but she got recently a new cloak. In the \ngreat hall she castes her Patronus charm, I noticed it had changed into a\n wolf. Before it was a mastiff. She is right-handed, because she holds \nher wand in the right hand. And she is a twin, so she could easily \ndisappear without anyone noticing. Besides, she has friends in \nSlytherin, so that was her reason for being in the dungeons. She felt \nthere was something wrong, so she ran to the other dungeon where she \nkilled someone.\u2019<br>\u2018How did she became a werewolf?\u2019 John asked.<br>\u2018A\n wolf named Moriary bit me after flying class last week. He said he \nwanted to create panic in the school. Please don\u2019t tell anyone.\u2019<br>\u2018Don\u2019t be scared only Dumbledore will know about this.\u2019 John said.<br>\u2018Obviously. The rest will kill you if they knew.\u2019<br>John gave Sherlock an angry look.<br>'But that won\u2019t happen.\u2019 Sherlock said quickly.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing here?!\u2019 Professor Lupin asked. Snape stand behind him and looked really angry.<br>'We..\u2019 John fell silent.<br>'Sherlock\n and John. I could know. Always on an adventure.\u2019 Dumbledore walked in \nto the room. \u2018You can go, I think I need to talk to them alone.\u2019 He \nsaid. The professors leaved the room.<br>'We got your killer.\u2019 Sherlock said. Dumbledore looked at Jade. She was still shaking.<br>\u2018Get\n her to Madam Pomfrey John. We will give her potions every month. She \ncan stay at Hogwarts.\u2019 John left the room with Jade. Sherlock looked at \nDumbledore.<br>'You did believe me. I knew it, you didn\u2019t tell it, so\n the wolf could stay at Hogwarts when you found out who it was.\u2019 \nDumbledore smiled.<br>'You are smart Sherlock. 100 points to Ravenclaw and Gryffindor. You solved the mystery.\u2019<br>'As always.\u2019 Sherlock mentioned.</p><p>John will write the story in his book. Because adventure and mystery.. that was what the boys loved<br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"576\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6e1ead4d9216c8cd460d3ffac79c045/tumblr_inline_pdwra1FZr41twl28f_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"576\"></figure><p>It took me a whole day to write this, so please <b>do not copy</b> it!</p><p>My\n first story in English.

                "content_raw": "<p>(I am not Englisch, so sorry for mistakes)<br><br>It was just an ordinary day at Hogwarts. Sherlock was brewing some \npotions for an experiment, while John was fascinated by Sherlocks \nknowledge.<br>Sherlock was sorted into Ravenclaw, because he was \nsmart and he loved to study. John was a Gryffindor, he loved adventure \nand he was never afraid. He always follows Sherlock on his adventures, \nat that part he was a bit like a Hufflepuff, always wanted to help \nSherlock.<br>Once they had a mystery which leaded the boys to the \nforbidden forest. Nobody goes there, but John and Sherlock did. Sherlock\n goes often to the forest for some of his experiments. Sometimes John \nand Sherlock walked deep into the forest. Many mysteries had waited for \nthem there. For John was living with Sherlock one big adventure, he \nnever gets bored.<br>Sherlock was a Ravenclaw, but he was also part \nSlytherin. He always strives for success and wanted to show how good he \nis in what he does. For Sherlock was solving mysteries like the drugs \nthey had in the muggle world.<br>\u2018John, give me some ingredients.\u2019 Sherlock asked.<br>\u2018Why don\u2019t you do it yourself?\u2019<br>\u2018Because I need to keep this steady. Otherwise it will explode.\u2019<br>John\n sighs, but still walks to the other table for ingredients. He looked \ntrough the window. It was dark outside during this winter. The castle \ngrounds where filled with snow. The moon slowly rises upon the sky. It \nwas a full moon, beautiful, like a silver piece of the universe.<br>Johns\n thoughts where roughly interrupted by a loud scream. Sherlock looked \ndirectly at John. \u2018Murder.\u2019 He said as a small smile appeared on his \nface. Sherlock jumps off his chair and drops everything he had in his \nhands.<br>'Come on John! We got a new mystery!\u2019<br>Sherlock and \nJohn had just left the room, when John heard a pop. The potion was \nexploded and probably left a mess. Snape won\u2019t be happy.</p><p>The two \nlast years ran towards the origin of the scream. It was in one of the \nother dungeons where they found the body. It was a boy with brown hair.<br>\u2018First years, I think. A Ravenclaw.\u2019 John said.<br>\u2018First\n years, I know, he doesn\u2019t have books from the second year in his bag.\u2019 \nSherlock dropped the bag and looked at the boy. The body was full of \nblood and in a horrible condition. From the murderer was no sign.<br>\u2018The\n wounds are about four centimetres deep, but look at his chest.\u2019 John \nsaid. The chest was ripped open. It looked like some kind of animal.<br>\u2018Werewolf.\u2019 Sherlock said. John looks up from the body.<br>\u2018Werewolf?\u2019<br>\u2018Yes, a werewolf, are you deaf.\u2019<br>\u2018How do you know?\u2019<br>\u2018Look\n at the wounds. The most of them are like lines, scratches of a claw. \nThey are four centimetres deep as you mentioned earlier. The scratches \nare at a certain distance from each other. Not more than two \ncentimetres. Spread your fingers and look at them, the distance is not \nvery far from each other, just like these scratches. Besides, Hogwarts \nis extremely secured. Only a teacher or a student could do this, but \nthis looks like an animal. What animal do we know with a human form, or \nbetter, what kind of human has the form of an animal? Yes, the \nwerewolf.\u2019 Sherlock looked at the bleeding body on the ground.<br>\u2018One\n of the students is the werewolf, look again at the distance between the\n scratches. The hands can\u2019t be from an adult. The deepest wounds bend to\n the right, so the Murderer is right-handed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You two, go away!\u2019 Professor McGonagall said as she walked into the dungeon, followed by professor Snape.<br>\u201950 points from Gryffindor and Ravenclaw.\u2019 Snape said full of anger.<br>\u2018What?! Why!\u2019 John said surprised.<br>\u2018Because you two ruined my classroom and are always the first persons at things like this!\u2019<br>John wanted to protest, but he knew it was better not to argue with Snape.<br>\u2018It was a werewolf, I don\u2019t need any thanks.\u2019 Sherlock said when he got up.<br>\u2018Clean my classroom and go to your dormitories.\u2019 Ordered Snape grumpy.</p><p>The\n next day Sherlock and John where in the Great hall with all the other \nstudents. Professor Dumbledore tried to get the students quiet.<br>\u2018A\n student was murdered last night.\u2019 He said. Some students began to \nscream, while others began to talk loudly. Sherlock and John looked at \neach other, this was old news for them.<br>\u2018We don\u2019t know who or what\n did this.\u2019 Dumbledore said, when the room had come to rest again. \nSherlock rolls his eyes, they knew it, he had said it yesterday, but \nthey won\u2019t believe him. Why do they never believe him?!<br>\u2018There is no reason for panic! Professor Lupin and professor Snape will keep an eye out.\u2019<br>Sherlock\n hated it when there where more professors awake at night. It only \nhindered his investigation, but he had to deal with it.<br>Dumbledore\n was still talking, but Sherlock wasn\u2019t listening anymore. He was \nlooking at the other students, observing them. Too young, too tall, too \nsmall, his eyes went from one to the other, but he did not see the \npossible perpetrator so quickly.</p><p>\u2018Sherlock, we need to find the killer, before the next full moon!\u2019 John said when they left the Great hall.<br>\u2018We will find the killer John\u2019 Sherlock looked at his friend.<br>\u2018You saw the body, we can\u2019t let that happen to anyone else.\u2019<br>\u2018I agree.\u2019<br>\u00b4So, are we searching for a first years? They are new, just like this wolf.\u2019<br>They walked to Lupins classroom.<br>\u2018No, it could just as well be a fourth-year student who just has been bitten.\u2019<br>Sherlock held his hands under his chin and thought.<br>\u2018Maybe someone with scars or wounds.. Or someone who is scared of the moon.. someone who can disappear without anyone noticing.\u2019<br>\u2018Maybe a twin?\u2019<br>\u2018Indeed John, a twin!\u2019</p><p>The boys walked into the classroom. Lupin was already talking.<br>\u2018Today\n we repeat the Patronus Charm, because the dementors are coming. They \nheard about the murder and will be on the castle grounds. For your own \nsafety, we repeat this charm.\u2019 Lupin went to Sherlock and John.<br>\u2018Sherlock, can you give an example?\u2019<br>\u2018Of course I can. Expecto patronum.\u2019 A silvery-white otter appeared from Sherlocks wand and dances through the classroom.<br>\u2018Now John.\u2019 Lupin said.<br>\u2018Expecto patronum.\u2019 A small hedgehog appeared from Johns wand. Lupin applauded for the boys.<br>\u2018Well done!\u2019 He said. \u2018Well done, both of you. 10 Points to Gryffindor and Ravenclaw!\u2019</p><p>After class Lupin called Sherlock and John.<br>\u2018I know you two like adventure and mysteries, but stay away from this one.

Am I right professor?\u2019<br>\u2018Yes Sherlock, you are right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are we going to listen to him?\u2019 John asked when they left the classroom.<br>\u2018No.\u2019<br>\u2018So tonight..\u2019<br>\u2018Yes, we will find this wolf. The game is on!\u2019</p><p>That\n same night Sherlock and John were on their way to the dungeons. \nSherlock wanted to see the crime scene again. When they arrived, \nSherlock went straight ahead. He looked at the place where the body was.<br>\u2018Clothes.\u2019 John mentioned.<br>\u2018At\n least a piece of it.\u2019 Sherlock said when he picks it up. \u2018From a new \ncloak. I also saw some hair, long hair so our killer is very likely a \ngirl.\u2019<br>\u2018There are like six girl twins at Hogwarts.\u2019<br>\u2018We go to the Slytherins, maybe they will tell something about their friends.\u2019<br><br>\u2018Sarah and Laurel often come here.\u2019 One of the Slytherins said.<br>\u2018Jade and Amy are my best friends.\u2019 Another one said.

John and Sherlock had new suspects.<br>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 John asks Sherlock.<br>\u2018We need to go to the Hufflepuffs.\u2019</p><p>The\n common room of the Hufflepuffs was very quiet. Everyone was asleep when\n Sherlock and John walked in. Upstairs Sherlock heard a noise. It was \ntalking.. from two people. Why where they awake so late?<br>\u2018John, upstairs, do you hear that?\u2019 Sherlock asked. John listens very carefully.<br>\u2018Girls?

                "content": "<p>(I am not Englisch, so sorry for mistakes)<br /><br />It was just an ordinary day at Hogwarts. Sherlock was brewing some \npotions for an experiment, while John was fascinated by Sherlocks \nknowledge.<br />Sherlock was sorted into Ravenclaw, because he was \nsmart and he loved to study. John was a Gryffindor, he loved adventure \nand he was never afraid. He always follows Sherlock on his adventures, \nat that part he was a bit like a Hufflepuff, always wanted to help \nSherlock.<br />Once they had a mystery which leaded the boys to the \nforbidden forest. Nobody goes there, but John and Sherlock did. Sherlock\n goes often to the forest for some of his experiments. Sometimes John \nand Sherlock walked deep into the forest. Many mysteries had waited for \nthem there. For John was living with Sherlock one big adventure, he \nnever gets bored.<br />Sherlock was a Ravenclaw, but he was also part \nSlytherin. He always strives for success and wanted to show how good he \nis in what he does. For Sherlock was solving mysteries like the drugs \nthey had in the muggle world.<br />&lsquo;John, give me some ingredients.&rsquo; Sherlock asked.<br />&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do it yourself?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Because I need to keep this steady. Otherwise it will explode.&rsquo;<br />John\n sighs, but still walks to the other table for ingredients. He looked \ntrough the window. It was dark outside during this winter. The castle \ngrounds where filled with snow. The moon slowly rises upon the sky. It \nwas a full moon, beautiful, like a silver piece of the universe.<br />Johns\n thoughts where roughly interrupted by a loud scream. Sherlock looked \ndirectly at John. &lsquo;Murder.&rsquo; He said as a small smile appeared on his \nface. Sherlock jumps off his chair and drops everything he had in his \nhands.<br />'Come on John! We got a new mystery!&rsquo;<br />Sherlock and \nJohn had just left the room, when John heard a pop. The potion was \nexploded and probably left a mess. Snape won&rsquo;t be happy.</p><p>The two \nlast years ran towards the origin of the scream. It was in one of the \nother dungeons where they found the body. It was a boy with brown hair.<br />&lsquo;First years, I think. A Ravenclaw.&rsquo; John said.<br />&lsquo;First\n years, I know, he doesn&rsquo;t have books from the second year in his bag.&rsquo; \nSherlock dropped the bag and looked at the boy. The body was full of \nblood and in a horrible condition. From the murderer was no sign.<br />&lsquo;The\n wounds are about four centimetres deep, but look at his chest.&rsquo; John \nsaid. The chest was ripped open. It looked like some kind of animal.<br />&lsquo;Werewolf.&rsquo; Sherlock said. John looks up from the body.<br />&lsquo;Werewolf?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Yes, a werewolf, are you deaf.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Look\n at the wounds. The most of them are like lines, scratches of a claw. \nThey are four centimetres deep as you mentioned earlier. The scratches \nare at a certain distance from each other. Not more than two \ncentimetres. Spread your fingers and look at them, the distance is not \nvery far from each other, just like these scratches. Besides, Hogwarts \nis extremely secured. Only a teacher or a student could do this, but \nthis looks like an animal. What animal do we know with a human form, or \nbetter, what kind of human has the form of an animal? Yes, the \nwerewolf.&rsquo; Sherlock looked at the bleeding body on the ground.<br />&lsquo;One\n of the students is the werewolf, look again at the distance between the\n scratches. The hands can&rsquo;t be from an adult. The deepest wounds bend to\n the right, so the Murderer is right-handed.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You two, go away!&rsquo; Professor McGonagall said as she walked into the dungeon, followed by professor Snape.<br />&rsquo;50 points from Gryffindor and Ravenclaw.&rsquo; Snape said full of anger.<br />&lsquo;What?! Why!&rsquo; John said surprised.<br />&lsquo;Because you two ruined my classroom and are always the first persons at things like this!&rsquo;<br />John wanted to protest, but he knew it was better not to argue with Snape.<br />&lsquo;It was a werewolf, I don&rsquo;t need any thanks.&rsquo; Sherlock said when he got up.<br />&lsquo;Clean my classroom and go to your dormitories.&rsquo; Ordered Snape grumpy.</p><p>The\n next day Sherlock and John where in the Great hall with all the other \nstudents. Professor Dumbledore tried to get the students quiet.<br />&lsquo;A\n student was murdered last night.&rsquo; He said. Some students began to \nscream, while others began to talk loudly. Sherlock and John looked at \neach other, this was old news for them.<br />&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know who or what\n did this.&rsquo; Dumbledore said, when the room had come to rest again. \nSherlock rolls his eyes, they knew it, he had said it yesterday, but \nthey won&rsquo;t believe him. Why do they never believe him?!<br />&lsquo;There is no reason for panic! Professor Lupin and professor Snape will keep an eye out.&rsquo;<br />Sherlock\n hated it when there where more professors awake at night. It only \nhindered his investigation, but he had to deal with it.<br />Dumbledore\n was still talking, but Sherlock wasn&rsquo;t listening anymore. He was \nlooking at the other students, observing them. Too young, too tall, too \nsmall, his eyes went from one to the other, but he did not see the \npossible perpetrator so quickly.</p><p>&lsquo;Sherlock, we need to find the killer, before the next full moon!&rsquo; John said when they left the Great hall.<br />&lsquo;We will find the killer John&rsquo; Sherlock looked at his friend.<br />&lsquo;You saw the body, we can&rsquo;t let that happen to anyone else.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;I agree.&rsquo;<br />&acute;So, are we searching for a first years? They are new, just like this wolf.&rsquo;<br />They walked to Lupins classroom.<br />&lsquo;No, it could just as well be a fourth-year student who just has been bitten.&rsquo;<br />Sherlock held his hands under his chin and thought.<br />&lsquo;Maybe someone with scars or wounds.. Or someone who is scared of the moon.. someone who can disappear without anyone noticing.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Maybe a twin?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Indeed John, a twin!&rsquo;</p><p>The boys walked into the classroom. Lupin was already talking.<br />&lsquo;Today\n we repeat the Patronus Charm, because the dementors are coming. They \nheard about the murder and will be on the castle grounds. For your own \nsafety, we repeat this charm.&rsquo; Lupin went to Sherlock and John.<br />&lsquo;Sherlock, can you give an example?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Of course I can. Expecto patronum.&rsquo; A silvery-white otter appeared from Sherlocks wand and dances through the classroom.<br />&lsquo;Now John.&rsquo; Lupin said.<br />&lsquo;Expecto patronum.&rsquo; A small hedgehog appeared from Johns wand. Lupin applauded for the boys.<br />&lsquo;Well done!&rsquo; He said. &lsquo;Well done, both of you. 10 Points to Gryffindor and Ravenclaw!&rsquo;</p><p>After class Lupin called Sherlock and John.<br />&lsquo;I know you two like adventure and mysteries, but stay away from this one. Werewolves are dangerous.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;You can know, you are one yourself.&rsquo; Sherlock said with a face of steal. Lupin looked surprised at him.<br />&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;So you are the killer?&rsquo; John mentions.<br />&lsquo;No, Snape makes potions for him every month, so he can control himself when he takes one. Am I right professor?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Yes Sherlock, you are right.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Are we going to listen to him?&rsquo; John asked when they left the classroom.<br />&lsquo;No.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;So tonight..&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Yes, we will find this wolf. The game is on!&rsquo;</p><p>That\n same night Sherlock and John were on their way to the dungeons. \nSherlock wanted to see the crime scene again. When they arrived, \nSherlock went straight ahead. He looked at the place where the body was.<br />&lsquo;Clothes.&rsquo; John mentioned.<br />&lsquo;At\n least a piece of it.&rsquo; Sherlock said when he picks it up. &lsquo;From a new \ncloak. I also saw some hair, long hair so our killer is very likely a \ngirl.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;There are like six girl twins at Hogwarts.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;We go to the Slytherins, maybe they will tell something about their friends.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Sarah and Laurel often come here.&rsquo; One of the Slytherins said.<br />&lsquo;Jade and Amy are my best friends.&rsquo; Another one said. Sherlock looked at John. This twin had blind hair.<br />&lsquo;Both of the twins often come here.&rsquo; The last one said. John and Sherlock had new suspects.<br />&lsquo;What do you think?&rsquo; John asks Sherlock.<br />&lsquo;We need to go to the Hufflepuffs.&rsquo;</p><p>The\n common room of the Hufflepuffs was very quiet. Everyone was asleep when\n Sherlock and John walked in. Upstairs Sherlock heard a noise. It was \ntalking.. from two people. Why where they awake so late?<br />&lsquo;John, upstairs, do you hear that?&rsquo; Sherlock asked. John listens very carefully.<br />&lsquo;Girls? Talking?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Grab\n your wand.&rsquo; John grabs his wand and walked upstairs with Sherlock \nbehind him. His wand ready to attack. The door creaked when John \ncarefully opened it. The talking fell silent and the room filled with \nsoft snoring. It was dark, the boys could barely see. John walked into \nthe room with Sherlock right behind him.<br />Sherlock heard someone \ngasp for breath. Alarmed by the sound he turned. Two girls where sitting\n in the corner. One of them was crying.<br />&lsquo;The wolf I suppose.&rsquo; \nSherlock said as he points his wand at the girls. The girls got up, they\n had their wands in their hands. One of them had the wand in the left \nhand, the other in the right.<br />&lsquo;Flipendo!&rsquo; Sherlock was blown back with a tremendous force. The girl ran out of the room, John ran after her.<br />The\n other girls in the room startled awake and started talking. Sherlock \nran trough the door. He ran to a secret passage, his mind says they are \ngoing to the castle grounds.</p><p>Sherlock was right. He got out of the castle at the same time as John and the girl.<br />&lsquo;Jade, stop! We know what you are!&rsquo; The Hufflepuff began to run faster.<br />&lsquo;Petrificus totalus!&rsquo; Sherlock missed the girl barely. &lsquo;Colloshoo.&rsquo; Again he missed. They\n ran further and further. Then suddenly everything went cold. It was \nwinter, so the grounds couldn&rsquo;t freeze any further, but Sherlock knew \nwhat was coming.<br />&lsquo;Dementors?&rsquo; John asked.<br />&lsquo;Obviously.&rsquo;<br />The black shadow appeared for Jade. She started screaming, but felt in silence when the dementor started eating.<br />&lsquo;Expecto\n patronum!&rsquo; John and Sherlock screamed together. The hedgehog and the \notter stormed at the creature that drew backwards. The light was shining\n so bright that it blinded Sherlock and John for a moment. Another \ndementor showed up before Sherlock.<br />&lsquo;Jawn!&rsquo; Sherlock screamed. John pushed Sherlock away from the dark creature.<br />&lsquo;Expecto\n patronum!&rsquo; Sherlock stands and John didn&rsquo;t had to think any longer. He \ngrabbed Jade by her arm and threw her away from the dementor into the \ncastle. Sherlock followed right behind.</p><p>&lsquo;We are alive.&rsquo; John laughs. Sherlock looked at the girl. She was shaking all over her body.<br />&lsquo;You were very stupid, everyone knows there are dementors outside right now!&rsquo; Jade didn&rsquo;t say anything.<br />&lsquo;Here, some chocolate. I had it in my pocket, because of the dementors.&rsquo; John breaks the chocolate and held a piece to Jade.<br />&lsquo;Eat it, you will feel better.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Stop the nonsense John, we got our killer.&rsquo; Jade looked directly at Sherlock.<br />&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt anybody.&rsquo; She started crying. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;You are a werewolf, you know what you did, you talked to your sister about that.&rsquo; John looked from his friend to the girl and back.<br />&lsquo;How did you knew it was her?&rsquo; He asked.<br />&lsquo;She\n has long blond hair, she is a Hufflepuff, the cloak we found was new, \nshe is a last years student, but she got recently a new cloak. In the \ngreat hall she castes her Patronus charm, I noticed it had changed into a\n wolf. Before it was a mastiff. She is right-handed, because she holds \nher wand in the right hand. And she is a twin, so she could easily \ndisappear without anyone noticing. Besides, she has friends in \nSlytherin, so that was her reason for being in the dungeons. She felt \nthere was something wrong, so she ran to the other dungeon where she \nkilled someone.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;How did she became a werewolf?&rsquo; John asked.<br />&lsquo;A\n wolf named Moriary bit me after flying class last week. He said he \nwanted to create panic in the school. Please don&rsquo;t tell anyone.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared only Dumbledore will know about this.&rsquo; John said.<br />&lsquo;Obviously. The rest will kill you if they knew.&rsquo;<br />John gave Sherlock an angry look.<br />'But that won&rsquo;t happen.&rsquo; Sherlock said quickly.</p><p>&lsquo;What are you doing here?!&rsquo; Professor Lupin asked.
