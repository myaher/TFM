It was so much to handle for him on a\nregular basis, the near constant affection that left him so breathless and\nfaint that he honestly felt like he would pass out because of it, all of the touches\nthat left his knees shaking, the kisses that made his heart feel like it was\ngoing to burst out of his chest, those words of endearment that left him choked\nup- it would have been too much for him to deal with coming from just one\nperson, but coming from two people? He truly couldn\u2019t fathom how he survived\nit. </p><p>That\u2019s all thanks to his own\ntimid nature, though; if it wasn\u2019t for that shyness, he wouldn\u2019t have any\nissues at all with the love that he received, but even if it was overwhelming\nat times, he still wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world. You and Mirio made him feel\nsafe, wanted. With the two of you in his corner, with all of the encouragements\nand support that you gave him, he felt like he could conquer the world. You\nhelped to ease his anxieties; you made him realize the strength that had always\nlaid within him. The two of you meant everything to him, so even if his face\nturned crimson with every affectionate word or action, even if he sometimes\nstruggled to properly respond to that affection, he would still do anything for\neither of you. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t just how the two\nof you treated him, either; how you interacted with each other also left his\nheart feeling so full. With as much love you as you showed him, you showed the\nsame amount of love for each other, as well. Every smile that you shared, every\nkiss, every word of support- being able to witness all of it made Tamaki strive\nto do better, to be able to fully reciprocate the love that you showed him and\neach other. He never imagined that he would fall in love with more than one person\nlike this, much less his best friends, but it had happened, and he didn\u2019t\nregret it for a second. </p><p>Of course, the love didn\u2019t\nstop at sweet gestures and words. There was a very passionate and carnal side\nto your relationship, as well, and just thinking about all of the things that\nthe three of you had done turned Tamaki into a blundering mess. The thought of\ndoing anything sexual had made him so nervous at first, but you and Mirio never\npushed him to do anything he wasn\u2019t ready for, always encouraging him and\nletting him move things forward at his own pace. When he finally was ready to\ntake that final enormous leap, your first time together had been so perfect,\nfilled with love and passion as the three of you explored each other\u2019s bodies.\nIt had been a long night, but it was well worth it in the end, and the three of\nyou had hardly been able to keep your hands off each other since then. \u00a0</p><p>Tamaki was already so\nflustered by romantic gestures, but sexual advances had an even greater effect\non him. He was almost embarrassed by how easy it was for you and Mirio to wind\nhim up, but neither of you ever left him wanting for long, all three of you\nalways so eager to please one another. A coy look from you and a confident,\nenticing grin from Mirio was all that it took to get Tamaki in his current\nposition. He was a panting, keening mess as your welcoming heat encased him,\nyour velvet walls fluttering around him as he was forced to thrust into you by\nMirio, who was also getting lost in the feeling of Tamaki\u2019s body as he was\nburied to the hilt inside of him. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time\nthat three of you had been intertwined this way, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be\nthe last. As meek as he had been towards the beginning of the sexual side of\nyour relationship, this was his favorite way to be with both of you. He felt a\nlittle depraved because of it, the debauchery of the situation not lost on him\nat all, but those feelings never lasted for long. Why would he feel dirty or\nembarrassed when he was so close to both of his lovers, trapped in their\nembraces, surrounded by their love, and feeling them both in the most intimate\nway possible? </p><p>It could be a bit\noverwhelming, though. There was just so much for him to focus on, so many\nsensations playing with his body. The softness of your body beneath his hands,\nthe way your lips sloppily locked with his or nibbled and sucked at his neck,\nhow your nails dragged against his back with each hard thrust from Mirio,\nMirio\u2019s strong and comforting hands trailing down his sides, the feeling of\nMirio\u2019s solid muscles pressing against him, how full he felt because of Mirio,\nthe burning heat that consumed him- any of those feelings on their own would\nhave been so much more for him to deal with, but all of them together? </p><p>It was a wonder that he was\neven capable of thought at that point, and if it hadn\u2019t been for Mirio keeping\nhim steady, he surely would have fallen against you already, his body limp from\nthe tidal waves of pleasure that kept crashing against him. The two of you\nalways knew how much he could handle, though, never giving him more than he\ncould bear but getting close enough to it that he was almost in tears because\nof how amazing you made him feel. His body felt so tight, so tense, like he\nwould snap in two at any moment, but the two of you strived to hold him\ntogether, and just as he was reaching the brink of everything being too much\nfor him, your walls seized him in a vice grip, their rhythmic pulsing around\nhim divulging your euphoric bliss. </p><p>The sweetest call of his and\nMirio\u2019s names passed through your lips, that saccharine sound running straight\nthrough Tamaki and causing the tightly coiled bundles of pleasure within him to\nfinally burst. Not even Mirio could hold him up then, his head leaning on your\ncollarbone as his body shook with ecstasy, his choked gasps falling against your\nskin. You held onto him, running your fingers through his hair, your voice\npractically singing as you soothed him through Mirio\u2019s continued movements.\nThat intimate sight was more than enough to send Mirio over the edge, as well,\nhis heart filled with the most wonderful of emotions as every nerve in his body\nkindled with pleasure. </p><p>Tamaki once again found\nhimself tucked in between you and Mirio, although this time you were all laying\ndown together, still lost in the bliss of your union. Gentle touches from both\nof you fluttered around his body, calming him as you both whispered praises to\nhim, telling him how amazing he was and how much you loved him. The ecstasy was\none thing, but afterwards, during the afterglow when both of his lovers\nshowered him with assurances and affection, that was when Tamaki truly felt at\npeace. Any doubts or fears that he had about your relationship were all wiped\naway by the love that flowed between the three of you; you truly completed each\nother, and the bliss, the pure serenity of that, made all of those overwhelming\nfeelings worth it. </p>",

Can I please request a scenario of mirio, tamaki, and Tamaki&rsquo;s fem!so having a threesome?(I feel like sin because it seems that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been requesting) I am curious after reading the nsfw alphabet you wrote for Tamaki.

I also intended for this to be a lot steamier, but&hellip;the fluff just kept writing itself.&nbsp;</b><br /></p><p>Tamaki often wondered how he\nmanaged to survive with two lovers. It was so much to handle for him on a\nregular basis, the near constant affection that left him so breathless and\nfaint that he honestly felt like he would pass out because of it, all of the touches\nthat left his knees shaking, the kisses that made his heart feel like it was\ngoing to burst out of his chest, those words of endearment that left him choked\nup- it would have been too much for him to deal with coming from just one\nperson, but coming from two people? He truly couldn&rsquo;t fathom how he survived\nit. </p><p>That&rsquo;s all thanks to his own\ntimid nature, though; if it wasn&rsquo;t for that shyness, he wouldn&rsquo;t have any\nissues at all with the love that he received, but even if it was overwhelming\nat times, he still wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for the world. You and Mirio made him feel\nsafe, wanted. With the two of you in his corner, with all of the encouragements\nand support that you gave him, he felt like he could conquer the world. You\nhelped to ease his anxieties; you made him realize the strength that had always\nlaid within him. The two of you meant everything to him, so even if his face\nturned crimson with every affectionate word or action, even if he sometimes\nstruggled to properly respond to that affection, he would still do anything for\neither of you. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t just how the two\nof you treated him, either; how you interacted with each other also left his\nheart feeling so full. With as much love you as you showed him, you showed the\nsame amount of love for each other, as well. Every smile that you shared, every\nkiss, every word of support- being able to witness all of it made Tamaki strive\nto do better, to be able to fully reciprocate the love that you showed him and\neach other. He never imagined that he would fall in love with more than one person\nlike this, much less his best friends, but it had happened, and he didn&rsquo;t\nregret it for a second. </p><p>Of course, the love didn&rsquo;t\nstop at sweet gestures and words. There was a very passionate and carnal side\nto your relationship, as well, and just thinking about all of the things that\nthe three of you had done turned Tamaki into a blundering mess. The thought of\ndoing anything sexual had made him so nervous at first, but you and Mirio never\npushed him to do anything he wasn&rsquo;t ready for, always encouraging him and\nletting him move things forward at his own pace. When he finally was ready to\ntake that final enormous leap, your first time together had been so perfect,\nfilled with love and passion as the three of you explored each other&rsquo;s bodies.\nIt had been a long night, but it was well worth it in the end, and the three of\nyou had hardly been able to keep your hands off each other since then. &nbsp;</p><p>Tamaki was already so\nflustered by romantic gestures, but sexual advances had an even greater effect\non him. He was almost embarrassed by how easy it was for you and Mirio to wind\nhim up, but neither of you ever left him wanting for long, all three of you\nalways so eager to please one another. A coy look from you and a confident,\nenticing grin from Mirio was all that it took to get Tamaki in his current\nposition. He was a panting, keening mess as your welcoming heat encased him,\nyour velvet walls fluttering around him as he was forced to thrust into you by\nMirio, who was also getting lost in the feeling of Tamaki&rsquo;s body as he was\nburied to the hilt inside of him. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t the first time\nthat three of you had been intertwined this way, and it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be\nthe last. As meek as he had been towards the beginning of the sexual side of\nyour relationship, this was his favorite way to be with both of you. He felt a\nlittle depraved because of it, the debauchery of the situation not lost on him\nat all, but those feelings never lasted for long. Why would he feel dirty or\nembarrassed when he was so close to both of his lovers, trapped in their\nembraces, surrounded by their love, and feeling them both in the most intimate\nway possible? </p><p>It could be a bit\noverwhelming, though.

        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b> Gigantomachia woke up and started\nninja-running toward Aichi prefecture. Then all of a sudden we cut to Hawks\njust chilling on an Osaka rooftop with a bag. Everyone was like, \u201cwhoa, Hawks,\nwhat are you doing in this arc?\u201d Hawks was all \u201cwell I\u2019ll show you\u201d and then he\nhad a flashback where he <b><i>fucking murdered Best Jeanist</i></b>, probably, and everyone was like \u201cum, hey, <i>what the actual fuck</i>\u201d and Hawks was like\n\u201cwell you asked\u201d and we were all filled with regret for having done so. Back in\nthe Ol\u2019 Villain City, Twice caught up with Tomura and Spinner and they were\nvery happy to see him, and Tomura was like \u201cso anyway we\u2019re almost at Re-Destro\u2019s\ntower and I can\u2019t wait to fucking kill that guy\u201d and the others agreed but they\nalso worried that Tomura was too exhausted to keep this up much longer, and so\nTwice went on ahead to try and finish off RD on his own. The chapter ended up\nwith Twice #241762-D arriving at the top of the tower to confront RD and rescue\nmy boyfriend Giran.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Twice creates some clones of Tomura\nand the gang to help him out. Re-Destro then insta-kills one of the clones and\ntells Twice that he\u2019ll kill Giran if Twice uses his quirk any more. He then makes his arm go all big and he just\nfuckin\u2019&hellip;\u00a0<i>[gestures wildly] WHIPASH!!\u00a0</i>and just smacks them all to death,\nand then he goes over to where Giran is and gets ready to kill him while he and\nTwice are having a moment. Thankfully the not-quite-dead-yet Tomura clone\nintervenes, and as he fights him, Re-Destro launches into a big villain\nmonologue about the Mother of Quirks, a.k.a. the mother of the first\nsuperpowered child to ever be born. Long story short, that baby grew up to be\nDestro, and his mom was all \u201cplease be kind to him and let him live in peace!\u201d\nand so they fucking killed her because people are terrible.

Then all of a sudden we cut to Hawks\njust chilling on an Osaka rooftop with a bag. Everyone was like, \u201cwhoa, Hawks,\nwhat are you doing in this arc?\u201d Hawks was all \u201cwell I\u2019ll show you\u201d and then he\nhad a flashback where he <b><i>fucking murdered Best Jeanist</i></b>, probably, and everyone was like \u201cum, hey, <i>what the actual fuck</i>\u201d and Hawks was like\n\u201cwell you asked\u201d and we were all filled with regret for having done so. Back in\nthe Ol\u2019 Villain City, Twice caught up with Tomura and Spinner and they were\nvery happy to see him, and Tomura was like \u201cso anyway we\u2019re almost at Re-Destro\u2019s\ntower and I can\u2019t wait to fucking kill that guy\u201d and the others agreed but they\nalso worried that Tomura was too exhausted to keep this up much longer, and so\nTwice went on ahead to try and finish off RD on his own. The chapter ended up\nwith Twice #241762-D arriving at the top of the tower to confront RD and rescue\nmy boyfriend Giran.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Twice creates some clones of Tomura\nand the gang to help him out. Re-Destro then insta-kills one of the clones and\ntells Twice that he\u2019ll kill Giran if Twice uses his quirk any more. He then makes his arm go all big and he just\nfuckin\u2019\u2026\u00a0<i>[gestures wildly] WHIPASH!!\u00a0</i>and just smacks them all to death,\nand then he goes over to where Giran is and gets ready to kill him while he and\nTwice are having a moment. Thankfully the not-quite-dead-yet Tomura clone\nintervenes, and as he fights him, Re-Destro launches into a big villain\nmonologue about the Mother of Quirks, a.k.a. the mother of the first\nsuperpowered child to ever be born. Long story short, that baby grew up to be\nDestro, and his mom was all \u201cplease be kind to him and let him live in peace!\u201d\nand so they fucking killed her because people are terrible. As RD is wrapping\nup his story and about to kill the clone Tomura, the real one reaches the tower\nand is all, \u201c<i>TOUCH!!!</i>\u201d This is the single most badass thing anyone has\never done, and the chapter ends with a wobbly Tomura confusedly interrogating\nan enraged Re-Destro while \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d by Queen plays in the background\nomfg.</p><p><br></p><p>(All comments are my unspoiled reactions from my initial readthrough of the chapter.

Then all of a sudden we cut to Hawks\njust chilling on an Osaka rooftop with a bag. Everyone was like, &ldquo;whoa, Hawks,\nwhat are you doing in this arc?&rdquo; Hawks was all &ldquo;well I&rsquo;ll show you&rdquo; and then he\nhad a flashback where he <b><i>fucking murdered Best Jeanist</i></b>, probably, and everyone was like &ldquo;um, hey, <i>what the actual fuck</i>&rdquo; and Hawks was like\n&ldquo;well you asked&rdquo; and we were all filled with regret for having done so. Back in\nthe Ol&rsquo; Villain City, Twice caught up with Tomura and Spinner and they were\nvery happy to see him, and Tomura was like &ldquo;so anyway we&rsquo;re almost at Re-Destro&rsquo;s\ntower and I can&rsquo;t wait to fucking kill that guy&rdquo; and the others agreed but they\nalso worried that Tomura was too exhausted to keep this up much longer, and so\nTwice went on ahead to try and finish off RD on his own. The chapter ended up\nwith Twice #241762-D arriving at the top of the tower to confront RD and rescue\nmy boyfriend Giran.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Twice creates some clones of Tomura\nand the gang to help him out. Re-Destro then insta-kills one of the clones and\ntells Twice that he&rsquo;ll kill Giran if Twice uses his quirk any more. He then makes his arm go all big and he just\nfuckin&rsquo;&hellip;&nbsp;<i>[gestures wildly] WHIPASH!!&nbsp;</i>and just smacks them all to death,\nand then he goes over to where Giran is and gets ready to kill him while he and\nTwice are having a moment. Thankfully the not-quite-dead-yet Tomura clone\nintervenes, and as he fights him, Re-Destro launches into a big villain\nmonologue about the Mother of Quirks, a.k.a. the mother of the first\nsuperpowered child to ever be born. Long story short, that baby grew up to be\nDestro, and his mom was all &ldquo;please be kind to him and let him live in peace!&rdquo;\nand so they fucking killed her because people are terrible. As RD is wrapping\nup his story and about to kill the clone Tomura, the real one reaches the tower\nand is all, &ldquo;<i>TOUCH!!!</i>&rdquo; This is the single most badass thing anyone has\never done, and the chapter ends with a wobbly Tomura confusedly interrogating\nan enraged Re-Destro while &ldquo;We Will Rock You&rdquo; by Queen plays in the background\nomfg.</p><p><br /></p><p>(All comments are my unspoiled reactions from my initial readthrough of the chapter.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b> Gigantomachia woke up and started\nninja-running toward Aichi prefecture. Then all of a sudden we cut to Hawks\njust chilling on an Osaka rooftop with a bag. Everyone was like, &ldquo;whoa, Hawks,\nwhat are you doing in this arc?&rdquo; Hawks was all &ldquo;well I&rsquo;ll show you&rdquo; and then he\nhad a flashback where he <b><i>fucking murdered Best Jeanist</i></b>, probably, and everyone was like &ldquo;um, hey, <i>what the actual fuck</i>&rdquo; and Hawks was like\n&ldquo;well you asked&rdquo; and we were all filled with regret for having done so. Back in\nthe Ol&rsquo; Villain City, Twice caught up with Tomura and Spinner and they were\nvery happy to see him, and Tomura was like &ldquo;so anyway we&rsquo;re almost at Re-Destro&rsquo;s\ntower and I can&rsquo;t wait to fucking kill that guy&rdquo; and the others agreed but they\nalso worried that Tomura was too exhausted to keep this up much longer, and so\nTwice went on ahead to try and finish off RD on his own. The chapter ended up\nwith Twice #241762-D arriving at the top of the tower to confront RD and rescue\nmy boyfriend Giran.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Twice creates some clones of Tomura\nand the gang to help him out. Re-Destro then insta-kills one of the clones and\ntells Twice that he&rsquo;ll kill Giran if Twice uses his quirk any more. He then makes his arm go all big and he just\nfuckin&rsquo;&hellip;&nbsp;<i>[gestures wildly] WHIPASH!!&nbsp;</i>and just smacks them all to death,\nand then he goes over to where Giran is and gets ready to kill him while he and\nTwice are having a moment. Thankfully the not-quite-dead-yet Tomura clone\nintervenes, and as he fights him, Re-Destro launches into a big villain\nmonologue about the Mother of Quirks, a.k.a. the mother of the first\nsuperpowered child to ever be born. Long story short, that baby grew up to be\nDestro, and his mom was all &ldquo;please be kind to him and let him live in peace!&rdquo;\nand so they fucking killed her because people are terrible. As RD is wrapping\nup his story and about to kill the clone Tomura, the real one reaches the tower\nand is all, &ldquo;<i>TOUCH!!!</i>&rdquo; This is the single most badass thing anyone has\never done, and the chapter ends with a wobbly Tomura confusedly interrogating\nan enraged Re-Destro while &ldquo;We Will Rock You&rdquo; by Queen plays in the background\nomfg.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>(All comments are my unspoiled reactions from my initial readthrough of the chapter. I did a quick edit for grammar and clarity immediately afterward, and added one or two ETAs in the process, but aside from that there are no changes.)</p>\n</p>",
