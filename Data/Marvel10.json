(These gifs better load damn it)</p><p><b>Idea for a story</b></p><p>Oh God don\u2019t do this to me. Okay so I would LOVE to write a story about her in her starting days, when she\u2019s just learning to be a warrior. Being a disciple to all the other Valkyries and just kinda flubbing up on her way. </p><p>After that story I would like to fast forward to the future and now where she\u2019s thinking of retraining some of the younger Asgardian girls to be the new Valkyries, and finally redeeming herself (in her mind) for being the only survivor. </p><p><b>Unpopular Opinion</b></p><p>Idk enough about the fandom and their current opinions other than she\u2019s being shipped with Captain Marvel which&hellip; like cool you know? I don\u2019t really mind if she doesn\u2019t get a love interest though. </p><p><b>Favorite Relationship</b></p><p>I really love her friendship with Thor and Hulk which continues in Endgame. Much enjoy. </p><p><b>Favorite Headcanon</b></p><p>You really out here tryna make me think of headcanons. Hmm&hellip; Okay so I bet when she was still in exile or just in her depression or whatever she would drink herself to sleep and would never fix her hair until *absolutely* necessary. Like she gets up in the morning and walks to the bathroom, MAYBE brushes her teeth, and does a quick survey of her hair. Will it fall out in the immediate future? No? Then it\u2019s staying like that. Yep. </p><p>I love you <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFW1r_GUN74SFMa-wlv8gBQ\">@causeimavirgo</a> !!!! I hope this is acceptable. </p>",

You&rsquo;d all decided to have a girls night out, some of the others having already gone home early. Okoye had matched all of you drink for drink but when she tapped out, you knew it was time to go home too. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! Come on. The car is here.&rdquo; Pepper shouted at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Just give me a minute!&rdquo; </p><p>You pulled your phone out of your bag, scrolling through your phone book until you came across the name you wanted. </p><p>Bucky.</p><p>You knew he was out himself with the guys but you didn&rsquo;t care. You&rsquo;d had enough drink and now was the time to let it out. It was always a back and forth between the pair of you, a few looks here and there, a little flirting, a drunken kiss one night. But nothing ever came of it. </p><p>And you were so in love with him it was ridiculous. You needed to tell him and now felt as good as ever. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re phoning Bucky?&rdquo; Wanda screeched coming up behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Shush!&rdquo; You told her but hearing her screeching brought the other girls over. You didn&rsquo;t want to do this with an audience. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you telling him?&rdquo; Nat asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; No&hellip; I was just&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get some more champagne open in the car!&rdquo; Hope said, giving your arm a squeeze as she tottered back to the car, hearing her say the words &ldquo;horny&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scott better be awake&rdquo; as she went to the car. </p><p>You took a deep breath before pressing the call button. His phone rang a few times but he didn&rsquo;t pick up, instead it went to voicemail and you took a deep breath before you started. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, hi. It&rsquo;s me, I&hellip; I&hellip; Uh. Fuck. You know what forget I called. What was I calling about again? There was something I needed to say&hellip; Oh yeah that&rsquo;s it. Stop with your blue eyes and your hand grabby hair and the smile that you smile because it&rsquo;s doing things to me and no&hellip; You know what. I&rsquo;m over you. Yeah this is my call to say that I&rsquo;m over you because that&rsquo;s what I need to do. Get over you. Oh fuck who am I kidding?&rdquo; You took a deep breath, looking back at the car where Nat&rsquo;s face was pressed up against the window like she was trying to hear what you were saying. You turned back towards your phone, pressing end. </p><p>Or so you thought. </p><p>You walked back to the car and Nat jumped on you before you had a chance to sit down. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you tell him?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No! I told him that I needed to get over him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You did what?&rdquo; Pepper screamed, &ldquo;Y/N you have to tell him. Phone him back, tell him now.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You could always just pounce on him.&rdquo; Hope said, taking another swig of champagne and you laughed because Scott was not going to survive the night with her insatiable thirst. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N. Tell him.&rdquo; Wanda said, touching your arm. </p><p>&ldquo;And what do I say? Oh hey Bucky I know we&rsquo;ve been friends for a while but <b>I&rsquo;m in love with you</b>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah pretty much. Those guys don&rsquo;t have a clue about us. We have to make the first move.&rdquo; Pepper said. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Nat nodded in agreement.</p><p>&ldquo;Practice saying it!&rdquo; Wanda smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes do it!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bucky, <b>I&rsquo;m in love with you. I&rsquo;m in love with you</b>. I love James Buchanan fucking Barnes!&rdquo; You shouted, collapsing into laughter along with the others. </p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</b></p><p>You woke up to the worst headache ever. Your eyes felt glued shut when you tired to open them and when you did, the light streaming through your curtains made you wince. You checked your phone, seeing that the time flashed midday. You had missed so much stuff already, meetings, training, but you didn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>You sent a quick text to the girls: &ldquo;are you all alive?&rdquo; Before getting a reply back from Okoye: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m dying.&rdquo; </p><p>You laughed before quickly scrolling through your phone, seeing that you called Bucky early hours this morning. A one hour phone call&hellip; What was that&hellip;.</p><p>No.</p><p>No no no no no.</p><p>You scrolled down to Pepper&rsquo;s number but it just called out, same with Wanda, Nat&rsquo;s and Hope&rsquo;s. </p><p>You phoned Okoye.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m dying. No scrap that I&rsquo;m dead.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I did something stupid.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We all did&hellip; What was that cocktail? You know T'Challa didn&rsquo;t stop taking the piss out of me once I got in? I&rsquo;m dreading when I do actually get up&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okoye&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I need to get up but the room is still spinning.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think I told Bucky I was in love with him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Finally.&rdquo; She told you.</p><p>&ldquo;What do I do?&rdquo; You asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea. I&rsquo;m not good at this stuff. I can ask Shuri or Nakia? See what they know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Okoye.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it&rsquo;s going to be okay. You never know, it might work out for the best. I need to get up&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You can do it Okoye.&rdquo; You laughed before she swore at you and then hung up. </p><p>You rolled over in bed before flipping your duvet off and heading to the shower. You stayed under the water for ages, letting the hot water wash away the grime from last night. When you finally got out of the shower, you have your mouth a clean with your toothbrush, getting rid of the fuzziness from the alcohol. You felt a little more human after a good clean. </p><p>You got dressed in a pair of oversized shorts that you were pretty sure you&rsquo;d pinched from Bucky and a sweatshirt that probably belonged to Steve. Or Sam. You weren&rsquo;t quite sure. </p><p>Hell it could have been Tony&rsquo;s. </p><p>You tended to pinch their clothes because they were so goddamn comfortable. Pulling on a pair of fuzzy socks you made your way out into the kitchen, seeing Nat sat there, her top half sprawled out on the table. Wanda was massaging her temples, Pepper was nursing a coffee and Hope&hellip; Hope looked pretty damn smug with herself actually. </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so smiley?&rdquo; You asked her. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop talking so loud.&rdquo; Nat groaned. </p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip; Had a good night with Scott that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; She smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;Is there any food?&rdquo; You asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Vis!&rdquo; Wanda called and Vision appeared through the wall, floating to the kitchen. </p><p>&ldquo;Wanda said to wait until you came down Y/N and then I can make you all breakfast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Vision.&rdquo; </p><p>Vision would do anything for Wanda, and that includes making breakfast for everyone when they were hungover. He was a pretty good cook and you could hear eggs being whisked. You knew he&rsquo;d be making pancakes and your mouth watered. You poured some water from the jug into an empty glass and sat down next to Nat, rubbing her back. </p><p>&ldquo;I hate you all.&rdquo; She muttered. </p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Hope asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Because you piled me with drinks.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie.&rdquo; You scoffed, &ldquo;If anything, you were piling us with drinks.&rdquo;</p><p>Vision walked over with a stack of pancakes and you all grabbed a load, piling them up with syrup, fruits, anything you could get your hands on. </p><p>It went down so well.</p><p>Music started blaring through the speakers and you all winced, cursing Tony was he walked in to the kitchen, the guys following in behind him. You noticed T'Challa was also there, Okoye looking a little worse for wear. Shuri laughed as she made her way over to where the food was and sat down beside you, pulling you in to a sideways hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning ladies.&rdquo; Tony said, smiling at each of you. &ldquo;Or maybe that should be good afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Gamora, Nebula and Mantis?&rdquo; Hope asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Already on their mission.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh I hate them.&rdquo; Nat groaned, putting her head back down on the table. </p><p>&ldquo;And Carol?&rdquo; Wanda asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Somewhere&hellip; Not quite sure.&rdquo; Scott said, smiling over at Hope. He looked fucking tired and you let out a snort of laughter, earning a flick from Hope as she lent over to get another pancake. </p><p>&ldquo;She blasted off an hour before we left. Should we call her?&rdquo; Pepper asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Ladies focus. We&rsquo;ve got missions to go over.&rdquo; Tony said, clapping his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Not happening.&rdquo; Wanda said, grabbing another pancake. </p><p>You glanced over briefly to Bucky, who was also looking at you but he turned away when you saw him. Sam looked between the pair of you, offering you a small smile when he looked back at you. </p><p>Oh fuck he knew. </p><p>Which means they all knew.</p><p>Ohhhhh the ground needed to swallow you whole. </p><p>&ldquo;I spoke to Nakia before she disappeared.&rdquo; Okoye said, nudging you so you&rsquo;d look at her. &ldquo;She said that you should talk, be honest with him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I should. Thanks Okoye.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Y/L/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Peter?&rdquo; You asked the teenager who was currently looking at you.</p><p>&ldquo;You have chocolate sauce around your mouth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; You muttered grabbing for a napkin and wiping it away. You heard Nat snicker and you glowered at her. </p><p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s going to be no productivity from them today, maybe we should just&hellip; Have a break?&rdquo; Steve asked, looking at Tony who nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to head back to bed.&rdquo; Nat said, punching Clint in the arm as she went passed him after he laughed at her. </p><p>&ldquo;How much did you all drink last night?&rdquo; Sam asked, taking the seat that Nat just left.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh&hellip; There was the wine, the shots, more shots, more shots, wine, cocktails, shots, more shots and then more cocktails.&rdquo; You replied. </p><p>&ldquo;How are you all still alive?&rdquo; Steve asked, squeezing your shoulder as he grabbed a pancake. </p><p>Ugh you knew that squeeze, he only did that when he was trying to boost your spirits up. </p><p>Did Bucky tell everyone? Or did they hear your message? Oh god you hoped they hadn&rsquo;t all heard&hellip;.</p><p>Bucky sat down opposite you but he hadn&rsquo;t said anything yet. Usually he&rsquo;d have come out with something witty, taking the piss out of you as you slowly died from your hangover but nothing. </p><p>You&rsquo;d ruined your friendship. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Sam put his arm around you, tugging you into a hug like he could sense your mood change. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay sunshine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We all heard the message.&rdquo; He whispered in your ear and you groaned because thats what you were afraid of. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an idiot if it doesn&rsquo;t get reciprocated you know that.&rdquo; </p><p>He kissed the side of your head and you nodded before getting up from your chair and mumbling something about going back to bed. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t get very far before you felt a hand on your arm and you turned, seeing Bucky behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo; He said and oh he was so fucking serious. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; Uh&hellip; Did you want to go to the lounge?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and you followed him, folding your arms across your chest. You sat down on the sofa, quite a way from him and you pulled your legs up to your chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I got your message last night. I didn&rsquo;t know what was in it and it got played on loud speaker on the way back to the tower and everyone heard. Sweetheart, what you said&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you just&hellip; Just pretend that you didn&rsquo;t hear it? Make fun of me for being hungover and annoy the hell out of me like you usually do?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No. Because what you said&hellip; Sweetheart I&rsquo;ve been going over it all night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to turn me down. I get it. Just&hellip; Please, can we have this conversation when I&rsquo;m not feeling like the ground needs to swallow me whole? <b>Just please be my best friend right now, and not the guy I just confessed my love to.&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N. I&rsquo;m not going to do that. This is serious. How long? How long have you been in love with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three years.&rdquo; You muttered, playing with the hem of the shorts you had on. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; You&rsquo;ve been here almost four years.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah I know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Y/N. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me sooner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t know how and when to bring it up. But last night. I don&rsquo;t know, too much alcohol and I kept seeing all these couples in the club making out and I kept thinking that I wanted that with you and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m with Kacey.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know. I know and I&rsquo;m sorry but I just&hellip; It kills me to see you with her all the time and&hellip;&rdquo; You wiped the tears away from your eyes, not really wanting to cry because this wasn&rsquo;t making your hangover any better. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with you Bucky. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to stop anytime soon.&rdquo; You whispered.</p><p>He moved towards you, his hands on your cheeks, rubbing his thumb&rsquo;s on your cheeks and wiping away the tears in the process. His metal hand was so soothing against you skin. He looked at you; eyes scanning your face, taking in your appearance and his heart swelled. </p><p>Because he&rsquo;d wanted to hear those words from you for so long but he didn&rsquo;t know if you ever felt the same way. </p><p>But he was in a stable relationship with Kacey now and she was fun and kind and pretty and so sweet. </p><p>But there was you. The girl who teased him and shared private jokes with him. The girl who&rsquo;d seen him at his worst and held him when the nightmares took over, the girl whose smile always cheered him up, whose laugh was always the first thing he wanted to hear when he woke up. </p><p>He needed to sort things out and quickly. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Buck?&rdquo; </p><p>He leaned in to kiss you softly, moaning at the feel of your lips. They were salty from your tears but fuck if they didn&rsquo;t taste how he always imagined them too. You kissed him back, loving the feeling too. You held onto his wrists, not trusting yourself to touch him because you were afraid you would stop if you did. </p><p>He pulled away far too soon. </p><p>&ldquo;Will you give me some time to figure stuff out? I know how bad that sounds but&hellip; I&rsquo;ve wanted to hear those words for so long and then I gave up hope and Kacey&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; Yeah sure. Take your time.&rdquo; You whispered. </p><p>He kissed your forehead, his lips lingering there for a while before he left. </p><p>You had no idea how long he&rsquo;d need but you hoped it wouldn&rsquo;t be too long. </p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</b></p><p>Three weeks later and you hadn&rsquo;t heard from him and you&rsquo;d given up hope. Missions went on as normal, teaming up with Sam with for most of them. </p><p>It was a day off and you were in the kitchen in the towers making a toasted sandwich when Bucky walked in looking like he hadn&rsquo;t slept for weeks. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; You said softly and he looked up to see you stood there, his eyes lighting up  when he saw you. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi. Hi. I was just about to come looking for you and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. Better than fine actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You look tired.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; He said, the small talk between you wasn&rsquo;t going well.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want some food?&rdquo; You asked, motioning to the cheese toastie you had in the machine. </p><p>He nodded and once they were done you pulled out an extra plate, giving him one of the sandwiches. He pulled it apart, letting the cheese cool down before he took a bite. </p><p>It was silent as you ate, the pair of you taking small glances at each other, not quite sure what to say. </p><p>When the silence grew too much you promptly got off from your chair, walking past Bucky as you went to leave. He grabbed your hand, tugging you back to him and pulling you into your lap. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m not with Kacey anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told her. Told her everything. There was screaming and crying and&hellip; Anyway. I&rsquo;m not with her anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; Where have you been?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mission with Steve and Sam. As soon as I came back to tell you, Steve pulled me aside and said we needed to leave quickly. I wanted to talk to you but there wasn&rsquo;t time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that all your going to say?&rdquo; Bucky joked and you let out a small huff of laughter. He put his hand on your cheek, turning your head so you were looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you okay. It&rsquo;s always been you. I wanted it for so long and then nothing happened and&hellip; But you&rsquo;ve always been there. It&rsquo;s you Y/N. Always you.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled, biting your lip as you looked at him. He tilted his head back so he could look at you properly, a small cocky grin on his face. You shifted in his lap so you were straddling him and he took a sharp in take of breath as you pressed against him. </p><p>&ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say what?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What you said on your message.&rdquo; He smirked. </p><p>You ran your hands through his hair, tugging it lightly and you heard him groan. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with you James Buchanan fucking Barnes.&rdquo; </p><p>He lent up to kiss you but you pulled back slightly and he frowned. </p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something that you want to say?&rdquo; You asked, tugging his hair so his neck was exposed to you. You kissed his skin, your tongue flicking his jawline and he growled your name.</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking fuck I&rsquo;m in love with you too Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p>You kissed him harshly, his arms wrapping tightly around you and holding you as close as he could. You moaned into his mouth and he pushed up into you, his hard on evident as you sat in his lap. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fuck each other in my kitchen.&rdquo; Tony said as he walked in, Pepper smirking at you as she walked in behind him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need to fumigate the whole room if you do. Get a room.&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky picked you up, ignoring the cheers from everyone as you walked past them. </p><p>&ldquo;You might not see us for a while.&rdquo; Bucky called back and you laughed out loud as he walked up the stairs and shut the bedroom door behind the pair of you.</p><p><b>Tags: </b>(again not sure who to tag!) <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxVWgHBId01TLR1TUp-m_2A\">@carlya65</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIxtWqRRXW4GJ70OIwAe8dQ\">@wintrcaptn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEs_r1JdqElVe2xBzERms5A\">@justreadingfics</a> </p>",

You\u2019d all decided to have a girls night out, some of the others having already gone home early. Okoye had matched all of you drink for drink but when she tapped out, you knew it was time to go home too. </p><p>\u201cY/N! Come on. The car is here.\u201d Pepper shouted at you.</p><p>\u201cJust give me a minute!\u201d </p><p>You pulled your phone out of your bag, scrolling through your phone book until you came across the name you wanted. </p><p>Bucky.</p><p>You knew he was out himself with the guys but you didn\u2019t care. You\u2019d had enough drink and now was the time to let it out. It was always a back and forth between the pair of you, a few looks here and there, a little flirting, a drunken kiss one night. But nothing ever came of it. </p><p>And you were so in love with him it was ridiculous. You needed to tell him and now felt as good as ever. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re phoning Bucky?\u201d Wanda screeched coming up behind you.</p><p>\u201cShush!\u201d You told her but hearing her screeching brought the other girls over. You didn\u2019t want to do this with an audience. </p><p>\u201cAre you telling him?\u201d Nat asked. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 No\u2026 I was just\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some more champagne open in the car!\u201d Hope said, giving your arm a squeeze as she tottered back to the car, hearing her say the words \u201chorny\u201d and \u201cScott better be awake\u201d as she went to the car. </p><p>You took a deep breath before pressing the call button. His phone rang a few times but he didn\u2019t pick up, instead it went to voicemail and you took a deep breath before you started. </p><p>\u201cHi, hi. It\u2019s me, I\u2026 I\u2026 Uh. Fuck. You know what forget I called. What was I calling about again? There was something I needed to say\u2026 Oh yeah that\u2019s it. Stop with your blue eyes and your hand grabby hair and the smile that you smile because it\u2019s doing things to me and no\u2026 You know what. I\u2019m over you. Yeah this is my call to say that I\u2019m over you because that\u2019s what I need to do. Get over you. Oh fuck who am I kidding?\u201d You took a deep breath, looking back at the car where Nat\u2019s face was pressed up against the window like she was trying to hear what you were saying. You turned back towards your phone, pressing end. </p><p>Or so you thought. </p><p>You walked back to the car and Nat jumped on you before you had a chance to sit down. </p><p>\u201cDid you tell him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo! I told him that I needed to get over him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Pepper screamed, \u201cY/N you have to tell him. Phone him back, tell him now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou could always just pounce on him.\u201d Hope said, taking another swig of champagne and you laughed because Scott was not going to survive the night with her insatiable thirst. </p><p>\u201cY/N. Tell him.\u201d Wanda said, touching your arm. </p><p>\u201cAnd what do I say? Oh hey Bucky I know we\u2019ve been friends for a while but <b>I\u2019m in love with you</b>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah pretty much. Those guys don\u2019t have a clue about us. We have to make the first move.\u201d Pepper said. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Nat nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cPractice saying it!\u201d Wanda smiled. </p><p>\u201cYes do it!\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBucky, <b>I\u2019m in love with you. I\u2019m in love with you</b>. I love James Buchanan fucking Barnes!\u201d You shouted, collapsing into laughter along with the others. </p><p><b>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</b></p><p>You woke up to the worst headache ever. Your eyes felt glued shut when you tired to open them and when you did, the light streaming through your curtains made you wince. You checked your phone, seeing that the time flashed midday. You had missed so much stuff already, meetings, training, but you didn\u2019t care.</p><p>You sent a quick text to the girls: \u201care you all alive?\u201d Before getting a reply back from Okoye: \u201cI think I\u2019m dying.\u201d </p><p>You laughed before quickly scrolling through your phone, seeing that you called Bucky early hours this morning. A one hour phone call\u2026 What was that\u2026.</p><p>No.</p><p>No no no no no.</p><p>You scrolled down to Pepper\u2019s number but it just called out, same with Wanda, Nat\u2019s and Hope\u2019s. </p><p>You phoned Okoye.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m dying. No scrap that I\u2019m dead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did something stupid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe all did\u2026 What was that cocktail? You know T'Challa didn\u2019t stop taking the piss out of me once I got in? I\u2019m dreading when I do actually get up\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkoye\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI need to get up but the room is still spinning.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think I told Bucky I was in love with him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d She told you.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I\u2019m not good at this stuff. I can ask Shuri or Nakia? See what they know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you Okoye.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s going to be okay. You never know, it might work out for the best. I need to get up\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can do it Okoye.\u201d You laughed before she swore at you and then hung up. </p><p>You rolled over in bed before flipping your duvet off and heading to the shower. You stayed under the water for ages, letting the hot water wash away the grime from last night. When you finally got out of the shower, you have your mouth a clean with your toothbrush, getting rid of the fuzziness from the alcohol. You felt a little more human after a good clean. </p><p>You got dressed in a pair of oversized shorts that you were pretty sure you\u2019d pinched from Bucky and a sweatshirt that probably belonged to Steve. Or Sam. You weren\u2019t quite sure. </p><p>Hell it could have been Tony\u2019s. </p><p>You tended to pinch their clothes because they were so goddamn comfortable. Pulling on a pair of fuzzy socks you made your way out into the kitchen, seeing Nat sat there, her top half sprawled out on the table. Wanda was massaging her temples, Pepper was nursing a coffee and Hope\u2026 Hope looked pretty damn smug with herself actually. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you so smiley?\u201d You asked her. </p><p>\u201cStop talking so loud.\u201d Nat groaned. </p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 Had a good night with Scott that\u2019s all.\u201d She smirked. </p><p>\u201cIs there any food?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\u201cVis!\u201d Wanda called and Vision appeared through the wall, floating to the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cWanda said to wait until you came down Y/N and then I can make you all breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Vision.\u201d </p><p>Vision would do anything for Wanda, and that includes making breakfast for everyone when they were hungover. He was a pretty good cook and you could hear eggs being whisked. You knew he\u2019d be making pancakes and your mouth watered. You poured some water from the jug into an empty glass and sat down next to Nat, rubbing her back. </p><p>\u201cI hate you all.\u201d She muttered. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Hope asked. </p><p>\u201cBecause you piled me with drinks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d You scoffed, \u201cIf anything, you were piling us with drinks.\u201d</p><p>Vision walked over with a stack of pancakes and you all grabbed a load, piling them up with syrup, fruits, anything you could get your hands on. </p><p>It went down so well.</p><p>Music started blaring through the speakers and you all winced, cursing Tony was he walked in to the kitchen, the guys following in behind him. You noticed T'Challa was also there, Okoye looking a little worse for wear. Shuri laughed as she made her way over to where the food was and sat down beside you, pulling you in to a sideways hug. </p><p>\u201cMorning ladies.\u201d Tony said, smiling at each of you. \u201cOr maybe that should be good afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Gamora, Nebula and Mantis?\u201d Hope asked. </p><p>\u201cAlready on their mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh I hate them.\u201d Nat groaned, putting her head back down on the table. </p><p>\u201cAnd Carol?\u201d Wanda asked. </p><p>\u201cSomewhere\u2026 Not quite sure.\u201d Scott said, smiling over at Hope. He looked fucking tired and you let out a snort of laughter, earning a flick from Hope as she lent over to get another pancake. </p><p>\u201cShe blasted off an hour before we left. Should we call her?\u201d Pepper asked. </p><p>\u201cLadies focus. We\u2019ve got missions to go over.\u201d Tony said, clapping his hands. </p><p>\u201cNot happening.\u201d Wanda said, grabbing another pancake. </p><p>You glanced over briefly to Bucky, who was also looking at you but he turned away when you saw him. Sam looked between the pair of you, offering you a small smile when he looked back at you. </p><p>Oh fuck he knew. </p><p>Which means they all knew.</p><p>Ohhhhh the ground needed to swallow you whole. </p><p>\u201cI spoke to Nakia before she disappeared.\u201d Okoye said, nudging you so you\u2019d look at her. \u201cShe said that you should talk, be honest with him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 I should. Thanks Okoye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Y/L/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes Peter?\u201d You asked the teenager who was currently looking at you.</p><p>\u201cYou have chocolate sauce around your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d You muttered grabbing for a napkin and wiping it away. You heard Nat snicker and you glowered at her. </p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be no productivity from them today, maybe we should just\u2026 Have a break?\u201d Steve asked, looking at Tony who nodded. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head back to bed.\u201d Nat said, punching Clint in the arm as she went passed him after he laughed at her. </p><p>\u201cHow much did you all drink last night?\u201d Sam asked, taking the seat that Nat just left.</p><p>\u201cUhhh\u2026 There was the wine, the shots, more shots, more shots, wine, cocktails, shots, more shots and then more cocktails.\u201d You replied. </p><p>\u201cHow are you all still alive?\u201d Steve asked, squeezing your shoulder as he grabbed a pancake. </p><p>Ugh you knew that squeeze, he only did that when he was trying to boost your spirits up. </p><p>Did Bucky tell everyone? Or did they hear your message? Oh god you hoped they hadn\u2019t all heard\u2026.</p><p>Bucky sat down opposite you but he hadn\u2019t said anything yet. Usually he\u2019d have come out with something witty, taking the piss out of you as you slowly died from your hangover but nothing. </p><p>You\u2019d ruined your friendship. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Sam put his arm around you, tugging you into a hug like he could sense your mood change. </p><p>\u201cYou okay sunshine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe all heard the message.\u201d He whispered in your ear and you groaned because thats what you were afraid of. \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot if it doesn\u2019t get reciprocated you know that.\u201d </p><p>He kissed the side of your head and you nodded before getting up from your chair and mumbling something about going back to bed. </p><p>You didn\u2019t get very far before you felt a hand on your arm and you turned, seeing Bucky behind you.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d He said and oh he was so fucking serious. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 Uh\u2026 Did you want to go to the lounge?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and you followed him, folding your arms across your chest. You sat down on the sofa, quite a way from him and you pulled your legs up to your chest. </p><p>\u201cI got your message last night. I didn\u2019t know what was in it and it got played on loud speaker on the way back to the tower and everyone heard. Sweetheart, what you said\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you just\u2026 Just pretend that you didn\u2019t hear it? Make fun of me for being hungover and annoy the hell out of me like you usually do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo. Because what you said\u2026 Sweetheart I\u2019ve been going over it all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to turn me down. I get it. Just\u2026 Please, can we have this conversation when I\u2019m not feeling like the ground needs to swallow me whole? <b>Just please be my best friend right now, and not the guy I just confessed my love to.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cY/N. I\u2019m not going to do that. This is serious. How long? How long have you been in love with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years.\u201d You muttered, playing with the hem of the shorts you had on. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 You\u2019ve been here almost four years.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah I know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N. Why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know how and when to bring it up. But last night. I don\u2019t know, too much alcohol and I kept seeing all these couples in the club making out and I kept thinking that I wanted that with you and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m with Kacey.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know. I know and I\u2019m sorry but I just\u2026 It kills me to see you with her all the time and\u2026\u201d You wiped the tears away from your eyes, not really wanting to cry because this wasn\u2019t making your hangover any better. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you Bucky. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to stop anytime soon.\u201d You whispered.</p><p>He moved towards you, his hands on your cheeks, rubbing his thumb\u2019s on your cheeks and wiping away the tears in the process. His metal hand was so soothing against you skin. He looked at you; eyes scanning your face, taking in your appearance and his heart swelled. </p><p>Because he\u2019d wanted to hear those words from you for so long but he didn\u2019t know if you ever felt the same way. </p><p>But he was in a stable relationship with Kacey now and she was fun and kind and pretty and so sweet. </p><p>But there was you. The girl who teased him and shared private jokes with him. The girl who\u2019d seen him at his worst and held him when the nightmares took over, the girl whose smile always cheered him up, whose laugh was always the first thing he wanted to hear when he woke up. </p><p>He needed to sort things out and quickly. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck?\u201d </p><p>He leaned in to kiss you softly, moaning at the feel of your lips. They were salty from your tears but fuck if they didn\u2019t taste how he always imagined them too. You kissed him back, loving the feeling too. You held onto his wrists, not trusting yourself to touch him because you were afraid you would stop if you did. </p><p>He pulled away far too soon. </p><p>\u201cWill you give me some time to figure stuff out? I know how bad that sounds but\u2026 I\u2019ve wanted to hear those words for so long and then I gave up hope and Kacey\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah sure. Take your time.\u201d You whispered. </p><p>He kissed your forehead, his lips lingering there for a while before he left. </p><p>You had no idea how long he\u2019d need but you hoped it wouldn\u2019t be too long. </p><p><b>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</b></p><p>Three weeks later and you hadn\u2019t heard from him and you\u2019d given up hope. Missions went on as normal, teaming up with Sam with for most of them. </p><p>It was a day off and you were in the kitchen in the towers making a toasted sandwich when Bucky walked in looking like he hadn\u2019t slept for weeks. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d You said softly and he looked up to see you stood there, his eyes lighting up  when he saw you. </p><p>\u201cHi. Hi. I was just about to come looking for you and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Better than fine actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He said, the small talk between you wasn\u2019t going well.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some food?\u201d You asked, motioning to the cheese toastie you had in the machine. </p><p>He nodded and once they were done you pulled out an extra plate, giving him one of the sandwiches. He pulled it apart, letting the cheese cool down before he took a bite. </p><p>It was silent as you ate, the pair of you taking small glances at each other, not quite sure what to say. </p><p>When the silence grew too much you promptly got off from your chair, walking past Bucky as you went to leave. He grabbed your hand, tugging you back to him and pulling you into your lap. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not with Kacey anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her. Told her everything. There was screaming and crying and\u2026 Anyway. I\u2019m not with her anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMission with Steve and Sam. As soon as I came back to tell you, Steve pulled me aside and said we needed to leave quickly. I wanted to talk to you but there wasn\u2019t time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all your going to say?\u201d Bucky joked and you let out a small huff of laughter. He put his hand on your cheek, turning your head so you were looking at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you okay. It\u2019s always been you. I wanted it for so long and then nothing happened and\u2026 But you\u2019ve always been there. It\u2019s you Y/N. Always you.\u201d</p><p>You smiled, biting your lip as you looked at him. He tilted his head back so he could look at you properly, a small cocky grin on his face. You shifted in his lap so you were straddling him and he took a sharp in take of breath as you pressed against him. </p><p>\u201cYou mean that?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat you said on your message.\u201d He smirked. </p><p>You ran your hands through his hair, tugging it lightly and you heard him groan. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you James Buchanan fucking Barnes.\u201d </p><p>He lent up to kiss you but you pulled back slightly and he frowned. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there something that you want to say?\u201d You asked, tugging his hair so his neck was exposed to you. You kissed his skin, your tongue flicking his jawline and he growled your name.</p><p>\u201cFucking fuck I\u2019m in love with you too Y/N.\u201d </p><p>You kissed him harshly, his arms wrapping tightly around you and holding you as close as he could. You moaned into his mouth and he pushed up into you, his hard on evident as you sat in his lap. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck each other in my kitchen.\u201d Tony said as he walked in, Pepper smirking at you as she walked in behind him. \u201cI\u2019ll need to fumigate the whole room if you do. Get a room.\u201d </p><p>Bucky picked you up, ignoring the cheers from everyone as you walked past them. </p><p>\u201cYou might not see us for a while.\u201d Bucky called back and you laughed out loud as he walked up the stairs and shut the bedroom door behind the pair of you.</p><p><b>Tags: </b>(again not sure who to tag!) <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxVWgHBId01TLR1TUp-m_2A\">@carlya65</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIxtWqRRXW4GJ70OIwAe8dQ\">@wintrcaptn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEs_r1JdqElVe2xBzERms5A\">@justreadingfics</a> </p></p>",

You\u2019d all decided to have a girls night out, some of the others having already gone home early. Okoye had matched all of you drink for drink but when she tapped out, you knew it was time to go home too. </p><p>\u201cY/N! Come on. The car is here.\u201d Pepper shouted at you.</p><p>\u201cJust give me a minute!\u201d </p><p>You pulled your phone out of your bag, scrolling through your phone book until you came across the name you wanted. </p><p>Bucky.</p><p>You knew he was out himself with the guys but you didn\u2019t care. You\u2019d had enough drink and now was the time to let it out. It was always a back and forth between the pair of you, a few looks here and there, a little flirting, a drunken kiss one night. But nothing ever came of it. </p><p>And you were so in love with him it was ridiculous. You needed to tell him and now felt as good as ever. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re phoning Bucky?\u201d Wanda screeched coming up behind you.</p><p>\u201cShush!\u201d You told her but hearing her screeching brought the other girls over. You didn\u2019t want to do this with an audience. </p><p>\u201cAre you telling him?\u201d Nat asked. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 No\u2026 I was just\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some more champagne open in the car!\u201d Hope said, giving your arm a squeeze as she tottered back to the car, hearing her say the words \u201chorny\u201d and \u201cScott better be awake\u201d as she went to the car. </p><p>You took a deep breath before pressing the call button. His phone rang a few times but he didn\u2019t pick up, instead it went to voicemail and you took a deep breath before you started. </p><p>\u201cHi, hi. It\u2019s me, I\u2026 I\u2026 Uh. Fuck. You know what forget I called. What was I calling about again? There was something I needed to say\u2026 Oh yeah that\u2019s it. Stop with your blue eyes and your hand grabby hair and the smile that you smile because it\u2019s doing things to me and no\u2026 You know what. I\u2019m over you. Yeah this is my call to say that I\u2019m over you because that\u2019s what I need to do. Get over you. Oh fuck who am I kidding?\u201d You took a deep breath, looking back at the car where Nat\u2019s face was pressed up against the window like she was trying to hear what you were saying. You turned back towards your phone, pressing end. </p><p>Or so you thought. </p><p>You walked back to the car and Nat jumped on you before you had a chance to sit down. </p><p>\u201cDid you tell him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo! I told him that I needed to get over him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Pepper screamed, \u201cY/N you have to tell him. Phone him back, tell him now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou could always just pounce on him.\u201d Hope said, taking another swig of champagne and you laughed because Scott was not going to survive the night with her insatiable thirst. </p><p>\u201cY/N. Tell him.\u201d Wanda said, touching your arm. </p><p>\u201cAnd what do I say? Oh hey Bucky I know we\u2019ve been friends for a while but <b>I\u2019m in love with you</b>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah pretty much. Those guys don\u2019t have a clue about us. We have to make the first move.\u201d Pepper said. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Nat nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cPractice saying it!\u201d Wanda smiled. </p><p>\u201cYes do it!\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBucky, <b>I\u2019m in love with you. I\u2019m in love with you</b>. I love James Buchanan fucking Barnes!\u201d You shouted, collapsing into laughter along with the others. </p><p><b>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</b></p><p>You woke up to the worst headache ever. Your eyes felt glued shut when you tired to open them and when you did, the light streaming through your curtains made you wince. You checked your phone, seeing that the time flashed midday. You had missed so much stuff already, meetings, training, but you didn\u2019t care.</p><p>You sent a quick text to the girls: \u201care you all alive?\u201d Before getting a reply back from Okoye: \u201cI think I\u2019m dying.\u201d </p><p>You laughed before quickly scrolling through your phone, seeing that you called Bucky early hours this morning. A one hour phone call\u2026 What was that\u2026.</p><p>No.</p><p>No no no no no.</p><p>You scrolled down to Pepper\u2019s number but it just called out, same with Wanda, Nat\u2019s and Hope\u2019s. </p><p>You phoned Okoye.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m dying. No scrap that I\u2019m dead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did something stupid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe all did\u2026 What was that cocktail? You know T'Challa didn\u2019t stop taking the piss out of me once I got in? I\u2019m dreading when I do actually get up\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkoye\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI need to get up but the room is still spinning.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think I told Bucky I was in love with him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d She told you.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I\u2019m not good at this stuff. I can ask Shuri or Nakia? See what they know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you Okoye.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s going to be okay. You never know, it might work out for the best. I need to get up\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can do it Okoye.\u201d You laughed before she swore at you and then hung up. </p><p>You rolled over in bed before flipping your duvet off and heading to the shower. You stayed under the water for ages, letting the hot water wash away the grime from last night. When you finally got out of the shower, you have your mouth a clean with your toothbrush, getting rid of the fuzziness from the alcohol. You felt a little more human after a good clean. </p><p>You got dressed in a pair of oversized shorts that you were pretty sure you\u2019d pinched from Bucky and a sweatshirt that probably belonged to Steve. Or Sam. You weren\u2019t quite sure. </p><p>Hell it could have been Tony\u2019s. </p><p>You tended to pinch their clothes because they were so goddamn comfortable. Pulling on a pair of fuzzy socks you made your way out into the kitchen, seeing Nat sat there, her top half sprawled out on the table. Wanda was massaging her temples, Pepper was nursing a coffee and Hope\u2026 Hope looked pretty damn smug with herself actually. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you so smiley?\u201d You asked her. </p><p>\u201cStop talking so loud.\u201d Nat groaned. </p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 Had a good night with Scott that\u2019s all.\u201d She smirked. </p><p>\u201cIs there any food?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\u201cVis!\u201d Wanda called and Vision appeared through the wall, floating to the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cWanda said to wait until you came down Y/N and then I can make you all breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Vision.\u201d </p><p>Vision would do anything for Wanda, and that includes making breakfast for everyone when they were hungover. He was a pretty good cook and you could hear eggs being whisked. You knew he\u2019d be making pancakes and your mouth watered. You poured some water from the jug into an empty glass and sat down next to Nat, rubbing her back. </p><p>\u201cI hate you all.\u201d She muttered. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Hope asked. </p><p>\u201cBecause you piled me with drinks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d You scoffed, \u201cIf anything, you were piling us with drinks.\u201d</p><p>Vision walked over with a stack of pancakes and you all grabbed a load, piling them up with syrup, fruits, anything you could get your hands on. </p><p>It went down so well.</p><p>Music started blaring through the speakers and you all winced, cursing Tony was he walked in to the kitchen, the guys following in behind him. You noticed T'Challa was also there, Okoye looking a little worse for wear. Shuri laughed as she made her way over to where the food was and sat down beside you, pulling you in to a sideways hug. </p><p>\u201cMorning ladies.\u201d Tony said, smiling at each of you. \u201cOr maybe that should be good afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Gamora, Nebula and Mantis?\u201d Hope asked. </p><p>\u201cAlready on their mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh I hate them.\u201d Nat groaned, putting her head back down on the table. </p><p>\u201cAnd Carol?\u201d Wanda asked. </p><p>\u201cSomewhere\u2026 Not quite sure.\u201d Scott said, smiling over at Hope. He looked fucking tired and you let out a snort of laughter, earning a flick from Hope as she lent over to get another pancake. </p><p>\u201cShe blasted off an hour before we left. Should we call her?\u201d Pepper asked. </p><p>\u201cLadies focus. We\u2019ve got missions to go over.\u201d Tony said, clapping his hands. </p><p>\u201cNot happening.\u201d Wanda said, grabbing another pancake. </p><p>You glanced over briefly to Bucky, who was also looking at you but he turned away when you saw him. Sam looked between the pair of you, offering you a small smile when he looked back at you. </p><p>Oh fuck he knew. </p><p>Which means they all knew.</p><p>Ohhhhh the ground needed to swallow you whole. </p><p>\u201cI spoke to Nakia before she disappeared.\u201d Okoye said, nudging you so you\u2019d look at her. \u201cShe said that you should talk, be honest with him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 I should. Thanks Okoye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Y/L/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes Peter?\u201d You asked the teenager who was currently looking at you.</p><p>\u201cYou have chocolate sauce around your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d You muttered grabbing for a napkin and wiping it away. You heard Nat snicker and you glowered at her. </p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be no productivity from them today, maybe we should just\u2026 Have a break?\u201d Steve asked, looking at Tony who nodded. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head back to bed.\u201d Nat said, punching Clint in the arm as she went passed him after he laughed at her. </p><p>\u201cHow much did you all drink last night?\u201d Sam asked, taking the seat that Nat just left.</p><p>\u201cUhhh\u2026 There was the wine, the shots, more shots, more shots, wine, cocktails, shots, more shots and then more cocktails.\u201d You replied. </p><p>\u201cHow are you all still alive?\u201d Steve asked, squeezing your shoulder as he grabbed a pancake. </p><p>Ugh you knew that squeeze, he only did that when he was trying to boost your spirits up. </p><p>Did Bucky tell everyone? Or did they hear your message? Oh god you hoped they hadn\u2019t all heard\u2026.</p><p>Bucky sat down opposite you but he hadn\u2019t said anything yet. Usually he\u2019d have come out with something witty, taking the piss out of you as you slowly died from your hangover but nothing. </p><p>You\u2019d ruined your friendship. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Sam put his arm around you, tugging you into a hug like he could sense your mood change. </p><p>\u201cYou okay sunshine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe all heard the message.\u201d He whispered in your ear and you groaned because thats what you were afraid of. \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot if it doesn\u2019t get reciprocated you know that.\u201d </p><p>He kissed the side of your head and you nodded before getting up from your chair and mumbling something about going back to bed. </p><p>You didn\u2019t get very far before you felt a hand on your arm and you turned, seeing Bucky behind you.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d He said and oh he was so fucking serious. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 Uh\u2026 Did you want to go to the lounge?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and you followed him, folding your arms across your chest. You sat down on the sofa, quite a way from him and you pulled your legs up to your chest. </p><p>\u201cI got your message last night. I didn\u2019t know what was in it and it got played on loud speaker on the way back to the tower and everyone heard. Sweetheart, what you said\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you just\u2026 Just pretend that you didn\u2019t hear it? Make fun of me for being hungover and annoy the hell out of me like you usually do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo. Because what you said\u2026 Sweetheart I\u2019ve been going over it all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to turn me down. I get it. Just\u2026 Please, can we have this conversation when I\u2019m not feeling like the ground needs to swallow me whole? <b>Just please be my best friend right now, and not the guy I just confessed my love to.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cY/N. I\u2019m not going to do that. This is serious. How long? How long have you been in love with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years.\u201d You muttered, playing with the hem of the shorts you had on. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 You\u2019ve been here almost four years.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah I know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N. Why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know how and when to bring it up. But last night.

I know and I\u2019m sorry but I just\u2026 It kills me to see you with her all the time and\u2026\u201d You wiped the tears away from your eyes, not really wanting to cry because this wasn\u2019t making your hangover any better. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you Bucky. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to stop anytime soon.\u201d You whispered.</p><p>He moved towards you, his hands on your cheeks, rubbing his thumb\u2019s on your cheeks and wiping away the tears in the process. His metal hand was so soothing against you skin. He looked at you; eyes scanning your face, taking in your appearance and his heart swelled. </p><p>Because he\u2019d wanted to hear those words from you for so long but he didn\u2019t know if you ever felt the same way. </p><p>But he was in a stable relationship with Kacey now and she was fun and kind and pretty and so sweet. </p><p>But there was you. The girl who teased him and shared private jokes with him. The girl who\u2019d seen him at his worst and held him when the nightmares took over, the girl whose smile always cheered him up, whose laugh was always the first thing he wanted to hear when he woke up. </p><p>He needed to sort things out and quickly. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck?\u201d </p><p>He leaned in to kiss you softly, moaning at the feel of your lips. They were salty from your tears but fuck if they didn\u2019t taste how he always imagined them too. You kissed him back, loving the feeling too. You held onto his wrists, not trusting yourself to touch him because you were afraid you would stop if you did. </p><p>He pulled away far too soon. </p><p>\u201cWill you give me some time to figure stuff out? I know how bad that sounds but\u2026 I\u2019ve wanted to hear those words for so long and then I gave up hope and Kacey\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah sure. Take your time.\u201d You whispered. </p><p>He kissed your forehead, his lips lingering there for a while before he left. </p><p>You had no idea how long he\u2019d need but you hoped it wouldn\u2019t be too long. </p><p><b>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</b></p><p>Three weeks later and you hadn\u2019t heard from him and you\u2019d given up hope. Missions went on as normal, teaming up with Sam with for most of them. </p><p>It was a day off and you were in the kitchen in the towers making a toasted sandwich when Bucky walked in looking like he hadn\u2019t slept for weeks. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d You said softly and he looked up to see you stood there, his eyes lighting up  when he saw you. </p><p>\u201cHi. Hi. I was just about to come looking for you and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Better than fine actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He said, the small talk between you wasn\u2019t going well.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some food?\u201d You asked, motioning to the cheese toastie you had in the machine. </p><p>He nodded and once they were done you pulled out an extra plate, giving him one of the sandwiches. He pulled it apart, letting the cheese cool down before he took a bite. </p><p>It was silent as you ate, the pair of you taking small glances at each other, not quite sure what to say. </p><p>When the silence grew too much you promptly got off from your chair, walking past Bucky as you went to leave. He grabbed your hand, tugging you back to him and pulling you into your lap. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not with Kacey anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her.

He put his hand on your cheek, turning your head so you were looking at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you okay. It\u2019s always been you. I wanted it for so long and then nothing happened and\u2026 But you\u2019ve always been there. It\u2019s you Y/N. Always you.\u201d</p><p>You smiled, biting your lip as you looked at him. He tilted his head back so he could look at you properly, a small cocky grin on his face. You shifted in his lap so you were straddling him and he took a sharp in take of breath as you pressed against him. </p><p>\u201cYou mean that?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat you said on your message.\u201d He smirked. </p><p>You ran your hands through his hair, tugging it lightly and you heard him groan. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you James Buchanan fucking Barnes.\u201d </p><p>He lent up to kiss you but you pulled back slightly and he frowned. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there something that you want to say?\u201d You asked, tugging his hair so his neck was exposed to you. You kissed his skin, your tongue flicking his jawline and he growled your name.</p><p>\u201cFucking fuck I\u2019m in love with you too Y/N.\u201d </p><p>You kissed him harshly, his arms wrapping tightly around you and holding you as close as he could.

Get a room.\u201d </p><p>Bucky picked you up, ignoring the cheers from everyone as you walked past them. </p><p>\u201cYou might not see us for a while.\u201d Bucky called back and you laughed out loud as he walked up the stairs and shut the bedroom door behind the pair of you.</p><p><b>Tags: </b>(again not sure who to tag!) <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxVWgHBId01TLR1TUp-m_2A\">@carlya65</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIxtWqRRXW4GJ70OIwAe8dQ\">@wintrcaptn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEs_r1JdqElVe2xBzERms5A\">@justreadingfics</a> </p></p>",

I&rsquo;m so sorry with how long it is haha I just couldn&rsquo;t stop! Hopefully it doesn&rsquo;t suck because I&rsquo;ve never written for Bucky before &#128556; </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>Prompts:</b> <i><span class=\"npf_color_niles\">42. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with you.&rdquo; </span></i></p><p><i><span class=\"npf_color_niles\">19. &ldquo;Just please be my best friend right now, and not the guy I just confessed my love to.&rdquo; </span></i></p><p>You were drunk, giggling your head off as you walked out of the club with Nat, Wanda, Pepper and Hope. You&rsquo;d all decided to have a girls night out, some of the others having already gone home early. Okoye had matched all of you drink for drink but when she tapped out, you knew it was time to go home too. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! Come on. The car is here.&rdquo; Pepper shouted at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Just give me a minute!&rdquo; </p><p>You pulled your phone out of your bag, scrolling through your phone book until you came across the name you wanted. </p><p>Bucky.</p><p>You knew he was out himself with the guys but you didn&rsquo;t care. You&rsquo;d had enough drink and now was the time to let it out. It was always a back and forth between the pair of you, a few looks here and there, a little flirting, a drunken kiss one night. But nothing ever came of it. </p><p>And you were so in love with him it was ridiculous. You needed to tell him and now felt as good as ever. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re phoning Bucky?&rdquo; Wanda screeched coming up behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Shush!&rdquo; You told her but hearing her screeching brought the other girls over. You didn&rsquo;t want to do this with an audience. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you telling him?&rdquo; Nat asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; No&hellip; I was just&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get some more champagne open in the car!&rdquo; Hope said, giving your arm a squeeze as she tottered back to the car, hearing her say the words &ldquo;horny&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scott better be awake&rdquo; as she went to the car. </p><p>You took a deep breath before pressing the call button. His phone rang a few times but he didn&rsquo;t pick up, instead it went to voicemail and you took a deep breath before you started. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, hi. It&rsquo;s me, I&hellip; I&hellip; Uh. Fuck. You know what forget I called. What was I calling about again? There was something I needed to say&hellip; Oh yeah that&rsquo;s it. Stop with your blue eyes and your hand grabby hair and the smile that you smile because it&rsquo;s doing things to me and no&hellip; You know what. I&rsquo;m over you. Yeah this is my call to say that I&rsquo;m over you because that&rsquo;s what I need to do. Get over you. Oh fuck who am I kidding?&rdquo; You took a deep breath, looking back at the car where Nat&rsquo;s face was pressed up against the window like she was trying to hear what you were saying. You turned back towards your phone, pressing end. </p><p>Or so you thought. </p><p>You walked back to the car and Nat jumped on you before you had a chance to sit down. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you tell him?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No! I told him that I needed to get over him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You did what?&rdquo; Pepper screamed, &ldquo;Y/N you have to tell him. Phone him back, tell him now.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You could always just pounce on him.&rdquo; Hope said, taking another swig of champagne and you laughed because Scott was not going to survive the night with her insatiable thirst. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N. Tell him.&rdquo; Wanda said, touching your arm. </p><p>&ldquo;And what do I say? Oh hey Bucky I know we&rsquo;ve been friends for a while but <b>I&rsquo;m in love with you</b>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah pretty much. Those guys don&rsquo;t have a clue about us. We have to make the first move.&rdquo; Pepper said. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Nat nodded in agreement.</p><p>&ldquo;Practice saying it!&rdquo; Wanda smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes do it!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bucky, <b>I&rsquo;m in love with you. I&rsquo;m in love with you</b>. I love James Buchanan fucking Barnes!&rdquo; You shouted, collapsing into laughter along with the others. </p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</b></p><p>You woke up to the worst headache ever. Your eyes felt glued shut when you tired to open them and when you did, the light streaming through your curtains made you wince. You checked your phone, seeing that the time flashed midday. You had missed so much stuff already, meetings, training, but you didn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>You sent a quick text to the girls: &ldquo;are you all alive?&rdquo; Before getting a reply back from Okoye: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m dying.&rdquo; </p><p>You laughed before quickly scrolling through your phone, seeing that you called Bucky early hours this morning. A one hour phone call&hellip; What was that&hellip;.</p><p>No.</p><p>No no no no no.</p><p>You scrolled down to Pepper&rsquo;s number but it just called out, same with Wanda, Nat&rsquo;s and Hope&rsquo;s. </p><p>You phoned Okoye.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m dying. No scrap that I&rsquo;m dead.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I did something stupid.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We all did&hellip; What was that cocktail? You know T'Challa didn&rsquo;t stop taking the piss out of me once I got in? I&rsquo;m dreading when I do actually get up&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okoye&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I need to get up but the room is still spinning.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think I told Bucky I was in love with him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Finally.&rdquo; She told you.</p><p>&ldquo;What do I do?&rdquo; You asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea. I&rsquo;m not good at this stuff. I can ask Shuri or Nakia? See what they know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Okoye.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it&rsquo;s going to be okay. You never know, it might work out for the best. I need to get up&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You can do it Okoye.&rdquo; You laughed before she swore at you and then hung up. </p><p>You rolled over in bed before flipping your duvet off and heading to the shower. You stayed under the water for ages, letting the hot water wash away the grime from last night. When you finally got out of the shower, you have your mouth a clean with your toothbrush, getting rid of the fuzziness from the alcohol. You felt a little more human after a good clean. </p><p>You got dressed in a pair of oversized shorts that you were pretty sure you&rsquo;d pinched from Bucky and a sweatshirt that probably belonged to Steve. Or Sam. You weren&rsquo;t quite sure. </p><p>Hell it could have been Tony&rsquo;s. </p><p>You tended to pinch their clothes because they were so goddamn comfortable. Pulling on a pair of fuzzy socks you made your way out into the kitchen, seeing Nat sat there, her top half sprawled out on the table. Wanda was massaging her temples, Pepper was nursing a coffee and Hope&hellip; Hope looked pretty damn smug with herself actually. </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so smiley?&rdquo; You asked her. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop talking so loud.&rdquo; Nat groaned. </p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip; Had a good night with Scott that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; She smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;Is there any food?&rdquo; You asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Vis!&rdquo; Wanda called and Vision appeared through the wall, floating to the kitchen. </p><p>&ldquo;Wanda said to wait until you came down Y/N and then I can make you all breakfast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Vision.&rdquo; </p><p>Vision would do anything for Wanda, and that includes making breakfast for everyone when they were hungover. He was a pretty good cook and you could hear eggs being whisked. You knew he&rsquo;d be making pancakes and your mouth watered. You poured some water from the jug into an empty glass and sat down next to Nat, rubbing her back. </p><p>&ldquo;I hate you all.&rdquo; She muttered. </p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Hope asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Because you piled me with drinks.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie.&rdquo; You scoffed, &ldquo;If anything, you were piling us with drinks.&rdquo;</p><p>Vision walked over with a stack of pancakes and you all grabbed a load, piling them up with syrup, fruits, anything you could get your hands on. </p><p>It went down so well.</p><p>Music started blaring through the speakers and you all winced, cursing Tony was he walked in to the kitchen, the guys following in behind him. You noticed T'Challa was also there, Okoye looking a little worse for wear. Shuri laughed as she made her way over to where the food was and sat down beside you, pulling you in to a sideways hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning ladies.&rdquo; Tony said, smiling at each of you. &ldquo;Or maybe that should be good afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Gamora, Nebula and Mantis?&rdquo; Hope asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Already on their mission.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh I hate them.&rdquo; Nat groaned, putting her head back down on the table. </p><p>&ldquo;And Carol?&rdquo; Wanda asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Somewhere&hellip; Not quite sure.&rdquo; Scott said, smiling over at Hope. He looked fucking tired and you let out a snort of laughter, earning a flick from Hope as she lent over to get another pancake. </p><p>&ldquo;She blasted off an hour before we left. Should we call her?&rdquo; Pepper asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Ladies focus. We&rsquo;ve got missions to go over.&rdquo; Tony said, clapping his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Not happening.&rdquo; Wanda said, grabbing another pancake. </p><p>You glanced over briefly to Bucky, who was also looking at you but he turned away when you saw him. Sam looked between the pair of you, offering you a small smile when he looked back at you. </p><p>Oh fuck he knew. </p><p>Which means they all knew.</p><p>Ohhhhh the ground needed to swallow you whole. </p><p>&ldquo;I spoke to Nakia before she disappeared.&rdquo; Okoye said, nudging you so you&rsquo;d look at her. &ldquo;She said that you should talk, be honest with him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I should. Thanks Okoye.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Y/L/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Peter?&rdquo; You asked the teenager who was currently looking at you.</p><p>&ldquo;You have chocolate sauce around your mouth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; You muttered grabbing for a napkin and wiping it away. You heard Nat snicker and you glowered at her. </p><p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s going to be no productivity from them today, maybe we should just&hellip; Have a break?&rdquo; Steve asked, looking at Tony who nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to head back to bed.&rdquo; Nat said, punching Clint in the arm as she went passed him after he laughed at her. </p><p>&ldquo;How much did you all drink last night?&rdquo; Sam asked, taking the seat that Nat just left.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh&hellip; There was the wine, the shots, more shots, more shots, wine, cocktails, shots, more shots and then more cocktails.&rdquo; You replied. </p><p>&ldquo;How are you all still alive?&rdquo; Steve asked, squeezing your shoulder as he grabbed a pancake. </p><p>Ugh you knew that squeeze, he only did that when he was trying to boost your spirits up. </p><p>Did Bucky tell everyone? Or did they hear your message? Oh god you hoped they hadn&rsquo;t all heard&hellip;.</p><p>Bucky sat down opposite you but he hadn&rsquo;t said anything yet. Usually he&rsquo;d have come out with something witty, taking the piss out of you as you slowly died from your hangover but nothing. </p><p>You&rsquo;d ruined your friendship. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Sam put his arm around you, tugging you into a hug like he could sense your mood change. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay sunshine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We all heard the message.&rdquo; He whispered in your ear and you groaned because thats what you were afraid of. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an idiot if it doesn&rsquo;t get reciprocated you know that.&rdquo; </p><p>He kissed the side of your head and you nodded before getting up from your chair and mumbling something about going back to bed. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t get very far before you felt a hand on your arm and you turned, seeing Bucky behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo; He said and oh he was so fucking serious. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; Uh&hellip; Did you want to go to the lounge?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and you followed him, folding your arms across your chest. You sat down on the sofa, quite a way from him and you pulled your legs up to your chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I got your message last night. I didn&rsquo;t know what was in it and it got played on loud speaker on the way back to the tower and everyone heard. Sweetheart, what you said&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you just&hellip; Just pretend that you didn&rsquo;t hear it? Make fun of me for being hungover and annoy the hell out of me like you usually do?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No. Because what you said&hellip; Sweetheart I&rsquo;ve been going over it all night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to turn me down. I get it. Just&hellip; Please, can we have this conversation when I&rsquo;m not feeling like the ground needs to swallow me whole? <b>Just please be my best friend right now, and not the guy I just confessed my love to.&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N. I&rsquo;m not going to do that. This is serious. How long? How long have you been in love with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three years.&rdquo; You muttered, playing with the hem of the shorts you had on. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; You&rsquo;ve been here almost four years.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah I know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Y/N. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me sooner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t know how and when to bring it up. But last night. I don&rsquo;t know, too much alcohol and I kept seeing all these couples in the club making out and I kept thinking that I wanted that with you and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m with Kacey.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know. I know and I&rsquo;m sorry but I just&hellip; It kills me to see you with her all the time and&hellip;&rdquo; You wiped the tears away from your eyes, not really wanting to cry because this wasn&rsquo;t making your hangover any better. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with you Bucky. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to stop anytime soon.&rdquo; You whispered.</p><p>He moved towards you, his hands on your cheeks, rubbing his thumb&rsquo;s on your cheeks and wiping away the tears in the process. His metal hand was so soothing against you skin. He looked at you; eyes scanning your face, taking in your appearance and his heart swelled. </p><p>Because he&rsquo;d wanted to hear those words from you for so long but he didn&rsquo;t know if you ever felt the same way. </p><p>But he was in a stable relationship with Kacey now and she was fun and kind and pretty and so sweet. </p><p>But there was you.

This was the first thing Bucky has said in the past hour and a half they&rsquo;ve been cramped in this god forsaken car. He had a knack for impulsively voicing his dumb thoughts at the worst times, but whenever you wanted to know what was actually going on in that head of his, he&rsquo;d never say.</p><p>They were staking out the front gate of a large mansion, very much not a farmhouse. It was mind numbingly boring, being stuck in a beetle with absolutely nothing else to do than stare at the gaudy gates of some rich asshole.</p><p>&ldquo;A farmhouse,&rdquo; Bucky repeats nonchalantly, &ldquo;If we ever get out of this business, or you know, live long enough to retire maybe&mdash; I want a farmhouse. With a lot of animals.&rdquo;</p><p><i>We?</i></p><p>Sam tries not to overthink it. It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s never thought about it before, but he knows it&rsquo;s not time to imagine a life with Bucky, a normal one at that. Besides, Bucky couldn&rsquo;t have possibly meant it that way.</p><p><i>Could he?</i></p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;What made you think of that?&rdquo; Sam pries, against his better judgement. Regrets it as it comes out of his mouth, actually.</p><p>&ldquo;Staring at that mansion for so damn long got me thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a first.&rdquo; Sam quips.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut up,&rdquo; Bucky shoots back, then returns to his previous thought. &ldquo;I just think living in a place like that all by yourself would just be lonely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stark did it for a while,&rdquo; Sam adds, looking back at the unmoving gates.</p><p>&ldquo;Well yeah, look how he turned out.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam holds back a laugh which Bucky notices because he leans back in his seat, gratified. Then he says, &ldquo;I dunno, call me old-fashioned if you gotta. Those people have the right idea is all I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>They leave it at that. It takes about ten minutes of silence before Bucky speaks again.</p><p>&ldquo;We could get bird feeders, like those red ones that I always see people using. Though I guess we&rsquo;d probably have chickens already.&rdquo;</p><p><i>There it is again. </i></p><p>This whole &ldquo;we&rdquo; thing was starting to gnaw at Sam. He just wants to ask Bucky what he means, but he knows if it isn&rsquo;t&mdash; if it&rsquo;s not what he thinks it is&mdash; Sam would be trapped in here with Bucky and his thoughts for the next few hours.</p><p>So, he doesn&rsquo;t respond, which Bucky doesn&rsquo;t say anything about, just sits quietly and goes back to looking out the window.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Sam and Bucky are kneeling behind some fallen debris, bullets flying over their heads. They&rsquo;d accidentally got caught while infiltrating what was left of a HYDRA base. Just another day for them.</p><p>&ldquo;I think yellow is a nice color for a farmhouse,&rdquo; Bucky says suddenly, getting up to peek with his gun.</p><p>Sam groans and starts searching the room for an escape. &ldquo;Barnes, now is not the time!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just trying to make small talk, sweetheart.&rdquo; He shouts over the drilling sound of his gun. Sam resists the urge to smack him upside the head with his wings. </p><p>He spies a large window on the far side of the room and elbows Bucky&rsquo;s leg. </p><p>&ldquo;I found our way out of here, but you aren&rsquo;t going to like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky crouches back down and follows Sam&rsquo;s gaze to the window. &ldquo;Oh hell no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way,&rdquo; Sam tells him, knowing full well he already knows. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re surrounded.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sam&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re scared,&rdquo; He turns to Bucky, who keeps staring at the window like it&rsquo;ll bite him. He knows Bucky is afraid of heights, knows it still haunts his memories. &ldquo;But I got you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam holds out his hand. Bucky looks at it, eyes wide and unsure. The bullets are still whizzing by and he&rsquo;s sure there are more reinforcements coming, but it&rsquo;s just him and Bucky at this very moment.</p><p>Bucky nods and takes Sam&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>It&rsquo;s breakfast this time.

He has to know. </p><p>He watches Bucky put the file down.</p><p><i>Safety off.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bucky replies painstakingly and god, did Barnes frustrate him sometimes and\u2014</p><p><i>Fire.</i></p><p>\u201cI mean this whole\u2014 we thing,\u201d Sam finally spits out. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this stuff about this farmhouse? What is we?\u201d</p><p>Bucky blinks. Moments pass. Months. Years even. \u201cWell, what do you want it to be?\u201d </p><p><i>Us.</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Sam says instead. He wants to take it all back now, unsure of where to go from here. The room is entirely suffocating now.</p><p>\u201cI think you do,\u201d Bucky cuts through his lie, making his way to Sam\u2019s side of the table. \u201cCause I know what I want it to be, and I hope you do too.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates, but Bucky\u2019s hands come up to cup Sam\u2019s face gently. Sam feels the hum of his arm, strangely comforting and sighs. </p><p>He tilts Sam\u2019s chin up. \u201cCan I?\u201d </p><p>Sam gives him the slightest nod before he presses their lips together. </p><p>It\u2019s careful and sweet and this\u2014 this is where Sam decides that this is what he wants. He wants to be right here with Bucky, for as long as he can. Sam\u2019s hands come up to grip Bucky\u2019s shirt and he deepens the kiss. He smiles when his beard tickles his face. </p><p>When they finally break apart, they touch their foreheads together. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all yours,\u201d Bucky says softly. Sam feels his breath on his lips. \u201cThe farmhouse, I mean. I\u2019ve never wanted it with anyone else but you.\u201d Bucky\u2019s arms wrap around his waist. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can even name the cat, if you want too.\u201d</p><p>Sam laughs and pushes Bucky away lightly, until he comes back to plant another kiss on Sam\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cAnd I promise we will have so many birds you won\u2019t even know what to do with them.\u201d</p><p>Sam puts a finger to his chin in fake thought. \u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a pretty big promise, Barnes.\u201d</p><p>Bucky gives him a smile. \u201cWell I plan to keep it.\u201d</p>",

This was the first thing Bucky has said in the past hour and a half they&rsquo;ve been cramped in this god forsaken car.

It was mind numbingly boring, being stuck in a beetle with absolutely nothing else to do than stare at the gaudy gates of some rich asshole.</p><p>&ldquo;A farmhouse,&rdquo; Bucky repeats nonchalantly, &ldquo;If we ever get out of this business, or you know, live long enough to retire maybe&mdash; I want a farmhouse. With a lot of animals.&rdquo;</p><p><i>We?</i></p><p>Sam tries not to overthink it. It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s never thought about it before, but he knows it&rsquo;s not time to imagine a life with Bucky, a normal one at that. Besides, Bucky couldn&rsquo;t have possibly meant it that way.</p><p><i>Could he?</i></p><p>&ldquo;What made you think of that?&rdquo; Sam pries, against his better judgement. Regrets it as it comes out of his mouth, actually.</p><p>&ldquo;Staring at that mansion for so damn long got me thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a first.&rdquo; Sam quips.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut up,&rdquo; Bucky shoots back, then returns to his previous thought. &ldquo;I just think living in a place like that all by yourself would just be lonely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stark did it for a while,&rdquo; Sam adds, looking back at the unmoving gates.</p><p>&ldquo;Well yeah, look how he turned out.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam holds back a laugh which Bucky notices because he leans back in his seat, gratified. Then he says, &ldquo;I dunno, call me old-fashioned if you gotta. Those people have the right idea is all I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>They leave it at that. It takes about ten minutes of silence before Bucky speaks again.</p><p>&ldquo;We could get bird feeders, like those red ones that I always see people using. Though I guess we&rsquo;d probably have chickens already.&rdquo;</p><p><i>There it is again. </i></p><p>This whole &ldquo;we&rdquo; thing was starting to gnaw at Sam. He just wants to ask Bucky what he means, but he knows if it isn&rsquo;t&mdash; if it&rsquo;s not what he thinks it is&mdash; Sam would be trapped in here with Bucky and his thoughts for the next few hours.</p><p>So, he doesn&rsquo;t respond, which Bucky doesn&rsquo;t say anything about, just sits quietly and goes back to looking out the window.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Sam and Bucky are kneeling behind some fallen debris, bullets flying over their heads. They&rsquo;d accidentally got caught while infiltrating what was left of a HYDRA base. Just another day for them.</p><p>&ldquo;I think yellow is a nice color for a farmhouse,&rdquo; Bucky says suddenly, getting up to peek with his gun.</p><p>Sam groans and starts searching the room for an escape. &ldquo;Barnes, now is not the time!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just trying to make small talk, sweetheart.&rdquo; He shouts over the drilling sound of his gun. Sam resists the urge to smack him upside the head with his wings. </p><p>He spies a large window on the far side of the room and elbows Bucky&rsquo;s leg. </p><p>&ldquo;I found our way out of here, but you aren&rsquo;t going to like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky crouches back down and follows Sam&rsquo;s gaze to the window. &ldquo;Oh hell no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way,&rdquo; Sam tells him, knowing full well he already knows. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re surrounded.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sam&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re scared,&rdquo; He turns to Bucky, who keeps staring at the window like it&rsquo;ll bite him. He knows Bucky is afraid of heights, knows it still haunts his memories. &ldquo;But I got you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam holds out his hand. Bucky looks at it, eyes wide and unsure. The bullets are still whizzing by and he&rsquo;s sure there are more reinforcements coming, but it&rsquo;s just him and Bucky at this very moment.</p><p>Bucky nods and takes Sam&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>It&rsquo;s breakfast this time. Sam is eating his cereal while Bucky is drinking his morning coffee, scrolling through something on his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you know that chickens can eat their own eggs if you don&rsquo;t collect them fast enough?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Christ, not this again.</i></p><p>Sam pauses before eating his spoonful of cereal. &ldquo;Bucky, why would I ever need to know that?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugs, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bird guy. Just thought it was interesting.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam brushes it off, taking a bite of cereal. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re also a chicken.&rdquo; Bucky adds soon after and grins at him. It&rsquo;s annoyingly smug, but also bright and lovely at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be eating my own eggs anytime soon.&rdquo; Sam replies and smirks at him.</p><p>His smile falls. &ldquo;Okay yeah, that&rsquo;s gross.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then let me finish my goddamn breakfast.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>They are going over some mission plans when &ldquo;we&rdquo; comes back to haunt Sam. Bucky is across from him, standing on the other side of the cluttered table. He&rsquo;s looking at a file when he scratches his beard, then mumbles, &ldquo;We could get a cat.&rdquo;</p><p>As far as Sam remembers, cats were definitely not in the mission plans. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t decide whether the torture of &ldquo;we&rdquo; outweighs the possible torture of having to confront his feelings for Bucky. If Sam pried, asked about it and the &ldquo;we&rdquo; turned out to be something&mdash; someone else&hellip;</p><p>Sam decides to shoot his shot.</p><p><i>Load the bullet.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Bucky.&rdquo; He says sternly, and Bucky looks up at him.
