It&rsquo;s not a proud moment when he has to tell Steve his condoms may not have been enough and that he&rsquo;s preggo as an eggo and so they decide to marry. Maube Steve&rsquo;s mom wouldn&rsquo;t approve otherwise, maybe Howard wouldn&rsquo;t, either way, But living in New York on Steve&rsquo;s construction job check and an entry level tech job that Tony was able to snag isn&rsquo;t easy. The baby comes, the baby grows, but the relationship really can&rsquo;t last. They fight often enough that Mrs. Crabtree from downstairs calls the police more than once. It&rsquo;s never violent, but it&rsquo;s rarely peaceful. Peter turns 4 and on his birthday, Steve brings up the idea of separation, something temporary, something that may save them, but Tony knows that that won&rsquo;t happen. </p><p>They&rsquo;re divorced three months later and are now sharing custody. </p><p>Cut to maybe 3 years later? And Tony, tired of feeling stuck between his stalled out career, his asshole of an ex husband, and a 7 year old looks more like his dad every day, decides he needs to start dating again. But being 35, divorced, and a single father really does crimp his style, so he let&rsquo;s Natasha from his job set him up. Some guy from R&amp;D that just started, in fact he only just arrived stateside from working abroad. </p><p>Enter Bucky (&ldquo;please call me James, haven&rsquo;t been Bucky since high school) and whoo, do they hit it off. Bucky&rsquo;s whip smart and kind. They can talk for hours a night and walk into work at the same time just to be romantic losers. Great with the idea of Peter and has a smile that makes Tony flush like he hasn&rsquo;t in years. </p><p>So he decides to take the plunge and introduce him to Peter, but to his horror not only does Peter already know James, he seems to know him as Uncle Bucky. </p><p>&quot;How do you know my son?&rdquo; Tony asks nearing the hugging pair, kneeling beside them where Peter tackled James to the ground. </p><p>James eyes widen comically as he sets Perer back down. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Petey&rsquo;s dad?&rdquo; He asks instead of answering. The hardset of his mouth and the unhappy wrinkle between his eyes means bad things for Tony. &ldquo;That means, shit, you&rsquo;re Steve&rsquo;s ex.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How do you know Steve?&rdquo; Tony asks pleading for an answer that doesn&rsquo;t bring about any unnecessary drama or heartache into Tony&rsquo;s already hectic life. </p><p>&ldquo;We grew up together, we even served together.&rdquo; James says, voice quiet and eyes cast away as he watches Peter run off to watch cartoons upstairs. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like a brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was married to him, for 4 years, and he never mentioned you, not once. I would distinctly remember him mentioning a fucking brother from the army!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We drifted apart, after the service. He came home and I-&rdquo; James looked down and around the half messy living room, eyes catching on the pictures of Peter through the years. Pictures that included everyone in Peter&rsquo;s life except his other father. &ldquo;We made amends last year, when I came back. He was already divorced, from you, I guess. I met Petey then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my ex husband&rsquo;s best friend.&rdquo; Tony said finally. Sitting down on his lumpy couch he&rsquo;d carried over from his own school days. &ldquo;Of course you are.&rdquo;</p>",
