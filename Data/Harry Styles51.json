        "answer": "<p><b>Sorry for the late reply! \ud83d\ude05</b></p><p>.</p><p>\u201cLook at those saggy boobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Y/N covered his mouth as the old lady standing beside them gave them a dirty look and walked away in disgust.\u00a0\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d<br/></p><p>He quickly removed her hand to show her the most annoying smirk she had ever seen. Poking her forehead, he said, \u201cwell this is your fault. You made me go to this stupid exhibition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid, you\u2019re just too dumb to admire art.\u201d Y/N scoffed, rolling her eyes.\u00a0\u201cBesides, why did you even agree to go if you hate this?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it\u2019d be this boring.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> boring.\u201d She smacked his arm and turned to walk away, once again, missing out on that secret smile he had on his face. Of course he didn\u2019t really care about those paintings. Sure they were beautiful, in some ways. But the main reason he wanted to come along was just\u00a0<i>her</i>. He wouldn\u2019t miss out on an opportunity to spend time with her, and to be honest, he was really enjoying himself.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N couldn\u2019t shut up about those paintings which he didn\u2019t understand. She went on and on about the colors and the meanings behind them, yet all he could make out was a horse with tiny legs. But if she said it was a masterpiece, he would just blindly agree.<br/></p><p>\u201cHarry, look, this one looks like you.\u201d She snorted, pointing to a pig and he didn\u2019t know why he found it funny. Shaking his head, he pointed to the previous painting of the naked witch.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s you, minus the saggy boobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She covered her chest with both arms, making him laugh harder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should be glad, it\u2019s actually a compliment for your boobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird that you even think about my boobs!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy not? They\u2019re cute! <i>Ouch!\u201d</i> He jumped away when she smacked him on the arm again.<br/></p><p>\u201cPervert,\u201d she grumbled, but she couldn\u2019t hide that smile on her face as she turned away and approached another piece of art. He stayed exactly where he was to watch her from a distance. She was too busy paying her entire attention to the painting to notice him pulling out his phone. But when he snapped a photo, she turned her head around instantly.</p><p>\u201cDid you just take a photo?\u201d She giggled, walking back to him and Harry swiftly hid his phone behind his back.\u00a0\u201cI thought you hated these paintings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for\u2026instagram. To fool people into thinking I enjoy art,\u201d he joked, making her laugh.<br/></p><p>\u201cLiar. You don\u2019t even know how to use instagram. Lemme see it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCome on. Give me your phone.\u201d She tugged on his sleeve, pouting like a child, but he had put his phone into his pocket and tried his best to push her away without actually hurting her. They were laughing so hard that a security had to walk over and tell them not to disturb the others or else he would have to ask them to leave.<br/></p><p>Mumbling quick apologies, the pair tried their best to seem remorseful, yet the second the man walked away, they bumped their heads to each other from snickering so much.</p><p>\u201cI know your password, I\u2019m gonna look through your phone when you sleep,\u201d she said as a joke, pointing a finger to his face. But he thought she was serious, so he ended up saying the truth.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2026took a photo of you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOf me?\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry nodded shyly.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N looked at him, eyes widened, he was literally holding his breath while waiting for an answer, a reaction, <i>anything</i>. For one second, he had made up a thousand scenarios in his head, the most far-fetched one being her kissing him on the cheek as a reward after seeing that pretty photo he\u2019d taken of her. But reality wasn\u2019t as great as his imagination. Instead of asking to see the shot, Y/N cracked up all of a sudden, holding onto his shoulder as she tossed her head back.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay you know what? If you don\u2019t wanna tell me the truth, it\u2019s fine.\u201d She shrugged, patting him on the arm. \u201cKeep that saggy boobs photo to yourself.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry didn\u2019t say anything when she kept on walking ahead. Instead he pulled his phone out again and smiled at the photo of the girl he loved, just like his feelings, he would keep it to himself for now.</p>",
