The constant beeps of the machines monitoring if he was still alive or not didn\u2019t manage to chase away the silence. A boy his age should be running around and screaming, should be playing with his friends and should go on adventures. But now his last adventure had gone wrong it was unsure if he would ever open his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cHe told me that you were brave and smart and that you were the best climber in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre.\u201d Jon whispered, but his lips formed a straight line. \u201cYou are brave and you are smart and you are the best climber in the world.\u201d Jon reached for Bran\u2019s hand and squeezed it. \u201cAnd when you\u2019ll wake up you\u2019ll tell us what happened so we can find whoever did this to you.\u201d</p><p>When Jon had first told her that the Starks didn\u2019t believe Bran had simply fallen of that roof, Daenerys had tried to argue with him. She had told him that even the best climbers could fall all of a sudden. Maybe it had been a bird bothering him. Or maybe his hand had simply slipped away and he hadn\u2019t been able to correct it.</p><p>But Jon had firmly shaken his head and had almost yelled that Bran had never fallen before and would never fall. Jon was certain someone had pushed him and he couldn\u2019t wait to find out who so he could go after them.</p><p>\u201cI do hope we can properly meet soon, Bran.\u201d Daenerys stepped away from the bed. </p><p>The sheets were too white, just like the walls. Not even the million get better soon cards could chase away the horrible smell and atmosphere that seemed to belong to the hospital. </p><!-- more --><p>But instead of walking away from his brother and leaving the smell and atmosphere behind, Jon sat down on the edge of the bed and kept on holding onto his brother\u2019s hand. \u201cI know you\u2019re already asleep, but I came up with another bedtime story. I thought you\u2019d wanna hear it.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys raised her eyebrows, but then she shrugged and sat down on an uncomfortable small wooden stool. She folded her hands in her lap and tried to make herself as invisible as possible, almost feeling as if she was witnessing a private moment not meant for her.</p><p>\u201cOnce Upon A Time\u2026\u201d Jon cleared his throat and straightened his back. \u201cA young prince was practicing his sword fighting skills in a meadow, far away from his castle and all alone. The trees surrounding him were hardly a match for him, because his brothers had taught him well. But after a while the young prince grew bored with the trees and wandered further and further away from home to find something else to fight, something way more exciting.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys cocked her head and her lips curled up into a smile when Jon\u2019s soothing voice chased away the endless monotonous beeping and the lack of laughter. </p><p>\u201cIt was then that he discovered a tower. The tower was surrounded by darkness and there was no door. Only at the very top seemed to be a small window. When the prince stood still to watch the tower he heard a soft voice, a soft voice screaming for a knight brave enough to save her from the horrible dragon guarding her.\u201d</p><p>After that last sentence Daenerys rolled her eyes and shook her head. \u201cWhy do men always think that princesses need saving and that dragons are bad?\u201d She murmured and Jon turned around to look at her.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d He locked his glance with hers and the frown on his forehead deepened.</p><p>For a short second Daenerys contemplated just keeping her mouth shut, but then she realized that if she kept her mouth shut now, Jon would probably never stop telling stories about poor damsels in distress and so called brave men saving them from poor dragons. \u201cI wondered why men always think that princesses need saving and that dragons are monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big fire breathing dragon. He\u2019s even taller than the tower and has three poisonous tales and giant wings on his back. He can burn everything within sight with just one small breath.\u201d Jon shrugged. \u201cIt&rsquo;s normal to be afraid of a beast like that.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cSo, the prince is gonna be terrified and turn around then?\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head. \u201cOf course not. His worry about the princess is bigger than his fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why can\u2019t the princess\u2019 will to escape be bigger than her fear or why can\u2019t she have befriended the dragon?\u201d Daenerys raised her voice a little and then she remembered the comatose boy in the bed. \u201cSorry, Bran. I didn\u2019t want to ruin your story. I simply wanted to present some suggestions to make it better and different.\u201d</p><p>Jon stood up from the bed and gestured her to change places. \u201cIf you know a better way to tell this story, go ahead.\u201d He waited until Daenerys stood up from her seat to sit down next to Bran. </p><p>Just like Jon had done she reached for his hand. She was quite surprised that his hand felt this warm, despite the circumstances and then she took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThe prince rushed towards the tower as quickly as he could, but he stood still when the big fire breathing dragon, taller than the tower and with three poisonous tales appeared. The prince was unsure where the dragon had come from, but for a moment he froze, not able to move anymore. He had never seen a dragon before and his heart was racing in his chest while he faced the monster with the giant wings.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looked at Jon, but Jon had his arms crossed over his chest while he leaned back against the wall. \u201cIt&rsquo;s your story now. No need to look at me.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys let out a deep breath before she continued. \u201cBut the prince remembered the screaming princess and gathered all the courage he could find. He tightened his grip on his sword and he straightened his back while he walked towards the dragon, ready to attack. But before he was within reach the voice of the princess interrupted him.\u201d</p><p>When Daenerys looked at Jon again his muscles had relaxed and a small smile was playing around his lips. </p><p>\u201cThe princess yelled \u201cstop!\u201d, because she didn\u2019t want the dragon to get hurt. Over the years the dragon had become her friend, but she realized that the young prince had understood her wrong. She had not begged for him to save her from the dragon. She had begged him to save her and the dragon. Because even though the princess and the dragon had become close friends, a witch had casted a powerful spell on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? They still need a prince to save them.\u201d Jon smirked and Daenerys rolled her eyes while she smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cShut up. I\u2019m telling a story here. Let me finish, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jon lifted his hands up. \u201cFine, but they still needed saving.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys rolled her eyes once more. She couldn\u2019t blame Jon for not knowing what story she was telling. \u201cFor the spell to be broken both a princess and a prince were needed. But all the princes before him had mindlessly tried to kill the dragon and had died a terrible dead because they had refused to listen to the princess\u2019 pleads. But this prince was different and actually willing to listen. And even though the young prince was still terribly afraid of what could happen, he trusted the princess to know more about the dragon and the spell than he did. After all, she had been spending much more time here than he had.\u201d</p><p>Jon coughed. \u201cVisiting hour is almost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost finished!\u201d Daenerys moved a little closer towards Bran\u2019s face. \u201cThe old witch had drawn an imaginary circle around the tower and only if the dragon carried both the prince and the princess on his back they would all be able to leave. For the princess it wasn\u2019t that hard to get on the dragon\u2019s back. From her high tower it was only a short leap and she trusted her friend unconditionally. But the prince had to climb the dragon to get there. Luckily this special prince was the best climber in the entire world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs\u2026\u201d Jon whispered and Daenerys\u2019 smile brightened.</p><p>\u201cOnce in a while his hands shook. He almost lost his footing twice. But eventually he reached the back of the dragon and could face the beautiful princess who had been in need of his aid. And even though they wanted to get to know each other better before committing to sharing the rest of their lives together, they dared to hope, while the dragon leaped into the sky and flied out of the magic circle, that this was the beginning of a wonderful happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>Jon walked towards her and sat down next to her with an arm firmly around her waist. </p><p>\u201cAnd, was it better than the version of this story you had in mind?\u201d Daenerys felt her cheeks heating up, but when Jon kissed her slightly parted lips she allowed herself to relax her tensed muscles.</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d Jon nodded at her and he pressed another kiss on her forehead. \u201cI&rsquo;m sure Bran loved it.\u201d</p>",

The constant beeps of the machines monitoring if he was still alive or not didn\u2019t manage to chase away the silence.

I thought you\u2019d wanna hear it.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys raised her eyebrows, but then she shrugged and sat down on an uncomfortable small wooden stool. She folded her hands in her lap and tried to make herself as invisible as possible, almost feeling as if she was witnessing a private moment not meant for her.</p><p>\u201cOnce Upon A Time\u2026\u201d Jon cleared his throat and straightened his back. \u201cA young prince was practicing his sword fighting skills in a meadow, far away from his castle and all alone. The trees surrounding him were hardly a match for him, because his brothers had taught him well. But after a while the young prince grew bored with the trees and wandered further and further away from home to find something else to fight, something way more exciting.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys cocked her head and her lips curled up into a smile when Jon\u2019s soothing voice chased away the endless monotonous beeping and the lack of laughter. </p><p>\u201cIt was then that he discovered a tower. The tower was surrounded by darkness and there was no door. Only at the very top seemed to be a small window. When the prince stood still to watch the tower he heard a soft voice, a soft voice screaming for a knight brave enough to save her from the horrible dragon guarding her.\u201d</p><p>After that last sentence Daenerys rolled her eyes and shook her head. \u201cWhy do men always think that princesses need saving and that dragons are bad?\u201d She murmured and Jon turned around to look at her.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d He locked his glance with hers and the frown on his forehead deepened.</p><p>For a short second Daenerys contemplated just keeping her mouth shut, but then she realized that if she kept her mouth shut now, Jon would probably never stop telling stories about poor damsels in distress and so called brave men saving them from poor dragons. \u201cI wondered why men always think that princesses need saving and that dragons are monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big fire breathing dragon. He\u2019s even taller than the tower and has three poisonous tales and giant wings on his back. He can burn everything within sight with just one small breath.\u201d Jon shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to be afraid of a beast like that.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cSo, the prince is gonna be terrified and turn around then?\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head. \u201cOf course not. His worry about the princess is bigger than his fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why can\u2019t the princess\u2019 will to escape be bigger than her fear or why can\u2019t she have befriended the dragon?\u201d Daenerys raised her voice a little and then she remembered the comatose boy in the bed. \u201cSorry, Bran. I didn\u2019t want to ruin your story. I simply wanted to present some suggestions to make it better and different.\u201d</p><p>Jon stood up from the bed and gestured her to change places. \u201cIf you know a better way to tell this story, go ahead.\u201d He waited until Daenerys stood up from her seat to sit down next to Bran. </p><p>Just like Jon had done she reached for his hand. She was quite surprised that his hand felt this warm, despite the circumstances and then she took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThe prince rushed towards the tower as quickly as he could, but he stood still when the big fire breathing dragon, taller than the tower and with three poisonous tales appeared. The prince was unsure where the dragon had come from, but for a moment he froze, not able to move anymore. He had never seen a dragon before and his heart was racing in his chest while he faced the monster with the giant wings.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looked at Jon, but Jon had his arms crossed over his chest while he leaned back against the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s your story now. No need to look at me.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys let out a deep breath before she continued. \u201cBut the prince remembered the screaming princess and gathered all the courage he could find. He tightened his grip on his sword and he straightened his back while he walked towards the dragon, ready to attack. But before he was within reach the voice of the princess interrupted him.\u201d</p><p>When Daenerys looked at Jon again his muscles had relaxed and a small smile was playing around his lips. </p><p>\u201cThe princess yelled \u201cstop!\u201d, because she didn\u2019t want the dragon to get hurt. Over the years the dragon had become her friend, but she realized that the young prince had understood her wrong. She had not begged for him to save her from the dragon. She had begged him to save her and the dragon. Because even though the princess and the dragon had become close friends, a witch had casted a powerful spell on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? They still need a prince to save them.\u201d Jon smirked and Daenerys rolled her eyes while she smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cShut up. I\u2019m telling a story here. Let me finish, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jon lifted his hands up. \u201cFine, but they still needed saving.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys rolled her eyes once more. She couldn\u2019t blame Jon for not knowing what story she was telling. \u201cFor the spell to be broken both a princess and a prince were needed. But all the princes before him had mindlessly tried to kill the dragon and had died a terrible dead because they had refused to listen to the princess\u2019 pleads. But this prince was different and actually willing to listen. And even though the young prince was still terribly afraid of what could happen, he trusted the princess to know more about the dragon and the spell than he did. After all, she had been spending much more time here than he had.\u201d</p><p>Jon coughed. \u201cVisiting hour is almost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost finished!\u201d Daenerys moved a little closer towards Bran\u2019s face. \u201cThe old witch had drawn an imaginary circle around the tower and only if the dragon carried both the prince and the princess on his back they would all be able to leave. For the princess it wasn\u2019t that hard to get on the dragon\u2019s back. From her high tower it was only a short leap and she trusted her friend unconditionally. But the prince had to climb the dragon to get there. Luckily this special prince was the best climber in the entire world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs\u2026\u201d Jon whispered and Daenerys\u2019 smile brightened.</p><p>\u201cOnce in a while his hands shook. He almost lost his footing twice. But eventually he reached the back of the dragon and could face the beautiful princess who had been in need of his aid. And even though they wanted to get to know each other better before committing to sharing the rest of their lives together, they dared to hope, while the dragon leaped into the sky and flied out of the magic circle, that this was the beginning of a wonderful happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>Jon walked towards her and sat down next to her with an arm firmly around her waist. </p><p>\u201cAnd, was it better than the version of this story you had in mind?\u201d Daenerys felt her cheeks heating up, but when Jon kissed her slightly parted lips she allowed herself to relax her tensed muscles.</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d Jon nodded at her and he pressed another kiss on her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sure Bran loved it.\u201d</p></p>",

        "title": "My opinion on Sansa\u2019s relationships",
        "body": "<p>So I just wanted to jot down some of my thoughts on Sansa\u2019s relationships with her siblings.\u00a0</p><p>In Season 1/Book1, her relationship with Arya is that of rival siblings who don\u2019t get along. A lot of people notice that Sansa is closer to their mother and Arya feels left out, and often feels as though her mother is trying to force her into a role of a lady and to be more like Sansa. She obviously has a closer relationship to her father, in comparison, who encouraged her to be herself. Where Arya feels like she\u2019s left out from a relationship with her mother, Sansa feels like she\u2019s left out from a relationship with her father. Both children love their parents and are loved in turn, but their parents have made it sort of obvious that they understand and get along with one child more than the other. Sansa idealizes her mother, and tries to imitate her, and expects Arya to do the same since they are both the same gender. However, Arya idealizes her father, and resists conforming to societal expectations.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that they are children. Sansa is 11-12 depending on books or seasons, when we meet her, and Arya is 9-10. We are introduced to Sansa through Arya\u2019s perspective, and since she\u2019s such a lovable character, we automatically see Sansa as her antithesis, since they are such opposites. But BOTH are bratty kids. Sansa is snobby, and Arya is rebellious. Neither wants to understand the other.\u00a0</p><p>Her relationship with her other siblings is easier: She is closer to Robb, or as close as she can be to her brothers, and she is an older sibling to Bran and Rickon, without the tension that she has with Arya. She understands that they have different roles in society, and is able to interact with them normally.\u00a0</p><p>Her relationship with Jon is different. Because Jon is her father\u2019s bastard son, and is disliked by Catelyn, Sansa imitates this behavior to some degree. She knows her mother doesn\u2019t like Jon, and at worst, is indifferent with some teasing. Perhaps, if her relationship with her father was stronger/closer like the one he has with Arya, this would have been different. But as it is, Sansa\u2019s education and parenting was basically left up to Catelyn, and Ned is the father who will tell her she looks pretty and that he\u2019ll give her a good husband one day. This is not to say that she didn\u2019t have a relationship with Jon. In the books, we do know that when Jon thinks of Sansa, he remembers that she taught him how to talk to girls and how to dance. So we can think that either they had initially had a good relationship before Sansa understood what a bastard was, and why her mother disliked Jon, or we can think that even while she knew that Jon was a bastard, she sometimes still interacted with him without being bratty. Which isn\u2019t unbelievable.\u00a0</p><p>A lot of people use the situation at the crossings as evidence that Sansa is a bad sibling. On that score, I have only to quote what Ned said to Arya, which was Sansa was put in the position of having to call the prince a liar in front of the king and queen. She was already betrothed to Joffrey, and was trying to set up a rapport with him in some fashion. A lot of criticism is that Sansa fell in love with Joffrey because she wanted to be queen. Well Sansa was a preteen, and I liken her initial behavior with Joffrey as the same as Anna from Frozen when she met Hans for the first time. Her fantasy was finally coming true and her life was finally starting, at least in her mind. Anyways, Sansa is the one who loses the most, as Lady dies &ndash; which incidentally pushes her further from her father and sister since she blames them for her death. Which isn\u2019t entirely unfounded; her father did kill Lady and Arya\u2019s wolf was the one that bit Joffrey. It doesn\u2019t help that Arya blames Sansa for Mycah\u2019s murder (or at least holds Sansa to some level of responsibility &ndash; like the queen and Joffrey and the hound). I want to be super clear when i say that Sansa had nothing to do with that &ndash; Mycah was already run down by the time they were having the meeting with the king.\u00a0</p><p>So at this point we have Sansa\u2019s relationship with her father and sister super distant. Ned can\u2019t bridge the gap because he doesn\u2019t understand how to be a parent to Sansa. He understand\u2019s Arya because they are similar, but Sansa is different. She\u2019s a lady who was raised and influenced by his southern wife and a septa. This doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t Northern. She is very proud of the fact that she understands houses of the north and reading and writing better than her brothers (though Arya is better at math than her). But Sansa prepared for a life in the south. Which is why she puts a lot of effort into repairing her relationship with her fiance. At this point, and actually throughout the entire first book, Ned has said nothing against Joffrey. Sansa is doing what she is meant to be doing.\u00a0</p><p>Now in the books &ndash; not the shows &ndash; Sansa goes to the queen to tell her Ned plans to return them home. She has no idea that Ned went to the queen to tell her he knew about her infidelity. Why would she, Ned didn\u2019t confide in anyone. He hasn\u2019t told her anything besides the fact that she was leaving kingslanding and that the betrothal she has be working on for the past year was over. Going behind her fathers back to tell the queen, while it sounds bad, is equivalent to say asking your friend\u2019s parent if you could stay for a sleepover when your parents already said you can\u2019t. And if you say, well she still shouldn\u2019t have done that, well I want to say again that Ned killed Lady. Those wolves have deep relationships with the Starks. Ned, who claimed to be very close to Robert, did nothing besides a half-hearted attempt at convincing the king to spare her. he didn\u2019t suggest sending her north, he didn\u2019t pack up and leave right away, he didn\u2019t do anything but kill his daughter\u2019s direwolf.\u00a0</p><p>As viewers/readers, we know the Lannisters are bad news. But to a character like Sansa, they aren\u2019t even the ruling family, the Baratheons are. Any fault can be put on Robert\u2019s feet since he is the king. She has no idea that Robert has little say in the going ons of the realm since he\u2019s in so much debt to the Lannisters, and that he\u2019s outnumbered by Lannister men. But the death of Lady is put more a the feet of Robert than Cersei, especially since at this point, Sansa still lives in the fantasy that Queens are supposed to be kind and gracious (and why wouldn\u2019t she think that; her idols are figures like good Queen Alysanne and she hasn\u2019t ever heard of Cersei doing anything bad). It won\u2019t be until Cersei starts showing her true colors that she puts the blame of lady\u2019s death on Cersei.\u00a0</p><p>In Book2-3/Season 2-3, we get a bit more of a glimpse on Sansa\u2019s relationship with Robb. Robb is Sansa\u2019s knight in shining armor. (while we can\u2019t exactly say he started a war for her &ndash; he started a war for their father &ndash; we knows that he continued south because he wanted her back (and he wanted Joffrey off the throne, but it would have been easier to hold the north than lead a campaign south) But she knows that he is fighting a war and that she would return to him if he won. I want to say that i completely understand Robb not giving up Jamie for his sister. He is the king and he has to think about the good of his people before anything else. However, Sansa does see on some level what she\u2019s worth when Robb marries the wrong girl (Talisa/Jeyne). He loses most of his army to marry a woman, rather than risk that army to return his sister to him. Now, Robb (books and shows) is a child. He little more than 15 in the books, 17-18 in the shows. if we can be sympathetic to him for being a kid and making mistakes, we can be understanding to a little girl who was even younger.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame Robb; he had bad advisors, in the books he had plans to go back North and reclaim it from the iron born after the wedding, and in the show, he had plans to take Casterly rock and send men to the North after securing the frey army. But Roose bolton suggested he detour on the way and none of his other advisors, besides telling him he\u2019s an idiot who lost the North, ever really did anything. Sansa doens\u2019t blame her brother either &ndash; in the preview of Winds of Winter, she remarks how young a boy is and says that if her brother was alive he would be that young. She maintains that her brother was her hero, even if he failed.\u00a0</p><p>While George barely mentioned Sansa in the last two books, because of her central role in the show, I have high hopes for Sansa in the coming books.\u00a0</p><p>And those are just some of my thoughts on Sansa\u2019s relationships with her siblings.\u00a0</p>",

A lot of people notice that Sansa is closer to their mother and Arya feels left out, and often feels as though her mother is trying to force her into a role of a lady and to be more like Sansa.

(while we can\u2019t exactly say he started a war for her \u2013 he started a war for their father \u2013 we knows that he continued south because he wanted her back (and he wanted Joffrey off the throne, but it would have been easier to hold the north than lead a campaign south) But she knows that he is fighting a war and that she would return to him if he won. I want to say that i completely understand Robb not giving up Jamie for his sister. He is the king and he has to think about the good of his people before anything else. However, Sansa does see on some level what she\u2019s worth when Robb marries the wrong girl (Talisa/Jeyne). He loses most of his army to marry a woman, rather than risk that army to return his sister to him. Now, Robb (books and shows) is a child. He little more than 15 in the books, 17-18 in the shows. if we can be sympathetic to him for being a kid and making mistakes, we can be understanding to a little girl who was even younger.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame Robb; he had bad advisors, in the books he had plans to go back North and reclaim it from the iron born after the wedding, and in the show, he had plans to take Casterly rock and send men to the North after securing the frey army. But Roose bolton suggested he detour on the way and none of his other advisors, besides telling him he\u2019s an idiot who lost the North, ever really did anything. Sansa doens\u2019t blame her brother either \u2013 in the preview of Winds of Winter, she remarks how young a boy is and says that if her brother was alive he would be that young. She maintains that her brother was her hero, even if he failed.\u00a0</p><p>While George barely mentioned Sansa in the last two books, because of her central role in the show, I have high hopes for Sansa in the coming books.\u00a0</p><p>And those are just some of my thoughts on Sansa\u2019s relationships with her siblings.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>So I just wanted to jot down some of my thoughts on Sansa&rsquo;s relationships with her siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>In Season 1/Book1, her relationship with Arya is that of rival siblings who don&rsquo;t get along. A lot of people notice that Sansa is closer to their mother and Arya feels left out, and often feels as though her mother is trying to force her into a role of a lady and to be more like Sansa. She obviously has a closer relationship to her father, in comparison, who encouraged her to be herself. Where Arya feels like she&rsquo;s left out from a relationship with her mother, Sansa feels like she&rsquo;s left out from a relationship with her father. Both children love their parents and are loved in turn, but their parents have made it sort of obvious that they understand and get along with one child more than the other. Sansa idealizes her mother, and tries to imitate her, and expects Arya to do the same since they are both the same gender. However, Arya idealizes her father, and resists conforming to societal expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that they are children. Sansa is 11-12 depending on books or seasons, when we meet her, and Arya is 9-10. We are introduced to Sansa through Arya&rsquo;s perspective, and since she&rsquo;s such a lovable character, we automatically see Sansa as her antithesis, since they are such opposites. But BOTH are bratty kids. Sansa is snobby, and Arya is rebellious. Neither wants to understand the other.&nbsp;</p><p>Her relationship with her other siblings is easier: She is closer to Robb, or as close as she can be to her brothers, and she is an older sibling to Bran and Rickon, without the tension that she has with Arya. She understands that they have different roles in society, and is able to interact with them normally.&nbsp;</p><p>Her relationship with Jon is different. Because Jon is her father&rsquo;s bastard son, and is disliked by Catelyn, Sansa imitates this behavior to some degree. She knows her mother doesn&rsquo;t like Jon, and at worst, is indifferent with some teasing. Perhaps, if her relationship with her father was stronger/closer like the one he has with Arya, this would have been different. But as it is, Sansa&rsquo;s education and parenting was basically left up to Catelyn, and Ned is the father who will tell her she looks pretty and that he&rsquo;ll give her a good husband one day. This is not to say that she didn&rsquo;t have a relationship with Jon. In the books, we do know that when Jon thinks of Sansa, he remembers that she taught him how to talk to girls and how to dance. So we can think that either they had initially had a good relationship before Sansa understood what a bastard was, and why her mother disliked Jon, or we can think that even while she knew that Jon was a bastard, she sometimes still interacted with him without being bratty. Which isn&rsquo;t unbelievable.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of people use the situation at the crossings as evidence that Sansa is a bad sibling. On that score, I have only to quote what Ned said to Arya, which was Sansa was put in the position of having to call the prince a liar in front of the king and queen. She was already betrothed to Joffrey, and was trying to set up a rapport with him in some fashion. A lot of criticism is that Sansa fell in love with Joffrey because she wanted to be queen. Well Sansa was a preteen, and I liken her initial behavior with Joffrey as the same as Anna from Frozen when she met Hans for the first time. Her fantasy was finally coming true and her life was finally starting, at least in her mind. Anyways, Sansa is the one who loses the most, as Lady dies &ndash; which incidentally pushes her further from her father and sister since she blames them for her death. Which isn&rsquo;t entirely unfounded; her father did kill Lady and Arya&rsquo;s wolf was the one that bit Joffrey. It doesn&rsquo;t help that Arya blames Sansa for Mycah&rsquo;s murder (or at least holds Sansa to some level of responsibility &ndash; like the queen and Joffrey and the hound). I want to be super clear when i say that Sansa had nothing to do with that &ndash; Mycah was already run down by the time they were having the meeting with the king.&nbsp;</p><p>So at this point we have Sansa&rsquo;s relationship with her father and sister super distant. Ned can&rsquo;t bridge the gap because he doesn&rsquo;t understand how to be a parent to Sansa. He understand&rsquo;s Arya because they are similar, but Sansa is different. She&rsquo;s a lady who was raised and influenced by his southern wife and a septa. This doesn&rsquo;t mean she isn&rsquo;t Northern. She is very proud of the fact that she understands houses of the north and reading and writing better than her brothers (though Arya is better at math than her). But Sansa prepared for a life in the south. Which is why she puts a lot of effort into repairing her relationship with her fiance. At this point, and actually throughout the entire first book, Ned has said nothing against Joffrey. Sansa is doing what she is meant to be doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Now in the books &ndash; not the shows &ndash; Sansa goes to the queen to tell her Ned plans to return them home. She has no idea that Ned went to the queen to tell her he knew about her infidelity. Why would she, Ned didn&rsquo;t confide in anyone. He hasn&rsquo;t told her anything besides the fact that she was leaving kingslanding and that the betrothal she has be working on for the past year was over. Going behind her fathers back to tell the queen, while it sounds bad, is equivalent to say asking your friend&rsquo;s parent if you could stay for a sleepover when your parents already said you can&rsquo;t. And if you say, well she still shouldn&rsquo;t have done that, well I want to say again that Ned killed Lady. Those wolves have deep relationships with the Starks. Ned, who claimed to be very close to Robert, did nothing besides a half-hearted attempt at convincing the king to spare her. he didn&rsquo;t suggest sending her north, he didn&rsquo;t pack up and leave right away, he didn&rsquo;t do anything but kill his daughter&rsquo;s direwolf.&nbsp;</p><p>As viewers/readers, we know the Lannisters are bad news. But to a character like Sansa, they aren&rsquo;t even the ruling family, the Baratheons are. Any fault can be put on Robert&rsquo;s feet since he is the king. She has no idea that Robert has little say in the going ons of the realm since he&rsquo;s in so much debt to the Lannisters, and that he&rsquo;s outnumbered by Lannister men. But the death of Lady is put more a the feet of Robert than Cersei, especially since at this point, Sansa still lives in the fantasy that Queens are supposed to be kind and gracious (and why wouldn&rsquo;t she think that; her idols are figures like good Queen Alysanne and she hasn&rsquo;t ever heard of Cersei doing anything bad). It won&rsquo;t be until Cersei starts showing her true colors that she puts the blame of lady&rsquo;s death on Cersei.&nbsp;</p><p>In Book2-3/Season 2-3, we get a bit more of a glimpse on Sansa&rsquo;s relationship with Robb. Robb is Sansa&rsquo;s knight in shining armor. (while we can&rsquo;t exactly say he started a war for her &ndash; he started a war for their father &ndash; we knows that he continued south because he wanted her back (and he wanted Joffrey off the throne, but it would have been easier to hold the north than lead a campaign south) But she knows that he is fighting a war and that she would return to him if he won.

I didn\u2019t read the books either so if it\u2019s not included on the show then it doesn\u2019t exist to me. Yes, I know this makes me annoying but I\u2019m a lazy television viewer.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/17924cec7f28f4af9ae353d479a7f0d7/tumblr_inline_pl7m3289fN1shrb8p_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p>I don\u2019t really agree incest isn\u2019t questioned in the universe.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>From what I\u2019ve seen on the show the union between Dany and Jon was met with some trepidation particularly on Tyrion\u2019s part and that\u2019s <i>before</i> he knows they\u2019re related. Incestuous relationships on <i>Games</i> are presented in a more negative light (\n\nJaime\n\n and Cersei). I don\u2019t feel like the writers are saying incest is good. And characters\u2019 reactions to incest has been less than positive. I mean, Bran was shoved out a window so Jaime and Cersei could keep their relationship (and children) secret. That\u2019s not exactly a winning endorsement of their characters or relationship.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee28679dbd8396f1844a3a4c41acc5da/tumblr_inline_pl7mssZaZf1shrb8p_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>There\u2019s a reason Jon and Dany\u2019s blood relations is being used as one of their big romance hurdles. Dany may not have a huge issue with it because she was raised Targaryen, but Jon was raised as a Stark. Methinks he\u2019s gonna have a problem with it.\u00a0 Then again maybe he won\u2019t. Dany is gorgeous. What do I know?<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"201\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"damn-maryaaaaa:J1WkiNWtF1U2SSCcnzBjNg:Z0zQ0l2PNy_4I\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b060f8ed1102370e11b501efe48c438e/tumblr_ovd2nlOzlg1uqgkw0o1_250.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"201\"/></figure><p>I understand it drives people mad when I say I\u2019m not a huge Dany and Jon shipper because they are the focus of the show. The whole momentum is building towards this romance. I get a lot of\u00a0\u201cHere\u2019s how the incest is okay\u201d explanations much like these. I\u2019m completely fine with the explanations. I just have a very\u00a0\u201cCool motive. Still murder\u201d response to it all.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"270\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/440a7cee5d8e588f3d40da93c11d10a5/tumblr_inline_pl7l7bwoNM1shrb8p_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><p>\n\n\u201cCool explanation. Still incest.\u201d This is not a judgement on anyone who does ship them. Ship away friends! Like I said - I understand incest happens on <i>Games</i>. I\u2019ve accepted it. It\u2019s just never not going to weird me out. I know Jon and Sansa are a big ship too and yet again I\u2019m all, \u201cBut cousins\u201d about it. There\u2019s only so far I can go down this rabbit hole ya know? This is one of the reasons I like Jaime and Brienne. No problematic sharing of DNA.\u00a0</p><p>I will say I am far more in favor of Dany and Jon than I am Cersei and \n\nJaime. I\u2019m also not opposed to Jon and Dany winning me over more in Season 7.

All I&rsquo;m saying is I think the writers are playing with a darker edge to Dany more than they are with Jon and I&rsquo;m excited to see where it all goes in S7.&nbsp;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t read the scripts, sooo that doesn&rsquo;t really change anything for me, sorry lol. But like I said I care very little about applying real world morality to <i>Games</i> because it&rsquo;s a show with dragons. I think there&rsquo;s some wiggle room. ;)</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><i>Anon #2 said: i agree with basically everything you said GOT wise however i have to point out, dany killed people no more or less the same as jon has. she just used a different weapon. its even in the script that jon wants to argue over how she handled it but that he couldnt because it would make him a hypocrite, so he doesnt. as for the incest thing, its not something questioned in the universe. also i think the magic in targ blood may negate it? also neds parents were both starks and jamie&rsquo;s both lannisters</i><br /></p>\n<p>\n\nYeah&hellip; like I said I know incest is a thing on <i>Games</i> and even if there&rsquo;s magic blood or an ancient sibling power couple or whatever it still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact Dany and Jon are related. I didn&rsquo;t read the books either so if it&rsquo;s not included on the show then it doesn&rsquo;t exist to me. Yes, I know this makes me annoying but I&rsquo;m a lazy television viewer.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/17924cec7f28f4af9ae353d479a7f0d7/tumblr_inline_pl7m3289fN1shrb8p_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I don&rsquo;t really agree incest isn&rsquo;t questioned in the universe.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",

But he said something that got me thinking. I\u2019d mentioned Luci. Just said that my granddaughter was fine, and he responded with \u2018She\u2019ll look like a real Northern lady one day.\u2019 It reminded me of when we were all in Winterfell. How you were gone so often. So I got the book. The one Ned Stark used to try and prove that Joffrey wasn\u2019t heir to the throne.\u201d</p><p>You could feel your heart begin to race. How she was so close to figuring it out.</p><p>\u201cAll the northern women in this book, who&rsquo;s parents were both from the north, are described, to have dark brown to black hair, often times curly. And piercing blue eyes, or deep brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you suggesting mother?\u201d</p><p>She had opened the book and flipped to a certain page</p><p>\u201cRickard Stark, black of hair. Ned Stark, brown of hair. And then Rickard\u2019s father! Black of hair!\u201d</p><p>You swallowed the lump in your throat. Your hands balling up into fists as you watched her. She was angry. The amount of rage in her eyes was evident, even while she looked down at the book.</p><p>\u201cIs Lucia a Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf sorts.&ldquo; You responded looking down at the tattered edges of your dress, from the countless times you\u2019d worn the dress before your pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cDid you lay with Robb Stark?\u201d Cersei asked looking up, she looked like she was worried about what the answer would be.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d You responded</p><p>\u201cThen who!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon Snow!\u201d</p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYour granduncle, Stannis, he&rsquo;s planning an attack on King\u2019s Landing. Renly\u2019s gone. Your uncle Robb&hellip; He wants to kill Joffrey, not that I don\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>You were interrupted by Lucia\u2019s little noises she made in response to your yammering on about the upcoming battle. </p><p>\u201cI suppose you wouldn\u2019t understand. You\u2019re just a babe. That\u2019s what aunt Marcella to call you. \u2018The little babe.\u2019\u201d</p><p>You were interrupted by Tyrion barging into your chambers. The hinges squeaking in protest. </p><p>\u201cYou told her!\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d stood up quickly, holding Lucia to your chest. You didn\u2019t have time to register it was your uncle. You\u2019d been so scared that Joffrey would find out soon after you\u2019d told your mother. That he\u2019d be so enraged he\u2019d send someone to take Lucia out of your arms and kill her in front of you.</p><p>Tyrion saw the fear in your eyes, how you clutched the back of the little girl\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to frighten you but how could you tell her? What if Joffrey finds out? He\u2019ll have her slaughtered in front of you to prove a point.\u201d He calmed down watching as you turned to walk to the window.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him. I\u2019ll die before I let him touch her.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion had scoffed at your statement. But you seemed so serious about anything involving the little girl you\u2019d named.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him before he touches me.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cJon Snow?\u201d You whispered opening the door slowly</p><p>You felt a hand grab your wrist and pull you into the room, the door closing shortly after. A pair of lips against yours within seconds. You had closed your eyes in an instant. You could feel a hand go up to your cheek and try to pull you deeper into the kiss. </p><p>Your hands went up to his cheeks, your last two fingers going behind his ears and your index and middle resting at the base of his ears and your thumbs on the apples of his cheeks.</p><p>You pulled away and opened your eyes to reveal a very dimly lit room with a very happy looking Jon Snow not very far from your face. A smile had spread across your face. \u201cWhy did you ask me here, Jon Snow?\u201d</p><p>His smile had faded away as he stared into your eyes. His dark eyes having a the highlights of the flames coming from the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d</p><p>Your heart sank as you looked at him. He\u2019d looked down at you seeing the hurt in your eyes. </p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you leave for King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. And you\u2019d felt your heart breaking. Reaching around your neck you took off the pendant that Miza had given you and placed it in Jon\u2019s right hand. He tried to hand it back, but you grabbed his hand tightly. Trapping the pendant between his larger hand and your smaller one.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIf you kill him-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPeople will thank me. Everyone believes he\u2019s the son of Cersei and Jaime Lannister. That his true born name is Joffrey Waters of King\u2019s Landing. That him, my brother and sister and I are all the bastards born of Incest from the Lannisters.\u201d </p><p>Tyrion stared at you. You were facing the window that overlooked the entire city. Lucia\u2019s head was over your shoulder, and she had a small fistful of your golden hair and her mouth open and her salvia getting on the dress you were wearing. </p><p>\u201cYou once said to my mother, her only redeeming qualities was the fact that she loves her children. If you say I\u2019m so much like my mother. What are mine?\u201d</p><p>He was taken aback by your question. But while looking at you, he could point out everything that was Jaime\u2019s, and everything that was your mother\u2019s. You had inherited the fixed upright posture of your mother, but held yourself the way Jaime did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very strong. No matter how much people tell you you\u2019re not. You love your child to no end, anyone can see that. And you\u2019re very loyal, and very brave.\u201d</p><p>You nodded to yourself watching as people moved like ants down in the city. \u201cDo you know what my name is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Y/N of house Lannister. And I will make a vow to everyone in this city and the other six kingdoms, that I will kill King Joffrey, and give the throne to my brother Tommen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Lannister, and you want to kill another Lannister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLannister\u2019s are thoughtful. We think things through. We fight battles and we bring honor to our house. He brings dishonor to not just Lannister, but Baratheon. He\u2019s no king.\u201d</p><hr><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a></p>",

He&rsquo;d looked down at you seeing the hurt in your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When you leave for King&rsquo;s Landing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the morning?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded. And you&rsquo;d felt your heart breaking. Reaching around your neck you took off the pendant that Miza had given you and placed it in Jon&rsquo;s right hand. He tried to hand it back, but you grabbed his hand tightly. Trapping the pendant between his larger hand and your smaller one.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you kill him-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People will thank me. Everyone believes he&rsquo;s the son of Cersei and Jaime Lannister. That his true born name is Joffrey Waters of King&rsquo;s Landing. That him, my brother and sister and I are all the bastards born of Incest from the Lannisters.&rdquo; </p><p>Tyrion stared at you. You were facing the window that overlooked the entire city. Lucia&rsquo;s head was over your shoulder, and she had a small fistful of your golden hair and her mouth open and her salvia getting on the dress you were wearing. </p><p>&ldquo;You once said to my mother, her only redeeming qualities was the fact that she loves her children. If you say I&rsquo;m so much like my mother. What are mine?&rdquo;</p><p>He was taken aback by your question. But while looking at you, he could point out everything that was Jaime&rsquo;s, and everything that was your mother&rsquo;s. You had inherited the fixed upright posture of your mother, but held yourself the way Jaime did.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very strong. No matter how much people tell you you&rsquo;re not. You love your child to no end, anyone can see that. And you&rsquo;re very loyal, and very brave.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded to yourself watching as people moved like ants down in the city. &ldquo;Do you know what my name is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N Baratheon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Y/N of house Lannister. And I will make a vow to everyone in this city and the other six kingdoms, that I will kill King Joffrey, and give the throne to my brother Tommen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Lannister, and you want to kill another Lannister?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lannister&rsquo;s are thoughtful. We think things through. We fight battles and we bring honor to our house. He brings dishonor to not just Lannister, but Baratheon. He&rsquo;s no king.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a></p></p>",
