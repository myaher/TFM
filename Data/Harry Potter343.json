Enough, he says.</p><p>It all started when he had walked into Harry Potter on his way to the shower.</p><p>Harry Potter with pleasantly tanned, golden, soft looking skin. Beads of water were running all down along with soap suds.</p><p>Draco stopped in his tracks. So he might have a low-key crush on him. Very low-key. And he might also want Harry to fuck the living daylights out of him. So what!</p><p>On returning to his Eight Year of Hogwarts, Headmistress McGonagall had made all the twenty returning students live in a separate tower, <i>together, </i>with a common common room and all the works. Which had incidentally led to this moment where although things were mostly tense he could now hold a legit conversation with Pansy, Potter and Granger. Try as he might(honestly, who was he kidding, he didn\u2019t even try) being in the same room as Weasley without going back to his old ways was constant challenge. The feeling was, but of course, mutual. Things with Blaise, as always, were too complicated to decipher.</p><p>But he could talk to Potter-no, <i>Harry</i> now, and he could touch him. Light touches on his forearms, his thighs, his shoulder. It didn\u2019t seem like much, however Draco\u2019s rapidly evolving crush was growing in a geometric way. He didn\u2019t even know how it started. One day he was barely saying Potter and nodding and the next he was having long conversations under the stars on top of the astronomy tower with a blanket and everything. He was just so animated, his hands moved when he was describing something, his hair flopped forward, his smile reached his eyes and his laugh rid Draco of all nightmares. It was horribly cheesy and he couldn\u2019t control his heart so <i>shut up.</i></p><p><i>And here he was, </i>watching as Harry\u2019s abs rippled and his biceps flexed. Where was all this hiding normally?</p><p>\u201cOh hey, Draco!\u201d he said when he saw Draco standing like a statue. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d Harry\u2019s eyebrows frowned.</p><p>\u201cUh, I.. er\u2026 I just\u2026 um.. shower and..- I er,\u201d stuttered Draco, knowing his cheeks were bright red. He blushed and then scrapping up what little dignity he had left fled the showers.</p><p>Well no point in beating himself up for spilt milk. What\u2019s done was done. Thankfully Harry hadn\u2019t commented on his weird behaviour at all and things had moved on smoothly.</p><p>Well mostly.</p><p>Draco had opted to sit on an armchair rather than the sofa he had started to share with Harry. Granger had narrowed her eyes and Harry had given him an oddly hurt look but didn\u2019t comment. Draco bit his lips and averted his eyes. No way could he share such a space with Potter without touching him, putting his hands in Harry\u2019s interlocking them, kissing them fingers.</p><p><i>Draco, no,</i> he thought to himself. He was becoming a very sappy twelve year old girl and it would just not do. And besides, Harry was straight and never look at Draco that way. Even if he was their past would catch up to them. Pining for Potter would only lead to heartbreak and well\u2026</p><p>But where were them muscles, those smooth abs, rippling with every move, those sold forearms, and slight biceps; that very hard hard chest and extremely cute butt. Where, Draco asks, where? He could practically fantasize being held in his strong embrace. But out here, in the common room, surrounded by various eight years, there was absolutely no sight of the golden smooth skin.</p><p>Harry was lounging on the sofa, the Transfiguration book in his lap, looking very cute, biting his lips, a quill resting on his cheek. He wore some ghastly large T-shirt with another ghastly plaid red shirt over him. It looked at least ten years old, cuts and frayed around the edges. Stains were all over it. Draco wrinkled his nose. Now that he knew what was underneath them, he hated those clothes with a passion. He had on some baggy Jeans, held on tight with a ratty looking belt.</p><p>So Draco had had enough. Enough,he says.</p><p>So he jumps from his armchair, wand in hand and stalks towards Harry, looking admittedly deranged. Honestly, he would just love to tear off the garments from Harry\u2019s skin in the common room itself. But the last few years have taught Draco patience, so he wont. For now. He could see Granger snap her book shut and Weasley on his feet wand out.</p><p>But Draco has already cast the measurement taking spell and was on his way out of the common room leaving behind a bewildered Harry.</p><p>He had a trip to make.</p><p>Hogsmeade admittedly had some very nice shops for fashion. Custom made shirts and suits could wait, Draco was here on an emergency mission. Entering a shop, he held his breath. Only the best would \u00a0do for Harry but he couldn\u2019t splurge. It wouldn&rsquo;t look good. So he selected three shirts, as sea green (hoping it would make his eyes stand out), a classic black, and a light grey( cause <i>grey</i>). He chose some T-shirts, and some denims jeans. These were kind of a recent additions in light of the war, but Harry should love them. Next he picked a cream coloured trousers, just because it looked pretty and Draco wanted to look at nice bums. He wasn\u2019t altruistic in any way, c\u2019mon. Then he made his way back to Hogwarts. He would have bought more but he settled for some funky mufflers and socks (with huge polka dots, and outlandish orange colour, and one in baby pink). Draco was sure he was a compulsive shopper; but he just couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p>As he trudged up the stairs, he though he might have gone overboard. But no matter he bought lots of tacos from a new shop so he was pretty confident he could distract them if need be.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked Harry looking at the selection of clothes around him.</p><p>They were up in the dorm room, and Draco was looking impatient.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I am sure you have never seen clothes. Now strip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go shopping at this time, on a weekday!\u201d exclaimed Harry.</p><p>Poor Harry, he really doesn\u2019t have his priorities sorted, Draco thought as he took another bite of his taco. They were a huge success. Harry had already wolfed down two and was more open to suggestions.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I have all night.So there no point trying to get out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to see me naked,\u201d and he grinned, and oh he had dimples. Draco was pretty sure he melted just a little.</p><p>\u201cOnly a little bit,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Harry titled his head, and regarded Draco with his deep eyes.</p><p>Draco was sure he was blushing a bright red. \u201cJust shut and try them on.\u201d</p><p>Harry started pulling his shirt over his head. \u201cI am just saying you didn\u2019t have to buy me clothes just to see me naked. You just had to ask.\u201d Then he unzipped his trousers to pull off his trousers.</p><p>Draco had to fan himself. He didn\u2019t even care that Harry could see him. All that creamy skin!</p><p>Now it was Harry\u2019s turn to blush under Draco\u2019s heavy lidded gaze. He turned and quickly put on the dark blue jeans he had brought. He stopped and turned when he heard a sharp intake of breath. Draco was flushed bright right down to his throat. His plump lips were parted just a bit and his eyes were lidded.He had somehow messed up his hair so it looked ruffled up.</p><p>Without meaning to he blurted out, \u201cCan I kiss you now?\u201d</p><p>Draco looked startled, and a bit hopeful, he bit his lips and whispered a little yes.</p><p>Well that was all the signal he needed. He surged forward and gently tipped Draco\u2019s face up with his fingers. His eyes were so bright, and there was a small smile playing on his lips. Harry closed the distance between them and kissed him. A strangled groan was released and he didn\u2019t know who had made it. All he knew was that Draco had the softest lips possible. They were utterly pliable under him and moved against him really well. A soft moan escaped him and he knew without doubt that he was well and truly fucked. Draco Malfoy, who would have thought. He smiled against the kiss and parted his lips. Draco took the opportunity to slip his tongue between his and started slowly prodding-</p><p>The door banged open. And then Ron let out a very shrill cry, \u201cMione they are kissing! Oh my, bloody hell!\u201d</p><p>Harry groaned. Draco separated from him in an instant and Harry already missed the warm plaint mount. \u201cRon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah, sorry,no cock blocking,\u201d grumbled Ron, then realising what he had said, \u201cAww hell no, Mione! You were right! Mate?!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ron!\u2019\u2019</i> groaned Harry, leave it to best friends to be utter prats.</p><p>\u201cFine, fine!\u201d Ron held up his hands, \u201cI am going! Enjoy the\u2026 whatever you are doing!\u201d They he closed the door and went back down. Well at least the whole of eighth year knew now.</p><p>Harry looked back at Draco. He was standing uncertainly, biting his swollen lips. \u201cSo..\u201d he trailed off.</p><p>\u201cCan we please go back to what we were doing?\u201d He took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d \u00a0Draco held up a hand. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>He looked like a lost puppy and Harry just wanted to cuddle him up. \u201cWell, I thought, a couple of kisses, and a couple of dates and we\u2019ll see how I goes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d asked Draco, something like hope glinting in his eyes. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p><p>And then Draco gave him the brightest smile and kissed him deeply. All clothes forgotten.</p><p>Harry wrapped his hands around his waist and pulled him in hard.</p>",

It was horribly cheesy and he couldn\u2019t control his heart so <i>shut up.</i></p><p><i>And here he was, </i>watching as Harry\u2019s abs rippled and his biceps flexed. Where was all this hiding normally?</p><p>\u201cOh hey, Draco!\u201d he said when he saw Draco standing like a statue. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d Harry\u2019s eyebrows frowned.</p><p>\u201cUh, I.. er\u2026 I just\u2026 um.. shower and..- I er,\u201d stuttered Draco, knowing his cheeks were bright red. He blushed and then scrapping up what little dignity he had left fled the showers.</p><p>Well no point in beating himself up for spilt milk. What\u2019s done was done. Thankfully Harry hadn\u2019t commented on his weird behaviour at all and things had moved on smoothly.</p><p>Well mostly.</p><p>Draco had opted to sit on an armchair rather than the sofa he had started to share with Harry. Granger had narrowed her eyes and Harry had given him an oddly hurt look but didn\u2019t comment. Draco bit his lips and averted his eyes. No way could he share such a space with Potter without touching him, putting his hands in Harry\u2019s interlocking them, kissing them fingers.</p><p><i>Draco, no,</i> he thought to himself. He was becoming a very sappy twelve year old girl and it would just not do. And besides, Harry was straight and never look at Draco that way. Even if he was their past would catch up to them. Pining for Potter would only lead to heartbreak and well\u2026</p><p>But where were them muscles, those smooth abs, rippling with every move, those sold forearms, and slight biceps; that very hard hard chest and extremely cute butt. Where, Draco asks, where? He could practically fantasize being held in his strong embrace. But out here, in the common room, surrounded by various eight years, there was absolutely no sight of the golden smooth skin.</p><p>Harry was lounging on the sofa, the Transfiguration book in his lap, looking very cute, biting his lips, a quill resting on his cheek. He wore some ghastly large T-shirt with another ghastly plaid red shirt over him. It looked at least ten years old, cuts and frayed around the edges. Stains were all over it. Draco wrinkled his nose. Now that he knew what was underneath them, he hated those clothes with a passion. He had on some baggy Jeans, held on tight with a ratty looking belt.</p><p>So Draco had had enough. Enough,he says.</p><p>So he jumps from his armchair, wand in hand and stalks towards Harry, looking admittedly deranged. Honestly, he would just love to tear off the garments from Harry\u2019s skin in the common room itself. But the last few years have taught Draco patience, so he wont. For now. He could see Granger snap her book shut and Weasley on his feet wand out.</p><p>But Draco has already cast the measurement taking spell and was on his way out of the common room leaving behind a bewildered Harry.</p><p>He had a trip to make.</p><p>Hogsmeade admittedly had some very nice shops for fashion. Custom made shirts and suits could wait, Draco was here on an emergency mission. Entering a shop, he held his breath. Only the best would \u00a0do for Harry but he couldn\u2019t splurge. It wouldn\u2019t look good. So he selected three shirts, as sea green (hoping it would make his eyes stand out), a classic black, and a light grey( cause <i>grey</i>). He chose some T-shirts, and some denims jeans. These were kind of a recent additions in light of the war, but Harry should love them. Next he picked a cream coloured trousers, just because it looked pretty and Draco wanted to look at nice bums. He wasn\u2019t altruistic in any way, c\u2019mon. Then he made his way back to Hogwarts. He would have bought more but he settled for some funky mufflers and socks (with huge polka dots, and outlandish orange colour, and one in baby pink). Draco was sure he was a compulsive shopper; but he just couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>As he trudged up the stairs, he though he might have gone overboard. But no matter he bought lots of tacos from a new shop so he was pretty confident he could distract them if need be.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked Harry looking at the selection of clothes around him.</p><p>They were up in the dorm room, and Draco was looking impatient.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I am sure you have never seen clothes. Now strip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go shopping at this time, on a weekday!\u201d exclaimed Harry.</p><p>Poor Harry, he really doesn\u2019t have his priorities sorted, Draco thought as he took another bite of his taco. They were a huge success. Harry had already wolfed down two and was more open to suggestions.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I have all night.So there no point trying to get out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to see me naked,\u201d and he grinned, and oh he had dimples. Draco was pretty sure he melted just a little.</p><p>\u201cOnly a little bit,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Harry titled his head, and regarded Draco with his deep eyes.</p><p>Draco was sure he was blushing a bright red. \u201cJust shut and try them on.\u201d</p><p>Harry started pulling his shirt over his head. \u201cI am just saying you didn\u2019t have to buy me clothes just to see me naked. You just had to ask.\u201d Then he unzipped his trousers to pull off his trousers.</p><p>Draco had to fan himself. He didn\u2019t even care that Harry could see him. All that creamy skin!</p><p>Now it was Harry\u2019s turn to blush under Draco\u2019s heavy lidded gaze. He turned and quickly put on the dark blue jeans he had brought. He stopped and turned when he heard a sharp intake of breath. Draco was flushed bright right down to his throat. His plump lips were parted just a bit and his eyes were lidded.He had somehow messed up his hair so it looked ruffled up.</p><p>Without meaning to he blurted out, \u201cCan I kiss you now?\u201d</p><p>Draco looked startled, and a bit hopeful, he bit his lips and whispered a little yes.</p><p>Well that was all the signal he needed. He surged forward and gently tipped Draco\u2019s face up with his fingers. His eyes were so bright, and there was a small smile playing on his lips. Harry closed the distance between them and kissed him. A strangled groan was released and he didn\u2019t know who had made it. All he knew was that Draco had the softest lips possible. They were utterly pliable under him and moved against him really well. A soft moan escaped him and he knew without doubt that he was well and truly fucked. Draco Malfoy, who would have thought. He smiled against the kiss and parted his lips. Draco took the opportunity to slip his tongue between his and started slowly prodding-</p><p>The door banged open. And then Ron let out a very shrill cry, \u201cMione they are kissing! Oh my, bloody hell!\u201d</p><p>Harry groaned. Draco separated from him in an instant and Harry already missed the warm plaint mount. \u201cRon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah, sorry,no cock blocking,\u201d grumbled Ron, then realising what he had said, \u201cAww hell no, Mione! You were right! Mate?!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ron!\u2019\u2019</i> groaned Harry, leave it to best friends to be utter prats.</p><p>\u201cFine, fine!\u201d Ron held up his hands, \u201cI am going! Enjoy the\u2026 whatever you are doing!\u201d They he closed the door and went back down. Well at least the whole of eighth year knew now.</p><p>Harry looked back at Draco. He was standing uncertainly, biting his swollen lips. \u201cSo..\u201d he trailed off.</p><p>\u201cCan we please go back to what we were doing?\u201d He took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d \u00a0Draco held up a hand. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>He looked like a lost puppy and Harry just wanted to cuddle him up. \u201cWell, I thought, a couple of kisses, and a couple of dates and we\u2019ll see how I goes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d asked Draco, something like hope glinting in his eyes. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p><p>And then Draco gave him the brightest smile and kissed him deeply. All clothes forgotten.</p><p>Harry wrapped his hands around his waist and pulled him in hard.</p></p>",

Enough, he says.</p><p>It all started when he had walked into Harry Potter on his way to the shower.</p><p>Harry Potter with pleasantly tanned, golden, soft looking skin. Beads of water were running all down along with soap suds.</p><p>Draco stopped in his tracks. So he might have a low-key crush on him. Very low-key. And he might also want Harry to fuck the living daylights out of him. So what!</p><p>On returning to his Eight Year of Hogwarts, Headmistress McGonagall had made all the twenty returning students live in a separate tower, <i>together, </i>with a common common room and all the works. Which had incidentally led to this moment where although things were mostly tense he could now hold a legit conversation with Pansy, Potter and Granger. Try as he might(honestly, who was he kidding, he didn&rsquo;t even try) being in the same room as Weasley without going back to his old ways was constant challenge. The feeling was, but of course, mutual. Things with Blaise, as always, were too complicated to decipher.</p><p>But he could talk to Potter-no, <i>Harry</i> now, and he could touch him. Light touches on his forearms, his thighs, his shoulder. It didn&rsquo;t seem like much, however Draco&rsquo;s rapidly evolving crush was growing in a geometric way. He didn&rsquo;t even know how it started. One day he was barely saying Potter and nodding and the next he was having long conversations under the stars on top of the astronomy tower with a blanket and everything. He was just so animated, his hands moved when he was describing something, his hair flopped forward, his smile reached his eyes and his laugh rid Draco of all nightmares.
