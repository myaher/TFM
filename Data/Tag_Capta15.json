You are \u00a0humming a song you heard on the radio a couple of times, as you do your work in peace. After telling Carol what you wanted things have been good \u00a0between you two. You told your son,well more like asked him what he thought about the idea of having a sibling. He was delighted with the prospect of being a big brother and kept asking when he would meet his new sibling.</p><p>So without wasting anymore time you started the process. Again Carol there by your side every moment needed. Even when she had a few missions lightyears away she stayed in communication with you, the whole time</p><p>In fact one of those missions was the reason you were currently studying this behind rock in the laboratory \u00a0now. Finally after so many dead ends on the energy surges across the universe the Guardians alongside Carol had found a rock that seemed part of the reason of what was happening, in the universe.</p><p>Ever since it had arrived you had been studying it alongside Banner and Tony. You guys still did not know much about it but little by little you guys were making some progress, to everyone&rsquo;s relief.</p><p>A small smile appears on your face as you finish your notes for the day and close your laptop. You are excited for tonight since you are finally taking a pregnancy test. Although you can not wait you are more than a little bit nervous because unlike science . There was still that possibility that it would not work. &ldquo;Then we will just try again.&rdquo; You hear Carols voice replying in your head. Smiling you stand up from your desk and \u00a0start to finish up at the lab as you turn ready to leave. A bright light hits your eyes, then darkness.</p><p>_________________________________________</p><p>&ldquo;Where is she!?&rdquo; Carol yells as she rushes around the med bay trying to get a glimpse of you. She is still mindful of her sleeping son, she had just picked him up from Marias when she got the call from Tony. She had made a very illegal turn towards the compound the second she heard that something happened to you. </p><p>The drive over had been a blur mostly. All that she was focused on was getting to you. The second she was in the building she had taken off to the med bay ignoring the greetings from the others around her.</p><p>&ldquo;Carol wait-&rdquo; Tony tried to stop her, but carol sharply turned to him with anger and worry in her eyes &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare Tony! How would you feel to get a call that your wife was found unconscious in her lab with no trace of what happened?&rdquo; She is pissed but in reality she is just scared and Tony knows that, not taking Carol outburst towards him personal. She could not lose you even though she knew that with you being human she would lose you at some point. But she does not want it to be now, hell not ever.</p><p>&ldquo;I get it Carol, but maybe take your sleeping son somewhere else before you kill us all.&rdquo; Tony tried to joke falling flat. But it makes Carol remember the little boy she is holding. Silently looking down to her son and nodding she went to put Nick somewhere he will not be disturbed. Finding Nat along the way and having her keep an eye on him, while she tried to make sure you were okay.</p><p>She walked back to the med bay area before she could get her question out Banner started talking.</p><p>&ldquo;We do not know what happened. I walked in to the lab at the time I always do and found her. I tried waking her but she was unresponsive to me, so I got Tony and we brought her down here. And of course called you.&rdquo; He explained trying to keep his voice calm even though one of his best friends was laying unconscious and unmoving in a bed. Carol walked over to your side looking at your peaceful face and stroked your cheek it seemed like you were just sleeping but obviously that was not the case since no one had been able to wake you. She moved her hand from your cheek to your hair and ran her fingers through it.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you guys checked the surveillance footage?&rdquo; She asked looking around at their faces, after Tony had caught up to her joining Carol in your room. Shaking his head Tony answers her &ldquo;We did but there literally nothing. She picked up her stuff turned and the next moment she collapsed.&rdquo;</p><p>She sighed \u00a0and looked back at your resting form, today was the day. You both would have figured out if you were going to be mothers again. She felt her anger and frustration take over. Her eyes started to tear up as she looked at you. Tony and Bruce stood quiet the latter deciding to leave to let her be. Tony on the other hand walked over to the other side of the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done some tests and everything is normal. So their both ok.&rdquo; At that Carol looked up at Tony, with hope. Eyes wide, tears now falling down her cheeks. He looked back at her with a small smile on his face &ldquo;Congrats captain, you have another pilot on the way.&rdquo;</p>",
